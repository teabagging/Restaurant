Count them. I don't care if they're only like 12 blocks from my office. In six minutes, they somehow took my online order and made it into a fully customized sandwich with many 'extra' boxes clicked, handed the address to a delivery boy, who handed it to me in SIX MINUTES. \\n\\nThis is amazing. This is the future. Now if only some Thai, Mexican or Italian places would deliver to this area, I could skip lunches and just sit at work and let my belly grow without even getting in the car.  Many of my co-workers order from here. Their sandwiches are better than Subway. I prefer the club ones on 9 grain bread Even the 'Vito' with salami lacked flavor. How does salami lack flavor? My boss says extra meat is the way to go on the subs, but one try was enough on those for me.\\n\\nThe 9 grain Billy Club (ham and roast beef) was HUGE and tasty-the bread tasted fresh and was soft. I ordered extra lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers, and their Italian dressing on the sandwich. So when I was done, I had a little salad out of my sandwich droppings. Yes, I'm a dork but this made it feel like a healthier lunch! Delivery people have been nice both times I've used them, literally running back to their car.\\n\\nThe online ordering is flawless.

Let me tell you, we were SO disappointed. \\n\\nFirst, the way this place is structured it's basically a \\"sushi\\" type menu. You make your taco selections on a piece of paper and the waitress takes that to the kitchen. Simple, and unique. I was willing to try.\\n\\nMy husband and I decided to split some nachos to start. The waitress brings out this basket piled high with mostly lettuce. Not a chip to be seen. When I ask her for some plates so we could eat these messy lettuce based nachos she tells me, \\"we don't have plates.\\" Strike one. So instead she brings us two baskets with a paper liner that won't even stay in the basket without any weight. So we send up eating our nachos off of paper liners on the table which is gross because it's a bar. Ever tried eating your dinner off a bar table? The worst part: once we found the chips they were the crumbles that must have been the last of a bag. Horrible.\\n\\nThen we each ordered three tacos (which was WAY too much food, but that was our fault). My husband and I both got the special (which was the only taco with ground beef on the menu, and we were told by the waitress that the only way we could get ground beef on a taco was to order the special more on that later). The special was the only decent taco my husband and I had. Then we each had two different tacos. My husband had some breakfast taco with egg that was absolutely drenched in tabasco sauce and made him so ill he couldn't even try the other taco he had ordered. I had a sea food taco which was disgusting. I think I had maybe two bites. And the other was a surf and turf which had one measly piece of questionable red meat, and I'm not sure what the seafood on it was supposed to be because it was not there. Everything we ate was smothered in onions and had a good helping of pickled jalape√±os so maybe they were running low on other supplies??\\n\\nLastly, it may have been the way the waitress was explaining the menu that made it confusing, but there were two menus to work from. The first was their suggested tacos, basically their house specials. The other was a make your own option. However, we both heard her say that if you want certain ingredients they only come on certain tacos (like the ground beef). I really don't understand a business model that does not let customers get certain ingredients on their meals, especially if you have it in house, why not make the customer happy and give it to them if they want it? Guess I'll be left to ponder that one.\\n\\nMy husband and I have both been sick for the rest of the night. I can't imagine eating this food and drinking any kind of alcohol as I for sure would have throw up. As we were paying for our food we both looked at each other and said, would we come back here? And the resounding answer was N.O. So save yourselves and go to a regular old tex-mex place where you can get tacos with whatever ingredients you want, nachos on actual plates that aren't crumbs, and that won't send you to the bathroom for the rest of the night burping onions and farting pickled jalape√±os."},{"name":"Wonton Asian Kitchen","address":"1230 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"I've passed this place more than once and every time ...

That is standard for most all you can eat places, so I don't know why people are so shocked. Also, for sushi you have to clear your plate or be charged surplus, but for apps/sides like rice or noodles you don't have to.\\n\\nThat being said, the sushi is terrific- not gourmet, but for $15 you can't get a better deal for lunch. Sexy girl is one of the best maki they have, filled with spicy tuna ad covered in tempura flakes. Quality is fairly consistent across the board - good quality suburban sushi.

Joan & Ed's was outdated  and overpriced. I don't know how they stayed open as long as they did! \\n\\n I was THRILLED when I saw Zaftig's had moved in. I have eaten there 5 times in 4 weeks. We are always greeted with a smile. The staff is courteous (my daughter dropped her magazine between the wall and her booth seat and the lengths the staff went through to get that magazine back, oy!) They serve crispy bagel chips and herbed cream cheese as soon as you are seated, yummy yummy! I The homemade matzoh ball soup is also quite good, though my little girl was overwhelmed by all the vegetables in it - something an adult appreciates though is lost on the little ones! The sandwiches are huge. My husband and I share everything. We shared a tuna melt last night, enjoyed it. We also shared a basic salad with balsamic vinegar dressing, it was fresh and we agreed it was good dressing. My father in law says the half sour pickles are like the ones they used to eat at Jewish delis when he was a kid in Brookline.\\n\\nIt's clean. The front door area does have an area that separates those coming in from those waiting to be seated, which is nice so you don't get a blast of cold air as you wait. \\n\\n We always grab a cookie ($1) on the way out for dessert, they have two - sugar & chocolate chip. Last night we went and asked for one of each and before the fellow behind the counter got one out of the jar, he dashed to the kitchen and got us fresh warm ones (or maybe he microwaved them?) Didn't matter because they were JUST what we wanted, a warm cookie to head out the door with. I find the kid menu totally reasonable. Plus my kids love that they can get breakfast items for dinner!\\n\\nTheir menu is extensive. They have a full bar and bar seating.\\n\\nIt does get loud in there but it's family oriented, so what can you expect?

The food is always delicious, the staff is always efficient and knowledgeable, and it's conveniently located around the corner from my apartment. We've been going there for a few years now, and have never had a disappointing visit. But Guy Fiere, I curse thee! Ever since the restaurant was featured on the Food Network, it has gone from \\"worth the wait\\" to \\"too stressful to enjoy.\\" Last night was the first time I had been there since they opened the new bar across the street (genius!). I showed up to put my name on the list for a table of four around 5:30 p.m., went back to my apartment to get ready and meet up with the rest of my party, and then hit the bar around 7:00 p.m. to have a few drinks while we waited for our table. And waited. And waited. And waited.\\n\\nThe bar, Prima e Dopo, is very nice and cozy, has a great list of cocktails (some for as low as $5, a rarity in Boston), and has a sophisticated decor while retaining the casual neighborhood feel of the main dining room. However, even the nicest, coziest, cheapest bar in the world doesn't entirely take the edge off of waiting three-and-a-half hours for a table on a Thursday night. And that's how long it took. By the time we actually got seated around 9 p.m., the experience of the restaurant was completely beside the point. It felt like we had been on a long odyssey and would have been happy with a few crusts of bread. Conditions like these do not leave one in the frame of mind to really appreciate the endless list of phenomenal dishes (lobster ravioli! matriciana! calamari! anything and everything). I have always felt that Rino's was hands-down the best Italian place in Boston, and part of its charm was the fact that it was a little neighborhood place, always busy but still accessible. No more - the dining-in experience has lost its appeal.

Out of all 5 the only one I thought was decent was the pork with the jackfruit salsa. To sum it up it was your run of the mill Americanized taco joint that tries to be Mexican.

Fortunately, Istanbul'lu nailed it.\\n\\nBefore looking over the menus we were given a bowl of homemade bread and roasted red pepper spread that I admittedly inhaled because it was so delicious (or was it because I was ravenous after lifting stupid boxes up and down flights of stairs all day?).

She ordered the Sultan's Delight (same as Tas Kabab, except over a Turkish style eggplant puree). Home. Run. Loved it. Just the right proportions and it was made with great care to detail.

I took my first bite and half the meat came with it. Maybe it could be pulled or just roughly cut to avoid this. I hate when I can't portion out the meat in a sandwich and am left with nothing but a mouthful of bread by the end. The runny egg on top added a very welcome richness.

Simple...and awesome. Please note: If you are able to refrain from inhaling the entire plate of yumminess and take home leftovers, do remember to remove the mozzarella chunks before reheating. Otherwise, you'll be left with melted globs of cheese stuck to your plate, which may or may not result in tears forming in the corner of your eyes as you stare at your once-masterpiece and think about what might have been. \\n\\nThe lemon basil mojito is the best drink ever. Seriously. Ever. I would go back for the drink alone. \\n\\nSo why not five stars after all my gushing? Well, when I crave Italian, it means I am craving one thing: bread. And yes, I did get a thin slice of something resembling pita bread with my meal. Let me repeat: with my meal. Noooooo! That is not the way you do it. You serve a basket full of thick, fresh, steaming bread alongside a plate of olive oil or some fancy butter before our meals arrive. Period. No exceptions.

I then explained to her that I had been waiting for the manager to call me back for over a week now and everyone is starting to get in route to the restaurant. I live in Deland (approx. 40 mins away) but I had family members coming from as far as Daytona Beach and Kissimmee areas (an hour and a half drive easy).

My all time favorite southern appetizer. The fried green tomatoes at the smoke shop were golden brown and crispy and the green tomatoes were so fresh but where's the salt?? There was no salt or seasoning in the breading. The only saving grace was it came with a sauce to help with the lack of seasoning and flavor.\\n\\nThen I ordered the Pit Boss. Yeah that sounds bad ass!\\nIt's a choice of Three Meats & Three Sides and you could down size to a Pit Crew, which is choice of Two Meats & Two Sides. But I'm greedy and I like to sample as much as I can. I selected the pork ribs, brisket and the bar wings and had sides of corn bread, pimento mac and cheese and the bacon collards. Now that's a load of food. In addition to that I got some Texas toast with pimento cheese spread and some jalape√±os, pickled red onions and pickles. Woo wee! As good as it all looked, it didn't taste as good as it looked. My favorite was the wings, which were so crispy and flavorful as well as the pork ribs. But the pork ribs were on the dry side. Everything else wasn't fantastic. The brisket was juicy but I think they gave me a really fatty one and the mac and cheese, had no pimento taste to it. The Texas toast had more pimento cheese flavor than the mac and cheese and the collard greens, meh.\\n\\nEven with all that I want to come back. I'm eyeing the fried chicken. So we'll see how the second time goes and if I have a better tasting experience. Plus I did have awesome service for my first time.

The bottles of wine kept coming, and I don't know if that was by our choice (since I couldn't hear that side of the table), or if the waiter saw an opportunity to cash in.  \\n\\nThe food was good.  The meat, as expected, was fresh, flavorful and cooked perfectly.  I do like it when I order \\"rare\\" and actually get it that way.  However, portions were small and accompaniment was stark.  For me, it's always a question of value.  Was what I got worth what I paid for it?

And because it was 50% up to $10 max off we ordered a little more than we normally would.\\n\\nHere's what we ordered:\\n1. Side greek salad - good. They put the dressing on the side which I was happy with.\\n2. Slice of pizza with mushrooms - The crust was pretty decent. I wish there was more sauce and the cheese was ok. It's not the gooey kind that stretches after taking a bite. It's actually coagulated.  The mushroom are fresh, not the kind from a can. But it looked like they just added sliced raw mushrooms on top of a pizza slice and reheated in the oven. The mushroom did not stick to the cheese so it would easily fall off. \\n3. Slice of pizza with meatballs. Again the meatball was cut into tiny pizza and it was not hot. It was OK tasting. But again it did not stick to the cheese, it was probably just added on after the pizza was heated.\\n4. Mozz Knots - they accidentally served us the plain garlic knots first. I accepted it because I assume the cheese would be inside of the knot. Well it wasn't, but I kept eating it because it was good and decided was necessary to send it back. Anyway they brought the mozz knots and told us they gave us the plain one by mistake. They gave us the mozz knots even though we already ate most of the plain ones. I actually liked the plain ones better. Not worth it to pay $1.50 for the cheese. As I mentioned before, the mozz cheese is not so greate.\\n5. Chicken philly sandwich. I did not taste this buy my husband said it was OK, not great.\\n\\nThe item I liked best for the Garlic Knot that I didn't even order.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and attentive.\\n\\nFood was not GREAT, but it's a casual joint that I probably would go to just to eat something quick and cheap. The bill came out to about $26 without the scout mob deal. With the discount it was $16. And wouldn't expect 5 stars at that price.\\n\\nI might go back for the garlic knots alone.\\n\\nMy favorite casual pizza place is actually Vinny's New York Pizza in midtown.

The concept is the same everywhere: choose a platter, meat option, veggies, and amount of red and white sauce. The meat here is noticeably dry, especially the later in the day it gets. Chicken is slightly better. Pita you get is also dry and stale. I hate how the white and red sauce packets cost extra and you can only get them free as you order it. Especially with how spicy the red sauce is, it's very hard to pinpoint the right amount of heat in your food. Ask for too many squirts of it and you'll be dying and running back and forth to the water fountain. It's best to play it safe and only order one \\"line\\" of the red sauce. The white sauce is your typical tzatziki sauce, but creamier and less depth in flavor.

As I entered the place which reeks of oil there was NO air conditioning yet she insists she gave me incorrect price quote on phone and insisted I pay an extra $3.75 for her mistake. I paid but then her behavior and the total price did NOT sit well with me. I did the math and confirmed the amount should not have been outrageous $28 for just 2 orders double patty turkey patties. The girl was yelling as if I could not do the math embarrassing and talk to me with no regard. I was insaulted by her spiteful demeanor. Worst of all publicized in clear site of other customers. She needs to learn quality customer service and how to retain existing customers.

Also she Failed to produce Valid Itemized receipt I asked 3 x. One time she said she was busy she had to get fries for other customers. So LAME.

That excitement got killed pretty quick.\\n\\nI called to check whether they take reservations for 6:30 on a Saturday night, and the guy on the phone said no, but walk-in's at at that time should have no problem.  NOT!\\n\\nThis is the start of a what was going to continue to be a series of failures in customer service all night...  We arrived promptly at 6:30pm only to find the line-up almost out the door!  NO ONE was there to greet you and to at least give you an idea of the wait was going to be!  There was already a sitting that was looked like it was ready to leave.  The entire row of bench seats was empty!  I am sure there were lots of people who didn't mind sitting there to get their dinners!  \\n\\nNo one came to assign seating or take names for at least 5-10 minutes?  There was a cashier girl there, but when asked, she didn't know a THING!  She wasn't responsible for a thing and didn't care about a thing either.\\n\\nThere was a lady behind me complaining enough to make the guy in front of me be nice enough to go into the restaurant to ask for all of us!  \\n\\nWhat were the staff waiting for?  Where's the manager anyways?  He was just chilling in the back standing there doing nothing the entire time.\\n\\nWhen the owner-manager FINALLY got around to walking to the front of the restaurant to start seating us, that's when the restaurant actually started filling out!  I'm still super confused about what the deal was in making a lot of people wait.  From what I could see, at least two parties left because nothing happened.  I should've done the same.\\n\\nSince we wanted to sit in a booth for two, we waited an extra 15 minutes and oddly enough another 10 minutes had to pass before one of the two waitresses came by!  There were at least 3 other bus girls just doing laps of the restaurant!  The manager seemed pretty un-interested in how anyone was doing.  He didn't even help with a thing the entire time we were there.\\n\\nSo, we were finally able to order, and then we unexpectedly waited 45 minutes for our meal!  The nice guy who went in earlier to enquire about seating for the whole group coincidentally sat on the benches opposite our booth and when they finished eating surprisingly noticed that we didn't get our meals yet!  He felt so bad for us, he went to the manager to let them know!  Not that we didn't let them know in the meantime!!  WHAT THE HELLis going on tonight?!?!?!?!?  And noticed several of the other people who were seated after us were basically finishing up and leaving!  What about us?!?!?\\n\\nBy this time, my wife was furious and starving!  Stupid move, guys...\\n\\nThe food finally arrives and that most definitely calms her down.  I ordered the steak and mushroom pie featured on DDD.  Very good, but not worth the wait or the neglect of service.  The excuse was that the kitchen was backed up?  NOT!  Everyone else just got their stuff before us for some reason!  What up with that?!?\\n\\nMy wife tried out the oysters on toast.  The oysters were minuscule!  The small saving grace for my wife was the Yukon bacon.\\n\\nI tried their so-called custom coffee.  What a disappointment.  It's just diner brew.\\n\\nTwo more major fails to go guys, sorry for the lengthy write up.\\n\\nSo we're now at 2-hours in, and have finally finished our meals.  Time to so wash-up before we leave.  I go to the guys' washroom and upon opening the door, POOF, I run into a massive vapour cloud of paint thinner fumes!  The entire boys room is thick with the smell!  What is going on in here?!?!?  Gotta do my business and get outta here before the fumes eat my clothes!!\\n\\nI get back to my booth, and my wife noticed the oblivious manager holding a gallon-sized jug of paint thinner (or whatever gives off the same smell) with a rag!\\n\\nDUDE!  It's not even close to closing time - what are you doing with that stuff in the dining area especially during business hours???  And now that you've used the stuff (I don't know where he would need to use it in the first place), the place is starting to stink of it...Which sets off my wife since she hates that smell.  I tell her to go outside to get some fresh air while I get the bill.\\n\\nOK - time to finally go - let's get the bill...something that should arrive quicker than the meal, I hope!  OMG, it took like another 5 minutes and two asks to get the freaking bill!  The killer to that was, before I got my bill, all two waitresses and maybe two bus girls had to sing happy birthday to another table!  Man-o-man, what did I do to deserve this abuse???\\n\\nA manager who doesn't care about service is reflected in all this floor staff.

My chicken tenders were delicious with lightly breaded, seasoned breading. The fries were well seasoned and had a great crunch without being overcooked. I also ordered fried pickles and could tell they were made in house and fresh. Now, the sauces are the main event. My girlfriend and I tried 8 sauces total: special, donkey, moho lime, curry mayo, garlic parmesan, teriyaki, lemon pepper, and ranch. My favorite was the special sauce. If I go back and I'm ever torn between sauce choices, I would pay the .50 to add a sauce to my meal because they are the thing you would come back for after multiple visits. The reason for the 4-but-not-5 star review is the other side dish I tried, Mac and cheese. It truly seemed to be a pasta dish without the cheese added; bland, dry pasta with no flavor or cheesiness.

However, he credited the bill. \\n\\nMy daughter went to the restrooms and it smelled of urine and the floor was sticky. It was just very gross. In the \\"Midway\\" food/bar area, it was very unclean. Paper was everywhere and it smelled like pickles. There were used scattered glasses all over the bar. This place just had a very unclean appearance. We waited at the bar for 10 mins and no one helped us. We went to the first bar and the bartender made the wrong drink. I drunk it because her attitude wasn't friendly and I didn't wanna be confrontational. I just paid for two drinks. While sitting at the bar a man screamed, \\" I will blow this b**** up\\" because he was asked to leave. He was met outside by the Marietta Police Department. \\n\\nWe ordered the \\"Unlimited Play\\" meal deal. The food was good, minus the hair.

After waiting for 20 minutes the whole party showed up and I look at the floor and a table of 10 was very possible. I walk up to the person I told for the table and asked him why isn't the table still ready when it can easily be created. He said he is waiting for the table of two(only one person was eating) can finish eating so he can join the table. I showed him that he has two tables of six that he can turn around and create a table for us. It is not hard and I told him I called before hand and your restaurant does not want to take reservations. I told him this is why I called so you would be expecting everything. \\n\\nAfter teaching them on how to setup tables, we sat down and started to order and this is where it just went down hill. We ordered appetizers and they waiter informed us to order main course also and he will not bring it out until after the appetizers are done. Some of us ordered the main course and some were waiting until the appetizers came.\\n\\nSome appetizers came. Good food (not worth the service) we had to keep on calling someone who worked there to do their job. We called to get napkins. They just stacked 10 plates and silverware in the middle and you serve your self. No follow up. \\n\\nThe main course came and we were still missing some of the appetizers. They did not even take the appetizers plates away and were expecting us to move the plates for them so they can put down the dosa plates. I had to bring the guy out again and ask him where the other appetizers are and why did he bring the main course when the table still hasn't fully ordered all the main course. The waiter was lost completely. The whole staff was lost on how a restaurant service works. No type of service. We had to keep on asking for more water and more refills on side. The worst is not asking but you have to hunt someone down to help serve you if they don't remember to bring it to you. \\n\\nAfter 20-30 minutes we are still missing food, we got up and grabbed the waiter and told him what is going on. It's the same issue we had before and we gave the restaurant another chance. He apologized and the food showed up within a minute. Grant the owner still has not came to the table after all these complaints. We always had to grab management and finally the owner came. He was just as lost as the waiter. He said he is busy... And??? Busy does not mean you have one person running the whole floor. IT IS Saturday. You will be busy. No type of apologize from the owner, just walking away lost. \\n\\nOverall if the customer experience is horrible, the food does not matter like in this case. The service needs to be improved and the owner needs to be more engaged on the floor. Waiters need to be designated to certain tables so they can focus more.

I personally prefer darker beers and am not a big fan of very hoppy beers, not a lot of their beers were super hoppy. Tried the Figlet - ale refermented with Texas figs roasted at Franklin BBQ back in Austin - and was pleasantly surprised. Also got to try some of their gin barrel-aged beer and other refermented with grapes or honey, but I have to say the Figlet was a good start and definitely my favorite. I'm honestly not sure if I'd frequent Jester King for the beers simply because it's not something that I'm used to drinking. That being said, they do have good beers and I would love an opportunity to come back and try some more. \\n\\nThey also have a small kitchen serving pizzas and small sides, great for enjoying with your beer while you're enjoying the courtyard or under the roof. On a Friday evening, the pizza took some time, but they had a good system going. Pizza was delicious - had the Jard√≠n, Calabrese, and Turino. \\n\\nI would recommend Jester King to anyone looking to get a just a few steps outside of Austin to chill and relax. Come and try some unique beers, learn about the process, and just enjoy the Hill Country. There's tons of tables, super friendly employees, and also shade from umbrellas if you need it or heat lamps for the cold. And as is the trend with breweries these days, the place has areas to be both dog and kid friendly."},{"name":"Tinos Greek Cafe","address":"1201 Barbara Jordon","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Very pleased with this Tino's location!

We had never been before and everything else in Dublin was busy, so we thought we'd try it. The restaurant decor and building were lovely and, based on its appearance, I was looking forward to a great meal. We were seated quickly on a beautiful second floor patio. \\n\\nThings started to go downhill, however, when our server appeared. She asked for our drink orders and I asked her about a wine on their wine list thinking that she would understand (as most waiters would) that I was asking for a description of the wine. She responded by saying, \\"It's actually not that bad.\\" I was dumbfounded for a moment both because she seemed to assume that most of the wines on their list would be bad and this one was an exception and also because she offered such a limited response. I then asked for more detail, is it dry? sweet? fruity? She said, \\"It's kind of sweet and kind of dry too.\\" Hmmm. At this point I gave up and asked for her to come back after I had a few more minutes to look over the menu. \\n\\nWe decided to get a pitcher of white sangria. A little pricey at $32, but we assumed it was probably pretty good. Sadly, it was not. As she poured it into our glasses it reminded me of a favorite low-budget college drink - the Frescarita - made of, you guessed it, Fresca soda and cheap liquor. At the end of the pour one thin, anemic looking slice of strawberry plopped into the glass. No more fruit followed. A disconcerting cloudy pink color (think Crystal Light before it's been all the way shaken up) and cloyingly sweet, the beverage they served bore little or no resemblance to any white sangria I'd ever had before. There almost no wine or other liquor in it. I lived with the pink baby shower punch Mezzo calls sangria, and tried not to kick myself for spending $32 on a pitcher of sprite, crystal light, and frozen fruit all the while thinking the food would certainly make up for it all. \\n\\nAgain, we were disappointed. Bread arrived - three cold, slightly hard rolls. Then food. I had the Garganelli Alla Vodka and my husband had the salmon. He enjoyed his, although the portion was a bit small. Mine was mediocre - very oily vodka sauce, and a good flavored sausage with an unappetizingly tough casing. \\n\\nThe service, food and drinks just do not match the prices they charge nor the look of the restaurant.

If you can look past the sketchy and rundown surroundings -- it's next door to a Knights Inn -- you'll see that it wins in many categories from those other joints, especially at lunchtime.  Examples (at lunch):\\n\\n1.  Self-serve buffet.  You control what and how much goes on your plate.\\n2.  Value.  You can pay by the pound ($2.99/lb) or have all-you-can-eat ($6.55).\\n3.

I like that they have healthier vegetable options.\\n\\nA few notable observations about the food: the hot & sour soup is sufficiently spicy, the chicken wings are mighty tasty, and the Chinese doughnuts are delectably soft and sweet.\\n\\nThe restaurant seems to have a devoted following at lunchtime, which is good because it keeps the food from going stale.  The restaurant is small and lines can develop at the counter, but nothing terrible.  Take-out containers, plates, cups, and silverware are cheap and disposable.\\n\\nThe menu has over 100 selections and you'll be hard-pressed to find many items over $10.  The restaurant is run by a sweet Chinese family and the lady who interacts with customers is friendly and attentive.  Another good thing about China Cafeteria is it's open late.  Business hours are 10:30am-10:30pm, Monday-Thursday, and 10:30am-11:30pm, Friday-Saturday.  They are closed Sundays.\\n\\nOverall, I give China Cafeteria a solid 4 stars.

But one lazy Saturday morning my partner and I decided to stop playing a fun game of 'where do you wanna eat? I dunno.' And decided three things: we were gettin hangry, brunch spots were closing soon and we wanted fried chicken and biscuits. \\n\\nWe trekked into the heart of PCM and groaned slightly at the sight of a 15-20 person line at Hops. Plenty of sweaty, half-assed hand-holding and menu-flipping later we decided we would each get a drum-stick, a biscuit, share chicken tenders and a waffle. I tested out the chicken livers alone. We got our food and sat down to end our fast. The wait was surprisingly worth it - food was very cheap but definitely scratched our itch.\\n\\nOnly complaints would be that the chicken wasn't especially flavorful but not dull and that the drumstick was weirdly wet in the middle as if it had not been heated enough in the fryer or had been previously frozen and then thrown straight into the fryer.\\n\\nI will definitely be back.

You also can go combo platter for a bit cheaper and get fried rice and egg roll.\\n\\nAt the Rice Bowl there are no combo platters due to the large dining area other reviews mentioned so I get it.

Big chunks of what appeared to be white meat.  The sauce is thick and flavorful and I asked for semi spicy and it was more spicy then I was expecting.  The Rangoon was a bit above average in that im pretty sure the chunks of meat were real crab.\\n\\nSo for me it is good, but I don't see myself paying $19.00 for something that will be pretty good down the road and only cost me $12.00 unless I wish to dine in."},{"name":"Maurizios","address":"364 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I read the reviews and decided to go with family of two teens and two teen friends.

It's my new favorite breakfast drink. \\n\\nTo start we had biscuits and jam. I wanted more. Manymore. \\n\\nFor the entree my colleague and I decided to split since we were both having a hard time deciding. We got the turkey hash and the (bare with me on the name) dickle pickle chicken wiffle. You should come here and eat it. It was phenomal. The chicken was moist, the breading perfect, the syrup flavorful and the waffle was a good base. Only thing I wished was for the waffle to be warm \\"hot off the press\\" when it got to the table. Otherwise a perfect ten in my book. The turkey hash was great too. Good flavor a and fresh ingredients but it wasn't as memorable as the former, obviously with a name like that. \\n\\nOur server also helped us take a great group photo and was crazy nice about it.

As I was driving along, I saw a restaurant that had intrigued me but I never took a chance on. So seeing as though i was about to plop down a significant amount on a car I might as well 'spoil' myself and get a burger as well. Since that faithful first, I've gone back to 5 guys as much as i could and i've never been disappointed. \\n\\nWalking into Five Guys you'll be greeted by the fragrant aroma of grease, searing bovine and fries, which is my favorite next to new car smell (which unfortunately has dissipated already). The menu is relatively simple. You basically order a base burger (Little or regular, cheese or no cheese) and add whatever toppings you want off a list. The list prolli includes about 20-25 items ranging from sauces (ketchup, mustard, mayo, etc) to toppings (jalapenos, tomatoes, etc). If its your first time at 5 guys take note of the the toppings highlighted in red. These are the most common toppings... Usually i get everything highlighted in red and then add jalapenos (fresh not canned). Also there aren't any meals like at a McD's or a BK . so everything is ordered ala cart (seperately). \\n\\nBesides their burgers they have really good fries if you like a little kick to them get the cajun fries. There are two sizes to the fries as well regular and large. If you're looking to feed 2 (good portion of fries) or 3 (conservative portion) then get the regular. Large fries would be around 3-4 depending on how much you love fries. One interesting thing they do at 5 guys is the way they serve the fries. Now i just want you to take a moment and think about one of the first things you do when you get drive thru or even eat-in at say McD's. Besides take a sip of your drink you always grab a fry, but not from the box u grab it from the bag, why? Cuz these are open game as far as anyone is concerned. Playing off this notion 5 guys not only fills the fry container to the brim with fries but you'll also get a good portion of 'additional' fries in the bag. \\n\\nOverall for 2 people I usually get outta 5 guys with minimal hit on my credit about $14-15 depending on what is ordered which is usually two regular burgers, 1-2 drinks (depending if the gf is mad at me or not) and a regular cajun fry. This is definitely not your avg McD's so if you go in expecting a $1 menu u can go ahead and walk back out. But if you're looking for a good burger for a decent price and also All you can eat peanuts... then there's no place like Five Guys.

We also got sides of the street corn and fried yuca, but always contemplated with the maduros since they come out to perfection with the right crunch and caramelization to them!\\n\\nI loved this place from the first time I came, but with the other amazing options around town it's hard to come back here from time to time.

I will not be coming here again for numerous reasons.\\n\\n1. It took them 25 minutes to cook me an order of their chicken teriyaki plate. That's an absurd amount of time to cook it.. especially when it wasn't that busy and I was told it would only take a few minutes.\\n\\n2. They put WAYYY to much sauce on it. The rice was drenched in the sauce and it took away the tastes of everything because it was so overpowering. I'm not even kidding when I say it was like eating soup instead of a rice plate.. that's how much sauce they put on it.\\n\\n3. When they're cooking more than one serving, they cook numerous orders together. In my case.. four orders were being cooked simultaneously with all the meats and vegetables being mixed together for four separate orders. This does not work because all the orders were not portioned correctly.\\n\\nSo when he started to put the stir fry on the rice plates.. some got more meat than others. In my case, I got way less meat than I thought I would and I only found out after getting home. If I'm paying over 7 dollars for a plate of food.. I expect a lot more meat than what I was actually served. I would've been better off just ordering from the already prepared sections. That was the biggest issue I had with this instance.\\n\\nI like the food, I really do but this experience really soured my views on this establishment and I won't be coming here again bc of it."},{"name":"Clutch Prime Sausagery","address":"230 NW Lost Springs Ter, Ste 22","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"My wife and I went there for the first time today and loved it.

Why do i say this?  read on.   ----- First example - I order a LG pizza with extra cheese. I get the pizza without extra cheese. I call the place, the employee mentions it to the owner while i'm on the phone (which i can hear him denying it out loud), finally he comes to the phone and accepts that i ordered extra cheese, and promises that next order i will get extra cheese on the pizza.- Mind you, i paid for the extra cheese.  I should have written a review that time, and written the business off right then and there. Only reason why i didn't is because there are no pizza places close by, and their pizza tastes good.-----Second example - I call and order a pizza -  I was told that it would be 45 minutes to be ready.  I show up to pick up the pizza 45 minutes later. I ask the owner for the pizza, he gestures to the employee, she said it hadn't been made yet. Owner downplays it, and starts ringing up pizza. I told him to forget the pizza. In other words i was told pizza would be ready in 45 minutes. i leave, arrive then am told it will be another 30 minutes because they forgot to process my order. That 2nd time i should have written a review, and written the place off. I didn't because the pizza tastes good.----Today i go on their website and notice there is a coupon for $3 off a large pizza w/2 toppings. I call the place, and speak to the owner again. He tells me that the coupon is expired, but i can order two pizzas with a coke or some other offers.   There is no expiration date whatsoever on the coupon at the website. This was the last straw, and here is the review.-------It is a shame, because the pizza tastes good. I remember the first time i showed up he started raising his voice at me because i went straight to use the restroom assuming I went to his restaurant to only use the bathroom.

I agreed but it took over 20 minutes to get it and I ended up drinking about half. After he brought my card back and I signed the check, I set the half full glass on top of the check.

It was authentic and delicious! When fried food is done this well, there is no need for any sort of sauce to dip it in - it holds its own and this is a fine example.\\n\\nOur main dish was a prawn & arugula plate which was perfect in every way. There were plenty of prawns - crunchy & tender, a wafting of garlic, and a deft hand when it came to putting all the components together. Bravo!

For Valentine's or our anniversaries this has been our place. Tonight I surprised my wife and asked her out for dessert to celebrate her getting the job she has been working towards for more than a year. I called ahead and made reservations.

Since she offered I opted for the dining room. When we arrived we checked in and they \\"suggested\\" the lounge instead. We asked if we could still have dining room and they gave us no verbal reply instead simply guiding us to our seat. The issues started with the waiter. He was very visibly not happy we had been seated in his area. Standard drill for lesser establishments. Tying up a 4 top etc for a couple not getting the works. After very short unsmiling introductions he walked straight to the hostess stand and very visibly gave an earful to the gentleman who I had spoken with upon first arriving. Several dark glances our way and now the lady who had sat us was looking our way too. We had been completely nice to everyone and were there to be happy and celebrate my wife. Instead we were made to feel exceptionally uncomfortable by the worst waiter I've ever had the displeasure of encountering. Absolutely not the down to earth and friendly service we had before and that had drawn us back. I don't say this lightly, and it pains me but we will not be back.

The nice hostess quoted me 1.5 hours but our table was eventually ready after 45 minutes of wait. Score! When I got in, I saw a very industrial, modern place. I loved the different maps on the walls and bottles of wine on the shelves. Lots of seating around the place, we happened to the an end table and loved it! Our server was on point. I can't remember her name but she had a massive bun and glasses. She was so sweet and so accommodating. Great personality too, which made our experience that much better. Here's what we had:\\n\\n-Erin's Sweet Biscuits for $6. Served with a huckleberry compote. OH-EM-GEE! This was the best thing since sliced bread! You get 3 small biscuits smothered in the compote. The biscuits were warm, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and buttery. It was so good, I wanna go back just for that! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\\n\\n-North African Sausage for $11, served over a bed of couscous, cauliflower with an over easy egg. The sausage was flavorful and salty, loved the egg but didn't really get the couscous. I think it could've done without. Still flavorful overall. \\n\\n-Shaksuka for $12 and added the merguez sausage for an extra $2. It was a baked eggs and tomato stew. This was different than I'm used to for brunch but I LOVED IT! Loved that all the components seemed to mesh very well! \\n\\n-Pork Cutlets for $13, on a bed of braised spinach and topped with over easy egg. LOVED IT TOO! The cutlets were so crispy and flavorful, ON-POINT! Loved the lemon sauce on the bottom and loved that you can just add egg and call it breakfast!\\n\\n-Steak and Cheddar Eggs for $16, sits on a bed of scrambled eggs, cheese and cornmeal cake. OH-EM-GEE, what an amazing dish! The steak was PERFECTLY seasoned and cooked to a medium rare temp, loved that cornmeal cake, sweet and savory at the same time. YOU NEED TO GET THIS DISH!!!\\n\\n-Potatoes Bravas for $7. The value is definitely here. This was our biggest dish, even though it was a side. Lots of crispy seasoned potatoes with an over easy egg on top. Over easy egg seems to be the theme but I'm not complaining!\\n\\n-Mellow Mule for $9. Mellow corn whiskey, lemon, cock n bull ginger beer, angostura and srappy's lime bitters. I love that I could have a mule and not have vodka! This was so good, and it contained whiskey. I'm in heaven!\\n\\nOh man, the only problem with this place is that there isn't a place like it in San Francisco! I want to go back to Portland just for this! If you're ever in this city, you need to get your butt down there.

As for the margarita...it was the most disappointing. It tasted like margarita flavored water. A waiter, not my own, came to finally ask me if I was done. I got the chips and salsa to go but told him I didn't like the rice. He looked at me and kept it pushing hunny. No I'm sorry or nothing.

The only place I had been to for this is Hei La Moon. I decided to go on trusty yelp to see if there was another place to try and found that Windsor Dim Sum Cafe had a solid 4 star rating, and decided to give it a go.\\n\\nMy group was a party of 10, slated to arrive at 10:30am. My friend and I were first to arrive around 10:15. We made our way up the stairs (along with a few other people, meaning it's a small stair area and got crowded quick!), and told our hostess that we were expecting a party of 8 (I forgot a few people, oops!). She asked if we were all there and we told her that we were expecting them around 10:30ish. She said that since it gets crowded, we might have to share the table. Looking around the restaurant, they had about maybe 10-12 tables, so we told her we understood. \\n\\nSince it's a small place, we asked her if it'd be ok that we wait for our friends outside as not to crowd the restaurant. She said sure, so outside we went. A few minutes later, the hostess came out and told us that the table will be ready soon. Cool! A few minutes after that she said that she could set us if we had a few more people arrive. Even cooler! Two more friends came, but my friend's girlfriend came by so he jumped in her car to help her look for parking. Once a few more people came, we went in and the hostess sat us immediately.\\n\\nThe last set to arrive were also looking for parking, so 8 of us were at the table, patiently awaiting them. The employees were also very patient and did not pressure us to order while we waited.\\n\\nWe decided to get the ball rolling while we waited for the last 2, and realized that there are no carts here. The place is just too tiny to have them go from table to table. Instead, they provide menus (with pictures) and a long ordering sheet. Similar to how one would order sushi, there were #s and descriptions with a space to order what you wanted. I started asking for orders and it felt like we were playing bingo. \\"Can I get a #16!?\\" \\" How about 3 #8's?\\" We definitely had fun with it.\\n\\nOnce we placed our order, our items trickled in slowly, but then just kept coming. We had a vegetarian at the table and she had a good variety to choose from. Assorted Veggie dumplings, Chinese broccoli (although I think that had oyster sauce...), rice rolls, buns with various fillings, and dessert: there was something for everyone.\\n\\nMy friend wanted a specific dessert and tried to order it in Chinese. The employee was very patient and tried to understand what she wanted. She was looking for a dessert with yellow filling. The employee said two fit that criteria, saying one had a more yolk-like filling and the other was more paste-like. We ended up getting them both just to see what they were. We all appreciated their attentiveness.\\n\\nWhen the bill came, for the 24 items we selected, (most were priced around $3.15), it came out to about $94! For ease of payment we all pitched in $11, though looking back I should have added a few more bucks. As we left, the hostess cheerfully said bye and thank you.

We then drank some tea and waited for our waiter...a few of them were walking by, but none of them came to our booth, nor did they give us eye contact. We felt like we didn't exist in this place. At first it was quite comical, but after 20 minutes of absolutely no service and acknowledgment, we decided to just get up and leave! Horrible. I told the hostess at the front who sat us that we'll never be back because we were never even served. If I could give this place 0 stars, I would!!!

They come topped with corn, tomato, lettuce cheese and a spicy Korean sauce (tho it's not really spicy at all).  The beef is chopped (not ground),  was marinated well and wasn't just bland.  I'll definitely get more of these.\\n\\nThe lemon pepper wings were a larger size, but I think it was due more to the breading.  The lemon pepper seasoning wasn't very overpowering and the wings were crispy.  My only gripe is they don't make/have blue cheese dressing, and they forgot to put in my ranch dressing.  Still, decent wings.\\n\\nThe KFC wings (Korean Fried Chicken) come covered with a Hot and Spicy sauce that's slightly sweet (again, not really that spicy), and I liked these much more than the lemon pepper wings!  Very crispy, decently sized and tasty.\\n\\nThe only thing I wasn't a huge fan of were the K fries, which on their own are $4, but they will allow you to sub them for your regular fries.  K fries are listed as spicy, and to their credit, they're powdered with a legitimately spicy powder and a spicy dipping sauce (almost a spicy ketchup).  The problem is while the heat is there, the season is not.  Salt helps, but I kinda expected them to be seasoned as well as spiced.\\n\\nK BBQ Taco has no parking space on its own, and you'll have to park at a meter, or wherever you find parking in Decatur.  Again, it's a very small restaurant, but you can eat here, but there's a space premium.\\n\\nCustomer service is excellent, as they were more than happy to go over every item I asked about.\\n\\nIf you've had Korean/Mexican fusion foods in the past, K BBQ Taco won't let you down.

Instead look for the large phallic sign that reads hung far lo. Follow its suggestion to the door below, through a curtain and *Ping* you're in. There you'll discover a dining room surrounded by soft lighting, natural woods and frosted windows that give some visible protection. \\n\\nMy first time was with friends, we decided to sample several of their small plates. Suddenly a steady stream of street food was fired at our table. Out came steamed pork buns, lamb satay, boar skewers, quail eggs wrapped in bacon and even Kobe beef served sizzling on a salt rock. Everything was very tasty but I thought the portions could have been better for the price. Next I diverted my attention toward my pick from the online menu, ramen with bouncy pork. Bouncy pork I thought? I don't discriminate the pig so I had to add this action versed one to my repertoire immediately. What I discovered was that I don't care if it bounces, springs, twists, or lies flat, this pork filled soup kicks ass! Of course it partly kicked my ass too because I decided to add pickled serranos and Thai chiles without testing the broths heat first. Regardless of my intense sniffling and sweating the ramen was affordable and delicious! So tell me how could anyone not give this pleasure palace of pork purification any less than 4 stars? I suppose if you don't favor savoring several succulent, salty, pork plates you probably wouldn't. I however am not that individual. In fact last there I ate nothing but pig and when it came time for dessert I asked if it had swine in it! \\n\\nActually I did skip dessert but the manager Damian, my buddy from Ten01, told me it was his goal to add even more pork to the menu ... that folks is SWEET enough!!! He then informed me I should have tried the fried pork shank because he considers it the best thing on the menu. Fried..(drool)..pork..(drool)..shank..(napkin)..you say? How did you let me miss this? I thought we were friends! My very next visit I was brimming with anticipation, I sat down and said \\"Hello, skip the water, just serve me up that fried pork shank please!\\" During my exasperating wait I consumed a few pints of a Rogue Morimoto ale that's specially made available to them. One that is crisp but with a nutty, complex, malt profile that finishes dry. Ok, say whatever you will about the location, service or other food because all else pales in comparison to this uber crispy, tender, juicy, fried pork leg! The skin has an assertive snap, crackle, and pop while the meat cries salty tears for your enjoyment. Its served simply garnished with cilantro, a chile infused lime sauce, pork broth and side of jasmine rice. A combination I now lay dreaming about once my head hits the pillow. The chile sauce is a deliciously tart, acidic, spicy blend of simple ingredients that help push the meat to heat envelope. And do I really need to say anything about pork broth? I didn't think so. \\n\\nThis prolific dish pushed me to a new pork pace, its power pacifying my mouth like a padlock. Seriously, after the first bite my order was the last anyone heard from me. Instead all that bellowed were noises of pleasure followed by long, quite pauses, as I showed off my talent to destroy pork, effortlessly.  Whenever I am near Old Town all I can think about is my precious, my pork plated companion.

We have foodie friends that thought this was their best meal ever!  We wanted to go, but really, $75 per person with another $35 for wine parings is a bit steep.  Don't get me wrong, we eat at the best restaurants in Portland so that's not too much for the best meal ever, but I was a bit skeptical.   We monitored their web site to see what each week's menu held.  This past week we saw the Lemon Tart with Huckleberry meringue dessert and decided now is the time.  We made our reservation for Friday night.  Reservations require a credit card and if you cancel within 48 hours of your reservation, you will be charged $75 per person.  That's the cost of each dinner. OUCH!\\n\\nWe arrived on time and were seated.  We opted for the wine pairings to go with dinner.  We sat with other foodies which enhanced the experience greatly.  Everyone near us had been anxiously anticipating dinner.  The dining area is very small, only 24 diners at a time. The noise level was pretty loud, although we could hear each other.  Each course was delivered and explained, however, our server spoke so quietly that we asked her to repeat herself after each announcement. \\n\\nThe First Course: Wild Water Cress and Spring Leek Veloute, with Chive Oil and Warm Gougeres.  The soup was amazing, very smooth and creamy.  The Gougeres was okay, a little dry.  \\n\\nThe Charcuterie:  The Steak Tartar was absolutely the best.  The flavor and the toast was awesome, but the rest of the plate fell flat.  The Fois Gras bonbon on the Peanut Shortbread with Sauternes Gelee, had too many flavors to notice any of them.  Too bad, Fois is one of my favorite things.  The Chicken Liver Mousse was very flat, but the Leaf Lard Cracker was very interesting.  The House Cured Hazelnut finished Pork as okay as were the Pork Rillettes.  The Smoked Duck breast was nothing special.\\n\\nMain Course:  Buffalo Striploin Roast was very good, well prepared and medium rare.  The Hedgehog mushroom & Veal Jus cream was very good.  Tasty, balanced, well seasoned.  The Wild Nettle Pasta with fresh Local Sheeps Milk cheese was also tasty.\\n\\nSalad:  Tossed greens, these were fresh, but nothing special.\\n\\nCheese Plate: The cheese selected were okay, but not anything special.  The Armagnac Plum was good, crackers okay.\\n\\nDessert:  Lemon Tart with Huckleberry Meringue was okay.  The tart was very small, so you tasted very little lemon, mostly pastry.  The meringue was good, but so delicate that the strong flavors from the mixed berry coulis overpowered the meringue.\\n\\nThe Wine Pairings were down right AWFUL. Every single glass distracted from the flavors of the food.  I didn't finish a single selection.\\n\\nAs I'm writing this, I'm hearing an repeating theme, it was nothing special.  Such a disappointment.  We had high hopes, perhaps too high after reading other's reviews and listening to friends and family that have been there.

Unfortunately, it affects the flavor/heaviness of the dish. \\n\\nIn addition, the BC isn't the value proposition it once was. The fajitas are now $15 and did not include many tortillas.

That being said, that didn't keep it from filling up quickly for the lunch hour.\\n\\nWe lucked out and scored the last padded booth in the bar section. We ordered some glasses of white wine and our lunches - the Hachis Parmentier, \\"a French shepherd's pie,\\" for me and the poached eggs and bacon frisee salad for her. Our waitress was a bit AWOL after that; she never asked if we wanted bread, but rather a different server who brought out our food asked then if we'd like bread. Well, I would've wanted it before the meal, but oh well. She never checked in with us to make sure everything was okay, but rather asked when she dropped off the check. Maybe they felt a bit stressed at the lunch hour - I noticed the gentlemen sitting next to us had a really hard time getting their server's attention - but I would think they could've ironed out those kinks by now, or at least recognized that operating an express lunch in the middle of downtown would need more staff.\\n\\nThe food was okay. My shepherd's pie was mainly mashed potatoes - buttery and cheesy mashed potatoes, but potatoes nonetheless. I wish it had had more meat in it, or even veggies, or gravy. But maybe that's the French bit? My mom loved her salad, and the crispy poached eggs were divine.

Time absolutely flew by while we were here! We decided to eat first of course. My friends ordered the sliders and I ordered boneless buffalo wings. They practically cleaned their plates because the sliders were so good! I enjoyed my wings, but I do wish they had less breading and more chicken. All in all, a delicious meal. \\nNow for our arcade experience. I love the game card feature that they use at D&B. Much more practical than the coins I used as a child haha. They have plenty of machines to reload your card with more chips too, which I appreciate. After about two hours of playing various games, my friends and I racked up quite a few tickets (which also get stored on your card). They had some pretty great prizes but we all chose to save our tickets for another day in order to accumulate more.

The girl, ( Love?) who brought our food out (there were 3 checks so 3 different trays) just plopped the one down without saying anything. She did this times to the same person every time. Mine was missing the slaw. I asked her right away but she just turned away. So I called after her again. She turned around with such attitude and lack of caring.

We shared the fried chicken sandwich and the pulled chicken sandwich with sweet & spicy Cole slaw and fries as the sides. \\n\\nThe fried chicken was moist and perfectly fried, but it also had lettuce and tomato which added a contrast to it. On the other hand, while it tasted good, the pulled chicken was on the dryer side and it was only chicken on a bun (which the waitress warned us about). I would have loved some other element on the sandwich like cole slaw.  For the sides, the fries were addicting and I couldn't stop eating them. The cole slaw was good but not the best I've had.

We ordered all grilled tenders, and it was noted on the bag. When we received our order, they were all fried tenders. No big deal...I brought it up to the counter and they told me they would make new ones and it would be awhile, but they would make sure to bring me grilled tenders when they were done. Thirty minutes later, we went up to the counter to check... no one had any idea what we were talking about. The manager ended up just handing us grilled tenders finally.

The food has always been a little sketchy and the management could use a lesson or two from the Dale Carnegie school. After this last carry-out order, we WILL NOT BE BACK! Our order consisted of 2 egg rolls, an order of rumaki and 2 orders of chicken almond ding. The egg rolls, consisted mostly of cabbage. Very bland. The livers in the rumaki were so overcooked and dry, that I practically coughed up a lung trying to swallow them. The chicken almond ding, was SWIMMING in a pool of flavorless sauce. There were about 3 pea pods, a few pieces of white chicken meat, what I assume was chopped bok choy stems and slivered almonds. In their favor, they did give us extra almond slivers. But, then they gave us a container of rice, that was good enough for about half of our entr√©e. When we have dined in at Rice Bowl, they never seem to give us enough rice and they charge you for extra. This is the only Asian restaurant, that when I've ordered extra rice, they have charged me for it. Another thing that has bothered me in the past at Rice Bowl, is that entree's that I have had at other Asian restaurants, are prepared differently at \\"The Bowl\\".

The Kung Pao was excellent, just spicy enough, chicken pieces were small bite size pieces instead of having to take a few bites out of a bigger piece. Plenty of peanuts and veggies mixed in and on the side that complemented the plate nicely. The Nenas chicken was awesome! Served in a half pineapple shell with amazing flavor. Chunks of pineapple mixed with vegetables and shrimp in an excellent coconut sauce. Absolutely delicious.\\n\\nOur food was served fast because we showed up at 1120 at night and they close at 12 so everything was quick.

This area is a rather industrial looking business center that is home to lots of hidden treasures. Unfortunately this sushi restaurant is one that should probably just stay hidden. Yikes- that sounds harsh, but our experience tonight was very disappointing. \\n\\nFrom the outside, the restaurant's appearance seems to promise a trendy and lively atmosphere, but once inside it delivers a very dull, slate gray interior that lacks charm and character. The restaurant has an odd flow with two dining areas separated by the front lobby/hostess area. A large bar sits awkwardly to the left as you enter the restaurant, while a few booths lurk behind it in the darkness. \\n\\nThe menu consists of both sushi and standard Japanese cuisine. Upon entering we were asked, no wait...not asked, more like encouraged to choose the \\"All You Can Eat\\" menu. This option costs $23.95 for dinner per person. I was here for the sushi tonight, but knew \\"All I Could Eat\\" was about $15.00 worth. Therefore, I requested the regular menu as did my friend. They insisted we take both menus. We discovered both menus are the same, only one lists entree prices and the other does not. It seemed to be a somewhat confusing system. I'm sure the \\"AYCE\\" option would be ideal for some, but I just cannot eat that much food at once (I know - hard to believe) especially sushi, assuming I'm not packing a doggie bag. \\n\\nOur server was dull, reserved, and performed his duties without going above and beyond. He gave us a few minutes to study the menus and returned to see if we decided on the \\"AYCE\\" option. Our answer was still no. At this point I felt they were trying hard to up-sell this meal option and that was a real turn off for me. \\n\\nThe food arrived and it was decent, but average sushi at best. In Maki Maki's defense I recently had some fantastic sushi (see prior reviews) that set the bar high. The Rainbow Maki here deserves honorable mention and the Tuna Maki was just okay. I found it odd that there was no ginger or wasabi on the plate. Perhaps these important counterparts are only offered to those who pay $23.95? \\n\\nThe server never returned to ask how our meals were.  He did, however, come over to ask if he could take my plate as I was still in mid-bite of my last piece of sushi - awkward!

I live in the area and consider myself a foodie and love Latin cuisine from the globe. I dropped in on this 3rd visit under durest because my friend, fellow foodie chef and blogger wanted a margarita & I thought this couldn't be too bad  so we sat at the bar and ordered the 3 Amigos and a house margarita.  Now I said this was my 3rd visit. The first time I brought my daughter also a die hard taco fan for a quick bite. We sat at a table and waited and extrordinarily long time for service especially since the place was bare. When the waitress came to our table she was rude and curt and seemed upset when I asked for napkins that were not on the table. Wow. OK we ordered a taco can't remember exactly what it was since it was a couple of years prior, but we had decided that it definitely wouldn't be a place we would not return to as it was clear we weren't welcomed and plus the tacos were just blah. My 2nd visit was with another friend who used bribery to get me to return.  She wanted a lengua taco and those can be hard to come by in the city. Again the service was poor. Don't want to say it was race based, but we are in Atlanta so I didn't order. I refuse to give my $$$ where I'm not wanted. She loved her lengua taco and we went along our way. Saying the service  was poor is being polite. OK so back to the 3 Amigos and House Margarita. The 3 Amigos : guacamole, salsa Fresca y queso fresco was served with chips that I assume we're prepared in house and probably the day prior were stale. The guacamole was full of \\"strings\\" & brown indicative of old overly ripe avocados was laced with chopped  tomatoes,onion and cilantro which was also propably a batch from the previous days prep and someone forgot to throw out & a little salt (odd cause it was happy hour time on a Friday ) anyway, I promptly pushed that to the back no need to nosh on brown pop being passed of as guac, the salsa was a puree better yet a slurry of off season under ripe tomatoes onions and cilantro also no salt yuk. I immediately concluded that they must make their money off the bar. I did say we sat at the bar right?  Now I thought  that least sitting at the bar would offer us more prompt and friendly service, I  mean we right there! At the bar in your face...nope! My friend who is a margarita efficionado of sorts started in on her drink to wash the salsa fresca from her palate was met immediately with a bitter bite, the fresh lime juice used to make the margarita was overpowered by the pith from the lime, the waitress didn't apologize when she asked about the make up of the drink and hesitantly prepared another drink on the menu that was made with grapefruit which was a much better drink. The save of the day was the queso dip. Can't go wrong with melted cheese. Well I'm not so sure. Maybe at Holy Taco you can if u catch them on a bad day like my friend did who I joined on this 3rd visit and I ain't NEVER stepping foot back in an establishment that can't even give me decent service at the bar! It must be most of their guests have never had any authentic tacos or guacamole idk cause when my friend ask to speak with someone about her experience she was quickly written off with \\"people come in here all the time  and I have never had a complaint!\\"  Really?

So look out for my newest hashtag #notholytaco if you want to know where to get some good eats here in the metro Atlanta area. And if your in the neighborhood and craving for a decent margaritas just keep walking up Glenwood toward Moreland Ave and there is another little Latin fusion restaurant on the same side of the street anoit 2 blocks up that has awesome guacamole and bomb pitchers of margaritas!

By common rock club standards, everything that made that show awesome (besides the drunken rockstar antics that made GBV one of the greatest indie bands of my time) was courtesy of the people running the show: the sound was skillfully mixed and made each guitar solo shine like a beacon in the shroud Bob Pollard's boozy fog, the bartender was quick and skilled in the art of draft pulling, and the stage couldn't have been construct more perfectly. And yes, the security guards could not have given two shits about the balls-to-the-wall behavior of my friends and I as we showed up a good three hours before the show to get in \\"the zone\\" for what we anticipated to be one of our finest moments in rock fandom.

What a hurtful and disappointing experience.\\n\\nTLDR: The manager, Maria, confiscated my friend's and my REAL ID even though we are in fact over 21.  My friend and I both have flights in the morning, and she refused to give us our IDs after watching a Youtube video on fake IDs in the back room and because she said we gave \\"vibes\\" that we were using fake IDs. In the end, we had to call 911 to request a dispatch to help us recover our legal and valid IDs.\\n\\nBecause of the manager's actions (her name is Maria), my friends and I were forced to report her by calling 911. If you call the Zone 5 Atlanta Police Department, you can get the full call record. The police came and had to talk to her on our behalf. What kind of establishment hires managers like Maria, who forces customers to have no choice but to call the police?\\n\\nThe night began when my girlfriends and I came in for a drink this Thursday (Aug. 17, 2017) around 11:30pm, hoping to just sit down and have a drink for girls' night. Two of us are from out of town, and actually grew up in the same area within Illinois. Apparently, this seemed suspect to the bartender/manager, Maria, who took our IDs and asked us to sit tight while she verified them.\\n\\nHaving been out of college for a while now, we were surprised, but understood that a verification of our IDs would be quick. THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. In fact, after leaving us for 45 minutes unserved at the bar SHE REFUSED TO GIVE US BACK OUR REAL IDs. She said \\"You will have to leave these IDs with us tonight. Come back tomorrow. We will not serve you here.\\" She made additional comments that we had \\"been drinking\\" - which is so uncalled for and rude. Ironically, we had not had a drink yet and that is why we visited Little Trouble in the first place. \\n\\nMy friend and I both had flights in the morning (Aug. 18, 2017) and could not leave without our IDs. We asked her on what grounds she was withholding them. She said the font of our IDs was slightly off. In fact, subjective opinions on font type do not warrant withholding of IDs. That's why holograms and barcodes appear on IDs - to help with validation of authenticity. Instead she stood her ground that \\"something just isn't right\\". It's unfair that the manager who did not have the skill set to determine the validity of our IDs, was going to cost us over $900 in missed flights. \\n\\nWe called different Atlanta Zone police departments, and were directed to dial 911 to request a dispatch of an officer to come to Little Trouble. While we waited for the officers, she returned our IDs to us and asked us to leave and that she would not serve us. She even had on-duty security guard escort us, which was so disrespectful and unnecessary. \\n\\nWe waited outside for the officers who SCANNED OUR IDs WITH POLICE GRADE EQUIPMENT VALIDATING OUR IDs - THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY VERIFIED. The officer went inside to discuss with Maria, who, upon seeing the officer, said \\"I love pretty girls. I'd love them to help promote my business. I hope they do come back again.\\" If she genuinely felt that way, she would not have been so rude to begin with. Additionally she told the officer that SHE WATCHED A YOUTUBE VIDEO TO HELP HER DETERMINE OUR IDs' VALIDITY. How can a manager of a restaurant/bar be so uninformed that she must watch a Youtube video?\\n\\nIn fact, it is against the law for restaurants/bars to withhold a legal document (including valid IDs), without evidence-based reasoning for why it may be fake. One Youtube video is not evidence. BEWARE OF THIS UNPROFESSIONAL AND POORLY RUN ESTABLISHMENT. It's not worth the hassle."},{"name":"No 9 Restaurant","address":"812-5300 No 3 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"Fist time come here .

They had 4 types of biriyani's and I liked the chef's special biriyani and the goat biriyani. Didn't like other two (my personal choice). My daughter (7yrs old) had some chicken biriyani and she was good with it. My son (4yrs old), just took a plate, but didn't fill anything as he was not in a mood to eat anything. My wife just gave him couple of small (very small) pieces of chicken from her plate. He just ate one and didn't eat the other piece as it was spicy for him. After the food, we asked for the check and they've charged for my son as well. Then I went and told the waiter who brought the check, that my son didn't eat anything except for those two pieces.

But tonight was a snowy night, and I didn't get into town until all the museums and such were closed, so I decided to check out Chinatown as my first Boston stop.  Before I left home, I had checked out how Yelpers had rated all the Chinese/dim sum restaurants in Boston.  Winsor attracted my attention, not only because it was well-rated, but because the dim sum was made to order (!), on the menu all day (!!) and available for takeout (!!!).  But once I entered the restaurant, I decided to eat in.  There were empty tables (at 8pm on a Saturday) and I didn't think takeaway dim sum could survive the chilly T ride back to the hostel.\\n\\nI ordered three dishes, reasonably priced at $2.75/dish.  First to arrive was the shrimp in rice noodle with cilantro and oyster sauce.  I don't usually order shrimp, but this was SO GOOD.  In fact, my other two dishes, though also delicious, were somewhat anticlimactic.  Next were the steamed pork and peanut dumplings, which didn't seem to have a ton of peanut flavor - or pork flavor, for that matter.  I probably wouldn't order them again, but only because there were so much other dim sum that sounded good.  Last was the rolled bean curd with pork.  At least, I think it was pork.  I tend to get distracted by quality bean curd, to the exclusion of everything else on the plate.  And with bean curd this good, the filling is almost beside the point.\\n\\nService was speedy.  The rice noodle shrimp was brought out maybe 2-3 minutes after I ordered it.  The waiter brought the other two dishes out to me almost immediately after I finished the prior dish. I'm not sure if they usually serve dim sum in sequence or if that was just a coincidence.  I like the ordering system where the customers mark their choices on a card, which cuts out the risk of orders getting jumbled by the language barrier. I also liked being able to know how much my bill would be before I paid it, which is not always the case with dim sum. The decor is standard Chinese restaurant, though not too gaudy.

There has been a lot of buzz about this place since the start of construction and it was great to finally see it realized. Cask & Larder bills itself as a Southern Public House.\\n\\nOne of the most interesting features of Cask & Larder is that they have their own brewery inside. Master beer brewer and certified Cicerone Ron Raike is the Brewmaster at Cask & Larder and judging from the beer menu it's something to be very excited about. I tried the Black Cyprus Brown beer which is a dark & rich ale brewed with English oats (ABV: 5.0% IBU: 19). It was mild but with just the right amount of bubbles. Some other beers that caught my eye were The Ravenous Red\\nbrewed in partnership with Green Room from Jacksonville. The Ravenous Red is an American red ale brewed with ruby red grapefruit, Hamlin oranges & coriander (ABV: 4.9% IBU: 32) & The Olde Southern Wit a Belgian style wheat beer brewed with coriander, citrus zest, & other spices (ABV: 4.8% IBU: 13). It's going to be exciting to be able to go in regularly and try Ron's newest beer creations.\\n\\nThe layout of Cask & Larder is pretty similar to the previous incarnation of this location when it was The Boathouse and before that O'boys, but the all new decor really makes it something special. It was nice to see the antique bottles on the beam way above the dining area survived the remodel from the previous places. The one big difference to the space is the doors that lead out to the parking lot, which were where most people used to enter from, are not longer used and you must enter through the front doors on Fairbanks. I think many patrons last night found this very confusing so I'm sure they'll add a sign.\\n\\nWe sat at the oyster bar which was a great spot to watch all the action. Turns out sitting at the oyster bar was perfect because our old friend Bruno was behind the bar shucking oysters and we also got to see the pastry chef perform her magic on the desserts, watch the staff work the hand cranked ham slicer and even interact with Chef & Owner James Petrakis.\\n\\nService is slightly awkward at the oyster bar because the servers come behind you and the seating is a little tight, it would make more sense to me to be served from the oyster bar itself but I can see where that would be logistically complicated for the staff because of the large glass wall that sits at eye level.\\n\\nOne thing that we found a bit odd was the prices on the menu when we arrived were changed, many items were at least 2 dollars higher in price than the menu we found online. I guess we can chalk it up to opening day glitches but just be aware the prices on their online menu may not be the same you will find in the restaurant. They should probably just have a general sample menu online without the prices to avoid any confusion.\\n\\nWe started off with some James River Smoked Oysters from the bar that were served over a bed of rock salt & topped with a Vidalia Onion Relish. They were served with an in house made Serrano hot sauce that was thick, spicy and had a great flavor.\\n\\nNext up I had to order the Roasted Boudin ($9) which was served with dijon chantilly(kind of like a mayo) & fried okra. The okra pieces were very long not the short little stubs you are typically served at most places. Boudin is a rice and pork sausage which is very popular in Southwestern Louisiana and it's origins are in French cooking where they make a much milder version. Boudin blanc is one of my very favorite things and very hard to find in Orlando and so I was very excited when I saw it on the menu. From the first bite I could tell they made this in house. The pork pieces had very large long strings of meat not the typical ground pork you find in Boudin. It had a really nice medium flavor, I knew I wouldn't be getting that Cajun spice bite that I'm use to with good Boudin from Louisiana but Cask & Larder's Boudin came into it's own because it has a special flavor I can't quite nail down, it was probably the fact that it was smoked though I wouldn't use that word to describe the flavor either. I look forward to trying this again many times and I hope Chef decides to try pairing it with other things too.\\n\\nAnother dish I had been eying on the menu was the Smoked Oyster & Crawfish Pot Pie $12. I really love the flavor of very smokey oysters but unfortunately that flavor didn't come through in this dish. I expected more of a pot pie type of creation but what I was served was a medium sized crock pot type bowl, not unlike the ones you might be served french onion soup in. Inside was a light brown gravy with too many pieces of celery, too few chunks of crawfish and a partial cornbread crust on top. \\n\\nI maxed out the length of the review length here but check out my website for the rest and pictures."},{"name":"Blazing Tomato Pizza and Pasta","address":"8145 International Dr, Ste 531","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This place is pretty cool.

I don't know how they do the sauce but if they were to squish it out on top of the bowl I think it would've been waaaaay too salty so I absolute suggest getting your sauces on the side! \\n\\nThe hubby also got green beer which he said was a little too hoppy for his liking.

Doesn't have to be great, but Swagat can be better than average (when they try), and with a little extra effort I can make it here during my lunch break.  The outside is sketchy, but the inside is FAR nicer than you'd expect.  Rather posh and cozy.  Freaky contrast. The parking lot is small, but there's plenty of on-street parking and I've never had to walk more than 50 feet to the front door.   I've read a lot of reviews where people criticize the raggedy outside or a supposed lack of parking, they must be expecting silk cushions in the middle of a Walmart parking lot. Learn to parallel park, people!!!\\n\\nI've been here about 3 or 4 times in the last few months.  I really want to come back, but am not sure I will.  Here's the thing.  While my first visits were great, service has proved very inconsistent from visit to visit  When staff is \\"on their game\\" the buffet is a great deal.  The dishes are quite tasty and varied, and worth four yelp stars as well as the $10 fee. When they're off, I leave decidedly annoyed and want to give them two stars and demand my money back. After today they're staying in the two star category and will likely not see my wallet for a while.\\n\\nI arrived around 1pm with the restaurant 1/3 full.  Didn't seem to be a rush.  Imagine my shock when I discovered the buffet was out of naan, raita (a combo yogurt and veggies), both chutneys, and half the veggie dishes at 1pm. Most were not refilled by the time I left as staff seemed to be focused on getting the already full meat dishes piled even higher.  This was especially perplexing as I saw a lot of staff running about doing god knows what, yet my water was never refilled despite 45 minutes of looking thirsty.  To add insult to injury, the naan was decidedly mediocre when it finally showed up.  New recipe?  New Cooks? What the hell?

I waited for the wine to eat.  In fact, the dates came before the wine.  Not sure what happened there...  \\nAnyhow, the spinach was freaking delicious. Yummy, garlicky spinach. The potatoes did not come with a description so I just went off the fact they came with an egg and protein and carbs sounded good.  There was something else on there...  perhaps mayo?  I don't know.

Its a solid addition to the already thriving and exciting Beltline! Here are a few things about GyM's you may want to know...\\n\\nLocation/Parking - As mentioned above, located near Krog Street on the newest part of the Beltline. Parking is a bit tricky, as due to their location they do not have any dedicated parking. My best advice would be to park as if you were going to Krog Street or search along Edgewood or Auburn Ave. \\n\\nDecor/Ambiance/Seating - Guac y Margs is not what you would refer to as a \\"large\\" place. With a bar that seats around 10, and interior tables that will seat around 22-24 combined with a small patio with a few picnic tables, space is at a premium here. With that being said, don't be surprised if you end up eating and drinking while standing! Like many places on the Beltline, the interior is treated as a showroom for local artists showcasing a variety of photos, paintings and other art pieces that are all for sale. \\n\\nService - GyM's is still in its infancy and is clearly still learning how to handle the volume of people that the Beltline produces. This is not to throw any shade, as the servers themselves were of great spirit and very nice! It just seems that the system they use for slow periods to ensure the food and drinks are delivered in a timely fashion and to the correct people, may not be they best when at capacity. For us, we packed out the place and maybe it was the sheer volume of people coming in at once, but the delivery of our food and drinks was, spotty at best. Some of us never got our food, some of us got the wrong food and some of us just gave up. Again, I am sure its a growing pain and they will figure it out long term. \\n\\nPricing - Meh. It is what is expected for the location. As an example, if you get a couple of tacos, a cheese dip and a mixed drink - you can expect to spend around $25 - $30. \\n\\nFood - Food wise, they have a limited menu that consists of tacos, bowls and dips. They give you meat/meatless options to fill your tacos or bowls. The include barbacoa, chicken, carnitas, tofu, cauliflower and a couple of other options. On the weekends, they offer a breakfast taco that includes sweet potato and chorizo. I was a little sad because I couldn't get a chorizo taco without getting it in breakfast form...they should work on that. For the dips, you can choose from guacamole, queso or charro beans.I personally ended up with the barbacoa bowl - which was of decent size and featured a lot of fresh veggies, a spicy salsa and a solid amount of meat. The best deal is a combo, which is a couple/three tacos along with 2 or 3 dip choices. \\n\\nDrink - Full bar, frozen drinks, bottled sodas and a small selection of beers, including a few local brews...and of course - margaritas! Within our group, we had a lot of things and the ones that stood out were the \\"Nobody calls it HOTlanta anymore\\" which consisted of coke, bourbon and peanut, and the Frose! \\n\\nOverall, I am a fan of Guac y Margs! I really want them to succeed and think they are an amazing add to the Beltline. I will certainly be back!"},{"name":"Nino's Italian Restaurant","address":"1931 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Nino's is everything you want an Italian restaurant to be.

They have a top it yourself bar with some very good salsa. I think it was 6 different kinds.  And you can drown your taco in sour cream if ya want, and not get charged extra like most places do.

It was highly disappointing! We had reservations for Saturday 8:00 p.m. and were promptly seated. That was THE best part of the evening!\\n\\nWe ordered beverages and an antipasto supremo as an appetizer -- which never arrived -- prior to our main entrees. We notified our server, who acted as if it was the kitchen's fault. Now, I'm in the service industry and things happen, but you DO apologize to the customer for the inconvenience. (I know the idiot forgot to place our order! He was evasive with us.) He brushed this service stumble aside. Never apologizing for the appetizer not having been made for us, or anything. He just left us hanging.\\n\\nWhen the meal arrived, it was okay. Not great, but okay. Certainly nothing to rave about. Then, our previously mentioned server disappears for AT LEAST 20 minutes after we've finished with our entrees. The rest of the servers have cleaned up and reset the other tables. Hello? Where are you, server?\\n\\nWe were patiently waiting to be offered dessert, but, after the extensive absenteeism of our server -- we asked for the check when he finally decided to show back up. (We decided to have dessert elsewhere, and it was a far better experience.)\\n\\nAs we left, I stopped to speak with the maitre d. (I have to be pretty steamed about a lack of service or food quality before I complain!) I brought to her attention the aforementioned (lack of) service, my overall disappointment for the evening, and that I likely would not return in a calm manner. She seemed alarmed, but nothing came of it.\\n\\nPerhaps others have had better dining experiences here, but I won't be back -- particularly for what it cost.

After several false starts and delays, the north side Phil's is open for business. The food menu is exactly the same as the other Austin locations (woo-hoo, more Violet Crown sliders for me). The same wonderful playscape (minus the cows) loved by families and the ice cream are there, too.  Imagine the best of the Burnet Road location moved up here, but with lots more seating & shade, less noisy traffic and fewer aggressive grackles.\\n\\nIf you're new to the area or just don't know, Phil's is a restaurant spin-off concept from Austin's iconic Amy's Ice Creams (est. 1984). It was named for the late Phil Clay, a beloved friend and business partner who passed away suddenly in a motorcycle accident in 2003. The store's slogan, with permission from Robert Earl Keen, is \\"the road goes on forever ...the party never ends\\".  \\n\\nThe Phil's menu is mostly basic burgers with flavorful toppings and a sweet bun, each combination named for an Austin-area neighborhood. You can also get sweet potato fries, veggies burgers, chicken or fish sandwiches, onion rings, and corn dogs. If you can't decide what to order, a nice option is the 3 or 2 mini-burger basket in which you choose from the flavor combos - 78704, Violet Crown, and 78756 are my recurring faves. \\n\\nIt's neat to see the flatscreens with a live feed of the indoor skydiving place next door to this Austinville 78750 location. iFly couldn't ask for a better advertisement. Everyone indoors at both Phil's and the adjacent Amy's couldn't help but to watch with fascination during our first visit during opening week.\\n\\nI love that the tree shaded play yard is behind the building, giving a nice buffer to the sounds & sights of busy Research Boulevard out front. Also great is the large windows between the indoor dining space and the backyard, giving parents a complete view of the playscape (essential when all of the outdoor tables are full). Even if you don't have kids, I dare you to watch just a few minutes of the quick yellow tub merry-go-round in action (followed by the inevitable dizzy, nauseous wailing of a small drunk child) and not break into a smile."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"Several visits with a group, always a good meal.

From the outside, Pasta Da Pulcinella looks very small, but the restaurant actually stretches out towards the back, so it's larger than it actually appears. \\n\\nI was seated in a large, elevated and padded seat next to a window, which was very nice. We went ahead and placed our orders. I got the crispy calamari to start and the tortellini with chicken for my entree. \\n\\nAfter getting my drink, I was soon given a basket of bread, which was fairly small for the size of the table. However, before we could finish the basket our appetizers were already dropped off, which made the table feel very rushed. That feeling continued throughout the entire night. \\n\\nThe calamari dish was nicely sized and the sauce on the side was tasty. I felt as if the calamari itself could have been a bit better seasoned. However, I suppose the side dipping sauce made up for that. \\n\\nOur entrees were soon whisked towards us. My entree was absolutely delicious. The pasta itself was soft and tender and the sauce surrounding the tortellini added a nice, unique flavor. The chicken was most and flavorful and topped off a delicious and fresh meal. \\n\\nI went with the chocolate cake for dessert and just like with every other party of the meal, it was brought out almost immediately. I had about 30 seconds between placing my order and actually getting my cake. I would prefer at least two more minutes just to chat with my party and enjoy my time. The cake itself was nicely layered and had a nice, savory chocolate taste. I thought that the cake could have been presented a bit better because the whipped cream on the side of the cake was slipping off. \\n\\nAltogether, Pasta De Pulcinella serves some tasty, fresh and authentic Italian food.

Did you say Wings?  Quickly I go through a mental checklist as a co-worker urges me to my first encounter with BWW.\\n1.  Am I wearing a shirt that can get sauce spilled on it?  Yes.\\n2.  Do I have money in the bank?  Enough.\\n3.  Am I just hungry enough to eat and not ravenous where I don't actually taste anything and just shovel semi-nourishment into my face?  Check.\\n\\nWhen you walk in you realize that this place is 100% Corporate Sports Bar-Style 1A.\\nBig screens?  Check.  \\nLots of them?  Check.  \\nNubile young hostess? Check.  \\nSports memorabilia plastered over every conceivable surface?  Check. \\n\\nIt seems to matter to the staff if you want to be seated in the dining area or the bar area.  What's the difference, I asked.  The short answer she should have said was, none, but it was a drawn out explanation about both having full service and one you seat yourself in.  I figured self seating was quicker than waiting for nubile young hostess to get a clue that we just wanted a place to plant our keister and consume mass quantities.  She was nice in her confusion though.\\n\\nThe menu was predictable but some highlights were way more wing sauces than anyone probably needs, lots of side order options and a surprising lack of non-alcoholic options.  My brain said, \\"They are know for wings, order wings.\\"  Stomach said, \\"Can you afford a LOT of wings?\\"  The wallet answered, \\"Not really!\\".  So I opted for the buffalo chicken sandwich and fries, it's like one big boneless wing but with a bun, and you can add any wing sauce you want.  Now here was something cool, when I told young male waiter (template #1) that I had not been here before he ran off and brought back a sauce tasting kit.  That, I thought was almost worth a fourth star... almost.  Co-worker got the chicken tender wrap and the potato wedges.  A soda for him and an iced tea for me.\\n\\nHere is where they lost the fourth star.  I asked for rat-killing sugar substitute in the yellow wrapper.  Young male waiter (template #1) said he only had pink wrapper.  C'mon people!  It's the 21st century and you choose a 1970's sugar substitiute only?!  Fourth star?  \\n\\"I'm sorry, you lose Sir, you stole fizzy lifting drinks!\\" --- (Movie quote)\\n\\nThe sandwich (photo in my profile collection) came pretty quick as co-worker and I craned our necks to watch many different sports (some we have never heard of) on many many many televisions.  Presentation was very nice, and you got lots of fries and wedges and even a pickle slice (a under-used nice garnishment if you ask me).  For what the place is, it was pretty tasty.  It wasn't special or original, but it was what it was, a nice sandwich lunch for a somewhat decent price.\\n\\nThe bathroom was nice and clean and each urinal had a small flat screen in front of it.  I guess you could switch TV's if you want to tempt fate with a rarely successful stream-stoppage to step to the side.

My fianc√© is allergic to nuts and looking through the menu we quickly realized that he could not have 90+% of the menu items. \\n\\nWe did enjoy the items we got, I particularly loved the dip trio, but the portions were minuscule.

Although the bread and veggie \\"topping\\" we were given was incredibly bland, I liked the wine and beer selection. It wasn't overbearing but the selection was varied. The pasta dishes were great and most of the entrees were tasty if unremarkable.

Although appetizers arrived reasonably quickly, the main course took an absurdly long time to arrive.  Meanwhile, adjacent tables were seated, served, and left while we were waiting for our meal.

Viga caters many events for the Boston location of my current employer and as such, I sampled a couple of packaged lunches (well, actually one packaged sandwich lunch and one \\"sampler\\" style lunch with sandwich halves) while visiting just before Halloween. So this review is specific to those items I ate and only orthogonal to the restaurant location. I'm not sure if this is the location that produces the catered food, but it is the closest to the office and wins the lottery.\\n\\nLunch number one was a Milano grilled chicken breast sandwich with homemade dill sauce, romaine and tomatoes. This was served on what was either a ciabatta or Italian baguette with thinly sliced chicken - the sandwich was about 9-10 inches long and quite filling. Taste-wise it was good but nothing special. The bag also held Sun Chips, a White Macadamia Nut Cookie, a Viga-printed mint, a moist towelette and a package holding knife/fork/salt/pepper.\\n\\nLunch number two was more of a catered- platter affair with several veg and non-veg quarter-sandwiches. I tried the roast and it was quite good - I also had something like a Caprese salad-on-a-role that was rather innocuous and pretty much tasteless. If I had my druthers I would have loaded up on salad but for some reason that part of the cater went upstairs.\\n\\nIn all, the food was very reminiscent of some of the local Atlanta chains like Panera Bread or similar. I'm betting the food would be much better on-location - it seems my Boston office caters quite a bit from Viga so there must not be many complaints."},{"name":"Melton's App & Tap","address":"2500 N Decatur Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Another week in Atlanta has come to an end, and we are enjoying our final order of buffalo tenders and waffle fries.

Both were ok, no real complaints other than the cakes being spongy.  Neither were very interesting or flavorful, but acceptable to get the saliva flowing.  Wouldn't order either again personally.\\n\\nEntrees consisted of the green and panang curries (both with chicken).  Both were served with yellow rice (odd, that) and didn't offer much other than the chicken in either case (aside from the curry sauce itself, of course).  The green offers bamboo shoots, the panang offers eggplant.  So, rather sparse in terms of tasty things to chew on (onions, peppers, etc.).  A minimalist implementation.  The curries, like the appetizers, were not very aromatic or exciting.\\n\\nThe entrees came on special plates with little cups that contained two different kinds of soups, including an inedible Tom Kha Kai that was wayyyyyyy too sweet AND salty but otherwise quite bland (sad, since it's quite an easy soup to make well), and a portion of extra curry sauce (odd since the dish itself is already soupy from the large amount of supplied sauce).\\n\\nService was attentive and polite.  I didn't notice anyone of Thai persuasion here (either on staff or dining), but of course I didn't take a tour of the kitchen and know nothing of the ownership.\\n\\nOverall it comes off as a very Americanized, simple rendition of Thai food, and is more focused on appearance than substance.

I like variety in my life, so I go with the greens pie for the other half, which is a white pizza. I never would have thought to put lemon on pizza, but Rabottini's did, and it's awesome.

Many places like this Focus too much on one of those aspects while not paying enough attention to the others. This is not appear to be the case here. The beer was good probably one of the better ones we visited while in town. Most of the seating areas if not all of them are Outdoors which usually isn't the problem. It reminded me a lot of local venue that while enjoyable doesn't quite have the quality of beer that we enjoyed while here. If you're looking for a good place to spend an afternoon or even a day this would be a good option.

The bad thing about big party reservations is that the whole party has to be there or else they can't hold it for you. \\n\\nI always order the spaghetti with meat sauce. They take a simple American classic dish and makes it as good as it can get. This dish never fails me. However, this time, I wanted to try other dishes they had on their menu. I ordered off of their specialties selection of their menu. I ordered the chicken bellagio. It is a \\"Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad\\" as described on their menu. It was good, however, I'm not a fan of the thin fried chicken \\"steaks\\" or patties. The pasta was good, surprisingly, with the arugula salad (that I mixed with it). It also comes with a thinly sliced ham on top of the salad. The server described it as \\"pork\\". Overall, it was pretty good. I still had a lot left over because the portions are really big. My boyfriend ordered thai chicken pasta which was very delish. It is cooked with green and \\"normal\\" pasta with chunks of chicken with bean sprouts. Sort of like pad thai. We also ordered the calamari as an appetizer. It is one of the best calamari I've ever had. It comes with marinara and tartar sauce. My boyfriend ordered the coke and tequila mixed (coke & jose cuervo) drink which he didn't think was mixed well. \\n\\nAlso, the cheesecake here is very good also.

First off, the woman taking orders at the front had very little personality. In no way did I feel welcome or that my patronage mattered. In a world with almost too many options, I personally think it's important to feel that my business is appreciated. \\n\\nIn addition, I grabbed a beer from the case to go with my meal and was never offered a glass. The woman grabbed the beer to ring it up and blankly asked a colleague to open it for me and just handed it back with the number to place on my table for my food. \\n\\nAs for the food, I was pretty underwhelmed. While it certainly wasn't awful, it also was far from memorable. I ordered the Thai cashew quinoa bowl and didn't notice a single cashew (perhaps it was in the sauce?). There wasn't even a hint of nutty flavor that I could detect, possibly due to the dish being borderline too spicy and the chili overbearing the dish's seasoning. \\n\\nOverall, I was disappointed with this location and will not be returning during my visit.

We were not feeling BBQ, tacos or TexMex.  So we turned to Yelp and liked the reviews for Epicure.  The small strip mall location (they are keeping this location for wine and cheese and moving the restaurant to a larger space nearby in April, 2018) is unassuming.  Had I not seen the photos and read the reviews, I would not have been inclined to eat there for dinner.  The exterior lights and is a bit like a sandwich shop,  \\n\\nOur experience was excellent.  I definitely recommend and will eat here again when I'm in the area.  Our food selections which we split:  rumaki, Vietnamese meatballs, cilantro lime Caesar Salad, soup du jour (sweet potato poblano pepper) and roasted organic carrots.  We had too much food (we wanted everything !), so took some home.  Everything was beautifully prepared and tasted great!  And our bill ( no alcohol) was $50, not including tip!  That is a great value.\\n\\nService was great--Larry was our waiter and he was prompt, a good guide and narrator of the menu, friendly and thorough. He quickly picked up plates when we were done to eliminate clutter on a small two top serving space.\\n\\nThis concept is spot on--creative and organic food preparations, artisan cheeses and select wines.

If you want better food for just aloof service, go to Nostrana. We recently had a particularly bad experience there; my little essay to management below. \\n---\\nWe went to the restaurant at about 7:50 p.m. on Oct. 3 to celebrate my boyfriend's unexpected raise. We didn't have a reservation, but there were plenty of tables open and we were seated quickly. After we ordered a bottle of bubbly for the occasion, service was extremely slow -- as in the table that was seated after we were a glass of wine in was getting their bread before our order was taken.\\n\\nI was finally able to flag down the waitress to take our order, and we ordered two appetizers, two mains, and a bottle of wine, noting to the waitress that we would take the bottle home with us, implying we weren't finishing it at the restaurant.\\n\\nOur appetizers came promptly, but we had waited at least 15 minutes for our entree (15 minutes from when I glanced at my watch to see that we'd been waiting a while), with no sign from the waitress that it was coming, although we could see what was most likely our food sitting on the counter. After I was unable to flag her down, my boyfriend called over to her (she was behind the bar, we were seated by the front window), \\"Hey, is that our food over there? Because we're ready to get out of here.\\" It was 9:10 p.m.\\n\\nShe came over and said no, that wasn't our food. We said we'd been waiting a really long time, been here an hour and a half with no entree, so if she would box our food and bring the check, we're leaving. She said that she was waiting for us to work on our wine; that a big group was just now leaving; that the cook times are at least 20 minutes, especially for something like albacore. Three excuses -- one that meant she didn't retain the entire conversation we had about taking the wine; one that seems like a kitchen management issue; and one that is absurd, and also a kitchen management issue.\\n\\nI repeated that she can box the food and bring us the check. My boyfriend was so irritated he said he was leaving. She came back over with our plated food (it was in fact the food we saw sitting on the counter), and *yelled at me while holding our food*: \\"YOU CAME IN AT 8:07 SO YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HERE AN HOUR AND A HALF, AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A RESERVATION.\\" In response to being yelled at -- seeing her contorted face while she held evidence that she had just dropped the ball at serving our food -- I said, \\"are you telling me we're not getting our food because we didn't have a f****** reservation?\\"\\n\\nAt that point, another woman came over and told me we had to leave because I can't speak to the staff that way. I reiterated that the waitress had just told me that we \\"didn't even have a reservation\\" as some sort of excuse for being a terrible server. The woman, talking to me like I'm a crazy person despite the absurd behavior of the waitress, said the waitress should not have said that, but I need to leave. I don't need to pay, she said, I just need to leave because I can't talk to the waitress that way.\\n\\nHad she said she's comping the meal because of our terrible treatment, I would have agreed and left. But she said she just wanted me out because I defended myself when I was yelled at. As an adult, I think I am entitled not to sit quietly and be polite when yelled at. So I paid $157 and left. It was probably the worst $157 I have ever spent.\\n\\nWhile perhaps I should not have said \\"f******,\\" I assumed that a waitress who has the gall to yell at a customer after providing terrible service -- apparently because we did not have a reservation -- could handle it.\\n\\nI live near the restaurant and have taken people there frequently. Obviously, I will never return. And obviously I will tell anyone who will listen to never go. But perhaps this can be a teaching moment for your staff that people who don't have reservations deserve basic service, too; it's literally their jobs."},{"name":"Muscle Maker Grill","address":"358 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"4","text":"This place has a good vegan option!

I just dont wont to lead gastronauts and heat-hunters astray with hyperbole!) \\n\\nIf you're not interested in trying the namseake's food, then keep going:\\n\\nThey also sell Cola Lacaye if you're Haitian/Haitian-American (or grew up around us :P) looking for fun nostalgic tastes... I haven't had it for ages and was thrilled. If you've never had it - Cola Lacaye is a fruit soda produced in Haiti and a common sweet drink staple for casual dining in Haiti. This operation is owned and run by someone Haitian as well as head's up. Open kitchen so you can see the huge pots and pans simmering. For my fellow food-hygiene freaks I watched him repeatedly wash his hands and i wasn't even there for long. Woo!\\n\\n.....I guess it fits a 'hole in the wall' definition, BUT: it is a bit too bright, too clean, too well-visited to really capture that kind of title. Which is a positive. It is very small though, could comfortably seat maybe 10 at most. So Pikliz is designed more for takeout not eating in.\\n\\nIf you're vegetarian/vegan there are options for you: sweet plantains, different kinds of rice, pikliz, beet salad (may be a regional difference in preparation than what I'm used to, but I loved it anyway.. this preparation is dairy free/vegan BTW), and other items. Everything tasted freshly made.\\n\\nI did not see a menu but there is a chalkboard outside with the day's specials and options. The guy behind the counter has a spread in front of you when you walk in and if you just say common Haitian dishes he is immediately accommodating. I did go for the classic Haitian dishes but they seem to have pan-Caribbean options as they have jerk chicken and ox-tails which I didn't try but looked fantastic.\\n\\nThe cost at the end of way less than I was expecting. There was a decent line from repeat customers hovering over the glass of foods of different backgrounds. Humble cute place - only one person working and it is easy to miss/walk by given how small it is. I will visit whenever I need that nostalgia itch scratched... because much to the chagrin of my family I'm a crappy cook of Haitian cuisine but now  Pikliz can do it for me.\\n\\nBut again - not just Haitian food. I'd say predominantly traditional/regular Haitian food  with pan-Caribbean options. \\n\\nMy critique? Yes I'm biased, but this is a 2-par critique:\\n\\n1. If they had Haitian desserts like peanut brittle, rum cake, puddings, etc. then I'm pretty sure I'd camp out here, but no pressure Pikliz. No pressure..... OK, just a little pressure.  \\n\\n2. This isnt a critique so much as a head's up for cultural culinary differences: The macaroni and cheese dish is def not what fully what Americans expect when they hear 'mac N cheese'. It is more a gratin than a casserole (kryl: Makawoni au Graten, fr: Macroni au Gratin) than a traditional soul food dish. By a long shot. The dominant but lightly distributed cheeses are parmesan & mozzarella - think of it as more of a casserole than Americana mac&cheese. To me that is not a negative as I'm used to it (Im unsure if this is regionally traditional in Haiti or traditional at all, admittedly, but it is exactly what I grew up with).... but I'm very aware of the difference. \\n\\nBe aware that my context for my review is that: \\n1. I did not have any meat dishes\\n2. This is a small startup in the less developed part of Somerville (but VERY close to Assembly Square, def walking distance but for serious walkers - Id say 'slightly-perilous' walking distance)\\n3. I love Haiti so I have pink glasses at all times... however, I am discriminating about food and I assure you that it was definitely nostalgic and good.\\n\\nThey do catering as well if you want to swipe a business card.

Upon arrival we figured there may be a wait to bowl (which there was a 45min wait) no big deal, and we thought we would grab some apps and drinks in the mean time. We sat at the bar in the cocktails lounge area and ordered two margaritas.... It really wasn't all that busy, but after waiting 15 minutes I decided to grab a food menu from down the bar. When I caught the bartenders attention I asked if I could order some food when he had a second, he replied yup give me a moment. Then he went and cleared a mess on the bar, which no one was waiting for- then he stepped off the bar to clear tables of empty glassware, and came back onto the bar to finally take our simple order. I order a small buffalo tender with extra ranch and a mushroom pizza. We get our food, but instead of buffalo tenders we get a plain tenders. I said excuse me these are plain and he replies nice - and goes back to doing his thing. Fortunately the food runner and bar-back showed us some concern in getting some buffalo sauce. After well over an hour we didn't get paged to bowl and decided to get our check. When he approached I asked him how long he'd been a bartender he replied 6 years.... Then I read my check and it turns out the mistake in the food was his mistake- so I asked one last question- so it was your mistake in us receiving the wrong food? he nods, and i say so that's that? He says, Yup that's that. \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I are both in the service industry. Her a server and myself a bartender, which makes writing this even harder.

The Chef runs a very tight ship, and it's impressive to watch them serve 24 people at a time with all the different components each dish requires. The menu for that night (Sat, Feb 16) was:\\n\\n-Cauliflower Veloute (Brown Butter Crisps, Trout Roe, Tarragon Oil, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beast-portland?select=G-kfr2WI4BIwgocamDPcAw#G-kfr2WI4BIwgocamDPcAw): Creamy and delicious, and one of the best veloutes I've had. I loved everything about this dish!\\n-Bread and Butter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beast-portland?select=G-kfr2WI4BIwgocamDPcAw#0uIq_qB3c5Fnnof_Zp06Iw): The bread was still a little warm when they brought it over, and the butter was room temperature and tasted delicious with the bread. It was difficult to stop eating this!\\n-Charcuterie Plate (Foie Gras Bon-Bon/Peanut Shortbread/Sauternes Gelee, Chicken Liver Mousse/Leaf Lard Cracker, Steak Tartare/Brioche/Quail Egg, Lamb/Preserved Lemon/Pistachio Terrine, Pork Rillettes, Cherry Wood Cold Smoked Duck Breast, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beast-portland?select=G-kfr2WI4BIwgocamDPcAw#us4-YvKoAgxN5N7_XFyqDw): I'm still amazed thinking about all the prep work that went into this plate. My favorites were the foie gras, steak tartare, and the duck breast. \\n-Palate Cleanser (Sorbet w/Thyme, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beast-portland?select=G-kfr2WI4BIwgocamDPcAw#kvrWfpI5YrFW0kW5XurxtQ): I loved that the sorbet was so refreshing, but the herb taste was a bit too strong.\\n-Carman Ranch Striploin Roast (Farro, Creamed Kholrabi, Crispy Maitakes, Sauteed Kale Raab, Beef/Duck Jus, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beast-portland?select=G-kfr2WI4BIwgocamDPcAw#J2Tiew4NVA96oqIJh10Gsg): The striploin was cooked almost a perfect medium rare (a couple of pieces were more medium), and I loved the maitakes in this dish. There was a bit too much farro for me, since I was pretty full already, and it was difficult for me to finish this dish.\\n-Beet, Cara-Cara Orange, Grapefruit & Fennel Salad (Breaded & Fried Portland Creamery Goat Cheese, Local Micro Greens, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beast-portland?select=G-kfr2WI4BIwgocamDPcAw#WCpy0sf7R697jqs4G_Zbdw): I LOVED the fried goat cheese, and felt it went well with the beets. However, some of the beets weren't tender enough, so I had to work to cut through them. \\n-Selection of Cheese From Steve at Cheese Bar (Olive Oil & Black Pepper Crackers, Armagnac Poached Prunes, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beast-portland?select=G-kfr2WI4BIwgocamDPcAw#V4kDn3w0kKCM2J3UuQO3Sw): My least favorite dish of the night. I didn't like any of the 3 cheeses on the plate, or the spices used in the poaching of the prune. \\n-Warm Dark Chocolate Souffle (Amerena Cherry Ice Cream, Pistachio Tuille, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beast-portland?select=G-kfr2WI4BIwgocamDPcAw#QlAQBTCdFNHk3n7nmXU-iQ): DELICIOUS, and I was amazed the souffle held up for a long enough time for them to prep all 24 without a complete collapse. I didn't think the cherry ice cream went well with the chocolate, and just scooped it out, but the souffle itself was chocolately and amazing. It had a thin layer of crunchy crust, and the inside was chewy and the perfect amount of gooey. The pistachio tuille also added a nice crispy crunch.\\n-Little \\"Beast\\" Shaped Cookies (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beast-portland?select=G-kfr2WI4BIwgocamDPcAw#ZXfIpLCn3OGg9YRCrrqAWg): Super cute, but these were a little overdone.\\n\\nOne of my only complaints is that the \\"rules\\" aren't communicated while making the reservation. Unfortunately, we had arrived early, and were shooed out. You can have drinks at the fancy izakaya place next door, but we didn't want to ruin our appetites and decided to wait in the car. The communal seating also really threw me off, and I would've been sad if my friends and I got stuck in the middle and sandwiched between a bunch of strangers.\\n\\nOverall, I definitely enjoyed my experience at Beast, and hope to try their brunch one day.

I have come to decide Dim Sum is not for me. 1. I don't eat meat and 2. I always seem to choose wrong. This was my 3rd Dim Sum try and my first at Winsor. There was a cramped wait and the  sweet hostess was slightly inefficient but it worked and we went with the flow so no problem. We sat at a communal table and order shrimp noodle, beef balls, mango pudding, custard balls, two kinds of dumplings and turnip cakes. The shrimp noodle was a log sort of slimy thing with shrimp. We both being pretty adept at the use of chopsticks, were challenged. The slimy consistency was not too pleasing. The turnip cake came with pork so I was not able to enjoy. My daughter did not love her beef balls. The dumplings were ok but slimy and sticking to the steamers. We liked the mango pudding. The custard balls were good. Despite our lack of fondness and enthusiasm for the food, we had a blast. Loved our experience and DO recommend Winsor for Dim Sum. Each plate was 3.15. We chose Winsor because they have a menu vs carts. I never did well with carts as I could not be sure what I was eating. Winsor has a picture menu and written names for each item.  Our bill as quite cheap inclusive of hot tea. Oh yes, food came fast and piping hot."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen","address":"1298 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"3.5","text":"I've had two differing experiences here.

We waited about 45 minutes for a table for three which, arriving at a popular brunch spot at 11 on a Sunday, I thought was actually reasonable, but between this sort of hype and what I have come to expect from a \\"Southern\\" style brunch - being from New Orleans - I have to say that the overall flavour of my meal was disappointment.\\n\\nWe started with iced coffees, which were disappointing, but not remarkably so. The real feelings of loss began with the appetisers, and remained throughout. The hush puppies were warm and cooked to perfection, but their batter was not salted enough and tasted predominantly of baking soda. The accompanying remoulade, while adapted for New England tastes (dill, I think) was, however, delicious, albeit not what you'd expect from a New Orlean's style remoulade. The beignets were okay, a bit on the overcooked side, and the deviled eggs seemed also to have been catering to their locale (hello pickles) - all of which is perfectly natural, but to any southerners looking for a taste of home: look again.\\n\\nAll of this was crowned by the biscuits and gravy, which were not awful in themselves, but nowhere near the deliciousness I've come to expect in an almost Pavlovian response to these words. The gravy was very thin and not at all spicy, and while the biscuits held up to it well, I realised later that this was because they were singularly dense, in a way that made the dish too heavy and impossible to finish.

I looked at the patty and, yikes, it was red (not pink) in the middle. A bit of my own burger confirmed: Patties were completely uncooked. But fries were so overcooked and crunchy (and in tiny little pieces) that we couldn't eat them either. Even with generous amounts of ketchup.\\n\\nWe thought the milkshakes were all right, though, so we drank both of those up, no problem. Well ... no problem until a few minutes later when we were nauseated and sweaty and both ready to lie down in the Cates' Park grass and die from the experience ... was the milk old? Were there nasty microbes fomenting in the heat? Did the *completely* disaffected teen who slapped the shakes together wash her hands first? Or did she use clean equipment? Why were we so sick from those milkshakes ... ? I'm NOT exaggerating here: we sat in the car in the parking lot for 1/2 an hour, unsure whether to exit and throw up on the grass, or hold it for the drive home from Cates' Park. We chose the latter and laid around all evening recovering from the misery.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nYou know, before all of the above, I wanted to complain to the completely uninterested teenaged staff ... but they were so *busy* and *unconcerned* with the health/safety of their patrons, I just gave up.

And they and their (probably) minimum-waged employees just don't give a f*ck as long as those $30+ bills keep coming in.\\n\\nOne last thing: The kitchen and grill areas are in full sight of the public. The grime, mold, food detritus, dust, and beach sand in and around the Wally's Burgers stand was disgusting. I should have steered myself and my daughter clear based on the off-putting kitchen area (lack of) cleanliness alone. Oh well, (luckily) live and learn.\\n\\nTo sum up: Disgusting inedible burgers, over-fried fries, sickening milkshakes, and grimy, unclean/dangerous facilities overseen by completely uninterested teens ... maybe this is one health hazard that's due for an inspection from VCH?"},{"name":"Dave & Buster's","address":"2215 D And B Dr SE","city":"Marietta","stars":"2.5","text":"Service was lacking and ribs was full of cartilage.

There was a line out the door, but it moved quickly and we were able to check out the menu while we waited. We all decided on the 3 piece chicken tender combo, which came with fries and a fountain drink. I believe each combo was around $11 or $12, which is a good deal for a meal in Disney Springs. I upgraded my side to mac and cheese for $1 upcharge. \\n\\nAfter we ordered, we were given a buzzer and got a table outside. Food was ready in about 10 minutes and can be picked up at the counter.. The tenders were well-breaded and crispy. They breading had a great texture and the chicken was not dry. If you're a huge sauce/condiment fan like me, then the best part of Chicken Guy is trying all the dipping sauces! They have 22 different sauces to choose from to compliment your chicken. We tried: Nashville hot honey, sweet sriracha barbecue, peri peri, chipotle ranch, habanero hot sauce, and donkey sauce. My favorites were the Nashville hot honey, peri peri, and chipotle ranch. I wanna put the Nashville hot honey on everything, it's that good! The chicken tenders come with your choice of 2 sauces, so you're bound to find some you like. \\n\\nAs for the sides, the mac and cheese was a huge portion for a side, but I found the macaroni to be not cooked well enough and kind of hard. Too al dente. It could have been an off day, but I would just get the fries instead next time-- they are the seasoned kind and are a great secondary vessel for the sauces. We also tried the apple cinnamon cereal shake!

I felt the quality was good but was not impressed by presentation or each dish's explanation.  Textures were good, but some dishes had a single ingredient dominate, overriding flavors from other ingredients. And, why would you have the kitchen in full view without interaction of the chefs with the guests?  It was nice to see the dishes being prepared, but they totally had their own conversation amongst themselves. \\n\\nI feel my experience fell so short, that I would not recommend them to friends or family. \\nDiners beware of their cancellation policy!!

What excuse do I have not to go?!\\n\\nThe sandwiches are not going to be value sandwiches like at Al's where you can get huge sandwiches for like under 10 dollars. These sandwiches are like 13-15 dollars and are really heavy. I usually get the Cuban or Reuben with coleslaw. They make the Cuban fresh with a lot of meat, little to no vegetables, spicy chipotle mayo, and they toast it in a sandwich press. I tried getting fries on the side one time and was surprised at the serving size. You could probably split it 4 ways with the amount they give. \\n\\nI've also gotten the steak tip plate with rice and salad. The meat is really good, and I think they grill it. It semi makes me feel healthy with the salad, but definitely has a lot of fat. I think the rice is rice pilaf that is cooked in butter.

Currently, it is a little out-of-date because they are updated their menu items.  I was disappointed that there was no corn bread (I LOVE cornbread).  \\n\\nThe nice girl at the cash section (in the back, left of the small establishment) suggested the cole slaw at $3 (as I didn't feel like fries) It's nice that the handling of money and handling of food is kept completely separate.

As the place wasn't busy, a male employee brought me my items.\\n\\nThe coleslaw was a light, slightly sweet and slightly acidic slaw.  It was a little too much white cabbage (I prefer a little more carrot to add visual interest), but it was tasty.\\n\\nThe chicken had good crunch and one could tell it wasn't an over medicated battery cage bird.  It had a firmer texture and good flavour.  There were a few thin bread and butter pickles atop my chicken, which gave the crunchy skin a little sweetness.\\n\\nIf I go again, I will get takeout as it was very noisy.

Just perfect. \\n- Fried dough - \\"wit\\" beer doughnuts, soft caramel pudding, citrus-caramel glaze. They are amazing. \\n- The Ice Cream, no matter the featured flavors, this stuff is amazing.

The regular fried chicken on a Friday evening and the fried chicken and biscuits for brunch. The regular fried chicken did have fabulous flavor but it was a bit overdone. I appreciate the crispiness and breading as well as the smoked wildflower honey on top, does make for a little bit of a messy meal tho. I don't mind messy. The brunch friend chicken was flavored and cooked to perfection, however, so much dark meat and I really only dig white. I just wish the menu mentioned dark meat. \\n\\n- The mac and cheese is very flavorful but the texture wasn't extremely appealing. We shared a serving at the table and I just had one scoop, usually I am hoarding the mac and cheese. \\n\\n- The roasted potatoes for brunch were actually inedible. They were extremely overdone and tasted like 2 day old taters. I get that not everything can be perfect but I really wanted breakfast potatoes. \\n\\nThe menu is always changing so make sure you check it out so you don't miss something amazing and you don't head in there with your hopes high when they are not currently featuring something you desire. The great thing about this is everything is fresh, made daily in house and sourced locally, LOVE THAT! \\n\\nI will be returning often as I love the atmosphere and trying all the new dishes.

He was very polite, super accommodating and made me feel very welcome. When my party arrived, he came and spoke to the table as well. \\n\\nWe started by ordering quite a few small plates for our party of 10. A few things were taking a while to come out but everything was still going well. The food we did receive was delicious, especially the sliders which were cooked perfectly and juicy and deviled eggs that had interestingly, pleasant flavor. Our waiter seemed a little flustered but still seemed to be handling things. That is until I asked about the status of my lamb ragout. He insisted I hadn't ordered it and I did. Regardless, no one was visibly upset but that was the last time we saw the waiter. Another waiter handled our table from that point. The owner came by and offered me his card and a free lamb ragout on my next visit. Then, he sent an assortment of desserts for my friends' anniversary. The apple hand pies were really good. The creme brulee unfortunately wasn't set but overall it was a good visit.\\n\\nThe next day I realized I didn't have my credit card so I called the restaurant and Lee answered and was as gracious as before. I went by to pick it up in the evening and decided to have some food and drinks while I was there. The bartender, Kyle, was very nice and we spoke almost the whole time I was there. He also made me a really good bourbon drink with muddled blueberries. This time I ordered the the scallops along with the sliders, deviled eggs and hand pies. The scallops were cooked well and the puree was a nice touch. Once it started to get busy, I decided to cash out. I was going to pay for all the small plates I ordered (about 4), my 2 drinks and take my free lamb ragout to go. The bartender was confused about how to give me the lamb ragout without ringing it up so instead he took a few things off my bill I guess to make up for not giving me the ragout. The issue was 1. I wanted my ragout and 2. The items he took off didn't even equal the value of the ragout. I waited about 20 minutes for him to finally close my tab (my card was sitting there in front of him the whole time) and give me the ragout. \\n\\nOverall, the owner is great, good is good but there are just a few kinks with the staff.

I would recommend all 3 of these options, but I was really a fan of the tortelli. The taste was perfect for the season and it was something truly different.

The rustic, steampunk-ish decor feels perfect for the room. \\n\\nThat, as you might guess from the rating up top, was the good part. The food was okay but I think I'll leave Swift's for the downtown tourists and hip kids. A faint whiff of touristy schtick masquerading as hipster authenticity doesn't surprise me given the location, but I was hoping for more.\\n\\nWe started out with a couple of mimosas, which were on-point. The positive momentum started to wane when the food hit the table.

And that's saying a lot. \\n\\nWe had the second seating (8:45) on a rainy Saturday night. We were immediately impressed to find none other than Hilary Swank, Hollywood actress, seated at our table with her dad and other family members. That speaks volumes about the hype this place receives. They weren't given preferential treatment and never asked for it. I love that Portland is low-key like that. \\n\\nNaomi Pomeroy seated us herself, and was attentive throughout the meal, rolling up her sleeves and replacing silverware, filling water glasses, and describing dishes the entire night. Our other server was equally friendly and knowledgeable. Service was excellent, and the meal was perfectly paced. \\n\\nThe menu changes weekly, so it's hard to give a review solely based on the food. Having said that, this is Beast, and Naomi is a culinary superstar, so how can you NOT talk about the food? The wonderful, wonderful food...\\n\\n1. Our first course was a spring wild leek and fish chowder with salt cod and a meyer lemon croquette. It was smooth and velvety and the perfect starter. The fresh bread and European style butter were amazing in their own regard. \\n\\n2. Next up was the charcuterie plate. This is in regular rotation on the menu, and blew away any and all other charcuterie plates we've had. Ours included a chicken liver mousse on leaf lard cracker, squab breast terrine, black garlic and hazelnut blood sausage, steak tartare and quail egg on toast, cured duck breast, and the highly regarded foie gras bon bon that everybody raves about. Everything was amazing, and probably our single most favorite bite of the evening was that steak tartare. The depth of flavor was wonderful, the creamy yolk contrasting with the crunchy toast, followed by the perfectly seasoned tartare. The whole thing was a flavor bomb. \\n\\n3. Our entree was a pork shoulder with pickled mustard seed and apple cider glaze, served with a carrot puree, kale rapine, pommes anna (fancy name for a slice of potato), and brown butter jus. Mmm. The puree was velvety and buttery, and the perfect accompaniment for the tender pork. Divine. \\n\\n4. A small dish of peach and elderberry sorbet came out next as a palate cleanser. Best. Palate. Cleanser. Ever. \\n\\n5. Since the French do things backwards, our next course was a salad. By this point we were starting to feel full, but how could we resist the mixed spring greens with roasted and raw beets, blood orange and campari vinaigrette, and fried ch√®vre? We could not. Again, the flavors melded together in perfect harmony. I wish I could buy a bottle of that vinaigrette. \\n\\n6. Steve at the cheese bar put together a cheese plate next. Cheese plates are fun! This one featured a selection of two cow's milk cheeses and one sheep's milk. They were salty, creamy goodness, served with honey (from local bees, of course), fried and salted marcona almonds, and an armagnac poached prune that was the perfect sweet finish. \\n\\n7. Last but certainly not least was a salted chocolate pot de creme with caramelized bananas, whipped vanilla creme fraiche, and a toasted coconut tuile. Decadent, rich and totally to die for. We ordered a cup of French press coffee each, the perfect foil for this sweet finish to our meal. \\n\\nA few other observations/thoughts: go for the wine pairing. We had generous pours of six different wines (3 whites, 2 reds, 1 rose) and while we are hardly wine experts, these all went well with our courses. The communal seating was fine; considering the meal runs nearly three hours from start to finish, at some point you'll inevitably make conversation with the people around you. I guess this could be a drawback if your fellow patrons are obnoxious, but ours were not. \\n\\nBeast is pricey, no doubt about that. But given the quality of food, variety of courses, and excellent service, it's well worth the price of admission and a must-try Portland hot spot. \\n\\nJust ask the Oscar-winning Hollywood actress who ate there with us!"},{"name":"Earls Kitchen + Bar","address":"5300 No. 3 Road, Unit 304","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"Best happy hour in town.

I think that 49 parallel sources average quality beans and then uses fancy roasting profiles, like alchemists trying to turn lead into gold. Lots of other roasters do the same thing....its a very  competitive business but 49 Parallel has better marketing tactics than many and this enables them to charge premium prices. Judging by how busy they are on weekends they are the proletariat's choice so there really is no accounting for taste.  Most of their coffees have a characteristic astringent quality and a bitter unpleasant aftertaste coupled with a heavy Tim Hortons style caffeine buzz.  They try to compensate for bean quality by pulling shots from the fanciest espresso machines and grinders in town but it doesn't work. Their baristas seem to be exceptionally skilled so it is too bad they don't have the best coffee to work with. The premises are very clean, including bathrooms but I noticed a fly buzzing around in their donut display case, although as a health conscious diner I would not have tried one anyway.

My other friend got a salmon dish which was also very well liked also! My parents and I shared the meatball appetizer which was really good, and started with their appetizer salads as well.

And you'll get lots of cheap ingredients and few expensive ones, no matter what time of day it is or what you order. You'll find no complexity or even tradition in the flavors of any of the offerings.

I wish I was making this up. \\n\\nYes, I've heard all the hype, and believed most of it as well. I mean, just look at all the positive reviews here on Yelp, right? \\n\\nBut I'm not one for standing in line, so we waited for the buzz to die down a bit before venturing into Commercial Drive's latest culinary offering. We managed to find it on a Wednesday night about half an hour before closing with no line up and a few tables to choose from, so in we went. \\n\\nThe person working the door was friendly and helpful, and helped us make some choices pretty quickly. We ordered a half chicken (medium spicy), corn bread, and fries. It all came out pretty quickly too. \\n\\nFirst, the good; the fries were crinkled, dusted with a medium spice and drizzled with a mayo sauce of some sort, or maybe just mayo. And they were pretty decent. The corn bread had a jalapeno pepper on it, was plenty moist, and was plenty tasty. \\n\\nBut the chicken.... the star of the show, right? Well, yes, well cooked, moist, crispy, but... BUT.... we puzzled over what was wrong with it from the first bite. My friend started with a wing, I took a thigh. She looked at me with an odd expression. I knew what she was thinking. While nothing tasted \\"off\\" it felt like there was too much paprika or something in the spice, too much spice, too much of whatever it is Downlow sprinkles all over their chicken to give it flavour. You know when you buy flavoured potato chips, that all the chips are the same, but different crap is sprinkled on each one to make it a \\"flavour\\"? And you know how they never taste like what they taste like? That's how the chicken was. It tasted like what a medium spicy fried chicken potato chip would taste like. Which is not what a medium spicy piece of fried chicken should taste like. If that makes sense. Which it might not, which is fine because it's not important, because....\\n\\nMy friend ate a wing and part of a breast. I ate a thigh and a drumstick. We split the fries and corn bread. We drank water. And about 3 hours later I was throwing up. First it was acidic bile rank with chicken spice, and then after an hour of fighting my gut it all came up, chicken, corn bread, fries and all, and I was happy to do so because the entire meal wasn't sitting well. For the record, I'm not a picky eater, not afraid of spice, and am a huge fan of fried chicken, wings, spicy etc etc. There was nothing about the meal that was unusual as far as what I usually eat. And my stomach isn't sensitive in any way.\\n\\nThen, in the morning, after a night of fighting some sort of indigestion or gut ache, my friend also threw up. We weren't drinking, I haven't thrown up in over a decade, and was deathly ill with the flu last time I did. My friend isn't a picky eater and doesn't make a habit of throwing up after a meal either. \\n\\nOf everything we both ate this day, this is the only thing we shared so it was definitely the chicken both timing and food wise. And we both ended up in our respective bathrooms emptying our stomachs into the toilet. Not good. VERY not good. Two people throwing up after dinner gets an automatic one star rating.

I haven't eaten there since that last review in 2013.  I recently learned that they have a Sunday brunch.  Against my better judgement I decided it try it. Things can change for the better.  So I arrived Sunday morning and was impressed with the beautiful layout of the buffet.  The first thing visible is an impressive dessert table with a wide variety of cake, cheese cake, cookies and other yummy looking things as well as a large assortment of fresh fruit  Well, this is off to a good start, I thought.  There were quite a few metal containers containing hot food.  I asked which ones contained dishes without meat.  There were two.  One contained rice and beans.  The other contained juevos rancheros which is a dish that I typically love.  The rest were loaded with all sorts of meat that really looked dried out and over cooked to me.  I am a vegetarian, so my evaluation of the taste of meat carries little weight; however I know overcooked meat when I see it.  There was also a table of not too interesting looking salads and a taco table with a limited amount of ingredients to make your own tacos.  They also custom make omelets to order. The staff was very diligent in keeping the food looking good and the buffet tables neat.  They seemed to have a sense of pride where that was concerned. They were also very friendly. Here's the thing: if I am going to pay $14.99 to have a Sunday brunch at a Mexican restaurant then I expect a nice array of Mexican foods in addition to more conventional breakfast dishes..  The Mexican offerings were scarce and sub par.  I had a made to order veggie omelet  which was over cooked and dry.  I doctored it up with a white cheese sauce which was good and some hot sauce.  The juevos ranchero was horrible \\nin every respect.  I think it is not a dish suited to being kept heated for an extended period of time.  I made myself some nachos at the taco bar.  They were OK, but obviously missing from the offered ingredients was guacamole.  I had a small piece of waffle.  I love crispy waffles.  But this was soggy. I chose a slice of yummy looking crumb cake for dessert.  I love crumb cake.  But it turned out to be flavored with almond.  I do not like almond flavoring so that turned out to be a disappointment as well, although I can not blame the restaurant for my personal taste  in ingredients.  I ended with a churro that was good.  My bill was over $18.00 for the buffet and a coke.  It was not nearly worth the money. I would have been disappointed paying $6.99 for the quality of the food. \\n\\nIn addition the place had been remodeled to a boring modern look --- nothing Mexican about it.  Previously it had been a delightful Mexican theme with colorful carved chairs. That too was a disappointment --- no good food, no good atmosphere.\\n\\nSo, once a gain I will be boycotting the Azeteca grill.  You'll have to come up with some amazing and creative ad campaign to draw me back again."},{"name":"Eleven at Reunion Resort","address":"7593 Gathering Dr","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3","text":"Amazing views and amazing service!

All the food was lackluster, lacking spice and texture, was dry or fatty or greasy. I was adventurous enough for the Feet but they were a terrible mess of bones and skin--and hardly any meat.

We were given one paper napkin each, none our food was good for chopsticks, and we didn't have forks.

There are two large tables surrounding the open kitchen where they prepare your meal. They seat you at one of their communal dining tables and once seated, they serve you coffee. \\n\\nPineapple Clafoutis/Whipped Creme Fraiche/Candied Bacon - first course. Souffle like and tastes eggy with hints of pineapple and reminded me very much of an egg tart. I ended up eating the candied bacon (which was slight sweet and crispy) separately because I didn't enjoy the flavor combination as much. It was sweeter than I had imagined for a first course so it felt like it was dessert.\\n\\nBelgian Endive & Dungeness Crab Salad/Toasted Pine Nuts/Cara Cara Oranges/Mint Creme Friache - second course. The flavors were unique and intentional. It was light and refreshing compared to the sweet first course. I would have wanted this as my first course.\\n\\nBraised Wagyu Short Rib/Oyster Mushrooms, Purple Brussel Sprouts, Turnips, Delicata Squash, Cauliflower, Confit Potatoes/Poached Duck Egg/Dijon Hollandaise - third course. The poached egg ran perfectly. The hollandaise sauce was one of the better ones I've had and the potatoes were crispy, something I wish the brussel sprouts had. The brussel sprouts seemed like it was steamed or boiled. The braised wagyu short rib was good but nothing amazing. The toast was sprinkled with salt and perfectly paired with the flavors. This course didn't stand out like the first two courses because it seemed like something you could get at another brunch spot.\\n\\nPetit Fours - chocolate cake, cherry sugar gelatin cube, and a cream puff with lemon cream. The petit fours were a disappointment. The chocolate cake and cream puff were nothing out of the ordinary. The cherry sugar gelatin cube was unique and I think I'd be a bigger fan if I liked cherry. I felt like the first course would have made a better end to the meal.\\n\\nOverall, the experience was interesting. Even though it was a communal dining arrangement, it felt cliquey with each party isolating themselves. The servers would stand on one of the ends of the table to describe each course but it was hard to hear if you were at the other end. Only the first and second course truly stood out to me and I expected more for a $40 brunch."},{"name":"Pour Wine Bar","address":"2755 NE Broadway","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Oh jeez.

Of course, it's decorated with masks and beads from the various Crewes you would encounter at Mardi Gras, but I just really appreciate the bar area.  I was there for Friday Happy Hour and indulged in the 2 for 1 draft special.  I opted for the Franziskaner, a wheat beer that comes from the oldest privately-owned brewery in Munich.

The 12 inch sandwich accompanied by delicious, fresh, and hot Cajun Fries and my Franziskaner was the perfect meal to help me believe in the fortunes of life again.

Our server, Summer, came over with GLOVES ON HER HANDS, grabbed our menus, then led us to a table.  Those gloves remained on her hands while she made and served our drinks, and she also ran another tables' food out with them on, never changing them.  Our coffee cup had lipstick and coffee stains on it, and when we asked for a replacement she kind of rolled her eyes.  My friend said she was higher than a kite and therefore shouldn't be at work, but I don't know about that.\\n\\nThe jelly holder on the table had sticky syrup (?) residue on it, and when I dug into it for strawberry jelly (only one at the bottom) the holder had tiny black specks coating the bottom of it that resembled rodent droppings.  No jelly for me I guess. \\n\\nWhen I asked if I could swap provolone cheese in for the swiss that comes in the Philly omelet, Summer replied \\"...um, we have Swiss.\\"  So I got swiss.  We all ordered and decided to start with loaded fries (it was late night after bar hopping) and those came out.  Halfway through them, Summer wandered by, looked at our table, and yelled \\"OH YOUR RANCH!\\" before running to the kitchen and running back with ranch.  We didn't order ranch, didn't need it, didn't want it, but we were charged for it.   I waited for about 15 minutes for her to remember I had asked for silverware.  Meanwhile, the other server was busting her ass with her now 4 or so tables, but still managed to drop our food off at our table because Summer was nowhere to be found. \\n\\nWe had to flag her down after my friend realized that his sandwich, The Chicken Avocado Sandwich, didn't have avocados on it.  When we showed her, she said \\"Oh yeah, that's because we're out of avocados.\\"  I mean...really?!  Why would you let someone order an item like that if you're out of the second ingredient?  He should have had the choice to refuse to pay a premium price for a basic chicken sandwich.  He asked if he could order something else instead, and Summer replied \\"Why wouldn't you just eat that?  It's the same but without avocados.\\"  My friend stared at her, dumbfounded, for about a minute before she sighed and asked what he wanted instead.  We didn't see her again for quite some time.\\n\\nWhen our bill came, my small apple juice was actually charged as a large, and the ranch was on the bill, and when we pointed that out to her, she said she'd take care of it, rolled her eyes, then came back and told us that she'd give us 15% off.  So...instead of just taking the ranch and the large off and putting the small on, you're going to give us a discount we didn't ask for?  THEN, she said this:  I need your card so I can run your bill, but I need to know how much of a tip you're going to leave me before I run your card, because with the discount it will be the same amount it should have been without the juice and ranch, but I need to know how much you want to tip.  My boyfriend said he wasn't comfortable with her doing that, and asked if she could just bring us the bill and we'd pay normally at the counter, because none of what she said makes sense.  She came back with a bill that still had the large apple juice on it and a military discount applied.  We are not military.\\n\\nShe held the bill and again asked us to fill out the tip portion of the bill before she would run our credit card....that's not how this works, honey.  She seemed confused and frustrated, but really, who in their right mind fills out a tip and signs a bill before the card has even been swiped!  After arguing with her about that, she left in a huff to run the card for JUST the amount of the bill, but then stood by our table while my boyfriend signed it.  So rude!  Awkward and intrusive. \\n\\n I guess sometimes you really should \\"just say no\\"....especially at work, Summer.\\n\\nI would never go here again, not clean, service is horrible, there's no sense of management around at all, and they can't be making money if they allow their servers to just give away discounts instead of properly charging people for their food.

I ordered the Big Ass Breakfast Sandwich (classy name, huh?) and, when it arrived, I wasn't sure exactly how I was supposed to eat it. It was the thickly sliced and toasted heel of a loaf of artisan white bread spread with cream cheese, topped with two slices of bacon, two eggs over easy, and three sizable leaves of lettuce. With this came another thick slice of dry toast (not the heel) and some very tasty and well seasoned hash browns which they called a rosti. Now, had this been your basic breakfast of eggs, bacon, hash browns, and toast, this would have been a five-star review, particularly considering the excellent friendly service I received from the smiling waitperson. As it was, knowing that, if I tried to go all Guy Fietti and eat this as an actual sandwich, I would end up wearing it, I just ate it in pieces, chasing the pointless lettuce around the plate as I went along. It was fine overall, though I did ask for butter as I'm not a fan of dry toast. \\n\\nThe price for this was reasonable - $13.50 for breakfast and often refilled coffee - but, next time, I'll ask for a larger plate and to hold the lettuce."},{"name":"Claypot Hot Pot & BBQ","address":"8291 Alexandra Road, Unit 105","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"Service is super slow!!!!!

I had a restaurant.com certificate so we decided to try our luck on a Friday night. Well, the place I think has two floors, so maybe there were more folks dining downstairs (doubtful), but the main room we were sitting in was dead. Granted, it was freezing outside and no events going on at the TD Garden that night, so maybe they normally are a little busier. \\n\\nAnyways - our waiter was nice, along with everyone else working. The menu wasn't quite what I was expecting - it just didn't seem authentic. The bread was very good, as was the caprese we had as a starter. I ordered the scampi for my meal, and it just seemed like pasta in a bowl of butter with way too much parsley, 6 shrimp on top. The shrimp were good. My boyfriend had the lobster ravioli, which didn't have much filling and were drowning in a red tomato sauce. The prices are decent, but the portions also aren't much.

I normally sit at the bar, where the service is always friendly and is usually fairly quick. So if you're worried that's what I would recommend. \\n\\nSpeaking of the bar, they've got good drink prices and cheap buckets, and the people are pretty friendly. \\n\\nHonestly this place would have a 5 star rating from me except that I think their price point is slightly too high. I think they charge just like $2 too much on most orders. \\n\\nAnyway, give it a try and tell me what you think. Let me know if sitting at the bar helped!"},{"name":"Central Bistro","address":"34 Summer St, Fl 2","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This gem of a French bistro is tucked away in the ugly duckling that is Downtown Crossing.

As everyone can see the owner is very rude and unapologetic about it, which is exactly what we experienced last night.

We had a total pour of one glass of wine each elsewhere while we Christmas shopped for about 2.5 hours. What a complete lie to try and save yourself from your despicable behavior. I hate liars. What a joke. Nice try. Please get your facts straight, as you obviously had no clue what was going on watching from the back bar. No one from our table opened the door for our 2 friends who tried to come in the locked door 1 minute after I walked in with my other 2 friends. It was actually another patron sitting close to the door who kindly opened the door. Also, the 2 friends who were already there before us and had tables and chairs for us had ordered food and were waiting on their food. The other 5 of us were just coming in for a glass of wine. The other patrons were either eating, waiting on food or drinking wine. We would not have kept you open any longer. 2 of us who were at the table already offered to give up 2 seats and leave, so the other 2 can take their place and that's when we received the 2nd head shake from you with your aggressive demeanor and unfriendly facial expression. You were too coward to just come over and talk to us a few feet away and instead had the waiter go back and forth. That poor waiter! The fact of the matter is that you and your manager handled this situation extremely poorly. Had you or your manager come over and said \\"I'm so sorry ladies, but we close at 9pm (it was 9:01pm), so we can't let your 2 other friends in and have to be strict about that, so we can get our employees home and get things cleaned up. We would love for y'all to come back and see us another time.\\" then all would have been well. Let's be truthful in that your manager is the one who joined in my quiet conversation with the waiter and decided to make a \\"scene\\" by making it a louder 3-person conversation. I have friends who own successful restaurants and high-end bars and I also dine out at much nicer establishments monthly. This is not the way you treat people. There were also other patrons in disbelief that you turned our friends away the way you did, so don't try and act like you treated us poorly for the sake of other patrons. Your response shows your true character. I've never written a negative review for a restaurant on here and you completely earned it. My review is the truth. I have nothing to gain to from it. You on the other hand are flat out lying and conjuring up false statements to try and save yourself from your public display of disrespect.

The large restaurant is decorated with dark woods and a heavy cowboy motif, rather than being the small, light, and airy venue I associate with \\"cafe'\\". \\n\\nI was further nonplussed with the breakfast food. I pushed myself away from the eggs Benedict (slightly, and with difficulty) to try the salmon hash. It was described as salmon, roasted potatoes, and a poached egg, all covered with Hollandaise. Since it came with an English muffin, if was close enough to my longtime favorite to sound wonderful. Sadly, it under-delivered. The salmon was overcooked, looking like canned tuna, though it tasted OK. My egg was notably undercooked, with much of the white still liquid. And this was the most flavorless Hollandaise I've had in a long time, which made me less upset that there was only a tablespoon of it on my plate. Even the smoked jalapeno Hollandaise I tried on the side lacked any real bite. My friends' omelets were unimpressive, with the ingredients simply folded in the middle rather than being mixed in with the egg at all. On the plus side, we all agreed that the potatoes were quite savory and the English muffin was delicious. \\n\\nCombining the bar island with the raised, metal fire pit, I could see this being a decent place to hang out on a winter evening for some brandy eggnog or other warming drink."},{"name":"Panda Express","address":"2972 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"I love pandas.

More about it:\\n*****\\nI. FOOD & DRINK\\nOn the large wall to the right of the counter is their large menu. They sell half to whole birds, as well as individual parts (wings, drumsticks, thighs, and breasts.) They also have a chicken biscuit and chicken sandwich, several different types of Southern sides, and a variety of sauces, too.\\n\\nI've tasted their wings, drumsticks, and thighs, and have tried everything with and without the Tennessee hot. (It does not taste better hot, so go with the regular.) The meat of the actual chicken is very tender and juicy. (Not dry at all! Woot woot!) Unfortunately, they're a bit inconsistent when it comes to the actual frying of the chicken. Sometimes it's overly fried. Sometimes it's not. It's frustrating.\\n\\nWhen it's not overly fried, in contrast to other fried chickens I've had, the skin is airy, crunchy, and quite awesome. \\n\\nI've also eaten a side of their succotash and didn't love all too much. But I look forward to trying their coleslaw, mac and cheese, and buttermilk roll in the future. \\n\\nFor drinks, they have beer, wine, and sweet tea, coke, etc...\\n\\nII. SERVICE\\nLike the frying of the chicken, I think it's hit or miss as well. The folks working behind the counter are very nice, but each time I've went there they've forgotten part of my order. And when you're in a rush, it can be frustrating.\\n\\nIII. ATMOSPHERE/ D√âCOR\\nIt's a stall at Ponce City Market, so don't expect a full-out restaurant. Ponce City Market does, however, have tables placed throughout so finding seating isn't too challenging. If worst comes to worst, take your meal to the second floor where there's always ample space.\\n\\nIV.

The flavors melded together perfectly. Our final dish was the shakshuka. You can have it with or without sausage - we chose to have it with.

They have a decent beer list as well. Here's the rub - I ordered the pork chop special for my entree, and it was very good. My fellow diners and I commented on how a waiter never tells you the prices of a special, and that you have to expect it to be the most expensive thing they're offering that night. They also had a ribeye special and a salmon special, so I'm thinking probably a few more dollars than the highest priced entree, with the steak and fish being the high dollar items of the night. Wrong. When the bill came I was shocked to see that ONE pork chop was $26! The highest menu entree was $15. How much would the ribeye have been - $40? I'm not a cheap person - I'll drop $$$$ on a meal w/o blinking, even when the bank account is low - but I felt misled. I know I could've asked the waiter the price before ordering, but that's kind of tacky, and I usually trust that the place isn't out to screw you. And let's all be honest here, this place is in College Park (where I happen to live, so I'm not trying to be condescending) where you don't expect to pay Buckhead prices.

There were a lot of unfamiliar terms to me but the explanations on the menu are great (as was google) and the service was really helpful. For brunch, there are sandwiches and salads available.\\n\\nFor appetizers, we've had:\\nDOLMA - stuffed grape leaves. Light and delicious, with fresh yogurt.\\nHAYDARI - fresh Turkish yogurt with garlic melted butter -- oozy, pungent, and thick. Fantastic with bread.\\nHUMMUS - also thick and rich. We got too full eating this with all the other dips we have, but if you want fresh hummus this is the place to get it.\\n\\nFor mains, we've had:\\nKURU FASUYLE - white beans with tomatoes and lamb. It was delicious and fulfilling, like a home cooked stew. Came with a generous helping of rice -- all for around $10 during lunch!\\nLAZ PANCAKES - for brunch - Turkish pancakes topped with honey, cheese, and jam.

To make even matters worse-we asked for cheese on our pasta.

As my family and I looked closely to everyone in the restaurant the waiters put cheese on their dish with no problems. We are so disappointed  and disgusted how we were treated. Maybe the second time we went they were more racist. I don't know, I'm not making assumptions but we were the only people of color there.

Yes it was seared perfectly but who wants to eat a big chunk of fat on any given day?

I wish I had taken some pictures to show what we received. When the server cleared our dishes, she asked us twice if we wanted to pack the leftover steak (aka. the seared fat) and seemed shocked when we politely declined.\\n\\nThis definitely left us feeling disappointed in our selection and while the scallops were perfect and the soft shell crab delicious, overall we weren't as excited as we had been when we arrived.

Easy Tiger was out of the sausage when we arrived for lunch in the middle of the day. (I could understand if we were in between lunch and dinner.)

That's a pretty big problem. If you can't keep up with the number of orders when your kitchen is fully staffed, then you really need to reduce the number of customers you have at one time.

They aren't the best with bringing out the food either, as the BBQ Brisket Quesadillas we ordered took around 20 minutes to come out to our table, and by that time we were ready to go.\\n\\nI wasn't impressed with the portion size at all. The Pulled Chicken was just above the size of a slider, and was about 60% bun, 40% chicken. Same goes for the brisket. I did enjoy the brisket, although it was a bit dry, and needed more juice to it. The BBQ sauces were not on the tables there, you had to go over to the counter to get them, but very little signage pointing them out. We also had the sides of Mac & Cheese, and Potato Salad. I'll say the Mac & Cheese was fine, but nothing to write home about; and after one bite of the Potato salad, I'd had enough. Like I said above, the brisket quesadillas came out pretty late, but when we had them they were actually good. A bit dry, but in a good way.\\n\\nInside the restaurant, all the tables are massive picnic style tables, so not much privacy, and it isn't too comfortable to sit on the seats.

I understand there was not a lot of space but please treat customers with grace and respect no matter how busy it gets."},{"name":"Wonton Asian Kitchen","address":"1230 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"I like this place cause it's right outside my neighborhood and it's a great alternative to Pei Wei, which has fell off in recent years. Their wontons are delicious and their noodle dishes have amazing ingredients and flavor. It's a solid spot that I enjoy visiting every once in awhile."},{"name":"Winsor Dim Sum Caf√©","address":"10 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Not as well known as the other dim sum places around Boston, Winsor is very cozy and operates on a menu system instead of the traditional carts that are usually used.  This place only has about 7 or so tables so sharing tables might be required if you come with a small group or by yourself.  \\n\\nFirst of all, the taste is pretty much on par with the other dim sum restaurants, maybe a little better.  The food variety that they offer is also pretty standard, but something interesting they have with their menu is a picture menu so you have a better understanding of what you're actually ordering.  The wait time was also on par with standard dim sum, but instead of waiting for carts to come around all your food comes straight from the kitchen at once.  A positive with this is that the food is made fresh to order instead of sitting in the carts (sometimes the food might be sitting out a little longer if they're in the carts).  \\n\\nI would say that the only thing bad is the small size of the restaurant and that the food portions may be a bit smaller as well (shumai is about half the size as other dim sum places).  Also it was a little annoying that they couldn't take credit cards if the bill was under $20 (which in the end, was okay as I had enough cash).  \\n\\nOverall a must visit."},{"name":"Sweet Hereafter","address":"3326 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I love this place so hard. The food is fantastic; I really appreciate pretending like I'm being healthy by eating a vegan bowl with a giant 32 oz. bourbon and vodka cocktail. \\n\\nI was here last night (roughly my 213th visit) to meet some friends. I tend to get the jerk bowl - I don't know if that's the right name, but it's tofu in a jerk sauce with coconut kale, black beans, and brown rice. It's so simple and so tasty. I also like their Hereafter (see? priorities - I know the name of the cocktail at least) which is a huge cocktail with vodka, bourbon, iced tea, and potentially something else. I always am able to take about half of my food home, which is nice to have at home after drinking a couple of those huge cocktails. \\n\\nThe space is nice too. The vibe is a little edgy but cozy, and they have a great covered outdoor area as well as an uncovered area. I've never sat in the uncovered area because smokers are always out there, but there's a sweet fire pit. Also, the bathrooms are always clean. That's super nice."},{"name":"Manny's Original Chophouse","address":"884 West State Road 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"3","text":"This place is wonderful. The atmosphere is so cool. The $$$$$$ are awesome and the food can't be beat.put this place on your list for sure!!!!!"},{"name":"House Of Tandoor","address":"81 Union St","city":"Newton","stars":"4","text":"I've only gone once, but definitely plan to come back. \\nStarted with shrimp pakora, something I haven't seen elsewhere. Perfectly cooked and presented. Onward to the vegetable momo, Nepalese dumplings. Fresh, delicious, and healthy.\\n\\nFinished with the goat curry--very pleased that it wasn't typical. They didn't use any cream (as far as I can tell) to develop the flavor, which had some real depth. The rice and paratha bread that we ordered were standard but well done.\\n\\nService was slow, but it's new and I expect them to improve. Staff couldn't be nicer. So happy Newton has an Indian restaurant again."},{"name":"Honjin Ramen","address":"12-228 Schoolhouse Street","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"3.5","text":"Quick service. Nice ambience. Had always been curious about this restaurant and because there aren't a lot of ramen placed in the area it was on the bucket list; wasn't disappointed. Fair portion size, the noodle texture was great and the chasu topping tasted excellent. One star off because the broth wasn't as tastey as I'd hoped and needed me to add some side table condiments to give it a little kick."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"What an incredible place and food.   We had the Moroccan Chicken Hash (5 stars) , Polenta & Sausage Ragu (5 stars) , Fried Green BLT (2 1/2 stars) , French Toast (4 stars)  , and the Toast with jelly and cheese (3 stars).\\n\\nAll of dishes were super great with the exception of the BLT which was just okay, had a little to much lettuce and the green tomatoes are lost in the flavoured mayonnaise and bacon..  \\n\\nWe're definitely coming back and have many many more menu items to try.   It is so hard to pick from all of the choices.  \\n\\nNote that the toast, french toast and BLT all use the same bread, so there is some sameness there, it would have been nice to have some variance in the bread products."},{"name":"GT Roti & Curry","address":"1790 W Sand Lake Rd, Ste B130","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I was excited to try Guayanese food for the very first time. I had the potato balls and the goat curry which came with rice, chickpeas and potatoes, and roti. I also had the Banana Soda as recommended by the owner/operator, Prem.\\n\\nFirst, this place is clean. I love small, mom & pop type restaurants, but hygiene is always a concern. GT Roti did not disappoint. \\n\\nThe service was warm and personable.\\n\\nOn to the food. It was pretty good. I am South Asian, so it was interesting to try food that was so Indian inspired (even the names of the dishes), but had its own distinct Guayanese flavors.\\n\\nThe goat curry was good, I wish there was a bit more liquid curry with it. The potato and peas was solid. I prefer a little bit more salt. The potato balls are a delicous and safe bet for anyone playing it safe. The roti was so yummy! It is similar to an Indian paratha, but less greasy and more fluffy. My favorite thing was the tamarind sauce. I poured that on everything... it upped the flavor factor immediately. \\n\\nI need to go back to try the Doubles and the other curries. I think this time I will get wraps."},{"name":"Chicken Guy!","address":"1506 E Buena Vista Dr, Ste A","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"One of the more affordable options in Disney Springs. I tried the chicken sandwich and it was good. A lot of lettuce. Fast service - there was a line, but it moved quickly. I received a buzzer, which I placed on a circle on the table and my food was delivered right to me. Lots of sauce options. A little better than Chick Fil-A. Casual. Outdoor seating available."},{"name":"Nomadic Beerworks","address":"3804 Woodbury Dr, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"Top notch beers, awesome service.
