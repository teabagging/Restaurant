The texture of the breading was close (eggy, very dense) but the fact that they used breast meat took away from some of the chicken-sourced fattiness that you get in typical korean fried chicken.

This is serious food coma food and you really must come prepared for this as it'll knock you out. The hashbrowns that I ordered along with this meal was by far one of the best I've had in a while.

I really dig it! Ok, onto the great food at Little Bird. Really attentive service, our waitress checked on us all the time to see how everything was but was not too overbearing. She also would not take a plate off our table until we finished every last bite, which I thought was cute :) We had the foie gras torchon. Yes, its something I was looking forward to having since we can't get it in California anymore. The foie gras was very rich and creamy, really good texture and paired with the most delicious venus grapes I've ever had. Those tiny little gems just explodes in your mouth! Husband thought the foie gras could've used more duck flavor, but overall, it was still very good because of the texture and he really enjoyed the toasted yogurt bread that they paired it with. It was something we have not tried before. We also had the ricotta gnocchi, this was very good, its like a nice warm mouthful of cheesy pasta with heirloom tomatoes, watercress and rich sauce. For me, that was ultimate comfort food. Gnocchi was very soft and not chewy or dense. We also had their field greens salad, which had heirloom tomatoes, arugula, watercress and some other greens and cheese. The greens alone are a little sharp, but once you pair it with the cheese and tomatoes that makes it good. For the entree, we shared the crispy rabbit. This was ok, its basically a fried rabbit, it could've been chicken and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. It was served over heirloom tomatoes, by this point I was a little tired of heirloom tomatoes. I forgot to mention that the baguette that they brought out at the beginning was the best best best baguette we've had. Tempted to call them up to ask them where they get their baguettes, for the next time we visit Portland. For dessert, I had a decaf and husband had toasted coconut ice cream served with a madeline.

My other friend wanted to bring a cake or cupcakes to celebrate our friend's birthday. So, she contacted the Murphy's that morning and asked if she could bring in an outside cake or cupcakes. She was advised when she called that she could bring in an outside cake, however, if she were to use the restaurant's plates then there would be a $3 cake fee per person. The person also said that $3 would cover the plating and that ice cream would be placed on the plate. My friend asked if we didn't use the plates would there be a fee, and the woman said no. \\n\\nSo, my friend went out and brought her own plates and cupcakes to bring to the restaurant last night. Upon arriving at Murphy's, my friend asked the hostess again about the cupcakes to check and make sure that she could bring it into the restaurant. The hostess gave the same response as the person on the phone. She said that if we utilized their plates then there would be a $3 fee added per person and it would cover the plating and ice cream would be added to the plate. We said okay and brought the cupcakes in. \\n\\nAs we sat at the table, a manager came over and said that the hostess said that she wanted to clear up any confusion about the cake fee. We said we had no questions and were not confused. There was no confusion when we heard the same thing twice from two representatives at the restaurant. The manager walked away. \\n\\nOnce we were done with dinner, the waiter came over with the dessert menu and told the birthday girl that dessert was free for her. We ordered from their dessert menu as well as pulled out our own cupcakes. They were cupcakes so they did not need to be on plates. We even gave our waiter one of the cupcakes. \\n\\nThe waiter came out with our bills and there was a cake charge of not $3 but $3.75. So, not only was it not the $3 that was quoted but it was $3.75. Also, we adhered to their policies of not having the waiter plate these cupcakes, or utilize their dishes.  So, I asked to speak to a manager to get this straightened out.  A medium build, white lady with dark hair came to the table. I explained the situation and asked why there was a $3.75 cake charge added to each of our bills. She said \\"Well I came to your table earlier to talk about confusion about the cake fee, and you said that you had no questions. We have to charge you when you bring in outside cake regardless because it is GA State Law and it is a part of our insurance policy. If you call back tomorrow and say that you have food poisoning we will be covered. The $3.75 fee is to protect us against any outside food that you bring in here. There is nothing that I can do to get around the GA State Law. And I'm sorry that this happened on a birthday that you didn't know the law or policies.\\" She walked away. \\n\\nAfter she walked away we took out our phones and researched GA State Law and the rules against bringing an outside cake to a restaurant. What we found clearly indicated that the manager at Murphy's was definitely making up stuff and lying. If you don't want people to bring in outside cake, just say that we don't accept outside cakes, do not make up a story about GA State Law and insurance liabilities. I also believe had we not been a table full of black people then the conversation would've been different and we wouldn't have been charged.

We had one of those meals at Magnolia. \\n\\nThat isn't to say that the food was bad, but that it was just extremely underwhelming. First of all, for such a vegetarian friendly place, it was hard to find any vegan options on the menu. Everything vegetarian relied on cheese, egg, or some sort of dairy based cream sauce. We eventually ended up with two entrees - the veggie stir fry (minus the honey lime sauce) and the black bean \\"entree\\" (minus the cheese, sour cream and substitute hummus for the corn pancake). \\n\\nThe stir fry consisted of tofu and assorted vegetables stir fried in what seemed like WAY too much soy sauce on top of brown rice. It came with three corn tortillas. I think I had about three times the RDA of sodium in this single meal. The rice was a little overcooked, and the veggies weren't quite crisp, but weren't soggy yet. The black bean entree was literally just a bowl of black beans with sliced tomato and avocado on top, and it came with a side of hummus and a piece of lettuce. Both were pretty bland as well.\\n\\nFor these two entrees, a bottle of Franziskaner, a tea and tip we left just under $30. Pretty steep for a couple of sub-par vegan options and some drinks. I could have even given three stars if not for the general apathy/surliness of our two waiters (we must have come in the middle of a shift change), but no.

The fries are definitely good for at least 2-3 people, so plan on sharing that with at least 1 or 2 other friends if you decide to get it. \\n\\nIt was hard to savor each artery-clogging bite, but eating that made me want to wear a red and black flannel plaid shirt, grow out a mustache, and chop down a tree after.

It also helps when the workers are super friendly, and at the bar you can easily see how your meal is being made. \\n\\nIf locals tend to come here often, I don't blame them.

The number of what I would deem exceptional isn't quite as vast as it could be. True, there are plenty of solid to good burgers, and there is nothing wrong with having a consistent fall-back option when it comes to our friend, the hamburger. Lincoln in Southie may have my current favorite pizza anywhere in the Greater Boston area, (Although I love the original Regina's, to me Lincoln is right there) and as I soon found out, also makes one the better burgers. The noise level is painfully high for a semi-old dude such as myself on a Thursday night, and the servers and hostesses are brash, cocky and not exactly welcoming which is a bit of a letdown.\\n\\nThe Lincoln burger is successful in part because of the price tag, a mere $12 in the land of the $16 burger, but maybe in Southie the gourmet burger price tag has yet to hit the streets. This burger is not bashful, and is full of very rich, dominating flavors, not a bad thing in my book. Coming with a very generous helping of caramelized onions, Tilamook cheddar and bacon aioli, there is nothing subtle about this one. With a bun eerily reminiscent of the lovely soft, Portuguese bun at Back Bay Social Club, it's well built from the top down, the modest beef juices easily caught by the bun, which has the ideal light as a feather and just crispy texture that is the gold standard. The thick patty, made from a combination of Prime Chuck Roll and Prime Rib Cap meat, has a lusciousness and an airiness that I don't think I've ever experienced in a burger before. Light as if you are eating a tenderloin, but with the fat of a more complex cut of beef. The seasoning and doneness left a little to be desired, however, just short on salt, and more medium across the board than the requested medium-rare. But it had a good amount of juiciness that dripped through from start to finish, being held in by the bun all the while. The aforementioned onions are dominant to a fault: borderline burnt in parts, they end up imparting too bitter of a flavor and there are a whole lot of them that are unavoidable as part of the burger experience. The cheddar is perfectly melted and gooey, and the bacon aioli is a magical accompaniment that is loaded with smokey, porky, goodness, creating even more fat than I thought possible. You won't find any lettuce or tomato on this burger, which I rarely care about anyway, but this might be the one time where a nice, light and fresh component wouldn't have been completely unwelcome. The fries are finger-size thickness, skin-on and crispy and salted just enough, they are textbook and a pleasure, and a healthy dose of fresh rosemary makes them stand-out. A side of the popular Grillo's pickle joins the plate, but is unexpectedly very, very spicy. I'm normally fine with heat, but the pickle often acts as the fresh component that I can't help but regrettably take a big bite out of, only to find the spiciness too daunting on the palate in this situation.\\n\\nMostly, the Lincoln burger is a big winner. I can't help but wonder if I'd love it as much if it were $3 or $4 more, and if the low price tag is its biggest asset. But, the unusual cuts of beef used and the killer bacon aioli are two of the reasons that really make it stand out. French fries are first rate and the bun is among the better fits on a burger I've had in recent memory. Poor service might knock it down a peg or two, but there's often too much stock on the front of the house, when all I want is a great burger anyway. Easily one of the better burger and fries combo around, the Lincoln burger will not disappoint."},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Amazing breakfast, reasonably priced, and great service.

I consider myself to be pretty adventurous, food-wise, so I like option 4.   Once inside FoMu, I saw that they had Lavender ice cream.  I gave it a try and really liked it.

Exposed plywood walls with a light wash of color...maybe cool in concept, like the exposed USB that keeps popping up around town (hello, Boxer Ramen).

Started at the bar because we were waiting for one person to show up. I think it may have been a good thing. Ordered up some raw bar goodies and wine. The oysters and raw clams were delicious. You order them on a sushi-style sheet which has accurate descriptions of the distinctive flavors of each oyster. If you need more info, the staff is super knowledgeable about the oysters. We each ordered wine by the glass. They have an extensive \\"by the glass\\" list and the staff is also super knowledgeable about the wines. And this was only the beginning...\\n\\nWhen seated, we split two apps at the table--the fried clams were light and delicious, but the salt cod salad stole the show. In addition to salt cod, the salad also had some crispy lamb and pancetta, so delicious! The menu here was quite creative--combos of ingredients that you never would think of and may sound a bit weird, but somehow turn out amazing. I picked cod again for my entree. It was cooked up with an artichoke crust, served over whipped potatoes with a berry, smoked mussel and citrus salad. I ate every last bite of this, and would have licked the plate if I wasn't out at a nice restaurant with folks I work with. The other most memorable dish of the night was the sturgeon, which was served up with black currant caviar  jam and a plum graham cracker panzanella--the coworkers couldn't stop raving about it.\\n\\nThe place is small and they don't take reservations, so I recommend that you go early.

In these situations, you can use MC as a counter suggestion: \\"How about we try this better place, Magnolia Caf√©?\\"\\n\\nThe menu is not as unique as I remembered, so you just have your standard chips and salsa, sandwiches, and enchiladas; there is also a variety of breakfast items, mostly just stick-to-your-ribs items, many of which are egg-centric. I learned that their veggie burger was a garden burger. They advertise it nicely: a mix of nuts, cheese, beans, and vegetables.  After that disappointment, I went and ordered the turkey Reuben, which was another disappointment. \\n\\nOne side of the sandwich was soggy, the turkey was plain and lukewarm, and the cheese was not quite melted. I will say that the spice in the Russian dressing adds a nice kick. Summary: needs to be hotter, crispier, and more flavorful. Perhaps I made a mistake and assumed that a turkey Reuben could be awesome. I guess you just cannot beat corned beef.\\n\\nMy home fries were (ice) dome fries; by that, I mean they were not piping hot. They were not all the way crispy, and some were even soggy.

There were us 2 adults and 3 children. The restaurant was somewhat empty for a Friday night as we had been there about 5 times prior. The waitress came over after about 7-8 minutes and took our order for drinks. We also ordered 2 appetizers, calamari and Queso and chips. The drinks came about 10 minutes after ordering and the appetizers about 25 minutes after sitting down. The appetizers were room temperature. I figured they had them sitting in the back. So about 40 minutes after getting the appetizers we got the meals. Out of the 5 meals 2 were cold, not room temp but cold. And the pizza was room temp. I thought in the time between ordering and getting the food that it had been sitting as the waitress was off chatting with other waitresses at the register and hanging out. \\nI looked around to see if a manager was around and asked another waitress to get the manager. I watched as the waitress spoke to the manager as the manager had been talking to a cook by the bar for 15 minutes. The waitress pointed and the manager went back to talking to the cook and laughing. 5 minutes later the manager came to the table. No introduction or hello it was did you need me? I said are you the manager and she said yes. I said our meals are cold. She said oh I don't understand, I said this fry is literally cold, feel it! She stepped back and I said no, really feel it and put it in her hand. She said oh.. is that the only issue? I told her the steak meal is cold, the asparagus and potato is cold and the grilled ham and cheese is cold. She said we can heat up the steak meal and make new fries. I said what about the sandwich she said if we need to I guess we can make another.\\nJump forward, the sandwich meal comes back 15 minutes later by another separate waitress. The Steak 30-40 minutes after. The manager never came back to ask how everything was. \\nShe did comp the meal for $7.00 total.

I've  been trying to get here for months to try them out, I live damn near an hour away. I finally come with a chica yelper who was equally as excited as myself. The shop is organized, clean, tidy, visually appealing on all levels. No complaints there. They offer a variety of coffees, teas, and I think I saw chai's. No complaints there. The customer service was great and informative, no complaints there. The price point $15 for 6 donuts, was not worth it. I got the buttermilk bar, 2 yeast donuts with chocolate, 2 yeast donuts with vanilla bean, and a bacon something donut for my homegirl. She enjoyed hers. I had the chocolate this morning and it was so damn thick and dense! I had to chew it about 10 times before I could swallow it down and even still it was like swallowing the heel of a boot. With yeast donuts I expect some sort of fluffyness. This donut was so dense it could double as a floatation device! Picture eating a roll from o charleys or golden corral thats a week old with frosting on it. **weeps** i wanted to like this place! The butter milk bar was awful, when I say awful it cracked in crumbles like that bread frodo and Sam ate in lord of the rings. it was dry, dense like cornmeal cornbread, and if it wasn't for the glaze it would've been flavorless. I haven't tried the vanilla bean one yet. **shrugs** I ate 1/2 of the donut with chocolate and gave the other 1/2 to my 6 year old to try. I asked him did he like it.

We asks for some recommendations and ordered several dishes. \\n\\nThe first thing that arrived was a half order of the radicchio, it was great, our server recommended a half order rather than a full, which was perfect. Next was the octopus, M loved it, I tried it, but am not as adventurous as him. I had the foie gras, it was served with bread that reminded me of French toast and a pineapple jam. The foie was whole, which is a win, but the dish was just way too sweet for me. I guess I prefer it savory. M loves Brussels sprouts and does not get them at home often. They were so good here, like candy, I could have licked the place. The star of the meal was the steak frites, some of the best I have ever had. The fries are amazing and the meat was well seasoned and tender, the tarragon butter mimicked the flavors of a traditional bearnaise, really phenomenal.\\n\\nIncluding gratuity our meal was under $100. After having a very disappointing dinner the week before at another small plates place with a similar price point Tasty N Alder shows how to do small plates right.

Cafe Deia was hands down the only and best morning recommendation.  The menu is creative, interesting and varied regarding breakfast sandwich styles and ingredients. They also serve waffles, french toast eggs and oatmeal.  Their \\"most famous\\" morning sandwich is not even on the menu. It's egg, cheese, avacado and fresh tomato on a croissant and is pressed in a panini press.  We've come twice and my partner has had that one both times. They told us that it is their most famous and that is ordered almost every other sandwich. Sure enough the next person that walked in ordered it without picking up the menu. I had French Toast Bacon on my first visit and it was fine. I had \\"Egg-cellent\\" (egg, cheddar, pepper jack and sausage with grilled red and yellow peppers and onions on an English muffin) on our 2nd visit and it far exceeded my expectations.  Prep was good, taste was great and presentation was really nice. (Sorry no pic, I ate it before I decide to review. You'll have to go and see)\\nTwo sandwiches,  1 coffee and all under 17$ \\nBut... the real, authentic highlight of coming here is the amazing, generous and most welcoming greeting and ease of being from the owner and others who work here. Very refreshing and a compelling reason to come and return . There is an easy attitude about the place and the neighborhood.

I had the pleasure of trying out Hyatt's newest hotel in the Atlanta/Dunwoody area this past week for 3 days! Now I'm no amateur when it comes to knowing a good hotel when I stay at one, hence my DIAMOND tier level of membership with HYATT. I will start with the check in process. Fairly simple and easy yet it seemed that the young woman checking me in either was new or didn't know what she was doing because typically check in takes no longer then 5 minutes. As normal I started off with my name and handed over my id and credit card. She then proceeded to confirm my reservation but then had to step away for 3-4 minutes to \\"check with her manager\\" about something and I just sat there like \\"umm is everything ok\\" she assured it was and then told me all of the benefits the Diamond members received at this location. Very courteous and professional however after staying at many Hyatt properties this was the first to not highlight the fact about my late check out which in the end resulted in a later issue. Once I got to my upgraded executive suite I was satisfied.  I think I may have been just a tab bit underwhelmed because I'm use to staying at the Grand Hyatt in Buckhead. Not fair to compare but clearly I was missing that extra edge and also the Grand Club Lounge! I was unaware this hotel didn't have one. Oh well the free breakfast at Villa Christina was a NIGHTMARE but I'll review that one separately. Overall with a few bumps in the road management took care of my issues very professionally and I appreciate that which is why i will remain a loyal Hyatt customer!

It was a busy time on a Friday night but still early, around 5:30 so I was surprised they were getting so busy. We were seated right away so that was nice.  First off we ordered our usual round of hurricanes with an extra shot of the Bacardi Select (same rum they use for the floater). Our server eventually brought the drinks but with the wrong rum on the side. I told her it was the wrong rum, but she said \\"go ahead and try it\\" like I didn't know what I was talking about. After some time, I told here again it was the wrong rum and she did then bring a shot of the Select (obviously a much darker color) and only charged for the one shot. I am not so petty to nit pick on such a small mistake but I don't like being treated like I don't know what I am talking about either.\\n\\nAnyway, the food was off as well. My wife had the shrimp and grits and the dish was WAY salty. They didn't completely cook the andouille sausage on top either, so it was not the best iteration of this dish we have had there by a long shot. The Catfish Lizzie was good but quite a bit spicier etouffee sauce than usual, which is really okay with me but made it such that I couldn't share with my sweetie. Finally, the beignets were under cooked just enough to be doughy in the middle. Not the typical stellar food experience we have had here, hopefully this was a one off. We will certainly be back here soon to give them a chance to redeem themselves."},{"name":"Osteria Nino","address":"19 3rd Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"3.5","text":"Meh is the best word to describe our dinner here.  We went on a Saturday, which was probably a mistake.  The whole 3rd Avenue plaza area for some reason seems to attract every single suburban Bostonian on a Saturday, and parking is impossible.  That said, we were able to grab a table in the bar/lounge area without a wait to be seated.  There seemed to be a wait for the dining room, though not as much as I would have expected giving the complete lack of parking.\\n\\nOnce we were seated, water came quickly.  It took a bit for the waiter to make his way back for us to order our drinks, and then even longer for bread.  We'd probably been sitting for about fifteen minutes before the bread came.  It was decent enough bread, and the olive oil for dipping on the table was better than expected, but when you're hungry you don't want to wait that long for just bread.  \\n\\nMy cocktail took even longer than the bread to arrive, and it wasn't anything special--just the Farmer's Lemonade off the menu.  The drink tasted good--it was sparkling wine, blueberry vodka, and lemon--but didn't strike me as anything a farmer would ever drink (which I realize isn't the point). I would order it again, I guess, but it wasn't worth the 20-minute wait.  Again, I know it was Saturday and they were busy.  Fine, I get it, but maybe have more than one or two people working the bar if it's that busy?  Next time, I will get wine, as people seemed to get wine quickly.\\n\\nOnce we were finally able to order food, we got pretty basic items--he had the caccio e peppe (and was warned that it was peppery), and I got the chicken broccoli ziti.  He found his dish too peppery, but I thought it was quite good.  It had a nice floral flavor from fresh pepper with the burn that sneaks up on you.  The pasta was about 30 seconds shy of al dente, though.  My dish was fine, though a bit bland.  Even he thought it was bland.  There's more than just broccoli for green stuff in there, which is fine.  The chicken looked as though they might have tried to coat it with flour and crisp it up, but it was just gummy and not terribly flavorful.  The broccoli had the most flavor of anything.  My pasta, too, was shy of al dente.  \\n\\nWould we eat here again?  Maaaaaybe, and then only if we're in the area and craving Italian food.  I won't be rushing back for any reason.  The food just wasn't quite good enough, and the service wasn't great.

But bottom line is I had bad food and worse service in a highly uncomfortable atmosphere. I planned to grab breakfast here as my final stop during a weekend trip to Portland. I was on my own so hoped to get a seat at the bar and be out of the way for a quick meal. Having read the reviews about limited space and long waits, I got there early and was at the door when it opened. Here's where the trouble started. Even though I was standing right in front of her, the hostess literally sat every other party around me before even acknowledging my existence when I loudly announced, \\"Hi,\\" as she chatted with a waitress about her night. I thought maybe she'd assumed I was with a larger party (and I didn't exactly need a table) so brushed it off. By this time, the bar had filled up so she directed me to the standing counter, along with several other couples behind me. Not ideal, but whatever. Next, I waited for literally 21 minutes (I counted) for the server to speak to me, though she managed to serve BOTH couples standing on either side of me and another that walked up 10 minutes after I arrived. When she approached a 4th couple, I cut in and asked if I should order from her. She said yes, and then took care of the other couple before asking what I wanted. I ordered coffee, a specialty sausage omelette, and a side of Brussels sprout. I figured I would be gone quick enough to not warrant taking one of the two seats that would open if a couple left the bar. The sprouts came out first and were great - crispy but syrupy sweet. The omelette came out next and tasted like feet. I took one bite and decided to abandon the cause and get my check. 27 minutes later, I was able to close out with the waitress and get the heck out.

I've eaten here about ten times now, evidence enough that the food is fine.\\n\\nMy favorite dishes are the navrattan korma (vegetable korma), the malai kofta (potato dumpling in cream sauce), the palak paneer (Indian cheese in spinach sauce), and the yellow dahl (lentils). The yellow dahl is by far the healthiest, and cheapest, choice. Pretty much all of the dishes are under $10, but ordering naan or even pappadum will put you at closer to $12 or $13. \\n\\nUnfortunately, Teji's isn't perfect, and I eat here less often than I did when they first opened. First off, the food has become significantly greasier recently. The last time I ordered navrattan korma, it was swimming in oil. Secondly, I prefer my Indian food a little bit spicy. Teji's has a \\"star\\" system of one, two, or three star spicy. Every time I have attempted the \\"one star spicy,\\" which should be what I think of as \\"medium,\\" the food is INEDIBLY hot.

Even once when I ordered in AND at here were about 5 actual patrons in the store (something that you will never see around meantime fyi cuz it's always packed), I still waited upwards of 20 minutes in the store to make a total of about 35 minutes.

It wasn't too bad but probably wouldn't get it again.    \\n\\nYou can get the steak and cheese (with NOTHING in it but that) for 9 bucks.  I guess you are really just paying for the 16 inch french bread.  \\n\\nSpaghetti and mussels was decent. Alot of mussels but actual mussels were small. Flavor was okay because I just like mussels but the spaghetti itself wasn't that great. \\n\\nMeatballs were homemade and tasted normal.   \\n\\n40 bucks for a spaghetti with meatballs, spaghetti with mussels and steak bomb.\\n\\nOverall, I rather just make my own spaghetti and mussels or meatballs cause I can make it better.....

So does  that mean British people enjoy tough meat and you imported the meat from the old country to torture us Yanks? Or did you toughen it up somehow so we could get an authentic British dining experience?? ! I think not. Disney buys their meat domestically so it's hard to see how such a poor cut of beef could be served. One of my dinner companions had a steak also and it was equally tough. Another friend has the Bangers and Mash and it was deemed inedible. I like pretty simple fare so it's not as if we wanted some fancy-schmantzy food for our collective hundred bucks but we did expect food to be both tasty and edible. I won't return here ever again. I should point out that the little Fish & Chips shop connected to the Rose & Crown has excellent food and I've heard that they serve the same  fish in the R & C.

Theirs has the dense, smooth, vaguely chewy consistency of the creamiest of ice creams despite containing not a drop of real butterfat.

It is also a good place for a casual date but, it can be relatively loud.  My only negative comment is the could use new restrooms an more of them. They have tvs for watching the game as well.

I think mostly it was the high ceilings, which COULD be a standard for Atlantic Station restaurants, maybe?...but I have no idea cuz I try to avoid the crowds here most of the time.\\n\\nWhile we were waiting for everyone to arrive, I read up on the reviews here and was prepared for the sticker shock. We ordered 2 pomegranate margaritas, 2 guacamole (one spicy and one mild), a variety of entrees varying from the 18oz short ribs to the beef & seafood stew (this was me), and a chocolate cake.\\n\\nOverall, the guac was good, but only worth $5 maybe, definitely not $12. There was also no distinguishable difference between the spicy and non-spicy version, so we ended up using all the spicy green sauce that they provide on the side. The margaritas were so strong that they were almost undrinkable, which is crazy because my group of friends usually make the strongest and worst tasting drinks in the world, in my opinion. They described it as drinking Sour Patch Kids soaked in tequila, except only the sour part, no sweet whatsoever.\\n\\nWith the entrees, we all got something different and had rice, beans, and sweet potato fries to share family-style. Everyone agreed that food was generally good for a few bites but quickly got kind of gross, mostly due to too much salt or sauce. The rice was definitely hard and undercooked, beans were the same as what you could get at any Mexican place, and the sweet potato fries were nothing special.\\n\\nThe worst food of the night, though, was easily the chocolate cake. It was so dry that it crumbled as soon as someone stabbed their fork into it. Luckily, it came with a ton of sauce (in this case, chocolate) just like every other dish they serve so that made it almost edible.\\n\\nTotal damage for 2 drinks, 2 apps, 7 entrees, and 3 sides was around $275...so around $40/person. We asked the waiter if he could split the check and apparently they can only split one check up to 4 ways so we split it 4 ways and then had to do some addition divying up on our own.\\n\\nSorry, Rosa Mexicano, I won't be coming back."},{"name":"Garrido's","address":"360 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Here is the truth about Garridos- it has a beautiful patio and the chips an salsa are really excellent- everything else is \\"ok\\" at best.

The atmosphere feels luxurious with its dark, warm finishes and candlelight. Still, they don't take themselves too seriously - offering a sweatpants Sunday brunch and craft cocktail menu with drinks playfully named after movie references and tongue in cheek plays on words. \\n\\nTrust me when I tell you, the cocktail and food menus give you a little bit of everything you'd ever want. Between a friend and I, we were able to try nearly all of the \\"Bites\\" and a couple of the \\"Shares,\\" which, let me tell you was no easy feat due to the generous portions of even their smaller plates. Everything we tried was incredible, down to the truffle ketchup that comes with their hand cut fries. I swear I could drink this stuff; I (only half jokingly) asked for a large vat of it to go and haven't stopped dreaming about it since. Side note, as a vegetarian, I love that the menu has so many great options.\\n\\nAlso between two of us, we tried more than our share of the cocktails - I won't give you a number, because we were quite indulgent - and all of them were fantastic. It's clear a lot of thought went into every cocktail on the list and that expertise and attention to detail go into the preparation of each drink. I highly recommend Randy's Smashed (warning: it's so good it's gone in no time and then you'll want another) and The Fizz (so refreshing, and the aroma of burnt rosemary is honestly intoxicating). With such fresh, unique ingredients and complex flavors, you'd expect a higher price tag, but the most expensive cocktail rings in at only $13; which honestly is nothing when I realize that I can't even get a Ketel soda for that price at other locations throughout the city. \\n\\nOverall, HIGHLY recommended!

In all the years I have been going to this place I can not remember a single time the staff was awesome. They come of smug and rush you to get out so they can fill the table asap. I have to say the person who does the hiring must not eat their or have friends who do because the are oblivious to the poor quality in the waitstaff. \\n\\nAs for the food, its some good and healthy stuff. I enjoy the cheeseburgers here because they are always cooked perfectly and never burned although the home fries have been known to be undercooked at this location. Honestly if you want good Magnolia cafe you might want to head to the other location off Lake Austin Blvd. For some reason the food quality is better and the staff their seems to be more on their game. \\n\\nSo in short, its okay but they need to step it up and quit thinking they are gods gift to Austin.

And i say okay. 25 minutes later my order comes out and they apologize and say they gave me extra meat. Already running late i nod and leave right away. At home i realize they forgot to give me the lettuce cheese and sour cream that is supposed to come with the half pound of fajitas and they gave me an extra box of meat with half chicken and steak.

Tiffany & Co wanted the space where Kamei Royale used to be so Kamei had to move according to some articles online. It's just a fact of downtown businesses that rent is sky high and it really cuts into your bottom line. After coming here for over 15 years, I would have to say that the food doesn't justify the price points.\\n\\nThe menu now has been truncated from the former menu before the move. There are less items being offered for price points that are too high. For a much lower price, I can go to many other Japanese run sushi restaurants in the suburbs for the same quality of food.\\n\\nWhile some of the rolls are unique, there aren't many items on the menu I would really eat anymore. I really liked the boat that was around $30, but I didn't see it when I went. Besides the specialty rolls, I don't see the competitive advantage/uniqueness of Kamei Royale anymore.\\n\\nMany of the front of house staff have continued on with Kamei at the new location and you do get good service with them.

You should go. I loved the Fried Korean Chicken, but the other five in my party thought the Whole Frog was the best. It was a \\"healthy\\" debate....Ha, see what I did there. \\n\\nAnd I must say, the lovely hostess who took our party of 4 turned 6 turned late and kept me updated on the new wait times was a doll! And she even pointed me to a coffee shop to wait for my friends and offered to call me when our table was ready. One extra star for her!\\n\\nBut really the reason I'm writing is because the waitress we had was so rude and condescending, and then had the nerve to add insult to injury. \\n\\nIt started with little things, \\"Is there something not to miss on your menu?\\" we asked. \\n\\n\\"Well there's nothing that you can't not miss. But that's just to say that everything is ordered all the time on our menu.\\"\\n\\nI'm sorry...what? \\n\\nThen after taking 3 drink orders, while I'm holding the menu looking at drinks and after checking a 4th person's ID she walks away. Then comes back and with the other's drinks and says to guy #4, \\"Was there something you wanted to order\\" as if he had just given her his ID for fun. And it was his fault he didn't get his order in..or mine for that matter. \\n\\nAnd I loved the, \\"since I couldn't be here for all of the food to come out, are we waiting on anything else?\\" As if to preemptively pass the buck in case something wasn't right. Admittedly (and surprisingly), it was. It was actually awesome. And the food runners who brought the food to the table were plenty pleasant. But I digress, back to the server. It wasn't just me...throughout our meal everyone at the table had discussions of her attitude/demeanor/portland flair (depending on how optimistic the outlook) but my final straw was when we paid. \\n\\nWe paid with 6 cards, (Now I know, what you're thinking, but just let me get through it) all split evenly, and then, amongst ourselves, determined who would and wouldn't tip based on who had drinks vs. coffee vs. water. I gathered all slips and her pens and set them together nicely after being sternly directed to leave her a signed copy. (I'm sorry, what native American goes to a restaurant and doesn't KNOW to leave the copy. I've been in the industry long enough to get that people forget..and that sucks, but I don't need to be told like a child to leave it). As is my custom, I always out of habit write 'cash' on a tip line. Even if there's no cash. Because a line or a zero or just writing nothing is too easy to forge. I write it at Starbucks, I write it a a steakhouse. Actually, this forged a discussion with my co-workers and a little laugh upon our exit. And even after her bad service and a very flippant hand toss of a goodbye on the way out, we still left her over 20% tip. DO YOU KNOW THIS WOMAN RAN OUTSIDE AND ASKED ME WHERE HER CASH WAS. And when I told her the tip was on the other slips, she proceeded to chastise me for my \\"restaurant etiquette\\". I have never had such an experience. And believe me, I know it sucks when someone adds wrong on a credit card and you don't get the extra $10 they meant to leave. Or they grab the slip and you can see the 20% tip on the unsigned copy imprint, but get nothing. I get it. But to run after someone to ask for more than a 20% tip. I actually wanted to ask for my money back. It took everything inside my soul not to read her right then and there and then ask for her manager. So I'm doing the next best thing and hoping her manager reads it here. \\n\\nSo there you have it. Try all of the foods, come with a few friends so you can try a smattering of things.

I had grilled broccoli that our waitress recommended (good recommendation) and a side salad that was fresh and tasty.

They don't take reservations or names over the phone, so you have to come to the restaurant, place your name, and wait. It was 11AM on a Wednesday afternoon that my boyfriend and I decided to eat lunch here. The server took our names down and stated that it would be around an hour and a half for a table to open up for the two of us. Not surprising, since the restaurant is very small. We used this wait time as a way to explore the rest of North End: visiting Paul Revere's house, tasting cannolis from Mike's Pastry, etc. Good news was that it was not even an hour when we were called to come to the table. They give you around 10 minutes to come back, so don't stray too far!\\n\\nOysters (prices vary): There is a paper checklist of the oysters served by Neptune's Oyster. There is a variety to choose from and all running around $3-$4 an oyster. I'm no oyster connoisseur, but they were so fresh, full of flavor, and each very distinct. If I didn't have more food coming, I would've ordered more on the spot!\\n\\nLobster Roll (MKT price): The lobster roll comes in two choices, hot with butter or cold with mayonnaise. From everyone I asked, always get hot to get the most bang for your buck! Butter makes everything better, and the hot roll doesn't come with any filler like the cold roll does. If you aren't too hungry or don't have a big appetite, I suggest sharing. This is what my boyfriend and I did and we were still able to leave pretty satiated -- even with his monstrous appetite. The roll was topped with a mountain of giant lobster pieces, came out piping hot, and was accompanied by French fries. The only downside I have is that the butter made the bun very soggy. However, this did not deter us from the amazing flavors of the lobster.\\n\\nService: Service was great. Had no problems and I had to give a great round of applause to her as she was able to keep all her busy tables satisfied with an unwavering smile. \\n\\nI totally get why people would get turned off from coming.

The waitress was helpful with recommendations and knowledgeable about all the dishes we asked about, but it was still hard to choose.\\n\\nI ordered the Bim Bop bacon and eggs - this dish has rice, bean sprouts, carrots, bacon, and an egg that comes out in a hot skillet bowl. You stir it all around and it basically makes a fried rice. About a year ago, I tried a different variation of this for a dinner meal that was wonderful, but the one at Tasty was pretty average. It was flavorful, but the kimchi really overpowered the bacon or egg - it ended up just tasting like a kimchi fried rice, which wasn't what I exactly had pictured for my breakfast.\\n\\nThe other people in my party ordered the Polenta and Sugo (delicious, but a little heavy), the Blanc omelette (which was absolutely soaked in oil so my friend could only finish part of it), the Bacon Cheddar and Egg sandwich (probably the best meal of the group), and the Northwest Migas (one of the vegetarian options, but it wasn't anything special).\\n\\nI would like to return to Tasty n Alder to try different dishes to see if my opinion changes.

Now, for some reason two different groups that were sat after we had our soup still received their lobster rolls before we did.  Naughty.  Completely naughty.  But, we did eventually get ours.  It was delicious.  It was a good portion of lobster chunks on a roll with butter all up in it.  Soooo good.  And the fries that came with it were also tastey.

YAY! So excited.  I met the owner on Thursday night as I just happened to be in Allston eating at Grasshopper and then walked down for a drink at Deep Ellum and saw NoMu's doors opened. The owner gave me a taste of 3 different ice creams.\\n\\nThe regular ice cream had just come in that day - see the pictures I posted for all the flavors.  I tired the dark and stormy and the cake batter. Delicious! Reminds me of Lula's in NYC.   My favorite was the dark and stormy, I want to come back tonight when they are officially open and try it.  I also got to try the soft serve ice cream he is testing out.  It was ok - needs a little work. He asked me for my honest opinion and I told him the chocolate was right on, super smooth, but the vanilla was a little to crystallized.  I guess they are working on the formula.  I told him to get in touch with Like No Udder in Providence who has mastered soft serve.\\n\\nSo here's the Scoop on the place!\\n\\n- ALL VEGAN.  Yes all the ice cream is nondairy and is coconut based.  They have been making dairy and non dairy ice cream in Watertown and have been making the coconut ice cream flavors for Veggie Planet, Live Alive, etc. for the past 1.5 years. Since their nondairy has done so well they thought to open up a shop.\\n\\n- The owner who I met is really nice. His name is Hin (sp?).  He and his wife are opening the shop. They had a soft opening last night for close friends and family.  The public opening is tonight! So go!\\n\\n- All the toppings are vegan.  Even the gummie bears do not contain gelatin. However if you are a super strict vegan and care about sugar then avoid the sprinkles (jimmies as they say here in New England) and Oreos.  I personally don't care too much about sugar when I'm going out so I will load my ice cream with yummy toppings.\\n\\n- Coffee.  The place will also be serving as a cafe using George Howell's famous coffee. They will have almond, coconut, and soy milk to choose from. No dairy milk! YAY.\\n\\n- Smoothies - see the picture for the 8 or so smoothies you can choose from.\\n\\n- They are also selling Taza chocolate and some packaged cookies.\\n\\n- There is limited seating so it may get packed on a summer night.\\n\\nAnyway this place is awesome and I can't wait to try more.  Between Grasshopper, Peace o Pie, and NoMu, Boston finally has our very own vegan mall (take that Portland!) or should I say vegan corner!"},{"name":"PONKO Chicken","address":"2896 Chamblee Tucker Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Another reason I love Yelp.

Everything was just so...damn...good. Made me wanna sing a slow jam and make some babies. But I was here on business so I'll stick to the deets on the food. \\n\\nFirst, y'all have to understand how pretty this place is. And I reserve the word \\"pretty\\" for when I'm absolutely giddy about something. Since we had a big group, we were seated in a cavernous booth that gave us a great view of the whole dining room. There is an open kitchen so you can watch people making the fresh, flaky bread sticks. There is a U-shaped bar front and center of the dining room, which seemed unique to me since most restaurants have the two areas more separated. \\n\\nEveryone gets breadsticks and a bean/pesto (?) dipping sauce. As the waiter brought our sticks he accidentally dropped them table! Or so we thought; apparently that's how they're served--right on the table. Breadsticks had a nice flaky crunch that was replicated in the pizza crust.\\n\\nLobster pizza was beyond decadent. The blend of sharp, soft cheese paired with the buttery lobster meat like nothing I've ever had on some crust. Loved it. Want more of it.\\n\\nFor an entree, I got the special of the night: striped sea bass with gnocchi and tempura lobster tail. The sea bass was ridiculously moist and had a bolder flavor than say, cod. Turns a light dish into something meatier. I don't think I've ever had gnocchi (!) so I can't assess if it was good or not. But I did enjoy it and I can't imagine this place would serve anything less than stellar based on the other food.\\n\\nDesserts: Oh man. We wound up ordering just about everything on the dessert menu (which is longer than what is on their website). So in quick recap fashion, here they go:\\n- Turbinado Sugar Pavlova (meringue) w/ Lemon Cream & Native Strawberries: If you like lemon bars or lemon tarts, do not pass this up.\\n- Chocolate cake in a mug with ice cream: includes a molten chocolate lava center that effing ROCKS when the ice cream melts a little.\\n- Chocolate Creme Brulee: the least interesting of the bunch.\\n- Walnut butter cake with pear: tasty, but not a highlight.\\n\\nAfter the meal I immediately called Brendan and said, \\"The next time we get an idea to go to the Liberty Hotel for food and drinks, let's just do it...after confirming that we have enough money to enjoy ourselves.\\" That's how I would sum this up: If you've got the means, Scampo is the way."},{"name":"Aprisa Mexican Cuisine","address":"2311 SE 8th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"A two-star joint that gets an extra star due to phenomenal service.\\n\\nWe drove up to Aprisa last night and tried to navigate our options.  The helpful fellow on the screen was very patient with us as we asked many questions and determined what was safe for cilantro-haters to eat.  Their rice has cilantro in it, so I opted not to get a burrito, and chose the carnitas instead.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the carnitas are not actually carnitas at all.  Instead of being shredded or in small chunks with a lovely juicy/crispy texture, they were large, flat slabs of grilled pork.  The order board is not very well-lit, so it was hard to see some of the platos they were offering, and maybe I could have seen what the \\"carnitas\\" actually looked like before taking a chance on them.  As others have complained, they were also quite bland, although my SO was very pleased with the spice level of the hot salsa in the burrito.\\n\\nThey do have quite a few other options, so I'm willing to try them again and re-evaluate my opinion.  However, it would be nice if they had a cilantro-free rice option since rice is such a staple and included with pretty much everything they offer.  Q'doba, for instance, keeps plain rice on hand for those with cilantro-hating genes (there are more of us than you think!), and I love them for it, but I'd really like to frequent a local place instead, if possible."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This restaurant delivers the goods when it comes to a top-notch great seafood.

There. I said it. Never have I been to a restaurant where I've wanted to eat everything on the menu. Everything. \\n\\nThis was my second time at LB. The first time was with my family over the holidays. We sat at a lovely, round table near the front window which was perfect for a larger party. We ordered about a dozen appetizers and salads to sample the menu along with a myriad of entrees.  Everyone was immersed in their food with nothing but the sound of \\"Mmmmms\\" of deliciousness emitted from the table.\\n\\nThis time, G and I went as a couple. Our first experience there was sheer perfection and I was worried that there was potential for a letdown. Thankfully, I was not disappointed.\\n\\nWe ordered the charcuterie plate to start. The terrine, liver pate, foie gras, pickles et al is definitely one of the better charcuterie plates in Portland (maybe second only to Olympic Provisions.) The foie gras cr√®me brulee is an absolute treat. I've tasted nothing like it. I ordered the special (which I typically do in a place like this; it gives the chef an opportunity to use seasonal ingredients and also to shine.)  I had pomfret (like mini- marlin) served with grilled asparagus, crab hollandaise and a fried squash blossom stuffed with crab mousseline. It was delicate and exquisite. G had the cassoulet of duck leg. It was elegantly prepared and delightful (and filling!)  For dessert we had the lemon pot de cr√®me and it was wonderful.\\n\\nThe atmosphere reminds G of New Orleans, a place he is very fond of. There are French influences in the decor, but it's not ornate or frilly. The walls are an aqua-ish blue, the ceiling is tin, the wood accents are dark. Deer antlers pepper the walls which adds a masculine touch. The service is impeccable and friendly without being over the top. If you have to wait for your table (regardless of how long) the hostess will offer to order you a cocktail or glass of wine. And if you happen to like Manhattans, you will not be let down. I promise.\\n\\nLittle Bird is definitely one of the best restaurants in Portland.  And please make sure to order something more adventurous than the burger.

The place was so packed I couldn't even find a place to stand while waiting the promised ten minutes, so I headed outside in search of a lobster roll for my husband at home. (See my Skipjack's review for details. It was delightful!)\\n\\nWhen I returned, my sandwich was waiting. It was monstrously huge. Chewy, whole-grain wheat bread could have used a bit more salt, but I loved it anyway.

It used to be a moderately classy place to eat.  Service is always going to vary no matter where you choose to eat.  The drinks used to be great too, but, again, that probably depends on who's tending the bar.  Stanford's overall has gone downhill.  When they started messing with their menu too often, it seems like they tried to streamline it and it didn't work.  Then they changed it back--sorta--but too little, too late.  \\n\\nThe music in the bar is far too loud for enjoyable dining and conversation.  Also, in my humble opinion, a place like Stanford's should be playing some nice Jazz not Top 40 Pop since the bulk of their clientele are obviously over 30.  Service can be slow at all their locations even when they aren't particularly busy.  The prices have gone UP!!  We paid $22 for WAY over-salted fish, bland rice and 4 pathetic asparagus stalks, $13 for (very good) mac-n-cheese, $3.50 for mediocre iced tea and $6.50 for a very strong mixed drink.

Well, at 11:28 am on a rainy Sunday, there were already 30+ people in line who basically outsmarted us. Walked in the door with a sad but hopeful face and we we told that it would be an hour wait. They took our phone number and off we went.\\n\\nRight on the dot, they called us to let us know that our table would be ready in 5-10 mins. Let's just say that the hour wait was worth every minute!! We enjoyed a nice tasting of 6 varieties of east coast oysters with an order of one stone crab claw. The most memorable and may be my new favorite is the Kusshi variety. It was so tender, meaty and sightly sweet. Absolutely delicious! The stone crab claw was good but not definitely not fresh, more on the frozen side. \\n\\nWe couldn't skip the hot butter lobstah roll as we were comparing it to the other highly rated restaurants that we've tried on this trip. The hot butter added a nice flavor to the fresh, chunky, sweet lobster on a grilled hot dog bun. The lobster was absolutely delicious and they were very generous with the amount (hey,  it was $29 for a roll). However, I think the buns can use some revision perhaps grilling worth some butter? Think of Pauli's (next door) butter buns... Yum! Let's just say I was still impressed (even with the ok buns) that I order one to go for my dear husband.

We then asked one of the hosts if they could get us a table just to sit and they got the job done! The waiter was awesome. Super friendly and attentive.

I have lived in Atlanta for over 30 years and this has come to be my favorite fine dining experience in the city.  It is one of the few remaining old-time classic restaurants left in Atlanta.  No industrial chic here -- strictly old school elegance.  The setting is certainly unusual (basement of an older condo building), but once you get off the elevator and enter the gently canted walkway, you are transported straight to Tuscany.  The stucco and brick facade is fashioned into an arched entryway -- just like we found in our favorite restaurant in Sienna (Osteria le  Logge).  The atmosphere is understated and quiet.  You can actually talk to your guests and hear them.  The food is great.  Perhaps a bit traditional (no nouvelle cuisine here), but it is perfect Italian comfort food.  In addition to the listed menu items, guests may order off-menu items.  If the chef has the ingredients, he will gladly accommodate you.  My favorite off-menu item has now become my staple: veal chop Milanese.  This pounded, lightly breaded, fried piece of heaven will make you realize how great a well-cooked veal chop can be.  The waiters are old-school, long-timers who know the difference between attentive and annoying (you know what I mean).  I never feel rushed or get the sense they are trying to \\"turn\\" the tables.  Guests are free to linger over their coffee and dolce (and usually do).  I continue to be amazed by the consistent quality of the overall experience.  All my guests (family and clients alike) rave at how good this place is.  It continues to astonish me that La Grotta never makes any of the \\"best of\\" restaurant lists published by the local newspaper critics.  Perhaps it is La Grotta's refusal to be trendy (which is apparently what the reviewers are looking for); but no matter, this place continues to please year after year.

Additionally, I'm a fan of their entree dishes as well-- I have a pretty weak stomach that won't tolerate too much grease, but the food here hits the spot without making me really uncomfortable later on, which says a lot, especially considering the number of places in Chinatown that overdo it on the grease and the MSG.  I'm especially taken with the roti (back when they had it still) and the Pad Thai... oh my god, the Pad Thai.  It might not be the typical noodle dish you might find at a Thai restaurant, but the flat noodles are cooked perfectly, the peanut pieces and chicken compliment each other beautifully, and the sauce is to-die-for-- spicy, salty, and sweet, all at once.  Just beautiful.  \\n\\nLastly, the decor is awesome-- Southeast Asian themed, and made me feel like I was eating in a grass hut by the Pacific.

You could even call this place Easy Street Cafe 2.0 since the owners are the same, they even have the same Easy Street wifi network still setup inside.\\n\\nLet's start with the bad.  The food.  It is terribly overpriced and underwhelming not good.  First I ordered the lobster rolls which were $13.  Presentation was excellent, the food looked great, the portion was shockingly small.  It was pretty much a hot dog bun sliced in half topped with some onions and a couple tiny pieces of lobster.  Maybe I'm jaded since I've had real lobster rolls in Maine which were $7 and included an ENTIRE LOBSTER on a bun.  This had as much meat as a couple of the legs.  Worth about $5 in my opinion.  \\n\\nSince my first $13 course was sparse I ordered the wings second.  These aren't bad.  They were $10 and I was told you get three wings for that price but received 4.  They're pretty much the same as Rooster's does, wings with the wing tips still on, but they go a step farther and leave the leg attached as well.  At Roosters it's about $5 for 5 wings so it's twice the cost here.  The skin was nice and crispy and had a great seasoning.  I tried all three sauces.  The honey was amazing and you could tell it was made with honey.  The sweet wasn't bad either.  The hot was spicy and flavorful.  \\n\\nI had a beer and it was $7.  This particular beer should have been no more than $5.  The guy sitting next to me at the bar wasn't please with the level of service he got, but the service I received was adequate, but not exceptional.\\n\\nHere's what they seemed to have copied from 101BK.  The atmosphere.  Open, rustic concept (dark stones, wood, roughness), all the staff wears tshirts and jeans, menu items such as Shrimp and Grits, Mussels, Hanger steaks, \\"made from scratch\\", a kids menu that they can color, craft beer selection, etc.  But what they missed was the entire point of 101BK...a good cheap place to have excellent food and brews.  Most of the meals on BK's menu, not the apps, are $15 or less.  The kids meals are all around $5 and include two choices of sides, including healthy sides, here they are $6-7 and have no choices and no desserts, doesn't say if it includes a drink either.  This place so wants to be 101BK and steps up to the plate but they obviously strike out when it comes time to swing.  I was severely disappointed.  \\n\\nThe good.  They have valet parking which is great since parking in Powell sucks.  They have an abundance of staff, so service shouldn't be too bad.  The place is very very clean including the bathroom.  The tap list is decent as well.  I'm not sure if they offer any happy hour specials like other gastropubs offering half off the taps from 3-7 or so.  The food has potential but is overprice and lacks flavor.  I think the chef is on the right track but needs to tweak the menu a bit and the prices.  It was a close call between 2-3 stars for me on this one right now, I could see them easily getting four stars as they find their place in the exploding gastropub boom Columbus is currently experiencing.  I will come back and try some other things on the menu and update my review, but I'm afraid after talking to the other patrons that they may strike out as well.\\n\\nAfter trying out the Crafty Pint which I gave 4 stars I had to lower the rating here to 2 stars.  The wings at the Crafty Pint were some of the best I've ever had and the other food I had was exceptionally flavorful and well priced.  Not to mention their draft list was 40 beers long.

This was my fianc√©e and I's first time and my F-I-L's second after many years. \\n\\nFor starters, we had a calamari tapas (which is definitely large enough for three to four), a Caesar salad and a stuffed piquillo pepper. The two sauces for the calamari were perfect and the calamari was cooked perfect, it was tender and not chewy at all. The Caesar salad had amazing dressing and not too much. The stuffed pepper was sweet and delicious. \\n\\nFor entrees, I ordered the braised short rib and scallop paella. It was amazing. Every bite was an explosion of flavor. The short rib was fall apart tender and the scallops were seated perfectly. The red peppers, mushrooms and Brussels sprouts were flavorful and an amazing blend of favors. It reminded me of being back in Spain. My father in law had the pork chop. It was thick and the cream sauce on it was superb. My fianc√©e had the risotto. I tried it and the sweet tomatoes on it were to die for. Since it was restaurant week, my fianc√©e got a dessert of bananas foster cake. I am not a big banana fan but let me tell you, I wish this was on the menu all the time because I would go for just that. The caramel on it and the bananas foster mousse in the thick graham cracker crust was to die for. \\n\\nAnyways, it is a bit pricey but we will definitely go back for RW and to try out their patio and feast on their tapas."},{"name":"Anmol","address":"258 Rantoul St","city":"Beverly","stars":"4.5","text":"Best Indian food around.

Get there early. \\n\\nWhile most prefer the hot-with-butter option, I actually like both the hot and cold versions equally, but they definitely are different. The chilled (huge) chunks of lobster in the cold sandwich are tossed with a light and barely perceptible layer of mayo, just enough to give it some extra flavor. Chilling the lobster also gives it a bit of a different and firmer texture, making it taste a bit more 'substantial.' \\n\\nThat's not to say that the hot lobster roll wasn't swoonworthy, because it definitely was. Melted butter + lobster = infinite WIN. Go with someone else, and try both hot and cold. Die happy.

Every time we visit Boston we end up in the North End and wander over to see what the line is like, and every time we give up at the thought of a two-hour wait for dinner. This trip, though, we happened to stop by in the late afternoon, put our names in for a 45-minute wait, and in less than 15, were receiving a call back that a table was open. Wow! We returned to the restaurant, and as it turned out, the table wasn't quite open yet -- they assured us we would be more comfortable outside (which I think meant THEY would be more comfortable with us outside) and in a few more minutes we were seated at the bar.\\n\\nOnce inside, we understood why the hype was so self-perpetuating. The place is tiny. I counted 14 bar seats and 24 at tables that had, at most, a foot of space between them; some were pushed right next to each other, which must have made for awkward dinner conversation. The bar seating was nice because we got a little more space, but we were all the way at the end, so got to overhear all the personal conversations of the staff members who were coming in and out, arriving for shifts, folding napkins and making after-work plans right in front of us. At the prices we paid, I would have expected a little more professionalism.\\n\\nOur oysters were probably the best I'd ever had: impeccably fresh, briny and sweet, full of the fragrance of the sea. I could have eaten several dozen, but at an average of $3.50 each, we had to stop at six. Their sauces were also amazing -- \\"cocktail\\" was real tomato puree with a dollop of real horseradish, which you could swirl together or enjoy apart, and the mignonette was an amazing combination of sparkling red wine, olive oil, shallots and vinegar. I could have eaten it plain, it was that good!\\n\\nThe entrees were disappointing after such bliss: my husband liked the lobster roll, but said it was pretty standard -- fresh meat in a light mayo dressing on a toasted bun. (I tried a bite, but lobster is not really my thing, so I'm going with his opinion.) My sardine salad was beautiful, but there were a number of problems: the meat, which was perfectly grilled and tasty, was surrounded by tiny bones that had to be removed painstakingly. It's a good thing I wasn't starving or I would have been very frustrated. I love sardines, but wished for a pair of tweezers to properly enjoy them. The salad was clearly organic, so much so that it was gritty from not having been properly washed. The dressing was bright with lemon juice, but overwhelmed the salad -- I couldn't finish it as it was so acidic it had wilted the greens and was threatening to do the same to my tastebuds!\\n\\nWould I come back?

I'm in town for one of the biggest conventions for my industry in America. I walk in by myself so no big party. I asked for a seat and they tell me to sit at the bar because it was faster. It wasn't crowded so a little surprised by this. As I found an empty table in the bar area, I notice nobody was serving the tables. Another couple was sitting as well. As space opened up, this couple moved to sit at the bar. After another 5 mins a space opened next to them, so I sat next to them. We watched as bartenders walked around the bar for approximately 5 mins. Not one acknowledged we were there. Another gentleman came and stood next to me to order a drink. The shift manager comes by and we clearly state that we were there for some time and we weren't acknowledged. The couple had a menu as one was laying at the bar when they sat down. She at first acknowledged the gentleman standing and he politely said \\"They were here first\\". She took the couple's order and then blatantly skipped over me to take the gentleman's order. Not once was I asked if I needed a menu or even if I was drinking. The couple and I were in shocked as she left after getting his drinks. Finally someone came over and I explained my displeasure as to what happened. Nothing offered to accommodate this complete disrespect. When asked who her manger was from the shift manager, she quickly snapped \\"His name and number are on the door\\". Again no apology but excuses. When I call the number on the door, it goes to the store. No surprise. This review may not get acknowledged by their mmanagerial department as they obviously don't care.

I've been dining here for years and never had a problem. My appearance is actually so well known at the restaurant that the staff there actually remember my name whenever I walk in. I'll begin with the overall ambience of the restaurant itself. It's nothing too fancy that you'll feel like you need to \\"dress\\" up when you dine here. It's a very casual restaurant with about 10 or more small tables set up around the restaurant. There is indeed bar seating for those who enjoy to sit at the bar. Small bamboo plants center each table for simple decor. There is also music being played which can be heard from the speakers but isn't bothersome. \\n   The servers are always friendly and informative about the menu and I've never had a complaint about service. I've typically tried every roll on the entire menu after dining here for years and there hasn't been one thing I disliked. I highly recommend starting your dinner or lunch off with a tuna kobachi! It's tuna cubes that are marinated in a sweet and spicy sauce with masago and piled on a bed of cucumber. You can actually make it a quick meal if you order a side of sushi rice to go along with it. I usually order the salmon lover whenever I visit. With this order you'll receive a salmon roll which is cut into 6 pieces as well as 7 pieces of salmon nigiri for around $20. You also receive a salad and a choice of a soup for a starter. The salmon is always very rich and buttery and melts in your mouth. I give it a thumbs up. The ginger dressing that tops the salad has always satisfied me as well. It's sweet and tangy with no bitterness. I genuinely enjoy the miso soup here as well since it's never too salty for my taste. Some Japanese restaurants that serve miso soup may be saltier than others but this one is perfect for my taste. No complaint here.

Considering that it was raining pretty badly at the time, we opted for something nearby so we wouldn't get so badly soaked.  Little Bird looked like a promising option with some popular dishes that we absolutely had to try.\\n\\nWe started off with their bone marrow appetizer which was served with some toast for spreading.  I've got to say that it was divine and we both loved the creaminess and rich flavors.  For our entrees, we shared their special monkfish and their famous Le Pigeon burger with both fries and salad.  I, for one, hope that their burger wasn't made from pigeons, but it was delicious, albeit nothing that was super distinguishable from other fine burgers.  The monkfish tasted a little under-seasoned to me and was otherwise kind of unmemorable.  We also decided to try their French 75 dessert, which turned out to be my favorite dish and mimicked the flavors of the drink perfectly.  The champagne gelee was most impressive to me and had quite a bubbly kick as you ate it.  Definitely a memorable appetizer and dessert though the entrees were just ok.\\n\\nService was really sweet and the restaurant is really cute and intimate.  I don't know that I'd choose to eat here over similarly priced places like Andina though.  Unfortunately the entrees I tried just didn't sing like I hoped they would and while the experience was pleasant and I'd recommend the restaurant as a whole, it just didn't stack up apples to apples.\\n\\nFood: 7/10\\n\\nService: 8/10\\n\\nPrice: $$\\n\\nAtmosphere: 9/10"},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Was in Portland for a wedding and had to try this highly recommended spot.\\n\\nI would have given this 5 stars, but the service was extremely slow for some reason.

To no surprise, the menu is dominated by fresh seafood, leave it to this nitwit to order one of two dishes on the menu that featured beef, it felt like I was ordering off the kids' menu. It's my fault for thinking this burger would be excellent, how could a burger be any good at a seafood restaurant? It's different, I'll give you that, maybe that's why it's so beloved, when do you ever see a burger with fried oysters? I feel that too often people like or dislike their meals before they even eat. Brioche, ground beef, garlic mayo, oysters and relish may sound appealing, but does it actually work well together? In my opinion, it does not, too much burger and way too much bun overwhelm everything else in this burger, despite being pretty well seasoned.\\n\\nLet's start with the beef, as any good burger blogger should do. It's above average in quality, probably nothing more than Chuck but I could be mistaken, and seasoned nicely. But it's over-cooked most of the way, medium about 75% of the burger, then oddly a perfect medium-rare for my last few bites. Either way it's more or less dry and not juicy like a burger should be. I was excited for fried oysters, but whatever attempt that was made at breading these guys was a failure, with only a couple of scattered bread crumbs managing to cling to the oysters, not like a fully breaded offering I was expecting. And there were only three sad little oysters, really not serving much of a purpose other than the addition of the fresh smell of the ocean, which I don't think I need with my burger, but that's just me. The relish offers a nice tang, but it can't stand up to the size of this burger, which is much too big both in the meat category and in the bread category. My old nemesis brioche comes up again, and fails again, and we've seen this too many times before; it's too much bread and it almost never works on a burger, no matter how pretty it looks.\\n\\nThe French Fries are perfect, however, arriving crispy, fried to perfection, and salty in that glorious way that only a French Fry can be. I do believe that the burger could be improved upon by being a bit smaller, I'm not saying every burger has to be thin and griddled just to feed my preference, there's a place in my burger heart for a thick and juicy burger unequivocally, but too often larger burgers initiate more problems. It's not always easy to cook the proper temperature throughout, ingredients get lost along the way (garlic mayo was supposed to be on the burger, could have fooled me) and it can never be harmonious because you end up alternating between a bite of bread, a bite of meat, and the occasional taste of a condiment, but rarely do the ingredients come together at the same time."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"A good place to get a huge bowl of tasty pho.

They give back to the community in spades.  Just want to mention one item, when one of our favorite Yelpers lost their home to a fire on Christmas Eve last year, Cuatro's teamed with me to raise funds to assist them in recovery.  In fact in the past 2.5 years, Cuatro's has worked with me to raise funds for the Miracle Foundation, Colin's Hope, our favorite Yelper and most recently The Wounded Warrior Project.  He provides complimentary meals for 50 plus folks who spend the day fund-raising and then gather at the restaurant to celebrate the success.  That alone is worth a couple of stars.\\n\\n2.  The owner is the chef and cares deeply about the folks who eat and drink at his establishment.  I can tell you, he reads every single review he gets.  It bothers him greatly if someone doesn't have a good time and try's his best to make the experience better.  He knows he can't be perfect always, but does his best when someone has a legitimate concern and voices their experience.\\n\\n3.  They have become another go to place for English Football.  His pricing is fair and offers up breakfast taco's to folks who arrive early in the morning to watch.  An item which isn't even on the menu.  They are not complimentary, but inexpensive...like 2 bucks I believe.\\n\\n4.  They try to be what they are.. a laid back place where you seat yourself and sometimes might even have to ask for a waiter/waitress to drop by the table.

It's very bustling with little elbow room in between tables, and not very romantic considering the plethora of deuces. Their thing is small plates, which I think lends itself best on one end of the spectrum to a bar type experience, and on the other to leisurely group situations. Here, you feel like you're being rushed through your dishes and drinks for maximum billage, and then rushed out once you've paid your rent. The experience at the bar can be fun. Steaks are pretty good, but other dishes feel over-hyped and under-loved. Cocktails can be sublime on the right day.

The beef short rib was so tender that it simply flaked apart with a fork.  The cheese grits that accompany the dish were to die for, and the BBQ jus sauce was reminiscent of a BBQ sauce from Kansas City (meaning that it's more tangy and flavorful than sweet).

Even though I only got the half-size, the salad was still plenty big: made of fresh greens, topped with corn, black beans, tortilla strips, red pepper and a good serving of pork, which wasn't too spicy or saucy.

Worse yet is that this \\"hoagie\\" bun seems, in both size and flavor, more like a glorified hot dog bun making this sandwich literally fall off the bun.

My dear friend who is a regular at this place directed us to the other elevator lobby where there was NO line (to the right of the main elevator lobby).  Apparently everyone thought that the elevators in this lobby didn't lead to the top floor but IT DOES. Don't be fooled by long line of foolish people.  Also would like to note that the elevators are programmed to not to operate until EXACTLY 4pm.  How odd and hilarious.\\n\\nOnce it strikes 4pm, elevator takes you up to PCG and it's game time.  Game time meaning you split up into teams of 1 and navigate quickly for one of the tables beside the windows.  There are only a few and everyone is out to get them.  We got lucky and snagged one table when a couple who was sitting there finally got called for their table in the restaurant portion of PCG.\\n\\nHappy hour is 1/2 of the reason people come here @ 4pm.

All of downtown is visible on a clear day, all the bridges look beautiful, all the greenery. I couldn't stop taking pictures of every angle.  You could even see the long line at Voodoo Doughnuts!

The wontons are a bit hard with s small shrimp - could use an egg white in the mix to lighten them. The wonton skins were falling apart which makes me suspect they are precooked and then reheated on order, a no no for us Chinese. Also had shrimp with scrambled egg rice plate. This was way off the mark from a genuine Cantonese style as instead of soft scrambled eggs, it was overwhelmed with corn starchy gravy - disappointing. Chicken wings come without the drummettes which is ok with me but could be an issue for others. They came after we were halfway done with our entrees since they are cooked to order vs heated up and they were hot, juicy, delicious. The staff are super nice. \\nThey say their chef has 40y experience cooking authentic Cantonese in HK - please, owner, let him do his thing!

The average age of clientele has probably been chopped in half. \\n\\nThe drinks are still good (but their prices more reasonable). I tested this out by ordering one of the more repulsive sounding cocktails on the menu (watermelon margarita). It was subtly executed, and to their credit not served in a martini glass (it was in a rocks glass); there's no worse abomination than a pink drink in a martini glass, unless it's intended ironically. One could barely tell it was watermelon. As in, it did not taste like a watermelon Jolly Rancher, which it what a \\"watermelon margarita\\" would likely have resembled at various other establishments. Rather, it tasted like a real margarita tinged with actual fresh watermelon juice, and then there was a cube of watermelon as a garnish. Lovely. They also still do proper martinis to order ($18), served in a generously-sized carafe on ice. My friend seemed satisfied with hers. Also, they've got a gluten-free flourless chocolate cake. Despite there being no room in the inn, I tried it anyway, and would do so again. \\n\\nAdditionally, service was excellent and the general atmosphere was many notches less stuffy than that of the Oak Bar's previous incarnation.

Towards the end of the roll, I was hit with a strong blast of black pepper. Looks like it wasn't evenly seasoned, since I hadn't tasted a hint of that pepper through 3/4 of the thing.

However, it is closed on Sundays so we headed to Thurmans. \\n\\nBeing in the historic German Village, it's a very small restaurant, with tiny doorways and little rooms. The tables are very close together, but it just makes the meal cozy. The walls, booths and tables are covered in dollar bills and signatures. The bar is pretty big and there are big screen everywhere. It's a typical local bar restaurant, with a meal that is anything but typical. \\n\\nOur wait was 45 minutes, which is extremely doable for the quality of food we got. There were also plenty of seats in the waiting area, as well as games to play and tvs to watch. You are more than welcome to have a beer while you wait. We perused the menu while we waited so we were ready to order when we sat down. \\n\\nWe were seated in the back corner, under the cover, very cozy for a big table. Our drink orders were taken immediately. The guys had Magic Hat #9, the kiddo had a milk and I had a coke. \\n\\n(SIDENOTE: The yelp info says the place is not kid friendly. For a Sunday afternoon, we saw plenty of kids, including our own. It's not too kid friendly, but they did have booster seats. I certainly wouldn't take the baby there in the evening when it's more of a bar, but for lunch it was fine.)\\n\\nMy coke was way off. Too much syrup, not enough CO2. But the other drinks were fine. Then we sat there for awhile. By the time someone came back I had sipped my coke down to the point where I didn't mind it and needed a refill. \\n\\nI ordered the jack burger (onions and monterey jack) and a grilled cheese for the kiddo. the bf ordered the three way (three cheeses, equaling 1/4 pound of cheese) and our friend ordered the jaeger (open faced on texas toast, with onions and french onion dip.)\\n\\nWe also started with jalapeno poppers and got a basket of fries. \\n\\nThe poppers were good, real cream cheese instead of cheese whiz. \\n\\nThen, pretty quickly, came the burgers. Huge, amazing, titillating, heart-stopping burgers. From the bun to the meat to the toppings, every bite was amazing!\\n\\nI immediately cut mine in half, expecting to take half of it home. However, it was so delicious I couldn't just stop after half. Despite being uncomfortably full I took down another 1/4 and then took the last 1/4 home, along with half the grilled cheese and most of the fries. \\n\\nThe guys both finished their plates, but they were hurtin' in a very good way. \\n\\nI can't describe what made the burger so good, but it was the best burger I've ever had. The outside was sort of crispy, but not charred, and the inside was still so juicy. The burgers aren't cooked to order, but there's no need to ask. The way they're cooked is perfect. \\n\\nOne guy took our order for food and drinks and another guy checked on us through the meal and a third guy cleared our plates. I wasn't sure who to actually tip, so we just left a nice tip that they could all share. \\n\\nThe food is affordable and amazing.

Stopped in here one morning with the wife, to get a quick breakfast before returning to San Antonio from a brief Austin excursion. We ordered coffees and breakfast tacos; the wife just got one Flaco taco as she's maintaining a phenomenal figure, but I requested two of the Three Alarm tacos because of the clear economic advantages of two versus one for that kind. The marginal cost per Three Alarm taco decreases by like 50% for the second taco; that's a true value, no joke. Anyway, we sipped coffee for maybe 10-15 minutes in a very busy restaurant before our food came. My two tacos were huge, and had great spice. My usual pet peeve with supposedly \\"hot\\" menu items is played-down, Americanized spiciness that caters to the people who want membership in the spice club, but just can't handle real spice. My tacos definitely delivered in that department. The wife enjoyed her tacos, which was a major plus (hearing about a bad breakfast for a long drive back to SA wouldn't have been fun).

First to try on my list: Alaskan Banana pancakes - the pictures got me hooked!!\\n\\nI decided to come here on an early Sunday morning (8:30 am). There were only two other parties (4-person family, and a young couple) seated when I got here. I was seated at a table by Kelvin - very polite, friendly, young man. justin, another young gentleman (college age, perhaps), talked about the items this place is known for. I was able to order right then, since I had my mind set: Alaskan Banana pancakes, a side of eggs, and a sausage patty. \\n\\nMost of the \\"negative\\" reviews where do to an extended wait on the food. Not so for me! I ordered at 8:40 and the food was served just a few before 9 am. And, YES, homemade and FRESH out of the kitchen!! Excellent pancakes!! Not too sweet. Could taste the batter, the mashed banana in between the stack. OH, and I'll add: The presentation of the pancakes was outstanding!! Hot, thick pancakes with a dollop of whip cream on top; a flash-fired banana slice; and a drizzle of syrup to decorate the plate. \\n\\nFirst bite was super super scrumptious!! Great taste to match the visual appeal! I also decided to order a side of their sausage and eggs. I was not too enthralled with the sausage - the spices in it, perhaps.

A light butter taste alongside the full egg taste!\\n\\nAfter having such a great \\"first experience\\" here, I no doubt will be back!!"},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This was our ONLY foodie/fancy restaurant stop on our Portland trip, so both of us were hoping it was going to be good.  Considering how the smoked trout fondue has haunted my dreams, I'd say our expectations were far exceeded.  \\n\\nThe boyfriend and I had reservations for a  Monday night, the last night of our trip to Portland.  We easily found nearby (Free!  Portland is awesome!) parking, walked into the bistro, and were seated in an admittedly cramped table.  I felt on top of the couple next to us as was able to hear their entire conversation (how does someone get a table in the cute balcony level?)  We weren't sure how to dress, but we needn't have worried.  There were patrons in the restaurant in everything from jeans to little black dresses.  We'd pretty much pickled our livers with winery and brewery visits, so we both decided to stick with just one pre-dinner cocktail l for the evening.  The cocktails are reasonably priced at $10ish and, while not as fantastic as some of the craft cocktails I've gotten in Chicago, were tasty.\\n\\nWe took some time pursuing the menu before deciding on the aforementioned smoked trout fondue appetizer to share and the cassoulet for him and the fish special of the night for me.  While we were waiting we were brought the most incredible bread I've had in ages.  It was accompanied by delicious butter sprinkled with a bit of sea salt.  We plowed through our first serving of bread and shamefacedly agreed to a second basket when our waiter offered.  Then the smoked trout fondue arrived.  It's not hyperbole when I tell you this is the best thing I've eaten since The Hunt menu at Next.  The official title of this dish is a \\"gratin of smoked trout fondue\\" but really it's neither a fondue nor a gratin.  It's smoked trout chunks in a cream sauce and it's...magical.  It came with toast points but we both decided we liked it better by itself.  Then we sopped up the remaining cream sauce with the bread.   Then we both debated licking the gratin dish but decided that, despite being out of town, it was too fancy an establishment for that kind of behavior.\\n\\nThe mains arrived.  My special was a sturgeon prepared in a salad nicoise style with a soft boiled egg, blanched vegetables, and an anchovy sauce.  It was quite good and the sturgeon was prepared perfectly - not remotely dry - but it was completely overshadowed by my boyfriend's cassoulet.  The cassoulet arrived with two giant duck legs with meat falling off the bone.   I'm kind of iffy on duck; it can often taste really gamey to me, but I finished the portion he gave me and snuck more when he was in the bathroom.  The cassoulet also had pork belly and sausage, which are even dicier for me than duck (pork belly is often way too fatty and sausage just...icky).  Somehow this pork belly was almost devoid of fat and the sausage was perfection.  When he decided he was full I gladly polished off his leftovers.  \\n\\nWhat's a fancy dinner without dessert?  We had no idea what a few of the French named desserts on the menu were and asked our waiter to translate.  Without a touch of condescension he described them for us.  We opted for the rhubarb clafoutis (described to us as a fancy French word for bread pudding) with smoked green strawberry sherbert.  The clafoutis didn't really resemble bread pudding...more of a soft cake.  It was merely okay, but the sherbert that came with it was a showstopper.  The green, unripe strawberries gave it a tartness that complemented the odd, but delicious smoke flavor.   If we could have ordered another dessert of just this ice cream, we would have.\\n\\nOverall, I loved Little Bird.  The food was extraordinary and very, very reasonably priced for the quality.

For a healthier alternative, chips can be substituted with steamed vegetables at no extra cost.  Ice cream dessert is also included!  As you walk up to the cashier, keep in mind that the \\"Manager's Special\\" is not listed on the menu posted on the wall; it's in the paper take-out menu.\\n\\nThe salad bar is well organized.  It has a magnificient selection of ingredients and pre-made salads, such as 3-bean salad and coleslaw.  Everything looks fresh and nutritious.  Among the spread are more expensive morsels I like to load up on, such as the artichoke hearts, pickled peppers, and feta cheese!  Since it's only one trip to the bar, I need to make it count!  With the large plate they always give, getting my money's worth is easy!  Usually, I build a hugenous salad tower, like the internet videos show they do at Beijing Pizza Huts.  To maintain my ch'i (ÔøΩ? and make my gut more regular the next day, I eat lots of roughage!  In fact, my salad is so immense that it is sometimes enough to obliterate my hunger even before I'm able to get to my sandwich.  Then, I can box the half-sandwich and take it home for another meal the next day!  How about that?...up to two meals for under $10!!!  After my salad, if I don't feel as if I'll regurgitate food upon burping, then I usually make a colossal foot-tall ice cream cone or put it in a bowl with an overflowing mountain of nuts.  No need for a buffet to fill me up here!  But as with all things of life, I take things in moderation!\\n\\nAs for the atmosphere at the hours I usually go, it is usually uncrowded with lots tables to choose from and room to spread out.  If the restaurant is fully occupied at other times, however, then with the way the tables are situated, it may feel cramped.  Since customers order and pay at the counter, there's no need to tip!  The spread of foodborne disease is mitigated by the busboy attentively spraying and wiping dirty tables and seats with disinfectant, not just a smelly old rag.  I appreciate that I have never gotten ill from eating here!  Last Sunday, they had Ultimate Fighting Championships on TV.  While I sometimes enjoy watching UFC fighters beat each other to a bloody pulp in the company of screaming friends, it might not have been the most appropriate background entertainment for what is supposed to be a family-friendly dining experience.

A standard bloody mary but the addition of sriracha and house pickles makes it work.\\n\\nDim Summore - $9.  A very strange sounding Bloody Mary due to the ingredients of ginger, hoisin, and sriracha, but interestingly, it's pretty refreshing and more interesting than the Tasty Mary just due to the novel ingredients. \\n\\nLemon Ricotta Pancakes with Blueberry Syrup - $7.  Outstanding.  Delicious as it looks and it looks amazing.\\n\\nFried Egg and Cheddar Biscuit - $9.  I ordered this dish with the fried chicken and one thing you can say is that they do fried chicken right.  It was perfectly seasoned, juicy, and straight from the fryer.  The biscuits was good, but the fried egg was a touch overcooked.  I would have liked the yolk cooked less to cause a mess as I ate this wonderful breakfast sandwich.\\n\\nKorean Fried Chicken - $14.  This Korean Fried chicken dish is that wonderful fried chicken but it's doused in Korean gojuchang sauce.

I happen to talk to one of the owners, who told me that she was the one that created the decor concept. As any starting restaurant, she was on a budget and took things from her own home. I am so impressed. Moreover, the atmosphere gave a sophisticated vibe, but giving you a casual and homey feel when you talk to the staff and eat their food. \\n\\nTheir menu changes, which offers you a new dining experience every time you come here. Because it's our first time, we ordered items that had been in the menu since their opening which were: the Scratch fries, Pork Belly Adobo and the Grilled Loup de Mer. Scratch fries was definitely something new to me. I'm so used to eating fries with ketchup that the saffron aioli pushed my boundaries. It was great creative experience. Light, crispy, not oily dunked in a flowery aroma of the saffron. This is a must try. The pork belly adobo was great. Being Filipino, I wanted to see their modern twist on this dish. The pork was so soft and crispy. The dish still contained the soy-sauce saltiness in the glaze and in the rice. But what I'm missing was the cut of acidity from the vinegar/lime, because it was overpowered by the salt in the pork. Nonetheless, it was a very unique take. Maybe I'm just too traditional. Moving on, the absolute favorite dish of the night was definitely the grilled Loup de Mer. The seabass was crispy and flavorful. The best part of eating the dish is tasting the \\"beer' blanc that surrounds the fish. My boyfriend and I devoured this dish. And I want to swim in it's rich flavors over and over again. Yes, this is definitely a crowd fave. Other than the food, the have a great selection of wine and beer. As a tip: their house moscato is like water to me. It's so so so good. \\n\\n\\nAll in all, this place is intimate, and I've never feel so welcomed and at home at a swanky restaurant. For a restaurant that's reaching their first year anniversary, they're doing a fantastic job! I absolutely love this place."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Surprisingly underwhelming.\\n\\nEveryone around here talks fondly of redbones, but frankly, I thought it was very average.

Food was average and the portions were very large. Liked how many TVs were around the whole restaurant because it's allowed us to geek out even more on soccer. The beer and alcohol drinks were mediocre. One of us ordered a mixed drink and we could see it sitting at the bar, waiting to be run, for over 10 minutes.

We used a GroupOn that was good for $40 worth of food and drinks. We only paid $20 for the GroupOn last year. We absolutely love GroupOn. Whenever we use one for a restaurant we let our server know right away and we mention that we will leave a nice tip on the would be total amount. Every time we do this they seem to give us good service. A couple of times I have tested it, where I say that we have a GroupOn but don't mention anything about tipping on the would be total and we had terrible service. I guess there are a bunch of people that do GroupOn's the wrong way and wait to the last minute to tell the business that they have one or they only tip on the discounted amount. I read a couple of reviews about Mantra where they were complaining about bad service especially with GroupOn. I think if you just let them know up front that you will be tipping on the would be full price, they will take care of you. Anyway, we had a good lunch at Mantra. She had the lamb curry and I went with the chicken tikka masala. Both were very good and they came with rice. We started with the trio of naan where you get to pick any three naan from their menu. I also had this mango shake drink that was amazing. We actually had a really good time. There were only a handful of people in there at the time but we liked everything about the place. I didn't get to check out the bathrooms but everything else was very clean and our service was solid. It sounds like they get pretty busy at night with dinners and then some nights they turn the main room into a club.

Boys become men, sink or swim, and at Aprisa... a day where unsuspecting customers inadvertently get caught in the crossfire.  Of course this happened to be the day we tried Aprisa for the first time.  \\n\\nThe staff was friendly and seemingly diligent, but what went on in that recycled shipping container, we will never actually know.  We received our 2 burritos and kids meal, signed the credit card receipt and then waited to return the signed paper and for the rest of our order- chips and guacamole and krustos.  \\n\\nWe waited and waited.  At one point my husband was convinced they had given us our entire order and was about to drive off because we had uncomfortably (to him) started a backlog of cars as we waited, but I had to tell him we were still missing half of it.  Was their food so fresh that they were hand smashing our guacamole to order?  Do they really brand each tortilla chip and krusto chip by hand?  Maybe that's why it was taking so long.  \\n\\nOver what felt like an eternity in drive-though time, but was probably more along the lines of 7-10 minutes, an employee finally opened up the window and said that they'd forgotten what food we were missing.  Drinks? He'd forgotten what we'd been given and needed to do an inventory of what we still needed- chips and guac and krustos. He apologized- it was training day.  And BAM, there were the chips and guac and krustos!  Hmm, so my theory of hand smashing guacamole to order and hand branding all the chips was proven wrong.  \\n\\nNo big deal, we understand.  Finally arriving home to eat the legendary food, I was disappointed to find out this probably wasn't the legendary food others have experienced- what we had was certainly training day food.  Both of our burritos were missing the extras we'd ordered- cheese, lettuce, etc.  The detail to include wet naps with the krustos was a nice touch, but they weren't needed because they were overdone and so dry that the cinnamon and sugar was at the bottom of the bag, not stuck on the chips.  Disappointingly, they seemed to resemble in taste more the order of chips we had and not the churros that everyone gushes about.  \\n\\nOur first encounter with Aprisa was one of bad timing on our part.

My first experience at Murphy's was for a dinner party with friends (if you are a meat eater, get the braised brisket!), but I had never tried the Brunch menu. They do not take reservations for Brunch, so I would recommend getting their earlier if you do not want to wait... but it is definitely worth the wait! ;)\\n\\nThe interior was as I had remembered it: warm, relaxing and inviting. The first thing my boyfriend and I ordered were two regular cappuccinos. They arrived to the table in a timely manner alongside a buttery cookie. The drinks were perfect.... hot, velvety and rich with coffee aroma. As we looked through the menu, two items stuck out the most: the chilaquiles and crab cake benedict. I knew my boyfriend would go for the chilaquiles (this is one of his favorite dishes), and right as we were about to order, the server kindly introduced the specials of the day.... one of which being avocado toast. If there is anything I love for brunch, it is eggs, toast and avocado. I decided to go for the avocado toast, and i added on a side of the stone ground grits and smoked bacon (you do not have to do this.... but I have tendency of selecting numerous items in order to try as much as possible).\\n\\nWhile we were waiting for our meal, the server placed some corn muffins and whipped butter/preserves on our table. I think that the portion size was perfect for the two of us and a very nice start to our meal. The whipped butter went on smoothly (it is so sad when you have COLD AS ICE butter that tears your bread to crumbs...) and had a hint of spice, and the preserve was fresh and cool. My boyfriend doesn't particularly go for 'sweet' things, but he was devouring the preserve. \\n\\nShortly thereafter,  our meals arrived and it took everything I had not to inhale my food. The chilaquiles were hot, flavorful and very well presented (this was all based on the bite I was able to \\"sneak\\" from his plate). He was very pleased with the quality and quantity of food on his place. For my dish, I was surprised to see how much avocado they had on it! There were two poached eggs placed neatly on top, as well as thin shavings of radish. The dish was light and refreshing, with two perfectly poached eggs. Portioning for this dish was equally satisfying, but I knew I could make room for bacon and grits... They were hot, thick and the dense bacon flavor was a fantastic pairing. We were both full (otherwise we would have gone for dessert!)\\n\\nOverall, the food, atmosphere and service were all incredibly. I am so glad I came back after so many years... this had definitely become one of our favorite date spots. I\\n\\nf you are looking for an intimate but relaxed meal/drink, come to Murphy's.

I saw an article about them in the Burnaby Now and thought, what the hey... \\n\\nEl Mariachi is on the 2nd floor on Hastings between Esmond and Ingleton. Their is a sandwich board outside their door indicating to go up the stairs. The restaurant is cozy and tends to be super busy around dinner time, but then the people dispearse and we ended up being the cheese that stands alone... twice. I am not creative... if I find a place I like, I will go again... since I had to meet two different groups for dinner, I made a reservation and then on my way out made another reservation. \\n\\nParking: There is ample free parking around this place. Normally I eat after six, so there is an abundance of street parking surrounding this place.\\n\\nSize of Party: Both times, I made a reservation for over ten people... no problem both times... we weren't jammed into a corner at a table for eight, we were given a proper sized table... enough to eat with elbows out... There was also no auto-grat which surprised me. Didn't even blink an eye when we said separate checks.\\n\\nThe food is really good. The first time, I had the tortilla soup... Not spicy, well, there is a hint of spice... it's thick and filling... with some garlicky cheese crumbled on top. We also had to nachos... we chose beef, but it didn't need any meat because there were so many black beans. These were loaded with tons of topping. These two definitely prevented me from finishing my entree. For my main, I had the Tacos Cochinita Pibel. I ordered it because Rick Bayless told me to. Actually, I watched him make it on that Latin Network and thought I should try it since I've never seen it (actually noticed it is more like it) anywhere else. Meh. Maybe it's because I was full of beans, but it wasn't the greatest. The pickled onions were really good...\\n\\nThe second time, I had the soup and the nachos again (no, I never learn). This time the nachos were without meat. Still really good. Since I wasn't in love with the pork last time, I got the chicken flautas because I saw someone else have it last time. Okay, this is more like it. They were deep fried tortillas with chicken rolled inside. On the plate, they were smothered with lettuce and tomatoes and a thin sour cream. Oh and again with the garlicky cheese. I also had everyone's beans... it's really handy to slide down the table since they come in indivdual cups.\\n\\nThey have coke in a bottle and all the usual drinks you think of when you hear Mexico. I had a virgin mango margarita and my husband kept knocking back the negro modelos. They also have micheladas... to me, it's like beer with soy sauce... but other people seem to really like it. \\n\\nThe servers are really nice and friendly. They kept bringing the drinks and making sure we had everything... some of the timing was off because some of the food came out way faster than others... and you don't want to be rude and eat while the others are waiting, but then your deep fried flautas are getting cold so you pull the birthday card... anyways... \\n\\nDid I mention it's warm in there? Again, in keeping with the Mexico theme... I noticed there was a small drum kit, but since I came two Fridays in a row, the music must be on Saturdays?\\n\\nI would've ordered dessert, but since the place cleared out, we left because we didn't want to hold the staff there...

It was semi-crowded with 25-40's group hanging by the bar dressed very chic. There is only 3 full size tables that can only sit probably 4 max, 6 pushing it against a wall bench that is tufted with velvet. Music playing in the background was not too loud but don't really remember the genre, possibly contemporary alternative. \\n\\nThe menu for food items is not extensive and had maybe like 7 items, tapas size. However, the drink menu had many different wines and beer to choose from. Sadly, I'm not a big fan of alcohol so I didn't dwell in to that portion of the menu. That night I ordered Bread and Spread, Pork belly Adobo, Grilled Loup De Mere (european sea bass). \\n\\nBread and Spread ($5) - The spread for that night was honey thyme butter, sour cream and chive, and a garlic puree. The bread is a in-house made brioche. The garlic puree was too strong for me, i would really preferred if they had roasted garlic then pureed it because it still had that raw flavor. Honey thyme butter was the better out of the three - sweet and creamy with a hint of the salt. The sour and chive was really disappointing as it just seems as if they ran out of a spread and created on a whim - basically I was dipping sour cream... or it seems like. \\"Spreads\\" change all the time, so it would probably change next time you go.\\n\\nPork Belly Adobo ($11)- this was delicious. The pork belly (lake meadow) was tender and all the flavors in one bite with the micro cilantro with a squeeze of key lime juice was the perfect bite. The carrot puree didn't add much though. The black rice was also cooked perfectly and wasn't hard to eat. However the portion bothered me. The slice of pork belly was literally 1 in x 1 in and thickness of .5 in of 4 pieces. I understand its a tapas and I'm not expecting a whole slab of pork belly but to me the value of the tapas for the price was not worth it. \\n\\nGrilled Loup De Mere ($12)- This is a small fillet of the sea bass over potato-fennel hash. This also tasted delicious. The charring on the skin has made it crispy but with out over cooking the fish. It still maintained the flakiness of the fish. The potato hash underneath was creamy. Again, the portion to me is difficult justify the value for the money. \\n\\nThe service was very friendly, accommodating and they all seem very knowledgable. \\n\\nBy all means, I feel the food at Scratch is delicious and if you want farm to table style food you'll have to pay the big bucks. I just think it was the wrong timing for me to come here as I was famished but this place was a bar with a small tapas menu. I wish they had full portion of some of the tapas, I would rather pay 25 dollars for a full portion. Its just personal opinion of value for the money. I just had my own expectations. I would honestly give it 3.5. Till next time..."},{"name":"Teji's Indian Restaurant and Grocery","address":"2100B Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"AMAZING!

If you go by yourself you may get a quick seat at the counter, otherwise expect to wait at least 30 minutes. The lobster roll was fresh but could have been chopped a little more thoroughly as some of the bigger chunks were hard to chew off the sandwich roll and would help smooth out the texture. The salad was very good as a side with the sandwich. The staff is A+, seriously. Don't expect to get out for much under $50 per person. Good location too, just a few minutes from South Market."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Quite possibly the best ribs you'll experience north of the Mason Dixon line (I strongly recommend the Arkansas-style ribs).  The pulled pork and barbecue beef aren't too shabby either.  They even have a respectable number of items on the menu for vegetarians (not bad for a rib joint).

Just based on the fact that there wasn't enough gravy on our plate! We ordered the Reggie Deluxe, which is basically the fried chicken sandwich in a biscuit instead with a fried egg. The biscuit itself is very dense and thick and the fried chicken was fried well. The meal is big enough for two people to share (which is what we did). Definitely want to try some of the other items on the menu. I knew the stuff would be super heavy, so we didn't want to over order. \\n\\nVery casual ambiance. This location is right next to Great Notion Brewery. Great place to grab some food and then maybe head over to Great Notion for a beer (if you didn't care for some of the selections that they have to offer). Either way, lots of choices to choose from! You order first before you grab a table. Line moves quickly and the service is quick. There's indoor and outdoor seating, though beware there's no AC indoors. Worth the stop to get some biscuit and gravy and quick grab for food."},{"name":"FoMu","address":"481 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"Let me start out by saying I LOVE FOMU. The ice cream is awesome. No other place compares in flavors available for us lactose-infriendlies.\\n\\nAlright, now that that is cleared up let me tell you about their cakes. Beware the photos on the site, they are not accurate. \\n\\nLong and short of it is I do not recommend their cakes unless you are OK getting something different than pictured on their site. I know since I have ordered their cakes three times the last three years for three birthdays.\\n\\nThe cakes always taste delicious, I will admit. But each proceeding year they cheap out and skip one new thing. First they got smaller (last year). OK fine, they offer sizes now thankfully phew. But then this year they skipped the acoutrimound - super basic chocolate topping over the cake and that's it. \\n\\nNo frosting, no frosting blobs which were ridiculously RIDICULOUSLY tasty. I miss them A LOT.\\n\\nSo yes, the ice cream is great. The cakes are great. But only complaint is the cakes are no longer as pictured on their website. They have no frosting. Unfortunate for a repeat special orderer like me, but yes, next year I will still be back."},{"name":"Grasshopper Cafe","address":"229 Bunker Hill St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Cute place to stop before or after visiting Bunker Hill.

If you eat before ascending the monument order what you like because you will surely burn some calories while hiking up those almost 300 steps.

No, this isn't some fancy salad or side dish. The red sangria at Scampo, sons. It warms you up in a way a drink filled with ice rarely does with it's red wine, brandy and complexity of spices. The $48 pitcher is a hefty amount (probably 8-10 glasses)... enough to get 4 coworkers pretty tipsy at 1 PM on a workday. Get it and be merry.\\n\\nBecause we're celebrating! My work team hit a major goal and went here for lunch on Friday. We sat on the outdoor patio from which you can see the facade of the jail-hotel (jatel?) rise above you. The Liberty never ceases to impress me.\\n\\nThe salads we ordered were nothing to scream about, but the bruschetta was simply incredible. The capers and tomato sauce offset the cheese and honey beautifully, taking this generally simple app to another level. Definitely scream-worthy.\\n\\nI ordered the scallops, and they cooked them perfectly. Just the right amount of char graced the surfaces, adding a wonderful flavor, yet each scallop was still tender and meaty. These 4 little mounds of happiness came with beautifully roasted cauliflower in a sauce with raisins. The smokey flavor of the veggies was complimented by the sweet raisins and creamy sauce. It's evident that Scampo likes to experiment with ingredients and combine flavors in unique ways. They definitely take the overall dish into account, which is absolutely wonderful and the mark of a great chef in my opinion. Considering this, I feel that paying around $20 per dish is a reasonable price tag.\\n\\nAnd it wouldn't be a true celebration without dessert! We split the profiteroles with dulce de leche ice cream. $11 is pricey for this one, and I wouldn't get it again since it was pretty standard, but I'll admit the caramel sauce was pretty dang good.\\n\\nWe all left satisfied, slightly tipsy, and smiling. Do we really have to go back to work? I'll just be thinking about that sangria and bruschetta the entire time anyway."},{"name":"Rosa Mexicano","address":"245 18th St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Terrible service by Michelle at the bar.

We were short on time because we had tickets to that nights hockey game and were leaving first thing in the morning. We skipped the hotel and drove straight to Thurman's. For those on the West Coast - it is reminiscent of Mom's, Sloane's, The Bull-n-Mouth, and others of the old Grand American chain of restaurant/bars. Wood carved up by the customers, lots of pictures pasted to the wall and laminated over. Small. Dark. This was a pretty good bargain though. This place had also been mentioned on the Travel Channel's Man v. Food series. The burger - The Thurmanator. While we skipped on that we both had burgers and agreed that the burgers were top notch. I had the Jaeger. Outside of the meat, all the other stuff on the burger was a bit of a disappointment. The fries(handcut) were great though. This was a knife/fork burger (no top).  \\nService was very friendly, but this is not the speediest place in the world. We were warned that it gets busy early and stays that way. We witnessed it in action. We were called up to be seated and they then told us that despite having a table ready - we needed to wait to allow the kitchen staff to catch up. When we were seated it took awhile before they took our drinks, longer to get our food order and longer still to get the food. We still made it to the game on time though (which was really the important piece). When we arrived there were 2 sets of 2 waiting to be seated. When we left - there had to be 30 people waiting for a table. I would certainly go back to see if the Thurman burger was a better choice. Again, the burger - great, my choice - not so much on the toppings. I'm giving it 4 because my friend enjoyed his burger selection much more"},{"name":"Chili Daddy","address":"419 E Michigan St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent chillis!!

My husband has been wanting to go for a while but I'm not a huge italian fan, so I've been putting it off.  Honestly, this was an amazing meal.  We will back soon.  And hello, added plus- Scoutmob!  \\n\\nPersonally, it's so refreshing that this place isn't some trendy and loud spot like so many Atlanta eateries.  I love that it's in the basement of some condos in Buckhead and the decor is tasteful and doesn't try so hard.  I will say, I definitely want to eat on the patio next time- it looks lovely.  Like I said, last night we went and it was packed on a Wednesday at 8PM.  The crowd is older but who cares?  I like that we ended up talking to the table of 4 young professionals beside us and they said they had been there at least 100 times- could be a slight exaggeration :)- but you get the point.  We noticed multiple tables who seemed to know their waiters, love that kind of place.  \\n\\nI got the Petto di Pollo Ripieno di Prosciutto because I'm not a huge pasta fan- it was absolutely delicious.  So, so good.  Loved the breads that they served before the meal, loved the wine suggested by the waiter, and the tiramisu is the best I've ever had.  I cannot remember the name of the pasta my husband got but he said it's been one of his favorite italian dishes ever and he is PICKY.

It was so flavorful and unusual. The cornmeal pancake and the steak was amazing. They brought another Korean fried chicken with scrambled eggs (they had made a mistake giving us the first one). We told them we got one and they apologized and had us keep the new one. All in all it didn't disappoint.

And by afternoon, I mean like 230p. I was surprised that it was still so busy at that time. With that being said, there were some tables that were open. However, I took Pete J's advice on his review and asked to sit at the counter. It was nice, we got to watch the meat slow cook on the grill, as well as several gents rushing back and forth working the meat and sides stations. I longingly watched as they easily separated meat from bone. I knew from then on, that it was going to be tender. mmmmmmmm tender...\\n\\nWe started off with the comp sausage (thank you Pete J for the counter advice). It was good. It came with mustard and the price was right. We then ordered the fried pickles and jalapenos. I thought they were good. They came with a decent sauce and we piping hot out of the fryer. \\n\\nFor the main course we shared the bbq basket. It came with ribs from Memphis, Texas, and Arkansas as well as some Brisket. For the most part they were ok. We were offered 4 different choices of sauce. I was not overly impressed by any of them. While the meat did fall off the bone as planned, some of it was a bit dry. For the most part it was ok though. I also ordered a side of dirty rice. I like that they made it right with chicken liver's as well. Tasty\\n\\nOur server was friendly and I had a sweet tea. It came in a huge jar and was tasty.  Overall, the experience was fun. For a guy going with gf, an app and one plate of meat is more than enough. The menu is large, and the staff was fine.

My son had the corned beef hash and loved it. We got a ton of food, the prices were great, our waitress was super nice, and we enjoyed the hipster yet relaxed vibe of the place. Also note they have a really nice kids play area, and lots of yummy sounding breakfast cocktails. I could have happily eaten here every day, and we'll definitely be back on our next trip to Portland."},{"name":"Jake's Ice Creams & Sorbets","address":"660 Irwin St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The ice cream was fine but nothing exceptional.

I finally stopped by Chago's and was very happy I did.  We tried 3 dishes, the El Jibarito sampler, the Chagos Pernil Asado, and the Paella.  My favorite was the Chagos Pernil Asado, the pork BBQ was so soft and tender it melted in your mouth.. The dipping sauce that they served with it was the perfect compliment.  The Paella was awesome as well.. I have only had it in Spain, but this version was so tasty with bits of meat mixed in.  The chips they serve before the dinner are also good as it comes with a nice garlicky sauce for dipping. I believe the chips are plantain perhaps. The only think I wasn't crazy about was the El Jibarito sampler of Fritters as I am not a big fan of fried, breaded foods.  The service was friendly and efficient and the atmosphere was family oriented and friendly.  I will definitely go back again for dinner and try the Mofongo."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I had an epic meal at Le Pigeon a couple years ago so I was prepared to have a similar experience at Little Bird.  It didn't really pan out that way unfortunately.  \\n\\nPros:  Professional staff.  I spoke with them in advance about food issues and they were very accommodating.  Nice martini w/ yummy olives.  My sister and dad enjoyed their meals, though they weren't necessarily amazed.  \\n\\nCons:  I ordered the lamb rib special and was sorry I did.  It came with four small riblets atop some beets and a couple of leaves of undressed greens.  It was supposed to have a sauce on it but there was none in sight as the ribs were dry and kind of charred.  The dish was overall ok but not at the level I was expecting taste wise.  And I'm super surprised they served it as an entree because it was definitely an appetizer portion.  I would have relayed this opinion to the server but it was the lunch rush and she didn't ask us how everything was.  \\n\\nOverall, not a terrible experience by any means but with so many places to choose from I won't go back."},{"name":"Murphy's","address":"997 Virginia Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I will preface this by saying that I've been to Murphy's only once.  So this review is based only one that one experience...but WHAT an experience!\\n\\nSo this dinner was a big deal for me...my boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my being accepted into grad school, and due to taking pre-requisite classes beforehand, we're on a budget.  \\n\\nAnyway, I booked the reservation online and when we got there, we were seated within five minutes.  I was a bit concerned because they sat us on the patio and it was in the middle of one of the first cold snaps last fall, but the patio was heated very nicely.  \\n\\nOur server's name was Nick.  He was extremely friendly and attentive.  When I was trying to select a glass of wine to drink, he asked me about my personal tastes and based on that feedback, introduced me to the best wine I've ever had (I can't remember what it was off the top of my head, but I think I'd recognize it if I saw its name again).  I started out with the chicken and tomato soup as an appetizer--AMAZING!!  Just the right amount of chicken mixed in with the broth and tangy tomatoes.  \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the Guinness brisket and I had the spinach meatloaf.  AMAZING!!!  Now, my boyfriend is very much a meat and potatoes guy to begin with, but when he took his first bite and practically rolled his eyes in the back of his head, I took that as a good sign.  My meatloaf was amazing, as well as the mashed potatoes that came with it.  I had to stop myself from eating it so that i could save room for dessert.  \\n\\nSpeaking of dessert...  also amazing!  (I know, I'm wearing out that word.)  We got a slice of tollhouse pie and they also had some sort of special dessert that night...some sort of chocolate cake a la mode.  Everything was wonderful.  Very rich, top-notch ingredients.\\n\\nGoing back to Nick, he made the experience really fun.  His brother happened to be serving the next section over, so with their banter back and forth it was like getting free entertainment in addition to a wonderful meal!  \\n\\nAgain, I've only been once, so I know some people may dismiss this review since I don't have multiple experiences upon which to base it.  But my first visit was so amazing, that I definitely will be back."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Very good oysters with a solid selection.

Also had the fresh Yellow Fin Tuna appetizer on a piece of bruchetta with avocado spread and aiola sauce, it taste like heaven....but it's sooooo small! One piece of bread with fresh Tuna for $17!!! HOLY CANNOLI BATMAN! \\n\\nOverall, definitely worth going to and trying it out. I'll definitely come back for more oysters but will probably pass on the rest of the food next time because of price, not quality.

Don't let the generic name, sketchy location and the fact it is owned by Chinese scare you from trying it out.  If you are a sushi connosseur don't bother because I guarantee you will be disspointed.  However, if you're not super picky about sushi and just want to get a whole lotta sushi for a reasonable price you should definitely give it a try.\\n\\nIt is quite obvious they are trying to copy Saburo's with their oversized sushi and if I had to compare the two Saburo's wins hands down.  But if you are craving big pieces of sushi without the long wait of Saburo's, Super Size Sushi is a good alternative.  \\n\\nNow the taste and quality...  I only had nigiri and thought the fish was fresh but not of the highest quality.  The cuts of salmon, tuna and yellow tail lacked flavor, imagine Saburo's sized fish with Sushiland quality.  I do not like their sushi rice, it was warm and tasted like they use cheap sushi vinegar you can find at any asian grocery store.\\n\\nTheir sushi is definitely doable and I will go there again."},{"name":"LOCAL Public Eatery - Kitsilano","address":"2210 Cornwall Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"My favourite thing to order from here is a fish taco and a chicken taco - $5 each.

We sat at the bar and the service is still four stars. Ali was our main bartender and she recommended two cocktails that I tried and really liked. The Elderflower (Grey Goose Vodka, Orange Liqueur, Elderflower Liqueur) martini was excellent. Smooth and a great refreshing drink for this time of the year in Orlando. I then did the Raging Tide (Stoli Vodka, Ginger juice, fresh thyme), which was another of Ali's favorites (and she made both cocktails perfectly!) and was quite impressed. I also had a cup of the Manhattan clam chowder (they had both white and red broth-I chose the white) and it was very good. We shared two appetizers - the Oysters Rockefeller and the Lobster Mac-n-cheese. The Oysters Rockefeller were ok. The presentation was not the best as they looked dry with the melted cheese over the spinach.

I like the Pine state club though (except for the DRYYYYYY chicken). I don't know.. They're so big and popular now that they don't have to really give a crap about quality since they will never have slow business.

We also ordered half a dozen oysters, which were great, and also the PEI Mussels, which was our favorite dish there, as the broth was garlicky and spicy and SO good that we sopped it up with bread.

However, few bubble to the top as most are pretty lack-luster or hit-and-miss.  Vindalho is neither.  In fact, it's excellent.  \\n\\nAs a word of warning, a lot of truly authentic Indian dishes are spicy (this means hot).  At Vindalho, they don't shy away from the heat, and this is a VERY good thing.  I've been to too many Indian restaurants that claim to be authentic, but then tone down dishes that are supposed to increase your internal temperature because they're trying to appease the gringo crowd.  \\n\\nThis is not to say that all of the dishes at Vindalho are spicy, just the ones that are supposed to be.  They have lots to choose from if heat isn't your thing.\\n\\nBelow are some of what I believe to be the stand out dishes.\\n\\nStarters:\\n\\nHoney Cumin Chicken Wings - light-spicy, messy, delicious, perfect.\\n\\nLamb Kofta - as a rule, Vindalho gets all of their lamb dishes right.\\n\\nEntrees:\\n\\nSaag Paneer - if you've never had Paneer cheese, then order this.  Generally speaking the stuff is amazing, and they do an amazing job at Vindalho.  It's not spicy, so if you aren't into the heat, this is a safe, vegetarian style dish that is sure to please.\\n\\nPork Vindalho - Vindalho is a spicy sauce, and this is one of my all time favorite dishes here.  As a word of warning, if you take this home for leftovers, it will get even spicier as it marinates in your fridge.  You've been warned...\\n\\nSides:\\n\\nGarlic Stuffed Naan - oh good God, this stuff is insanely good!\\nGarlic Stuffed Naan - it needed to be repeated... just order it.\\nNaan - if you're not into the garlic, their standard Naan is also amazing.\\n\\nThe Three Chutney Sampler - get this! I recommend the following three: \\n1) Cucumber and Mint Raita, \\n2) Fresh Coriander Chutney\\n3) Red Chili Chutney\\n\\nAs for the the bar, it is excellent.

I was shocked how huge the plates were at such great prices. \\n\\nThe mac and blue cheese with bacon bits won my heart. Each bite was as bold beginning to the end. The chicken strips were very tender and just the right amount of breading. The fries are seasoned to taste and reminds me of how fries were great back in the day. The stuffed mushrooms with a sauce topping so divine. I didn't even know it had seafood until I looked at the menu. The hot wings are not your typical snack. It's more like breaded chicken with the bone instead. The prime rib tip bites is a good portion for the price you pay. The succulent and juicy meat is surely addicting and goes well with the horseradish sauce. \\n\\nThey have a special cocktail for $5 each day. The vodka martini they offer on Wednesdays is simple and elegant. I'm a huge fan of their peach sangria which is only $6 and comes in a huge glass. I certainly got my buzz after that.

I have a bunch of Indian friends who were super-psyched about this Hindi DJ that was playing a show at Vinalia. I thought that sounded like a good time so I looked up Vinalia and the website didn't say anything about ever hosting shows. But I checked, and sure enough, there was this DJ playing there, and it was a $15 cover charge, but no charge if you got there before 10. *Sweet*, I thought, *we'll go in and have a drink and get in to the show for free.*\\n\\nWe had dinner in Chinatown at a Pho Pasteur. In the mean time, the deal at Vinalia kept getting better. We heard from the show organizer that it was going to be an open bar from 10-11. We got to Vinalia at quarter to 10 only to find they weren't open yet. So we waited. Ten o'clock came, and they put out a sign saying $25 cover. We said the show had been advertised as $15 if you got there by ten. The guy said that was fine, but then, when they let people in 15 minutes later, they charged us $20, then said it was because there was an open bar from 10-11.\\n\\n\\"Great,\\" I said, \\"At least we can have a few drinks on the house before the show comes on.\\" By this time I had noticed the Christiana Vodka advertisements everywhere, and had surmised that the only free drinks would probably involve that particular brand of spirits. \\"Whatever's free.\\" I said. My friends and I stood patiently at the bar, waiting to be noticed by the bartender. He studiously ignored us, even though we were the first ones in and the only people standing at the bar. \\n\\nEventually, someone came around and handed us a coat check ticket, and said we got one free Christiana drink. Then, of course, everyone looked at me to tell them the strongest possible drink one could make with vodka, and naturally I said extra dry martini straight up. So that's what we all got.\\n\\nMine was swimming in crushed ice. The guy couldn't make a martini to save his life. Still pissed about the bait-and-switch on the cover charge and the open bar, that was the last straw. Fortunately there was in fact vodka in the drink, which did wonders for my mood.\\n\\n The promised Indian DJ either hadn't shown up or just felt like playing really really shitty music (I don't want to grace it with the term rap). Eleven o'clock came and we were all still waiting for the shitty music to turn off and the Hindi music to turn on. Finally it did, and it was fun. Unfortunately the acoustics of that place suck. Still, it was pretty damn cool. The drinks were wicked overpriced, but the only drinks I bough I had made by another bartender, who can in fact make a martini. $12 a piece for Chiroc martinis, not the worst prices ever. Still, I couldn't bring myself to leave a tip considering that we'd been charged $5 extra for the open bar that didn't exist.\\n\\nI don't know about the food, but then I don't think that fine dining and clubbing mix. I certainly wouldn't eat in a room where two random people were dry-humping the night before. That's right, dry humping. For about half an hour. For all I know, they're still doing it.\\n\\nThe one star I'm giving them is that, with the company I had and the music (when it finally changed to Hindi techno), I had a really good time. I spent more money in an hour and a half than I generally do in a week.

Again, our server seemed uncertain of what was supposed to go on each and as first timers at the restaurant we weren't sure either. It was a little odd. \\n\\nWe each got sides--I got a hummus with tortilla and he got the fries. The Indian wrap was alright, I wasn't blown out of my mind with awesome flavors--but I also didn't have a crazy allergic reaction--so that was cool! The Mexican, I was told, was alright. It needed a little more seasoning. \\n\\nThe hummus was just regular style--but the fries were DELICIOUS. \\n\\nSeven Hens has a King of Pops selection--which is exciting. I might go back JUST for a popsicle--is that crazy? I need to try all of those flavors. \\n\\nThe servers were friendly--if a little uncertain at times. The food was just so/so.

Most of the time, I go with my sister, and we always order and share the chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala, and a regular naan (though the garlic naan and potato naan are delicious as well). \\n\\nService has always been a little lackluster, and there have been a few rude waiters here and there. I'm not too hung up about it because I don't expect dining near campus to have great service. Also, the wait time for food runs on the longer side, so be aware of that. \\n\\nNow, on to the food. The chicken biryani is a mixed rice dish, kinda like fried rice, with chunks of chicken and various spices. The portions are huge and enough for two people. The spiciness can be inconsistent at times, so there have been instances when my mouth has been on fire (and I'm pretty tolerant with spiciness, so be warned). It comes with a cooling cucumber-yogurt type sauce that I don't really use; I prefer to just eat the biryani as is. If you do use the sauce, I suggest that you use it a little at a time rather than pouring it all over the rice. \\n\\nThe chicken tikka masala is a pretty small portion for the price, so we always get the chicken biryani with the chicken tikka masala to balance it out. The chicken tikka masala is a tomatoe-y, slightly spicy (tip: you can request spice levels!!), creamy sauce that comes with chunks of chicken. The chicken tikka masala they give you is more than enough for the rice that comes with it. That's why I also get the naan to mop up the rest of the sauce (it's incredibly good). \\n\\nI used to go to Teji's at least once a week, but that's not the most economical option, considering it is a little on the pricy side. However, I've recently started getting email coupons from Teji's which shaves a couple dollars off here and there, so I'm more than happy to go once in a while. One of the things I love about Teji's is that they're also open super late all the time (every day until 3 AM) so it's a great spot to go with friends after cramming for a test or staying up studying.

My foodie cousins from NY came to visit for the weekend and I knew I had to impress. Neptune, as it was back then from 2009 to 2010 surely did not disappoint. They offered freshly shucked oysters, delicately crafted crudo, perfected portioned irony, creamy sea urchin. Not to mention, their entree offerings were amazing. For those who ventured beyond the New England lobster roll, you knew that the whole roasted bronzini and the seared sea diver scallops were a hit. \\n\\nEarlier in 2011 they featured what topped my list - Sturgeon topped on a bed of duck confit and kimkee salad. IT WAS TO DIE FOR. The second and third time I had it, they swapped out Columbia River Sturgeon for Sea Bass (thinking the diners wouldn't recognize the difference) and charged the same despite the fact that sea bass was more common and threw off the expected flavors of the meal. \\n\\nMore recently, it seems as though the sous chef is there more often than the head chef. They'd rather churn out lobster meat in hot dog buns saturated in a heaping portion of butter than to take the time and check the temperature on their scallops. And these days, it seems their lobster meat is pre-schucked days before allowing the meat to decay. \\n\\nThe last one I had was a week ago - I could tell from the first bite that the meat was off. It had a slightish hue of grey and no elasticity in texture. It left a bad taste in my mouth, one that a laddle full of melted butter piled on couldn't mask. I am not a fan of sending anything back, so I did not complain.  \\n\\nAny restaurant who takes pride in the quality and taste of their food deserves a 45min-1hr 1/2 wait, regardless of how rude the staff is.

I assume she is a busy woman, and so I'll cut her some slack on her somewhat slow responses to my emails/calls. We rented the largest room of the four, not because we needed the space, but because I loved the views from the SW corner of the building the best. \\n\\nFor our event, we had to meet a $1500 minimum budget. This is very easily met, even with my 15 guests, as we each ordered a $30-60 meal and shared 3 different appetizers. Add some wine and other libations, and you will meet the minimum. There is no additional fee, so it really is fee for fare.\\n\\nOur event was held at sunset, and let me tell you, it was beautiful.

Then we sat at our table being eaten alive by mosquitoes for ten minutes until our server finally stopped by to see if we wanted a drink.\\n\\nAt this point we were probably as familiar with the menu as she was, we ordered drinks and an appetizer (while we both eyed up the exit)..  The server dropped sourdough bread that was dry from being heated too long and disappears. After about five minutes my ice tea was delivered, 15 minutes or so later the server returned with my soft shell crab appetizer. \\n\\nOur table now looks like A bread crumb factory and I couldn't help but notice the crumber protruding from our server's apron.  While we waited for my NY strip and my wife's scallops we continued to watch the staff stomp around with an apparent  lack of caring for anything other than moving the night along. \\n\\nFrom where I was seated I had a great view of the kitchen staff where the servers picked up their orders.

I watched it while my wife and I joked that it was probably our food. Well it wasn't so funny when my $48 steak was room temperature.\\n\\n My steak was ok but the sides were terrible the asparagus was woody and the potatoes au gratin had an off super salty flavor. I couldn't get past the lukewarm temperature of my wife's scallops to enjoy the flavor. \\n\\nAfter forcing down the entrees our server finally scraped the crumbs from the table and attempted to interest us in dessert.  I noticed that several guests around us were eating the almond cheese cake.  I failed to see what all the fuss was for this dessert.  To me it looked as unappealing as I imagined that it would taste.   \\n\\nThe bottom line is that even with Tables in Wonderland which saved us 20% it was an overpriced meal similar to any chain steak house with the differences being the decent view and poor service. \\n\\nI would never recommend that anyone waste a dining experience there.

The Great Leopold (winter squash, sage, bread crumbs) was slightly sweet and the complex flavors blended perfectly together.  The daily special sauce (squash, olive oil, lemon, Roma tomatoes) was lighter, refreshing and tasty.

We went on a Saturday morning around 10am and the line was already around the corner of the building. I had such high hopes!!\\n\\nWe stood in line (which went by pretty quickly) and people were passing out menus for us to look at. Which I found helpful so I could figure out what I wanted. The menu sounded amazing. I was so excited to see the selection. I was even more surprised to see Cheerwine on their menu. I've never seen it anywhere than in the South.\\n\\nWe decided to try the famous Reggie Deluxe and just the standard biscuits and gravey. I watched happily through the window as they made fresh biscuits right before our eyes. My mouth was drooling!\\n\\nWe get closer to the door and I notice a sign saying to keep it closed so people inside can enjoy their food. Hey I get it, it was chilly outside. There were 3 of us there and our friend was waiting on another 2 friends. We get in the door and basically get pushed out because we were in the way. Ummm ok, fine whatever. \\n\\nWe finally make our way through the door and to the counter to order. The woman taking our order was pretty abrupt (but hey I understand they were busy). I place my order and she asks if we were sitting with anyone else who was ordering. I said yes and my friend says well I'm waiting on 2 other people. She barely gets the words out when Ms. Sunshine says well they have to stand in line and order when they get here. Ok again...I get it, busy and all. So thats fine. \\n\\nShe takes my card and hands me a number. Well the table behind us starts to get up to leave. My husband grabs the number and goes over to grab the table so we don't have to stand and wait for our food. The cashier doesn't say a word to me...puts my credit card down on the counter...runs over to my husband and proceeds to scold him for trying to get a table. She rudely tells him that we can't sit there.. we need to wait around and the table needs to be taken by someone who has been waiting..UMMM ok and where does that say that anywhere?\\n\\nShe comes back and swipes my card. Doesn't apologize, smile, or even act like she cares. She tells me that we just need to stand off to the side and wait for our food. \\n\\nSo we head into the back area. Very crowded. I felt like I was intruding on others personal space. Thankfully, a few minutes later someone in the back left so we were able to get a table. Food came out pretty quickly...\\n\\nHad the food been as great as everyone seems to think it is I would have looked past the rude service. The biscuit for both the Reggie Deluxe and my biscuits and gravy was dry! I mean seriously, overcooked and dry. Lacked flavor. The chicken on the Reggie was just okay. Not enough seasoning. The gravy over the biscuits was pretty good. Nothing to rave about. \\n\\nOur friend ordered a side of bacon to go along with her biscuits and gravy. I wish I would have taken a photo of it.

It wasn't too bad when we first sat down, but it was pretty unbearable by the time we left. I typically see other restaurants close their doors entirely when their A/C breaks during the summer...\\n\\n2. My husband ordered the grilled salmon omelette special, which he thought he heard the waiter say came with cheese grits on the side. We were still waiting for him to come back and take our orders, so I walked over to the sandwich board where the specials were written down to confirm - it said it came with fruit. So, I told my husband, and when the waiter came back, my husband asked the waiter to confirm. He repeated what he said earlier, and told my husband that no, it does actually come with grits. Wrong. It came out with fruit. \\n\\n2. I got the fried green benedict special, and the poached eggs were undercooked. The whites were still runny and gloopy/boogery, which put me off of the entire plate since the eggs were effectively just one step above raw. It was a bummer because the jalape√±o hollandaise was delicious. Once I broke the eggs, my plate was basically a pool of liquid with only the fried tomatoes and a couple thin pieces of the egg white that managed to cook as solid items. :/\\n\\n3. We asked for waters. They never came. (Reminder: THERE WAS NO A/C)\\n\\n4. My husband ordered a side of french toast, which came without butter and was extremely dry. It was either overcooked, or just not great quality bread... it was chewy and the taste wasn't too good either.\\n\\n5. When we got the check, we were charged for a full order of french toast ($9) instead of the side ($5) that we had ordered. \\n\\n6. The waiter asked us when he dropped off the check how everything was. I let him know about the undercooked eggs, and he said that the kitchen gets pretty busy sometimes (??). There were maybe four or five total parties in the entire restaurant the whole time we were there... all of which were parties of two. Man, if you don't have time to cook your eggs when your restaurant is like 85% empty, you've got a friggin' problem.\\n\\nSo, Blue Star, you are unfortunately dead to me.

The bar menu is great because if you are unfamiliar with oysters, there was some description of them so you know what to expect. \\n\\nWe had to try the infamous hot lobster roll. We quickly found out that it takes 2 bites to clog the arteries. I'm sure a whole stick of butter was used on the 1 roll. Boy, was it delicious. The lobster meat was tender and full of flavor. The bread was very tasty and well baked. The sides were toasted just right and the middle was fluffy. \\n\\nWe also ordered a bowl of clam chowder. This was unlike other chowders that I've tasted. The chowder was lighter; almost soup-like. I liked how not one of the ingredients overpowered the soup; some chowders that I've had were very potato-heavy. There were good sized clams in the shop; very good. \\n\\nAnother dish we ordered was the Buttermild Johnny Cake. The Johnny Cake was cooked very well. It was thin but still flavorful. The smoked trout tartare and caviar was icing on the cake - literally!"},{"name":"Jalapeno Charlie's","address":"218 Peachtree St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Service is HORRIBLE!!!

Mopac Expressway","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Before reading this review, you need know something about me. I freakin' love shellfish!!! Crab is my absolute favorite food stuff (from animals) on earth.  I've always suspected that lobster should be up there, too, but every time I try lobster, it is an overcooked, rubbery disappointment that costs way too much. I've had it prepared every which way, but the meal always ends with me saying, \\"Meh. What's the big deal with lobster anyway?\\" (For more on that reaction, this is a fun read: http://deadspin.com/how-to-cook-lobster-tails-a-guide-for-people-who-dont-5979160). I figured I'd just have to plan a vacation to Maine some day where I could taste the good stuff, fresh from the ocean and prepared the way it should be.\\n\\nSuddenly over the past couple of months, I've noticed a few new food trucks popping up advertising New England-style lobster rolls.  Some surprisingly delicious eats can be had from the trucks in our local scene, so decided to give lobster another try.  My first stop was a different truck, not Garbo's, and it was okay but nothing I'd want to go out of my way to repeat.\\n\\nThen I began to see the photos from Garbo's...  the giant chunks of succulent lobster, very lightly dressed, and bursting from the top of the roll.  I read about how she comes from a family in the lobster business and that she ships her fish fresh daily from the east coast. She even served it two ways, either with lemon tarragon butter or traditional mayo dressing. I knew I had to go there, that *this* could be the lobster for me.\\n\\nFirst try was a bust: I arrived too late (75 minutes after opening) and she was sold out for the day. \\"Never mind the apologies, I'll take whatever you have,\\" I say. Clam chowder it was, and what a delight! Delicate and plentiful chunks of perfectly cooked clams, with tender potatoes and crispy bacon in a buttery, creamy broth. OMG, heavenly on a brisk day. Soooo good.\\n\\nNext time was the charm: got in line a few minutes before opening, my heart racing with anticipation. I ordered the $16 lobster roll meal, Connecticut style (with the lemon butter dressing), served with Cape Cod kettle chips, slaw, and a bottle of Maine Root ginger beer.  It was windy and chilly outside after a night of spring hail storming, so our group huddled in a sun beam and proceeded to chow down.  \\n\\nAhhhhhhh! Angels singing! Finally, the perfectly cooked lobster meat I'd known had to exist somewhere in this town! Mild, plump, tender, juicy, abundant, and fresh-fresh-fresh!  \\n\\nI could have done without the Sweetish Hill bun (which was totally fine), as I only wanted to be alone with my preshhhhh-cious sea floor walker....  Maybe Heidi will read this review and begin offering the gluten-free lobster roll option, served on a bed of 3 bibb lettuce leaves for making perfectly delicate lobster lettuce wraps?\\n\\nNot into lobster (or maybe can't stand the idea of a $16 lunch at a truck)? Garbo's usually has another option or two as daily specials that could get you under $10-11. The two times I've been, the special has been crab salad sliders, and you best believe I'll be trying that next.\\n\\nKnow before you go: FB and Twitter (linked from the top left corner of the Garbo's website) are the most up-to-date ways to find out where the truck will be parked each day and when they will be open. She sticks mostly to north Austin locations around 183 & Mopac, but I heard her say she is going to start doing a Monday lunch downtown sometime soon.

It was very aromatic. too bad we didn't quite taste the bacon or see any. But still it was very good. \\n\\nWe didn't like the calamari. the first one came out was burnt, dark brown, and the little tiny squids were nowhere to be found because it was all dried out. The waitress took it back and offered a remake. the second one came out was better. a lot fluffier and a lighter tan. however, like the first, it was completely overpowered with fried onions and other veggies that there was hardly any squid for $13. So while the plate was big, the calamari was lacking. \\n\\nWe also ordered the wood grilled salmon. it came with asparagus which was very good. These were the smaller kind so it was very thin and tender. The salmon sat on top of a bed of arugula and whipped potatoes underneath the arugula. We were very looking forward to the salmon but it was overcooked and completely dry. it was tough to break and chew. \\n\\nWe did enjoy the butternut squash pizza. light and flavorful. the only complaint we had was that the pizza was very limpy, soaked through the crustm only the edges were crispy. \\n\\nWe also ordered the pan seared gnocci. We were all very confused by this dish. only 1 of the gnocci was seared. the rest was just boiled and had zero flavor. lastly, it was supposed to be hand pulled gnocci but the description says potato dumpling, the texture was flat, moist and is not chewy or have zero elasticity to it. maybe i got this all wrong?\\n\\nthe service was ok. we had to ask a couple of times for lemon wedges and for water. the dishes weren't picked up eventhough we were asked several times how the dishes were but the soiled dishes were left on the table. It was overly noisy where we sat - by the bar. making conversation was a bit hard and had to shout several times. Overall the experience was good. i would still recommend folks to come here but perhaps avoid some dishes. \\n\\nHighlight were the Brussels Sprouts and the pizza. \\n\\nI gave this place a 3 star because it's not deserving a four.

Sadly, food quality can only carry you so far. \\n\\nIf you are a to-go queen like I am, this is unequivocally NOT the place to go. \\n\\nIf you are vegetarian, this is unequivocally NOT the place to go.\\n\\nThrough multiple visits, they have given me 4 wrong orders, 3 of which were prepared with meat after having specified a vegetarian order. The other time was a failure to include a component of the order. After having called back and promised a refund, it did not happen. Overall, it weighs out to approximately 50% accuracy on their food prep. This is due to staffing and training inefficiencies (wrong orders sent, mixed up tickets, etc...).

But one thing or another, we were not able to get to it until today, which happens to be last day I could use the deal(I know, I'm a procrastinator). \\n\\nThe pub is in the same complex as Barnes & Noble at georgia tech. We were welcomed and seated promptly. The decor is very much pub-ish, you know those intentionally grimy looking floors and big pipes over your head and all. When We told the waiter that we have the deal from scoutmob, he explained what we are getting with the deal. \\n\\n1) Any two burgers from their menu including today's special.\\n2) Two monday brew beers\\n3) one dessert to share\\n\\nNeither of us drink beers so we just asked for some water but the waiter seemed confused and had to check with his boss lady if we can use the deal without having the beer. I don't see why it would be a problem, it's not like we were asking for refund for beer. Finally he came back and told us that we can use the deal without beer. They could have asked if we wanted soda instead. I would have settled for just water but would have appreciated the gesture. No big deal.\\n\\nWe ordered,\\n1) Bobby Dodd burger(with fries on side)\\n2) Today special lamb burger with feta(with goat cheese mashed potatoes on side)\\n3) warm red-velvette brownie with vanilla icecream\\n\\nBobby Dodd burger was huge! it was a half-pound black Angus burger topped with stinger sauce, cheddar cheese, two bacon strips, one egg sunny side up, lettuce, tomato and two onion rings served with fries. I had to deconstruct the burger just to be able to eat. The stinger sauce tasted just like ketchup and Yolk in the egg was runny, as it should be. It wasn't the best burger I have tasted but I liked it. My only complaint is that the onion rings were unbelievably greasy. Probably the oil was not hot enough. \\n\\nWhile the ' Bobby Dodd Burger' was overwhelming(in a good way), the lamb burger was quite opposite - very underwhelming. Somehow the lamb burger and feta combination didn't work here. Also, there was absolutely no seasoning in the lamb burger. I used to think there is no way one can screw up mashed potatoes but I was proven wrong here. It was bland and I have tasted better mashed potatoes made from the ready-made mix.\\n\\nFinally the dessert - let me just say, this is the best part of our meal at 'The Barrelhouse'. The warm red-velvet brownie was huge and sitting on top of it was the nice scoop of vanilla icecream. Two of us were fighting to get more bites and I would have licked the plate off if the pub wasn't crowded. I'm still salivating just thinking about it. One thing though, we had to rinse our mouth several times to get the red color off. I am guessing, they had to use extra color to make the brownie batter red. Its food grade color, so I don't care. \\n\\nAnd our waiter was very nice throughout, so the service is good here. \\n\\nAt the end of the day, I don't know if it's worth the drive to this place just for burger and dessert. There are definitely better burger joints in town like zinburger and Grindhouse 'Killer'. But if you are living in the neighborhood, you may want to check out this place after 5 pm on weekdays. They have $6 burger and beer deal on monday and several other deals everyday. \\n\\nThree and half stars"},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Yes, it's pricey and there's a huge wait, but it's simple, fresh, delicious food.

It's not your typical clam chowder, loaded up with potatoes and so thick and starchy that your spoon could stick up in it.

Feels weird to describe it this way, but this recipe for clam chowder honestly respected clams, and let them lead the show, and showcase their flavors. It wasn't a potato soup with a few hunks of clam (as most chowders I've had were).\\n\\nThe stone crab claws were incredibly fresh, and I love the hot mustard dipping sauce that came with it.

These brussel sprouts were fried with cheese and other delicious things and were incredible.\\n\\nWe tried a few different pasta dishes, unfortunately I cant recall the names, but all the pastas were amazing. We also ordered a few pizzas and the prosciutto one was excellent. The restaurant is known for their Kobe meat balls which everyone raved about. Personally, I thought they were okay, tasted like regular meat balls to me, so I don't know what the hype was about.\\n\\nFor dessert, the chef actually made up a special platter just for our table. We had the honeycomb chocolates, peanut butter chocolate stick things, and donuts with a chocolately goodness filling and vanilla sauce. I believe the donuts and the peanut butter things were actually items off of their sister restaurant's menu (Coast) and the chef was nice enough to make it for us.\\n\\nThe service here was excellent, and our server made sure to top us our wine throughout the night.

The ambiance was dark and intimate, with (of course) a gorgeous view of Portland.  The decor was nothing to get excited about, but it definitely wasn't a dump either.\\n\\nParking was convenient, as they have two garages which they validate, making it one of the most convenient places to get to downtown (I hate paying for parking!).  We had reservations, and were seated promptly near, but not by, a window.\\n\\nWe started with the duck and steam bun appetizer.  The duck was moist with a wonderfully seasoned slightly crispy skin. The steam buns were better than I expected, as was the hoisin sauce, and the bites of sesame seeds were a fantastic addition.\\n\\nThe dinner menu is pretty basic, and nothing sounded particularly exciting to me; I'm just not much of a steakhouse person, seeing as how I don't eat steak or seafood!  I went with the pork tenderloin with apricot marmalade.  The pork was well cooked with some pink in the middle, which I found difficult to eat as I tend to only eat overcooked proteins.  The mashed potatoes were aggressively seasoned, which I LOVE, and the marmalade was a good accompaniment to the pork.\\n\\nFor dessert I had the lavender sugar doughnuts which were to die for!  I am a sucker for a doughnut and these where just wonderful.  They came with a sweet whipped cream and a chocolate sauce on the side for dunking.  So yum.\\n\\nDue to prices, this isn't the type of place I would go to often, as the food just wasn't that exciting to me, but I can't say that I didn't have a wonderful time.  Breaking it down, I'd say it's three star food, five star view, four star atmosphere and service.  So overall, let's call it a four."},{"name":"Sa Bai Thai Cuisine","address":"4440 NE 131st Pl","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Crazy good in the middle of nowhere.

It will be a memorable experience, to say the least.\\n\\nMy friend and I arrived at 12:30 on a Tuesday, and the place was busy, but there were a few empty tables and we were seated immediately.\\n\\nI knew what I was getting before walking through the door: the HOT LOBSTER ROLL. It's gotten so much attention and acclaim, I simply had to try it, and I'm so glad I did. I was excepting a delicious meal, but good god... it was so much more. The first bite sent me into a state of pure ecstasy. My eyes just shut, and for a moment, nothing existed but the unbelievable flavors in my mouth. The meat was piping hot and slathered with delicious butter that was absorbed by the delicate brioche bun. It was ridiculously rich, but I did not feel remotely heavy or sick after devouring the monstrosity-- Seriously, even if you're on a diet, eat this lobster roll. You won't regret it nor feel guilty.\\n\\nOne downside to the utter deliciousness and popularity of their lobster roll is that Neptune's FRENCH FRIES go unnoticed, which is a sin. These fries were some of the best I've had in a while. They were served right out of the fryer, and had this incredible seasoning on it that made them taste unlike any other fries I've had.\\n\\nThe friend had the CLAM CHOWDER, and he said it was the best he'd ever had. Unfortunately, I couldn't try it because it wasn't pescatarian, but I can vouch that he was swooning after every slurp.\\n\\nFor my friend also ordered the CASCO BAY MONKFISH, and it was delectable; he consumed every last crumb.

Speaking of...\\n\\nThe oysters are fabulous, a myriad of fresh, local deliciousness that only New England can seem to deliver.

I also ordered a bowl of clam chowder, which was hands down the best I've ever had.  Very creamy with succulent clams and potatoes.  I also split the famous lobster roll (hot with butter, recommended) and fries.  The lobster is impressive, extremely tender and flavorful on a toasted hoagie bun.

They have pretty good happy hour pricing on food and drinks, too, although I will say that their newest happy hour snack is advertised as \\"two dollar sliders with fries\\", which is awesome, except that it's only one slider and, like, 10 fries.  Eh, skip that one...but I would recommend their grilled cheese (four different cheeses smooshed inside crispy grilled bread and served with a yummy fruit chutney). \\n\\nWe have always had good service here also, which to me is just as important as the  menu selection and the food preparation.

The beef tostada is my \\"healthy\\" choice: a heap of shredded lettuce, cheese, oil and vinegar atop cubed steak in spicy gravy drenching the once-crispy tortilla at the bottom (actually quite delicious and affordable). The cheese enchilada is a guilty pleasure, and the rice and beans are scrumptious. The mondongo is made with steak and thus probably is nothing like the real thing (which would be made from tripe), but is nevertheless a unique and yummy stew that I get on days when I'm not quite able to handle the chile verde.

However, I can definitely focus in on what Paddlefish was all about, at least from my perspective. \\nReserve ahead of time. You'll be glad you did. \\nThe venue was beautiful. Made you feel like you were on an actual yacht drifting in the water. And since you're in Florida, take advantage of the great weather and ask for outdoor seating! You'll be glad you did. You get a big view of the lake (and water) you are eating on. Upstairs is nice too. Great view of Disney Springs and great cocktail drinks. \\nAnyways, let's get to the most important part- the food and drinks.\\nWine was ridiculously under poured. I asked the waitress how many ounces is my glass of wine. She responded with \\"3 ounces.. errr.. maybe 4. I'll double check\\". Wow- 3 ounces of wine. Plus, she never came back to follow up. Not that it really mattered. It is what it is; I wasn't gonna argue ounces and ask for more when that's their \\"standard\\" pour. But $14 a glass and you're giving me under 4 ounces of wine? I felt I was extremely ripped off. \\nFood time: we had the mussels for starters. Mussels were delicious but they were extremely small. Some shells didn't even house any mussels! They were empty. We received bread for a starter as well. The butter was a cinnamon butter I believe. Best butter I've ever had. Entrees: we ordered a jambalaya, lobster risotto, Hawaiian Opah, and salmon. The jambalaya had shrimp, sausage, crab, and rice all mixed in. Has a hint of spicy to it as well. Lobster risotto was prepared with a small lobster on the bed of sticky yellow rice (lobster rice). Hawaiian Opah was delicious- it was a macadamia crusted fish cooked medium rare on a bed of crab rice. Delicious! Lastly, the Salmon was just that- a salmon. Just a small piece of salmon served with a garnish. Granted, the quality of the salmon was superb. Cooked to a perfect medium temperature, crispy on the outside/nice and soft on the inside. \\nI understand that this place focuses on quality over quantity, which is why prices are so high. But I mean... it's still too overpriced. $35 for that salmon. Literally, a piece of salmon. \\nThis place is a great date night spot, yes. But it will sure put a dent in your wallet. \\nOh! And at the end of your dining experience, the server brings back postcards. They are completely free and PaddleFish pays for the stamps.

It was busy, no reservation for parties under 7, wait-your-turn-kind-of-a-place.  But boy was it worth the wait.  The hostess was amazing.  She had her eye on each and every guest, doing her best to estimate the wait.  \\nWe left our name and cell phone number, and walked over to Powells.  She called us after 45 minutes and told us to head on over, better than the hour and a half that she had quoted.  However, when we arrived, a single man was still occupying our table for 4.  As he casually sipped on his last drops of beer, played games on his cell phone, and took up space after 3 others from his party were long gone, we longed for our table.  We had to wait an additional 30 minutes for our table, for which the hostess was forever apologizing.  No need, we were still in a good mood with anticipation of our meal.  She sent us a complimentary cheese board, not necessary, but such a nice touch.  \\nAnd so our meal begins.  \\nThe menu is definitely for those with an adventurous palate.  Luckily, our kids like to eat well, so we were able to find something for everyone. \\nWe started with Steak Tartare and Foie Gras.  Both were absolutely delicious.  My husband is a Foie Gras snob, and his heart went pitter patter with each small bite that he savored.  \\nOur entrees were wonderful.  We enjoyed homemade tagliatelle pasta, rich and creamy.  Cedar Plank Salmon, perfectly cooked.  I found the cedar to be overpowering, but the rest of the table loved it.  Duck Duck Potatoes, ummmmm wow.  Potatoes that are crisped in duck fat, topped with a perfectly sunny side up duck egg.  I wasn't expecting to be so delighted with this dish.  \\nOur kids came to life at the time of desserts.  The Fluffernutter, served in a mason jar, was a reminder of my New England upbringing, as this was a staple in my daily school lunch, just not in a mason jar.  Graham cracker in the bottom, peanut butter mousse, warm marshmallow, served with long spoons for the kill.

Straight up 5 stars. I went four days straight trying lobster rolls from Rhode Island and Massachusetts and I got to say that this one takes the cake. The lobster rolls here aren't just packed with flavor, hut also with quantity of meat. I haven't had a place where enough lobster had fell out of the sandwich that I could pair it with the side salad that comes with the dish as if it were prepared that way. There was just that much lobster. The flavor was also amazing. They have a butter option and a cold mayo and being a fan of buttered lobster I had to order it. The sides that you can choose are fries or salad. I honestly loves both choices so you can't go wrong here. The bread was perfectly toasted although one end was a little bit more soggy and started to fall apart. The wait wasn't bad, but then again I went midday around 2 and had to wait about 5 minutes. The wait gets a lot worse the later in the night you arrive, so if you aren't prepared to wait for 1+ hours then you should arrive before the rush.\\n\\nIt is a little cramped inside and some tables are joined in a way that you are sharing space with another party.

They have done this to me as well as people in front of me on line.  The first time I was there, my cab driver decided to get something to go and was on line before me. He was looking up at the menu and calling out what he wanted.  Part way through the order, I saw the cashier's eyes go vacant and just stare out the window.  The driver asked a question and didn't get an answer. I had to get the guy's (cashier) attention and actually had to tell him add things the guy ordered but the cashier never put into the system. The driver checked the bag before he left and there were things missing from his order that they had to charge him for and make before he could leave. Mine, that day was fine.  Went again a few weeks later and the cashier this time was a woman. I ordered a few things off the dollar menu and my bill should have been around $3.50.  When she told me my bill was $6 or $7 something I questioned her. She told me because I ordered the X, y, z value meal with sandwich, fries and drink. I corrected her and told her I ordered off the dollar menu because I did not want fries.  So she asked me again what sandwich I wanted and she entered it. Then said, and entered, an order of small fries.  I stopped her right there and told her For the third time, I don't want fries. You want me to have them, but I don't want them and I will not pay for what I don't want.  At that point, I told her I wasn't going to get anything at all. I shouldn't have to work that hard to get a sandwich and drink and pay the right price. So I sat and waited for more than hour for my ride to get there to take me home.

I've recommended to a few co-workers and gotten the similar sentiments. I also like the lamb over rice platter and combo platter which is lamb and chicken.

I'd say the food is two notches above normal bar food (which I am swearing off). I am tired of crappy menus and poorly made hamburgers.  Prime examples include Cypress Street Pint and Plate (right around the corner but total crap food) and Hand and Hand (nice place but horse food).  If you want real food in a bar atmosphere, The Barrelhouse is the place.\\n\\nI agree with some of the other reviewers that it costs a little more, although last Tuesday I scored some excellent $2 tacos.

Great vibe and bar. Tables are roomy, staff was happy and willing to explain the menu and recommend delicious wine pairings. Head Chef Shire even came around and chatted with each table and listed her recommendations. What a nice touch! We were impressed.\\nHowever, the food was lack luster. We ordered the mozzarella plate and beef carpaccio for appetizers. Underwhelming. Beef was perfectly cooked and presented, cheese was ok... We didn't finish either plate which speaks volumes. (We finish everything!)\\nFor entrees we ordered the Skate and Scallops and the Chilean Sea Bass with Oxtail. We realized after we had both ordered seafood, but felt confident in our selections. \\nThe skate was not cleaned; in that it still was attached to the cartilage. I had to scrape away the flesh in order to eat a bite without pulling bones out of my mouth. Such an odd choice to plate it that way. After scraping and three bites of cartilage I had lost interest. Scallops were cooked a rare medium-rare, just a bit under for my blood. The bass was a belly piece, not a nice piece. That also was a tad undercooked. Oxtail was an after thought. There was less than an ounce on the plate and was described as a hash... Potato strings does not a hash make. Entrees were small and riddled with smears, sauces, and purees. We were unsure what we were eating half the time. Perhaps the menu should have more detail or maybe we just went on an off night. Sad because we were celebrating our wedding just the night before and had looked forward to eating here for quite some time. \\nWe opted to pass on dessert because nothing else thus far was worth the $200 tab. \\nMy husband and I know food, know good food.

I find myself here at least once a week, and have even convinced my \\"standing in line for brunch is for idiots\\"-party-line husband that this is a great place to go.  In fact, if you want to know the few criticisms he has, they're as follows:\\n-why is the tuna melt so small?\\n-on that note, dishes aren't always consistently sized, so it's hard to know how much food you're really getting for the price. If you order the wrong things, you might end up with very little food for a high price\\n-why doesn't the food come out at the same time if there's only two people?\\n\\nI answered Shaun this, as I am now the Tasty defender: \\n-the tuna melt is small because it's delicious and all good things come to an end quickly, it's a zen thing\\n-some dishes are big and you get a great bang for your buck, others are dainty and it's not consistent so your best bet is to ask. Now we know: the korean fried chicken? wow so much food! the weekend biscuits n gravy: unexpectedly dainty. The duck a la plancha: waaaa why can't there be more, I understand duck isn't cheap but boy that half portion will leave you high and dry. The potatoes bravas: wow where did all this potato come from?\\n\\nOne last thing that makes me sad: there's no dining area seating during \\"mid-day\\" happy hour times. They could easily fill the whole damn restaurant with happy hour overflow, especially on weekends.  They claim it's to give the dining room a rest between brunch and dinner service.  While I agree this is important, is a four hour window totally necessary? The seats look so lovely and tempting at 4pm, when they have to turn you away from the bar because there is literally no room left.  On the other hand, I know most restaurants have limited happy hour seating, so I swallow this bitter pill and try to go to happy hour at a time where not too many other people will be there (5pm Friday, the place is exploding with people, show up at 4:30 or before if you want to live). \\n\\nSo there you have it.

Not perfect, but pretty close!"},{"name":"The Bistro On Park Avenue","address":"348 N Park Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3","text":"*Romantic type of atmosphere.\\n*Cool glasshouse you can eat in.\\n*Quite pricey.\\n\\nWe ordered the pizza bread something or other with chicken and fetuccini with chicken. Both were surprisingly good. The chicken with the pasta was cooked so that the breading was crunchy, it was great. I'd definitely go back. Because of the price though, our visits here will be limited."},{"name":"The Park on South Lamar","address":"4024 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Atmosphere was fun but the outside bartenders were not friendly. We sat at the bar and waited for awhile to even be greeted yet both ladies walked past us over and over. My guest wanted to leave. Drunk guests at the bar at 9pm yelling profanities as loud as they could, nothing was said. Other guests definitely did not appreciate that. Frozen mojito was delicious though!"},{"name":"Lebowski's Grill","address":"8909 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow.  Really really great.  I don't know what it is about bowling alleys and great food in Austin, but this place really hits the mark.\\n\\nI don't eat beef, so I got a crispy chicken sandwich with fries.  Let me say that I am picky about chicken sandwiches, and rarely order them because most places overcook the chicken and don't bother to flavor it much.  But the chicken sandwich at this place was PERFECT - juicy, tender, flavorful, and crispy.  Bun was spot on too.  I got the poblano sandwich which comes with chopped poblano peppers and onions from the grill, but I swapped the sauce out for a sriracha honey sauce they happened to have on special that day.  Really really solid.\\n\\nThe staff there were very friendly and accommodating, and thankful for all the attention that Yelp seems to be giving them lately (even though they've been there for 9 years, he said).  I will say that calling in my to-go order was tough because they only have one phone line and apparently their credit card machine was hogging it.  But keep trying ... it's worth it."},{"name":"JJ's Fresh From Scratch","address":"2950 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"they pile on the food , fresh filling enuff for two , my new sunday breakfast joint"},{"name":"West End Grill","address":"63 Mazzeo Dr","city":"Randolph","stars":"4","text":"Been there twice in the last week,  food was good, drinks were good, price is good.

The staff was friendly."},{"name":"Big D's Neponset Cafe","address":"497 Washington St","city":"Canton","stars":"4","text":"I don't know what is going on this place in the last 6 months?  I would have giving Neponset caf√© 4 stars all day up until a few months ago. My last few visits have been more than disappointing. I just don't understand what happened? The food and service have gone way down hill but yet it is still the same employees as usual."},{"name":"Italian Kitchen","address":"860 Burrard St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was delicious, authentic and nicely portioned. Service was slow however. This location is quite popular so book a table to avoid disappointment. The crackling pork and spicy calamari are out of this world! Pasta vongole is the bomb!"},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Came here for some brunch after lots of recommendations to check this place out.  There was a little wait, about 10-20 minutes, but they had a nice cozy little place to sit and hang out while waiting.  This is a hipster little joint with pretty much every breakfast item you could imagine.  They even have a little play area for kids to enjoy!\\n\\nI got the corned beef hash here, which was HUGE.  It came with eggs as well and some bread of my choice.  They also had amazing jam here, well lived up to their name.  The corned beef hash as pretty good, loved that they mixed it in with the hash browns.  Service here was good too."},{"name":"Stretch the Noodle","address":"232 SW Washington St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Like all the reviews said the owner at the cart is super friendly and smiley. The type of business owner you want to support. \\n\\nI ordered the veggie noodles with tofu. The noodles were good. I like to compare hand pulled noodles with Franks Noodle House and Shandong.... These were as good as Shandong for texture and chewiness. The flavor though was too much ginger and spicy. I love spicy, but to me the flavor felt flat. I don't know what else it needed but it needed more. There was an okay amount of tofu, sliced very thin. That was my favorite part."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},R=["disabled"],L={key:0},F={key:1};function G(n,e,s,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",F,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",L,"See more"))],8,R)):w("",!0)])}const D=c(N,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-8b7e3eda"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/56.md","filePath":"quotes/56.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/56.md"},Y=Object.assign(H,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(D)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
