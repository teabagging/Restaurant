I split a $7 cactus burrito with a friend after a night on the town.\\n\\nNow I know according to Yelp's pricing this is considered cheap but for Mexican food this is rather expensive and even more so considering that it is coming from a low-overhead cart.  Was it worth it?  Not even remotely!\\n\\nSo our burrito was warped in a barely warm flour tortilla so it had a rather unpleasant consistency; a little steaming would have done wonders.  The filling consisted of cactus (don't think it was grilled because it would have had a bit of a smoky flavor), white rice, lettuce and that was about all I could detect.  If there were beans they were in the other half of the burrito but that's hardly an excuse, there shouldn't be pockets of a component in a burrito!  The salsas they offered were rather bland and lacked any real kick to them.  And of course white rice?  Plain white rice?  In a burrito?!?  To top it off the rice was overcooked and mushy.\\n\\nHonestly, the food was DISGUSTING and expensive.  I suspect that is how this atrocious food cart stays in business, by overcharging those of us who feel adventurous and forgo checking Yelp before placing our order.\\n\\nMy advice, AVOID THIS PLACE!  I wish that Yelp offered an option in the \\"Good for\\" checkbox selection with the response \\"Nothing\\" because that is what this place deserves.\\n\\nP.S.

We had no problem using ours but I saw others who did which lead to minor issues for them.  \\n\\nThough we got the correct food delivered to us there was some confusion on our server's part and my friend ended up without his meal being delivered and me getting and extra portion that turned out to be his.  This turned out to not be a big deal and was quite understandable especially considering the hustle and bustle of the Easton lunch crowd.\\n\\nWe flagged down a server and told him about the mix up and he brought out a new meal for my friend free of charge with lots of apologies for the mix up.  As far as my buddy and I were concerned, they fixed the problem and didn't charge us for it so we were all good.  But this is where the 5th star of my review comes from: The manager came out and apologized for the issue, which we explained it was all taken care of, no harm no foul.  He still gave us free meal coupons for the next time we went there just for the inconvenience.  He even hunted us down as we left to make sure that he could say goodbye and apologize again for the mix-up.  That sort of customer service is a rarity these days so I would recommend anyone to go there because the food rules and because the customer service/appreciation is about as good as you're going to find anywhere."},{"name":"The Fish & Chip Shop","address":"1218 N Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"We came in on a Friday and it was crowded.  We made our way to the back which was really compact.  Being on a submarine would be more spacious.  Ordered drinks which was painful, yet entertaining. The man with the feather in his cap behind us was for real.  The tap blew so after 5 minutes of my half filled beer sitting at the bar, the nice bartender gave me a free half pint and then let me know the keg was dry.  OK I said give me a Ninkasi instead.  We then exited stage left into toe Tardes room or Tardis or something.  Looked around and it was amazing, so we went towards the back bar.  Then to my surprise C3po and R2D2 now things are looking up.  Tried to pose for a photo in front of the droids and right before the picture was taken the door swings open and two girls come flying through what I now is a door. We reassemble get the photo and then proceed to the patio we now know exists.  We discover a fire pit that looks welcoming.  It is nice and peaceful, until a jet engine starts and starts blowing wind and noise at us.  Then another compressors starts and we realize that the fish chips are being cooled by two containers from the 70's that probably average 65 degrees year round.  So if you ever have the misfortune of being here head to the patio.  It is less crowded and more manageable than the indoor maze of a bar.

But at the request of my son, who greatly loved their squid tempura, I returned last week.\\n\\nBoy am I glad that I did.  I was frankly amazed at the improvement.  The sushi (unagi and salmon) were fantastic- and the serving sizes (particularly of the unagi) were ginormous!   It was a real surprise- on par in taste with Musashino (my local favorite).  So I am definitely going to be visiting again soon- with family in tow.  It's a lot shorter trip than the drive up Mopac to Musashino, and easier to get in-and-out-of as well.  (I'll also be taking advantage of carry-out ordering.  Sushi snobs may find the idea of carry-out sushi completely antithetical to the experience- and some sushi places won't let you order for pick-up in the first place- but when you've got a big family and eating out is an ordeal, carry-out sushi rules.)\\n\\nI do think there are small ways they could improve their menu- particularly for families.  None of my kids like miso soup- so three bowls sat steaming and unfinished on the table.  I don't imagine kids under 10 generally enjoy miso- though a great many more might like Wonton.  They also should consider kid-sized beverages.  I ordered a Shirley Temple for my son- and they brought out what must've been a 20-24 oz. glass of it.  That's probably 400-500 calories in a drink alone-  all sugar.  A modest sized option in a kid-friendly (non-breakable) cup would be a lot easier all around.\\n\\nOne other thing. The service was very polite- but neglected to refill my ice tea for probably 10-15 minutes.  I tend to go nuts with with wasabi and like to have a drink at the ready.  So I was chewing up cubes of ice for quite a while- waiting for a new tea.

Regarding the menu they have tried to Eurofy the menu a little by offering crepes, cakes, and sweets - which is great - but the rest is really really average and quite similar to everywhere else... \\nI am not sure the owners realize that Atlanta has such an international dynamic as well as an educated and sophisticated population to draw from that they can afford the risk of going all the way with the Euro or Austrian concept. \\nAs for the music perhaps the owners are not aware of great classical music that can set the tone or that much of Europe has evolved and that cafes play all kinds of music, even ones in Austria and Germany.

They do have a variety of other typical Vietnamese dishes like pho, lemongrass chicken, etc. The more Vancouver people I encounter, the more frequent I hear them mention the Bun Cha Ca from Hoang Yen. I couldn't agree more.\\n\\nI think Hoang Yen makes their own fish cake that goes into the soup. It's well marinated and has a nice texture to it. The plus side is that they give you plenty of it. I'm a true fatty and with this dish, I don't want to share and so I end up getting the Dac Biet aka XL size all to myself. The broth is flavorful and suits the colder/wetter climate of the Pacific Northwest. I, personally like to use their chili oil with the broth, with extra limes and with all the fresh veggies that comes with it. \\n\\nHoang Yen is a tiny shop and there's always a wait. The place is practically a hole-in-the-wall and the service is generally sub-par.

We had asked the host if they could set up a table for 8, but they kindly asked for most of our party to be present before they'd pull the tables together - in retrospect this was a smart move since only two other people showed up.  When the other couple arrived, they were able to grab a seat at the bar right next to us, so we skipped getting a table all together.\\n\\nThe beer selection is a great combination of local micros and some special imports, and I even spotted a couple flavorless domestic bottles in the hands of some clueless guys.  When some of the best beers available are being served for only $4-$6, even with special \\"custom glasses\\" for serving, I think it's a great opportunity to try something with character.  I know my wallet thanked me immensely for choosing Cambridge Common after it was feeling beat up by the prices at Publick House.\\n\\nThe food is standard bar food, with a few surprises like deviled eggs and middle eastern platter and some unique burger combinations, but all done well and served fresh.  I enjoyed the nachos with chili, which were plenty big for sharing, our friends ordered some $1.95 Fenway Franks which were part of the specials, and a $5 burger w/ fries.  Even though my hubby and I both had a couple of beers and food, we were able to keep the bill under $35, and our friends were under $24 - which was awesome.\\n\\nThe only negative experience for the evening was another patron at the bar who was much too friendly for comfort and eventually fell off of his bar chair, which resulted in the immediate removal of the drink in front of him and an escort out of the building.  The bar handled it well and with minimal fuss- but it was definitely a sample of the characters you just might run into.\\n\\nOverall - I'm a fan because the beer selection is awesome, it's a good atmosphere for easy conversation, and the prices are great."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"1st Timers @ Mother's Velvet Lounge & Cafe.  \\n\\nEVERYONE was amazing from check in, during the wait for a table, to the bar and at our table.  \\n\\nSochi was our waitress and an absolute sweetheart!

(Why do I always talk about the physical space first? You'd think I was some kind of aesthete when, in reality, my desk at work looks like a dumpster vomited on it.) We've also had great, attentive service every time we've been, even being comped for a tres leches cake, for no other reason than...my good looks?

Still, there are enough non-tequila based cocktails to wet your whistle. (By the way, that boozy horchata drink is a bit rich, so be forewarned.)\\n\\nI like the food overall. The tacos pastor are great as are the chile rellano (my standard for Mexican restaurant assessment). However, the aforementioned picadillo enchilada? Uh, they all can't be winners. I mean, I expected some killer picadillo-like filling, but instead it's just basically browned ground beef. Step up the filling or rename it to \\"beef enchilada\\" por favor. The prices are a bit on the high side especially if you compare Superica to abominations like the El Azteca That Killed a Guy, but if you stay away from the $11 cocktails, your final bill shouldn't be too bad.

And I thought the menu was pretty boring - nothing there that I was really excited to try.  I just sorta \\"settled\\" for the crab cakes when the waitress told me they were known for them.  And what really killed me is the prices.  I mean c'mon, there's no rocket science going on here.  Aside from the overhead costs for the location, why really does my crab cake have to cost $24?

My helpful server grabbed it, offered a dusting of powdered sugar which I accepted (it didn't need the extra sweetness, but it seems customary and looks nice), and I paid the $4. I didn't need a whole cannolo, but they're smart to only offer one size, since everyone wants to try one and I think half the crowd would go for a mini $2 version if it were offered.\\n\\nThe crushed hazelnuts and the lightly hazelnut-flavored ricotta filling were delicious. The shell was fine, but a bit soft, probably due to being pre-filled. Though the lines move at a decent pace and I imagine my cannolo wasn't filled more than 20 minutes earlier, that was enough time for much of the shell to get softened where it is certainly meant to be crispy. That's a pretty fundamental problem, and makes the whole idea of Mike's a little ridiculous to me. In hindsight, I should've gone to one of the many local bakeries that fills their cannoli fresh. But alas, I'm a tourist, so I did the tourist thing, and learned my lesson.\\n\\nI'd consider giving just 2 stars (given a long line for a not-cheap not-fresh cannolo), but the atmosphere is kinda fun (even if touristy) and the flavor selection is fairly impressive, so 3 it is."},{"name":"Cambridge Common","address":"1667 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Ok ok, so this place has an impressive beer selection.

She was prompted to show her ID where she then told the server that she was under 21. The server then told us that the patio and bar area was 21 and up during reverse happy hour. There is no signage stating that policy. I then asked for a manager and he came over and was very rude and snarky. (His name was Sam Fox). I asked him what the policy was for happy hour was and he said that the patio and bar area was 21 and up by the sushi bar was open to all ages. I then asked him if the sushi bar would accomadate a party of 5 and he said that there was a group there now but they he would ask them if they were wrapping up. He returned and told us that that party ordered more food and that it'd be a while before they left. I then asked him what our options are and he said to wait for the sushi bar. I then asked if he would make the exception of us sitting in the dining room of the restaurant and he blatantly said \\"no\\". Again, he was very rude. \\n\\nI work in customer service and I would NEVER talk to or treat a customer the way he talked to me. Also, I would have made an exception for a party of 5.

Why you ask??\\n- They are ultra-fresh (cooked only when you order them so they never sit on some baking rack for hours if not days)\\n- Made with delicious batter that produces light mini-donuts with just the right amount of outside crisp and inside chewiness\\n- 2 Simple yet perfectly balanced flavors from which to choose: salt & honey or cinnamon & sugar (I highly recommend trying both).  As of the writing of this review it looks like they just added a new flavor that involves Nutella (can't wait to try that one!)\\n- Totally affordable ($2 for 3, $3.50 for 6, or $4.75 for a dozen)\\n\\nAlso Nate is perhaps the most charismatic and positive owner I've ever met, and his staff were all overwhelmingly friendly and caring.\\n\\nAs with any donut,, I strongly recommend you eat a Pips PIPING HOT, straight from the fryer...cold pips are still good, but definitely do not have the same pizzazz!\\n\\nOthers have raved about their chai, but I haven't tried it yet.  I hope to be as impressed with their chai as I was with their donuts; if that's the case I'll be a lifelong customer!\\n\\nI'm not really sure what they mean by the \\"original\\"  in their name since Daily Dozen @Pike's Place in Seattle has been around for years with a near identical mini-donut machine ....but that being said, they're at least unique to Portland and the donuts here are truly spectacular, so I can't really dock them any points for that.  Next time I go I'll ask about the origin of the \\"Pips Original\\" name to straighten it all out.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Go to Pips.  Eat their donuts.

The cafe interior, and I mean this literally, is like an old small basement room with a fresh coat of paint on the exposed concrete brick walls. The ceiling is low, the space is small, the one work of art oh the wall is indescribable and the overall sense is claustrophobic. It is hard to believe that the dining room and kitchen, which is out of sight, can pass city codes for a restaurant. \\nAll this does not mean that it is bad. There is outdoor seating, although quite limited because this is a small neighborhood cafe in every sense of the word. Every patron there was seated outdoors. The dining room was empty for reasons stated. I have given it two stars because the service was somewhat unfriendly, the person seemed entirely bored with what he was doing and the sandwich that I ordered which was supposed to have ham and pork in it had so little meat that it was essentially a grilled cheese sandwich. It was a good grilled cheese sandwich and I like grilled cheese, but that is not what I ordered. I also had the Viennese coffee which was excellent.

Wasn't really sure where they had decent crawfish at in Austin, since I'm from Houston, but my friends told me to check out this place so I did. It was between 8-9pm and I got lost because their parking lot was so dark and all you could see was their open sign, since the whole plaza was closed. There seemed to be no parking lot lights, which was a safety issue for me because I'm pretty paranoid about this kinda stuff being from Houston and all, and you know them Houstonians be crazy.\\nMy friends and I ordered crawfish, soft shell crab and fried shrimp.

I don't understand why many seafood restaurants make their place look like a hole in a wall? The booths looked a little outdated and the chairs belonged in a diner. Actually now that I think about it, the chairs and tables were 70s diner theme and the walls were seafood interior? Bad combo. \\nThe service wasn't that great. They laid out a table cover for the table for us to eat crawfish on, and the downside to that? They give you a bucket to throw your own crawfish shells in. I eat my crawfish pretty neatly with my index finger and thumb. In case I need to use my other fingers for my phone or scratch my head. The fact that they gave us a bucket, pretty much meant for me to grab a handful of my shells and throw it in there. That was very messy and dirty! I'd expect the waitresses to dump it for me, since they are getting tipped. It was like self service.

But the turnover is very quick, so they're making them as fast as they can! You are NOT getting a stale cannoli! \\n\\nI tried three different flavors, the original and the one with chocolate chips and chocolate filled. Honestly, I feel like you can't beat original cannolis. Call me a purest! The others were good, but the original was the way it was meant to be!\\n\\nI guess the one downside I have with the place is the hype and the lines. The problem when places get too popular is just that - they're too popular. It's worth the wait, but the wait also prevents you from making it a regular destination. Or so it did for me! As someone visiting, we only had limited time and that prevented us from ducking back in to pick up some cannolis to go! \\n\\nHowever, if you're going to the North End for dinner and you want an \\"experience\\", save room and don't get dessert at the restaurant. Wait in the line and get the good stuff! You won't be disappointed!"},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We found this place after going on Yelp and reading the reviews on the wild boar ribs.

Tonight I was trying their dinner with my family. The whole meal was great! None of their dishes that we ordered disappointed me!! \\n\\nIt was good that we got to the restaurant around 5pm. Six tables had been reserved! We only did walk in and got a table luckily. \\n\\nThe servers were great. We bugged them a few times to get different things such as hot water, more bowls and spoons, and even asked for free refill vermicelli and rice noodles. (Note: their black board on a wall really States: free refill - rice noodles, vermicelli, bread and butter). \\n\\nWe ordered spicy baguette sticks with chicken and pork liver paste. The baguette was soft and crispy! We had never tasted the soft and creamy chicken and pork liver paste anywhere else except here. We tried pho bo before. It was still excellent that now I don't like any pho at other Vietnamese restaurants except this one. Haha. The pho xao was a dish of pan fried rice noodles with saut√©ed mushrooms and other vegetables. There was a lot of lettuce and cilantro on top of the pho xao. I was totally fine with a lot of lettuce and cilantro but maybe some people wouldn't like that much. The bun cha was a dish of pork meatballs, crispy spring rolls, some lettuce and cilantro, and vermicelli with some spicy fish sauce. My family loved this dish a lot. We also ordered iced coffee that it was similar to the one that we ordered from a Hong Kong cafe. \\n\\nLast but not least, we ordered a chocolate tart and apple chaussan. Wow the chocolate tart looked like a simple piece but it was excellent! Whenever I had a bite, I would say \\" Yum!\\"  The tart was not too sweet. The sweetness was about right. The apple chaussan was big.  The pastry was made by butter. Of course it must be good. \\n\\nI couldn't use any more words to describe how well the food was at this restaurant. Just come and try it yourself.  Their lunch/brunch and dinner menus look simple and do not have a wide variety of choices but their list of food is good enough for you to choose from and whichever you choose the food is very good unless the chef (who is the owner of the restaurant) screwed up on cooking."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"The only reason to put up with the awful service and bad food is the view.

I wasn't really expecting the food to seem very authentically Mexican since it's advertised as Tex-Mex, but was really surprised when the tacos were very minimalist-style, with an emphasis on the perfectly cooked, wonderfully tasting meat. The steak tacos are literally one of the greatest things I've ever tried. \\n\\nSeriously, I love a Mexican restaurant that serves you chips and salsa upon your arrival at the table.

I can't wait to go back to try some of the other menu items, although it'll be hard to peel myself away from those steak tacos. The cocktails were definitely creative, but when I go to a Mexican or Tex-Mex place, I appreciate the option of just a good, old-fashioned margarita. All of their specialty cocktails had a bit of a spin on them and I didn't see just a classic margarita. No worries, though; the Texas Star with St. Germain and grapefruit was just perfect.

The salmon rockefeller is always a popular signature dish -- a huge cut of salmon filet with a heaping mound of crabmeat on top.  They don't have the most extensive wine list in town (mostly Sonoma/Napa Valleys), but there are enough options to pair up with your entrees and appetizers.  Drunkards won't have to worry about going thirsty here.\\n\\nHow's the service?  Well, the staff can be stretched a little thin when it's super busy (a la NYE), but they're attentive and friendly for the most part.  I give bonus points to any place where they use those little metal crumb scoopers for us messy types.  I always feel kinda bad when I inadvertently drip some soup or sauce on the tablecloth.  Someone will come by to try to clean it up with a scooper, and they end up making these weird smiley face smears on the nice linen.  Oh well.  Now if they passed out pre- and post-meal hot wash cloths to clean your hands (I also like to use them to wipe my face like a rabid raccoon), then I'll award them the full set of fancy points. \\n\\nPricey?  Ehh... it's not too bad, the prices are reasonable for the portions and quality.  You won't have to bust open that old Thundercats piggy bank (SNARF!).  I think value-wise, you get a lot of food for your money.  I always hate shelling out $40 for two ounces of fish even if it is borderline endangered (cough... cough... Eddie Vs... cough).  \\n\\nSo what's bad?  Not much.  Parking along Colorado St stinks.  The single bench waiting area is too small.   Aforementioned potential to make me look like a manhole cover.\\n\\nSummary?   I lubs Gumbo's.   Even if they are owned by a mega-conglomerate parent company (I did see another one in downtown Denver with the same logo and everything).   I've dined at the downtown location at least a dozen times, and I would have to say that each meal was muy excellente.  Our most recent visit to partake in their New Year's Eve offerings was no exception.  Disclaimer:  we were cold, tired, and famished from the First Night festivities so I would've probably given a half-eaten bag of stale kettle korn an equally positive review."},{"name":"Nikolai's Roof","address":"255 Courtland St NE, Fl 30","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I have been meaning to go here for years.

The chicken salad croissant arrived as 2 very small, mini croissants with just a tiny spoonful of chicken salad and a 1/2 handful of fries.

I would return, but probably not for brunch."},{"name":"Great Bay","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I sooo wanted to LOVE this place, but I couldn't. First of all, when I walked in to inquire about a table for 2 (we did not have a reservation) I was told it would be an hour but that there was seating at the ceviche' bar. Well, the entire 2 hours we were there, at the bar, at least 10 dining tables remained empty (but there was an hour wait??)\\n\\nNormally, I don't like to eat at the bar because it's crowded and loud and not very cozy for dinner for two.  But, this was a bar made for people to eat at it so it was comfortable. However, we did have people seated to our immediate left and right so my boyfriend and I were seated very close to each other and thus we talking very closely. (We like to play a game where we try to guess what the story is of other people in the place.  Like, \\"they look like a first date\\" or \\"she's totally his sugar-mama\\" or \\"that couple hasn't spoken to each other in ten straight minutes\\"...fun stuff like that). Well, since we were kind of whispering and space was tight our heads were very close together. The reason I am giving this much detail is because each time the waitress came up she literally popped her head in between us. It was terribly awkward. She just kept appearing out of nowhere and sort of creeping up and popping her head into our conversation. Strange.\\n\\nWe ordered drinks (me, a \\"Ghost of Mary\\" which was delicious and he, a Mojito, equally delicious he claimed.) Then we waited for about 5 minutes and then the waitress popped her head in between us again and asked my boyfriend what his drink order was again. Well, everyone forgets, it's okay. But, after another 5 minutes still with no drinks we caught her on the way by and asked if we could put a food order in before the drinks came. So, we ordered and waited at least another 5 minutes before we got our drinks. Granted, we ordered specialty drinks but 15 minutes is a long time to wait esp. since we ordered off the list of the bars \\"special drinks\\".\\n\\nIronically enough it took 15 minutes to get a drink but all 4 of our appetizers/small plates came at the exact same time: \\n- The Arugala salad with goat cheese & walnuts was okay. It wasn't bad but nothing stood out. ($9 is maybe a bit high but totally acceptable for this kind of place.) \\n- We also ordered the appetizer special because our waitress really sold us on it \\"sweet Maine Shrimp that are only in season very briefly and this guy from Maine brings them all the way down here...\\"  Well, they were fried in way too much oil. They were soggy and there was a pool of oil and the bottom of the bowl. Plus, the shrimp were about the size of crawfish (and were served with their head still on so they actually looked a lot like crawfish). ($10 was not a bad price but the dish was a total let-down)\\n- The crab salad was a complete disappointment. I guess it doesn't help when you sit at the ceviche' bar and you watch the chef take the crab salad out of a tupperware container and put in on a plate. And, the portion was very small - amounted to maybe 2 tablespoons. (At about $14 it was overpriced for the portion)  \\n- The Halibut tacos were delicious. By far, the tastiest appetizer of all! The problem - regular tacos are already small but this thing was  a quarter of the size of a regular taco. And each one cost $6. Six dollars for a 2-bite taco = $3 a bite. That's an expensive taco. ($12)\\n\\nSo, at this point we've spent about $65 on very little food & 2 drinks and my boyfriend is still hungry. He's not really a big eater. We often like to order a handful of appetizers instead of entrees so we can try different things. But, the portion sizes of everything we had were so small so in this case it was a bad idea. \\n\\nI had commented earlier that someone at the bar was eating a burger that looked really good. So, here we are at Great Bay where we came specifically for the seafood and my boyfriend orders a burger (I assured him I would have some of it and help him with the fries). Well, it took us about 20 minutes from the time we ordered it till the time he got it. We were tempted to cancel it. Well, here's the kicker: it was probably the best damn burger either or us have ever tasted! And the fries were delicious too.\\n \\nSo, the bottom line: I really liked the style of the restaurant and the acoustics (very big place but not loud). Service was spotty --- we were there for almost 2 hours because everything took forever). Most of the seafood that we tried didn't stand out and was overpriced. But, if we're ever looking for a really good burger and a $12 martini in a great atmosphere, maybe we'll go back."},{"name":"The Cheesecake Factory","address":"100 Cambridgeside Pl","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I've been here three times and all three times received poor service in some shape or form.\\n\\nSome of the waiters are super friendly and very professional and the food quality is on par with all other CF locations. \\n\\nHowever, in my most recent visit there were four people joking around loudly at the hostess stand that were swearing and completely ignoring me for about a minute.

I was intrigued by the description of the Bloody Caesar and decided to go with . The bloody was described to have Tito's, Clamato juice, Umami tomato sauce, lime juice, pepper, sriracha and wasabi sauce. When I took a sip I tasted no alcohol, the drink had no spice or heat to it whatsoever and all I could taste was sweet tomato sauce. I asked one of the three bartenders for sriracha or hot sauce. She asked what I ordered and had a sip. She responded I see what you mean and offered to make another. She tasted it and realized the batch of bloody Mary mix was off. Instead of waiting for another batch to be made I opted for a glass of malbec. Mistakes happen.

I love this style of pizza, and it is always refreshing when a place uses fresh ingredients and real ovens, but there are simply better pizza places in Orlando. I think the reasons people are overrating this place are: the presentation of the pizza (it looks like it would be amazing), the ambience of the restaurant (it feels cool and unique), and the fact that it is vegan friendly (if you are vegan, I see why you would love this place). However, the pizza lacks flavor. They don't cook it long enough for the crust to fully absorb the flavor of the wood-fired oven (let alone be anywhere in the realm of crispy). One of my friend's pizzas was actually straight up undercooked and doughy. The garlic knots, while pretty damn tasty, are pretty much par for the course as far as garlic knots go (it's hard to screw those up). The sauce has almost no flavor (and also serves as the dipping sauce for the garlic knots). I'm not sure what the cheese is, but I didn't taste it. Lastly, the toppings are sparse and nothing to write home about. The best pizza place in Orlando remains Brick & Fire. The ingredients are just as fresh and more plentiful, the specialty pies are more numerous and inventive, the sauce has much more flavor, and the crust is far and away better in both texture and taste. Another good option if you really like this style of pizza is Red Oven in Universal CityWalk. While it lacks all the charm this place has (it's not a chain, but it's obviously run by a major corporation in a tourist area): it is a significantly better version of this place.

It was not bad - it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad.  \\n\\nThe first thing I checked out was the wine list.  It was not a terrible list but it was limited.  It was a very cold night when I went there so I really wanted a nice glass of red wine to warm me up; otherwise I probably would have stuck to beer or cocktails.  The wine I had was fine but it was just nothing too interesting.\\n\\nThere were a lot of options on the menu that sounded pretty good and I debated between getting a sandwich, of which there were many, or a real entree.  I decided on an entree and ordered one of the daily seafood specials - it was halibut with a fairly unremarkable but nice enough sauce.  I don't really remember much about the sauce but the fish was good - it was cooked well and had a nice flavor.  It also came with a nice big baked potato with all the good stuff (butter, sour cream, bacon, cheese, chives) on the side.\\n\\nFriends with me ordered the salmon, which looked very good and which seemed to be enjoyed; the BBQ chicken flatbread, which I tried and liked, although, probably would not order; and, the blue cheese wedge with soup (how can you miss on the blue cheese wedge, really?).\\n\\nThe staff was very pleasant and prompt and we had a nice big curving booth table for our group - it felt very cozy since it was cold outside.\\n\\n\\nThe parking was confusing - I always felt like I was driving into the restricted section of a construction site.  And, when we left the restaurant to walk to the parking deck, we had to pass through this courtyard/wind tunnel in order to get there.  I am sure this would not be an issue in nicer weather.\\n\\nOverall, the food (and wine) was fine but not very memorable.

The portions are the right size - big but not over the top.  I liked that the lemon poppyseed pancakes were subtle and not too sweet - it tasted like breakfast and not dessert as it should.  We also liked that they used Tillamook cheese in the omelet - we knew we wouldn't have time to make it to Tillamook on this trip but we definitely wanted to try the cheese from there.

I like doing brunch because I am allergic to eggs and find breakfast out to be a bit of a challenge (because of my egg allergy I am normally less critical when reviewing breakfast because I recognize that I am difficult for restaurants to accommodate and that my experience might not  be a typical one). I was a little surprised to see how they had varied their brunch selection, your choices were essentially, traditional breakfasts (eggs bacon ect or omelets), Salads (which I don't really find appealing for breakfast/brunch), burgers (only beef options), French toast or bennies. There are no vegan options and only the French toast is vegetarian, I ended up having to get the fruit plate as they didn't have veggie burgers available until 2 (which I thought was weird since other burgers were on the menu) and all the other sandwiches came on \\"egg dipped bread\\" with no option for substitution (again I thought that was a bit odd). \\n\\n\\nService: \\nWe were promptly greeted and seated, it took a bit for our server to come and then about 10 min to get drinks and about 30 min (from time of order) to get our meal.

My Fruit plate consisted of 2 pieces of pineapple, 2 cantaloupe slices, 2 honeydew slices, 2 pieces of orange, 1 piece of grapefruit and 2 strawberries. It also came with what might have been homemade yogurt (it was hard to tell) topped with honey. I found the yogurt to be the best part, with the fruit selection, quantity and presentation lacking.\\n\\nValue: \\nI was mixed on the value, my fruit plate cost $15, which was the same as the omelets and eggs benedict. So if judging value on my fruit plate I would need to say that the value is poor, but when considering the other meals, I would say average.\\n\\nOverall:\\nAverage, when you read the reviews of others, everyone goes on about the view.

I temporarilly stopped myself from going back to Zaftigs when I realized I had potato pancakes leaking out from the pours of my palms. \\n\\nFor 3 years I have been nothing short of a regular at this place called Zaftigs. Complete with a chubby woman on the menu cover and all, Matzo balls have never been this good. From pineapple sorbet to cinnammon raisin toast (with homemade date butter obviously) this place takes Coolidge Corner to another level. a Harvard Square rival? Hmmm....\\n\\nI could tell you some incredible stories from what has happened to me at the service bar. One day I met John Henry (co-owner of the Boston Red Sox) as he was sitting right next to me. When my server asked me what I wanted to order I looked at him and said \\"I'll have what he's having\\". He looked over at me, smiled, and I had the best breakfast I ever had in my life. \\n\\nI have to say that the food here is amazing, simple and tasty. The stuffed cabbages are a must try! Mediteranean omelette, french toast,  and BBQ Brisket Quesadilla are all outstanding. If you are looking for dissapointment, however, try the Chocolate French Toast (perhaps the only piece of the menu I don't like). The Pastrami sandwich tends to be a little fatty but if you know how to use a knife you're good to go. \\n\\nI will tell you that I have taken a lot of dates to Zaftigs over time. In fact, the best thing about taking a date to a Jewish Delicatessen is that you can \\"sin\\" inside and Jesus will never see you! \\n\\nZaftigs = chubby. A chubby you is a happy you.

Its stylish. The service is very attentive and professional.  The menu aims at Texas style BBQ which strikes me as being at very crossed purposes with the mood and decor.\\n\\nThe brisket is tasty, but unremarkable. The portion is decent by fine dining standards but miserable by  BBQ standards.  Seriously, $16 for one and a half slices of brisket??  The Salt Lick will haul all you can eat to your table for $2 more, and it will be a helluva lot tastier.  The only other thing on the plate was tiny portion of \\"house pickled vegetables\\".  You will only be impressed by these pickled carrots and whatnot if you have simply never had homemade pickled anything.  Hell, there are dive bars in Portland run by 3 hippies that crank out far better pickled exotics that they put on your table for free! Seriously, this is nothing of note.\\n\\nA friend had the ribs.  3 beef ribs.  That was $20.  Are you serious?\\n\\nThe food isn't of poor quality.  It is tasty.  The BBQ is good quality, but far from remarkable.  It's just that its a completely horrible value.\\n\\nWe ordered 2 of their \\"family style\\" side dishes: collard greens and broccoli with jalape√±os.  These qualify as \\"family style\\" if your family is comprised of bulimic ballerinas.  Each item was served in what would be a modest cereal bowl.  It was barely enough for 3 people to each get a taste.  My share of the broccoli was about 4 sprigs.  Any if there were any jalape√±os, we were at a loss to find them.  The collard greens were utterly pedestrian.\\n\\nThey bring 3 bottles of house sauces to your table.  The house BBQ sauce is slightly seasoned ketchup.  The mustard was akin to Denny's honey dijon.  The \\"hot\\" sauce was a joke.\\n\\nThere was a special beer on tap. It was served in the kind of glass you get orange juice in at IHOP.  I thought the server had brought me a taster.\\n\\nThe 3 of us were even on expense accounts so it wasn't even our money and we still felt completely ripped off.

Firsts can be really epic and great. \\n\\nIn this case, my 'first' here was Bad Sushi. And when I mean bad... I mean... wow. Bad.\\n\\nI should have figured something out by the fact I was the ONLY person in the restaurant. And that as soon as I was seated by whom I can only assume to be the waitress/hostess/whateveress, she left for the day, leaving only me and the chef the only living and breathing beings in the restaurant... along with a wide-screen TV of sumo-wrestlers as my dining companions...I really should have left and went to the pho place directly across the parking lot. Because I have been there before (note to self: review it) and it was Very Good.\\n\\nSo, I was seated, with a menu, and left to guess as to whom I would be ordering from. I came to the conclusion that the chef would be doubling as my waiter. I realized I probably should have sat at the sushi bar.\\nAnyway.\\n\\nThe menu has a very bad layout, it's quite confusing, which to me is a bad sign. Another one. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted, and generally when I hit up a sushi joint for the first time I will order the sushi sampler plate, because if that is good then I can trust that the rest of the menu will be good the next time I am a customer.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there won't be a next time.\\n\\nI started with an order of seaweed salad, because oh man I love seaweed salad! It was actually decent, but nothing special or mind-blowing like \\"I could live on this seaweed salad!\\". It was seaweed salad.\\n\\nI also had a bowl of miso soup, which was absolutely awful. It was soup... with a few pieces of FRIED tofu floating around. WTF? Who the hell puts fried tofu in miso soup? GROSS. There was also no seaweed in the soup, which left me disappointed, but also happy that I ordered the seaweed salad, because otherwise I would be in a seaweed crisis!!\\n\\nSo then I had my sushi sampling thingy. \\nOriginally it came with a California roll, but I hate hate HATE California rolls, so I switched that with a spicy tuna roll.\\n\\nBIG FUCKING MISTAKE.\\n\\nThe tuna ... tasted like... God, I don't even know WHAT it  tasted like, but DEFINITELY NOT FRESH... or even tuna. You know when fish has been sitting out for a while and it gets that filmy coating? Yea. That's what that was. Holy GOD it was just disgusting.\\n\\nLet's get to the nori that was wrapped around the rice. I do believe it was nori that had been previously used to perhaps scrub countertops or maybe used as a coffee filter, then left out to dry outside on the asphalt. Basically in so many words it was just horrible; dry, tasted extremely odd, and, well, gross.\\n\\nI suppose I should say one nice thing: the food was presented quite nicely. But there's that saying about covering up something gross because it will still be gross.\\n\\nMoving on to the rest; the rice was too vinegary. And there was too much of it. And I also do LOVE sticky rice - that is, the short-grain used for sushi, not thai, (but I do love thai sticky rice) but this was getting to the point of actually not being sticky, but gummy. Mmm, gummy vinegar! My favorite...\\n\\nThe rest of the fish (there was salmon, tuna ((god damnit), shrimp, and yellowtail. These didn't taste as off as the spicy tuna rolls did ... but DEFINITELY not fresh.\\n\\nI left hoping I would not be found dead in my car of food poisoning."},{"name":"Big City Burrito","address":"2426 Arapahoe Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"I miss you big city.

Yes, basic greek style made chicken, lettuce, tomato, onion, cucumber and yogurt sauce.   A greek salad with feta and the typical ingredients came on the plate. \\n  My date loves seafood and so she asked about the grouper. Skee, being the honest character he was stated \\"honey, if you want seafood and I see thats what you're looking at, don't order the grouper.  Im going to be honest and let you know its not for you\\".  Accepting his honesty she ordered the salmon dish.  \\n  To start we ordered the \\"DOLMATHES YALANTZI Grape leaves stuffed with rice, onions, pine nuts, herbs and spices\\", and two glasses of chardonnay.  \\n  I wasn't sure what to expect, so i tried the grape leaves.  It had a very different texture, most would probably like it, but I wasn't into it.  However, my date was happy so I just had a couple, sipped my wine and enjoyed her company.\\n  Skee was constantly checking on us to ensure we were happy, but not too much to be over bearing.  He was uplifting and made us laugh.  \\n  Our food was delicious, a little oily for me but I think that is normal with greek food.  My date said her salmon was awesome and I believe her as she eats a lot of seafood.  The salad was fresh as expected and overall the experience was great.\\n  \\n  My ranking of 3 stars is only because I don't know much about the food, it seemed great.

Sure, the service is slow. Sure, the employees always seem miserable (though the guy-who-seems-to-be-the-owner is happy, efficient, and polite). And sure, it's tiny with poor seating and atmosphere.\\n\\nBUT, if you take out, call ahead, and focus on the portion size and taste of the food, you...well, you want to eat their food every day! Their basmati rice ranges from good to outstanding, tending toward the latter. The stuff to put on top of that rice is at least as good. Their fish vindaloo is great...as are their spinach dishes...and chicken ones...and pretty much everything.

A breakfast sandwich is one (pre)poached egg, a slice of tomato, slice of cheese, salt and pepper. How in god's name is that a 15 minute ordeal? And why the hell would you wait to brew my coffee until after that's done when there are 4 open drip stations. \\n\\nSo...

The pizza crust was okay and had a nice fluff and chew. The toppings were fairly good as well. The sausage had a good spice, and the roasted garlic provided robust flavor. I'd say the pizza was pretty okay overall.

The server had our table and then a section on the complete other side of the restaurant, so our service started off less than stellar and then stayed that way. Once we finally ordered and the food arrived,  my chicken salad was very unappetizing with dry tomatoes that looked like they had been sitting out all day and wilted lettuce. Since our server was nowhere in sight, I had to walk up to the bar to ask for a manager. The person who seated us then came to the table, but it was unclear she was the manager. She looked at the salad, said it didn't look right and indicated she would fix it as she took it away. Several minutes went by and our server came back to see that my plate was gone. She asked if something was wrong, so I told her about the salad. She asked if the manager had taken it. I told her I wasn't sure and asked what the manager looked like, and the server described her condescendingly as, \\"the Mexican in the black shirt with long hair\\". Really? That's how you describe your boss?  Regardless, it was the manager who had taken the salad (still wouldn't have known that by the way she was dressed). Almost 10 minutes later, after my family had finished their food, the salad was replaced. While it looked much fresher and tasted fine, the whole experience, from the poor service, the filthy bathrooms, and the overall poor condition of the food served and the restaurant (dirty tables, dirty floors, side work out on the first table next to the hostess stand).

Maybe I secretly don't want too many people to know about this place. Many other reviewers have said how cool the setting is, how lovely it is to watch the planes coming and going, and how pleasant it is on their Friday \\"date\\" nights; but we've been coming regularly for years for the food. \\n\\nMy first piece of advice: Ditch the menu and order the specials. They're known for their great burgers, but chef Shep has a way with fish, which is always incredibly fresh. I am never disappointed. The fish specials usually come with vegetables, but you can always substitute a Greek salad for the sides. That's what I do. It's simple: romaine, feta, pitted purple olives, tomato, and pepperoncini with homemade Greek dressing (the restaurant is owned by a Greek American family). They'll almost always send out an extra dressing on the side in case you like your salad swimming in it, and you will never see anything that isn't perfectly fresh in the salad. Nothing wilted. Ever.\\n\\nAlso, on Fridays they serve Pasticcio, described as \\"Greek lasagna\\", and it is consistently delicious. It comes with the same salad described above. If you find yourself there on a day other than Friday, try the spaghetti for a taste of the fabulous Greek meat sauce that goes into both dishes.\\n\\nWe've been going to the Downwind for years. I'm sure I've eaten there over a hundred times. It was always a favorite place for my mother and I to take my sons on Saturday afternoons when they were little. She's long passed away, and they're in their mid-twenties to early thirties now, taking their significant others to dine at The Downwind, remembering how much delicious fun they had growing up near PDK.

I had been to this same location (I think) on Broadway years and years ago and I remember loving the food. We finally decided on a night last week and off we went!  I don't know if they take reservations; we just showed up and the place was packed. We didn't wait long, however, and soon we were seated. \\nThe menu had too many delicious items, making it difficult to decide on just two or three dishes then we both caught sight of the tasting menu for two. At $30 per person it might seem a bit pricey, but considering the number of differenet dishes you get to sample (9 courses), it's actually good value IMHO. The portions are decent and the dishes come tapas-for-two style, plus you get as much tumeric rice as you want. But don't fill up on the rice, there are a lot of dishes to sample and you will be full by the end of your meal.\\nFirst came the appitizer samplers. The Mango Kerabu is a delicious mango salad with sweet and citrus flavours blended in perfect harmony. The Roti Canai tasted like more and the Satay Chicken was moist and flavourful. If I had to pick a favourite it would be the Cumin Mussels. I could make a meal out of those, the rice and the roti and be a pretty happy camper.\\nThe flurry of appitizers was followed by four entre items: Rendang Beef Curry, Gulai Tiger Prawns and Scallops, Caramelized Ginger Black Cod and Sambal Green Bean. The portions were ample and everything was cooked perfectly, each bursting with its own flavour-statement. I absolutely loved the Rendang Beef Curry. This is a dish I've made myself for ages and I think Banana Leaf and I use very similar recipies. The beans were cooked and seasoned perfectly, we ate every last one. The cod and prawns with scallops were both cooked perfectly and oh so tasty. I honestly couldn't pick a favourite among the four, but again, if I had to it would be the beef.\\nBy the end of the entrees were were both feeling comfortably satiated. I had forgoten about desert and in the next moment our server produced a plate with two golden fried bananas joined at the centre by a generous scoop of real vanilla ice cream. A perfect finish to our epicurean journey.\\nOur server was a charming young lady who was attentive throughout the service and knowlegable about the menu.

But if I WERE to say that, it wouldn't be far from the truth. This Inner SE neighborhood bar is a fun and inclusive spot to kick back and have a few drinks. It may be listed as a gay bar, but the whole LGBTQWXYZ community is represented and welcome. \\n\\nCrush's menu features surprisingly good bar food that can accommodate most any dietary restriction, including some vegan yams with curry gravy that this carnivore would eat any day of the week. The mac and cheese is tasty, the hummus plate is varied and obviously not just an afterthought like at so many other places, and the Idaho Nachos are basically cheese fries that are delicious and belong on nobody's recommended diet. My favorite? The pulled pork sliders. You should eat them.\\n\\nCrush is all about the specialty drinks, most of them as delightfully fruity as the patrons. Oh, they're also strong. Watch out, compadres. These \\"girly drinks\\" pack a bear-sized whollop. For this hot hot hot summer my favorites are the Lavender Lemon Drop (house-infused lavender vodka, lemon juice and simple syrup served up with a sugared rim) or the Cheap Date (house-made ginger ale with fresh grated ginger & lots o' whiskey). They also do a lot of different margaritas that are 1) super strong 2) delicious and 3) on special on Thursdays! \\n\\nThe space at crush is varied. There are a lot of outdoor cafe tables, which is great for the triple digit heat we've had recently. Inside there are tables, loungers and sofas. In back? A small room with a smaller stage and dance floor. I've had some great times in this room. Oh man, the times I've had in this room...\\n\\nThey do brunch, and they do a lot of specialty programming.

Here's the breakdown:\\n\\nService:  Great!  The owners (Beck and his wife) are super nice!  Water or tea was offered as I sat and Beck gave his best advice on what to get for lunch (BiBimBop or the bento).  Admittedly I was the only one in the restaurant for a late 2pm lunch so I would have been pretty disappointed if there were any service flaws  :-)\\n\\nFood Quality/Quantity:  Being the only one in the shop, I thought it would be a quick 5min to get my chicken bugolgi bento box (like most of the other food carts and teriyaki chop shops that have the food just a step away from being put on your plate), so when it took over 10 minutes to get my food, I actually considered it a plus since they actually took their time to prepare most of the dishes fresh.\\n\\nWhen you order the lunch bento, be ready for a FULL multi-course meal!\\n1) chicken/beef/pork/galbi bugolgi - a very generous serving of good quality meat seared with a delicious marinade on a bed of onions\\n2) 2 pot stickers/gyoza - perfectly fried with the right outer-crisp shell and inner steamy goodness\\n3) vegetable tempura - only a couple pieces of fried zucchini but it was oh so delicate and tasty \\n4) salad - a nice lettuce mix and tangy dressing (not the iceburg crap you get at other places)\\n5) rice - a generous portion of perfectly cooked rice - tasted like it was fresh made, not sitting in a cooker for several hours\\n6) 3 small dishes consisting of:  cubed potatoes covered in sweet syrup, blanched broccoli in some light creamy sauce, and of course, kim chi (watch out because it's pretty spicy!)\\n7) and what real korean meal would be complete without sikhye (the gently sweet and lightly chilled rice soup dessert) - Beck said it aids with digestion; I was skeptical, but admittedly I somehow avoided the post-lunch food coma that usually accompanies stuffing myself to such a gluttonous degree; I'm not sure if the soup really caused it, but I'm definitely willing to go back and try it again\\n\\nValue:  For $7.95, it's a fantastic value.  Not quite as cheap as a $5-6 food cart burrito, but this is wayyyy healthier and higher quality, and about the same price as most teriyaki joints but with way more variety,  larger quantity, and better quality!!!\\n\\nAtmosphere: For being in a strip mall in the Fred Meyer parking lot, they've actually done a pretty nice job.  The wall is filled with little korean nick-knacks, art, and pics/posters of korean pop stars/actors/singers.\\n\\n\\nSo yeah, I'm actually really excited to go here again and try a different bento or their BiBimBop.  \\nIt's definitely worth going if you're looking for a good lunch and have a bit of time for a FULL meal :-)\\n\\n\\n***Review #9 in the Yelp 30 in 30 Challenge!***"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I think all the five stars for this place must be from tourists- because that's what this place is for- it's a grade-A tourist trap.

Chips were light and yummy (not the best in the city, but pretty good). \\n\\nThe entrees were AWESOME. The Steak and Pork Belly Fajitas were amazing - great flavors, large portion size, and we even had leftovers (which were equally good 2 days later). I am so coming back for these dishes. We also tried the Pollo Con Mole which folks have had mixed reviews on. The Mole is on the sweeter side so you have to be a fan of that to start. We thought it was very good since we are fan of that style and it was almost like a dessert treat versus a main meal. \\n\\nThe only dish I would not recommend is the Puffy Tacos with spiced beef (no real flavor on the beef) and overall not really worth even trying it. \\n\\nThis place is a lot of fun, great decor, and good service.

Come to the Grand Floridian and have some great food."},{"name":"Blue Dragon","address":"324 A St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Since we're essentially next door neighbors to Blue Dragon, I'd wish I could say that I absolutely love the place, but if I'm honest, much of our reasoning for returning is out of convenience. As a neighborhood spot or a eatery to to hit if you happen to be in the area, it's good, but definitely not a destination-level restaurant for me. Meaning, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at Blue Dragon.\\n\\nFirst, they have excellent cocktails. The \\"Thai basil smash\\" and \\"lemongrass gimlet\\" are excellent and always seem to be on the menu. They've had some tasty seasonal cocktails as well. We're always up for stopping in for a drink or two...if we can actually get a seat, as the bar fills up quickly.\\n\\nThe food? It's good. Asian fusion offerings in tapas portions, with a slightly inflated cost that's to be expected in the Fort Point area. Their noodle dishes are excellent and perhaps the best value. I'd get their scallop and bacon pad Thai for takeout any day. It's cheap, delicious, and unless I'm really hungry, I can get two meals out of it. The rest of the tapas are generally good, too. The fish and chips has an interesting sweet sauce that probably jumps over the too sweet line a bit, but it's still good in a small portion. Their dark & stormy baos are excellent, as are the wings, the fish tacos, and the lobster roll (more like two little lobster sliders...very heavy on mayo-based sauce). Nothing has really disappointed, but many items I've tried weren't craveworthy, either. If you're ambitious, you can always go for Blue Dragon's heaping portion of buttermilk fried chicken (a whole, portioned chicken for a small group or those with an openly-gluttonous side...like me). I'm also a big fan of their deep dish cookie dessert: a massive, moist, baked-to-order chocolate chip cookie, topped with a baseball-sized serving of ice cream and a soy caramel sauce. It's decadent and worth the carb coma, for sure.\\n\\nThe issues that I have come down to the vibe of some of the staff (specifically at the bar). Also be warned that it's always busy in the evenings, so you definitely want to get there early...or later...although, we've gone in at 9 and the kitchen's already been closed at random times. The food and drinks are good, but I don't rate Blue Dragon worthy of an extended wait (to be fair, there aren't many places that I do rate that highly). The bar staff are my biggest issue, though. We've been to Blue Dragon many times over a short time period. You'd think the same bartenders would actually remember our faces, but every time, it's like we're starting all over. It's the same exact staff asking for ID's, if we have food allergies, etc. We don't expect to be treated like Norm from Cheers when we walk in, but c'mon....we've felt more personalized, welcoming service from places we've never been to previously, let alone places we've frequented and tipped well at every time. It's one of those small things that could be the tipping point for regular customers vs. casual customers. It's really a shame, too, as there's some talent behind the restaurant in the kitchen and the cocktail menu that would bring us back more often, but if you sit at the bar, you could leave a bit disappointed by the stale personality behind that greets you. The same can't be said for the servers, though. The wait staff has always been really friendly and positive. \\n\\nOverall, Blue Dragon is good. Food is solid, but not necessarily remarkable on all fronts, and the service is decent, but not top-notch. The drinks are a highlight, but they're served up by people who seem to only see customers as a drink ticket, and not worthy of actual human interaction. Which leaves me somewhere in the middle. I'd never tell someone not to go, but I can't say that I'd push someone in Blue Dragon's direction, either...unless, of course, you want that cookie."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Awful service, great view but been here a handful of times and always bad food and rude service.

I don't think ours actually took that long, but the table across from us really did have to wait a long time and complained. The atmosphere was nice- we chose to sit inside but the patio looked especially pleasant. Now for the most important part, the food:\\n\\nHouse salad- small with a miso citrus dressing. Would not recommend. \\nSpring roll appetizer- this consisted of one skinny spring roll cut into four pieces. The inside was very processed looking. The dipping sauces were good though!\\nCalifornia roll- standardly delicious. Yum!\\nTrio tataki- the fatty tuna was excellent, white tuna was good, and Kobe was fine. The fish was very fresh and we would highly recommend this!\\nBeef yaki soba- I did not care for this at all and my husband had them remove it from the check. I think this was a personal preference though and was grateful that they removed it. My husband thought it was rather bland but ate his portion with some spicy mayo added. \\n\\nOverall, we noticed that most people got sushi, and the sushi was our favorite part of the meal.

While Moe's is consistently compared to Qdoba and Chipotle, I just feel the ingredients here are fresher and more plentiful...plus they have really banging queso (sorry Chipotle!). I personally usually gravitate towards the nachos where I split my meat between chicken and steak.

Service is extremely slow & bad.  \\n\\nReview:\\nWe (my girlfriend and I) decided to have dinner here last night.  I have eaten at the Uncle Billy's at this location.  I wanted to show my girlfriend the view.  We were seated, after about 6 minutes a server came for our drink order.  He also asked for appetizers.  We ordered the Queso.  After another 8 minutes or so he brought me my ice tea but he brought my GF water instead the lemonade she ordered.  At this time he also asked if it was Queso that we had ordered earlier.  This tells me that he didn't put our order in earlier.    It took about another 5 minutes for my GF to get her lemonade.  Another 5 minutes out came the queso & chips.  At this time we placed our order.  She ordered a tilapia dish and I got the burger and fries.  The queso was terrible.  It was more like cheez-whiz that you can find at any grocery store.\\n\\n25 minutes or so later came our entrees.  (during this entire 25 minutes the waiter never came to refill drinks)  The Tilapia dish was $18, it was terrible.  The entrees were delivered by a bus boy type of person as he wasn't our server.  Soon as he left I realized they didn't bring me any ketchup for my fries/burger.  I waited about 7 minutes before our server came.  He didn't even really come to check on us.  he showed up to take the drink order of the table next to us and I just waved to get his attention.  I asked him for ketchup and it took forever for him to come back (atleast 6 minutes).  All the while my food is getting cold.  When he finally did come back I started eating and boy was it the blandest food ever.  Service was so bad & slow that I gave a 7% tip.  That is something that I never do as I have grown up in the restaurant industry.  For me to leave such a bad tip it's because service was terrible.  I never base tip on food taste because that's not the server's fault.

Hapa gives a kick to this dish by marinating it in their special soy sauce and it made it nice and savoury!  Although we love edamame, we prefer the regular kind. \\n\\nSpicy Pork Ishi- yaki - $4.99 (5.5/7)\\nThis dish is presented in a very hot stone bowl and then mixed in front of you by the waitress, the dish will then slowly cook in the bowl until it becomes nice and crispy.  However, we didn't really like the rice as much as we thought we would so it was a bit disappointing.\\n\\nTropical Roll - $2.99 (4/7)\\nThis tasted like regular western sushi.  Nothing too special.\\n\\nDynamite Roll - $3.75 (3/6)\\nThis was minty and strange.  We thought it was the worst dish and regret ordering it. \\n\\nRenkon Gyoza Tempura - $3.99 (5/7)\\nOne of Hapa's most popular dishes.  We rate it overhyped.  It was made very well, but we guess it simply just did not suit our tastes?  After hearing all the raving reviews, we expected something amazing!  However, after the first bite, we were just like, \\"meh\\". \\n\\nNegitoro - $4.49 (6.5/7)\\nThis was amazing.  At the Robson location we would give this a 6.75.  However, it was still amazing here as well!  The tuna belly simply melts in your mouth, and it is truly ingenious that they decided to make this dish include garlic bread instead of sushi rice. \\n\\nBeef Tataki - $4.49 (6/7)\\nAgain, this is made a lot better at the main location on Robson.  However, it was still prepared extremely well and was delicious.\\n\\nAnyways, we really hope that we'll get to review Robson's Hapa Izakaya for you guys again!  Yaletown's Hapa is great but if you're really picky about your food, perhaps you should visit Robson's instead. \\n\\nRatings:\\n\\nFood: 5.5/7\\n\\nValue: 5/7\\n\\n\\"Hapa Hour\\" Happy hour Value: 6/7!!!\\n\\nService: 6/7"},{"name":"Boston Lobster Feast","address":"8731 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"While visiting my dad in Florida he brought me here for dinner.

I am from Revere and my wife is Desi from Lahore and we went into this place yesterday 2/8/12.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (CTM) and my wife just ordered the chicken tikka w/naan and raita.  After hearing about this place from my friend telling us how good it was and we were in the area we decided to stop in for lunch.  Anyway my chicken tikka massala came out fast but when I sank a fork into it the chicken was stringy very discolored and it fell apart on the tray and fork.  It didn't hold its shape.  This is A CLEAR sign that this chicken WAS NOT FRESH and had been from a batch cooked a couple days ago.  It may had been heated pot one day, stored in the fridge overnight and added to the next day's batch of CTM and maybe married again to another batch from the previous day.  The point is the meat was foul and not fresh.  I couldn't eat more than a couple bites it was so rotten.  My wife's chicken tikkas were taken from a stainless steel container in a cold salad bar style fridge and reheated in a microwave oven.  They were old, cut up, dried pieces of thigh meat that we asked if it was thigh or breast and we were told breast meat.  Again the same rotten meat taste it present, in the hardened over died surface of each piece.  This food was SO bad we just left everything on the table and realized we wasted $20 on DOG FOOD.  \\n\\nMy wife who is Desi from Lahore asked me how people can rave and eat from Punjabi Dhaba and my response is we (gorras) don't know anything better and they haven't all been to India or Pakistan to try authentic food.  These people haven't had real Desi style food and I have.  I STRONGLY URGE ANYONE TO STAY CLEAR OF PUNJABI DHABA because the food is not fresh and about a half hour later found myself vomiting in a toilet at Dunkin Donuts. (not lying)  \\n\\nIf you want to try something much better.  I recommend SS Market on 66 School Street in Somerville.  You will not take this place for a restaurant because it is not.  It's a convenience store with an attached Pakistani kitchen run by another Pakistani guy named Irfaan (that serves THE BEST Seikh Kabobs (ground chicken, spices like a sausage) baked in fresh in tandoori oven on skewers.  Their chicken tikkas come in boneless and with bone and are cooked fresh right in front of your eyes.  They make the freshest naan right there and also has a variety of real desi style curries.  The only reason we went to Punjabi Dhaba was because the SS was closed that day for family emergency.\\n\\nIf you want to clean your inner gastro intestinal system and want to flush it out eat at Panjabi Dhaba.

You got a little ginger flavor.  They were ok. Lots of little bones.  \\n\\nNext, came the chicken feet and the tripe!  Uuh.  I knew it.  I had chicken feet before in dark soy sauce.  This time there was nothing to cover up the flavor.   They taste like chicken. A little gelatinous, a little squeaky between the teeth, and lots of little toe bones.\\n\\nI had a couple chopsticks of tripe, which wasn't bad.  Sesame, ginger, and what I thought was garlic.  Better than the honeycomb tripe us Italians cook in tomato sauce.  Very mild.  Better than expected. \\n\\nWe had sticky rice with pork wrapped in some kind of leaf. It was good.   At this point, I was noticing the steam table, and got up to check it out. We all decided to go. My date offered to stay behind and watch the coats. She said if I ever came back to never, ever, leave anything at the table. It will be promptly stolen. How nice!  I got a couple more dishes. \\n\\nI had fried shrimp, crab balls and taro balls.  You've got to watch it when you see anything with \\"balls\\" in it at a Chinese restaurant!  These were formed in the shape of a ball. Yummy deep fried in a crispy batter.  The crab was wrapped in minced shrimp and little curly strips of taro.  That was good.  The taro ball had little pieces of pork in the middle and was also good.  \\n\\nWe had a plate of fried octopus.  We all thought that it was greasy and we left it on the table.  \\n\\nWe had a noodle wrapped fried crispy cruller for dessert that I also thought was ok.  They had that with a silky tofu they scoop out of a barrel.  Neither tasted of much at all.  Dessert was definitely a let down. \\n\\nWe all spent much of our time munching and slurping and spitting little bones in our plates.  P'tooey - clink.

It is average at best, not prime cuts, and not really impressive.  Sides can be ordered for the table just like many other steak restaurants.

We moved to Austin seven years ago after spending years in between San Francisco and LA so we have been treated to crazy fresh off the charts delicious sushi.  When we moved to Austin we had very low sushi expectations which is why the reviews of Sushi A-Go-Go put us in the zone of cautiously optimistic .  Our first trip was a success.  I had a Trio and a Vegetable Roll and they were fresh, light and delicious.  Our second trip was also a success.  We had the same two rolls and added a Texas Surf and Turf.  Again, each roll was a delight.  Last week, my husband was in the neighborhood so I asked him to pick up rolls for us.  Unfortunately, the sushi he brought home was exactly what I feared we would find in Austin.  The fish wasn't fresh and after I few bites I started having visions of an evening with food poisoning.  Since two out of three visits were wonderful, I will give the truck another try, but when it comes to sushi, two misses will cause this truck to be crossed off of our list.

The entire meal was killer! Oysters were fresh and tasty. The pulled pork was smoky, tender, and the slaw gave it the perfect crunch for texture. You pick from a variety of BBQ sauces we tried 2 hot and medium, both were tasty and impressive.

We made reservations for 5pm on a Saturday night for a party of four, since we knew this place gets busy.\\n\\nWe were seated exactly at 5pm. We asked what sort of gluten-free beer they had. Waitress stated they didn't carry any GF beer. Ok that's annoying but no problem. Everyone else ordered a drink. When she returned from the bar, she brought up an opened GF beer and simply stated, \\"Oh, we actually have GF beer. Here you go. Do you want it?\\" I was annoyed that she didn't check the bar before opening her mouth, but whatever. We can overlook that. My friend was happy that she could have a drink with us.\\n\\nWe asked if they could put the flatbread in the antipasto platter on the side so my GF friend could enjoy. No problem. It was delicious. \\n\\nHere was when it all unraveled.\\n\\nWe asked what entree items were GF. Waitress had no clue. We asked if the potato gnocchi was GF.  She was \\"pretty sure it wasn't.\\" We asked if there was a GF pasta she could sub in for a dish and what type/shape it was. She said, \\"Sure we have GF, but I don't know what sort of pasta it is. You're the first person I served today who needed GF. Maybe linguine, maybe ziti. There's only ever one option so if you want GF, you don't have a choice what type of pasta it is.\\" \\n\\nUm. Ok.

She should have gone back to the chef and ask but we'll overlook it, as my bf and I have enjoyed this place many times and wanted a nice bday dinner.\\n\\nWe get our entrees. My friend is enjoying her shrimp scampi with GF ziti until she sees that there are spaghetti strands in the bottom of her plate. If there is only ever one type of GF pasta at a time, then that spaghetti had to be regular gluten-filled pasta.\\n\\nWe let the waitress know. She said, \\"Oh. Ok. So if you're done with your meal, I can clear it, right?\\" No offer to fix it, no offer to comp the meal, no offer to do anything to fix the situation.

This was our first dinner on our honeymoon and I made the reservations the March before we came in June.\\n\\nI was incredibly excited to take my husband here (his family went to Disney World a lot - I went to Disney Land more) as he had never been. I gabbed on and on for months. Our reservation was at around 7pm, which was just perfect.\\n\\nWe started with the canadian beer cheese soup - which was delicious and well cooked. They give you three types of bread to start off with as well : a soft pretzel bread (delicious with the soup), a sourdough, and something else I can't quite remember. We shared the filet with mushroom risotto (we figured out the first night that those wedding diets shrunk our stomach so much that two separate entrees was a joke as we couldn't eat as much as we could a few months back) which was delicious in every way. It was cooked perfectly to our specifications and seasoned well. The mushroom risotto was amazing.\\n\\nWe finished the meal with the artisan cheese plate, and our waiter was really careful to not give us the walnuts and honeycomb that normally came with it as my husband is allergic. The cheeses were amazing and paired well with the pairings - it was delicious. And the cheeses were nice too - quality cheeses that we would pick out at home. Love, love, loved it!\\n\\nThe server was nice- but as I made reservations saying it was our first dinner as a married couple, nothing was acknowledged. Kind of disappointing.

You can find it tucked away in the loft of the North Market; the doors open right at 11am (I would suggest getting there a little early, especially on weekends!) and customers line up at the register to order. After placing your order, you can sit at any one of the communal tables and they will bring your order out to you after calling out your name. I really appreciate that although this place uses only disposable containers and cutlery, they do use all green/recycled products. \\n\\nTheir chicken can be ordered in varying levels of spiciness and you can either order a combo with sides (cole slaw and mac and cheese) or just the chicken. This chicken actually rivals the same fare I had in Nashville, where it originated, and the sides were absolutely delicious. The mac and cheese was the real deal, absolutely oozing with melty cheese. And of course, your chicken is served on top two pieces of white man bread, to soak up all the beautiful grease. This chicken itself has a nice crispy and spicy crust, I ordered the \\"warm\\" level of heat which was the perfect level of heat for me. \\n\\nMy only complaint about this place is that there are only two drink options from what I could tell- water and sweet tea. I know sweet tea is a Southern staple, but it was way, way, way too sweet for me. I ended up dumping it out and getting water.

Turns out that this was the better of decisions that I've made within the Cambridgeside Galleria food court as it was either this or mediocre fast food chains like Burger King or Taco Bell.\\n\\nChicken Now is basically very much like a Chik-Fil-A but without any of the homophobic principles and the hundreds of locations. Instead is a much smaller chain, which has under 50 locations throughout the US, randomly spread out and which focuses on one thing: chicken.\\n\\nTheir menu is simple and has four core offerings: sandwiches, salads, wraps and wings & tenders. Within each category is a small selection of various dishes, from sandwiches with and/or without cheese, or on toasted Texas bread instead of a bun. The wraps are also slightly different as are their salads and wings. \\n\\nThey also have nachos, quesadillas and savory sides which include corn, beans, coleslaw, mashed potatoes and even green beans which does help them stand out a bit and the quality of each side is much superior to anything you could get at gigantic fast food chains.\\n\\nBut what the real shtik here is folks, is the chicken. I had a wrap and they were generous with the chicken in it. Each morsel was seasoned beautifully, packed with flavor and was both juicy and tender. And no bone in sight - it's all boneless for obvious reasons. Honestly, the food surprised us and exceeded our expectations.\\n\\nThe service wasn't all that great, the person not being all that friendly but then again they work at the Cambridgeside Galleria, a forsaken place which could be the cause of their lack of spark and delightfulness. No big deal.\\n\\nAll in all I actually think that this could very well be the best food stall at the Cambridge Galleria's food court - it's way better than anything you could get at the other ones and the chicken is pretty damn good. That being said, it's still fast food and it's still not all that healthy - however it is affordable and clean."},{"name":"3 Country Bistro","address":"379 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"Perfect sushi, perfect Thai cuisine!

The star, however, was the chocolate topping. Not sure if intentional, but it tastes exactly like brownie batter--seriously uncanny. The only reason this donut was not #1 in the city was that it was slightly confusing to have a Boston Cream donut taste like a brownie, since the chocolate overpowers the rest of the donut. However, it was an incredibly pleasant confusion. I would recommend! EDIT: came back in 2018 and the chocolate tastes more like standard chocolate these days, the filling is eggier, and the dough is still soft but not crispy. Still very solid! \\n\\nChocolate Cake\\nGlazed chocolate cake donut. Thick layer of glaze that adds a nice texture. It's a little bit crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Not dry! One of the better chocolate cake donuts in the city."},{"name":"Crush","address":"1400 SE Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Came here for drinks on a Tuesday and while it was very quiet, it would defiantly visit again.

The bread is baked daily and is flaky. The sandwich isn't always warm if you do take-out, but that doesn't deter from the taste. The meat is tender (not always lean, but I clearly don't care), tastes like it's marinated overnight, well seasoned in a mysterious dark sauce (probably a mixture of hoisin and other things) and plentiful. The daikon/carrot mixture is always crunchy. The couple that owns this place is adorable. On my first visit here, the male owner/manager/person told us that we need to come here more often and eat more Vietnamese food. Apparently his wife lost weight eating Vietnamese food daily? Not sure what this was supposed to mean. The dorky young teenager guy with glasses is adorable and pretty much caters to your every need. \\n\\nOther dishes I've tried here are the beef pho, all croissants, and \\"crepe thing with shrimp\\" (we just pointed at another table that was eating it and demanded it ASAP without shrimp, but it came with shrimp anyway). The crepe thing came with nuoc mam, lettuce leaves to wrap it up with, and was delicious! Crispy and a bit greasy, but very flavorful. The shrimp was a bit shrimpy. The beef pho is a bit fatty at times and the broth is hit or miss, so I would recommend against pho here. They do have a great half b√°nh m√¨, half pho lunch special (eat-in only), which I recommend on days where you want a comforting lunch.  The croissants are DELICIOUS (flaky crust, fresh fruit or nut filling; the chocolate one is decadent and almost chocolate overload-y, but hits the right spot when consumed at the right time) and VERY CHEAP ($1). Kicks several bakeries' asses. \\n\\nWord to the wise: If you are doing take-out, ask the person taking your order to cut your sandwich in half for you, as this is not normal practice in take-out orders.  Bring cash. $10 credit card minimum.

To sum my experience up, it's a great concept that tries too hard to be the concept.  Does that make sense?  If not, let me explain.\\n\\nWhen you walk into Lamberts you feel like you've stepped into a mix of early 20th century Texas and Dwell Magazine.  I'm ok with that part.  Drink service was slow, but good.  Food came out fast and was very nice.  I had their wedge salad.  It was a nice country style take on the wedge, generously loaded.  For my meat, I was in Texas, so I had to get some brisket.   The brisket, was tender, moist, an explosion of juices in my mouth.  Then there were the sauces, a trio of them to choose from and each was a detriment to the dish.  Room temperature sauces with the hot, smokey brisket?  It made no sense to me.  They come in these neat little glass bottles that go with the concept of the restuarant, but the sauces are not on par with the quality of the meat.  The house sauce was just ok, but Salt Lick house sauce from a bottle would have been better than the house sauce.  I gave the mustard sauce a try, strike two.  Guess I'm not a Carolina BBQ guy, oh, wait, I was in Texas!  The third sauce was the habanero sauce and it was the best of the three, but not doable in large doses, so strike three.  You can't wreck good BBQ with a sauce that's not on par with the meat and that's what happened here.  I had the mac & cheese side, seemed unoriginal.  If you're going to do the gourmet Mac & cheese side then you should do something gourmet with it.\\n\\nAgain, there was nothing bad about the food, there were just some simple things that I think would have taken it up another level. I'd eat at Lamberts again, but with lower expectations and plan to do my high level BBQ grubbing at Ironworks or the Salt Lick."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Jason our server is an absolute gem.

There were 3 empty booths, but the guy was hesitant about letting us sit in a booth and said \\"two of them are still dirty so we need to clean it but you can wait if you want, and the last one is reserved for our employees to eat lunch\\". That surprised me quite a bit. Normally restaurants just clean up the seat and I've never heard of a table in the restaurant being reserved for employee's lunch especially when there's plenty of there are plenty of other tables available. \\n\\nAfter we sat down we ordered the food, and we waited for the side dishes.

We tried signaling to get their attention, but the manager was too busy yelling or \\"training\\" a new employee to notice, and the other server was standing next to them listening in.

My mom ordered the Kalbi ($17) and I ordered a spicy kimchi pork dish ($15). I enjoyed both quite a bit and happily ate as much as I could, but the portions were huge though, so I only ended up eating half of the dish. I was happy until about 1 hour later my stomach started to feel funny, then 2 hours later my stomach was really hurting for about an hour.  It was not fun.

We were a larger group on a slow Sunday afternoon. The staffing seemed a bit low at the time. I have been to restaurants like this before so I was very excited about trying the seafood boil. You can pick the seafood and pick which sauce you want it to be prepared with. We ordered buckets of snow crab legs in the garlic butter sauce, shrimp in the traditional Louisiana sauce, and clams in garlic butter, crawfish in traditional Louisiana, some sweet potato fries, grilled corn, and a salmon entree. The crab was delicious and the garlic butter sauce was really tasty. I thought the shrimp was slightly overcooked but the sauce was absolutely delicious. If I could bottle it up I would. The crawfish came free because we ordered more than three buckets of seafood boil. They were good but the amount of energy it takes to get the meat out of the shell was just not worth it to me. I wouldn't have ordered them if they weren't free. Overall, I thought the place had a good vibe, it was an okay attempt at the boiled seafood bucket scene. I thought for the price of the seafood buckets there should have been some sides included with them (this is what I've experienced at similar restaurants). We had to keep ordering more sides cause the seafood alone just doesn't fill you up. I thought the sweet potato fries were delicious but small compared to the regular fries. I was underwhelmed by the service. Our server seemed like he had too much on his plate that day.

The Mini Chimis were seriously good and came with 3 sauces, Chipotle, Verde and Garlic Sour Cream. Chipotle had a decent kick, and was more chunky and a scoop of that in the Queso was the perfect add in. Verde was Verde, but the Garlic Sour Cream was good. The pork in the Chimis had a great flavor and was super tender, and the outer shell was more like a fried bread, thick with a light crunch on the outside. Wife went the Beef Chiladas, double rice. Rice was good, but dry. Beef had a OK Flavor. As for me...Brisket Enchiladas on Deck. This was a first time in this direction.

There's something so undeniably cool about this place. First off, it's nestled deep in the throes of Fort Point, on the very back end of A. So it's this kind of gentrified, dingy industrial area which is something out of an active rock music video from 2003. The interior is very chic gastropub, which feels warm and welcoming but also sophisticated. \\n\\nFor lunch, the salmon salad is generous and tasty, and the burger is a must. I like the mortadella banh mi, but it's definitely for the mortadella fan, or the kid who grew up with ham sandwiches as a kid. If you're there for dinner, you can really choose your own adventure - if you go the dim-sum, share everything route, you have got to try the braised short rib and celery potstickers. When my mom visits, we hit up blue dragon and just get those dumplings. Beef dumplings are my soul food, and Blue Dragon does them really well - not too heavy. I love love love the escargot. Unf, anything drenched in butter is where I'm at. Also, mussels/snails/clams taste awesome with thai spices, in my opinion, so the Thai compound butter is a good choice. My best theory is that the heat and the citrus breaks down some of the toughness in the mussels, so there's not much bounce-back. But who knows; they're still delicious. When I'm having a bad day, I love to get the Indonesian curried lamb shepard's pie. It's the perfect food to eat on a rainy day in the middle of January - it just tastes like sitting in front of a fire. I'm pretty sure the flavors used in the filling are based off Beef Rendang, which takes me right back to Bali. Earthy, deep spices are reminiscent of an African stew and certain Indian Curry, and the mashed potato topping lightens it back up before the dish becomes too rich. The noodles are tasty - I like the garlic-sake clam noodles SO MUCH. The dan dan noodles are okay, not anywhere near the dan dans over at Myers + Chang.

This place topped all expectations!  \\n\\nThe quaint house is a perfect backdrop for the menu.  The menu is a bit limited with typically five entrees yet the mix of tapas and salads offer enough variety to please any customer.  When I asked if they could switch up the side dishes amongst the fish entrees, the hostess over heard the question and said something like, \\"you can have anything you want that we have in the building.\\"   That set the tone for the quality service and truly exceptional food.  \\n\\nThe menu changes constantly taking advantage of what is available locally.  We each started with salads, all of which had really interesting ingredients topped with a delicious vinaigrette.  Our party had steak, lamb and fish entrees.  While all loved all of the entrees, we voted my sea bass as best.  We shared an ice cream dessert that was only mediocre and left promising to come back.\\n\\nThis restaurant was as good as any I have had in larger Florida cities like Orlando and Tampa.

I went for the first time on Friday and all the food was delicious.  I've been to Blue Ginger so I knew Ming Tsai's restaurants are high quality.  This restaurant is a different concept - basically Asian fusion tapas.  We got about 5 small plates, and yes...they are very small.  We are talking like 4 bites per tapas.  You might expect more food for the costs (plates seemed to average about $12), but what they lack in portion size, they make up for in flavor and artistry.  Your taste buds will love every moment of it.  The drinks are small as well, so I recommend the dragon bowl.  It gives you the most bang for your buck.  I really loved the scallops (even though they were tiny bay scallops) and the duck confit rillettes, but everything we had was yummy.  And to finish it off the deep dish chocolate chip cookie was to die for.  Talk about indulgence.  Diet goes out the window, but it's so warm and melty in your mouth you won't care.  There were also a number of items on the menu that we didn't order that I'm excited to go back and try.  I love the ambiance, and the restaurant makes really good use of the space.  Only thing that was a little strange that night was our waiter.  He made rather weird eye contact with my sister and I.  He also hovered when it was clear we needed more time and weren't ready to order, and then when we actually needed him for something (like more drinks), he would race by without making eye contact.  My sister even said that he grabbed her ass as he walked by the table.  I can't confirm for sure, but I did see him bump into her.  Aside from this, it was still a great dining experience, and I'll go back again.  Might just avoid that particular creepy waiter."},{"name":"Northstar Caf√©","address":"4015 Townsfair Way","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The veggie burger here is phenomenal and I'm not usually a veggie burger type of guy.

I live between New York and Boston for work, so I'm pretty used to Manhattan/ Brooklyn pricing. But it's not about how much the sticker price is, I don't mind paying more for good food. I don't think the quality and quantity of food from Little Donkey is worth the pricing that they proposed. \\nWe ordered the fried chicken sandwich, Parker house rolls, burger, a dozen oysters, 4 fish tacos, and 4 drinks. In terms of flavor, none of the dishes really wow me or my friends in any way. The rolls were just fresh plain dinner rolls with less than a quarter bite of meat. The fish tacos were dry and flavorless. The oysters were fresh but not as good as oysters from the North End (and more expensive too). The burger was nothing special in terms of both look and flavor. And the fried chicken sandwich was the only thing that stands out, but it was tiny, with no fries or anything else on the side.\\n\\nIn terms of pricing, they are more expensive comparing with restaurants in Manhattan or Brooklyn (I'm assuming that's the style of restaurant the owner(s) are going for). We were going to keep ordering more as we go, but we stopped ourselves because we were not happy with the food (both quality and quantity). Our bill came out to be $50 per person not including tip, and none of us were satisfied at all. I'd usually spend about $60-$90 per person at Beauty and Essex or Stanton Social in NY, and feeling completely satisfied and happy. So once again, it's not about the sticker price, but rather the price here just isn't worth it.

Heading to the back we found a very large table in a separate  room that also held the bar.  The seating for the table was a large extremely comfy sofa and a few chairs.  We opted for the sofa and received our menus in due course.   \\nThe wait staff was busy, but friendly and helpful in assisting us in making our selections.  I have never been to London, but I have had a number of experiences with authentic English pubs and I was pleasantly surprised by the number of authentic dishes they offered.  Scotch eggs, mushy peas, bangers and mash, baked beans and a selection of English soft drinks.\\nWe settled on the traditional regular sized Cod and English chips, we ordered a Scotch egg as an appetizer, and for me it was a New Castle Brown Ale while Miz Mona settled on her fall back, a Guinness.  The lost star for our visit was due to there being no nitro for the Guinness, but they replaced it with a New Castle at a lower price, so it was a push as far as I was concerned.  \\nOur food arrived promptly and was, in a word, delightful.  The fish was crispy and flaky,  the chips tender and hot.  The Scotch egg was done right and served with a traditional brown sauce.  As with most meals, atmosphere can make or break it, and our dining experience was greatly enhanced by the opportunity to chat with the owner Mick while we ate.\\nI had asked the waitress about the Tardis Room, and she pointed us out to him and told him we had expressed an interest.  Mick joined us and we had a lovely chat.  He explained that he had been a fan of the show since he was a boy in London, admitting that he had even had a Tom Baker style scarf and had joined in the competition among his mates to see who could get the longest one.  He described it as a work in progress, the restroom door is done in a pretty exacting reproduction of the famed blue police box and he has some friends who are building him a 1:1 scale reproduction of a Dalek.  As Mick put it, The Tardis here won't take you through time, but it will take you to the loo.\\nAfter three years, I would best describe The Fish and Chip Shop as work in progress.  They have a solid core of great food and great service.  As the location continues to develop, I can see great things happening, such as screenings of the show, trivia nights and live music and sporting events.\\nThe place is not for everyone, if you are expecting fine linens and fancy food, move on.  If however, if you are looking for a warm friendly place to have a pint with your mates, a bit of food and perhaps indulge your geeky side just a bit in a neighborhood joint that aspires to nothing more then a comfortable place to visit, by all means, drop on by."},{"name":"Topgolf","address":"9295 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"First timer over here and would totally come back again.

Ok, sure. But about 3/4 through the meal we noticed that the other fans in the area were on low setting while ours was still on high.

The space is clean and bright. It isn't too far from their other location, but sometimes a few blocks make a difference. You can order from a menu of salads or create your own. Either way, it's made fresh as soon as you order. First choose your greens, next choose your toppings (6), then choose your dressing. I'm a big fan of the charred lemon dressing. Unfortunately proteins are extra, so I usually end up with a $12 salad. It would be $9 without the chicken, but I haven't been able to convince myself to make that sacrifice. In my opinion the chicken should be included in the price. I tend to use the theory - if it costs the same or less in Manhattan, there's an issue. This is Portland. But Manhattan has a plethora of delicious salad bars, so they have to keep their prices lower to compete. Lucky for Garden Bar, they currently have a monopoly here in PDX. Another method of frustration is the fact that you could go to a food cart and get twice the amount of food for half the price, but I find the financial sacrifice justifiable for a fresh and healthy meal. I will often return, but with a slight bitterness about the cost. Oh, they do have a loyalty program, so eventually you get a deal if you're a member.

Luckily it turned out okay. It is not a bad pizza place. Either that, or my standards are dropping. \\n\\nI ordered 3 different slices. I thought they were going to reheat pre-made slices. Instead, it looked like they were freshly made. I think they got their dough, cut it in half, dressed it, and popped it in the oven. If they didn't, oh well. They sure fooled me. \\n\\nI ordered the cheese, PMS, and the Can't Beat the Meat slices. I overestimated myself and couldn't finish all 3. I think 2.5 slices would be the ideal amount if you want to get full. It also probably depends on which slices you order. The 2 meat filled slices probably brought the density level higher. \\n\\nThe crust seemed decent. It had a nice, thin crust. The end crust had a nice crunch to it. The crust had a decent browning to it too. The crust didn't taste too bad. But I'm too used to the delicious crusts of Fuoco, Antico, Varasano's, and even the Corner Pizza.  \\n\\nThe cheese slice had a ton of cheese on it. I think it had way too much cheese so I couldn't taste the sauce. Also, the cheese tasted stale. They need to use fresh cheese and not too much of it.\\n\\nI think I remember reading a review saying the ingredients were still raw. The mushrooms on PMS did look raw. When I took a bite of it, however, it was cooked, fortunately. The PMS wasn't a bad slice. \\n\\nThe Can't Beat the Meat slice was quite heavy. It lived up to its name. It had a ton of meat. I can see why people would say this pizza is greasy. Well, with this much meat, it would be greasy. I don't mind the grease.

We sucked it up and drank our beer in less than clean pint glasses and finished our snack. After we were finished, we waited for some time and then just went to the front to ask for our bill. We told the manager inside the restaurant that we were not happy with our service and did not really get a response from him. Our check was dropped a few minutes later and we reluctantly left a small tip for the poor service and left. \\n\\nThe only reason I am giving my experience two stars instead of one is that the patio atmosphere and location were perfect.

I went to the Gourmet Oriental for karaoke. We'd already eaten dinner but we planned to have some drinks and sing and have fun for a few hours. When I got there, some of the party was already there and some had already ordered drinks. A waitress came over almost immediately and asked my boyfriend and me if we wanted to order. We hadn't had a chance to even take off our coats, let alone look at a drink menu, so my boyfriend said, \\"Nothing yet,\\" and I said, \\"Just some water, please.\\" The waitress nodded and walked away. A few minutes later, another waitress came over and asked if we wanted anything. I said, \\"I already ordered water, thanks.\\" The woman nodded and said, \\"Bottle of water, yes,\\" and started to write something on her order pad. \\"Oh, no, that's okay, I just wanted some water from the tap,\\" I said. Big mistake, apparently. \\n\\nThis waitress YELLED at me. She didn't say, \\"We don't give free tap water, sorry.\\" If she had, that would have been absolutely fine. Instead she yelled at me, telling me they need to make money and everyone comes to just watch karaoke and doesn't order anything and they're a business and they won't just give me free water, if I want to sing, I need to buy bottled water, they're not just going to give me anything for free. I was almost crying; she was that mean. And she just kept yelling. I tried to say, \\"That's fine, sorry, never mind!\\" more than a few times to stop her and just end it, but she wouldn't stop, for a full five minutes. Finally she stopped and I said, \\"Okay, never mind, I don't want anything!\\" and she walked away. I was so shocked. I wanted to leave, but I didn't want to be a buzz kill, so I just started looking through the song book. The original waitress came over and asked if anyone wanted any drinks and said, \\"Water, right?\\" to me and I said, \\"No, I don't want it anymore.\\" She didn't acknowledge what I said and just walked away. A minute later, she returned with a bottle of water and a glass with ice. I said, \\"Um, I said never mind, I don't want this anymore.\\" She went off on me, too, saying, \\"You ordered it! I already wrote it down!\\" and I said, \\"Okay, fine, I'll take it,\\" just so she'd stop. But she kept going. \\"I wrote it down! You ordered it!\\" she kept saying. I finally said, \\"OKAY, THANKS!\\" and she walked away. Then a few minutes later she came back and asked if anyone else wanted something. We were all like, \\"No, we're cool, thanks!\\" just to get her to leave but she said to my friend J, \\"You need to order something. My boss says we lose money because people just come in and listen to karaoke and sit at the bar and they don't order anything. You need to order something.\\" At this point, I pointed to the beer sitting directly in front of J and asked, \\"Does he need to be drinking two beers at once? Do you not see the beer he's already drinking?\\" She kind of blinked at me and then said, \\"That's yours?\\" to J, like she couldn't believe it. \\"Yeah... you brought it to me?\\" he said. \\"Oh,\\" she said. Then she looked at my boyfriend and my friend E, neither of whom had ordered drinks, and started lecturing them. \\"My boss says you need to order something! You can't just sit there!\\" So my boyfriend ordered a cheap beer and E ordered a soda and she finally left. The only other trouble came up later in the night when she asked us if we wanted the check and we told her to ask the other people at our table and she kept saying that their drinks were on the same tab, and when my boyfriend asked if he could get a separate check and she yelled at him for asking and then kept explaining over and over again that it was all on one bill even though he agreed right away that one bill was fine. But that was minor stuff compared to yelling at me for ordering some tap water. \\n\\nI can understand having a 1 drink minimum at a bar, but it wasn't posted anywhere that they had said minimum. If they had posted it, fine. But they didn't post a minimum and even if they HAD, there was still no reason to yell at me for trying to get some tap water! \\n\\nThe stupid thing is that I only ordered some tap water because I hadn't looked at the drink menu yet. I was planning on ordering many, many alcoholic drinks that night if the waitress hadn't yelled at me. They could have gotten probably at least $50 from me on drinks and the waitress would have gotten a tip as well. Instead she got $1.25, tax, and not a cent of tip."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"First thing I ate when I landed in Portland!

Let me begin by saying it really takes a lot of things to go horribly wrong to deserve a 1 star rating. However...my family and I went there for dinner and it...was...BRUTAL   :(    If I could use a Mr. Yuk face here I would. Now to be as positive as I can about this visit, the calamari was fine, nothing special but edible. \\nSo why the low rating you ask, to begin with we thought ordering grilled shrimp and salmon would be a pretty easy item to prepare as it is something that we have done on our grill as amateurs many times.  Apparently the grill professionals should visit our home for a tutorial because all of the fish was dry and tough which I assume is due to weighing it down with a metal iron and then covering it which would be fine if it were for a few minutes but it lasted twice as long as it should have. We watched them make this and received exactly what we expected, Fish and Shrimp jerky. That is not an exaggeration either, there were parts of the salmon that had to be ripped off since a knife couldn't cut through it. The rice wasn't all that flavorful and also had lost much of its moisture and was brittle and hard. The black bean and corn salsa was the best thing we ate and that was just meh. \\nWe had ordered a grilled chicken breast to go so when we arrived home we unfortunately discovered that the chicken too was way overcooked had no juiciness or flavor. I am truly stunned that Fishook has a 3 rating. I have lived in and visited Atlanta for nearly 20 years and I can honestly say that this was one of the worst dining experiences that I have ever had and not just in Atlanta.

I write a nice, four-star review for Yanagi FRIDAY. Fri-mf'ing-day. For those of you reading this in the future, that was two days ago. And with warm, fuzzy thoughts of Yanagi in my head, Wifey and I were feeling like some sushi last night...on our anniversary no less. But since we've got plans to celebrate next weekend, we just picked up some sake to chill earlier, got the kids into bed, and were looking forward to some fresh, tasty take-out sushi & sake, and then following it up with a movie (and whatnot. ahem). I hate the fact that I'm writing this update, because every other experience at Yanagi has been really good, but I feel like I have no choice. \\n\\nEverything started off okay, although I will say that the nigiri sushi was noticeably less fresh than we've had from Yanagi in the past. Less fresh + sushi = not good. The Red Dragon and Rainbow rolls were pretty good, but the shit...or I suppose I should say vomit, hit the fan when we dug into the Mopac roll. I have to take some responsibility here, because that was my choice...but in my defense, it looked good on paper (\\"spicy yellowtail and ooba, topped with white tuna, jalapenos, masago, and house mustard sauce\\"). You see, there was a substantial piece of some type of bone in that spicy yellowtail (substantial = close to .5 inch) , and Wifey was the lucky one to pick that particular piece of the roll. I have never had any type of bone in any type of sushi, and hope to hell that it never happens. But it happened to poor Wifey, and she had a nice little conversation with the sink/garbage disposal for a while.\\n\\nNeedless to say, it put a bit of a damper on the anniversary evening. I did call Yanagi and spoke with the manager, and perhaps he would have comp'd something if I had asked, I don't know. I just wanted to let them know, so it hopefully wouldn't happen to anyone else. Any offers for future discounts or freebies would have been pointless, as we unfortunately wont be going back. And this, two days after I wrote that I hope they stick around.

Served with crisp endive scoops to convey the tartare, one could also pick up some capers and a little chile oil on the plate.  It was bright, cool, and delicious.  On to the osso buco which was amazing.  It was easily the best osso buco I've ever had, and was an enormous portion.  Although slated to serve two, it easily could have fed three.

I'm surprised I hadn't been there until now.  It's location isn't exactly the easiest to get to/park at being at 2nd and Guadalupe, but the City Hall parking lot does in a pinch.\\nThe menu was a bit thin on choices, and the BBQ seemed to be a bit of an afterthought on the menu.  I got the three meat plate because I wanted to try the brisket, pork ribs, and sausage.  Mac and cheese and collards were my side choices.\\nThe breakdown:\\nThe pork ribs obviously had some sort of orangy/citrus twang.  Not sure what I thought about that.  I wasn't impressed.\\nThe jalapeno sausage though was better than most BBQ joint sausage.  It was not spicy, at least to me, but the texture was good and it wasn't greasy.  The mustard sauce on the table was uninspiring though.\\nThe brisket was definitely the highlight.  We all agreed that was world class.\\nWhat else was world class was the mac and cheese.  That was crazy good, and I could have eaten a tub of it.\\nThe collard greens were pedestrian.  Not bad, not awesome.  Go to Ruby's for awesome.\\nThe tea was very good.  The BBQ sauce was average.  The hot sauce on the table was not worth using and ruined the BBQ sauce.  What will keep me from running back was how expensive it was.  I could have had the same amount of food, if not more, at Ruby's, Rudy's, Vic's, or a litany of places in town for half price.

The Living Room seems like a cool idea - a nicely decorated establishment with couches everywhere! It seemed lounge-y and moderately upscale from the photos online. The ambiance doesn't disappoint - the lighting was right and the lounge areas are available, with plenty of room at the bar as well. \\n\\nTaking a look at the menu is a little disappointing - paninis, burgers, all the expected entrees (Chicken broccoli alfredo? Wait...is this the Olive Garden?) I ordered the shrimp and scallop pasta - nothing special, the scallops were not fresh and not prepared very well, but it wasn't terrible. For $21 I expected better. Their drink menu is large, with choices that range from classics like Manhattans and gin martinis to Mike's Hard Limeade. Girly, sweet martinis take up a lot of the menu. They weren't bad, but at $12-$14 a pop, I'd had much higher expectations. I had the watermelon martini, and I enjoyed it but it wasn't worth the price. It was all very overpriced for what it was. Olive Garden quality at double the price.\\n\\nAs for the service, it was a little odd. I don't know if the waitress was new, but she seemed like she was. She was nice enough, but not as present as I would've liked. We were in a group of 12 and 4 of our party were a little late for the 7:30 reservation. We'd expected someone to come greet us and offer to get us some drinks while we waited for the rest of the party, but no one did. I had to get up and ask the hostess (who was hard to find) to send someone over to our table. Once the whole party arrived, we ordered apps (pulled pork mini sandwiches were totally underwhelming, but others ordered spinach and artichoke dip and seemed to love that.) and we'd finished them but no one cleared away our plates. So, dinner came and the table was totally crowded with plates that should've been bused away. When we finished dinner, no one cleared away those plates either! So we were stuck chatting and sipping the last of our drinks over a table of dirty, half-eaten entrees and appetizers. Weird.\\n\\nOverall, it wasn't a BAD experience, but I won't be going back.

They have a nice little deck but apparently there is a church bell concert every Sunday in the summer at the church across the street and it sounded like my night terrors so we opted for the indoor seating instead. Its much classier than im used to but then again, so is the Picadilly Pub.\\n\\nAt first we were just going to get appetizers figuring the entrees would be too pricey. The entrees ranged from $16 to $30 but they had a nice little bar menu with more reasonable fare. We sat at the bar because the tables had some weird white clothes covering them and this confused and scared me. The bar was small but nice and they have guiness and harpoon on tap. The food did take a little while to arrive but it was well worth it. We ordered a $4 and an $8 appetizer and both were generous portions, especially for a bistro. We ordered a $9 pizza and it was damn good and big! It was so big that we couldn't even finish it but I made my girlfriend finish it with a series of threats since she's the one who was whining about being so hungry in the first place. The waitstaff was friendly enough too. I'd go back......if they'd let me."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We ordered the espresso canoli, napoleon and almond macaroon.\\n\\nEspresso Cannoli- I am not a cream fan but i love anything espresso. this was okay, too sweet alil for me but its good.

It smelled a lot like my grandmothers house.  Not a good first smell impression when walking into a restaurant.    It was a Friday night at 7 and the place was pretty dead and we still got sat in a bad seat right up against the salad bar when there were clearly plenty of better seats available.  The waitress was clearly new; most likely a college student, mediocre personality, spilled a quarter of the glass of Sangria all over our table before she put it down, but did have a decent knowledge of the menu and what each dish consisted of.  The decor and lighting looked a bit dated but it all felt appropriate for an Italian Restaurant.  The menu offered a decent variety of items but lacked several antipasti staples and  a standard red sauce pasta dish with meat side(no option for just pasta and sausage,meatballs,chicken parm,bolognese,etc).  This could however be due to its focus on strictly Tuscan cuisine, but I don't know enough about the region to determine that.  The prices were a little up there and on par with fancy Italian restaurants down the street (Il Capricio, La Campagnia), as well as some staples in the North End.  The food was outstanding.  We ordered the Tuscan Brick Statler Chicken and the Split Roasted Center-Cut Pork Loin and both were phenominal.  Portion sizes were absolutely perfect for both a Man and  Womens appetite.  The meat was cooked PERFECTLY on both the chicken and the pork and that is not an easy feat.  My mashed potatoe sides were creamy with just the perfect amount of seasoning and salt.  The risotto that came with the chicken was a bit bland and could have used a bit more flavor, but cooked good overall.  In conclusion, the food warranted the price , but the dining \\"experience\\" was very mediocre.  Kudos to the Chef as I would definitely go back for the food, but not for the ambiance."},{"name":"Topgolf","address":"9295 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is because  half the place is open air and smoking is not allowed at all.

Also, one of the most prestigious and largest cigar shops in the country, is right down the road. So you would think that a couple guys hitting balls and smoking stogies wouldn't be a big deal, it is to these guys. They say it's because of kids, but this place is not very kid friendly.

Neither of us had ever been there before...admittedly, when he said we were going to a restaurant with the word \\"shack\\" in the name, and when I saw its odd strip mall location, I was a tad concerned. I needn't have worried. \\n\\nWe ordered two pounds of crawfish apiece; boyfriend got them regular, I got them extra spicy...since he kept stealing mine, I would recommend the spicy. I didn't even realize until after I had cleared my entire platter that my mouth was on fire. WORTH IT. \\n\\nI can definitely see how the flavor is more Asian spicy than Cajun spicy, but it's very very tasty either way. The sauce was buttery and delicious, and I ended up eating half the basket of bread just because I still have enough manners not to just eat the sauce off a spoon. Barely enough manners. But enough nonetheless. \\n\\nDefinitely disappointed to hear that they use MSG in the boil, though. They lose a star for that and the fact that their bread basket consists of slices of garlic bread...we're next door to Louisiana, you can't find some crusty french bread? Really? Also, the service was just okay. Friendly enough, but the waitress definitely seemed hurried and kept forgetting things. If it weren't for those three things, this place would have garnered a four or five-star rating easily. And really, the MSG probably weighs more heavily on my rating than the other two things. \\n\\nCan definitely see how it would be easy to rack up a very large bill here, we spent $45.00 for just our crawfish and a few beers before tip. \\n\\nIf they gave me some crusty french bread for dipping and carried a few more varieties of Abita (all they have is the amber), I could see adding another star. Still want to go back and try a few of the entrees and po-boys, so maybe I'll be updating this in the not-too-distant future."},{"name":"Round Table Clubhouse","address":"5016 NE Thurston Way","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"My coworker and I made an online order for pick up.

I got the sushi/sashimi boat for 2 tonight and the sashimi was fine, but the nigiri was TERRIBLE.  And I must cap that since I can't bold.  They were plasticy, indicating they weren't fresh cuts, and they had a funny color.  And this wasn't a personal experience, but my friend was convinced that the octopus tasted not completely thawed.

YES they have a dispenser.  You must try the gelati and sorbetti at Vivoli il Gelato it is the 2nd location opened up aside from their original location in Italy. It was so soft and creamy.  The BoatHouse is great for a fancy sit down dinner as Fulton's was old and played out.

We asked the waitress how it's different from Korean BBQ and she's like, I've never had it so I don't know. Riiiiight, and you serve bibimbop here? . . . anyways, per her suggestions, we got the green onion salted kalbi, the marinated kalbi, and the spiced pork belly. We also got the raw beef bibimbop.\\n\\nI think the main difference between Japanese and Korean BBQ that I can gather is that Japanese uses more salting techniques while Koreans uses more marinades. The salted beef and spiced pork belly were both very tasty while the marinated kalbi was similar to traditional Korean style. There's also no kimchi type dishes as this is a Japanese BBQ. The portions were very small - each grill meat plate was ~$10-15 and consists of 6-8 small pieces of meat (big bite sized). The bibimbop was okay, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\nThey also have a dinner special - $35/person for a variety of grill meats (7-8 dishes) or if you have 4+ people, it's $25/person. We just didn't want to spend that much and so we just picked and choose our meats. Our total came to be about $45 and we weren't even full yet! We actually went to get sushi afterwards! \\n\\nI think it's very tasty but be prepared to spend money! It's a much better deal if you're going with friends and getting the $25/person combo.

Get a few and split them. You'll get a better appreciation for what they do instead of judging them based off one normal cannoli. Variety is one of their strongpoints.\\n\\nI can't speak for the other treats behind the glass. They have SO many other dessert options and it makes me actually kind of nervous to try them because it's so difficult to maintain good quality all around the larger your menu.

Minor cosmetic renovations bring it back up a notch, but it definitely is not a good value or a \\"nice\\" hotel.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\nAbsurdly loud bathroom fans, hard beds, low quality linens, problems with paint and other finishes, dirty carpets, shower faucet handle came off in my hand, etc. Remember that this is in the nicest room in the place.\\n\\nWe knew all of this going in. We didn't need a super fancy place, we needed a large space where we could fit a bunch of kids and be a little bit loud without bothering anybody. I would not have left a negative review based on the condition of the hotel. What inspired the review was the \\"customer service.\\"\\n\\nMy wife met with a manager at the hotel about 6 weeks in advance. She told the manager exactly what we were doing. The manager showed her the suite and they discussed sleeping arrangements for 8 girls, myself and my wife. They talked about our need for at least 6 roll-away beds. The manager told her that it was a slow time of year and that they wouldn't book anyone close to the suite. My wife was also told that roll away availability would be no problem. \\n\\nMy wife then called a week in advance. She told the person answering the phone that we may end up with 10 girls rather than 8. She wanted to make sure that this wasn't a problem and that we could get up to 8 roll away beds. This was not a short conversation. The person on the phone brought up the reservation and went to check on our questions before returning and telling my wife that the additional girls and roll always were no problem.\\n\\nThe night we came to the hotel there were 5 roll aways. We called to ask for another. The person on the phone said that the manager told her we could not have another roll away and asked how many people we had in the room. When told, she went ballistic about how we were only supposed to have 4 people in the suite, were in violation of fire codes, etc.\\n\\nMy wife tried to explain that we had discussed what we were doing in detail with management ahead of time. The CSR at the front desk was unapologetic. Thankfully, we were not thrown out, but had to make do with fewer roll away beds than planned.\\n\\nThe party went fine. The girls were quiet and well behaved. We generated no complaints and minimal mess.\\n\\nIn the morning we woke to a bill slipped under the door with over $110.00 in charges labeled roll away. First, I'll point out (again) that both roll aways and pricing were discussed weeks in advance. No mention of extra charges for the roll aways. Also worth mentioning was that we did not get the number of roll aways agreed to or asked for. Finally, I'll point out that the rollaways were all in various states of disrepair and extremely uncomfortable. For this we were charged $110? I have traveled extensively with my family and we have NEVER been charged for a roll away.\\n\\nMy wife brought the bill to the front desk and asked about the charges. Again, she was berated by staff for having too many people in the room. Again, my wife attempted to explain that this had all been arranged ahead of time with a manager. The front desk lady was totally unapologetic. She actually said that we should have been aware of the occupancy limits even after having been told that our number of occupants was specifically discussed with management. We tried politely explaining that there was a communication issue among the staff of the hotel. They refused to acnowledge that this was even a possibility. They were dismissive and rude. We got them to take back the additional charges, but only after threatening to put a stop payment on our credit card.\\n\\nUpon leaving, I brought the keys to the front desk. We were already settled up, I did this as a courtesey and to offer another opportunity for them to make things right. This was my first and only interaction with the staff at all. I said, \\"Here are the keys to our suite. You should be aware that at this point I'm planning to leave negative reviews wherever I can due to the treatment we've received.\\"\\n\\nHer response?

As usual beer and mojitos usually get rid of that feeling rather fast.\\n After trying not to devour the basket of rolls we ordered a plate of pulled pork and taters and beans of the green variety, a plate of chicken and taters, a cup of tomato bisque and a order of chicken and dumplings.  the bisque came first and was great though I was wanting more texture. \\n  The pulled pork and chicken was well cooked and the portions were great( had it the next day again and was just as good). To tell the truth some of the best mashed taters Ive had in Portland.\\n  though I could barely move I had to have desert. I cant help myself I am desert junkie and I can tell more about a place by there deserts than there actual food. So judging by the many dishes going to the tables around us(brownie and ice cream, some kind of berry cake thingy, and a few other that got my mouth salivating) we decided that we needed some chocolate cake. So after talking with our wonderful server and coming up with something that wasn't on the menu, basically chocolate cake with raspberries with chocolate and caramel sauce and of course whipped cream. This piece of cake was a  small skyscraper covered in sauce and berries. I had to stop myself from eating before I went past the point of no return. the three could not finish the cake It was HUGE. \\n Overall I had a surprisingly great meal.

Walk away while you still can. DO NOT GO HERE! We paid $50 per person. The food has to be the worst. Fried chicken nuggets with marinara sauce and cheese, \\"shrimp\\" pasta (no shrimp), drinks (low grade/ poorly mixtures). Drinks were so bad that I opted for fountain soda. I figured they could not possibly mess up fountain drinks. Until I asked the server for a refill and he pointed to the fountain near the bar and told me to 'go get it yourself'. Not only was this rude but felt really uncomfortable for myself to have to serve myself behind someone else's bar because they were not interested in caring for their guest. I will never return here. I can NEVER recommend this place to anyone. I will actively suggest to anyone to walk away and pick anything else.

What a disappointment. When we heard they were re-doing the menu and re-designing we were excited as we live right down the street and would have loved it if it became more desirable. Instead, the booths are absolutely tight and uncomfortable. No leg room to sit directly across from someone. The new booth tables so narrow that the waiter actually instructed us to stagger ourselves so our plates could fit on the table. Someone didn't measure the width of the china, the width of the table and the depth of the booths. On top of that, apparently by new menu they meant less items with new lamination.... nothing worth eating. We won't be going back."},{"name":"Clover Food Lab","address":"100 Burlington Mall Rd","city":"Burlington","stars":"4.5","text":"I just happened upon this restaurant and Love love love it!

We love the place and the menu choices. This time we ordered a yummy queso combination to start.  Next our party if 3 split 3 entrees. All were delivered lukewarm. It is very difficult to deliver dishes hot when you have cold items on top of them, like the shrimp tacos. Flavors remained good, but there was a consistent tepid temperature to all.  Funny thing was that the chocolate pudding for dessert was hot!  And outstanding!  We will be back, and hope for the old consistency to return."},{"name":"KFC","address":"5681 Memorial Dr","city":"Stone Mountain","stars":"2.5","text":"It's been years since I last had KFC. I think the last time I had a KFC was in 2008 in my adopted city, Shanghai. I remember it to be good, the skin was tasty, slightly crispy, meat moist and tender, some parts e.g. the wings, meat falling off bones.\\n\\nSo, this was my first try after that long. I was excited of course. We went to the store on Memorial Drive outside 285E. The store was empty at 7pm - Not a single table occupied. We were the only ones there.\\n\\nWalking up to the cashier, we were sort of greeted. I think she wasn't sure if we were ready to place our orders, therefore the half attempt. But that's alright, we weren't really sure of the menu anyway. So she let us to make up our minds. After a few minutes, we ordered the 8 piece chicken (Original), and the 2-piece hot chicken, a new item. We've had hot chicken before and were keen to compare it with KFC.\\n\\nWe took it home, and gobbled our food. The original chicken still had the same taste, moist meat. I LOVE it! It reminded me of my childhood when KFC first opened in my country (Singapore) in the 70s, where real plates were still used. LOL. Eating this brought me real joy.\\n\\nMy husband's Hot chicken (thigh & wings) was definitely better than the one we tried at the Hot chicken festival in TN. We tried Princes' Hot Chicken Granted the one we tried was chicken tenders and therefore did not do Princes' any justice but still KFC was WAY better in taste. The hot seasoning was just a little more tasty at KFC, more flavour than just hot spice. Unfortunately, KFC only gave us 2 thin slices of pickles. Wished there was more, would've made it even more enjoyable and satisfying."},{"name":"Boston Lobster Feast","address":"8731 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"If you are expecting high end, perfectly cooked lobster, stop right now.  Don't go any further.  Do not pass go, do not collect $200.  This place is not for you at all, and only a fool would believe that it is. Now, if you're looking to be a in a fat kid paradise where you can slaughter as many of the lobsters as you can fit inside yourself for an okay price, then you found the right spot.  Sure, the meat is a little on the tough side, body parts of the lobsters are missing, and they may be slightly overcooked.  But that is the kind of place this is. You are not going to get the finest of the sea from a buffet.  It's just not going to happen.  The starting price is $45 plus tax for the buffet, and if the buffet isn't for you, they also have ala carte options.  There are some coupons available, but read the small print. This includes the full buffet and non-alcoholic drinks. \\n\\nWhile the main attraction is, of course, the lobster, the buffet has a lot more to offer to it's guests.  Foods range from king crab legs to prime rib.  Most of it is pretty good (besides the few dried out items).  Once again, I am not that shocked about this from the buffet.   For appetizers, they have a salad bar and a soup station.  I was told by my companion that the New England clam chowder was pretty good, but heavy on the potatoes.  They also have lobster bisque, but you have to ask for it.  I am sucker for lobster bisque so I got a bowl, which I think I paid more for, but I'm not sure.  I have had better, but it was okay.  No real chunks of lobster meat, which you would think they would have no problem doing here. The only two things I did not try were the dessert bar (since I was full), or a mixed drink. I'm more of a beer person. and not usually when I eat.  \\n\\nOverall, the experience was great because I didn't go in expecting big things. The food was decent and if you are looking to get stuffed, then it's a great place.  Yes, it is a little on the pricey side, but still - if you eat one lobster and a few plates of the other stuff they offer, you get your money's worth.  It is truly a fat kid paradise, which would by default make it fat kid tested, fat kid approved.  \\n\\nAs always, stay peckish my friends."},{"name":"The Tiny Coffee Bar","address":"823 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Certainly tiny but great drinks not just coffee.
