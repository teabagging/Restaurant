The soup came out not spicy at all. They didn't add their spice!  After asking them about it, they gave us the spice on the side to put in to our liking.  But if that's the case, why advertise it as 20 chilli peppers, or whatever it is on the menu?  They could have used a simple 'x' to denote that you control the level of spiciness.  Anyway, it just seem that they forgot to put it in, and just gave to us on the side.\\n\\nI got some chicken ramen with bamboo shoots. The broth was flavorful, but the chicken and pork has no flavor.  It was kinda dry for my liking.  I also ordered a pork bun to try, and it was asuper fatty and bland.

Big round bar in the middle surrounded by what looks like two dining rooms one either side. Came in with a group of people, not too busy for it being a Saturday Night. Asked if we could sit at a high top table or had to order from the bar, were told that a server would be right over if we wanted a bar table. 4 people sat at the table and me and another at the bar. Bartender came over and took our drink order, took a little on the longer side but not too bad, it was a short male bartender. No one ever came over to take our friends drink order. No one also ever came back to check on me and my friend, finally I asked someone who was doing dishes if he could take a drink order, he was just the barback and said he would send over a server. No one came  over, the bartenders were all just talking and using their phones by the computer area where they wring in orders. Asked the bar back again if he could just order 4 drinks for our friends. We just picked a drink of the menu for them. No one came over, this whole process was over 30 minutes long, finally I asked the bar back again, as no server ever came over, if we could just get the check so we could leave. Again nothing happened, finally a female girl game over and set four drunks at the end of the bar in front of us, didn't say anything and just left them and walked away. We were still waiting for the check and I was so annoyed at this point, I was asking my friend if we should just leave and refuse the drinks, About a minute later the same woman came back, pushed the four drinks closer to us and walked away again. We took the drinks to our friends and stayed at the table. A short male bartender came over and dropped our check, he asked one of the people who had been at the table the whole time if he enjoyed himself and my friend told him actually no, based on how long drinks took and what really seemed to be rude service, he said he was sorry then put his hand on my back and goes but I bet your friend here had a good time, (he was the first bartender who made me and my friends drink) and I repeated my frustration with the long drink time and the rude feeling I had also.

Eat here when you want to take your time and relax, and expect a long (possibly very long) wait for a table on Saturday and Sunday mornings/afternoons-- this is one of Boston's most popular brunch spots. On the plus side, the servers seem to be actual people with real personalities rather than cardboard cutouts, which is always good. The food is great-- there's really something for everyone here, from a vegan to a truck stop cuisine aficionado.

The aura and smell of the place is quite delicious. and I definitely loved their chicken bao, but the tofu bao had no flavor at all and it was absolutely the last thing one would want when they are hungry. \\nI agree, its a bao place, so one has to keep in mind that the calorie count will definitely be on the low side. Therefore, if you are like me and need a decent amount of food for 7 to 10 bucks, this would not satisfy you. Simply put, its an appetizer restaurant, not meant for a complete meal.

I was told that they are fully booked on a Sunday night but will accommodate walk ins. I came at 6:30. I was told that there's an hour wait. I asked to be seated at the bar and was wait listed for both. The bar hostess took my first name. I walked back to the dinner hostess and she took my last name plus a phone number to text when table is ready. They had mini stand to accommodate standing customers who wants to get started on appetizers and drinks while waiting. I ordered the oysters and a Pinot noir. I ordered the first 8 oysters from the menu plus shrimp cocktail. The oysters all tasted very salty, with  no distinction on the taste. I wonder if they gave me all of the same oysters. In between oysters, I checked with the bar hostess and the dinning hostess the status of my seats several times. The bar hostess offered to check the status but didn't ask my name, went to computer and came back saying that there are 6 names ahead of me. I asked another hostess after 20 minutes and she did the same thing, offered an excuse without asking my name. How do I know that they actually check the status if the didn't ask my name? . Then I couldn't help but ask how they know that I'm still far from the list if they didn't know my name. The bar hostess said don't worry we'll find you. Note that the bar hostess took my first name with no phone number. \\nObservations during my 1:10 min wait. Two table were empty during the duration that I was standing on my left. As I walked around to ask the status of my table (3 times), I noticed two more empty bar tables on the right. They had two women walking around with Ipad observing the people who were eating as if they are predicting how much longer they are going to stay. The empty tables stayed empty as I waited for 1:10.\\nMy son and I decided to leave after eating my oysters and closed the tab. Although I knew the price of the oysters before I walked in I couldn't help but think that it's not worth going there, taking Uber which cost $11.25 from Copley Square. My son who was 17 said he had pretty much a fun day with me---but this experience  was the low. We ended up going to Gather in Northern St, which had very good food. We had just finished our delicious meal as I received a text from Row 34 saying---\\"my table is now ready!\\" I check the time, it's exactly 1:30 from the time they promised me. \\nSo folks, if this place quotes you 1:30 hour wait....walk away, there's a lot of seafood restaurants thriving in Boston with comparable oysters and raw bar.

On to the important stuff:\\n\\n3/4 of us had the filet- they were all cooked perfectly. For a few dollars less for the petite the size difference is not worth it- just go for the full size, that what I did and my boyfriend benefited from the extra I just couldn't squeeze in. The remaining one got the special kansas steak and that had more flavor than the filets, I would have gone with that in the future. Either way, I appreciate the perfectly medium rare steak, and I understand when you cook something that perfectly you don't season it, but I like mine with black pepper and salt- so... I added it, I know the purists will scream foul but hey, I like it. I think it enhances the flavor. \\n\\nFor sides, we got the creamed spinach, hash browns and mushrooms, all very tasty, but: the creamed spinach was a little under seasoned- again fixed by the salt/pepper on the table, so maybe they let you add to taste. The mushrooms would have been better if they were cut instead of leaving the heads full, maybe cut and sauteed with onions and a touch of garlic. They were still excellent and I would get them again, but they could be improved. The hash browns- well how can you go wrong with fried potatoes, cheese and sour cream? you probably can, but these were perfectly crispy. \\n\\nService was great, although our waiter seemed to not understand that the two martinis were supposed to be different, one dirty with kettle one vodka, one cleaner with grey goose, they both were very dirty with kettle, but whatever, luckily neither man was too picky."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I could not write enough good things about this place. \\n\\nIf you like seafood go here.

I tasted no alcohol and it was strangely bitter. We saw our waitress occasionally as she helped other patrons she didn't seem too worried about our table in a nearly empty restaurant. When we tried to check out the waitress didn't seem to understand we were on the dinning plan. We had to keep sending her back to redo the check several times and told her several times not to charge our room. She still did even though we left her cash to pay for the check and her tip.

It's a safe place to go with a discriminating eater. \\n\\nIn the past, for lunch I tried the char-grilled chicken sandwich. An ordinary item, to be sure, but it wasn't anything superior over what you can find at Friday's. Why not take an ordinary item up a notch? No points for creativity or taste there. Service was okay, not great. A 3 star experience. \\n\\nToday for lunch, I finally tried the heralded 'Spice burger' tauted by so many as mind blowing. Well, it is a good burger, but I've made burgers this good and even better. Of course, I'm a good cook, so you know... I will testify, however, that it was juicier than what you find in most places that serve burgers, and it was prepared well (read as: 'prepared early so as to give ample time for meat to absorb in good flavors from the seasoning). Mine was actually somewhat small too. If the bun ever looks too big for the sandwich, then you know something is not right. Service was borderline awful. Server didn't check on me once. No drink refill, no nothing. A 2.5 star experience.\\n\\nThe one time I went for dinner, I tried the macadamia nut/shitake mushroom stuffed pork chops. These were beautiful and ridiculously oversized. I could barely eat 1/2 of the portion. It was a damn tasty entree, but it also rang in at about $28.

They did have a fair number of them, about 10 or so, the fish cakes were good, but everything else was so-so. My Dolsot Bibimbap was OK, there was a generous number of veggies and beef, but the pot was not hot enough so there was little crunch. Not to be a snob, but I don't love dispensing Gojujang in a ketchup bottle and I don't like having to wait forever to get a refill on banchan (they forgot again!).

I didn't care for the any of the side except for the coleslaw and, the bread. OMG THE MOST DENSE BREAD I EVER HAD. The best things was definitely the sauces. There were two sauces that were on the picnic table. I really can't say what they were but, the one in the tin was the best.

I don't let preconceived notions influence me and refrain from experiencing something at least once and more if they rock my world. I think it is important to treat a restaurant for what it is really worth given what your personal experience tells you. I have been to Ruth's Chris several times (never during restaurant weeks - those I don't think always give you the true essence of a good restaurant and their standards) and only in their Boston location. When in the mood for a good steak (doesn't happen very often let me tell you), and when looking for a great ambiance, I feel R-C is a pretty safe bet that never disappoints! Here are my takeaways:\\n\\n+ Great ambiance: This place is perfect for many different kinds of occasions. But my preference is mostly for business dinners, treating an out of town visitor who likes the chain and sometimes just to drop in impromptu to treat yourself and quench your steak thirst. The decor is very classy and mostly inclines towards a rather formal / business casual attire. But us Americans are infamous to not follow rules and tradition, understandably and justifiably so. Again, this location of this chain totally stands out thanks to the grand location it is at. It is such a Boston classic. They did it right!\\n\\n+ The Steaks: I have my favorites here. I love, and I mean LOVE their Cowboy ribeye. Something about the goodness of the ribeye with the bone. I confess I like meat on the bone. It is the real joy of being a carnivore - period! And I have never been disappointed by my medium rare or medium or medium well preparations - given my mood on a given day and such. They do an equally good job with the New York strip as well. Great execution overall. I've never had the opportunity of trying their prix-fixe options but I have heard only good things given the price and the overall options one would get.\\n\\n+ Sides and other options: I once tried their lamb chops. They were perfectly seasoned and very juicy. But I definitely get my fill of the steaks and steer away from other options. The sides are alternately ordered, without trying any others, are always, either the sweet potato casserole or the cream spinach or the Broccoli au gratin. Full marks. I have tried other sides. They were just not my personal preference. No matter who may do the best baked potato or garlic mash in the world, they are just not my thing. So I have no rhyme or reason or right to criticize em.\\n\\n+ Dessert: I once made the mistake of having their bread pudding with the whiskey sauce. I would never do it again. All for good reason. That thing is super-Addictive. And I stand a chance of being a diabetic if I try it again - it is so good. Strange as it may sound, but it is so good that it is so wrong for me is what I conclude.\\n\\nFinally, I love the way some of the bartenders fix the Ruby Red Greyhound. I simply love that drink, especially given I tend to not try too many different cocktails and stick to my usual ones, more often than not. But a man needs to treat self to something new every once in a while, right? I think I am pretty good at that! :) Happy chowing at R-C!"},{"name":"Maria's Pastry Shop","address":"46 Cross St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This may be sacrilege in the north end, but I really don't like cannoli, more specifically, the taste of the fried cannoli shells.

That is a very good thing since the cannoli and lobster tails are filled to order and it takes a minimum of several minutes per order when those items are chosen.\\n\\nMaria herself served us and spent a few minutes in the back filling our precious lobster tails.

The menu is straight forward, standard apps, seafood pastas, a few Italian standards (veal or chicken) and a couple of vegetarian choices. There is also a card of daily specials the server will present to you. We mixed it up...calamari was incredibly fresh and delicious, burrata (fresh ball of mozzarella w/chopped heirloom tomatoes and basil, balsamic and olive oil) was fresh and wonderful, especially with crusty bread. We followed that with Chicken parm (standard fare, nothing special just good, basic and solid) and a large bowl of shrimp & scallops with ziti in a basil cream sauce.  Everything was fantastic and came to the table quick and piping hot.  Our server was very nice and attentive and they never let your water glass go empty. It was a sultry humid day and the same in the restaurant...not much you can do about that but I would imagine it helps move the customers along.

We have any where from 20-100 people at a time at my events.\\n\\nI had gone in here for happy hour one day and noticed there were only about 3 other tables with people.  I figured they might appreciate it if I would bring in my group so I spoke with Michelle, the event planner about this.  We agreed to do a \\"cocktail\\" style party for up to 30 people, extended happy hour until close, separate checks with the server adding an automatic 20% gratuity.  She had mentioned brining in an additional server as well.\\n\\nI arrived about 15 minutes early and was brought to the back, windowless room.  I had wrongfully assumed (my fault for not clarifying this) that \\"cocktail style\\" menat there would be bistro tables for people to put their drinks and food on.  My mistake for not clarifying this as there were no tables in the room so we brought in a few.  I introduced myself to the server, Marty and told him I would be his point of contact if there were any issues.  He wasn't friendly or at all welcoming and it just went downhill from there!\\n\\nMy group started to arrive at 5:15 or so, many of them ordering wine.  Generally they have 3 choices for their happy hour wines but on this day they only had 2 reds available for hh prices.  Well, by 5:45 they ran out of one of them and by 6:10 they ran out of both of them!  I asked Marty what he was going to substitute them with and he said they didn't have anything available.  When I looked at him with surprise he said that normally happy hour ends at 6:30 any way.  I mentioned the extended happy hour for my group and he said there was nothing he could do.  Unfortunately, this conversation took place in front of several people in my group who were drinking the wine.\\n\\nI went out to talk with Michelle about this and she said she would talk with the owners.  I also mentioned that Marty was terribly unfriendly and that things were not going well and my guests were not happy with his service (or lack there of).  Not only was he our server but he was also bartending for our drinks and there was no busser.  He didn't take any of the empty plates or wine glasses off the 3 tables so things were piling up and my guests were waiting 20 minutes before they could even get a drink order in.\\n\\nI again went out to talk with Michelle and said that Marty really needed help.  We finally had the assistance of Brandy, a true saving grace for this place.  She was sweet, accomodating and apologetic.\\n\\nAlthough Caprial and John were aware of the fiasco going on in their restaurant, neither of them bothered to come out from behind the kitchen to apologize.  And to add insult to injury, no one bothered to thank me for bringing in 30 people into their otherwise mostly empty restaurant.  Just because you are a \\"celebrity\\" chef doesn't give you the right to snub your customers.  \\n\\nOkay, restaurant service 101:  \\nGreet your guests and THANK them for their business!\\nGive the customer what was promised!\\nStaff accordingly!!\\nSmile at your customers!\\n\\nAlthough their food is good, it is not memorable and with so many wonderful places in Portland who are thrilled to have our business, I will NEVER return to Caprial's again!\\n\\nAs a disclaimer, I was in the restaurant industry for many years as a server, bartender and also manager of a restaurant/bar so I am respectful of servers and appreciate what goes on behind the scene.

I only got to know this because the waiter had seemed to think that my discussion with my wife about barismo down the street was a complaint (it wasn't, dude, and I still feel bad--I'm really someone who thinks that the Beantown Coffee at the Shell Station on River Street can be considered a gourmet delight--if I'm looking for overcooked convenience store coffee to go with my twinkies). So he and the chef put some sort of Costa Rican or whatever coffee on. My God, I never thought that I'd find three places in Arlington, MASS, that rivaled stuff across the river in Boston or in Chicago or New York or even DC. But you didn't have to go through all that trouble. The first cup was excellent, and I enjoyed it.\\n\\nI will say that the guac isn't that hot, but it does the job.

Yes it's possible that overYelping may sometimes produce not-so-good results).\\nCame with one other person on a Friday night around 5:30pm...we didn't have to wait, but the place was already filling up. (Refer to my tip for the lowdown in regards to reservations.) Noise levels are on the loud end, but I think the restaurant vibe is on the casual/trendy end, so it's appropriate for the venue. On that note, this would be a great place to come a casual date night, girls night out, or post-work munching/boozing. \\nWe got 2 meats, 1 cheese, and 1 side for our charcuterie plate. It comes with mustard (it's really good, if you like mustard), bread, and pickles. Meats and cheeses range from about $6-8 apiece, and there are around half a dozen choices in each category. There are about the same number of sides available, ranging in price from $2-4. So for a good portion, I think you can consider about $10-15 per person, which is not bad at all, especially given that you can choose any combination of pig parts and cheeses you want. \\nWe went with the pork ventresca and bacon wrapped pate, which my dining companion called samgyupsal (Korean style fried pork belly) and spam, respectively. (Can you tell he was even less impressed than I was with this place?) I wasn't all the impressed with the pork ventresca as my other Yelpers seem to be, but I liked the pate.  \\nFor the cheese, we chose Moses milk (I think that was the name) after I asked for a recommendation from our server for a brie-like cheese. It actually tasted just like brie, which was perfectly fine with me. \\nI chose the fig jam for our side, which neither of us thought was anything to write home about. It complemented our cheese though, I think. \\nWith our charcuterie plate, we each had one glass of red wine. He had something that tasted like a pinot noir, and I had a wine that tasted like wine-flavored champagne. Both glasses were all right. I believe they were $8 apiece. \\nWe also shared the pork tasting for $18 is probably not worth it. It was a rather small portion given the money, and I'd probably go with the salald (there's only one on the menu) or one of the pizzas if I came back. \\nI think the menu would be greatly improved with another salad.\\nTheir complimentary bread (I believe it was foccacia, and I'm not talking about the crostini that comes with the charcuterie plate) is really yummy!

It's tough to find sports bars that are unique. It's so easy to fall in line with fried foods, TVs on the wall, and generic beer lists. Stats does tend to fall in line with the food and beer, but at least there are some positives. The food menu sounds a lot better than it turns out to be, and you are probably best off ordering something simple to soak up alcohol than you are actually seeking out a memorable menu item. The beer list isn't great, but there are a few good selections and I have definitely seen worse. You can get a bucket(5 beers) of Miller Lite or Coors Light for $13... not bad for downtown Atlanta.\\n\\nThe atmosphere really makes the place. If it's a nice day and/or night, the rooftop patio is great.

We all sampled the pork ribs, along with a generous helping of brisket and the sausage. The meats here are excellent, make no mistake. Cooked and seasoned to perfection, and very tender. The side dishes were good, really quite good - but served on the colder side of lukewarm which detracted from my enjoying them. The portions were as I imagined them in Texas, quite large, which left the table incapacitated after our main courses and a dessert of fantastic peach cobbler. \\n     I want to stress, the food was good, not stellar, but quite good. The customer service, however, was relatively lacking. Our waiter was very inattentive. He visited the table infrequently, and really did not seem to be enjoying what we was doing. On top of this, we had to wait to eat our food after it was served because he neglected to bring our silverware.  Again, it wasn't awful, but it was enough to notice and detract from our overall enjoyment. \\n     After leaving the table, we made it to the wine bar and decided to sample some of their more popular wines. The bar was tended by a woman who, again, seemed inattentive and lacked energy. She served us our wine, but between glasses, she would move down the bar to speak with another coworker and  leave us guessing as to when she would return. The Salt Lick wines were very middle of the road, nothing extraordinary by any stretch of the imagination. \\n     The food was great, but that was the high point. I don't see myself returning over any other barbecue place closer.

It was nicely rolled in the rice but the tempura bits they put in the roll was too much for the roll. I couldn't taste the salmon and the crunch bits was just distracting.

Our waitress Tanya (introduced ourselves formally last night), is amazing. She remembered us, and our orders, from meeting us only once before! After an $80 meal at Biwa that left us still hungry, we popped in to Revelry. Ordered the steamed veggies again (so effing amazing), and ordered something new - a beef and black bean stew with little rice cakes. HOLY smokes. So incredibly delicious - and only $10. We ended up tipping Tanya 25% because she's amazingly attentive, and the kitchen brought the food out quickly. It was delicious, affordable, and officially one of our new favorite late night date night spots.

Met up with  a couple of friends for a mid week dinner. \\n\\nThe interior is a little bit dark but the seating is comfy and the tables not too crammed.\\n\\nI'm currently not drinking but my companions had mixed drinks from the very interesting looking cocktail menu and delighted in gloating about how good they were (Damn you Mike Y!!)\\n\\nThe bread is H&F and as a result we polished off 3 baskets and probably could have done a 4th.\\n\\nShared some appretizers all of which were kind of meh. The meat balls were ok but how excited can I get about meatballs, the arancini likewise. I was disappointed in the duck speck. Myself and all 3 of my dining companions are greedy charcuterie fans and the  fact that this dish was drowned in olive oil meant there was no melt in the mouth sensation for the cured meat just a slimy sliver of something which could have been anything but mostly just tasted of oil.\\n\\nEntrees we also shared one of the pizza's which was nice tho to be fair i do prefer the dough texture of double zero. The goat cheese chive gnocchi had no flavour of either goats cheese or chives and the sauce was a little tart for my taste. The gnocchi themselves were fairly stodgy. The final dish was the Papardelle which had a duck egg carbonara sauce and was undoubtedly the star or the cooked food we had that evening. i seriously could have beaten off my dining companions with a stick to eat the whole dish myself and it was only my gracious English manners and the 3 baskets of H&F bread which stopped me.\\n\\nFor dessert we shared the assortment of high road gelati, which were over frozen and the trio of flavours we got varied from the bland (butter praline) to the inedible (black molasses and bacon)\\n\\nIn conclusion it's a nice looking spot but I'd be tempted to come back just to hang out at the bar and drink some first rate mixed drinks and fill up on bread"},{"name":"Moonlight Drive-In","address":"1515 S Washington Ave","city":"Titusville","stars":"4","text":"I've been a customer of Moonlight for over 20 years.

They sat us down in our own alcove and gave us a wide variety of food to sample including, meats, cheeses, olives and warm bread, and a glass of sparkling wine. One of the managers gave us a rundown of the Barcelona concept, of its background, and of the food we were getting. He seemed incredibly passionate and excited about what he was serving. \\n\\nThe next time I went was for a late brunch. It wasn't very bus and my date and I were given a complimentary order of the Spinach-Chickpea Casserole and asked for feedback. It's refreshing to see a restaurant that cares so much about their customers and the food they're serving! I think their brunch is a great alternative to the other places in the Inman Park area that often have incredibly long waits. I've had the Gulf Shrimp and Grits and the Goat Cheese and Chorizo Crepes, but my favorite is the Barcelona Burger! It may be counter-intuitive to order a burger at a tapas place, but this is one of the best burgers I've found in Atlanta! \\n\\nAs far as dinner time, I've always had a great experience as well. Whether with a group of girlfriends or when my dad was visiting. They have a great wine selection (like they advertise) and other fun drinks!

But really, this review is a 3.5 with the benefit of the doubt to make a 4. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Average. Very large, spacious and kind of casual and dark. Nice intimate setting, fun use of \\"oyster\\" related items used to make up the decor. Comfortable and a bit loud. Not exactly the place for a fancy dinner, though the prices kind of scream fancy dinner. I was a little disappointed in how loud, casual and bar like it felt...but it was just something that I didn't expect and I wouldn't call it bad (just don't dress up). \\n\\nService: Average. When I got to a place that is famous for their oysters, I expect a menu with descriptions for each oyster - and this is lacking. I had to wave our somewhat non-existent but very nice and helpful waitress down a few times in order to ask questions about the menu. She seemed to sort of guess her way through the oysters and beer selections. It might be a good idea to brief the staff on the offerings. (She didn't do a bad job and I really did like the friendliness of the staff). \\nBig PLUS: they are very apt to bring over tasting flights for beer and are appreciative of tips. \\nPoints off for timing: At first they were serving way too fast - I mean raw bar and appetizers at the same time, very crowded. And then when I said to slow down, they left at least 30 min between the appetizers and the entree. The dessert was also lightning fast. \\n\\nFood: \\nAppetizers\\nRaw Bar was amazing,but the price was quite high. Either way, absolutely fantastic. \\nTuna Tartare - nothing exciting here, I was surprised that it wasn't as fresh as expected and the flavors seemed somewhat muted\\nFried Calamari - fantastic, not too oily and really tasty\\nSea Urchin Toast - UNBELIEVABLE - must have if it's a special. So fresh and tasty \\n\\nEntree\\nWe shared the branzino (we had a lot of appetizers) and it was OUTSTANDING. Perfectly prepared - light, flaky and tasty. Definitely recommended. \\n\\nDessert\\nButterscotch pudding with puffed rice - OMG - one of the best desserts that I've ever had - absolutely AMAZING. I was stuffed to the gills and tried to cancel my dessert, but because it was my birthday the waitress give it to us on the house. I would go back to this restaurant just for this dessert. DO NOT MISS - A MUST HAVE. I found a way to eat it all with my husband. \\n\\nOverall, the food is a 4.5 star level just in reach of 5, the service is something like a 3.5 for inconsistency, the price is a 4, the atmosphere is a 3.5 - a bit to casual/bar like/noisy. That's how we get to a 4 star, with room for improvement. \\n\\nTip: Do try one of the local beers - I don't even like beers and I definitely enjoyed the selection. \\n\\nRecommended."},{"name":"Daawat","address":"500 W Canyon Ridge Dr, Ste L-275","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Don't ever go here.

The food is fresh, well prepared and completely different from anything else in Beverly. We all enjoyed ourselves.\\n\\nTartines are a perfect lunch. The goat cheese and fig is a favorite, as is the smoked salmon. The salad of fresh greens has a very nice, not-to-vinegary, vinaigrette. Very satisfying.\\n\\nThe quiche are good portions with a delicious crust. Also served with a salad.\\n\\nThe charcuterie is a nice appetizer to make a larger meal, or as a light lunch by itself, and comes with a very nice assortment of sliced sausages.\\n\\nThe soup (I've had three so far) is delicious. I wish the name of the soup were on the board, though--it would make deciding while waiting in line easier than asking at the counter. The bowl is quite large and makes a satisfying lunch with bread. A smaller cup size to accompany the Tartines or quiches would be a nice addition.\\n\\nThe caprese salad is gorgeous with yellow and red vine-ripened tomatoes, soft fresh mozzarella, and a pile of fresh greens topped with shavings of prosciutto.\\n\\nThey have a nice selection of Belgian beers that come on a small tray with a brand-appropriate glass and a small ramekin of cheese pieces to nibble while drinking. Very nice. Though expensive, they also carry the local Gentile brew, which is a great addition to the list.\\n\\nThe tea is high quality and comes on a tray with a cup and saucer and hot water in a POT--thank you!!! Either a small piece of chocolate or a biscuit is on the side. Though I haven't explored all of the coffee drinks, I've had a latte and it was well made.\\n\\nThe Belgian sugar waffles are delicious. I could eat them endlessly.\\n\\nThe decor is simple and clean, light and airy. The noise in the room can get rather loud when it is busy, however. Some sort of acoustical treatment for all of the hard flat walls would be something to investigate.\\n\\nThe bathrooms are clean and simply stylish.\\n\\nWhenever I have asked about something it has been happily and knowledgeably explained. The staff is excellent.\\n\\nClearly, a lot of thought went into every aspect of this restaurant. The owner is pleasant and thoughtful. They are not trying to do too much, but what they do, they do well. It is a cafe with a European sensibility--not a full restaurant--and they are open all day long. I'm happy to have something new that is both unique and of quality in town. Compared to some other places, it's little bit on the high side in price, but the quality is so good that's worth paying for (I've almost given up ordering smoked salmon in restaurants, for instance, but not here, and the quiche tastes as good as it does because the eggs are fresh).

Sandwiched between the nightmarish mess that was the repaving/planting of McLoughlin, and the building of some lovely condos up a couple blocks, is the newly refurbished McLoughlin Building. Talk about your perfect timing - the Spring Creek Coffee House opened this Spring in what I like to call \\"Milwaukie Proper\\" - fronting the McLoughlin building (how original) and taking center-stage on the new boulevard-style stretch of McLoughlin is this charming little java-joint. And in what can only be called an astute move, the owners timed this perfectly with the potential onslaught of semi-urban residents about to fill the large complex of condos and townhouses up a block. Man, I wish I'd thought of it!\\n\\nPeople: in my bi-weekly visits during the morning commute, I haven't seen many customers in this place. I have no doubt that come fall, when the condos begin to be occupied, SC will be packed in the morning and evening by the folks living up the street. For commuters coming North on 99E, this is a great pit-stop (sure beats the Milwaukie Fred Meyer Starbucks) with off-street parking, easy re-entry to the highway, and your coffee will still be warm when you arrive downtown.\\n\\nSpace: the SC is well-designed, with customers lining up near shelves of merchandise and a well-stocked pastry case to order from a very legible chalk menu. The inside seating area is above-average, and the few times I've seen folks in the shop, they've been happily ensconced in wing-back chairs, sipping from cafe-ware.\\n\\nPeople: I have yet to establish a relationship with the counter crew or barrista here - it seems that every time I visit there's a different staff. They are always nice, friendly if a bit befuddled with my semi-simple order (16 oz. extra-hot nonfat latte with 1/2 shot of vanilla to go) often calling over the barrista so I can repeat. \\n\\nCoffee: SC is brewing portland roasting (www.portlandroasting.com) coffee and it is excellent. The locally artisan-roasted beans are handled well and cleanly, with attention to placement and temp. This is not a particularly bold brew, so those with a liking for heavy espresso flavor may opt to request an extra shot. Thank you, SC, for supporting a local microroaster and having a 5-cent credit for recycling sleeves.\\n\\nFood: It is with the pastry offerings that I notice the most distinct difference between SC and the other options on my morning drive: WInd Horse (around the corner - amazing tea selection) and Starbucks. Starbucks pastry is becoming increasingly substandard by the day, with refrigeration issues, inappropriate price-to-size ratio, and - in my opinion - a trend toward a predictable lack of freshness. Wind Horse has excellent offerings if you prefer a more earthly, whole-grain, natural-tasting morning treat. The pastries at SC are fresh, huge (plan to share with a friend) and reasonably priced. While I haven't tried them, there are bars here from Piece of Cake (amazing bakery not too far from SC) that look delicious.\\n\\nTheme: here's something you don't see everyday in your local coffee house. If you look close (actually, not necessary - they're everywhere) you can see FROGS throughout the shop, including on their cup sleeves, in the decor and so forth. Frogs - not sure why, but they're there.

Guess we beat the dinner rush. \\n\\nAs another reviewer stated, the family style all-you-can-eat is a LOT of food, and it's $20 a head so only get it if you can eat a lot. I got 3/4 lb of pork ribs and it was just the right amount. I love that their pickles are the nice, fancy deli pickles and not the crappy, cheap dill slices that usually come with BBQ. I also love the not-Wonderbread bread that they have. The brisket is tender and moist without being fatty, and the ribs are awesome. They are somehow crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Their BBQ sauce is different from other BBQ sauces in that they seem to use mustard instead of a vinegar base. \\n\\nThe service was pretty good, we got our food very soon after we ordered it.

We thought our friends were crazy to want to drive an hour and a half to two hours to eat BBQ. When we were driving there, I noticed how beautiful the area is. We drove up to it and the parking lot is huge and dusty. There was live music blasting and people walking all directions. We put our name on the list and waited. You can walk over to the wine area and pick a glass (served in a clear plastic cup) to take along with you. Unfortunately, there are no kiddos allowed in the wine area. My friends and I had to take turns with my daughter while the others went to get wine. Or you can get a lemonade or just sit and listen to the music. We went over to the kid's play area, which they enjoyed. When we got inside, we ordered everything family style and cracked open the cooler, since it is BYOB. The first round of brisket was amazing. It had a lot of the tips of beef and was really flavorful. The sausage is consistently good and the meat platter had ribs. It also came with beans, coleslaw, bread and mashed potatoes. I liked them all. My husband even liked the potatoes and he never eats mashed potatoes. On the second round, the brisket wasn't quite as good, not sure why. Everything else was the same as the first round. The third round we asked for just brisket. But I think they have some sort of rule that they just bring out equal portions of each meat for every round even though the waiters agree to just bring brisket, or whatever you ask for specifically. We had a large party and the server handled it well and even took pictures of our party for us. We always get the cobbler for dessert and I think it is just ok. I'm also pretty full by that time. Oh and the restaurant is kind of loud. I left like I was shouting to the person next to me.\\n\\nIt's important to note the first time I ate Salt Lick, I think the flavors were too rich for me or something and upset my stomach. The second time, I held back, ate less, and did much better.\\n\\nAlso, I think it might be cash only, but there is an ATM there. The restaurant seems to be a well oiled machine with servers walking fast and big crowds, so keep your kids close. \\n\\nSince the restaurant is BYOB, people have their coolers on wheels with them the whole time. It is hilarious to see groups of ladies dressed up together in heels dragging their coolers around in the dust outside!\\n\\nThe Salt Lick is quite an experience and I'd love to go back if we have family or friends in town."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"smack smack nom nom smack lick lips. I wish my fingers were always covered in Salt Lick BBQ sauce. So I wouldn't call myself an expert when it comes to BBQ. I'm sorry, I just don't crave plates full of meat. HOWEVER, I will eat it from time to time and from my limited experience, Salt lick has the best BBQ sauce I've ever tasted. I am partial to vinegar based sauces, and actually vinegar based anything so this BBQ really hits the spot for me. \\n\\nAnd really Salt lick isn't just a BBQ joint, it's an experience, it's a tourist attraction, it's a day trip. Bring beer, bring friends, bring a frisbee to throw around while you wait. There's something charming about hanging out in the Texas hill country with people from all walks of life that drove an hour plus just to eat BBQ. \\n\\nSo I tried some super moist brisket which was excellent and extra fatty. I tried some pork ribs which were extremely juicy and tender. And I tried the potato salad which is the one of the best I've ever had! It is also vinegar based (no wonder I like it) instead of mayonnaise based. \\n\\nI also tried the pecan pie just to add even more guilt, oh yes with a giant scoop of ice cream (guilt-o-meter rising), and it was quite delicious.

I'm not really sure if there are regional differences in curry rice in Japan, but the owner is from the Kansai area, and I find this recipe to be wonderfully complex, slightly richer than anything I can make or remember.\\n\\nCurry is not one of those things that you just \\"whip up\\" quickly so I appreciate the quick service.  I usually get an extra portion of the red pickles as the tangy flavor is a very nice compliment to the richness of the stew. Not a bad deal for $7-8.\\n\\nThis is not for people who like to mull over the menu, and contemplate many options.  This is a specialty curry place. They do one thing, and do it very well.

This visit was 5 months after the review posted below. We didn't announce ourselves and, as usual, we brought out-of-state visitors. We try to come on slower mid-week days, so seating took less than a minute, and we got to select our preferred spot. Food was much more like previous successful visits. We had a little of everything. Brisket is the star of the show --- moist, tender, great taste even without sauce, but we also enjoyed the ribs, sausage, and the amazingly moist turkey. We've never had the turkey before because our family assumes it has to be dry. Wrong. This was a nice surprise. This time we added dessert: peach cobbler and chocolate chip pecan pie. Two more surprises. These are not an afterthought. The cobbler was large and warm. Yum. Better yet was the excellent pecan cc pie. Wonderful.  Ok. Ok.  We'll be back. That last experience was out-of-the ordinary. This one more typical.]\\n\\nI'm going to be qualify this review before I begin.  This is our 4th visit over a 5 year period. This one was a let down. In fact, we're a bit reluctant to bring visiting relatives in the future. We've always raved about Salt Lick for the ambiance and especially the food. This time around we felt the brisket and ribs were dry and none of the food was very hot. This was a slower afternoon in late Fall, and we thought we'd get the best opportunity for great BBQ.

This place sucks from top to bottom and I don't envision a long future for them.  Got there early because I wanted to eat.  I was meeting 3 others.  I was informed they would not be sitting incomplete parties.  Which I totally understand leading up to a game but this was 2 hours before the game with 27 open tables!  (Yes I counted them)  The hostess had a ridiculous attitude and was incredibly rude.  She then stuck me at the A-hole table.  This table was located behind a 4' concrete slab with crap views of all the TV's.  Was this my punishment for being snarky about incomplete party policy?  Maybe.  I order my food and drinks from the saddest waiter of all time.  If I had to guess his dog died, his girlfriend cheated on him and his truck broke down last night.  My friends came and we relocated ourselves to a better table and then we watched.  The rude hostess tried time and time again to sit unsuspecting victims in the shit seats!  12 different times she brought folks to the obstructed view seats. Did she get a bonus for screwing over people?  If you show up early you shouldn't get the shaft, the people that get there late should.  \\nThe place is crowded now, packed with people in for the game.  The saddest waiter is no where to be seen.  Ohh there he is up by the hostess stand leaning on his elbows.  So we order a beer from what looks like the manager.  We finish that beer before we see our waiter again, who acts annoyed that we asked someone else to get us a beer.  The 1st quarter ends this place sucks we are leaving.  Not that they care.  I'm sure they filled the table with another unsuspecting client.  \\n\\nIt's funny how many incomplete parties I saw seated throughout the morning.  The food was nothing special.

The waiter was very attentive and seemed skilled, but was brusk and seemingly uninterested in sales. \\n\\nThis evening, the starter was pate (chicken liver mousse) on crostini, thecrostini burnt (not charred, but burnt) apparently with a torch.  The crostini was so burnt the bitter taste overwhelmed the flavor of the pate.  The green salad was nicely prepared and delicious.  The hanger steak was unevenly cooked, some bits to perfection, others overcooked, and was a small, unadorned portion for the $16 price.  The cabbage side dish, a wedge, was burnt to a crisp on one side.  Once the burnt cabbage was cut off, it was very nicely seasoned, tender, and delicious.  The simple spaghetti dish was nicely cooked, well seasoned, and delicious, but underwhelming in size.  \\n\\nThere is such a weird attitude in this place. It's hit and miss.

We had seen them on Scoutmob, but finally decided to give the place a try when we got a dining dough certificate from AmEX worth $50. Big mistake!\\n\\nAwful doesn't begin to describe this mess. The writing was on the wall the minute we arrived. Sure wish we had paid attention. Costly mistake.\\n\\nWe knew where the hotel was, so no problem. However, we decided to park ourselves, driving into the parking deck expecting there to be some clue as to where to park. Nada. We called the restaurant, after driving about 3 levels with no indication of where to park for the restaurant. Parking for the restaurant was on the 9th floor, from which you have to walk down a flight of stairs and take an elevator to the ground floor. It's not indicated where the restaurant is, but we go off on the ground level and began the search for the restaurant--wandering around in the dark until we were later for the reservation than we had been after leaving a movie that lasted longer than expected. No signs. No clues. Just \\"find your way...\\"  I should have heeded the warning.\\n\\nWhen we finally made it to the entrance, we saw that the place was about 1/3 occupied. We were greeted by someone yelling in our general direction from the middle of the restaurant, \\"table for two?\\" and taken around a corner, seated near windows that soon had cars arriving at the hotel, blinding us every time one approached.  Really???  When the place is far less than full?\\n\\nWe ordered a couple of mojitos and two appetizers--fried calamari and a ceviche. The calamari was incredibly salty, greasy and lifeless. The ceviche was not bad, but nothing special. The mojitos fared better. They were very good, strong drinks.  At least they got one thing right...\\n\\nI ordered the prime rib, which I hadn't had in a good while, and my partner ordered the salmon. When they came, my prime rib was well done instead of med. rare as I had ordered it, with a lukewarm baked potato. My partner's salmon was quite literally cold. We sent both of our meals back. If you knew my partner, who was in the restaurant business for 22 years, and who understands that things sometimes happen, you'd know how bad something actually has to be for him to send it back. \\n\\nIn the interim, we ordered a couple of glasses of wine. Geronimo didn't seem to be able to understand what my partner was ordering for us, so he ended up just (literally) pointing it out on the menu. My merlot didn't taste right, but again, I drank it anyway. Only when we got the bill did we have it confirmed that the server had indeed served me a cabernet instead. Nice pour though...\\n\\nWhen the server returned with our replacement meals, they were once again unsatisfactory, with both barely warm, albeit cooked to order, with his fish obviously dried out under the heat lamp. Also, I had asked for some raw horseradish for my rather tasteless prime rib (a $30 entree, btw!!!), and once an interpreter was brought out to determine what it was I was talking about, I was brought a small side of chopped up red radish. Prime rib on their menu, and they've never had ANYONE ask for horseradish?!\\n\\nWe didn't send the food back again, telling our server that it was still not right, but that we would just eat it, given that we had already sent it back once. If you're like us, when you go out, you don't want to ruin the mood completely by belaboring the point over and over about the food not being right. It was obvious that it just wasn't GOING to be right. If they can't make it right even when they know it has been wrong already, then it's obvious that they aren't capable or willing. Cut you losses, which is what we did. Geronimo was very apologetic, saying how awful he felt, etc., and he DID seem sincere, but at no point was a manager brought over, or any other kind of overture made.  \\n\\nFinal tally: $85 after the discount of $50.

But I asked for it without the turkey, because if it wasn't for bacon, I could be a very happy pure-play vegaquarian/pescatarian, instead of cheating with that smoky pork-strip siren. Because, together, bacon and avocado is just one of the best things on earth. Heck, bacon and ANYTHING is my definition of taste destination.\\n\\nThe wrap arrived. The kitchen got it right because there was no turkey. However, there was no avocado either.

And I don't order guacamole if it's not a Mexican restaurant. Too many places pass off tasteless browning glop sans cilantro and lime as guac. Nope, wasn't gonna go there. \\n\\nI declined the waitress' offer of a replacement, and I ate my BLT wrap, somewhat begrudgingly. I forgot to see if I got charged for the BLT or the BLATT.\\n\\nAnd the pickle accompanying it was an ick-le. A weird green color. Tasted off. Now, I'll admit I have a bias for true kosher deli dills full of briny goodness, so anything else is just a waste of my time and taste buds.\\n\\nOn their website, I checked later, the BLATT says guacamole.

We each got a combo platter.... he got the 2 egg, biscuit & gravy, smoked kielbasa, grits, & rye toast combo.  I got the 2 egg, challah french toast, fresh kielbasa, & 2 potato pancakes combo.  He was very hungry so he finished his, but I had leftovers that will be perfect for another meal.  While we were waiting for our meals to arrive I went to the front of the restaurant to peruse the many delicious pastries & the deli case.  There were a few bottles of Viking Blod, a honey-based wine (mead) & our server was so kind as to bring us a wee tasting of it.  We both enjoy mead & this was truly delicious.

This location is BYOB and cash only. Located in a town where farms and ranches thrives, sets up a perfect atmosphere for some good old fashion BBQ. The good, the savory smells of smoked bbq lingering from inside the restaurant to the outside. The bad, the 1.5 hr of teasing till you actually got to taste it in your mouth. Perhaps it was because it was Memorial Day weekend or everyone was thinking bbq that day. Its not all that bad since there are benches outside for you to sit while you wait and if you have a cooler filled with wines and Shiners. There is also live music to entertain and occasional free samples of their savory smoked sausages. \\n\\n\\nFor first timers, they recommended the family style meal. You get unlimited portions of their famous beef brisket, sausages, and ribs. Also baked beans, coleslaw, mashed potato, breads and pickles. The ribs and sausage I thought were excellent but the brisket was a bit disappointing. It was quite dry even with extra BBQ sauce smothered on top. My friend who goes on a more frequent occasion tells me its not usual for the brisket to be so dry so again holidays might be a disadvantage. Maybe I'll go back next time when its NOT a holiday then I can try the real deal.\\n\\n\\nOh and if you're a tourist like me and would like to take some of their sauces home but worry about checking your bags in, don't worry.. after you pass TSA at the airport, there's a Salt Lick stand (Near Continental Gate 12 in my case) where you can bring home so beef brisket (cooked or uncooked) salsa and their famous BBQ sauce.

I was nervous about going all the way up on the spice scale so I asked for a level between the second highest and the highest (they go by stars) so they said I could have a 4.5 star spice level which was perfect, whereas my mother (my dining partner) cannot handle any spice at all so she asked for 0 stars and was satisfied as well.

My view stayed the same as I gave it another try and walked away feeling ehh.  This place could be lower depending on what you grade them on.  Food seems to be of quality and cooked properly (chicken pieces were nice sized and not stringy) but everything I ate tasted just average.  Not spicy, sweet, salty, or savory.\\n\\nCurry Chicken: basically chicken with onions, carrots, water chestnuts, and a few snow peas.  I tasted very little curry spice except in my first bite.  maybe they make chicken with veggies and then just sprinkle a little on it to make it Curry chicken.  \\n\\nGeneral Tso's:  average taste with little to no spice.  Nice pieces of chicken. $7.25 for combo.\\nCrab Rangoon: Not the overly sweet taste that some do and it seemed to be more real crab than other places.  Only 5 for $4.25 seems pricey.\\n\\nPrior trip below:\\nMy wife and I ordered two dishes that we thought be different from each other.  When we got home, we couldn't tell if we got the same dish or something different.  My wife ordered Black Pepper Chicken while I ordered Hunan Chicken.  I thought they were the same thing from taste and look.  We called them to see if they made a mistake.  They said that they made the two different dishes but i still have doubts.  They offered to make another dish for free but I didn't feel like driving back up.  The Hunan Chicken was decent.  The Black pepper was not like some places Black pepper where it is a dry rub.  This was a sauce very similar to Hunan.  My wife didn't like it so I received leftovers for lunch since she preferred to eat something else.\\n\\nThe egg rolls were ok but not as great as I have read on other reviews.

I also have delivered food from this establishment numerous times. The food was great and the service, especially from the hostess, has been outstanding. A recent  and unbelievably horrible interaction with owner Anthony Sanders has led me to the decision that despite the good food and the helpful and pleasant hostess, I will literally never set foot in this restaurant again.\\n\\nOn a recent delivery I parked in a space behind the restaurant. As I waited for the food, I asked the hostess to confirm whether it was ok that I had parked there or if I needed to move. She said that it was perfectly fine, so I waited for the two orders for delivery. When I returned, a \\"gentleman\\" in a white suv had pulled in behind me, blocking me in. He was also blocking a food delivery vendor's truck attempting to deliver supplies to the restaurant and was also blocking part of the street as well. It turns out that this man was the owner, Anthony, and I was in \\"his\\" space.\\n\\nAlthough he was still sitting in his suv when I came out, as some sort of punishment for being in his space, he refused to simply let me out so that I could deliver hot and fresh food for two of his customers and then just pull into the parking space. Instead, he got out of his suv and went inside the restaurant instead. I went back inside to inform the hostess of what was occurring and she apologized profusely for telling me it was ok to park where I had. I told her there was no need for her to apologize to me, because the issue was the owner's unacceptable and inexcusable behavior and I didn't understand what kind of person would behave this way. It was especially surprising since his behavior was having an immediate and definitively negative impact on his own customers at home dining experience.\\n\\nI returned to my car and waited patiently for approximately ten minutes as he prevented me from leaving the premises, allowing the food to get cold while also keeping his food vendor from unloading his truck that he was also blocking. Anthony came in and out of the restaurant, completely ignoring me as I was unable to leave. I consciously decided not to ask him again to simply let me out of the space since it was clear his behavior was intentionally mean spirited.\\n\\nEventually someone that I believe to be the manager came out and I explained how I didn't understand why the owner of this restaurant would be so rude and demonstrate such a complete disregard for his own customers. He informed me that he was the owner and he also apologized that the hostess told me it was ok to park where I did. I told him the same thing I told the hostess, that the issue wasn't me being given permission to use the space, but that the owner would behave in a way that completely disregards his guests at home awaiting hot food and his vendors providing a service for his establishment.\\n\\nHe finally got back in his suv and as he sped off he actually yelled out the window to his employee \\"tell him not to park in my space again!\\" This of course will never be an issue because under no circumstances will I support the business of someone who behaves this way. Not only will I not come back as a guest, nor invite friends, nor facilitate at home dining but literally anytime I am in a position to dissuade someone from spending their hard earned money at this place, I will make it my mission to share this story over and over again. I'm actually considering mounting a social media campaign to share this experience and see if other customers or vendors have experienced the same. Ultimately that depends of how much further energy I want to expend on this and him, which is honestly not much at all.\\n\\nGreat job, Anthony! You are an excellent example to your staff on how NOT to behave. Your behavior and attitude are so troubling because I genuinely enjoyed the food, the staff, being able to bring this food to people at home to enjoy, and supporting local businesses. You may want to look at FAST FOOD CHAIN Chick-Fil-A for an example of how to provide customer service.

The double beef ribs was our next favorite was the same fall of the bone goodness but not as much packed flavor like the pork ribs. The brisket surprisingly was our least favorite and that was because some of the pieces were rather dry. \\n\\nFor two people, 1.5 lbs of meat is good enough.

A bit of a buzzkill to wait for the taps to be turned back on, but a good chance to escape to check out the bathrooms that Eric S talks about. \\n\\nThe overall vibe is cool, and the menu definitely has some interesting interpretations - we got the cheese fondue, and the array included sausage, apples, giant croutons, and broccolini? Definitely a twist on your run of the mill fondue.  Also on the menu are things like a Thai steak salad, nachos that could feed a small army, and (interestingly), 'Southern hummus,' a.k.a. pimento cheese.\\n\\nPark in the deck across the street, and they will validate your parking - you have to pay $5, but then you'll be refunded when you bring your validated ticket back out. \\n\\nThank goodness they can keep their sports bar status in my book - the staple of wings made the menu - the quintessential item of choice for any self respecting sports bar."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great pizza!

I called to ask if the shuttle was still running and was told yes. I was transferred to guest services. No one answered. I called again and was again transferred to guest services. This time someone answered and said they will be there in 30 minutes and tell me where to meet them. I do exactly that but there's no shuttle. I call and 15 minutes later he shows up but we have to wait for more people. Finally departs 30 minutes after the pick-up time I was given.\\n\\n2. When I checked in, I was very tired and just wanted to go to my room and rest. I was told I would get a room \\"upgrade\\" with a corner room on the 10th floor with a balcony. I thanked the man at the front desk and went to the room. Horrible, mean setup. This room faces ALL the highways and is extremely noisy. It feels like you are on the highway. Because it's a corner room, you hear all the highways going in different directions. Because it's on the 10th floor, you are right there next to the highways. And because there is a balcony, it's not soundproof. I had to haul all my stuff back downstairs to immediately change rooms.\\n\\n3. I went back to the front desk to get a different room and was told that there were only two hotel rooms left in the ENTIRE hotel. The second room I was given was on the first floor. It was very dirty and was probably the room that owners with pets were given. It had horrible smells and to make it worse, I could smell the smokers who were smoking outside the balcony near the swimming pool. It had an adjoining room so I could hear the conversations of the people next door- and with the smells coming from the adjoining room I think they were smoking inside the room with their balcony door open. It did not help that their dog was constantly barking at midnight.\\n\\n4. After a terrible night, I went back to the front desk to ask for a new room. This time I got a normal room. No apology, no sorry for ruining the sleep you needed before your big business meeting, no upgrade, nothing. And the shower had no water pressure.\\n\\n5. My flight was at 8am the following morning and I needed to get to the airport in the morning. I called the front desk and was told that the shuttle runs at 7am. I asked how could I get to the airport and he responded, \\"Like I said, our shuttle starts running at 7am.\\" I asked if he could call a cab. He rudely said no but I could call one and gave me a phone number. I called it and asked to be picked up at 6:30am.\\n\\n6. In the morning, I went downstairs to wait for my cab. The shuttle was running at 6:30am!! Why would I pay $20 for a cab if there is a free shuttle to take me to the airport? It was too late to cancel my cab. Omni owes me $20.\\n\\n7.

But I was more than disappointed with the tzatziki..I have a mild obsession with the staple Mediterranean condiment. Absolutely no flavor :/ maybe it was a bad batch??

The chicken was like eating a cloud it was so amazing. We got some sake ($17) that was also good! Our server Yesenia opened the bottle so we could drink some then she wrapped it up so we can take the rest to go (I had no idea you could do that).\\n\\nThe one thing that stood out to me that blew my mind was the amount of customer service they have here, specifically Yesenia. Throughout dinner the servers would come out and sing \\"Happy Birthday\\" to people who were celebrating their birthdays and bring them out a bowl of ice-cream. When Yesenia brought us our sake she poured it for us and then heard my fiance and I wish each other \\"happy anniversary\\". Literally 2 minutes later the entire serving staff was coming out with instruments and singing us a song along with giving us a bowl of ice cream to share with a candle to blow out. I was amazed. My fiance and I were both so confused, after they were done singing Yesenia looks at us and says, \\"Happy Anniversary!\\" I was blown away :) \\n\\nWill definitely be back.

I do eat fish on occasion and I will eat meat (beef, chicken, pork...you get the picture) every once in a great while. Being that I was in Texas and Texans boast to have the best BBQ in the country, I decided to allow myself to try this supposed meat wonder.\\n\\nMy friend thought Salt Lick would be best because of the ambiance, and well, the BBQ is good. One sunny Monday afternoon the three of us drove about half an hour to the middle of no where. Apparently this is a bit of a tourist attraction and has been featured in many Food Network programs. We pulled in and it started to look vaguely familiar. It is a stone building and when you walk in it sort of feels like you are entering a barn but a barn strictly for dead and cooked animals. On the right all sorts of meat is charred and glistening waiting patiently to be devoured. The smell, oh the smell, was the aroma of deliciousness. I could have stood there and sniffed for hours and would have been satisfied.\\n\\nWe were seated and given menus. They are pretty basic: meat selection, side selection, and combination selection. The plates were big and I was unsure I wanted to consume that much meat in one sitting I let my friend take the ordering reigns and he suggested we get a little bit of everything. \\n\\nThe waiter came and took our order of brisket, ribs, sausage, bread, potato salad, and cole slaw. My friend asked for a certain kind of rib and the waiter said they were out but promised to bring out the ribs they did have to let us try them to see if we wouldn't mind having those instead. All our food came out very quickly and a meatfest commenced. I must admit I wasn't all that impressed with the ribs and sausage but the brisket, hot damn that brisket, was wonderful. It was burnt in the right places, had the right amount of fat, and melted in your mouth. There was a sweet hot mustard condiment that was perfect to douse the meat with. The sliced white bread soaked up everything. The potato salad and cole slaw were mild and not as creamy as the potato salad and cole slaw I'm familiar with. Not saying there were bad, just different. \\n\\nOnce the check came the waiter said he wasn't going to charge us for the ribs since they didn't have the kind we wanted.

We simply went to the main attractions as soon as the park opened (despicable me, transformers) and then went to the other rides later in the day - when most people were riding the main attractions. This way, we were able to ride to the less popular rides during the times that others were lining up for the main attractions. \\n\\nWe zipped through the lines. 10 minutes for transformers, 15 for despicable me, 20 for Rip Ride Rocket. Since we got there early, we were hungry by 1130, and ate before the major lunch crowd lines began forming around 1215. Then, we were riding rides while everyone was eating. We rode The Mummy twice, with only 5 minute wait times, and we waited 10 minutes for ET. During the middle of the day, we went to Springfield (simpsons land) which is AMAZING.  If you are at all a fan of the show, they have done a great job replicating the quik-e-mart, moes tavern, and krusty burger. We went into moes and had a tasty 20oz duff beer (its an amber ale) for only 7 bucks, and then went and played some of the midway games out front and won an Itchy plush toy from Itchy and Scratchy. We had a really great time. \\n\\nNote: while your in simpsons land, be sure to check out the construction across the lagoon on Diagon Alley and the Hogwarts Express Station, it looks awesome, and you can already see it coming together!\\n\\nBeing the middle of the day, we waited the longest for Men In Black (30 minutes), and then rode other rides like Twister, Disaster, and Shrek 4d, which all had 5-10 minute wait times. Really fun, and worked out perfect.  \\n\\nBy evening we were getting tired from walking around, and so we opted for sit down shows. We went to the horror makeup show, and terminator 3d with 0 wait time, and then went to find a seat for the cinematic spectacular. \\n\\nWe got our seat at 9:00PM for the 9:45 show, and i'm glad we got there early. Seating along the lagoon starts to fill up at 9:15, with most seating gone by 9:30-9:35. We had a great seat next to Richter Burger on the dock in San Francisco territroy. We faced the Universal water screen that was nearest the transformers 3D ride. We had an excellent view of the screen, the lighted water features, and the fireworks that went off right behind us at Ghiradelli. \\n\\nThe show was one of my favorite parts of the whole day. It was AMAZING. seriously. It had that epic feeling that goes along with a really great movie, and had the soundtrack and special effects to back it up. Definitely worth seeing at least once. \\n\\nOverall, this is a great theme park. It's different because it has a wide range of attractions for all ages and types. It has roller coasters, thrill rides, shows, interactive experiences, 3d motion simulators, and everything in between to suit any type of person. In addition, the prices here were much more affordable than I had budgeted for. A Chicken Strip meal was only $8, Soft Pretzals were 2 for $5, Burgers with Fries were $8, Beer was $6-7.50, A large french fry was $2.50. Having been to other theme parks, I expected to pay a lot more, and I was pleased to see that while items were at premium prices, they weren't outrageous. \\n\\n5 Stars because Universal Studios delivered an excellent experience on all levels.

All of the reviews are accurate about the Shepard's Pie - YUM.  Really beautiful presentation and great flavor.  GET THIS if you go.  I got the sweet potato quesadilla, which was pretty good as well.  A little dry, but the salsa that was with it was amazing.  I had food envy of my husband's Shepard's Pie though and wished I got that.  \\n\\nServers were super nice, forgot our coffee at the end, but all was forgiven after tasting their desserts.  Yum.  We had slices of the pumpkin pie and a chocolate pie and both were delicious!  \\n\\nWhy 4 stars instead of 5?  The bathroom was gross.  For how well they present the food and how nice the servers are, I'm crossing my fingers they read this and use $300 and redo the paint in the bathroom.  And hire a good cleaner to scrub it down.

An authentic  \\"how could I have been missing out on this for so long\\" moment. An authentic, \\"what an amazing discovery\\" moment.  I felt like a goldminer who spotted gold during the California gold rush.  I whispered \\"EUREKA!\\" as I took my second bite, the girl at the counter said: \\"my name is Emily, not Eureka.\\"  I said never mind, I'm just enjoying my pastry. I had to come back for a week straight and get the ricotta filled cannoli with the edges dipped in chocolate. I wanted to try all of the other goodies which were a colorful Festa, but was unable to sway from my usual cannoli.

They are nice enough once they do give you their attention. Even for a pub, something about the place feels heavy, dated, and a little dingy, but I do believe that feeling comes strictly from the decor and lighting, not a true lack of cleanliness.

Load up your car with friends and a cooler full of cold beer and ice (no drinks or beer here) and make the trek South to Driftwood. From central Austin, you're probably looking at a 25-30 minute drive down here, about half of it on scenic two lane roads. Make sure you have a wallet full of cash, because the Salt Lick does things their way and that means no credit cards. (They do have an ATM for those of you who \\"never carry cash\\"). There really isn't a better way to entertain your carnivorous out of town friends. \\n\\nAs you arrive, make sure you hide the beers as they have several sheriffs working the parking lot security. They'll direct you back into the parking area. If you stop to unload your cooler, expect to get yelled at. I tend not to stop because the guys doing the yelling are wearing cowboy hats and have guns.   They also aren't real nice, but I've probably never met a sherriff who was.\\n\\nGet on the waiting list as soon as you walk up and be prepared to chill, usually for a while. This place is absolutely gigantic, so the wait isn't usually longer than 30-60 minutes. On most nights, you can grab a seat up front and enjoy a band while drinking your cold beers.   Repeat often.\\n\\nOnce you get inside, make sure to stop and take a look at the open pit (oohhhhh...apparently the only one in Texas) to get an idea of what you are about to enjoy. Tons of options here, but I always go for the all you can eat option, which includes brisket, sausage, chicken, st louis style ribs, fantastic sides and bread AND some of the best cobbler you'll ever have.

I normally don't eat hot dogs, and am a bit fussy when it comes to my palate and the service that I pay for. That being said I was impressed with MADdogs. \\n\\nThe location is not the best; It is one of those spots where you may drive by and think you want to stop, but because of where it is placed and the difficulty you would acquire in trying to turn around, you will usually keep driving. So, ultimately, you have to plan a trip there.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Upon entering, the decor is open, clean and comfortable.  Red metal chairs add a splash of color and warmth to the general feel of the place, and the tables are free standing, so they easily adjust to people of all sizes.\\n\\nThe menus are already on the tables and we were greeted by a waitress who was not only pleasant, but helpful and informative.  From the moment we walked in, she made us feel like she wanted us there; a quality I find lacking in many restaurants.\\n\\nWhile we ogled the menu, she asked us if we had been there before and when we told her no, then she proceeded to explain how we could choose the type of dog we want, and then we could choose from prefigured toppings or create our own.  She pointed out that they are more than just dogs. On a sales point of view, she could have presented the fact that they a small, but descent selection of local beers, but otherwise did a great job of letting us know what they have to offer.\\n\\nSo here is what we ordered: 2 bacon and gargonzola pork bratwurst from the regular menu, and from the happy hour menu: chili dip and chip, and a tot sampler. The tot sampler was three types of tots, cheese, garlic/mushroom and nacho. For desert, we tried one of the Ruby Jewel ice cream cookie (Lemon and Lavender).\\n\\nThe presentation was beautiful. The plates were clean and they took the effort to arrange them in ways that were eye pleasing. \\n\\nSo, how did they taste? The large bratwurst was clearly a quality meat. It has a little pop to it when you bit into the casing and it was flavorful, without adding tons of salt. The bacon was thick cut and again not over salted. The gorgonzola sauce was slightly salty, as it should be without being excessive and creamy. The cook did a great job at balancing the flavors and not over salting; which tends to be a problem with many processed foods. I would have liked a more flavorful bun, but all in all, it was well done.\\n\\nThe tots were normal tots and by themselves could be seen as bland taste wise, but when combined with one of there toppings, their subtly compliments the flavor. The nacho and cheese tots were to be expected. The garlic/mushroom tots were a little dry and I think a little butter and maybe thyme or basil  would have really pulled it together. We were pleased that they used the garlic freely, many places lose its flavor by not putting enough in. \\n\\nThe chile was good. I found it didn't really pop in my mouth, but it did leave a lingering taste that I can't quite describe right now. It definitely left me wanting more and when combined with the cheesy tot, it was delicious.\\n\\nFinally, the ice cream cookie.  MADdogs prides itself on local sustainability and the company that these little delights come from is local. It was all quality, and if you haven't had a Ruby Jewel ice cream, drop in and have one with cold local beer.  You will be delighted.\\n\\nThe biggest thing MADdogs has going for it, aside from its food, is its service. I can't remember the last time I went to a restaurant and felt like they actually wanted my business.

The seasoning was okay, but I personally wanted more spice, so I added hot sauce.\\n\\n  The menu was small and also contained fried fish, crawfish etouffe, and a few other items like burgers. She provides you many options to help feed the homeless and those in need... something I appreciate when a person is always giving back to her community.\\n\\n  On this day (after the lunch rush) she had no flavored drinks since she ran out of sugar, but she was more than willing to provide a great cold bottle of fresh ice water.

Brisket, ribs, sausage! Cole slaw, potato salad, bread and beans on the side. All wonderful. The cole slaw is vinegar-based so it has a very unique taste. Totally felt like you were hanging out in someone's back yard! The dessert was incredible too! 1/2 berry, 1/2 apple cobbler- a la mode. The crust on it was more like cake then pie- amazing!

Don't let that throw you off...go on in. (-:\\n\\nDECOR - I'd describe it as Japanese luncheonette style...nothing fancy like many local places that are all about show, and not about food. But a quick look at the menu, table condiments and clientele proved we were in a great place. Everything is IMMACULATELY clean. Our server greeted us with a smile and instantly answered questions about menu items.\\n\\nCLIENTELE - During our 90 minute dinner on a Saturday night it was clear that this is a local place with a strong Asian following. There were no tourists. Of the few Westerners who came, most were with Asian spouses/friends. The majority of people coming in seemed to be in on the secret, greeting servers and the sushi chef as regulars.\\n\\nFOOD - Aki served some of the best, most authentic Japanese food I've had in the US at very fair prices. I've been eating Japanese food around the world since 1972...yeah, I'm old but I've learned a few things along the way.

Fresh and wonderful.\\n\\nThe crowning touch was the uni sushi! So wonderful we had 6 pieces.

Not here!)\\n\\nAdd in red bean ice cream and green tea moshi for dessert...with 2 large sakes and one 16oz Sapporo beer...\\n\\nCOST - All this was only $90 with quick (really quick) friendly (very friendly) service throughout  our meal.\\n\\nIt's funny but in talking with our server she confided that she comes in to eat her on her days off!

Sadly, it seems as if all of the effort has gone into the design, and not enough into the kitchen.   Personally, I think the decor is too trendy for the menu, which is basic diner food.  Now, I love me some diner food, but if you're going to serve it in an upscale atmosphere, it had better be a damned sight better than your average burger joint.\\n\\nOur server highly recommended the fried goat cheese.  It was bland and came with some slightly tough French bread that had been heated up on the grill.  The tomato concasse was a big lump of tasteless tomato mash, and the entire plate would have benefited from a little salt.  A brush of oil on the bread would have helped as well.  We also ordered some wings, and, while they were good, they weren't any better than your average wing joint.\\n\\nWe all ordered burgers, and our server asked how we wanted them cooked.  We asked for mid-rare, but the burgers that came to the table were well done and charred, as another reviewer has said.  Again, the buns were nothing special, and would have benefited from a brush of oil and a little toasting.  The garlic fries were fine, but nothing to write home about.  \\n\\nI liked very much that they present cotton candy with the check; it's a cute touch.  It would be a big help to both the servers and the customers if it came with something to hold it, though, to save the server the awkwardness of standing there trying to hand the thing to someone.\\n\\nService was good, if a little inexperienced, but that's to be expected in a new place.  Everyone with whom we came in contact was helpful and very pleasant, and our server was very good.\\n\\nThe only service glitch was on our way out.  We decided to take home a pastry for later.   As we were paying, the host asked us  ''Do you want your change?''   Seriously?  I always tip on to go food, but a last minute purchase of a dessert item to go?  I thought it was tactless and rude, and it ended our experience on a bad note.  \\n\\nI really had high hopes for Bananas, and I hope that they get the kitchen running up to the standards of The Monkey.

Before I get too mushy on you, let me just say the sexy wading pool in the basement of the Crystal Hotel is worthy of a solo half hour visit. What makes it sexy? The dark lighting, the glow of the pool, the fact that alcohol is permitted in a plastic cup, the waterfall at the head of the pool and the Asian-esque vibe created by the bamboo walls. Pray to the pool gods that you are the only down there - that's when true peaceful perfection is reached. (On my past two visits to this hotel, I have hit up the pool before bed and as soon as I woke in the morning). \\n\\nFor those who are not jumping out of their pants from after reading about a sexy basement pool - maybe the great location with prime walkability and clever music-themed rooms will do the trick? Or, how about the fact that the prettiest Whole Foods I've ever visited is across the street and two blocks away you'll find Blue Star Donuts and their ridiculously good bourbon blueberry basil donut? (Yes, that's right, I said Blue Star and not Voodoo - good catch, reader). There is a charm about this hotel that you will not find at the Hyatt, Holiday Inn or Westin. If you feel like experiencing the charm on more of a shoestring, opt for the shared bath rooms (I never had to wait when I took this route on my first visit).\\n\\nI'm holding off on the 5th star due to the paper-thin walls and ungodly loud trash activity that occurs on the street every morning I have stayed there.

I so very much want to give it 5 stars, but there are some serious issues that make it not get a 5 star rating.  Mind you, I go here EVERY TIME I am in Boston for more than 3 hours BECAUSE IT IS THAT AMAZING.  It's just that the issues make it not be that great.\\n\\nThis is a hybrid bookstore/cafe.  It's great for perusing while you wait for a table, and to find some neat things.  Think of if Newbury Comics was a bookstore, and that's what you have here.  There are cute gadgets and fun things, MBTA souvenirs, and a great book selection as well.\\n\\nWhen you walk in, the area to put your name in for a reservation is very cramped, and there isn't a lot of waiting area.  That's what the bookstore is for, I suppose.  Everything is done electronically for waiting for a table.  It's pretty neat, you get a text message you respond to when your table is ready.  The only thing that stinks is... what if you don't have a phone?\\n\\nThe actual dining room area is VERY cramped.  Every available space is used, to the extent of there being not enough room.  My friend and I were basically smooshed into a window seat, where there were 3 tables.  Space was only really good for 2.  It's pretty uncomfortable.\\n\\nAs far as the service, it's not that great.  You've got hipsters who don't want to be there, and they're pretty pushy to get you out the door.  They also use tablets to place your order, and you pay with their tablet as well.  It's quite awkward, especially if you need a receipt.  I've never paid that way before, and was kind of flabbergasted... and the waiter didn't really understand that.  I feel like an old geezer now at age 26, haha.  The ticket from the kitchen was also on my plate when I got my plate... kind of gross and wet... ew.\\n\\nWhat makes Trident still deserve 4 stars is the food.  I would not give Trident a 4 star review if it wasn't for the food.\\nI can not shut up about the food.\\nI will never shut up about the food.\\n\\nHash and eggs.  Always get the hash and eggs.  It is delicious.\\nImagine a boiled dinner (corned beef, carrots, potatoes, celery, garlic) made into a hash.  The fat is still on the corned beef pieces, and the carrots were cooked together with the corned beef, so all the delicious spices are there. It is the best ever.  I can not shut up about it. \\n\\nIf you're looking for a beer while you're here, (haha that rhymes) they always offer a great brew.  They also try to offer a local offering, which is nice.\\n\\nThey also offer smoothies and juices if that's your thing, and you can always hear the juicer/blender going off in the background.\\n\\nAll in all, I wish the service and atmosphere was better at Trident, and there would be a 3 star rating normally, but....

The taste burnt and they last about 5 minutes till you just say forget it. I had the crab cakes and calamari the first time and they were amazing despite it took forever to get the food, the next time I had the tacos ... (not their specialty at all) today I just came for a drink and some hookah. The drinks are weak and not well thought of.. the mixtures are horrible. Everything is over priced here... everything and I wouldn't mind so much about the price if everything else was on point. Every bartender I've encountered here has been rude. The girl today with the red hombre weave pulled back in a ponytail was horrible !!! She was talking to me from across the room not even looking at me, just cutting her fruit for her horrible drinks that she was about to send out. Then when I asked to speak with a manger she laughed like oh well. I see why she laughed because the manager wouldn't come out at all. The specials on the instagram falsely advertised and the manager didn't care, oh get this the female owner (I believe her name was snoop) was there too and didn't care either. They were in the back counting money. Which is ironic because without your customers you would have none to count. But in any case for the price I paid for bad service half decent food and horrible drinks it definitely wasn't worth it. It was pretty on the inside though.

No matter the weather (such as a rainy, grey day like today), it still feels bright and cheerful.  The bigger, newer space also means they can accommodate larger groups than the previous space.\\n2) great lattes; don't know how they do it, but the lattes are wonderful every time, without exception.\\n\\nDrawbacks:\\n1) the service is really hit and miss.  I find how enjoyable my experience at Chambar is depends on the server and how experienced they are.  The experienced ones know the menu and can guide you to what you will most likely enjoy.  The inexperienced ones don't seem to know the menu, or what the food is.  Today we went for brunch and I explained to the waiter that I wanted a bigger plate, with more volume of food, but didn't eat pork.  He suggests to me the Bon Matin.  This is one of the plates I hadn't tried so far, and I read the ingredients: everything seemed great and no mention of pork/ham/prosciutto.  The plate comes and it was so little food I almost cried: one piece of bread cut in half; one egg; a dollop of avocado; a dollop of olive tapenade; a small slice of brie cheese and a pile of prosciutto! Sorry what?!  This was the bigger plate without pork?!  By all accounts, in any restaurant, that plate would be a starter/appetizer: it wouldn't be an entree.  I checked the menu again and no mention of prosciutto/ham - it does say \\"lomo\\" as an item on the plate, but for those not in the food business, how are you exactly supposed to know what this is, when clearly even the waiter doesn't know?!  What is wrong with using plain language in a menu to avoid confusion like this.\\n\\nAt no point did our server drop by to ask how our food was or check in with us; the food was brought by other servers and our water glasses were refilled by someone else so there was no way to communicate to our server that my meal wasn't what I expected.  Our plates were also cleared away by other staff.  We asked for our bill and when he came to drop off the bill, asked me how the food was and I just said that it wasn't a lot of food.  He asked if I wanted something else to eat?  Honestly, 1.5 hours later, table cleared, and everyone just looking to pay their bill wasn't a time I was going to order more food.\\n\\nThis leads me to the next point:\\n\\n2) inconsistent menu: The menu is so all over the place when it gets to value and description.  They are a busy restaurant; their staff are clearly strapped for time.  Perhaps rather than create a situation where patrons have to review the menu with a server that needs to get to other things, the menu items can be better explained.  Why not divide into sections like \\"small plates\\"; \\"vegetarian friendly\\", \\"big breakfast\\"?  That way you can have patrons that are more fully informed.  I sometimes get great dishes at Chambar and sometimes, like today, I leave starving because I have no way of knowing what something means on the menu. And frankly, there is nothing more disappointing than leaving a place after having spent $25 for breakfast, still hungry and needing to go home to eat a bowl of cereal.\\n\\nAnd for the record, I'm 5'1\\" and about 105 lbs, so if I leave starving, I can't imagine how the menu would bode well for a larger person with a bigger appetite."},{"name":"Promise Land Cafe","address":"3513 NE Martin Luther King Jr Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"If you like middle eastern cuisine you will love the food here.

However, apparently when I asked the bartender for Redemption Rye with a few ice chips (I'm a whiskey girl!), he couldn't hear me (it was generally loud) and he proceeded to ask me if I asked for Grey Goose.  This slight may not be apparent and may even be non-existent to others; however, in my opinion, it is a perfect example of the \\"new\\" and subtle way in which stereotypes based on race are perpetuated in American society today. Though it was loud in the bar, Redemption Rye sounds nothing like Grey Goose Vodka. My own intuition led me to believe (that after the bartender took longer than I would have reasonably liked to approach my friend and me in regards to service) that he was now projecting his own stereotypic views on what I must have been attempting to order based on my race (as Grey Goose in the past has been a spirit that has been embraced by and associated with African Americans). In case it is not clear, this situation would be parallel to me walking into a wine bar and the bartender asking me if I would like a glass of Moscato (in which though it is a dessert wine and is not one that I drink, it is typically associated with African Americans). I would like to be clear that there is nothing wrong with preferring Grey Goose or drinking Moscato; however, I would not like my preferences to be judged by others based on my race, particularly not by my bartenders.  \\n\\nThis past experience was not enough to deter me from returning to this bar (as I like the atmosphere, food and drink selection); however, my experience this weekend was the proverbial nail in the coffin.\\n\\nb) I came in with a friend this past weekend and once again sat at the bar. Like the last time, it was busy. My friend and I decided to sit in a spot at the bar that had just been vacated and thus had not yet been cleaned (i.e.  the left-overs of the last person's arugula salad, dirty napkins, silverware and multiple beer glasses were still in place). I am a patient person and observed that the bartenders were indeed busy so I expected that they would \\"get to me\\" in due time. However, I found it upsetting that the bartender not only acknowledged but also decided to take another party's drink orders (a party who came in after we arrived). He also made their entire drink order without acknowledging the presence of my friend or me. I literally had to wave the bartender down to ask if he could clean our area. Later during our dining experience, I observed as the same bartender asked the party to the left and the right of me if they \\"were doing okay or if they needed anything\\" but yet my party was never asked if we were okay. The final straw occurred when I asked for a second drink to accompany my meal (with a different bartender) and I observed said second bartender making the drink orders of TWO different parties (who ordered after me). It was a clear situation of \\"prioritizing\\" and I dare not say what the priority was based on.  I swiftly cancelled my second drink order and my friend and I requested to \\"close-out\\". \\n\\nAgain, in the past I have been a huge fan of the Porter (granted there were different bartenders working there at the time); however, I am not one to tolerate such subtle yet monumental slights (whether committed consciously or subconsciously. \\n       \\nI will not be returning. \\n\\nP.s.\\n\\nTo my knowledge there are only 3 bartenders currently working with regularity at the Porter. One of them has solid black ear-stretching devices in both ears.  I feel it important to point out that he was NOT involved in either situation in which I was unhappy or experienced sub-par service.

Front staff service isn't the most friendly to be honest... I think they expect that we know the process already, but instead, the group of us stood there dumbfounded for a few seconds before we figure out how it all works.  Once we did, here's what we tried\\n\\nMargherita DOP:  A standard amongst Neapolitan places, the margherita was simple, tasty, and light on basil as most traditional places are.  \\n\\nSan Gennaro:  WOW.  This was the clear winner of the party.  The sweet red peppers and cipolline brought us a perfect flavor that everyone at the table loved, and the slight saltiness of the sausage.  Get this one.  \\n\\nPomodorini:  Sweet little cherry tomatoes roasted lightly in the oven.  Very good stuff, but if you're looking for that sweet tang, go with the San Gennaro instead.  \\n\\nNapoletana:  Nice flavors, with crisped up broccoli rabe that was practically baked kale tasting, this was good.  Others at the table were not a fan of the crisped rabe.  Do you like kale chips?  If yes, you'll like this.  If no, stay away.\\n\\nOverall, the pies were SUPER fast to deliver (that's what happens when you have three ovens running nice and hot and 1:30 bakes per oven).  The inside of the house is fun to sit and watch pizza theater as they work the dough and make the pies.  The pies themselves are a bit thick against what we tried in Naples, but it's pretty close in terms of flavors overall.\\n\\nOne of the best bonuses is that they have lots of condiments to add to your pizza if you want a bit of extra flavor.  Need some sauce for dipping?  Ask your waiter/waitress.  Want some spicy kick?  There's crushed calabrian peppers, whole calabrian peppers, and red pepper flakes along with black pepper and salt available to you.  It's pretty cool that you can get calabrian peppers here... something I haven't seen at any other pizza place.\\n\\nVerdict:  One of the best in the US?  The experience definitely so.  Worth checking out?  Absolutely if you're a pizza fan.  Comparable to Naples?  Not quite the real thing... but damn close.  The price is definitely on the high side, but I'd likely come back with friends."},{"name":"Polonia","address":"750 S US Hwy 17-92","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our lunch.

Where to even start? Well let's start at the water so this place told my wife that they do not provide water that we had to buy bottled water to consume. We basically had to drag a waiter to take our order, my wife and I ordered the Red Snapper, my sister in-law and her husband ordered chicken milanesa and some shrimp dish. We got our fish and it came sizzling hot I could not even touch it; it came on a fajita skillet which I thought it was odd especially at that temperature. I proceeded to cut into my fish and it was fried to a crisp. The fish could have been a week old or caught a few minutes ago I could not tell due to it being drastically overcooked. They might as well serve me canned tuna, any seasoning or flavor from the fish was burn in the overcooking process. A couple of guys sitting next to us also got their food at the same relative time we got ours and one of the guys sent it back because it was cold, they took the food for a couple of minutes and brought it straight back. I guess they popped it in the microwave to give it a quick heat. My sister in-law's food did not come an hour later they got restless and left.

I read that this was the best Italian place in Boston, and I love me some Italian food. I went in with high expectations, and though they were not fully met, it was still a good experience, enough to warrant 4 stars.\\n\\nThe wait here is supposedly really long, so we dropped my brother off at the restaurant to get on the waiting list while we drove around to look for parking.

No wait, hooray!\\n\\nThe staff was super nice but the pace here is quick. It's not a restaurant where you sit around and chat over dessert and coffee in the end, more of an order, eat, out kind of place. And since the place is tiny and they have a large line, it makes sense. We ordered the calamari appetizer, the butternut squash ravioli, and seafood spinach fettuccine to share. The calamari was good, though it got a bit too salty for me towards the end, and I could have done without the jalapenos that were also fried and served with the calamari. I felt like it was more of a filler and felt slightly jipped of calamari :(. The ravioli was absolutely fabulous, the pasta had a great bite and the butternut squash was sweet. I loved that there was asparagus included in it and the sauce was creamy and rich. Definitely a dish to get there every time, I could see why it was a favorite amongst yelpers. The seafood spinach fettuccine was a mixed bag for me though. I LOVED how fresh the seafood was, the salmon was amazing, cooked perfectly. The spinach and sundried tomatoes it was cooked with gave great flavor and I loved the sauce. What I did not love, however, was the fettuccine itself. The pasta was overcooked and not salted enough when boiled. That was quite a letdown for me since I love pasta so much. But that was really the only major complaint I had about the meal. Well, that and the jalapenos in my calamari. \\n\\nOverall, it is a solid Italian restaurant.

We waited for about 5 minutes after we were clearly done with the food for the bill to arrive and then another 5 to 10 minutes after that for it to be processed.

At Sushi House, they use the softer, mushier kind that I don't like as much. The Alaska roll was essentially a California roll with a piece of salmon rolled inside, it was average. The JB roll was salmon, cucumber and cream cheese - I'm usually a sucker for rolls with cream cheese but the one at Sushi House came below average .. it just didn't have enough cream cheese inside. The Kaide roll was salmon, crab meat, ikura and cucumber inside with tobiko all round. I expected the roll to have a sauce and seared like their picture on the menu, but the roll ended up just being drizzled with mayo and barely seared. It was underwhelming but still enjoyable cause I personally love tobiko.

Texture and the honey and cracked pepper were perfect additions to it. I ordered the bacon wrapped pork with the cherry-plum sauce, green beans, and the butter poached new potatoes. It. Was. Amazing. I can not say enough good things about how it was! The pork was tender, and cooked a beautiful medium. The green beans still had the perfect amount of bit to them, and I could eat those potatoes forever.

When you step into a beautiful place like this, grab the window seat, which plants you in a sort of nostalgic Bostonian fantasy, scanning cobblestone streets and Polcari's coffee and spice shop across the street; you're all ready for your unique slice of Boston styled new/old world charm, the reason why we suffer the T or painstakingly ask our most patient girlfriend to stakeout parking in this beautiful neighborhood--this vibrant place where locals and drunks hob knob and do laundry next to college kids clad in anatomy-emphasizing legware. It's beautiful, it's unique, it's American in the best sense of the word...and then, you realize you should have just had pizza. This place was incredibly disappointing.\\n   As usual, the antipasti spread hits all of the right notes--not refined like its Uppity South End cousins, but bolder and piled higher: smoked Gorgonzola, drunken goat cheese, piles of folded prosciutto and other cured heaps of pig, as well as some roasted pepper caponata and braids of buffalo mozzarella, some castelveltrano olives, and some decent (if a bit too firm) anchovies. But after that, things always seem to go down hill. The wines did not blow me away, for those prices. And though I'm dropping bills like a damn fool, I won't wince at the price tag and give away my proletarian...persuasion....But here's where I would like to take a dump on the culinary world: Now, would you rather an inventive take on bolognese sauce, gussied up with some morrocan Harissa (whatever they meant by that was indistinguishable), or do you just want a well-balanced, refined bolognese: rich, creamy, meaty, with just a hint of sweet and sour, courtesy of tomato paste. For me, it's the latter, rib sticking, indulgent but refined Emilan classic. But here, it was a sorta spicy pasta meat thing. And the same problem plagued the special risotto: the more ingredients they'd listed, the fewer seemed to emerge on the fork. Ramps--sure, truffles--ok, porcini--alright but we're getting into over-saturation territory--AND shaved hard cheese. CAPS LOCK. My companion couldn't finish it, but it sounded like an overindulgent night mare to me. But the shellfish with angel hair pasta was by far the worst thing I've ever eaten in the North End, perhaps in an Italian restaurant anywhere, even \\"Papa Tony's Generico Red Sauce 10lbs. of Chicken Pahhhhm Hole-in-the-burbs\\" joints across Massachusetts. It sucked. It tasted like a can of effin' Chef Boyardee, and I may be an ash hole, but I am not exaggerating this time. It was crapola. Crappone? I dunno, ho dimenticato cosa vuol dire. Anyways, skip this place. Go to one of those places with worse views and less handsome waiters. Better yet, forget Zagat & Yelp, forget this review, and just find some random spot with old people in it. Better yet, forget dining out for a few months, save your money, go to Italy, eat street food like porchetta off of a truck, eat pasta at a bar, drink the amazing table wine.

Personally, I only come here for two things: the pork ribs and the sausage.

I've celebrated my birthday at this restaurant twice in the past 7 years and I have often brought my family and friends to what was my favorite restaurant in Vancouver - for birthdays or special occasions, pre/post hockey games, and all the \\"just because\\" times over the past 10+ years. Sunday night's visit was very different. \\n\\nOur group of 10 people were seated promptly on the evening of December 18th and our server was friendly, the atmosphere was great, drinks were on point, but the timing and overall service of everything was very very \\"off\\". \\n\\nFrom the time we were seated to the point we finally placed our dinner orders - 45-50 minutes. Our drinks came out soon after we ordered (10 minutes after being seated) but our server never returned to take our main course orders after she said she'd be back in a minute to do so. Once we did place our orders, (~10 minutes after we last got our drinks or even saw her), the waiting continued. \\n\\nFrom the time we were seated until our appetizer came: ~ 1 hour and 30 minutes. From the time we were seated until our main course came ~ 1 hour and 55 minutes. Table touch/follow up - less than a minute after we received our appetizers... I personally didn't even have a chance to taste my appy before I was asked how it was and then no one came back to ask how our food was for the remainder of the night, or if we needed more drinks or water or to service our table in any way. I guess because we were going to get charged an Auto-Gratuity of 18% we didn't deserve to have their usual upbeat, attentative, outstanding service. We even had to flag someone down to pack some items and for our bill - which was at least 15 minutes after we all finished our food and because NO ONE had come by to check up on us. At about 2 hours and 45 minutes after being seated, we finally got our bill and our packed food. \\n\\nThe server was decently pleasant in our dealings but it seemed as though she was caught up with something else. There was a private party downstairs and there were two small tables in our immediate area that were seated (a 2 and a 4 top). The main dining area in the back didn't seem overly busy and the bar area was empty on this snowy Sunday evening between 745-1045pm. I can understand that dealing with a larger group could be stressful but don't depend on auto-gratuity being included to dictate for the level of service (or lack thereof) to provide.  \\n\\nOn top of it all, I was cut off by members of staff each time I went to/from the washroom. I was neither acknowledged nor was I given the right of way in any of the 4 instances that this happened. I never hesitate to let someone go first or ahead of me and I'm very clear on communication but I literally had to stop otherwise I would have bumped into the staff - or they into me - on each of my visits to/from the washroom. I felt as though the staff were in such a rush that they would cut in front of me to get to where they were going and there wasn't any bit of acknowledgement from staff as I walked by. BUT it wasn't even busy!\\n\\nBeing in the service industry I can understand that this may be a one off type of situation but the most annoying part of it all was the lack of service and not feeling welcome to this restaurant.\\n\\nUPDATE: Edwyn, the General Manager at Chambar, reached out to me in reply to my e-mail to them regarding above issues and was prompt and professional in reconciling the situation for our whole group. I am impressed with the manner in which he carried out in the apologies and remuneration and I am sure I will be back to Chambar again in the near future.

The colors, presentation, and taste of everything from the selections of terrines and pates to the mushroom ragout were stunning.  My partner and I each had the Pork Three Ways and I am now a devotee of the porcine world.  The waiter helped me select a wine and it was perfect (and reasonable).

What's better than great Italian food with seafood involved?  Hmm, I couldn't come up with anything on a Sunday evening but to try out Giacomo's which was recommended by my Bostonian friends.  \\n\\nAfter browsing through a laminated 2-sided menu and also a hand-written daily special card... (Mind you the penmanship was beautiful.)  My boyfriend and I decided on the most expensive thing on the menu, the seafood pasta dish for 2.  With a bottle of wine only costed us $65 + tax and tip!  What a great deal!!  Especially in Boston...  Our waitress came around before our dish arrived and said, \\"OK guys, this is how we're going to do this....\\"  while rearranged our table to her liking.  The tiny little room was filled with customer, almost no room to sneeze.  \\n\\nThe dish has a full lobster, clams, calamari, squid, shrimps and generous portion of mussels and of course, linguini.  We went with the Giacomo's sauce, which is a house marinara with b√©chamel cream.  I think the portion is well enough for 4 but we killed it!  We had some pasta leftover but overall we couldn't stop eating. \\n\\nI have been to a lot of Italian pasta places but I would say right now this one tops it all for seafood!  I dreamt about it for days...\\n\\nP.S. - Quite a wait if you go on a busy time during the week, we waited about 45 mins before we were seated, but it was well worth my time standing in the chilly, misty New England fall weather."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I was invited here for breakfast with a couple of local Back Bay residents. I'm glad I went. You may be thinking, \\"How can a bookstore and a restaurant coexist in one storefront?\\" As evidence that it can and does happen to the delight of the locals, I give you Trident Books. \\n\\nThere are about a half-dozen tables outside, another two (3?) dozen on the first floor, and two dozen more on the top floor. Almost all the tables are small (good for not more than 4 seats, often less, but that scale lends to the intimate yet trendy, hipster, and vibrant atmosphere of the establishment. When we were there (Sunday morning at 10) the place was literally packed. Between the people who came to eat, those who came to read, and those who came to do both, there were probably close to 80 people inside. Even with two floors, that was a lot! \\n\\nAlthough it did take a while for our food to arrive, the huge plates piled high with tasty treats were worth the wait. I was not, if I'm honest, a fan of the corned beef hash (it was very watery, lacked flavor, and was not actually hash), but the rest of my meal was delicious. It seemed from the smiles all over the room that Trident's kitchen is particularly good at breakfast staples - and everybody in there knows it!\\n\\nTo those who are disappointed by the magazine selection, I can only ask where you could've possibly seen more. My guess is there had to be at least 500 magazine titles for sale. Literally the entire first floor where there wasn't seating for the restaurant. I didn't get a chance to wade through the crowd to look at the motorsports section (my section), but I'm sure I would've found obscure magazines rarely available in the United States. \\n\\nThe book selection, I admit, has been tucked into the remaining corners of the restaurant around the magazines, and it shows. Although there did seem to be an eclectic variety of unusual books, my cursory glance did not land on anything in book form that piqued my interest. My wife, a much more artistic person than I, would surely disagree. \\n\\nI noticed that the patrons in this restaurant tended to be young couples and families in their 20s. The dress is casual but stylish, and the chatter is loud and continuous. Without a doubt, this was the hippest, most vibrant bookstore I'd ever been into. If you are looking for a fun place to grab a meal and a unique magazine with your friends, I definitely recommend Trident."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My sister and I went to the Salty Pig for brunch yesterday, both of our first times for brunch there.  It was a hot day in Boston and they have outdoor seating with no umbrellas.  It was about 1pm and the sun was blocked by the building and I asked the hostess if the sun starts to move over and will be on us outside and she said she didn't know if it gets sun or not.  I thought that was odd.  Maybe it was her first time working outside.  Well, the sun did move and we were in the spotlight of it.  My sister had sunburn and without that is so white, it's almost blinding.  I was looking to prevent more sun on her.  Granted, we did also stay until 2:30.\\n\\nThe service was slow in getting going but we also were talking, so perhaps they saw that.  When the server came over, who basically had no personality or affect, my sister asked what vegatables were in the fritata that clearly stated they got their veggies from the weekly farmer's market.  He said he did not know and stood there.  He then asked if she wanted him to check on that.  Uhm, yes please.  He came back, he told her, she ordered it (and picked out the peas).  That was served with a slice of thick bread.  \\n\\nI had the pork belly hash, which came with 2 fried eggs and bacon braised greens.  An english muffin, which was not listed, was also included but unbuttered and no other condiments offered.  Odd, but I didn't plan to eat it, so didn't bother asking what was supposed to come with it.  The hash was like a large, round crab cake in appearance.  It was quite good but not sure I tasted much pork belly.  I guess I thought there would be pieces of it.  The small portions of greens had a few pieces of undercooked bacon.  I don't like my bacon that way but my boyfriend would've scarfed it down, so just a matter of taste.\\n\\nWe also started the meal with a small charchuterie. We chose prosciutto de parma, one of the cheeses (I forget which one) and jalapeno jelly.  When it came out on the cheeseboard (nice presentation), it also has a small tin of pickles, stoneground mustard and 4-5 crostinis.  To be honest, we weren't super hungry b/c of the heat and could've been satisfied with just this.  The meat and cheese were great.  There definitely was a lot more meat than cheese, but I come from a family of dairy farmers, so I may be slightly ridiculous in my cheese portions!  We both agreed that the jalepeno jelly wasn't spicy and actually didn't have a ton of flavor, so we just used the mustard, which was really good.\\n\\nI have been to the Salty Pig before and enjoy their beer menu and charchuterie but have never had anything but that.  The service has always been very good.  I felt that the server and the hostess were the \\"B\\" team or had just been hired.  Our waiter actually left for the day without saying anything (even though we were done and he could've given us the check or cleared the plates).

First off, I'm from Texas and visited Giacomo's in September of 2013. My boss recommended the place with the warning that we'd probably have to wait but it's so worth it that even our VP will wait in line. He was absolutely right!\\n\\nTwo of my friends and I got there around 7 and waited in a line of about 12 people. Dinner here was on the \\"to do\\" list for Boston so we weren't going to give up on waiting. We met a really nice couple that were standing in line in front of us. They are locals and regulars at Giacomo's. Talking to them made waiting in line much more bearable. We probably waited for a little over and hour before we were seated. \\n\\nSo when you first see the menu, it looks a little plain. Don't let this deter you! We got the calamari first and it was perfectly fried. Not too oily and very lightly battered in a good way. I got the shrimp and scallop linguine with the Giacomo's sauce. The pasta was almost a little too al dente for me but over the course of the meal, I got over it and really ended up liking it. The plate was so big but I couldn't stop eating it and, before I knew it, I was done!\\n\\nYou can really tell that the waitresses here are accustomed to the rush and know how to work in a very efficient manner. It makes it so that the service doesn't seem to be as much of an issue like at other places.\\n\\nSUPER TIP:\\n\\nDon't come here by yourself if you really want to be by yourself. A couple in front of my friends and I in line were very observant and noticed that two people that were previously standing in line were seated together but didn't seem to know each other when they were standing in line. The couple were regulars so they said would ask the lady that sat the people at the table about it. \\n\\nThe most awesome part: the waitress, Rose, said that she does it often for single people that come to fill tables. She said she hopes that people she pairs up will one say get together.

We had an 8:15 reservation but still had to wait about 20 minutes. While you're waiting, you can take a look at their gift shop. You'll find the same exact souvenirs as you would in Ireland (but marked up 100% of course). There's plenty of seating but the place gets really packed so you would deffo need a reservation. That being said, it isn't really reminiscent of an Irish pub, since Irish pubs are supposed to be small, cozy, and quaint. But then again, let's not forget that this is Disney and they do have to accommodate to all the tourists. \\n\\nOnto the food! They give you brown bread that comes with this sweet glaze dipping sauce. I'm not a huge fan of brown bread, but that glaze has definitely turned me into one. \\n\\nFor my entree, I went with the mighty mixed grill (lamb chop, Guinness banger, sirloin steak, black pudding, chicken drumstick, bacon, and mashed potatoes). The lamb chop was a little gamey, the steak was a tad overcooked, but the rest was pretty good. Also, if you have the Disney dining plan, this entree would be worth it.\\n\\nFor drinks, I had the Raglan Road stout. It was just alright. It had this burnt note that madeit taste darker and less smooth than a Guinness. It was only after I had ordered the stout that I saw the beer flight of Irish beers and wish I had gotten that. \\n\\nFinally, for dessert, I had the bread pudding. The taste was good but I didn't like that it had raisins in it. Plus the portion is HUGE. I was already stuffed after my entree so it was a little difficult to stomach carbs after that. \\n\\nDespite being really busy, the service was still pretty good.

However I was disappointed. Note that I did take-out - nevertheless this is not reason to be less critical of the food quality, etc. I ordered the Sea Vegetable Salad, Belgian Sweet Potato Fries, and The Detox juice. \\n\\nThe Sea Vegetable Salad did not come with any dressing. I realized after getting home from picking-up that there were dressing choices listed in the menu. It would've been nice if the hostess asked what dressing I wanted which would've made me realize that I needed to pick one. I had expected the salad to already be paired with a dressing, but it wasn't, so I ended up with plain veggies/seaweed - which definitely needed dressing to give it flavor.\\n\\nThe Belgian Sweet Potato Fries were okay. They are thickly cut which is different that most restaurants. One if the reviews said that this was the best sweet potato fries he/she had in MA. I don't think so. Taste-wise not so different than any other restaurant. Was not crisp - but that could be due to me doing take-out. So it was soft/soggy, which may actually have been a good thing since the fries looked burnt, so the moisture helped to soften the evidently over-crisped edges. Look at the picture - there's many black charred edges.\\n\\nThe Detox juice was the best part. It was a bit spicy from the ginger, which I liked. \\n\\nI had walked out the restaurant with my bagged order but realized they never handed me my drink. I went back and told the waiter and he had to look up my order to check that I had ordered a drink. They promptly juiced it out in the kitchen - 2 mins - and then this time actually leave with my full order.\\n\\nThe restaurant was empty except for a couple sitting by the window. It was around 3pm on a Saturday."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"This time we found the road (slightly) more travelled from Austin to the Salt Lick, which greatly removed the anxiety factor.

When we got there around 7:30, the line was already long; however it only took 30 minutes or so to be seated. Since the restaurant is about 20 feet x 40 feet, we were actually seated next to another party (we were a party of 3) However, as cramped as it may seem, the close atmosphere to other people makes it easy to spark conversation and get to know people. \\n\\nI ordered ziti with  shrimp, scallops, and broccoli with a garlic cream sauce. It was a fabulous dish. The garlic cream sauce was very flavorful and smooth with a consistency that wasn't overly liquid and not too viscous. The shrimp and scallops on my plate were enormous. I've never received bigger chunks of scallops in any restaurant I've ever been to and they were plentiful. The jumbo shrimp are well prepared with tails cut off to make eating them easier as well. I was very satisfied with my dish overall and service was great. I only wish i could have had dessert but their menu excludes desserts.\\n\\nMost people were dressed casually from what I observed and with good reason since it did get a bit warm. As of 9/9/15 , they ONLY ACCEPT CASH. However, there is an ATM across the street just in case.\\n\\nI'd definitely return if I had the chance to try out their other dishes.

Their boxes make the pizza look pretty big for the price. A nice idea and eating one whole pizza won't make you feel like a glutton.\\n\\nThe cons:  Buffalo chicken tasted like canned chicken, very little canned buffalo chicken on the pizza. Sausage was tastless with just no flavor and it tasted like just ground meat.  Ham is so tiny and gives no taste as well. The red sauce had an odd taste maybe a little sugar in it.  The pizza inside the box take up only a little over half the box.  Super thin crust (could be a positive for some). Slow service. \\n\\nOverall I would say no way to this place and skip it.

I have been a chef for almost 12 years, so my expectations were always high and were always met. Except for this last visit, where i left somewhat saddened by the experience.  My biggest disapointment was the change in the menu. I am all for changing menu items constantly, but this change was not what i expected. Being of Spanish ancestry (3rd generation) and growing up with Spanish dishes at home, seeing such a heavy Arab influence on the menu was kind of a punch in the gut.  If any one knows anything of history, the moors had invaded Spain for over 500 years.  So to me this felt like a mini re invasion.  Seeing this change in the menu stabbed a that flaming pride of \\"Iberianism\\" that i so enjoyed from eating at Barcelona.

While the shuffleboard was fun and there was plenty of room in which to move around, pretty much everything else about my experience there left something to be desired.  We ate dinner at Blitz because the nearby restaurant where we originally wanted to dine had almost a two hour wait.  Maybe it was my own fault to assume I could find something tasty and veg on a sports bar menu, but I gave the black bean burger a shot...and was horribly disappointed.  Firstly, it was obviously just a frozen patty from a Boca box instead of being anything homemade...which I understand, because a lot of bars in Portland just have frozen veggie patties laying around for when a vegetarian gets hungry while drinking.  They aren't claiming to be \\"veggie-friendly\\", so I guess I couldn't expect much...but, honestly, it was the worst burger I have ever tasted in my life.  It was incredibly dry, which non-meat burgers have a tendency to be since they don't contain juicy animal fat, but that patty didn't even have oil brushed on it. They obviously had no idea how to cook it.  It looked like a rock that had been baking in the hot desert sun, not something edible.  No amount of mustard, ketchup, or pickle spears could save that disaster.  I am just glad the tater tots were crispy and hot, or else I would have been a very hungry lady.\\nTwo other reasons Blitz Ladd disappointed me and the other members of the party: overpriced beverages and chaotic service.  One of the people who arrived later to the bar ordered food...but it never arrived, even after asking two different servers what happened to the order.  My friend ended up just leaving and going to eat at home after waiting almost two hours without a word on her food.  Even though the servers were friendly, service in general was unreliable. They just seemed really, really busy and the setup of which server covered which sections seemed disorganized.  Maybe they were just understaffed that night. \\n\\nOne more strange thing, though the shuffleboard tables they have there are fun and quite nice/modern looking (plus bigger than most bars), be careful with the shuffleboard \\"sand\\" if you have sensitive skin.  After picking it up to sprinkle on the table, three of us broke out into really itchy rashes. I believe their sand is made from silicone, which none of us knew would cause that kind of reaction with our skin.

Yes there was a line, but because we were only two we were able to jump the queue and get a table within about 20 minutes. So coming with a large group could be problematic. \\nAs with the general consensus of the other reviews, the overall experience felt a bit rushed. The service was ok but sensed some disinterest and even arrogance. I got the homemade fussili with lobster, shrimp and giacomo sauce. The sauce was nice, fresh and flavorsome, but the pasta was severely undercooked. Normally I wouldn't mind if it was a bit firmer than al dente as I'm not usually one to make a fuss, but this was hard. Bordering on raw. I proceeded to inform the waiter quite reluctantly that it was undercooked (which is something I've never done), and straight away he retorted with a defensive and derogatory tone, that this was how they do it here and that's what al dente was. Wait, what? Al dente is al dente, there's no degrees of al dente. It either is or it isn't. So this really annoyed and irked me, as I myself am Italian with parents born in Italy, and I've been eating pasta for 26 years - I think I know what al dente is, and I know for a fact that that pasta was nowhere near. Period. But anyway, he offered to take it back and cook it a bit more which I gladly accepted and thanked him for, and it returned fairly promptly and a lot better (but still on the firm side). But overall the situation left me feeling a bit uneasy and quite frankly belittled. \\nFYI, I tried my girlfriend's tortellini and that was nice, and the calamari entree was pretty good. The cash only policy is a bit strange but manageable I suppose, just come prepared.

On this visit to McGraths we ordered seared Ahi tuna and salmon sliders.  When the appetizer arrived the tuna had a strange appearance.  We are used to Ahi tuna that is red or pink but not dark purple or black.  It looked positively scary.  The salmon in the sliders was tasteless and mushy.  Our disappointment with the food caused us to take a closer look at the restaurant itself.  The work surfaces behind the bar were very dirty with many empty wine battles cluttering the back bar.  Looking up to the ceiling the open rafters and cross braces were unbelievably filthy to the point of appearing furry with dirt and cob webs.  The nice looking belt driven ceiling fans haven't worked in years.  It makes us very sad that management has allowed this once great eating establishment to degrade to this point.

So, I was pumped when my still vegetarian sister wanted to join me for lunch at this establishment. We entered the smallish restaurant about noon and the place was packed. Hearing such good reviews we didn't mind the wait at all and took the time to look over the menu so that we could order as soon as we were seated. About 15 minutes later we were taken to a table and as we were about to tell the waiter/host what we wanted he disappeared for ten minutes before returning to take our order. \\nWe decided on sharing the beet latkes, the tempeh reuben, and the peanut noodle salad. The latkes came out first. Growing up on lakes during Hanukkah we were excited to see Red Lentil's take on the fried Jewish pancake. Boy...were we disappointed.  The latkes were supposed to come on a bed of greens, but instead about 5 green leaves were plopped on top of the pancakes. The latkes themselves were horrrrrible. Upon the first bite my sister and I had the same reaction: they tasted like fruit leather. While the flavor was ok the latkes were so dense, flat, and overcooked that they were hard to cut and chew. Waiting for the next dishes we hoped that the latkes were just an oops. The reuben was ok, though the tempeh was burnt. The Belgian sweet potato fries that accompanied it were prepared very poorly.  While Beligian fries are usually irregular in shape these looked as if they were ripped apart in various sizes instead of cut. This led too the small fries being overcooked and the large fries undercooked. Our least favorite part of the meal may was the peanut noodle salad. The flavor was lacking and the soba noodles were overcooked; basically an untasty pile of mush.\\nThe restaurant was clean and the server was friendly but that hardly made of for the poor quality of the food that cost us $30.

I recently took the family for a weekend trip to Orlando and we stayed near Universal Studios.  Thanks to Yelp, I was able to discover this obscure Japanese restaurant just a stone throw away from our hotel.  As others have mentioned, this restaurant resides in a shopping plaza seemingly devoid of any type of business activity.  The signage for Aki was  difficult to spot as well so keep a lookout for a sign with the words \\"Japanese Food\\".  \\n\\nWe were looking forward to eating at Aki that night only to be disappointed upon discovering that they don't open on Sundays!  What type of restaurant (besides Chick-Fil-A) closes on a Sunday!?!?!  They open Mon-Sat for dinner.  The following night, we arrived as they opened for dinner.  Aki actually offers a $1 sushi happy hour special from 5:30pm-6:30pm.  You can even get entire rolls for $2.  The selection for Happy Hour was limited so we ordered the salmon & tuna to gauge the quality of their sushi.  After sampling a variety of sushi, we were definitely impressed by how fresh everything was and ordered more from their Happy Hr menu.  I was pleasantly surprised that they actually used real crabmeat instead of the usual imitation crabmeat for the crab nigiri.  \\n\\nWe also tried cooked items such as Beef with Curry Rice as well as Omurice (Japanese Chicken Rice wrapped with an omelete).  Both came in good sized portions.  However, the Curry sauce came out darker than I was normally used to, but it was fine. The Omurice was fantastic and my kids also enjoyed it.  If ketchup & eggs isn't your thing... I suggest you request that no ketchup be on your egg.  We also ordered a Tempura Udon Soup and it was great.  The broth was flavorful, not too salty and the tempura items were put on a side plate so that they don't get soggy.  \\n\\nOverall, it was a great dining experience.  The food was fresh, the price was right, & service was prompt and attentive.  I'd definitely return to Aki in a heartbeat to try out more dishes."},{"name":"O'Malley's Saloon & Grill","address":"6535 SE Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"My problem with this place is the service.

It is my favourite thing to do on my weekends. Nothing is more relaxing than sitting in the patio (provided that it's summer..because we all know how the weather is in Vancouver) and sharing a few amazing dishes with some friends. \\n\\nChambar has officially become my favourite spot for brunch in Vancouver. I love how you can make reservations online at home instead of waiting in line outside the restaurant. Their menu is very similar to Cafe Medina but the most appealing thing about Chambar is that you don't have to wait outside for over an hour to be fed one of those fluffy waffles! \\n\\nMy favourite savory dishes here are the Paella and Friccasse. If you like spicy food, the Paella will give you a nice kick. I've always had an issue where my eyes are bigger than my stomach so I always think I can devour the entire plate of Paella on my own but this goal of mine has never been accomplished (yet!). Therefore, just to give you guys a heads up, if you want a waffle after your meal, always share your food. Sharing is caring at Chambar. \\n\\nFriccasse is also quite a heavy dish but I've actually managed to wipe the dish clean before so I guess it is a more manageable portion. The short ribs are always perfectly cooked and flavourful. Highly recommended! \\n\\nAnother thing I always order at Chambar is the lavender latte-- it is a must try if you haven't yet! You'll be in latte heaven. It doesn't taste flowery or artificial- just legit lavender! \\n\\nI won't talk about the waffles too much since everyone already knows that they're delightful!"},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Oh em gee!!!!!

The cole slaw was good...... bread was warm and soft almost had a freshly made taste to it.....  now, to the best part... the service.  We had a very nice young lady helping us.... Kelsey.....she was soooo friendly, she made sure we had our drinks filled, made sure we had enough BBQ sauce, she kept the BBQ plate full all of the time.... the Best service by far of all the places we visited in TX...  to sum it up.... BBQ was good but....not.... \\"OMG....the best in all of the planet\\".....but it was made better by the service.

The atmosphere was fun and inviting. They offered live music and Irish steppers performed off and on throughout the night. The pricing is moderate, with a nice range of offerings from typical Irish favorites such as Shepherd's Pie and Fish and Chips to other dishes they have put their creative spin on such as the delicious Gnocchi Sea Gnocchi Do. It was so good with perfectly cooked scallops. Oh, I skipped past the appetizers! Everything was tempting, so we were incredibly lucky that Raglan Road was included on the Delux Disney Dining Plan. Each adult was able to pick one, so we had the fried scallops, spicy shrimp, and the muscles. I was so stunned by the amount and presentation, that I blanked on the actual name and it was half gone before I thought to take pretty pictures. For entrees, we ordered the Gnocchi, Shepherd's Pie, and Fish and Chips for the kids. Dinner ended with dessert offerings, also included in the Dining Plan. I chose the Flourless Chocolate Cake, which had berries and chocolate ganache. I was forced to take it to go, because we were so full, but when I finally tasted it...... oh my goodness.  Heaven. Did I mention  drinks yet? They offer a nice variety of draft beers, and specialty drinks from mojitos to Bourbon concoctions. Everything tasted wonderful and I really could go on about each dish. I will conclude by say that the staff is friendly and service was fabulous. Raglan Road is a must in Disney Springs. If you have to w as it, they have a wonderful store, and an outside patio that also offered live music. Don't need a table?

So here's what I would recommend:\\n\\nDo go to Giacomo's if:\\n\\n-  You don't mind waiting in line and you want to see what all the fuss is about for yourself\\n\\n-  You're looking to have a quick dinner (they will have you in and out of there in 45 minutes)\\n\\n-  You want good food.  It is definitely above average.  Portions are big too - one plate is enough for two people to share.  I got the calamari appetizer - it was excellent.  I also got the grilled salmon with marinated vegetables.  Sounds like an ordinary dish, but it wasn't, the salmon was fresh and grilled to perfection.\\n\\n- You don't want to spend an arm and a leg.  Wine was $16/bottle, $4/glass.  Beer $3.  Entrees approx $14.  Cheap for North End.\\n\\n- You don't mind sitting in very tight quarters, literally centimeters away from the surrounding tables.  \\n\\n-  You don't mind reading the menu from a big chalkboard on the wall \\n\\n-  You are the type of person that can decide what you want to order within 30 seconds of sitting down.  Seriously,   the waitress asked me if I was ready to order 3 times in a 2 minute span of time.  She was polite about it, but didn't try to hide the fact that they are trying to turn tables around quickly.    \\n\\n\\nDo NOT go to Giacomo's if:\\n\\n-  You're taking someone out for a romantic evening\\n\\n- You want to sit down, relax and enjoy a long dinner where you don't feel rushed.\\n\\n-  You want to have a conversation.  It's incredibly loud.\\n\\n- You have small children with you.  I didn't see any high chairs and couldn't imagine bringing my kids to sit in that cramped environment.\\n\\n- You don't have cash on you (they don't take credit cards)"},{"name":"Jimmy Hula's","address":"11556 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Before we even ordered our food, I saw one of the workers tell a customer that they didn't need their business and screamed \\"fuck you\\" at him.

Apart from people smoking inside I had a great meal. When the chain came to Boston and claimed the former Maison Robert location I was both sad and happy. Sad because MR was one of my favorite Boston restaurants and I wasn't yet over it's departure (snif). Happy because this is a great location for a restaurant. So, the butter thing, yeah it's like \\"I feel guilty enough gorging on red meat, and then you're gonna add another 200g of cholesterol?!\\". Take an extra Lipitor and suck it up because it does taste good. Currently I like the 12 oz fillet with the Au Poivre treatment, and yes they still put the butter on, the sauce is on the side. The sauce features green, not black peppercorns. I usually get a Cesar or the Tomato Salad to start. My bread has always been served hot. For sides I like the creamed spinach or the asparagus with the Hollandaise. I would also mention that RC sports a \\"killer\\" burger, perhaps only second in the city to Radius (hands down best in Boston). The restaurant has alcove dinning rooms that make for an intimate setting. The patio is open now  it's a wonderful place for lunch or drinks.  The bar has a vaulted ceiling and a great view of the historical grave yard if you dig that sort of thing.\\nEven if you don't eat at RC the bar is good place to start the night. They have nice comfy chairs to lounge in. The wine list is excellent and for the Cab lover they feature the Provenance by the glass. There are a few factors that keep RC from a 5 star rating;\\n1) I have received variable service from the staff.

The bartenders were very attentive and took care of our every need. \\n\\nThe Drinks / Food: Lots of margarita options here... and they're pretty good. The freshly made guac and salsa were big hits with our crowd. The soft tacos got mixed reviews... some folks said they weren't particularly flavorful. I didn't try them, so I can't really give a fair assessment. But the guac here is a must! And the chips are well-seasoned.\\n\\nThe Ambiance: The outdoor bar area was great. It was roped off for our party, so we had some privacy. But since we were at the front of the restaurant, we got to enjoy some excellent people-watching. Rocco's Tacos attracts an entertaining crowd. Since you're on Sand Lake, you'll see a wide variety of types, like tourists in jorts and tees, women in bebe club gear, businessmen in tailored suits... you get the picture.

I live nearby and have been dying to try this place for ages but since I am what might politely be called \\"economically challenged\\" I wanted to save it for a special occasion. My dad had also seen this place when the make-a-dish-inspired-by-a-great-work-of-New-England-literature challenge was held here on Top Chef, so he was basically just as excited as I was.\\n\\nWe had a 10:00 reservation but arrived around 9:15, figuring we could have a few drinks at the bar, but the hostess told us it was good we arrived so early, as the restaurant was quite crowded. She made it sound like we were going to have to wait for hours, but we hadn't even finished our first round of cocktails (the Hotel Street Punch for me, and the Mellow Yellow for my dad, both very good) when we were seated at a nice table near the bar.\\n\\nIn lieu of doing the tasting menu we decided to try a few different things. We started with the fried Essex clams, the crispy pig's tails, and the raw oysters. They were all incredible--the oysters fresh and briny, the clams plump and crispy with a tasty squid ink-based sauce on the side. And the pig's tails? Absolutely divine--almost like eating ribs, full of porky flavors with alternating crispy and tender bits. Then for an entree, we decided to split the pig's head. We had pig's head a couple months earlier at the Greenhouse Tavern in Cleveland, where the head was prepared like a barbecue, but at Craigie on Main it is prepared Peking-duck style, with a crunchy bright-pink skin, served with pancakes, pumpkin sambal, and boudin noir hoisin sauce. It was absolutely incredible, and to me far surpassed Greenhouse Tavern's also-excellent preparation. It was like the best of a banh mi-meets-Peking-duck, with the fattiness of the pig's head perfectly contrasted with the fresh, crunchy sambal and the slightly-sweet hoisin. I highly recommend it, though it does require a certain willingness to not be squeamish as it really does look like a head (a very drunk woman at the bar leaned over to us and exclaimed 'WHAT THE HELL IS THAT????') and the eye is still included in the mandible. The way I see it, it's no different in terms of product than what you get shrinkwrapped at the store, and I enjoyed every minute of it.\\n\\nA flawless meal from start to finish.

Let me start by saying that I have never written a bad review before, so this is a first. \\n\\nI'll start with the positives. The service was good. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. The atmosphere of the restaurant was also very good. I walked in with a group of 7 at noon on July 4th and we were seated in about 30 minutes. The one compliment I can give to the food is that the appetizer beignets were delicious. They come with a really good honey and orange dipping sauce. Everyone in my group loved them. TIP: You can get the beignets for free by downloading the app \\"Stealz\\". They advertised this on a sign at the table with a picture of the appetizer with 8 beignets, so that is what I ordered. When checks came, I showed my waiter the coupon on the app and he told me that could only be used on the 4 beignet appetizer. He was understanding of the false advertising and still gave them to me for free anyway. \\n\\nNow for the negatives. FOOD. I decided to splurge on the $15 lobster and brie omelette. It was disgusting. The eggs were lower quality than McDonalds and everything on my plate tasted artificial and bland. I ended up only eating the breakfast potatoes - not because they were great, but because they were the only thing I could stomach. My boyfriend ordered the lakeshore scrambler and said it was not hot or flavorful. His meal still managed to be slightly better than mine.

Since the appetizers and entrees we're so good, I even ordered desert (which happens on VERY rare occasions), and we devoured them as well.

The Benedict itself comes out on a very large skillet in a larger oval plate, with the breakfast potatoes on the larger plate.  It was underwhelming.  I'd suggest using a smaller skillet or serving the potatoes next to the Benedict inside the skillet.  The chicken sandwich was not bad, but the balsamic flavor was undetectable.  Fortunately the melted smoked Gouda made up for it.  Again, a little more seasoning on everything would help.  The space and the service was good, but the food could improve.

My dining partner and I came in originally because, at this time, it is a participant in Magical Dining month, and thought it would be a nice new thing to try, and again, I had heard that it was nice.\\nFirst things first: The restaurant isn't really a restaurant, but a few tables sprinkled around the lobby and some on the back patio. Most of the tables in the lobby are coffee tables, so if you plan to eat there for an extended period of time, you should probably book a massage for the next morning. \\nUpon registering that we were actually standing in the lobby/restaurant, I looked around for a hostess stand or a sign that said \\"Seat Yourself.\\" Alas, neither were to be found, and thereupon decided to go to the Front Desk and ask. Upon informing him of our desire for lunch, he said \\"Let me see if I can find a server.\\" He was the most helpful man of this whole endeavor. He found a server. She sat us at a table right next to a business meeting. I'm sure they weren't particularly fond of us being 3 feet away, and neither were we, however, the table and chairs were of average height, and I didn't want to sit at a coffee table. We politely asked for the Magical Dining menu (fixed price) and it was delivered promptly.\\nWe ordered ice tea and a club soda with bitters, only to be given a club soda with lime and peach ice tea.\\nSeveral minutes later a different server came to our table and told us that we were not allowed to have the menu we had requested, it was only available at dinner. Seeing as how that was the reason we had decided to dine there, it was disappointing. We then asked for the regular menu, which took another minute to get to us.\\nGlancing through the menu, nothing was particularly interesting, or eye-catching. Tuna Sandwich, Calamari, Caesar salad. None of the items that we had desired to order from the MD menu were available. I then saw the cocktail menu and decided to order a Dark and Stormy, and figured I needed something to eat along with it.\\nI ended up ordering the Tuna Sliders appetizer.\\nCome to find, there is no bartender on duty, so the servers must ask the manager to open the liquor storage area, which takes approx 5 minutes, another 3 minutes later I turn around to see both of the servers staring at the menu and trying to find the right rum to put in the drink. Then my newly appointed bartender-server shakes my Dark and Stormy, and pours it into a highball glass. No ice. No nothing. Needless to say, I didn't care for my flat ginger beer.\\nThe other server brings it over and explains, they don't have a bartender so they did the best they could and hoped it was right. It wasn't. In fact it was pretty awful.\\nThen my food is arriving 20 minutes after I've ordered it, which for an appetizer seems strange. It appears even stranger when I realize that it is 2 potato buns with 2 thin slices of sesame edged tuna, a tablespoon of onions, and another tablespoon of bean sprouts. But in order to recognize all of that I had to turn my plate around, because the server put the plate down backwards. \\nI taste my appetizer, hoping it will redeem this already disastrous service, but to no avail. All I taste is bread and spice. The wasabi-ketchup was overpowering the fish, and the bun was 3 times bigger than the actual fish portion. I did my due of giving it more than a one bite dismissal, took the bun off the other fish and proceeded to eat the contents of my slider. That would have been a delightful snack, but not $12 worth. I realize that it is a hotel restaurant so prices are a bit inflated, however, $12 for potato buns and nothing spectacular in between, left a bad taste in my mouth in more ways than one.\\nI asked for the check, immediately checked the bill and saw that my ice tea and the club soda sans bitters were $3 each. Well that was a surprise... I've never paid  $3 for club soda before... apparently it was a very expensive lime garnish.\\nI waited for the server to pick up my credit card after 2 passes and removing my plate full of food. Upon paying and leaving, I knew I would never come back here, nor recommend it to any of my guests.\\n\\nIf all that was too much too read, here's the long and short of it:\\nThe service was slow, disengaged, unprepared, and unobservant.\\nThe food was overpriced, underdeveloped, and not appetite-inciting.\\nI'd like to say that I'll give it another shot maybe in a few years, but this was by far one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've ever had."},{"name":"Ladd Taphouse","address":"2239 SE 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"This ia a GIANT sports bar.

On my recent trip to Austin, I was told by numerous people who know Austin that going to the original Salt Lick is an absolute must. Now I understand why.

I went there anticipating amazing barbeque and horrible side dishes. I was actually pleasantly surprised to discover that the sides were actually pretty darn good. Don't get me wrong...they weren't the highlight of the meal, but then again I don't think they should be with meat that good. It would only steal the meat's thunder. My boyfriend and I split the four meat plate (sausage, turkey, pork ribs,and brisket), and it was more than enough. We waddled out of there shaking our heads in disbelief of how full we were. All four meats were fantastic, and the plate comes with potato salad, cole slaw, and beans. Neither the potato salad nor cole slaw were mayonnaise-based (great for me because I LOATHE mayo!), and the beans are more of a ranch style preparation instead of the traditional sweet baked version. The bread, pickles, and onions they provide perfectly complement the flavor of the meats. It's BYOB, and the waitress even opened our bottles for us and brought us a cute ice bucket (which you can take home, BTW). A word to the wise: the all you can eat meal, albeit tempting, is ridiculous and completely unnecessary. You outta be ashamed of yourself if you even dare order it.

And I can honestly say that this is the worst chain restaurant I've ever been to. There are 5 reasons why. \\n\\n1) As soon as I entered, I was yelled at by 6 employees saying \\"WELCOME TO MOE'S\\". It seemed really forced and insincere. It was as if I just entered a room full of fraternity brothers, and it wasn't welcoming at all. \\n\\n2) During dinner, I saw employees scoffing at negative reviews on Yelp and replacing them with ones that have 5-stars. They mocked previous comments and laughed at the fact that someone wrote that the food is bland. Any reviews made by people that just recently joined yelp and rated this restaurant 5-stars cannot be trusted. \\n\\n3) The food is bland. I would never have paid so much for a rice bowl if I knew that it tasted horrible. There was no flavor in anything and my chicken was dry. \\n\\n4) To make up for the lack of flavoring in the food, they give you a giant portion of chips and have a \\"salsa\\" bar open. First off, the chips do not taste fresh. Secondly, the salsas are watered down and you'd be better off getting jarred supermarket salsa instead.The \\"hot\\" salsa is completely bland and 2 out of the 5 salsas had a very strange after taste. I don't know if they were old or not refrigerated well, but I can promise you that it was not worth the money. \\n \\n5) The prices are horrendous. Considering the bland food and disappointing chips and salsa, I wish I never spent my money. The portions are also really small, if you take away the chips. The burrito at Chipotle's is at least 30% bigger and actually has flavor. I would have much rather went to Carl's or even Margarita's (even though Margarita's food isn't great to begin with).\\n\\nSo if you're looking for a recently opened location in Waltham that has people screaming every couple minutes and awful food that's insanely priced, go to Moe's.

We tried a couple of new things on the menu which I also really enjoyed. The millionaire's curry is definitely something I will get again!

For two people, I would order at least 4-5 tapas to get a good taste of everything Barcelona has to offer. More the better in this case cause every plate is quite small. If you're in the mood for wine, this place has a wide variety that will definitely satisfy. Only downside I suppose was the service (elaborated more below) and some dishes could come out a bit salty. We even had a few dishes that were definitely supposed to come out warm but seemed a bit cold.\\n\\nA few favorites:\\nChorizo and fig, hanger steak, meatballs (definitely filling), charcuterie (most of them should be good)\\n\\nService could have been better but it was a busy night and I didn't get a table in advance.

I've been here before where I did make a reservation and the service was great. Each server is willing to go through each menu item with you and give you good recommendations. I would come slightly dressed a bit, but no strict code here. Parking is free in the surrounding area, which has a pretty big garage.

The area it's located in is a little odd and there weren't many diners at any of the restaurants in the plaza area. This might also have been because it was freezing cold out and no one was walking around looking for places to eat. \\n\\nWe were seated right away and greeted by our pleasant waitress. Drinks came extremely fast (good Sangria!) and we decided to order a variety of dishes including the patatas bravas, shrimp, chorizo, mussels, lamb and tortilla Espanola. We started to order a side of bread but our waitress warned us that two dishes came with bread which was much appreciated. Everything was cooked well, but more importantly it was paced nicely. We received two dishes at a time and she made sure the two dishes with bread sides didn't come out at once. We ended with the churros and chocolate - delicious! \\n\\nI'll be honest - I've had better and more innovative Tapas and I can't give this place five stars because a couple of the dishes (the lamb and chorizo) could have definitely been seasoned differently and been more innovative.

The prices are reasonable (especially compared to its neighbors) the food is spectacular (go for the lobster ravioli) and the service is great. They've got specials written in chalk on the wall and the tin tile ceiling panels are a nice touch. \\n\\nI like that Giacomo's does not accept credit cards. It gives me more of a family-run feel and I think it helps speed up the process (think about groups who split up checks three or four ways...)\\n\\nThe main problem, as everyone has mentioned, is the line. Once you make it close enough to see inside the restaurant you're still looking at between 30 and 40 minutes of a wait, assuming you have four or less people in your party. For those who are driving, this isn't so bad since that's about the amount of time it will take you to find a parking spot (yes, really) so leave one or two people in line while you do that and you should make it in at about the same time. I saw a couple bring a cocktail to share while they waited last time I was there, and it seemed to help them endure the line.\\n\\nThere is also the issue of seating. You are completely cramped in this restaurant. For parties of two you are often brushing elbows with a couple next to you, and I would never even consider bringing more than four. \\n\\nBut as I said, even with the close quarters and long wait, this restaurant is completely worth it."},{"name":"King Bao","address":"710 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"So delicious!

As a side effect, no animals were injured in the preparation of my meal.  That always feels good.  \\n\\nI enjoyed a bite of my wife's Shepherds Pie.

Smoke ring was non-existent and it was tough and chewy, unlike almost any other BBQ place I've ever been.\\n- Beef and Pork Ribs: So I guess they decided to not be mainstream and have the meat on the ribs stay on the bone. For me, when I get ribs, I love when the meat starts melting off the bones on their own. Clearly the people at Salt Lick do not agree. The Beef was a little better than the pork.\\n- Turkey: Surprisingly adequate. Not dry at all and full of flavor. If only the brisket could have been like the turkey...\\n- Sausage: A decent sausage but nothing spectacular.\\n- BBQ Sauce: Their BBQ sauce is rather tangy, seemingly using more vinegar than other sauces. It's not bad but I don't think anything can cover up the meat in this place.\\n\\nThe potatoes aren't bad but I didn't come here for potatoes. I came here for meat.

Corn tortillas instead of flour. Fried, stuffed quesadillas. Blah blah blah. They were definitely playing Eiffel 65's \\"Blue\\" as she gave us that spiel.\\n\\nThis spot is loud. Not only is the music loud (and oddly out of place for a spot that prides itself on authenticity), but the space's high ceilings amplify every conversation going on. It's lively, maybe a little off-putting to someone just looking to grab some solid food.\\n\\nChips and salsa are solid. Homemade corn tortilla chips. Fresh salsa with some good heat. \\n\\nI ordered the Pollo taco platter. The tacos are dressed fairly authentically (diced onion, cilantro, salsa, maybe a bit of lime). No sour cream, cheese, or any more Tex-mex options, really. But the tacos are nice. Beautiful, pulled chipotle-rubbed chicken. They're a bit small--about the size you'd expect from a taco cart (The dinner platters come with three, a generous portion of rice, and your choice of black beans, pintos, or refritos.)\\n\\nOverall, the tacos are pretty solid. And, unless you're looking to wear a blazer (or a cocktail dress) to grab tacos, I'd hit Pure in the daytime (the portions are a bit smaller, and everything costs about half as much).\\n\\nAlso, I couldn't tell what the hell was going on with the decor. There were shelves randomly placed--with agave plants...and gallon jugs of margarita mix? Weird.\\n\\nThe bottom line: Pure has good food (a bit overpriced for tacos), but its nighttime identity crisis really kind of threw me off. I know they're striving to separate themselves from the rest of the taqueria pack, but the food and the nighttime atmosphere don't really mix very well."},{"name":"Keke's Breakfast Cafe","address":"282 Moore Rd","city":"Ocoee","stars":"3.5","text":"My breakfast was served cold (yay, cold eggs!).

My expectations: Great ribs, ok sausage and brisket, cool venue, and always, excellent service. We will see if SL meets or exceeds. I REALLY hope it doesn't fall flat on it's face.

I hoped for the Ranchers platter, but there's no turkey. Don't plan on having it, apparently they haven't had it for 6 months. For myself and two kids, we had the beef rib plate, Thurman's plate, pulled pork samich, and an Extra 1/2 pound pork ribs. We only had some sides and two ribs left, and it wasn't because we should have ordered more. The brisket and sausage were good, but nothing extreme. The ribs are great. The beef ribs were damn good. The bread is awesome, but I avoided it as much as possible. I'm not a huge fan of potato salad or coleslaw, but both were really good. BUT, the winner of the night and what I'll be returning for was the pulled pork samich. Awesome. No one ever mentions it or talks about it, the three meats get all the attention. This $#|+ is the bomb. They take a whole chunk of the really good table bread and stuff it full of fantastic pulled pork. It blows the other meats away. I just added the  table sauce with the red lid to almost every bite and destroyed it, but it didn't NEED the table sauce, it just made it that much better. I kinda hit a wall at one point and just opened it up and gutted it of the meat. It lost it's battle against me.

Yelp reviews seemed promising, although the night before we got a really weird vibe after eating at the pizza joint next door. \\n\\n(It was about 11 pm on a Thursday and we were going to stop in for a beer, since the pizza joint only carried local stuff. We walk in, and the place had about 20 guys sitting around the bar, watching TV. There wasn't one XX chromosome in the entire place. Now there's nothing wrong with a guy's night, but when everyone is emulating grandpa's smoking room, where everyone was pretty silent, it's wasn't really the vibe we were looking for. )\\n\\nSo Friday night - the one this review is about - was sure to be jumping, especially since we were arriving at 10:25 pm. Things looked good as we walked in. The LA Angels were playing on half the TVs, the NFL on the rest. There was a nice crowd, but not packed. On our side of the place there were about 2 empty booths, 4 empty tables. The hostess, (apparently  ... I'll get to that later) attempted to seat us at a table. We asked for a booth. No prob. It would take 2 minutes to clean one of the two that just recently opened up. Still, no prob. We stand for a couple minutes while she does her thing, and were seated by 10:30. She gives us menus and that was the last we would ever see her again, though we didn't yet know it. So she, obviously, didn't think she was our waitress.   \\n\\nWatching the games, checking out the menu, talking it up, recapping the day, and between 10:40 - 10:50 we've begun to realize the service sucks. Nobody even tries to look in our direction. And even worse, the wait staff wears these uniforms that make it hard to tell whether that are everyday Joes, who could be just walking in, or headed to the restroom, rather than someone ready to serve you.\\n\\nAnyway, we had to literally do a NY taxi cab whistle to get someone to come over, a pretty nice guy with dreadlocks, who apologized for the now 20 minute delay, and proceeded to take our order. We had been sitting for so long, that we had it all ready for him. We gave him drinks, appetizers and entree orders all at once. That was 10:55.\\n\\nWe sit. We're irritated. But there's the potential of a light at the end of the tunnel. \\n\\nBy the way, as we were looking over the menu during that 20 minute period, I tried to look at other people's tables to get an idea as to order. You know, see if anyone else had something interesting. There were about 10 such tables within my sight lines. Only 2 had any food. I thought to myself that it seemed to be a bad sign. They were apparently waiting a ridiculously long time also. \\n\\nAnyway, I'm in the booth facing Marrietta, so I can see new guests walking in. I watched three guys walk in at 10:45 pm, get immediately seated, and a (different) waiter instantly took their orders. That was right before our New York cabbie whistle. \\n\\nSo now, at 11:00 pm, when I see three beers come out to them, I am getting pissed. We start talking about our options. Obviously things aren't going well here and we need a plan B. McCormick's closed at 10 this night, but maybe we'll do pizza again. \\n\\nWe weigh these options slowly, hoping, praying that Stats comes through.\\n\\nNot the case. It's 11:07 when we leave. Any place where you can't see service within 20 minutes, and then can't put out three beers on tap in a nearly 15 minute window, in my personal opinion, rates less than the 1 star I'm forced to leave."},{"name":"Maria's Pastry Shop","address":"46 Cross St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Look just go there - stuff your face and forget about Mike's and Modern."},{"name":"The Porter Beer Bar","address":"1156 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I love The Porter- been coming semi-regularly for years since they opened.

My friend and I had some hush puppies to start and they were delightful.  I love it when a restaurant can take a classic and retrofit it into a trendy masterpiece, bacon bandwagon aside.  The hush puppies were tender and moist, most certainly from the addition of that smoky bacon and the apple sauce complimented them perfectly.\\n\\nI also had the Fish n Chips, a yummy beer-battered cod (the only acceptable fish n chips fish, imo) that comes with The Porters house-made tarter sauce.  It was a little on the greasy side, like what you'd find in the chippys in London, but much better because of the beer batter.  And those fries... those herby, garlicky fries served piping hot and crispy.  I believe that the Porter Bar Fish n Chips will be my go to hangover meal, if I'm in the area.\\n\\nMy friend had some Pork Butt Sliders (i dunno about you, but saying that... pork butt sliders... makes me giggle) and they were so tender.

I ordered the goat cheese appetizer which was $8.99 for a golf ball size of encrusted, overly fried goat cheese that was fairly nasty served with cruidites and some salsa.  It was disgusting.  Two of my friends ordered the chicken and waffles and the waffles were cold, another person ordered the ham and cheese croissant and another the breakfast plate which seemed to be ok, but nothing to write home about.  I need to note I ordered a glass of chardonnay that was house wine and was 8.99 a glass, I would have rather gotten a box of wine and went home.  IF it was not for the wild and fun entertainment, I would not recommend, but my friends went home happy and I went home hungry.  We didnt get any cotton candy which I was disappointed.  Don't go for the food--eat a snack before you leave and order softdrinks when you are there!  Other than that--have fun."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Man alive, this place was amazing. If you've got a chunk of change to throw  around definitely get the tasting menu! Pricey but worth it. There were  internal organs involved, but you know what? They were good, damn good. The only draw back for me was they didn't have wine parings with the tasting menu but the chef made some great recommendations so problem solved."},{"name":"Nubian Queen Lola's Cajun Soul Food","address":"1815 Rosewood Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I have been meaning to go into Nubian Queen for about 2 years. Last Friday night, it was freezing cold with the infamous \\"Arctic Blast 2010\\". We were wanting something small, cozy, local, and soul-food-ish. I wasn't sure if Nubian would be open and we checked their hours on the website and were in luck. Her website is http://nubianqueenlolas.com/\\n\\nWe were the only ones in the restaurant that has three basic seating tables. One large table that seats 8, another that seats about 6, and one more that seats two. Several homeless people came in looking for Lola. One seemed to indicate to Lola's daughter that Lola had promised her soup - which later Lola seemed to go out and make good on her word. \\n\\nI had Gumbo and cornbread. It was awesome. I was also impressed that they really have a very reasonable menu. I could go in and get a meal for $3.50 up. \\n\\nThis is a good date place (if you like something cozy and interesting) or a cool place to go with a good group of friends or family. If you like a highly controlled environment - probably not the place for you."},{"name":"Daedalus Restaurant","address":"45 Mt Auburn St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Love does not begin to explain my feelings for Daedalus.

Located really close to my house, I never knew how amazing this place was until coming here last weekend. I have a plenty of favorites here at this restaurant....first one is hands down the cold beef sandwich with a sesame flaky pancake (honestly forgot what the name is). This is something I always order when I come here. The beef is cold, but it works really well with the flaky pancake. And you only pay $5-$6 for it, which is a great price considering how flavorful it is. Second - the spicy beef noodle soup! The beef is so soft and tender, the soup is extremely flavorful and perfectly spicy, and the noodles have a great chew to it. Third - soy milk with their homemade chinese fried dough. Honestly, this is the only place that I will ever order chinese fried dough from because their dough is chewy but crunchy at the same time. The ones in chinatown are just super crunchy with barely any chew to it. If it does have chew, it's probably soggy. Anyways, everything is great here! They only offer this type of food on weekends only. There is usually a wait, but it goes by quick because service is super quick."},{"name":"Ladd Taphouse","address":"2239 SE 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"There is only two positive things about The Blitz, shuffle board and totchoes.If you're reading this and thinking to yourself, ' hey I really like Shuffle board and totchoes' , I still caution you to pass on this place.

Even under the glaze of Tequila shots I couldn't convince myself that this bar was a good idea.

I love sitting at the bar and watching the chefs in the back along with bartenders crafting up some beautiful drinks like most recent hibiscus cocktail I had (yum). \\n\\nOur favorites are probably the seared tuna bowl and the crab noodles.

But once we were seated, the service was quick and extremely friendly.  However, I'm not here to talk about the wait or the service -- I'm here to talk about the food.  And the food was freakin' delicious.  \\n\\nWe started off with the sesame crusted seitan and the gobi Manchurian appetizers.  The seitan was perfectly crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and the sesame glaze was sweet and delicious.  The gobi was the real star, however, with an amazing texture and just the right blend of spices -- I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed eating cauliflower that wasn't smothered in cheese!  We washed down the apps with one of their excellent homemade smoothies (\\"tropical\\" something or another).  For dinner, I had the polenta with mushrooms and asparagus, which was hearty and filling, and my friend had the pizza special with mozzarella, blue cheese, artichoke hearts, carmelized onions, and sage (needless to say, that was also awesome, if not exactly vegan-friendly).  Even though we were stuffed at this point, we capped off the meal with a slice of vegan chocolate cherry cake.  The cake was moist and rich, with a sweet -yet-tart filling, and it was covered in a delicious chocolate ganache.  \\n\\nAll in all, the meal came out to $53.50 before tip -- which for a huge, delicious, veg-friendly meal, really ain't bad!

I don't think paella should be priced per person. As someone who loves paella I have not been able to justify spending $25 for just a paella portion for myself when I could use that money for multiple other tapas. Typically at a tapas restaurant you could spend $30 or $40 for one paella for the table. This pricing seemed extreme to me.\\n\\n2.)

There are plenty of extras that you can put on your pizza near the kitchen area.
