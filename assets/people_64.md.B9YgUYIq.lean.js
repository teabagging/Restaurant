My first experience was almost 10 years ago. I was 16, besotted with Boston, and we were on a scavenger hunt throughout the city. We were led to Mike's and instructed to purchase and eat a cannoli. That was my first experience. I remember it mostly positively. The next year, a friend and I popped in for a piece of cake or two. It was delicious and the service was alright.\\n\\nHowever, this time, almost 10 years later, Mike's was crowded, and the service was off.  The signs were incorrect in the pastry case and the waitress, who looked overworked, was less than helpful and rather abrupt. I know people say to expect that in Boston, but over four days in to our trip there, we'd never encountered anything quite as brusque as our waitress.  My brother wanted a cream puff and there were two different varieties, one with strawberries and one without. The signs were the exact same for each, so he pointed directly at the one he wanted and said he wanted that cream puff. Of course, he was served the other. When we attempted to rectify the situation, the waitress rather rudely informed us that we should order the \\"STRAWBERRY cream puff.\\"  Apparently, we were supposed to know this despite incorrect signage and his pointing directly at the one he wanted.\\n\\nThat aside, my florentine cannoli was delightful, with a crunchy outside and a sweet, light filling inside.  My parents weren't displeased with their desserts.

Strongly recommended by national publications and respected palates alike it was with good fortune that I arrived mere moments after they opened their doors and with shelves fully stocked I asked the pleasant young clerk what she recommended - an question to which I received nearly a bakers dozen suggestions from her and one overwhelming suggestion for the Sfogliatella from an elderly couple sitting down to enjoy their pastries with coffee and a newspaper Knowing at this point that my first day in town would entail no less than eight stops (it actually turned out to be nine) culminating with a ten-course tasting at Craigie on Main I decided the better part of valor was to heed my elders advice in addition to the two standards by which I judge an Italian bakery.\\n\\nWith my selections boxed and bowed despite the fact that I ordered my options to dine-in I parked myself at a seat nearest the window and while the world walked by dressed in Bruins Yellow and Black I indulged, first on an authentic filled to order Sicilian Cannoli.  True to form and filled just prior to service as they are in Italy my bite was greeted with an excellent crack as the buttery pastry gave way to sweet, slightly textural, and entirely delicious ricotta filling.  Not to be outdone, my second selection was a traditional Italian Baba highly recommended by the clerk.  Opting for the vanilla custard filled version with a cherry on top this dish was the antithesis to the sweet and crunchy cannoli with the light sponge heavily laden with rum and Strega providing a boozy herbal tone mellowed by the sweet cream.  To put it lightly both options, the options by which I judge the quality of an Italian bakery, were textbook.\\n\\nMoving next to the sfogliatella I really didn't know what to expect; sure I'd heard of the Neapolitan classic but in all honesty I'm not sure I'd ever even seen one in person let alone tasted one.  Served warm and appearing somewhat akin to a croissant but at least thrice as dense this traditional Italian pastry was indeed layered and flaky, but what was inside was quite unlike anything I'd ever tasted before.  Reportedly made with \\"yellow cream\\" and semolina and featuring a mouth-feel somewhere between mascarpone and ricotta with hints of lemon, orange, and cinnamon this nicely nuance treat was surprisingly light on the stomach despite its considerable heft and additionally - well - it was fantastic, just like everything at Modern Pastry Shop and well deserving of the glowing recommendations."},{"name":"Panda Express","address":"3360 Shelby Ln Suite","city":"East Point","stars":"2.5","text":"What can I say, I was shopping at the Camp Creek shopping district and hungry and decided to try Panda Express.

They will probably continue to grow and dominate their niche because they provide the same value to me that Subway, McDonalds, and Papa Murphy's do.\\n\\nMy experience at Panda Express was great in every aspect. They appear to keep their stores clean. The people behind the scene are constantly busy cooking and servicing customers, and no one has to wait an unreasonable amount of time.  \\n\\nPanda Express pricing is also fabulous. When I order Chinese takeout I expect to pay $8-$10. At Panda Express I got a 2 side 1 entree meal for $5.70 ($6.15 after tax). The entrees were Orange Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken. The side was fried rice. The fried rice was good, but just your typical fried rice. The Orange Chicken was fresh, as I saw them cooking it, and delicious. The Kung Pao Chicken was too spicy for me, but I should state that my spice tolerance is very low. I will be exploring the menu for a Kung Pao Chicken replacement next time.  \\n\\nPanda Express being a chain is also nice, because you don't get hassled for using an AMEX. \\n\\nPanda Express is not the best Chinese food that I have ever tried, but I cannot think of another Chinese take-out that can provide all the intangibles (quick and attentive service, clean restaurant) and price for dinner. \\n\\nI love when the American quick service restaurant is executed well."},{"name":"Porter Cafe","address":"1723 Centre St","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"4.5","text":"I visited Porter Cafe on a weeknight and sat outside at one of their cute outdoor tables in the front.

It's hot but not intolerable nor does it take away from the flavor of the chicken. The batter is super crispy and has a nice spice mixture and the right amount of saltiness.

In my opinion I could give a 2 star or a 5 star! So it really depends on what you are expecting out of the experience. However, for sure it is an experience like no other!\\n\\nIf you're thinking of taking a first date there, reconsider! It is a rather busy buffet place with lots of tourists with kids running around, and the food may loose some of its visual appeal as a result. They may also run out of things like crab legs, especially if you go late. Some tips of advice:\\n\\n1. If enjoy a diversity of seafood, and interesting sides (like I do), then check it out \\n2. Sign up for coupons (via email), you may save $5 - $8 /person. You may also be able to get the coupon right from tourist info place in the same plaza as the I-drive Boston Lobster Feast.\\n3. Plan ahead: If you had a big lunch, you may want to go elsewhere. Do not skip breakfast and lunch to chow down at this place either, cause you'll do lots of damage to your system. Just eat a decent breakfast and a small early lunch.\\n4. Do not concern yourself with the look of the buffet table. There  are about 50 people around it every 10 minutes, the sushi is not going to look perfectly organized, but will still taste good.  The high turnover keeps them bringing fresh food out (unless you go around 8:30 pm or later)\\n5. Enjoy the diversity of the food, and realize this is not a gourmet top of the line restaurant, but quite frankly some things on there are quite good. The oysters will not taste like those I ate in Boston or even Grand Central Station Oyster bar, but for the reasonable buffet price (with coupon), eating a couple of dozen will pretty much cover your bill elsewhere. A dozen oysters and a few clams in Boston (and a NE clam chowder) cost me ~ $40; they were heavenly though).\\n\\nI max out at 2 lobster since I eat all the other stuff that I crave! The lobsters are smaller and perhaps not perfectly cooked, but still decent. Overall I would recommend this place highly to seafood lovers with an adventurous character.  The meats are not bad, especially the ones you get order to your table (like Filet Mignon).  The buffet meats are not the best!

I just discovered Mississippi Ave about a year ago and amazed how it has  been developed.  The local shops on this street are amazing and a great place for walks too.  After attending this year's Stumptown Comic Book Convention, I needed a drink.  It was about 2 in the afternoon so hopefully the brewery wouldn't be too packed as it has been in the past.\\n\\nWe arrived and it did looked a little packed since it was a very nice day.  We went inside and looked at the simple menu.  Certainly this place is more focused at the various micro brews on tap.  I was hoping the food menu would have a more variety of options, but it's mainly burgers and  brats.  My friend and I ordered a pitcher and a brat platter appetizer.  I managed to get a table on the patio and it was the last one . Great luck as always!  The beer was delicious and it had a strong alcohol content.  When the food arrived, the brats had flavor, noo spicy, but not bland either.  \\n\\nWhile we were eating, we found a dog tied to our table.  The dog was certainly paying attention to us and wanted attention.  We were wondering where the owner went  but she came by and apologized for the dog being near us.  We didn't mind since we were getting a strong buzz from the beer and having a great time.  We talked with her for a bit until we left.  Overall, this place is great for a delicious micro during the summer.  The crowd don't bite, very friendly atmosphere.

So don't blame me if I mislead you.\\n\\nMet a friend for lunch her and was nervous of what to expect after reading mixed reviews. Lambert's ambiance was a blend of fancy rustic decor which is to be expected in the W. 2nd district. \\n\\nService was spot on getting 5 stars for sure! The waiter refilled the hot water kettle for my tea 3 times, so it never got luke warm and always offered a new flavor of tea with each refill. My guess is that this is not so much the case in the evenings. It was wonderful eating in a peaceful environment instead of a rowdy country BBQ joint. There's definitely is a time and place for loud rowdy country BBQ joints but that's not the case during lunch at Lamberts.\\n\\nAppetizer was the spicy ribs which wasn't much to write home about. There wasn't as much meat as I hope for and it was too crispy. Did help clear the sinuses though. \\n\\nCornbread was forgetable. \\n\\nOrdered a one meat lunch plate which is $12 and comes with 2 sides. Great portion size. Now from what I could taste, the new potato salad was awesome! Uh, I could have eaten pounds of that stuff by itself! And when your sick, there's nothing like comfort food to make you feel better, and that's why I had to get the mac n' cheese. The mac n' cheese was lightly toasted on the top and definitely ooey and creamy on the inside. With that said it was good but not the best I've ever had. Finally, the apple smoked maple rubbed brisket was my meat of choice. Tender yet firm and juicy. Once again not the most amazing brisket that I've ever had but  it doesn't come close to the worst I've ever eaten So I' would have to give the food between 3  1/2 and 4 stars . \\n\\nI can't even believe that I didn't even try the BBQ sauce.

So after reading some descriptions and looking at some pics, I chose the crunchy dragon roll (bbq eel peaked my interest) and a shrimp roll, oh and some miso soup. Food came out pretty quick and I started out with the miso soup, which was pretty decent. Flavorful, but kind of a small serving so I was scared to see how small the sushi rolls would be. The rolls were the total opposite, nothing out of this world but good and pretty filling. One thing I did notice was that instead of using tempura or flash frying a roll, they top their rolls with rice crispy bits or something similar.

I have had Pho at at least four different places in Columbus before this one and this place by far has the best broth.  My boyfriend lamented why he didn't take my advice and just ordered the pho after he tasted mine!  His noodle dish was more like a noodle salad.  He was given some sort of cold soup in a bowl (which we later deciphered was the sauce for the noodle/salad), The picture made the dish appear more like a  pad thai type of dish, but it was something entirely different when it arrived at the table.  We didn't figure out the soup/sauce thing until we were nearly done with the meal.\\n\\nThe iced coffee (when I did finally get it) was very good.  Again, the waiter really didn't explain what I needed to do with the coffee so I had to kind of figure it out.  Not that any of this was difficult, but I am not from Southeast Asia so it would have helped if the wait staff explained some thing that might not be as obvious. Then again they were packed full on a Sunday afternoon and were very busy, so not much time to explain things or check on us to make sure we were doing okay.\\n\\nI will definitely go back again as the Pho was one of the best I have ever tasted and the prices were very reasonable."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Super cute shop with friendly baristas.

An oasis in Chelsea? \\n\\nMore than being a hidden gem, this place has good food. As for appetizers, I have tried the Chicken Satay, Turkey Turn Overs, Fried Egg Rolls and the Fresh Spring Rolls. My boyfriend and I are addicted to the Shrimp Pad Thai. He likes it SUPER spicy and I like it mild. They have never messed our orders up. The owner even recognizes our orders at this point. \\n\\nAs Peter R. already stated, they have a great eye for details! The water has cucumbers in it, which gives off that \\"spa\\" feel and the napkins are bound by twine. The energy at Fusion Foods is modern with a natural feel.

We were trying to save room for the warm cookie with ice cream and soy caramel sauce, but the boyfriend could not stop eating (we still ordered the cookie).\\n\\nOverall, everything (including the service) was exceptional.

They took tomato juice, formed it into jello (jelly) and served it with the salad.  Very creative and delicious.  For the main we both had the mushroom filet.  We had filet a few times while at Disney and this was on a totally different level.  The tenderness of the filet was like anything you would find at a 5 star restaurant.

They took the time to pleasantly explain the differences in roasts and helped get what I wanted as I got a coffee maker for xmas and didn't know what I was really doing yet. \\n\\nThe treat selection is a little lacking, and probably more deserving 4 stars on that front, but everything else is amazing so..

The service was friendly on a weeknight, but there's a strong element to the whole exercise that suggests that I am not cool enough to be there.\\n\\nThe food is interesting. It does incorporate some Chinese flavors like black bean paste and Sichuan pepper and Chinese ingredients like gai lan and tofu, but nothing about what's it doing really feels Chinese. The guy running the single wok station didn't seem to be doing much and the burner's roar was subdued - the wok toss, in a small pow-style handled wok, was a brief finish on dishes rather than a complete cooking method. That said, the fryer, skillfully wielded, played a big role in the dishes, as did a grill.\\n\\nFlavors came out strong, especially in the sauces for the mapo eggplant and the mix of greens in the special beef with broccoli. The char-crisp pieces of gai lan that were the \\"broccoli\\" were fantastic but few in number. The kung pao cauliflower was a thing of beauty. All of the food gave me the sense that it was designed to be shared over drinks; not a bad thing at all.

A team of young staff with aloof members. I felt no sense of urgency or common sense customer service etiquette. Aside from the previously mentioned drink mix up, we were also rudely interrupted and then severely ignored. Our obvious heated conversation was interrupted so our server could wipe down our table. Our table that was perfectly clean 20 minutes after we finished eating, but was now too dirty for us to talk over. We ended our discussion and went quiet, waiting for her to finish. How awkward. My only reasoning was that the table was heirloom and she didn't want any of the oil or grease from the food to soak in and ruin the finish. But even that is a stretch. Then when our original server when missing in action, we made every attempt to order another round of drinks from the only other server on the floor. He circled tables and found no one to help, yet was unable to hear us call or see us waving our arms for attention. We did this to the point that we were almost shouting. I am certain he could see us from his peripheral vision. He couldn't see us to order, yet was able to find us to drop off a drink later. Even then he seemed uninterested in serving. He tossed the coaster on to our table before setting down our drinks. This was all very frustrating. \\n\\n\\nWould I come back? - Yes. The building has personality, it is not just a North American establishment. You come for the vibe and stay for the nostalgia. We had a comfortable 2 hour sit in the heart of Gastown. Surrounded by the different lights, the different streets, and the different people. The food was ok, but the drinks were definitely better. You could spend hours and be unable to try them all. The service staff really take on the character of the venue its self. Modern in speech, but traditional in style; through lacking in the service department. \\n\\n\\nWould I recommend it? - Yes and No. Only for drinks. They are not known for their food. Don't come here hungry. The food was mediocre at best and with so few options, there is no guarantee that you will find something you'd like. Be sure to sit at the bar to ensure immediate drink ordering and service. It doesn't matter who you are or how much you order, there is no going the extra mile for customers here. At least I never got the chance to experience it. When it came time to pay they only allow cash or credit. Our server didn't bring the machine to the table, which is customary.

It has a solid selection of cannoli options - regular, chocolate dipped ends, straight-up chocolate - and a couple variations on the ricotta cannoli filling.  I have tried most of the options, and each is delicious, with a tasty and somewhat crunchy crust (rendered soft but still delicious if you leave your cannoli overnight in the fridge) and a creamy, flavorful filling.

With El Brasero, I had enormous faith that it would work in everyone's favor.\\n\\n\\nIt did not.  Sadly.\\n\\n\\nSide note: this was my first time going here, and I went after 9 pm.

I walk-up the steps and graciously take the offering and their two versions of salsa.  \\n\\nI walk gleefully, but stupidly, home, a mere seven blocks.

I went with a pretty large group so I was able to try a lot of different things, here are my thoughts!\\n\\nFirst, the things that were amazing: the gazpacho was PERFECT, wow I'm craving it now thinking about it. It was so light and crisp and there isn't a thing I would change about it. In fact, I would buy a vat if I could. \\n\\nAlso, the crispy mozzarella was different than your typical mozzarella sticks, the batter was extra crispy but not too heavy, definitely recommend it!  We also got two pizzas, one was great and one was okay at best. \\n\\nThe Spinach & Ricotta was soooo good. Perfect proportions of the toppings and the flavor was great. Now for the other pizza, this leads me in to the things that weren't so great. \\n\\nWe also got the Mean Green pizza that needed to be a little more green and a little more mean. The pizza was saturated in oil (gross) and just had pesto sauce and *maybe* a little cheese. If you have a pizza and call it mean, fulfill the name! I was hoping for a bunch of green veggies and a little less oil. \\n\\nWe also got the white bean dip and it couldn't have been more bland, everyone was literally passing around the salt and the red pepper just to try and get some flavor going on. They also only bring you a few pieces bread with a whole jar of dip- we had to ask for more bread 3 times, granted we were a large group with multiple orders, but come ON! \\n\\nIt was my best friends birthday, so we also got her a little desert and was kinda super boring too. It was the chocolate french toast cake, which sounded so intriguing and delicious. However, it was super boring. I'd say skip it due to the lack of flavor. \\n\\nLastly: the decor. Oh. Dear. Lord. No. It looks like a children's skating rink. It's literally hideous. Luckily the amazing food and service makes up for it. \\n\\nThis place has a bright future and I can't wait to go back again!

Crispy, buttery layer of pastry that houses insane amount of the ricotta cheese was a dream come true. The crispiness lasted more than 12 hours and in the fridge nonetheless. The filling was creamy and sweet, but not too sweet. It had a really nice consistent flavor from start to finish. I like big foods, but I could not finish this in one go. Which was a plus, since I savored all the little morsels as much as possible.

Another one of the dishes that I try to see if the dim sum is good.  \\nZha Leung Cheung Fun - Zha literally means \\"to fry\\". Leung means \\"two/pair\\". This consists of Yau Zha Gwai wrapped in a rice noodle roll. Yau Zha Gwai is like a fried dough. Also known as the \\"Chinese Fried Dough in Rice Noodle\\". \\nCha Siu Bau - Loosely means \\"roasted pork bun\\". Each dish has three pieces. \\nDan Taat - Dan means \\"egg\\" while Taat is an English loanword for \\"tart\\". Also known as the \\"Egg Tart\\". Each dish has three pieces. \\nLo Mai Gai -  Loosely means \\"Glutinous rice chicken\\". This consists of a large sticky rice ball mixed with chopped up mushrooms, tiny bits of chicken, wrapped up in a moist lotus leaf. One dish has two wrapped packets. This is also known as the \\"Rice wrapped in a lotus leaf wrap\\". \\nLo Bak Go - \\"Lo Bak\\" can mean \\"turnip\\" or \\"daikon\\". \\"Go\\" means cake. This consists of fried slices of . Each dish has three large slices. This is also known as the \\"Turnip Cake\\".\\n\\nThe Siu Mai and the Ha Gau were okay, decent at the best.

The Cha Siu Bau was decent, but it was different. Instead of the traditional white steamed bun, it was in a baked bun. The Lo Mai Gai was decent, but the girl next to me who also ate it thought it was strangely sweet, which is an unusual taste for a Lo Mai Gai.

My favorite aspects of Downtown Disney shopping wise is the Virgin Megastore and the Lego Imagination Center. Both unique and only found in Disney.

As for the more entertainment hungry Disney Quest is a virtual playground for kids and adults alike to try their hand at a wide variety of video and interactive games. House of Blues is also here where you can catch a show of any genre, just check the schedule for what's coming up.  Cirque de sole is another popular show on grounds that I can't wait to see myself.

Though we were unaware, the group I was with decided to give it a try. It was almost noon (for the uninitiated, this is breakfast time for those who work in the service industry), and whatever crowd there may have been had begun to dwindle.\\nIt took almost 15 minutes before we flagged down a server to bring us coffee and water, and almost 10 more before it arrived. We decided long before then to check out the buffet.  It was loaded with greasy options in heated trays. The staples, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, the like. In addition, there were some \\"lunch\\" dishes, most notably the pulled pork mac and cheese, a crusty option that may have witnessed the whole of the brunch service without being changed. The only redeeming factor of the hot buffet was the small child working the egg station. He makes a pretty good over-easy with a nice runny yolk. \\nAnyway, I tried most of the dishes available, with my perfect over easy eggs, white toast, soggy bacon, and a cup of yogurt being the bulk of my meal. I wasn't impressed, but i was't displeased until I saw the bill for my party of four had five digits. \\nI figured such a brunch buffet would be some kind of a special, but at $28 per person the only sense this could have been considered a deal is that the price you can pay per gallon of oil is slightly below market at the moment.\\nI would consider going again during a regular breakfast service, but the buffet was not an experience I would recommend."},{"name":"India Palace","address":"23 Union Sq","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Growing up in England where Indian food is the national dish I have to say this restaurant would not last five minutes in the UK.

Having gone on our first trip together and our honeymoon to New Mexico, we had to make a stop at Santo. The food lived up to our sentiment-laced expectations. \\n\\nWe were there for Father's Day brunch - around 11 am. While there were a good amount of people there, plenty of seats were available. The ambience and decor were pleasant. I've seen the style referred to as rustic, but it was much more contemporary. The wait staff was attentive and satisfying knowledgeable of New Mexican cuisine, which was proven when asked if we wanted red or green chiles or Chrismas(!) a mixture of the two. \\n\\nWe rarely comment on beverages, but the horchata and father's day special drink were too good to overlook. Horchata typically resembles cereal milk. Yummy? Sure. This version though tasted refreshingly healthy and was clearly made from scratch with just the right amount of spices it equaled the elevation of the area. The Father's Day breakfast was a sour brew and orange juice concoction. I could drink these every Sunday.\\n\\nSaving the best for last, the meal. We had the smothered breakfast burrito and huevos diablos. The burrito - Christmas style with added wild mushrooms - looked dazzling from the plate, and the tastes only surpassed the aesthetics. Every flavor came through on its own but also blended smoothly together. The homemade chorizo added to the diablo was the standout along with the asparagus. It gave the dish just the right amount of heat. Diablo comes with a crisp piece of bread, which is perfect to sop up the last of the sauce. \\n\\nWhether you are curious about or just craving New Mexican cuisine, Santo is worth the trip."},{"name":"The Cheesecake Factory","address":"100 Cambridgeside Pl","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I wish I could give zero stars. \\n\\nFirst off I love the food at the Cheesecake Factory, but the service here was so bad I am likely to never return.

For example, I could get almost 4x the Char Siu for $26 at a Chinese BBQ place. Sure it wouldn't be as tender, but there's a point when paying more doesn't justify having more tender bbq pork. The most bang for your buck would be the dan dan noodles. They were very unique with an egg and creamy sauce and there was a considerable amount of noodles. I have yet to find a good dan dan noodle place in Austin so I might just come back to order dan dan noodles to go. \\n\\nAfter paying over $20 for tea and those 5 dishes, I was barely full. I don't mind paying a lot for high quality Chinese food, but that's usually because there are expensive ingredients used or the cooking technique is very unique or labor intensive.

As a point of reference, oj costs $2.50 a glass. And for the $4.50, you get 1 tea bag. Another $4.50 if you want a second tea bag. The worst part is when I spoke to the manager, suggesting they may want to reconsider this policy and offer additional tea bags for that rediculous price, he said that was not likely to happen, and \\"that is why I don't drink tea\\". He did offer to remove the charge, but honestly that was not my point. Iced tea is free, and if you want to charge for hot tea, fine, but for $4.50, I think Ray's can still turn a profit and offer up a second tea bag for free.

I returned soon after to ask for a refund. I calmly explained to her that the drink was not very good and was very sour. She offered to make a substitute drink but I was not open to try another disappointment. After a few questions about what was wrong with my drink and repeating that I'd simply like my money back, I finally did. \\n\\nHonestly, I would never come back. The drinks are simply disgusting.

The rediculous part about this was that all you have to do is go to a rack and grab a bottle to bring to the table ... anyone can do that.  Then, the biggest, most shameful act was done by the manager.  When I made a comment about the delay in the wine, she went and got it herself.   HOWEVER, she came to the table with an open bottle of wine!! I am not a wine snob and I'm generally very forgiving, but ... you do not go to a nice restaurant to get poor, slow service ...

It was Black Friday Eve or black eye Friday eve. Most places were shut until about 6pm thru 1am, so minimum wage workers who keep big business afloat might just get a lie - in before the insatiable dollar grabbing would begin again. It was crowded on arrival. It seemed no less so as we left. Parking was difficult and free. This work in progress place is the latest incarnation of a reformed, expanded Downtown Disney, which itself had previous Dismal lives. It's an overpriced entertainment, shopping & dining space with over processed, industrially made food and tons of artificiality including man - made lagoons. There's a seeming unlimited tonnage of Chinese and other third world made, mostly plastic tat, with stuff that likely cost 5 or 6 cents apiece or less proffered for $8 or $9 apiece plus tax. They don't even blush scrounging your hard earned bucks and it's all liberally sprinkled with Disney panache. Let's face it folks there are few big businesses on earth that can fake sincerity nearly as well as these girls and guys do. Starbucks, the coffee purveyor of choice or really the highest bidder serves the usual breakfast & lunch offerings with adult wine & dine evenings. I'm a fan of the chain but even I wouldn't stand in their queue. There's a crab shack on a lagoon designed as an old galleon, a burger style place set within a huge, impressive dinosaur structure. Planet Hollywood looks like a rusted old revenant, now well and truly out of place and a Rainforest cafe that nearly looks modern. We looked at Mr Puck's lunch menus. We were unimpressed but his mark up isn't as outrageous as the omnipresent Disney tat. We looked at an overpriced Peruvian restaurant. We popped into an 'Irish pub' just as disappointedly plastic as much of the rest of the place. While on plastic there's an impressive imaginarium in the form of the Lego store, invented by a Danish carpenter with these millions of pieces likely made in Mexico by high paid workers on 30 hour week pensionable contracts (I'm being facetious). The Lego area was stuffed with kids using their heads, unlike most of the adults. We also popped into an overpriced bakery with less customer floor space than a disabled restroom specialising in products made with corn syrup to add volume and soften texture (think cookies) and a variety of chemically engineered sugars chucked in for cheapness and sweetness. There was a delightful choir of young people from a school singing Christmas carols beautifully. Their teacher was rightly proud. It was surreal for us to hear them singing about sleigh bells and snow in 30 degrees. I read that there's 3 areas: West Side, the Landing and the Marketplace; maybe I'm more stupid that I thought as it seemed all marketplace to me, plus tax. We were also really disappointed that the water taxis were not operating as we could have left more quickly. Worse still we had walked most of the way to the pier only to find this out: there should have been a sign up much sooner.

The discount brought the price to about $150/night, compared to their average price of close to $200/night.  Of course, when we use the code provided and try to book the room, the code is not valid.  I had to involve the bride and her husband to contact the hotel as they were less than helpful.

I really want to like this place but we had a bad experience.  We sat down at outdoor seating and ordered two beers.  The beers came quick and we put our order in when the beers came; 1 app and 2 entrees.  The app (wings) came out reasonably quick.  From there, things went down hill.  We waited over an hour for our entrees at which point I went up front to ask what was up.  Some kind of mix up, they apologized and re-took our order.  We waited another 20 minutes and our food came out, a buffalo chicken mac and cheese and the veggie risotto.  The buffalo mac was great but we had ordered the risotto without parm because of my fiancee's lactose intolerance and it was of course on there.  We know there's butter and other dairy in it and she does take a lactaid but its not a magic pill - you still have to no over do it if you don't want to get sick.  So she couldn't eat her whole dish for fear of getting sick.  We mentioned this when we got the check, and the waitress (very kind and attentive) went to talk to the manager.  The result?  Nothing, just came back with the check, not even an apology or anything.\\n\\nLook, I get that sometimes mix-ups happen at restaurants.  We weren't too mad.  But this place didn't own up to it.  The restaurant was well staffed so I can only conclude that the manager kind of sucks. ANY gesture to show their owning up to forgetting our order and then messing up would have prevented this review.\\n\\nAlso, RE: the other reviewers that mentioned flat beer.  Our pours weren't as fresh as we would have liked either.  I suspect this bar has more taps than it has the customer volume to handle the selection they are trying to offer.  This results in taps that get flat because they're not going through inventory fast enough.  It's a pretty common problem in Boston.  A new pub tries to be trendy and offer a good selection, but they don't get the traffic to justify the number of kegs they have open.

I am also not the biggest fan of some of the stranger flavors, I don't think that they are executed well for a cannoli, I think because the ricotta has such a distinctive flavor it is hard to mask with other things (especially if they are only dipped on the end). I think there are better cannolis to be found in the North End- I like Modern Pasteries, but I really think Bova is a hidden gem (and open 24 hours!). That being said, Mike's is a Boston landmark. Even though it's not my favorite, I still recommend it to all my friends that visit Boston; Mike's is more a quintessential Boston experience that a dessert shop.

I think the servers split the tips but some of the servers bring the rest of them down.  The food is adequately done I suppose, although unless I'm having hairy potatoes I usually don't like having fish with my taters. Fish like salmon ends up making the taters taste a bit funny, not fishy, not starchy, just funny and not in a good way so I'd skip the salmon hash.  I had the meatloaf sandwich here and for $8 I'd expect it to have more meatloaf than the sliver they gave me.  Hell for that much dough and that thin a slice it should've been foie gras to warrant the price.  Not too bad though, it went down pretty smooth, I'd probably be more upset if I hadn't eaten before I got here.   Seems to have a pretty adequately stocked bar which is nice.  Honestly though, it wouldn't be too difficult to make this stuff at home for a fraction of the price.  Come on people, all you need to do to make food that tastes like it's from a nice restaurant is use fresh ingredients and not skimp on the butter and cream.  If you go just b/c you don't feel like serving yourself and cleaning the dishes, a complicated undertaking depending on the menu, get your kids to earn back the future paychecks they'll be spending to go to college right?"},{"name":"Le Cellier Steakhouse","address":"1510 N Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Continuing our 2013, \\"Around the World in a wheelchair tour\\" the only reason I give Le Cellier 4 stars and not 5 is due to the poor interior design coming from a newbie wheelchair user.

Booked it finally thru Expedia.  \\nWhen we arrived early at the hotel , we were greeted with a valet  who took our bags and directed us to the front desk , Our Room was ready early , 2pm instead of 4pm. \\nUpon checking in we met our bell hop , Charles, extremely nice & professional.  We were brought to our nice , clean , good sized room on the 30th floor , the view was great.  Beds were very comfortable, hot showers, and heating system worked good., room walls VERY thin, could hear neighbors phones beeping and peoples conversations, Television definitely needs some updating , our picture was less than perfect. Hotel had a pool & hot tub that my daughter loved !  Overall all our amenities met our expectations. \\nWe had a great day visiting the Prudential Center, shopping & having lunch . We had dinner at Champions which is inside the Copley Marriott . I wasn't sure what to expect from a sports bar/restaurant inside a hotel . But it was great , food & service was amazing . \\nThe one thing about our stay at this hotel that did NOT meet my expectations was at 3:30am we were awoken by a fire alarm , a very scary moment for both of us. A loud blaring alarm , Not sure what to do we followed what our neighbors were doing and exited thru the stairwell , down 30 flights of stairs . When we reached the ground floor there was no one visible that worked for the Marriott , a hotel full of people standing in the cold waiting to be told what to do and no one , nothing . A few moments later an announcement played saying the Boston Fire dept had fixed the issue ( never told what issue, but heard from other guest that an exhaust fan over heated and set off alarms) and we could return to our rooms .  But the elevators were out of service due to alarm ... We waited ONE LONG hour to return to our rooms , we were finally able to use a service elevator at 4:30am.!! ... But never saw anyone from hotel other than someone handing out waters. \\nThe Marriott is not to blame for the fire alarm but they are to be blamed for the pure lack of management & control of what happened after the alarm. They dropped the ball on this one .  This alone would make me think twice about returning to this hotel . Hopefully they work on \\"what to do after a Fire Alarm \\"...

I've only been here once under their new ownership, but I was really impressed. I ordered the Pad Kee Mao noodles with vegetables and tofu, and the somtum salad, and enjoyed both dishes very much. If you've been to this restaurant under the previous ownership, then you know that the food was barely edible, and barely affordable. Under new ownership, as well as a new name (previously KAC or something like that), they've really stepped up their game. Though the prices are still a bit high, ($8.50 for lunchtime noodles, whereas I prefer $6/$7) it's pretty standard for the area. This restaurant is definitely full of lunchtime \\"meeting\\" people form the surrounding offices. The only Thai people I saw there were the people working there. \\n\\nSomething really interesting about this place, and also reminiscent of my other top Pad Kee Mao restaurant, Baan Thai, is the spiciness rating system. Their scale consists of mild, medium, hot, extra hot, and Thai spicy.  My friend and I both ordered extra hot for the noodles, and just hot for the somtum. Our server explained to us that from a range of 1-10, with 10 as the spiciest, extra hot is a 7/8 and hot is 6/7. Wow, well let me tell you, the somtum was extremely hot, barely edible for us. We both love spicy food, but this was too much, and definitely not a 6/7 on the spiciness scale. The Pad Kee Mao was just as spicy as well, but at least the plentiful veggies and tofu helped appease the spice. The server offered to add more sauce to our somtum to lessen the spiciness, for no extra charge, so we took her up on her offer. I'm really glad she offered that, because we were able to taste and enjoy the flavor of the salad. Aside from the skewed spiciness levels, both dishes were delicious. The portions were reasonable to large, and hearty with veggies. The noodles in the Pad Kee Mao did not fall apart immediately, were immersed in savory sauce, and even had a bit of a crisp to them. They were really cooked perfectly. I would recommend this restaurant to people who work in the area, don't want to go to the carts, and like Thai food.

I could see we were joined by the typical downtown lunch crowd: groups of employees from the surrounding businesses interspersed with the usual crop of blue hairs. We settled in, and our hostess said that our waiter So-and-So would be right with us. Oh, God. Not So-and-So. I *know* So-and-So...and So-and-So knows me.\\n\\nIt actually wasn't as awkward as I expected. As long as neither of us said anything, my father wouldn't know the difference. We began with a cup of the crawfish gumbo, which I absolutely adore. I'm giving serious thought to making an entire bowl of this my entree when I return; it is always that delicious. \\n\\nI almost ordered one of the featured \\"Fish of the Days\\", until the Cobb Remoulade salad (greens with remoulade, grilled jumbo shrimp, cheddar, tomatoes, and fried oysters) caught my eye. I hadn't had fried oysters since Atlantic Fish in Boston. That put this dish over the top. Both dad and my brother opted for the catfish, as they usually do.\\n\\nLunch conversation consisted of my dad and brother discussing dad's coworkers and the future of state agencies (boooring...), while my major contribution was unsuccessfully attempting to steer the conversation towards tidbits I had read on Perez Hilton, as well as avoiding eye contact with our waiter. The salad was excellent, although it could have used just a few more of the huge grilled shrimp on the side. The fried oysters were hot and crispy, and easily the star of the ensemble.\\n\\nOh, and So-and-So did me a favor and gave me cash for the valet, which I then could add onto his tip. I chuckled to myself that it would be off the charts on the dick-o-meter if I decided to leave like, a dollar. I'd never do that...just the thought amused me..\\n\\nIn summary, the food did not disappoint for a third time in a row, and other than a fleeting reference to servicing my car, I was largely off the hook. If Gumbo's downtown had a softening effect on my father, then you better believe I'll be requesting this place faster than I can spend my paychecks."},{"name":"Punjabi Dhaba","address":"225 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I haven't had a lot of Indian cuisine before other than the buffet variety - but Dhaba served up some tasty chicken when I was there for the first time last week.  \\n\\nThe problem with the place is definitely the wait and ordering process.

If you're curious to try this, once fine, Atlanta institution, don't be; just go to Bacchanalia.  Opened in 1976, Nikolai's Roof offers the promise of French-Russian cuisine in an elegant setting. Unfortunately, in 2015, it delivers subpar execution in an environment that, diplomatically, can be best described as \\"ghetto Hampton Inn.\\"   The service is slow and, largely, indifferent.  When my girlfriend and I dined here tonight, we had the pleasure of being seated 20+ minutes late for our reservation, waiting ~15 minutes for water, and waiting nearly that long to have our drink order taken and poured.   The food service that ensued subsequently was similarly \\"constipated.\\"  To make matters worst, the server seemed more interested in leaving our table and taking away our flatware within a nanosecond of placing our plates down versus making certain all was prepared adequately or if we were actually done with your course.  He literally took my foie gras between bites. This just made the eons between waiting for the next course (and its complimentary excuses for delay) all the longer.  It's said that \\"the best things come to those who wait.\\"  In the case of Nikolai's Roof, that's patently not true. The quality of the seafood is solidly B minus.  I can't comment on the substantive meats as, at 10:50, after ordering the six course chef's tasting for an 8:45 reservation and only receiving three courses, we threw in the towel.  We converted our check to √† la carte, tipped our server 20% (just to establish that WE were not the problem), and took our second bottle of wine home to enjoy - albeit nearly $800 dollars poorer.  The same investment of time and funds at Bacchanalia would pay off in huge dividends for the local Atlantans of more discriminate taste.  Luckily, for this place, it can remain afloat on the ignorant dollars of a steady stream of hotel patrons looking for sophomoric service and mediocre fare delivered in a recently renovated venue that looks like a nouveau riche coke head's apartment from 1994.\\n\\nQuality:B minus\\nService: C to C minus\\nAmbiance: D"},{"name":"Sushi A-Go-Go","address":"4917 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I have been on a trailer food kick lately and finally got around to Sushi A-Go-Go last weekend.\\n\\nSo I call in an order to pick up, and the short version is, I ordered 4 rolls and a cup of miso soup for only $25.

As a native Texan I was hesitant to try \\"fancy\\" style BBQ.  I'm used to taking trips out to the Salt Lick and sweating on a picnic table while inhaling large amounts of meat.  This place is a bit fancier (enter sarcasm here) so I dressed for the occasion.  We could smell the BBQ aroma from the parking garage across the street!  A group of girls and I got together here for a celebratory birthday happy hour on a Wednesday.  Unfortunately, you can't sit anywhere in the restaurant and get the happy hour prices or food, you have to sit directly at the bar or at the \\"bar designated\\" tables if you can find one!  A little lame but we managed to find a seat upstairs.  This is not the place to find cheap, strong happy hour drinks.  The regular prices of the cocktails were between $9-$12 each and the happy hour price is only $2 off, and the cocktails are about 5 oz.  The food however is a slammin' deal with about 10-12 options that are half off.  We ordered the charcuterie plate and the green chile queso for appetizers.  The charcuterie plate had a nice assortment of duck proscuitto, fois gras, salami, stinky cheeses and spreads.  The more elevated palates at my table really enjoyed it, I'm more of a queso than a fois gras type of gal.    I can say that some of the slices of baguette were nearly burned while others were almost completely un-toasted.  The green chile queso was good, but had hardly any green chile in it.  The tortilla chips were some of the best house-made tortilla chips I've ever had! For my meal I got the chopped brisket sandwich with herbed waffle fries for $4!!!!!  You can't even get a McDonald's meal for that price anymore!  The sandwich was a regular size (not sized down because of the special happy hour price - major plus) and came complete with a toasted bun and jalapeno/onion relish.  The chopped brisket was super tasty, not too saucy and not too fatty.  The herbed waffle fries were delicious.  Other plates ordered at the table were the chickpeas (awesome) and two BBQ plates, one with brisket and one with pork ribs.  I tasted the ribs and although they had good flavor they were on the chewy side, and any true Texas gal knows that a really good pork rib should fall off the bone.

I knew I loved the place when I saw one of the staff, on her knees, in front of the wine rack deep in prayer. Having worked in the restaurant business for 30+ years I could totally identify. I appreciated her good sense in facing the bottles of Ch. Margaux, Ch. Haut Brion and Mouton Rothschild (all 1995).

Hey, you want me to take a dump in a box and mark it a CANNOLI, I will...I've been to Mike's Pastry!\\n\\nTwo things (modified Tommy Boy monologues aside): 1-Fresh Cannoli's can be determined by the fact that the creme filling is inserted upon ordering, right before consumed....these were not.  2-Fresh Cannoli's usually have a fresh dough (Fresh: warm crispy and chewy and baked goodness flavor)...these were not.\\n\\nRather they were stale and poorly made.  I won't even mention the specifics of the cannolis I have had in Italy, but lets just say there are much better ones to be had Italy and US.  \\n\\nThe Gelatto, and I don't even know why I'm doing this, was maybe the worst I've had.  The Lemon was blocks of ice....I was like those frozen lemonades that you get at theme parks that come in the cardboard cups with the wooden tongue dispenser spoons.  We also asked for Cantaloupe and they gave us Watermelon which didn't taste like Watermelon at all and was perhaps the exact opposite texture as the Lemon...instead of blocks of ice...it was basically melted upon arrival.\\n\\nAs I always say, people love to be a part of something....the trouble is, sometime it matters not to people whether that something is good or not.  A friend once made fun of me for wearing a pair of Crocs.

We were back at Merrit's table with a party of six including some serious foodies... all were impressed by their sommelier (wine steward) who is very knowledgeable and she does an excellent job helping choose a great wine to go with their meal in an informative and fun way.  On another visit, when I was disappointed that Pineapple Bread Pudding was not one of the daily deserts, they advised that if you let them know when you make your reservation that you want the Pineapple Bread Pudding they can buy the necessary fresh ingredients for it when they go to the various produce markets.  Now with some advanced planning I can get this beyond phenomenal desert more often.

It's strange because the first time we went we were able to make a reservation for a large group, but when I tried to make a reservation for another group of a similar size soon after, they told me that they don't hold reservations or have room for groups of that size. So that was a bit confusing?\\n\\nThe first time I went, the food was pretty good... good enough that I would want to make a second visit. Their ribeye special was amazing that night. Some of the other dishes were either hit or miss to be honest. The parker rolls were okay but the sandwiches they had were pretty good. The service was great that night as well.\\n\\nThe second time I went, in Feb 2018, it was.... not the same experience. The service was also great, and we were a difficult table because we had to keep ordering more food because we didn't realize how hungry we were so a plus for that. But the food that night... was... not great. The fried rice we got was so salty, like I was starving but couldn't eat it cause it was that salty. Everything else was meh and not memorable with the exception of the boar pasta. That was so good.... the pasta texture and sauce was just perfect. \\n\\nIt was my friend's birthday so they were kind of enough to put a candle in a churro ice cream sandwich for my friend. When it came, we ordered a second one without trying because we knew it wouldn't be enough for six people. We immediately regretted ordering a second one because the churro was terrible. It tasted like bread... it was not sweet or anything like a churro. When the second came, we realized it was because the first one didn't have the cinnamon sugar on it.\\n\\nAll in all, I am willing to try this place again because the first time was a good experience and I could believe the kitchen had an off night."},{"name":"Hello Chicken","address":"5295 Buford Hwy Ne","city":"Doraville","stars":"3.5","text":"Hello Chicken took over the cursed Korean restaurant location. Before that was Lee's Tofu House. Before that was Korean Garden. Before that was... I can't remember.\\n\\nI wonder if it is the same owner as those previous restaurants? Maybe they'll go through every Korean fad until something sticks. This time, it's KFC, Korean Fried Chicken.\\n\\nKFC seems like a growing trend these days. New ones are opening up, and other Korean restaurants are starting to offer it on their menus. Well, let's see how Hello Chicken fares. \\n\\nThey have KFC with four different flavors: Soy garlic, sweet and spicy, extra spicy, and plain. I tried all 4 styles. The chicken comes with potato wedges that's drenched in the same sauce the chicken comes with. \\n\\nMy favorite was the sweet and spicy. Although that was more sweet than spicy. \\n\\nThe extra spicy was spicy, not super hot. But it depends on how well you can take your heat. I thought it was the right amount of spice for me. \\n\\nThe plain was too plain and boring. It did have the traditional KFC flavor though with seasoned and oiled skin.\\n\\nThe Soy Garlic had an interesting soy and garlic flavor. I wasn't sure if I liked it. It tasted okay. Some people liked it a lot.\\n\\nThe chicken itself wasn't good. There were a lot of dry pieces. Also. the skin had a soggy texture. I expect KFC to have a nice, crispy, crunchy skin--even if they have sauce all over. I have eaten KFC where it was drenched in whatever flavor (sweet and spicy), and it was still crunchy on the outside and moist and succulent on the inside. I don't know what magic they used to accomplish that, but Hello Chicken didn't have that magic. \\n\\nI could do without the potato wedges. Since they're covered in the same sauce as the chicken, it looks like a piece of chicken. I would be disappointed if I bit into that instead of chicken. I dunno, it almost seems like a cost-saving tactic from them. It seems like you're getting more food for your money, but it's just potatoes, not chicken. \\n\\nI also tried their ddukbogi. It tasted fine. Although, I think it needed more dduk. It seemed too skimpy to me. \\n\\nThe restaurant was burning up inside.

It's genuinely upsetting to see, especially when the location has so much potential. \\n\\nUpon walking in, conflicting signs are hung in just about every place you look for direction. The most obvious is the first sign upon walking into the restaurant - it says to seat yourself. We chose to veer left into the restaurant as there was a TV playing the Blazers game in the section we wanted to sit in. We noticed a line was formed at the slices display as we walked back, but figured it was for those who wanted take out (as the sign read hanging above said counter.) There were two tables finishing up their meal back in the section where we wanted to sit, so we caught what looked to be a server's (at the very least a busser's) eye. We asked for a couple of menus for dining in, and with an incredibly snarky tone and expression, she said \\"yeah... get in line.\\" So \\"seat yourself\\" and \\"take out only\\" - the most basic forms of your restaurant concept - were contradictory. Not to mention that said snarky waitress was dressed like it was a housewarming for a barnyard. \\n\\nThe idea before going in to Blackbird was that we'd get some drinks and a pizza to wait out the storm, but we were not only shied away from service, but denied. Because we were rattled and confused, we hadn't even had the chance to review the slices to decide what we wanted. Feeling pressured being up next at the cashier's counter, we each just ordered one slice of cheese pizza and a beer, which was easily $20 less per person than what we would have spent if we were given menus. When we got up to the counter to pay, Barnyard was whispering to her too-good-for-life coworker and, after realizing we were right there, she skulked away. I'm a girl too; I know what it looks like when people are talking about you. Too, my boyfriend even asked if he could start a tab so we could get another round, but she gave him a number and didn't address the question at all. \\n\\nWhen we were through, the line was way too long to imagine standing in it to face either of those two again for a draft beer that is just as accessible anywhere else in town. \\n\\nAs always, the pizza is mediocre and the atmosphere is confused between a punk skater hang out and a kid-friendly neighborhood pizza joint. It's frustrating that these clearly unhappy employees can't find better ways to spend their time than to embarrass customers and drive business away. \\n\\nYelp can be a destructive tool for those who are abusive, but rest assured, this was an exceptional experience."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We came here on our last day of vacation.

The cannoli was fantastic and fresh--the true flavor of the ricotta cheese came out ever so subtly to balance the sweetness.

It was perfect--an ideal mix of of cake-like and fudge-like texture.  \\n\\nI really wish I could sit here and write out some savory description of both dishes, but I devoured each of them so fast, I simply can't recall in that much detail.

At Seito Sushi I just had three of them.\\n\\nI returned for the second time since calling Seito Sushi 'meh, i've had better' with 2-Stars. But on these latest two visits I was reminded in a wonderful way how fresh and delicious everything is, how extraordinary the service is, and how many, many options you have at Seito that you just don't have at other Asian restaurants.\\n\\nLet's start with what you can enjoy at Seito that you can't find at other Asian and especially Japanese places:\\n\\n1. A breed of real wasabi root, grated finely -- not merely the green-colored horseradish paste found almost everywhere else.  Yes, it's a $3 extra or whatever, but so what? It's marvelous in flavor and texture\\n\\n2. Specials that appear off-menu that are highlighted, presented, and recommended by knowledgeable servers.\\n\\n3. An Espresso Machine (!) so you can enjoy your cappuccino, espresso, or latte after dinner. And because they have a full bar, they'll bring you agave sweetener syrup.  Try finding espresso at a Japanese restaurant anywhere else. :-)\\n\\n---\\nMy perfect moments last night were three:\\n\\n1. Seito had a bluefin tuna belly that's so fatty and melty, it's as good a grade of Toro as one could hope for.  It was inventively served crudo with puffed, toasted rice garnish and lime.  (I added the real wasabi...  Easily the single best sashimi I have eaten in the last 25 years, and maybe ever.  They don't always have it, but when they do, it is not to be missed.  Type of crudo presentation will vary by chef but hard to go wrong here. Perfect moment complimented with a Sauvignon Blanc from France.\\n\\n2. Grilled Angus slices over a charcoal grill at my table.  Previously Seito mostly offered hot rocks to grill on, and that didn't work because rocks don't stay hot.  But the charcoal grill is marvelous, and a quick wipe with sesame oil means nothing sticks.  Whoa, back up... ANGUS you said?  Not Wagyu?  Angus?  Yes, Creekstone Farms Kansas City Angus is prime-grade and so well marbled, it's much, much more tender than most Wagyu -- Seito is clever to figure this out.  It's pre-seasoned lightly so you can grill each slice with an little onion ring on top and the result is wonderful.  Perfect moment.\\n\\n3. Perfect moment with a beautifully made cappuccino and a sidecar of espresso, some agave sweetener, and a nice VSOP Cognac. So wonderful to have coffee and Cognac after dinner sitting outside looking down palm-lined New Broad Street toward the lighted fountain and lake. \\n\\n---\\nSeito has relationships with fishing partners and distributors allowing it to bring you unique choices.  I'd previously interpreted this as a hit-or-miss problem, but it's really not.  The menu has enough good staple items on it that it's great if they don't have your special, and, well, more special if they do.  For example, not every visit will they have Black Tip Shark, but they did last night, and it was spiced beautifully, served over a fun succotash that was spiced so much more nicely than grandma's succotash ever was.  :-)\\n\\nService is really outstanding, and I had forgotten this, along with several other wonderful aspects when I wrote my last review.  I was reminded of it these past two visits by relentless care and very carefully-chosen recommendations from all categories.\\n\\nPresentation at Seito isn't overly frilly on all the dishes, but it doesn't need to be.  It's attractive and puts the attention on the food.  The pictures here tell that story.  You'll get hungry looking, and you'll be very satisfied when you come in an dine.\\n\\nI'm happy I've revisited twice since two-starring Seito (carefully, and with explanation).  But I overlooked a lot of marvelous things when doing so, and I wrongly set up a false comparison to a more \\"authentic\\" Japanese experience such as at Hanamizuki.  Seito is not Hanamizuki (a staple of dependable Japanese favorites, but far less creative).\\n\\nYes, Amura is higher-end.  But Seito is vastly more beautiful, clean, and elegant inside.  Seito's menu has more fusion in it, and it has more non-Japanese Asian choices, but without the sprawling menu of a place like Amura.\\n\\nSeito really is extraordinary.  I'm seriously headed back within the week.  Why not?  It's not cheap, but it's a very good value for the high quality you'll enjoy."},{"name":"Mi Island Restaurant","address":"2137 N Courtenay Pkwy, Ste 28","city":"Merritt Island","stars":"4.5","text":"Found this on our way to Kennedy space center.

Please hear me out. My wife and I dined here after a day at Epcot during our honeymoon. With many people recommending this restaurant, we were both very excited and had made prior reservations. The first problem was we were seated so close to another party that I could have reached over and taken a bite of her hamburger. The overall atmosphere was also very dark and dingy. \\n\\nWe started with the house poutine. When it arrived the waitress poured the red wine reduction over the fries table side which was a nice touch. However, the fries were overly rich and extremely salty. Very difficult to eat. We both took 1 or 2 bites and said the same thing, SALTY.  I ordered the NY strip and my wife ordered the Filet. My steak arrived with multiple garnishes on top which is never needed when eating a good piece of meat. When I first cut into my steak, no steam, no juices, nothing. I took my first bite and my steak was cold in the middle and just lacked flavor. My wife said the same about her Filet. \\n\\nOverall, our bill was about $130 for 2 steak dinners and a order of poutine. Normally, I wouldn't care about the price, but the meal was just horrible. The steaks just had no seasoning and no flavor. I guess the stacks and stacks of garnishes are suppose to make up for this.

And I can't find a single negative to report about Lambert's. Service was friendly from the moment we walked in until we left. And the food  . . .  my God . . .  the food is simply amazing at brunch. About half of their offerings are \\"serve your own damn self\\" buffet style on Sunday mornings. That includes the BBQ. \\n\\nI am pleased to report my cuts of brisket were moist and melt in your mouth flavorful. The ribs had a delish sweet crusty coating (honey? Michelle's review says maple) on them that put me over the top. I loved their take on the \\"que.\\" Sadly though, I am not sure I would make the effort to come over here to a spendy place for only BBQ. We'll see what the future holds. If I can talk my father over here during his next visit, we won't have to open up my coffers!\\n\\nOther fine samplings off the buffet included a very gourmet looking potato salad and a melon/fruit salad that had mint leaves mixed in to flavor it. Just brilliant. Never would I have considered that. Jalapenos, onions and pickles are next to the meat. Amazing pickled jalapenos! There were some pastries too, but I didn't touch those. I had to save room for the \\"made to order\\" menu! Dr. Fredo had some cheesy grits he claimed to be the best ever.\\n\\nThe made to order menu delivers on all cylinders! The eggs benedict with it's jalapeno hollandaise was heaven on a plate. The biscuit and gravy was wonderful. Gravy was BBQ brisket based, I believe. But the coup de grace to my hunger pangs came in the form of a pancake. This pancake was absolutely the finest pancake that's ever been in my mouth and quickly erased all doubts I may have harbored about this brunch actually being worth $28. Real whipped cream, blue berries, raspberries, black berries, fancy real maple syrup . . . and a pancake not burned but cooked to perfection. I am not exaggerating when I tell you readers that I got a bit misty eyed. My life is now complete. \\n\\nBefore I run and ponder this pancake a bit more, you should know the drinks here are stiff! These are hangover cures, folks. I had a vodka heavy Sanchez garnished with jalapenos and caper berries. Never had caper berries before and what do you know . . .  they taste like big capers! This was a drink that put even more hair on my chest and face and back and feet and well . . . let's stop there. Dr. Fredo ordered a gin drink of which I had to finish half. If you imbibe, don't leave without ordering one of these cocktails. And if you can't finish it, give me a buzz.\\n\\nThe key to enjoying Lambert's is to just take it easy. Don't keep ordering and filling up your plate to stuff yourself to whatever point you might deem is $28 worth or more.

I got the ricotta filling, and my friend got the whipped cream.  In my opinion, this was the perfect cannoli - the filling was a good, thick consistency, and the perfect sweetness.

That offered a view of the patio and their gorgeous Christmas tree, as well as a big screen TV tuned to ESPN.  It also afforded a bit of peace and quiet, something I was really looking forward to after a hectic day.\\n\\nExcellent service was provided by my waiter Jarret, who exhibited extreme patience and helpfulness as I sorted through the menu.  I finally settled on an appetizer of the fried mushrooms at a happy hour price ($4.95), The Works burger upgraded with Kobe beef and onion rings ($10.69) and a dessert of pecan pie a la mode ($4.70).  Jarret had recommended the appetizer selection and the burgers as specialties of the house, so I went with his recommendation.\\n\\nThe service provided by Jarret was attentive and certainly worthy of a five-star rating.  As hungry as I was after skipping two meals, anything that was even halfway tasty should have \\"popped\\", but, sadly, most of the food did not.\\n\\nWhile the fried mushrooms were plentiful for one and good, I wouldn't say they are exceptional, and the portion size would have been marginal for two.  Jarret did present them with standard ranch dip, but also offered a honey jalapeno ranch dip; unfortunately, the dip was the same consistency as their salad dressing, so it did not coat the 'shrooms particularly well, and made more of a mess than it was worth.\\n\\nThe same is to be said of the hamburger, which was a major disappointment considering the base price and the upgrade.  In fact, had I not been watching Kobe Bryant on the TV while waiting for my meal, I would have thought he made it into the burger.  In short, I could discern no difference from the upgrade.  I never tasted (or saw) a single jalapeno, which comes standard on the burger, so I will have to assume none were harmed in making my meal.\\n\\nThe hand-breaded onion rings that caught my eye on the Austin Chronicle \\"Best of\\" banner from 2007 were OK, but they were not the \\"second coming\\" experience that was promised and indeed could have been rivaled by their Sysco brethren.   The pecan pie a la mode was warmed as I had requested, and it exceeded my expectations by a small margin.  The vanilla ice cream was reasonably portioned and served on the side.\\n\\nOut the door with tax before tip, the tab totaled $22.02, and that was with a beverage choice of water.  With a generous tip for a fastidious Jarret's incredible waited service, I was just two ticks south of $30 for dinner for one and no alcohol.    Admittedly, it was a lot of food, but it just wasn't worth the premium I paid for it.  I'm teetering between three and four stars, and I'll give the nod to Jarret as he ultimately kept this outing from facing its Waterloo.\\n\\nSummary:\\nService:          Five stars\\nAtmosphere: Four stars\\nFood:              Three stars\\nValue:             Two stars"},{"name":"Rockmill Tavern","address":"503 S Front St, Ste 100","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"What an amazing place.

So, I decided to go there for the first time this past Sunday.\\n\\nIt wasn't hard at all to get a 6:30pm reservation and the restaurant wasn't busy when we got there.  We were greeted and the staff was friendly upon our arrival.  Initially, we were seated in a weird table in the middle of the restaurant which had terrible lighting.  However, the staff was very nice about moving us to another table.\\n\\nThe service was good.  Our server checked up on us often enough but not too much to be annoying.  The food came out soon after we ordered it.  Checks came fast\\n\\nThe food on Sunday, however, was sub-par.  The crispy calamari was way too breaded for our taste, and it tasted dry and chewy.  For entrees, our table ordered a chicken sandwich, two strip burgers, and a chilled seafood tower.  The temperature on the burgers were supposed to be medium, but they came out rare to medium-rare.  The chicken sandwich was dry and a bit under seasoned.  The tower, which cost $24, ended up being less of a tower and more of a plate.  It consisted of 4 raw oysters, about 8 peel & eat shrimp, 2 shrimp cocktail and lump crab meat in the center.  Some of the Chef Specialties looked appetizing (e.g., the low country shrimp n' grits, double cut pork chop), but it struck me as odd that the price didn't include any side items.\\n\\nThe steaks here were priced between $17 to $36, depending on your cut of choice, and are served with your choice of starch.  However, given how far off the temperatures of our burgers were, I don't have a lot of confidence that the temperature of the steaks would be very accurate.\\n\\nGenerally, I've been very pleased with the H2S restaurants.  Even though the service was good at Strip, I thought that it didn't make up for the pricy sub-par food, and for that reason, I probably won't return."},{"name":"Sala and Betty","address":"5201 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"First I'll day service here is awesome!

Love the ambiance and historic nature of the building & interior of the space. The downstairs dining room where I sat was a bit dark due to the window placement but it certainly wasn't lacking in energy or charm.  \\n\\nOne is a lonely number but a girl's got to eat. I came here for lunch by myself and I ordered the two meat plate for lunch. Every BBQ joint I visit, I always get the pulled pork and will ask the server's recommendation for a second. Today I was encouraged to try the brisket. I obliged and order the baked beans & jicama slaw as my sides. \\n\\nThe food came out almost immediately. I was pleasantly surprised since I was hungry but questioned how long everything was sitting out in the kitchen.  I envisioned their meat baking under some sort of heatlamp or in a warming draw. Then one of the sous chefs pick up an ice cream scoop of my selection and slaps meat on the plate. Not saying this happened but it definitely crossed my mind. \\n\\nI had asked my server if the pulled pork came with any sauces and he let me know it was Carolina style. I specifically asked if it the vinegar was overpowering? No he said, it was enough. I thought like most Carolina BBQ I've had, it was going to be a vinegar mop sauce but it wasn't. What was served on top of the pulled pork was an orange, vinegar style sauce. I immediately kicked myself for not asking if I could have sauce on the side. Took my first bite of pulled pork and the vinegar burned my palate. The rest of the meal, all I could taste was vinegar. I was mad but rather than sending it back, I scraped off the thick, orange goo - aka - Carolina Sauce and plowed through my meal as fast as I good. At this point I wanted sustenance, not taste which is what I was anticipating.\\n\\nOnce I removed as much orange goo from my pork, I was surprised to realize that the pork was extremely moist....but it tasted like remanent vinegar that still lingered on my tongue. I don't consider myself a wimp when it comes to spice, pickles & vinegars, considering I eat them on a daily basis and make my own varieties, I was disappointed that their sauce was so acidic. Looking back on it, I should have neutralized the vinegar with the table sugar available but didn't. I was drinking Mexican Coke and it did chill out the vinegar sting a little. I did let the server know I did not care for the pulled pork due to the sauce and he offered to get a portion without it. I declined because I wanted to leave but did appreciate the offer. \\n\\nBrisket was fine. There were about 5 good size half pieces. The top piece was dry and this reinforces my thought that the meat was under a heat lamp or in a convection oven. Once I got to the bottom 2-3 pieces, the Brisket was moist and very tender. I appreciated the nice smoke flavor (although a smoke ring was missing and the meat was all one consistent color) and the fact I could cut the meat with my fork.\\n\\nSides were just okay. Jicama Slaw was very basic. I think once again they had a vinegar rinse on the vegetables but since that's all I could taste from my first bite, perhaps I'm wrong? The baked beans, while they had nice flavor, were drowning in a watery tomato like broth. I would have preferred a thicker consistency because trying to fish a bean out of an 3 oz. ramekin with an entr√©e fork is not my idea of enjoyment during lunch.\\n \\nOverall, I give the food a 2 but the ambiance, energy and average service, I think it deserves a 3. I wished I had tried a cocktail but perhaps next time. I will try Lambert's one more time before I write it off and hope sincerely it lives up to the 5 stars I see on here."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Great view.

Chef/Owner Jimmy Burke kept this place near the top of Metrowest 's best restaurants for years, but obviously he has left the building!! \\n\\nRight away I knew it was a mistake to have reserved here. The once funky, chic space had been turned into a cheap, shabby Olive Garden. There was no uniqueness to the room, no vibe of being in a hot happening place. We both looked at each other and laughed...saying there goes the special evening we had planned!\\nBut it was too late to walk and we felt just being there together would make it  fun! \\n\\nWe ordered wine and appetizers to start, and the entrees. Waitress was friendly and fun. Then the horror began. We see who we believe to be the head chef come from behind the cooking area, chat with the manager and leave. The first appetizer arrived about 20 mins after we'd ordered...a long time when you're hungry. It was their wood grilled calmari...utterly flavorless and chewy. Then the second appetizer, a goat cheese and roasted beet salad arrived 15 minutes after the calmari. Not sure why a salad took so much longer than a cooked appetizer. The \\"roasted beets\\" looked and tasted like the beets you get out of a can, no sweetness from being roasted at all.\\n\\nSo we finished the bottle of wine....and waited....and waited.\\nOur waitress came by and asked if we'd like another bottle, just a glass, thanks.\\nWe  sipped that glass and waited for the entrees....they never arrived. The waitress was now nowhere to be found, so after almost a full hour we rose from our chairs to leave. Suddenly she flies out with our entrees......I simply said \\"not now, thank you\\"\\nShe goes over to the manager, he comes over and without any apology says\\n\\"how about we charge you for only for the wine\\"  knowing there was no way he could defend the inept kitchen. \\nWe paid for the wine and I slipped the waitress a $20 as she wasn't the fault of the ruined evening.

I honestly don't understand why they renamed it with a water park name.  Are they really trying to say that mix of stagnant, chemical-filled, artificially colored water features are 'springs'?\\n\\nWe actually came for the theater (which was a disappointment) but ended up missing the first showing and having to burn two and a half hours in the 'springs'.  \\n\\nYeeaarrs ago, back when it was an adult place, it was great.  Two years ago was the last time we visited.  It was right after the initial 'kidification' happening there and at other parks and over half of it was behind walls.  It was during the summer and there were about a thousand teens and tweens just sitting in circles throughout the entire park.  Pretty obvious what they're aiming for but I still think it's stupid.  Let the kids have the other 10 fucking parks.  There is still major construction going on but there's enough open to warrant a visit should your wallet allow.\\n\\nCan't believe the shops are still so small...  Still haven't seen the inside of the Ghirardelli place as it was packed yet again.  The marketplace, main gift shop, and the tea and spice place were really fun!  I was super, super, super disappointed that the only Tsum Tsums I could find were in the smaller toy shop and it was about the same size as the Target displays with a slightly larger variety.  Also disappointed that there was an employee 'restocking' or something, basically standing there and touching all the Tsums, who kept pushing his way in front of me and just not giving a shit that I was actively browsing and considering purchasing some Tsums.  I need MOAR XL TSUMS!  The art in the marketplace was amazing and I also enjoyed all the 'throwback' housewares.  Little themed park trashcan salt and pepper shakers!  \\n\\nThere are these dolls in the main gift shop that are SO ugly!  They're everywhere in there, too!  It's like chunky-mcderpy princesses.  They can't put up a real Tsum Tsum display and give me a XL Tod but they can find space for 400 of the ugliest dolls Disney has ever made.  OH, OH my god, there's a mug in there that is so hilarious!  It's an Ariel mug and they've raised parts of it as some sort of stylistic tactile design choice and they raised her breasts!  There's a mug in the kid's princess section where you can feel Ariel's boobies.\\n\\nAnyway...  I'm sure it's wonderful to a tourist or a diehard Disney local but for me it just doesn't cut it.  If I want to walk for hours and browse, I'd rather be in one of the other multiple downtown/old district areas in their shops, antique stores, or enjoying their culture and community.

It was a magical dish where somehow the outside of the roti was crispy and crunchy while the inside was tender and soft while still fully cooked.  I have no idea how he managed to cook it.  I've searched.  Believe me, I've searched for that roti canai locally.  I've finally found it in Burnaby!  This was so amazing. The roti was crunchy and crisp and flavored perfectly.  The inside was soft and tears apart just like I remember almost 20 years ago. The curry they have was so flavorful that I almost wanted to drink it without the roti.  Fantastic. \\n\\nWe both had the hainan chicken and rice which was slightly different then I remember but no less tasty. It was great and fully enjoyable.  \\n\\nJust to make sure we decided to test their deserts too.  Deep fried banana and coconut pudding.  Yes, we were bad.

Less a pudding and more a firm jello style.  It was really good but not a pudding.  I liked the coconut ice that was included with it.

Or cafe. \\n\\nAnyhow, it was a Saturday night, and we sat inside where it was almost empty. I noted that there was a huge patio out back and that's where most of the people were. Inside, where we were, album covers and vinyl decorated the wooden walls, and it reminded me of Magnolia Cafe, if Mag had a love child with the Broken Spoke. \\n\\nThe food was classic Texas diner fare, some Tex-Mex, fried stuff, chicken fried stuff, chili, etc. I had the blackened catfish with jalepeno cream corn and Greg's green beans. The boyfriend ordered chicken with jalepeno hush puppies and some slaw. While waiting for our food, we heard other tables compliment the waitress on the food, so that was a good sign. Service was a bit slow, probably due to all the action going on out back. \\n\\nWhen our food actually arrived, it didn't disappoint. Well maybe a little. The blackened catfish was way salty, but everything else was A-OK. The jalepeno cream corn was good, but I'm pretty sure it was canned cream corn with more heavy whipping cream added and some jalepenos. Greg's green beans were nice but heavy on the pepper.

The folks who have rated this place so highly clearly have mediocre taste in Thai food. Or maybe they're just inexperienced, and haven't experienced the 10s of other places that make way better Thai food in Portland. \\n\\nHowever, I can't rag on the average Uber Eats user's opinion on Thai food too much. The short time frame in which my food was projected to arrive motivated me to choose Sunee Lee. I guess that's what I get for trying to inch closer to the instant gratification that is typical of the average, McDonaldized American. Rather than choosing to order from 2 other places listed on Uber Eats that I knew were delicious. In hindsight, the extra 20-30 minutes probably would've been worth it. \\n\\nAnyways, enough with the wordy, stoner rant BS.\\n\\nThat being said, Sunee Thai & Lao isn't awful, but it's not that great. The veggies in my Pad Ga Prow were crisp and fresh, though the sauce of the dish lacked the bold flavors I've had in the same dish from numerous other Thai places in Portland. But dang, this dish was not the explosion of flavor I anticipate in Pad Ga Prow. \\n\\nOverall, there's way better Thai places in Portland. The veggies are fresh, but the flavor of the sauce is bland. I guess next time I'm stuck working from home and need the comfort of Uber Eats to deliver me remedies for my hangriness, I'll go with something I know, and not with what Uber Eats users have rated so highly.

Very one note...and that note was butter. Now, I can be an avid butter lover but I just wasn't feeling it at this moment. Maybe I should have ordered the additional chicken sausage or bacon for $3 more but I was feeling somewhat frugal and that might have just put it over the top for richness. A generous helping of pepper elevated the flavor a bit but I don't think I'd order it again. The ambiance is very nice with dark wood and background jazz music. My server wasn't overly attentive but i wasn't completely ignored either; although I'm used to being looked past as I look fairly young and therefore poor, so I don't hold it against her too much.

Putting aside the exploitation of my culture for commercialization (nothing wrong with that, this is 'Merica), Zaftig's was just alright.  Service was good and the place is decorated well.

My reuben was alright but nothing special.  They definitely didn't skimp on the meat, but the grilled pumpernickel bread was the problem here.  It just kind of sucked.  I ended up discarding it and just ate the rest of the sandwich; no clue why they wouldn't just use rye.  The corned beef was decent but can't compare to the  stuff you'd get in a real Jewish deli.  The potato pancakes were decent.  A little thick, not crisp enough, and unremarkable otherwise.  My companion eggs benedict was good though.

There are plenty of top-rated Italian restaurants in LA, NY, SF, and Philadelphia who charge about $10 less per pasta dish and produce far superior dishes.

I'm not sure who is regularly ordering competent but by no means extraordinary Linguine con Vongole for $28 (should have been $18) or Spaghetti Pomodoro for $21 (should have been $14-$16).

The cause of this failure was the maitre d', who was one of those I'm-too-good-to-work-here-prissy-little-snots-who-just-graduated-from-college-and-can't-get-a-job-anywhere-other-than-her-same-ole-college-gig. She has no business in the service industry and certainly not being the person that sets the tone for an establishment where atmosphere is what the restaurant is selling. First, she got testy with us when we arrived 15 minutes early to our reservation time and said we'd rather wait than be seated at a table next to the entrance. Then she lied and said it would take over an hour to get seated at another table. Not five minutes later another attendant seated us at another table. She then proceeded to berate the other attendant in the middle of the restaurant for seating us, send over a third attendant to ask us if we had reservations for \\"that\\" table, and then when the third attendant didn't ask us to get up and wait for another table, she stomped over to us and very curtly stated that \\"we couldn't sit there.\\" We then talked to the manager, were seated immediately, were treated well by the manager and the waitress, and enjoyed some really good Texas-Q. We continued to be irked, though, because tables all around us immediately opened up, and stayed empty. The maitre d' knew that it wouldn't take an hour for another table, but just felt like being impudent (I guess our reservation was only for the worst table, no matter how many people were there). In the end, we were left feeling disrespected, and that's not how you want to feel after dropping a couple hundred bucks on BBQ."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Hands down the best cannoli I have ever had in my life.

We all pick our pleasures and poisons and on this day I found myself on Morse Blvd's Croissant Gourmet. I headed inside this packed casual caf√© and huge display of French pastries. This is where the hardest decision of the day would indeed have to happen.\\n\\nThis little shop of delight, as I found out, has only been open for a couple years from 6-6pm. The owners and executive chefs are brothers straight out of France destined to put smiles on our faces. I had seen the Croissant Gourmet at off times when they were closed but today was the perfect day.\\n\\nThe decision between sweet or savory was east for me. But after that, I was torn. Classic Napoleons, Flan, Chocolate-filled √©clairs, and fruit tarts overwhelmed me. I asked a couple ordering at the counter as they had French accents, they surely would point me in the right direction. \\"A fruit tart, of course.\\"  And that I did. A perfect blueberry tart. I sat on the narrow counter facing the outside window and with my first bite I was able to daydream as if I was somewhere else. Fresh blueberries, then the custard, and finally the crunch of the bottom crust. I was no longer in Florida. I can't stress the freshness enough. This can make or break a dessert. This tart was perfect in freshness, flavor, and temperature. I just wish I could have taken a few other tarts on this trip with me. Maybe the Almond Pear or the Apple Normandy.

We were at the Altamonte Mall and were looking for a place to have dinner to celebrate our anniversary and found it while browsing Disney restaurants.  We made our reservations online and headed over.  \\n\\nWe checked in and only had to wait about 5 minutes before being seated at a window table.  It was dark by that time so no real views to speak of, however if the sun were out I think we would have been able to see the pool.  The cafe isn't as elegantly decorated as the rest of the hotel, which you need to walk through to get to the restaurant entrance.\\n\\nWe decided to dine a little tipsy so I ordered a Tennessee Honey and my wife got the Black Cherry Twist.  Both were a little pricey but delicious.  Like most Disney restaurants, the menu is not at all vast with about 6 choices in each course.  Our appetizers and entrees were hit and miss.  My wife got the Carmelized Onion Soup, with a heaping portion of cheese that was fun to watch her try to eat, and the Grand Floridian Burger, which is served with a chunk of lobster on it.  She loved the burger but when I tried the beef alone, it tasted pretty standard.  I got the Panko Crusted Lump Crab Cake, which was tasty but certainly did not have any lumps of meat.  It was shredded a la tuna salad.  The Braised Lamb Shank was perfectly tender but did not have that distinguishable lamb flavor.  It tasted more like a pot roast and needed some more seasoning.  The lamb was served with cheese grits, which had more of a mashed potato consistency.  As strange as it may sound, it was the cheese grits that made me want to try the lamb and so because the grits didn't really turn out like grits, I was disapointed in the dish.  \\n\\nTheir deserts seemed very reasonably priced but that is because they are all miniature, sample size portions.  We settled on the Lemon Cheese Cake and the Boston Cream Pie.

I know what your thinking, that's obviously not BBQ. After wards I split the chicken with lime BBQ sauce and the sausage. The sausage was okay but the chicken with the lime sauce was incredible and well worth the price.

Just to fill you up as energy food and walk out feeling satisfied. The fish cut is very iffy from time to time. Their sashimi cuts are so bad, while their nigiri cuts are extremely accurate. They must have different chefs doing different cutting. Their rice is perfectly packed and they actually put wasabi into your nigiri.

We ordered the deviled egg appetizer which was ok but definitely not worth the $9 price tag!! I had the brisket for dinner and we shared the mac and cheese and coleslaw for sides. The brisket was wonderful - perfectly seasoned and a great mix of lean and fattier portions so I could have a bit of both with each bite. The mac and cheese was decent but the coleslaw really lacked flavor and we didn't each much of it. Neither side were anywhere near worth the $7 price. \\nThe weirdest thing about this restaurant was that we received our appetizer no more than 2 minutes after we ordered it and the same with our dinner. I certainly don't like slow service so I'm glad we didn't experience that but receiving our orders so quickly was bizarre and made me feel like they were trying to rush us out. \\nThe real positives of Lamberts are the fantastic brisket and the attentive service (my water was never empty and I'm a heavy water drinker).

High-end restaurants generally don't slay me these days, except for the rare few, and they always are West Coast restaurants.  Even Blue Hill, with its locally-sourced sensibility, seems to lack that combination of ingredients and (as Gary Danko would say) love.  Or at least, inventiveness or simplicity or, as my friend Brian says, a little something something.  For some reason, at the end of our culinary whirlwind, we didn't hold out much hope for Great Bay, despite the Lark Creek Inn pedigree.  Maybe it was the setting, and maybe it was just restaurant fatigue (Green Dragon's being our only real fave for days.)   We were oh so pleasantly surprised.  We had a fantastic meal, not the least because of the warm, tremendously hospitable service.  And the food was great too.  It was almost too much:  we didn't order sushi, yet a plate appeared (compliments) and it was fantastic.  It was the best meal of our trip.

I've only had the pho here so thats what the review will be about. The pho comes in your typical sizes (regular (5.50) and large (6.25)) and the selection varies from just particular cuts of meat (pho tai etc) to the special which is a hodge podge of everything. The broth isn't as rich or deep as it would be if you made it at home, but still pretty good. The noodles are cooked right and the meat (although not as much as I would've imagined for a large bowl of pho) was fresh. I even got a side of raw meat ($1) to see the quality of the meat and i'd have to say it was fresh enough. The sides it came with (limes, jalapenos, bean sprouts, thai basil, etc) were all fresh with few brown spots. Overall the experience was pleasant.

Music plays on the sound system, loud enough to be heard clearly, but quiet enough to talk over.\\n\\nPull up an institutional surplus steel stool to the slightly chaotic-looking bar, and marvel at the wonder of it. A rack of tinctures, extracts, and bitters in apothecary bottles with eyedroppers. Two walls of spirits, whiskys, and liqueurs. Absinthe fountains. Bail-top jars filled with preserved and fresh fruits for garnishes and flavoring. Little bowls and jars of whole spices, ready to be pounded, grated, or ground as necessary.\\n\\nCentral is as close to an honest-to-god speakeasy you're gonna see without some sort of connections and a password.

Also a prime location in the middle of Krog Street Market, a stone's throw from the Beltline.  Superica serves tasty Tex-Mex in a slightly nicer setting.  That being said, you don't have to wear formal attire to dine here.   But, the dining area is a little more refined than the rest of the Krog Street Market food court.  The restaurant is very good for groups and is fairly dark.  There are some black and white films playing on a screen near the entrance connected to the main market.\\n\\nHighlights:  All of the meats that I've tried in Superica have been fabulous.  My first trip to Superica was for dinner after a late lunch.  I ordered the steak tacos al carbon, which comes with strips of wood grilled steak, smoked onions, and a side of avocado salsa verde.  I took a bite from my taco, and I immediately forgot that I wasn't super hungry.  On my second trip to Superica, I almost went for the same order again.  Deciding to be a little more adventurous, I decided to order three tacos a la carte - steak, carnitas, and barbacoa.   The carnitas are not merely thin strips of seasoned pork as in other restaurants, but succulent strips of fatty, well marinated pork belly.  My barbacoa taco was different from the other two tacos - served on a smaller corn tortilla, this taco came with brisket, queso fresco, and a cabbage slaw.  Again, the meat was marinated well.  I would say that the barbacoa taco is the most balanced of the tacos in terms of meat and other toppings, but the steak tacos al carbon are still my favorite.  The servers are polite and friendly and the cushioned seating in the dining area were really comfortable.  I would say that the restaurant wasn't quiet, but not so loud that you couldn't hear the people sitting next to you.  Chips and salsa are complimentary at the start of your meal.\\n\\nCritiques:  The tacos came with a communal order of rice and beans.  I thought the rice was a little over-salted.  The carnitas tacos, while amazing, would have been really heavy if I ate a full order of three instead of just one.\\n\\nOverall: You really shouldn't be going to a Tex-Mex restaurant if all you want to eat is rice.  The meats are extremely flavorful and the food overall is excellent.  Also, the atmosphere is great for meeting up with a group of friends.  And, you can walk off all the calories on the Beltline afterwards."},{"name":"Bethany Sushi","address":"4804 Nw Bethany Blvd, Ste I-3","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Good consistent food from a very nice and sweet family restaurant.

Seriously, \\"eat good ramen\\" was always on my itinerary for whenever I would go back to Japan to visit family. So imagine my surprise when in the span of 1 year, we go from zero good ramen restaurants in Columbus to at least 2! (Menya and Fukuryu. I've yet to try Meshikou.)\\n\\nSome of the older Japanese restaurants in town have always served ramen. For example, Akai Hana (which I love overall) serves shoyu ramen. It's not bad, but it's about as good as a ramen that you would get at a shopping mall food court in Tokyo. As in, not as good as what you would get at a dedicated ramen restaurant in Tokyo. It's kind of like the difference between pizza at Sbarro's and at Harvest Pizzeria. They're both good, but one is clearly superior. \\n\\nAt this point, I've tried every single one of Menya's ramen broths. The shoyu and tonkotsu are the clear winners. Those broths are as good as what you might get in Japan. Their miso broth is also good, but probably only 80% as good as the miso broth I've had in Japan. Actually, I would say that Fukuryu Ramen's miso broth is better. The black tonkotsu and black miso are in my opinion a miss. The added flavors take away from the flavors of the base broth. And the black versions cost more. Save your money, go for the basics. \\n\\nMenya's ramen noodles are also pretty good. Probably better than Fukuryu's, especially since they use different thicknesses of noodles to match the different broths. The shoyu and miso get a standard thickness ramen noodles while the tonkotsu gets skinnier noodles. \\n\\nThe toppings on the noodles like the hard boiled eggs and the char siu pork are also top notch.\\n\\nMenya also serves other non-ramen dishes such as edamame and gyoza dumplings. These are good additions to the meal, but if you specifically want to eat those things and not ramen, you'd probably be better off at Akai Hana, Yoshi's, or Ba Sho. \\n\\nI also want to touch upon the building itself. It's much larger and comfortable than the other ramen shops in town. There's even kid's play area! Menya is easily the most family-friendly ramen shop in town. On the other hand, I'm not sure if they serve alcohol... so if that's important to you, Fukuryu with their draft beers is probably better. \\n\\nAll in all, I'm a big fan of Menya!\\n\\nPS: I've noticed that other reviewers are mixing up \\"tonkotsu\\" and \\"tonkatsu\\". Tonkotsu means pork bones and is a type of ramen broth. Tonkatsu is Japanese breaded deep fried pork filets. So as much as deep fried pork filets on top of my ramen sounds amazing, there is no such thing as \\"tonkatsu ramen.\\""},{"name":"Pho With Us","address":"9900 S Ih 35 Frontage Rd, Ste 500","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm only giving this five stars in the hopes that they will improve the service.

We can get amazing japanese food here in Van at a real good bang for your buck, so I can't say that this place is worth the price tag. After 4 tapas, neither of us were even close to being satisfied. We actually went for more food after. Like some other reviewers said, it's almost like a cactus or a joey's but with fusion japanese food. But the food is decent and the ambience is on the trendier side for a Japanese place, though very loud.

We were at the table for about two more hours for dinner and desserts but still no sign of characters.

It's our neighborhood hangout and we have been regulars there for a while. But I could never give them 5 stars. Blackbird, summed up in a single word is unreliable.\\n\\nWhen it's good? It's good! Their drinks are tasty and can get you pretty drunk for not a ton of money. Their pizza can be wonderful when it's not doughy or burnt. \\n\\nThe service...? Well, we had our regular servers who always treated us right. Knew us by name and were always friendly and actually got our orders right. But we have had a long standing joke about Blackbird and how they will, inevitably, screw something up if one of our favorite servers wasn't there that night. Wrong size drink? Wrong slice of pizza? Totally forgetting one person's slice? Putting the wrong ingredients in a drink? Pizza too burnt? Pizza too doughy? Pretty much anything that is just under the line of frustration where you decide to stop coming here has happened to us. But, we put up with it, because on the nights it was good, it was everything we wanted.\\n\\nNow, though? There was some mass exodus of everybody who was competent. Any time we've been back in the last few months has just been... mediocre. Truthfully, we'll probably still keep going there because it's not a half bad place to get drunk and because it's close. But the pizza isn't good enough and the service is bad enough that we've pretty drastically limited our outings to Blackbird these days.\\n\\n(Also, what the hell is their obsession with olives? I've been there on at least a few nights where every pizza-by-the-slice they're serving that day, except for basic cheese and pepperoni, have olives on them. It's fine if you like olives but they have to realize some people really hate them right?

If you've got a little layover (and, hell, I like PLANNING one on a long trip) it's a great place to get a real meal with real service and real flatware at the airport. They've got a good lunch and evening menu, but the real highlight is the breakfast fare. They've got a 'light' breakfast menu from 10:30 to noon, but the one you really really want is the morning breakfast that cuts off at 10:30am. If I'm connecting through ATL, I actually plan the itinerary just to hit this cafe before 10:30am, which takes some 'out of the way' thinking if you're traveling east and losing an hour or two, but it's well worth the effort!  The Eggs Benedict on that early morning menu (you can't get it any other times) is the pick for sure. Perfectly poached eggs, a nice hollandaise, and a bottom 'muffin' that's as far from 'chewy' as you can get. Light and fresh, just the way to make the dish. The service has never disappointed either. Just be sure to let them know if you have a quick connection so they don't let you relax 'too' much, and they'll get you in and out faster. My only reason for 4 out of 5 stars instead of 5 is that the sandwich and lunch offering menu is a bit overpriced for real value and the coffee, though quite good, is less than Starbucks, and more expensive. Best to catch your espresso and latte otherwise on the concourse.

If still feels a bit disjointed with Korean music playing set against red lanterns that are a bit harsh and a bit of Joanna Gaines-esque decorations here and there. \\n\\nThe menu is also kinda weird to me. Let me say this right off the bat: if a place ever charges me over $6 for a bahn mi, that's an automatic pass from me. However, their pho is nicely priced and well crafted. May have MSG, but I don't really care/notice...at least until another place exclusively has no MSG (it tastes cleaner when there isn't MSG used). \\n\\nBut who cares, because there's FINALLY a decent pho place to go to in south Austin.

When we arrived, there was a line out the door -- err, a crowd that expanded past the door. There's a sign that suggests for faster service, to NOT make a single file line, and to just make your way to the front counter. Although messy, this is probably the best way to manage such a large crowd because then everyone is paying attention so they can get what they want and leave. \\n\\nFor  $11.50, I got three cannolis and a variety of eight butter cookies (I asked the lady just to pick out some random ones). The cannolis were a \\"thank you\\" gesture to a friend/relative who was kind enough to play host to my friend and I for the weekend and the cookies were my non-perishable treats to take home for my family. \\n\\nWhen we purchased these in the afternoon, we were still stuffed from a late breakfast, so I didn't get to try a cannoli, but when we gave them to our host, she was pretty excited about them! The cookies, which I did get to try are delicious! They are nice and buttery, each with its own little twist. \\n\\nWhen I return to Boston for another visit I will definitely have to leave room in my stomach to try a cannoli and pick up some more cookies (while I was there, I also heard their lobster tail is also amazing, so maybe I'll have to try that one, too!).\\n\\nThe crowd, although large, can be maneuvered through easily, and I didn't have to wait too long.

This location at Krog Street is CONSTANTLY hustling and bustling. The dining room is large and open and always packed, even on weekdays. There is a really nice and very large covered patio facing Krog Street. \\n\\nService is typically very good. It can get a bit slow if they're especially packed but I've never had an uncomfortably long wait. They do have a good system in place of the bar staff delivering beverages so you don't have to wait on the waitstaff to run food and drinks. \\n\\nPricing is a bit higher than the overage Mex restaurant in Atlanta, but I recommend hitting them up for the lunch special Monday - Friday. For $10.99 you get two options from a list of items as well as rice and beans. \\n\\nFood and beverage highlights: \\n\\nAPPETIZERS\\n- Two types of house made salsa are brought out with your chips (complimentary). The green is of the avocado-tomatillo variety and the red is a bit smoky. Both are delicious. \\n\\n- Queso Fundido ($10-$11): broiled chihuahua and jack cheeses served with warm tortillas. For an upcharge you can add some protein. Great for sharing but not your typical liquid cheese dip. This is one you may need a knife and fork to eat easily. Traditional and very yummy. \\n\\n- Sopa De Tortilla ($6/cup; $10/bowl): chicken & vegetable soup with ancho chili, cilantro, avocado, monterey jack, & crispy tortillas. Standard Mexican restaurant offering but reflective of this being a higher-end place. Warm and filling. The cup is a sizeable serving; if you're looking for a lighter lunch I recommend a cup of this and one of the side salads. \\n\\nENTREES*\\n*Rice and beans are served family-style with all entrees. \\n\\n- Tacos Al Pastor ($12): corn tortillas, crispy pork belly, grilled pineapple. Fresh, sweet, savory. Fabulous. \\n\\n- Puffy Tacos ($14): shredded lettuce, tomato, & cheese, and your choice of either shredded chicken tinga or spiced ground beef (\\"picadillo\\"). I'd never had puffy tacos before trying Fry's (served at both Superica and the El Felix in Alpharetta) - but my friends from the Southwest swear they're the best they've had outside of Texas. \\n\\n- Steak Tacos Al Carbon ($16): grilled skirt steak, charred onions, & avocado salsa verde. You can't go wrong with these. \\n\\n- Tacos De Carnitas ($13): crispy pork belly, hot & sweet guava glaze, cilantro & onions. These are very unique and one of my absolute favorites. Served in thick homemade tortillas rolled into tubes instead of the standard V-shaped taco. There isn't much to them but the pork belly is crispy and sweet. You really don't need anything more.

Work just a few blocks from this place (30th floor in the Hilton downtown) and live less than two miles away.  But I only finally got to check it out this evening with friends for an after work happy hour and SO glad I did.\\n\\nFirst, the main detail you want to know:\\n\\nPARKING!\\nThe Hilton's website reads that it's free parking at the hotel if you let the attendant know you're dining with them up at Nikolai's.  Otherwise, there are street parking lots all around the neighborhood, most by the hour with a max of $12.  \\n\\nIf you're MARTA savvy, you're golden.  Get off at the Peachtree Center station and you can walk a few blocks on the street or take the people hamster tubes through the food court, then the Hyatt and Marriott and straight into the Hilton without ever having to go outdoors.\\n\\n[if you're visiting from out of town, ask any employee at any of the hotels how to get here and they are all very helpful in sending you the right direction.]\\n\\n\\nTHE DEETS TONIGHT:\\n\\nI've always thought of Nikolai's as a \\"higher end\\" restaurant and lounge in Atlanta and it truly is.  The price point is for those with special events to celebrate or expense accounts.  But not on Wednesday nights.\\n\\nBecause on Wednesday nights during happy hour  (5:30-7), Nikolai's offers a sample flight of 3 different wines or 3 different house-infused flavored vodkas PLUS a side of housemade piroshkies all for only $15.  A total steal.  I opted for the wines tonight (which change out weekly) and received a reisling, a pinot grigio and a nice cabernet.  Some of my friends opted for vodkas, with about eight to choose from:  cinnamon, lime, peach to name a few.  The piroshkies were *delicious*.  These offerings are of the meat variety (mentioning that in case you're vegetarian or vegan).  Not your cup of tea, there are other items on the menu you can order if you'd like (at extra cost).\\n\\nIn addition, most Wednesday nights they have a jazz playing to boot (according to their website). There was not one tonight, but we didn't miss it.  They played music overhead in the lounge and it was just at the *correct* volume.  I don't know about you, but I HATE having to scream over music to talk to my companions.  You won't have to worry about that here.\\n\\nAnother one of the most lovely things about this place is the views, especially if you're from out of town.

Our server was also very lovely.  When she brought our various flights, she made sure to point out what each one was and what to expect from our tastings. And then she would leave so we could enjoy our company without ever over-hovering or trying to up-sell.   It was very clear we came in for the special on Wednesdays but we weren't treated any less than those dining on the other side of the room eating 3-course meals.

Planning a kids birthday??  Come one come all!  Or save your money and kids tears for somewhere better!  If you have a birthday boy/girl in mind and hope for somewhat of a visit from the characters  (which we found out are really the owners) or a happy birthday song (which they don't sing) don't waste your time. Unfortunate to say but my 9yr old and his friends were extremely upset to hear they will come to the table \\"if they want\\" and the staff persisted to announce they aren't allowed to approach the characters (owners) to have them say hello for anyone's birthday (Are they unicorns??).  Now we waited two hours for a table to get there and be told they would make their way around eventually. We were at the table for about two more hours for dinner and desserts but still no sign of characters. I asked to speak to a manager Michelle and to my surprise she said she would let them know however watched her float around upstairs where we were sitting, gossiping with weight staff doing absolutely NOTHING productive or helpful for her team or customers. When I asked our super friendly overly kind waitress (Katy) to speak w Michelle again, she came to the table and I asked Mi \\"Have you asked them to come and visit upstairs?\\"  Her answer was written on her face that she hadn't but her deceitful reply was that she had. I asked to speak w one of the owners immediately. Michelle then sent over a guy named Dylan who said he heard the \\"buzz\\" and that he was the \\"GM\\" and wanted to \\"smooth\\" things over, my response was \\"I'm not sure why they sent you over when I asked to speak with the owners.\\" His reply was he couldn't approach THEM and they weren't the owners (which completely contradicted himself) I told him the only way to \\"smooth\\" us over were to make the kids happy and just send the characters around, was it too much to ask when our table had just wasted $1,500 on less than par food and 5 hours of our time??  Still there was \\"nothing he could do\\".  Needless to say an upset birthday boy and extremely unprofessional management is the reason I gave 1 star.

We got there around 6pish on a Thursday.  We were able to sit at the ice bar and have the experience.  Immediately upon entering, we were greeted by the host and made to feel welcomed.  The bartender, Carl, was the best.  He's friendly, engaging and has a great sense of humor.  Carl introduced himself and asked us our names.  To his credit, he remembered everyone's name and referred to us by name throughout the evening.  I noticed he did the same for other patrons who sat at the bar as well. We each asked him for recommendations based upon our tastes and he scored home runs on each recommendation.  Then chef Saito Saito also came over to introduce himself and thanked us for coming.  Chef Saito was very nice and engaging as well.  He took the time to ask us what kind of sushi we liked and made great recommendations.  We had the Sweet 16 and Mango sushi rolls.  In a word...delicious!  I recommend trying either or both. The martinis are equally as good. Some recommendations to try:  7even 7even 0h, Honey Berry, Amelia, Blue Ginger.  I could list others but you get the picture. They have a wall of vodkas which is quite impressive.  It goes from bar level up to the ceiling.  No one would have trouble having the vodka of their choice. The martinis are $12/each and go down smoothly, so be careful.  Having multiples adds up quickly, but it was worth it to us.  Sitting at the bar was fine for our group of 4.  It's worth the ice bar experience.  But the Czar Ice Bar has other seating that works for groups as well.  Even though the bar is not overly large, they have comfortable seating areas. (couches, high top tables, etc.) The atmosphere is energetic. It gives the vibe of being at a hip spot in NYC.

The only thing I'd say I wish were different is that it is quite small, so it can feel a little claustrophobic. Sometimes it feels like you're having a conversation with the table next to you. But if that doesn't bother you (and don't let it), you're in for a spectacular experience.\\n\\nFirst of all, I've never been disappointed with the food. They have some staples on the menu and also seem to vary their menu seasonally, which is fun. The menu isn't huge but that allows the chef to make spectacular dishes.\\n\\nDef. get the Brussels sprouts - a honey Siracha sauce that is just a perfect combination. I love Brussesl sprouts and often order them at restaurants and this is one of my favorite varieties. \\n\\nThe last time I was here, my partner ordered the vegetarian risotto and holy cow, was it good. Risotto is hard to get right, but this was perfect. Creamy, filling, the rice was soft but with the perfect \\"bite\\", the perfect firmness. I've ordered the fried pork sandwich a couple of times now and I love it. I thought it seemed like a strange thing at first - I don't think I'd ever had fried pork in this way, but it is good. The pork is perfectly cooked, but the best part is the pickled veg on top. So good.\\n\\nI or a dining companion has also ordered the mussels (a meal in themselves), the fish tacos (good, but not my favorite thing), and the burger (basic  in a good way, really flavorful).\\n\\nDrinks are also fantastic. I'm def. a cocktail kind of person and a St. Germaine freak, and they make great cocktails. I love the St. Germain Royale and my partner loves the Ginger Smash.\\n\\nFor the quality and atmosphere, I think Porter Cafe has great prices. I think there are several places in W. Roxbury or Roslindale or JP where everything is similar but the prices are solidly higher. \\n\\nAlso, the service has always been excellent. Despite the fact that it can get pretty busy, I've always had the perfect amt. of attention, not too much, not too little. The food comes out quickly every time.\\n\\nIt's street parking but if you're willing to go down a block or two, park on a side street, it's not that hard to find parking.\\n\\nOh, one other great, newer thing, is that apparently Porter Cafe bought what used to be Upper Crust two storefronts down and opened a cool pizza shop called The Parlour. When I went on a Friday night, it was going to be a 20-30 minute wait (fine by me at that time of day), and there's not a lot of space to just wait around or even space at the bar.

This is what we ordered:\\n\\n1) Burrata with field greens, shaved parm, and some crustinis or some kind of toasted bread - I think this was one of the daily appetizer specials. The burrata was amazing. Nice and creamy, fresh, and went well with the bread. Got some extra bread to mop up the rest of the cheese.\\n\\n2) Cacio E Pepe - I got the half portion of this due to the amount of the other food we ordered, but if you've never had cacio e pepe before, you need to order a full order. It's basically spaghettini, pecorino, and black pepper. This wasnt the best cacio e pepe I've ever had, but it was good. I was satisfied and I mean, who doesnt love pasta drowned in cheese????\\n\\n3) Prosciutto Pizza - They have a wood oven here so this was money. Imagine a nice crispy and chewy thin crust with generous amounts of prosciutto, cheese, arugula, and two perfect sunny side up eggs on top, all drizzled in truffle oil. You cant resist truffle oil. AND the best part was when I took this to work to eat for breakfast the next day, it made EVERYONE around me hungry. They basically wanted to steal my leftovers. Not happening.\\n\\n4) Steak and Fries - I think this was on the daily special menu too, but the steak was cooked to my friend's perfection and was a great portion size. \\n\\nThe dessert menu didnt wow me, but I was really happy with dinner.

Hard to argue about that, tho.  I guess my problem is, it's tough to make a mass-production-like, fresh gluten free vegan pizza with 'cheese' on it that is really really good. I found Promise's gluten-free crust to be ok, but extraordinarily thin even for gluten-free.  I've had a similar product with no cheese from Brick Oven, which was a few notches better and they are not organic.  I've also had a d.i.y gluten-free cheese free pizza at home that was better than both of them (can't remember where I got that crust from, tho.)\\n\\nBut I totally salute the hell out of Promise and anyone else who goes to this much effort to make their place of business that good for the world, even if it's not as good as it could be (yet?).

It's all you can eat for a fairly reasonable price (17CAD lunch, 25 CAD dinner). \\n\\nFirst idea that comes to your mind is \\"it can't be really high quality given the fact it's all you can eat\\", but the quality of the food there is amazing. I got impression that the dinner menu is a bit bigger, so you might try going there for a dinner first. The food is combo between sushi, asian, and prepare-it-by-yourself korean/teriyaki bbq. While selection of meet for bbq is not that great (pork chops, beef, lamb, mussels), sushi and seafood selection is amazing.\\n\\nPlace is usually super crowded, so make sure you have a reservation.

We may have ordered the wrong things aka the more unpopular items (he had the fish and chips, while I got half a chicken pate sandwich and half salad), but I was not impressed whatsoever. My sandwich filling was strange and unappetizing, and my salad was a sad little mess of greens with the tiniest crumbles of cheese... It was their \\"daily special\\" salad, too.\\n\\nI will say that the decor was very cute and the atmosphere warm and inviting.

The place itself was pretty empty (no doubt a function of the economy) but that staff (very nice grandmotherly type) was very attentive and the prices were reasonable.    The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because it would cheapen the review - but the food pizza here is great.  Other stuff - pasta, appetizers - are only so-so.

I ordered the fish sandwich was grilled barrimundi with lettuce, tomato, red onion and an aioli. The side was a arugula salad, which was lightly dressed with a simple vinaigrette. It also came with three slices of baked sweet potato with a little bit of char and some candied pecans. This salad was great. The sandwich came on a wonderfully soft fresh roll and a huge piece of fish. The fish was cooked perfectly with nice grill marks and was delicious.

No matter what time of day you get it, I'm just a breakfast food lover. Their french toast is, hands down, the best I've had - Breaded in crushed corn flakes, it's crunchy outside and soft in the middle. A dash of cinnamon, a hint of vanilla, and light dusting of powdered sugar on top make it the epitome of perfection. \\n\\nThe service is prompt and the waiters and waitresses are always very amiable. Occasionally, when it's very busy, you may have to wait an extra minute or two for a top-off of water or coffee, but it's nothing to do with a lack of hustle! Very solid staff.\\n\\nThe general atmosphere is comfortable and classy, with Victorian decor.

My experiences here have usually left me satisfied but not thrilled.  I'm gonna try a 4 point review format here.\\n\\nDrinks (8/10): Their tap menu is huge and they are constantly rotating in new brews on a weekly basis to go along with their staples.  Great selection, and usually fresh.  I've never had a cocktail from here but their menu looks decent.  Many of the cocktails seem to tend to be on the girly side but I give them points for having at least one drink special every day.  They can't compete with places like drink or deep ellum when it comes to cocktails but they're not too shabby.\\n\\nAmbiance (7/10):  They usually have a good crowd in here.  It's often  lively and crowded but there's usually at least one or two tables available.  The inside of the bar is pretty modern and I like how the bar is sectioned off from the main area.  Only complaint is that the bar is kinda small so sometimes it can be difficult to get a seat at the bar or view the game you're trying to watch.  For the space they have it's done pretty well though.\\n\\nFood (6/10): For pub food standards it's usually pretty solid.  They have a pretty wide variety considering that it's generic bar food, and there are tons of toppings you can choose to put on a burger or sandwich.   The only problem is it can be difficult to get exactly what you order  (see the next section).  The beef stew, however, was particularly good.  I also love the sweet potato slices but they are $2 extra.  Avoid the curly fries; there tends to be an overwhelming ratio of stubby tiny pieces to actual large curled up fries. \\n\\nService (3/10): I've been here a bunch of times now and there's almost always a screwup.  If you sit at the bar you usually get pretty good service, but don't count on it if you sit at a table.  Last night I ended up asking the waiter 4 different times just to get glasses of water for the table.  We had other drinks but I shouldn't need to ask 4 different times to get a glass of water!  Then there's the problem of getting what you want.  Ask for curly fries and you can often get straight fries.  And don't count on your burger being cooked how you want it, I've asked for medium and received rare and vice versa...  One time I went there with a buddy and we both ordered a burger at the same time.  His sandwich comes out before mine, the guy says it will be a few moments for mine.  Kind of odd but ok... three minutes later he comes back and says that the guy on the grill had accidentally cooked it well done (despite the fact that I asked for medium rare), and they were going to have to start over from the beginning.  Then the burger finally comes out (after my buddy has already finished his food), but the fries on the plate are cold (didn't switch them?) and the guy didn't even give me half off or comp it or anything.  Not to mention his mannerisms and overall attentiveness led me to believe he was either stoned or really distracted.  It's really too bad that all the waiters at this bar are space cadets because it otherwise could be a really great spot!"},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is probably one of the best donuts I've had. Made a pit stop here with my best friend on our drive back to California. The line was out the door but it was worth the wait. They even had a mist machine to keep guest cool out in the heat. The employees were really nice and welcoming. We got a dozen donuts, one of each including the seasonal flavor blackberry lavender (which I thought tasted like a hint of Vick's vapor rub). My favorite was the raw honey and sea salt it was very light and airey, didn't make you feel heavy like a typical donut would. My friend got the Smokey Robinson Iced Chai, which is typically recommended hot, but it didn't live up to the hype as much as the donuts did. However, they do have a variety of flavors so there are options! I got the iced green tea matcha but it also decent. I would definitely recommend coming here:) The donuts are crispy on the outside and light on the inside. Their bite sized pieces make it that much easier to indulge in your sweet craving."},{"name":"This Is It! BBQ & Seafood","address":"4065 Memorial Dr","city":"Decatur","stars":"2.5","text":"I was really looking to have a good meal but it just didn't happen. There are 4 new tv screens that show the menu but they change every 15-20 seconds, some cut to a video, so it was hard to get a grasp of the menu for a first timer like myself. I had to let several people go ahead of me until I was able to land a printed menu. The area behind the counter was littered with dirty serving pans and were piled up on a cart. I ordered the BBQ wings box and 'delicious' fries. Every item was described as 'delicious', an adjective wayyyyy overused and in my case, not true. The fries were average crinkle cut. \\nThe wings were tiny and I think I've seen more meat on pigeons flying around downtown than what was served to me, which came off of the buffet style serving area.  When I saw the wings were being served from that, I wish I had turned around and walked out. They didn't look appetizing at all, swimming in that sauce with no idea how long they had been sitting there. \\n\\nIt was just a bad experience across the board and when I saw the 'sugar dispenser' I knew I wasted my money. On the counter next to the tea was a 20 cup metal measuring cup filled with sugar and a large serving spoon stuck in the top. Ratchet.   I only eat this way about once a week and I'm sorry I didn't listen to myself and walk out before I wasted my money. There are way better BBQ restaurants all over Atlanta.

They're definitely known for their burgers, which I had last time but I could not remember so it must have not too memorable.\\n\\nWent in and totally felt underdressed with everyone wearing business casual.  Maybe that's why the hostess was unfriendly but overall, we felt unwelcomed.  It's Friday, why not wear something casual and comfy... Anyways, we were seated next to the kitchen and it was still early for dinner on a Friday night, so not so busy.  With that said, the servers were all hovering over the server station/kitchen entrance where we were seated.  I was a server myself once so I can understand them being grouped together folding napkins and what not because it's slow, but thought it was very unprofessional like talking so loud and just goofing off in front of your customers.  Even the manager seems to part take in this as well...  Just thought it was very unprofessional and rude when the voices of the server overtook the restaurant and can be heard.  Once the dinner crowd came in, the servers scattered and we were able to enjoy our dinner. \\n\\nWe were very iffy about the restaurant week menu as the restaurant was known for their burger.  My friend ended up ordering the burger but I decided to give the prefix menu a try.  I ordered the lobster bisque, which was delicious but wished it came with a slice of bread... For entree, after a long debate I went with the prime rib over baby back ribs.  When I saw other people's order of baby back ribs come out of the kitchen, I just felt a kick to my stomach and knew I made the wrong decision.  Prime rib came and thought it looked juicy and delicious, it was very tough and fatty that I had the hardest time cutting it, not alone chewing.  At the end, I think i ended up just swallowing my food... which didn't settle too well with my stomach.  Dessert, however was a good turnaround.  The warm bread pudding was delectable and would recommend it for future customers.  \\n\\nOverall, I would recommend this place for business lunch but not so much for dinner.  Our server was awesome but the hostess were very cold.  Note to restaurants, don't hire unfriendly hostess because like the old saying, first impressions are everything... As for food, burgers are good, as well as the bread pudding but I must say, prime rib was not too impressionable."},{"name":"Hae Rim","address":"11729 SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I love going to Haerim.

First, they have several types and sizes of dogs, ranging from small to one-pound, and all-beef, sausage, brats, veggie, and pork-beef blends. They serve Nathan's Famous dogs as well, which are giant, delicious, all-beef dogs. To top off your choice of dog, they have a wide variety of toppings, many of which are free. There are a few pre-made combos of toppings or you can personalize and make your own creation. \\n\\nTo accompany your dog, there are quite a few side which are AMAZING! Everything was cooked up after we ordered, including the fries which were the perfect texture. Thick cut, but still nice and crunchy on the outside.

Next time I will order them well done. Bacon and eggs were bacon and eggs. The best was the french toast. The cinnamon and whatever other flavorings they added were just perfect.

I have been to Lambert's four different times all spanning across the eating medium that is dining out. First off i must say what some may not at first realize prior to eating at Lam's(I'm going to shorten Lambert's to help me) is that YES! it is BBQ, but they are not a traditional BBQ joint. If you are wanting to take someone out for BBQ go to a Barbeque restaurant. It's not that there BBQ isn't good it's that you get so much more of a dining experience and a wide menu at Lam's. OK let's get started. First off the main reason I'm writing this review now is because I had dinner at Lam's tonight. As i said before I have eatin at Lam's four different times. My first experience was lunch where I was embraced with the lunch menu on a weekend so it was sort of brunchish. Being that it was the first time I had been there I went for the BBQ. I got a mix plate of my choice which was chicken and brisket with a side of potato salad and beans. My brisket was good and chicken quite moist while the sides where of average bbq descent. No memories. I'm going to move things along a visit(second visit being drinks). Upon my third visit to Lam's I had gotten wind on how good there burger was. The burger can be found on the Bar Menu. Although we where not in the bar the waitress let us get it. I must warn you though we made quite the scene to get it(we faked blindness where burgers were the only cure). What i had heard was the they trimmed there steaks in house, and used the good bits for the patty meat. Either way it was a really good burger that in my opinion came with some lovely waffle fries. It would be close to a Kobe-esq burger. OK down to the reason I'm writing this review. Tonight was honestly incredible. WARNING! we made reservations and i would recommend it on a weekend. I had dinner tonight with two very good friends of very differing tastes. First things first APPETIZERS: We had the Achiote Seared Chickpeas with Goat Cheese. A melange of flavors from the Achiote shrub with hints of citrus and sweetness from the red onion. Its served with a wonderful grilled pita and dollops of goat cheese that are slightly warmed by the roasted goodness below. We were also treated by the chef to an improvised sampling of there special of the evening. Lightly grilled baby octopus atop a bed of chilled Yukon gold potatoes and a light vinaigrette. They were both very delicious.\\nENTREES: My male friend had the Crispy Wild Boars Ribs and a classic Wedge Salad. The ribs are great because they have a slow spice build-up to them so you don't get burnt out to fast. There crispy and slightly sticky form what I'm guessing is an in house made sauce. I only had a small bite of the salad, but it was all there for a wedge salad,but with more care. My female friend went for the special. It was a lovely piece of pan roasted or pan seared Halibut. It was served with trumpet royals and a watercress salad. I am getting back into fish from being off it for quite a while, and I must say this fish was exquisite. It was so light and perfectly cooked. Very lightly seasoned to save the fish and not a bit of dryness. She enjoyed it to the point of near hospitalization. I had the Bone-In Niman Ranch Pork Chop. Its served with a unique take on the Waldorf salad as well as a whole grain mustard laden with different fruits to sweeten and cut some of the natural mustard heat. The chop was beautifully cooked, very well seasoned and the mixing of the Waldorf salad and pork chop where a match made in my mouth turned heaven. What I enjoyed most about our meal was how Lam's allows the food to speak for its self. They don't tend to over season and they take pride in plating as well as the use of non-commercial and local ingredients. I realize now this review has run on quite a ways, but I really think that as a whole Lambert's has solid consistent cuisine that keeps you coming back for more. From the atmosphere to the attentive management staff as well as the rotation of seasonal beverages and ingredients Lambert's is the perfect example of what a restaurant should embody. Thank you Lambert's for making me the proud father of a beautiful food baby."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Save your money for a fast food place.

I must say, it is nothing like the one in Waikiki. I went on a weekday night about a month ago and was hugely disappointed. I realize weekdays are off nights so I would normally expect the service to be much better, needless to say, I was wrong but I will go through a play by play.\\n\\nWe arrived sometime after 10pm and there were about 30-40 people so it was relatively empty for a place of its size. My friends and I had a seat at a table and looked over the menu. They are famous for their yard-stick drinks so I decided that since I was not the driver I was going to take full advantage of this. My first drink was a mojito. Why? I am Puerto Rican, I love rum and it seemed like a good idea. I was highly disappointed because of the general weakness of the drink. I can personally make a better mojito and won't charge you $20 for it. I had a sip of my friend's long island. Much much better than what I had ordered so my second drink was a long island, yard-stick style. After not seeing my waitress for 20 mins I finally waved her down to ask where my drink was. I applaud her honesty in telling me that she had forgot but that doesn't change the fact that she failed to check on our table. Being the do-it-yourselfer that I am I decided that I would just order my next drink from the bar myself so I wouldn't have to rely on so-called waitress to forget about me another 20 mins. I like loud music as much as the next person but having to point and sign which drink I wanted is a little ridiculous. \\n\\nI will probably not go back on my own free will anytime soon but this one does not live up to the Se√±or Frogs name that it so proudly displays. If you like yelling at your server and paying too much for drinks I would encourage you to go visit. If you are more like me and have experienced another Se√±or Frogs I would advise you to stay away from this one at the time because it needs some improvement to live up to it's name."},{"name":"Pizza Bruno","address":"3990 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Hands down, the best pizza in Orlando!!

Crammed with ample toppings that slithered out with each bite. \\nVery good. \\nVery large. \\nAnd very tasty.\\nLuckily I usually get a few rides on the wife's merry go round when it comes to eating out. \\nIf I wait patiently, I generally get to mop up the last few bites.\\nToday was no different and boy was that a treat.\\nIf I had to go again, I would probably opt for a crepe. \\nBoth tasted phenomenal, but me thinks the latter wouldn't leave me wanting to order something else.\\nA couple of breakfast entrees and a side of OJ rang up to around 20 bucks which is spot on for this part of town.\\nGet there early and enjoy your meal alfresco on one of their few outside tables for two.\\nOui! \\nJ'aime Croissant Gourment."},{"name":"Treaty Oak Distilling","address":"16604 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Awesome place to have some drinks, food, and listen to some live music outdoors. \\n\\nI had their borrowed thyme drink which was delicious!

My best GF and I went in recently on a Thursday night and, after a very brief wait, were seated in the back dining room.  We ordered a bottle of wine and our standard fall back shumai app.  The shumai is very tasty so we always get it.  In fact it could be said that we are in a bit of a sushi rut.  We stray once in a while but we stick to the core basics that we know we like.  But this time I decided that I'm breaking up with Mayo based sauces on my sushi.  I don't love them so why have to scrape off the mayo?  That being said I do like spicy tuna.  Dilemma.\\n\\nI turned into the needy, pain in the butt customer and asked if we could get the mayo on the side of the Ebi Mango roll and to replace the mayo based spicy sauce with Sriracha sauce instead.  Not only was the server very accommodating and happy to make the changes she divulged that she eats her spicy tuna the same way.  No mayo.  She also suggested the Volcano Roll which we will be making room for in our sushi rut.  It was absolutely delicious.\\n\\nOur sushi was, as always, delicious.  Our service was very good. \\n\\nNew Ginza is pretty pricey but oh so yummy."},{"name":"Huong Vietnamese Restaurant","address":"1270 Morse Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I love Huong. It is a no frills, no gimmick kind of awesome restaurant that serves old school, family style dishes that hit the spot everytime you crave good Vietnamese cuisine. There is more to it then just the common beef broth noodle soup ( Pho), or your run of the mill egg roll most western palates think is a common appetizer (Cha Gio). Venture further and try the lettuce leaf wrap or the home style pork chop with rice and egg ( sunny side up). Expand on your beverage taste and try the coffee or the homemade lemonade. You'll be glad you did."},{"name":"Clover Food Lab","address":"100 Burlington Mall Rd","city":"Burlington","stars":"4.5","text":"I have to downgrade my original review from 5 to 4 stars.  The people working here have WAY too  much pep in their step.  The moment you walk through the door, they rush bouncing over to you standing between you and the menu asking for your order.  It is very bizarre.  I often find myself deciding against going there strictly due to this.  Food is really good, but the staff seriously needs to just calmate, chill out, be cool.

The place has an endless selection of delicious cheesecakes.  They do have food though, and lots of it.  Cheesecake factory has a HUGE menu with everything from Salads and sandwiches, to seafood and Chinese food, to Mexican and traditional American fare.  The entrees are also GIGANTIC. I can throw down a lot of food in one meal and I still can never finish an entire entr√©e from this place. Despite the wide selection on the menu, cheesecake delivers a solid dining experience. My favorite dish is the Chicken Marsala followed up with the Chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake for dessert.

They have lots of different flavors, including some of my favorite - hazelnut, peanut butter, pistachio, mocha/coffee, and chocolate chip. 1 or 2 of these definitely fills me up - they are a good size and don't skimp out on the cream filling inside. Everyone seems to be a fan of the white boxes with the string on them, which, I admit, gets me excited for the delicious pastries inside and perfect if you're trying to bring some back to surprise a friend. I tried to eclairs and they weren't as good, but the cannolis are a must if you're in the area.

Tasty food at a great price. I've had probably a good half of what the menu has to offer, I work right down the street and will often hit them up for breakfast or lunch. I typically order five orders at once, since I'm feeding all of my coworkers as well. They all agree that it is crazy delicious. Also, pretty great salsa bar! I'm only giving it four stars because sometimes they will forget something or mess something up, but that's only happened a handful of times in the last two years - I order here at least once a week. But yeah, super good stuff."},{"name":"Blue Dragon","address":"324 A St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"All of the food is very good, as would be expected of Ming Tsai, so rather than go on about the food quality, let me offer a warning. This is a good place to go for lunch  for food that is comparable in price and higher in quality than the surrounding area places. But DO NOT go here for dinner! While some of the dishes are an OK  size, the majority of the dinner menu is tapas style, also known as Tiny Amounts Pay Alot Sucker. For example, the hummus and the eggplant dip are a couple of tablespoons full. The Crispy Pork Tail is one small 6 inch piece. Basically, the dinner menu is a collection of expensive appetizers. There is no warning on the menu that these are tapas size servings. So if you go after work for drinks and tapas that's fine, but if you go for dinner, plan on 3-5 dishes per person."},{"name":"Croissant Gourmet","address":"120 E Morse Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"I usto come here for breakfast a few times a month.

I LOVE the carnitas, but not today. My beer came after my appetizer. The flautas fell apart and the chicken tasted different than usual. Then we waited till we were almost done with eating for the beans and rice to come, which we had to ask for. Then the cheesy beans we were expecting came as a scoop of basic beans. Not sure if they changed management or cooks, but it's the first time in over a dozen times that this place completely disappointed me."},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Delicious pastry, and great prices and service!

The Crunchy French Toast was good as well. It was French toast crusted with corn flakes, nothing new but fun to eat. Lastly we had the Migas. It was savory and I liked it a lot.
