You know the one -- you've been pining for it ever since you moved, and nobody in your new neighborhood makes anything even close.  For me, it was the transcendent Scarlet Ibis at Isaac's Deli in York, PA.  Paired with Isaac's free pickled veggie bowl, it was my favorite meal for the four years I was at York College -- and other than an hour playing DDR at the local mall, the best reward I could promise myself for spending a few hours in the library studying on a day off.\\n\\nPanera Bread Co. hasn't filled the sandwich-shaped hole in my heart, but they've at least duct-taped a sheet of plastic to keep the draft out.  A few times a week, I happily do the two-mile roundtrip from Allston for their Smoked Turkey Breast sandwich.  High quality ingredients include chewy, crusty breads baked in-store, delicious deli meats, and gorgeous fresh lettuce.  Prices aren't outrageous, and look better when you realize that what you pay for your sandwich also includes a bag of chips (or a baguette, or an apple) and a fat pickle spear on the side.  (Drinks are extra, though, which is kind of a pain.)  Portions are also good, and I like that they don't so over-stuff the sandwich that I can't taste anything but meat.  I have had a few annoying order mix-ups, but nothing worse than tomatoes on my sandwich when I asked for none.  On the whole, the combination of quality and speed generally impresses. \\n\\nThe one real downside of this Panera, as many commenters have noted, is they get crowded -- like a line going out the door crowded.  (And they don't refill the sample bowl enough, dammit!)  It's comparable to any popular restaurant at lunchtime, so don't come during lunch rush if you don't have time to stand in line, or want to be sure of getting a place to sit.  If you come during off-peak, you can usually head straight to the register and place an order without waiting at all.  Can't comment on the quality of the waitstaff since I only do takeout, but I can't remember ever seeing someone in a green apron standing around picking their nose while trays were piling up waiting to go out to the dining area.\\n\\nOverall, a very solid pick if you're in the mood for a good sandwich -- just check your watch before you go."},{"name":"Buffet Palace","address":"12570 SW Center St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2.5","text":"I dont reccomend this place for lunch at all! but for dinner this place is bomb. its 14 dollars and it's so worth it. for dinner there are ribs, crab legs, crab stuffed mushrooms, and an huge selection of asian and american food. they have awsome deserts! but i go there for the crab legs. some of the stuff gets warm like the deserts but i can live with that. great value."},{"name":"Q4 Restaurant","address":"2563 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I dined in the private dining room with a large party of 20 for a birthday party.

Quick to seat you and coming over to take your order.  I felt like something crunchy so I started off with their spring rolls and ordered a Tofu Pad Thai...hot.  She asked me if I want it very hot, 5 Tbsp hot.  Oh yeah, I want it as hot as you could make it--Thai spicy.\\n\\nWhile waiting for my food, two customers came it and they wanted to order a drink.  Damn, it's only 2pm--I was judging because I was jealous.  That sounds good but I have to go back to work.  They don't have a bartender at this hour so the waitress told the ladies that she could make only simple drinks and they could tell her what they wanted in the drink.  She even invited them behind the bar to select their liquor and had this cute, confusing moment about if she had tonic water, but she eventually found it.  She comes out with gin and tonic for the customer with an extra shot.  \\n\\nThe spring rolls came out, they were perfect.  I am normally really picky about spring rolls because I like mine and mom's version best.  It was very similar, not a lot of meat (pork) to carrot/noodle/mushroom/onion ratio.  Love their sweet dipping sauce, it had the perfect amount of spicy.  My Pad Thai was enjoyable--not as spicy as I wanted it to be but that was easily fixed with extra spices.  When I was finished and asked for a box.  The waitress commented \\"you eat too hot\\", I know...I am a freak.  \\n\\nVery efficient service and food came out quick.  I only had a 40 minute lunch today and it take 8 minutes traveling time total so I ordered, ate, and paid in about 30 minutes.  Time to head a back to work, but I'll be return again."},{"name":"Joe's Burgers","address":"7409 SW Bridgeport Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"I've had better.\\nI've had worse.\\n\\nWent to hang out at the mall with my son tonight. First time visitor to this particular mall, so we weren't sure where we would be eating. Lots of full service restaurants. We weren't quite dressed for that though. After walking around a bit, we ran across this kiosk. Checked out the menu, seemed pretty good. We walked around a bit more to see what else was out there. Then came back. We love burgers.\\n\\nAs we were standing in line reading the menu board, a worker opens up the window and says hi (nice to be noticed). We asked her how big the burgers were as we had to decide between a single or double burger. So she holds out her hands in a circle and shows us how big the burgers are. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...entertaining. So I ask if she knows if they are quarter pounders, and she informs us \\"yes, yes they are\\". We ordered two double burgers, fries and a soda.\\n\\nAs this is a kiosk, we have to find a place to eat. Not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Looking around to the other side we see a tent with plastic walls with heaters inside next to tables. Awesome! We go in, sit down and wait for our food. After a few minutes I go and retrieve our food, opting not to wait to try to figure out how they were going to tell us that our food was ready.\\n\\nThe burger was very similar to In-N-Out. I was kinda disappointed in the size, and I could tell that my son was also. They weren't quarter pound patties. The two together were equal to a quarter pound. But we ate away, digging into the fries in between bites. Fries were ok. Just standard frozen fries (seemingly).\\n\\n2 double cheeseburgers\\n2 fries\\n2 sodas\\n$18\\nNot a bad deal. Friendly staff. Decent burger. I would have just liked the burgers to be a bit...beefier. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but would eat here if walking around the mall again. If you want a better fast food type burger, try Burgerville. If you want a nice gourmet burger, go to Willamette Valley Burger in Salem. Even try 5 Guys Burger and Fries (love the cajun fries).

The presentation was fine, but it really looked more like a big chicken wing than a roast chicken.  If I see chicken on the menu, I better damn sure see chicken on my plate.  It sat untouched, until the server came back after delivering our meals in the appropriate amount of time and I said \\"I don't want this.\\"  No questions, no sour faces, she just took it from me after a quick apology.  She returned right away and asked if there was anything else she could bring me and I asked for the mac-n-cheese.  She made a point of telling me that it's a normally small portion so she said she'd double the order to an entree size just for me.  Afterwards, the manager Jay came to our table to check in, ask what went wrong and if it was fixed to my satisfaction.  He also sent over a strawberry shortcake from the dessert menu to smooth things over (which was unnecessary, but appreciated) that was superb! \\n\\nMost places handle the preparation and delivery of good meals as well as possible, it's how you handle the curveballs that make me either want to come back or think otherwise.

I ordered a wonton soup and a crab noodle dish, and my husband ordered beef with black bean sauce.  The soup had an odd odor, and I took only a few mouthfuls, before giving it up.  The crab/noodle dish when it arrived, had a dirty and tarnished spoon in it.  When I mentioned this to the server, she told me it is okay, not to worry, and brought me a cleaner spoon.  I said I was not going to eat food where there was a dirty spoon and asked for a new dish.  The server was not happy, but after a few words in her native language, took my dish away.  (I have no idea if she was calling me all kinds of names or what!).  After a minute, I decided I was not going to eat  there, and we advised the server to cancel the order.  This time, two servers became angry and were shouting at me in their native language.  Since my husband had eaten a portion of his meal, we asked for the bill, and paid as we left - all the time listening to a barrage of oriental language aimed at us.  \\nThe washrooms are filthy; the taps don't work.  While waiting for our bill, a waitress picked up a glass cover from one of the condiment dishes off the floor and set it back on the small condiment jar.  \\nThis place cries out for a Health Inspector that has not issued a warning or advance notice of his arrival.

To satisfy my latest burger craving I descended upon Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes, located at The Shops at Arbor Walk. One piece of advice. If you happen to drop by anywhere near the lunch hour as I did (ideally I try to seek out eateries either before or after the peak rush to cut down on the crowd chaos), be prepared for what can most loosely be described as a frenzied atmosphere. The dining hall itself consists of a group of long tables with gingham tablecloths and red metal seats. Communal outdoor picnic gone indoors noshing for sure. If you've got kids in tow they, and by association you, can expect to go absolutely berserk. It's wall-to-wall activity. If you're someone for whom intimate, more low-key dining is preferred, by all means stop reading the review right here. If, by contrast you like a decidedly electric experience, they don't come any more so than here. \\n\\nWhat Mighty Fine wants you to leave remembering is this...quality is their top priority. Specially imported crinkle-cut fry machine, hand-formed beef patties. Genuine Idaho potatoes and Sunkist lemonade-worthy lemons. Don't believe me? Just watch the \\"burger theater\\" behind one glass window. You can see the beef being formed. When I visited I saw a second employee walking through the area with one of the boxes of Idaho potatoes I alluded to. Colorful advertisements dot the surrounding sky blue walls. Hand-dipped Blue Bell ice cream goes into the shakes. Those shakes are part of the pandemonium behind the counter as counter help races to assemble burgers and take down orders. If you order a shake to go with your meal, your name will be scribbled onto a clear plastic cup. Your food order will be marked down on a white wax bag. Your name will be announced twice, once for the shake, the other the burger.\\n\\nIn the end all the hype about quality means zilch to me if the food isn't top shelf. Simply because I wouldn't have it any other way, I ordered a 1/2 pound hamburger with no condiments (pickles, onions, lettuce, tomatoes) spared, a bag of crinkle-cut fries which, I must tell you, is one of those \\"sharing-worthy\\" propositions. I also ordered a chocolate shake. Must keep the chocoholic in me appeased, you know.\\n\\nAcross the table from me sat a grandmotherly figure who claimed she felt the burger to be better than Top Notch. 'Fraid I don't agree with that assessment. The place is called Mighty Fine, but the burger tastes more like \\"pretty good\\". Having been to Top Notch I don't believe the overall appeal of this burger quite reaches that standard. Fresh taste for sure but not an experience that rates that high. This lady compared the vibe to that of Fuddrucker's. She has a definite point. That to is a place teeming with activity.\\n\\nOn to the fries. The taste was pleasant and, if you desire, you can use sprinkle Morton's Sea Salt on them. This is another \\"quality\\" product the place makes reference to, specifically pointing how sea salt is healthier for you. I say if you're going to a burger place, you should leave the rules of \\"what I should be eating\\" in the parking lot, 'kay? Anyway, back to the spud story. Having eaten the renowned fries served at Hyde Park Bar & Grill, the fries Mighty's fries most closely taste like, my impression boils (oops pun!!) down to this. They're...so...wimpy!! Makes the Ore-Ida fries you buy at the supermarket look enormous. I want my fries to stay with me for a little while after I leave. Put some octane on them man!!! So what if they imported a special machine for them. They have no body!! Look carries its own special importance, a quality separate from mouth feel.Yes, they are quietly tasty but come on, from an appearance standpoint they're simultaneously forgettable. \\n\\nThe chocolate shake was neato. Slurped down every luscious drop. For those whose tastes don't run to chocolate, vanilla and strawberry  shakes are available also.\\n\\nWhat'll the final damage be to your wallet. You can sample the meal I did for under 11 bucks. Not too shabby, eh?\\n\\nAll told, I'd say Mighty Fine Burgers Fries and Shakes is a commendable place to grab a burger but the overwhelming level of chaos, the lackluster fries and inescapable employment of advertising to influence my opinion keep me from concluding it belongs in any self-respecting burger fan's Top 10."},{"name":"Rontoms","address":"600 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"*Me waiting for check*\\n*Creepy guy presses receipt feed button to get some paper & places in front of me*\\n\\"Give me your number.\\"\\n\\"Sorry, I'm here with someone.\\"\\n\\"Are you going to marry him?\\"\\n\\"Well, I'm not marrying you.\\"\\n\\nDespite the random encounter that ended my night, this place is really awesome.

And angels painted on the ceiling!\\n\\nWe were seated off to the side, in a quieter room that I argue has even better theming. A life-size Belle and Beast music box softly rotates in the center of the room beneath a glass rose light. Tapestries of animated characters hang from the walls. It is, simply, spectacular.\\n\\nThe food by and large rose to the challenge. I took a chance with lamb chops and got something cooked to a perfect medium-rare, atop potatoes rosti, drizzled with a perfectly balanced roasted red pepper sauce and contrasted with a bright beet sauce. It looked great, and tasted great.\\n\\nMy wife's chicken dish was a little less memorable but still well cooked. :-D\\n\\nThe thing is, here, it's not just about the setting and the food. It's also about the service and the characters.\\n\\nService was decent, but the big miss was when I tried to make it a special occasion by giving them the opportunity to give my wife a necklace with a charm. Forget for a moment that they forgot the charm, which is the fault of the resort; I guess the best they could come up with is putting the box on a plate along with a little grey stuff?\\n\\nI kind of expected a lot more creativity than that.\\n\\nThe second thing is that without characters going around tables, the experience doesn't live up to the setting. Beast peeking his head into the room every 30 minutes doesn't count. Where's Belle, or now-human Lumiere, or Mrs. Potts?\\n\\nIt's a fine place to have dinner, but in the end I'm not really sure what the fuss is about; a little more human touch would've gone a long way."},{"name":"No.1 Beef Noodle House","address":"4741 Willingdon Avenue","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"‰∏ÄÁõ¥Âú®‰Ω†‰ª¨ÂÆ∂ÂêÉÔøΩ?ÊúÄÂñúÊ¨¢ÁâõËÇâÔøΩ?Âá†‰πéÊØèÊôöÈÉΩÂêÉ ‰ΩÜÊòØËøôÊ¨°ÂõûÊù•ÂèëÁé∞‰ª∑Ê†ºÊ∂®‰∫ÜËøô‰πàÔøΩ?‰ª•Ââç‰∏ÄÁ¢óÁâõËÇâÈù¢‰∏ÉÂùóÂ§öÂêß Áé∞Âú®11Âùó‰∫Ü ÊâÄÊúâ‰∏úË•øÈÉΩÊ∂®‰ª∑ÔøΩ?ËôΩÁÑ∂ËØ¥‰Ω†‰ª¨ÂºÄ‰∫ÜÂßêÂ¶πÈ§êÂéÖÂìçÊòØÂ§©ÔøΩ?‰ΩÜÊòØ‰∫∫ÂÆ∂Ë¥µÊúâÈÅìÁêÜ Ë£Ö‰øÆË±™ÂçéÔøΩ?‰Ω†‰ª¨ËøòÊòØ‰∏ÄÊ†∑ÁöÑÂ∫óÈù¢ ‰ª∑Ê†ºÊèêËøô‰πàÂ§ö ÂÉèÊàëËøôÊ†∑ÁöÑËÄÅÂÆ¢Êà∑ÈÉΩ‰∏ç‰ºöÂÜçÂéªÔøΩ?2017-05-22 19:29:31"},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"not sure why people suggested as best one atlanta . ordered chicken kebab, sheek kebab and chicken boti and mutton biryani except chicken kebab we thrown out everything too much oily ...hated taste too"},{"name":"Queen of Sheba","address":"2413 NE Martin Luther King Jr Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We stayed just down the street and were excited to read in the best of weekly that this place was voted best Ethiopian in Portland.

I mean, who doesn't love a good margarita and Mexican food. I was a little confused with the ambiance. It seems like Temazcal is trying to be a higher end Mexican joint with the reflective copper paneling, leather high tops but there were TVs EVERYWHERE. And by everywhere I mean not just the bar but several in the main dining room too. I'm typically cool with TVs but I was confused as to whether this was a classy Mexican joint or a sports bar. \\n\\nService: Absolutely make a reservation! We waited about an hour for a table to clear up for us on a Saturday 8 pm-ish. The bar is always packed but if you're good at shoving your way through AND getting the bartender's attention then hey, by all means tip back a tequila shot while you wait. Hostess was friendly and apologized repeatedly about the wait time--even though at one point we though she forgot about us. Our waiter was knowledgeable, prompt, and checked on us several times during the meal. He was kind enough to recommend popular drinks and entrees.\\n\\nFood/Drinks: Complementary chips and salsa/black bean dip/green chile dip for the impatient snackers. For drinks, I opted for the traditional and the cielo azul margaritas. The drinks were strong enough to bring back memories of younger tequila shot days served in a unique margarita glass with a straw and salt rim. (Side note: The margaritas are the only reason I'd return to Temazcal--they were that good). My fellow dining partner opted for the sangria rosada which she claimed was amazing and I second. For food, I ordered the grilled chicken tacos--which included 2 tacos with a side of mexican rice and black bean soup or is it a sauce. Simple, classic, hard to screw up. Portion sizes were generous and I was completely satisfied after  just one taco. Nothing impressive to write home about however. My sister ordered the mole enchiladas which came with three small-ish sized enchiladas served also with rice. She finished her entire entree so I assume that's a good thing?\\n\\nParking: Free garage or lot parking.\\n\\nWould absolutely return for drinks.

During the second recent visit, I opted for the medium and finished all of it in one sitting.\\n\\nI'm not sure if Firehouse has increased its prices; the large chicken salad sandwich cost around, if not more than, $10 when I ordered it not long ago. The prices here definitely are higher than at Subway and other sub shops, as far as I can tell.

Ugh. It was a huge mistake for us to go for our wedding anniversary, but we were in the neighborhood and thought we'd try something new. Well, the waterfront is a tourist trap, and Chart House is the trap's hinge.\\n\\nFor no real reason, the vibe here is very snooty. We were seated up a flight of narrow, single-file stairs, and we asked to be seated next to a window, since there were few diners there when we arrived (late October, 4:30PM). They hoard those windows, though, so we weren't seated near one. However, the windows aren't insulated (they sweat), so maybe this was a blessing in disguise?\\n\\nCheapest entree (plain chicken breast) was $19! You're really paying for the privilege of eating near a waterfront you in all likelihood won't even be allowed to see. \\n\\nWe were served two dirty teapots, and we waited 10 minutes between being served our tea bags and pot/cups. As an accompaniment for our tea, we were served old, dry lemon slices. The service was awful; we never received refills on our water, and everything else was so slow to arrive.\\n\\nWe ordered the Dynamite Mahi-Mahi ($35.99) and something called \\"50th Surf & Turf\\" ($27.99). The steak was overdone, as was the linguine (it was mushy). I wanted to splurge on a higher-end fish, hence my choice of mahi-mahi, but it was a huge mistake. Crab-crusted? No. Crab-smeared. It was spicy, but wasn't listed on the menu as being spicy. The accompanying coconut rice was just chicken broth, Rice-A-Roni-caliber fake pilaf, and no taste of anything else. \\n\\nWhen I brought this to the attention of the water, he said, \\"no, it's coconut milk. There's coconut milk - it's the only rice we have.\\" No. Just, no. I cook with coconut milk all the time; I know what it tastes like, what it acts like, its texture, how it cooks, its fragrance. Protip: one thing coconut doesn't taste like is chicken. There was no ginger, no coconut, nothing but cheap rice and broth. \\n\\nThe waiter had a really bad attitude. He focused - loudly - on the fact that I said my rice tasted like pilaf. He said, \\"aha, we don't serve pilaf!\\" I replied, \\"I know that. This is why I said it tastes *LIKE* pilaf. And not *WAS* pilaf.\\" It was in such poor taste to upbraid me on how I'm wrong about what I was (and wasn't) served. \\n\\nThe chef then came over to the table (we didn't ask for him) and we talked briefly. He thanked me for my concern but did not budge on the quality or recipe of the rice. He asked if there was anything they could do for us and I said, \\"like what?\\" It's classless that he put me on the spot to say \\"I shouldn't have to pay for a dish I couldn't eat as advertised\\". He should have comped me rather than ask me to ask for it. I didn't ask to be comped, since I felt put on the spot (and in front of three other packed tables), and thus we paid $70+ for a totally inedible meal in an inhospitable venue.\\n\\nUnderwhelming. Disappointing. Getting a terrible meal from someone who's apologetic and respects you is one thing, but what set this experience apart as being particularly bad was the inappropriate behavior of the staff. Outrageous price for what we received, which was nothing.

It was SO good.\\n\\nSecond visit, I called ahead to confirm they had at least one of their specials. Indeed, they had a couple orders left so I got my Crispy Roasted Pork with the pate add on. I have to admit, the pate didn't add any extra wow, but really how do you add on to an over-the-top sumptuous sandwich? \\n\\nThird time was the charm.

If you like Peking Duck, you'll love this sandwich.   \\n\\nI've also had the shrimp salad roll and the spring rolls. Both were great, actually, although I found the garlic aioli dip for the spring rolls to be an odd compliment. Nothing that couldn't be fixed with a big squirt of Sriracha. \\n\\nService is pretty quick -- but they're hand filling each sub to order, so I hope they add a couple people to the line as it continues to get busier.

So conveniently located just a few minutes from my house, a perfect addition to Yaletown. \\n\\nOh, and to anyone who is complaining about their prices being too high... I'd really like know where you regularly order food. To me, their prices are completely FAIR and on par with any other place in the city. They have to pay their rent and their employees, you know, and they have to keep purchasing those high quality ingredients we're enjoying.

The Sabres were playing but there were three other games on the TVs in the place, not entirely unexpected I guess.  Our food didn't take long to arrive, only about 15 minutes for a medium pizza.  Now for the good, because the pizza was good, overall.  It had the right amount of cheese, which means a lot.  The size of the pizza was big for a standard medium.  And the crust was a nice combo of crunchy/soft.  Overall, though, I was pretty disappointed...this isn't a place I'd go back to back home.  The base of the pizza/dough didn't have much structural integrity, which is typical of Buffalo style pizza, but it was thin.  Way too thin, almost NYC style thin.  I was expecting something much fluffier and doughier.  For some reason it was sliced into squares rather than slices, which I've only ever seen done in St Louis/on a sheet pizza.  The chicken fingers on the pizza also just didn't taste right to me, which I figured out after some close examination.  The chicken was actually processed, and had more of a nugget breading than finger breading.  The chicken in chicken fingers is never processed/maintains a natural shred, and the breading is closer to panko than nugget-type.

The cast members speak in French (albeit basic French lol) in the castle there are digital images of the song \\"Be Our Guest\\" in French, and they even serve warm French rolls lol.  Disney captured everything about Beast's castle in this restaurant. From walking up to the giant front doors, to walking in and seeing the knights armor, etc. The restaurant is split into 3 separate areas (Ballroom, the West Wing, and Rose Gallery).  They were seating people in the Ballroom and the West Wing.  We were excited because we got to sit in the West Wing. While both rooms are done well, I liked the WW since it was smaller and more intimate. In the room there is the famous rose, and at times you would hear thunder and a ripped painting of the prince on the wall would suddenly show the Beast. The Ballroom is very open, louder, not as intimate although absolutely beautiful.  I would love to sit there next to the back windows since Disney made it look like it was snowing!   The Rose Gallery we were told is used for quick service during lunch hours i believe.  The Rose Gallery had a beautiful giant Beast/Bell Dancing music box in the center with Beast/Belle paintings around the room.\\n\\nFood:\\nOk so now that we've gone through the decor, let's talk about what we all want to know. THE FOOD!  This is not your typical MK restaurant. It is by far the best dinner I've had in the MK, and in almost all the parks except possibly Epcot.  We both started off with a glass of wine (Yes, you can drink at BOG but you cannot take it out of the restaurant and it's only served at dinner),  my wife had the French Onion soup and the Salad trio. I had the Potato Leek soup and the Pork rack with au gratin macaroni and seasonal vegetables.  My wife loved everything she had except there was a tomato and green bean salad but that's because she does not care for tomatoes.  I had a bite from all of her dishes and the Watermelon/Radish/Mint salad reminded me of one at Sanaa, the beet salad was tasty and had differing textures and flavors that worked well together. The French Onion soup was tasty and not salty like some FO soups can be.  The potato leek soup was creamy and had small potato chunks that were nice since I don't like huge chunks in my soup.  It was surprisingly lighter than I expected which was great.  My wife also loved it.  The Pork Rack chop was fantastic. It was flavorful and cooked perfectly. Not dry at all.  It came with a great red wine au jus, green beans and a au gratin macaroni on the side. Everything was great.  I can't wait to try the other dishes on the menu.  \\n\\nService:\\n\\nService was great, everyone made you feel like you were royalty.  Our waitress explained to us they were having issues with the computer so things might get messed up but we didn't care since we were too busy exploring the different rooms.  It took a little bit of time to get the check, but I know that they are still working out the kinks. It's not the service's fault, and it's to be expected, but the space is so romantic and intimate it's easy to forget there are CHILDREN present.  Everything was great until the child sitting behind us started crying at the top of his lungs for about 5 minutes straight. Obviously there will be plenty of families at this restaurant, but I hope they take care of their crying children for the couples that want to experience a truly romantic experience at the MK.

I think I fulfilled part of the dream by eating in this gorgeous restaurant.  I was looking for a place to eat and wanted to try something outside of the hamburgers, hot dogs, etc. and I saw this place on the map.  It was about 11 AM on Sunday, so I figured the wait would be really long or there would be nothing available.  But, I was able to get a table right away.  SCORE! Once I got inside, they provided me with a rose bell (which tracks what you are ordered and where you are seating, etc).  There are kiosks where you order your food and you scan the rose bell.  Once you order, you can go into the dining hall and choose a seat.  \\n\\nThe inside of the castle is GORGEOUS!! There is 3 areas that you can sit in.  I opted for the main hall because they had a very pretty window where it seems like it's snowing.  I scored a table right next to the window.  Once you place your rose bell, a waiter will come by with your food.  Everything else (utensils, drinks, etc) is self serve at a station.  The food came out very quickly and our server gave me a complimentary grey stuff cupcake.  I have to say that the food was somewhere a little above average.  My braised pork was a little dry and not tender and my green beans were a little soggy.   I was a little disappointed in the food.  I would definitely like to come back here for dinner as based upon other reviews, it looks like there might be better options.  The grey stuff however, was pretty delicious! Not too sweet, fresh, and moist.  I would pay for this next time I am here. \\n\\nOverall, I would come back here again.  The food (although a little disappointing) was definitely better than the fast food options in the park.  And nothing can beat the gorgeous setting of the restaurant.

Twenty minutes later we had no drinks or any attention at all, and we started wondering if maybe telling the second guy to take a hike was a mistake!

I almost expected the beef to be really dry, but it was actually pretty tender. Between that and the flaky crust, it was awesome. I usually don't like my savory dishes sweet, but the light hoison sauce was a nice touch. The dumplings were really good as well. Lots of flavor in those little dumplings and they were nice and crispy. The only dish I didn't care for were the wontons. It came out with a heaping pile of chili sauce on top, but it wasn't impressive. The wontons themselves were ok, but it didn't set my mouth on fire like I expected. I figured with all that chili oil and chili paste it would be incredibly hot, but it wasn't. It was just oily. You're better off sticking with the regular dumplings.

But if you're craving spicy tofu stew served piping hot in stone pots, this is the place for you.

I've tried a couple other flavors but they were bland. The stew comes out scalding hot with an egg on the side that you're supposed to crack open into the stew. Then, let it cook for a minute or two. Once the egg starts to form, the stew should be cooled enough to eat. Even then, it will stay hot in the stone pot for the duration of your meal. \\n\\nNote that the spicy/hotness level is very relative. A \\"spicy\\" level of the kimchi tofu stew is *very* spicy (I prefer moderate), while the \\"spicy\\" level of the seafood tofu stew is not very spicy. \\n\\nThe meat dishes are decent, but not exceptional. I've tried their spicy chicken, bulgogi, and spicy pork. If you think their bibimbap (mixed rice bowl) is good, you have not had good bibimbap.

They gave me 2 salsas (green & a red) which I didn't care for, I thought the spicyness and freshness of the salsas didn't mesh well with the Karaage chicken flavour. I would've liked to see a more Japanese spin to the salsa such as having a teriyaki sauce base. \\n\\nVeggie Burrito monthly special (4/5)- there was a ton of veggies in there that tasted harmoniously together. It contained avocado, spring mix and kale, yam tempura, mango, peppers, tomato, and ginger. The sour cream and teriyaki sauce added lots of flavours too. I felt that it was a lot soggier though because of the tomato and I wasn't particularly a fan of the sharp ginger (although others may find it refreshing). \\n\\nBeet ice cream (5/5)- for $5 you get two average sized scoops which is worth it for vegan ice cream! It's coconut milk based and the unique beet flavour really complimented it well!\\n\\n//THE SERVICE//\\nThe service was great and quick for take-out.

Oddfish is one of the newer additions to the local casual fine dining scene.  A restaurant focused on fresh seafood but with a more casual vibe is always welcomed, however, it is definitely a mid/high end price point dining option, as you can probably tell by the location of the restaurant.\\n\\nWe came here for a nice low key dinner to celebrate my partner's birthday.  The menu is small, with a changing fresh sheet (chalk board) depending on what is fresh and available that day.  We decided to try the popular Seafood Hot Mess, which is a medley of various seafood items served together on one big plate to share.  Priced at $65, it is actually one of the best valued items on the menu and I would highly recommend trying it if you don't want to break the bank here.  \\n\\nThe dish consists of a layer of squid, several prawns, scallops,mussels and clams, with a fish filet and half a lobster served in a olive oil based sauce with various spices and a fresh squeeze of lemon. All the seafood itself is really fresh and nicely seasoned as well.  We could barely finish the whole plate between the 2 of us.  However I will say that the ratio of seafood items is a little off for sure.  There is so much squid that by the time you are half way through you really don't want anymore, not surprising because it is probably one of the cheapest items on the list so it is almost filler-esque for the fish.  Could definitely use more than 2 prawns for sure, and taking out the fish filet might be a good option - it just doesn't really fit in with the rest of the shellfish options in the dish.  The highlights were the scallops (so fresh and flavorful!!!!!!) and the half lobster(always fun to crack open a lobster on a date!!).  We are glad we ordered the Seafood Hot Mess as first timers because we had a good option of trying several seafood items so we can be more selective with our ordering for our next visit. \\n\\nFor the sides - we ordered some charred greens and baguette to start. Goes well with the meal - not much to write home about but just good supplement to the meal.  Very simple and straightforward. \\n\\nDrinks were decent and a pretty nice wine menu too.  They definitely make them cocktails strong that's for sure!\\n\\nOverall I had a pleasant experience at Oddfish, the service was great, food was decent but I see it at restaurant that serves seafood, not a restaurant that specializes in seafood and has innovative and memorable ways of presenting and interpreting the ingredients.

I have no idea what the poor souls do that drive regular compacts, or heaven forbid, a truck or SUV. \\n\\nYou will most likely wait for a table because it is always crowded. You have some bar options while you wait, the crowded one downstairs, where you are unlikely to get a drink in the 15-30 minute table wait, or the dank, dark, smokey bar upstairs, where last night around midnight a drunk and disheveled divorcee was getting groped by an affliction-clad young man on the black leather couch. \\n\\nWhen it is your turn to be seated, if it is nice out, you may be tempted to sit outside on the patio. Don't do it. Your ears will be periodically assaulted by screeching from fake owls designed to keep grackles from stealing your food.

I ATE THE REGGIE DELUXE THREE TIMES IN A WEEK!!! I couldn't only go to this place. I currently live in the South (in Georgia), where biscuits and chicken are plentiful and hardly done wrong. But, hands down, The Reggie Deluxe blows away any chicken biscuit or any breakfast sandwich I've ever eaten. What used to be my favorite breakfast sandwich is The Big Nasty at Hominy Grill in Charleston, SC. But The Reggie Deluxe is bigger and nastier. The biscuit is better and flakier. The chicken is larger, more tender, juicier, and unbelievably crispy. The gravy is likely laced with some illegal substance because it is honestly out of this world. Then unlike The Big Nasty, The Reggie Deluxe features oozy cheese, bacon, and an egg on top. This is the breakfast sandwich and chicken biscuit that all others aspire to.

The soba here was good - likely the best in the greater Boston area - I would get it again, but I wouldn't drive an hour to get it.  The surprise star here was the tempura.  The grilled items were solid as well.\\n\\nOne of the staff (perhaps one of the proprietors?) was kind enough to spend some time talking with us about the business and the food - They have a special soba-making machine from Japan and make the soba fresh daily.  Apparently the chef can make hand-made soba, but does it infrequently, as they are still ironing out operations.  We saw a few signs of that with the service, but the staff were universally helpful and friendly and I am confident that things will be running smoothly soon.\\n\\nBeing more traditional, we had the tenzaru soba and the kitsune soba.  The soba was very thin and cyllindrical (which prompted me to ask about how it was made) and had good texture in the tenzaru soba, while being a little soft in the kitsune soba.  Both dashi had good flavor, and didn't give us the dry mouth feeling one can get at some restaurants (I'm looking at you Ittyo.).  The kitsune soba dashi was very strong and slightly sweet - almost like the kind you would use as dipping sauce in a zaru soba - not for drinking.  The aburaage in the kitsune soba was very tasty - it had been cooked in sweet soy dashi beforehand.  The tempura in the tenzaru soba was excellent, if perhaps slightly overcooked.  It was a generous portion and included shiso leaf and lotus root, which I really appreciated.  After we were done, they served us sobayu - the water used to cook the soba - a nice touch.\\n\\nWe tried some of the grilled items - basic yakitori with green onions, tsukune, enoki, and kalbi (this was more korean style).  The yakitori was very tasty.  The tsukune had a good flavor, and the tare did not overpower the taste of the chicken.  It also came with a raw quail egg, which was a very nice touch.\\n\\nFinally, we tried the green tea cheesecake, which the staff told us comes from a Japanese bakery in New York.  It was good - not too sweet, and went very well with the green tea ice cream.  \\n\\nThe space was very tastefully decorated, from the entry to the very clean bathrooms.\\n\\nI have enjoyed soba more at other restaurants in the US, but I would say that Sugidama is the best in the greater Boston area.  It certainly has the best tempura I have had so far in greater Boston.  I am excited to go again and eat their tempura!"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"3325 SE Division St, Ste 1","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"fucking phenomenal. worth every penny. despite the fact that there are multiple locations, or as i would say in my book--a shitty chain--blue star donuts is nothing but more than that. small menu, but dont let that fool you. the 3 donuts i had were soft, loaded with flavor, and left me leaving for more. let the unique seasonings and flavor combos take you on a ride.\\n\\nBlueberry Bourbon Basil- stunning colors. soft to the touch. not messy. basil smell, unique smokey flavor.\\n\\nCointreau Creme Brulee- messy, but worth it. needs more creme filling because its amazing. thick, smooth, and slightly sweet.\\n\\npeach creme- this was a seasonal one, not sure what the full name was, but the donut was stuffed with a peach creme/filling. talk about flavor--here it is! the stuffing was perfect, but again i think it needs more filling because its just that damn good."},{"name":"Pho Thaison","address":"2121 E Oltorf St, Ste 12B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellant food and service!

The outside is well-manicured, clean, and classy looking. Our hopes were high and we were hungry. \\n\\nLooks can be deceiving! We strolled through those doors and the smell of fish was overwhelming. And even though we thought that $16.99 was a little spendy for Chinese buffet entry, we decided to risk it. With large plate in tow we headed to the buffet. The food was a variety of Asian and American cuisine that looked pretty average, edible. We grabbed some safe-looking food and headed back to the table. \\n\\nBeing a southern man, my husband was excited to try the crawfish. However when he broke them open, the meat was grey and rotten. The fried food was stale, chewy, and cold and the honey shrimp was unbelievably sweet and tasted old. I found that the only gem of that first 'go-round' was the saut√©ed mushrooms that had flavor but were stone cold. We scrapped our plates and headed towards the Mongolian grill station, thinking it was going to be our only hope at fresh food. \\n\\nTo start, the grill attendant was extremely rude! We picked through what little meat and veggie selection they had and noticed they were out of noodles. We asked if they had any noodles left and the young man glared and slammed his utensil down, grabbed a handful of noodles from a neighboring fridge and threw them into the serving tray. I couldn't believe it! We scooted away almost apologetically, feeling unwelcome and embarrassed. The grilled noodle dish ended up being tasty, but the awful customer service left a sour taste in our mouths. \\n\\nWe ended with icecream. We had three choices: vanilla, chocolate, or vanilla and chocolate. The only topping was an old can of Hershey syrup with a make-shift pump in it. Reaching for the spoons we spotted a used dirty band-aid on one and opted for a fork instead. \\n\\nEven though our waitress was attentive and kind throughout our meal she ignored our frowns and obvious contempt. We begrudgingly paid our $40.00 bill and hurried away. \\n\\nFinally on our way out, my husband needed to use the bathroom but the men's restroom and hallways leading into the restrooms were completely flooded! \\n\\nThis entire experience was awful. There are so many Chinese dining options in Beaverton, I couldn't imagine finding a reason to ever come back here. I felt cheated out of my money.

We ordered biscuits and gravy with, at the waitress' suggestion, both the sausage and the herbed mushroom gravy. Both were delicious and served with giant, fresh, homemade biscuits.

So, I'm no stranger to buffets. I actually used to be quite excited to go. The food wasn't half bad, and of course my favorite thing about Ryan's was the dessert bar. Given my history with the restaurant chain, I wasn't opposed to having a quick dinner there when my husband wanted to go one evening. We arrived at about 8:30 and the restaurant closes at 9:00 so I knew we wouldn't have a prime selection of foods. The food that we did have was pretty terrible; bland city. There was a really large selection of mexican food, which I wasn't in the mood for, so I settled for cabbage, some roast beef-esque meat, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. Everything on my plate was really blah, with the exception of the roast beef gravy (which probably came out of a can). I know this wasn't a five restaurant, , but for 11 bucks a head, you'd think they could afford a little salt and pepper. A couple of the items on my plate were a bit cold too, but I guess that's to be expected given the late hour at which we arrived. I don't remember what my hubby ate, but I remember he wasn't satisfied either. I was so disappointed by my meal that I couldn't even muster up the enthusiasm to visit the dessert bar. The best thing about our visit to this Ryan's was our drinks. The server was pretty nice too. We only stayed there for about 20 minutes which is like a blink of an eye in buffet time.

Not sure what the problem is with the service but they do have service issues. Over dinner with family and friends our tableware was cleared entirely after our appetizer. Fine nice touch, but they did not replace it. Before we could eat our salads we had to ask for silverware. Then they did it again, and before we could eat our entrees we had to ask for silverware again. Then, and you guessed it, they cleared everything again. Got our desert order, brought our deserts to the table and left. We were again left looking at each other wondering if we were the target of some prank. Nope, not the case. I complained again, we ate our desert and left. \\nThis is just one example. Of the six times I've been, each time there were serious service issues. Something here just is not working.

We arrived at 7:30 pm on a Saturday and as expected, it was pretty crowded.  \\n2.   We sat at the bar until around 7:50 .  At first the bartender told us we'd have to wait because she was in the weeds. Eventually we got a drink, but nothing notable one way or the other. \\n3.  Sat at a table and after about 15 minutes our server came and offered to refresh our drinks. Way too long!\\n4.  Brought us a drink, which we finished.  Server came again and we ordered another drink along with three appetizers. It's probably 8:15 at this point.  \\n5.  Server showed up with a plate of pork rinds at 8:30 and apologized that apps weren't ready. \\n6. At 8:45 we moved to a different table because we were tired of sitting at a high top. \\n7. Apps showed up around 9:00 and dinner order was taken shortly thereafter. \\n8. At 9:30 or so, we asked where dinner was.   Server apologized and offered to comp apps. \\n9. We finally asked to speak to a manager at 9:50.  After we complained that we'd been there for 2 hours, his VERY SURLY response was that they were slammed. I said that BBQ is made hours in advance and that nothing we preferred was made to order. \\"Well? \\" was the response. We asked the manager, \\"Jason\\" for the owners name. We were told there were \\"6 owners at corporate\\", but \\"Chris\\" might be  at the restaurant the next day. Jason also made a point to come back and tell us that our order wasn't placed until 9:18 and that it hadn't really been that long.  He did offer to comp our dinner though. \\n10.  At 10:05 we finally stood up to leave as our dinner showed up. Everything was cold. \\n11.  Last visit to Smokebelly. Luvies and Greater Good BBQ are both close by.

From what I have seen in previous reviews and heard from other people's experiences there is apparently an unwritten or at least an ill enforced rule against large parties (more than 8) sitting together.  However on several occasions I have seen them put 2 large tables together to accommodate large parties.  In fact last night during this whole debacle I saw 2 tables together to the left of ours for a party of 15.  I'm not sure why the management would want to discourage a large party from spending their money at Trudy's on alcohol sales, but the manager did not make any effort to rectify the issue even after we informed the waitress that we would be leaving because of the situation.  I'm not sure if I will ever be going here again.  Not because the food, drinks, or even service was bad, but because I don't want to spend my money at an establishment that makes their customers feel unwanted.

The tandoori chicken is one piece of chicken that is slightly reddish in color.  I also recommend the chicken 65 dish for something different.  It is unique.

My husband and I LOVE Via Napoli! Yes, the food is a little pricey but besides it being Disney the quality of the food is beyond! The appetizers are very good, the calamari is extremely light and crispy and pairs well with the marinara sauce. We also got the arancini which were crispy on the outside and filled with creamy rice inside. The pizza was well beyond our expectations, the dough, the cheese, the pepperoni, the sauteed mushrooms, everything was perfect. With a pitcher of Peroni to help wash it down you really cannot go wrong! On weekends (and during peak season I believe) they open a pizza window. The pizza is more of a Sicillian style and very different from the pizza served inside but still good, especially when drinking around the world at Epcot!

Their spicy broth is a must; and even for spice enthusiasts their white (herbal) broth is worth getting as it is super delicious. \\n\\nIIRC, their beef and lamb combo is served with the Premium Lamb Leg for lamb and Supreme Angus Beef for beef. They are good choices, but I like the Supreme Lamb Shoulder a lot more as they do seem to have a stronger lamb taste to it.\\n\\nWe also really like the mushroom basket and the house meatball platter. The house balls here are clearly superior than other mean/fish balls, as you can clearly see that they are homemade. House meatball platter gives you three of each house beef, lamb, fish, and shrimp balls; variety makes a hotpot experience a lot better.\\n\\nGlass noodle is a great choice when the broths are of high quality, as it is the one type of noodle that really absorbs the broth. Keep in mind it cooks very quickly, just hold on to the noodle when you put it into a boiling broth and in a few seconds they will be ready. \\n\\nAlso, try the quail eggs."},{"name":"Hokkaido Chinese & Japanese Buffet","address":"5737 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"OMG this place is horrible we will not be back.

The Calamari was not overcooked, the Sweet Chili Chicken stayed tender, and the Cheeseburger Sliders remained juicy. I had the Lobster Ravioli for my entree and was definitely disappointed! It was bland and lacked any flavor that resembled lobster or any other type of seafood. Although boozy, the double Caesar I ordered tasted weird like it wasn't real Clamato juice.

The parking lot was completely full so we parked in the adjoining pet spa lot.  The signs in the pet spa lot made clear that no overnight parking would be allowed and that parking was for customers only. As the spa closed at 5:30pm, we thought we were in the clear. \\nWe entered the Black Lobster and though they had \\"lost\\" our reservation, they kindly seated us on the deck in front of other patrons who had not made a reservation.  There was not a mention at all of any parking issues with the neighbors at this time or any other during the evening...\\nPerhaps because our table had been hastily put together on the deck, we did not have utensils.  When they did come, after our bread had been sitting out on the table for a while, they were filthy.  \\nAs we were enjoying the clam chowder -which is quite good with a hint of nutmeg- one of my dinner companions (there were 4 of us) overhead someone at the table next to us say something about a tow truck.  Sure enough, we ran to the lot and our car was ALREADY up on the platform of the truck bed.  We were told it would cost us $130 to get the car from the lot or $93.00 cash on the spot -and of course the tow guy didn't have the $7.00 change....\\nWe returned to the restaurant patio and our food was ALREADY sitting out on the table despite my having spoken to the waitress about going to the lot to pay for the tow truck. And though our food was out and already tepid, our utensils had been cleared and again we were left with just our hands to tear into our meal.  \\nThe fillet Mignon (Surf & Turf $33) was burnt.  The Mexican Striped Bass was completely drowned in a cheap tasting salsa with liquid practically spilling over the side of the plate. The fried Calamari plate was ok.  Not too rubbery but nothing to gasp over. The steamed seafood was ok but didn't come with all that it promised though the chef did eventually come out with the missing food.\\n While we were forcing down our meals, the woman at the table next to ours began to choke on her food.  It took at least 2 people -maybe a third- to get her airway clear with the Heimlich maneuver.  Yikes!!\\nThe Chef was kind enough to come out and apologize about the food -they took the steak off of the bill- but denied any wrong doing in not mentioning -by way of sign or staff- that the lot next to the restaurant was off limits.  \\nWe pressed the manager for an explanation as to why the Pet Spa owner would be so bitter as to have a tow company run a 24 hour surveillance of her tiny lot and it turns out that some patrons of the Black Lobster had defecated in her parking lot and sprayed graffiti all over her property -if you go you can see the paint over...\\nAll in all, lousy food, service and a waste of a babysitters fee.

Then again, that's not what they're advertising here at Laughing Planet so I can't really fault them for it. If you're trying to eat healthy and you're craving the idea of a burrito without the decadence and self loathing that goes along with a real burrito, Laughing Planet should do the job nicely.

I decided on hot green tea, as I assumed I would devour some fried foods. Surprisingly I stayed away from most of it as there were so many better options. In all honesty, I tried several but after eating clean for so long my palette did not welcome any of it. To the bin it goes. The waitress was attentive and not overbearing. Quite pleasant. There indeed where plenty of sushi options. I had plenty of the strings beans and broccoli that I picked from a mixed vegetable dish, as it was much more crispy. Yum just the way I like. The ice cream was made from real cream which was so appreciated.  All in all I would return. There are so many areas with food and something for everyone. The only negative was that some trays were empty and most were low. Again, everything was hot.  Clean bathrooms. My advice is be sure to refill food faster and also try a different chicken for the chicken and broccoli as it was a bit gelatinous. Hubby tried the ribs and said they were tasty. A little sweet for my palette on that particular day. But I may try it again, as I used to enjoy the rib tips ok NY. Yea, that's exactly the ones they make here.

As a huge Beauty & the Beast fan, this part of the new Fantasyland was one of the must-dos on my list for the trip.\\n\\nThe location is made to look like Beast's castle.  You check in before the \\"drawbridge\\" and receive a buzzer to wait outside for the meal.  It really does make you feel like you're walking in to Beast's castle!  A host comes out to you, handing you a candelabra (like Lumiere!) to walk to your table.  We were seated in the ballroom dining area, but I hear you can request the West Wing and sometimes the Rose Gallery. In hind sight, I should have spent more time walking through the West Wing after dinner!  It was loud and busy, but not so loud you couldn't carry conversation.  While it was kid-friendly and there were plenty of them around, it definitely felt like a nice place.\\n\\nDinner at Be Our Guest is also the ONLY TIME you can drink alcohol in the Magic Kingdom.  For real.  I guess Walt didn't want booze in the MK, but at our dinner Dan was able to get a Saison Dupont from Belgium, while I enjoyed a red wine from Nuits-Saints-Georges in Burgundy, a place I remember well for its wine.\\n\\nOur meals came with some good bread and butter to start.  Our entrees came very quickly.  I had the Grilled Strip Steak with Garlic-Herb Butter and Pommes Frites, while Dan had the Herb-crusted Lamb Rack with a Stone-ground Mustard Demi-glace serve with Buttered Celery Root and Seasonal Vegetables.  Dan loved his lamb, and my steak was delicious.\\n\\nBut of course, we had to save room for dessert.  Everyone told us to try the \\"Grey Stuff\\" as the movie's song suggests!  They bring out a fancy dessert cart and plate up your choices tableside.  Dan loved it, as it was kind of a chocolate cookie shell with grey frosting.  He loves cookies and cream so it was definitely his style.  I preferred the Strawberry Cream Cheese Cupcake, and promptly devoured most of it.  We each shared dessert but had a clear favorite.  It was one of the best cupcakes I have ever had.\\n\\nAfter dinner, we were allowed to walk through the other rooms to see them.  I was a little buzzed from the wine, so I didn't linger as long as I might have.  You can meet for photos with Beast in his study on your way out. \\n\\nOverall, this was our favorite meal at Disney, hence the 5-star review that I don't give out so often.  I hear the walk-in lunch is a completely different experience, so that may skew some of the reviews, but I wouldn't hesitate to do the dinner again."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"By the grace of God, we got a Saturday evening reservation on the spot due to a cancellation.

Jiko was very highly rated, so we gave this a try and were not disappointed. \\nJiko is the upscale option at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. If you haven't been, you really need to get there extra early and spend some time exploring the grounds. The hotel lobby is really beautiful and has lots to see inside. You have to go out back and see the animal viewing area. If it's after dark, I would also cross to the far end of the back patio area and they have a ranger with some night vision goggles so you can see the animals milling about in the distance. Pretty cool.\\n\\nThe restaurant, as you would expect, has a lot of African-inspired art and decorations. There is a tiny bar near the entrance with just a few seats. My wife was pregnant on this trip, so we didn't spend too much time here, but might on a future trip as they have a lot of unique drinks to choose from here. (Which, in my opinion, Disney could do a better job of, as you'll tend to see the same handful of drinks at just about every restaurant.) I had the Mount Kilmarita, a margarita variation which was pretty tasty. \\n\\nWe were seated promptly at our reservation time. The service was very attentive throughout the night, though I found her to be a bit devoid of emotion. Maybe I'm a bit heavy on the expectations, but I feel like at a place like this where I'm paying top dollar, you should get a memorable service experience in addition to a memorable food one. I recall being very impressed at the California Grill. \\n\\nAnyhow, we started with Taste of Africa, which is an assortment of dips and breads and was a good way to experience a lot of different flavors on one dish. Having not eaten much African-inspired food living in the New England area, I wanted to challenge myself with this one, so for the main course I went with the monkfish, which was served whole in a tomato-based sauce with potatoes. This made for an outstanding presentation, and was really flavorful. It wasn't the easiest thing to eat having to pick through the bones, and weeding out a lot of the smaller ones, but I was pretty happy to have given that a try. If I go back, I would probably get the filet that the wife ordered and the flavor of the red wine sauce with it was off the charts. Really awesome.\\n\\nSo if you're forced to be down at Disney and want to try something different, tasteful and memorable, you will probably not be disappointed with Jiko."},{"name":"Sweet Carrot","address":"1417 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"We've only been here once but loved it and will\\n be back.

I usually know what I want anyways.\\n\\nOne thing that caught my eye that WAS on the menu was the deep fried eggplant. I ordered this with no bonito flakes and requested a yam and avocado roll be made. (not on the menu)\\n\\nThe eggplant dish came first. I was expecting some battered tempura dish as usual and was surprised to see long slices of eggplant in sauce brought out. It was SO delicious!

Just enough of a kick without needing to gulp down a giant glass of water.\\n\\nI'm not sure what happened, but for some reason the rest of our table's orders took half an hour to reach the table.

They didn't have the sushi bar open during afternoon so 2 of our party had to change their orders since they still gave us the sushi menu to look at. The replacement dishes were not very good and neither were the ones that the other 4 of us ordered.  \\n\\nThey brought out the wrong order for both my girlfriend and another friend of mine.  She sent hers back and he just tried his and liked it enough to just keep it. \\n\\nThey brought back another dish for my gf which was also wrong again!  Not a special order screw up or anything, just a completely different dish. It was almost too spicy even for me to eat which is saying something, but at this point everyone else was half done with their dishes so I shared my very very tough Korean BBQ shredded beef, which was gristly and not very good, but not so spicy as to be non-edible like her dish was.\\n\\nWe also ordered a bottle of sake which they brought out cold.  That is fine as some sake is served cold.  We had a few shots of it and decided we would like it hot. I asked for them to heat it up and they said that kind of sake doesn't come hot. I nicely asked, \\"Well can you heat it up anyway?\\" To which the waiter said, \\"NO!\\". So I ordered another small sake hot.  I mean come on... at least throw it in the microwave.  It wasn't busy and there is no reason not to accommodate that request. \\n\\nI made the mistake of eating the leftovers from the second wrong dish that was served to my gf today. Way too spicy without any other flavors, I had to add some salt and some sugar just to make it palatable. I now regret eating it.

Not that I won't be back, the food is standard mainstream -Main Street fare; it's not bad, but not super amazing either.

The toast (sourdough is usually my choice) and hash brown are good though; their bacon is crisp; but, unless your name is Ryan S, you really can't mess those up. My favorite dish for morning is Western Omelette; unfortunately, Grand Day's is a bit runny. Not too runny to make it uneatable, but runny enough to notice. Their Western lacks enough meat, and lacks the slight, spicy kick that gives the dish it's name. It's cook way too thin and leaves my stomach still growing. I've had their Egg and Cheese sandwich too; these are ok, but come in too small a serving. I've said it before but, I'd rather pay an extra buck or two for a bigger serving. Their coffee is mediocre. It's watered down and lacks the bitter bite that I enjoy. But it still has the important ingredient--caffeine.\\n\\nLike I said, I will still come back, the foods is just ok.

In the Pantheon of fast food burgers, it all begins with In-n-Out, then goes to Burgerville and then JOE'S BURGERS, right before you hit McDonalds.  Before we bash Joe's to death, let's put it all in perspective...this is a KIOSK burger joint in the middle of Oregon's best mall.  Very small kitchen which means almost no prep room, which translates into pretty much everything is frozen.  If you were expecting Fuddrucker's, then you were just aiming in the wrong spot.

The typecast has a lot to do with having to order at the counter, having everything served on styrofoam, the plastic utensils, the plastic cafeteria tray, ... and fortunately, the prices. It's very inexpensive Indian food - most dishes are in the $6-7 range. You can get 1 piece of Naan for $1.49 and saffron rice for $2.99. I came with two friends, and we shared 3 dishes, 2 naan, & 1 saffron rice. Each of the dishes also comes with a styrofoam bowl of sliced raw onions & sliced jalapenos. None of us were raw onion fans but we all agreed it complemented well with the spicy saucy Indian dishes. \\n\\nOur 3 Indian dishes were the Chicken 65 of course (after all, it was highlighted in the menu as \\"Top 10 in Atlanta, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution\\"), the Chana Masala, and my favorite, Chicken Tikka Masala -- all served in styrofoam bowls. The Chicken 65 was very good - it looked & tasted like tandoori chicken nuggets. It came with two very different tasting sauces, one of them \\"amli chutney\\".  The Chana Masala were chickpeas in a very spicy sauce ... and unfortunately, in a pool of grease. We had to empty one of our styrofoam bowls so that my friend could scoop out the grease ... gross. The dish itself was ok ... but I won't be ordering that again. The Chicken Tikka Masala was good (but then again, I don't know anyone who's ever messed up Tikka Masala) -- except disappointingly only a few pieces of chicken. \\n\\nI remember my first time to Zyka back in the mid 90s or so ... I had ordered their saffron ice cream which was not only a unique flavor, but served in a clay flower pot. For that, it became one of my all-time memorable desserts. However, sadly, they don't have it anymore :( Only mango & pistachio. And now, they serve the ice cream in these pre-packaged individual serving containers, and there are containers & containers in their glass freezer behind the counter. I got the pistachio ice cream ... let's just say it ain't no saffron ice cream experience. \\n\\nAnyway, Zyka's good if you want cheap Indian food.

Casa Chapala is much more of an interior Mexican place, so they don't do the standard queso, crispy tacos, etc. They _do_ make their salsa in front of you, though, which is a nice touch, so you can munch fresh salsa and chips while you peruse the menu.\\n\\nAlthough I work right next door, I don't eat there all THAT often, mostly because it's a bit pricier than I'd like. Even their lunch menu's on the steep side. But splitting a tray of nachos with a friend or just saving the rest for later is certainly do-able. I usually opt for nachos, a burrito, or quesadillas, and they're always fairly tasty. \\n\\nI recently discovered they do breakfast tacos, too, and those are much more affordable, so that may become a part of my morning ritual. Chorizo, potato, and egg is quite yummy, if a bit greasy. Maybe I'll switch over to bacon, instead. Mmmm, bacon.\\n\\nI also want to give kudos to the owner. The location probably isn't the best -- it's tucked away in the corner of a shopping center and, I'm sure, often overlooked. But he always seems to be trying various ways of getting people to stop by, such as offering \\"ladies nights\\" on Wednesdays with free goodie bags, cheap margaritas, and chair massages, etc. He's always very friendly and personable whenever I run into him, so I hope he manages to makes the place a success.

The place itself is small and humble, with only a few dining tables and a minimally decorated space. The walls are adorned with various newspaper clippings and photos with community leaders and celebrities who have visited over time.\\n\\nDespite its humble setting, quite a few Mercedes and Lexus cars were parked out front, and a few folks from the city could be identified eating inside. I wondered to my dining companion that afternoon if this was like Orlando's own version of Freddy's BBQ joint from the House of Cards, where Mr. Frank Underwood would go to scheme his political ascent over a plate of ribs.\\n\\nThe restaurant actually has quite the history as outlined in the Nikki's Place article by Orlando Sentinel's Heather Mcpherson. Although known as Nikki's Place since 1999, the restaurant was originally opened in 1949 and was known as Roser's Restaurant. The restaurant continues in the tradition of serving good Southern comfort food, simple and straightforward.\\n\\nCourses here for lunch come with two sides as well as a freshly baked cornbread muffin. Diners can choose from a list ranging from chitterlings to ox tails, fried chicken, smothered rib tips, pork neck bones, pig tails and pig ears, all the wonderful bits and pieces that make traditional Southern cuisine so delicious.\\n\\nMy dining companion ordered the Fried Tilapia with sweet rutabagas and collard greens ($8.25) while I ordered the Fried Pork Chop with mac and cheese and collard greens ($9.00).\\n\\nPortions are not outrageous as some other soul food places have known to be, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It was just the right amount to be full but not overstuffed, particularly the side portions.\\n\\nMy collard greens and mac and cheese were both very good while my pork chop was fried to a nice juicy crisp. I had actually wanted the smothered pork chop, and the staff were kind enough to bring a small cup of the gravy and onions to smother my pork chop in after inquiring.\\n\\nOverall, a very enjoyable lunch and will likely return to this neighborhood spot to try some of their sweet potato pie.\\n\\nOn Wednesdays, they have a $5.00 Wednesday plate special including Smothered Steak, Rib Tips, BBQ Riblets, Fried Wings, Turkey Necks, Beef Stew, And Meat Loaf.\\n\\nClosed Tuesdays."},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Coming from LA, the best way I can describe this restaurant is if this place was owned by 3 grandmas. \\n\\nYou have your Pilipino Grandma who loves to cook and eat.

From my perspective, why weren't we given a warning that we can't order food any more.\\nKindly a Chinese waiter recommended that we tried out the cotton candy in the front. Then we asked our waiter Denis again to teach us how to use the machine to make candy. It took him a long while until he finally gave us some sugar, but told us that we can try it out on our on. ( we asked for sugar three times)\\nWe tried and we failed. We came back to the table. Until we finally had Denis again to check out what's going on with that machine, he came to it and simply said (in not so patient manner) that we poured in too much sugar, it won't work any more. Well, we then apologized for not knowing how to use it properly, and asked for help to make it work. His answer was simply we messed it up. The only way to fix it is to wash the machine, and he won't do it until they close for the night. So the answer has no value to us as customers, as end result is that we dont get desert and we can't use the candy machine. My problem is that his attitude is just so wrong! Almost like as customers, we have to do our best to accommodate his work style in order to get what we want. \\n\\nIf only the service was better, I would recommend this place. No question that the food is excellent . But eating out is a holistic of experience, no parts of the experience should be compromised. \\n\\n\\n\\nUpdate: the store manager contacted me and offered his sincere apology and a chance to go back for a meal from him.

First of all, the guy didn't know what a double double was...????? Is that not the first line of training? I'm not blaming him for not knowing but someone needs to teach a kid these things before putting him on the early shift. Second, I'm on the way to work and realize that both the breakfast sandwiches had No turkey in the sandwich. Half my sandwich was missing. Where did it go? And same deal for my boyfriend. Third, we ordered yogurt parfaits and asked for two vanilla. We saw two vanillas and two strawberry. They told us that there were no vanillas left...I see the two vanillas!!! Okay fine, I'll settle for strawberry because I'm not going to get in a hissy at 6:30am (I will at 9:30 at night). Fourth, they didn't make this a combo. We were charged for each item individually. We had enough of the awkward at this point and I felt bad for the non-caffeinated bros behind us so I dropped it and just got myself out of there...I had to get to work and this was taking forever.

Luckily, I was completely wrong.\\n\\nSituated in the gravel lot between Blue Kangaroo Coffee and Tilde, ZenBu serves up a variety of Asian dishes.  My wife and I have already paid several visits, sampling widely from both the standard menu and their specials.  I can honestly say everything we have tried completely rocks.  On our first visit, my wife tried the special Spyder Burger ($8), a tempura fried soft shell crab on a roll with spicy garlic aioli, greens, tomatoes and avocado served with green salad and rice.  What arrived was absolutely delicious.  The crab was ilght and airy without the slightest bit of greasiness.  The roll looked like it came from Grand Central just down the street, not some crappy sesame seed grocery store rendition of a roll.  The aioli had just enough spice to complement the sandwich without overpowering it...definitely a winning dish.  I ordered the Ginger Chicken ($6), a chicken cutlet marinated in ginger then Panko crusted, pan-fried and served on a bed of cabbage with Teriyaki sauce and accompanied by rice and a green salad.  Once again, the food came out crispy and delicious without the slightest hint of grease.  On our subsequent visits we have sampled the Pork Katsu ($6), the Happy Cabbage ($6), and the Bento Box special ($9 for your choice of  Katsu along with rice, salad, 4 pc California Roll, Miso, and a drink).  WHile all have been phenomenal, the real standout is the Happy Cabbage.  Its a \\"feathered\\" chicken breast stewed in a broth of sweet coconut milk and sambal, served  over shredded cabbage and accompained by  rice and a green salad.  This one is absolutely crave-worthy.  The sweetness of the coconut milk and spiciness of the sambal are perfectly balanced so neither one dominates the dish.

We had reservations for 9PM so it would be after a lot of the new couples were out for the night.  The bar is a great place to hang out and meet up with everyone, all the other customers were really friendly and laid back.  BUT the bartenders, while they can make a good drink are painfully slow and really inattentive. Since everyone got there at different times and some didn't know each other or group was scattered across the bar and everyone had the same problem with the bartenders, extremely slow ad totally disinterested.  To the point that we had to leave an open tab to go sit down since the bartenders couldn't be bothered to come back and get paid despite many tries to settle up, had to have our waiter get the bar tab for us.  Since it was later in the evening, the bar was not busy enough to justify the delays.       \\n\\nWhen we were seated, which was a reasonable amount of time around our reservation, our waiter Sam, was great, friendly and helpful, especially when he had to tell us they were out of a few things we had ordered, it was the end of the night on a holiday, so that's okay.  But the bartender issue kept coming up, it took way too long to get a glass of wine, like an entire course, not some mixologist drink, but a glass of wine, and we had a view of the bar so we know it wasn't the waiter's fault. \\n\\nThe food was pretty good, can't recall any issues there, but that's the last time I'll go or we will have a group dinner there, which is a shame because it was becoming a traditional spot, and honestly, it's because of the bartender issue."},{"name":"Laughing Planet","address":"909 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is a pretty safe bet if you want something light to eat, are vegetarian/vegan, or have children with you.\\n\\nI was surprised the first time my wife and I went there at how inexpensive the menu was. When we got our food, I realized why. The wraps are cheap because they leave out a lot of the ingredients you'd normally expect to be included. After closer inspection of the menu, you can add these ingredients, but at a cost.  I guess I can see why they do this - they cater to some typcially particular eaters - vegetarians/vegans and children. At some point they must have decided it would just be easier to not include some of the more controversial ingredients and offer a \\"base model\\" you could soup up according to your tastes. It's pretty easy to eat something simple and lite (only a few ingredients) or build yourself something a little more complex.\\n\\nThe ceaser salad is really good and they have a pretty good roster of beers to choose from. \\n\\nParking is ample and the environment is very casual and family friendly.

Caviar bumps for days... betcha can't have just one! Or ten! We're not addicted, we're just having a good time. Whitefish pizza--it's an everything bagel crust. It's smoky. It's creamy. It's crispy.

More whitefish pizza.\\n\\nIf you need pasta, squid ink gemelli trumps bucatini. The char belly dinner plate is good, but the brunch char is better. The carbonara is forgettable, and the snails 'n' grits are unforgettably salty. Skip the clam pizza unless you're dying of sodium deficiency, and definitely don't get the pig's face pizza. It's rich without being cohesive, texture or flavor-wise.

My experience at La Cocina de Consuelo today is definitely in my top three for Mexican food, (Cervantes of Albuquerque, NM and  Tacos Tierra Caliente in Houston, TX). \\n\\nWhen my husband and I came in, we weren't sure what to do so we went up to what was seemingly the order counter - but a very nice gentleman, (who was our waiter for the afternoon) pointed us towards a table and asked us to bring menus with us. We chose a nice table along the wall - although their screened patio looked awesome. He came by right away and took our order for drinks and food. From there on out, our drinks, appetizer and food came out in fair succession and our waiter was attentive the entire time...very friendly too. \\n\\nWe ordered a variety of dishes - a chicken soft taco plate for myself with the Nopalito Salad and Mexican Rice, the special of the day for my husband which was the Chile Relleno Plate in chicken with Mexican rice and beans. He ordered a beef crisp taco to the side. We also ordered the Chile con Queso and two iced teas. Let's break this down, shall we?\\n\\nComplimentary chips and salsa: Pretty good. Homemade chips...spicy salsa with an elevator of heat... good. \\n\\nChile con Queso - Amazingly wonderful. Included queso with a generous dollop of excellent guacamole in the middle, chiles and green onions throughout the queso itself. Some of the best we've ever had. \\n\\nChicken Soft Tacos - Amazing. Totally in my top two or three tacos I've ever had. The tortillas were excellent and the meat was not only full of flavor and seasoned well, but tender. All toppings were very fresh as well and this made for a knockout of a taco. \\n\\nNopalito Salad & Mexican Rice: The salad was really interesting - full of pickled cactus strips, fresh tomatoes, cilantro and onions topped with cojita cheese... delightful! The rice was fairly good - definitely homemade. \\n\\nCrispy Beef Taco - I think my husband loved it. It was gone before I looked up from my plate....freshly fried up taco shell and he said the beef was  very well seasoned. \\n\\nChile Relleno - Probably the best he has ever had in this style. This was a non-fried huge poblano stuffed with the same moist chicken I had in my tacos, covered in cheese. He finished the entire thing!\\n\\nSo... I have a very strong feeling we're going to be coming back here soon - and we're going to be bringing friends.

Serving sizes aren't massive, which I see as a plus (I want to eat healthy portions, not vats, of healthy food!), but might not be quite large enough on their own for someone who's in post-workout starving mode. No problem: just add on a side or two from the dozen-plus deep list (things like sweet corn, brown rice, pintos, sweet potatoes, and on and on) in that case. Smoothies are another option; though I haven't tried one, these are the only kind I order: no ice, no sherberts, no frozen yogurt, nothing premade. Just fresh fruits and juices (with local berries when they're in season).\\n\\nThere is a parking lot at this location but it's usually full, so budget in some time for walking or looking for street parking if you're going out of your way to eat here.

Came late on a weekday night and while 2-3 tables had no people, they were still dirty.  Couldn't tell how long it had been that way but the two servers looked overworked and tired.  Nevertheless, I got my food reasonably expeditiously.   I noticed that a couple of guys came in about 20 mins before close and was told they were closed.  Honestly I just think the two servers were exhausted.  Service: 2 stars\\n\\nFood:  I read about the vegetarian options and how people were raving about them.  I decided to go with the traditional Vietnamese hot and sour soup with vermicelli, small size.  It came in a serving bowl with a heat source underneath it.  I'm not convinced this was anything more than for show.   It was ok, and not spicy on the least.  I had to add quite a bit of sambal olek hot sauce, but when I did, the soup was drastically better.   The soup had celery and some other vegetable that was more toothy.  There was fried tofu, tomatoes, and a ton of bean sprouts (probably too much).  In hindsight, I wish I ordered the veggie pho.  I left a little hungry, actually.  Perhaps an app would have completed the meal but that would make the meal particularly expensive for pho.

And the same goes for their cocktails and wine selection.\\n\\nWe started with the \\"Under the Sea\\" cocktail which I would highly recommend for anyone who is not a fan of sweet or fruity cocktails. The combination of nori tequila (which was very interesting) and grapefruit worked really well together. While enjoying this drink we ordered a dozen oysters that included a few of each they had for the night. We loved the larger oysters, and weren't the biggest fan of the smaller ones (I forget where they were from). \\n\\nFor dinner we ordered a bottle of Mencia - if you've never tried this wine before I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. It's a spicey, bold, dry wine from Spain that is incredibly hard to find in Boston. For food we ordered a simple pizza (w/o the anchovy) and the Octopus Polpetti. The food was excellent. \\n\\nThe reason I am not giving Waypoint 5 stars is due to the poor service we received. After ordering raw oysters, it took almost 25 minutes for them to come out and they were not that busy. Secondly, our waitress did not seem like she enjoyed her job or even wanted to be there.

The manager told me that the first batch is typically out at 10-11 am, but when I visited over the weekend, I was told they would not be ready until 1 pm! Undeterred, I finally snatched up a coffee cream cronut at 2:30 pm today, albeit the last one in the tray. Although my pastry endured a rough trip home on the T, it was still crispy and flaky and delicious; the custard filling had a hint of coffee liquor. I wouldn't go as far as to say that the cronut is better than a croissant, which is already an ideal pastry, but leaps and bounds superior to the humble donut.

It was essentially a large, deep fried filet sitting on top of a hamburger bun.  The best tortas in the entire area are served down the street in Medford Square so I was expecting something similar, it was so uninspiring with the hamburger bun, why not even try to make it more authentic?

As a cafe or wine bar, they're probably a 4* but as a restaurant I'd recommend for dinner, I'd have to give it a 3.\\n\\nThe domain on a Friday or Saturday evening is one of my favourite spots and we decided to check out this place as it reminded me a lot of a well-known chain in England called Cafe Rouge, although they are in no way related apparently. We got a table outside which was perfect as we could people watch but still got the atmosphere from inside the restaurant.\\n\\nTo begin with, we both ordered French Onion Soup which, for a French restaurant, was not that good. It's hard not to like anything involving melted cheese but it was just a bit bland and needed a lot of seasoning. This should be a signature dish if it was done well.\\n\\nI then had the Steak Frites and my wife had the Boeuf bourguignon. Both were pretty good, nothing I'd order again though if I'm honest. Again I'd expect these to be signature dishes for a French Restaurant. I did like the bearnaise sauce and the fries were good but the steak was a little tough and overcooked. My wife wasn't a huge fan of her meal which can best be described as forgettable.\\n\\nThe service here is great and I think if I came back it would be for a lighter lunch during the day when I could hopefully get a good french sandwich as that seems to be what they'd be good at rather than more complex dinner dishes."},{"name":"JoLa Cafe","address":"5915 SW Corbett Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great job on the lattes.

Not like dozing off or anything like that, but more like being a clutz. Like, there was this one time I asked them a certain dietary question about their donuts when it was my turn in line to make my order, and the employee behind the counter looked at me like I had asked them a bizarre question and instead ignored my question and made quick hand gestures in motions of \\"Get on with it and choose your donuts.\\" And there were other times where when I went up to the cash register to pay, they would never ask me anything else like if I wanted a drink or even ask if I had a rewards membership with them (I have missed out on a lot of freebies and rewards redemptions because of this). Enough of my complaints. There are some solutions to these problematic problems I experience in my visits. Number one would be to train all your employees to have a higher quality of customer terms interaction and communication. Number two would be to have a more competent manager in charge that can actually handle complex customer situations rather than ignoring them. Number three could be having more employees on deck? Because often times, it is always understaffed and everyone behind the counter always seems to be rushing to make orders. It all seems so inefficient in my eyes.

(The other benefit was the half-prize appetizers between 4 and 6. Yes!)\\n\\nOur waitress was accommodating to our party's ever-growing number and chaotic ordering style. I got a Scotch Ale, which was served in a snifter and was as dark and chocolatey as a stout (and almost too sweet, if you can believe it.)\\n\\nFor appetizers, we ordered the nachos, wings, and Buffalo tenders. The nachos were unusual in that the \\"toppings\\" were cooked separately from the chips and served in a bowl into which you could dip your chips. It's a good idea when you think about it, because it keeps the chips from getting soggy and ending up in a solid mass. (And no meat either; it's vegetarian. Hmmm. What if I want meat?) \\n\\nThe wings were pretty good, served in a big bucket, and thus ample. They had a good kick and decent sauce, but it was just a little sweet. Not bad sweet or cloying, but not what I expected from spicy wings.\\n\\nFor the main course, I had a blackend bleu burger, which was Cajun-spiced with crumbled blue cheese on top. Not bad. Nicely cooked to medium, which in my book means just a little pink.\\n\\nMy 17-month-old daughter had a pita pizza off the kid's menu. It was surprisingly good. That's probably the sauce. I don't know if they use pre-packaged pita pizzas bought from a wholesaler or make it themselves, but it was good nonetheless.\\n\\nOn Sunday nights, they have family nights. They bring out toy trains from the great toy store down the street and offer a children's buffet. It would be a nice break for parents who would like to go out but are afraid of annoying non-childbearing customers. As it was, they stored the train table in a corner by the bathrooms which was a convenient place for bringing my daughter when she got fussy.\\n\\nOverall, Watch City reminds me of the Boston Beer Works/Salem Beers Work restaurants, from the beers on tap to the decor to the menu. Not exactly the same, but enough for me to ask if they are related. They are not.\\n\\nThe web site leaves a lot to be desired.

We asked if there was any open seating and the lady gave us a little rose thing and told us to take the bridge into the restaurant. I was kind of surprised, when we got in there was a small line, maybe 15 people waiting to order, I realized we were just in the line to order and we basically got in with no issue. Total wait time was probably 7 min of us standing in the line and then ordering. We then went to the dinning room and found another dinning room to the right with nobody seated.

This place isn't bad. The ingredients are authentic, however it's missing flavor in the meat, there are definitely spices and other yummy flavors missing in the meat. I'd say another disappointment is that they add beans and rice to all the burritos. Yes, you can ask to not have them in, but that's standard here for some reason. This could just be Mexican food from another part of Mexico that isn't big on spice and extra limey goodness, and doesn't focus on the meat. The burritos are more about carbs and feeding you big portions, so I'd say save your cash and split the burrito. The tortas are almost there, again the meat still lacks that extra spice and savory flavor, but the bread and the rest are good. The salsa is really what helps to make the food better. It's really hard to find places with good salsa. The red actually has some type of spicy kick, and the green is that cool tangy verde that I'm looking for. The horchata is great, it's not all watered down or powdery tasting. Phew, thank goodness! I like that it's actually a Mexican feeling joint, not some ritzy, trendy, hipster, fusion feeling john, and it's not your white washed Chipotle place disguised as authentic Mexican food.

Other favorites of the evening: Fiore de Zucca - nice little bites to start the meal with, Capesante, Tagliolini, Manzo and Ippoglosso.  Since my date is allergic to shellfish, we each explored the Quattro Piatti and weren't disappointed by any of the dishes or wine pairings.

The crust was thin and crisp, but still was clearly a pizza crust. I can't stand crust that is so thin, it tastes like a cracker.

While not as well known as Voodoo Doughnuts, in my opinion: Blue Star Donuts is better.\\n\\nI went to Blue Star Donuts around 9:30 am and there was no line at all. There might not have been a line because this is not the main location, but that is no bother to me!\\n\\nThe atmosphere of the store was very modern and sleek. All the donuts that were available were on display on the counter.\\n\\nAfter looking for several minutes, my friend and I decided on three donuts:\\n\\nLemon Poppy, Maple Bacon, and Creme Br√ªl√©e.\\nThe Lemon Poppy was in my opinion the best donut I had. It was a nice cake-styled donut (thick cake-like dough) with a refreshing taste of lemon. The poppy seeds added a nice texture to the donut and it was both fun to eat and tasty!\\nThe Maple Bacon was also really great. I liked the Maple Bacon more at Blue Star Donut because not only was the bacon warm, it was already in bite sized pieces making it easy to eat. I don't think I got a good mix of salt and sweet with this donut but it was definitely good.\\nThe Creme Br√ªl√©e was unique to say the least. The donut itself was very good, the candy shell of the donut was very delicious and made the the donut unique. The custard inside the donut was generic but still went well with the over all theme. The most unique part was the syringe of orange liquor that comes with the donut. To me personally, I enjoyed the orange liquor with the donut at some parts, but at other times, it was not something that made the donut better.\\n\\nOverall I would recommend Blue Star Donuts! There aren't as many unique flavors at Blue Star than at Voodoos, but the quality is so much better. The donuts here are much pricier than Voodoo's, but for the quality and uniqueness, it is definitely worth it."},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great whiskey selection!

We ordered Har Gow, the prawns were tender and juicy.  Siu Mai which was also piping hot and extremely tasty. Prawn and Chive dumping (yum!), Scallop and Prawn dumpling which I did not try but my mom said it was delicious and happily had my serving.  We also had the pan friend pork buns, which were well seasoned and tasty. The green bean garlic and chili and the chicken satay which was our least favourite.  The peanut sauce was to die for but the chicken was a bit dry.  \\n\\nOverall, they continually made sure we had water and tea (which is a cost of .25c per person, something I was a bit surprised about.

I read the reviews and was hesitant to go but we said we'll go ahead and try it. First, we had reservations at 715pm. We were sat down immediately which was nice. Went up to the salad bar/ \\"hot\\" bar areas and were DEEPLY disappointed. I wasn't able to find anything that I wanted to even have on my plate but settled for some rice. Everyone looked around at the food then to each other and were about to walk out to go to Fogo instead. The hot bar only had rice, beans, and something that looked like really thin fries. All while I'm standing there trying to find out what I wanted to eat, I can see the employees frantically taking meat out of the fridge to start cooking. Now, at this time it's already 7:30ish and they're just starting to cook the meat. The server is slow getting us drinks and refills (my sister didn't get a water refill until the end of our meal and she had repeatedly asked for it earlier). Another lady brings us out some garlic bread and cheese bread but why is she passing them out individually? Put some bread in a basket and leave it on the table because that's the only thing we can eat since they STILL haven't brought any meat out yet. Her excuse was that they were still cooking it. (I HAD RESERVATIONS AT 715 so you KNEW ahead of time that we were coming!!) They start asking how we want out meat cooked and at this point, any way that it is cooked will be fine with us because we've been eating salads, rice, and bread for the last 30 or so minutes. I've been to several brazilian steakhouses in the area and this was by far the worst experience I've had. On top of that....... Everytime they brought the meat out, they would have 1 ribeye/ ny strip for the whole table of 10. There was nothing on the skewer that many times, only 2 or 3 people even got to taste the meat. I didn't have a groupon so we paid full price. I should've gone with my gutt feeling and went to fogo instead. If I'm going to pay 30 dollars a person, I better be getting some decent service and food. Now it's time to pay..... I guess we're supposed to go up to the stand to pay? We went up there and the poor girl didnt know how to split the bill up individually so we had her combine it after standing up there looking at her for about 5 minutes.. Then I said forget it, just put it all on one and we'll split it ourselves. She gave us one tab and THEN she couldn't figure out how to split the payments. We paid cash and 2 cards. What is so hard to understand or do people? My mom's birthday was supposed to be nice and it was just an absolute waste of money.

The flavors were all pretty good with my favorites being the coconut and Dole pineapple.  It pains me to say it since I love YoCream so much, but I actually think PW's flavors seem to be more fresh and less artificially flavored.

I've been coming here since 1995, longer than most of the staff have worked there, lol. It's my favorite place in Columbus. I'm there at least once a week.  The best beer. The best food. Great staff, and great customers. I've been there through their ups and downs and they always remain consistently good. My go to is the chicken nachos. Have you ever had a mouth orgasm? I never have until these. Homemade everything. No cheese sauce to make the chips soggy. Fresh ingredients. Crispy chips. I would suggest sharing because they are massive. Their sauerkraut balls are misleading because they don't have a strong sauerkraut flavor. They are mild with a mix of sausage, cheese, and breading with a homemade ranch to dip in. I know vegetarians that will eat them and ignore that there's sausage present. I have another friend who avoids sauerkraut at all costs and he'll eat an entire order by himself. Just try them. You won't regret it. The Turkey Nut Burger is another favorite. It sounds weird to have a turkey burger topped with pecans but trust me, it's awesome. The spicy mayo they serve on the side works great on the burger and also as a dipping sauce for their awesome fries. Their wings are some of the best. They are grilled instead of fried. I recommend the medium with a side of Gates Of Hell (don't let the name fool you, it's not that hot. It's a flavorful spice with a tinge of heat). I've had almost the entire menu and it's excellent.  Beer-wise I would recommend my favs but that's such an individual choice it wouldn't make a difference to a reader. Besides, the staff can describe it better than I can.

This is how we found Brick and Fire, which is located a few blocks from the Orlando Amtrak station. The place is a real gem, and worth going out of your way for. We liked everything we had, but a few items are worth special mention. The Brick and Fire Greek Pizza was a riot of taste, texture, and aroma. And the baked ziti was exactly the hearty comfort food that you expect and hope for when ordering this kind of reliable standby. But two genuinely extraordinary dishes were the goat cheese bruschetta (it literally dissolved on the palate), and the linguini chicken alfredo (which made my daughter -- who is a self-appointed connoisseur of alfredo sauce -- rave that it was better than anything she could remember tasting in Manhattan). In this dish, the fresh chicken, expertly grilled, was also rich with flavor. All of the above (plus the low-key, welcoming atmosphere) make Brick and Fire worth going out of your way for. And Mark, the owner, who graciously takes time to chat while he is preparing all the food himself, is an intriguing character in his own right: wise in the ways of restaurants and a font of local history and lore.

This will set you back $18.95 and is enough food to feed us both. The meat has always been consistent, with good flavor and coloring.  Frankly, better than Buster's.  The mac & cheese is pretty generic but palatable.  The salad has always been fresh. Cornbread pieces are very small but sweet enough to make a satisfying desert. If I was only rating the meat I would give it 4 stars.  \\n\\nThe restaurant space itself feels like the strip mall it is which is probably why we've never chose the dine in option. If it was a bit more like Clay's Smokehouse we'd do so in a heartbeat. They have a sign at the counter which warns that \\"to go\\" orders can take an additional 15 minutes but that has never been the case when we ordered.  My best guess is our longest wait timed out at 5 minutes.  The service has always been consistently friendly. \\n\\nOverall, I think the meats compare favorably with the best places in PDX.

The rundown:\\n\\nThe place: VN is a little south of Worthington proper, a little north of Beechwold/Clintonville on High St. There's a decent amount of parking in the restaurant's lot, but it's almost always full anytime around dinner time. Inside you'll be forced to make a quick decision: LEFT to the restaurant, RIGHT to the bar. Maybe for most this is a rather easy decision, but I often find myself unconsciously wandering towards beer taps, so I had to stop and think about which way I should go. \\n\\nSO the restaurant is very warm and COZY (as Italian restaurants are prone to be). The light's a bit low, the walls are covered in this-and-that (mostly copper teapots of some sort). There is a decent amount of seating - off the top of my head I'd estimate 20 tables or so. The bathrooms are clean - no complaints there. \\n\\nThe bar is small-but-not-tiny. It's cozy as well, which is really appealing on a rainy night (as was the case last time I ventured up High St.).\\n\\nThe Service:\\nWe were served promptly, competently and efficiently. Our waiter was knowledgeable and personable - a very nice guy. \\n\\nThe Food:\\nIn a word: DELISH. I had the chicken parm. with a side of spaghetti. My meal also game with garlic bread and a salad. Everything was great. My girlfriend had the seafood pasta (with scallops and shrimp), and she loved it. We shared tiramisu for dessert, and it was delicious as well.  \\n\\nThe Drinks:\\nI got a tall Bud Light. (AND NOW WE STOP: turns out the tall beers at VN are ONE LITER mugs - SCORE!). The liter mug was $4.00. Entirely reasonable in my book. My gf got a couple dirty martinis, and she liked them (she's super picky when it comes to martinis too, so there). They were around $5 a piece, if I remember correctly.  \\n\\nThe price:\\nDinner for two with dessert and drinks was around $50. Granted, our drinks accounted for about $20 of that. Thus, I imagine you can get dinner for two for around $30 if you get soft drinks or water with your meals. \\n\\nOverall:\\nSince moving to Columbus a few months back, Villa Nova has become one of my go-to-restaurants. It's not a fancy place, but the food is great, the atmosphere is super comfortable and laid-back, the staff is great, the beers are huge (and COLD (they recently won Alive! magazine's award for \\"coldest beer in columbus.\\")) \\n\\nIn sum: VN is always a good dinner pick.

We showed our Scoutmob coupon (which is the kiss of death in some places - NOT HERE).  We were welcomed in and were seated on the outer perimeter of the salad bar.  We ordered a bottle of wine which was well priced and really went very nicely with our dinner (Canyon Creek, Pinot noir, if you're curious) which was served promptly and with a smile.  The salad bar is NOT like a Sweet Tomatoes salad bar, but why should it be?  If I want a huge salad bar, I will go to Sweet Tomatoes, but I wanted steak.  Everything on the salad bar is fresh, homemade and tended to every few minutes by all of the staff.  I didn't go for anything from the hot bar since I cannot eat big quantities, but my hub had some of the soup and liked it very well.  The server had asked us how we liked our meat (rare/med. rare) and all meat was brought at *precicely* the correct temperature.  We have eaten at several of the other name brand Brazilian steakhouses and they seem frustrated that you won't just take the meat the way that it's brought to you; this is not the case at Red Green.  Another of the wonderful things about this restaurant compared to others of the same type is that you are not sitting so close to other tables that you feel as though you might as well be in their laps AND they don't hustle you through your meal just to turn tables as many times as possible.  At one point we asked for the beef rib and the server told us that he would go back and cook one for us so that it would be just the way that we wanted it.  Yes, it took a few minutes, but he cooked it especially for us and it was heaven on a plate!  The garlic beef, tenderloin, chicken hearts (yes, I got them and loved them - if the thought makes you queasy, just don't ask for them!), beef rib, top sirloin and the rest were wonderful.  Another bonus is that the meal was not salty as can be a problem at the other places ( yes, I am looking at you again Fogo).  In short, we came in because of Scoutmob, but we will be back, and bringing friends, because of the great food and OUTSTANDING service.  Prissy snobs should stick to Fogo in Buckhead, people who love great food and fantastic service should take a trip OTP and go to Red and Green.\\n\\nOh yeah, the normal price of Red and Green for dinner is $34.95, Fogo is over $50.

We arrived (two people) around 8:30PM sans reservations and were warmly greeted and seated immediately at what seemed like the last available table in the place.  \\n\\nSummary:\\nTastefully decorated but noisy dining room.  Salem needs a place like this!  No hard alcohol (April?).  Nice bar area.  Service was great and well organized.  Tastes menu concept  is great.  Food has room for improvement..  Dishes were too busy and flavor combinations weren't well executed.  For those prices, I expected a LOT more.  I won't go back 'till they've made some improvements to menu and serve booze.\\n\\nDecor:\\nFirst thing that struck me was the interior design, which was tasteful, comfortable modern.  Warm colors, dark woods, and good lighting.  It certainly was a breath of fresh air in Salem decor-wise.  Only downfall are the acoustics in the dining room.  There was a woman sitting in a corner across the dining room...I could hear every word she said.  (There wasn't enough food in the place to shove in her yap hole to shut her up.)  Noise level is high for a 'fine-dining' restaurant....wasn't conducive to comfortable conversation.\\n\\nService:\\nService was great!  For a place that just opened, you'd never know it.  Often places seem a bit disorganized...this was NOT the case.  Staff was friendly and accommodating, yet not intrusive.\\n\\nDrinks:\\nThey opened on a seasonal liquor license...I think they can serve hard alcohol starting 4/1.  Only beer, wine, and cordials....so alas...NO MARTINIS.  The bar area will be THE martini bar in Salem once they get the booze flowing I suspect.\\n\\nFood:\\nI like the 'tastes' part of the menu.  Each item is only $5.  These are more like tapas sized dishes and are perfect with drinks.  I had the mussel salad which was quite tasty.  The starters section ($8-15) only has two salads...everything else was meat.  My dining partner had the Green Salad which was oily and pancetta didn't really work.  Main Courses ($19-25) overly creative and could have been better executed.  I felt main courses were too busy.  My table ordered the Duck and Chicken.  Chicken was oily and served with a piece wilty lettuce on the bottom, pecans and currants didn't seem to belong in the dish.  Duck was ok.  Pasta was delicious and nicely cooked.  Meat was tender but was very 'stewed' tasting.  Cherries were way over cooked.  Wasn't particularly appealing on plate as there was a pool of mystery brown sauce throughout.  Too many ingredients again.  We didn't stay for dessert, which didn't appear to be anything out of the ordinary."},{"name":"Buffet Palace","address":"12570 SW Center St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2.5","text":"I would give it a zero review if I could.\\nIt was Tuesday night and around 6 pm. Oddly it was kinda empty. Only a very few patrons which was odd for that time of day.\\nUpon getting my plate I saw that a lot of the food was gone. What was there was piled into the center. This couldn't be based on the patron amount in the restaurant. I should have used my better instinct and left. But, I didn't. We were hungry and wanted to get dinner. I found that all the food ALL was cold. This led me to believe that this was probably the leftover lunch food. This is a health hazard to have food sitting out so long. Why would everything be cold. Every option I chose was cold. Not warm but COLD. \\nI called over the waiter. He seemed not to understand what I was saying. Stared at me. I asked to speak to the manager. His explanation was the manager said it was the air conditioner and would be fixed tomorrow. Really? We left all our food that we had tasted on the table, since eating would present a risk based on not knowing how long it all sat out. Seafood sitting out - NOT A GOOD THING.  I told the manager when I was paying that the food was ALL cold. He looked at me like he also didn't understand. Surely he understood and knew exactly what I was saying. All he could offer was how much we had to pay. I didn't want any discount (and none was offered). I told him we couldn't eat cold food and that that was a health hazard. He stared at me blankly like he couldn't care less. No explanation was offered. What kind of food establishment conducts business this way. They have no concern for their customers to allow them to eat leftover lunch food that was all cold. And then not give an explanation as to why or to even say sorry how can we make it better. Nothing. My last time there. And I would like everyone to know that if you disregard these comments all I can say is before you fill your plate be sure that the dishes are full and heat seems to be coming from the dishes.

What I was disappointed was how they treated my baby. I told them my baby needs to be in this car seat or stroller. My baby is not old enough to be in a booster. The hostess said okay. Came back and asked if he could go in this ... I looked at it, it was a booster that attaches to the table. I said no cus he can't hold up his neck so he can't sit up. She said okay. She showed me a bunch of tables which I was fine with. But suggested the car seat to sit on their high stools with no backing or we can go to the lower tables and the car seat can be on the floor. I told them I could either put the car seat on the booth or on a chair on a lower table that has a backing. She said other ppl have put their car seat on the floor. I don't know what kind of parent would put the car seat on the floor. All u need is for someone to spill or drop and utensil on your baby. I simply said no. While all this was happening, they had a booth for 6-7 ppl. During the whole time we were at the restaurant (waiting and leaving) they didn't sit anyone there. Not even a family of four. In my opinion, being there for 1.5 hours, they could have sat two groups by the time we left.\\nWhen we got seated and waited for our food to come out, the hostess was cleaning the table next to us and dropped the bottle of cleaning table solution on the floor. So basically depending on which side I put my baby on the floor the solution couldn't have got on him. I ordered the bun no hue. It's not that authentic but I guess they have good portions. But I would rather go to another restaurant that had more authentic bun bo hue for cheaper. My husband had the pho. We thought the same as the bun bo hue. We also ordered their spring rolls and butter garlic chicken wings. Their spring rolls were really good. The butter garlic chicken wings was over priced as well. I guess they are trying to copy Phnom Penh's chicken wings but Phnom Penh's chicken wings are the bomb and they give u a lot more for the same price. So overall I really liked their spring rolls. They should make their restaurant more kid friendly. I have been to a lot of viet restaurants and they are all kid friendly. It's vancouver. Even high end restaurants are more friendly than theirs."},{"name":"BRU Burger Bar-Westerville","address":"691 North Cleveland Ave","city":"Westerville","stars":"4","text":"So glad Bru Burger opened up just as we moved to Westerville!!!

We arrived right around 5:45, and the place was setting up for what looked like a work event (few tables and a merchandise area), and had a few people sitting at the bar.\\nThe staff are both servers and bartenders, so we had several of the girls come to ask for drinks and food - didn't quite know who we were tipping at the end? They were all friendly, but couldn't quite get their timing right. We sat with empty drinks for a while, and then one would come over and ask if we wanted another round, and then someone else would come ask us if we wanted another round. One server per section would probably have worked better for them - but at least they were all very friendly and nice. \\nThe beer was good - I'm not really one for breweries, but I ordered the lightest one they had and it was ok. Still too heavy for me, but my mother and brother both enjoyed their beers.\\nNow for the food...\\nIt was not great. I had a pretty good idea going in based on the other reviews that the food was mediocre, but oh man, it was sub-par at best. We ordered the nachos, a buffalo chicken pizza, and a steak and cheese sandwich with tater-tots. (I should also mention, that when we left this place around 7:15, it was PACKED and we were still the only people in there who ordered food...) Everything was fine, but nothing I would order again. I'm sure if you're there and you're several beers in, food is food. People were not there to eat, and I wouldn't eat there again. A brewery having such a vast menu should have been a hint - they should just pick 5 or 6 things and do those things well, rather than having so many different options, and doing them ok.\\nSo, if you're into breweries, this place would be for you! But go with a full stomach!"},{"name":"Bob Evans","address":"1380 N Hamilton Rd","city":"Gahanna","stars":"2.5","text":"\\"Welcome to Bob Evans\\", a reasonable start to a midweek meal at a Midwest eatery known for serving comfort food with moderate efficiency. At least that's my expectation.\\nAlthough alone, I was shown quickly to a booth by the greeter, as I had requested. The restaurant was perhaps only twenty percent full, and I was immediately greeted by a friendly, perky waitress named Lindsey. She handed me a menu, pointed out the specials, and took my drink order (just water, but they do have a nice selection to choose from). Being in the mood for a burger, I quickly decided on the \\"Big Farm Cheeseburger\\". Although it comes with French fries and cole slaw, you can substitute most sides without an upcharge. In the mood for a salad, I swapped it for the slaw. My server said they were \\"prepping new salad in the back, and it might be a couple of minutes\\". I told her that would be fine.\\nStill saladless ten minutes later, Lindsey apologized for the delay and offered up something to tide me over, such as some soup or other item. I declined, as I figured it couldn't take much longer. I also asked that my burger be timed appropriately following the arrival of my salad. I could sense the frustration in my server's voice, as she said she had three other people also awaiting salads, and I overheard the table next to mine order salads, too.\\nFifteen minutes later, I watched as Lindsey rushed out of the back, salad bowls finally in hand. I watched as she picked up a burger and fries that had been sitting on the counter and brought them out with my salad. She apologized profusely for the delay. My salad consisted of chopped lettuce, a few grape tomatoes and some croutons. The last two items I saw my server add, so the delay of more than twenty-five minutes was for the prep cooks to chop lettuce, or to open a bag of salad. Incredibly disappointing, and certainly not in the \\"Bob Evans Tradition\\" they speak so highly of. The \\"Colonial Dressing\\" (really just poppy seed dressing), was slopped over the serving cup edges in the haste to get these out. Not having time to wait for another burger and fries (already lukewarm), I hurried through my salad. The fries were indeed cold, and thus pretty unappealing.  I will say the burger, although barely warm, was very good. It was a reasonably sized patty, well-seasoned, and although well-done (you seem to get them only as they make them), very tasty. The bun was soft on the inside with a slightly chewy crust. The lettuce, tomato, pickles and onion were fresh, and in just the right proportions.\\nOne thing I did notice, the manager, highly visible, dropped by every table asking on the meal. Well, almost every table. His stops didn't seem to include those that had waited almost half an hour for a salad. Perhaps he didn't want to hear our thoughts, or to offer up a \\"nicety\\" in return for the horrible delay. I paid my tab, left a nice tip (not her fault and I could tell this was embarrassing for her), and left.\\nThe total, with tip, was $12.00. Would I go back? No, not to this Bob Evans anyway. If it is so poorly run that the manager can't get a head, or bag, of lettuce out in twenty plus minutes and has no apparent interest in me, then I have no interest in them. For half that price I can get a Big Mac, large fries and a side salad two blocks down at McDonald's. Of course I will have to bring it to the table myself, but for $6.00, I will be glad to do just that.\\nGood Heavens, Bob Evans.

The Decour is pitch perfect with the movie itself, and it really makes you feel like you're eating at the beast's castle - enchanted rose and all. I think it's a lovely place to see, and to experience at least once.

You order at the front (but don't pay there) and they bring it out. We each ordered different burgers and a black and white milkshake. While waiting, we saw lots of tables with onion rings so we added those on. Burgers were good and cooked how we ordered, which doesn't happen often when my husband orders medium rare. Milkshake was a typical milkshake, nothing special and overpriced like everything else in the airport. Onions rings were thin and crispy. We're condiment people so we liked all the sauce options at the table , one of which was just called \\"burger sauce\\". \\n\\nMy main complaint, and it didn't affect us but seems bad for business, is that you order at the front but don't pay there. So then your food comes and your waiter brings the check and you pay at some point while eating. Our waiter came as soon as we picked a seat before our food came with the bill, but that's when we added on our onion rings. So then our food came and we ate and waited no corrected bill ever came. We finally flagged someone down to pay. This method seems weird and I don't get why you don't pay at the front where you order, but given that it's an unusual process and most people are eating on a time crunch between flights, I bet a lot of people dine and dash. In fact, a worker chased down a couple who attempted just that while we were there because they had ordered takeout and the food bags were given to them before a waiter approached them with any sort of bill. They got caught, but I have a feeling quite a few dishonest people probably get a free meal from here daily."},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Pros: Excellent waiter, good salad, and yummy potatoes. \\n \\nCons: Not enough selection on the dinner menu, extremely noisy which made it hard to keep a conversation, the bread was awful, and according to the waiter you might want to order an appetizer because it could take a while for your food to come out. \\n\\nThat would have been great as the green salad was really good, yet if the food is going to take some time to cook shouldn't it at least be warm?

In short, the dumpling skin is just much too thick. It really bothers me, because it's a classic dish, and when executed well, the skin of this dumpling is supposed to be so thin that it barely contains the soup inside. They're not potstickers - good xiao long bao requires a very delicate chopsticks technique in order to pick it up without puncturing the skin and letting all the delicious juices dribble out.

We opted to each try an Original taco (eggs, potatoes, cheese) - one topped with avocado the other with bacon - and a Veggie taco. \\n\\nA few things to note:\\n-one taco actually consists of two tortillas overlapped, making one 'large' breakfast taco. But this also makes them hard to pick up and eat easily\\n-the cheese is pretty heavy, which might be normal for New Mexico cuisine. I wish I'd known and asked for light cheese as it was hard to taste anything else\\n-salsas are not spicy. I assumed they'd be. Still the green salsa was flavor packed\\n-I'm a true lover of corn tortillas and opted to try one of my tacos with corn and the other with flour. Definitely get the flour! So much better.

Just me? Okay, moving on. I recently had to find a new coffeeshop which is sad because I love/d my old coffeeshop but, in reality it's just too far away from GSU which is where I have to drop off my sister every day. After dropping her off, I needed to find somewhere close by to kill about 3-4hrs until her classes are done for the day. I visited about 4-5 coffee shops before finally settling on GPCH which I think may have just become my new hang out/work spot. \\n\\nLocated right across from the Zoo in the historic Grant Park District, the shop is very quaint but seems to cater to a very diverse crowd. And the best part? Parking has NOT been a problem so far! You can park on the street, in a mini-lot next to the shop (it can probably hold 3-4 cars), or, I bet, if you really needed to, you could even park at the zoo since parking there is free. But please don't take my word for that I have no idea if that's allowed or not. :)\\n\\nAnyway, the ambiance/vibe of shop itself is a refreshing change from the ultra-hippy, overcrowded, unnecessarily fancy coffeeshops that are the norm these days. GPCH is just very chill, laid back and easy going, which I love. It reminds me of a simple local deli--no muss, no fuss, no pretense. There are about 3-4 ladies who greet you when you walk in and ask what you'll have. Their menu is pretty standard--again, no bells and whistles but there's a very good variety of items to choose from. There are sandwiches of course: tuna, chicken salad, turkey etc;  and your baked goods: a variety of sweet \\"breads\\" like banana bread, zucchini bread, blueberry lemon loaf etc. Of course there are muffins, cupcakes, cookies and scones that I assume are baked daily. The coffee drinks are also your standard drinks but they're well made--I'm sipping on a caramel iced latte as I type this and it's delicious! They also serve smoothies and iced-cold fresh squeezed juices. I tried the orange juice and it was Heaven on a hot, summer morning! They also serve hand-scooped ice-cream further adding to the local deli/lunch-spot feel. \\n\\nI must admit though, I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and wasn't too fond of it. First of all, the sandwich was almost $8 which I think is a bit steep for any kind of sandwich--and this was without a combination drink and chips! For $8, I expected for the sandwich to be stellar, it unfortunately wasn't. It was HUGE, which helped to make up for the price, but it had way too many large pieces of pecans in it ( I like pecans but less is more people) and it had a ranch dressing-esque flavor which I was not a fan of. However, despite not liking the sandwich, the banana bread I ordered was VERY good. It wasn't too sweet, it was very moist and even though I don't like walnuts, I ate the bread anyway and it was well worth it. \\n\\nThe shop is split into two areas: the area where you order and pay for your food--which also has a few places to sit (although it's a bit cramped) and a much larger room that is reserved solely for guests to sit, eat and work. There is also outside seating which is lovely once the sun goes down a bit. The inside seating area is spacious, comfortable and they play awesome Reggae/West-indian music which, I've never heard in a coffee shop but it appeals to my West Indian self, I love it! \\n\\nBesides the fact that I think the prices are a little steep, (which I think is just the norm for modern coffeeshops), I like this place a lot and I think it may just be my new spot for a while. If you see me, come say \\"hey!\\""},{"name":"Bundy's Bagels","address":"1421 SE 33rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Truly amazing bagels crafted by a true Portland original!

I had the chicken pot pie while my BF got the lamb--the potpie was perfect for the cold, rainy day, if a tad bit burnt on the crust, and while the lamb wasn't out-of-this-world, it was damn good.

Everything was great, but it was $9 for (maybe) an ounce of meat...that's over $100 a pound when you do the math...this makes the salumi, ounce for ounce, more expensive than any restaurant I have ever been to, including NYC, LA and Vegas. \\n\\nHighlights of the meal included the tortellini (peas and horseradish) which were amazing...but you only get four little pieces...the coppa on frisee was fantastic, as well...deep fried pork goodness.\\n\\nMy dates halibut entree was good, but bland, though I was eating pork belly for mine, so perhaps it is a relative thing. She quite enjoyed it, though. She had some tuna tartare for her salad, which was also good, surprisingly so for being 1200 miles form the nearest ocean.\\n\\nNot a bad bite of food to be had, although some bites were better than others. However, dinner for two was $265 with one cocktail and 4 glasses of wine. Expensive for two people, no matter how you slice it, and I walked away hungry.  \\n\\nService at the bar was very good, but the hostess was frigid and not very polite.\\n\\nI'm leaving this at 3 stars, would be 4-star except for the cheated feeling I have."},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"I will never give Zyka a penny more. Over the past 2 years, we have ordered takeout from Zyka and paid for the full order, and got it home with at least one item missing.

We swore we weren't going to do it again, but we got into town after a road trip and decided to order Zyka for pickup.

The house brews come in any style from lagers to darker stouts, and they're all incredibly tasty. The IPA was a pleasant surprise for me, as it had an almost sweet tinge to it compared to most of the more bitter-tasting IPAs I've had in the past like Stone and Arrogant Bastard.

I saw a chef take a plate that was complete and about to be delivered to a patron, and he removed a piece of lettuce and eat it. I was shocked, until he did it AGAIN from the same plate. Then the waiter came and took it to the person who was then to eat it.\\n\\nI sat for a moment wondering if I should tell the manager. To me that was just inappropriate. I talked with some of my group and they convinced me to tell the manager. So I pulled the manager aside and told her what I had seen. Her response shocked me. She said that he was the chef and that to ensure consistent taste in their food it was normal for him to just pull samples from the plates that were going out to their guests. \\n\\nwow.\\n\\nNext up, the main course. I had the chicken ($21 for half a chicken, nothing with it!). Far too salty, and I thought I was alone until I shared some with my partner who was dining with us.

While eating the manager came over to our table and looked directly at me, and said \\"I wanted to check to see if everything was ok with YOUR food sir!\\".

Definitely get one or 2 at most. I was eyeing the Scallops & Shrimp puff pastry on the menu, but I ended up getting pork. And good thing I did. The Coq Au Vin braised pork was so juicy and tender! A must! My friends enjoyed their herb-crusted lamb. It was too raw for me though. French onion soup was spot on. And finally, Lumiere's The GREY STUFF. We first saw it in the fancy, encased dessert cart. Honestly, it tasted like good 'ol whip cream to me, but creamier and fluffier with a hint of oreo. It had a much nicer texture though. Tried it by itself & atop a brownie. They all tasted delicious!  \\n\\nOverall, this eatery was pricey, but I'd say it's worth every penny.

My reservations were at 6:45 and was seated right away after speaking with the hostess. My friend and I got our own little table, and it was upstairs on the 2nd floor. I believe the first floor was the bar? It was just the right amount of space with the next table over, but I guess a little more would have been nice, I was scared I was going to knock into their table when I was trying to go in, even though I'm really thin. I came first, and my server came and pour me my water, the hostess also got me a drink menu, I ordered a mango mojito. It came pretty quick, and was really good! I would have loved it to be stronger, but whatever, maybe the other place I had it, just makes drinks exceptionally strong. He also brought out the bread, which is quite hard...but i ate it anyways, while waiting.\\n\\nWhen he came back to check on me, (he often did throughout the entire meal) I asked for the RW menu. He was really nice and promptly got it for me. Once my friend got here we started ordering.\\n\\nWe both got the New England Clam Chowder. It tasted a bit salty, but was very flavorful even though it was in a little bowl, but I actually liked it alot. (They brought out the entrees before we were done with the chowder-- too fast!)\\n\\nI then got the Chart House Prime Rib- medium rare; absolutely mouthwatering. I've had my fair share of steak that I have to spend forever chewing, but this literally melts in my mouth after chewing for a couple of seconds. It was so tender, and there were two sauces it came with. Just thinking about it now makes me crave it!!! The mash potato that came with it was probably the best mashed potato i've ever had, lots of flavor---aka butter? I hate mashed potatoes! So that's saying something!!! \\n\\nShe had the Herb Crusted Salmon--so fresh! So good! Cooked to perfection; not too dry or anything! Though she thought it was a bit salty, again. This came with mashed potatoes as well.\\n\\nEverything was perfect temperature!\\n\\nFor dessert we got the Boston Cream Pie and the Mud Pie. The boston cream pie was really good, it was a slice of cake really, but there was lots of cream and the cake had the perfect moisture content. The pie also came as a slice...of coffee ice cream with a oreo cookie crust! If you like coffee ice cream, this if for you!! The ice cream was crazy cold!\\n\\nI really liked my server, he always checked up, but there was a point at the end when my water glass was almost empty and he almost failed to notice, but good thing he did. I was so busy with my mojito I guess he didn't realize my water glass was becoming empty. He did offer to get me another mojito when he saw that it was almost finished. I think a manager/supervisor came by mid-meal to check up to see if everything was good, so that was good. \\n\\nSo things that were off: i didn't have a plate for my bread...and my friend's water glass was cracked, but we told the server after, when we realized.\\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised that Chart House had such good food! The atmosphere was great! It wasn't silent, but lively. Did not expect that at all. I love that it's by the water..though I can't see the water besides all those boats.

Located right on Broadway, very close to Arbutus, you cannot miss the tacky sign. I did not realize that this was an AYCE restaurant, so my review is only based on ordering two boxsets, but the price of the AYCE was alright, and they have a mid-day special between 4-6.\\n\\nThe decor is pretty bland in here, nothing too Japanese, simple table and chairs, and some booths. The food on the menu is fairly inexpensive, as each boxset we had, consisting of one beef rib, and the other a chicken terriyaki, were each under $10, and had a heap load of food. The one thing that stood out for me here is that they served the salad first, seperate from the box. Most places but the salad in one corner of the boxset. The portions were definitely enough for me and my mom, to the point we had to take most of it home (I may be a foodie, but I do not have a big stomach!). They also gave a seperate bowl for the rice. The portions of sushi and tempura were, on my scale, large.\\n\\nIf you need a quick eat, around this neighbourhood, and have a craving for cheap Japanese food, this place is alright.

As we were finishing our drinks, she came back in within a few minutes and said that she was sorry, but our table was not ready after all and should would let us know. At 7:30, we were all finally hungry and starting to get a little annoyed honestly, and went to the hostess desk. She went up the stairs, took about five minutes more for her to come back down and tell us a table was ready. Here's where I should tell you that it was a Sunday evening and the restaurant wasn't even half full.\\n\\nOur kind waiter was Andrew. We ordered another round of Cosmos which arrived half full. Everyone of them. Disappointing. Our guess is that they were spilled coming upstairs from the bar because we received a full martini glass when we were sitting in the bar.\\n\\nWe placed our orders for dinner only, no appetizers. 3 dinners arrived first. About 3-4 minutes later, the 4th arrived. Ours were getting cold as we were trying to be polite and wait. The only one now without a dinner was the retirement girl. Awkward. A gentleman came out from the kitchen (appeared to be the head chef) and apologized for her meal being late and said it would be just another minute. It took at least 10 full minutes for her meal to arrive. Most of us were already done eating.\\n\\nAndrew was very apologetic and said that we would be comped three desserts. One of the sisters objected and said there's five of us here for dinner. He said he was sure that would be fine. We ended up ordering four desserts that were comped, and they also took off $10 for the 10 minutes it took for Jane's meal to arrive.\\n\\nOddly enough, when our desserts arrived, again, Janes didn't arrive. We were almost completely done with our desserts when her mud pie finally arrived. I don't understand what happened or what the delay was. \\n\\nWe were seated upstairs right next to the open kitchen. It actually became uncomfortable because we could see the head chef, very displeased with the kitchen staff, the wait staff, and being clearly aggravated. It made for an uncomfortable evening.\\n\\nAll that being said, their food was quite good but the entire experience was diminished by the poor service."},{"name":"Erin McKenna's Bakery NYC","address":"1642 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"This cute little bakery is located within Disney Springs, and designed for to go orders. Four stars for serving up a wide variety of sweet, allergen-free treats! It's hard to find delicious baked goods for my gluten, soy, and dairy free loves. Erin McKenna's is just the place -but isn't cheap at $5 per cupcake. My recommendation is to spend your pretty pennies on the donuts. It's hard to find that level of divinity in allergy free desserts."},{"name":"Chart House","address":"60 Long Wharf","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Our waiter Robert (Bob) was so rude to us and made us feel so uncomfortable we wanted to leave as soon as we got there.

Aside from me have to play duck and dodge from the smoke screen. Its comfy cozy and the drinks are NICE!! Not nice like cute, but nice like DAMN how many drinks does it take until I am asking for bread to soak up this BUZZ that I really want to keep. They have daily food specials that are just OK- nothing to scream about.\\n\\n I just like drinking here its low-key and local.
