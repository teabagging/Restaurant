I expressed how bad my mother wanted to have lunch at this specific restaurant, however, Tylei made a point to express that it was ABSOLUTELY NO WAY to get a reservation. Being the persistent person I am, I went directly to one of the owners to book a reservation. Upon arrival, I noticed that the restaurant was completely empty. We had the choice to literally sit wherever. This made us feel somewhat discriminated against. Upon confronting the manager, she notified us that there were cancellations. However, I feel if that was the case, she should have made a point to do call backs to book the place out.

I prefer to eat organic, but I am not a stickler about it, especially if I can save a good chunk of money eating conventional. When it comes to my juices, however, I am a stickler. Just as juicing concentrates the number of nutrients found in veggies and fruit, it also concentrates the number of toxins if you're juicing conventional. And the juices are still $10--the same price as juices you can find at other Boston-based juice bars (like Revolution and Cocobeat) that juice organic produce. \\n\\n2) Similarly, other products they use are not as high-quality as they could be. Their almond milk, for example, is loaded with sugar--when I want to eat something healthy, I don't want it to be loaded with sugar. \\n\\n3) Most of their food is good, but when they run out of their prepackaged items (which includes most of their food, besides the avocado toast, coconut yogurt blow and a√ßai bowl), you're out of luck. I recently visited the store and they were out of almost all of their prepackaged food items, even though the store wasn't closing for another 4 hours. \\n\\nI understand that juicing only organic produce and buying high-quality almond milk is more expensive, but I have personally overheard the owner telling another customer that their profit margins were far beyond what they needed to be for the store to be financially viable.

Its called a deal.\\"  My gf and I, both intrigued, considered this fine option but decided against this \\"deal\\" and instead ordered a couple of udon noodle bowls.  After a short debate over whether or not the noodle bowls were soup, we ordered them anyway with some edamame to start.  The bowls did end up being soup, making my girlfriend's miso soup appetizer as useless as the braille on a drive up ATM.  \\n\\nI got my bowl with veggie dumplings in it (potstickers) and must say that they were not cooked correctly.  They looked like they were taken from the frozen bag and dropped directly into the soup, without being pan fried.  For anyone who enjoys potstickers, you'll notice that when the crispy fried bottom on the potsticker is missing, the potsticker tastes like a limp, crappy, wonton impersonator.  This is potsticker blasphemy.  \\n\\nOn a positive note, I have to say kudos to Oishi for serving me a bowl of udon noodle soup that didn't instantly make me ill (I'm looking at you, Hoa Hoabble).  I properly digested this meal and survived, though we'll see what the afternoon will bring.  The udon bowls had a lot of food and they were reasonably priced, but we need to come back sometime for the sushi happy hour.\\n\\nA tip: The guy working the cash register doesn't speak English very clearly, so make sure you get him to repeat your order.

I was excited to find out their plates come with pork fried rice instead of white rice, and included a pork egg roll. However that excitement was quickly dashed once I opened the dish and proceeded to eat the contents of the container. To say it was unpleasant is an understatement. First thing is the sauce, it has burnt orange peel chunks cooked into it which has a wonderful orange aroma, but leaves a horrible bitter flavor in the sauce. Most restaurants I know use orange juice concentrate to get the flavor, not orange peel. Second issue is the fry oil has been overheated which gives all of the fried bits a bitter taste as well, so once you take a bite of the chicken and sauce combined you're left with a horrifyingly bitter taste in your mouth. Because the egg roll was fried in the same oil it too had a bitter taste. The fried rice was mediocre, and was the only edible part of the entire meal.

What ticked us off was that very soon after the bread arrived, our entrees came.  We felt the waitress lied about the wait time to get us to order something additional. I had the special which was seabass. It was too fishy for my taste, probably because it wasn't very fresh. My friend had the gnocchi with sausage, and for $24, we thought there would be more meat, or something special about it, but it tasted just okay. The last annoying thing is that on the debit machine, there were 3 preset levels of tips-15,20,25%.

I chose the chicken tips (one of her recommendations) and pasta. My husband got the beef lasagna, my dad ordered the fried clams, and my mom got the burger.\\n\\nOur food came out fairly quickly. My chicken was probably the best part of anyone's meal. It was very juicy and flavorful. The pasta was ok--nothing to write home about. My husband's lasagna was good but was missing our favorite part-the crispy cheese on the top! Instead, their lasagna is topped with a red sauce.\\n\\nMy mom asked for her burger medium-well but it was definitely more medium with a very pink inside. She had asked if she could sub a salad instead of fries but the server just said \\"they won't do that, they charge extra for a salad.\\" Instead, my husband just gave her his salad his lasagna came with. No big deal but she could've been a bit nicer about it.\\n\\nThe prices are reasonable and portions are large.

I drive with my wife all the way to Orlando from Gainesville sometimes just to eat dinner here.  If you like Lebanese food, this is about as good as it gets and here is why:\\n\\n1) Kibbeh Nayeh.  This is not something you find in a middle eastern restaurant often because it is ground up raw lamb with cracked wheat and spices.  Most middle eastern restaurants in the state are strip mall joints.  That's not to say they aren't any good, but when I eat at those I get my meats well done so I don't get sick.  I can count on one finger how many chances a restaurant gets to do a raw meat dish correctly and still stay in business.  This is some baller stuff.  It's almost as ballsy as a sushi place that serves blowfish.  You simply cannot do this dish unless you have an impeccably clean kitchen, high quality meat, and enough lebanese customers who order it often enough to keep it on the menu.\\n\\n2) The lamb kabobs.  The meat quality is outstanding.  Ask for them RARE. They will melt in your mouth.  They might seem pricey, but the quality is well worth the cost.  These are the best kabobs you will eat...unless you happen to eat your red meat well done.  In thatcase skip these and order the chicken kabobs or the shawarma.  Otherwise this dish will be a confusing waste of your time and money. \\n\\n3) The hummus.  Especially the hummus with hot shawarma on top.  If someone knows a better place to get hummus in this state, please shoot me a message and let me know.  \\n\\n4) The tabouli.  Lebanese food is amazingly simple in spice and taste.  Less is more and it is meant to accentuate the natural taste of a dish.  For instance, Lebanese salad dressing is olive oil, fresh lemon juice, and salt.  People mess with the proportions of these but that is it.  These guys have found a great proportion scheme.  The parsley is always fresh and crisp as well as the tomatoes.\\n\\n5) The baba ganouj.  (see #3 above)\\n\\n6) The pita bread.  I list this last but not certainly not least.  They have their own gas oven that cooks their fresh pita on the spot.  It is brought to your table too hot to touch for the first minute and it is bottomless.\\n\\nThe service is impeccable and matches the cloth napkin atmosphere.  They know how to take care of you but at the same time you can show up in a T-shirt and shorts for a meal.\\n\\nIf you like middle eastern food I would highly recommend this place.  I have read some of the negative reviews on here and honestly I can only think that lebanese food is simply not for everyone...because these guys are the best at it.  \\n\\nThey have a belly dancer on the weekends and hookahs that you can smoke on the patio."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Let me start by saying its not the food....its the service.\\n\\nRecently having a baby this was a rare night that me and my wife had out together.

I am happy to say both meals were well worth the wait.\\n\\nFirst, the brunch. Loved the \\"one savory option, one sweet option, and a drink\\" setup. The hot chocolate was rich and delicious. The puff pastry with the baked egg was light and crisp and tasty. It was really hard to choose just one sweet item, as they all sounded amazing. I went with the graham cracker waffle and my lady went with the blueberry and lemon curd crepe. Both were out of this world, but the slight edge goes to the crepe, due to the delicious honeycomb crunchies on top. Naturally, I couldn't stop myself from ALSO ordering chocolate monkey bread and the ranch homefries, and both were superb (if unnecessary, due to the more-than-fair size of the savory-and-sweet main meal pairing). Aside from the delicious food, my inner 7-year-old really appreciated the games, the coloring materials, and the Nintendo in the waiting area. Pretty rad.\\n\\nOh, and the Burger Night? Next time this thing comes around, you HAVE TO get tickets. I got the veggie burger and it was one of the top 5 burgers I've had my life, hands down. Thick, flavorful patty, perfectly cooked egg on top, and garlicky texas toast. Really tasty. The onion rings were also really good. Full disclosure: I saw the folks next to us order the dinosaur fries and they looked out of this world. I have serious FOMO about those fries...I'm gonna have to go back just for those. The elderflower raspberry lemonade was tart and delicious and both snowcones were awesome. A perfect end to a great meal. Also, did I mention there was a FINGER PAINTING STATION while we waited?!\\n\\nBetween the delicious and original food, the fair prices and portion sizes, and the efforts to keep us entertained while we waited, I left both experiences with a great appreciation for the fine work the folks at Hunnymilk are doing. \\n\\nNow stop reading, plan your visit, and order all of the things!"},{"name":"Shin Jung Korean Restaurant","address":"1638 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"beef tongue with veg mix--tasty.\\ntendon with veg mix--soft & flavorful.\\nbut would really help if the waitress speaks English -___-"},{"name":"Mongo Fire Mongolian Grille","address":"12636 Research Blvd, Ste A-110","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Not bad....\\n\\nPros...\\nThe selection of veggies\\nSauces selection while not amazing is pretty good.\\n\\nCons\\nThe cooking method...the food comes out dry \\nThe rice they serve is miniscule\\nThe sesame pocket bread is tasteless\\n\\nOne reason I love Mongolian is because of the way they cook.

We saw Wild Rice Buffet and almost passed it up but the parking lot was pretty full and when we pulled in, two more vehicles pulled in right behind us so with a place this busy were hoping to finally find a Chinese buffet we'd be pleased with.\\n\\nWe walked in and the place was VERY busy and we were greeted quickly, escorted to a table by the host and our drink orders were taken. My wife has been on a hot water with lemon kick and I ordered my usual unsweet iced tea. We headed off to the buffet and I strolled around looking at everything and took some pictures of the different hot and cold tables. I have to admit that it looked very impressive but the proof is in the taste. When I returned to the table I found some kind of tea/lemonade concoction that was nasty and asked the server to bring me unsweet tea. He also brought my wife iced water with lemon instead of hot water with lemon. He was polite but spoke very little English making it difficult communicate what we wanted. He did bring me some unsweet tea but there was very little tea flavor. For my wife he just brought her a water glass with hot water instead of a teapot with hot water. We just gave up on trying to get him understand what she wanted.\\n\\nI fixed a plate with ten different pieces of sushi and another plate with six of the buffet items. The sushi was actually pretty good and I usually have low expectations of sushi at a buffet. The other plate was a different story. The only thing on the plate I found tasty was the coconut shrimp and there was too much breading on the shrimp. The spring roll was small, very little filling and had no flavor. The beef roll was flavorless and I just spit it into my napkin. The imitation crab surprise had no surprise and no seasoning. Their custard cup was not bad but lacking in seasoning. The whole shrimp that were lightly breaded and deep fried lacked seasoning and I did not get the concept of leaving the head, legs and shell on.\\n\\nI fixed a second plate with several more items from the buffet. The kimchi was gross and was spit into my napkin. The buttered shrimp was not bad but could have used a bit more seasoning. The General Tso had a thin sauce that was actually nicely flavored but the chicken had a thick breading and lacked flavor. The imitation crab salad lacked seasoning but had a nice texture. The honey chicken lacked flavor but was well cooked and the hibachi chicken was also bland but cooked properly. That sweet/sour radish salad was ok but nothing to write home about. \\n\\nI head back for another plate and get a sample of six more items. The fried shrimp, chicken and broccoli along with the sliced beef with onion and pepper were extremely bland. The crab ball with a shrimp tasted like crab flavored breading with a bland shrimp. The pork on a stick was not too bad and the seasoning was only a wee bit light but that rib was dry and the glaze was awful. The shrimp fried rice had very little seasoning.\\n\\nBack for another plate and by this point I have all but given up on finding anything worth going back for seconds. The seaweed salad on the buffet tasted like old seaweed seasoned with old fish stock. The green beans were nice and cooked nicely. The frog leg was too salty but cooked correctly and the meat was even tender. The cabbage salad was bland and so was the pasta salad. Their attempt at a cucumber/tomato salad was not good. The tomato was a flavorless variety and that cucumber piece was way too big. The cantaloupe and honeydew were not ripe enough and not very sweet. The breaded pork with sweet and sour sauce on it was not OK but I would not go back for seconds and that mac n cheese would have been better if it came from the blue and orange box which does not say much.\\n\\nMy wife let me taste her hot and sour soup which was neither hot nor sour so I tried the wonton soup. I figured that would be pretty hard to screw up. I guessed wrong. The mead was flavorless and there were layers of tasteless wonton wrapper and that broth was so bland even with the added green. \\n\\nLast was six of the desserts and they were all from some place that seems to supply several of the Chinese buffet's in the area and ALL were not very good. The cream in the creampuff was good but the shell was stale and tasted like cardboard. Coffee flavored cake was OK at best. The pink stuff in the cup was disgusting. The macaroon was old and stale. The cake with the chocolate chips was also stale and the last cake I was not really sure what it was but it was not good. \\n\\nMy advice, if you are looking for a Chinese buffet, passes this one up because other than the sushi, everything else was pretty much a fail. I have to wonder how the place was packed when they serve food this bad. I think it is a safe bet that if I am back in that part of town, I will not be going back."},{"name":"Smokehouse 21","address":"413 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"It hurts me to write this review.

I went here with 3 others who are as crazy about BBQ as I am. \\n\\nWe had all the meats that were available. Brisket (quite good), chicken, white and dark (very salty). I think they may brine the chicken and if they did it was very tender but very salty. The pulled pork was dry, lacked a smoke ring and good bark. It was not flavorful. I tried it with all the sauces and was disappointed. Their hot link was not good at all. It was soggy and was not crisp or flavorful. They were 86 on the lamb baby backs, spare ribs and steelhead. They were also 86 on several beers in a can. \\n\\nThe sides were interesting on paper but not great tasting. The baked beans were pinto beans with some bits of meats in them and they were fair.

Seriously how long will it be before someone sues (McDonalds coffee style) a pizza place for that?\\n\\nFirst impression was pretty favorable, the pie had balance.  It's a good hand tossed pizza honestly.  Thicker than a traditional NY style, but not deep dish or anything.  They were liberal with their cheese and even handed with the pleasant tasting sauce.  Nothing alarming going on there.  I have had better and worse cheese.  Here's the weird thing, as the pizza cooled down and hit room temp the cheese started reminding us of Domino's cheese back in the day.  Not the end of the world, just an observation. It was strange as I've had it before and I never thought about that.\\n\\nAnyways, the place has a killer oven (Woodstone brand) and I am sure they put out some quality artisan pies judging by their menu.  They managed to get a nice bake on the bottom of the crust, but we saw little evidence of this oven really being put to the test.  Also, a side note...they make some of the better garlic knots we have tasted in Austin.  They managed to hit that sweet spot in between dry and greasy without over-killing the garlic quantity.  Well done guys."},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We had lunch here on a Friday around 1:30 pm and we got seated right away. At first, we werent sure if we entered the correct side of the restaurant because as soon as you walk in, there is no reception area. Soon after, a lady showed up and told us to sit wherever we want. I ordered their lunch special sampler which was loaded with 5 types of dish: lasagna, mussels, chicken marsala, eggplant parmigiana and a vegetable dish. Each one was delicious and had their own distinct flavor. My husband ordered their mussels in marinara sauce over linguine. He said that the sauce was fresh and he compared it to how they make the sauce in Venice-fresh and flavorful.

I had the filet mignon, which was cooked just right and tender enough, but nothing more grand than I've had elsewhere. In fact, it almost had a strange flavor like liquid smoke or something...the broccolini was undercooked.

Fondues are expensive and rare in Vancouver, and it is definitely a decent one with 4 kinds of fruit.  Given the price we paid, it is definitely meeting my expectations.

So I glanced over to the visible drain underneath the machine and omg. It looked like a sewer run-off. Black slime and mold overgrowth and then I knew that the \\"specks\\" were probably mold. The tables and floors were dirty and wobbly, and was apparent from the none existent service, they could care less about cleaning. The pizza was good, the crust was thin and crispy and we enjoyed it.

I'd called ahead to make sure there would be room available and was assured that a table would be ready - but it wasn't.  That should have been a first clue as to how our evening was going to proceed.\\n\\nAfter a bit of confusion (and perhaps frustration?) on the face of the person who greeted us, we were seated.  Unfortunately, we were seated next to a six-top of people who were talking and laughing so loud that the people at the far end of our table were expressing irritation at the volume.  Regardless, we persisted.\\n\\nA second clue should have been that the wait-person who came to take our preliminary order (drinks) didn't think to offer us a drink menu - we had to ask for one - and seemed almost irritated that she was there to help us.  And even she had problems hearing our orders due to the fun the people next to us were having.  She didn't seem too familiar with the restaurant's offerings and seemed confused when we asked questions.\\n\\nOn to the chips and salsa - chips were light and warm, salsa was not chunky (my preference is chunky but this was ok) and had a moderate bit of bite to it.  And they brought lots of it, to their credit.\\n\\nInterestingly, a second wait-person came about 10 minutes into our seating to ask if we wanted to order drinks.  When we informed her that we'd already ordered, she also seemed confused but went away.\\n\\nSomewhere along the way we were informed that, because the restaurant had only one bartender who was \\"backed up\\" our drinks would be a while longer.  Oh well.  \\n\\nEventually our drinks came and our order was taken.  Bear in mind that there were ten of us - and with this in mind the fact that our meals came relatively quickly and correctly was a pleasant surprise.\\n\\nAs for the food, I was disappointed.  As best, this is a generic Tex/Mex plate.  Then again, it beats the HECK out of Chuy's (where I'd eaten a couple of nights before this).  I'll never go back there.

And, let me say, the spices were great, but the espresso and cappuccino... not really.  Why?\\n\\nWell, the espresso itself is quite \\"bright\\" and \\"sharp-edged\\", a fairly sour and light roast.  I understand that this is a trend in Portland (curse you, Heart Roasting!), but that is not true or real espresso, I'm sorry.  If you want to have truly Nordic cup of pour-over, great, get down with your badass inner Viking self and go sack a village or two after, but leave espresso and cappuccino to the people who invented it, the Italians.  This roast completely lacks the richness, redolent of chocolate, spice, dried fruit, and nuts, the depth, and especially the smoothness of a good Italian espresso blend.  Considering geography, this is more what I would expect in the Mediterranean or North African coasts too.  The foam in the cappuccino was also very lofty and stiff, full of air and large, visible air holes.  I prefer the traditional Italian preparation which features tiny, if not invisible, bubbles and a consistency like whipped meringue.

My favorite was hands down the brisket. It's juicy, tender, and you can cut the meat with your plastic fork. It literally melts in your mouth good. The beef rib was probably my next favorite but it was a little too fatty and the bark was a little too salty for my taste. Nonetheless it still melts in your mouth. The pork rib and sausage were also good but the beef was on a another playing field. \\n\\nThere was tons of seating inside and out. They also have a spicy and sweeter BBQ sauce on the tables. The mac was my favorite side! Pickles were a nice change in flavor and the chipotle slaw wasn't sweet at all with a hint of spice. \\n\\nWell worth getting there early for!

I suggest pick-up only. Despite a $2 Delivery charge, they are dicks even if they forgot part of your order.\\n\\nNow the long version: If I was writing this review about a week ago, it would've been four stars, but I'm writing it now: a little more than 24 hours after being horribly spurned in the most egregious way possible by a Chinese food joint. Read on for the horrible details.\\n\\nBeing from New York City, and having grown up with no less than 7 Chinese food places in a five block radius of my house, I tend to be pretty picky with my Chinese food. I expect my wontons to contain pork, and be available pan-fried. I expect a menu to list \\"General Tso's Chicken,\\" and for that item to contain copious amounts of broccoli. And lastly, I expect a little baggy of fried noodles with my order.\\n\\nBrigham Circle Chinese fails to deliver with any of these expectations, but in all fairness, so does every Chinese place in Boston. What is this crap, giving me rolls with my lo mein? Anyway, I've gotten used to it. I know what to expect now after my 4 years of fast food mishaps here in New England. So the first time I happened into Brigham Circle Chinese, shortly after moving to the Hill, I ordered pork lo mein (with no vegetables), and boneless spare ribs. I was amazed. Floored. It was love at first bite. Then I went back a week later, and discovered that those two items were the only items worth ordering. But that's fine! Every couple weeks, call 'em up on my way home, place my order of veggie-less pork lo mein and boneless ribs, then pick up a 6-pack next door at ODB and then grab my order from Brigham Circle Chinese. And you're still wondering, what went wrong?\\n\\nWell, let me tell you. Last night, I was down at the Northeastern dorms hanging out with my friends, and we decided to get some Chinese. My usual order, plus pork fried rice for my friend, and I also requested two cans of Coke. My order showed up in a timely enough fashion, and I tipped the driver two dollars plus the change. Upon returning to my friend's room, not only did I notice a two dollar delivery charge (okay, I said, I'll just note it for next time), but I also noticed they charged me for, but did not deliver, my Cokes. I called them up, and they said they'd bring them back. It's only like, half a mile away, so a half hour later, I called back... and the guy said I got them! He said that he called, and I confirmed that I had gotten them. I argued, and he put me on hold for 20 minutes. Eventually, I hung up and called back, and he said he'd credit me... thing is, I paid cash. And I was very thirsty. I didn't want a credit, I wanted my soda. Not that unreasonable, considering the two dollar delivery charge. The guy on the other end of the line, who eventually told me his name was \\"Bill,\\" said either I could get two free Cokes next time I go in (free? I just paid for them!) or I could go up to the Circle and pick them up, but they can't deliver them. I tried arguing that I should be credited with the delivery charge, too, since they didn't deliver my full order, but he refused. He was pretty rude about the entire thing: he was mean, blamed me, and flat-out lied and told me I got something I didn't.\\n\\nI promised Bill I'd never be ordering delivery from them again, and I won't... but I will still be picking up my occasional pork lo mein (no vegetables) and boneless spare ribs. And I'll be back here after the next time I go in to let you all know what happened with my $1.50."},{"name":"Relish Gastropub and Bar","address":"888 Nelson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I didn't try any of their food, but they have a different $3 local beer every night :) Very clean, well decorated, great atmosphere, and quick service.

Forget about it.\\n\\nNow, if you're lucky enough to arrive at Contigo on a pleasant evening you're in for a real treat. This was the case during my Friday night visit, and while it took roughly an hour to get a table, the atmosphere was lively.

Star Granted. \\n\\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\\n\\nAs hungry as I was, I opted for both a starter and a main:\\n\\nPigs in a Blanket: $6.00\\nRabbit and Dumplings: $15.00\\n\\nSo we were looking at $21.00 of food here, and while I was skeptical at first, these were some seriously dense food items. The pigs in a blanket alone could have been a meal, and the dumplings in the rabbit and dumplings were like scones on steroids. While it might not seem like it at first, there's some value here at Contigo. Star Granted. \\n\\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\\n\\nThe food at Contigo was good, but as I alluded to earlier, it didn't blow me away. The pigs in a blanket honestly weren't a good start, with very standard sausage falling a bit flat with rolls that didn't taste any different from pilsbury. They fell apart quickly, and I was happy to move onto my Rabbit & Dumplings dish.\\n\\nThere was good flavor on account of the sauce and seasoning, but a slightly larger portion of shredded rabbit would have been nice. As mentioned previously, the dumplings were extremely dense, but they lacked a bit in the flavor department. This was a good unique dish, but up the rabbit and put some flavor in the dumplings to bring to light a dual star meal. Single Star Granted. \\n\\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\\n\\nContigo has a great atmosphere if the weather is cooperating, but the food could use just a tad bit of improvement.

The interior design is filled life with some crazy ceiling lights and cool wall paint. Speaking about interior designing, the seats are perfectly spaced out, giving room to move comfortably. Now let's get down to the best parts of this review which are the restaurant's menu and the actual food itself. The menu consists of a pizza customization option, along with some already pre-mad pizzas and there are some seasonal salad meals and desserts. Out of those options, I decided to make my own pizza pie and It was tastefully well done. The pizza looked organized and not sloppy. Even with all of those toppings, the pizza was not filled with grease and surely I was able to taste all of the ingredients. The dough was different to me and in my opinion, it was a huge landscape gamer changer. I never had pizza with yeast dough and it fully satisfied me.

I don't know if they changed management or were sold or what, but what used to be a really nice, fun, enjoyable evening out with my husband has now consistently turned into an irritating folly.  \\n\\nI ALWAYS get the Ensalada Mexicana there.  I have for years.  I fell in love with it the first time I was there and enjoyed it every time for a few years.  Then suddenly, maybe a year ago, my salad arrived with no avocado.  When I mentioned it to the waiter, he said it does not come with avocado.  I said it does indeed, and had every time for a few years, but he insisted this was not a new rule.  He was kind enough to bring me some, though.  He acted like I was a bit crazy, like I didn't know what came on the salad I'd eaten countless times.\\n\\nAt our next meal there, they stopped bringing out beans for the table.  We had to ask for them.  They had apparently changed it to bringing beans out only if you ask.  \\n\\nWe tried them again tonight.  We noticed that once again, the vibe there was off.  There were many empty tables and yet it took our server a long time to get to us initially, then a long time to bring our food out.  When he brought my salad, it had a big chunk of chicken on top.  I stared at it and asked, \\"is this chicken?\\"  to which he replied, \\"Yes, it usually comes with a piece of Caesar Salad chicken on top.\\"  My husband helpfully pointed out that I hadn't ordered Caesar Salad.  The waiter said well, it comes with chicken.  I told him I had ordered this salad many times and it has never come with chicken.  We asked to see the menu again - no mention of chicken anywhere on this salad.  He took the salad to the back, where they just took the chicken off and brought back the same salad - I know, because there was a dent on top where the chicken used to be.\\n\\nOkay, whatever.  The waiter couldn't explain why the Ensalada Mexicana suddenly comes with chicken and acted like we were odd to question it.  I started eating it, and the hostess wandered by and asked how everything was.  I told her how confused I was about the chicken incident, and she said it does \\"automatically\\" come with chicken.  I couldn't get her or the waiter to understand that it never had before!  Or that it doesn't say so now on the menu!  \\n\\nBoth the waiter and the hostess were very lackadaisical and didn't seem at all concerned with whether or not we were happy, and were actually defensive.  My husband and I are reasonable people, and polite.  We weren't trying to cause trouble.\\n\\nAnd my salad was wrong in another way:  The thing I like best about it - now that the thing I used to like best (avocados) had been taken away - is the spicy chipotle dressing.  And there was no spicy chipotle dressing on the salad, even though the menu says it comes with it.\\n\\nThe waiter said he'd bring us free sopapillas to make up for it.  We hadn't ordered sopapillas and didn't want them; we wanted the correct salad or at least a gesture that meant something.  But the bill came, and not only were we charged full price for everything, they charged my husband $2 extra without telling him, because he had ordered two shrimp and two fish tacos instead of four of one kind.  The waiter had assured him it was okay to order this way, never telling him of the upcharge.\\n\\nIt was chilly in the restaurant, service was slow, our water glasses were allowed to get empty, my food was all wrong, my husband was overcharged, and there was no caring on anybody's part to make it right.  We have noticed the past few times we've gone that nobody seems to be in charge and nobody seems to give a gosh darn.\\n\\nThree strikes.  You're out, Agave.

He told us of the chef and all the wonderful things they were doing there; so we told him we would try it again.\\nTonight after attending a movie @ the Lake Twin Cinema right next door, we decided to give OLH a try just for drinks & Hors Doeuvres.  This is a small bar and I was quite surprised to see a baby grand sitting in the corner complete with mic.  We sat in the lower level with a couple of other couples. After waiting for 6-7 min. my husband excused himself to use the restroom..... when he returned we still had not seen a waitress; by now we're talking about 15 min. Since we walked in.  A waitress approached and took our order of \\"2 Mexican Coffees\\" and I asked to see Hors Doeuvres Menus. She came back about 4 min. later and asked if we wanted their house Spanish Coffee, as it was comparable to a Mexican Coffee.  I know the difference between both drinks and their costs.  I said no we'd like a Mexican Coffee with Tequila and Kahlua.  She went through the explanation again as to how their Spanish Coffee was the same.  NOT. I politely explained we only wanted coffee, tequila and kahlua. She said OK and left.  \\nOur drinks arrived promptly and correctly along with the menus. And we began to wait to give our order...... after 35 min more with no contact with anyone, our glasses being empty I walked over to the bar and asked for our ticket and handed the bartender my credit card.  I explained that we had waited and waited to give our order and had been ignored. He protested that there was only he and one waitress to serve the entire bar and entire restaurant ~ Like that was MY problem. As nicely as I could I told him that we were tired of being ignored and I just wanted to pay and leave.  To his credit.... he said the drinks were on the house and handed me my card back. \\n NOT a good experience.

Great place to unwind or go on a date without busting too much through your wallet.\\nMy girlfriend and I had their special Valentines 3 course meal only for $30! \\n\\nWe started out with cocktails- I had the Hemingway Diquiri while she had the Old Rose. If you like your cocktails on the strong end, you'll love Hops N Scotch's concoctions. Hemingway is a mix of rum and grapefruit juice and it came out lovely. I loved how I was able to see and taste the pulp with every sip. Fresh grapefruit juice FTW! My valentine meanwhile had the Old Rose and thoroughly enjoyed it as well.\\n\\nFor first course, we had their seared scallops and crab cakes. Seared scallops were excellent, I loved how they topped it off with grates of red pepper so you had a little kick of spicyness, my favorite out of the entire dinner. The crab cakes were great in that it was not deep fried in bread crumbs and you got plenty of crab meat. The little greens on the side with pineapple chunks complimented well with the cakes. \\n\\nFor our main course, we had the short ribs and salmon. The short ribs was a miss. Lacking in any sort of sauce taste even though it was braised in beer . We were expecting BBQ style ribs so if you're into tasting beef for what it's worth without any sauce, then you'll like it. My salmon was seared perfectly so the skin on the bottom was a little crunchy. I will praise Hops N' Scotch's generosity in serving size as my salmon piece was big with plenty of basmati rice on the side. For a pre-fixed, full course meal that could easily be over 40$, it's nice to see the management didn't sacrifice on quality. \\n\\nFor desserts, they ran out of what was pre-planned on their menu so we had the choice of choosing various chocolate or cheese cakes. Both turned out very heavy and rich in chocolate. Choco lovers won't be disappointed taste and aesthetics wise. \\n\\nPet peeve I had was they were slightly pushy in clearing the plates away. Perhaps it was their need to turn over tables quickly for new customers, but we were asked several times if we were done with our plates even though there was still food on them. What part of talking and enjoying food slowly do they not understand? The crab cake salad was half finished and taken away even though I told them earlier I was still working on it.\\n\\nOverall, a great addition and replacement to Finale in Coolidge Corner."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I was in heaven.

I made reservations 2 weeks ahead of time and informed them that 1) a smaller group would be there earlier and 2) that the larger group would be showing up between 5-530 with a couple stragglers. I was told that it'd be fine to show up early and that tables would already be setup - that was not true. The majority of the group was there by 515ish and they had to move 2 separate parties to different tables to accommodate our group (hope those other groups were offered something for the random shuffle). Nothing was setup ahead of time and we didn't get the last table to match our reservation for quite a while. After our table was completely full with people who had to grab extra chairs themselves, I was approached by a manager who asked how many more people would be there and informed me that I'd get \\"one more table and then no more\\", gesturing with his hand across his throat as if it was a threat to not give me space I reserved because the 4 stragglers I mentioned when I called, had not arrived. Several people in our group saw the interaction and were fairly disappointed with his behavior. We shook it off and continued our night. \\nThe service was hit and miss and got worse after the shift change. By the end of the night, a few people left to find another place after never receiving their food. Several folks were given the wrong orders. The appetizers took almost an hour to show (were later taken off the check). Several people were told their miscalculated checks were their fault for moving seats - No one moved, this was a product of our ever growing tables since the reserved tables were not setup ahead of time.

As for the sushi and sashimi, they are slow to come out and the sashimi are cut very small.   They are fresh, so I guess fresh and small is better than bad and large.        \\n\\nHow can this be the same Feng Shui Restaurant or chain  that is getting all the bad reviews?

We were in a private room which we didn't want, but they said with 14 there wasn't a choice though there appeared to be lots of other spaces where we could have been seated.

You know, because It's absolutely exhausting watching other people run for hours on end while you stand there with a belly full of Bloody Mary and Eggs Benedict. Walking up Charles, we noticed a somewhat empty Bin 26 and decided that the promise of not waiting for sustenance and thirst reprieve was rather appealing. Give that we'd both dined here before, we had an idea of what kind of experience we were committing to this afternoon: meh service, an atmosphere that's a bit more serious than necessary, good food, excellent (if not expensive) wine list.\\n\\nAfter setting down at the bar, we'd enlisted the help of the bartender on explaining how the wine list worked. In the past I've ordered by the bottle here, so the 100, 250, 500 breakdown was unfamiliar to me. Basically, 100 is a smaller-than-normal glass pour serving: a bit more than a tasting portion, but not a full glass. 250 is a larger pour than a regular glass and the price reflects this, ranging from a reasonable $11 to a whopping $85, with most falling in the $15 - $20 range. 500 is about three glasses and prices are reflective of what you might see for average bottles in most restaurants, from $20 - $150, with the average falling in the $50 mark. To be fair, the 100ml prices are not super expensive, and you're getting a pour that's pretty close to a regular glass, which also may allow you to try a few wines in one sitting. \\n\\nThe food here has always been good, though this experience stands out among my others here. We split the Cocoa Tagliatelle with Porcini Mushroom Ragout scented with Nepitella, which was a nice amount for two people share at $18. The dish was portioned nicely, without overloading the plate or causing too concern to question the value. It's certainly not everyday affordable, but the ingredients are top notch, fresh, combined artfully and each seems to have the opportunity to shine through on it's own. Al dente pasta, lightly coated with the porcini ragout, chunks of mushroom and overall taste factor that was rich but not heavy.\\n\\nThe service at the bar is a vast improvement over the dining area. The bartenders are quick and friendly, not at all pushy about ordering more food or higher prices wines and easily accessible when something is needed. Even the hostess seemed warmer than my past experiences.

So maybe the portions are small because there are a million calories anyway?\\n\\nOverall, I like Blu Olive but I'm not super excited about it. Maybe if they rotated their menu more I would be more tempted to check it out, but I've been there 3 times and the beet raviolis are always the only vegetarian option, and the other items don't seem to change either.

Ehh, it can't be good right? WRONG!!!\\n\\nAs a perpetual food truck chaser, I'm always on a lookout for new food trucks so I was excited when I found out there would be a line-up of out-of-city and out-of-state food trucks at the 3rd Annual San Francisco Street Food Festival this past Saturday, 8.20.11. \\n\\nSeveral days prior to the festival, I did my due diligence of Yelping all of the visiting food trucks since my tummy could not fit food from 60+ vendors (I would have attempted to but didn't want to spend my Saturday night in the ER). We have a lot of Asian Fusion Food Trucks in SF, most of which totally miss the mark with in terms of having bold, authentic Asian flavors. And being from Texas and not being Asian owned (CORRECTION: The owner is Hapa), I had my suspicions about The Peached Tortilla. Nonetheless, I wanted to try it they were making a special appearance in SF.\\n\\nAt the SF Street Food Festival, The Peached Tortilla had two offerings: \\n*THE BAHN MI TACO: Braised Pork Belly, Pickled Daikon & Carrots, Sriracha Mayo & Cilantro ($3)\\n*THE PAD THAI TACO: Chicken or Tofu in Pad Thai Sauce, Bean Sprouts, Peanuts, and Lime ($3)\\n\\nWhen we placed our order at 11:45 AM, they ran out of Bahn Mi Tacos so we paid and waited for a new batch to come out which took about 7 minutes. It was very confusing because there were two windows for ordering (no separate pick-up window), they never took down our name and we were never given a receipt or number. There was a small crowd of people also waiting for the Bahn Mi Tacos; all not knowing who was first in line to get the next batch. For a street food festival that spread across 7 streets and was packed with several thousands of people, this was very disorganized on the truck's part which is why I had to knock down 1 Star. \\n\\nBANH MI TACO - THE BEST ASIAN FUSION TACO I'VE HAD!\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SIIzjxEP8-SMxVQPp8qPBQ?select=wKjW0TCTRKem3mOk-wSwgA\\nAtop a flour tortilla (allows the flavors to shine through more than a corn tortilla) were tender, melt-in-your mouth chunks of pork belly, crisp daikon and carrots, a creamy sriracha mayo and fresh sprigs of cilantro. Each bite was filled with a savory richness from the pork belly which was balanced by the acidic veggies with a nice kick from the aioli.  The taco was savory, sweet, sour and spicy nirvana and encompassed all the authentic flavors of a bahn mi! SUCCESS!\\n\\nComing from an Asian household where my mom can't even properly cook the most basic Chinese dish without burning it, overcooking it or it tasting like it came from a steam tray at a 1 Star Chinese Buffet Restaurant (Sorry, Ma), I have mad respect when a Hapa can nail down the authentic flavors of Asian cuisine. The Peached Tortilla has done this, so much so that it TRUMPS SF's Kung Fu Tacos, Hapa SF, Senor Sisig, IZ IT in terms of bold Asian flavors and quality ingredients.

While intrigued, I've never worked up the courage to order those dishes myself. \\n\\nMisc: Once when I was calling in take-out, the manager asked me if I knew where the restaurant was. Not that it made a difference, but I found it amusing that he would consider the idea that I would order food from a restaurant if I didn't know where the place was. \\n\\nThis place is also open very late in case you get hungry at 2am on a Friday night.\\n\\nOverall: Standard Chinese fare with great scallion pancakes.

Carmelina's is a small restaurants with only a handful of tables, hence the need to make reservations. There are a few spots at the bar from impromptu diners but those spots fill up very quickly. \\n\\nNow on to the food. The appetizer portion (on menu for $12) of the baby eggplant was one of the best things I consumed that night. The eggplant is thinly sliced in ovals, lightly fried, and served with tomato sauce, parmigiano, and basil. It was crispy and delicious. Our whole table was raving about them. The other big hit was the mushroom risotto which was $14 for the appetizer. It was the best risotto I've ever had, hands down. The mushrooms were carefully prepared and folded into the perfectly prepared risotto that was light and fluffy that most other risottos haven't mastered in my book. \\n\\nWe also ordered a few entrees that were delicious as well but most memorable were the penne gorgonzola and the baked rigatoni, each of those were $18 for the entree portion.

This place was cited as one of them, so I decided to give it a try.\\n\\nThe place from the outside looks old, rundown, and doesn't attract the eye at all.  The yellow sign doesn't look good, with a logo with looks like it was designed from the 1980's.  And upon entry, the inside is as old as the outside...very gray, dimly lit, worn carpet and walls - the building truly does show it's age.  But none of this matters if the food and service are as good as the average 4 star average suggests, right?\\n\\nWeeeeeell.  The service is pleasant enough, and the food was alright...but the problem here is, it wasn't necessarily *much* better than everyone else.  OK sure, it's slightly better than the infamous chains like Sushi Town, Sushi Garden, and all the other McDonald's of sushi places.\\n\\nThe spicy tuna roll was good, the chicken teriyaki had a smoky flavor which was so-so, but the tuna and salmon sashimi were only just OK.  Not better than really any usual chain places around Vancouver.  Service was fine...nothing to take issue with, but nothing to rave about either.\\n\\nEven odder was that this was dinner on a Friday night, and the place wasn't all that busy.  Maybe this speaks to just how much competition there is(there was some strange \\"BBQ sushi\\" place or some such just down the road.\\n\\nSo in closing...this is not a 4 star place.  Sorry guys, but it just isn't.  It's 3 stars, meaning it's just fine to eat at for a \\"regular\\" dinner.  But this is not a place I would take a date to.

I liked that they had crispy potatos, almost chopped up pomme frites mixed in with the hash to give it crunch.\\n\\nNow, there were also minuses.  For example my friend's tacos were on the small side (which may have been another reason for the second order).  And while I enjoyed my hash very much, there wasn't all that much heat to the flavor.

What a shame!"},{"name":"Frutilandia","address":"510 SW Yamhill St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Frutilandia is good, clean, fresh, REAL food. This is what I like. It's simple, it's healthy, and it's delicious. The sandwiches and licuados are what you might make at home if you have a blender and a big pile of assorted fresh delicious fruits and vegetables sitting around and wanted to make lunch. There are tons of menu options all over the wall, but you can order any combination you want of anything, basically. \\n\\nThe licuados are the way to go: just fruit, and milk, blended creamy. They can add extra sugar (I say no, as it's already sweet) and/or chocolate powder or blended nuts. If you add nuts, they take them and blend them right there into paste and it all blends into your drink. It's delicious and there's no weird ingredients or tastes, just fresh fruit and fresh milk! Why is this rare these days? I like licuados because they don't have ice in them (I don't like super-cold drinks and there's no diluting from the ice melting), they're suitable for hot or cold days. However, if you prefer smoothies or milkshakes they have those too.\\n\\nThey also have a small assortment of simple sandwiches. Again, real basic and fresh, that's what I like about this place. Fresh vegetables if you want (all customizable and made to order), or just a simple cheese sandwich, cheese on bread, no grease. After I eat here, I feel healthy, comfortable, and full, with no afternoon malaise. \\n\\nA couple of other notes:\\n* There's very little interior seating. There's a small window bar to sit at if it's raining or something, I always take my food to go. If it's a nice day and you don't have anywhere to go, you can cross the street and eat in pioneer square, feeling glad you did not order from one of the greasy foodcarts ringing it. There's generally nobody else in there eating, which caused me some concern when they first opened because I was afraid they weren't getting enough business, but they've managed to hang on, for which I'm grateful (adding background music was also a good call, at first it was really quiet with just you and the sandwich maker, now it's comfortable feeling).\\n\\n*It's easy to miss this place unless you're standing on the sidewalk, if it doesn't jump out at you just park and walk down the block. The main window is now mostly covered with fruit pictures so that helps. \\n\\n*There's tons of fresh fruit always sitting around on the counter and in the display case, of many varieties. It's always fresh and looking good whenever I go in. This must be their trademark. There's no fruit you wouldn't want to just pick up and pop in your mouth right then and there, unlike a lot of places. Actually unlike any other places I can think of in the general downtown area restaurants and food carts. \\n\\n*It's definitely enough for lunch though it may not seem like it would be at first thought, but also would make a good breakfast/brunch/anytime snack.\\n\\n*I think they have some kind of punch card for frequent buyers but I always forget about it."},{"name":"Twelve Hours","address":"559 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm obsessed with this place.

When our food arrived the waitress asked who had the chicken primavera, while she was holding a plate of  alfredo , I said I had ordered the primavera but clearly that was not it, she slams the plate down with a glare. \\n\\nRather rudely she told us the plate burned her hand. Not to be unsympathetic but I did not tell her to take out a burning plate. Overall service was just bad, the waitress named Auntie was incredibly rude throughout our whole meal. \\n\\nWhen the check came we paid half with cash the other half with a credit card. I asked her to simply swipe the amount with the tip already included. My total was 14 and I asked her to just swipe 18. When the receipt came out, she and I left the tip section blank she demanded that I tip her.... I tired to explain to her that i had simply included it in the total. But she was extremely rude and argumentative. Not wanting to start an argument, I just added another dollar. \\n\\nAlthough the service was unsatisfactory, I have worked in the restaurant industry hate not being tipped, so I usually always tip at least 15% even if the service is bad. However I looked  up my credit bill online... I was charged $22. So I guess auntie decided to write in her own tip... I'm pretty sure this is illegal. So basically she gave herself a $8 tip on a $14 bill. I did call my credit card company and get the money refunded. \\n\\nI usually love Mom and Pop places, however I definitely will never go here to eat again. The waitress there was clearly unethical.

Unfortunately, the food itself was not that great.  I found many of the meats to be very dry (the chicken especially), and to not be flavored well enough (the lamb especially). The buffett had several items that were fairly disappointing. For example, the pasta was soft/mushy/overcooked and without great flavor. The rice on the other hand was amazing as were the plantains. It was also quite pricey for dinner (about $22 pp for the buffett). Parking on a Thursday night (granted it was St. Patty's Day) was a real hassle. We circled Inman Square about 5 times before coming upon a spot in a pay lot nearby.

The first was for Valentine's Day, and the second was date night. First off, reservations are recommended, however they don't reserve all seating. While the restaurant was nearly booked by 7am, my partner and I were able to get in at 6:30pm on a weeknight with only a 30 minute wait. They actually take you to a waiting area on the covered deck, and give you menus to peruse. A waiter comes by and takes your drink orders, and you're free to place food orders as well. After a short wait, we were escorted to our seats on the back patio, which is pet friendly, and has a large industrial fan for those warm days.\\n\\nThe cocktails here are amazing - I highly recommend the Moscow Sow. Happy hour is from 4:30-6:30 every day, and it is super affordable; $2 off drinks and several $5 small plates. Honestly you could fill up on happy hour items alone, which is what I plan for our next girls' night out.\\n\\nThe chicken liver mousse is creamy and flavorful, personally my favorite starter. This second visit, we wanted to try something  a little different, so we opted for the charcuterie, which was a fantastic choice. You can tell they put a lot of thought into the little details. The plate came with duck, house made sausage, pickled radish and onion, pate, liver mousse, cured salmon, two types of cheeses, candied almonds, and a white herb sauce I can only describe as divine. If you run out of toasted bread, they're happy to offer you more.\\n\\nSo somehow after the generous cheese and charcuterie, you'll find the room for entrees. The duck breast with turnips is my personal favorite, closely followed by the candied pork belly. All perfectly cooked, exploding with flavor. Though the entrees come with sides, you'll want to try the deconstructed brussels sprouts. Now let me tell you, I've tried my darndest to recreate these delights at home. I'd come just to eat these alone. Crispy, light, with just a touch of sweetness from the golden raisins.\\n\\nThe dark chocolate cake was in a word, decadent. It was so rich, we couldn't finish it, which isn't a terrible thing. \\n\\nThe decor is well done; classy and a touch rustic without being overdone.

The Caprese has cute little circlets of mozzarella that barely cover the gigantic red pinwheels of tomato, but both are tasty and fresh. \\nThe Arugula, Endive, and Radicchio Salad is a beautifully chopped, festively arranged three-point trefoil with non-descript vinaigrette.\\nI prefer vegetarian risotto, but the Risotto Al Pescatore was really good. All kinds of shellfish made for concoction that was all kinds of tasty.\\nAnd Assaggio could have easily made us buy their dessert, but instead they encouraged us bring our own cake, which they cut and served at no extra cost.\\n\\nAt Assaggio, the food is good and the service is phenomenal.

The massive amounts of hype got me in the door. But it's definitely possible this first time was my last time.\\n\\nPros:\\nWe started off with cocktails and an appetizer/small plate. Both of which were INCREDIBLE. If you get a chance to order the lamb shoulder small plate, do it. The flavors were well developed, savory and unique while not being unfamiliar or alienating. Whoever thought that one up deserves ALL the praise. Our server, Chance, was also pretty amazing. I'm not sure if he's a seasoned pro, or Contigo worked to cultivate his skills as a waiter...but he was great. He is a great face to the restaurant. \\n\\nCons: \\nUnfortunately, the entrees were...\\"ok\\". We ordered the bavette (sp?) and the rabbit&dumplings. The bavette was the better dish. Interesting, with clever flavors. The steak was cooked perfectly but I feel like I'm just used to better cuts of steaks for the price of the dish. The rabbit and dumplings dish had more red flags on it. It wasn't seasoned in any kind of interesting way. The rabbit was indistinguishable from any other kind of meat. It could've been chicken and it would've tasted exactly the same. So, in that way, overall the dish had a major chicken pot pie vibe going on.\\nOn top of all that, in my opinion, Contigo has fallen victim to that horrible foodie/fine dining stereotype of having beautiful dishes that also happen to not be a whole lot of food. I'm a big dude and I like to eat. So I understand that it's likelier to be something I complain about vs someone else. However, my gf, a much smaller human than me, seconded my thoughts about leaving the restaurant not quite full. And let's be real, it's pricey! I don't need to be stuffed like some American caricature of gluttony. But I'd like to be full and satisfied, especially for how much everything costs.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nContigo has a lot of hype. Given the fact that admittedly a large percentage of my review is opinion, you should still check this place out and see how it goes for you. Maybe the planets aligned in some weird way. Go see Chance, though. That guy was great."},{"name":"Cedar's Restaurant","address":"7732 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Fantastic!

However, last night I decided to try the dining in experience, and I was not impressed. I ordered the Xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and pork panfried noodles, both of which I had tried via takeout and loved. The pork panfried noodles were again delicious. However, I have to agree with previous reviewers who thought the Xiao Long Bao tasted like the frozen kind that you can buy at the local Asian grocery stores. In fact, I have tried the frozen variety, and actually think that taste better than what I had last night at Helen Asian Kitchen. I suspect what happened last night, and perhaps what happened to the previous reviewers who were not impressed, was that they ran out of the real thing and thought that they could substitute the frozen kind without the customer knowing the difference. I would have preferred that they had been honest and simply told me that they were out. My so-called soup dumplings had not one drop of soup in them; believe me I looked in each dumpling. They were dry, and the meat inside did not really taste like meat. My assessment was confirmed when I brought the leftovers home to my carnivore dog, who spit out the \\"meat\\" after tasting it, and refused to try any more. This is especially noteworthy because my dog literally eats almost anything. The restaurant is a little out of my way from both my workplace and my home, so I probably will not be back for dine-in service again.

It is Southern style, so it has more of the cinnamon and anise then the subtler Northern style (which I usually prefer). Frequently the Southern style can be dominated by the spices, and lack the richness of a good full bone broth. Pho Thanh was both fragrant, as well as rich and full bodied. \\n\\nAs a matter of fact my only criticism of their pho was the freshness of the bean sprouts.

The mood is nice, lighting not too dark, not too bright. We were seated within a few minutes of our 7:30 reservation. My partner and I could hear each other talk and we enjoyed the atmosphere.\\nThe, manager, I think, when noticing something was amiss (the waiter failed to bring my husbands glass of wine after placing the order 10 minutes prior) came up promptly and got the glass of wine himself.\\n\\nOk, we started with some lovely lookings apps. I had a bland salmon cake on an interesting pile of 'cucumber salad' that after tasting my partner thought was slaw. My husbands Watermelon Salad with feta, arugula, sunflower seeds, black olives was great though.\\n\\nThe main reason we came was for the sirloin. We are beef people, I have eaten beef across the globe and was certainly disappointed. We both had the Met Club \\"Club Cut\\" Sirloin tomato-corn tart,  & buttery spinach. After my first bite, I knew something wasn't right, but I ate it anyway, although didn't finish (from a person who can put away a 30 oz prime rib). It was terribly greasy, from the sirloin to the tart. And horribly bland. No salt or pepper on the table, although our waiter did offer fresh ground pepper to the party to our right, although they were ordering from the regular menu, so it seemed as though you got better treatment that way. The waiter showed no interest in us or our meal. But if my tip were already included too and I knew the quality of the meal being served, I might try to avoid us too.\\n\\nAnd on the way home our stomachs were not in good shape. We both took turns in the bathroom for half the night.\\n\\nNo we would not go back, and we wonder if the food is always like this, or did they just throw a bunch of mediocre food together for the sake of getting people in the door for restaurant week. How do they get new clientele with a sampling like this? A big disappointment.

I thought I'd give it a few different tries.\\n\\nTime 1 - biked over with a friend around 2:30pm.  We had to \\"ask\\" for the free fries with our burgers.  I tried the Marie Laveau with an order of fries.  For there only being only being one order ahead of us, it took 20 minutes for our order to be ready.  The fries had some good cajun seasoning and those were a hit.  The cheese is literally stuffed in the burgers and that is the extra wow factor.  The burger had a good thickness, but you actually couldn't taste much of the other ingredients  - roumalade was lacking.\\n\\nLots of hipsters on fixed gear bikes around.\\n\\nTime 2 - friends and I drove.  Guy with a mullet at the counter was really cool.  There were a lot of people there - we got the last bench that was free.  The order before us was a family of 7, so we were ready for a wait.  It took about 25 minutes.  This time we all got the Frida Kahlo.  Honestly - tasted like the Marie Laveai except there was  a fried egg.  I prefer my yolk to be a little runny, but I didn't request it any way.  The burger kept its form well and once again I liked the cheesy middle.  The disappointment though was that the fries were under cooked - a little soggy/hard - you could tell they used to be frozen and were removed too quickly from the deep fryer.  I could have said something, but they were still busy.\\n\\nTime 3 - went with a friend on a Thursday around 12:15pm.  Not as busy, but it still took awhile.  So, what annoyed me was that they ask you for your name.  My friend and I were having a conversation that went awhile - too long.  It was probably 30 minutes and I went to check on our order.  They boxed it up for \\"to go.\\" I was disappointed that they never called out our name and they boxed it up.  Nevertheless the burger was still good. The fries were better cooked and had good seasoning.  I tried the Chi Cheng this time - could use more of that wasabi spread.  Barely any wonton strips or grilled onions.\\n\\nAll in all, I don't know if it is worth it to get or expect some fancy burgers - just get a normal one. Burgers are a little pricy on the $8 end.  The workers are usually the hip/cool crowd.  They are either really cool in talking to you or rather distant and don't care.\\n\\nRegardless, this is a special burger joint to give a try.  It's a different kind of burger. I might add this to the list of places to take your out of town friends, but after you've explored some other places 1st.

I realize that they had just opened, but the person at the door was on her laptop at the bar eating her lunch - some sort of salad. I just thought they weren't open. \\n\\nAfter I got over that part, though, I had the two eggs any style and it was pretty standard. I realize there isn't a whole lot one can do with eggs for breakfast, but most places have their own twist. That's not what I got from my meal here, and the sourdough bread was burnt. The one thing I did really like was their tea, but it's hard to mess up English Breakfast!

Surprise! Oh did I mention it's raining hello kitties!   Ok. But the other location is just a few miles up ya!  Did I mention it doesn't serve ramen which is why I wanted the Anderson location in the first place. Raining,ramen and sushi.  Oh well.  I decided to try it anyway.  But I had to take off a star for the confusion  Arrived  and Nina Simone is playing. Removed Star back into play.   The waitress is lovely! I order and she recommends another special dish that is similar. I wanted a sunomono so I made sure the dish had cucumber she assured me it did.  It didn't.  But it was good. Japanese ceviche   Miso soup for the baby was pretty cold even though she warned me it was hot. So I don't think that was intentional. The chili escolar was a new way to try an old favorite. I really liked and was surprised by the garlic chips.  Like garlic pop rocks. Yum.  I ended up having to leave without getting the sampler but the fish varieties were unique.  My only other critique was the knife skills on my ceviche.  Picture attached.  With Japanese food you expect very good knife skills right.  It's not uchi/ko.

Thanks to Yelp and users for your reviews which perhaps, though  good, didn't do full justice to Lupo. It probably takes a good waitperson and staff to help blossom a nice menu at the table. And that was just so. Reservations were taken easily at near-last-minute. We were shown to our table for two immediately and the two hours passed with us not realizing just how much we enjoyed this experience. First we shared a focaccia that was house made with tomatoes and zucchini; the bread itself was pleasantly sweet and tasty, served fresh and warm and large enough perhaps for four (we managed to eat most of it). There was a special salad selection which featured frizzled lettuce, yellow beets, thinly sliced hearts of palm, an incredible mozzarella which was infused with cream to make it sensational and finally drizzled with evoo and balsamic vinegar. Our entrees were cannelloni in the smaller portion (they have two sizes in case you want the pasta as an accompaniment to a main course) and a seafood risotto which featured the risotto infused with ink from the squid. Both were very satisfying. Lupo's entree menu was complete with meat, fish, pork and chicken and neighboring tables seemed to be delighted with their selections. Topping off our meal which was accompanied by glasses of red and white wine from a fairly broad wine menu was a lemon tart which, also house made, was heavenly.

Through Yelp and friends who recently visited Austin I created a short list including La Barbeque, Franklin's, and The Salt Lick. In the end I chose La Barbeque because of the infamous beef rib. I've eaten pork spare ribs and baby back all over the county but I had never had a good beef rib. Before I get to the food I'll describe the venue. Half the restaurant is seating. Some communal tables and some smaller 4-6 tops. The other half of the restaurant is actually a small market where they sell all kinds of goods. I was warned prior to my visit to anticipate a wait. I went on a Wednesday at 12:30 P.M., peak hours. The line started outside and continued in a serpentine fashion along the right wall. I waited about an hour. I would have provided five stars if the employees figured out a way to improve the process. The whole time I was in line there were seats available at tables. Inside and outside. The wait wasn't about table space. Also, BBQ has already been smoked and Cooked for the most part right? It seemed that the wait was due to the fact that they had 3-5 employees behind the counter but only one cutting and plating the meat. It was frustrating to wait so long while there were plenty of seats available. Ok, on to the food: legitimately the beef rib was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Tender, juicy, tons of flavor. Flintsone sized. It was incredible. I also got a smoked sausage link that was one of the best sausages I've ever had. Spicy, a good bite.

There were maybe 5 tables taken, and it kind of stayed that way until about 7:30pm, but I was a little pissed that we were given the runaround when trying to make reservations. What the fuck guys. I overheard that they had 230 covers for opening night, which seemed a little light to me in a 102 seat restaurant. Even at the end of our meal around 8pm, the place wasn't full yet. Maybe they wanted to limit reservations so they could have a smooth opening night? Who knows?\\n\\nOn to the food! \\n\\nBread service was incredible, which consisted of an \\"everything\\" biscuit, a play on the everything bagel. It. Was. Amazing. The cream cheese they serve with it, as trashy as this sounds, rivals the butter at Texas Roadhouse. Everyone knows Texas Roadhouse and Red Lobster have the best bread, but these biscuits were really transcendent. \\n\\nWe then decided to indulge on a seafood tower for 2. Normally I wouldn't say you should order a seafood tower because they're way overpriced, but I must say, if you were to get a tower at a steakhouse here in the city, make sure it's at American Cut. The shrimp cocktail was awesome and had a real spicy kick to it. The tuna tartare melted in my mouth and was incredibly smooth. The oysters may have been the freshest I've ever tasted, and I've spent the past 5 years in DC where oyster bars are everywhere. \\n\\nFor the main, we went all out and got the Surf N Turf, a 40 ounce tomahawk ribeye and a chili lobster. The ribeye had been dry aged for 30 days, and you definitely can smell the rich funkiness. It had a great char on the outside which gave a beautiful textural contrast to the tenderness of the meat. The chili lobster is a play on the Singaporean dish chili crab, and with my first bite I was reminded of all the Asian flavors I grew up with. It was a little sweet, a little tangy, and a little spicy. A great accompaniment to our steak. The beef itself we were told was locally sourced from Revere Meat Company which ages the beef to AC's specifications.\\n\\nFor our sides, we had the pimento mac and cheese and beef fat fries. Solid choices all around. The sides seem to really play on the entire motif of this restaurant, which is a contemporary take on your classic steakhouse. The d√©cor is luxurious and modern, but the feel is that of a classic steakhouse. The sides are also plays on classic steakhouse sides, but with a little twist. You can tell there is a bit of a Southern take on some of the side dishes, with the aforementioned pimento mac and cheese and collard greens. \\n\\nAnd of course, we ordered drinks with our meal. The smoked old fashioned is served tableside, as the manager, Michael, torched a wooden plank and captured the smoke with the glass. A nice touch that adds to the luxurious feel of the restaurant.\\n\\nOur dessert was the pecan slab pie with ice cream, which I believe mixed pecans and chocolate for the filling. We probably should have picked something a little lighter considering the amount of food we ordered. The server overhead that it was my birthday and had the plate decorated, complete with a  candle. \\n\\nMit, who I believe is the guest services manager, came by to talk to us and really made us feel like we were given the VIP treatment. It just so happened to be his birthday as well, and he ordered a round of drinks for all of us. \\n\\nOverall, outside of the reservation issue, we had an outstanding experience at American Cut. I feel like it's the steakhouse where you come to be seen and where high powered businessmen take their clients to close a deal. It's an amazing venue with an amazing staff and we'll definitely be returning in the future."},{"name":"Tang Dynasty","address":"18070 NW Evergreen Pkwy, Unit C","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"4","text":"I'd definitely come here again.

Share if you're looking to load up on sides, but otherwise, get your own. They brought out some very hot fried pickles first. Good sign that everything is made to order. The pickles were okay. I like the fact that they use the small, sliced pickles instead of the giant wedges that are so popular around town. The batter always falls off the wedges, but in this case, the batter was a little too thick so that you ate the whole pickle on bite 1 and then on bite 2, you were left with a thick handful of batter. They were also really salty. Then, the burger arrived well done. Any place advertising gourmet burgers should never serve a well done burger unless the customer begs. It ruins the flavor of the beef. I had hoped that the pulled pork would add some juice back to it, but I couldn't locate any - all I found was barbecue sauce. The Texas toast was buttered nicely, but for a thick burger, toast can't really handle it. It just kind of fell apart. Stick with a bun. Meal completed, at this point we realize that we never received our fries. My friend goes back to the counter and notices them sitting on the pass, where they had no doubt been for awhile. The guy at the counter offers us some \\"to go.\\" My friend states the obvious - no, we just finished eating and fries don't really heat up well the next day. So the guy says he will take care of us next time, wink wink. 1) There probably won't be a next time, and 2) just give us our money back. Are they worried about employees stealing so they can't refund for undelivered food? Typical slacker service. Oh, I forgot to mention that the only seating option is on a screened in porch. It should have been nice in the October weather, but there was an overwhelming stench coming from the trash dumpster nearby. My recommendation is to skip this place. These are $7-8 burgers, and they're simply not worth it. I would expect crappy service and improperly prepared food for a $3 burger, but these guys need to step up their game."},{"name":"Toasted Flats","address":"53 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I was looking for a new place to eat lunch and decided to give Toasted Flats a shot.

I also got to try one of their breakfast sandwiches--the croissant sandwich with egg, sausage and gooey melted cheddar cheese!\\n\\nThe price is very reasonable, considering the size of the portions. The sandwiches, wraps, and salads are all $6.95 or less and there are bentos and specials available as well.  If you want some coffee with your meal, they have a full caf√© menu that is at least $2 cheaper than Starbucks. \\n\\nI just discovered that this mom and pop joint freshly roasts their turkey EVERYDAY!

I'll explain that later\\n\\n| ATMOSPHERE: |    apparently this store took over an old quizno's. they left everything pretty much the same format as your typical quizno's or sandwich shop. there's an open view glass panel that you can look through to see what they're doing, they have the toppings tray behind the glass, which in this case.. they store their alrdy prepped meats; there's also some the chips rack that every quizno's or subway has; they even kept some quizno's signs and artwork.. like the sandwich painting and the sign that hangs \\"mmm toasty\\" (lol weird)\\n\\n| FOOD: |    came here w/ the bf and a friend and we all ordered almost diff. things. the bf ordered the 4.99 platter (3 tacos of your choice, rice, and beans + a drink). I just got 2 single tacos and our friend got 3 single tacos. we all ordered pretty much the same meats tho: lamb, barbacoa (shredded beef/pork), and carne asada (beef).\\n\\nlamb usually has a taste to it, but in this case.. it was hard to distinguish when it came to taste vs. sight. the lamb & the beef both could use some flavor. nothing special about these 2; you would just have to drown then in salsa. the one that we all could agree on that had the most flavor was the barbacoa for sure. it had a sauce that came with it since it looked like it had been stewed. it was soft and not chewy as well. \\n\\nthe size of the $1 tacos are pretty small, but the meat portions are not exactly generous, but just little more than average/decent portion. all tacos come with 2 mini tortillas. there is also a salsa/toppings mini bar to the left of the register. downside is.. there are no labels whatsoever! I had to ask fellow customers what each was and no one knew! so I did what any curious person would do.. I tried them all! I must say that both the green salsas were good. you can't go wrong with some onion and cilantro, but there were these huge looking jalape√±o that caught my attention.. and the fact that they looked pickled was a bonus. OMG! those are to die for! they were so yummy and sooo freakin' spicy. so good and spicy that it hurts to eat, but you just can't stop. \\n\\n| PRICING: |    soo here's the part that upset me the most.. or even disappointed me. the tacos were $1 and the platter was 4.99. I only ordered 2 tacos, which shoulda been 2 bucks plus the 4.99 for the platter. instead, on my ticket.. she charged me an extra .40 cents (not including tax). I looked thoroughly through their menu to see what this .40 cents was but it was nowhere to be found. wtf? I was so confused/upset/disappointed that I didn't wanna even argue.

Since we were here for HH, I'm not sure if this changes during regular business hours...if so, I probably wouldn't order these items at full price. \\n\\nThe sashimi pieces on the rainbow roll were extremely thin-- I'd compare it to the thickness of 2 quarters stacked ontop of one another.

This \\"business\\" prides itself on shady transactions and lies.  I'm an active duty service member currently on transition to an assignment that will place my family and I overseas.  My spouse initially scheduled an appointment with National Carpet Care Inc. to fix a small patch of carpet.  As you can read in other reviews, they started with their Modus Operandi of a false quote of $70.  In less than four hours of scheduling the appointment, we found out we couldn't use this company (probably because of their terrible service) in order to close out our lease for this PCS.  So when my spouse called to cancel the appointment , the \\"receptionist\\" said they would have to charge a $25 cancellation fee for holding the appointment that was over ten days away.  She said that they book quickly during the holidays.  I told her if they book so quickly, then they shouldn't have a problem getting the slot filled since it was so late down the road.  They did not inform us there would be a cancellation fee if we scheduled the appointment.  After a short phone conversation with this same \\"receptionist,\\"  she told me she would try to work it out and call me back next day.  The next day, she did not call me back; instead, I called her.  On the first phone call, I was introduced back to middle school where they pretend they can't hear you, then she hung up on me.  Imagine the fury that provoked?  So I call back a second time, and she pretends she doesn't know who I am and I needed to \\"refresh her memory.\\"  That's pretty bad considering she was supposed to call me!

One night, I dunno, I just felt like driving over and seeing what it was all about. Full disclosure: I'm not much of a casino person. I'm the type of person who likes to go every once in a great while, put $20 in a slot machine, and play until I go broke. I've been to Vegas and to Native American casinos in California, though, and I still feel like the one in Columbus is sub-par.\\n\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n- The gift shop. I know, that's a bizarre pro, but it was full of inexpensive but cute gifty things. I almost bought stuff. I might actually go back sometime just to go to the gift shop and poke around without my husband impatiently waiting for me to get finished looking.\\n\\n- Um. It's new? And still shiny?\\n\\n- If you smoke, there are smoking rooms, so you don't have to go stand outside like a trashy person. That was nice.\\n\\n- Ample parking!\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Slots sucked. They really did. If you play a slot machine with decent odds, you can keep going on a small amount of money for awhile.. you don't expect to WIN, but you win enough to keep playing for awhile, which is really the fun part. Yeah, not here. These slots just eat your money, which makes the whole experience really boring. It deprives you of both the pleasure of winning (no matter how small the win) and the excitement of anticipation of winning, since you know you're probably not gonna.\\n\\n- It's kind of small. I know that sounds weird, since it's in that huge building, but for a casino, it's not that big. \\n\\n- Buffet was closed at what seemed like a pretty early hour, so we didn't even get to see if we wanted to go. It seemed weird that it would already be closed before 10pm, especially in a building full of people who probably like to eat.\\n\\n- Location. The only reason I ever hit the west side is to eat Mexican food. I'll make the drive for that, but not for the casino.\\n\\n\\nOverall, not my thing. I guess if you have enough cash to lay down at the tables, and you're a card game kind of person, this might be more your venue. If you're like me, a casual who just likes to play a bit but not sink ungodly amounts of money into it, it's not worth a trip."},{"name":"Pizza Caboose","address":"11670 SW Pacific Hwy","city":"Tigard","stars":"4","text":"My wife is gluten free so pizza caboose is a very good pics place for that.

I do not have a ton of experience with Indian food, so a buffet is ideal! I'm also not a vegetarian, but eating meat that I am unsure of is off-putting to me, so this particular buffet was perfect.  I can't even tell you exactly what all I had, mostly because of the sheer amount I ate, but literally everything I had was delicious. I still prefer the naan at Indian Oven over any I've ever had anywhere else, but it was still quite tasty! Plus they bring it to your table on buffet nights, so don't stress when you can't find it in the line. \\nAlso, a big thanks to them for being so accommodating with our larger group with 2 kiddos and bringing our own birthday cake in. They were friendly and quick to help! \\nThe only reasons they aren't getting my 5th star today would be for overall cleanliness/atmosphere and maybe a little slow to come back around and fill waters and ask for drink orders.

Sushi. Coming soon. That's even better than what I was planning to find. I'm so there.\\n\\nRishi had their grand opening last night, and I came in for lunch today. It's a beautiful space, very classy. They do sushi, yes, but also ramen and Asian-inspired burgers. I was here, of course, for the sushi. \\n\\nThe hostess asked if I had a preference between the sushi bar or a table. I didn't, so she went sushi bar. It's their first lunch open, so while it was pretty empty at 11am, they probably couldn't know how busy they'd get in an hour or two. The sushi chefs said hi as I sat down, and my server Phil was over very soon to give me a rundown on the restaurant: they get fish in three times a week, so it's very fresh; the ramen is made with a two-day preparation process (that means nothing to me, maybe it does to more frequent ramen eaters); and baked goods come locally from the Angry Baker.\\n\\nI decided to go simple and just order the Sushi Lunch, which is a tuna roll and five pieces of nigiri. I got a seaweed salad starter and a cup of hot tea.\\n\\nThe tea came with two tea bag options, genmaicha and sencha, both green types, from a brand I hadn't tried before. The genmaicha was good, and Phil was attentive with the extra hot water when I got close to the bottom of the cup.\\n\\nThe seaweed salad was tasty, with grapes mixed in.\\n\\nThe sushi was definitely worth coming here for. There is an extensive list of specialty rolls I look forward to trying, but for today I was content with the basic lunch. The fish was definitely fresh, and the salmon in particular felt like silk in my mouth. While the sushi chef was preparing it, he asked me over the counter whether I wanted wasabi inside the nigiri. This made me happy -- so many places in Columbus just put it in, and I'm not a huge wasabi fan -- I said no, I'd prefer it just on the side, and thanked him for asking. He said it is normally put in there; I don't know if folks sitting at tables would end up getting the same offer/question.\\n\\nMid-meal, Phil came over to check on me and asked if I needed anything else. Actually, yeah... the lunch was supposed to come with miso soup, I thought? He looked upset with himself, apologetic: You're right, he said, it was, and he had forgotten to mention that they didn't have the miso in yet. It was his fault, and he'd see if there was anything else he could get me. A minute later he offered salad, which sounded fine to me. Brand new place, there was bound to be a slip-up, and this was it, but the handling is what matters, and that was hitchless.\\n\\n\\"Servers,\\" said the sushi chef to me jokingly with a wink when he walked away.\\n\\nThe salad was a simple one with a very nice dressing. I'd have preferred it before the sushi, and it was a little redundant since I'd had the seaweed salad, but it was an appreciated consolation for the missing soup. I look forward to having that soup next time!\\n\\nThe location is split into several spaces: the sushi bar, the booze bar, and two table seating areas, one on the main floor and another up the stairs to a loft-type area. The decor is chic and modern, and there is a large flat-screen TV on the wall behind the sushi bar, tuned to Fox Sports while I was there (boxing and then poker were on). Everyone I interacted with was super-friendly and interested in providing a good meal and experience. I can't wait to be back."},{"name":"Floataway Cafe","address":"1123 Zonolite Rd NE, Ste 15","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"My husband is a great home cook. When I go to a restaurant like Float Away cafe, that is, to a restaurant of this reputation and caliber, I expect that things will have sophisticated technique, top-notch quality ingredients, and/or surprising taste and flavor combinations that will go beyond the capacities of a good home cook. I expect to remember at least one dish I had at such a restaurant as \\"Wow. That was amazing.\\" When I go to a restaurant and pay $25-35/dish, I expect there to be something that simply cannot be replicated at home; we are paying for the chef's talent and creativity, after all. I must say that I was very disappointed at Floataway.\\n\\nWe had five dishes and only one was passable. We started with an asparagus and ramp salad served with shaved parmesan, and tuna crudo in olive oil with blood oranges and nicoise olives. The salad was nice and the highlight of the whole affair, but simply because of its fresh ingredients (read: it did not blow our minds, though I will recreate it at home when I get ramps). Tuna was simply soaked in olive oil and taste like mush in olive oil - if it is crudo (meaning, cured not cooked), then please do not drown it in olive oil, we would like the taste and texture of it as crudo. As our main dishes, we had squid ink pasta with san marzano and chili tomato sauce and red snapper with lemon sauce and micro greens. My pasta was a touch too al dente, but the sauce was nice (again, something that relies on simple and fresh ingredients and nothing mind-blowing here). The snapper was once again drenched in oil (it was supposed to be wood oven roasted) but what put it over the top and sealed our decision not to go back there every again was the sauce with which it was served. On the menu, it said \\"red snapper and meyer lemon.\\" We should have asked the waitress what kind of sauce - to her credit she did not explain anything and was weird anyways, more on her below. What was served was oil-drenched tiny half filet of snapper with meyer lemon pie filling or merengue. No, seriously, the sauce was disgusting. It was offensive to anyone who likes food. I really wish that I was the kind of person who can send back a dish, alas, my husband just scraped off the sauce as much as he can and ate his half filet of fish with a bunch of greens - that was $26. We also ordered semolina gnocchi and that was too heavy to be what it said it was. Finally we ordered a trio of gelato and those were nice palate cleansers (close to talenti gelato and sorbets that they sell at Publix) for what was a deeply underwhelming experience, to say the least.\\n\\nI get that the service in these sorts of places are European, meaning that it needs to be relaxed, as opposed to what one gets at a typical American restaurant (getting asked every minute, \\"How is everything? Can I get you something else? How are we doing?etc\\" can be oppressive). However, our waiter did not even tell us about the menu items, did not ask us if we got what we ordered, did not ask how anything was, and never stopped by to ask if we wanted a second and third drink (we had to flag somebody down to get more wine and cocktails each time). As a terrible finish to all this, I asked for the remainder of my pasta to be boxed up, which the waitstaff took away to do so, and then I never saw it again. It was not worth taking home, anyways, so I forgot about it, but still. Service was not even okay. \\n\\nSo, I am still in search for an amazing restaurant in Atlanta. I am okay with Bacchanalia - again, perhaps people go to these places not for the food but just to  pay a lot of money, feel special, and be ignored- but I prefer BoccaLupa lately. If anyone has any suggestions for where to spend my money on great food that is a touch above a good home cook's skills, please let me know."},{"name":"Tucci's Southside Subs","address":"801 E William Cannon Dr, Ste 240","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The guys at the shop, are hands down the best!

Though $8 seems a bit pricey, I know how expensive gluten free baking is and when shared it is much better value. Gluten free baking has such a short shelf life it sometimes can be dry and not quite as good as it looks. However, as we were standing there debating what to get, another customer ordered the Coconut DDL cake and they cut into a brand new whole cake so that sealed the decision for us. There was absolutely nothing dry about this freshly cut cake. Before serving, they sprinkle just a bit of powdered sugar over it and then drizzle a bit of caramel syrup over it.

After over a decade of living in Atlanta, I finally made it to this popular Atlanta establishment.  I'm happy to report I had a good time here.  BTW, If you're wondering who Ron Winans is, he's a gospel singer.\\n\\nThis restaurant is packed on the weekends.  Every time I drive past it, I see throngs of people waiting outside.  The restaurant doesn't have a bar and the waiting room inside is minimal, thus most people end up having to wait outside.  I went on a Thursday around 7pm and it was still busy.  Not as insanely busy as the weekend, but there were still several groups waiting when we arrived.  Luckily, the timing worked out perfectly for us and we were seated right away.\\n\\nThis restaurant is popular with groups of out-of-towners, tourists, and folks from the suburbs coming into the city for \\"a night on the town\\" (e.g. going to see a show at the Fox down the road).  Seating inside consists mostly of booths and the walls are covered with framed photos of various celebrities (actors, musicians) and athletes who have dined here.  There are a couple TVs and a few high top tables in the back.  At the front, you can buy souvenirs like Gladys Knight-branded t-shirts, hats, and aprons.\\n\\nThe menu is Southern all-around, from catfish to collard greens.  Most entrees top off around $15.  I tried the following:\\n\\nMidnight Train ($10.50) - four fried chicken wings and one waffle\\nSmothered Chicken ($14.25) - chicken breast smothered in gravy and served over a bed of white rice\\nFried Corn - white corn sauteed with jalapenos and red and green peppers\\nMacaroni and Cheese\\n\\nOverall, not bad.  The Midnight Train and Smothered Chicken are two of the most popular items on the menu.\\n\\nI enjoyed the Midnight Train.  It's a really simple dish and not really there for the \\"wow\\" factor.  It's comfort food.  The four wings were large and consistent in size and taste.  The breading wasn't as crispy and crumbly like how it comes on most deep-fried chicken.  The chicken itself was tender and juicy.\\n\\nThe waffle was soft and smooth.  It was served with one small container of light butter and a side of warm syrup.  This dish also came with a small slice of fresh orange.  The Midnight Train really hit the spot and I'd order it again.\\n\\nThe Smothered Chicken was so-so.  The homemade gravy was OK, but I don't think they put enough on the chicken breast.  I had to pour on Texas Pete Hot Sauce, Pepper Sauce, and ketchup to make the meat and rice tastier.  Portion size was good, though.  This dish also came with cornbread.\\n\\nI couldn't tell if the Fried Corn was fried or not.  The kernels were slightly firmer and crispier than boiled corn.  There was also some extra flavoring thanks to the peppers, but still generally a very plain side.  The Mac and Cheese was great.  Small noodles, lots of cheese (mostly hardened), and not too oily.\\n\\nService was excellent from the hostess to the staff who brought out the food from the kitchen.  Our server was Claud and he did a terrific job taking care of us.  I like how he brought us moist towelettes after our meal to clean our greasy fingers.  Our dishes were made-to-order and didn't take long to hit the table.\\n\\nThere are about 30 free parking spots located directly behind the restaurant.  The entrance for this parking lot is on Courtland Street.  It's a one-way street, so you may have to do some circling to get there.  There's a small Gladys Knight sign at the entrance to the lot and each of the spots is clearly marked with red paint.  The parking lot is narrow, has pot holes, and looks sketchy, but the surrounding pay lots ($3+) aren't any better or that much closer.\\n\\nIn summary, 3 stars for the food + 1 star for the service and novelty of the place."},{"name":"Veggie Galaxy","address":"450 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"The food here is consistently amazing, the service is top notch, and the prices and selection are awesome!

I came in with a party of 16 people on a Sunday night for dinner. Service was curt which is somewhat to be expected but what ensued was rather disappointing.\\nMy table ordered geoduck - which was shown to me prior to cooking. These were massive but what was served to us looked like only half of what was shown. I asked the waiter and he was curt and said \\"that's just how it is!!\\" However, when I'm paying $20/lb I expect to be served what I was shown/ordered. Despite the kitchen denying it, I later hear a waiter yelling at the kitchen in Cantonese about how they treat customers badly and rip people off since table ordered 4 twin lobsters and only received 4 claws when they should've received 8 (each lobster has 2). Sketchy business practices in my book.\\n\\nWhen the check came, my party was in a group to leave so I looked at the bill and did mental match which seemed right at the time, but I got home and redid the math after looking at a menu and they charged us $10 more than what our total actually was! SMH If you really thought we were going to tip poorly, you deal with it. But don't add EXTRA to our bill.\\nThe last straw, our group was all Asian and we love our red bean soup dessert. Seeing them tote bowls around to other tables earlier, I was excited they had some that night since it's not always available. It's time for our dessert and they give us a bowl of fortune cookies -____- I had to yell at them for them to give us our tong shui. Like really???

The olives and the cheese were delicious, I would not recommend the risotto balls. I'm a vegetarian, but my friends said that the proscuitto was nothing special. \\n\\nOne thing I really liked was that we were never rushed during our meal. I hate it when they come and try to take away your plate when you put your fork down to take a sip of water. Not here. They waited until we had eaten everything off of our plates and were sitting back chatting before they cleared the table and brought our entrees.\\n\\nI ordered the pumpkin gnocchi with butter, walnuts and sage. I was blown away by the flavors. I had already read some reviews before going, so I wasn't surprised about the small portion. I think it was the perfect amount for me, and left just enough room for dessert. If you're really hungry try getting something like the risotto. It comes in a bigger portion. Once again, our server waited until everyone was finished eating before she came and collected our plates. \\n\\nFor dessert I had the Strawberry Millefeuille and a cappuccino. If there's one thing Bin 26 Enoteca is good at, then it's the presentation. Mind-blowing. Unfortunately it was impossible to eat the millefeuille without destroying the beautiful set up first. The coffee was delicious, best coffee I have had in a long time.

For one, this particular Tapatia makes their own tortillas that are so good you could eat a few of them plain. Throw meat and cheese in them, and you've got yourself a meal.\\n\\nThe Tapatia on 183 reminds me of this place. Great food, friendly service, and a typical relaxing hole-in-the-wall atmosphere that makes me very comfortable to sit back with my belly full as I polish off the rest of my unsweetened iced tea.\\n\\nThere is, however, a Taqueria Tapatia over on Tech Ridge that isn't quite up to par. I don't think they make their own toritallas and the food just does not seem like the same recipe at a few of the other, older establishments I have been to. I'd go as far as to say they are not related because of the difference in the quality of the food. The carne guisada at the very least is a completely different animal. \\n\\nWhat struck up the conversation with drive-through-girl was the fact that I was living in Houston at the time and having eaten at a Tapatia there, I was thoroughly disappointed. I had to ask her why the disparity and she obliged with this story about her family.\\n\\nWhen I see a new one somewhere, or at least new to me, I have to try it. Jalisco style Mexican Cuisine is great food, and especially good for growing kids.

The portions of chicken are generous, and it's a battle if you intend to finish your whole meal.  My other favorite dish is their Drunken Noodles, a dish I'm yet to find another Thai joint to come close to mimicking.  The Drunken Noodles are huge flat noodles, balanced well with the well sized whole vegetables and chicken.  The spicy basil sauce is delish - firey hot, with just the perfect bit of sweetness.  I generally try to find someone to split the Pad Thai and Drunken Noodles with, as it's a perfect combo.\\n\\nI've also had some of the salads, particularly the Larb Kai and Yum Woon Sen.

I think the only shortfall was in the appetizers (those little plates of who knows  what that you always get when eating at a Korean restaurant).  The places I have frequented in NYC give you much more, both in terms of amount and with respect to variety, and they replenish them when you are done without request.

Thus I am going to accord you, not one, but 2 different types of reviews.\\n\\n(My main reason for three stars: overpriced.)\\n\\n1. The lunch review: mwwwwah. My girlfriend had to drive around the block several times to find a parking spot, and she was quite aggravated by the time she landed for lunch because it was cutting into her lunch time. (Where's the parking garage, somebody? I can walk over so I have no idea.) Then, she also has to (and I really mean must) eat gluten-free. After checking more than a few times with staff if the burgerbun was gluten-free, she went for that option. The luncheon food for both of us was alright, nothing special--my salad was big but I missed a 'secret ingredient' (think Po). However, the following day she called me and said she had been quite ill--you know where this is going--due to the not-up-to-par bun. I believe she even called the manager. I know I told her to. A long time ago (over a year) I treated my daughter-in-law to lunch, and my fries were not crispy, blgggh, and I remembered thinking, what's all the hype about? If a restaurant wants to earn 4 or more stars from me, it shines a bit more in all different areas. \\n\\n2. Drinks review: I went with another girlfriend because we wanted to hang out in Portland. It was very noisy (and warm) inside, and the atmosphere was lively and hopping. People were playing pingpong in the corner, so for me it was a bit busy--I'm too ADD for that as a background event. Our bartender made our drinks and I am no expert, mine was the special (substitute something sweet here). They were fairly expensive. Unfortunately, I am the kind of person who has to drink good quality booze and (heads-up) this one left me with a headache the next morning (I know, after just one drink). Our evening consisted of us waiting outside till a table freed up where we sat and talked. If we had had enough friends with us, we could have fit 6 at the table. \\n\\nI have just not been impressed."},{"name":"Mamma Maria","address":"3 North Sq","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This is some of the best italian food I've ever had.

First of all, the service was very effective and fast, and the staff very warm and friendly, so that is a plus. We had food to go, I ordered green curry with prawns, because it is one of my favorites, my friend had a yellow curry dish with chicken. The taste was very good, and fresh, the perfect combination of ingredients, except it was on the salty side. Green curry is already spicy on its own, then with some extra salt, it can be a bit overwhelming. My friend's curry was also very salty. So it'd be good if they could use much less salt in the food in general. One thing I was not happy about was the green curry was too liquid, the consistency was more like a soup and the bad part was there was not much food in it, either of veggies nor the shrimp. I was able to find only few shrimp in it and even the bamboo and the eggplants pieces were like invisible, so no much to chew, but lots of liquid. I am putting an extra star only because there was real, fresh baby coconut meat in it, so that was a plus too, on the other hand it was not enough either, so overall it was a an extremely small portion, not even enough for a small kid, and with way too small amount of veggies /shrimp"},{"name":"Shula's 347 Grill - Lake Mary","address":"2974 International Pkwy","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"3.5","text":"Recently went for lunch with some co-workers and was very pleased.

I visited back in September for the first time with 3 out of town guests. We went on a Sunday night around 6.  The wait was over an hour.  There is hardly any inside waiting room, so basically out have to wait outside on the sidewalk.  And, if you aren't familiar with this area of town, it isn't the safest.  There was a cop stationed inside the restaurant, and he had to keep running off a rowdy man trying to annoy customers. We were finally seated, and our waiter was less than enthusiastic.  I get it, it is Sunday night and closing is not too far away, but at least let your table know you are able to preform your job.  I ordered their \\"signature\\" waffle.  Basically just a plain waffle with a little cinnamon mixed in the batter.  It was average, but I was more thrilled with my Waffle House waffle.  One guest ordered the fried chicken and he said it was an average piece of chicken, nothing special.  One guest got a salad with grilled chicken.  The other guest got shrimp and grits.  Basically it was literally a bowl of grits with a few shrimp on top and a few bites of bacon.  I was expecting more out of the atmosphere and food based on all of the hype I had read/heard.

On my birthday last November, I had a dinner which completed my journey: I have eaten the entire vegan menu, sans beverages. The following is the culmination of my visits:\\n\\nBoth veggie burgers are fantastic, but the black bean does need some more of a binding ingredient. Inman Square is probably my favorite, but I admit a bias since I live there.\\n\\nBeer-battered tofu is the best entree. Thick slices of a (presumably) deep-fried tofu with outstandingly seasoned fries makes this THE entree to order. The tofu is so good, and while its oddly placed, reminds me of fried bologna I had when younger. Sounds weird to be appealing, but its fantastic.\\n\\nI'd say skip the open-faced sandwich, because its a highly variable order. Sometimes its fine, other times it looks like a giant pile of different colored gravies dumped on top of each other. Tastes fine, don't get me wrong, but looks rather gross.\\n\\nVegan eggs benedict is FANTASTIC. I don't understand what it is or how it tastes that good, but treat yo'self. In fact, all the breakfasts options are good. I used to think I didn't like breakfast after years of not being able to order it, but have now seen the light. Stuffed french toast. Do it.\\n\\nEvery dessert has been great. Boston creme was a bit plain, but still good. Lastly, and perhaps equally important to the food quality, is the service. Most of the servers know to bring my drink of choice the minute I walk in, and even the one server I'm a bit apprehensive to get is still great at her job. \\n\\nI'm almost sad that I've finished this gluttonous mission, but they revamped their menu to feature a rotating vegetable entree and seitan entree of the week.

Presumably, it was failing economically due to the massive space and mobs of college students spending $5 for a tea and occupying a seat for 3-8 hours. \\n\\nThe space is beautiful, and MASSIVE - a space this size isn't really super conducive to a coffee/tea house. Hard to monetize a space that big without consistent table turns and you run the risk of seat takers costing a lot per square foot. So, someone (presumably in Japan - the location of the ownership company) decided to retool the place to correct this economic issue. It feels like someone making decisions off of a spreadsheet of economic data and making more bad decisions. \\n\\nNow you walk in and there's a host. You either decide to go to the cafe side (which is exactly the same) or you can be seated for full service. \\n\\nRather than just a sign directing you one way or the other (ie. left for cafe, right for restaurant) there's a confused host who asks every person what they are there for. Awkward, at best. The cafe sort of wraps around the roped off restaurant area and, as other reviews have detailed, there's a new manager who was clearly told to forcibly turn tables to improve profit. \\n\\nThe issue is that there's no cafe ever that forces you to leave. It's why people are having such a guttural reaction to the manager. They are visibly prioritizing profit over customer experience. That won't fly. \\n\\nI suspect, unless they retool AGAIN, this place is going out of business shortly."},{"name":"Hanabi","address":"2525 W Anderson Ln, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"HARU is an amazing place!!

The restaurant says it opens at 11:30am and we got there at approximately 11:40am. The sign read \\"closed\\" but the door was open so we went in. A waiter from the back came up and told us we weren't open just yet, we apologized and told him we saw online that you open at 11:30am so he looked down at his watch and replied, \\"oh, yea I guess we are.\\" He seated us in a booth and told us our waitress would be right with us.\\n\\nAs my friend and I were catching up, a waitress came up to our table and she seemed slightly annoyed or irritated. She did greet us with a smile but it faded fast as she listed the specials as well as what the restaurant was out of, which seemed like a lot! We ordered waters and coffee and when she returned with them and asked if we were ready to order, we told her we weren't so she - again acting irritable - walked to the back kitchen area. When she came back again to check, we were ready and I told her I wanted a lunch plate that had chicken and she bluntly replied, \\"we're out of chicken\\"...oook. So I ordered the beef stroganoff instead. We were given bread to snack on before our entrees arrived and when we asked for a second basket of bread, she sighed and went to get us bread. Wow..sorry to ask so much.\\n\\nWhen our entree's arrived, the portions were large, the plates were hot, and it tasted delicious! There was noodles, beef stroganoff, and cooked asparagus in some kind of sauce - soooo good! She checked in on us once and refilled our waters while we ate. After lunch we both felt like dessert so we ordered the chocolate foam, vanilla ice cream, espresso, and kahlua dessert to split- SO yummy! I highly recommend getting this dessert. After dessert she dropped by our check and we paid. She picked it up and we didn't see her again. We got up, walked out the door, and no sign of our waitress.\\n\\nRECAP - I really enjoyed the food - it was delicious and I'm glad we went but the service could be much better! The staff should know and be ready for when the restaurant opens and I shouldn't feel like I'm bugging the wait staff by being there and giving them business.

About an hour\\" so I begrudgingly said \\" Thanks\\" and walked out. This interaction took about two minutes that he could have been using to serve other patrons, several of which were out of coffee or water trying to get his attention behind us while he razzed me like a smug idiot. I also witnessed him do a similar thing to another patron. He came out and called the name \\" Joe\\" Joe said that's me and then the waiter proceeded to ask Joe another 7 times if he was Joe.

It's the worst IHOP I have I've ever eaten in! Let me tell you what I've tried -\\n1. An omelette with several ingredients, one of which was cheese. Don't be fooled. The cheese is not inside the omelette holding all those veggies together. It's on top and it's semi frozen. The veggies are just in there, trying to fall out dry. Yuck.\\n2. The pancakes are as bland as any pancake you'll ever get. I could do better with an Aunt Jemima mix. If you're lucky, it's going to be cooked all the way through, otherwise look out for that gooey stuff in the middle.\\n3. I ordered bacon extra crispy. Exactly 1/2 of the bacon was burned black, the other half was transparent with fat.\\n4. Those beautiful pancake toppings that they show on TV are just thick jam. Sometimes you think you might hit a strawberry, but it's been marinating in sugar and you can tell. So-I asked for frozen strawberries instead.  They didn't have any. The blueberry topping is really \\"blueberry compote\\".  Nothing but sugar in there either. They do say they have fresh bananas - but the ones I saw were so over ripe, I passed. \\n5. I ordered an egg dish with the eggs over medium. I explained that I did not want the whites to be runny. They brought me eggs that were over-light and were really runny. When I sent them back they said I should have ordered them \\"over-well\\". Yep- choose runny or choose hard, nothing in between.  A cook that can't cook an egg, shouldn't work at IHOP.\\n6. I ordered cottage cheese to put in my cheese blintzes because the goop that was inside there was like frosting - way too sweet They don't have cottage cheese \\"anymore\\". \\n7. Those \\"golden brown hash browns\\" are just frozen shredded potatoes with a little bit of crunch on the top. It's pretty typical for a greasy spoon, but certainly not as described. \\n8. The service is OK, and if you  complain, they will get you a manager who will promise a free meal the next time you come in.\\nDon't hold your breath.

Have you ever made a burger in your kitchen? If you don't want to wait 20 minutes for an incredible burger head to McDonald's and get a prefrozen, heat-lamp reheated disaster. Otherwise, these burgers are completely worth the wait! The toppings are cooked right in, and then the cheezy goodness oozes out with each bite. YUMMY!\\n2) Popular places in Austin get busy during peak times...especially cool, hip places.\\n3) I've been 4 times and on only one occasion did they not get my order right. It happens, though. And I suspect it's because they are still new and working out the kinks.\\n4) The place is really small, so parking and getting a spot on the patio might be tight during peak times. BUT, call your order in ahead of time, and take the burgers home - they're still excellent!\\n5) Everyone likes their fries different. Personally, I prefer a thicker fry with a crisp outside and soft inside. These fries are very thin and can get limp and soggy very quickly.

Last night was the first time I'd been there in a few months and they've made some improvements which should be mentioned here, since they were well needed.\\n\\n1.) They lowered the price for dinner so it's now $19.95 per person. It's important since this place isn't worth more than that, and when it was $23, then the tab always went above $50 after tax and tip.  Paying $50 for 2 people seems a psychological barrier that I couldnt get past usually.\\n\\n2.) new menus. same items, but suggests maybe new owners, or owners taking more of an interest?\\n\\n3.) They got rid of the ice cream/dessert bar, which frankly, was disgusting. The ice cream always had freezer burn and jello for dessert from a buffet line just does not work.  Unfortunately, they didnt replace it with anything, but at least they got rid of it.\\n\\n4.) They've added an additional chicken choice - garlic chicken.  They used to only offer chicken wrapped in bacon and the bacon for whatever reason never got cooked on the part touching the chicken, which made it somewhat unappetizing.  Nice to know I have a choice now.\\n\\n5.) They added signs above the food items at the buffet.  \\n\\nNow, for the downsides.  It's still impossible to get a waiter after you sit down, so you have to make sure you get everything you need up front.  There's a reason a lot of people ask for a pitcher of water - because they know the waiter will NEVER be back to fill your water glass, and if you eat anything spicy, then you're screwed.  It's also a nightmare trying to get the check because you've got to chase the waitstaff down.  If you get them the first time to give you the check, then its another nightmare getting them to pick up your credit card.\\n\\nAlso, the buffet options are not great.  They only have about 10 choices in the hot bar, and 1 is always white rice, 1 is pork and beans (or whatever that dish is called), 1 is plantains, 1 is french fries. And well, the buffet is just mediocre.  Every once in a while you get lucky that they have something good there.\\n\\nhmm.. so why do I go?  Well, first, I like the CONCEPT of rodizio and sadly, this is the best option in boston.  Been to the others.  Sigh.  Surely someone can come to Boston and do a better job than this. \\n\\nI WISH they would offer some additional options for the skewers of meat they bring around - like fish or shrimp.  Would that be so hard?  I don't eat red meat so even though my friends do, we don't come here often because I'm not in the mood to pay so much to eat a few chunks of chicken breast.\\n\\nThe BEST thing about Midwest is their hot sauce.  It is craving worthy.  Just the best hot sauce anywhere.  Home made.  VERY HOT (which is why you need someone to refill your water).  Delicious.  On meat. On french fries.  On the fried chicken nuggets they sometimes have.  And then mix that with potato salad to cool off your mouth, well, it's heaven.  Best Hot Sauce anywhere, for those who love hot sauce.  Basically oil with whole jalapeno and garlic cloves added, where it marinates for weeks.\\n\\nI will give anyone who intends to go that you do need to plan accordingly.  You want to go on nights when there is going to be at least a little crowd.  Otherwise, the meat sits on the rotisserie and sits and sits and sits until it is burnt to a crisp.  You also don't want to go until the second wave of people.  The first wave before 7pm usually eat the meat that's been cooking all day. \\n\\nIf the owners read this then here's my advice: improve the buffet, add additional choices (you have the space now that the dessert bar is gone), add more variety for the folks who get dragged here by their carnivores friends (they wont argue so vociferously about coming), and have a busboy walking constantly around the place filling water glasses."},{"name":"Tom, Dick & Hank","address":"191 Ralph David Abernathy Blvd SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Me and the guys from work had a place we visited pretty regular.

I will say that parking is tough even on slower days.  You need to be creative or know the area enough to find a spot.   I like to think I am creative and know the area therefore I found parking right away.  ;-) \\nI think TD&H has been open for approx 8 months or so.  It is small inside so I can see where seating could be a problem on busy days. \\nFirst impression is nice atmosphere.  The music was a little too loud for me.  I don't necessary like hip hop but I don't hate it either so at a reasonable volume I'm good.  \\nThe bar tender was very nice and greeted us early.  She has our drinks out right away and makes a good Jack & Coke.  The beer bottles are cold !  After we received our drinks it seems as though we were placed on the back burner for about 5 minutes.  Two carry out customers came in and they both got the attention of bartender before she took our order.  We were there first and thought that she could easily just take our order before checking them out so that the kitchen could get started on our food.   Anyway... That is just my idea as the customer who has limited time for lunch. \\nWe still got our food relatively quick.  I ordered the BBQ Pork plate with Grilled Zucchini / Squash and fries.  I had a choice of potato roll or cornbread muffin.  I chose the potato roll but last minute I was told they were out so I settle for cornbread muffin which I was not a fan of.  The pork was good.  It was moist and had extra BBQ sauce just like I asked for.  I believe the BBQ sauce to be store bought not homemade.  It was pretty good though.  The grilled Zucchini / squash was AWESOME.  Probably the best thing on the plate.  The fries were cooked fresh and were good as well. \\nThe guy I was with had the friend shrimp plate with fries and side salad.  The shrimp were huge and he said they were delicious.  There was another customer sitting two seats down from us at the bar who had crab legs that were MEGA HUGE !! \\nAnyway.. Overall if I could break the stars down a little more it would receive a 3.5 stars.

These beers include Sam Adams and Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR)\\n\\nThe pizza they serve was probably one of the thinnest pizzas I have eaten, but the chunks of meat are fairly thick and meaty though for a pizza topping, so that's a plus, but I found the crusts just average.

That's not their slogan, but it should be (for a price). My boss, myself and several of my coworkers decided to test that theory. Was our meeting a success? That's privileged information. But, were the milkshakes praise worthy? Read the rest of the review, slacker.\\n\\nWord of advice, don't judge this trailer by its rapist look. Note to the Owners: The trail of action figures leading up to your order window isn't helping your cause. Unless you want to be legally obligated to introduce yourself to the neighbors, I'd recommend altering your \\"To Catch A Predator\\" exterior. (In case you don't watch Dateline: www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGYYMFyI_ag. Side Note: Do yourself a favor and read the comments.)\\n\\nBut enough about Rapeshakes', I'm sorry, Handshakes' appearance. Let's talk about the sweet treats that will keep the kiddies coming back for more once they OFFICIALLY open in mid-November. \\n\\nThe first shake we tried was an unusual concoction called The Corn Shake. Actually, I don't know if that's what they're going to call it, but it was a milkshake and it did contain corn. The name is irrelevant. What matters is it was weird and free, which is good enough for me. My only complaint about the Corn Shake is my tongue couldn't reach the bottom of the sample cup. It tasted just like a hoity-toity soup I once ate at a fine-dining establishment in San Francisco, minus the elegant dinnerware and a dollop of cr√®me fraiche. If they do add it to the menu, they'll be seeing me again soon.\\n\\nOnce the free samples stopped flowing it was time to order our actual shakes. I had my sights set on The Panshake (I'm a sucker for strange) until the lady behind the blender mentioned their shake du jour, The Banana Pudding. My grandmother would have rolled over in her bed if I passed up that Bible Belt delicacy. (I would have said grave, but she's still alive.) Thank the Confederacy I didn't! The BP was my favorite Handshake, hands down. It was as smooth and banana filled as its namesake, but cold and slurpable like a milkshake. You could even detect Nilla wafers, which is odd, because I didn't see any cookie crumbles. Regardless, I know they were in there. If only in spirit, they were there.\\n\\nThe other shakes I sampled included the Grave Digger (Cookies & Cream), the Good Morning (Oatmeal, vanilla and Cinnamon), the Shake-O-Lantern (Pumpkin Pie) and of course, the Panshake (Pancake). \\n\\nThe Grave Digger was good, but it was no better than Chick-Fil-A's Cookie's & Cream shake. Just to clarify, I put Chick-Fil-A's shakes on par with almost every ice-cream joint I've ever indulged in. \\n\\nThe marquee ingredients of the Good Morning were overpowered by an abundance of milk and a shortage of shake. I recommend they substitute the cinnamon for cinnamon sugar and try cooking the oatmeal before throwing it in the blender? After it cools down, of course. \\n\\nThe Shake-O-Lantern surpassed Sonic's Pumpkin Pie Shake thanks to the apropos pumpkin seeds sprinkled on top. Again, comparing Handshakes to a fast-food chain isn't an insult. Sonic is a formidable opponent in the dessert department.\\n\\nLastly, the Panshake. As much as I wanted to love this trademarked item, I'm afraid it's one of those cases where novelty outweighs quality. Although it tastes as good as a pancake and syrup should, the texture was like a mama bird had chewed and spewed a flapjack into my gullet. If it were blended a little finer, I'd be fine with it. As it stands, I prefer my pancakes on a plate. \\n\\nI think Handshake's biggest asset is their creativity. As long as they keep experimenting with offerings like the Corn Shake, the Banana Pudding and a better-executed Panshake, I see them standing out in Austin's overcrowded ice cream market for reasons other than their Rapemobile."},{"name":"Thai Bloom","address":"3800 SW Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"We stopped in at Thai Bloom while we were in town looking for a new home a few weeks ago.

I'm not a big fried chicken fan. Most times my fam gets the KFC stuff.. if that is really even chicken, I have no clue... \\n\\nBut yeah, never had chicken and waffles. So, when I saw that Ron Winans' of the Winans family owned a Chicken and Waffles Soul Food restaurant with Gladys Knight, I just had to eat there! \\n\\nSo we made our way to the restaurant, paid $3 parking at the old skool parking cash box. (Yes, they do monitor it and ticket if they don't see you putting money in there.) \\n\\nChecked in, and learned it was going to be a 45 min to an hour wait \\"or less,\\" said the waitress. \\"Or less?\\" I asked. \\"Yes, we have a separate seating system for groups of 6, so you might get your seats earlier than that.\\"\\n\\nNope. Not that day. It was Mothers Day, so everyone wanted to treat mama to some soul food. I get it, nobody wanted to cook that day. And this restaurant was a really popular place. \\n\\nWhich meant 45 min to an hour turned into One-And-A-Half-Hour. Yes, sir. Hella long. I should have brought a portable DVD player. I'm sure my son could have caught up on 4 1/2 episodes of AstroBoy in that time. Lol. \\n\\nWhen we finally were seated, we had a really friendly and helpful server, but it seems our orders kept getting mixed up. \\n\\nFirst with the drinks. They gave me my friend's strawberry drink, then sent it back to the kitchen and came out with my Uptown drink.

They charged my order with my friend's extra chicken strips, and then forgot to make our fried green tomatoes even though we had already paid for them.\\n\\n:: sigh :: \\n\\nOn Sundays, the restaurant stops taking new customers at 7:15, but if you are lucky to make it in, you get to stay and eat. \\n\\nNow, this is easily a 2 star review if you don't count the quality of the food, but I don't remember having fried chicken that good! We ordered the Midnight Train which was chicken and waffles. The chicken was not heavily oiled or greasy, lightly crispy and wonderfully moist and hot inside. The pecan waffles were pretty good. \\n\\nAnd the fried green tomatoes were delicious. A bit saltier than the kind that I usually get from Secret Garden Cafe in Jville, but I really enjoyed the slightly sour green tomatoes inside with the lightly salty batter outside. \\n\\nThe best part was the free dessert for my son's birthday. They don't sing here (sad face...) but they pipe Gladys Knight singing Happy Birthday on the speakers. The dessert was a slice of sweet potato cheesecake. drizzled with caramel and topped with pecans and whipped cream. Simply wonderful. \\n\\nAs for drinks, you simply HAVE to get the Uptown. It's a sweet tea and lemonade fused together. Just the right balance of sweet and tartness. I'm salivating thinking about it. \\n\\nAs for ambiance, it includes photos on the wall of celebs who have eaten here (such as John Legend), and some shoes worn by Gladys Knight. \\n\\nDisneyland-style wait, 1 star\\nFood, 4 1/2 stars\\nService, 3 stars\\n\\nShould be a 3 star review, but I was really impressed with the fried chicken, the Uptown, the dessert and fried green tomatoes."},{"name":"Ike's Caf√©","address":"1961 East Mall","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Service is fairly fast.

Located close to the intersection of Orange and Church, Gitto's Pizza is a small hole-in-the-wall pizza place that presents a fun (and tasty) pizza experience day or night.\\n\\nI typically go to Gitto's either for a late night snack or to grab a quick lunch. Regardless of when I seem to go, Gitto's always has a line. Gitto's is set up where 2/3 of the venue is the employee/cooking area while the remaining part is where people wait in line, pick out their pizza, and wait to receive their order. They also have a sitting area upstairs, but I have never actually been up there. The entire area isn't as clean or clean-cut as other pizza areas, but that grime gives it that great New York pizza feeling.\\n\\nOnce you get to the front of the line, the cashier will ask if you want a slice or a full pizza. Gitto's has a wide range of pre-made pizzas for ordering slices. I usually get 1 or 2 Hawaiian slices (which usually comes to around $5). After placing my order, an employee grabs your slice, puts a delicious piece of garlic bread with it, and throws it in the oven to heat it up for about 5 minutes. Once it is finished, they bag it up and give it to you. While the pizza isn't on the level of the Brick & Fires of the world, the pieces are indeed gigantic, so they make for a great small lunch or a great late-night snack.\\n\\nOverall, Gitto's Pizza is a great downtown pizza place. While it isn't what I describe as a \\"foodie\\" pizza joint, it makes for a tasty treat at a fair price."},{"name":"Tastings - A Wine Experience","address":"958 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Awesome selections, incredibly friendly and knowledgeable staff.

Honestly, I expect everything else on the menu is pretty good, but the \\"pizetta\\" is awful. I suppose they can get away with it being so unlike a true pizza by calling it a \\"pizetta.\\" Auto-correct is trying to feed me \\"pieta\\" by the way which cracks me up! \\n\\nMy 3 cheese \\"pizetta\\" emerged from the kitchen already very dry looking. There was no sauce. It's essentially dried up cheese on a crust. Over the next 10 minutes it just became more arid looking. It was a desert landscape! My friend had the \\"pizetta\\" with chicken which looked a little better to my eyes, but half-way through hers she wanted ranch dressing for dipping. They don't have ranch but some other house specialty and I think she was happy with it. I would have loved some marinara sauce, personally. \\n\\nAnd it's not like I haven't had sauceless pizzas before. Several selections from California Pizza Kitchen come to mind, but none of those were so dry that they hurt going down! \\n\\nSo why the 3 stars? \\n\\n#1 - We ordered the now famous Pop-rocktini.

They also indicated that they were running out of certain food and did not have fruit or salad prepped. So much for any substitute for my toast...  I was worried at first that they literally wouldn't be able to feed us and we'd have to go elsewhere, and this place is definitely off the beaten path. \\n\\nAside from that initial hiccup, my omelette (with spinach, tomato, roasted chicken and brie) was great and my fellow diner's fritatta (with bociccini, tomatoes, basil and pesto) looked amazing.

This place was super busy; I had done a little searching on yelp to find the best spot in the north end I mean there's got to be 50-80 places in that small little area makes it hard to know which one to choose for dinner. This one was one of the highest rated ones on yelp so I figured I was in for a culinary treat.

That's where this review goes south lol I know people will probably say how could you not say this was an incredible \\"authentic Italian\\" food. I felt none of the flavors really blew me away; such as the marinara sauce which being the base of the dish should have some great Italian flavors I got none of that. The pasta was al dente and was cooked perfectly. The meatballs were huge and being another Italian staple should have been another representative of Italian flavor; the overall flavor I tasted was breadcrumbs (flavors of the meat and seasonings didn't really come through). With a name like Sunday macaroni you'd expect rich hearty flavors stick to your ribs meal this wasn't that for me. I didn't really get a lot of  traditional Italian flavors like basil, oregano, or the rich pronounced flavors of tomatoes in the sauce.

The place is small, and the ambience is cute, but it's not relaxing enough that you'd feel like chillin' with a good book or your laptop.  We tried 3 of the 7 flavors on the menu:  Classic, Midnight, and Irapa.  Consensus was that the Classic was very smooth and rich, and the Irapa (made with brown sugar) actually had a hint of white chocolate flavor to it (note that White Chocolate is one of the other flavors on the menu).  The Midnight was indeed a little bitter (as advertised), and you might as well go for the Classic if you are in the mood for a standard hot chocolate taste.

Your order is brought to you, and there are waiters around to collect your dirty dishes so you don't have to put them away yourself.

It did get a bit busy during the afternoon (on a saturday), and the manager (?) came by at some point to ask us if we were done or if we were going to order more food since all our dishes were taken away already - basically rushing us to free up the table. That was kind of annoying.. but I guess most people don't stay for more than 1 or 2 hours at the cafe side? \\n\\nI tried the hojicha latte and daifuku. They were both really good.

And you can try all configuration of the pie but I found at the end of the day, a pepperoni topping with some veggies will give you some flavor. Better yet, their Argentine pie which I believe is made with BBQ sauce is very good. And when their pies are on they're pretty good. But on an off day and the crust is undercooked, they're really off. From the outside, this location looks like it's about to go out of business soon. Once you get in, it's pretty crowded for dinner.

It is inside of Phipps Plaza between The Taven At Phipps and Twist. Literally. So if you aren't coming from the interior of the mall, the most direct route would be to valet in the front of Phipps (facing onto Peachtree) and walk through the main entrance near the Frontgate store. Last night was unusually cold and so it felt great to come from the blustery weather into such an inviting place....\\n\\nI loved the decor and the ambiance. Very chic. The place is small but well laid out, with a more formal looking room to the right and a bar and more casual dining area to the left. \\n\\nThe menu is not very big...I got the distinct impression that this is more of a spot to drink with friends, to see and be seen. My group was able to try a wide variety of plates from the menu. I personally ordered the Beet Salad, which was compact but delicious (but then I have almost never had a beet-and-goat-cheese-combo that I didn't really enjoy). I chose the Bobotie (from the Bunny Chow section of the menu) as my entree and it was an interesting meal -- sweet ground beefy curry inside of a bread bowl and topped with a fried egg. I was curious about this dish after reading another reviewer's comparison to a second-rate sloppy joe. I will say that it was tasty but not delicious. I didn't dislike it but there was nothing about it that felt cohesive to me. The bread tasted fresh and I liked the curry, even though I am not a big fan of sweet & savory meats. The fried egg was unfortunate. I *LOVE* eggs in all their lovely incarnations, but this one was no more refined than an overly-done sunny side up from Waffle House.\\n\\nI asked around...the consensus from the group was that the wine list is awesome (I had the Robertson Special Late Harvest) and the food is pretty good. The french fries and the Mac & Cheese were standouts. Other dishes (Ostrich sliders, Chicken curry) were deemed good but a little on the dry side. \\n\\nThe service was excellent. Our waiter was extra attentive and the manager came over to our table and chatted a couple times (one of our party was somewhat of a regular there). You could definitely tell that this restaurant is new and still very much in that stage of making every effort to please their guests.  \\n\\nWhen the bill came, I was slightly shell-shocked. I had talked through the whole meal and barely touched my Bobotie, so it felt a little extreme to spend around $40 (tip included) for what I had consumed: a glass of wine and a small salad. \\n\\nOverall my experience at Yebo was positive. I think that if they work on refining their existing dishes and thereby bringing the quality of the food up to par with the  decor and service, then they will be on to something.

While this is no Hopdoddy, it's definitely a place worthy of dining.  It's just no frills tasty goodness.  It's also pretty good people watching.  Last time I was here I saw a dude air drumming while walking down the side walks.  I saw him and thought to myself \\"that dude is totally giving zero f*cks right now\\".  I also witnessed a handful of students walking around in the pajamas.  One straight up with some Whataburger in his hands eating while walking.  Once again, completely care free two sh*ts not given.

And since my opinion is shared by 2 other people and because the meal was pricey, I'm going to cover EVERYTHING. Normally, I'd just bring up the food, but this was all bad. I've had canned beans with avocado and corn chips & been more pleased. Literally the ONLY thing on the entire table that wasn't a great disappointment was the ceviche....though, pieces of the fish were still slightly frozen and crunchy. I chose to look past it, not realizing it was the highlight of the meal, drinks included.  How this place got its fame and notoriety, I'll never understand. My friend chose it for my birthday dinner and since I'd literally just seen it written up in 2 other foodie articles, I thought it was a safe choice. When we couldn't make a reservation, I was even more intrigued and decided to go even though we would have to get lucky with a 'first come first served' patio spot. Unfortunately, we were seated immediately. The choice was between backless flat bar stools and gapped slat chairs...yay again. With about 2 inches btwn the slats- I had to rotate which part of my butt would press through (I weigh 125 so it's not like I need special furniture). My 2 friends and I started looking at the menu and one friend, who previously managed at the W, noticed that they have $36 entres, but their menus are laminated and they have a crappy blinking neon ''OPEN\\" sign. I thought, ''Odd, cheap-a$$es, but oh well - the food will be fabulous.'' We begin ordering and notice the wines-by-the-glass is EXTREMELY limited and not good- made worse by the fact that they ran out of 2 of the 4 wines we requested. Ok? No big deal, but if your menu is already limited wouldn't that make re-ordering easy? My nice friend who picked the place nervously adds it must be due to all the effort on mezcals. I get the cucumber margarita; bland/drinkable at first, but it should've been in a short glass bc it tastes watered down after a 2 minutes. I think ''maybe stirring will help'' and ask the waiter for straw saying ''I know you're probably trying to be straw free but ...'' He looks upset with me, says no and doesn't offer an alternative option. My friend insists he was nice at brunch the other day and we continue to give him a chance; we start making jokes to lighten his mood and tell him we'll forego a table inside to keep him as our server. It seemed to work so that was recovered at least. Since the bottles are reasonably priced, we take our 2nd choice, which we all decided was drinkable and we had to pay for since we'd opened it.  It came with an inch of ice in its chiller so I dump in my water to keep it all cold - easy fix. No big I guess...again. At this point there are occasional silences as we taste things then look at each other's reactions because by now we've all pointed out at least one negative thing and don't want to sound like sour old bitches. We distract ourselves with conversation, trying to zone out the cheesy dirty-6th street music blasting from the club across the street. No big deal, right? The food is raved about. My friend orders the ''burritos'' - which make jokes about, I order the lamb chops, and my other friend gets the shrimp.  I cut into mine and spit it out, surprised and confused...was it all fat, is it raw, ...?? I cut another area and eat it...press the rest with my finger. Eww. Maybe being cooked longer will fix it? So I ask for more cook time.  My other friend brings up how long its taking and hands me one of her shrimp she seems to be perfectly ok parting with. I can't remember it tasting like anything in particular. The lamb comes back. It seems safer to eat now, but NOTHING could fix it btw. It came with a side of plain white rice, and some sort of not so special apple sauce like stuff. The asparagus was good. But seriously the worst lamb chops I've ever had. I had great lamb at 888, that came with a curry sauce. So I'm not a food snob. This was airplane food. Nicest friend doesn't finish her burritos, but says nothing; I decide to try it when she leaves for the bathroom because I'm still hungry. It was a greasy pool of unfinished naked enchiladas.  I take one bite and put it down which is fairly new for me. I'm a vacuum when it comes to Mexican food, and easily pleased...I LOVE Curras, Polvos, Azul Tequila, Sazon, Tamales y Mas.  I eat a different dish each visit- I'm not picky. I'd rather have heated up a frozen Amy's dinner than eat this. We still decide to order dessert because it is my birthday. They're out of one of the ice creams (no surprise). The next day one friend brings up how dry the torte was. I thought it was ok, but nothing I'd remember or choose over something I could pick up at Quickie-Pickie.  And that's the end of it...though I did think they should've at least comped dessert after all of the snafus with wine, lamb, and it being my birthday, but ok, whatever.  Bring that to today, & one friend calls to ask how bad I thought dinner was. :("},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Maybe choose the wrong day but the food was far from expectation and other food I've had in north Boston.

The bruschetta with fig jam was delicious but we also ordered the antipasti plate, salad and the Brie and prosciutto panini...all of which were disappointing. The panini was especially lackluster - it had very little filling, needed some additional ingredient to add moisture to the filling, and wasn't crispy at all.

The yummy-goodness found throughout Mexico the Southwest US and SoCal can be found on our own Cobb Parkway -- and without the pretense of places that can't make tacos, or oddly enough, their inflated prices.\\n\\nLOCATION\\n\\nTacos La Villa is in a Office Max anchored shopping center on Cobb Parkway. You'll have to drive up a hill and pay close attention to the pylon sign going towards Kennesaw on Cobb Parkway, otherwise you'll miss it.\\n\\nAMBIANCE\\n\\nWhen someone from the neighboring Mexican grocery store walked in with a shopping car of produce and took it straight to the counter, I thought I was in good shape. When the television satellite channel focused on the weather in Mexico, as if that was the only weather to be discussed, I knew I was in the right place.\\n\\nYou may have to clean off your own table, but that's a small price to pay for the food.\\n\\nFOOD:\\n\\nI ordered three tacos, my Holy Trinity of tacos, that I use to compare all taquerias: carne asada, lengua and fish. I also ordered the Jamaica drink. The drink was not quite what you'll get anywhere else. It's sweet, but light on the hibiscus. More fruit punchy. Since most won't care, I doubt it'll be an issue. Order a Jarritos instead.\\n\\nAs for the tacos, ATLiens, we're finally playing ball. They come out on super small corn toritillas. (Like half the size you'd expect.) The carne asada was tasty and savory. Lengua was as good as anywhere and fish was authentically good.  There's a toppings bar that I'd strongly recommend you use to create the rest. Liberally apply cilantro, onions and lime and you've got what exactly what's sold every other taqueria in SoCal.\\n\\nI have only one complaint, they are much, much too small. Although it's just a dollar, the meal came to 6, with the upcharges on the lengua and fish tacos. And I was left hungry. Very hungry. I thought about ordering more -- a mark of goodness -- but for $6 you should leave fairly satisfied. But that's a small complaint in the Mexican food desert that Atlanta sometimes can be.\\n\\nThe only other complaint is that the corn tortillas are not homemade. But that's a small complaint given every other place in Atlanta that tries to make them, does so poorly.\\n\\nSo if you're looking for great and authentic tacos, come here. Avoid the other in-town places where the drinks are great and the tacos are not. Here, you'll feel transported to somewhere else and that's kind of the point of eating good food."},{"name":"Fresh To Order","address":"One Cnn Ctr, Ste 220","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"When you are in the mood for a good meal, well prepared, fast, but not fast food, Fresh to Order is a truly fresh change from the ordinary.  Its far superior to all the fast food joints, and better than many sit down chains.   \\n\\nThe choices include a nice selection of soups and large salads, well prepared and appetizingly presented.  I recommend the mushroom bisque or chicken tortilla soup (which you can substitute a generous portion for one of your sides).  Entrees include well prepared roast pork, mushroom chicken and a host of others I plan to try.  I saw several salads walk by and know I'm getting one next time.  There's paninis and sandwiches as well. One mother told me she ordered the kids meal for herself because it was so good, and the mac-and-cheese was 'to die for'.  Her child, I assume agreed, because she was devouring it. There's also beer at an amazing price for 32 oz which I share with my wife.\\n\\nIf you are down near the Ga Dome, CNN Center or Centennial Olympic Park, there are lots of choices.  When we are there, and normally in a hurry before a Falcon's game, the food court is the simplest place to find a decent meal.  Fresh to Order is our new go-to place.  In the time it takes you to get a sub sandwich prepared, you'll have a sit down, hot meal. The price is right, the portions are large (wife & I can share a meal or let our teens have some extra food) and everything is very tasty.  \\n\\nAvoid the fast food jungle in the CNN Center and relax at a sit-down restaurant that's fast, courteous and easy on the budget."},{"name":"Your Mom's Burger Bar","address":"1701 E Cesar Chavez St, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I have to give Your Mom's a 5 star review because not only was it delicious but it managed to make me want to come back.

(OK now I'm done, i swear). The Willie was a massive burger filled with cheese and bacon and drenched in BBQ sauce and an onion ring on TX Toast. I was really skeptical that the toast would even hold up through the whole meal but it did valiantly. The regular cheeseburger which I could not help but try was the same amount of mess and deliciousness. I loved that the patties were cooked at a medium-rare/medium finish because generally when cooking patties of such size the tendency is to cook them to a crisp and subsequently drain it of some of the flavor. While I am a huge fan of the style of there fries my other half generally is not but they were so good they were able to convert her... they are a lightly battered fry with the right amount of seasoning to still get the potato flavor without an overbearing saltiness. \\n\\nNow I have read that a lot of people have had slow wait times while waiting on their food which doesn't suprise me due to its size and popularity. Our wait was about 10 min which wasn't too bad and I was enjoying the breeze on the patio. Also the service staff is pretty friendly. Me and the Manager/Owner sat there and talked about the menu, the old taco place that was there before them (my girlfriend had been there before), there old location, and everyone's favorite review site YELP. \\n\\nThe only downside to my trip was that I had not read the Yelp reviews closer and realized that it was BYOB, and that I should have order the Coke instead of Dr. Pepper... \\n\\nAll in all I was quite pleased with my trip to Your Mom's and I will definitely be back.

I also almost aways order their beef chow fun.\\n\\nYou can't really go wrong with ordering anything off the menu here. Even the Americanized foods are pretty good. Get the shrimp-stuffed crab claw! It is delicious. The only thing I do not like here is the calamari. Also, they have an amazing lunch menu. All meals under $5, which include an appetizer, hot & sour soup, and lunch-sized entree."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"My friend and I decided to check out Gladys Knight's since I was visting from NYC and wanted to get the \\"Southern\\" experience. When we walked up to the restaurant, we noticed that the neighborhood was somewhat rough (Sunday afternoon). I was even surprised to see a sign on their window saying \\"No Weapons Allowed\\" Really?! This definitely ruined the home-like aura I was expecting. You think if someone had a weapon they are going to read the sign and say \\"Hmm Oh darn, I guess i can't go in since I'm strapped, maybe next time.\\"? Anyway, there was a long wait of between 30-45min and we had to either wait outside in the semi-long line or sit inside if the bench seats at the front were unoccupied. We waited outside for a little while but decided to go in since it was getting very cold and windy. Although the bench seats at the waiting area were mostly taken we decided to just stand there until they called our names. All of the sudden the security guard snapped at us and said it's either we sit on the bench or wait outside (in the cold). To our luck the people on the bench made room for us to sit with them. We were highly upset at the way the security of a supposedly popular establishment reacted when it's us customers who supply his paycheck. We are young educated black men, but were treated like misbehaved children. The hostesses were not really welcoming  and professional. Personally, I was expecting to get this whole welcoming grandma southern hospitality vibe, but that wasn't the case especially with the security guard and cop manning the entrance. \\n\\nBesides the subpar service, the food was actually good in my opinion even though my friend from the south said he definitely has had better and the food wasn't anything to go crazy about. But then again I dont really know what's good southern food and what's bad southern food. Back on the service side, our waitress was nice but had no type of professionalism. She placed the check on the table before I was done eating -____-. She kept messing up the simple things like giving us one straw when it was two of us  at the table and not giving us a pen to sign our receipts. \\n\\nOverall, If you're looking for a place to just get some food and bounce then this might be for you. But if you want a more elegant and welcoming environment where you're treated more than just a customer then go somewhere else. I definitely wouldn't bring a date here. As I mentioned earlier, I mainly came to check this place off my bucket list of southern things to do."},{"name":"Athan's Bakery","address":"1621 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"This review is meant for the service. One cannot help but feeling frustrated when the owner aka manager (Aris) is following you around like you are some kind of criminal. \\n\\nStrike number one: a friend of mine and I wanted some pastries (to-go), so we decided to check out Athan's. My friend has already gotten a cup of coffee from Starbucks and as soon as we entered the establishment, there goes \\"Aris\\" judging us from top down and more so, eye-balling the coffee cup in his hand without even asking if we were interested in ordering to-go pastries. Instead, he started lecturing my friends for a good 4 minutes about how bad of an idea it was to be bringing in outside beverage. (Excuse me, I am sorry that your coffee sucks and we were only interested in your pastries \\"to-go\\".)\\n\\nStrike number two: Now that we got lectured and he said he would \\"allow\\" us just this once to sit in with an outside beverage, we decided to do so for the sake of it. As I was waiting for my pastry at the counter, we decided to have a seat at the table closest to the counter, and away from the crowded area. That was when we were being followed by Aris, yet again, and asked us to move to a more crowded area. His reason was that that table was a 4-seater and there was only two of us. I would understand if people are lining out the door to get the seats, but there were many open tables at the time. So we just felt attacked and it was very unprofessional of Aris to be treating paying customers that way. \\n\\nIn the end, we asked him to bag our pastries politely saying that we will not be coming back to Athan's again. His response, with a smile, was: \\"Great! Do not come back again.\\"\\n\\nIf you do not know how to treat your customer right, just stay at home and collect your revenue.

Oh yes, a brunch spot -- that's also a dinner spot, of course -- that delivers real, wholesome brunches -- like chicken and waffles. Mmmmmm, yeah. \\n\\nAllow me to deconstruct my amazing brunch: runny, perfectly poached eggs; hollandaise sauce; roasted potatoes, porchetta, zucchini, onions, toast. For $10. Say what? That's reasonable! Throw in French pressed coffee, light streaming in the large windows, reflecting off of the vintage-esque chandeliers, and well, it's just a perfect place for a Sunday afternoon. \\n\\nSome things to keep in mind about Two Chefs: It's TINY. Like, there's nowhere to wait inside. And since it is popular, there's likely going to a wait. And you're going to be waiting outside. Make sure your whole party is with you, or they'll bypass you for the next group. And if by whole group, you were thinking a large party of 6, think again, I'd suggest Two Chefs when it's just you and your closest crew. \\"Table for 2 please.\\" They also stop taking tables at 2:15ish. We got there at 1, and it was enough time. \\n\\nServers and hostessing staff seem to be run off of their feet. It's fair, it's busy. But it's also really small, so their put-off attitudes feel amplified. It's noticeable and detracts from the magical feel of the space. A little smile, some banter, maybe even a water refill or a quick check in during our meal. I'd smile back :) None of this put me off enough to not come back.

Life is about managed expectations, and sometimes people want to assert that there is only a limited type of experiences or standards that can be incorporated into a \\"good time\\". If you go into Tanuki with preconceived notions as to what the food should be, how the service should run or what the place should look like based on the fact that you see a high star rating on Yelp, you are running a great risk for disappointment.  I think to understand Tanuki, you must understand the reason behind a place like Tanuki.  \\n\\nTanuki is founded on one person's love for food and sake.  That person uses all her talents, her experience, and her patience to share that love and introduce that food and sake to total strangers.  Because of years of grueling work, that you could never comprehend no matter how much Anthony Bourdain you watch,  that person has gotten so good at creating and sharing that food and sake, she has convinced a few others to help her get that food into your gob and gut.  And she does all of this at ridiculously low prices.\\nSo now you may be starting to understand the why for Tanuki.  It is a fun place built out of struggle and love.  There is always something hilarious and bizarre on the tv.  The music is loud and exciting.  The service is quick and efficient, but not overly friendly.  This is the way Tanuki should be.  They place no value in frills in service or atmosphere, because these are not things that Tanuki loves.  To pretend otherwise is futile.\\n\\nAnd the food!  Rarely do you eat in a restaurant where the excitement of the chef in preparing your dinner is so literally palatable.  The chewy rice dumplings with spicy clam broth.  The sweet and tangy sausages.  Those perfect, fresh bites of minimally adorned fish.  You are a very fortunate person to have the opportunity to eat this food.  The people at Tanuki know it.  So should you!  Show your gratitude.  Drink more beer and sake than you think you should.  Shout at the table next to you.  Laugh and tip well!  Tanuki is the rare place where you are encouraged to set your cares to the wind.  But you can only do it, if you pull the stick out of your ass."},{"name":"Grand Chinatown","address":"21 Billings Rd","city":"Quincy","stars":"2.5","text":"Whenever my family and I decide that we're either too lazy or impatient to brave the parking in Chinatown, we head to either East Chinatown or Grand Chinatown. They're owned by the same people, so the flavors taste the same. I prefer Grand Chinatown because it's bigger. Coincidentally, whenever we go, we always get the large table at the back of the room. This is a review for both the dim sum and the dinner food. \\n\\nThe dim sum is overpriced and, because I go often enough, I can tell that they've decreased their portions. Dim Sum is basically the same anywhere; I have yet to see anyone come up with creative alternatives to the Har Gow or Cheong Fun (Dumplings and Rice Noodles). \\n\\nAs for their entrees, they've also decreased in portion size. They're still pretty good though. Good enough for the area; I'm still waiting for one of chefs from one of the better Chinatown restaurants to open his own in Quincy. \\n\\nWe've tried almost everything. If you're Chinese and can speak it, ask for their daily seafood specials. We had an interesting clam dish once and it was delicious. If you're not Chinese, you can attempt to talk to the waiters about their specials. Also, ask about their Twin Lobster Special with Ginger and Scallion. My mom's rule is that if it's over $24 for two lobsters, it is not worth it and you should get something else. Usually, the price should range from $20-$23. Although there is a restaurant in Chinatown who is advertising this for $17. I have not tried it yet. \\n\\nMy mom really likes the Empress Chicken; I personally can't taste the difference between this type of chicken and regular salted chicken, but apparently there is one. Get half; I think it's about $10? My sister is love with the Shrimp in Mayo with Walnuts. However, this dish has lost its appeal once my father figured out how to make it.  \\n\\nTheir Spicy Salted Dishes are often the dishes that we love most. We usually get the Spicy Salted Three Delights, with shrimp, pork chops, and scallops. Sometimes, my mother opts for this type of small, white fish. I don't know its name in English. Ask them for your choices. If you want something substantial and delicious, get the Pork Chops. They are always worth it. We usually get them as take-out whenever we don't feel like cooking or ordering pizza. \\n\\nWe used to get the Fu Chow Fried Rice, which has scallops, shrimp, and chicken with egg and peas, but found it that was too saucy and salty the last couple of times. So we moved on to the Ying Yang Fried Rice. One side of this fried rice is covered in a tangy, almost sour, smooth tomato sauce with chicken--the tanginess will cleanse your palate. The other side has this white eggy sauce covering fried rice with shrimp. Also very yummy. Try the red side first to make room in your room and then the white side. \\n\\nAs for vegetables, we tend to ask for their fresh vegetables, but always tend to fall back on either the Water Spinach with garlic or the Peapod Stems with Garlic. They do their vegetables well, but I'm not eating the broccoli and Americanized options under their small \\"Vegetable\\" section. \\n\\nIt's interesting how Chinese owners complain that they don't attract a more diverse crowd when they make their best food, such as their specials, unavailable to customers who do not speak and read Chinese. Prepare to spend at least $100, or even more, if you order the dishes my family likes. I think our average, for 5-6 people, is maybe $140? I like this restaurant because of the convenience factor and because my mom knows how to get the best and freshest food out of the waiters. We'll be coming here many more times to come. Mostly because we are too lazy to trek to Chinatown, though."},{"name":"Penn Station","address":"1980 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"By far the worst Penn Station I've ever been to.

The Calamari & Mussels: perfectly cooked calamari and mussels with angel hair pasta; a little spice, capers, and olives perfected this dish.  And the fish of the day, sea bass, with broccoli rabe. The Sea bass was, again, perfectly cooked and the broccoli rabe was amazing.  I have to mention that we did not have a reservation and we were seated at the bar immediately.

We also watched the chef prepare spinach with olives, capers and some other items that looked so amazing we wanted to order a side of it with our meals (in addition to everything else).

They sat us next to the patio, which was a cute corner table, but we were right next to the patio doors and the wall - both the door jambs and walls were filthy with food stuck all over them. There were fruit flies all over the place and a bug ended up in my drink twice. We got the eggplant and the corn flan for appetizers, both which were decent if not a little weird. For meals, the veal was way overcooked. My red snapper was tasty, but I was put off by the bugs and decided to take it home and eat it at another time. And here's the kicker. The server gave me a bag with my food in it, so I assumed it was in a box. As we walked across Boston Common to get ice cream, I wondered what the funny smell was. Turns out the server wrapped a juicy, saucy red snapper in TIN FOIL and put it in the bag.

We hurried out of our offices to make it in time to enjoy as much Tilt happy hour as possible. And it paid off.\\n\\nWe arrived just past 5pm, with 1 hour left for happy hour. I'm not big on crowded restaurants and bars- I left NYC for a reason- and thankfully, this place was practically empty. It looked like the \\"freelancers\\" were still at work, sipping on their coffees and clicking away at their laptops. In the restaurant, and not in the adjacent bar area, there were still plenty of seats and table space available. However, the bar situation was quite different. Even though you can order drinks in the main area, the bar was pretty bustling with your typical happy hour crowd- girls in heals and dudes wearing too much axe.\\n\\nI ordered a beer, the Koolafosky burger, and 6 pieces of the jalapeno tots to share. My friend ordered the cherry pie and Island Trucker burger. We then found seats at a communal tall table. 10 minutes later, our food was up. The Koolafosky burger is basically a regular burger with pastrami, sauerkraut and Swiss cheese. This was a pretty hefty, filling burger. It was interesting, but nothing too wild. I enjoyed the meatiness, but I wouldn't call it the best burger I've ever had. Thankfully, I had the self-discipline to only eat half of it and box up the other half for later. I would highly suggest doing this to give your stomach the space for tots. The tots were good, but definitely not your traditional tator tot. Each tot was probably 4x the size of your average tot. It was yummy, but just know not to expect tots you find at every other Portland beer & burger spot.\\n\\nI really enjoyed my friend's Island Trucker burger. This burger had ham, onion rings, and pineapple. I didn't think I would really like this combination, but it actually worked out really well. I preferred this one to my Koolafosky. The cherry pie was ok. I don't think I have too much more to say about the pie beyond that. It was a big slice, but nothing spectacular tasting.\\n\\nAside from the pretty good food, I did also order an Upright beer on draft, which is a huge plus for me. The happy hour prices were really decent as well. As it grew closer to 6pm, the crowds definitely started piling in and I actually felt like I was in high school or atleast a college freshmen.

We happened to have some guest in town from NYC and I knew this would be a perfect event to take them to. We hit up Speeds Hot Dogs and they loved them. Knowing the great reviews and Bostons best that his truck has I thought we would score another victory for Boston here. Sadly we did not. \\n\\nThe gates opened at 10 and I placed my order around 11:30. The pork ribs that I had been mentally gnawing on for the 30 minute line were oh so very sadly sold out. That's alright they have some beef ribs I guess I'll order some of those and some corn bread please. The lady serving up the orders and taking the money was very friendly, I quickly had my very heavy box of ribs and I was on my way. \\n\\nFound a table and sat down excited to continue my own personal war on the food trucks of Boston. I opened the container to find 4 huge beef ribs in a nice shallow bath of a good tangy sauce. They looked very good and my girlfriend and I couldn't wait to dig in. I'm not sure if it was because they were getting slammed by a non stop line of 80+ customers but these were just flat out bad. They must not have been cooked long enough because the meat was tough and holding onto the bone for everything it had. It is by far the most work I have ever had to put into a rib just to get half a bite of meat. I don't think I'm even doing a fair job expressing the state of the meat on these ribs. Sadly we left 4 huge ribs with plenty of meat we couldn't liberate from the bone sitting in the container. \\n\\nThe sauce was great and there were maybe 4 quality bites that showed me what these ribs could have been giving a little more attention/time. These 2 things are all that saved this review from being a 1 star. \\n\\n\\nI feel that its important that I point out again this was at the SoWa food truck event . I am really hoping this isn't usually the quality of food they put out on a normal day because if so I'm not quite sure how this truck has the reputation it currently has. \\n\\nI hope our paths cross again and I can give them another chance."},{"name":"Floramo's Restaurant","address":"213 Everett Ave","city":"Chelsea","stars":"4","text":"Every time I come here there is a wait, but it is worth it.

You can get your covered-with-cheese fix of the usual suspects of burritos and enchiladas, but they also offer the al pastor, lengua, and barbacoa/cow-face options, as well as what looks like very popular menudo.\\n\\nThe Torta Cubana wasn't my favorite ever, but the amount of avocado was good.  I think I just missed not having hot dog bits in it.  Maybe I'm just weird.  The namesake Burrito Tapatia was pretty good.  I got mine with lengua (tongue).  Oddly, the tongue they use in the burrito is shredded, offering almost a roast-beef sandwich kind of consistency, with great flavor.  My dining partners ordered the lengua in taco form, which came sliced in a way that you could not mistake what it was.  Some didn't seem a fan of that.  The burrito was filled with lettuce and tomatoes as well, so if that's not your thing, you may want to ask for it without.\\n\\nDrinks include the usual combinations of Jarritos and Mexican Coke bottles, and a larger variety of Mexican beers than I was expecting, including Negra Modelo, Carta Modelo, etc., in addition to Coors light and the rest.  But those are all dead to me when you have the little fountain dispenser thing of horchata.  Their horchata is a little more subtle than some places, but I've never been a huge fan when it's too nutmeg/cinnamonny, so I like it here.

We had the peapod stem with garlic. It was good. Always good no matter where I go. Well, I guess I usually go to the good places to avoid bad food in general. Lol. We had a pound or two of the big red shrimps from the tanks. We had it fried with chili peppers. So so good. I love fresh shrimps and especially ones with their heads attached. They were so sweet and meaty. Yes, big shrimps can sometimes taste better than lobster. Oh my god, did I say that? We also had the sizzling steak with green bell peppers. So tasty. \\n\\nI love eating late and eating for fun! It's like the after clubbing meal where good tasting food was more important than how much it was going to cost us.

And they were thinking of turtle and alligator. Seriously, guys are too funny.\\n \\nThe desert wasn't good. They added some sort of Chinese herb in with the sweet black bean desert so it tasted like my mom's Chinese herbal medicines that she stew for hours. It wasn't a good combination.

The Meat Samosas are \\"freaking\\" huge for her but it was so good that she finished them.  The flavor of the Tandoori Wings and the HOT level for SPICY is just the way I like it, but my fren told me its too hot for her taste bud but she still like it and cant stop eating them.\\n\\nThen came the Garlic Naan, Fish and Shrimp Tandoori and the Chicken Vindaloo.  All our main entree comes with Basmati rice.  But I was slight disappointed for my main dish of Fish and Shrimp Tandoori.  Coz, first it does not come sizzling, that is should have perhaps it was waiting for me back in the kitchen to be served...  The flavor of the Fish and Shrimp was just OK.\\n\\nSince my fren cant tolerate the heat level of spicyness, we ordered mango lassi for the both of us.  She like it alot.  Furthermore, it was her first time drinking Mango Lassi.  She even told me, what she ate that evening, was suprisingly good and she never had a better Indian/Pakistani dinner, as compared to the ones in San Diego, Cali.\\n\\nFrom there, I was so relieved.  Thank GOD, my fren likes this place.  In addition to this, she cant wait perhaps to have lunch buffet with her co-workers in the future when she will be in town for work.\\n\\nMeanwhile, after our dinner ends, the waitstaff strike some conversation with us.  He also offer the rice pudding to us.  All in all, I like this place.  We even have plenty of left-overs for that evening.  \\n\\nI hope to go to this place with Hubs in the future and perhaps from there, see what he thinks about this place.

If I were rating on service, I'd give it 1 star.  Hence, 3 stars.  I'm hoping that this was a fluke, but judging by some of the other reviews, I'm afraid it might not be.  \\n\\nService issues:\\nWe were slightly late to a party of 10.  After a while, the server came to take our order, but we had no menus.  Our group made (no exaggeration) FIVE requests for water from different servers and it was more than halfway through our meal before we received it.  After the food arrived (in a fairly timely fashion) and we were finished, we had to wait (and make multiple requests, AGAIN) for take-out boxes for our leftovers.  We also had to physically get up to ask servers for our bill (after waiting about 20 minutes or so).  Then after putting our credit cards in the bill folder, we sat around for another good chunk of time, before we then hand-delivered our bill to the hostess.  Because we didn't receive enough boxes, we had to get-up and request them from someone.  This is ridiculous.  Why did we even bother to leave a tip if anything that you wish to get done, you need to deal with yourself?  Plus, all the delays extended our visit by a good chunk of time -- isn't turnover is in their best interests?  Anyway... inexplicably, at one point, the music level went up about a jillion decibels so that we then had to start yelling to be heard.  It was like 7 pm, not dance party time yet... ???  I don't get it.\\n\\nThe food:\\nMy husband and I ordered the rojo y verde tamales which were great, particularly the verde ones.  The rojo one had an initial fishy taste, which was weird, but then the rest was delicious.  We also got one of the molcajete cactus boiling cauldrons with chorizo and shrimp (can't remember the exact name of the dish) in some sort of green chile sauce.  That was quite good and I think the level of spiciness was just right.  Spicy enough to have a kick and leave an impression, but not so much to be inedible.\\n\\nWe also had enough leftovers for several more meals... so that's nice too, kinda makes up for the entree prices (which I understand given the ambiance, level/quality of food, etc).  \\n\\nSpeaking of, ambiance...\\nAs others have said, the restaurant is located in a non-descript strip mall, tucked into the corner.  I have never noticed it when driving by in the past.  Once you enter, it's another world.  The decor and build-out is quite nice and probably cost a pretty penny.  \\n\\nOther:\\nAgree with previous yelpers too, that it's not such a kid-friendly place.  No kids' menu, but they were very amenable with some off-menu options like a small burrito, crispy taco or chicken fingers.\\n\\nAnyway, will give Agave one more shot, but if the service continues to suck a**, it'll be adios."},{"name":"Cobblestone Cafe","address":"227 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Unfortunately, I had a really poor experience at Cobblestone this weekend, and I will not be returning any time soon.

I'm always hoping to be wowed and delighted for my meal - Floataway did not disappoint.\\n\\nAlways having been a fan of Star Provisions, this seemed like a great choice for dinner.  The most recent menus posted online looked delectable and I prefer a quieter atmosphere for such occasions.  \\n\\nWe were seated promptly and our server, Sarah, was happy to conform to our leisurely pace for the evening.  I was thrilled that she did not even blink at my cocktail order (Dark & Stormy) and their single malt scotch selection was perfect (to accomodate my Mom's tastes).  As we sipped, we perused the menu and drooled.\\n\\nWe opted for cold starters (old for such a chilly evening) - I went with the Maplebrook burrata with olive oil, sea salt and grilled Sourdough bread while two others selected the marinated roasted beets with avocado, pickled egg, goat cheese and pistachios.  My burrata was enough to serve the entire table, but I wasn't complaining and was happy to share.  It was creamy and the perfect foil for the crispy, crunchy snap of the grilled bread.  Topped with micro cress, it was a delight.\\n\\nNext, our entrees.  My cousin went for the vegetable plate picking the Woodland Gardens roasted sweet potatoes, Anson Mills polenta, fried Brussels sprouts with mit and Woodland Gardens roasted baby carrots with a cumin vinaigrette. They were all perfectly cooked and so fresh I was almost jealous.  Her husband went for the ricotta gnocchi with Jamison Farm lamb ragu, mushrooms and rosemary.  Hello carb heaven with a side of lamby-delight. Rich and delicious, for sure.  My Mom, ever predictable her in menu selections, picked the pan-roasted Moulard duck breast with endive, Nicoise olives and orange.  For my tastes, the fat could have been rendered a bit more, but over all succulent and delicious.  Now, the main event was my entree - I always pick the best on the menu.  Braised boneless short rib with Anson Mills polenta and a horseradish gremolata.  Falling apart, succulent beefy-goodness. Fabulous.  \\n\\nNext up - dessert. You cannot have a fancy dinner without some form of dessert - especially for a birthday dinner.  My cousins went for the trio of organic ice milks - extra virgin olive oil with sea salt, candied lemon and cocoa nibs, cookie granola.  My mother selected the pear and almond tart with whipped ricotta and a port gelato.  As for me, I picked (the best) the warm toffee pudding with a vanilla gelato.  Let me tell you that this could have been the last thing I ever ate and I would have been content with that.  No, seriously.  Toffee pudding atop the most fabulous caramel goo (no other way to describe it) ever invented.  The gelato was perfect to help cut the richness.  I was nice and shared - mostly because the restaurant ALSO brought out a wonderful chocolate cupcake with a toasted meringue frosting with a candle in it for the occasion.  Very sweet and thoughtful - but c'mon, just stick the candle in the toffee pudding and call it a night!  \\n\\nMy only complaint about the entire meal was the salt was heavy-handed.  Take it easy, folks, as there is a difference between enhancing flavors and over-doing it.  You stepped over the line last night.\\n\\nOverall, an amazing meal.
