Can't blame them, especially with some of the mixed drinks they have here.  There's some drink with 4 types of rum, one being 151, that's just awesome.  SO I've heard the basement here is awesome, but we've only been seated on the 1st floor, but the main floor is very nice, if not a little loud.  Bad acoustic design, makes it hard to hear people at your table when it's crowded.\\n\\nSo onto the food.  Its not as good as 1 particular place in San Rafael, that would get 6 stars if possible.  However, the clay pit is very good.  Asking for very spicy gets you jalapeos in your meal, which I guess is where the Indian fusion part comes in.

When I asked him how it was he simply replied \\"it tastes like a chicken sandwich\\" and after I took a bite, I would have to agree. Sure it was good, but nothing really special.

Voodoo Donuts can be very touristy and I wanted a taste of where the locals go. After perusing Yelp, I came across this place and with 4 1/2 stars, I was hoping for an experience that would knock my socks off. The blueberry basil seemed to be a big hit and because I am a huge fan of basil, it piqued my curiosity. I do love that they have very different and exotic flavors; my choices were: blueberry basil, valrhona chocolate, buttermilk glaze, raspberry, lemon and key lime curd filling, and a creme br√ªl√©e something or other. I was impressed with the raspberry and that's it. The blueberry basil tasted more so blueberry with very little basil.....big disappointment. Everything else was just ok. The donuts themselves are very thick and I felt that there was not enough flavoring in them. I like my donuts thick, but not pound cake thick, and moist and these just did not do it for me.\\nOverall, it was a good experience and if you're in the market for a flavor above the norm, then I would suggest that you give it a go.

I've been hankering for some German food, and other locations around Portland while OK have left me wanting.  I has heard good things about Otto & Anita's, and was pleased with my first visit, even off a limited banquet menu.  I was excited about the prospect of once again visiting a nice mom & pop German restaurant that isn't as slick and polished as some others around the Portland area.\\n\\nI desperately want to give Otto & Anita's a 5, but I just can't do it.  I liked it a lot, but there were some things that took some points off.\\n\\nWe were greeted with some rolls and butter, the bread was quite good.  I have to have beer with German food, and was disappointed that the only beer options were a hefeweizen and a pilsner on tap (not my favorites), and a doppelbock in a bottle.  I would have hoped for a bit more variety, but I was there for the food and I cheerfully ordered the pilsner.\\n\\nFor appetizers my friend and I each had a cup of the dill pickle soup, and we split a Maultaschen (a pasta shell stuffed with spiced ground pork in a beef/onion broth) and a sausage with sauerkraut.  I was a bit apprehensive about the concept of dill pickle soup, but it got good reviews on Yelp so I was convinced that it couldn't be that wretched.  It was in a word, amazing.  I was expecting something like pickle brine, but it was actually a cream soup with an understated taste of dill pickle, with some small bits of pickle in the mix.  The green color was a bit off-putting, but my oh my did it make for some happy tastebuds.  I don't recall having anything like that in Germany, but it was pretty damn good.\\n\\nThe Maultaschen was quite good, and the broth was excellent for dipping the dinner rolls (I imagine it's also used for their French dip).  The sausage didn't do much for me, it seemed a bit bland and flavorless.  Now I'm not a big sauerkraut fan (kind of weird for a German food enthusiast), but I really liked it.\\n\\nMy friend ordered wienerschnitzel, and it came with carrots, greens, and some grilled potato chunks.  I had a taste of the wienerschnitzel, and enjoyed it.  The side dishes weren't anything particularly exciting, but they did complement the meal nicely.   I ordered the jaegerschnitzel (what can I say, I like mushrooms), and it came with the same greens and carrots, but instead of potatoes it came with spaetzle.  I absolutely love spaetzle, especially if it's smothered in a mushroom sauce.  Unfortunately the spaetzle here didn't really do it for me.  It seemed a little bit greasy, and heavier/denser than I'm used to.  It certainly didn't stop me from eating it, mind you, but I was hoping for a bit more there.\\n\\nWe were both too stuffed from appetizers and dinner to contemplate dessert, but the offerings sure looked enticing.\\n\\nThe service we received wasn't swift, but we weren't in a hurry so that's OK.  Our server was very friendly though.  The restaurant is a little hard to find, and parking can be a bit challenging, but all in all, I quite enjoyed my dining experience and very much look forward to my next visit and explorations of the menu.

Sometimes, they make the tastiest pizzas in Portland. Other times, the pie I take home is a cheesy grease bomb and heart-burn inducer. Quality at Signal seems to go in seasons--this spring was a particularly good season, but the pie I picked up last night was so laden with grease it oozed from the cheese and gathered in thick orange and red pools that my toppings floated it. I'm awarding Signal 3 stars as an average---when they're on, they're easily a four-star place. When they're off, a two-star rating is generous.\\n\\nSignal serves artisan pizza (whole and by the slice, carry out or dine in) and salads, an assortment of sodas and beers (including a couple on tap), and Blue Bunny ice cream. It's a great summer place as there's ample outdoor seating and the \\"garage\\" atmosphere is pretty cool.

That is the theme to Ethiopian food, Spice, if you haven't figured out by now.

But our excitement was quickly extinguished by weak bar service and mediocre food. \\n\\nI know that you can't totally judge a place by one bad bartender, but as a new restaurant on a Friday night I feel like you really have to be on your A-game. Our bartender didn't know what Sazerac even was, and also didn't know what a caipirinha was or how to make it, *despite* there being a ginger-infused version on the drink menu. I'm usually not a cocktail orderer, and would typically give a little more leeway here on bartender knowledge, but for a place clearly aiming for a lounge/bistro feel, not knowing how to make pretty basic cocktails was a big, big F. Unfortunately, he also won no points on personality, as he just kind of trudged around grumbling, and refused to engage several patrons in conversation or chit chat (even though the bar wasn't really that busy).\\n\\nAside from this, we ordered the oven-roasted sweet potato fries, which were cut way to thin too stand up to oven-roasting, and ended up too limp and lifeless.

I had to complement it with large gulps of water. The Bloodlust was much better - a palpable tang of blood orange mixed with a sriracha-lime rim. The sriracha lime salt kicked in as an aftertaste, so it made for an interesting cocktail. \\n\\nBraised Pork Belly Buns: Yummy! Ok, the sauce is a bit too salty, so I had to drink lots of water with it, but the buns were absolutely divine! Steamed to perfection, the bun really made the dish. That sounds weird, and I'm not sure that says much about the dish itself, but the combination of the soft, sweet buns with the salty pork was ultimately good enough for us to have another order of it. \\n\\nOysters: They were OK. Underwhelming. The layer of ice underneath the oysters were already melted, so the oysters ended up being lukewarm - not my favorite. The shucking was also done haphazardly.

Too spicy for my bf but it was a hugeee chunk for like $1-2 and super filling.\\n\\nWe ended up getting pecan pie after our meal just to say we tried dessert. It was good too! Warm, buttery, flaky and not too sweet.\\n\\nService was cut and dry, not too nice, not too mean, just fast and efficient. \\n\\nOverall the meal was a bit pricey, we only got one plate (1lb) plus two sides, two cornbreads, dessert and a beer and that ran about $40. Plenty of food for us though we're on the more weak appetite side.\\n\\nOh the bbq sauces sucked that's why they get 4 stars not 5. Make it thicker and more flavorful and warm it up! A bbq place needs to have good bbq sauce! The one we were given was watery and bland and kinda gross to squirt all over your food. It should be the thick warm kind the cook ladles over your meat.\\n\\nOverall, I think I figured out the secret to austin food. Go to the place least hyped, you won't be set up for disappointment.

The Greek burger for me was the best -- the lamb is perfectly cooked, and it tastes like an amazing gyro pita in burger style. I have no complaints there. Further, the truffle fries are only a $1 add-on. I can see the value in that. The other two burgers were just not that overwhelming. I feel like I have had similar experiences for half the price, and a quarter of the wait. \\n\\nI will say that the shakes here are delicious. This makes it really more of a 3.5 star place for the shakes alone. The caramel and sea salt one is unique and highly recommended. \\n\\nThe wait is just too long - especially the South Congress location which always has a line out the door.

Unfortunately the following was the thai sausage and crispy rice salad which was somewhat of the lowlight compared to the other flavours presented by the other dishes. The next one was steamed mussels with lemongrass and basil. Mussels were plentiful and juicy. The broth was flavourful too with a slight spice. Finally, they served another three dishes at once. Duck confit salad (it was mostly made of duck hahaha not sure why it was called salad), pork jowl black bean stir fry, and beef short rib in a red curry. And it came with a portion of rice for two. Duck confit was made very well, had lychee in there too which was odd but worked well in some ways imo. Pork jowl came in a generous portion. The best dish of the night goes to the short rib. I believe it must've been seared before placement in the sauce because there was a crispy side to the meat.

WOW! We counted down the days and went the 1st week of their opening! And sure enough on a SAt night there was a line even though we went early. But you can not complain bc if its not that good, why will there be lines? There's lines out of their Memphis location too but the key is going there early. We got seated fine and yes the staff was a little new. We had 2 for our table and one knew what they were doing but the young boy who was still so nice was a little lost and tried giving us the order from the table next to ours. Some people there were grumpy bc they had to wait long but we talked to them and they were overjoyed after eating their chicken and was happy when they left. And that's what we expected. OUr family shared the largest combo w/mac and cheese and fries as sides. If it wasn't bc of the kids we would've gotten coleslaw and beans bc those were pretty good in Memphis. The mac and cheese was just ok but good enough for our kids and the fries were ok too. But the chicken to us is out of this world. Yes its slightly not as good as the Memphis one only bc we ate in the car for that and it was hotter and fresher so the grease clung to the bag. But here it was hot and fresh too but a bit greasier. They still trim the fat like they say they do and I think that makes the biggest difference in fried chicken. Don't expect it to be a cheap old fried chicken place like Church's. We like Church's and KFC but this is not a fast food place and its priced that way. Its a bit pricier but its delish. They spice it perfectly. Its a downtown restaurant so its pricier than the usual fried chicken place. I love their sweet tea, the hopping atmosphere, the nice owner and staff even tho they are new and young and esp their chicken. Just can't eat enough of it. Yes I wish we lived nearer to go there more often. My friend who is a fried chicken//foodie drove from another city just to try this place and raved about it-he tried all their sides and recommended the fried pickles as well. So idk why some people don't rave about it but just don't go there expecting its a fast food fried chicken place w/those prices.

Overall, a great place. However, the server treated me like a 2nd class citizen. I told her about a food sensitivity when we ordered drinks to which she replied she would check with the chef. She then came back to take our order and had totally forgotten so my friends had to wait a few more minutes. Also, when she asked who wanted boxes to take home food she only brought back boxes for my friends but not me even though I had said I wanted a box. One of my friends even said something to me about it.\\n\\nWhile I could eat less than 1/3 of the menu items, I settled on a delish garden salad with chicken and shrimp along with chops and dip since I was starving. 2 salads and 2 apps... came out several minutes apart. Barely done with apps and the entrees came out... several more minutes apart. It took her at least 6 trips to bring 7 meals and a side. Food was delish and service for my other friends was great. I will consider going back again as there were a couple of other items I could have that I might try. Definitely more of a pub than a restaurant. We were seated at a cool high top table, however, several of my friends were uncomfortable on the wooden stool seats with no back support. You should definitely check it out as they have an affordable expansive menu."},{"name":"Orinoco","address":"22 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Amazing food.

The breading had nice flavors.\\n\\nOrdered the sweet tea and it was juuuuust right! Now for the main entree. Ordered the 2 PC white with fries and Cole slaw. When I tell you that the chicken is so doggone crispy!! It's perfection! Crispy and spicy outside, soft and juicy insides. The slaw was nothing special for me and the fries must've been forgotten about for seasoning but it still complimented my meal.\\n\\nTo see sooo many people coming in to get a bite of the devilishly yummy chicken brought tears to my eyes!....either that or the chicken was spicier than I thought.

It's a small Italian restaurant in North End where they make their past fresh everyday.

The Cappellini con Gamberi was the best I've ever had. The couple sitting next to us raved about their sweet potato Gnocchi telling us that it's reason why she comes here all the time.

The service is amazing, from the moment we walked in every staff member was friendly and attentive. We came in at 7 on a Saurday and snagged the last open table. Shortly after we sat a lined formed, so I would definitely recommend reservations.\\n\\nThe food- spectacular. We tried a number of items and everything was delicious.\\n\\nCroquettes: they are spectacular. I'm not sure what they use for batter or oil but all were cooked perfectly. Our favorite was the oxtail, it was incredibly rich, flavorful, and creamy. It might be my favorite tapas of the night actually. The artichoke stuffed with cheese was also amazing, although it was not clear from the description that it is a croquette. \\n\\nSpicy garlic shrimp: also delicious, although pretty standard garlic shrimp you'd find at any tapas restaurant. Once you have Toro's garlic shrimp everything else pales in comparison. Still tasty though!\\n\\nQuail legs: highly recommend! Perfectly seasoned, crispy skin, just the perfect savory bite. \\n\\nWe also tried the spinach and blue cheese empanada (amazing, the dipping sauce they serve with it is incredibly flavorful, smokey and tomatoey) and lamb meatballs with saffron sauce (tender and moist, although needed a touch more salt).\\n\\nWe would also recommend saving room for flan, splitting one between 2 people is the perfect ending to this meal. Overall, you can't go wrong with this place.

This is closer to a 3.5 with the possibility of going up once I visit a few more times.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Interesting selection of tacos and other food items\\n- The space. Very open and airy. I loved how the indoor/outdoor areas sort of melded together. With this crazy cool July weather, nighttime dining was pleasant. I really liked the unique basket lighting.\\n- Service system. I do like the idea of placing a card in a holder on the table that lets the staff know that you need assistance. As long as they are paying attention, this saves from those times when you are looking for your waiter.\\n- Great bar area\\n- Duck taco. We both ended up ordering more of this one. It was outstanding.\\n- Salsa verde - tasty\\n- Open late. We need more of this in Atlanta!\\n\\nCons:\\n- They've jumped on the wagon of \\"we need valet\\" that tends to overrun this city. You don't. Especially for the small size of their immediate lot. It caused such a havoc for those just driving down the street past the place. If you don't want to valet, find parking on the street or use the garage nearby.\\n\\n- It's loud. LOUD. My bf and I had to keep yelling at each other - \\"YOU WANT TO GET AN APPETIZER?\\" \\"HUH?\\" \\"APPETIZERRRR!\\" \\"SANITIZER?\\"  F*ck me. \\n\\n- I know others mentioned this being tapas but I didn't go in thinking this and I'm not sure that is the idea. Although the term \\"small plates\\" in listed for the appetizer type stuff, I still expected a bit more. We tried the salsa verde and chips which equated to about 1/4 -1/2 cup of salsa and 3 fried tortillas you break apart for the chips. It was delicious but I expected a bit more. Shame on me. Tacos are small but so are many others at various taquerias out there and I don't call them tapas. Fish taco (grilled one) was a tiny sliver of fish, hardly enough to really get a feel for the flavor.\\n\\nI will return as we enjoyed the atmosphere despite the loudness.

The quality of the donut is better than Voodoo, but I'd still pick Voodoo all day.\\n\\nI think that I came at a bad time, because evidently they just make a bunch of donuts in the morning and keep going until they sell out-- so at the time we got there, there were literally 3 types of donuts.  Maple bacon, cinnamon sugar (BORING), and some lemon filled thing (which was actually really good).  If there was more variety, I honestly would probably have liked this place way better.  But unfortunately they have that weird system, so I'm just not into   it.

But I have been on a grain-free, sugar-free diet for a while and this place didn't have much to offer for folks like me.\\n\\nI do have to say that the food we did have was really delicious, I had some lovely BBQ ribs in a blueberry sauce on a potato salad and we had ceviche of course too.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a trendy place to drink and hang out with friends while nibbling on tasty dishes this is a good place for you.

My chicken tikka masala was an enormous portion, I couldn't finish it! Served with rice and garlic naan, it was delicious! The chicken and sauce were perfectly spicy, but still had complex flavors. Very good. Peter had the honey chicken, which was good, but kind of a dinky portion. He said he really liked it though, so that's what matters. All the food came out fast and was hot. We also had the Kiwi Kimono drink, and it was crisp and refreshing.

I really enjoyed all the stuff I got to try.\\n\\nThe second time was with my family and a couple of visiting relatives.  We got a huge sample of different things: from plain teriyaki for a kid to sushi for some.  I once again tried a sampler/combo plate which allowed me to try the soup and some other goodies.  Again, the food was very nice and everyone loved it.\\n\\nThe only downside is that once you're finished and ready to pay it suddenly seems like the waitstaff, who are admittedly all elderly japanese women, suddenly are hard to find.

We had the tortellini app, the parmesan haddock with vegetables and sweet potato fries, the stack of eggplant and meatball small plates. The tortellini app was a great starter, reminded me of a crepe, sweet and savory. The herb buns they brought to the table were yummy and warm, the oil dip was a little light on flavor but had grated cheese in it. I used sauce from the tortellini for dipping, yum. The haddock was good (not fishy), vegetables were tasty, sweet potato fries crispy. The stack of eggplant was awesome. I love eggplant and the strong tomato sauce and the 3 types of cheese. The meatballs are stuffed with onions (and maybe some other things) and drenched in cheese and the same tomato sauce as the eggplant. They were still hot by the time I finished the eggplant. They are almost like a meatloaf and I haven't had a good meatball at a restaurant in a while so I enjoyed them. We took half the fish and most of the meatballs to go because we were full. All in all we had a good time, no regrets, no tummy issues.

We were then quickly seated at one of their 7-8 two top tables along the left wall.  Three booths lined the wall to the right, and a long table for larger parties occupied the floor between.\\n\\nAfter mulling over the menu, the two of us decided to make a meal of a number of their smaller dishes.\\n\\nFirst up was the Datiles ~ bacon wrapped, almond-filled dates $7.  As scallop wrapped in bacon oft sounds much tastier than the reality with soft strips of bacon ringing the creamy whit flesh, so I had expected this dish.  However, I was happily proven wrong with the savory, salty bacon being of the crisp sort snugly hugging the sweet meaty date.  At a count of four, we each savored our two pieces.\\n\\nThe Maracuchitos ~ queso paisa wrapped in sweet plantains $5 was just as satisfying with sweet plantains sandwiching thick meaty cheese slices.  These first two were my favorites of the evening.\\n\\nThe Empanada Mechada ~ Venezuelan style stewed shredded beef with a fresh greens salad tossed with queso blanco, sherry vinaigrette and Mojo Criollo $8.95 arrived as a pair of empanadas sliced in half and presented around a mound of fresh salad.  The empanadas were pretty tasty, but I was disappointed that they could not handle our special request for a mixed set of one each of their two types of empanadas.\\n\\nThe least enjoyable of our selections ended up being the Mini Costillitas ~ apple cider, slow-steamed, baby-back ribs with guava BBQ, tapas-style $8.  While the meat was literally falling off the bones, the sauce was overly abundant.\\n\\nAs a light sweet ending, we opted for the Quesillo ~ homemade traditional Venezuelan custard with caramel $5.25 from the super short dessert menu which was recited to us by memory.  It was a bit airier and less smooth and less rich than the more familiar flan, but still it was a nice treat.\\n\\nFor bathrooms they have two single person spacious rooms for our comfort.

Our server (  I wish I could remeber his name) agreed and left for 35 minutes while my pregnant, hungry friend patiently waits. He then returns only to tell us that he had a huge order come in( group of 20) and they would try to get it after this order. What?!

I told our server, Alteriq, to just give me a supreme (everything).  This was a solid, cooked-to-order, pizza.  All of the ingredients were fresh and the topping proportions were perfect.  The pizzas came out hot from the oven and were served with a bit of Parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper.\\n\\nI also tried Lobby's fried calamari appetizer, which my friend ordered.  To me, fried calamari is fried calamari, no matter where you get it from.  They mostly taste the same.  Lobby's version is relatively less greasy and is served with two dipping sauces, a pepperoncini mayonnaise and a marinara.  I didn't think either were anything special.\\n\\nThe service, when we actually got it, was outstanding.  The restaurant was unusually crowded last Thursday, partly due to Summer Swag and the pizza deal, so the servers and kitchen were very busy.  It took a long time for the pizzas to come out.  Alteriq and the hostess were very accommodating.\\n\\nThe crowd at Lobby is diverse.  I saw out-of-town business people, moms who brought their kids (one in a stroller), college students, and couples on dates.  One of the Cheetah's most popular dancers was at the bar.  I only know this because someone pointed her out to me -- I wouldn't know.  There were actually a lot of beautiful people here, so the scenery is nice.  (I also saw Jarrett Jack in Atlantic Station after we left Lobby, but he was headed to Strip.)

It is meant to be shared and enjoyed with your hands, and entire tables are seen tearing off crepe-like pieces of injera (which is like a slightly sour crepe) and then diving into the plate. The injera is used as a vessel to grab heaping portions of spiced meats and vegetables. It is messy, but it is also fun, and invokes a feeling of community.\\n\\n Desta Ethiopian delivers on the complete experience, in a vibrant setting. Although the interior space is limited, they do also have a larger patio area outside to accommodate more patrons. While you can order rice or noodle bowls with a selection of protein, the better option is to grab an assortment of meats and sides, and then to share with your table.\\n\\nFlavorful and fulling, the meat platter makes for an excellent meal (although you could also go completely vegetarian). I am not sure about how I feel towards the salmon (since I tend to doubt the likelihood that salmon are a mainstay of the African diet), but the chicken, lamb, and beef were all superb. I'd also suggest swapping the coleslaw for the ater (yellow split pea stew) or a portion of miser (spicy red lentil stew simmered with berbere). The staff were excellent about monitoring our injera basket, promptly bringing us more within seconds of noticing we were getting low.\\n\\nFinally you've reached the end of the meal and after all the authentic and delicious dishes you've craving something sweet. You request a dessert menu or you try to peer into their display case only to find options like baklava, cheesecake, and maybe tiramisu. Strange right? Well apparently dessert isn't part of the Ethiopian diet so it is common to find desserts appropriated from other cultures here and at other Ethiopian restaurants I've visited. I didn't try any of those from Desta, but usually a glass of tej (honey wine) is the perfect end for me (although it can also be enjoyed with the main).\\n\\nDesta is a wonderful choice for Ethiopian when you're in Atlanta, and I'm sure I'll be back whenever I'm in town."},{"name":"NAPA Kitchen + Bar","address":"7148 Muirfield Dr","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"Went here with my prom group.

I will start with the food is amazing, but unfortunately I cannot overlook my experience. A party of 7, we waited an hour to get a table. Mind you, it's not because there were no tables available, we were the only party that was not being seated. We watched at least 8 parties be seated before us and there were 6 tables available. They then tried to tell us we could only sit outside, despite having 3 large tables available inside. Then after complaining, they sat us inside and we had to wait another hour an one half for our food. Again, not because the kitchen was slow--because large parties that sat down after us got their food and finished eating before our food even arrived. I then asked to speak to the manager who refused to speak to me (a blonde young woman). She finally came and spoke to me after 3 attempts and I told her that we had been waiting 2 and half hours and still had not gotten our food. Instead of saying I apologize, she looked at us like we were stupid and said well what do you want me to do with an attitude? I never wanted anything, just for her to care and maybe apologize for the service. She instead said well I don't know what u want me to do and walked away. I try to think of every excuse before I think it's a race issue, but unfortunately I believe we received the service we did because we were black. We were the only black party in the entire restaurant for 3 and half hours (bc that's how long we were there for). It's unfortunate because the food and waiting service (Cole) is amazing.

The server would have exchanged it for one cooked the way I liked but we were happy to switch because I loved the special tuna in grand marnier sauce that my husband ordered and he likes his steaks cooked medium. Another of our party members ordered the filet mignon and though she liked it, she said the cognac sauce was a bit overpowered by the peppercorn and next time she'd like to try something else.

Oh, and the guy who is tattooed like a reptile or snake (head, face, arms, all of it covered with green scales, amazing tattoo job) came in while we were there. I've seen him before, he's really nice. True local color, so to speak.\\n\\nAll that aside, the food was really good. And seriously plentiful. We had a full muffaletta (a great deal at only $2 more than the half) and a Cuban sandwich, with a side of cheese fries. No, we're not pigs, but we had a $20 coupon to use up, and figured the leftovers would make a good lunch tomorrow. And they will make a good lunch tomorrow - and the next day, at least. Holy cow. The muffaletta could feed four, and the Cuban could feed two. Never mind the fries. The muffaletta was not EXACTLY like the one I had in New Orleans 10 years ago, but it's the closest I've had since, and definitely the best. I think it's the bread (good Italian round bread) and the tapenade. And I could barely get my mouth around it, it was so huge. \\n\\nThe Cuban was also not bad, pulled pork with cheese and pickles and things. I liked the Cuban at Habana better, but it's like a different kind of sandwich. This was more like a Cuban hoagie. And the cheese fries were pretty good too. Shredded cheese melted on top of fries that obviously came from potatoes (rather than reconstituted potato pulp). The black mango tea was tasty and strong. If the sandwich doesn't keep me up all night at this hour, the tea might. I will regret having eaten that second quarter of the sandwich all night, but I couldn't help myself. It was sooooo good.\\n\\nThe staff were really young, but nice. The vibe is very laid back, and I'd bet the majority of patrons were students having night-time study sessions with beer. There is a big-screen tv in the dining room that I'm hoping has football on the weekends, because I've been looking for a place to watch football. And one sandwich would definitely last a whole game. There's a large outdoor area that is definitely dog-friendly.\\n\\nOn a previous visit we had the Sol taco, which is really good and also really large. Not crazy big like the muffaletta, though.

My pet peeve is they serve up your sides and you wait for your main item if they don't have it already ready. Husband ordered chicken fried steak which came out after he'd finished his sides. You have two options, eat cold sides with your main dish or warm sides and wait. Why wouldn't you plate it all together and deliver that? Bread pudding was like a cinnamon bun blended up with a cream cheese frosting (?) swirl. It was ok just not bread pudding (sorry I'm from New Orleans so my baseline on this is set much higher). Chicken tenders were large but not so fabulous I'd get them again. Chicken fried steak was so tough my husband couldn't finish - just got tired of the never ending chewing. Probably needed to be pounded out more. Mac n cheese was runny almost like a cheese soup consistency and noodles had no body- but I understand it's a style some people like.  Fries were ok.

They've been raving about it for years, and for some reason, I've never been able to go when they went here to eat. Until now! Unfortunately, I'm a little disappointed with my initial experience. I'm not really sure how I feel about Rangzen right about now, since the food wasn't obviously bad in any way, and overall I was rather satisfied with my meal. I guess I was just expecting to be surprised/amazed/knocked out of my seat by the food, and I wasn't. One friend who was there that night describes the food as \\"the kind of food that my mother would make at home, pretty simple and sort of bland.\\" Maybe I didn't choose a proper, representative dish (I had chicken curry... too generic? who knows) and thus didn't get a good idea of the sort of food that Rangzen serves. In any case, with my chicken curry, I could see what my friend meant by \\"sort of bland.\\" It was... sort of bland. It still tasted like curry, but it was just... flat. Sorry for the lack of vivid descriptions, but it was a very un-vivid dish. \\n\\nI'm willing to give this place the benefit of the doubt, however, because I tasted some of their dumplings, which WERE a little bit of a surprise. Being familiar with Asian food (even though I'm not Chinese, and my people don't do dumplings as much as the Chinese do), I feel like most (Asian) dumplings have a pretty standard meaty taste to them. The Tsel Momo was a completely different kind of dumpling. I couldn't tell you what the spices were inside that doughy wrapper, but that stuff was good. Not overpowering, but not... bland. \\n\\nBut honestly? I know nothing about Tibetan cuisine. So I'll be coming by again so that I can make up my mind about Rangzen.\\n\\nAll my ambiguous opinions aside, the atmosphere of the restaurant was absolutely lovely. Almost like eating in a temple, if you were allowed to talk to your fellow diners and eat meat...\\n\\nEdit! 11/23\\n\\nI've decided that I really like this place.  (Add a star!)  Sometimes I like being punched in the face by my food.  But sometimes, I like a complex, balanced set of flavors that are subtle, and that's what Tibetan food gives me.  I really need to learn to better control the volume of my voice, though.  There were many awkward moments when I realized that I was the loudest person in the dining room.

I've been going since the place first opened up as it was something I always passed by going to and from my work at the time.\\n\\nBut what made me want to try it? When I first moved to Boston back in 1997 (I was a young'un then), I heard the rumblings of a great place that sadly closed called Jaspers. The way it sounded, it was as if Boston lost something irreplaceable. At the time, from the stories I was told, Jasper White closed his famed restaurant to spend more time with his family. He took a consulting gig of sorts for Legal Seafoods and was the one that helped to transform Legal into the more upper-scale (upper-scale in this case doesn't mean good) establishment that it is today. When he was done with that, he decided he wanted to get back to owning his own place but that he didn't want to open up anything formal like Jaspers again. He wanted something to mimic his experiences as a kid along the Jersey shore and open up something informal where families could go. And that is where Summer Shack came from.\\n\\nLike I said, take the story with a grain of salt because it was passed down to me almost like stories of yore.\\n\\nBut anyway, to me, that makes sense. I never envision needing to get all dressed up for seafood. Growing up, seafood was about as informal as you can get. Raw clams and oysters need to be sucked out from their shells, not put on a mini fork that's brought to your mouth. Shrimp? You peel it and dunk it in glorified ketchup (cause that is what good cocktail sauce really is). The best seafood experiences you'll tend to have are the ones where you get dirty. It's ripping that lobster apart and sucking the water from the claws before eating the flesh. What's more memorable? The dinner for two at Atlantic Fish or that time you stopped off at a lobster pound on the side of small road in Maine?\\n\\nThe selection of oysters is great and probably only second to B&G. The mac & cheese is enjoyable. And I want to say that Summer Shack has the best lobster roll that I've had, although I feel like I had a great one somewhere else but I can't remember.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a place for that nice and intimate dinner, don't go here. But if you want to spend a few hours talking with friends, downing some oysters while having some beers and being served by a staff that is extremely friendly, then Summer Shack is the place to go. Are you a tourist in Boston with a group of kids and you need a place where you need to have options for the kids but you don't want to sacrifice a good meal for yourself?

My Caesar was perfect, just the right amount of dressing and portion size. We both got the filet and they were also cooked exactly to order and melted in your mouth. The dessert was small but at this point we were stuffed and I probably wouldn't have even ordered dessert had it not come with the deal. \\n\\nWe also got the blue crab cakes as an appetizer. Having lived in MD for 5 years most crab cakes disappoint, but these did not! Chunky crab, no filler and cooked perfectly. \\n\\nWe dined at 6 and the restaurant was empty.

A pleasant surprise. My friends all got sushi and they seemed to enjoy it. It was cold so I wanted something hot. \\n\\nVibe is lounge-y and modern. Very relaxing...especially with a beer. Prices are about average for an upper scale Asian fusion place. I think my meal was $12 but I couldn't eat it all. It took awhile for our waiter to come back with the checks and there were few people in there so I don't know what that was about.

There is an inadequate 1 person bathroom for Men and one for Women, not really enough for a restaurant this size. I feel bad for the employees who have to stand in line to use the restroom. The bathroom wasn't particularly clean, and it had a strange wide, shallow sink that made quite a mess when used. It would be hard to keep that clean under the best of conditions. The staff are pretty typical for a place like Atlanta; they're nice enough, but very young and raw, as much concerned with looking cool as with doing their jobs.\\n\\nI've wanted to eat at Flip Burger since seeing Richard Blais' first run on Top Chef, and I was ready to order as soon as we were seated for our Sunday lunch. That was a bit tough, since we were never given menus. I knew that I wanted the rBQ, and I opted for the Fried Okra and Spicy Chocolate Mole shake. My wife chose the Butcher's Cut, Jalapeno Slaw, and Strawberry Shortcake Shake, and our 3 year old got her usual burger smothered in ketchup.\\n\\nThe rBQ was everything that I'd hoped for, and I think that I could have eaten 4. The brisket was melt in your mouth tender, and the various sauces just upped the ante. The okra itself was flavorless and greasy, but the sriracha sauce made it palatable. The spicy chocolate mole shake was outstanding, worth every penny of its $6 price tag. My wife's butcher's cut was amazing too, and the slaw was ok, nothing memorable. The strawberry shortcake was delicious too. \\n\\nAll in all, a great meal. Not cheap, $54 with tip, but I'm on vacation.

Nonetheless we sat there for literally 15 minutes without being addressed by anyone. We watched one waitress just hang out outside, and two guys sit at the bar chatting with the bartender. About 10 minutes in, the inside waitress walked to a table near us, asked if they wanted any refills, and then walked back to the bar. For the next 5 minutes, all 5 people on staff stood at the bar talking to each other, doing nothing.

The vegetables were a few pieces of onion and mushrooms with four pieces of broccoli stalks. My husband ordered the spicy chicken which was dark meat which the chef combined with the white meat ordered by someone else at the table and then the \\"spicy\\" was a squirt of siracha right before serving. Since our rice was late the egg was barely cooked and not combined very well. Everything that did not have siracha on top was bland.

It's nothing fancy nor romantic. They play Ethiopian music videos where it seems as if the same person choreographed every single video. They kind of all do this same similar dance, leaning back and shaking their shoulders. I would suggest that big screen is unnecessary and just the music is fine. Our waiter wasn't too particularly helpful, not asking had we been to the establishment before or had we eaten Ethiopian food before. We managed to get the Ghion Cultural Special which included several dishes to try. Neither fork nor knives Ladies and gentleman, but it's pretty easy to do with the amount of sponge bread they give you. All of the items except for two were all pretty good. The plate more than filled our bellies and left our wallets lightly wounded costing only $25.

I did find the donuts to be a bit big and some in my party complained that they were a bit sweet, though not all were actually sweet. The blueberry, bourbon, and basil one comes to mind first. Let's make this simple; the donuts are very very good.

All in the sudden Gurkha came up our mind. We have been talking about trying it but I was not sure if we should do it at that moment, I have no idea what kind of food Himalayan is and I didn't do any research on yelp yet.. My wife said her Japanese friend love it, so we finally decided to go for it. It turns out a great try.\\n\\nI ordered Daal-Bhaat Masu, and my wife choose Salmon Poleko. I thought that was just a regular pan-grilled salmon, but when I tried a small piece of it I realize I was very wrong. It is very tasty, probably one of the best I have ever had in Vancouver. My meal is awesome too. The only down side is the amount of rice is totally not enough for me to finish 3 different kinds of curry. They are all very good and I don't want to waste them even a little bit. So I ordered an extra bowl of rice (another 3 bucks). The portion was not as much as we expected. Most time when we have dinner out side, my wife can't finish her meal and need to pick up about 1/3 of it. But this time she didn't even get enough. I did a quick research on yelp and found there is a secret dish not listed on the menu, yak momo. Has no idea what it is, but seems like it is a must-have, so we ordered it. It tastes very interesting, not a bad meaning of it, but I don't know how to explain it. It is totally different to any kind of dumplings I have tried or imagined, but it is good. We were really enjoy it no matter with or without the sauce. But keep in mind, it is gonna take 15-20 min and the price is not cheap, even higher than some entrees.\\n\\nAfter the momo we are 100% full and satisfied. There are only one waiter and one waitress when we were there, some people said they are also the cooks, I totally believe it. It took us a while to get our water and food, that is the reason I took one star down. I do understand it is a small business and they do the food seriously, but I still prefer to have my food as soon as possible. If we could get some small dishes or just water first it would be great.\\n\\nI should have spend some time watching yelp's reviews before getting in.

On lots of recommendations from yelp, we ordered the momo (dumplings). I shouldn't have, because I don't like basic chinese dumplings, and that's just what they were, but with thicker skin. But the sauces were good. We also ordered the steamed plain wheat bread, which was very plain, but I loved it. My boyfriend said it tasted like nothing, which was true, if you don't like hot yeast bread. I think if I went again I'd order a different bread, like the fried one or the one stuffed with butter. We also ordered one main dish, with beef and eggplant, that was pleasantly flavored but mild. We were stuffed, and had leftovers, and it was $57 including a generous tip. You can decide for yourself if that's too much. One thing to note: I hate cilantro, which is an affliction shared by a number of people. At Rangzen, you will be limited in your choices because almost every item is made with cilantro, and I got the feeling that asking for an item made without it would be an exercise in futility."},{"name":"Punjab Palace","address":"109 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Food was good and delivery fast, but driver tryed to extort more tips then he was given"},{"name":"Anna Bannanas NW","address":"1214 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Delicious Mediterranean steamed eggs, warming yummy chai, wonderful conversation with the owners, fabulous atmosphere.

Above the front door were signs offering a chicken wings and fries combo, which didn't feel like a good sign.  We walked through the entire, empty restaurant and just as we were leaving we hear a tiny little \\"Hello?\\" from a dining room.  A woman came out, who's English was very poor, and we asked if they were open and if we could eat. Yes, they were open and yes, we could eat.  That was probably the most clear communication we had with that lady for our entire short stay there. \\n\\nThe dining area had an okay atmosphere, but it was dark, the a/c wasn't on, and the tv was extremely loud.  The place was dirty and smelled musty, as if it had been closed for weeks and no one cleaned up before they re-opened.  It didn't smell like food at all. We tried to order drinks but the lone server/cook misunderstood everything we said - bringing us Heineken when we asked for Ethiopian beers, even after we pointed to the products on the menu.  After we were able to get her to understand that she'd brought the wrong thing, she went back to the kitchen for a bit, then came back to let us know that they have no Ethiopian Beers.  We tried ordering wine after that, and she did the same thing - went to the kitchen for a bit and then let us know that they have no wine.  At all.  We'd also asked for water, but none ever came.\\n\\nThat was about as much as we could take. I'd opened a Bud Light out of exhaustion of trying to get her to understand what I actually wanted, and we decided to just pay for that drink (with a tip) and leave.  We didn't want to take a chance on our food and bill getting messed up as well.\\n\\nI don't blame the woman there at all for our awful visit, she should have *never* been there alone.  From what I could guess she is probably a cook and rarely has to serve people. \\n\\nMy question to the owners of this place:  How could you have only one person in your restaurant, who speaks hardly any English, acting as both cook and server?  Why wasn't there at least 1 other person there who spoke English and knew your menu and bar?  Why wasn't the A/C on?  Why is the tv so loud?  Why did the place smell so musty and old, like a thrift store?

After my easily favorite place for pizza slices closed, Il Panino in Cambridge, I checked out lots of other places with mostly disappointing results and ended stopping by Davis Sq. Pizza more and more for a slice, partly out of convenience but also because their slices, while not consistently, were often quite good, approaching Il Panino's in quality. And I'm pretty snotty about my pizza slices: got to be thin Italian style with lots of cheese, and well cooked with hopefully a bubble or two. (New Yorkers sneer at Boston area pizza places for good reason.)  \\n\\nInitially my only non-slice order was/is a serious but tasty guilty pleasure: a small cheese pizza with bacon and pepperoni (Just thinking about it, mmmm....) I then got curious about other things on the menu, especially any Albanian specialties. One, the spinach pie, has become a regular item for me: a big square of cheese and spinach layers topped with ultra thin, brown, crisp filo pastry. The other I keep meaning to fast for a day to tackle again, the baked lamb shank: a large, perfectly cooked shank of lamb sitting on a bed of rice that has become infused with drippings from the shank. Mmmm, really tasty, even the rice (and I'm not a rice guy in any way), but way too much food for one person (although it is less than $10).\\n \\nNot really Albanian, although home made like the spinach pie, is the rich, brothy chicken soup that is served with a toasted half sub roll topped with some cheese. I order that regularly as a nice light lunch. Not so light is combining the soup & toasted roll with a burger, which I've had pretty good luck with. My $10 special (including tax), actually, is the soup, a Pepsi, and a burger topped with bacon and blue cheese. Another mmm... meal.\\n\\nAnother favorite food place of mine that closed was College Sub by Boston College -- their cheese steaks rocked and were worth both driving out of the way for and the high prices (and for smallish portions). Their steak subs were cooked well-done, which caused a lot of shrinkage. One time, out of curiosity, I ordered a large cheese steak at Davis Sq. and asked for it to be well done and put into a smaller roll. That worked. The next time I had it put into a small toasted roll and that worked even better. If you are into cheese steaks, try it.\\n\\nAnd for dessert there are some nice NY style cheese cake wedges that go down well (unfortunately they don't serve coffee, but if you happen to pass by any sort of coffee shop on the way....)\\n\\nIt is a family operation, very old school, and fun with some seriously tasty food for cheap on the menu. It cycles through wild swings of business thanks to people tending to order at the same time (5pm is such a witching hour) and being too lazy to walk a block or two to pick up stuff, but I've hung out enough there to see everyone scramble and get things done and out in an enjoyably madcap, multitasking, and \\"boistrous\\" way that only a close-knit family unit can ever achieve."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Blue Star Donuts are really great!

Have eaten here three or four times, and had several outstanding meals.  Once did the chef's choice and let the chef pick our dishes and the sommelier match the wines, they did an outstanding job.  One dish especially worth noting was a stinging nettle ravioli which was very, very favourable and unique.    Another nice dish was a beef served over a salad which was also excellent.  If I have any complaints it is that the wine list is heavily old world weighted and expensive.  I find that at nearly every Vancouver restaurant that serves old world wines you pay too much for inferior wines, when compared to the quality and value of new world wines.  No one disputes the classics - brunello is my favourite all time wine - but you just can't seem to get a decent old world wine at any Vancouver restaurant for under $100, which is simply too much for me.

I decided to be adventurous and try it out for dinner.  It was a Saturday evening and we arrived around 8:30 without reservations.  Understandably the hostess informed us there would be an hour wait.  We were starving and debated on going elsewhere when a server passed by us with a sizzling platter of aromatic food.  This solidified our decision to stay and we were lucky enough to grab a seat at the small bar.\\n\\nWe wanted to try an Ethiopian beverage, so my boyfriend had a St. George lager and I had the Meta.  Both were very refreshing and had a great taste.\\n\\nWe are adventurous and wanted the full experience so while at the bar we ordered a couple of appetizers to try...the sambusa and tomato fit-fit.  The sambusa, thin dough shells stuffed with minced meat or vegetables, was a bit dry but we liked the flavor.  The tomato fit-fit had a great flavor and my boyfriend liked it but I couldn't get past the texture.\\n\\nThe place continued to be busy with a wide variety of clientele, but the servers and even the patrons were patient and answered questions about the exotic dishes.  The menu is complete with food definitions and pronunciations.  We were having such a great experience at the bar we chose to remain where we were and ordered our meal.\\n\\nNarrowing down food selections, we decided on sharing the Lamb Tibs with injera and a side of miser...and proceed to enjoy one of the best dishes I have ever eaten.\\n\\nThe lamb was cooked to perfection...the seasonings were fresh and fragrant and the smell was almost as good as the taste.

There would be 11 of us going there. I was excited because I'd bookmarked them to try. \\n\\nI'm the first to arrive and I walk in. I walk over to a little two person table near the bar because I'm not sure how many people we have coming so I'm going to text the birthday girl and ask. A waitress comes up to me and tells me that she'll just move the number on that table because it's reserved for someone. I try to tell her I'm just standing there for a minute and that I have 11 people coming. She then begins to explain that the tables are assigned in the back and that people sometimes walk in and take a table that's been assigned (as in...what I did) and I again try to tell her that I can move it's not a big deal. Anyhow, in all this drama (which is highly annoying) I find out that you're supposed to walk to the back past the tables and order and then somehow magically come out to a table for 11. I agree with Michella S...they need either a bigger sign or a person at the door who tells people what to do. It's the most bizarre set up.\\n\\nSo we go to the line. It was very slow. I'm not really sure why but we must've been in line for 20 minutes and there were only 4 people in front of me. I order the Ahi Tuna burger and am sharing a large fries with a friend. I might've ordered a fountain drink but I don't drink caffeine and the fountain was not in view (I looked) and there's no list of what fountain drinks they have in sight at the counter (they did have some options I would've had). \\n\\nThe birthday girl and her husband had convinced them to set aside some tables for us (although I have to say that there wasn't anyone at the front of the line asking us how many in our party and running out to set up a table for us... so I really don't understand their concept). The food came out pretty quickly and the Ahi Tuna burger was good. It wasn't overcooked. The fries were good as well. It is strange that you then have a waitress at your table although because I only had water, she never offered to refill my glass (but if you have a fountain drink she'll do that). \\n\\nSome of our party ordered milkshakes. I was tempted to order one but I refrained. They allow you to \\"booze it up\\" by adding a shot of alcohol. However, they don't list the price and I'm still confused by the price on that. The bill came and it had one listed at $9 and one listed at $5 (for the two that had booze shots). When we asked the waitress she said the shots are $3 each. However, the math still doesn't add up. \\n\\nTo be honest, I don't know how I feel about the place except confused. The burger was good but would I be willing to come back, locate parking in SoCo and then have this confusing experience? I don't know that I would when there are a lot of other places to try.

It is absolutely the best experience and always a welcomed treat. \\n\\nHowever, last night, my very euphoric dining experience was rudely interrupted by a very disrespectful patron. Yup, this is a shaming moment and I don't typically call people to the carpet, but this time I am.  \\n\\nLast night, Desta was packed!  there were lots of parties and people waiting to enjoy good food and the company of their dining partners.  It was beautiful; the energy was buzzing, we had placed our order and we had a great server.  All was in order until the woman who poorly responded to the owner's request that she and her solo dining partner relocate to the bar upstairs so  that a party could use her two top.  The rude and obnoxious woman threatening to upset the peaceable order of all of our dining experiences responded in a loud, embarrassing and unnecessarily  hostile manner even after being offered a complimentary birthday drink at the bar.\\n\\nHappy birthday to the Grinch who tried to steal our Desta cheer!, but this is another example of why I love this restaurant. \\n\\n The owner could have joined this miserable woman and responded in an equally abrasive manner, but she did not.  She maintained the highest level of professionalism and honored the code that the customer is always right - although that sour woman was all wrong - did I mention she and her dining partner were finished with their meal?  Yup, they were done, check paid, leftovers packed and merely sitting and chatting. So, the offer to relocate and receive a birthday beverage was in their favor.\\n\\nDesta isn't just a dining experience, it is a portal into a cultural experience wherein the diners can come and enjoy good food, great energy and spectacular East African hospitality.

This is one of the amazing places that you go to and then swear that you will never go again, six months later you think it would be rad to go there again, you are wrong.\\n\\nIt's not cheap, the selection can be downright strange sometimes, the food is far from fresh, most of it is deep fried.  I do enjoy the potstickers, the fried rice isn't bad, the sushi is freaking scary (I mean who would really eat sushi here, wtf?).  All it has going for it is that you can eat all the garbage you wan't, puke it up and do it all over again.\\n\\nIf you are Calista Flockhart thin and looking for more of a Heavy D type body this is the place to fatten up and pack on the pounds.

They ask you to order family style which we did, had the pork belly buns, lacquered pork, shanghai noodles, and the octopus.  Everything was decent.  Pork belly buns were the best, the lacquered pork was a little dry, the noodles did not have enough noodles and seafood it turned into what looked like moo-shu (with just onions and sprouts) after we ate some of the substance.   The octopus was a little too chewy.\\n\\nThe service however was excellent and the drinks were good.

I had the falafel bowl with hummus, israeli salad, and a handful of spices.  The hummus was really tasty, and they didn't go overboard on the tahini like the store bought kind.  The falafels were super crispy on the outside, but flavorful and light in the middle.  I also tried one of the laffa wraps with shwarma, onions, hummus, and a few other fillings.  The laffa bread was awesome and WAY more food than you could eat in one sitting.\\n\\nAs the other reviews mention, I gave Yalla 4 stars simply because the service was SO slow.  We waited more than 30 minutes to get through the line.  Granted, it was a Saturday afternoon and Krog Street Market was crowded, but there's no reason their assembly line operation should move so slowly.  They only offer a handful of items and seemed to have more than enough hands on deck.  I'll definitely be back for seconds, but maybe during a less-peak time until they get the service going a bit faster.

Thanks to this community, I discovered that it is a really awesome place for the millennials (or all ages!) to hang out and have a great time. We went here for my best friend's birthday and had a blast. The food was fantastic, the bowling was awesome and the isolated ping-pong room was a ton of fun. A bit cold in that room, but we loved it! (Also, thanks for the chalkboard, because I quite enjoyed drawing a picture of Eleven holding an Eggo next to someone's beautiful artwork of the demagorgon.)\\n\\nNow, the reason why this review isn't 5 stars:\\n \\n-Finding the place: The signage needs to be improved for nighttime. I managed to spot the building because I was driving slow and saw the awning with two \\"painted\\" pins crossed on it. Clever. But it'd be much more useful if the one on the street could be lit up at night or a light installed in the ground to shine on it so that people could see where it is.\\n\\n-Parking: I appreciate the $2 valet. You can't find a better price for safe parking than right here. But is there some way that on-street parking would be available for those that choose not to pay for it? It's also not clear where you can enter the lot so I was really confused as to where to drop the car off.\\n\\n-Servers: I know it's busy. As a former server, I know it's stressful. But the first server we had ignored us when we actually sat down and forgot to put in some of our orders. Yikes. The second was much more attentive, though. We went in the middle of whatever parties were going on. And I don't think there's any reserved seating, it's more of if you find a booth, you grab it when you can. \\n\\nOverall:\\n\\nThe food: PHENOMENAL. I had the blackened fish tacos. I saw waffle hot dogs and if I wasn't on a strict diet, girl, I'd be all over that. \\n\\nThe drinks: The menu was definitely more tailored around the specialty cocktails, but it'd be nice to see a wider variety of draft beers. I saw more IPAs than anything else. We could also tell that they had some skilled bartenders because our liquor enthusiast friend asked for something we'd never heard of and he got it. He was very happy. So if you want something custom-made, I think they've got you.\\n\\nPrice: Well, you get what you pay for. The food and drinks were up there but it's a nice, classy-casual place. It's $35 per hour to bowl on Saturday nights, I believe, so I'd go with a big group of people so the cost isn't bad lol. But the other games are free! I heard there was giant Jenga and sadly I didn't see it, but I saw bocci, basketball and of course we played ping pong. \\n\\nLuckily for us, the wait wasn't awful, definitely not the 2+ hours I saw some people mention but maybe the managers can discuss how to make the logistics better when it comes to lane and table turnovers. Plenty of couches, bar space and other areas to just hang out while you wait to get set up at a lane. There was definitely a dress code because I think some guys in sweats got turned away. I had a great time, it was a nice open space with a lot to do."},{"name":"A4 Pizza Bar","address":"445 Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"LOVED A4. We stopped in on President's Day (after grocery shopping, ironically) because no one wants to cook a meal for themselves after an entire day off.\\nThere aren't many tables, but bar seating is plentiful and the staff helpfully pointed out that the seats at the end of the bar would be warmest since they were closest to the oven. They were obviously right, but another upside to this was being able to watch all the delicious, delicious pizzas get made. That oven works wonders.\\nWe got the margherita and the fennel sausage & pickled banana pepper. They were both outstanding and I can't wait to come back to try the buffalo chicken and the carnivore. The crust has that great crispy-outside-chewy-inside thing going on.\\n Great beer selection and super friendly staff.

Super out the box combinations ...sometimes a hit, sometimes creating concussion. Let me explain...\\n\\nStarted with the roasted beet salad; great flavors and easy to pick on the freshness of the source...greens make all the flavors pop and feels fresh and unique. For texture however, chefs went with crispy rice. I am not sure if this the actual cereal from Kellogs or not but it surely feels like it. I believe the salad could use several other options to achieve this texture...even bacon bits would have done better as the crispy rice still has that artificial sweet flavor all cereals have and in my opinion, cheapens the dish.\\nFavorite dish: broiled brussels sprouts with  bacon and hoe cakes...it all just comes together in a perfect sweet/salty/souring aftertaste that is quite afflicting.\\nBest items in the menu however are the desserts.

This was actually ok, since it was less noisy.  Tables are too small and the room  spartan  So ambiance aside, my wife and I found the food unremarkable at best.  I always make it a point to order duck when offered on the menu. It was certainly ok, but lacked any semblance of 'Frenchness'.  My wife had the steelhead: again, edible but unremarkable.  The escargot appetizer was disappointingly bland.  Service was very good, no complaints there.

We were seated at the counter (which you should ask for if you plan on doing the tasting menu).  The tasting menu was nine courses, which my friend said she really liked.\\nAs the tasting menu is continually changing, I will not spend a lot of time discussing the specific items.  Each course was excellent.  In one or two cases, the presentation could have been better - a light colored course on a white plate needs some more color.  I did the wine pairing also, and their selection of wines was also excellent.\\nThe general ambience of the place was rustic.  Most of thee items were cooked on a wood-fired stove.  At the counter, you are sitting at the side of the kitchen watching the chef's preparing your meal.

I was with a group of 8, and we were seated upstairs.  Since I was about 15 minutes late (sorry, guys!), I don't know if my group had to wait long to be seated or whatnot.\\n\\nI had no idea what to order, but one of my friends who had been here before recommended the tibs.  I decided to order the Beef Ribeye Tibs with rice and potato stew.  I had no clue what \\"tibs\\" were, but here is a description off Desta's website:\\n\\n\\"Ribeye Tibs (Beef)\\nTender cubed prime ribeye sauted in a special blend of house spices, onion, tomato, pepper, and Ethiopian butter.\\"\\n\\nDamn.  I missed the \\"onion\\" part of the description (oops - I hate onions), so when my tibs came, I picked out all of the onions - and there were a lot of them!  =P  And I guess looks are deceiving, but when I received my food (see attached pic), I thought it wouldn't be enough to fill me up.  Boy was I wrong...\\n\\nI thought the potato stew looked more like two spoonfuls of mashed up red beans (eek!), but it tasted alright.  The ribeye was flavored nicely with the spices, and it was good with the rice but even better with the warm pita bread, which I stole from a friend.  =)  I also tried a tiny piece of the injera - a spongy bread which tasted sour and a bit sweet, but served cold.  I did not like neither the texture nor taste of the injera and would never even want to sample it again.\\n\\nThe server hardly came around our table - and I had to stop her on the way to another table to ask for a refill of water, but it was a Friday night and very busy.  They tack on a 18% service charge for large groups (I'm guessing for parties of 6+).  \\n\\nOverall, Desta gets 3 stars - for good food and decent service.  At $12.50, my first experience with Ethiopian food was good but not great.

My group went to Hopdoddy on a Friday night at around 7:30 and we waited in line for about 30 minutes before we made it to the bar and another 10 minutes before we ordered our burgers, but it was worth every minute! If you're gonna have to wait in line, at least Hopdoody had the good sense to make the bar the first stop (which has some killer margaritas and local brews) AND have a nice young lady with a tray full of fries feed the hungry masses while they waited. \\nThe tables:\\nWe had eight people in our group and they weren't able to seat us at one table, but were able to put us at two booths close together. They don't have many large tables, mostly 4-top booths, so if you are bringing a large group you may not get to sit together, but once the food comes you won't be talking anyway; you will be shoving your mouth full of delicious burger. \\nAnd finally, the food. The delicious delicious food: \\nI got the Buffalo Bill which is a bison burger with bacon, house made buffalo sauce, and blue cheese on a fresh baked bun. I don't know the best word to describe how awesome this was. My husband got the Primetime which is a Kobe beef patty, melty-gooey brie cheese, a pile of caramelized onions, and truffle aioli on the same delicious fresh baked bun. Just amazing. Call it a pretentious burger if you want, but it was damn good. Obviously at a burger joint, the burger needs to be top notch, but I also think a burger is only as good as the pile of fries that comes with it. I am very particular about my fries and usually end up with a pile of rejects when the meal is over; either too floppy, too greasy, or overcooked, but I ate every single fry in the generously sized side-order and was so sad when they were gone. It's easy to plow through them when you can dip them in house made chipotle ketchup or their horseradish sauce that was so good I am still dreaming about it. They were trying their version of onion 'rings' the night I went and I hope they put them on the menu because they made my knees weak. Instead of the traditional ring, they take a whole scallion (or green onion to us southerners) and bread it in the crunchiest of cracker crumbs and deep fry it to crispy perfection. Please, oh please put these on the menu Hopdoddy! Since it was my birthday, I wanted a little something sweet after the meal and opted for the Nutella chocolate covered pretzel shake. Do I need to tell you how awesome that was? \\nIn short:\\nJust know going into it that there will be a line during peak hours, it's not great for kids because of said line, and then get yourself ready for the best burger you have ever eaten.

But they have some serious operational issues. We visited on a busy Friday night and was told that it would be a 20-25 wait. After 45 minutes my wife checked in with the hostess who informed her \\"we were next.\\" We then watched her seat thee additional tables before asking her what was going on. She told us that those parties had reservations, which his fine, but why not tell us \\"you're the next walk-in party but there may be some reservations ahead of you.\\" Since there were still several empty tables around the restaurant we grabbed the manager and asked him if they were just short-staffed or what. The manager apologized profusely, seated us and not only offered us an appetizer on him but also checked in at least four more times during our dinner to make sure we were being taken care of. We were, and the meal was very good. We had the calamari appetizer (my daughter picked it - it was your average calamari), my wife and I both had bento boxes, which were very good with a nice sampling of a spicy tuna roll, sweet potato fries, cucumber salad, edamame and a hamburger slider. Our daughter had the CBCLT burger which was really good, juicy, and cooked properly.   I tried one of their rotating craft beers on draft (an IPA) which was also a winner. We figured that they must have just been having a bad night on the seating issues. So......\\n\\nWe decided to go back this past Friday. This time we had a party of 8 so we called ahead. It was still pretty early (6:30pm) and they quoted us 25-30 minutes. Okay, so after an hour I saw the same manager and asked him if he remembered us from the prior week. He didn't, but said they had a lot of large parties that sat longer than expected. We were seated pretty shortly thereafter and then waited. And waited. For 18 minutes until someone finally came over and asked if anyone had taken our drink orders yet. At this point I was more than ready to leave and go grab something elsewhere but stayed because my parents were with us and they are a little old to be storming out of restaurants and finding food elsewhere on a Friday night at 8pm. So when the manager (different one) came over to ask us how everything was, we shared our experience and told him we had the same experience the week before. He apologized and offered more appetizers. Sometimes you just want to go out to dinner and get good service and not just free appetizers. After finally ordering (the kids ordered truffle fries and edamame, which they inhaled because they were pretty hangry at this point), we shook our heads as random servers/food runners came to the table with plates asking \\"who had the _________\\" (being something that we didn't order). This happened about 5 times after we ordered our meal and we were seriously considering just taking whatever came next because after finally ordering, we waited another 45 minutes for our food to finally arrive! \\n\\nThe food, again was good. My wife and mom ordered the bento box, I had the mushroom swiss burger, and pops has the all american bacon cheeseburgooshi (sort of a burger made into a sushi roll). All were really good. The kids all ordered various sushi rolls and one had the CBCLT burger and they all enjoyed the food. All in all, I think we were there for over 2.5 hours - more time than it takes to run a half marathon at a leisurely jog. Again, I really want to like this place because the food is really good. But it's just not worth that kind of wait. We're going to take a long break from this place to give them time to fix their service issues. We may eventually return as just a party of two and sit up at the bar where you don't have to depend on a hostess or server. We've done this in the past here and it was a much better experience.

I came to Tavern with my girlfriend and three other friends.  We are from Arlington and the Tavern has been popular with Arlington residents; however, this will steeply decline if my peers receive service like last night.  Upon entering the tavern, I opened a tab at the bar with my credit card.  When we sat down, the ambitious waitress asked to transfer our tab to her which we said was fine.  She came up to me twice saying that they had no record of my card.  I am a bartender in Arlington and if this happens we check all of the cards we have before we bother the customer.  Why she didn't do this and find the one with my name on it is beyond me.  Instead we waited for over 20 minutes until they finally tracked down my card. \\n\\nIf this was the only problem that would have been alright but while they were trying to find my card the bartender refused to even acknowledge that this was a problem saying that he had never served me and that he couldn't be bothered with my problems. If the bar was packed this could almost be understandable but it was midnight and the bar was slow.  After we finally got our round of drinks there was no apology.  We finished our drinks and ordered more but our waitress forgot.  We then waited another ten minutes before I had to get up and remind her.  She was in the area next to the bar talking to another waitress and had no memory of us waiting for drinks which were at the bar waiting for her to deliver to us.  From then on I went up to the bar personally to get our drinks.\\n\\nThroughout this whole process there was no apology or acknowledgement of awful service nor did they comp a round of drinks.  We ran up a bill of 105.00 consisting of 1 harpoon 3 vodka sprites and 15 bud lights.  If you are going to charge 4.50 for a bottle of bud light you need to provide great service.

Eighteen dollars for lamb is a bit steep considering the fact that it's maybe 7 or 8 small cubes of it.

My other friend mostly had bell peppers and I had maybe 4 pieces of veggies. Lol!!! Really?! The pita bread came out extremely late and most of us were done eating by then. The only thing I can say that was pretty good was the yogurt sauce and the hummus. The hummus can really stand out on its own with a side on bread. Now let's talk about the service.

Inside it says \\"raw, vegan, and vegetarian\\" which is a little ambiguous.  The food was clearly all delicious and healthy, but they served some items that I don't traditionally consider raw, like edamame, tofu, and peanut sauce.  I'm not saying they couldn't be raw - it's just that stuff I'm read suggests these things aren't usually included in a raw diet so I was a little skeptical.

I come here frequently for work lunches and in the past the service and atmosphere has been amazing. Today was horrible however. Upon entering the establishment with my party of 11 people, we tried to snag a table and were told in a rude manner by an employee that we could not sit before we got our food. We said that was fair and headed to the patio to see if there was space out there. We saw a long table but it was being occupied by a gentleman who said he was saving it for his large group of friends. We then decided to push some tables together to make room. The same employee who reprehended us inside immediately came outside to tell us we could sit at the long table and not move the tables together. We told him someone already took the long table, he didn't believe us and proceeded to ask the gentleman who gave him the same answer he gave us. He then said it was \\"okay\\" for us to move the tables. Thinking our experience would get better, it took a turn for the worse. We ordered a large amount of food and grabbed two loaves of bread. Someone from our party was unaware and grabbed bread from the general area so we had extra bread. We planned to return the unused loaves, but the same gentleman came back and interrupted our experience and said \\"y'all have too much bread, I need those two loaves back\\". He was acting like the food police and it was not appreciated.

Every bar and restaurant manager should know what seats at the bar are worth at an average restaurant, and what they are worth at their restaurant.  My head has a price tag on it, and on a special occasion, the price tag should get bigger.  When I arrived at this particular location the other night, this was such an occasion.  We were going to the symphony.  We had gotten there early this particular night to get a drink and a nosh.  Actually, I lie, we came for drinks in particular before the symphony had gone into a place before this, and there was no room at the bar so we ended up here.  Upon arrival we were greeted almost immediately, given a menu and had our drink orders taken.  Then the waiting game began.  We waited for our drinks, and while waiting for our drinks decided that we were going to get the mediterranean sampler, as we are both vegetarians and that seemed like a good choice to share.  She came back for our drinks, and we told her we were going to get something to eat.  Now, this is a particular situation that is open for interpretation.  My friend is a bartender and noticed that she really needed a barback or some kind of help.  Perhaps she was just slower than the average bartender?  Either way, she was making drinks not only for the bar, but for the entire restaurant, and as time ticked away, we realized that we were better off getting food somewhere else, as we were waiting what seemed like forever for her to come back for the food order, and god knows how long it would take to actually get the food?  We were only about halfway done with our beers before we were asking for the check, because we knew it would take a long time to get that too.  At some point my friend said \\"sheesh, you really need help behind the bar\\" to which the bartender replied, \\"oh no, I can handle it.  This is a slow day for me\\".  We didn't know how to respond to that.  Because obviously she couldn't handle it.  Obviously she was losing business because of it.  I have to imagine that if we were annoyed by  the situation, that other, less patient people had to be SUPER annoyed.  I don't know if I blame her though, she seemed like she was doing her best.  I think I blame management more.  There should be no reason that two people with an hour on their hands before the show shouldn't be able to have a drink and food.  Also, I blame Uno's corporate for the bathroom situation.  There was a line. And the restaurant was only about half full!  A line?  I had to cut the line because I wanted to wash my hands.  All in all, I would say that I would want to leave two hours to get food at this location, and frankly, Uno's ain't that great to want to leave that long just to get Hummus."},{"name":"Cherrywood Coffeehouse","address":"1400 E 38th 1/2 St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great neighborhood bar and restaurant.

The restaurant claims to be \\"asian fusion\\" but there was nothing Asian about it. None of the cooks were Asian and the menu presented items such as chicken & waffles. Don't think you'd be very successful trying to order that in any Asian country. I decided on the appetizer salad followed by the whole fish. The appetizer they could handle, but when I asked for the fish to be de-boned and the skin to be removed, they had to go back and forth 4 times to the kitchen that was right there. They said they could de-bone the fish because it's a slow night but not remove the skin. Apparently I should do that myself. This means that they expect their customers to sit a pick out each and every bone and remove the skin themselves. Lazy if you ask me, not to mention that it makes no sense. If I can remove the skin myself at my table, what prevents them from doing it in the kitchen? No restaurant has ever said no to that request before, not even the shady places in Chinatown. Tired of the mess, my friend and I ended up ordering - salad, lemon chicken, braised pork belly buns, and nasi goreng grains. Salad was decent but very sweet. Lemon chicken was a fried crusted piece of chicken with some rice and sweet & sour sauce in the bottom (still looking for the \\"lemon\\"...). Braised pork belly buns were comparable to the frozen ones you get at the supermarket. The grains looked and tasted terrible. As in one bite was more than enough kind of terrible.\\nOverall, if you want very sweet AMERICAN cuisine with a spice or two here and there and whimsy waiters, enjoy Myers+Chan.\\nIf you like actual Asian fusion cuisine, try Oishii right next door.

Well, you can call me a nerd, call me a fool, but I love Hopdoddy. The burger, the fries, the margarita - it was all spot on. I had the classic burger - lettuce, tomato, and onion - as I don't really go in for the fancified burger. But they have a good supply of those. Here are some things to know:\\n\\n* It will be crowded. But I think some of the buzz has died down, as we happened to walk in at 7pm on Friday and the line was pretty short. Things started to pick up after that, but lines weren't out the door or anything. However, Saturday looks to be a different story.\\n\\n* You may have momentary confusion about the ordering system. You get in line and order at the back of the restaurant. There is a bar up front, but if you are eating you order alcohol along with your burger. While you are waiting in line someone will give you a table number. You give your number to the order-taker, pay, and voila there is a table waiting for you. I found this to be fairly straight-forward but I see the potential for confusion.\\n\\n* It will be messy. The bun arrives with a buttery sheen on top. The burger is juicy, but not overly greasy. Fries are skinny and flavorful. So don't wear your fancy Prada outfit, or anything white.\\n\\n* You will pay more than you probably should. Two burgers, two fries (burgers do not come with fries), two alcoholic beverages = $39.00. The price point is the major drawback as it will keep me from eating at HD on a regular basis (and I'm dying to try the turkey burger). This would lower my rating to 4 stars if it wasn't for the:\\n\\nHORSERADISH HONEY MUSTARD. This is my new favorite condiment ever. I could do shots of the stuff.

There are several good Ethiopian restaurants in Atlanta such as Desta, Queen of Sheba, and Enat. However, Ghion Cultural Hall is the best...by far.  It took one visit and I was hooked. From the moment I walked in I was greeted warmly by the owner and was given a tour of the restaurant.  Although the formal dining area is nice, I prefer sitting at the bar and watching the very friendly Ethiopian women perform their magic.  As far as the food is concerned you can't go wrong.  I have been working my way through the menu the last few weeks and I have yet to be disappointed.  The food is always fresh and flavorful and also very fast which is amazing considering its quality.  The portions are generous and the prices are very reasonable. It would be quite difficult to nail down a favorite dish because everything they serve is so delicious.  But what I will do is highly recommend the Ghion Cultural Special which contains a combination of vegetables, tibs, kitfo and doro wot. This platter will give you the opportunity to experience the wide range of flavors of authentic Ethiopian food. Additionally the honey wine and Ethiopian coffee are excellent too.  In a nutshell,  Ghion Cultural Hall sets the standard for Ethiopian food.  Now the only thing left to do is to try it for yourself."},{"name":"El Chilito","address":"2225 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"My favorite neighborhood taco spot!

We tried their rabbit ragout and albondigas, which came with bread.  The house bread is hot and delicious.  The ragout and albondigas were phenomenal.

The girl at the counter was very pleasant and friendly.  She took our order and our name to call when the order was ready.  We waited for 35 minutes, finally they called my name and i raised my hand.  The guy brought us the  food, it was not our order, so he took it back.  We waited for another 5-10 minutes and I finally went up to the counter and they had given our food out to someone else with the same name as us. Those people had their food to go, they had brought it back finding out their food was the wrong order too.  Then the guy proceeded to give me the food that he had given them and put it on a plate as we were eating in the restaurant.   I told him I didn't want that food because I'm sure they had touched it to find out it wasn't the food they had ordered.  The server got major attitude.  He said calm down you will get your food!   I said I would prefer to just get my money back because by this time it had been 50 minutes waiting for two burgers. They gave us our $ back and made us new burgers.  We didn't like them at all the cheese taste fake and they were very salty.  The fries taste plain, nothing special.

Myers & Chang has a whole bunch of inventive options and a concept that makes it easy to try them all.  Here's what you should know: \\n\\n- The food is a definite fusion.  There were a lot of interesting dishes that I'd love to try.  This place also caters to those with food allergies/special diets.  Our server asked us up front and was ready to help with options if we'd said there were limitations.   \\n- The idea is that you order a little of everything and share it.  Plates come out as they are ready, so you'd have a hard time getting everyone to eat at the same time if each person ordered their own dish.   \\n- The portions are smallish for the prices, so plan accordingly.   I usually deduct points for this, but the food was fresh, different, and all elegantly plated; so I am letting it go.  Just know that you will probably spend a little more than you intended because you will order more plates that you would normally need.\\n- The service is great.  Use it to your advantage.   The server described the overall layout of the menu and advised us about how to mix and match to make a meal.  Once we selected our dishes, she told us that we might be satisfied with that or not, depending on how hungry we were.  We elected to give it a shot and did end up adding one more dish after we got through our initial selections.

Between the incredible staff, the DELICIOUS food, the price point, the atmosphere, etc., it's stiff competition. I came here for the first time in the Fall as I had just moved to Boston from the UK and this hidden gem is the first place I take anyone when they visit. This place is not just for young adults, but a fantastic place for any occasionÔøΩ? date night, family outing, and so on.\\n\\nFirst off: the atmosphere.\\nBarcelona's atmosphere could not be more ideal. Whether you're going for brunch or dinner, the way the room shifts between meals is stunning. This is my favorite location for both meals because the natural sunlight coming in through the gigantic windows is refreshing and positive. They also have a DIY-Bloody Mary bar (which I have not personally checked out since it's not really for me, but my friends and family have loved it). Even if you don't drink Bloody Mary's the bar is still marvelous and should be appreciated. \\n\\nNext, the food:\\nFor the price, the food exceeds far beyond expectations. Perfectly sized dishes, Barcelona is fantastic at staying true to traditional tapas sizes (with twists on classic flavors). The menu is great at pointing out which dishes (i.e. the paella) are slightly bigger and not served in a tapas style. For brunch,ÔøΩ?one of my favorites is the FRENCH. TOAST. I am not normally a huge fan of french toasts, but the light, not-overly-eggy texture served with yogurtÔøΩ?and berries is a beautiful combination.\\n\\nFor dinner, you really can't go wrong with anything you choose. Literally,ÔøΩ?every single dish I have had from here has been spectacular. My favorites include the croquettes (you WILL order several, they're that delicious), the kale salad, the albondigasÔøΩ?(meatballs), fried BrusselÔøΩ?sprouts, etc. I could go on and on. The menu does change pretty frequently though, but the classic, popular tapas are always there.\\n\\nFinally, the people:\\nI have never encountered a more pleasant, attentive staff than the people at this location. Patrick, the general manager, is one of the most genuinely kind people I have ever met, always making sure that everyone is enjoying their time. He is frequently out on the floor, engaging with customers, and it's not hard to tell that he really cares about his work. The servers are extremely knowledgeable aboutÔøΩ?the menu (I think they do weekly, group tastings? not sure) and will be more than happy to recommendÔøΩ?their own favorites. Jamie is one of the most personable and friendly waiters I have had. I always feel like I'm out with my best friend when we're seated in his section.\\n\\nUltimately, you WILL have a great time if you come here, no matter what time of day. I cannot say enough positive things about this place. The only thing I would note is to make sure if you're coming for dinner on the weekends that you have a reservation; otherwise,ÔøΩ?you might be waiting up to an hour or two for a table!"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Five stars except for the price: you could spend $20 easy just for yourself!\\n\\nFavorites: Magic Shroom burger, truffle fries, Nutella shake"},{"name":"Del Frisco's Grille","address":"33 Boylston St, Ste 3370","city":"Chestnut Hill","stars":"3","text":"Came to this location for Brunch (I normally go to the Seaport Location) it was good, a smaller space than I was expecting, but the interior was pretty and in a good location at the street.

Me, my girlfriend, and 2 friends were first heading to Matt Murphy's Pub on the same street, but was not interested by their menu, and we stumbled upon Orinoco, we took a gamble and we definitely won. \\n\\nThe Pros: The Food was definitely amazing, We had the Pelua Corn Pocket Sandwich, and I can eat that all day long, the Mojo sauce complements the shredded beef very well. Then I had the Parilla Caraquena, a mixed grill plate of Spiced Chicken, steak, sausage, and home-made fries. The Fries were a great surprise, me and my girlfriend were fighting over them. It was a over all great dish, very meaty and the Mojo sauce again, complemented the reds very well. \\n\\nThe Cons: It was my first time here, but I thought the mixed grille platter was great, but gets a little dull midway into the course. But I would never let one dislike solidify my opinion on this place! \\n\\nBut it was definitely a great eat!! I love the place and I am looking forward to try other dishes here!

The older woman surprised me with a to-go cup of ice cold water, which was much welcomed as the temperature was climbing to near a 100 that day. Even before I ate my lunch I wanted to write a good review for Pho Van because of the service. I thought, well pho is pho, so there won't be much to say about the food. Wrong! (Picture Charlie Murphy in True Hollywood Stories saying that.) I had the fatty brisket ( plus one other meat that I can't remember the name of). I think it was N5. It was so delicious! The main components of the pho, such as the noodles, broth, basil, jalapeno, etc., were the same, but the meat was extra flavorful and fatty, which I love.

Nothing in the original review violated a TOS.\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\nMy first time here, the hostess took a reservation at an extortionate rate of something like $50.00 for a \\"cancellation\\" fee without 24-hour notice, which if you're making a same-day reservation and are \\"late\\" or perhaps the \\"party is late\\" (I dunno) they assess the fee? Then I walk in and the place is literally empty aside from 5 waiters and the cooks. So rather than say \\"yeah no need for a rezzo, just come in\\" like any normal hostess, she walks me through this complicated nonsense. Jesus Christ.\\n\\nI had snapper crudo, pig skin noodles, shiitake pasta with eggs whipped to a near-foam, and some other shit.\\n\\nSecond time I came back, the valet just stares at me while I look for parking before sauntering over after I park to tell me I was in a valet parking spot only. He parks my car, but the place never fills to the point it needs valet. More make-work from this strip mall (can't blame Barley Swine for that, but I'll try).\\n\\nTHEN I get to walk into the main entrance, and the hostess turns to me and my date and says, \\"What are you looking for?\\" Holy _____, what a question: maybe a ____ing seat? Maybe the lost tree of life? Maybe a _________? I use the first possible answer - \\"Uh, I'd like to be SAT so I can EAT.\\" \\"OH! okay!\\" and then finds a way to seat me. There were like 12 empty tables outside, several empty tables inside, and several seats at the bar. We are sat at the bar, and I enjoy it from there.\\n\\nPrix-fixe;\\nI'll be honest, if you tell me you'll peddle 10 courses for $90, and 10 courses normally cost about $130.00, I'll go with it, until you tell me there's a 2-hour wait to get through it. So I can just order your entire menu, eat in under an hour and head out? I'll do that, thanks.\\n\\n\\nFood:\\nPig skin noodles are slimy little earthworms in what amounts to a hot sauce: nix this dish.\\nThe potatoes ferment under a bubbly yogurt ranch, well-spiced with slices of nut mixed into the deliciousness. I liked it, but the potatoes themselves seemed to have a kind of hot spice on them that countered the tangy ranch in an incoherent way.\\nSnapper crudo was decent, but the sourness of the fruit preserve / vinegar / olive oil thing was too much for the fish and didn't appear to \\"soak\\" in, which I assume was the point of serving it in an oily pool of that mixture.\\nThe lamb sausage came with crunchy wheat berries, which get jizzily soft after spending time in the sauce, olive oil and lamb grease. It was okay, but the rapid texture transformation (without much warning from the staff) was disappointing.\\nThe pork belly stuff was okay, but the rice cake was too charred and gooey to be the thing to fork into. You'd need to cut the pork, then cut the rice cake, then spoon it out of this okra-tomato sauce. Again, not good.\\nFinally, the best dish this entire place has is this shiitake ravioli - the pasta looks like a cubish candy wrapper, and once in your mouth you burst through the guts and release the fungal au jus. You have these spiced, charred zucchini, thin pepper rings and a whipped egg bed. I had this dish twice. It's the only thing worth ordering in the entire restaurant.\\nWhich, you tell me what that means.\\n\\nNext time, I'll just do happy hour, order five of those shiitake pasta plates and maybe one of the lamb sausage or snapper crudo and call it a day.\\n\\nEnvironment:\\n\\nNoisy, cramped space. Reminiscent of Jeffrey's, a similar disaster in seating.\\n\\nMusic:\\n\\n\\"Garbage.\\" Quit playing music. Just let us talk.\\n\\n\\nConclusion:\\nDon't come here for the food, come here for the show of wealth you get to make to your dates. Dates get \\"aroused\\" for capitalistic overtures. \\n\\nEdit: Yelp must be run by SJWs who read Vox and Medium seriously for the previous iteration of this review to have been censored out of existence.

Yet the really salty dish was the Pad Thai.  When I took my first bite, it already felt salty but I ignored it because it was flavourful but after a few more bites, I just couldn't take it.

The food always arrives quickly (a must for those nights I haven't realized how hungry I actually am), the portions are generous, there is *FREE* valet parking - so no worries Nikki K. and Stephanie S., they have a serviceable wine list and bar, and best of all they remember me every time I walk through the door! \\n\\nThat said, I have rarely explored the restaurant's full menu.

Being Haitian myself, I will be first to admit that Haitian's are very business driven but suck (I mean SUCK) at customer service, we need to work that, as it can be the demise of the business' very existence. The waitress's at this joint are just lame, not very dependable. They will get your order wrong. Other than their nice booties, (wink) they really screw stuff up and they do everything without a smile. I went there one time and they made me feel like I was bothering them (literally). I never physical eat here bc I always call in my order and the waitress's always rush me off the phone and don't ask for my name. So very often I will walk in like 20 minutes later expecting to pickup my order but only to find out (surprise, surprise) my order is not ready, registered or somebody else picked it up bc they never asked for my name (now I just offer it at the start of the phone call-this should never happen). The place is not to die for either, not too pretty but its \\"AIGHT.\\" The food here again is off the hook good (that is, if its available, they often run out of something).

This review is long over due. \\n\\nWe came here on a Wednesday night for dinner before a film. We made reservations for 6 at 6pm, a day or two in advance. I arrived quite a bit early, but was seated upstairs without a fuss. The staff were professional, warm, and well-mannered, but also LIKEABLE. You get everything you might expect from a restaurant like this (napkin in your lap, guess-the-fork-for-this-course-game, 3 types of water to choose from, etc.). But it always feels like they go above and beyond for us. It seems no matter what dietary diversity we present to their kitchen (in advance usually),  we are accommodated with talent and fresh ideas (our family has ranged from vegan to carnivore to gluten-free, all challenges that Pedro and Hiro in the kitchen seem happy for).\\n\\nOne of our favourite courses on Wednesday night was the sushi plate. When Hiro came upstairs from the kitchen to present his creation, I saw it coming from a mile away, and as a vegan with enough dinner blunders under her belt, I was amused by what exactly was being brought to our table. But everything on the plate was vegan! The \\"salmon\\" sashimi was a peeled slice of tomato with shiso (so simple and so brilliant) and the fish roe? Tiny bits of yellow and red bell peppers. It was so lovely and inventive. We also really enjoyed the chili oil quinoa topped with sesame leaf and a \\"fillet\\" of mushroom (which had been cut to look like a slice of fish). Our two family members who included meat in their dinner were also very satisfied with their experience. They had the same courses we had, but with a slab of red meat here and a breast of real chicken there. Nice wine selection (not that I consider myself an expert by any standards, but the list had enough variety that there were plenty of options and prices to choose from). All the staff (our server, the maitre d', the kitchen) ensured our dinner was completed on time for us to make our film at 8:10.\\n\\nNoise level in Coast picks up as the night goes on, adding to the energy of the atmosphere. The crowd seems slightly more conservative than a hip restaurant in Chinatown or a funky eatery in Mount Pleasant. A good mix of professionals unwinding after work and couples on dates. Cosmopolitan lounge music with a slightly mellow vibe. Nice, low lighting sets an intimate mood. Comfortable furniture. I read the yelp review of the couple who said:\\n\\"both times we've been seated pretty much shoulder to shoulder to other diners. Last time it was next to a pair of drunk businessmen who decided to listen in and join our conversation at one point.\\"\\nWell, I'd warn other diners that some of the tables are indeed beside each other like many other popular restaurants in Vancouver. So if you're planning on having a highly private, intimate meeting, maybe save it for the bedroom/boardroom. All those tables do fill up eventually. \\n\\nIt's not a mystery why this place is so popular."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Was brought here by a friend who had heard good things and was thoroughly  unimpressed.

Plus, their meet is grassfed and fresh. Maybe too fresh? ;)\\n\\nLocation: This restaurant is located right next to Drunk Unicorn and right across the street from Murder Kroger. Yes, there is a Kroger named Murder Kroger. This Chipotle is located right at the corner of Ponce De Leon Place and Ponce De Leon.\\n\\nParking: The only way to enter is only on your right if you are driving on Ponce De Leon, but you can make a right turn on Ponce De Leon Place and enter also on your right. The parking lot is PRETTY small, so it's a hit or miss. So please be warned, you might be waiting to for a spot to park for a good 5-10 minutes. \\n\\nVenue: This Chipotle location is well kept and I love the bathroom like windows they have on their walls you immediately see then you walk in. They have a dining place where there chairs, small tables, and booths are located for you to sit at. They also have an outside dining area for nice sunny days, so you can get your Vitamin D.\\n\\nFood selection: They offer burritos, burrito bowls, small tacos, and ALCOHOL. I repeat, they offer ALCOHOL. My favorite is their margaritas. This is one of the main reasons I choose them over Moes and Willys. Their meet is grassfed and they after a great selection of vegetables to put in/on your food of choice.\\n\\nI ordered: I bought a burrito bowl with half steak and half chicken. Yes, you can do that. \\n\\nPrice: The prices are a little steep here. For just a burrito bowl, I had to pay almost $10 and that was without gauc and a bag of chips. You have to pay a $1.25 for gauc and another payment if you want a bag of chips. That is the downside, because both Willys and Moes gives you chips for free and gauc is only an extra $0.99.\\n\\nAftermath: I didn't have to go to the bathroom afterwards and my stomach didn't hurt.

I come here for those special occasion cakes. So when I need a red velvet cake every year for the other half's birthday, or for valentine's day because the caramel pecan chocolates are some of the finest that I have tasted this is the place. I don't think I have even considered going anywhere else after tasting quite a few other cakes and chocolates. Don't get me wrong there are other places that have various other types of chocolates that they do very well but JaCiva also has their own chocolates that are superb.\\n\\nThe red velvet cake is what keeps me coming back. So much so that I have only tried one other cake from here and it was just as good. I think the thing with red velvet cakes is that I have had so many others that were not up to snuff that this one just blows me away. Most common issue with red velvet cakes is they tend to dry. Some places try poking holes in the cake and adding various touches to try to moisten the cake, this is not a good solution. Whatever magic goes on behind the swinging doors at JaCiva they manage to get this cake so moist and fluffy that it almost begins to melt in your mouth. Then for a sweet touch there is always a chocolate label on the cake that reminds you this place does chocolate just as good as it does cakes. It is honestly the easiest part of birthday shopping that takes place.\\n\\nWhat's even better is most times I don't have to call in an order since they usually have a few cakes in the case of various sizes. There is also a stand with cards if you are running late or this was an after-thought.

Granted there are still a good number of Shanghainese restaurants in town but the taste has changed to accommodate the taste buds of recent immigrants.\\n\\nModern City Chinese Restaurant is one of the few that still holds to the old fashioned Shanghai flavours; they started their small business in the Edmonds area and at that time they were just a husband and wife team, food was good and the place was homey!!  With business getting busy, they have since moved to two different locations and each time expanded their client base.\\n\\nI am glad to see that their latest move (its been a few years) has proven successful, it is a great addition to the west side of Vancouver to have this Shanghainese Gem!\\n\\nWe were there after 1:00pm and still busy with the lunch crowd, we ordered from the Lunch Menu, its just like ordering dim sum where you just check the items you wanted...\\n\\nXiao Long Bao - 4/5 - $5.95 for 6 dumplings\\nVery very juicy and the broth inside is super tasty, not oily or salty at all.\\nOne thing, the skin is a bit on the thick side but still good.\\n\\nWonton in Spicy Sauce - 4/5 - $6.95 for 8 wontons\\nWontons were Shanghainese style with meat& vegetables filling, the wrapping was smooth and thin (not the same as Cantonese wrappings), pork filling was done perfectly also. But the best part was the spicy sauce, with garlic and green onion it was just a perfect match to the wontons.\\n\\nMarinated Jelly Fish - 5/5 - $7.50\\nToo many restaurants did not do this right! They either under soak or over soak the jelly fish and thus unable to get the right texture. The proper texture should have a crunch and a light feel to the bite, most places nowadays, made the jelly fish too chewy and totally ruined the dish! Modern City's version was done perfectly with just the right marinate!!\\n\\nFree Range Chicken with Wine Sauce - 5/5 - $7.95\\nWith firmer meat then regular chicken, this is the perfect match with the wine sauce, the meat had the right consistency and had absorbed all the wine flavourings. Good value for this dish!!\\n\\nHot & Sour Soup - 4/5 -$7.95\\nThis is another item that has seen a lot of changes in the last few years, again Modern City was able to keep to the true flavour of this classic Shanghainese soup. All the flavourings balanced each other and other then a light sprinkle of white pepper, there is no other adjustments needed!!\\n\\nFried Shanghai Thick Noodles - 5/5 - $8.50\\nClassic done to perfection, not too greasy and filled with the \\"wok\\" flavour that is so essential for this dish! This is one of the measuring yard stick to see how the restaurant fare!

We weren't buying dinner somewhere else and bringing it in here to eat. We were having cake for a little kid. It's one thing if we were using their plates and utensils but WE HAD OUR OWN. The $10 charge seemed arbitrary too because one waitress had to ask another person. When I asked to speak with the manager, I was told the manager was conveniently not available. \\n\\nIt's outrageous for them to ask for a $10 charge for 4 adults and 2 kids to have cake in their restaurant. I'm not bringing anything in here that they make or sell. I would be happy to buy a cake from them if they sold it. Asking me to pay $10 for nothing? No thanks. Want to charge me for the milk I brought in for my kids too while you're at it? \\n\\nWe always make a point to come to this restaurant whenever we visit Vancouver, but we will not be back after this experience. The waitresses were less than sympathetic, kept repeating \\"company policy, company policy\\" over and over again. Sure, they said they were sorry, but they didn't seem sorry at all. Was $10 really worth losing a customer over? Why not be flexible and make a little kid happy on her birthday by allowing her to have her birthday cake?

As we were ordering, the waitress asked us \\"do you have the groupon?\\", to which we replied \\"yes\\".  This seemed strange to us, but we didn't think much of it.  When our food came out, my girlfriends scallops were old a fishy tasting - I literally had to spit it out when I tried it.  My asparagus was extremely short and fat and tasted horrible - It looked nothing like my neighbors asparagus.  The ribeye was tough, fatty and chewy.  All around an absolutely horrible dining experience.  It was clear to me that we recieved \\"the groupon special\\", i.e. old food that they didn't want to serve to diners who were paying full price.

For main course I got the okra stew with fish which I really liked but it was very gooey almost like there was raw egg in it so I felt somewhat sickly eating it after a while. My boyfriend got the jollof rice with beef which was really good bc of the red sauce it is served with.

My first impression set the stage for a long on-again off-again relationship with Hopdoddy. It was a balmy 105 degrees and my friends and I decided to trek up the SoCo hill in order to find grub and beer. Seeing a line out the door, we deduced that the food must maintain a reasonable level of quality and value to warrant this line full of zombies. We decided to wait. Unbeknownst to us, we had just volunteered to become part of the herd as it was shuffled along on the way to slaughter. The summer heat blasted our bodies as we wait in line, zombifying us instantly. Delirium set in rather quickly. The sidewalk turf quickly became hostile as the zombies fought for positioning for small clusters of shade. The situation became tense, as the mess of cows, waiting for their chance at the feed station, grew restless and hungry. We were on the edge of pure panic. We begin to think about exit strategies. If the zombies go crazy somebody and something needs to stop them. Just as I was considering the possibility of yanking a street sign out of the ground to use as a giant slapstick, I notice two small vats of water near the door. I have a choice in my water. With lemon or with cucumber. I'm perplexed, but drink. It cools me and calms me down. \\n\\nWe think that we've won as we narrowly escape the fiery inferno of the street and our faces hit the succulent air conditioning. However, we are wrong again. Another line awaits. I decide that I need to explore. I frolic and weave through the herd only to find another line awaits further up. Rats! It is at this moment, that clarity hits me. Hopdoddy has made a strategic decision to ensure operational bottlenecks throughout their ordering process to make customers \\"perceive\\" a higher degree of demand than what actually exists. Nothing more than a good old fashion ruse. \\n\\nOVERALL RATING: Reasonable quality, but not worth the price of admission or the undue hardship of waiting through that line. \\n\\nPros:\\n1) The Llello Pablano and Deon Sanders Burgers are pretty top notch.  \\n2) There is a girl that works at the SoCo location that used to go to clown school. I shit you not. Find her and talk to her. Guaranteed to be the highlight of your trip. \\n3) If you've never had the joy of experiencing all the pains of a cruise ship buffet, check this out. It's pretty spot-on, except the food is certainly better than a cruise ship.\\n4) They have at least four different types of \\"water\\" at various stages of the line, if you care about that sort of thing. \\n5) They market pretty much anything they can with as many froufrou health buzzwords as possible, if you care about that sort of thing. \\n6) They don't use a butter wheel on their buns. Those machines kill the environment and are simply not cool in my book. \\n\\nCons:\\n1) The staff doesn't seem to like it when you move your number to another table to be more comfortable. While I thought I was doing them a favor by creating yet another operational bottleneck, it took 3 staff members and a manager about 10 minutes to figure out why we were eating at an \\"unapproved\\" table. After they determined that we attempted to cheat the system, each of our hands were slapped and we were moved to a less comfortable position. We may have been put on a list that day also, because they seemed to scowl pretty hard at me from that day forward (except for the girl that went to clown school. she found it all rather amusing). \\n2) The line makes you feel completely vulnerable and helpless.\\n3) They don't serve large mugs of beer. This is unfortunate given the amount of screaming children and nagging wives piercing your soul as you wait.\\n4) No matter what anybody tells you, they cannot and do not retain the knowledge to poach an egg."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Their fried chicken is AMAZING.

From the second I tried to order a beer from our inexperienced waitress, I knew that the evening would be a drag.\\n\\nWhen asked what I wanted to drink, I asked what their craft beers were and got this lovely response:\\n\\"What are craft beers? You mean like... bud light and PBR?\\"\\nOh god. Seriously? Are you kidding me?\\nI settled for Rapscallion on tap and awaited our first batch of 30 wings which were actually not bad at all. Wish I could have said the same about the second batch which we ordered thirty seconds later and which tasted completely different and was undercooked.\\n\\nApparently the owners of Whiskey's are the same as the ones of the Pour House but it doesn't seem to show. I find the Pour House cleaner and much better somehow and I'm not sure I'd ever want to return to Whiskey's. Not a fan at all.\\n\\nPS: To however designed the bar and the layout of the place: you sir, have failed.

To me, Persepolis, is the epitome of delicious Persian cuisine.  \\n\\nImagine being 19yrs old and out of your parents house and going to school in a big city.  With my first big girl paycheck, I wanted to eat somewhere exotic and \\"grown up.\\"  It was love at first bite and I haven't been able to fall out of love with this restaurant since then.  \\n\\nThe food is just so delicious and healthy w/o being pretentious or expensive.  Coming from a girl who hates most carbs, the naan is wonderful; larger than the plate its served on, the naan is light and filling at the same time.  I could write poetry, novels, and books dedicated to their feta cheese.  This has got to be the BEST feta I've eaten.  Most fetas are too salty or waxy tasting, but this feta is everything you'd imagine feta to taste, strong w/o being overwhelming and tangy w/o being pungent.  I've tried the feta at Fanoos and Rumi and I thought it was straight up eating salt blocks, however, the feta at Persepolis is perfect.  I've tried most if not all of the items on their menu.  The meat is never under prepared or overdone but always tender and juicy.  It's as if the meat has been marinated for days and slowly cooked that morning.  The food is never dull and heavy (two adjectives I loathe with a passion when it comes to food).  The buffet is delicious and perfect for lunch but if you go for dinner, the naan & an entree is more than enough for two people.  \\n\\nSince I've been eating at Persepolis, I can't look at restaurants the same way.  Persepolis raised the standard for me.  Regardless of service (which is always excellent) I'd come back just for the food.  I've NEVER had a bad experience and many of my best memories were made in that restaurant.

First, parking behind the large garbage can is blocking the sidewalk and with the amount of traffic on the sidewalk on a Saturday, not to mentioned a police cruiser up the street, I didn't want to chance getting a ticket.

Coming from the south, I have pretty high expectations for fried chicken and biscuits, but this was far from what I consider good - even for the north. The smoked salmon was good - came with big slices of toast, greens, tomatoes, capers, and a small amount of chive sour cream. The oxtail hash was okay - a very heavy meal that needed some acidity and texture.\\n\\nThe bloody mary bar was beautiful and had a lot options (even a tomatillo base), but only good in theory. I think I'm terrible at making bloody marys because mine was lacking that delicious spicy tang despite adding hot sauce and lime juice. If you're an excellent bloody mary maker then by all means go ahead, but I think next time I'll leave it to the professionals. Being able to add my own additions (bacon, olives, sardines, meats and cheeses, carrots, celery, etc.) was fun, but without a good bloody mary, they're just snacks on a bad drink.\\n\\nOverall, brunch is just okay and I'd rather stick with the tapas."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Great food and awesome tasting mimouna & Morrocan Maria.

As much as I like coming here for the nostalgic value, Vancouver has come a long way in regards to food, and the price range here can garnish much in this city. If you are in for the trendy, then this is the place for you, with the all inspired 'RF' on the menu (Rob Feenie) that now they can ask for a higher price may make sense to some, but you are not fooling me, as I use to work in this sort of establishment!\\n\\nThe food is ok, across the board, but if you have been to one of these restaurants, you have been to them all.

It is this reason why I said I would only go with a coupon. With so many great spots in the Vinings area if you want to pay $12 I would spend it elsewhere. For $6 It was GREAT and more than enough food. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I both decided that the 1/2 was HUGE and the 1/3 would be our non-coupon choice.

Customer service was amazing. My boyfriend is VERY allergic to MSG and they were responsible with their response. The manager was behind the counter handing out orders and the man picking up trash was a real sweetheart. \\n\\nWe both got the 1/2lb burger combo with fries and a drink . The FRESH buns are AMAZING. I liked that they had the new coke stations because I prefer flavored sparkling water (yes, I'm THAT GIRL).

My seafood linguine had a light but extremely flavorful tomato-based sauce, and the seafood was cooked perfectly (especially the scallop -- yum).  I had chocolate chip gelato that was excellent.  Again, YUM.\\n\\nQuite unfortunately, I have to give service 3 stars.  Our waiter was clumsy and awkward, which is usually forgivable.  However, he was also just rude, honestly, and rubbed me the wrong way.  I looked longingly at the other waiters, making casual conversation and truly attending to their guests, while watching our waiter forget to bring silverware to our neighboring table on 3 separate trips.  He then dripped wine across our table after questioning my request for parmesan cheese.\\n\\nThe food was plenty to bring me back.  I'll just ask for another section. :)"},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We visited on a Thursday night at 8pm and the place was packed and buzzing. We took the last two seats at the window ledge and ordered chicken lettuce wraps, lemony shrimp dumplings, a Shanghai noodle dish and one with corn and octopus. The wraps were the highlight, very tasty. I wasn't keen on the dumplings as the \\"lemony\\" was more \\"detergenty\\" to me. The main dishes were very good but if there was one complaint it would be the octopus, which I felt was a bit dry and bland. The corn was delicious though. I had a Blood Lust margarita with Sriracha salt rim - very unusual but I really enjoyed it. Himself had the vanilla parfait with citrus fruit and it was sublime; a perfect compliment to the spicy food and drinks. I'm only taking one star off for the dumplings and octopus. If I'd ordered anything else it would have been full marks.\\n\\nLocation wise, it didn't feel ideal. As I said, we were seated at the window, and we noticed several shady dealings going down at the bus shelter outside in the hour or so we were there. That can't be avoided and isn't the fault of the restaurant but pay attention when you're leaving. Also, I found the ambient lighting inside to be so dark that it's hard to appreciate the food visually. Turn the lights up a tiny bit?\\n\\nFinally, though they were extremely busy, all the people taking care of us were extremely friendly and polite which was very welcome after some abrupt New York and Boston servers.

The Manager I spoke with was David Tai and this review is based on a visit to this Ruth's Chris from May of 2011. \\n\\nWe went here a few months back and the service was so bad we had to leave.  My girlfriend had a $50 gift card (and it's one of her favorite restaurants) and I had never been so she wanted to use the gift card and treat me.  We had reservations for a Saturday night and when we showed up the hostess promptly seated us.  However, after being seated nobody bothered to come to our table for 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes, we finally had the server come over and take our drink orders.  He helped us decide and it took us a few minutes to decide what we wanted after his recommendations and finally decided to try a new salad he talked us into trying.  It came a few minutes later and neither of us liked it so we figured we would tell the waiter when he came back except that he never came back.  We put the untouched salads at the end of the table and for 20 minutes nobody came by to check on us.  Finally a bus boy came and asked if he we were done and wanted to take the salads away.  \\n\\nFor one, the bus boy should have realized something was wrong because neither of the salads had even been touched so even if it was our choice not to eat them, he should've at least asked us if everything was ok because it wasn't.  You would expect that somebody at the restaurant would check up on people after bringing food to the table but it never happened.\\n\\nOn top of that, prior to going my girlfriend had been raving about their rolls.  In total we were there for 40 minutes and rolls were never brought to our table so I never even got to try the rolls.  So after 40 minutes neither of us had eaten anything as the only food brought to our table was the salad neither of us liked and nobody ever came to check up on our table.   The fact that it took us 10 minutes just to have our waiter come over and greet us was a bad omen for how the rest of the night would turn out.  \\n\\nI went ahead and asked the bus boy to get us the manager but my girlfriend was completely fed up at this point and just walked out.  I waited to talk to him to let him know why we were leaving and explained the following to him:\\n\\n1) 10 minutes to greet us and take our drink orders.\\n2) Neither of us liked the salad and nobody checked up on us for 20 minutes (the bus boy came before the waiter).\\n3) No dinner rolls in 40 minutes.  I don't know when dinner rolls are supposed to be brought to the table but I assume it's sometime early in the meal, well before the 40 minute mark.\\n\\nThe fact that we had barely seen our waiter in 40 minutes and we were both starving was reason enough to leave.  The manager was an Asian guy and he was extremely apologetic and friendly.  His name was David.  I talked to him for a good 5-10 minutes but by this time we were already at the front of the restaurant and my girlfriend was already in the car.   I told him we were starving and had not eaten and he seemed genuinely concerned and offered me quite a bit to stay but we were already very annoyed and my girlfriend was already in the car.  The manager even came out into the parking lot with me to try to convince my girlfriend to come back into the restaurant so you could tell the manager definitely felt bad about the horrible service we had received.   However, she was pretty fed up and embarrassed at that point because Ruth's Chris is one of her favorite restaurants and she consistently told me how great the service is and then after going everything was horrible with no customer service at all.  Eventually I'll give the place another try as we still have the gift card to go, but it was an extremely disappointing experience and some of the worst service I have ever received at any restaurant.  The only bright spot was the manager who went above and beyond to try to make things right but there is only so much you can do after being treated so poorly for 40 minutes.  \\n\\n-Aaron"},{"name":"Maenam","address":"1938 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I went here years ago and for whatever reason I never returned (maybe the spice heat was too much).

He say whenever I am back with friends drink on him.  I go back there many time but never dare to disturb him.  He was there yesterday when I was there."},{"name":"Fuddruckers","address":"3000 Windy Hill Rd","city":"Marietta","stars":"3","text":"Ordered a bacon cheddar burger with sweet potato fries and a side salad. If you like honey mustard dressing, be disappointed because they want you to get it from a dispenser next to the BBQ sauce, which is more of a dipping sauce rather a salad dressing. The sweet potato fries were soggy. The burger was over cooked, and I guess well done means no moisture. The bun was very good and the produce was fresh. Love the drink machine.

At late aft. on a Sat. it was packed. Beautiful interior but I wish they would list their offerings on the wall behind them. I'm sure they didn't want to ruin their lovely wall, but it makes things easier when ordering.\\n\\nStaff was super friendly and they even made me a new latte when they served it in a \\"to stay\\" mug instead of a \\"to go\\" cup. (I certainly didn't ask for it and even insisted that I was fine to drink it.) The crowd was diverse and interesting. The whole look of the place made me proud to see that Vancouver has finally \\"made it\\". (It sure took us long enough, didn't it?) \\n\\nStrong coffee reminiscent of a combination of JJ Bean and Revolver. Minus a star b/c the atmosphere is not \\"quite\\" as cool as Revolver. The taste was just a bit bitter to me, too, but since I don't take mine black, I might not be the best judge of this.\\n\\nI ordered a decaf that was still pretty tasty. Mind you, I was up all night afterwards, but I'm pretty sure that they weren't lyin' about the decaf part. :) \\n\\nIt would be nice if they offered some cinnamon/vanilla to add, but maybe that's just not the trend nowadays or is that too SB or me? I personally still like the extras on my coffee, esp. since I don't add sweetener. \\n\\nPastry case was a bit sparse, but I wasn't in the mood for ordering food anyway. I was curious about the Pain AC after reading about MD's experience, however.\\n\\nOverall, a great find, and next time, I might even hope to find a seat here, too."},{"name":"Hooters","address":"209 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Waited 40 minutes to get seated and there were plenty of empty seats.

The portion was perfect (although I could eat more).  I did have the option to buy kaedama (extra noodles) but I didn't want to pig out. The broth had depth and was delicious.  The spice level is not spicy for Southeast Asians or if you're used to chili pepper and not nearly as spicy as the spicest ippudo ramen bowls in Japan. I liked having the ability to choose the thick or thin noodles and how done it should be. I didn't like how they charge for each extra topping (i.e. Seaweed or green onions). The pork belly could use some work!

We sat on the patio and were presented menus so large that it must have taken half a tree to make.  \\n\\nAlways have a problem with restaurants that lack focus and have extensive menus, and this was no exception.  After much browsing I settled for a His bento box - fish and chips, clam chowder, and wedge salad.  I added a Spicy Ahi Tuna roll.  My friend ordered a salad and some rolls.  \\n\\nOur server was friendly, but a tad bit too excitable and eager.  My soup and fish and chips were alright - but nothing to right home about.  The myriad of rolls were ordered were OK.  We had some banana bread pudding for desert and it was oversold to us - it was good but not great.  \\n\\nAll in all the meal was OK.
