We decided to wait at their sister restaurant, Sen Yai Noodles and sampled their dishes while waiting (look for my review there as well). When we got back at Pok Pok a little over an hour; the host claimed that she had called me earlier (she showed me her phone with my number attempted to be called), but I did not receive any missed calls or anything. So as a result of that, we had to wait another ~15 minutes. By that time, the restaurant was about to close (9:30pm); but the host assured me that as long as they already got our name in the list, we could still order without any time restriction. Phew....\\n\\n(start of pet peeves...)\\nNOTE to ALL restaurants in the world; THAT'S actually how it's supposed to be done. When you say you're closed at let's say 9pm; anybody should be able to come in at 8:59.59 seconds and still be able to order without any time restrictions. None of those: \\"last call this...\\" \\"last call that...\\" \\"kitchen's about to be closed bla bla bla\\". Or even worse, someone comes in at 8:45pm and you'd say \\"sorry, we can't accept any more guests because we're closed 9pm\\"; Grr.... If you really want to close early, then revise your closing time to that time; don't put any unannounced buffer as you please....\\n(end of pet peeves... :)). \\n\\nSo to that, BRAVO to Pok Pok for honoring their own closing time! \\n\\nNow on to the food. In a nutshell, I was a bit underwhelmed. It was not bad, but it did not thrill either. We ordered:\\n- the famous chicken wings (both spicy and non-spicy version): Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings.\\n- roasted marinated game hen: Kai Yaang\\n- green papaya salad (Som Tum)\\n- some sweet pork belly dish \\n- some Isaan sausages\\n- and the special of the day: Crispy tilapia with deep fried garlic and tasty lime sauce\\n\\nOf all the dishes above, the standout was the crispy tilapia dish; its lime-based sauce was indeed very good. The others were just OK. Even the supposedly people's favorite \\"the wings\\" was just OK.\\n\\nAnyway, the service was good.

And with not a big list of Thai restaurants around the city, Pho Basil does a great job in not only dishing out very consistent Thai food but they also have an extensive menu to cover up a lot of Vietnamese food. Clearly it works. Here are my takeaways:\\n\\nLocation: 5 Stars\\nThey couldn't have found a better place for this not so big a restaurant. Close to the Symphony hall, Copley square mere steps away, Charles river walk, and Fenway not far either. Despite surrounded by competition along both sides of Mass Ave, the location is prime and a tourist central. Not to forget all the college students who make sure they don't miss a good joint.\\n\\nFood: 4.5 stars\\nThey have a very decent sized menu and cover all the basics when it comes to Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. We did not try any of the Viet delicacies but saw quite a few patrons enjoying Pho. So that was a great sign. We ordered the special Appetizer of the day - Thai Curry puffs. They came as a trio, tiny little pastry puffs with a finely minsed slaw. The mashed potatoes filling had a very distinct yellow curry flavor.\\n\\nFor our main course, we went for the Seafood Madness and the Fish Basil. The seafood madness looked good and I got a confirmation that the 4 star heat index (that's the max) which was requested really hit the mark. In contrast, my Fish Basil was really a huge dish. The fillet of fish was quite substantial and it came with a base of lettuce which I think managed to dilute the heat for me. But no complains. The fish was very good. I usually end up finishing all the rice that I get when it comes to my curry dishes. But this entree had all the lettuce. Next time if I order the same dish, I would ask to cut down on the lettuce so that the heat is more effective. Overall a great dish in any case.\\n\\nAmbiance: 2.5 stars\\nI am not too hung up on the fact that the place is not very big and that there are too many tables in the very small space. But I think it is good to know that not everyone would chose the place for an intimate romantic evening. But then again, some college kids might be totally cool with that too. A Romantic dinner and a lot of people watching. As they say, to each his own :) On a Saturday evening, pretty much every table was taken and by the time we were done eating around 6:30pm, there was a decent crowd waiting outside. I would imagine that would be the case during typical hours of lunch and dinner. And when tables are so close to each other, it can become a real scene of sorts.\\n\\nOverall: 4 stars\\nFinally, the service was really quick and efficient. The staff was very attentive and managed to bring out dishes really fast and were always on their toes to keep checking on everyone. The prices were right. And the food was good. I am glad there is another option for Thai food in the area."},{"name":"Baraka Cafe","address":"812 Memorial Dr","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"They just took over Boca Grande's location on Mass Ave in Porter Sq & I couldn't be happier.

They had a fried roll with crab and a million other things called the crazy roll and its now a new fave. For my next plate I got more sushi and fruit. The fruit was fresh and they had, pineapple, oranges, honeydew and cantaloupe. \\n\\nFor $11.99 you cannot find a better deal for fresh foods. After about 15 mins the place was so packed there was a line for the regular buffet items. This is a good sign to me because it means that people love this place just as much as I do. I don't drink sodas so with my lemon water my ticket plus tax for those of you who forget that its required was $13.07. This is amazing and my brothers was about $15 with a soda which is still a good deal. If you think about the fact that good sushi is expensive you will easily consider this an all time win. \\n\\nThe service was nice and the atmosphere was very chill. It kinda reminded me of like a dive bar, they were playing bruno mars and Gucci mane which is a great sign. They also have a huge sign on the table with pricing and other special to answer any questions you may have. They do this same buffet on weekends during brunch time for $2 more which isn't bad.

The long haired asian woman with strange blonde color doesn't seem to want your business. It only seems like they are busy because the place is  too cheap and tiny.  All of the white workers are really nice people though. The foods is so so I would rate it about a 3/5. Massive headache from eating shuyo ramen. Too much chemical induced illness from the MSG. Miso ramen tastes like vomit induced fatty sauce. It's enough to get you a heart attack. We saved the raw  eggs and fatty meat for our dogs cause they taste nasty.  The meat is of the lowest quality mostly fat fillers. Tsukenen dipping noodles have no taste. 75% of the foods on the menu aren't edible and we tried just about all of them to give the establishment the benefit of the doubt. Topknots Shoyu ramen in diabetic induced comatose sweetness. I guess it's great for people who aren't health conscious. I saw a Yelp review with a giant bug in a customer's food at Kukai (now called Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya ) pictures to prove it.  I am not surprised at all. I am just waiting for a picture of a rat to show up in the ramen. I am always weary of nasty customer services at Asian eatery because if they aren't  respectful to you in front of your face, who knows what goes into the soup behind your back. This was the same experience we had with this restaurant. The asian owner is very anal retentive. Never mind that all sitting patron paid for their foods, she would still going around complaining if you have your own condiment to improvise the nasty foods to make it edible. Instead of asking the customers how to make the food experience better so the customers do not have to bring in their own special condiments, the owner threatened to kick people out for not eating the way she wanted them to. Had this been a police station or government office, I can understand why people might be feeling like they are walking on egg shell trying to please the owner. But if you're paying for your meal and some dictator restaurant owner still harasses you for how you like to peacefully eat your food, this establishment is a fail. Just a very low class service place. It's like eating at a Kim Jung Ung concentration camp. Better say you like everything or else! Yes the foods are cheap but with cheapness comes with horrid customer service and cockroaches in the foods. I had to endure the nasty foods and horrible customer service because of one person in our family who happens to like 1 of their soups. Luckily we found a new place, Ramen Ryoma. Ramen Ryoma is leaner and has better service. Pho Tango off of hillsboro also has wonderful soups and their customer service are exceptional. I never found bugs, roaches, rats, etc like this place. You can also try Gingham Korean BBQ. They got amazing soups and they bend backward to cater to their customers."},{"name":"C&S Seafood & Oyster Bar","address":"3240 Cobb Pkwy SE, Ste 118","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great food and better  service.

We were going to go on a Friday night (foolishly).  It was going to be 6 people in our party, so we qualified for making a reservation, which we tried to do that morning and basically got laughed at.  So, we re-scheduled for Sunday.  Got there around 5.45.  The wait for a table for four on the patio was 30-40 minutes.  We opted for the drinks-at-Whiskey-Soda-Lounge option while waiting (I have to say that's pretty convenient!).  When we were called up, we crossed the street just as another group was heading for the hostess hut.  One of the girls in the group broke off and ran past us, thinking she would get on the list ahead of us.  It felt good to just walk right past her, hand the reservation stub to the hostess, and be seated as that group was told they would probably have to wait an hour.  \\"Smells like victory.\\"  \\n\\nI tell this story in an effort to illustrate what I mean by \\"Portland Dining Event\\".  Now, on to the food.  I'm not going to spend much time on this because it is thoroughly covered in other reviews.  Instead, just a few bullet-point-style observations.\\n\\n-Ike's Fish Sauce Wings are a must.  Get them \\"spicy\\" (unless you're a total weenie) because they taste better that way and aren't actually that spicy, anyway.  These are so fracking good that you are tempted to eat your fingers when you are done due to the sauce sticking to them.  PRO TIP: Order at least 2 portions of sticky rice per order of wings, then pinch off wads of rice to wipe your fingers on and then eat that.  That sauce tastes so damn good, it's a shame to wipe it on a napkin (which doesn't work anyway due to the stickiness).\\n\\n-The green papaya salad is definitely spicy, but very flavorful.\\n\\n-The Tamarind Whiskey Sour and the Tamarind Som are perfect for washing down this lovely food.\\n\\n-Andy Ricker deserves all the praise because this food is phenomenal."},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This place used to be awesome, but the last time I was here was 5 years ago.

We waited 30 minutes to be seated, immediately got our order in, granted she didn't hear me when I said I wanted hot tea. Then we wait another 30-45 minutes for the food. Mind you, my kids had pancake batter. That's it. So wouldn't you think that would come out immediately? No! It's batter! I've seen people get their batter right after ordering it and yet we had to wait forever for ours! Batter aside, my order ended up wrong. I'm very disappointed in this latest experience.

I wouldn't have eaten it plain (I've yet to get used to okra), but with the ahi it was actually quite good. I really enjoy seared ahi, but I asked for mine to be cooked medium this time around (they said it can be served anywhere from sushi style to well done). I had assumed this would mean more pink than they gave me - I would also assume they're used to people sending this back to be cooked more when medium isn't as cooked as people want it to be. I should have anticipated that, but it was still fantastic. The mac & cheese I couldn't finish, but it was also excellent, and sprinkled with black truffles. \\n\\nThe bf got the 16oz NY strip with truffle butter on the side. Superb. It was perfectly tender, perfectly cooked (ordered at medium). The truffle butter was downright decadent.

This was one tasty breakfast wrap and something I would get again and again.  Really enjoyed the chipotle pulled chicken - spicy without overwhelming the meal.

Just when I was about to give up my hope, Taipei 101 came about and changed my life in Orlando. \\n\\nWhen I walked in, I immediately knew I struck gold. Chinese international students and Asian servers who spoke Mandarin. These are all good signs. I ordered a pork bao and braised beef noodle soup. And goddamn, was I impressed!

I wish there were some better salads with \\"stuff\\" in them. \\n\\nDRINKS:\\nI'm not really into it, but people (young girls) seem to like the fishbowls which i guess are some kind of sugary concoction with liquor and liqueur in a fishbowl with several straws sticking out of it. They have a famous bloody mary that pretty much comes with everything you could imagine. It's like putting a whole breakfast into a bloody mary. It's a lot though and its not cheap so be ready for it. The beer selection is about average. I do wish they rotated taps a little more often. The cocktail list ok but there's one on there that I love and definitely recommend it. It's called the J.A.G.S. Mule named after several employees. It's basically a moscow mule made with absolut pear and served in an ice cold copper mug. It is soooo good and refreshing in the summer time.\\n\\nSERVICE:\\nThe staff at the nook are wonderful and fun. Definitely stop in for trivia night on Wednesdays (best trivia variety I've been to. I don't care for \\"themed\\" trivia) and karaoke is a good time on Thursdays. The staff all get involved with that! The bartenders are super cool and take really good care of you, especially if you're a regular. My only criticism is the service at the tables. I rarely sit at the tables anymore. I don't know why it is, but service always seems to be unreasonably slow when sitting at a table. So I always sit at the bar and my order seems to come right out no problem. And naturally, sitting at the bar your drink never goes empty.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE:\\nIt's your average tavern/pub/bar atmosphere. They tend to play a lot of 70s rock on the sound system, which is fine by me. It's better than club bangers. The patio is what makes the Nook so popular however. They are located right across from Piedmont park so its easy to pop in and grab a patio seat after the park on a nice day.

Not gonna lie, the food was pretty good. Its pretty pricey, but most tapas are. I had the ceviche island mojito and it was pretty darn good. I kept sipping it to savour the taste! It seems like a fun place to eat and have a few drinks but don't expect to be able to hear what the person you are with is saying..it gets pretty loud in the restaurant... as if the sound waves are bouncing off the wall and off to another table. You almost have to scream to talk to the person across from you. \\n\\nAlmost every dish we got was very tasty. I don't remember the names, but we had tuna ceviche, frog legs, chicken liver and mushrooms, artichoke bottoms with ham and cheese, and a couple of other things. The best thing was the artichoke bottom with ham and cheese, you must try it! They also bring you bread (i think its french bread) with some dipping sauce that was so yummy. Obviously, it being a tapas bar, i was not very full. So I kept munching on everything, making sure i ate every little sliver! Once I got to the very last dish (chicken liver with mushroom), I was using the bread to slather up all the sauce left in the bowl. Then I noticed something kinda hard and weird. That was weird...... then I chewed again. This time it was a sharp, jabbing feeling right into my gums! I pulled out a piece of what looked like to be a metal shard, but they told me it was part of the aluminum foil that was in the food when they prepared it. WTF! That must have been some heavy-heavy-heavy duty aluminum foil! I was PISSED! We told the waitress and she took the dish with the piece of foil to the back, and came back and apologized and said that the dish would be taken off our bill and they would give us free desserts. Really? Do you think I want to eat some of your desserts after that? Uh, no. So we just tried to ask for our check in the nicest way possible. Then the manager came out and apologized to me personally and said that they would discount the bill. I thought it was very nice of him to come out and do that, but he should have been the first one to come see me anyways, not that waitress. \\n\\nAnyways, food is good. I'm sure it was just a one-time thing that happened and it does not happen very often. Every kitchen has their mishaps.

Unfortunately, when we arrived home we were missing 2 Tuk Tuk tacos on flour.  When we called to let the store know we did not have our tacos, the Manager (woman) was rude.  She personally checked that order and remembered seeing the foil tacos, however we did not have the tacos when we arrived home.  We searched the car, went through the bags and no tacos.  Trust me Lady, with a 2 year old whining for dinner, we are not calling in for sport.  \\n\\nI ended up having to make a salad (defeats the purpose of ordering out) to stretch the meal we had among 3 adults.  During dinner, we decided she did check the bag by taking everything out and the tacos must not have made it back in.  \\n\\nHer attitude complicated an already frustrating situation.  Not only did we pay $11 for two tacos that we did not eat, we had to make a salad to stretch the meal so everyone had something to eat and we had the pleasure of the Manager's attitude too.

At one time, The Broker Inns in the Denver area were the epitome of excellence in food and service.  Now, the name has been sold, the name remains outside, but the name is all that remains.  Oh, that and the last remodel done by the Broker.  This place is dated!  Although it says \\"Broker\\" outside, it really is the Rodeway Inn and Suites, and here is my review of that place:\\n\\nI don't want to be mean, or take business away from anyone, but this place is a total anachronism - it's from another place and another time.  It's not very well kept, either.  \\n\\nIn our room, there were spots and stains all over the walls, a variety of cob webs, popcorn ceilings, poor plumbing, and a heater/air-conditioner that didn't work.  The remote for the TV didn't work very well, either.  Fortunately, we only planned on staying here one night, New Year's Eve, as a way to avoid the drunks on the road.  We would not have stayed any longer than that.  \\n\\nWe went to the bar that night, and found the ubiquitous cob webs there, too.  I was really wondering if anyone ever did any maintenance on the place.  This whole place needs a good scrubbing, and another coat of paint.  I did, however, like the sports memorabilia collection in the lobby, and in the bar.  There are a lot of football helmets and jerseys leftover from when this place was in its heyday.  \\n\\nOn the bright side, it only cost $50 for the night, $63 after taxes, and you just can't beat that anywhere.  Oh, and they are right across the parking lot from Carelli's Italian Restaurant, a liquor store, and the William's Village College Dorms.  \\n\\nIf you want a very cheap, no frills place to stay during a short visit to Boulder, this is your hotel.  If you want something a little nicer, move on down the road.  There are a lot of good, fairly priced hotels in Boulder, but this isn't one of them.\\n\\nOne more thing I remembered while checking below.

Halfway through the day, the tumblies started rumbling, and we decided it was time for an intermission and some noms.  \\n\\nWe had seen Shigezo on the way in, and Izakaya sounded good, so walked the block and swung back through.  \\n\\nHappy Hour on a chilly but clear 37-degree Friday afternoon.  \\n\\nI opted for a 22-oz Irish Stout (yeah, I know, because Irish Stout is a total symbol of Japan), an order of Nigiri Saba and a bowl of Tokyo (Shoyu) Ramen with a soft-boiled egg in it.  Brother, who hails from sunny and warm L.A. and was pretty much freezing his rump off the entire winter visit, ordered a Vegetable Curry and a side of Seaweed Salad, along with some hot sak√© to warm the belly and everything else.  Wife ordered some Gyoza, and we ordered a Poke for the table.  \\n\\nThe good: \\nThe Ramen bowl was excellent.  Broth was very flavorful, gooey 3-minute egg made a perfect yolky mess and added a much-desired creaminess to the broth.  Saba was fresh, but wasn't the best I've had, or even near the top.  Average. \\n\\nI didn't taste Brother's curry but he said it was great. The Seaweed salad we both tried and I thought it was very good and had a nice sesame flavor thanks to both oil and seeds.  Light and refreshing.\\n\\nThe hot sak√© was....hot sak√©.  It wasn't the best; it wasn't the worst.  I'm sure most of their cold sak√©s are of higher quality, but when it's frigid out and you're walking around, hot sak√© is a pretty welcome thing.\\n\\nThe not-so-good:\\nWe ordered a Poke.  I'm pretty sure this restaurant doesn't have a concept of what Poke is supposed to look and taste like, because this wasn't it.  What we were served was a perfectly adequate small plate of 6 small sashimi-style slices (3 tuna, 3 salmon) with Ponzu sauce all over them, a couple thin avocado slices on the side, and a pile of seaweed salad and sliced onions that easily dwarfed the fish many times over.  A proper poke focuses on the fish, should be a reasonably large bowl, typically tuna, with avocado and onion, and the entire thing diced and tossed together and marinated in a sesame/soy/onion sauce, with seaweed such as ogo, and perhaps a little Togarashi (Japanese 7-spice) and/or Furikake (seaweed/sesame seeds) for extra flavor.  It should NOT be sinply sliced fish drizzled with Ponzu, which is much more a dipping sauce.  I've had Poke just about everywhere, including preparing quite a bit at home, and this was no Poke by any stretch.\\n\\nThe Gyoza were just weird.  I don't even know how to describe them.  They were about 50% green onion, with some indiscernible meat (shrimp? pork? ...?) in them, and an odd tangy-onion flavor to the whole thing.  The wrappers were tough enough they couldn't be cut with a fork.  My Gyoza-tarean wife couldn't manage a second bite.  Of the three of us, I found it least offensive on the palette, so I took it for the team and choked them down. \\n\\nOn the whole, the food here is about average, service was acceptable, and pricing is okay for the area.  Plus, it was very conveniently located--we happened to be walking by anyway.  The Ramen was a lovely, warm and welcome bowl of noodly soup.  But with everything else, we've had a lot better Japanese elsewhere and may skip this next time for other local purveyors.  Or at least we won't order the Poke again."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"3410 Camp Creek Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I'm currently waiting in line at this location and there is only one cashier, while there are over 12 people in line.

A few seconds at the host stand for witty banter is all the wait we had.  The interior is casual, with high tops and regular seating, a large bar area, and an open kitchen.  Dark wood, lots of light, it's still got an elegant charm to it. \\n\\nWe are seated and given menus, and assured our server will be right over.  No more than two minutes go by (we were looking over the drinks menu) and someone pops over and says that she's not our server, but would be very happy to take a drinks order to get us started.  Nice! \\nAnother few minutes and our sever Molly G came by and gave us a fairly routine spiel about scrach bar/kitchen so modify your meal/drink,  allergen issues and their attention to not killing anyone (my words, not hers), etc.  We talk about how it's a team atmosphere and that's why someone else asked about drinks, and yet another person brought them. Personally that's awesome to me, I know some folks want to interface with just one person.\\n\\nWe ordered the tempura shrimp (with sweet chili) and fried pickles (picture above minus 2 shrimp).  both came out hot and crispy. The pickles were very good, with the batter sticking perfectly to the pickles and with Sriracha mayo and honey mustard on the side. I wish the pickles had a little more pickle flavor, but I think it's a trade off to get the batter to stay on.  The shrimp were awesome, cooked just perfectly (no rubber at all folks!) and a super crispy tempura outside.  Tossed in the sweet chili it was a very good starter.  6 large shrimp (probably 21-25) and no tails, all edible! Off to a good start.\\n\\nMolly stops back to check on us and take entree orders.  One Chicken Cordon Bleu Sandwich and one Fish and Chips.  Oh..and another round of drinks.  Molly asks if we'll need ketchup for our fries..yes!   We chat and the food comes out at the right time.  I'm not sure how long it was, but it was the right amount of time.  Brought by a manager, who wasn't sure which meal went to whom.  There's something you can work on folks!  He asks if we'll need ketchup and when I say 'yes please' he says he'll tell our server...WRONG...go get us ketchup if you ask.  Seconds later another server (or back..can't tell) brins us a side plate with about an oz of ketchup in a butter cup. Molly asked her to bring it with our  entrees!!! Perfect.\\n\\nChicken CDB Sandwich w/ Sweet Fries:  Chicken was cooked well, but the honey mustard sauce was a little heavy handed.  Sweet Fries were awesome!\\n\\nFish & Chips with slaw:  Two big pieces of Cod that were flaky as heck.  Downside they were on top of the FF's so the sog factor played in.  Slaw was house made and Asian inspired, I wasn't a fan but that's me.  Overall a good dish, could use more seasoning on the fish itself IMHO.\\n\\nDuring dinner 3 different folks came by to ask if everything was allright, which was just a little over-kill, but better than none.  Dessert was offered but since Ben and Jerry's is around the corner, we passed.  \\n\\nWill there be return trips...I\\"m about to go fill out the loyalty form online after this post!!\\n\\nBTW TV's for every view, but not all turned on...Good idea, game day I want the TV, normal dining no tv.

It looks like a fried dumpling or something. I could handle that. Rice? Rice is rice, right?\\n\\nAbout 5 minutes later, I had learned quite a bit. The rich, tasty sauces of the tikka masala and other curries, the addictively awesome taste of the curried samosa filling, the garlicky, buttery taste of the naan...I was hooked, and I made several trips back to the buffet to taste the other offerings.\\n\\nMore years than I'd like to admit later, Amul India continues to be the measuring stick for Indian food in my mind, and they've never disappointed any time I've gone back there for a meal with friends or family.

More on that later\\n\\nThe only reason we stopped in was because we were looking for Moody's donuts (a review on that to come shortly), but the food here isn't too bad at all. The panini was made on nicely toasted bread that the little guys ravaged.\\n\\nThey also had a live band playing in the back yard which the kids really liked. This takes me back to the 'Very Portlandish' thing - the people who hang out here are really like trendy-dirty. Not necessarily a bad thing since I was also sporting the too-early-to-take-a-shower-on-a-Sunday look. It's like the look of Portland and the peeps here do it well. It's like on the virge of grimy but with some retro fashion thrown in to balance things out a bit. \\n\\nAnyway, we like the place and will probably be back every now and then - mainly for Moody's donuts but the food and band make it a pretty attractive venue."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"It really is a city of books.

This time, I came here with Davel for lunch after going to the Japanese market a couple stores down. The side dishes were really good, even though I only ate what I liked (fish cakes and beansprout), and I tried the potato which was also very good. Davel got the sahimidon which consisted of raw fish, rice and a lot of vegetables that Davel spent the whole time picking it out. I got the bibim-bob and I was a bit bummed when it didn't come in a stone pot because that was the point. The egg was cooked and basically it was just fully prepared for me, I sorta wanted to break the yolk and mix it into the rice as it cooks, but it is what it is. But don't get me wrong, it was really good. \\n\\nService was not as I expected, I think it's because we entered through the main door as opposed to the door in the back. The waitress seemed friendly, but it also seemed like she wanted us out of there as soon as possible. We got our menu and when she came back with tea, she asked us if we were ready to order. We told her we needed a few more minutes and in literally two minutes she came back. Anyways, so as we were eating our meal she walked by and quickly grabbed the sauce for the bibim-bob thinking I wouldn't notice. I felt that she could've said something first instead of just walking by and taking it like a ninja.

The restauranteurs behind Eastern Standard join forces with the Island Creek Oyster team to bring great seafood and an incredible restaurant to Kenmore Square.\\n\\nFood: I've never had anything that wasn't delicious. From simple oysters on the 1/2 shell to complex entrees everything has always been great. The oyster sliders are a must; little golden-brown crunchy slightly spicy brioche sandwiches that even non fish lovers will enjoy. For brunch, lunch, dinner, or a late night snack there are a perfect mix of dishes to match any time of day. \\n\\nDrinks: ICOB has a great selection of wines (both by the glass and bottle), the focus is understandably on whites (although there are some very nice reds as well) Try the Westport River on tap (keg). The beer program is a smaller selection of well picked beers (both local and imported). Cocktails are well thought out, and the selection seems to rotate. The bartenders are also good at creating drinks based on preferences. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The room feels open and airy, it is trendy and hip without trying too hard. the main focal points are the wall made out of oyster shells and a large photographic print of oyster flats. Like most restaurants of this caliber, the service is friendly and professional, and the waiters are very good at analyzing how best to approach tables. It can be very busy on popular nights, so making a reservation is highly encouraged. \\n\\nFinal Thoughts: A must go! If you like fish of any kind, oysters especially, this should be at the top of the list to try. It is great for a quick bite at the bar, a more casual dinner at a high-top table, or a little more special occasion dinner in the dining room.

The answer was neither one of us really liked our entrees.  I had the shrimp and grits because I was in the mood for some comfort food and my friend had the chili mac and cheese.  The shrimp was not fresh and some of them had a meal-y texture.  Maybe I shouldn't have ordered seafood in Austin? The mac and cheese was a bit dry and not very flavorful.

I ordered the 1/2 rack of baby back ribs with 2 sides and the 2 meat/2 sides plate. The baby back ribs had a good smoky flavor which I liked. Unfortunately, they were extremely dry and over cooked. My order was made at 3:30pm so i can't imagine they got any better for the dinner customers. I could barely get a steak knife through them to cut them apart. I could only suffer through eating 2 ribs and the rest I had to toss so I basically paid $16 for two sides. The two meat plate I ordered was with the brisket and pulled pork. Once again, the smoke flavor was excellent. The pulled pork was my favorite. Very tasty, but a little fatty. The brisket was dry and chewy on one side and the side that was edible was way too fatty which ruined the experience. Again, not worth the $16. I did enjoy the sides I ordered. The mac and cheese was great. The baked beans were very tasty and the coleslaw was on point, but greatly overpriced since the meat was barely edible. I will probably never order from here again because it's not worth wasting another $40 (prices, including delivery and tip) for sides. I will just stick with Fat Matt's for my bbq needs.

It was a little out of the way, but I was excited to try it. \\nWe pulled up on a Friday night around 6p, and the empty parking lot should have been our first clue. But, we went in anyway. One very nice woman came over to help us, but her English was limited, so we did our best to ask questions, get answers, and finally place an order.\\nThe menu is simple, standard offerings like tamales, tacos, burritos, etc. Even chips and salsa are an extra fee (which is usually a free offering at the start of most meals at other restaurants). We ordered chips and salsa and guacamole anyway. My husband ordered carnitas, mother-in-law ordered carne asada, I had green chicken pozole, daughter stuck to plain rice and bean burrito, and son had chicken nachos. They do not serve any alcohol, water was it. \\nThe salsa was yummy with good heat, and the chips were fresh, but the guacamole was basically all chopped onion, with some tomatoes, and a smattering of avocado.The carnitas was riddled with gristle and fat, so much so that the hubby lost his appetite after eating only half. MIL's carne asada was about the same, only reason she ate more of her burrito was because the amount of meat was limited. My pozole was tasty, bu spicy, and green. I'd never had it that way. But, I liked it ok. Daughter's burrito was tasty. Son's nachos were great.

I can't recall the pricing on each item, but they start at 1.25 and go up to something like $3-4, for the better quality pieces. There's a happy hour deal when you eat at certain times in the afternoon, and I THINK this is acute, but you get half off each plate. I ended up getting about $17-18 of sushi, but when the bill came it was something like $8-9, which I thought was great.\\n\\nThe first thing I did was quickly pick up a plate and touch the bottom to see if there was any type of refrigeration being utilized here. I was nervous, because there wasn't. I have no idea how long they plate the sushi here, or how long it goes around and around on the conveyor belt. Without any refrigeration, and within a relatively warmed-up atmosphere (because it was chilly outside).\\n\\n\\nPROS:\\nColor coded plates made it easy to figure out the cost.\\nPretty good variety.\\nWater was re-filled multiple times, with a smile.\\nQuality was decent, with a light to nonexistent fishy smell, and a nonexistent fishy taste.\\nThe wasabi and ginger additions were pretty decent. Not that weird, metallic taste a lower quality can put in your mouth.\\nGreat happy hour deal, but I'm not sure if I would eat there any other time!\\n\\nCONS:\\nI'm not really a fan of the conveyor type sushi places. They get you to eat more food, and I'm not sure about the refrigeration aspect. I'm pretty sure some of the less popular sushi is out for a while.\\nSome of the items on the menu were so small it was hard to see what you actually picked up.\\nNot so sure about the lack of refrigeration...\\n\\nTHE VERDICT:\\nI picked something random up, tasted it, and realllly enjoyed it. No matter how many times I eat sushi, I'm pretty much always clueless as to what to eat. It was sashimi tuna, with little to no fishy odor and a relatively fresh-ish taste. Whatever, I was in Portland, so I took a chance and ate a few more plates, and I'm glad I did. The wait staff is pretty efficient, and good at making sure you have water. I would eat here around lunch (when the happy hour deal is going on), when there's a higher turnover rate with the sushi being picked up. It makes me nervous about how long the sushi is out... At any rate, I feel pretty proud of myself for being so brave and trying a place like this out. Definitely not the type of sushi place I'd usually go to."},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Not sure what the hype is about.

Our server was attentive and gave me extra hot sauce for the Omelet without I had to ask for one. The only downside about this place for me is still the noise level inside the restaurant. The place is tiny with low ceilings. When there are other tables (loud mouth middle age ladies) whom didn't care about eardrums of other patrons (Jesse & I), the whole dining experience ended up just being so so. This place is totally not good for first date, but it's awesome for people who don't care to make conversation during their dinner time. \\n\\nI don't know when I will be back again since I will probably end up at Whiskey Soda Lounge more often just because it's not so loud over there or I will bring ear plugs."},{"name":"Barlow","address":"737 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"At first, it seemed like we had a decent experience there.

I'm not really sure where that was going but he seemed to really enjoy it! Next was a salad. This looked really yummy and fresh. Unfortunately mine did not come with salad dressing so I mixed a few lettuce pieces with my boyfriend's to give my dry salad a bit of flavor. A simple mistake I'm sure. For the entree the carnivore's had a choice of prime ribeye, tazmanian salmon, or duck. Most everyone around me ordered the steak and they all loved it!

They were all very good, but I have to say that the majority of it wasn't what I told the server I wanted. I assume they were a few things that were not able to be made vegetarian, which I totally understand. But the server should have known this and limited my choices. Dessert was decent. We had a choice between a creme brulee and a chocolate chocolatey thing. We always choose to get one of each so we can try each others and share. The creme brulee was to die for! The chocolate dish--unless you haven't had chocolate in the last 20 years and you're really wanting it, I mean, realllllly wanting it then get it. Otherwise, I'd stick with the creme brulee due to fear of overdosing ( it's a bit rich!). \\nOverall I had a good experience at Rathbun's steak. I would just recommend maybe being a meat eater when you visit.

There are a couple of smell settees (English word for sofas) with a selection of Vogues and GQs strategically placed on light wooden coffee tables.

The curry doesn't separate if left for a while as I've found that some other places, you'll see separation of the coconut milk.   The eggplant dish was really good.   It wasn't salty, bland or mushy.  \\n\\nI like this place better than Thai House although the service at Thai House is better, but that could be because U & I Thai is always busy.

Lightly breaded chicken, with mushrooms, topped with mozzarella cheese over fettuccini in a cream sauce, putting it mildly its the reason I come here!

Not sure if it's the new management as I've never been here before. I ordered a spicy Chicken Vindaloo with a side of naan. The vindaloo wasn't very spicy and the overall flavor was OK, however it wasn't as great as I've had at other Indian restaurants or carts. Not bad, but just not anything to write home about. The naan seemed like it had been cooked a long time ago, where it was folded in half in the foil it actually broke in two pieces like what I'd expect if you folded a raw corn tortilla. The naan I've had elsewhere seemed more soft and pliable. Since I don't know of any other carts in the area I'll likely go back here when I'm in a hurry, however the lunch buffet at Swagat in Beaverton is a much better option if you want excellent Indian food.

Needless to say I was badly in need of a drink (or ten). We found a table outside on the charming patio lit with adorable string lights (this was thrilling as tables on Friday at 8:30 in Austin are not always easy to come by). It was all very New Orleans/Southern-charm-meets-rockabilly-meets-speakeasy, which made for good ambience. A waiter literally zoomed up and provided us with water before we could turn our heads. In fact, the waiters do a lot of zooming. They are very efficient. Suspiciously efficient for Austin, honestly. Slacker culture is impressively not at work here. The patio was quiet enough for conversation, which I really appreciated. Our waiter was very polite and when one of our friends ordered a Bijou, a drink he hadn't heard of, he listened patiently while she explained the ingredients. My french-75 was awesome--not too sweet and with an artful orange garnish to boot. My beau had a martini, which was also very good, although I can't really speak to that because all martinis just taste like alcohol to me (no sophistication). Our friends got a meat and cheese plate which also looked great.  \\n\\nPros: Cool venue, neat speakeasy vibe because shabby looking house exterior/classy interior (I don't know why this adds so many points for me ....), tasty drinks, efficient zooming waiters, comparatively low volume, string lights, \\n\\nCons: Price point is at 10-12$ per cocktail, which is the norm for the area but still too high to drink sans guilt what with my law student budget.

Then why am I paying $10 for it?\\n\\nI couldn't find anything on their menu that would appease this gal who happens to be on a diet, so I requested their house salad and added on some shrimp, which was also not on the menu. When my salad arrived, I was presented with 6 teeny tiny shrimp. I understand that the word \\"shrimp\\" can mean \\"small\\", but come on!  Also, the salad was room-temperature which was not particularly appetizing to me. I don't require salads to be ice-cold but refrigerating your greens before serving is probably a good thing.\\n\\nWe had another friend join us maybe 30 minutes after I arrived, and when our waitress came back to get the next beer orders for the rest of the table, she completely ignored his arrival. She then came back around 10 mins after that and ask if he'd like a water and what kind of beer.\\n\\nAlso, my friends hated the nacho totchos they got. I've had them before didn't like them either. We've also had the breakfast totchos. I don't know, I think some people just like to feel like their eating something unique and kitschy... but I don't think it tastes that good.  I ordered some plain tots which I enjoyed much more than any totcho dish I've gotten.\\n\\nOverall, service was painfully slow. I asked for our checks, watched her meander around the bar and chit chat with co-workers for about 10 minutes, and then return to our table... with no checks. I could have done a better job serving myself- but oh wait, that's what you are paying for when you go to a restaurant.\\n\\n(Note that in addition to this single experience, I was also Taylor A's dining companion for his review on 2/22/10)\\n\\nBesides the prime location, Nook just does not have anything going for them."},{"name":"Gennaro's Eatery","address":"12 Blanchard Rd","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"I had take out before.

We had Saturday 8pm reservations and showed up a bit late. The restaurant wasn't busy- there were only 2 or 3 other tables. There was a guy singing and playing the guitar, which was really cute. We ordered drinks and entrees. My friend ordered an old fashioned, but the bartender said she didn't have all the ingredients to make it, so she gave him a whiskey & soda instead. I ordered the apple cider martini ($10 each) which were as delicious as last time but not as strong. \\n\\nThe waitress was slow, despite the fact that it was pretty empty. We were ordering drinks as fast as we could, but I only got through 3 throughout the entire 1.5 hours we were there- she avoided us for most of the time and we had empty glasses for some of the time. We both ordered entrees only- I ordered a burger ($9) with truffle fries ($3), and my friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries. We waited about an hour for our food. The waitress came over to apologize and said that their kitchen was slammed from the restaurant next door, which they apparently own. At one point, about 45-50 min in, we asked for truffles fries or bread or something since we were starving. The waitress basically told us that she'd try, but our food would probably come out before she could give us anything else, which was a bit ridiculous. (Although, to be fair, the food did come soonish after that). \\n\\nWhen we finally got our food, the burger was delicious, as were the truffle fries. However, I asked for bacon on my burger and there was none. We had waited too long for me to care, so I didn't bother asking for her to fix it. \\n\\nThe restaurant is cute, and a great spot to go talk over food and cocktails on a weekend night.

For some reason this wasn't as buttery and was no different than normal filets. The sour cream mash was divine. The lobster Mac and cheese was a bit over baked and was drier than most other steakhouses. It lacked the melted gooey cheese effect. The Brussels sprouts were larger so it didn't pack all the flavors as smaller Brussels sprouts would have been able to hold. The oysters on a half shell was delicious! The shoestring fries are a must have! They were perfectly seasoned and not overly crispy. The souffl√© was very light and airy but the sauce made it too sweet. We should have tried it before pouring it all into the souffl√©. It was a great time with friends but I did have higher expectations for the food.

Yeah, there's no arguing the fact that the food rocks; people who say it's not delicious are lying. With 1600+ reviews, I am not going to echo the statements of so many others. I've been coming here since the beginning. I am a fan of all of Andy Ricker's endeavors. I took my girlfriend here several years ago on our very first date, so it even has it sentimental appeal for us. It would be safe to say that we love all things Pok Pok.\\n\\nHere is what Pok Pok needs to address: the shit attitude maintained by some of the servers I've experienced on several occasions. I am a curteous diner, and an excellent tipper, yet nearly every time we visit Pok Pok, I am treated like it's my first time there, as if I don't understand the cuisine. I'm not a vacationing visitor or an international food rookie. I like it hot, salty, spicy, sweet, however Pok Pok wants to throw it at me, I'm game. I just don't need too-cool hipster servers looking down their noses at me. \\n\\nThis is the problem with today's Portland food scene. This passive-agressive attitude DOES NOT FLY in any other nationally recognized food scene. Portland should be no exception. This is a service based industry. Get with it. \\n\\nPok Pok's food and preparation deserves 5+ stars in my book. I love it. I also love Pok Pok Noi, especially for the less pretentious attitude and easier dining options, although every time I show up at either location, I drop no less than a hundred dollar bill. \\n\\nJust work on the attitude, guys. Please. I am tired of raving about your establishment and then hearing from friends and family that they experienced rude and generally insulting service.

A pleasant one at that.I have been here several times for family functions and they have always gone off without a hitch. Located right on Mystic Ave, it can be easily past by as there are so many plaza's and building on the road. BE on the lookout-you won't be disapointed.\\n\\nThey have excellent family style Italian food. I mean family style as in...your grandmother was cooking in the back. Breaded Chicken cutlets,  Pasta eggplant. Their appetizers were divine. Chicken skewers, mini bruschetta.....scallops in bacon and so on and so on. I indulged on so many, it was difficult to make room for dinner. Surprise, Surprise...Cara managed.\\n\\nFor functions, it is always buffet style with apps being served on plates by their wait staff. They have two sections to the restaurant and if one side is being used for our family, the other side has about 10-13 tables for regulars having dinner. A few functions, we had the entire restaurant.  This place would be perfect for a function with 75 -100 people....maybe a baby shower or wedding shower. Anything really. They also let you bring in your own desserts....so at the last function I got to enjoy cake from my favorite bakery Patsy's.\\n\\nThe front section is a  small, but nice bar with a few hightops and nice big windows....there is  a great view of Mystic Ave. Nothing like watching people run others off the road. \\n\\nThe stand out at Raso's is their waitstaff. I NEVER have been anywhere, in my life, that has such helpful waitfstaff. They contribute to smooth sailing family functions and when I have sat at the bar, they were really sweet and easy to get your chat on with. Not only that, but when 15 of us walk in at the same time all wanting drinks, they took care of us with out blinking an eye and had a huge smile on their face. \\n\\nOne waitperson in particular was a hoot. Every time my sister ordered a Martini, he would bring one over for me and simply said \\"Girlfriend..I am here to take care of you.........I can read your mind\\"\\n\\nI concur. I concur."},{"name":"IHOP","address":"6065 Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"KISSIMMEE","stars":"3.5","text":"If I could give this place less than 1 star I totally would--the service here was the absolute worst of any ihop I have ever been to, and I've been to some terrible ihops. My group and I arrived here at about 7 or 8 pm and the place was nearly empty--there were probably two or three other groups in the entire restaurant. The waitress seemed nice at first but we quickly discovered she was absolutely clueless about what she was doing and most likely new. Her name was Abby or something like that and she made sure to let us know that it's actually not her real name and that her real name is Fahri or something like that. She then adds in that she's not Muslim, her parents just gave her a Muslim name (okay lady? We don't care what religion you follow...and that was completely unnecessary). Anyway, everything starts out pretty decently. We get our drinks and order our appetizers, all of that. We started to realize that she was actually incompetent at her job when we finished all of our appetizers and literally stacked our plates and garbage for her at the edge of our table so she could pick it up and then as she comes to check up on us, she makes eye contact with the plates at the edge of the table and walks away without taking them with her. It wasn't until probably 20 minutes later that she finally came back to our table (after we continuously tried to get her attention by making eye contact) as we had been ready to order again for a while (by this point we had moved the plates she didn't pick up to an empty table as the place was again, basically empty). So she comes, ready to take our orders, and again this woman is clueless. I asked her to make a simple alteration to my order (take out the meat, add more eggs) and I had to explain it to her probably 5 times. My friend asked to take away the 2 hams from his order and have it replaced with 1 bacon and 1 sausage. She gave us a bunch of attitude and told us she couldn't do that, essentially denying our requests (in what world can you not make this alteration? My friend is a waiter as well and even he knows that the POS has a button for additional instructions). Anyway, we get our orders and literally none of the alterations were made. Oh, also, we're dying of thirst and not once did we get a single refill on water. So none of the alterations were made and we have the food sent back with another waitress and she brings us our orders as we had wanted. My friend's eggs were fried and he realizes he was never asked how he wanted his eggs (he wanted them scrambled). His bacon was pretty much burnt so he couldn't eat like half of his food. While we're eating, this lady comes to ask what had gone wrong and we explain that none of the alterations we asked for were made. Instead of taking responsibility for her mistake, she claims that she put it into the system and unprofessionally blames the cooks for messing up the order. After we're finished eating, she doesn't come check on us or clear out our table and so we end up moving all of our dishes to that empty table that was holding our appetizer plates (we were playing card games so wanted our table cleared out--I'm also dehydrated at this point). So after about 20 minutes she comes back and--this is probably the most unprofessional and wtf moment--she tells us, of her own volition, that the other waiters were complaining about us because we had \\"dirtied up a table\\" with all our plates and now they'll have to clean it up. WHAT?! Why would you tell your customers this shit?! She proceeds to laugh it off and reassure us that she told them we just want to play our games. She lets us know that it's fine and that we can play for us long as we want to. After this moment, we were all completely stunned--never have we felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant. No refills on water, terrible service in general (waitress was so slow and rarely checked up on us), no one came to pick up our plates, waitress was unprofessional, incompetent, and had attitude, and food was not prepared as requested. What makes all of this worse was the fact that the restaurant was essentially empty with like 2-3 other and waiters present. Maybe we wouldn't have \\"dirtied up\\" your precious tables if you actually did your job and picked up our plates instead of gossiping. We left this lady like a $3 tip but honestly shouldn't have left her a penny. It's one thing to be new and another to literally be negligent and rude.

Unfortunately, for both C&S and for me, this time I cannot do so much butt kissing. \\n\\nLet me begin with our waiter. My family and I were here for a celebration, and my mother told him as much. Rather than make any sort of pleasant chit-chat about our news, he cut my mom off and asked what we wanted to drink. Granted, this place was pretty packed, even for a Saturday night, but a good waiter doesn't make you feel rushed. His faux pas continued. He did not speak up so my grandmother could hear him, he took my plate away when there was still food on it, he was unreceptive to our distaste for an appetizer we ordered, and he took about 10 minutes to even get us water. \\n\\nOk, enough griping about the waiter, although especially at a nice restaurant a waiter can make it or break it. This waiter received 18% tip from me, which is very low for such a place.\\n\\nNow the food. First we ordered a blush champagne for celebration, which was delicious (Louis something or other was the brand). I ordered truffle and Parmesan potato chips and salmon tartar for the appetizer. The salmon tartar was delicious--many different seasonings and very fresh salmon. My only complaint here was that I wish I had tasted the actual salmon more. The chips, however, were disgusting. They had no truffles. They tasted of truffle b/c of the truffle oil they doused on these poor potatoes, but not a shaved truffle to be seen. Even my dad wouldn't eat the chips, and that's saying a lot. \\n\\nFor my meal, I ordered the steamed sea bass in a miso broth with porcini mushrooms, bok choy, and white rice. It was freaking delicious. If i hadn't been so full from the salmon tartar and the tasty sourdough bread, I would have eaten the entire thing (well, if my waiter hadn't grabbed my plate away from me!). The sea bass was moist and flavorful, and the mushrooms absorbed the miso flavor and weren't chewy at all.\\n\\nMy dad got the tuna steak seared, and it was also quite heavenly with the pepper topping. My mom ordered the parmesan crusted trout--it was tasty but too buttery/heavy for my taste. She seemed to feel that way as well. Finally, my grandmother ordered a small order of shrimp. I didn't try her shrimp, but they looked just okay to me. \\n\\nWe were too stuffed for dessert, but I did manage to finish my glass of 15 hands merlot for dessert. \\n\\nMy fish was superb, so come for some seafood.

Disappointed, we retreated to Longwood to go to Korea House for the first time. Actually, it was a wonderful mishap that we ended up here! \\n\\nI quickly made a reservation online for a group of eight. You can reserve either a table with the bbq grill on it or without. The grill sounds fun for next time. The menu has Korean bbq which is cooked in the kitchen or served raw to be cooked on a bbq tabletop grill. The type of Korean bbq you order will be based on where you sit (if you have a grill top table or not). \\n\\nYelper Cecille R. ordered the seafood pancake with green onions and hot pepper. That was really tasty, and a large enough appetizer to share or have as a single meal. The sauce for the Korean pancake was amazing - it was a rich, sweet, spicy chili paste sauce, so good!  \\n\\nI ordered the pork bulgogi and my husband had the LA galbi which is beef short ribs marinated in Korean bbq sauce then grilled. In hindsight we could've ordered just one order of Korean bbq and shared it because these come out on a very large dishes and it's all meat with just a few grilled vegetables. You also get a small urn of steaming white rice with each entr√©e. \\n\\nMy favorite part of the meal-the \\"six kinds of side dishes\\" that come with the Korean bbq (that's how it's described on the menu anyway). The side dishes contain a lot of pickled vegetables including kimchi, Chinese broccoli, radish, chayote squash, bean sprouts, and something I swear was called fish cake. I think I heard right? The 5 of the 6 side dishes were my absolute favorite with the meat and rice. Not too sure about that fish cake. The side dishes made the meal very spicy and flavorful, great crunchy texture. The kimchi is made in house and spectacular! I'm going to ask if I can buy a jar of it. My only lament is that I have eaten at other Korean bbq places and they usually include a dish of pickled garlic. I was missing the garlic and it wasn't included on the list of available side dish vegetables. \\n\\nOverall it was a really positive experience here and the food tasted great.

For 200 bucks per dinner, I'm positive u can get MUCH better steaks anywhere but NOT HERE!!!! We got sat down at our reservation time which was 7:30, waiter came and greeted us, gave us water, yet he forgot the bread. The bread ended up showed up the same time as our appetizer which was the escargot. I had better before which was in South Africa. Then we had our entree, which was a piece of 28 oz steak shared by two worthy of 90 bucks. How did it taste??!?!!!??! IT WAS BURNT!!!!! How disappointed was that?! How did we know it was BURNT?!?! Because it was bitter EVERY SINGLE BITE!!!!! At first I thought it was the sauce, then I realize the whole piece of steak was burnt!!!! Even thought we ordered Medium Rare!!! How disrespectful and sad was that!!?? To find out a local well know steak house would serve better tasting side dishes than their main entree?!?! The whole time I just kept on telling myself that I really should have made my reservation at \\"Chops\\", \\"Bones\\", or \\"little alley steak house\\"!!!!!! At least all of these places had the respect for a piece of 30 days dry age meat like how they suppose to!!!!! Who meal was $200 and it was for my birthday, we left still hungry because obviously the 28oz was also including the piece of huge bones!!!! It was pretty much a thick cut T Bone steak they wanted to charge $90 for. We would never ever go back there, sorry Kevin, shame on you and your staff to burn a steak!!!"},{"name":"Vittles Restaurant","address":"2579 S Cobb Dr SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3.5","text":"Some of the best food values in Smyrna.

I was expecting your normal sized baby back ribs, but this was in cubes, kinda like the size of ice cubes which had barely any meat and it was on the dry side.  Overall, I have tasted better and was not that great.  \\n\\nOn the other hand, the wings were DY-NO-MITE!  It was full of flavor and very juicy.  Whatever sauce they used,  I want to eat it with all my food rest of my life.  The wings were marinated perfectly and the crunch of the skin as you bite into the wings was amazing.  The deep fried skin works perfectly with the sweet/salty/spicy flavors in the marinate.  The wings had plenty of meat and it was very soft.  I can honestly say that it was one of the best chicken wings that I have tasted in my life!  Many people who visit Los Angeles from out of state goes straight to In-N-Out.

Cheeseburger Bobby's is a local burger chain in Georgia - I tried the location off of Roswell Road in Buckhead.  Cheeseburger Bobby's offers a small selection of specialty burgers, which includes the Carolina Burger (cheddar, cole slaw, and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce), a chili cheeseburger, and turkey and veggie burgers for those who don't eat beef.  A classic cheeseburger meal with fries and a medium drink will cost you around $10.\\n\\nHighlights: The Buckhead location has a very friendly staff.  The hamburger buns are toasted on the grill prior to serving.  I thought the burger tasted decent - the bread came out good as well.  Inside the restaurant, it's really bright and modern looking.  It's a decent atmosphere for a family night out with burgers and fries.  Something that I rarely notice in burger restaurants is a topping bar which you pretty much add everything.  The burger will be served in a basket or takeout box with just the bun, cheese, and meat.  It's up to you to add as much or as little sauce, vegetables, and seasonings as you want.  There's quite a few sauces and seasonings to choose from, including mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, and the \\"special sauce\\".\\n\\nCritiques: Fries, in my opinion were average.  I wasn't a huge fan of the self serve topping bar.  If you don't mind that, add a star to my rating.  Some of the sauce dispensers were difficult to use.  It's the nature of a self serve topping bar to be a little messy - I had to dispose of the first plastic cup I took for sauce because there was already sauce on it.  Small drink lids were out when I first went to grab my soda.  The employees promptly restocked the lids upon request, but I felt that the topping area could be maintained a little better.\\n\\nOverall: I guess I'm just not a fan of \\"add your own toppings\\" at burger restaurants.  The burgers taste decent though and the atmosphere is pleasant, so give this chain a shot if you don't mind that."},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"The lemon ricotta pancakes were amazing and the honey butter took the biscuits to another level.

I ordered two kolaches. The first was a ham and swiss, which was like a breakfast sandwich. The second one was fruit: peach.

You can order these items by the pound or eat in or take out. your typical hardcore chinese fare such as deep fried intestines, tripe, whole fish and crab, etc... so some items maybe appealing to adventuerous western diners. Hint: So far this is the only game in town for this type of chinese food - there are hardly any alternatives  - so its no secret this is a good business idea - this part of Austin  has a high percentage of residents of asian descent.

It means I'm getting an authentic experience, which I appreciate. Din Ho definitely provides this experience. There can be a bit of a language barrier, particularly with the specials board and items on the menu with no description.  This is not nearly enough of a problem to keep me away.  \\n\\nI haven't tried every Asian restaurant in town, but I have to say that I think Din Ho has the best egg rolls. They are nicely spiced and have a wonderful flavor that I've not tasted on any other, leading me to believe they are made fresh in house, rather than using a packaged product.\\n\\nThe sizzling platters are a treat, since the sauce caramelizes on the platter and tastes great mixed in with the rice. My favorites are the beef and scallop dishes.  I ordered the beef sizzling plate a few months ago, and when it arrived a tiny Chinese grandma leaned over and told me I had picked the best dish in the place. Hers arrived a few minutes later. \\n\\nDin Ho is the place to be if you want Chinese BBQ.

The location downtown is good as well, but this review is specifically for the location on Chkalov.  \\n\\nService: Jerusalem Cafe appears to be family owned and operated. They seem to genuinely care about their product and their customers' satisfaction.  We were seated immediately. When another couple came in, they were not forced to wait. Another person came out of the kitchen and sat them immediately as well.  We had just enough time to look the menu over and the young lady who served us came as soon as we were ready to order. She brought the drinks right away and was pleasant and helpful.  When our food came, it was fresh and hot.  She noticed that I needed iced tea and brought me a new one without me even having to ask.  As soon as we were done with our meal, our plates were cleared. When we complimented to food, she was genuinely pleased that we were satisfied.\\n\\nFood: I had the falafel lunch special and my husband had the garlic chicken lunch special.  Each dish came with two kinds of cabbage salad, tabouleh, hummus, a tomato and cucumber salad, and two kinds of sauces  (I don't know what they were but they were yummy). The meal also came with flatbread. While the portions of sides were small taken on their own, as another reviewer noted, taken on the whole, they made a nice little salad sampler and there was plenty. Of these little salads, the cabbages were my favorite, lightly vinegary, a little sweet, and cool. Very nice on a summer day.  My falafel was cooked perfectly, perfectly crisp on the outside, and just the right size for folding into a little piece of soft, warm flatbread with a little dollop of hummus.  My husband and I are rarely excited about the same restaurants and the same kinds of food, but he was very happy with his meal as well. He had the garlic chicken which, again, was hot, cooked perfectly, and seasoned just right. It came on a small bed of rice. At last! A restaurant we both can agree on.\\n\\nEnvironment: While I would not say that the environment is bad, I would say that it isn't on par with the food and the service. This is the sole reason that I won't give five stars. The neighborhood is safe, but it's located in a 1970s strip mall and is hardly noticeable from the street.  This is certainly not a fault of the restaurateurs, but it needs to be included in my review.  While the decor inside isn't something to write home about, it is clean and  pleasant. I don't know about you, but I will sacrifice ambiance for a good meal any day of the week. If you want better ambiance, the location downtown is more attractive.\\n\\nI am writing this review, although I ordinarily don't write reviews, because the location isn't the best but the place is just so good!

See below.\\n\\nI think the only reason it's the \\"#1 Chinese Restaurant\\" in town is because here are only 2 descent candidates, and personally, I think First Chinese BBQ is 100000x better.\\n\\nFirst of all, the food is ok. Typical Chinese restaurant. It might be popular in Austin for students and people with limited options, but for the experienced palate, the food is mediocre at best. I've eaten here a couple of times in my college years and just recently went back. We had the lobster and peking duck. 2 live lobsters for $43, dipped in batter then sauteed with vegetables. It is pretty tasty but Houston restaurants like Sinh Sinh cooks it much better, for cheaper.\\n\\nThe peking duck is mediocre too. The skin is soft and still attached to the meat, so there's a thick layer of fat in between. The wrap isn't a wrap, it's a mini steamed bun, like a mini pita. The duck is cut into huge slice chunks so basically only 1 piece can fit a bun. There are only 10 buns, but maybe enough meat for 15 buns. When we asked for more sliced onions and buns, they tried to charge us \\"$3 for onions, $6 for buns.\\" WOW! I have never heard this crap before. We ordered sodas, but I wouldn't be surprised if they charged you for water here. Their sauteed combination vegetable dish is a job. It's bland, soggy, and disgusting. But you can try it for $8.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor, go to First Chinese BBQ instead."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This meal is really high up on my list of best meals of my life. \\n\\nTalk about freshness.

I've never had better clams than the ones I had in the lobster fra diavolo in my entire life. I even went to California and had fresh clams only a few weeks before having this meal, and I still think that the clams at this restaurant were better. First of all, the lobster fra diavolo is a beast of a dish. It's enormous and absolutely incredible. A rather fair sized lobster, perfectly cooked, sitting atop a bed of pasta and surrounded by other tasty sea creatures. It's seriously agonizing, writing about it, because I'm remembering how amazing it tasted, and it's making me so upset that it's not in my mouth at this very second.\\n\\nWe also had the black squid ink pasta, which was also incredible. It was not what I had expected, because I had never had such pasta before; I imagined the squid ink to be a sauce. Instead, the pasta is made with squid ink, and WOW, what a difference it makes. Fresh pasta makes all the difference in the world, but adding squid ink simply elevates it to a whole new level. Throw in some garlic, olive oil and crack cocaine*, and you have this dish. No joke, they have to be adding drugs into that dish because I could NOT stop eating it; it was like I was addicted. (I was literally scraping the pan. )\\n\\nSo yes, this is a 5 star review, and yes, I have only had 2 of the menu offerings. But  am coming back, and I will have tried more.

The first time I went, it was right after it opened (I think the second night it was open).  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable.  There were barely any oysters on the menu priced over $2 (wahoo!).  The oysters we had were delicious.  I was sure I would become a regular.  I dream in oysters.\\n\\nThe next time I went, I really did not enjoy myself.  My waitress was not rude, but not friendly.  Just polite, but it seemed very forced.  I felt like I was inconveniencing her just by sitting there.  She barely came to our table.  This time, the oysters chosen were pricier on average.  There were few priced around $2, more of them were $2.75+, which was disappointing because most of them were East Coast, and usually I would expect to see just the West Coasters pushing (and surpassing) the $3 mark.  But ok, fine, oysters are expensive.  I know that and I love them anyways.  I was just hoping that since ICOB does not have any pricing specials, and because they're all about being local, the prices would remain where they were when I first went.\\n\\nOnce I moved on from this, I decided to sample every one of the dozen oysters on the menu.  The taste was so-so.  I was not super impressed by any of my oysters, unfortunately.  The Island Creek was by far the best - the others tasted average.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, I had a hair in one of my oysters.  Like somehow tucked underneath the meat.  When I was finally able to flag my waitress down (literally had finished my entire dozen by the time she finally came around) to tell her about the mishap, she did not apologize, and she did not offer to take it off the bill.  She just took my bread plate, said \\"put it here\\" and then left with it, bringing me a new one only 15+ minutes later. !!! \\n\\nI also ordered the lobster roll.  The lobster was significantly undercooked, to the point where I felt uncomfortable eating it.  I don't know if other people like their lobster meat to be slightly raw but this really grossed me out.  The only thing that kept me going was knowing how much I paid for it.  I will say that if it had been fully cooked, it would have been very good.\\n\\nIn paying the bill, I gave a lower than average tip - totally accidentally - just because I was in the middle of a conversation when signing the bill so I just wasn't thinking.  I was immediately confronted about it.  I apologized, but frankly I felt the service was not good so I didn't even want to correct my mistake.  I don't know if I will go back, unfortunately.

Ordering is done mass-production style and is quite entertaining as you stand in a cafeteria style rope line. When you get up to the front counter, you order by weight. In other words, 6 ounces of brisket, a pound of pork loin, a half rack of ribs and three pints of beans, for example.  They serve it with sliced white bread on white butcher paper. Then you take your butcher paper piled with a mound of beef and white bread outside and trough feed at communal picnic tables with jugs of their famous \\"sause\\" spread around.

I know doing this will take a while and will be a project - but ongoing but if you read my reviews, you will more than likely take my word on the places that I have been to and will try it and not be disappointed.\\n\\nHae Woon Dae BBQ was not even on my radar!  It was mentioned by the GF to try it.  Sometimes you are in just a mood not to go to the same favorite places.  That's the problem with dining in Atlanta.

I was in the mood of trying something new.  \\n\\nLocated OTP, a couple of minutes outside death race (aka 285) lies an establishment in one of the most fawked up plazas in the Greater Metro Atlanta Area.  That's another thing, with all those stores, shops, dining places on Buford, you can't see this place if you're the driver.  It is tucked away in the back of the plaza.  \\n\\nOk anyway, never had Korean BBQ.  It's kinda like your personal Hibachi station. Meaning a group of stranger Motha_______s aren't sitting at the same table wasting your time and keeping you hungry because it's like 12 people at one table.  Korean BBQ is more personal in which the oven is at the particular table that you dine at.  The guy brings the coal from the back and the server actually cooks the meat right at your table.  Pretty cool.  Oh there is a gang of food that comes with that.  I ordered the beef stew.  That stuff was off the hook good!  Very filling.  I guess in Korean culture (in which I do like and needs to be implemented into American culture) is community ordering.  Meaning whatever I order, the person(s) I am with are openly welcomed to have some of my food and vice versa.  That's why they bring out the extra plates because what I order is what you're also having.  Great Concept! needs to be doctrined more at some of these places.  Also had this beef that they fry right in front of you, chased it down with white rice.  It isn't cheap.  Average entree is somewhere between $15 and $25 a head.  Be careful of what you order, it can get up there - aka the damage.\\n\\nVery filling.

Don't recommend getting the pork belly along with it. Personally think it's insanely priced at $15 for 6 pieces.

Incredible flavor combinations and beautiful presentation. I went here for my birthday dinner with 7 other friends and we all agreed that it was some of the best food we've had out in the Boston area. Not sure it's helpful to go through favorite dishes, but I will say that some of the dishes were highly priced for what they were. A \\"tabla\\" with an artichoke, 3 sprigs of asparagus and 3 slices of eggplant for $18? \\n\\nSo why the three stars? Well, because it was the worst customer service experience I have had in a very long time and if it weren't for the fact that I was surrounded by my closest and dearest friends for my birthday, I would still be very, very sour. \\n\\nWe had reservations for 8:30pm on a Friday night and we waited upstairs (where there wasn't enough room for all of us to sit) for 45 minutes before we were even seated. 45 minutes is plenty of time to offer us a drink- but we weren't even given drink menus to start and once we were, no one came to take our drink order. The hostess awkwardly lied to us about the progress of our table downstairs \\"one more minute,\\" \\"they are signing their bill now,\\" \\"oh they are still hanging out, I don't know what to do...\\" I could go on. \\n\\nOnce we get downstairs, we are seated at a table with only six chairs and two people are standing and waiting for chairs for a good ten minutes. Even by the time everyone had sat down, there were no food or drink menus to be found. I don't think we were able to put our order in until 9:45pm. \\n\\nAll of this could have been made fine/better if the staff were at all apologetic or understanding of our situation. They seemed like they couldn't have cared any less and were extremely unpleasant to talk to. At the end of the night, after several rounds of drinks and desserts, we were each given a sip of an espresso martini (I have no idea what it was, but this is my best guess) in a shot glass. THIS was their \\"sorry\\" for seating you almost an hour after your reservation and for ignoring you for most of the evening. Not even a full drink! \\n\\nThere was no discount on the check, none of the 20+ plates we ordered were comped... so we ended up speaking to the owner, who apologized only after telling us his laundry list of excuses- his wife wasn't there, they just started using iPads, they had 115 covers (anyone who hasn't worked in a restaurant has no idea what this means), blahdeblahblah... he said he would \\"take care of it,\\" which meant he took 2 of the 4 desserts off the tab. Unreal. \\n\\nI will, however, say that I still kind of want to go back on a date and sit at the bar downstairs that is right over the open kitchen- there are some pretty adorable bar-height upholstered chair/bench things that seat TWO perfectly! Also, my friends and I agreed that most of the dishes were good for sharing between two or three people, but not four. A lot of things served in threes so two people had to split the third bite.\\n\\nOverall, an exquisite culinary experience but they REALLY need to sort a few things out in front-of-house and maybe teach their staff to smile more and not be awkward."},{"name":"Din Ho Chinese BBQ","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 116","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I came to this restaurant based on their yelp reviews.

A note to the uninformed: the restaurant takes reservations, so reserve a few days in advance for a weekend table or wait at your own peril (it seems the general rule of thumb is a 45 minute wait for two , and an hour and 45 minute wait for three people or more). Having been one of doomed naivet√©, I did not plan in advance, and was told my party of five would have to the aforementioned time. This is where the world class cordiality of the staff really began to show and never lost momentum. Within less than an hour, the sympathetic host came up to me and offered a table that had been for a ditched reservation. We were seated in the half of the time projected. Our server Mike was also incredibly helpful and surprisingly funny; a pleasure to be served by. As for the food, it was very good but unfortunately not great. I had the lobster and steak BLT eggs hollandaise with home fries. It was if the restaurant chef thought \\"what if I just put the best shit ever into one breakfast dish and call it a day?\\" This assumed mentality surmised my issue with this plate was: the whole was less than the sum of its parts. Avocado, lobster, bacon, tomato, steak, and eggs hollandaise are all amazing on their own, but put all together is simply too much for one dish without significant alterations. I also ordered a margarita sake, recommended by our waiter Mike. This was awesome, and had a nice spice kick at the end of every sip.

The bar was quite packed with patrons enthusiastic with the raw bar items.  My fianc√© and I ordered Island Creek, Howlands Landing, and Wellfleet oysters. Every oyster in our plate is big, plump, fills all space in the shell.  They all taste super fresh, smooth, and with scallop-sweet. I enjoy the oysters here more than at Neptune Oyster Bar. \\n\\nWe also ordered the clam chowder.  It's taste is more elegant than what I thought for a clam chowder.  It's not too salty and thick, but still very flavorful, especially there were some vegetable flavors (fennel and something else?) inside to enhance the taste of the chowder.  But the clam meet was chopped in big pieces and at the same time very gummy.  Not quite sure if that is what a New England Clam Chowder should have, but I didn't enjoy the clam's texture in this chowder even though I am a huge fan of clam.\\n\\nWe ordered the Lobster Roe Noodles, which contains braised short ribs, grilled lobster, oyster mushrooms, and pecorino with orange-colored noodles.  The braised short ribs are a big success: super tender and flavorful.  Oyster mushrooms were also decently cooked. But this dish fell short in other components.

I'm honestly really easily satisfied especially when it comes to food... but this place was beyond bad. The quiche was lukewarm and liquidy from the eggs and completely underseasoned. The coffee my friend got was cold and you could tell it wasn't freshly brewed. My london fog was OK but not a wow factor. It was just tea and milk. The brownie was the worst brownie I've ever had... I enjoy pre-packaged brownies even more than that one. \\n\\nWe both had really high expectations but this place definitely fell short... I'm sticking to Thinking Cup from now on. They've never let me down and their macarons and goat cheese arugala baguette are delicious.

PEOPLE, use HELLMAN\\"S mayo in Lobster Salad and NOTHING ELSE, there is a reason for this, LOBSTER FLAVOR MAGIC HAPPENS when they combine, like peanut butter and grape jelly, like peas and carrots, like Bonnie and Clyde, you get the idea!   All you could really taste was the copious amount of butter they had marinated the roll in before hand. At $19 we were excited, that's nearly $10 LESS than Neptune.

Seriously?\\n\\nNOT to be outdone by a member of the cabbage family, the actual Lobster portion of the dish sealed the deal.  They grilled it, which can work if done correctly, but goes south faster than an AARP member in December if you over cook it.  Dried out, tough and most disturbingly, COMPLETELY devoid of any flavor other than dirty, burnt 'grill'.  It was like taking a bite out of a charred, left on the grill WAY too long chicken breast, and to make matters worse, the 'Charred Grill' flavor permeated into the rest of the dish.  I almost cried, it should be a punishable crime to mistreat ingredients this way!  BBQ Lobster anyone?  Might as well put ketchup on a cheese souffle! \\n\\nTo their credit, they comped us the clams, and the service was outstanding, very attentive, and the place is hopping, but if you want to eat anything other than Two Buck Shucks, you'd do better to save room and pick up a two piece and a biscuit for dessert next door at Popeye's!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Amazing and authentic.

It's one of the few chains that doesn't offer chain like food and hasn't lost it's quality by becoming a large chain. \\n\\nRegardless of what you order, you'll be impressed here. However, I'm partial to the turkey, moist brisket and pulled pork although my friends are big on the baby back ribs. The only downfall is because this is a franchise they don't have the tasty green chili stew many of the other stores have. Still, they do have the banana pudding and chocolate pudding to wash the BBQ sauce down. \\n\\nWhether pulling in solo, with friends or the entire family, no one can complain about this Rudy's. It's solid, consistent and will never do you wrong."},{"name":"De Dutch","address":"60-1055 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Fun, retro vibe.

So tiny that you're practically eating in the kitchen.

I've recently discovered how delicious squid ink is so we went with the Black Ink Alfredo. Who knew squid ink would taste so good? It's kinda weird to think about eating it... If I didn't know any better, I would think it's poisonous or something. The Clams Casino was another dish our server recommended and we scoped it out from the party sitting next to us. It looked good so we ordered it, and it didn't disappoint. Both dishes were absolutely delicious.

AMAZING.  The cocktail and horseradish sauces were awesome, and wow, seriously, amazing oyster.\\n\\nAll three main dishes were exceptional.

It's only 6 pieces but because they give you the whole wing, it's like getting 12.

I couldn't eat more than one full wing (and I ate it with my rice)  \\n\\nPok pok special: the chicken was tender and I loved the sauce that came with it.  However, there was nothing spectacular about the chicken.  \\n\\nBrussels Sprouts: I'm not a fan of Brussels sprouts, but I liked it.

Commonwealth knows how to do it.  I was amazed to find out this place opened in November because they do not give any perception that they are the rookie in town.  In fact, quite the opposite; from the moment we stepped inside the restaurant it was obvious that a lot of planning, care and consideration were put into the development of this establishment. \\n\\nThe Market: You walk into a small market with a bucolic vibe that has a selection of vegetables, jams, ice cream (some insane flavors! Especially \\"The King\\"...go there and find out), amongst other delicious items.  While this is not a place you would go to in place of a grocery store, you would most certainly use it to supplement your kitchen for some very nice organic additions.  \\n\\nThe Food: I was there on a Saturday morning at around 10:40 AM, so I needed to wait until 11:00 to get an item off the lunch menu.  I held myself over with a muffin and cappuccino, both of which were delicious!  For lunch ordered the Pastrami sandwich...wow.  It was delicious!  The slaw, pastrami and sauce combined in symphony to make every bite delicious! \\n\\nThe Ambiance: Commonwealth is the sort of place I could see coming to with friends at around 12:30 in the afternoon to watch the Pats/Sox/Bruins/Celtics and end up leaving around 7 or 8 at night (if not later).  It's a very welcoming environment with a nice rustic feel to it.  Works for me.\\n\\nFinishing up: Yes. It's not priced like McDonalds, however, when making my decision about how I felt about the bill, I quickly put myself at ease knowing that the product I was paying for was not frozen for days or soaked with hormones.

In general I'd say Sweet Tomatoes is a safe bet for lunch or dinner. You may want to skip breakfast here though. \\n\\nWe arrived around 10:30 on Sunday morning for breakfast. I was surprised to see that they already had the salad buffet set up, but it was all ready to go, in case you wanted to start your day with salad. Most of our party skipped the salad so we paid the cashier, grabbed a table, and headed over to check out the breakfast offerings.\\n\\nThey offer an omelette bar, however you need to place your order with one of the waitresses that roam the restaurant clearing your plates. (I found this out when I attempted to order from the woman making the omelettes.) I tracked down a server and she gave me a slip of paper to write down my order. \\n\\nWhere they normally have the soups set up were a couple different scrambled egg options. They also had the chili and chicken noodle soups, in case you're craving breakfast soup. (Surprisingly two members of my group filled up on chicken noodle soup.) The scrambled eggs were OK. I would say slightly better than hotel eggs. The one I tried had veggies and ham mixed in and the veggies seemed very fresh.\\n\\nThey also had gravy for biscuits and gravy. While the biscuits seemed hard on the outside they were soft and fluffy on the middle and went really well with the gravy. That was a highlight of the meal.\\n\\nThey had a few muffin and pastry options. I tried the cinnamon bun and it was pretty good. My daughter had one of the muffins and it seems that it was topped with salt instead of sugar. That wasn't too great. \\n\\nSo, after sampling a lot of items on the buffet I remembered the omelette I had ordered and went up to the omelette bar to inquire about it. Mine hadn't been made yet and she informed me there were still several ahead of me. (How, I don't know, because the restaurant was pretty dead, and I had been waiting quite a while.) Anyway, I told her I didn't want the omelette anymore since we were almost ready to go. \\n\\nBefore we left my kids had to hit up the desserts and I had another cup of coffee. It was then that my omelette finally came out to me. Of course I felt really bad about it, because I had tried to cancel my order and had no intention of eating anything more at that point.

I really like the atmosphere of the place.  It's casual yet full of energy whenever I come.  Generally, I like the whole tapas experience since it kind of forces you to interact with the people you're with. It's also an excellent excuse to pick off of someone else's plate without it being considered rude.  The price for the serving can often be too much for what I usually like to spend on dinner, especially on tapas portions, but overall it's a great place to come to once in a while.\\n\\nThis time around we ordered the ceviche de atun (tuna), codillo de cordero (braised lamb shank), portobello relleno (stuffed portabellos) and croquetas. Everything was delicious, but my favorite for that evening was a tie between the ceviche de atun and the portobello relleno.  Any of their ceviches are actually pretty delicious (I would hope so since it's the restaurant's namesake).  I was also pleasantly surprised at how large the spinach stuffed portabello was. The braised lamb shank was ok.  The lamb itself was really good and it didn't have a potent gamey taste to it like I've had at other places, so that was a plus.  However, the broth and whatever else was in it didn't really appeal to my tastebuds so it lost points for that.  And maybe it's because I had the croquetas last and was already full at that point, but I thought that they were too fried and oily for my full stomach to handle.

The risotto was a good complement and the two made a very good pairing to swirl and mix together.\\n \\nThe Rock Fish and Chips was our second entree. This is essentially a premium fish and chips (none of that basic cod) with a side of fries and tartar. I can't say this was a very good choice as the batter was quite soggy and didn't hold its shape very well. In addition, the Rock Fish was quite chunky and thick which I don't feel is my style of fish and chips; the soggy batter didn't help.\\n \\nTo finish off, my dessert was the Flour-less Chocolate Cake. With a dallop of ice cream on the side, this dense cake was a welcome end to the meal. If you can imagine a thick brownie with ice cream on top, this cake isn't too far from that idea, so dig in.\\n \\nAn alternative dessert is the Maple Creme Brulee. This is a lightly seared pudding with a rosemary shortbread cookie on top. The rosemary has an intense infusion into the shortbread so a bite of it with a taste of the pudding is a great way of enjoying this dessert which is also a great choice."},{"name":"Sushi Kiku","address":"2770 Lenox Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Half off sushi on Tuesday -  Saturday nights?

It is a bit pricier than most hole in the wall, but very well worth it due to very well prepared food, great genuine staff, and efficient restaurant (minimal wait time for seating and service).\\n\\nThe most important thing about Chinese barbeque is finding a place that is consistent. Din Ho not only is consistent but has great roast pork and cha siu.\\n\\nThe roast pork, my favorite, has just the right layers: the crispy outside skin with a thin layer layer of fat immediately under, moist meat, just thick enough layer of soft fat, and finally a drier portion of meat. Excellent and has a similiar consistency each time I've visit.\\n\\nI really do not like places that serves inedible roast pork to say the least. I've been to many places where it's largely fat that's unchewable. Literally a slab of rubber fat. Gross. I can't believe other places can even bring themselves to serve it. No meat. Soft skin.\\n\\nThe cha siu is prepared the way I like it best, caramelized, lean, and without pork stench. Tenderized cha siu is quite good too at other places. I think the only time I'm disappointed in cha siu would be if it was chewy.\\n\\nWe keep coming back for the wonton noodle soup. Soup is tasty with all the carefully added garnish, flavorful wonton, and crisp noodles. \\n\\nFried rice was just right and not too greasy. Yummy and delicious.\\n\\nWe got sat near the back and I got to observe the staff. They were all working very hard, yet were civil to each other and were very careful to the detail when preparing the food and serving it. No corners cut, no matter how hectic it seemed. The staff all hosted, took orders, served, waited, and did the finishing touch. Even then they've always been watchful of refilling and tending to the customers needs. They strive to deliver their best food and service. This is rare for many hole in the walls. Big thumbs up. The Asian staff were all Cantonese, so it is genuine!\\n\\nThey also leveraged technology and a good systematic approach to running the restaurant so the customer's time is well respected. Checks were all preprinted and waiting so the moment I asked for a check I got it, paid, and left all within a few minutes. They used an efficient ordering system that relayed perfectly to the back what detail the customer needed for their meal. \\n\\nGreat restaurant. Will always return for amazing Cantonese food.\\n\\n\\nPS: left my umbrella and they had my receipt on it, smart.

Yes, I said YOU cook them.  The idea of cook your own meal is not new and of course sitting around the cooking surface is not either, but here is the secret to the success of Slappy Cakes.  Whether you are age 3 or 103, the kid in all of us loves it when our creativity can go bonkers in the kitchen without someone telling us what you can or can't have on your plate.  We like the idea of pancake batter, mix ins as basic as berries and nuts, savory gems like crumbled bacon and bleu cheese, and a hot greased flat top at your disposable to make your Frankenstein.  Mom cannot stop you from putting bacon, bananas, and cheddar cheese all at once in your hot cakes, unless of course she is paying.  Even then, I would implore all of you culinary Picasso's to sweet talk dear old Mom into ordering a squeeze bottle of batter for herself so she can cook up plain pancakes to her heart's content.  Have faith kids, dear old Mom may still come around before the end of the experience and let a bacon bit or two accidentally make its way into one of her flap jacks.  I recommend trying the peanut butter batter.  It is nom-tastic especially with bacon.  I would love to try bleu cheese and bacon next time.  Yes, there will be a next time.  \\n\\nThe rest of the menu looks good too.  The Slappy Benedict looked tasty, but just reading the description of the Pork Belly Benedict makes my mouth quiver with wanton lust for bacon fat hollandaise.  The side of biscuits of gravy came in a healthy sized bowl, very nice.  I tried the savory bread pudding with leek gravy.  I love garlic, I love mushrooms, and I love bread pudding so it was no surprise that I enjoyed it.  The gravy was an especially nice touch.    \\n\\nObviously you don't have to cook your own breakie here, but if you don't then this place will have just as much or as little charm as the place down the street.  Get a regular breakfast if you must but bring a friend so the two of you can share it AND a bottle of batter.  If you are a glutton, leave your friend at home and OINK IT UP!

I was with a party of 11 for someone's birthday, and we were seated in the back corner where we had more room and it was quieter, which was a win-win. The restaurant is quite loud, and I think being anywhere on the main floor would be a bummer if it's crowded. We were there on a Wednesday night with reservations and ended up waiting about 20 minutes to be seated (they wait until half the party is there to seat). Pretty ambiance though inside.\\n\\nThe food was good, but I wasn't over-the-moon about it, especially considering the price. The fried calamari was nice, though I usually consider that a stand-by dish, and the warm goat cheese was also yummy. One of my favorite parts of the meal was the pesto spread that came with the bread and the side salad of olives and peppers that came on the side for most of the dishes. Everything we had was good, though I wasn't enamored with the price. It's downtown, so I expected this, but it was still a bit frustrating at times. The dishes were all warm when they came out, and there was enough for most everyone at the table to take a bit of what they wanted. I left full, if that's any help.\\n\\nA member of our party brought in cupcakes, and there is a cake cutting fee when bringing in your own desserts (as usual).

While you wait for your waiter and your food, they have popcorn to munch on at the table, which when heard sounds weird, but believe me it fits! My sister and I split a salad and entree (what can I say, we're poor college students!!!) but it was more than enough!

Featured on DDD, was their Fish Sauce Wings, their Papaya Pok Pok, and their Boar Collar dish (Muu Paa Kham Waan).  All these were highly recommended on Yelp as well, though the Papaya Pok Pok was also known as \\"papaya salad\\" for some reason, and the only way I found the name of the boar collar dish was by searching the menu...  \\n\\nThere was quite a long wait, and I'm guessing this is pretty routine since they just pointed us towards their sister restaurant (Whiskey Soda Lounge) where we sat and had a drink while we waited.  We waited about 45 minutes before we were called, so expect a wait if you come during peak hours.\\n\\nWe ordered the highly recommended Fish Sauce Wings as an appetizer to share, then I chose the Papaya Pok Pok, and my company chose the Khao Soi (curry) with beef.  \\n\\nAs we waited, we were brought water in a pitcher, and we immediately could tell that there was something added to the water.  I asked the waiter, and he told me it was pandanus.  Very interesting, and very unique.  I liked it.\\n\\nSoon thereafter, the Fish Sauce Wings came, and let me just say WOW!  The wings themselves were pretty big, compared to other \\"wings\\" most people are used to, and very meaty as well.  And the flavor, SO MUCH FLAVOR!  I elected to go spicy, and I think the additional spice was perfect.  I would order these every time I came here.\\n\\nNot too much later, the food plates arrived, and upon first taste of the Papaya Pok Pok i knew I had made the right choice.  Once again, there was SO MUCH FLAVOR!!!  I think I actually took a minute or two to re-gather myself, and my taste buds... and when I continued, I swear it got better (and hotter) with every bite.  This dish comes with some heat, and I did have to ask for another pitcher of their pandanus water to cool the heat.\\n\\nLastly, the Khao Soi (curry) with beef was alright, but no where near the superstar status of the Fish Sauce Wings and the Papaya Pok Pok.  After tasting the curry, I felt very happy about my decision in ordering, and I'm not quite sure if that's because the curry wasn't amazing, or because the Papaya Pok Pok was SOOOO amazing.\\n\\nI didn't get to try the (Muu Paa Kham Waan) boar collar, and I swear to try that next time!

In fact, it took us a half hour to obtain and pay our bill... guess they wanted to keep us there a bit longer...\\n\\nAs we were directed towards seafood by the server, for our two apps, we selected the special appetizer of the day - Soft Shell Crab in a lobster consomme $17, and the Marinated Spanish Octopus, Navel Orange, Castelvetrano Olives, Crispy Artichokes $14 off the regular menu.  While the presentation was nice with the lobster consomme poured into the plate at the table, my half of the crab was missing a few legs, which, given the price, is unacceptable.  In terms of taste, of the two apps, I preferred the tender coins and a single leg of the octopus, which would have been easily improved with a more generous scattering of the bits of citrus than the 2 bits we enjoyed.\\n\\nFor entrees, we left the sea, and headed off in the direction of air and land with the Seared Duck Breast, Potato Gnocchi, Baby Spinach, Almonds, Tangerines, Lavender Duck Jus*  $31 and the Grilled Pork Chop, Lardons, Sweet Corn, Fava Beans, Haricots Verts, Applewood Smoked Jus*  $27.  The pork arrived as a generous portion in the form of a thick cut chop sliced on the diagonal.  The meat was tender, the beans crisp.  The duck dish, however, was 8 thin slices of tender dark meat, served with a scant scattering of veggies.  For $31, it was tasty, but too little of a good thing for the price.  If the meat portion must be limited, veggies are cheap, so it would have been nice if they could have served a legit serving or two of vegetables to help me to make it to the 3-5 servings recommended a day.\\n\\nDue to the head's up provided at the beginning of the meal that souffles take 25 minutes to make, we ordered our sweet endings at the same time as everything else.\\n\\nThe Lavender Beignets, Chocolate Sauce $9 was unfortunately not appreciated as much since we ate the souffle first.  By then our tongues were sweetened and the beignets had cooled.  So, they were only eh.\\n\\nThe Grand Marnier Souffl√© $10 (please allow 25 minutes for preparation, available after 5:00pm) was my first real dessert souffle!  Yes, past molten chocolate cakes masquerading as chocolate souffles in name did not count.

I really liked the raspberry.\\n\\nTo give you an idea of the portion size, this was the first time in quite a while where we enjoyed three courses apiece, and left without any semblance of a doggie bag.\\n\\nWhile the dining room is set upstairs, the bathrooms are located on the first level, behind the bar.

The side of beef bulgoghi was a decent amount for the price. The beef tasted like it should be and there was a lot of onions on the plate.

They have something for everyone! I love that they offer used books - I like to read, I'm not made of money!  I feel like Belle from Beauty and The Beast, I just want to swing from the bookshelves and sing. \\n\\nAre you a lover of knick-knacks?  Prepare to meet your best friend/worst nightmare. I always leave with a handful of goodies to brighten up my desk, my bookshelves or walls every single time.  I'm powerless against snarky post-it notes, pens with puppies on them, anything of this nature! \\n\\nSo what it the correct response to an out of towner asking about Powell's you ask? Screams of joy? A passionate description of all the floors and offerings? I'm not entirely sure but I know it starts with me going more often to support this amazing place that we're so lucky to have.\\n\\nIn Short: I love you Powells, don't ever change.

It's really pricey, so eating there often wasn't feasible but it was a place to treat ourselves when the time arose. This isn't a typical cheap buffet with sesame chicken and kids pizza. This is more of an authentic Japanese Buffet with authentic Japanese cuisine.  It's very nice and and the price reflects that.\\n\\nThe all-u-can-eat shashmi really sealed the deal. There is other food but we went for the shashmi. They always had tuna and salmon along with two other types of fish. The slices were cut fresh and then placed on a sushi boat for the taking. I could eat the salmon all-night. My girlfriend loved the tuna and said it tasted extremely fresh.\\n\\nThe sushi selection is the largest I've seen. I'd say there are well over 50 rolls out at any given time. It's not just popular rolls either, it's every roll imaginable.

It was all-u-can-eat and I'm on a Keto diet and this was perfect. The shashmi was stacked out for you to get as much as you wanted. Now, they place two tiny pieces out on little saucers at a time.. You have to grab 4-6 saucers to even get a decent amount and that's only if there's any out there. The shashmi used to be plentiful and the boat was never empty. With the saucers, it comes out at no regular interval and when it does, it's one fish at a time.So it might be an hour before you see salmon or tuna, etc.This is a major difference from the four fish that used to always be stocked at any given time. Since they put so little out it goes very quickly. People run up there as soon as the 10-15 saucers go out. Once it is empty, it may be 30 minutes before it's restocked. This really sucks and really takes all of the fun out of going. The shashmi is still great but since you never get any it defeats the purpose. We've decided that after our last trip (7.16.2013) that we would not return. It's not worth paying $70 for two meals when you can't get what you came for.

I gave a \\"meh\\" rating rather than \\"A-ok\\" for several reasons.  Hands down the best thing we ate that night was the short rib appetizer, which is a sad testament to a steak restaurant.  The lobster fritters that everyone raves about were \\"good\\".  My son had the cowboy steak which was fantastic, but it should be at the price they charge.  Husband and I (and the other couple with us) had the steak for two and, although the flavour was good, it was pretty gristly.  The butters for which you pay extra for were melted, and on the side, so I don't really feel you got the full benefit of them.  Actually you pay extra for EVERYTHING, the $96 tag on the steak for 2 is just that - steak - which is a bit chintzy!  We had finished dinner and were finishing up our wine when my daughter noticed a bug in her wine glass.  The glass had been clean when the wine was poured, so the bug either fell off of the beams overhead or had been in the wine.  The waiter whisked the bug away pondering where it had come from.  There was no apology, we saw the waiter talk to the Manager, who never approached us, there was nothing removed from the bill.  It's not as though we were going to pay a $700 bill (without the tip) and try and scam them for a $50 bottle of wine.  When we went to the Spence for my daughter's 21st (this is back in Richard's day) they stood us a round of champagne and Richard and all his staff signed a copy of his book for her.  At Rathbun's my son got a \\"free\\" dessert.

So much that you want to taste, burp, and sweat them all day?  You're in luck, friends - the Daily Catch provides.\\n\\nThe space is tiny, with twenty chairs and a little open kitchen.  It is so small that there isn't even a bathroom - which is ridiculous for most places of business, but especially a restaurant.  Excepting the food, the place feels extremely low budget, and I'm sure that it is.  Just to give you an idea, there are no paper menus, all cups are disposable, and the check is scribbled on a scrap of paper towel.  Not the fancy quilted shit either, but the thin brown kind you see in public bathrooms for airports and stadiums.  As for dishware, entrees come to you in the beat-up pans they were cooked in.\\n\\nBut the divey feel is part of the fun of Daily Catch.  The place is cozy and very casual, a great choice for lunch with my mom and brother.  Our chef and server was extremely friendly and forthcoming, even answering my mother's questions about recipes.\\n\\nOf course, the best part is the food.  You can't get farther than six feet away from the cooking, and from our table, we could see each of our orders coming together.  Gleaming pools of olive oil, heaping tablespoons of garlic - not for the faint of heart, and utterly delicious.\\n\\nThe bread - the bread is not good, so don't bother with it except to sop up sauce.  For instance, you might try to absorb the garlic-laden cream sauce that comes with the shrimp scampi appetizer.  This was a delicious little platter of fat, fresh shrimp cooked in a whole lot of cream and a whole lot of garlic.  It is one of the most sinful preparations of shrimp I've ever had.\\n\\nThe main event, though, was the pasta.  The renowned black pasta was superb.  The noodles were perfectly plump and they had the perfect amount of chew and spring.  They were in fact so al dente that some of the noodles broke apart - yet they didn't feel at all undercooked. We had the black pasta with aglio olio sauce, which I liked even though the bits of calamari added less than I'd expected.  Most of the work in this dish was provided by the pasta itself, which not only provided ideal texture, but also a light briny flavor.\\n\\nEven better, perhaps, was the linguini with clams in white sauce.  My mom's friend, who recommended the Daily Catch, has proclaimed that she would choose this dish as her last meal on earth.  While I might not go that far, I will concede that this linguini is not only delicious but also pretty hard to forget.  The presentation was very homey and simple, a mop of pasta in an old skillet, with the clams already out of their shelves.  The flavor was immense.  The clams were fantastic and fresh.  The sauce?  Heavenly.  Anchovy, romano, parsley, but mostly garlic and olive oil.  It wasn't a complicated sauce, and my mother has since added it to her repertoire, but it was insanely tasty.  The noodles themselves were a fantastic al dente, if not quite as eye-opening as the black pasta.\\n\\nLong story short, come to the Daily Catch for your fair portion of body odor and heartburn.  It is so well worth it."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Super rude hostess. Barely acknowledged us and clearly lied about the wait.

Well I don't care for chicken, but I was in Portland on a foodie trip so I needed to see what all the excitement was about.  I thought it would be sweet since most American Thai restaurants tend to layer on the palm sugar, but I was pleasantly surprised. There a nice balance between the light sticky glaze and the saltiness of the fish sauce. It's not spicy at all, but it's quite satisfying. Besides, I had the papaya salad and it was perfectly seasoned with peppers. Just enough for the that spicy bite, but not overdone to where your lips start burning. They add small dried shrimp to the mix giving the fish sauce somewhat more depth. A bite out of the chicken wing and a bit of jasmine rice then a little pick at the papaya salad --- the contrasting flavors were intense.  \\n\\nI also had the hang leh which was a braised pork shoulder. It just melted. Each scoop of the nicely thickened broth contained cloves of garlic that seemed to have been roasted then pickled.  Each lite crunch into a clove gave a subtle freshness to the rich pork sauce that I ladled over my rice. Yum. \\n\\nI ordered the khao soi chicken for my dinner guest as she didn't care for spicy. It wasn't bad, but it was a bit on the sweet side for me. It does come with lime and hot peppers to adjust the taste to your liking, but I already had enough contrasting flavors going in with the rest of the meal. \\n\\nI will return again as the menus has something for all tastes. Sweet, spicy, salty, rich, creamy, crunchy and zesty.

I would normally not care about a longer wait since you can't predict how long each table will stay, but in those last 15 minutes of my wait, there were 4 empty, dirty tables waiting to be cleaned up!

The Edamame dumplings were a disappointment... Maybe I just hyped myself up too much for them since everyone on Yelp was raving about them. The dumplings were beautifully presented, but that was all the dish had going for it. It definitely tasted more like a ravioli than a dumpling due to filling's smooth texture. The filing and the dish itself was very bland. Most likely not getting this again.\\n\\nThe Red Chili noodles were pretty delicious! A bit overpriced, but yummy. I liked that it had a small kick to it and filled with yummy vegetables. I'm normally not a huge fan of Chinese eggplant since it gets all soggy in the traditional Chinese cooking method, but it was sauteed here and crunchy! It had a good ratio of noodles to veggies. \\n\\nOverall, nothing really stood out for for me. Even though the Red Chili noodle bowl was delicious, I felt that I could have gotten it for about $3-5 cheaper elsewhere. The Edamame dumplings were just too disappointing for me.

I had been to Morton's one time before for a private event where the prices had been removed from the menu so I had no idea just how spendy it really is. If we go to Morton's again we will... Have an appetizer (the Colossal Shrimp are amazing), skip the salad, order two steaks & one side (enough for two), skip the dessert & opt for a couple beers instead of wine. That should bring the total to $150 or so. The steaks were worth it in my opinion (we had the NY Strip & Filet Mignon) but the sides were kind of lacking (the steamed jumbo asparagus & mashed potatoes). When I had been before they had macaroni & cheese as one of their sides & it was absolutely delicious! I was looking forward to it but was pretty disappointed when I found it had been removed from their menu. Their version of the \\"wedge\\" salad was pretty tasty but Cr√®me Brulee was comparable to just about any other restaurant out there. The service was great!

Lucky for us we were able to get seated about 30 minutes before our reservation.  \\n\\nHowever, the service here, or at least the mentality here is very SLOW.

We wanted to take advantage of their oyster bar, DUH! But the variety of oysters did not have any descriptions tied with them.  So we were at the mercy of our waiter.

I know a number of people who live in Bexley and love the place.  I don't live in Bexley.  I do not have any fond childhood memories of eating this pizza.  So I'm left to judge the place not on nostalgia, but on the food.\\n\\nAs to all the comments on the cash only/run down facilities - if you do not appreciate small mom and pop places with a ton of history (I happen to gravitate towards them) then this place is definitely not for you.\\n\\nWhile I love the smaller shops with some history, they have to have the food to back it up.  The wife and I ordered our traditional pepperoni and mushroom.  Given the thickness of the crust, it was cold in a matter of minutes.  I can eat cold pizza with the most hung-over of college freshmen, but this was icy.  The crust was too thin for my tastes and there was nothing special about the sauce or toppings.  Cheese to sauce ratio (a biggie for me) was good, but not enough to save the day.\\n\\nIf you want a recommendation based on childhood memories and nostalgia, for me it would be Tostino's frozen pizza with the small, square bits of pepperoni (or what they called \\"pepperoni\\").

We made a reservation prior to driving there, but it was not necessary at all as they were not busy and had plenty of space. The hostess was friendly and sat us in a gazebo style table that was huge and an odd choice considering that our party consisted of two people. My boyfriend ended up sitting next to me, since it really felt like we were far from each other and wanted  to have a more intimate dinner. Our waitress visited to say hello and asked if we had looked at the menus. We told her we needed more time, and she just walked off. I had to get her attention to ask her for two glasses of water (I thought providing a glass of water for diners is sort of a given at restaurants). Our waitress was polite and nice, but not interested in spending any additional seconds at our table. We had to ask for recommendations, etc. This is a new restaurant, and I would imagine that the staff would be enthusiastic or at least instructed to educate patrons on their menu including the various Barbecue sauces that are not labeled on the table.The waitress did not provide any information on those either, and we were tired of having to ask for things that are pretty basic.\\n\\nWe ordered the Farmer's Daughter sliders as our appetizers, which come with fries. We were torn between three sides (each sandwich that we were considering came with one side), and the waitress recommended that we get the Mac n Cheese as substitute for french fries with the Farmer's Daughter Sliders. Well, when my boyfriend got the check, they had charged a $2.00 substitution fee that she never told us about... What's the point of substituting?! I would have rather just paid for the extra side! The Mac n Cheese was not really Mac n Cheese, but mostly pasta with white sauce... I think the \\"add cheese\\" and \\"bake in an oven\\" steps in the recipe were skipped. Also, We ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and the Show Stopper. The pulled chicken sandwich had coleslaw on it and it actually made the bread on the bottom very soggy. It also came with a nice sized sharp bone in the meat that is not only dangerous, but a turn off. Overall, the food was ok, but I am definitely not compelled to recommend to anyone we know. \\n\\nFor drinks we had the Merica Mule and Cherry Limade. The Cherry Limade was heavy on the Cherry side and tasted exactly like cough syrup. the Merica Mule was pretty generic and tasteless. The Merica Mule had a  brown and dry slide of lime that went with it (details...sigh). \\n\\nThere was a waitress or hostess that was standing at the hostess table by the door as we were leaving. She did not say a word or acknowledge us in any way. Generally, the appropriate thing to do is to say: \\"bye, have a good night! Thank you (for bringing your business to our newly opened restaurant)! \\n\\nMaybe we went on an off night maybe not... but, as a note to the Chef and Owner, there are too many good and solid Barbecue options in this city for anyone to tolerate bad service and mediocre food. I'd imagine for a newly opened restaurant that your staff would be a little more enthusiastic and willing to serve and make an impression on diners. Also, there is definitely room for improvement on food and drinks."},{"name":"Wings Over Somerville","address":"519 Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"2.5","text":"I've heard great things about this place and being a lover of fried chicken I had to try it.

There was also an option to swap the hashbrowns for truffle fries, which Mel did with her smoked salmon benedict ($12). Everyone has to do this, seriously. The whole area smelled of the delicious truffle goodness, and it's so much better than the hashbrowns, which were a bit plain. The beef short rib benedict ($15, not pictured) was pretty good as well. It was reminiscent of the fricass√© from Caf√© Medina, but not as hearty.\\n\\nI had the bacon and gruyere frittata ($12) with double smoked bacon, caramelized onion, and gruyere, which I thought was decent. I felt this one here leaned more towards the \\"omelette-side\\" rather than the \\"quiche-side\\". It was pretty decent, but I like the one from Twisted Fork more.

I went to Powell's to see if the rare book room could locate a copy, and found *two* copies on the main shelves.  I bought both (much less expensively than I had expected), and donated one to my alma mater for their library. \\n\\nAnother time, I decided to do some research on the Cherokee Nation.  I got the \\"starter set\\" of books at Powell's without having to wait weeks -- they had over two dozen highly-rated books about the Cherokee on their shelves.  Even better, the clerk I asked to help me was able to show me the three different spots in the store where I should look.  And better yet, they also shipped all of these books to me in California for a minimal charge. (I was in Portland for Christmas making my annual pilgrimage to Powell's at the time.)  \\n\\nYet another time, when shopping online, I found copies of both the original Austrian first edition of Michael Ende's \\"Die Unendliche Geschichte\\" and of the first American edition of the same book, \\"The Neverending Story\\".  I bought both -- *that* put a hole in my book-buying budget for a few months.  Shipping was free this time, and (best of all) my email address hasn't yet been spammed by Powell's.  Apparently they understand that buying from them doesn't mean you want to get marketed to, and instead they let you sign up for any email you want to get.  (I wish Amazon were so courteous.)\\n\\nI've also bought a lovely hardback revised edition of the Feynman Lectures, Cohen and Whitman' new translation of Newton's \\"Principia\\", and....

Savoy Dr is on the inside of the Perimeter - you'll also see the massive Bowlmore facility nearby so it might be fun to plan both a buffet and bowling adventure.\\n\\nBombay has been at the location for many years - it's an interesting if a bit dated building that contained many tables and a fairly simple buffet line, originally. It was also a bit tired and offered very mediocre food and eventually closed more than a year ago. I think the last time I ate at the original was over two years ago and I was little impressed. I'm happy to say that the new management has done a fantastic job both revamping the tired interior and producing much, much better food.\\n\\nThe exterior has been freshened up a bit, but it's really the interior that shines with new booths that provide a bit of intimacy that wasn't present originally, and much nicer, more upscale fixtures and trim details. There are also some rather astonishing expansive artworks on the walls that provide stunning vistas into Indian life and culture. Kudos to the designer who took this place to the next level - there's both elegance and style where previously there was none. I'd feel comfortable entertaining any group at this restaurant.\\n\\nI came during lunch and elected to have the buffet. Don't let the line fool you as there are many options that are a bit unobvious. The current hot-line has a soup kettle (which today contained a hot-and-sour soup that was spicier, more acidic and heartier than the typical mulligatawny), a long hot-table and a short table at ninety degrees that contained cold items. I thought the buffet food good but for a restaurant with Bombay in the name would have expected more Northern Indian items (even the Northern items seemed in need of a bit more spices as the flavors were a bit indistinct). The restaurant seemed to have more South-Indian items that belied its name (not that this is a bad thing but my South Indian friends noticed it right away). The other thing that was noticed, at least by my vegetarian friends, was that the veggie items were mixed with the meat items which is atypical of Indian buffets in the US - it doesn't bother me but Bombay may want to adjust this.\\n\\nThe other unexpected treat was the push-pot of Indian style latte - it wasn't the heavily spiced tea-cooked-with-milk that I experienced in Bangalore, but was still good and not something you typically see (although you can sometimes ask for it) - kudos to Bombay for having this extra touch.\\n\\nService in a word was fantastic, with many people coming by our large table and taking care of us. Between the updated interior, the decent food and the great service, I'll be coming back, as will my friends.\\n\\nEDIT 2015.07.26\\nI spotted a typo and thought to update this review slightly. Since I wrote this review I've eaten here a couple of more times and have had the same great food and service. If you come on Friday-Sunday the buffet is a couple of dollars more expensive, however you get an extra line added (so there's about 1/3rd more items to select), PLUS there's a chef setup to serve chaat - last friday this was a veggie samosa covered in chic peas, herbs, sauces and deliciousness (look at my photos).

(yes ladies there is a section where you might sit on the ground, be aware and dress accordingly or run the risk of flashing the place when you get up..trust) \\n\\nWe skipped the ramen this time as we had had it and wanted to try some different thing. much to my delight they had okonomiyaki. \\n\\nWe ordered that, quail eggs two cause i wasn't sharing, and the special was grilled salmon collar, and bacon. We also did a nigiri omakase. \\n\\nThe quail eggs are delicious. perfectly cooked with bulldog sauce on the side for your slathering pleasure. bulldog sauce is light a slightly sweeter thicker worchester, if you've ever has katsu it's a similar sauce. \\n\\nnext came the house made bacon, it could have been smokier, it could have been a little more crispy, but all in all that was proper japanese bacon paired with an excellent stone ground mustard. \\n\\nnext came sushi, it was a beautiful presentation, the nigiri was at the right temperature, slightly colder that room temp, the rice was perfect, the pieces were a little big but not a huge deal. the roll that came was the california roll, it was good. the tobiko was very fresh crunch crunch crunch. \\n\\nnext came the okonomiyaki, which much to my dismay didn't have any of the technique or awesomeness it really should have. it was the only thing that was really disappointing. however! the flavor was right. very right. all those memories of past matsuri and my dad over the tepanyaki grating the yama imo and laying out all those fantastic ingredients came flooding back. so just a couple of things, the texture was gooey and rubbery, this was made like a stuffed pancake, where all the ingredients were cooked separately and shoved into the pancake and folded over. that's not how you do it kids. but oddly the flavors did come through so it's hard to say. the batter should be softer lighter fluffier..something er. i dunno. \\n\\nbut the jewel which stole the show, grilled salmon collar, the coveted piece of fish besides the belly, for any japanese - is that true for the chinese too? don't know, but the cheek and collar are always fought over, and dad always won. sooooo good, all charred and delicious with daikon oroshi on the side. yumm. could have used a little bit of ponzu but eh no biggy.    \\n\\nSo the stars are for the food and the atmosphere, not so much the service. I don't like basing reviews on service as i have had excellent service there the first time. \\n\\nWe were seated right by the servers station and two different servers walked by us several times, not an exaggeration it was about 10 min before they came with water. she didn't ask if we wanted a different beverage, and walked away, about 10 more min and she came back asked what we'd like to order or should she come back. fearing it would be another 10 min before that would happen we quickly ordered. but other than that and the 20 min to get our bill after last of our dishes were cleared away, it was an enjoyable evening.

In a large restaurant with concrete floors and walls that is often noisy with conversation, the last thing one should play is techno or hypnotic-electronica-pop. All one can hear is the highest of highs and the lowest of lows, meaning bass, kick drum and hi hat (all electronic). These songs drone on, and are incredibly repetitive. As you sit in your seat you will discover an uneasy, almost angry feeling building in you. Eventually, to your dismay, you will want to stab the person next to you in the neck. \\nIt's not your fault. It's the music; not loud enough to hear fully, but too loud for comfort because the horrible droning beats that never shift nor contain any melodic quality (because all midtones - vocals, piano, guitars - disappear) being not so subtly floated above you are the completely wrong type of music for this venue. \\nGet it together, True Food.

The popular chicken wing dishes were overly salty and every dish in general was overpriced. I think they over salt the chicken so that people will buy the sides to balance out the dish. The coconut rice was extremely good but once again, super overpriced. The average for the dishes here is ~$15 and portions are small (i.e 6 chicken wings for $15 -.-). I should also warn people that a lot of dishes are spicy! (But there is a mild option). The boar dish was interesting to eat, but not worth ordering in my opinion. The boar dish is H E L L A spicy and it packs a punch!\\n\\nIn conclusion, the staff was friendly except the stupid receptionist and everything is overpriced. I definitely do not think this place is worth any wait and tourists should check out other places instead. \\n\\n#overrated"},{"name":"110 Grill","address":"170 Forbes Rd","city":"Braintree","stars":"4","text":"Tonight we had a dinner to celebrate our anniversary with 25 of our friends.

I thought to myself, \\"It's just pasta salad. You can't really mess that up.\\" This exceeded all my expectations. \\n\\nWe drove up to downtown Titusville, passing all kinds a beautiful historic houses along the river and parked in the back of the building. There's more parking available in the back anyway. He told me that this place was old and it certainly shows it. I did feel a little weird walking in to the restaurant from the back but I was assured that it was ok. This place had to have been over hundred years old! We went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was already packed. We got the last available table downstairs and ordered sweet teas. \\n\\nWhen the drinks came out, they were in at least 32 oz glasses. Holy crap, they don't play around here. My friend insisted on the Dijon Pasta Salad but only the half portion because the full portion was humongous. The dish is a house-made pasta salad with ham, turkey, or salami on a bed of lettuce. I ordered the half portion and I went with turkey. Tomatoes and Olives are also available upon request and I just got tomatoes. I love olives but I was watching my salt intake. I also saw \\"Titusville's Famous Chili\\" on the menu. I didn't know this town had \\"Famous Chili\\". How could I pass that up? I ordered a small bowl with cheese and onions on top and crackers on the side. The chili came out first loaded with my toppings. It smelled good so I dug in. The chili wasn't fantabulous but it was good. I'm used to my chili having more tomatoes and spices in it so I wasn't terribly impressed. Not long after, our pasta salad came out. WOW REALLY?!? My friend misled me in thinking the half portion was smaller. It was big and piled high. I was afraid to see what the full size portion looked like. Of course I couldn't eat it all thought that didn't stop me from trying. That thang was good so I ate half and boxed up the rest.\\n\\nThe place is well-known for their cobbler so I took some to-go. I chose the blackberry cobbler and ate it the following day. The filling wasn't overly sweet like additional sugar was added which made it just right.
