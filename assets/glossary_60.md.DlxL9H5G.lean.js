They were strong, creative, and reasonably priced. \\n\\nFor food, we started with the calamari. It was really unique because it was a mix of calamari, jalapeno peppers, and Mandarin oranges and the dipping sauce was Thai chili. It came served in a Chinese takeout box with chopsticks and it was awesome. Calamari is hard to deliver on and this one did not disappoint. \\n\\nFor entrees, we both had the same thing: red wine braised chuck short rib. It was wonderful. The short rib was almost like the most tender pot roast you've ever had. You didn't even need a knife to cut it. It came on top of black pepper spaetzle with crispy shallots and bourbon glazed carrots. We both ate every bite. \\n\\nI would for sure come back here and I would love to come when it's warmer for brunch and sit outside.

The pulled pork was flavorful, moist and had larger pieces of tasty pig rather than just a shredded saucy mess. \\n\\nThe sides were all outstanding.

I told her I understand why the owners would say this, and that her group needs to be respectful. BUT...as a pizza place on the path home from the middle school, one should expect to get some preteens that have been holding in their social energy at school and are excited to stop here, hang out for a bit, have some food, fun, and friend time. Which might mean getting a bit loud. The kids also complain about the fact that there is no bathroom. Where are they supposed to wash their hands or go when they have to...go? To the gas station? Dunkin donuts? \\n\\nI was also in here with my kids, another mom and her family at lunch on a cold, snowy MLK day, the place was full with moms and kids needing to get out. And ...NO slices? I was told they don't make slices on days like that day. Pies only. Makes little sense not to have slices when you have moms with little ones that are hungry and needing some food on the quicker side. We end up chasing or working to entertain the little ones in an effort to distract them while waiting for an entire pizza to be made. Little ones that are hungry and have to wait for their pizza can get loud or cranky, trust me.

From a decor standpoint SCK felt like a house that would be sitting in the 2008 version of Gone with the Wind.  I am not sure when it started, but the trend of putting restaurants in old houses, is pretty damn cool to me.  Hard wood floors that are easy to bust your ass on, and white linen table cloths give SCK a classic feel.  \\n\\nThe service was absolutely amazing.  And while thats not the end all be all for me, it certainly makes a dining experience incredible when your server knows the menu inside out, takes his time presentation, and can upsell food without sounding like he works at TGI Fridays.  Cant remember his name, but he was damn good.\\n\\nAs far as the food, I sampled/tasted a number of differernt items.  We started the meal off with Fried Green Tomatoes coupled with Goat Cheese.  These were pretty good, the goat cheese made them special, but I cant sit here and say that I wouldnt have been just as pleased with some tomatoes from Po Folks...yes, i said it, Po Folks.  Dont get me wrong, the tomatoes were good, but I would have liked to have more than three of em.........\\n\\nTwo soups were brought out for sampling purposes, one was the She Crab soup (or something like that) which was absolutely phenomenal,   The other was a soup that had collard greens in it, I cant remember the name of it, but it was pretty unforgettable.\\n\\nNext came the house salad that was tossed in a tasty vinagarette.  After that came the entrees.  I got the buttermilk fried chicken after hearing all the yelpers scream, shout, and dance about it.....and frankly, I expected more.  Not saying it wasnt good, I just thought it woulda been so good, I woulda ran out the restaurant....not the case, still, The Beautiful has the best friend chicken in Atlanta.  Period.  \\n\\nMy dining mate got the Braised Niman Ranch Lamb.  This lamb was so damn tender that it fell apart with the touch of the fork.

One of the servers walked down the line a few times carrying a cooler filled with beers, water, and other drinks. I bought a Topo Chico because I'm cool like that. I would definitely recommend getting something to drink, or simply bringing your own drinks. I saw many people bring their own coolers. Great idea. Don't die outside before you can get to the meat. That'd be awkward.\\n\\n2 hours pass uneventfully, and then the doors open and OMG YES MEAT HEAVEN LET ME IN. Once we got to the meat counter, we were able to sample a few items. We bought 1 lb. fatty brisket, 1 lb. ribs, 1/2 lb. turkey, 1 link of sausage. Don't waste your time on the turkey. Sausage is great, not excellent. Ribs are delicious, I should've got more. If I could eat fatty brisket every day for the rest of my life I would not complain one bit. Juicy, soft, tender, fat, nice peppery crust, no sauce necessary, savory, incredible. There are no words, except the words I just used to describe it. The irony...\\n\\nAnyway, the one small complaint I would have about the place is that inside, the AC units and fans are blowing like crazy.

Make sure to check their Facebook or Twitter page before heading over -- I missed them the first time I went over because it was too cold for them to operate.  The folks running the cart are cheerful despite the cold, and recognized several regulars and return customers.  While I was there, they also mentioned that they'll only be on campus now Wednesday through Friday as they start expanding to other locations.\\n\\nI was looking forward to trying the lamb pho which their Facebook fans rave about, but by the time I got there, they were just about out of lamb, so I got the last scraps of lamb tucked into a regular beef pho.  The noodles are put into a large cup along with sprouts if you like them, after which you are allowed to add as much or as little as you like of green onions, cilantro, jalapenos, and lime.  Your cup is then topped off with broth -- which is quite excellent, and not excessively salty as many tend to be.\\n\\nThe cart does accept credit cards (but no BuckID), which is great for those of us who rarely carry cash anymore. They were having a little trouble with their card reader when I was there, but there is an ATM just across the corner by Boston Stoker. Also, kudos for using paper instead of styrofoam or plastic containers.\\n\\nYou won't get beef balls, tripe or rare steak in your pho here (the beef is the well-done brisket style), but a steaming hot cup of beefy (or chickeny) goodness will set you back $8.  The tricky part for non-campus-ites is going to be finding a place to park and then driving away with a cup of hot pho balanced in your lap (I'd suggest walking a block up to the library and eating in there.  Bring me a cup, too, while you're at it.)\\n\\nEDIT: I thought this over a bit and it's really more of a 3.5 stars given the slightly steep price.

Would be cuter if they came in little tapas portion paella pans instead of on a plate.\\n- Sucking pig roast: The head of sitting in the open kitchen, facing the dining room, kinda weird/cool at the same time. The actual piece of pork was a little small. Skin was crispy but the meat could be more tender. Came with some polenta and a small salad, do wish that part was a little more exciting.\\n\\nThe meh:\\n- Oysters: Would be ok for $1 happy house, but otherwise not worth it.\\n- Korean short ribs: Like kalbi but in a salt and pepper style.

The food is less oily than Chinese food most other places, and the ingredients all very fresh, high quality, and properly cooked.  They don't skimp on the vegetables, and one can get a very respectable vegetarian meal there.  The trade off is that they seem to have some problems achieving a tasty balance of flavors and spices.  In fact, you would not be wrong to ask \\"what spices\\", in response to the extreme blandness of many of their dishes. Their soups seem all to be based on a mild vegetable broth, which is fine, if you are featuring seafood and certain vegetables, but is totally disappointing in their relatively flavorless version of hot and sour soup. Steer clear of their moo shu, which suffers from an excess of soy sauce.  Do NOT order the Szechuan bean curd, which consists of a huge bowl of bland brown sauce with soft tofu floating in it, no vegetables or other interest to be seen, and quite unappetizing.  Some better choices include garlic eggplant, garlic shrimp, some of the dishes featuring actual veggies, and the wonton soup.

I asked him why he doesn't have the popular garlic sauce available and he told me it's because it's unhealthy. I appreciate his honesty and the fact that he prepares his own tzatziki sauce, but that garlic sauce is what gives a donair that extra kick! Additionally, I was disappointed that the hot sauce he used was straight-from-the-bottle sriracha sauce. Biting into a donair with said sauce just doesn't work!

Below are some dishes I had during my most recent visit:\\n\\n1) HP4-Meatball w. crabmeat, bean noodle(xie fen shi zi dou sha guo)=In addition to the meatballs and bean noodles, Cafe 101 also addes green vegetables, mushrooms, taro, and rice cakes.   However, the overall flavor of this dish was just ok.  The meatballs weren't that good either.\\n2) C7-Basil chicken(san bei ji)=This was one of the two dishes we had that was good.  The chicken is served in a clay pot, and the flavors of the soy sauce, wine, sesame oil, and basil were present.   Since my friend said this restaurant was more Taiwanese than Sichuanese, it's a good thing Cafe 101 didn't screw up this traditional Taiwanese dish.\\n3) S19-Fish fillet, tofu in hot bean sauce(dou ban yu pian dou fu)=Terrible...this was basically frozen fish fillets dumped into Mapo Tofu.  Even if I were to review this dish as a \\"Mapo Tofu\\" dish in terms of flavor, I still say this dish is terrible.\\n4) V3-Chinese sauteed okra(qing cao si gua)=This dish was ok for me.  I've had better.\\n5) V7-Sauteed pea leaves(qing cao dou miao)=not bad\\n6) V16-Sizzling house tofu and ground pork(jia chang dou fu)=The texture of the tofu was off, and the flavor...it was similar to the flavors of the \\"fish fillet, tofu in hot bean sauce\\" dish.  Cafe 101 probably uses the same sauce base for \\"jia chang dou fu,\\" and \\"dou ban yu pian dou fu,\\" and I'm willing to bet they use it for their \\"mapo tofu\\" as well.\\n\\nSince it was Cafe 101's one year anniversary, we received free milk tea.  For me it was forgettable.  Four other of my friends agreed, while one said it was OK.  This friend finished his milk tea, and then took mine and finished it as well.  He is what we Chinese people call, \\"Zhu!\\" (\\"Pig\\"), haha.  I think he was just really thirsty though.\\n\\nWe also received a free cold cucumber appetizer and it was good.\\n\\n***check out my uploaded pics of the food***\\n\\nAmbiance(7.0/10)=This place certainly looks strange from the outside.  The ceilings are weird, and the decor of the place is a bit confusing.  I'm not sure what the owners were trying to do here.  Other than that, the place is clean.\\n\\nService(7.0/10)=Service is standard.  Nothing special.\\n\\nOverall opinion=I've watched many businesses open and close in this building since 1992.  Something about this location wasn't good for a restaurant business.  However, Cafe 101 may be the first business to survive in what I thought was a cursed building for restaurants.  This restaurant was packed during the Friday night I visited for the first time.  I'm not sure if the Chinese people of Atlanta really think this place is good, or they just come here because it's supposedly the best Taiwanese food Atlanta has to offer.  Overall, I wouldn't describe any of these dishes as \\"spectacular,\\" \\"amazing,\\" \\"out of this world,\\" \\"to die for,\\" etc.  I'm trying to find reason for the average 4.5 Yelp stars Cafe 101 has received based on 16 reviews as of 7/29/2008 (not including this review).

The hostess was not very friendly at all and this is a problem considering she's the first person greeting you at this establishment. The atmosphere was dark and dingy and did not give me an over all clean feeling. Our server was by far the most disappointing part of our evening. He approached our table seconds after we were seated asking us what we'd like to drink. We wanted waters to start and needed time to choose wine. He came back less than 2 minutes later asking if we had decided. We told him we had not and that we needed more time to peruse the selection. Less than 2 minutes later he was back and we felt rushed to choose, so we did. He asked if we were ready to order and of course since we were focused on the wine selection, we had not decided on our meal for the night and told him we needed more time. He came back 2 minutes later asking us yet again if we had made any decisions. The whole evening went on in this way, with him being there when we didn't want him and then when we did he was no where to be found. Finally, I decided to speak up at the end of our dinner to our server about his rushed and arrogant attitude. His response was that he was sorry that we felt that way!!!

Border Cafe, however, did not go overboard and I thank them very much for that!\\n\\nI loved the decor. I loved that you could sit outside if you wanted. I loved the colorful drinks. The menu was awesome. So many items, and many of them seafood. I ended up purchasing an appetizer as my meal, and I still had to left-overs to take home. I especially loved the never-ending basket of tortilla chips (probably why I had left-overs). Our server, Danielle, was super nice and very bubbly. We wanted to have a good time because she was having such a good time.\\n\\nPrices were extremely reasonable. I was expecting higher prices since it is Cambridge. My boyfriend bought the blackened salmon and he paid less than he would at a seafood restaurant in this area. Nice! I would definitely go back, and am thinking of ways to go again as I write this!

Absolutely beautiful views of the city here.  This is a great spot for a date.  We got to the place around 8:30 and only had a brief wait.  Snagged a table on the patio and it's so great to watch all the awesome fountains and kids playing and families having fun.  And did I mention the views?  Amazing view of downtown Columbus here.  We only had drinks and ordered the calamari which was really good.  The food coming out of the kitchen looked fabulous and a table next to us ordered the banana pudding which comes in an oversized mason jar which was really cool looking.  The wait staff (our waitress) was super super nice.  She said she liked taking a few minutes with each of her tables to talk, get to know them which is very rare to find these days.  I will definitely be back here to sample the food.  Tip - go valet.  It is $5 vs. literally a few steps away across the street is a pay lot for $10.  Wish I'd have done valet.  After you eat you can take a stroll along the river, swing on the swings with a front row view of Cosi & the river.  Again an amazing date location (which is what I went on).

My GF works at a research lab nearby, so she frequently has after-work drinks and food with her staff and myself.\\n\\nI know many have written a lot of praise here about the Pig and I am not here to knock its food or decor, with which I have no complaints. I am going to focus on mainly one thing and that's service. It's just plain awful time after time after time. It's become a running joke, as well as complaint with people we take here. If you pick a busy night count on half your food to go missing that you've ordered, a waitress to stop by your table once every half hour, etc. I've done my best to ignore this because the food has usually been decent, and they have a wide variety of drinks. I finally got pushed over the edge though this weekend.\\n\\nI stopped in with the GF at around 2:30PM on December 1st to have some lunch before heading to an event in the area.  When we entered there were only maybe 8 people in the entire restaurant-a table of four and two pairs of people chatting.  We seat ourselves and the waitress appears and drops us the menus. From here on it gets ugly...\\n\\nWe sit there for about about 15 minutes twiddling our thumbs and wondering what happened to the waitress in a basically empty restaurant when we realize she's sitting chatting with her friends at a table behind us. Yes, sitting down shooting the breeze about random stuff for 15 minutes with her friends while we're waiting to order. She finally gets up when they leave and heads over for our order. The order goes in and the chef springs to action (they have an open kitchen). We're almost the only two people there by this point, so when our food comes up we wonder where our waitress is. Oh there she is, talking with another friend at the bar who's come to visit. So the food sits cooling in front of the chef who goes back to staring at the wall waiting for it to get picked up. A while goes by again....Finally the food is delivered and we don't see her again until we finish. Well, I mean we SEE her, she's the one engrossed in a deep conversation with her friend at the bar, but certainly not with us. Time comes to pay and I pray she simply just runs my credit card and brings it back. Nope, she goes back to hanging out with her friend for a while. I almost got up and said something, but my GF didn't want a scene.\\n\\nIn the end, we wound up getting the worst of the pig when it should have been an easy score for them.  My compliments to the chefs-they work fast and hard and the food was fine. However, I loathe the waitresses here and I am now avoiding it and recommending to our friends to do the same.\\n\\nTo the management: I occasionally come with groups of about 10-12 people that have frequented your bar for a few years now roughly spending about $40 per-person on average between drinks and food, and tipping out your waitresses a minimum of 25% whether service is good or bad. We've been patient. You'd think since we throw $800-1000 a week to your place you'd do better, but you don't. Is it too much to ask to find a waitress who can take an order from 10 people and check back occasionally? You know, in case we'd like to order more things? Spend more money? Actually forget 10 people, how about an order from two people? \\n\\nMy opinion is that the Pig on a busy night has the worst service in Boston."},{"name":"Tia's Waterfront","address":"200 Atlantic Ave, Fl 1","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Tia's is about as much fun as skateboarding uphill. \\n\\nAt dinner - the floor under the table was filthy dirty.

Cauliflower was okay but did not go with the poached egg that well. Brussel sprouts were delicious. Pasta could have also used some added flavor. Overall, flavors were very mild (may work well for those with a mild palette), but the biggest thing lacking was presentation that places like these offer as an experience.

Wanton excess comes in several forms: too much food, or too much of the wrong un-healthy food, or too many calories in the food, or my-eyes-are-bigger-than-my-stomach ordering one of every food on the menu kind of excess.  You know.  You fellow Yelpers are with me.  We are a eatin' out kind of crowd.  So, it is with this attitude of wanton excess that I eyed the menu of Southern food at Screen Door. Hell no I didn't come here wanting healthy food.  I didn't come here thinking I could kid myself into eating less than a 2000 calorie meal.  I didn't come here thinking about salad (although the butter lettuce salad was mighty fine).  I came for the fried chicken, period.  Da-aaaamn.  That was a tasty plate of chicken.  I was so full by the time I was done that I rolled on out cursing the fact that I would have to do two or three extra workouts to burn it all off, but fat and happy nontheless.  It was delicious!  This was a case where the wanton excess was worth it! (that cannot be said of all meals, alas).\\n\\nI recommend the chicken, the greens, the salad (with butter lettuce, and what isn't made better with bacon?), and the tomatoes tasted like they came off the vine moments ago.  The mashed potatoes were fine, too.  Yeah, if you get there much past opening time then you are going to have to wait.  So either go early, or go prepared to wait.  But if you want the wanton excess of real tasty fried chicken with all the Southern food fixins, then it will be worth it.\\n\\nI only take one star off cause the prices did seem a bit too high to me.

I would have to say that everything was mediocre. The steak I ordered was flavorless, absolutely boring. The home fries were not good at all. the toast was overdone. The best thing about the whole experience was (You might have guessed it!) the location.  Being able to sit facing Newbury Street in Boston, and people watch. It's really too bad the food didn't equate the view.  Perhaps the reason for everything being so subpar was the flow of people. Cooking for lots of people in a quick pace could lead to the food not being quite up to my standards. Yes, I do have high expectations, especially if the price doesn't match the taste.  I had three bites of my unpalatable steak and homefries, didn't touch the burnt toast, and ate half a quarter of my egg whites only scrambled eggs. I asked to take it home, I knew I could salvage the steak with some garlic, peppers, sea salt, and olive oil.  The sad part is I left there hungry and went somewhere else. \\n\\nI do want to highlight that our server was professional and competent. However, he didn't seem to take notice that I didn't like the food, and I didn't want to bring negative attention to the occasion. \\n\\nI left and went somewhere else to eat.  I will go to Sonsie again, but not for brunch, and I will never order anything but, salad, pizza, etc.  I did have their Vanilla Bean Panna Cota back in 2014 and that was delicious.

Because of our size there was a 18% gratuity so I guess the waitress thought she could mentally check out and give us terrible service because her tip was already taken care of. Our group had planned to stay there and order several drinks but that atrocious service nipped that in the bud.

The menu has had a few change ups in the past year, fries no longer come with the burger, but they have added a lovely selection of Poutines. I recommend getting a large order and splitting it, then ordering a burger sans fries as they are nothing to write home about when they aren't slathered in gravy and cheese.They make their own pickles and pickled beets for the burgers, but I miss the side of pickled veggies that used to be on the menu. Totally hit the spot when I was pregnant and demanding all of the pickled food on the planet. \\nSpeaking of pregnant, despite the ratings, I don't feel that this place is really all that kid friendly. The first couple visits post baby were done with the help of a babysitter, but when I recently brought our almost 1yr old in, we weren't even offered a high chair, nor did I see any around to grab one. Maybe I was blind but it resulted in some very messy one handed burger eating. The restaurant itself is also a little too small to bring a possibly noisy child too, at least in my opinion. So maybe for older kids who can sit quietly and eat the kiddie burger its alright, but leave the other youngins at home. \\nThat being said, I have never been let down when in search of a hunk of beef to fill my burger craving, and as tempted as I am to try the turkey bacon burger, I just love the beef version too much."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Waited for an hour to be seated and then another half hour for our food, but OMG was it with the wait!

It just fell apart as I was trying to enjoy the frigging mess amidst a pile of dirty napkins. \\n\\nI gave it another try a year later, ordered the Gorgonzola burger and loved it.

It's a cool place to hang out and catch some games, more laid-back than the other joints in the neighborhood. It's also open late which is cool.\\n\\nThe main reason why I wouldn't give this place 5 stars is that the meat they use for their burgers is just some regular corn-fed beef instead of grass-fed beef like they have at Four burgers in Cambridge. Since ruminants can't digest corn,  they spend their lives knee-deep in diarrhea. Kinda gross. I would definitely be willing to pay a bit more if they had a diarrhea-free burger option.

I opted for fried green tomatoes, shrimp & grits and peach cake for dessert.\\n\\nOverall, my meal was filling and outstanding. The flavors are bold here and they do take a refined approach to classic Southern food. Things like adding a little goat cheese to the fried green tomatoes. Of the items I sampled, I'd say the shrimp & grits were my favorite; bold, Cajun-style sauce and creamy grits that were still soft and not gluey. It was a truly memorable dish. The peach cake was so-so, I should have take their suggestion and gone for the banana dish. \\n\\nThe staff here are really lovely, especially at the bar.

God knows, I've given it plenty of chances.\\n\\nSituated an odd half-block off Huntington Avenue between the Longwood Medical Area and Brigham Circle stops on the E spur of the Green Line, the Squealing Pig's primary virtue is that it isn't a hospital cafeteria. Think on that for awhile. \\n\\nThe small rectangular restaurant is divided into two rooms, one long big room and one smaller square room, with a straight bar that runs almost the length of the big room. And as much as I like eating at a bar, this one feels uncomfortable as there's no way to sit without your back to the door. It feels exposed and, like the rest of the room, chilly, what with all the wood - tables, chairs, benches - and the high ceilings -- as though nobody tried to warm the space architecturally or otherwise. \\n\\nThe Squealing Pig always is chilly, both actually and metaphorically.\\n\\nToday, for example, as four of us sat by the door to the second room, almost as far from the outside door as you can dine and still be in the main room, I could feel the cold on my back. The smaller room -- which is where I ate last time I was here with the same work crowd - is warmer but more difficult to be served since to get service you always seem to have to flag down someone from the disaffected service staff. Why is it when a restaurant has bad service, it has bad service across the board? Oh, right: management.\\n\\nIt was lunch. Not crowded. We are a no-fuss table. Two diet cokes, a water, and one beer. Three sandwiches and one salad. Not quite an hour. We're in happy conversation. Even so, when one of us asks for a soda refill, the server drops the check on the table and sneers, \\"We charge for refills.\\" \\n\\nWhoa. Okay, you charge for the sandwiches, too, and yet don't remind me when I order. You charge for beer but bring it to me anyway. I'm a customer: just bring me a drink and add it to my bill.\\n\\nOr not. Who charges these days for a soda refill? We'd already spent $75. If the bias is against college kids monopolizing a table, uh, okay. But a policy designed to prevent loitering shouldn't be used to refuse service to customers during a meal. If we'd asked for coffee, would she have refused? Where's management in this? And, note, last time we were there, no charge for a refill. \\n\\nWhile I don't want to make a harsh generalization - ah, heck, of course I do. Whenever somebody says, \\"let's do Squealing Pig,\\" I groan inwardly. Anywhere else! The service is, like the food, mediocre.\\n\\n(Ask me about the whiskey pour: two of us at the bar. We're together. We order the same bourbon neat. One of us gets fully twice the pour. Twice. What's with that?)\\n\\n(The Pig could be so much better than it is. The location, the beer list, all that pork, a panini machine....)\\n\\nThe food: the menu is unnecessarily complicated. There's a turkey reuben but no ruben? I bet that's a hot seller! They'd probably do better to streamline it. So I order the Cubano, a panini with ham, cheese, pork, jalapeno relish, and garlic mayo. This $13 sandwich came with about a dime's worth of meat, not enough to spread one layer across the bread, and that's with two kinds of meat. And where was the cheese? After close inspection, I find a tiny bit beneath the single layer of meat. The garlic and relish were MIA. A real Cuban has pickle, an essential component of the taste, a lapse so obvious with this sandwich that I reread the menu to make sure I'd ordered what I thought I had. I'm still wondering about that jalapeno relish, something I would have loved to have tried. \\n\\nThis sandwich is to a cuban like a cigarillo is to a cigar.\\n\\nIt came with fries, which were just okay. Unsalted from the kitchen, it took doctoring (ha!) at the table with malted vinegar and salt to make them edible. Sometimes I think it's me but when everybody gives me a knowing nod and follows me to the salt and vinegar, I know it's the kitchen, not my table.\\n\\nAnd then i think, maybe this is a health thing. You know, we're in the medical area, half the customers are wearing scrubs, limit the salt, limit the cheese, limit the meat....\\n\\nNah. This is just mediocre food, so underwhelming that it always feels overpriced."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I tried Dirty Frank's for the first time a couple weeks ago, and oh my.

So when I was desperate to get out of the office yesterday, I walked the two blocks down to Cypress Street.\\n\\nWhen I got to the restaurant, hidden behind the Biltmore, I realized it used to be Toast, one of my former favorites. And based on the great lunch I had at Cypress Street, I think it's going to be one of my new favorites. \\n\\nTaking a seat at the bar, I was surprised to find a menu chock full of so many options...lots of apps, burgers, sandwiches, salads, pizzas, etc. Seeing how it was cold and I had comfort food on the brain, I actually cobbled a meal out of starters: southwest chili and the mini corn dogs (a purely nostalgic choice).\\n\\nWhile I waited for my lunch, I chatted with the friendly bartender about some of the beers they had on draft. As a former Coloradan, it warms my heart to see Fat Tire on draft. But Cypress Street also had a specialty New Belgium brew I've never tried. Seeing as I was working, I couldn't really order a drink, but the bartender offered me a taste. It was a sour brown ale that turned out to be surprisingly apple-y. \\n\\nOnce the food arrived, I was equally surprised by how good it was. Sure, it's bar food, but it's really good bar food. The small cup of chili was chock full of steak and chorizo. My serving of \\"corn puppies\\" was pretty generous, too. There were six sizable portions of all-beef mini dogs and the cornmeal coating tasted like my Mom's cornbread.\\n\\nAll in all, I was quite pleased with the meal and the service. For years, I've been looking for a friendly neighborhood bar where the grub is as good as the beer list.

The interior is very hip, especially compared to the other restaurants in the strip center. The line was very efficient, and a helpful employee assigns you a table (or space at a community table), and answers any questions about the menu so that you're ready to order when you get to the cash register.  I ordered the vegetarian Ramen along with a corn bomb. I was a little disappointed that I couldn't order the type of noodle that comes in one of the non-vegetarian options. Apparently if I want to try that I have to pay for additional noodles. A little frustrating, but not a huge deal.  \\n\\nShortly after we sat down, we were informed that they had run out of the corn bomb.  That seemed a little surprising for 130 in the afternoon, but The server said he would refund our money. Instead, we asked and he allowed us to substitute a red chili bomb and a spicy bomb.  The edamame came out quickly and was perfect. The ramen arrived a little later and was very good, and it was nice to be able to add the spicy bomb a little at a time to flavor it perfectly.   I love the option of being able to adjust your own spice, and I appreciated that the broth was not too salty. Normally I am not much of a Ramen fan because it is too salty.

The first time, I had a pulled pork biscuit sandwich that also came with a small side of grits. The pulled pork was delicious and the whole sandwich was made of great ingredients that really came together; it had an egg, the awesomely seasoned pulled pork, a fried green tomato, and this tasty sauce. It was super juicy and really messy, but it was gooood. \\n\\nOn my second visit, I shared the 3 piggies with my husband; this had grits on the bottom, a biscuit with bacon and an egg in the middle, and it was topped with sausage thyme gravy. I almost wished that I had my own entree because it was so tasty! The thyme gave the gravy an interesting new flavor, but it didn't overwhelm it, either. There was a good amount of bacon in it, too.

It's the crispy, spongy crust that is the star here, everything else plays a supporting role. As for the ambiance it's possible to nice romantic dinner there, with wine even. Trust me, I met a couple doing just that. Most conveniently, there is liquor available right next door. I would highly recommend coming here in the dead of winter and sit next to the cozy wood burning oven. The proximity to other people compels everyone to interact, in a good way.

Mouth-watering. Flavorful. Fresh.

The Eggs Benedict, with its avocado and habanero lime hollandaise sauce, got 2 votes for the favorite, but I swayed toward the Heovos with its fresh salsa, perfectly cooked eggs, and smooth as butter black bean puree. The french toast was also quite good, but just a bit too sweet to eat the whole thing for breakfast. Perfect to compliment our hearty eggs and add a dessert course to our brunch though!\\n\\nMy guests and I also ordered a round of their bloody mary's. To be honest, as a matter of personal opinion, I didn't like mine. I appreciate the fresh tomato juice, but it made it a bit too chunky. The flavors also seemed off - too much smoky spice that overwhelmed the tomato. I'm the only one who didn't like it, so it's really just preference. \\n\\nThe only reason Masa doesn't get a fifth star is the service - it was pretty slow. I know it's busy, but as a popular restaurant in Boston, known throughout the city, you are expected to be able to handle the rushes. I was disappointed I had an empty coffee cup by the end of my meal that never got offered to be refilled. \\n\\nThat aside, I will definitely be back.... especially considering how affordable it is!

First stop on the list was Franklin's on a Friday morning.  As it happened, Aaron Franklin was in San Francisco as part of his book tour the same weekend I went to his place in Austin.  But, I wasn't deterred, this operation was in good hands by the pros running the restaurant in his absence.  I flew to Dallas from San Francisco, got in at midnight, rented a car, made the 3 hour drive to Austin, set my alarm and slept in the car down the street from Franklin's.  The thought of getting in line at 4 am seemed a little silly, I didn't see anyone else and wondered if the line stories were exaggerated. Alarm went off at 6:30.  Line was formed, I was number 15, grabbed a lawn chair (provided by Franklin's) and camped out.  Within an hour, at least 100 more people showed up and the line stretched down the street and around the corner.  More people showed up by the minute.  The line experience is great, everyone is friendly, coffee shop around the corner.  It's less of a line and more like a festival atmosphere, they serve beer, there's music and no one is going to try to steal your place in line if you have to take a bathroom break or go to get coffee.  Restaurant bathrooms are open to the line crowd with no problem.  Your line neighbors become fast friends.   If you're going, get in line before 7, don't want to go through the trouble and not get any food!  I'm sure line friends are more friendly toward the front of the line where everyone is assured of getting BBQ; those toward the back are rolling the dice that their wait won't be in vain.  Franklin's opened at 11 and the line moved fast.  I got brisket and sausage.  I wish I got the ribs also in hindsight, but generally I'm not a fan of TX ribs and I was really here for the brisket.  I had high expectations for the brisket, really high.  Brisket met expectations, it was all that they say it is. However, the smoke profile was light to non-existent.  That's not my preference, but here the texture and moistness of the brisket carry the day, it was A+.  The bark is flavorful, tacky and sticky.  The meat itself is moist and supple, bathed in its own rendered fat.  Everyone has a different subjective preference for their BBQ, I personally like smoke.  Franklin's brisket walks the razor thin line of not allowing any one flavor, including smoke, to overpower or dominate the bite.  And this is part of the art that Aaron Franklin perfected.  The smoke flavor is ephemeral, slight hint of smoke, but it's fleeting and after taking a bite you wonder to yourself if you taste smoke or just smell smoke, you're not really sure.   Sausage is fantastic, but to me, this was the norm across most of the places I tried.  I didn't meet a link in Texas that I didn't like.  The unique standout here at Franklin's is the brisket. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is, as it turns out, there are many places in central Texas and in Austin doing it just as good or close enough without the line and without the tourists.  I never talked to or saw a local in line. All people in the line that I talked to in 5 hours were tourists like me from around the country and even the world. As far as the BBQ and especially the brisket, this place is not over-hyped, it's the real deal.  The food, the BBQ process and quality of prime brisket used, customer service, the care and pride in the operation, this has rightly become the new standard to which all other BBQ operations are measured by.  It was great, but to me, at the end of the weekend, not my favorite BBQ in Texas.

Their combinations sound good, bit they just don't come together like they should. The other problem is that I was probably comparing it to a place in that state up north which I think is perfection on a bun.

She answered (and even anticipated) all of my questions. Offered helpful suggestions, and was attentive and sweet.\\n\\n-I tried the Cherry Libre and it was delicious! Just the right mix of rum, coke, and cherries.\\n\\n-My bf tried the strawberry shake, so I stole a sip (or three!) and it was by far the best strawberry shake I've tasted. (And the waitress told me blackberry... or was it marionberry?... shakes are coming soon, too. I might go back for those. Maybe?) \\n\\n-The pickled beet on my burger (that my server suggested! Thanks again!)  was yummy!\\n\\n-The place was clean (bathrooms included, which is important to me!)  and the posters on the walls brought back great memories and sparked many good conversations.\\n\\nOn the downside:\\n\\n-Parking kinda sucks. And I drove right pass this place countless times without ever noticing it. I had to be looking for it before I figured out where it is. So more as a suggestion rather than a criticism: get better signage?\\n\\n-I ordered the black and white fries as an appetizer for our table, and they never came. When our food order showed up first, my bf suggested they'd come after. Thinking that would be strange for an appetizer to come *after* the meal but not wanting to make a fuss, I didn't call the waitress on it. We never got them, she never brought it up, I decided to let it go (they do have large french fry servings that come with the burgers) and therefore never got to try them. Bummer. \\n\\n-The other people who worked there (hostess, other servers, etc.) seemed... well... just not as friendly as our server. I am friendly. I like friendly. So sue me, Portland.\\n\\n-I went on one of the few days Portland is hot (I think we hit 96 that day?) and the place was too hot to be comfortable, for me. They did offer outdoor seating, but part of the reason we went OUT to eat is because I don't have a/c at home. But probably does not apply/does not matter on the other 350 days of the year. \\n\\n-And finally, the burgers themselves: They were just... so so? I mean, good. But not GREAT. I wanted to be wowed. I was simply full. I wish they had different options for buns. I know this is just being picky, but I don't like sesame buns, and that is all they offered. You would think at least ONE bun choice would be seedless? Anyway, I felt like I could have fired up the BBQ at home and made a much better burger myself. If it had been cheaper ($6-7?) maybe I wouldn't be complaining. (With the cheese a pickled beet mine came to $9.) With the tip, 2 burgers, 1 alcoholic drink and one shake --no appetizer, no sodas, and no dessert-- we managed to have a bill of nearly $40 for two.

The chicken was smoked and a bit too salty and otherwise unmemorable except for the strange dark brown color it had.

Cured's side of the space is sort of a hodgepodge of items with everything from canned seafoods (think cockles and calamari) to olive oils, refrigerated salads and even pretzels.  Then behind all of that they have a deli counter where they make  sandwiches and picnic lunches.  \\n\\nMy wife actually had her eye on one of the pretzels that they sold here and so for breakfast we decided to split a gruyere cheese pretzel as well as one of their breakfast sandwiches.  After ordering the breakfast sandwich we proceeded to the register in the front of the store and paid which seemed a big weird.  Then we headed back to the back of the store and waited 5 minutes or so for the breakfast sandwich.  While we were waiting for the sandwich I dug into the pretzel.  It tasted quite good, especially whenever you got some gruyere, although was very salty.  Even so I really enjoyed it.  Our breakfast sandwich also ended up being really good.  At $6 it better have been!  It consisted of some speck, cheese, egg and a tomato relish (or something similar) all on an English muffin.  The speck was nice from the standpoint that it gave the sandwich some flavor and saltiness.  However it was the tomato relish that really made the sandwich for me bringing a good flavor and some acidity.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.

We got there about 10 minutes before they opened and stood in line for maybe 20 minutes before we were at the register placing our orders. The noise level in here is about a 9 out of 10, as the music is turned up way loud and the acoustics are horrible. As many other reviewers mentioned, there is a marked paucity of seats, and while there are 4-tops along the walls, the middle of the restaurant is taken up by a large, communal style table. If you are just there with one other person, you will most likely end up there. While you are waiting in line to order, there is a server who is assessing the seating situation and handing out numbers kind of like how Hopdoddy does.\\n\\nI ordered the tonkatsu sho-yu and my roommate had the \\"Mi-so-not\\" (#3). The food arrived less than 5 minutes after we were seated. The broth was very rich and dimensional in terms of flavor; however, it was borderline overly salted. The first half of the bowl I was thinking \\"Ok, this is good, I like it\\" but after that my tastebuds revolted and I couldn't finish the rest of the broth due to the high salt content. The noodles, marinated egg, bamboo, and pork belly were good though, no complaints there. Not sure what is in the \\"special blend of soy sauce\\" that is in #2 but maybe they could switch to the low sodium soy sauce? \\n\\nGoing back to the horribly loud music, I feel like it's a part of the restaurant's strategy to get tables turned quicker. I mean, who wants to linger over a meal with someone if they can't hear the other person? In addition, the waiters have eyes like hawks, and as soon as you put down your chopsticks one materializes by your elbow asking if they can take that for you.

For having such a small menu, you'd think they'd be able to put a little more effort into something that comprises like 20% of their food selection.

Wasn't exactly soft on the inside either. If you're a vegan visitor, there are much better places to check out for the burg. \\nThat being said, vegan or not, the truffle fries are still worth buying! You get a lot of fries for what you pay for and it's so, so good. It's pretty greasy, as truffle fries tend to be because, duh, truffle oil, which makes it sit pretty heavily in your stomach.

We were both really happy with our food and the service. We shard the escargot and the veal sweetbreads. Both dishes were terrific. The escargot were nicely cooked and not chewy, and the sweetbreads were pan fried and deftly prepared with an excellent accompaniment. \\n\\nFor our main courses I had the sturgeon and my son had the gnocchi. His gnocchi weren't what I am used to (the soft pillows of potato and flour), but they were excellent, nevertheless. My sturgeon was perfectly cooked and served with green French lentils in a harissa curry. \\n\\nMy only slight gripe was the wine list. Prices are steep and choices are slim. Want to pay $72 or $96 for a Bordeaux? Certainly a restaurant of this quality could find a couple more choices for less, especially when there are lots of choices available locally at $10-15 retail. I'm glad I opted for the Oregon pinot noir at $42, as it was a good choice and went well with the meal. But please, a few more choices at the $38-50 price range, please. \\n\\nMy son and I passed on dessert and ordered the cheese plate. I honestly can't say I was knocked out by this. Two cheeses - a goat and a sheep, and both tasting about the same (although texturally different). I would think a better choice would be to include a blue of some kind or an aged cheese, to offset the sameness of the sheep and goat. It's too bad that way too many American restaurants consider the cheese plate as an afterthought. Restaurants in Europe pride themselves on this aspect of a meal. \\n\\nAnother slight problem was when my son ordered an absinthe. He had to point out to the bartender where the correct glasses were behind the bar. Amazing these days that bartenders can make numerous cocktails but don't know the right glassware to use for various drinks, and it's especially distressing in a restaurant like Cocotte where there is a definite leaning towards things French. I had thought about having a pastis before dinner but I know all-to-well that American restaurants generally never have the right glasses nor know how to make a pastis -  even though there are bottles of Pernod and Ricard behind the bar. \\n\\nI do appreciate the fact that although there is a French \\"connection\\" at Cocotte, they have avoided the pretentious inclination of many \\"French\\" restaurants to have the menu in French with English \\"translations.\\" We're in the US. For those of us who speak French, we know what the food is already, and those people who don't speak French likely could care less!\\n\\nAlthough I mentioned it briefly at the beginning, service was impeccable and everything a diner could ask for.

Therefore, I was able to taste a variety of dishes which allows me to write a relatively well-rounded review of the restaurant.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\n1)Flash fried calamari w. lemon pepper tartar sauce=Calamari is lightly fried but wasn't seasoned well.\\n2)Skillet steamed mussels w. white wine, garlic, and parsley=This dish was OK. Some of the mussels were overcooked.\\n3)Avocado and tuna sashimi w. cucumber noodles, kombu dashi=I didn't taste this dish, but the person in our party that ordered it said it was \\"good.\\" \\n\\nPasta:\\n1)Shrimp filled ravioli w. basil, cherry tomatoes and winey olives=meh, this dish was forgettable. \\n\\nMain Dishes:\\n1)Grilled swordfish w. smoked summer vegetables and lemon whipped potatoes=This dish has a Louisiana/Cajun essence to it. The meat of the swordfish is nice and delicate, and the exterior of the fish is seared very well. Also, of all the dishes we had, this was the only dish that was seasoned well. \\n2)Country roast chicken w. garden vegetable mash and pan gravy=The meat of the leg quarter is roasted well, and the meat is juicy and falls of the bone. The garden vegetable mash is basically vegetables blended into mashed potatoes. \\n3)Fork tender braised lamb shank w. ricotta filled gnocchi and basil gremolata=As the name states, the lamb shank was fork tender.  Unfortunately, the meat itself was tasteless. The ricotta filled gnocchi were good and you can tell they were made from scratch.\\n\\nDessert:\\n1)Warm peach crostata w. chambord whipped cream=This was probably the best dessert of the four we had ordered. The crust of the crostata is light and fluffy like a croissant.  The flavor of the peach filling was nice.\\n2)Classic red velvet cake w. cream cheese frosting=The flavor is good but not great.  The cake itself is a bit on the dry side.\\n3)White coffee creme brulee w. sugared raspberries=Like appetizer #3, I was unable to taste this dish because the girl that ordered it was not willing to let the rest of our party try it. When I asked what she thought of this dish, once again her answer was \\"it's good.\\"  \\n4)Warm chocolate bread pudding w. chantilly and chocolate drizzle=I actually liked this dish, but I think an ice cream or a gelato pairing would've been a better combination with a hot chocolate dessert. \\n\\n***check out my uploaded pics of the dishes***\\n\\nService (8.5/10)=Service was really good and our waitress made an effort to connect with us. She was full of energy, very personable, and always had a great smile. Our water glasses were always full, and we were asked if everything was alright at our table.\\n\\nAmbiance (8.5/10)=A really nice and cozy place. The seats were very comfortable and tables were spaced out nicely.  At the front of the restaurant, there is a small patio-like space with smaller tables, and it's a bit more cramped. However, this section is a great area to mingle with other people or for people-watching. Various pictures can be found on the walls, but I'm uncertain what the overall theme is.\\n\\nOverall opinion=Overall, I think the food here is forgettable.

Obviously if you can read, you can see I chose Aria.\\n\\nAt first I was freaked the hell out, because I have never had my car valeted before, as I am really weird and can't deal with people touching my car. I also had this inferiority complex come into play when we pulled it up next to a Lamborghini and an Aston as my passenger door squeaked open from the cold. \\nSince my car hates everyone, it did later give the valet issues in starting it, which made me feel oddly better.\\n\\nAnyway, this place is odd. It feels like you're in an elaborately decorated house that only has a lounge room and a dining room. We were early for our reservation, and they could have seated us early, but we decided to go to the bar. The bartender made me an Aviation which made me insanely happy. It was HUGE, and by the time I was done I was feeling tipsy.\\n\\nI didn't finish it until we were seated in the dining room, and actually I didn't finish it...it was taken from me by the server with a good bit still left in the glass. I then ordered a glass of Cremant D'Alsace, which he mistook for some awful red wine. I had to then point it out to him on the menu. However that wine was awesome, despite being $13. I shall make up for that ridiculous upcharge when I spend time in Alsace, so there.\\n\\nWe shared the beet salad with goat cheese for a starter. I have started to seriously love the combination of beets and creamy goat cheese. I was amazed I convinced my boyfriend to try it.\\n\\nFor an entree, I decided to have duck for the first time. This was a bit off putting at first because it was more pan fried than pan seared, considering the breading and scent similar to fried chicken. The taste was weird at first, but I started eating the cabbage and turnips and carrots that came with it, and it really brought out an amazing flavor in the duck. I had ordered it medium well, but I would even go with medium. \\n\\nFor dessert, I ordered the Fuji apple tart, which was much larger than I really wanted after so much other food. I somehow was supposed to eat it all by myself, but I managed to get the boy to eat a few bites...thankfully the caramel ice cream was all mine. I wouldn't have shared it anyway. It was ridiculously hard to just pick one dessert because they all sounded amazing.\\n\\nIt's a nice spot for a celebration, and it's just as easy to spend less than $100 as it is to spend over $300. The service was just kind of a let down for how much it does cost. I thought I made myself pretty damn clear about Cremant D'Alsace but whatever. It was a nice of him though to ask me how I enjoyed duck.\\n\\nI don't know if I would ever choose it again for a special occasion, but it was a good experience for me. \\n\\n#Yelp365 - 3/365"},{"name":"Bono Pizza","address":"1717 Northwest Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing hidden gem in Grandview.

Kitchens close around midnight in some of the other spots so Edgewood pizza is an easy go-to.  Now knowing this, their ordering process should be better.  I was hanging out with friends and we walked in and it was chaos.  Some people had their food, some were seated at tables with to-go boxes and then there was a crowd around the bar area.  There were 2 young ladies running around looking frantic and then one older guy that kinda went back and forth to the kitchen.  I didn't know if he was a cook or taking orders, it could've been both.  So as we sat at the bar area, me waving my hand to get the attention of the two ladies that ran around with their heads down to place my order, I watched other people walk in after us and immediately get served.  Now part of me wanted to get upset but my stomach kept reminding me that we needed to eat.\\n\\nSo I kept it cool and calm because one thing you don't do is upset the people that fix your food. (foodie rule number 1).  So after I watched yet another group of people walk in AFTER me and get immediately served I'd had enough and I finally told my quiet, polite side to saddown and allowed my Aries side take over which, by God, got attention and *gasp* service. WOW!  Look at gawt! **side eye**  So the guy (mentioned earlier) walks over and I say \\"King Cheese for my friend and King Pepperoni for me\\". Cool he prints up he receipt, we pay and we wait.  Yaaay.  I'm a little peeved BUT happy my food is coming.  I excuse myself to the ladies room and come back to my friend holding two containers. I was elated until I opened the containers...hmmmm they look the same...uuuh wait.  Ok Aries have at it again... \\"excuse me sir, can you come here? thanks. Yes, there has been a mistake.  I asked for pepperoni and this is cheese.\\"  Foodies...do you know that this dude argued with me that I ordered two cheese slices.  Ok Foodies...grab a mirror and look in it and look at your lips and say the word \\"cheese\\" and say the word \\"pepperoni\\" and tell me if your mouth looked the same...go ahead I'll wait.\\n**pause**\\nAAAAAAnd we're back....so the dude was like I'll put pepperoni on it...I said \\"so now you're going to drop cold pieces of meat on top of the cheese?\\" my friend then reminded me of foodie rule #1 and I got my cheese pizza from dude and walked out as I said \\"I will be writing about this on Yelp and I won't be back!\\"\\n\\nAll of that said, the slices were good but I won't be back!  Shouts out to the owner for your concept and your vision and the artwork on the walls but your staff is messing up.

Here, you won't find Californian-ized pizzas - no BBQ chicken abominations, no gluten-free options, there isn't a 17 page fusion inspired menu of things to go terribly wrong.  No, authenticity, simplicity, and perfection is the name of the game here.  You can get pizza in one of 12 varieties, meatballs (if you insist), the obligatory calzone and a salad.  Desert options of cannoli and nutella pizza are on the menu too but don't count on being hungry after eating their generously sized pizzas.  Attention is paid to detail with everything made right before your eyes beginning with the dough in the glass-walled dough room to the assembly line where the dough is hand tossed, assembled and ultimately handed off to the Pizziola for a 90 second stop in the ovens before coming right to your table -- hold the heat lamps please.  With long tables, reasonable prices and good selection of Italian wines, beers and waters Desanos will make a great place for group gatherings from families to league teams.

The breading was crispy and fatty, but light and airy - a very good compromise for an appetizer dish. The sweet Thai chili sauce was basic, but good. The deep fried slices of jalapenos and orange pieces among the calamari was a great addition, as it was not too spicy, not too sweet, but provided something to break up the monotony of the squid.\\n\\nI ordered the Blackened Cobia over dirty rice, which turned out to be one of my favorite dishes in Columbus. The spice rub was enough, but not overdone to the point of pounding home the \\"Blackened\\" title. The real star was the spicy tomato butter sauce that came with it. The two of us were dipping everything we could into that until I realized I was running low and blocked her fork from my plate. It was sweet and had the consistency of a tomato soup, but smooth buttery spicy kick to it as well.\\n\\nThe server was very polite and allowed us to have the walleye special paired with the sides of the walleye on the menu, as my dining partner really wanted the ratatouille. The fish for both if us was perfectly cooked and was hot and flaky, very nice balance of flavor.\\n\\nI had to drop one star off due to the cocktails. They have an impressive list of about 10-15 cocktails, and each one had a very interesting mix of flavors and components. We ended up having three each because we wanted to try them, but none popped out. Most were OK, but for some, the ratios of ingredients seemed off.

I was not prepared for this eating experience by any means. Food doesn't really get more delicious than this.\\n\\nThis place is kind of like Rino's in East Boston, only more accessible. \\n\\nSo my mother had picked the place, which I was a bit upset about as I had my heart set on Oya's right down the street in Malden (where I had never eaten before). But, as soon as I stepped foot in Nappi, a small, square room with candle-lit tables and a homey, old-fashioned feel and got a whiff of the delicious Italian food scents in the air, I let go of my pride and knew right away that I was in for something good. \\n\\nMy mother and I sat down and asked for a wine menu. Our waitress informed us that Nappi is BYOB, so my mother sent me on an errand to the store because who are we to dine at an Italian restaurant without a lovely bottle of wine? So I went down the street to the liquor store and picked up a bottle of Gnarlyhead Pinot Grigio (highly recommended) and headed back to the restaurant.\\n\\nI sat down and noticed that my mother had ordered us an appetizer (Btw, there is no real menu--the waitress will read you a list of all the dishes that they offer, and you can mix ingredients if you like--very old school like that). \\n\\nMy mother had ordered the shrimp and plum tomato appetizer which came with a few crunchy, golden brown crostinis. This dish was divine. The shrimp was soft and delicate and full of flavor, while the plum tomatoes added the perfect touch of freshness to balance out the slight spice in the red sauce (not overly spicy, just enough). This appetizer is a necessity.\\n\\nIn an Italian restaurant, for the main course, I always desire veal, but I don't always get it because I've had a lot of bad experiences with chewy or tasteless veal, or a wine sauce that's about as sweet and delicious as a dog bone. But at Nappi, among the old-school environment and the delectable scents invading my nose, I knew I had to take the chance. I ordered the veal saltimbocca, and Nappi delivered. The veal was soft and tender, the prosciutto on top was cooked just enough and of high quality (not that Carando BS) and the wine sauce was balanced and flavorful. I chose linguini for my pasta which was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. I would've finished my dish, and the only reason I didn't was because I had eaten a late lunch. Lord knows that I would've devoured the very last parcel on my plate if I could have.\\n\\nMy mother was just as happy with her dish. Another veal lover, she ordered the veal marsala, and again, her veal was cooked perfectly and her marsala sauce had an extra special sweet kick to it. My mother, another foodie like myself, ate as much as she could. We didn't want to stop, but we had to. \\n\\nWe didn't order dessert because we were so full, but looking back on it, I regret not opting for a cannoli or something of the like which I could've scarfed down on my way home when the fullness wore off. Oh well, next time.\\n\\nAll in all, I am really impressed with this restaurant. The fact that I was against going to this place originally is ridiculous. I'm sure Oya is great, too, but as a true lover of Italian food, Nappi was a real find (Thanks, mom). \\n\\nThere are a lot of good Italian restaurants around, but Nappi, with its emphasis on homemade ingredients and quality, truly stands out from the rest. Don't feel like driving to Rino's and dealing with the parking hassle? Just go to Nappi where you will be just as satisfied and will walk out with a dazed grin on your face at having just experienced a slice of Italian food heaven, guaranteed."},{"name":"Croissanterie La Marseillaise","address":"1138 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Don't believe the sign about this being an authentic French bakery, the croissants are just average."},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"11B Allstate Rd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2","text":"The place is nice and cozy.

Only next time I will be arriving closer to 8:30, at the latest. Getting there any later is risking waiting in line and not getting any food.

It is not only the best brisket in the world, it is the best thing I've ever eaten - period. We didn't even bother to try any other meat or even any sides.  We bought two pounds of the fatty to eat there and another to take home.  Even heated up a day later chopped up on a store-bought bun, it is head and shoulders better than any other brisket around.

To my surprise, there was no line, and neither the dining room nor bar were full. We took a couple of seats at the end of the bar. There was some food gunk on the bar from the previous customer to sit here, and the bartender made no effort to clean it, even though I wiped away some food scraps from the armrest part of the bar while they watched. So I proceeded to clean the rest of the bar in front of me too. This was the only notch I'd knock points off of for the visit. Everything else went a-ok. The bartender was otherwise friendly, attentive, yadda yadda. \\n\\nWe ordered some Alex style tator tatchos, which came out rapidly fast. They could have used a tad more cheese, but otherwise just what you'd expect from the og location. I perused the menu looking for differences between the two locations. One thing I noticed was the Westgate Stagger, a Burger Beer and a shot of Old Crow for $4. This is the brother to the Greyhound special at the 4th St. location. Additionally, there was a Westgate dog and some drinks I didn't recognize that I think were probably exclusive to the new spot. Also, some dogs you might remember or want from the downtown store are missing from the menu. They intend to eventually add some Westgate exclusives here, once they determine what the people want. We ordered some dogs to boot, just old favorites for me, and they came out fast as well and were on point taste-wise. \\n\\nNow for the ambiance/decor. First of all, one of my favorite things about Lessner's efforts is that she opens up shop in neighborhoods that could use a good lift. This is no exception. In fact, it might be the best location she's chosen since the original Dirty Frank's opened in terms of pushing the boundaries. This is not without it's inherent drawbacks. An intoxicated, bothersome townie tried to snatch my lady friend's iPhone off the bar next to her. He then interrupted our meal several times to make slurry, unwanted small talk. \\n\\nWhen he and two less-disruptive townies left, the bartender asked \\"did he leave?\\" We replied that yes, he had. The barkeep said \\"thank god; future banned person right there.\\" We chuckled. I had been thinking the same thing, having watched any number of wandering drunks get thrown out of the 4th and Main shop. After I informed them of the phone incident, it was clear the guy would not be welcome back. Now, while that might sound bad, and it certainly would have been worse had he successfully snagged the phone, this just comes with the territory and I'll take it over this place opening somewhere like Grandview or even Franklinton, which I heard rumors would house this location before details emerged.\\n\\nOn to the intended ambiance. The bar is very 70s/early 80s feeling. I imagine it was original to the location. It looks well maintained nonetheless and I enjoyed it. Despite a much larger dining area, there is much less art adorning the walls, although it is of the same vein. Speaking of that large dining area, there is a wall dividing the bar and some bar tables from a bigger main dining area. It has these cutouts that totally remind me of a Mexican restaurant. Wondered if the location housed one at some point. \\n\\nA few more things: \\n\\n- Unlike downtown, there is also free guest wi-fi, although it kept disabling on me and wouldn't work. \\n- Has at least two TVs, more than downtown.\\n- Tons of adjacent parking in vacant lot. \\n- Currently only open 5-11, but will eventually be open for lunch and until midnight S-Th and 1am Fr/Sat\\n\\nAh, one final detail....there is no sign out front! I wonder if one is coming, but currently there is just a nondescript metal door that you open and see a sign that says \\"hotdogs\\" with a picture of a hotdog. There are handwritten pieces of paper that say \\"Enter.\\" I imagine there will be upgrades here. For now, it's kinda cool. Overall, a fine experience and I'll remind readers that three is a perfectly fine rating. Actually, I may go ahead and give it a four just based on location. I have no doubt that the two vacant storefronts next door will feature bars, restaurants or shops of some kind within three years thanks to Ms. Lessner. And for that, I thank her.

I'd purchased a house on Josephine St. I went a few times and it was not bad. Once I stopped by for 1/2# (8 ounces) of brisket to take home. I asked for 'tip end' which any BBQ place should know is the leanest part of the brisket. The woman asked if it should be moist and I replied yes. Once home, I opened the container and was SHOCKED to see a mound of fat. There was maybe one bite of meat. Thought of throwing it out but threw it in my refrigerator. A day or two later, I was walking my dogs past the place before they opened and mentioned the incident to one of the employees working the pit. They asked me to bring the container back as they wanted to see it. I returned quickly with the little white container and they weighed it.... 7 ounces of PURE FAT. Their other meats may be alright but stay away from the beef brisket - it in no way represents Texas BBQ.

Niiice! Once we walked into the nearly empty restaurant we were informed all the tables were booked but could sit at the bar.¬† The manager explained it's Admin Day and a lot of the businesses in the area reserved seats. We were fine sitting at the bar and got to enjoy watching the bartender and chef. \\n\\nAbout 10 minutes after we walked in Boris Kodjoe (yes, the good-looking actor) walks in! It was hard for me to focus for a minute. Lol. He and Irv sat at the bar next to us until they were brought to a table. Based on the conversation I observed I can almost guarantee they didn't have reservations either but I guess that's the perk of being a celeb. Not fair game but all good as we were there to eat not stare at celebs. \\n\\nTo drink, I went with the peach Bellini. For my meal I had the fried chicken with collard greens and mashed potatoes. Our waitress disappeared so the bartender took over. Appetizer cornbread and muffins were beyond yummy that we asked for extra cornbread. It's infused with corn kernels and contained the right amount of sweetness.¬† \\n\\nAfter about 40 minutes, some of the seats were still empty but I guess that's just their rule on maintaining reserved seating.

I don't normally get the opportunity to indulge in desserts when I dine out, as I'm either way too full from pigging out on my main course (or three) and/or none of the dessert options really appeal to me, but the nanaimo bar custard called my name as soon as I saw it. Little known fact about me: I'm fairly picky about my desserts. \\n\\nIt was the perfect ending to an otherwise great meal.

My god, I will weep the day that I can no longer get my hands on this dessert.\\n\\nAnd it wasn't even like I hadn't eaten well! I had split the warm winter salad and the sablefish with my dining companion, both of which had been very well executed. The warm winter salad, in particular, was a welcome divergence from traditional (i.e. boring) salads offered elsewhere. The sablefish was cooked perfectly and was nicely completed by the spiced tomato broth. All of this washed down with two glasses of wine, how can you complain!\\n\\nService was impeccable. There was a bit of a delay in getting the sablefish dish, and we were reassured multiple times that it was on its way. My coworker, who I was dining with, had ordered another dessert to take home and they made sure that we were all finished eating before they fired it, so that it wouldn't sit around needlessly. Impressive attention to detail. Everyone we encountered was exceedingly pleasant and professional. \\n\\nI love the different \\"tiers\\" on the menu, and the diverse range of menu options offered. This is one place where I would actually want to go back to try different things, instead of sticking with the one tried and true option that I know will not disappoint.

The food is really good, but the staff always made it one of my favorite places to go.  This was in the time of John Nugent, Jason Cool, and Josh.\\n\\nThat being said, I hadn't stopped in for a while and a friend asked if I wanted to meet there for lunch and to play a game or two of pool. Of course I was game. I was definitely not game for what happened to us. \\n\\nWe walked back to the tables by the pool table and waited for a server to come by while we racked up a game of pool. \\n1) the pool table kept jamming up and took forever to get set up.  A manager came by to try to fix it and told us it was going to be that way because they don't have any WD40 nor would they open up the side to get the balls out (mind you the games are free!); \\n2) the server never came back to see us (15 minutes after walking in) so we went to the bar to get a menu; \\n3) a guy comes in with 2 small kids and sits at the table next to ours in the back so a server immediately comes over to them while we're waiting at the bar to get a menu;\\n4) the guy says he has a large group and they're going to need our table (WHAT?!) and the server says \\"Oh, these are reserved. Didn't anyone tell you?\\" SERIOUSLY?! We've been waiting for someone to acknowledge us, let alone tell us that our table is reserved. Couldn't you put a sign on them? Couldn't the manager have told us when she came back to fix the pool table?\\n5) Not wanting to sit next to multiple 2+ year olds, we moved to the bar. (Still haven't been asked if we wanted to order anything at this point or even apologize for having to move)\\n6) Sat at the bar and the bartender had absolutely NO personality. I guess I was expecting some kind of conversation based on my past experiences with the bartenders (that have since left), but she took our order, stood looking at us awkwardly and listened to our conversation - again, awkwardly. \\n7) I placed my order and it came out wrong, but I understand they can get busy at times and things get overlooked\\n\\nAll in all, my friend and I both agreed that it's not the fun place it used to be AT ALL. If I want a burger in the future, I'll go to the take out window and eat it at home. On the one plus side, they have a good beer list developing.

The restaurant is warm and chic with rustic touches, booths and fireplace seating seem very cozy. The menu looked fantastic but everything just tasted blandly heavy. I had the cassoulet with eggs and my companions had the brisket sandwich and the pork belly with polenta. The highlights were the fried items - both the potatos that came with the sandwich and the polenta were very nicely fried, crispy but not too heavy. The cassoulet was mostly a goopy dish without seasoning, when other places (like Cafe Medina) actually put flavours and depth into a similar dish. Brisket sandwich was mediocre, and my pork belly dish needed some kind of acidity for me to get through. There was supposedly corn salsa, but it just seemed like someone just opened some canned corn with no seasoning to the dish.\\n\\nI love greasy brunches, but there was absolutely no subtlety or complexity to any of the dishes and none of us ended up finishing our meals.

We check Yelp first, and the reviews seemed all over the map. So, we figured that judging good barbecue is a fickle pursuit, especially among Texans, and we decided to go anyway and decide for ourselves. \\n\\nLet's just say it was a mistake. The service was bordering on hostile, and the server seemed offended at the mere idea that you might have a question about something. Then they like to fill your cup to the brim with ice and make you wait half an hour for a refill. \\n\\nNow, I like the sauce they use here -- I even keep some at home -- and they do serve some nice, smokey ribs. But the portions are tiny and overpriced, the chicken was drier than the Sahara, and the sides were pathetic. In our party, everyone got different sides so we could try a wide array of things and hopefully avoid picking the one bad thing on the menu. Not-a-one was a hit or even decent. The greens were watery, the mashed sweet potatoes were crunchy in places (wtf!), the fries were bland, the mashed potatoes were unimpressive and the corn seemed to come right out of a can without even a half-hearted frill to save it. It wasn't hellish, but come on. You're in Texas. You don't have to take this!\\n\\nThe standing philosophy around my house is that the food here exists solely as an excuse to put Stubb's BBQ sauce all over everything you order. Again, it's not awful food, but you're MUCH better off buying the sauce and cooking up your own favorites. If you live here, you have a friend who can grill, whether you know it or not.

I've ordered sides here before, so I know they have some good options, but thats not what they choose for you. Pretty much all of the entrees aside from the fried chicken incur a \\"small up-charge\\" of $5-10 if ordered as part of the family style dinner. It's just a racket!

I finally made it here for dinner with a few friends and it was good stuff.  Two of us arrived a bit early for our reservation so we sidled up to the bar where we each ordered a Drunken Palmer from the very friendly server/bartender.  We chose the Drunken Palmers from a list of fancy cocktails which all sounded like they might just hit the spot on that lovely, warm, pollen-filled spring evening.  Since it was cocktail weather, I completely bypassed the wine list when I really should have taken a look to see what was on there, but I had tunnel vision once I noticed that refreshing libation consisting of Lemonade, Iced tea and a few liquors that sounded like they would pack a delicious and powerful punch (seriously, more than one of these and there would have been a Drunken Katie to go with it).\\n\\nWhen the rest of our party arrived, we were promptly seated on the patio (we had a choice of patio or inside) which, thankfully, was enclosed so as to avoid having a yellow coating of pollen on every available surface.  I love the interior and the layout of South City Kitchen - it reminds me of when I visit the home of my friend's very Southern family in South Georgia; the rooms all lead to other rooms and everything is kinda sprawled out, and there are always people eating and drinking everywhere.\\n\\nOur server approached and told us the specials of the day which sounded very good.  We did, however, all choose to order from the regular menu with the exception of the soup du jour, which I ordered.  It was a Calabasas squash soup which was spicy (spice not heat) and very flavorful.  I quite enjoyed it.  Other members of our party ordered the She-Crab Soup (which I heard was excellent) and the Caesar salad which had garlic-grit croutons and fried okra on it.  I was fortunate enough to be given an entire garlic-grit crouton to try and it was delicious.  I probably could have made a meal of just those.  We also received a basket of warm corn breads and biscuits with butter and they were excellent.  The biscuits were so light and buttery, and the corn bread had a wonderful flavor.\\n\\nThere were many items on the menu which appealed to me but I finally selected the Sauted Shrimp and Scallops with grits and garlic gravy for my entre.  It was very good.  I nearly cleaned my plate but had to throw in the towel at the end and leave behind about two bites of grits.  This was hard for me; I do love grits.  Two of my dining companions ordered the Fried Chicken, which they loved (and these are Southern folks, mind you).  They didn't let me try any of it (actually they might have if I had asked for it before it was all gobbled up).  My other friend ordered the Whole Fried Catfish, which was gigantic and came with hush puppies (yum!), cole slaw and some dipping sauces.  I tried the catfish and it was delicious - very tender and flaky, and fresh-tasting.\\n\\nI was so full that I couldn't get dessert although they looked excellent.  I will be sure to pace myself and save room next time because they have the kind of yummy Southern treats that I like - pecan pie, banana pudding, cobbler.\\n\\nOur service throughout our meal was excellent.

It's probably tied for taste versus some of the other places, but it edges out a win in terms of value/portion size (because I'm still not a baller, despite being out of college for a few years already).\\n\\nFirst of all, we all know BBQ is all about the meat, but the sides can't be an afterthought for a true BBQ experience! This place has amazing sides. You have all the classics, done classically well. No surprises, in a good way. Awesome collard greens, awesome beans, awesome mac and cheese, etc. etc. etc.\\n\\nThe sauce selection for your meats are the highlight. The sauces completely blows Red Bones' selection out of this world.

The basis of our comparison comes from living in both NY and Boston, were a good Italian restaurant is a fixture on nearly every block and the minimum level of competence for a restaurant to survive is quite high. We've been looking around here for several years.\\n\\nThe location is nicely appointed, with a muted ambiance that, with the right companion, could easily turn romantic. Our server was attentive and friendly, and was quite familiar with the menu - a rarity, I've found.\\n\\nWe started by sharing the calamari appetizer. Compared to other reviewers, we're not as ecstatic about it, but it was good. Be sure to mix in some of the \\"goop\\" (small tomatoes, small sliced pepperoncinis) with each bite; it's much better that way. \\n\\nNext time (and there definitely will be a next time) I'm going to skip the appetizer in favor of a salad, since - rarity of rarities! - their Caesar salad description proclaims that it actually (and correctly!) has white anchovies in it. I'm a fan and seldom find that anywhere. (I'm sure they would be willing to leave them out if you so choose.)\\n\\nWe each had pasta as a main course - I the fettucini vodka-something with sausage, my wife the bow-tie pasta with crumbled sausage and mushrooms. They had distinctly different flavors, and both were truly excellent. The sausage in particular is very mildly spiced and firm; it was wonderful. They make their own pasta daily, and it shows. Neither sauce was heavy, and both were delightful.\\n\\nUnusually, we split a canoli for dessert - still very good. The French press coffee - pressed at the table, of course, with one serving yielding two cups - could have been more coarsely ground; substantial grounds were present in the pour, making that the only thing they did wrong. Maybe it's better when not decaf.\\n\\nWell done. A very enjoyable meal. This was also a trip in which we discovered Louisville's downtown area, which has a very nice atmosphere with lots of interesting shops and restaurants.

Therefore I predict that RA Sushi Bar Restaurant will be out of business within a couple of years if not sooner.\\n\\nThis past Friday was my second visit to RA (why did we try again? Ugh!) and the second go was just as negative as the first. The quality of fish used for the sushi is terrible and thus very overpriced. Six pieces of nigiri was ordered and each fish, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail, was barely recognizable and if you don't recognize it how's it going to taste? Terrible. It may have been the worst sushi I've ever eaten. The appearance, taste, texture and flavor were totally off. Yuck!\\n\\nFor this visit we came specifically for Happy Hour, as we're always looking for a deal, and that was some stupid thinking on our part. The happy hour prices are no deals. $6.75 for a Jim Beam call is considered a deal in Austin? Two pieces of Tuna Nigiri with low quality trash fish for $5.29 is a deal? Hell no!\\n\\nThen we get to service which at RA is not surprisingly mediocre. The staff isn't friendly or welcoming. The bartender had no personality and made zero effort to earn her tips. It's a typical corporate restaurant, with corporate training and a corporate feel. The staff gives the impression that they don't want to be here and are therefore putting in the minimum level of effort. It's as if the customers are an inconvenience. But why would any quality server want to work at a corporate gig in Austin? Awesome bars and restaurants are a dime a dozen, so if you've got any hint of talent in the service industry, then you'll seek employment elsewhere. I think it's appropriate to say that RA is the \\"Sushi Applebee's\\" of downtown Austin.\\n\\nSo to conclude the story. After one order of food and drinks we looked at each other and without saying a word we knew what we needed to do. Immediately we paid that tab, got up out of our seats, dashed to the door, and got the hell out of RA, running away, while screaming from the distaste in our mouths, as fast as we could until we reached the door of their competitor on W 6th Street where we resumed our happy hour sushi extravaganza. „Åï„Çà„ÅÜ„Å™ÔøΩ?Say≈çnara RA!"},{"name":"Maraya At Sabrina's Restaurant","address":"8100 Crystal Clear Ln","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing amazing amazing !\\n\\nTry the Mohamara and the arak \\nTry the kebbe and the wara2 3inab........"},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm crying...because I know it'll be a long time before I have anything as delicious as this meal.

Sadly, I didn't know they only served it during brunch -_- STILL GOT THE CHICKEN THOUGH! \\n\\nIt was just the two of us, and my friend and I shared a fried battered buttermilk chicken entree, a beet salad, and the mac and cheese dish. We only ordered one entree because we were planning to eat more at another joint afterwards. BUT BOY DID WE STILL GET STUFFED.

Very light, crisp, and buttery in all the right places!\\n\\nBeet Salad- I was expecting a full blown comfort menu here, but was really happy they served organic and fresh greens too. The beet salad was great! Real refreshing, and def a good add to balance out your hearty meal :)\\n\\nMac and Cheese- This was highly raved by other yelpers, but I honestly thought it was just okay.. It was too rich for my taste. Wished I had gone for the jambalaya instead.\\n\\nAs for the other tidbits:\\n\\nAtmosphere- it was a really chill and lounge-y vibe. lol it was probably because the lighting was REALLY dim.

It definitely added to the flavor of the broth which on a consistency scale was perfect. It was not to waterey and not to thick.

I love love love their blackened chicken fingers - they are very spicy, with a nice marmalade dip to temper the spice - I order these every single time I'm there. I'm not even a big fan of spicy stuff, and my boyfriend can barely tolerate spicy stuff but he also loves these. Also great are their Crawfish Etouffee, Border Chili, and Catfish New Orleans. Definitely get their Strawberry Margarita. Everything is reasonably priced - I think everything on their menu is under $20, with a majority under $15. They have great service, great food, and a great lively atmosphere. Portions are huge. \\n\\nMy only complaint from my most recent visit is that they need to stop being so rigid with their menu. This is a new change on their part - they used to always be so accommodating. We used to like upgrading the meat in the enchiladas to the blackened chicken, and they were always so nice about it. I mean, we'd pay the full amount to use blackened chicken fingers instead. Now, they're telling us no substitutions can be made on any order. That's not fair. I would give them 5 stars if they changed that silly rule."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"So glad we made it here on our trip!

Many of their tapas-style dishes feature unique combinations that many in my party of 8 didn't seem to like. Among the favorites include the pork belly and beef cheek, which lives up to what is much raved about but otherwise, the food was a miss.\\n\\nI ordered the secret burger that came with a side of chips ($16). This is the only entree-sized dish on the menu and I was definitely full afterwards. Their burger is also extremely limited -- by 6:30 they were already gone. They were very generous with the chips but they are paper-thin. I always thought that chips would be better the thinner they are, but these were so thin that you could barely taste the potato flavor. They were really crunchy and crispy but once in the mouth they felt like they didn't hold enough substance. I ordered my burger medium rare and it was cooked properly, but the patty wasn't juicy at all. It was dry and unseasoned, really relying on the other components of the burger for flavor. The cheddar crisp they use instead of melted cheese provides an interesting crunch and texture but with the dry patty, it made the burger taste even drier. The sauces, pickles, and cucumbers on top were the only redeeming parts. Maybe it was an off day, but I am disappointed in the much raved about burger. \\n\\nThe service was average, but the server did help us reserve secret burgers while we waited for the rest of the party to arrive.

There are the standard BBQ sides you can order as well, of course - potato salad, fried okra, mashed potatoes, etc - they're all pretty good, too.

I decided on the chicken salad sandwich (lettuce and tomato on toasted white bread) and a side of their Yelp-recommended sweet potato fries.\\n\\nIt took about 10 minutes for our food. The bologna sandwich and were both hot. My chicken salad sandwich was AWESOME: instead of like most restaurants that sell chx salad sandwiches, where they plop a small 1/2 cup scoop of the mix on bread that is twice the size, this sandwich was nothing like the stereotype. A heaping serving of their sandwich mix filled the entire bread, and was at least half an inch thick!! Wonderful :) The white bread was fresh. Slightly toasted, it was chewing - just the way I like it. And the best part of the dish? The basket of hot sweet potato fries.

(Awesome show, you must see them.)  Arrived at 6:30 am on a Saturday and was the 10th person in line.  The man at the front was celebrating his 70th birthday.  The three enterprising kids behind him were being paid $50 apiece to hold spots for other customers.  Next was a group serving V8 and vodka, followed by some folks from San Marcos, Los Angeles and a group of UT students slamming breakfast beers until they passed out.  \\n\\nIt was quite a scene.  We got to know each other, traded BBQ stories, talked about politics, football...whatever was necessary to burn 4.5 hours.  Around 9 am, a Franklin employee took our order so they could estimate how much meat they'd have for the day; another came by selling cold beer.  The restrooms opened early too, which was terrific considering how much liquid was being consumed in the line.  They also sold T-shirts and other Franklin memorabilia.  Anticipation was high and everyone patted themselves on the back for being at the most talked about BBQ restaurant in Texas.\\n\\nThe doors opened at 11 am.  Aaron Franklin himself was standing by the cash register and I must admit I fan-boy'd a bit.  When it was my turn, I ordered brisket, sausage, beef ribs and turkey to go (should have place my order 1.5 months in advance, but who knew).  Brisket is what it's all about, so I was salivating to get my first taste.  I pulled back the brown paper wrapping and picked up a delicate slice.  It was lightly smoked with a thin dark bark on the outside.  It was so moist it fell apart in my hand...always a good sign.  I took a bite and then...\\n\\nNothing.  No trumpets.  No angels singing.  No fireworks. Thinking that I may have pulled off a dud slice, I took another bite, chewed it slowly and...\\n\\nNothing.  Not even a sparkler.\\n\\nWith a fake pageant smile, I wrapped up the huge pile of meat, put it in my bag, thanked the cashier and slowly walked to my car.  When others outside the restaurant asked how it was, I told them it was worth the wait.  What else do you say to someone who waited in a line for 4 hours to experience the pinnacle of BBQ?  \\n\\nI've had plenty of great BBQ...Pecan Lodge in Dallas changed my life, Kreuz Market meats are amazing.  The BBQ at Franklin is good but the hype machine is really doing its job.  Would I eat it again?  Sure, if someone else stood in line to get it.  But I'm sad to say it wasn't anything special.  Just OK.\\n\\nIf you're coming in from out of town and want a real Texas BBQ experience, go to Snow's in Lexington or Kreuz in Lockhart.  Or go to Franklin BBQ, experience the fun of standing in line for hours on end with some great people and pay $20 a lb for good brisket.

Each bowl has half an egg, one piece of pork, scallions and wood-ear mushrooms. The noodles are thin and chewy. They absorb the flavor of the broth really well and has the perfect consistency. The broth is savory and rich with just the right amount of fatty goodness. It is just a hint too salty, but that's just my preference. The egg is marinated nicely, and the yolk is melt-in-your-mouth good. The pork is soft and fatty, but I wish it's just a tad bit more flavorful. \\n\\nOverall, the ramen was delicious and I'm definitely coming back again. Ramen Tatsu-Ya has several \\"bombs\\" that you can add to your ramen. I love anything spicy, so I'll be checking out that spicy bomb in my next visit!\\n\\n\\nP.S.

Come Early - The cart opens at 11am and on this past trip I came at 9:30AM and waited for them to open.  We were the first ones there but minutes later another dude cruised on in and started the line.  We waited in the car a good 30-40 min and finally got out of the car to join the growing line.  By 10:30AM the modest little line began to stretch all the way down the block and curved down the residential street.  Come early, be cool, and don't piss off a long line of hungry, cranky, yet orderly people who decide they know how to wait in a line by cutting the queue.  That's just no bueno.\\n\\n2. Bring a book, a friend, and/or a smart phone.  All of the above are good time-killing fodder as you don't want to arrive right at 11:00 when they open lest you risk them selling out before you get to the front of the line.  \\n\\n3. Get the moist brisket.  The brisket here is a must.  Is it brined AND coffee-rubbed?  You can debate this during your long wait, but regardless it's a really tasty brisket and flavored perfectly all the way through.  Don't waste your time by getting the lean brisket - here or anywhere!  You'll do yourself a disservice by missing out on all that flavor on your dry, dry cut of meat.  The brisket is $13/lb and worth every penny.  The ribs are alsy very tasty at $11/lb.  They have a nice peppery crust and smooth smoke flavor.  The freaking Tipsy Texan is, too, a win.  Chopped brisket and sliced sausage piled HIGH on a sandwich bun.  You'll be drunk off the meat flavor for sure.\\n \\n4. Douse your food in the simply second-to-none Espresso Barbecue Sauce. I'd drink it if I could.\\n\\n5. Get a Topo Chico mineral water or a soda to go with your food.  You definitely need the carbonation to contrast with the rich pile of food you're stuffing in your face!\\n\\nGreat way to spend a Saturday lunch on a beautiful day.  They're set to open their brick-and-mortar shop next month so get here while you can still experience the line!  You'll get such a sense of accomplishment at how hard you had to work/stand for your delicious BBQ.  Definitely worth the wait, and the hype.  Best BBQ in town!"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

I had never gotten dessert there before because honestly it's not the cheapest place, but this dessert is worth it. It kind of threw me off guard because it's called cookies and cream or something like that which would make you think that it had Oreos, but it's really two chocolate chip cookies with some Mascarpone cheese in the middle.

Their  happy hour menu is what makes this place a gem. I honestly would not be able to afford the entrees here on a teacher salary, but if you come during happy hour it is affordable. One tip I left is that if you come for happy hour you should keep in mind that you have to sit at the bar.

I applaud creativity in the bar, but this is really sad.\\nThat being said, the food:\\n\\nWe had the rabbit loin endive salad. The loin was cooked to exacting perfection. Brava, but to be expected. The endive had bolted to the point of being 85% core. A seasonal prob, but should have been addressed in the kitchen. The currants and other touches on the plate created many possible flavor combos that delighted my palate repeatedly. The chevre was an astounding flavor addition.  I loved it. \\n\\nThe Brussels sprouts were equally interesting.  While I love aioli as much as the next gal, it was too heavily dressed. I would have appreciated a much lighter hand.  Even a tossing with a little beurre noisette instead would have been less rich.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the Quenelles suffered from the same fate.  The sauce was almost a bernaise, cloaking the interesting and creative dish in an overbearing sauce.

Could it be possible? A new locality for my brethren? I pondered this intriguing concept as I stroked the stubble on my chin with the left of my two hands. With a decision made by a flip of the smallest coin in my pocket, a dime, plans were set to dine there in half of a half-month.\\n\\n         Perhaps tangent to the review, yet inherently influenced by the final outcome of the afore mentioned review , I found myself thinking, to myself, admittedly hoping that someone could cast a guiding light on the conundrum that I now faced, where to begin the afore mention, afore mentioned review.\\n\\n        The condition of the road approximately three and a half blocks away from the restaurant, south-east of the panache antique store as the crow flies, was rather lack luster. I discovered this annoying, albeit minor inconvenience on my commute to the Omlettery in my Honda civic, model number 35607. Perhaps the more than arduous journey could be blamed on the suspension of my car; however, things only got worse as I entered what could only be described as labyrinth of a restaurant. Judging off the colour scheme of the exterior paint enveloping the Omlettery, it is clear that Paul either has a blatantly tawdry eye for juxtaposing colours or that the omelettes would be served on noxious, uncouth platters in as barbaric of a way as the servers could manage.\\n\\n     I spent 4 weeks of a month traveling through the most westerly point of eastern Europe on a pilgrimage, akin to that in one of Tolkien's fantasy novels, to sample the finest omelettes. One could argue that I am well versed in the finer techniques of the \\"Omelette\\" and the fine dining that is associated with it. This adventure is nothing compared to the gap year I took before attending Langara, man that was a fun year. I hooked up with at least one different girl and maybe a guy too ;) but ill leave it at that ;)\\n\\n    Naturally, being in an Omelettery, I ordered a beef omlette with extra beef. The cook had the audacity to cover my omelette with what looked like an entire steak, in what was clearly a plethora of haughtiness that stems from being the \\"head chef\\". I kindly explained to the waiter that I was under the presumption that my omelette would be served beef free with a copy of \\"Beef\\" on dvd, NOT an omelette that appeared to be covered with the vast majority of America's beef export. Still, this inconvenience was again minor, like the bumpy road. The last straw came when I asked for a water with half of a lemon slice. AND LOW AND BEHOLD, THE TRITE WAITER BRINGS OUT A WATER WITH 78/79ths OF A LEMON. I probably should've left after that third major flaw, but I had committed myself to the cause of omelette sampling and I really didn't want to drive back over that terrible road again, so with a monumental effort, I summoned my courage and decided to stay. \\n\\n       The omelette tasted amazing, but then again, its egg. Its really fricking hard to mess up an egg. You literally put it in a pan until it cooks. Based off of the other inconveniences that I faced before sampling the exquisite omelette, the so called, and probably self proclaimed \\"head chef\\" had probably tried to make the omelette taste terrible. Like his job depends on him meeting a daily dissatisfying quota. The dulcet tones of \\"BAAAH OOPS, I FORGOT TO BURN THE OMELETTE\\" could be heard throughout the restaurant as the cook realized that he accidentally made the omelette well, by accident. No doubt he would be giving the next customers omelette extra burns to meet his daily quota. Also, the toast was perfectly toasted, but I could have easily toasted a piece of toast myself. Toasting it at exactly 457 degrees for no less than 2 minutes and 37 seconds.\\n\\n       Egg free omelettes? nope. Parking spaces to accommodate 200+ cars? nope. A good steak? nope, unless you order the beef omelette that is because it was covered in enough beef to be considered a steak. If you're looking for those then turn 360 degrees and moonwalk out because you aren't finding them there.\\n\\n     I'll give it to them, the restaurant can make a decent omelette, but then again so can I. I don't get all the hype about a place that can presumably only cater to those of immoderately low mental intelligence because everyone who has an ounce of sense is making their own omelettes. The place is just overrated, what a joke. Its exaggerated, pumped up, over promoted, synonyms. It should have a rating congruent to the amount of hype it would properly have given the ideal circumstances to discern what amount of hype it would probably have in ideal circumstances. \\n\\n    In the final analysis: The prices are good, the atmosphere is nice, and probably maybe most of all, the \\"head chef\\" should be hailed as a maestro of the spatula for his impeccable omelette creations. To ultimately conclude this conclusion of the omelettery, lastly, as a final point, I would like to summarize Its great"},{"name":"Waffle House","address":"7809 E Ben White Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I don't know why people love this place.

This place has the traditional push carts, which my husband likes so he could see what's what. They use the traditional bamboo steamers instead of the stainless steel ones that many restaurants have transitioned to.  We ordered the usual ha gow shui mai.  Both were ok. The shui mai has lots of mushroom pieces, which was not my cup of tea. The skin for the ha gow isn't that great. It doesn't come apart cleanly when you bite into it. I was in the mood for porridge so I ordered the thousand year old egg porridge. It was decent.  Also ordered the beef rice noodle, which has the same stickiness as the ha gow skin.  We also had the egg rolls, which was also ok.  Maybe it was early so the same things came coming around. I wanted to finish off with egg tart but it was just not coming out so I ended up going to a bakery to get one.

I'll explain the 0.5 Star downgrade a little bit later in the review.\\n\\nBut damn this was place is mighty good. I came here with my sister and a close friend from college who was visiting Boston and he highly recommended this place since it's one of his favourites. We first ordered the Calamari, which was excellent, and it originally came with tartar sauce, but we requested cocktail sauce as well which the waitress kindly obliged. We also ordered the Duck appetizer which was amazing after I took one bite. The sauce was excellent and the meat was very tender and melted easily in my mouth plus the flavour of the meat had a nice char taste fresh off the grille, definitely a well done dish. \\n\\nThen I ordered the Lamb, while my sister ordered Salmon and my friend ordered Beef Guinness short ribs which was extremely soft and tender. It almost tasted like filet-mignon it was sooo good.  So I thought that was the best dish of the night and too bad it wasn't mine. My lamb was very tasty and the tomato tasting sauce was a very good compliment to the meat although the mash potatoes was a bit bland. The mash potatoes on my sister's Salmon was a lot better as it tasted a bit herb-ish and it went well with the fish. Overall, the dishes were fantastic and definitely worth the high price tag. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was pretty good as well, as we sat right in the middle of the dinning area and facing the large and crowded bar. The waitress was very easy on the eyes and provided a fast and friendly service. Although from time to time, she would interrupt our conversation to ask if she can take away our dishes which was kinda annoying. And the downgrade of 0.5 Star is based on this, and also the tall/blond Hostess was totally snobbish cause she thought she was a 10(which is true btw) and didn't say hi to me first when we first got there. She also on purposely made us wait at the front for like 5 seconds longer than necessary. I only realized this after it had happened. Very snobbish indeed!!\\n\\nSo I would definitely recommend this place as the food was awesome if your wallet can afford it.

I have not yet been to dinner here yet. The main difference seems to be that at lunch, you basically only have one option, the Ol'Skool Shoyu Ramen that is uses a soy chicken broth. OK, so I'll give you the obligatory \\"I've been to Japan and eaten the best\\" line as many other reviewers here. But I really have spent a lot of time in Japan, in a variety of different cities. I've had quite a few different types of ramen in different regions of Japan. And I love food. And I love ramen. So obviously I was seeking out the best ramen spots I could find. I've had some amazing bowls that blew my mind...broth that is just oozing with flavor, with bone marrow just floating in a thick soupy broth with pork that just melts in your mouth without even chewing it. But I digress.\\n\\nLiving in Austin for the past 5 years, I've craved this type of authentic ramen. When this place started getting good reviews and Austin was a buzz about how good the ramen was here, I was very excited. I wanted to check it out, but it's kind of far for me and I have many munchkins running around. So, it took me a while to get out there. But I did finally. And I wasn't too impressed.\\n\\nThe Ol' Skool Shoyu Ramen is salty, oily, and too watery. Good broth should not be so overwhelmingly oily with pools of oil floating all over the top. I also think that soy sauce should be a complimentary flavor because it is so good at melding itself with the other ingredients. Not so with this broth, the soy sauce flavor was a little too prominent for my taste.  A little too much fishiness in the broth for me also. The egg was delicious, the yolk was divine. Noodles were cooked very well. I got the spicy bomb thing, which was kind of a waste of money. They should just give you some chili sauce or hot sauce, not charge you for a \\"spicy bomb\\" or whatever. Also, I thought they should have small little pickled side dishes that you can eat with your ramen, but all they had was pickled ginger...this is not a sushi joint.\\n\\nI must caveat this review again with the fact that it was only for the shoyu ramen, which was the only option available for lunch. I'm looking at the pictures for the dinner tonkatsu ramen. Perhaps that one will be better....but with the poor performance during lunch, it's probably going to take me some time to convince myself to get out there again."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow.

Most wine is between $8 to $12 a glass.\\n\\nOther: South City Kitchen is on two floors of an old house and the stairs are steep. As such, you should request a table on the first floor if someone in your party may have difficulty traversing stairs.

The music was good, it was a Christmas song playlist in Spanish (or maybe Portuguese, I'm sorry I took French as a student). \\n\\nI got Sangria Margarita, which was delicious. It didn't taste very strong, but from how talkative I was by the end of the meal, I could tell that it had good amount of alcohol in it. \\n\\nFor food, two of us shared a tapas sampler platter (they were out of eggplant, but we got to substitute it for another bacon wrapped date and almond. Score!). It was fun tasting a little bit of everything (but the corn; do not attempt to cut the kernels with utensils, the whole thing may end up on the floor). Then we followed it up with smoked pork belly taco and fish taco, which were also delicious and well balanced in flavor. Finally, we finished the meal with the nachos. It was the best nachos I've ever had. The chips were perfectly crispy and the chips to toppings ratio was great. This was so much food, but the prices for everything was reasonable. \\n\\nOverall, this place is definitely worth checking out.

Soft and tasty with a nice crunchy crust.  Then I started tearing off pieces of tortilla and taking bites of chicken.  This approach made the chicken taste dry, but after hours of hot and sweaty dancing, I was inhaling it.  Then I got about halfway into the cone, and surprise!  A pool of coleslaw.  I took it like a shot.\\nThe second time, I was prepared.  I just trashed the cone and ate the thing like a taco.  It was pure joy.

Clearly everyone else had the same idea - this place was PACKED. Joined some friends who live across the street and have been highly anticipating this new restaurant opening from Chef Jason Santos. They had been regulars at the past establishment - Bar Lola. We were all pretty impressed with the experience, although there were definitely some kinks to work out - but it's clear they were aware, and it was first week problems. The biggest frustration was that the drinks took way too long. I felt bad for them because there was only 2 people behind the bar making drinks for the entire restaurant - thats the bar, the lounge area, and 2 dining rooms. It was a lot of people. They got really behind with all the mixed drinks people were ordering from their menu and of course they wanted to maintain the integrity of the drinks - I could see they were taking care with each pour - but unfortunately, it really impacted the speed. I saw the bartenders yelled at by patrons so it seemed very stressful. On the other hand, our server (ugh - so sorry to forget her name!) was such a joy. We sat at the bar but she was still serving us. She was so pleasant, even though she was crazy busy. The food came out and it was excellent! The fried pickles and guacamole was great, it seemed like the deviled egg toast was a hit, but my personal two favorites were the fried chicken sliders (so moist!) and the short rub croquettes sent to us on the house (i will dream of these). It has a really fun atmosphere. Apparently Bar Lola was a bit gothic and dark - but Buttermilk & Bourbon used it to their advantage in all the right ways. The set-up is awesome. Looking forward to coming back, especially for the patio, if I can get in because I can only imagine that this will be a hot spot if they can keep the food and service so great!"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"i really wanted to like franklin, and i thought i would. after all, there can't be so many people waiting for something day after day without it being extraordinary right? well, i fell victim to overhype and was a bit dissapointed. i love supporting local businesses, but I feel Austin has a problem with loving them too much. Places like Hut's, Kerbey Lane, etc are okay but not as great as everyone says they are.\\ni had success ordering on my second attempt (on my first attempt i got there a little after 11 and they were sold out). getting there a little bit after 10:40, there was easily between 150 to 200 people on line. i waited almost 3 hours before i finally got my order. between the heat and the boredom, it was awful. however, the lady behind me said it was totally worth it so i took her word. when i finally gave my order, i was told they were out of ribs, pulled pork, and most their pies. seriously? i mean, the first visit they had someone come out and tell us when they were out but not this time. nonetheless, at least they still had brisket and turkey so i took my orders and left. when we finally ate, it was a bit dissapointing. everyone thought the brisket and turkey were pretty good but no one raved about it. tender and smoky but a bit dry. sausage was mediocre but i think it's their least popular item. the sauces were ok. i'm glad they have a variety but none stood out (the famous espresso one wasn't good but wasn't bad...we didn't think it complemented the meats). salt lick's sauce is still my favorite bbq sauce. the sides were the least favorite. my friend didn't like his beans, the potato salad tasted store bought, and the cole slaw was watery and tasted much more like sauerkraut than cole slaw. \\nthe best part of franklin is their fountain drink selection. dublin dr.pepper, maine root beer, blueberry soda, etc. awesome! i don't know anywhere else that have those on fountain. without the drinks i would have given franklin two stars. i heard someone took drink orders when you wait on line but not this time.\\nimo, salt lick has franklin beat because of several points: better sauce, better sides, better bread, and most importantly, not a ridiculously long wait and open longer. if/when they open the second pit and it's not so hot out, i may try franklin again, especially since the pulled pork sandwich looks great"},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm late to the Ramen thing and Tatsu-Ya on Research Blvd., was my first time at a Ramen House.

We were visiting Austin Texas and told, \\"You'll never get in at Franklins, maybe you should try somewhere else\\" Well, it was a rainy Wednesday around 1:00 pm and my wife and I decided to give it a try. When we got there, we knew that we were at an authentic Texas BBQ establishment. It had the look, the feel and the ambiance of what anyone would think to be a true Texas BBQ joint. Much to our surprise the line was not too long. We got into a line that was probably 30 feet from getting into the door. We were told it would be about an hour wait and that there is no guarantee that there will be any food left before we got to the counter. Luckily we made it to the counter. We ordered 1/2 pound of Brisket, a 1/2 pound of Ribs, 1/4 pound of pulled pork and a side of potato salad. They put the meat on butcher paper and a food trey. Nothing fancy. We sat down to eat and we were not disappointed. The Brisket was the best I have ever had. The ribs were tinder and had a great flavor. The pulled pork was solid if not spectacular. I noticed the sauces, that were on the table, were good but not overbearing. The meat was clearly the star of this show. I actually preferred to eat the meat without the sauce because it was so good on its on. Franklins is as advertised. Long wait, great BBQ!

Red Lobster is a big national chain, and this is one of their older locations (though recently remodeled). There are reasons people make jokes about Red Lobster and its cousin, Olive Garden.\\n\\nThe restaurant layout is odd -- a few tables in the bar in front, men's and women's restrooms in different locations, and dining rooms scattered about to break up the space. This meant the service staff would be gone for long stretches just trying to get from the kitchen and back again.\\n\\nWith all the advertising about their new wood grills, we opted into grilled food. I can't imagine how, but both my partner's steak and my salmon were as bland as one could imagine and still vaguely resemble steak and salmon. Aside from the famed cheddar biscuits, everything we had was unimaginative and, well ... safe. Clearly designed to appeal to the broadest audience, they ended up with nearly flavorless dishes.\\n\\nI had thought to order the special -- a peppercorn-rubbed salmon with a soy-wasabi glaze.

She should have given up those seats to people who were trying to find places to sit after ordering! My friends and I had to sit at the bar which isn't too bad but those stools are so high and I am so short that I nearly fell over trying to get off them.  A suggestion my friend and I left was to add hooks onto the bar so that we could hang our purses there.  I was carrying a huge bag and I was left holding it while eating, which wasn't so bad but I was dying of sweat and holding a purse while eating hot, hot ramen inside wasn't all that comfortable and easy.\\n\\nI believe they've tried to change that so it's only after you order, do you get to find seats otherwise they won't take your order since you'd be SOL for a seat. I brought a party of 6 to Ramen Tatsu-ya at around 8pm and they did a pretty good job about keeping the line moving.  We got inside after about 30 minutes and then ordered and sat down after another 15.  This isn't a place where you eat and lollygag for 1-2hrs after you're done eating.

The cheese didn't seem overly processed like melted velveta and had a really great cheddar, spiciness flavor. i think there must have been diced green chiles in it too. Maybe it was saut√©ed poblanos? Anyways, it was delicious. Definitely some of the better queso I've had since being in Austin. \\n\\nI notice a salsa bar, which is a nice touch, and we try them out. We really liked the medium and added it to the queso. The habanero sauce was not as hot as the spicy green sauce and seemed like it was nothing but pureed & strained pepper with vinegar. I didn't think the taste was good but we did like the spicy as it was deceptively the hottest sauce out of the trio.\\n\\nWhen the tacos came, I was disappointed at how small mine were.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I find barbecue to be a hard thing to critique because it is so incredibly subjective. Methods vary by region. Heck, they vary by county. And, I am not the biggest barbecue enthusiast (unless you count Korean). I do, however, get the occasional craving to sink my teeth into a pulled pork sandwich or some tender ribs every once in a while. When I do go to a barbecue joint, I judge them on the following criteria (I am sure you have your own): the sauce, tenderness of meat, level of smokiness (too much can be a bad thing), and sides.\\n\\nWhen I first went to Fox Brothers BBQ, it was a couple of years back while they were selling their food out of Smith's Olde Bar. Atlanta foodies were rabid for the stuff and I quickly found out why. It was solid and much better than most places I had tried in Atlanta. The news that the brothers had secured their own restaurant space buzzed around the internet and barbecue junkies anxiously waited for the place to open. When the doors did open at the end of the summer, people rushed over and were absolutely evangelical about the food.\\n\\nBeing the curious sort, I went the first week and ordered the pork and brisket with a side of collards and mac. Also got the fried pickles. The meats were very moist and tender. Collards were well-balanced. The macaroni and cheese was made with large shells and the creamy sauce was a great compliment to the tangy barbecue sauce. The fried pickles were incredibly crispy and the breading was fresh. They were a bit on the salty side, but the ranch dipping sauce gave it enough tang to mask the salt.\\n\\nI got the ribs and chicken with green beans and baked beans on my second visit. Ribs were very, very dry. They also had a bit of an off-putting flavor to them--reminded me of sulfur. I have heard the ribs are amazing, so maybe I just caught them on an off day? Worth trying again based on everyone's praise. Chicken was very, very good. Green beans had no salt and I barely touched them after one bite. Baked beans were smoky, sweet, and just right. Also got some more fried pickles which were a bit too salty this time. They need to adjust the batter. Had the banana bread pudding as well and it tasted homemade--pecan pie is supposed to be good too.\\n\\nMy next visit was for the pork plate with a side of mac and brunswick stew. My friend got the brisket with collards and mac. The flavor of my pork was very good, but it was kind of dry and way too chewy in places. It was fine after I hit it with some of that tasty barbecue sauce. My brunswick stew was the best I have had in a long while. Vinegary, slightly sweet, and full of vegetables and smoky shreds of meat. Mac was solid as usual. Date felt his brisket was too chewy and needed a bit more of cooking time--I agreed. He also said his collards were way salty.\\n\\nVerdict: Despite a few inconsistencies, I would definitely say the place has its strong points and is a welcome addition to the intown scene. Great sauce, well-prepared meats, and a good assortment of solid sides. They also have a couple of homemade desserts if you still have room after one of their massive plates. I really like the atmosphere the guys have created. It is very welcoming and someone always thanks me for coming when I head out the door--nice touch."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Best and most favorite meal of trip to Portland.

I really liked the sausage-some of the best I've eaten. The ribs were amazing too-fell right off the bone. Brisket was melt in your mouth but I definitely preferred the fattier pieces over the lean pieces. What would make this place better is better sides. I was not really a fan of the slaw or potato salad.

I did not, because it had killed my appetite and made me think the kitchen was dirty. \\n\\nI expected the manager to come over and apologize and offer something free, or at least to take it off the bill, but that didn't happen. So when we got the check, I noticed that my $11 salad (with the spider) had been discounted by 50% to $5.50. I couldn't believe that so I asked the waitress about it. She said that tuna is expensive and I ate about 1/2 of it. I just thought that was so ridiculous and asked to speak with the manager. The manager also said that I had eaten about 1/2 my salad so they charged me for 1/2 of it. I've never heard of such a system to discount in-edible food by the percentage that the customer had eaten. I didn't get any apologies either. I felt like the management thought I put the spider in my own salad. After I challenged the manager about that, he did take the whole price of the salad off our bill, but offered no other discounts. Also, they charged us for 7 beers and we only had 6 so we had to call the waitress back again to take that extra beer off our tab.

I was kind of surprised at the simplicity of the menu - it made making a choice easy though. I opted to go with the traditional ramen (\\"Ol' Skool\\") with a spicy bomb.\\n\\nIt's a really tiny location, so there are limited seats, but they have a pretty good system of making sure they don't let in anyone that won't be able to fit or sit down somewhere. Makes sense, and I kind of like how it makes this place feel intimate and \\"dive\\"y.\\n\\nOnce our food came out (surprisingly fast), I made the mistake of not trying the broth by itself before adding the bomb. I mixed it in and tasted the broth, and my first reaction/thought was \\"wow, salt\\". Is that typical? It seemed kind of oily and just not very flavorful. The noodles, seaweed, and pork belly were all pretty delicious, but the broth just wasn't impressive. Again, I'm not sure if it's because it was so hyped up from all the glowing reviews here (and from friends!), but I was really hoping for more. Especially with the higher price point.\\n\\nWill I be back? Probably, but I would like to try some of the other ramen bars here in Austin first.

She told me I MUST get to Fat Matt's Rib Shack.  That was on a Tuesday, and I spent the rest of my week anticipating what this \\"Fat Matt's\\" place was all about.  We finally get there on a Saturday morning around noon and it was already pretty crowded, though not as packed as it normally gets from what I hear.  I would describe the food at Fat Matt's as down home, backyard BBQ; even down to the menu.  It's pretty basic, which is good! For a person like me, I LOVE variety, but I get paralyzed by the options if I go in too hungry.  Your choice of meat at Fat Matt's is chicken or ribs...which in hindsight makes sense for a place named Fat Matt's Rib Shack.  I guess they're actually being generous by giving you a chicken option too.  \\n\\nNow every lover of the 'Q' knows that people get very particular about their sauce.  It is a very subjective thing.  While I typically enjoy the brown sugar flavor of a good KC-style sauce myself, Fat Matt's has a nice sauce that is chunky with onions and spices and it has a slightly sweet, more tangy flavor.  What I liked best about the sauce was that you could tell that they make this sauce in house.  I got the chicken & rib combo.  The meat had that nice charcoal cooked flavor and the ribs were fall off the bone tender.  You couldn't even tell where the grizzle ended and the meat began at some points.  They also have baked beans in a rum-based sauce which I found pretty enjoyable.  Lastly is their fresh lemonade.  If you like your lemonade on the sweeter side, this is the move.

The Groupon was for an appetizer and two entrees for $22. The appetizer is a simple and tasty dish of endless crispy tortilla chips with salsa, guacamole, and a cheese sauce. Very satisfying and great textures.\\n\\nI had the Camar√≥nes Alambres, which is shrimp skewered on sugar cane over a sweet cake with fried plantains. Over the moon delicious! The next time I had the Salmon del Diablo, which is salmon over mashed potatoes, and it was also very good. I did prefer the shrimp over the salmon. Being a native new-Englander, I am used to having seafood straight from the dock to the table, however Georgia is land-locked, and its hard and very expensive to get fish that fresh. But this was still a very good dish.\\n\\nThe waitstaff is numerous, well-dressed, well-spoken, efficient, and excellent at what they do. They know the dishes, are very fast with service, and I've never spent any time waiting for a drink, dish, or the check.\\n\\nIn addition, they have a bakery cafe, and a fabulous art store and pottery store on site and part of the entire experience. Get there early enough to poke around the art store for a good hour --- it encompasses two floors and has beautiful custom art works, from furniture to jewelry, to accessories and clothing items.

Yebo Beach Haus is located at the corner of East Andrews and West Paces Ferry across the street from Regions Bank.  The decor rotates from a beach house theme in the warmer months to a ski lodge theme in the winter months.  Yebo Beach Haus is very capable of accommodating small groups and large parties.  On weeknights, the parking is valet.  Service for a large group is excellent.  We were given clean plates in between courses.  They're also great at accommodating birthday desserts and group photo requests.\\n\\nOn the Menu: The majority of Yebo's menu consists of small plates.   Cold/raw small plates include papaya salad, oysters, and coconut ceviche. Vegetable small plates include red bean hummus, grilled corn with a traditional South African peri-peri seasoning, and grilled artichoke.  Seafood small plates consist of mussels, fried grouper sliders, prawn tacos, crab claw, and scallops.  Finally, there are meat small plates with sausage, ground beef, oxtail, or ostrich.  For large groups, there is a large sharable paella and a large sharable kebab plate.  Small snacks include fries, a cheese board, and beef jerky.  As you can see Yebo is a restaurant intended for sharing, but if you prefer something individual there are also four entree plates (salmon, tuna bowl, lamb, or ribeye) to choose from.\\n\\nWhat I Tried:\\nBiltong ($11) - Biltong is South African beef jerky.  It's not as tough as American beef jerky and is neither very sweet nor smoky.   While there wasn't a lot of flavor, I did appreciate the tenderness of the beef jerky in comparison to the large trail packs you buy at the supermarket for hiking.  Probably best as a small appetizer for a large group, because I wouldn't make a meal out of it.\\n\\nRoasted Cauliflower ($7) - This cauliflower is served in a curry butter with toasted almonds.  Advice for eating - take a piece of cauliflower and make sure to get an extra scoop of sauce to put on top.  With sauce, this vegetable dish is pretty good.\\n\\nBobotie Bunny Chow ($14) - Contrary to the name, no bunny (as far I could tell) was harmed to make these two little sandwiches.  It's a ground beef curry served in the middle of a small brioche bun topped with a sunny side up egg.  If you take a small bite as served you'll make a mess. For my second sandwich I flipped the egg over so the yolk would break and seep into the beef.  The curry flavor itself is nuanced but the meat and bread were both sweet.  Very tasty small plate, but the sandwiches are small.  I thought that we should have gotten 3 or 4 sandwiches for $14.   \\n\\nSeafood Paella ($50) - With several small plates already under my group's belt, one paella could satisfy 6 people.   Pros of this dish are the giant prawns and giant tender pieces of octopus.  Less impressive were the chorizo (okay but not as delicious at other places) and the much smaller calamari pieces.  The rice soaked up the juices from all of the other items and was very well seasoned. \\n\\nVerdict: Despite the size of the individual sandwiches I highly recommend the Bobotie Bunny Chow.  The paella and the roasted cauliflower were both good. You should plan on spending $30-40 for a decent sized meal.  Rating is based on food pricing - tasty, but I'd expect more from a 5 star restaurant at this price point.

Nothing as good as was reviewed here!  \\nThen there was a very long gap between that and the entrees.  Four of us had the special which was mussels and prawns in a spicy tomato sauce and one had a curry pasta dish and the other person had a different pasta dish.  The special was beyond flavorless and bland; not spicy at all.  As a matter of fact, everything needed salt!!!!  Never mind slightly cold! My sister had to get up to chase down a server for glasses of water for us!!!  \\nI ate the prawns and the few mussels that were there but left the cold, bland spaghetti.

It was almost well done with absolutely no juiciness to it at all.  The lobster tail was even a bigger joke.  About 2 inches long.  No flavor at all.  Over cooked.  Like chewing shoe leather. The drawn butter had been sitting around so long it has already started to get hard.  Baked potato looked like it had been cooked the day before and reheated in a microwave.

We get to the counter, ordered a carafe of cold house sake, a katsu slider, the #2 and the #4 ramen, and a spicy bomb on the side- all per recommendation.

I'm not a professional about ramen, but I am a professional on delicious and holy crap it tasted PERFECT! The broth was full of flavor, the pork was tender and rich, and the boiled egg literally melted in my mouth. The katsu slider was so juicy and flavorful, and the bun was perfectly toasted. My boyfriends ramen (#4) was the perfect amount of spice to enjoy without it being to hot, while still maintaining the flavor. \\n\\nOur experience was by far above and beyond what we could have expected, especially on our first night out in Austin.

Well, I'm going to say it's the MOST tender in America. I'm not willing to concede \\"Best\\" yet, though, because that would feel like a betrayal to some of my Houston joints, but it's definitively the best in Central Texas and probably the rest of America.\\n\\nSo, yeah, go get you some. Stand in line, be patient, and order a mix of lean and fatty brisket, the ribs, the sausage, sides, dessert, and whatever else they try to sell you. That's what I did and I didn't regret it."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The food quantity is definitely a five star, while the flavor is only a three star.

It's the best ramen I've found it Austin. \\n\\n2. Their maranated eggs are awesome! \\n\\n3. The gyoza is very good, but more than I, personally, almost ever am willing to pay for it. All of the other sides I've had have been good too. \\n\\n4. The staff is usually very friendly.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. The biggest con is that their space is TINY so you will almost always have to wait in line outside for a little while. Even sometimes while many tables are sitting empty inside. I don't quite understand this part of their system. It's definitely worth a 15-20 min wait, though. I'd estimate their seating rate is around 1 person per 1-1.5 min.\\n\\n2. The ramen is extremely salty. The original especially and it's really thick and fatty too. The top layer will actually start to solidify if it sits for a few minutes. It's great w/ the noodles, but will actually upset my stomach if I sip any of the extra up after the solid contents are gone. It would still taste great w/ less salt in my opinion. People who don't like salty food may not be able to eat this. EDIT: It seems less salty since late 2015.\\n\\n3. No take-out, no substitutions. They're a little snooty, as is traditional, about their ramen being eaten fresh and as the exact work of art the chef sent it out of the kitchen being. Sucks if you went out to lunch and told your sick wife you'd bring her home some soup, though. You can't sub things, but they do have options you can add to your bowl.\\n\\n4. They try to get rid of you. The music is pretty ridiculously loud, I'm guessing, to make it an uncomfortable environment and keep the tables turning over. I get it, but it's pretty annoying cause you can barely hear the person across the 2 ft table from you. I was also with a small group once and we were chatting after most of us had finished...a couple were still picking at some edamame...and the bus-people (they're not exactly servers) came by and asked if we needed anything else about 3 times in 4 minutes. The next time one just came and took all our unfinished cups out from in front of us and walked away.\\n\\n5. No fountain drinks. I hate places that serve canned/bottled beverages, for the exact same, already outrageous price as other restaurants serve them with free refills. But given how salty the ramen is, I'm ok with water anyway. I fill up two of their little tumbler glasses from the start.\\n\\n6. Strange hours - Currently open for lunch and dinner, but not in between. Make sure they're open before you go.\\n\\n7. Veggie ramen is only on Sunday nights!

The beet salad was as good as any other beet salad I've had, and my dad said that the escargot was as good as it gets without it being in a shell.\\n\\nFor my main course I had the bouillabaisse. This was a really adventurous order for me since I usually stick to chicken or mussels when I'm eating French food. However, I'm glad I ordered it! The portion size was generous without being too large, all the seafood tasted really fresh, and the broth had excellent flavour without being too salty or fishy. My dad ordered the duck confit cassoulet and he said it was really good  but not excellent. I don't eat duck, but all the white beans (I think cannellini) surrounding the duck looked excellent. \\n\\nAll of this food accompanied by an $80 bottle of red wine came to a total of $200 (with tip).

I live out-of-state but wished to purchase a gift card from Mettle to be sent to a relative in Austin for an anniversary.  On June 7, I called Mettle and spoke to a man identifying himself as the manager, gave him my credit card # for a $250 gift card, and he promised to mail the card the next day to my relative, and email me a receipt.  When I heard nothing for several days, I called the restaurant again.  The person who answered said the manager was unavailable but assured me she could find out when the transaction would occur and call me back.  I heard nothing for several days.  I called again on June 18, spoke to yet another person who told me she was aware of the issue and was \\"baffled\\" as to why no action had been taken regarding the gift card.  She promised to find out and call me back that same day.  No call came.  I called again on June 19 and asked for the person I'd spoken to the day before, was told she was out that day, but this person asked if she could help.  When I related the facts of the situation, she said she knew about it and could not understand why the transaction had not occured.  She said she wanted to inform the owner (who would be coming in for lunch that day) and would give the owner my number so I could relay the story directly.  No phone call came.  One last time I gave it a try...  On June 20, I called and asked for the manager.  They asked for my name, put me on hold, came back and said he was not available.  For the fifth time, I left my contact information, but my call was not returned.  I find it astounding that I practically begged them to take my money - but it didn't happen.  And they wouldn't return a single phone call.  How to make sense of something that makes no sense?  The anniversary came and went while I tried to resolve this.  I had to order a replacement credit card (Mettle still had my information) in case they decide at some point to run it.

Once we get there, we are told about the hour wait and we were not deterred despite the cold.\\n\\nMost of us ordered the Screen Door Plate, an awesome way to sample all the good Southern cooking this restaurant has to offer.  You are allowed to choose any three items from their sides or local organics menu and this comes with a slice of their cornbread.  The sides portions are pretty generous making it easy to share so if you come with a bunch of friends, coordinate your items so you can all try a little of everything!  \\n\\nBecause the local organics menu does seem to change seasonally, I will focus on the sides that I tried:\\n\\nFried catfish - The several times I have had fried catfish I thought that there was just too much breading to actually enjoy the flavor of the catfish, but I thoroughly enjoyed their preparation here.  As I bit into it, the breading was not too thick and it had the perfect amount of saltiness and crunch.  Inside was the wonderfully soft and a little buttery.  Accompanied was a wonderful tartar sauce that makes this side super!  NOTE: If you get this side for the Screen Door Plate, you will be charged a $1 extra.\\n\\nBacon and hamhock collard greens - if you are looking for a possibly healthier side because it has vegetables, you have come to the wrong place and I would not really recommend this one.  The bitterness of the collard greens have been boiled down and made more enjoyable with the pretty nice pieces of bacon. Maybe I am just not a fan of collard greens, but I did not really want to finish it.\\n\\nFried wings - Another fried item and it is still pretty darn good.  The seasoning of the breading on the wings is similar to the one on the catfish.  Great seasoning and the moist chicken meat on the inside made it equally amazing.\\n\\nFried chicken livers - I loved this side!!  I must admit that I do love chicken livers to begin with, but I have never had it fried... and I wish I can have it again like this!  The breading is probably a little thicker and crunchier, which is perfect to counteract the soft buttery texture of liver meat.  You still get a slight hint of the somewhat bitter liver meat that I happen to love, but I know not many are a fan of.  What really seals the deal for this side is the mint jelly!  A combination of minty sweetness that cuts all the saltiness to create a wonder sweet and savory combination.\\n\\nCornbread - Not a fan of this cornbread.  No need to order it as a side since you already get one as a part of the plate and I am not sure why you would really want to order more than what they give you.  Perhaps it is because I am used to expecting a slightly sweet taste to my cornbread but this was just a little too salty for my liking.  Even a slab of butter on this puppy made it more appetizing for me.\\n\\nThere is parking available on the local streets.  Although the wait staff was friendly and helpful, the food took almost thirty five minutes to come out which was a little annoying.  Thank goodness the food made up for it!\\n\\nOverall, there is a lot of (fried) goodies to enjoy here!

A friend arrived at 6:30 and put our name in and they told her our entire party had to be there before they could start our wait time buzzer. Fine... We showed up 15 minutes later and the girl told me and my friend that it would be \\"one hour\\". Also fine by us and we expected that with a party  of our size on a Saturday. We grabbed drinks at the bar. At 7:45 we went to check back. The same hostess told us another 45 minutes! At that point we were a little annoyed that she could underestimate that much and we let her know that...when she told my friend this she made a point to say that she had said earlier it would \\"be an hour PLUS\\". She never said this. She also never apologized for being so wrong about the wait time. I told her it was a friends birthday and we had cancelled reservations elsewhere earlier that day because my friend wanted Mexican. Typically when you say an hour plus, it usually means another 15-20 minutes. Not an hour PLUS another hour.  A little miffed, we went back and got another drink hoping that it wouldn't actually be that long. At 8:45 we were starving, had plans to be somewhere at 9:30ish and obviously wouldn't make it at that point if we were seated any later. We decided to leave and on our way out walked by the manager. He told me his hostess had told us from the beginning that it would be an \\"hour plus\\" and that the table was almost done. We were starving and fed up at this point. I explained how the hostess NEVER said an hour plus. He never apologized for this and actually acted very defensive. Had the girl even just come up to us to apologize for the long wait , or told us at any point in time at the beginning that it could be 2 hours we wouldn't have left so angry.

They have an excellent selection of craft brews too!\\n\\nBetween 2 nights and 4 people, we tried the calamari, tuna nicoise salad, chinese chicken salad, thundering herd bison burger (best ever!), and a variety of the speciality rolls.\\n\\nI wanna be the first to know if this awesome place opens a location in Va Beach or anywhere nearby!"},{"name":"Art Bar","address":"40 Edwin H Land Blvd","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Artbar is a hidden gem.  To be clear, this review is for Artbar's food quality, not their value.  If you are a foodie, you should check out this place.  If you're looking for a value dinner place, this is not it.  \\n\\nAppetizer: the pork ribs were fantastic.  The meat falls right of the bone, super tender.  Excellent.  Easily one of the best pork ribs I've ever had.  In fact, we found this place, because of their participation in the ribs festival in East Cambridge earlier in the summer.  It comes with 4 ribs and a small cornbread on the side, which was equally amazing if not more so.\\n\\nMain course: Scallops.  Scallops in general are extremely hard to cook.  But, they were able to get this to the T.  I loved the creativity of the risotto that comes with it.  But again, you only get 4 scallops, so this is not going to fill most people.  \\n\\nLobster roll.  Their lobster roll was creative and fairly tasty, but I thought it was a bit on the heavy-side.  I've had lighter tasting lobster rolls (e.g. less mayo), so this was a slight disappointment.  \\n\\nDessert: Creme brulee mini.  Excellently done.  \\n\\nThis place pays attention to food detail.  Everything is so excellently cooked.  I thought the service was fantastic despite the other reviews.  There wasn't a wait at all on a Saturday night.\\n\\nI would definitely come back again and might even come back to try one of their tasting menus, which they have only on Saturdays."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Normally I give a 4 if the wait is too long, however, Franklin ' s BBQ is so amazing, I'll wait all day for it!

The breakfast is really a 4 star worthy cafe.\\n\\n\\nAdios - Chorizo Potato Cake is scrumptious and crispy\\n\\nChilaquiles - A little spicy and full of Mexican flavor\\n\\nSouthwest Omelette - Light and fluffy made with fresh ingredients\\n\\nCafe de Olla - Cinnamon Chocolate Coffee, really great stuff. I would drink this every morning.\\n\\nDinner is a whole different ball game here. The well-priced, quality breakfast turns into an over-priced and overrated affair.\\n\\nMexican restaurants tend to run afoul of the same mistakes. They overcook the chicken. They use the wrong cheeses. They hold back on any of the traditional spices in favor of pleasing a squeamish American palette. No Mas saves itself here by using decent ingredients, but unfortunately the preparations are lackluster.\\n\\nEnchiladas de Espinaca - This is my favorite item I've had. Salty goat cheese pairs well with the somewhat bitter tang of spinach. The cream sauce is a nice finishing touch.\\n\\nSopa de Tortilla - This was unmemorable. It lacked spice and flavor. \\n\\nQueso Tradicional - Melted cheese is just impossible to mess up. \\n\\nService is usually decent here. Parking is sometimes annoying if you have to wait for the valet which is not optional on the weekends. I went for a Scoutmob tequila tasting event where I had an excellent butternut squash soup.

Even the dim fluorescent white lighting made it seem like an abandoned hospital in a horror movie after the zombies have taken over.\\n\\nAnd don't get me wrong, I've been to many other Pizza Hut locations that were tiny take-out/delivery only, but none have ever been like this.\\n\\nI wanted to get out of there so badly that I just threw my money down and grabbed my pizza without checking to make sure it was right.

This is going to be a long one. \\n\\nOkay, SOOOOO.... pre-arriving information. Before coming here. I already knew this place was going to be long. Because this place was so famous, I had extremely high expectations. I thought this the type of meat that would end racism. The type of meat that would solve global warming and end terrorism. This the type of meat that make a woman cheat on a man with a secure job and a credit score of 800. I already knew Obama cutted here. I already knew Kanye got rejected. I already knew Gordon Ramsey said it was brilliant. I knew it was going to be long, but not 5 hours long. Just my unlucky day because people usually wait for 3 but also lucky day. You'll find out why soon enough. My mom is pretty Asian so she called me crazy for waiting so long for BBQ. I had to go by myself since I'm from San Diego so I didn't really have anyone else here. Also being from San Diego, there's Phil's BBQ something I can compare it to. \\n\\nI arrived at 8:45 AM on a Friday and the line was already filled up a little passed the corner. One hour later, they told me I'm the \\"last man standing.\\" Meaning I'm the only one guaranteed food, also they estimated that there will be no more ribs, pull pork, and turkey by the time I'm up at 1:45-2 PM. But Yo, I'm a man on a mission. This was more than about the food, this was for the mother****ing experience, the trip, the journey. I met great dudes giving me free beers and played cards with me and I reciprocated by running to CVS and grabbing a 6 pack for them too. Got pretty turnt. Great talks about football, Coachella, backpacking, and whole other stuff. The employees did constant check ups on us. Gave us chairs and umbrellas to borrow so that was nice. At around 10:45, the line started moving cause they open at 11. One of the lady gave me a pulled pork sandwich and it was amazing. Not sure if It was because I was drunk or because it was delicious. Prob delicious. At about 12:30 I was around the front and around 1;30 I was finally inside.\\n\\nNow, when I finally got the food. There wasn't much options for me. Just brisket and sausage. However, it was delicious. The briskets had a good combination of fat and meat. Definitely melt in my mouth. Tasted awesome with the white bread and onions. I couldn't finish tho. I got 2 lbs of brisket and 1 lb of sausage with 1 pint of potato salad. The sausage had a perfect amount of juiciness and crunchiness. The potato salad wasn't anything special so don't even both. \\n\\nLONG REVIEW SHORT. \\nWould I come back? Maybe for the ribs and the other stuff and if I have free time in the morning in Austin. It was a great experience and the wait wasn't that bad trust me. The fact that I knew exactly how long I had to wait really helps. It wasn't necessarily the store's fault. The time went by fast and the people you meet are awesome. \\nWas the food good? Hell yeah.\\nPricey? Not really. Most people eat half a pound but if you eat a lot like me 1-1.5 is fine.

We got seated, and the guy put us at a 2 person table. It was a bit of a tight squeeze with the 2 of us plus the high chair, so we scooted to the 4 person table right next to us. A woman came by to give us a dirty look about it (she looked like she might have been the manager). I said, \\"sorry it was a little tight is it ok we scooted over?\\" Apparently not.

The problem started before we even got to the restaurant.  When he called to make the reservation for 7 pm, they told us we had to be out by 8, because that is when the concert started.  So they basically told us we had to be out before we even got there!  He actually called back and made an earlier reservation.  When we arrived for dinner, the hostess sat us at a table that had dirty silverware.  It looked like someone just ate chocolate cake with the fork that was on the table and put it back.  I asked the hostess if we could sit somewhere else and she moved us to another table where i was arms length away from the man sitting at the table next to us.  He was so drunk he couldnt even read his bill.  He thought the bill was less than it was and when he found out how much it was, he yelled profanities for 10 minutes straight, both to the waitress and to himself.  This was very uncomfortable but we couldnt leave because it was valentines day and we would definitely need a reservation to go anywhere else!  So the waitress came and we ordered an appetizer (hummus) and two kebab dinners.  We waited forever for the appetizer to come, but out came the two dinners.  My boyfriend asked the waitress where our hummus was and she said she forgot about it.  She asked us if we still wanted it, but we already had our dinners on the table so we said no.  He started eating his (he got chicken and i got lamb.)  I pushed my kebab over and there was a huge piece of hair in my plate.  At this point i couldnt believe it.  The waitress didnt even come over to see how our dinner was so my boyfriend had to ask her to come over.  I told her the situation and she offered to get me something else.  I got the same dish.  The next one was hair free.  When the bill came we were still charged for two dinners.  My boyfriend and i had agreed that we wouldnt be going to karoun again.  It is really sad that we had a horrible experience here, because i went here last summer for my birthday and had a good experience.  My family even through a private party for me here for my college graduation and i didnt even have problems then.

It's not that strong though and is pretty sweet/addicting, so be careful about drinking one too many! It's not on the menu, but you can also get a pitcher of yogurt soju ($20) which was also good for sharing. The flavored soju costs the same as other places in Boston ($13). \\n\\nFor the food we tried, the kimchi pancake was more soggy than crispy, but the soy garlic chicken wings were great, as well as the boodae jungol.

I ordered the fried oyster eggs Benedict. Order took over an hour to prepare. The saddest part of all...my eggs Benedict did not have EGGS. Seriously what the heck. They gave me my order and we were in a rush so we left asap to catch an uber and then I opened my box of food and found slices of bacon, 2 slices of English muffin, fried oysters, and potato wedges... But no eggs Benedict. Missing the eggs was bad enough but hollandaise sauce too!?!?! I know they were busy and all but really if the meal is an eggs Benedict you'd think they'd at least remember to put eggs in it. I was sad. I'm still sad about it. I wanted to like this place.

Looking at Yelp reviews we found Paul's Deli and decided to try it out. Both my husband and I were extremely impressed with not only the food but the people that worked there. They talked to us and gave us water for the car. They made us feel like we were family. While we were there we tried the steak cheese sub ( one of the best subs I've had). My son tried the meat ball sub which was delicious also. After we were done with the subs we had three cannolis which made our day. The cream was not too sweet and they make them as you order them.

True that the parking lot was tightly crammed with cars, got lucky and snagged a spot. I had called in ahead and had put my name down. The menu does offer a variety. Wait staff was alright- slight attitude in the beginning but it got better. \\n\\nThe Cajun calamari was tender but not really Cajun style- paprika but nothing more. The green bean parm and onions- okay the green beans are ginormous and the onions are shoestring and taste like Durkee onions. You get a half loaf of warm bread with garlic- just needed the balsamic to go with the olive oil. The cucumbers had seeds so that wasn't very appetizing in a salad. The tomato basil soup tasted like Panera's tomato bisque. \\n\\nI ordered the rib eye medium rare and it came out medium just how I like it. The garlic mashed potatoes were extremely sweet. I think they used heavy cream but no salt on anything. I had the sauce on the side- cream sauce with onions and mushrooms. It would have overpowered the taste of the meat. \\n\\nThe fish and chips were okay. The fish was the best part, the French fries looked old and were not very memorable. The Alaskan stuffed halibut was good minus the sauce and three slices of squash. The meatloaf was just like any other meatloaf. The plate was drenched in sauce.\\n\\nWe sat on the patio.

I was given a gift card for Christmas and used it for our anniversary dinner.   In hind-site, I wish I had sold the gift card.\\n\\nFirst off, the restaurant was terribly over-lit, made me feel like I was eating at a fast food restaurant, not an elegant steakhouse that was going to cost over $200 for two.  \\n\\nSecond, the wait staff RUNS around the restaurant which also adds to the fast food restaurant atmosphere.  Usually at an expensive restaurant the wait-staff walks (or glides) at a wedding march pace, this is not the case at Ruth's Chris.\\n\\nThird, we were seated by a computer station at a four top table.  The wait-staff would rush (run) to this computer and if they knocked my chair once, they did it 100 times during dinner.\\n\\nFourth, since we were seated at a four-top with two people, the wait staff kept moving one of our empty chairs so they could cut between two tables to get to the aforementioned computer without walking through the aisle as they should have.  My husband kept standing up and moving the chair back to prevent them from doing this since they were rushing by my chair and hitting me.  After the fourth time, he hooked his foot on the leg of the chair so it couldn't be moved, and tactfully told the server to take her hands off the chair, quit rushing by our table and hitting my chair.\\n\\nFifth, I ordered a Fillet and my husband ordered an aged Porterhouse, both Medium Rare.  Both arrived Medium to Medium-well and dry which to us is inedible.\\n\\nOverall, it was one of the WORST restaurant experiences of my life.  I would highly recommend about any other steakhouse in Columbus in this same price range, and NOT Ruth's Chris which is unprofessional and horrible.\\n\\nThe staff was not at all well trained and seemed as if they needed to be working in low-end chain restaurant not a high end steak house.\\n\\nBad, bad, bad.

After getting light apps at the Mandarin, we walked over to Sonsie to get a couple more drinks and grabbed two seats at the bar.  Even though it feels cramped, there always seem to be more people than you'd expect in the bar area, and it's easy to get involved in a conversation with someone.  As for food, I think the verdict is in based on numerous reviews - average at best.  We shared the farfalle, which sounded like it was going to be tasty (cream crab, sundried tomatoes, lemon and mint).  But it was really bland, and the sundried tomatoes were whole, not chopped and worked into the dish.  But I do give the bar props because they actually forgot to submit our order and when we asked about it a half hour later, they admitted the mistake and gave us both a free drink.

Only thing was drinks was not included at this point.  \\n\\nOnce inside we had front row seats to the show.  The staff treated us like we were the only patrons and the entire time was first class treatment.  They were selling items prior to the show I.e.

We did purchase items and the kids enjoyed using them during the show.  \\n\\nWe had six in our party to include an infant which they allowed to sit in his own seat.  The food was nothing  to write home about but also there was nothing to complain about either.  With VIP you had all you can drink beer or two glasses of wine.  I will agree with some reviews the drinks we slow to be filled, however our waitress took care of us with the wine where she filled our wine glasses up when half full and gave us an extra glass.  \\n\\nThe show was very good and it was very family friendly but not childish.  The entire family enjoyed the show especially the action scenes and the interaction parts of the show.  Audience participation was amazing to where I even joined in ( I normally do not). The cast was very approachable and made sure to acknowledge all of the children.  Only thing was, I was unaware about some of the special effects ( gun shots) that were very loud and scared my 4 year old.  Not complaining but just be aware with younger children.

Their chicken quesadillas are my new favorite in town- they are giant and flavorful and reheat well the next day.

On top of the unexplained long waits for food, I've witnessed customers get treated quite poorly on several occasions. My most recent visit convinced me never to go back for a few reasons:\\n\\n    1. The man who made my food placed falafel balls on my plate with his bare hands. This was immediately after I witnessed him shake hands with a customer and then use his phone (to show said customer photos). Most of the employees usually wear gloves, but this manager-type didn't care to. If this is how they handle food in plain view of customers, I do not want to know what happens during their food prep.\\n\\n    2. After an otherwise decent eating experience, I went up to pay. I was asked what I had ordered and told him. He asked me to clarify which variation of the 'plate' I had received. I honestly didn't know and when he charged me for the most expensive one without listening to my response, I asked him \\"how do I know which plate I received?\\" So far it was a pretty innocuous conversation and I was more than happy to pay for what I had eaten and walk out the door mostly satisfied. The cashier snapped at me saying 'we always ask you what kind of plate you want when you order!\\"  Well, I was not asked. Or if I were asked, I did not hear the question and gave no response. I tried to explain that fact and he just kept asserting \\"we always ask\\" until I felt sufficiently demeaned as to not return.\\n\\n\\nWhile I would never give a one star review based on a single moderately bad experience, I've witnessed others experience this horrible service on several occasions.

A waiter comes by, asking our water preference, already picking up the bottle of water on the table assuming we don't want it. \\n\\nOn to the bread. Served with a trio of dips, it was creatively done. Our accompaniments included a red-pepper hummus (which doesn't really go with either their corn bread or sourdough - If you're serving hummus, where's the pita?), strong-flavored molasses dip, and some chili-pepper cream cheese which was nice. Despite the creative dips, I was ultimately longing for a few pads of butter for my cold bread.\\n\\nThe first course was the ceviche with chips and slow-cooked chicken flautas. We immediately dove in head-first after consuming the bright vibrant colors of our respective dishes. Unfortunately, a trend came to be \\"A+ creativity, B- taste) The ceviche was ridiculously acidic (moreso than any ceviche should be) with the chips serving very little purpose while the flautas were nice and crunchy on the outside but mushy and bland on the inside.\\n\\nThe main courses were blackened tuna and eggplant \\"steak\\". The plates again looked fantastic, making our mouths water but ultimately fail to meet expectations. The chili-rubbed tuna had an okay taste - nice heat, good sauce - but was definitely missing something. The accompanying obligatory starch and vegetables - potatoes and mushrooms - had no business on the plate. The eggplant steak, however, was very interesting. The vinaigrette was light and bound all the components together. The goat cheese had a bit of a kick thanks to the chili-happy chef, but it tasted surprisingly good.\\n\\nI honestly felt the most attention as we were getting ready to leave.

They had the best in town for the last 2-3 years, even if it was a little bit frustrating sometimes when they were changing their menu for no apparent reason.\\n\\nAtmosphere 5/5: Irish Bar by excellence, this restaurant is the oldest in Portland, OR and the venue has been well maintained throughout the years. On one side, you have a classy restaurant and the other side, you have a bar decorated with many famous celebrities who ate at Jake's.\\nFood 4/5: Great food. I'm a fan of their Bouillabaisse! It is my favorite dish on the Dinner menu. For happy hour, the Cajun Chicken Sandwich is the signature dish! Sushis, Spinach & Artichoke dip and Sweet Potato Fries are some great options on the Happy Hour menu as well!\\nService 3/5: At Times, we really experienced the greatest service from the personnel. They knew we were regulars and prepared our order even before seating at the table! (5/5 for this one)\\n\\nThroughout the years, we brought a LOT of customers at Jake's for afterwork drinks, or business meetings. To be clear, we aren't expecting anything back but at least some flexibility and better service with good customers. One of the problem encountered by us is greatly explained by one of the review wrote by one of the Elite Yelp member Michelle Pearl G. since the incident I had happened to be with her. I talked to the manager and he was sincereley sorry for what happen.

Likewise, he insisted on the comp. I suggested they just take a couple drinks off the check and that would be fine. The check came with a more than generous discount.

From the giant \\"ENTER HERE\\" or whatever it is painted on the outside to the bathrooms tucked right next to the stage where you might get smacked by a guitar neck on your way out.\\n\\nEver since stopping by one night after my friend missed his flight for a school fund raiser, whenever I get a hankerin' for good bbq, awesome loud blues, or want to feel like I've been transported to some swampy rural backcountry lot in Mississippi, I head over here.\\n\\nNow, I've never had the chicken, but really now, the test of barbeque is the ribs.  And Fat Matt's passes with flying colors.  Sweet, tangy, smokey, deliciousness slathered atop meat that truly falls off the bones.  You probably won't finish your meal with clean fingers, but that's ok, because you'll enjoy licking them clean.\\n\\nSeated as a stand-alone structure with a small parking lot, the place definitely feels pretty \\"shack.\\"  The first thing to greet you upon entering is a giant walk-in refrigerator.  I guess there just wasn't enough space to put it anywhere else.  The cashier/counter is quick and friendly, but make sure you decide what you want off of the giant menu board before approaching.  You'll probably have plenty of time though, since there's a good chance of a line on any given night.\\n\\nOne of the most interesting things about Fat Matt's' place is the lack of any sort of interior lighting.  Other than some stage lights, there are no lights at all.  Go ahead, look up.  Sure, some track lights that look like all the bulbs burned out years ago and have never been replaced.  Instead, all the lighting is provided by the blue-red glow of the neon signs hanging in the window, just another ambiance-setter.\\n\\nRibs, check.  Place, check.  Oh, the sides.  I usually end up with two, but never finish them both.  But I definitely like their coleslaw, a creamy, flavorful, slightly peppered version, and the beans help bring out the tang in the suace.\\n\\nAs for service...there's sort of waiter service, but sort of not.  You order at the cashier, and then the staff comes and serves your food and clears the table when you're done.  So...not true waiter service.  More like bus service.\\n\\nOne thing to be aware of, though, is the music.  It's loud.  It's raucous sometimes, and it'll be tough to hold a conversation without shouting.  But that's OK, because it's always a good band with a great sound.\\n\\nI was just there last week, but I may need to head over again."},{"name":"Punjab Cafe","address":"653 Southern Artery","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"I was a little weary of trying out Indian food since I had a really bad first experience, but after some convincing, I decided to give it another go.

I think so. If I had to use one word to describe the food at this place, it would probably be \\"tasty\\". Yes, the hamburgers are actually tasty. So the name of this place actually means what it says. \\n\\nThe first time I came here, I got a tasty Mushroom Burger, which has mushrooms, Swiss cheese and A1 Steak Sauce. The burger meat was really tasty, good, juicy, flavorful, chewy and tender. The cheese and the steak sauce, combined with the soft chewiness of the bun, made it a really tasty hamburger. The hamburger sandwich itself is not really big, probably about the size of a Quarter Pounder from your local McDonald's. However, the hamburgers they serve are probably 5 times tastier than McDonald's, and they are probably competitive with Five Guys Burgers and Fries Hamburgers in terms of tastiness. 2-3 tasty hamburgers from this place should satisfy a hunger craving. \\n\\nThey do a really tasty and good job with their side dishes. Their onion rings are not a bad choice, they are nice and thin, with a good amount of crispiness. They are fairly tasty and addicting to eat. A little seasoning and they are probably tastier. As for the French Fries, they are decently tasty, but they are even tastier if you get sausage gravy doused on top. This warm, gooey, and tasty sauce, combined with the tasty sausage pieces, along with the crispiness of the fries made it a really tasty side dish and also an addicting side dish to eat. It's messy to eat, so we used some forks. We felt fairly heavy after eating a lot of these fries, so it was a good idea to walk a good distance afterwards. \\n\\nOne major disadvantage this place has is that the soda drinks are kind of expensive ($2), and they serve them in plastic bottles rather than from the fountain tap. I think that is a little bit strange. Environment is really casual, with a small bar inside to get some beer, and a billiards table for some fun. \\n\\nThis place is at a really good location, near Fenway Park, so I think this place can get really crowded whenever a baseball game or a rare concert occurs. It's also open until 2:00 AM, so it's still a good choice after a night out in the city, or if you are still awake at 1:30 in the morning, and you suddenly get the \\"munchies\\" feeling (a sudden hunger feeling after you did something fun and exciting). There's parking, so you can actually drive here. \\n\\nOverall, this is a really good choice to get some tasty hamburgers or some really tasty fries with sausage gravy. Like I said before in my previous reviews regarding tasty and potentially unhealthy places to eat at, I would not eat here often, unless I have an intense exercise routine before or a few hours after."},{"name":"Waffle House","address":"7809 E Ben White Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Waffle House seems to be pretty consistent no matter where you are in the country.

In 20-30 minutes we got our wish, though we sat on the patio which was a bit brisk (especially after 5 glasses of iced sweet tea!).  The menu is filled with your standard southern foods so the decision was difficult.  For starters, we got the macaroni and cheese (phenomenal!!).  I got the brisket as my entree, which was very good with a tasty BBQ sauce.  The brisket did have quite a bit of fat on it, which I'm not into so I cut that off.  The brisket came with green beans (ok) and potato salad (VERY good with a spicy mustard flavor).  My wife got the fried chicken, which she really liked though she noted how black peppery it was.  Her dish came with mashed potatoes and collards, both of which were very good.  As per usual, I'd hoped to have dessert but was far too stuffed to even attempt it.

I was hoping Porter would be better because it's really close to my house, but oh well such is life. \\n\\nThe drinks and beer selection are really good. They have all the beers listed on these TV screens above the bar with all the details of each beer which I think is really handy. However, they do leave out a huge detail of each beer: the price, which I think is rather odd.\\n\\nAlso, banana nut old fashion? As good as it sounds.\\n\\nThe food was what I found most meh. The biggest issue I had was with bread. Beer cheese fondue? Great, but I could have used way more pretzel bread and was less apples. Obviously I am not being health conscious if I'm ordering melted cheese infused with beer. Give me the bread.\\n\\nThe charcuterie plate was nice, but also had a bread problem.

There's pretty much always a wait. Sometimes shorter than others, but it is always crowded.

When my birthday was coming up, and my parents were in town visiting, it seemed like the perfect excuse!\\n\\nBe prepared to wait. But know that it will be well worth it. We were quoted 45 minutes and ended up waiting a hour. This wasn't so bad, because we walked to the Food Pod on 28th and got coffee and tea and were able to walk around since it was such a beautiful day! (You can also get beer there, if you prefer that!)\\n\\nIt's pretty tight quarters inside the restaurant and it can be pretty loud. They also have a nice patio, which is a bit more roomy. Our service was good, considering how busy it was.\\n\\nWe started with cocktails and they were all very good. I had a Sweet Tea Vodka cocktail which was refreshing and delicious.\\n\\nFor appetizers, we started with the Lowcountry Shrimp and Grits and the Hushpuppies. The Shrimp and Grits (also available as an Entree) were so delicious. The shrimp was perfectly cooked, and the grits were creamy as can be. The bacon, garlic, tomatoes and white wine flavors were mouth-watering and savory. The Hushpuppies were also delicious, not too heavy or greasy, and the Pepper Jelly was an excellent companion, adding a bit of heat.\\n\\nIt seems that you can't go wrong with any Entree you choose. We all got something different and loved everything. They also have a long list of Specials, Vegetarian Dishes and Sides, which you can view on their Tumblr (via their website). \\n\\nThe Screen Door Plate is a popular choice because it allows you to try multiple small dishes at once. This is what I got, and my choices included Catfish, Macaroni & Cheese and a roasted beet salad. The portions for everything are huge. The four generous pieces of perfectly fried Catfish were delicious, and even more delicious with the Remoulade sauce. The Mac & Cheese was incredibly rich and decadent, so much so that I couldn't finish even half. (But my husband happily helped). I was so glad that I got a salad as part of this plate, to help cut all of the richness. The cornbread is sweet and savory.\\n\\nOther Entrees at the table included the Fried Chicken, which is so delicious and boneless, a huge plus. The Beef Brisket is incredibly tender with a distinct smoked flavor, and the Pork and Beans were full of slightly-spicy molasses flavor. All of the side dishes steal the show. They also had no problem subbing side dishes (i.e.: the Brisket comes with potato salad, but they happily gave my mayonnaise-phobic dad mashed potatoes instead).\\n\\nDesserts aren't to be missed either, no matter how full you are! The Banoffee Pie is a perfect choice. Piled high with bananas, fluffy whipped cream and caramel, it's oh so yummy.\\n\\nYou will definitely bring home leftovers. And the prices just can not be beat."},{"name":"Saigon Seafood","address":"270 Adams St","city":"Dorchester","stars":"3","text":"The only thing i ever get here is plain rice, or salt and pepper chicken.

Yet the service there was frustrating to say the least. With an inattentive waitstaff we felt we had to remind of our existence (asking a few times for more water towards the middle of the meal and the check at the end) the whole experience seemed okay but not ideal.\\n\\nThis evening, however, we had a really upsetting interactions-- feeling really unseen and completely taken advantage of in a multitude of ways.\\nBack story: As we are moving this weekend and--clich√© as it is, try to have Saturday nights be our dinners out--we opted to have food ordered in to our new apartment. \\n\\nNow, we are aware of what ordering food in entails and, as so, changed our expectations accordingly. But, wowza--what a serious bummer! Not only did Sforno pack our food so half hazardly that the gnocchi spilled all into the bag (and really, that sauce is the best part of the whole dish), but the spinach ravioli came with an absurdly little amount of food (in comparison to what we, as creatures of habit, have gotten for portions at the restaurant). \\n\\nHear me out, I acknowledge that all restaurants and people have bad days--we all in tha human boat. \\nYet, with the $20+ entrees thrown together as if we weren't supposed to even eat them, and the entire meal coming--not luke warm--but cold, we were actually really flusterated (frustrated + flustered). \\n\\nThe Arugula salad, which usually comes with a nice portion of Parmesan, was literally just a pile of greens with a 1/2 teaspoon of cheese at the bottom and olive oil. I had to add my own cheese and lemon to the salad and was so grumpy while eating it, I struggled to enjoy the meal.  \\n\\nIf we had been ordering from a lesser expensive, more chain/fast food restaurant, these really big issues would have seemed like minor annoyances. However, spending $75 on a meal that was so utterly disappointing is ACTUALLY the reason I signed up for yelp and am posting this now...\\n\\nI don't think we'll ever visit Sforno again, because it feels as if treating their to-go costumers as lesser is actually a company ethic. \\nOut of site, out of mind--but actually just really sad and disappointing to spend so much on a meal just to feel utterly ghosted.

Mellow Mushroom's legacy and stature is such that I had even heard about it and been told to go there before I moved to Austin. When I got here, it was even worse. Mellow Mushroom has been described as the best pizza place in the world, but that's a pure lie.\\n\\nI stopped in for lunch one day, intending to buy a slice of pizza since I wasn't all that hungry. Strike one was when I apparently arrived five minutes too late to order a single slice. Why? No one could give an answer. It's just company policy to only serve single slices for two hours a day and if you miss the mark by even a few minutes you're not going to get one.\\n\\nBegrudgingly, I ordered one of the very overpriced whole pizzas. I ordered a medium cheese pizza. What I got looked a lot more like the size of a personal pan pizza from a Pizza Hut drive-thru. I was glad I didn't get a single slice just because the slices were so tiny. For half the price I could have gotten a slice twice the size over at Roppolo's on 6th St.\\n\\nThe taste wasn't much different from a Pizza Hut drive-thru either. It was bland pizza. It might as well have been Digiorno. It was also the kind of pizza which falls completely apart the second you pick it up. Lots of scooping cheese off the plate here.\\n\\nBy the time I was done, I was pretty appalled at all the recommendations I had gotten for this place. Not only that but I was completely disgusted by the gaudy artwork and the \\"stoner aesthetic\\" of the place, which I'm beginning to think is the appeal and also why nobody notices that it doesn't taste very good.\\n\\nThe final insult though was that it took almost twenty minutes to leave because apparently when changing shifts there is absolutely no one to take a check.

In all the food isn't bad but a bit on the salty side - actually that's my biggest complaint - it's not like we all don't consume too much salt as it is - I'm guessing that since I don't use salt when cooking at home I'm a bit sensitive to it when eating out. This cafeteria is your typical meat and two veggies with bread, similar to Picadilly and others of this style - you queue up in a line with a tray and place items on it. The best deals are the daily features (usually a meat and two veggies). I usually stick with either something fried - the southern food preparation is spot on (slightly hammered or moreso veggies - meaning cooked until very soft), but the hot food is served hot so that's a cut above many other food lines which tend to be only warm from sitting in a steam table.\\n\\nI started paying attention to cafeteria food when I moved back to Atlanta in the early 90's - before that I wouldn't be caught dead in one, preferring foods that are prepared \\"fresh\\" - or so I thought. It's something of a misnomer that the stuff you order in a sit-down-and-order-from-a-server type restaurant is cooking items to your order. After working in restaurants for 10 years I can tell you that many of those items are not \\"a la minute\\" at all, but rather at least partially prepared and assembled as the tickets come in. Some items are already made and just scooped up and plopped on the plate. It was my friend Eric (of Criminal Records fame) that opened my eyes to cafeterias - we went and ate at the lunch counter at the Carter Center - actually quite good. After that I sampled all the usual suspects. I still hit Matthews in Tucker and occasionally, a Piccadilly (can't beat them  for convenience with so many locations) - just be wary of the Sunday afternoon after-church crowd).\\n\\nThe trick on cafeteria food is to manage your expectations - it's not like your sitting down at the Ritz - especially for a $5.99 plate. So for me, as long as the veggies aren't totally hammered, the meat not over-cooked or obviously left in the pan too long (dry is a symptom), then I'm fairly happy. S&S in general does a good job, just a bit salty as I've already stated.  I've had the corn beef (good), roast beef (slightly dry), and fried chicken (good). I would skip on the salad unless you like iceberg lettuce, and anything that looks like it's been sitting for a while. Also anything swimming in sauce should probably be avoided (note that as being true for any cafeteria) as that can be a dumping ground of yesterday's leftovers.\\n\\nIf you go right on the tail end of lunch, say 1:00-1:15 PM or so, you'll get relatively fresh food that's still hot - later in the afternoon and it may be questionable. Evenings are fine. The best times to eat here is to hit right when the lines start to come down to 4 or 5 people, that way you're probably getting the freshest food with the least amount of wait.

The mozzarella salad is amazing, and the cheese plate with it's variety and paring with bountiful fruit, nuts, and meat is awesome... \\n\\nNow for the bad :( I work in the service industry which leads me to be very forgiving of busy situations, bad food, and sometimes even rudeness (everyone has a bad day every now and then), but this was possibly the worst service I've experienced in a long time! \\n\\nIt started great the host sat us promptly outside on the patio as requested. No wine list was given, but it was lunch, so forgive able in my book even though my company and I wished to order wine. We just decided we order the house white and a prosecco. We waited literally 12 minutes until someone came to the table. We had already decided on our meal, changed our mind, and decided on new entrees in the span of time it took to even be greeted. \\n\\nThe waitress was moving VERY slow, which is disappointing to see with a packed house for lunch on a weekday. Lunch breaks are only an hour, I expect service to be prompt. We decided against getting bar drinks since it seemed as though we wouldn't even get them in time. So we got the hibiscus tea (outstanding btw) and a diet coke. Here is where my being forgiving turned to just being annoyed. \\n\\nWe waited an additional 15 minutes for our drinks!! Only after FLAGGING down a girl that was NOT our server was she approaching with our drinks, which was IMMEDIATELY followed by the food runner bringing our food. This is unacceptable. If I wanted my drink and food at same time I would have gone to subway right across the street. We promptly gave her our card to pay the bill not knowing how quickly it would take her to return. She looked offended... But at that point it had been nearly 30 minutes of just SITTING there... \\n\\nThe lady next to us also ordered before we got there, a scoop of chicken salad and a hard boiled egg, she hadn't received her food until 2-3 minutes after ours...

However the service offered is entirely opposite to the quality of the food served. There are multiple incidents where the staff has behaved extremely rude. First of all they take their own sweet time to take the orders, and we have to wait what seems like eternity until they get the dishes. I wonder if they go for grocery shopping after taking our orders! So to avoid this hassle, once we ordered the dishes by calling them and told them that we would reach there in 15 mins. And when we reached there, the staff (I dont know if he was the manager or a waiter) yelled at us when we ordered some more dishes. I mean seriously who would yell at their guests! This was my 1st bad incident in this restaurant. But since the food was good, I went again with my friends for dinner. And this time too as usual they took the orders late and served late. I agree that they it takes time to cook dishes. But isn't there a concept like first come first serve? The server happily went on to serve another table who came in after us and ordered dishes after we did. Okay I can let go even that, he might have got confused or probably they had tipped him more the previous time they came, so the preferential treatment could be because of that. After waiting for such a long time, the waiter could at least get all dishes, instead he got us only one bowl of rice for a table of four while each of us ordered different items. Fine, may be he couldnt carry all the bowls together. So we requested him for an extra bowl of rice, and this was his exact reply \\"I cannot get it now. You finish that bowl of rice, I will get it later\\". What the heck man, is this some kind of joke? I will tell you this restaurant has the hopeless service in the entire Atlanta region. And wait today was my 3rd bad incident. As usual food was good, service was slow. When we asked for individual checks, though he used a calculator he miscalculated and added extra tax to one of my friend's check. When we asked him to verify, he did not even apologize. However he deducted the extra tax. And when I went to the counter to pay, to be on the safe side, I wanted to make sure that the bill is accurate. He on the other hand, instead of doing his job right, he threw my credit card on the desk. This was the worst experience I have had in any restaurant by far.

My favorite sandwich is the Golden Gate.  It's the perfect blend of sweetness from the chutney and the saltiness from the bacon.  It's also a pretty big portion, and I usually can only eat half the sandwich.  If you choose to dine-in, the wait will be slightly longer than you might expect.  Also, the cupcakes are just decent.

The pan fried halibut salad was horribly overdressed and drippy, but the halibut was delicious.  The smoked salmon linguini had big chunks of tasty salmon but the linguini was dry and the texture was like grit.  Great service, bread, and onion rings.  Maybe we just hit an off day, and lunch isn't as good as dinner, because I was really happy with my previous experience there.  I'll still give it four stars, but perhaps people should stick to dinner."},{"name":"The Bombay","address":"2748 Lougheed Highway, Suite 205","city":"Port Coquitlam","stars":"4","text":"For us, this is still the best Indian restaurant in the Lower Mainland! The food is DELICIOUS, the service is wonderful, gracious, attentive, flexible and friendly. We are always served quickly. Love the lamb saag, Naan, butter chicken, the lunch buffet, dal, rice pudding, and the tandoori chicken. Usually I don't like tandoori because the chicken is usually cooked til it's dry, but here, it's juicy, tender, moist - amazing! My little niece and nephew and sister, dad, husband all love the food as well. If I lived in Coquitlam, I would eat here regularly. It's a real treat whenever we get a chance to eat here. 5+ stars! :)"},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Wow.

Probably not much but I'll have to try anyway.\\n\\nAfter flying into Austin for the ACL Festival and a bit too much drinking, my yelp bff and I decided to wake up at 6:30 and walk to Franklins from where we were staying; about 1.5 miles. Not too bad of a plan for 2 sleep deprived, semi sober guys. We get there around 7:30 and are probably the 25th people in line. Frankins provides plenty of folding chairs for those lucky enough to get there first, so...get there first! After about an hour or so, employees begin walking about, setting up trash/recycle bins along what I assume will be the trail of hungry people to come. They are super friendly, and as other reviews said before, they walk down the line and ask what people think they'd like to order (to get a gauge of how much bbq they'll have available). The very clean bathrooms are also available for use.\\n\\nSteadily throughout the day, the long grows and swerves into the parking lot out back where Legends coffee is conveniently set up. People are very friendly and talkative, with beers and boardgames if that tickles your fancy. My only real gripe were the line holders/cutters, as there were a small handful that surreptitiously joined their friends near opening time at 11. So not cool at all as it's disrespectful to those who wait. Nothing to really get in a fuss about but you'll be called out about it next time. I promise.\\n\\nOnto the food though. The best BBQ I've ever had in my life. Our eyes were bigger than our mouths so we each ordered a pound of brisket, half fatty cut, half lean cut, 1/4th lb turkey, 1/4th lb pulled pork, 2 pork ribs, a sausage link and single servings of all the side. The fatty cut brisket...MY GOD. SO juicy and literally falls apart at the slightest tug. It's so damn good but so damn decadent. Sop up the collagen, fat, and brisket juice with the bread. You'll need it. The lean cut was also very good. The smokiness of the oak could be tasted in every bite. I found myself smiling and my eyes rolling after every mouthful. The turkey was the best I've ever had as it was juicy as well and I wished I'd gotten more. The ribs and pulled pork were good, but the stars were the brisket and turkey. I'll load up on those two next time. The sausage was tasty, less spicy than I expected, but I actually prefer Salt Licks over Franklins. Get the pinto beans on the side. They they add chipped smoked brisket to it! SO flavorful. Best beans ever! Wish I got some more of that too.\\n\\nEveryone hate lines, but this is probably the only place I've ever been to that I would said it was worth the wait AND that I would gladly wait another 4 hours each and every time I'm in Austin. It's that good.\\n\\nDon't forget the pickles, the vinegar and bbq sauce as well. Adds a nice punch to the gorge-fest."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This isn't anything special. Much better food elsewhere in Atlanta. And yes, I had the fried chicken. It was good but again, nothing special and not worth the high price tag. Biscuits are pretty good but West Egg's are better!

I was looking for a new place to go for my birthday for me and my Mom (and by new, I mean new to me) and Aria came highly recommended from a trusted friend and fellow Elite.  And we were not disappointed.  The place is quite loud - but considering the decor has nothing with which to absorb any sound, I should not have been surprised.\\n\\nWe had a 2-man serving team, Mike and Dmitri.  Both attentive, but not in our faces and left us to enjoy our meal at a nice and easy pace.  We ordered our cocktails and perused the menu and wine list - so many choices.  Unfortunately, the tasting menu was not meant for me (too many allergy items on there), but I was happy with my selections from the main menu.\\n\\nMy cocktail was a Dark Rum Daisy which consisted of Smith & Cross Navy Strength rum, Fresh Lemon, Jack Rudy Grenadine and Grapefruit Bitters.  Sweet, tart, not too strong, but definitely had a kick in the pants to it.  Delish!  My Mom picked from the extensive single malt scotch list and opted for the Glenmorangie 10 year.\\n\\nFor my food, I opted for the:\\nHomemade Potato Gnocchi with golden raisins and charred radicchio and balsamic\\nSlow Braised Niman Ranch Berkshire Pork & Belly with swiss chard, applewood smoked bacon, cannelini beans, polenta and natural jus\\nChocolate Espresso Cake and I subbed Vanilla ice cream instead of the almond toffee it was supposed to come with (allergies).\\n\\nEverything was delightfully prepared, with such great attention to detail.  The plates were immaculately plated  - like pieces of art.  The gnocchi was so soft and tender with the perfect balance of bitter from the radicchio and the sweetness from the raisins.  I could have eaten twice the helping of this - I considered a 2nd plate.  The Pork (or as I liked to call it - porkporkpork), was probably the best version of a triple pork bypass I have tasted ever (and I lot of places do something like this).  The Loin (Mike said it was loin) was falling apart tender - no need for a knife.  It just pulled away from itself into fabulous little strings of porky goodness just dripping in jus.  The piece of pork belly was seared off so that the fat was perfectly rendered with crunchy at the top, but soft and juicy in the middle.  The meat at the bottom of the piece was tender and bordering on sweet.  Then there was the lardons of bacon in the cannelini beans (not to be overlooked).  Big thick, slightly crunchy pieces in the middle of those beans and chard.  YUM!\\n\\nNow for dessert - Odds are I will always opt for the chocolately thing on the menu, but there were 2.  I had to turn to Mike for guidance.  And as I suspected, it had to be the Chocolate Espresso Cake.  This perfect little cylinder of tender dark chocolate cake came out, packed with flavor and a punch of coffee for finish.  I was thankful for the little scoop of vanilla ice cream to help cut the richness of the cake as I sipped my Cappuccino on the side.\\n\\nThe restaurant cooks everything to order (I was told by Mike), so my meal was free from any tree nuts and was checked to be safe.  I appreciate the attention to detail and my safety.\\n\\nAmazingly delicious food, well-paced and courteous service and a nice, albeit loud, atmosphere and I am sure to return to Aria again."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Had a nice dinner here last week.
