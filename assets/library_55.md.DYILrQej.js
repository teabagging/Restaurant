They know what they're doing here and run a pretty straightforward business which is a nice relief from the pop-up, vegan, tapas, hipster places that are trending up most of Boston with ridiculous menu items and \\"culinary concepts\\" that often leave me looking for some real Food.\\n\\nUnlike typical dim sum places, this place does NOT have a push cart, which I -frankly- like. No army of waiters trying to squeeze carts full of staling and cold food in between a sea of tables like a family of 4 from Florida squeezing into a compact car Uber. Then again, there's barely any space in this one aisle restaurant anyway. A menu with pictures of the more popular items can assist those unfamiliar with the ways of dim sum.\\n\\nTypical staples were good and came to the table hot and fresh- since almost everything is made closer to order since there are no carts. Scallion pancakes were DEEP FRIED to my surprise and had great texture but also chew. Sesame balls, stuffed tofu, pork and veggie buns were are also up to par. Tea was complimentary. \\n\\nFood was delivered to the table unceremoniously, but we didn't care. Waiters and managers occasionally sat at the desk near our table at the window, staring blankly out at the light street traffic. Not overpriced, decent food, typical Chinatown charm in this crammed street front restaurant which probably skates by building and fire safety code in typical down home Chinese restaurant style. No wheelchair access for the few stairs above street level so take care of traveling with someone who needs assistance. You can ask for validation for parking if you dare to park in the maze of a parking garage about 2 blocks away, 3$ off- could order another plate. \\n\\nLunch crowd of locals can be MASSIVE even on weekdays. We came early, leaving around noon, and there was a line almost out the door as we went down the stairs. Seems like demand for takeout is lively too- we saw numerous bags being handed off curbside. \\n\\nMight be back again, was pleasantly surprised with Boston's Chinatown!"},{"name":"Sweet Hereafter","address":"3326 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Bye & Bye's new endeavor, Sweet Hereafter, is finally here, after all. And it's definitely sweet. And frankly, it brings a much needed flush of energy into the already transforming Belmont strip. I am excited to have this new food and beverage spot here, and will definitely visit often. \\n\\nThe space is dark yet comfortable and welcoming. Lots of dark wood, rustic light fixtures, reused early Americana touches (not so much to be campy) and some random sports paintings round out the decor. The sense of style embedded in the design keeps it from being a clich√©, however. It's not so \\"sporty\\" as to be a sports bar, it's not so dark as to be a dive, and it's not so antique-y as to be a throw-back vintage bar. It simply has enough of each element to bring together a laid back vibe. The white marble bar-top is a nice touch.\\n\\nOn the menu is vegan fare - same as Bye & Bye. I have yet to sample the food but initial reports put it on par with B&B's fare, which is quite good for bar food. I look forward to trying the Jamaican Bowl and their house veg burger. \\n\\nThe drink list is a mix of a few carefully selected taps for beer, a few B&B style mason jar concoctions and some higher end cocktails like a Company Daiquiri (a variation on a traditional Hemingway) made with Smith & Cross rum. I'm a sucker for any drink made with Smith & Cross. The higher end cocktails run in the $8 range, which is totally reasonable for the quality. Happy hour runs from 4-7 every day and offers $1 off wells and some other neat little discounts. \\n\\nThe real kicker that pushes this up to 5 stars is the sweet patio out back. Ringed in by fencing and bamboo with some cover for those rainy days we get sometimes here in PDX, this little outdoor mecca is sure to be packed on any sunny day. \\n\\nOne visit and I'm smitten with this place.

I was afraid the black pepper would be overpowering but it wasn't at all.  The strawberry honey balsamic was a great combination of sweet and savory.  It is a bit on the tangier side so the ocumare chocolate, which is a bittersweet chocolate, was a great complement to the strawberry flavor.\\n\\nAnother great thing about Salt and Straw is that they are amazingly patient with you trying samples.

First, I'm only giving this place 2 stars because of the customer service. I ordered the fried tacos with al pastor, a seasoned beef taco, and a tostada.  When the food arrived, I was told they are no longer serving the tostada due to too many complaints and took it off the menu. They brought chips and guacamole out and refunded the money for the tostada. Awesome customer service!  However, let's get to the food. \\n\\nFirst, I ordered the fried tacos with al pastor. The al pastor was super bland and had no flavor. When you think of al pastor, my mind goes to really good pork seasoned with chiles and pineapple; this tasted of neither.  HUGE letdown from a place whose claim to fame is al pastor.  The fried taco shells were nothing to be excited about, no crunch at all and tasted bland.  The fried tacos are supposed to come with re-fried beans topped with lettuce, cotija cheese, salsa, and crema; however, my tacos came with nothing.  I sent back my tacos and the guy confirmed they were supposed to come with everything on them and not self made at the toppings bar.  When I got the tacos back the second time, they came with only lettuce and crema so I just finished making them with what I found on the toppings bar.  THANK GOD for the toppings bar as this was the only relief to the terrible food.\\n\\nNext, I had a seasoned beef taco. The beef was extremely bland (common theme with the food here).  It was just a less than average taco, you could get a better taco at Taco Bell. \\n\\nFinally, the chips and guacamole that was brought to the table. If you guessed it was bland, you'd be right! Chips had no seasoning, not even a sprinkle of salt. The guacamole had no salt and needed some acid to balance the fat. I added salt and lime juice which made it bearable to eat. \\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't eat here again. Especially knowing you have Taco Norte√±o 5 minutes down the road.  Save your money, time, and taste buds and go elsewhere. \\n\\nQuote of the night, \\"no wonder why it's called 4 Locos, you would need to be blacked out to enjoy it.\\" \\n\\nSuper disappointed that the first launch of Mexican cuisine failed miserably in downtown Winter Garden.

I really just wanted to leave as we'd now sat at that table for 45 mins trying to gaining his attention.  but the kids heard dessert and their eyes lit up, how could I say no.  so we waited, it didn't take THAT long.  I was a bit frustrated and my patience/generosity had expired, I figured a 12.5% tip (from the total bill pre-groupon).  then my wife had a look and the check was a bit confused.... the check had tried to include 20% gratuity.

However, I ate here last night and had one of the most bizarre and infuriating service experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. I was in a group of 4, and we ordered and sat down. When our food started to arrive, I noticed that the little tin can on our table had only 2 spoons in it, no forks or knives. I was kinda surprised that the food runner hadn't noticed the lack of silverware when she started to drop off food, but whatever, it's counter service and I'm not expecting fine dining-level service. So rather than wait in the line to ask the counter people for silverware, I walked over to the bar (where no one was seated the entire time we were at the restaurant) and went to grab some forks from one of the tin cans there. But then, the food runner, who is stationed back by the kitchen, grabbed the can from my hand and asked, very rudely \\"Can I help you?\\" \\"Oh we just don't have any forks at our table.\\" She put the tin can back down on the bar and looked in the silverware holder in front of her and said, again with a very curt and rude tone \\"We are out of forks right now.\\" No \\"sorry,\\" no \\"we'll bring some forks out to you in a moment.\\" I guess she expected us to eat the saut√©ed cauliflower she just dropped off to us with our hands? I have never experienced cutlery-based gaslighting before so I incredulously said \\"we have food at our table that we can't eat because we don't have any forks and you are saying that there are forks right here that I can't use?\\" I started to say something about how we were customers at this restaurant and deserved these forks more than the hypothetical guests who may or may not sit at the bar to eat but, she relented and, rolling her eyes, in a nasty tone said one single word... \\"fine....\\" I mean, again, the food is delicious and everyone else I've interacted with here has been nice. This was just one of those WTF experiences that I felt I couldn't just let slip by without comment. The forks weren't fake news."},{"name":"Pupuseria 503 Y Mas","address":"808 Justin Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This food truck has best pupusas around. Customer service was great also.

My husband and I entered the restaurant at 9pm on Friday 8/9/19.  We were \\"greeted\\" by a young lady with long dark braids who said (when she saw us walk in) \\"Don't step in my nuts\\" with a very unpleasant look on her face.  My husband and I were unsure what she was talking about until we approached the stand and noticed she had already swept up the floor (into the path of the front door) and apparently was afraid were we're going to cause her to have to re-sweep if we stepped in the nuts by accident.  Once we realized what she was talking about and laughed off the somewhat surprised looks on our faces, we continued to wait for someone to actually greet us or ask us how many, or any one of the numerous other options there were for service people to engage with customers and welcome them.  But....nothing.  There were 3-4 other greeters walking around the area as well but it seemed we were invisible to them until one other young lady mentioned they had been very busy and, as we said we understood, she received a cell phone call and proceeded to answer it and talk for 10-15 seconds.  After her conversation, she spoke with a couple of other greeters and then took our name.  (This entire interaction lasted approximately 2-3 minutes and we were the only guests at the greeter stand). We continued to stand there for another minute thinking we were waiting on something else from them but nothing else was ever said so we gradually eased back to a bench.  We sat down for a few seconds and considered whether we should stay since we typically have good experiences at Logan's.  Ultimately, we decided to leave since we were afraid the food service might be as poor as the greater service.

In my opinion it is the bar, the chef's table. What better scenery do you have than to see a Chef prepare their food for you. As an added bonus, you also get to chat with the chef and owner, Tony Marzo and their significant other, Sachi Iwamoto about the past, present and future - How they want to take their restaurant to the next level, etc. We had the pleasure chatting with Tony, who has traveled to London for his apprenticeship and has worked for CinCin as a sous chef for a few years.\\n\\nWe were at Kessel and March restaurant hidden from the spotlight - such as the new Strathcona area, Downtown, Gastown, Commercial Drive. The restaurant itself is pretty hard to find. The signs is not nearby visible. But once you find it, it is what we call a hidden gem.\\n\\nWe got their and had a look at the dinner menu which consists of 15 items at most. It is very clear that it is tapas style where sharing applies. We first ordered three items: Tuna Tartare, Farm Terrine, and Pork Belly. As soon as the first came, we knew it wasn't going to be enough.\\n\\nTuna Tartare: It has a very sweet note, a perfect way to start. Very light, very bright. It consists of blood orange, capers and pine nuts for added texture. Not too heavy. Very subtle flavors, very clean to start off our meal.\\n\\nFarmhouse Terrine: This is one of my favorite dishes at a French restaurant. Full of flavors. This dish came with gherkins and mustard to cut out the heaviness of the terrine itself. Full of natural pork flavors. Very soft and succulent.\\n\\nPork Belly: Tony has indicated that it has been cured for 12 hours and sous vide for another 36 hours the pork. You can see the hard work being paid off. The only thing with this one, with pork belly, we wanted the skin to be crispier.\\n\\nAfter that bite sized meal, we were ready for second round: Salmon Terrine and Mussels. You can see that the meal itself isn't too large. This place is perfect for sharing.\\n\\nMussels: Light in broth (fennel, chorizo, tomato, white wine sauce). Nancy preferred a heavier, a more bisque-esque like consistency. Me on the other hand, like it the way it is. Clean flavors, taste of the chorizos like any classic mussels to be desired.\\n\\nFinally we had the SST. This dish is heavy. Heavy in taste. Smoked salmon itself in a thin layer, has a very salty tastes. To have it compacted in a terrine style, it has a very strong taste, perhaps not suited for everyone. But for me, it was just fine to end off.\\n\\n\\nWish we had enough space to finish off the meal with a dessert. The Clafoutis looked mighty endearing.

While the food was fresh and enjoyable, I experienced some major issues with the waiting staff when it was time to pay. My biggest issue was the tip. Since we were a large party, they REQUIRED us to pay a 20% tip. However, this was nowhere stated on the menu. When I brought this up, they said it was their rule and we had to abide by it. Fine, I went along with. Then, she tipped on top of tax without our consent, which should be up to our digression. The tip came out to $7.53 a person, yet our waitress rounded this value up to $8.00, which ultimately summed to an extra ~$10 for her. Their machine did not let costumers enter their own tip, so the waitress was entering what she wanted onto our receipt. For example, if a group of 6 was paying with one card, a tip of $48 would be printed on our receipt. So as a summary, here are my major problems:\\n\\n1. required 20% tip\\n2. tipping on top of tax without asking\\n3. rounding up tip from $7.53 to $8\\n4. not allowing us to write our own tip on our receipt\\n\\nPotential customers! While the food is good, PLEASE BEWARE of their abusive business practices.

Everyone was courteous and our water glasses were never more than half empty, but it took a long time for our entrees to come out, and nobody came over to check on us at all.

Beer, sausages, fresh bread and pretzels, what's not to love?  The parking gods had even smiled on me, so I knew I was in for a treat.  Nope.

Our pretzel and cheese arrived, still no beer.  Another server, realizing we had been seated for over 30 minutes without drinking a sip of beer, stepped in to help.  Apparently one of the beers we ordered had \\"keg issues\\" so  our wait continued.

Huzzah! \\n\\nWait... We've already got dinner plans. \\n\\nWell, there was only one solution to this problem: eat two dinners! Yaaayy! \\n\\nWe pulled up to Ping at 8pm, expecting a gigantic crowd of eager diners. Thankfully, this was a pretty soft open, so we got seated immediately. Once we had our butts in our seats, we had a few minutes to take in the atmosphere.  The verdict? The interior of Ping is pretty neato. High ceilings, pots and pans, old radios, and random Chinese kitsch. The seating is mostly tables with a few booths in the corners and a long bar along the cooking area. \\n\\nThe menu? Very promising. We partook of the fish ball skewers and the Chang Mai sausage. The fish balls were just the right balance of spicy and sweet, and the sausage was kick-ass. I didn't realize you could get away with lemongrass in a sausage, but apparently you can. Our dining neighbors had the pork bun and the baby octopus skewers, and both looked incredible. \\n\\nThe cocktail list here is just as varied as the food menu. The wife had a Tamarindo, a tequila based cocktail that was so good I regretted ordering a beer. I'm already looking forward to delving extensively into the cocktail selection on my next visit. \\n\\nWhen it came time for the check, our server brought a handheld credit card machine to the table, and processed that bad boy right where she stood. I know they've been doing this in Europe for years, but this is the first time I've seen this here in Portland. Crazy kids and their newfangled toys. \\n\\nGiven the stature of Pok-Pok, I'm pretty sure that Ping will make its mark on the dining scene in PDX. What I'm most interested to see is how it affects the Chinatown neighborhood. If Ping is remotely as popular as its big brother, things could get interesting. They don't take reservations, and there's no room for waiting diners inside. I can imagine a summertime scene involving late evening diners and Old Town panhandlers that doesn't end well. Let's hope some of the adjacent bars get wise and work out a deal with Ping to keep waiting guests buzzed and happy. \\n\\nTo say the least, we were impressed. The great service and innovative dishes will definitely bring us back to Ping. Now we just need the Hung Far Low sign to regain its rightful place in the neighborhood skyline.

Fresh...the best I have have. You could taste just the ingredients for their pure individual flavors.\\n\\nFirst course:\\nFried green olives stuffed with veal\\nThese were amazing. So crisp, not a bit oily...the firm tang of the olive contrasting with the rich, moist veal...mmm I thought I had a recipe for these...Olive all'Ascolana...I found it and will have to try and make now...maybe for new years.\\n\\nMain course:\\nFish Special\\nFresh Grouper in tomato broth\\nShe cleaned the plate...a rarity for this ami.\\n\\nFettucine alla Michela\\nFettuccine with fresh shrimp and scallops in a light Pernod and saffron cream sauce\\nHoly doodoo I liked this. It was not a ginormous portion...for pasta it was the most approachable of quantities. The creaminess was not heavy and rich. It was light, savory, transporting... and the saffron and Pernod gave it the most delicate escalation of flavor. The seafood was cooked perfectly: the shrimp firm and the scallops heart wrenchingly tender (and huge).\\n\\nVitello Saltimbocca\\nVeal sauted in seasoned white wine sauce, fresh sage, topped with prosciutto di parma\\nAlso a clean plate member...the birthday girl adored this, and I found it rather rich and delicious myself.\\n\\nDessert:\\nCappucino, tiramisu and a special birthday trio of desserts, including the most wonderful, moist marzipan I have ever tasted. I didn't know they made it like that.\\n\\nWine:\\nA carafe of the house red, a Montipulciano.\\n\\nNino's was a surprising delight for me. A hidden gem. It just felt different than most restaurants in Atlanta. It wasn't all sparkly. I like sparkly, but I love different, interesting and charming. I had always heard of Alfredos...a mere stone's throw from Nino's, but will happily pass on by, sight unseen, for another table at Nino's."},{"name":"Istanbul'lu","address":"237 Holland St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"The food was really good. We ordered two cold tapas (the stuffed grape leaves and the eggplant \\"salad\\") and one hot (lentils). All three were delicious, although the lentils were a bit too spicy for my taste. Presentation was beautiful, and the bread was incredible. The waitress brought more out as soon as she saw it was gone. \\n\\nFor the main course, my boyfriend got the Kofte and I got the Sultan's Delight. The Kofte was AMAZING. The spices were perfect, the meat wasn't too dry, and the flavor was superb. The side of rice, however, was sub-par and too plain. It was served with a rich, thick yogurt that was the perfect complement. The Sultan's Delight was good, as well. The lamb was tender and flavorful. The eggplant was very creamy, bordering on too creamy, but overall the dish was tasty.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered two Turkish coffees -- absolutely flawless, served in beautiful Turkish china. We also ordered baklava and a shredded filo dough with pistachios. The baklava was also made with pistachios, which I thought was strange, because I've only had with walnuts or pecans. It was a little too sweet, but the shredded filo with pistachios made up for it. The texture was amazing and it was very yummy. \\n\\nThe waitresses were warm and knowledgeable, and very eager to help. They weren't pushy at all, and let us take our time with the meal. \\n\\nThe only real complaint I have with the place is the price compared to the atmosphere. The inside of the place looks cheap and old, with ugly commercial chairs and rickety tables.

There are open mic nights, interactive shows and pretty decent food.  The cost is what you'd expect for Back Bay but for a time with that special someone or friends it's worth it.\\n\\nThe Recreation Area:\\n       Let me first say this: I love bowling and billiards.  I have loved these two activities since I was 5.  I also love drinking and hanging out with friends.  I have loved THESE two activities since about the age of 5 too.    Nonetheless this area isn't worth the time and money.  The cocktails are expensive as are the billiards hourly rates and bowling prices (shoes & games).

I'd much rather walk the extra ~4 blocks to Jillians/Lucky Strike or take a T ride to Alewife for Lanes & Games...\\n       The waitresses are overbearing, a bit pushy and snooty.  The male bartenders pay more attention to serving the young ladies than anyone else and the women bartenders seem to be simply annoyed by any customer present, forcing her to go out of her way to make a drink. \\n       If you go on a weeknight the waits aren't that bad, definitely endurable.  On a Friday or Saturday night though, they're atrocious.  I recommend going during the day while everyone is at work if you're looking to bowl.  You know what?  A better idea: go somewhere else.\\n       Additionally, this place for the most part attracts the stereotypical drunk, frat-boy crowd.  With that said: be alert and attentive when they're around.  More than 1/2 of the times I've been there a fight has broken out with the sad result of injured people and broken property.  (No wonder why the bouncers are rude.)  \\n       The music is fun with a nice mix of 80's favorites, pop, rock and hip-hop but don't be surprised if on each of your subsequent visits you hear the exact same music.\\n       Advice: if you have your own bowling ball, BRING IT!

I think I have finally found it with  Little Boston Sub.  When I saw this cart on Yelp and it's reviews  I was so excited to check it out.  Double plus that it is located in my neighborhood.   I had the Steak and Cheese with everything and it did not disappoint.  Steak was tasty with just the right amount of veggies ( peppers, onion and mushrooms) and Provolone cheese to make it a party in my mouth.  There was a hint of pepperoncini that gave it a nice zing.   Dan ( the owner) said he gets his steak from Zuppan's or New Seasons  so you know he is using quality.   Hubby had the Chicken Parm. and he said it was very good, but a bit salty. I plan to go back and try the Pastrami and Italian, if they are as good as the Steak and Cheese then I will be in heaven.   I also had Dan's filled when you order ( nice touch) Cannolis,  Molto Bene!, as good as my favorite Italian bakery in the North End with yummy milk chocolate chips at each end.   Looking forward to the Italian cookies that Dan said he may start making.  Dan gave me a sample of his Chowdah as we waited for the subs to be made: Hit the spot on a cold rainy Friday night and would be perfect to have along side one of the subs ( or half a sub, as a whole is quiet generous and bargain at $6.50)   I think the only drawback for this great little cart is that you would miss it if it was not for the sandwich board sign on the sidewalk.

However the food was a different matter.  I wouldn't say it was bad but given the rave reviews by other diners and critics, I personally didn't find it that memorable.  The following are my thoughts on the dishes we ordered:\\n\\n1)Toom Yum Goong Soup w/Prawns-Eventhough the broth was intense but it wasn't spicy at all.  I'd like to see some tomatoes and Thai ginger in there.\\n2)Fish Cakes-The colour was quite dark because they probably used old oil to fry it.  It didn't have that nice fresh springy texture to it.  My guess.....the fish were frozen and need to use fish like mackerel or some Thai fish to achieve that texture.  There wasn't much flavour to it, so really need to rely on that sweet and sour sauce to give it taste.\\n3)BBQ Beef Salad-What bbq taste?  If use the bbq or something similar it should be nicely charred on the outside and medium rare on the inside. I could taste the lemon juice in it.  Once again it wasn't spicy at all.  There was too much vinigrette in the salad and it was too salty.\\n4)BBQ duck in red curry.  It had a nice coconut flavour to it and portion was descent but nothing memorable about it.\\n5)Pad Thai the real way-It was done properly.  I could taste the tamarind in the sauce and it wasn't mushy nor greasy.  Good job!\\n6)Deep fried banana with coconut icecream-The batter for the banana was light, fluffy and it wasn't greasy.  I could taste the coconut flavour in the icecream\\n\\nTo be honest........Simply T"},{"name":"Chevys Fresh Mex","address":"12547 State Rd 535","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"This is the best (and now the only) Chevys left in central Florida.

I know I can be picky, but hear me out. \\n\\nI was told to try the \\"Beer Cheese\\" for $2, and I said \\"Yes, please!\\" She said it came with baguette or a pretzel, and I chose pretzel. Who wouldn't? The beer cheese was okay. Nothing terribly thrilling, but definitely tasty. The pretzel wasn't one of the large ones you see at most places that sell the big soft pretzels. It was about half to 2/3 that size. And it wasn't as soft as those pretzels either. It was just this size of crunchy, which isn't what I expected. \\n\\nThe sausage menu looked like I'd have loved it 10 years ago when I still ate most meat. I lamented that the chicken sausage also has pork in it. I get that you want the flavor, but it's a chicken sausage. That's what non-pork-eaters are going to order. Fortunately, there was a veggie option. It was pretty darn tasty, too. The beets gave it a nice, meaty color and the texture was great. I got it on a pretzel bun, which was more soft and flavorful than the pretzel I'd had, and the pepperonata stuff on top definitely made it. ACTUALLY, what really made it was the homemade mustard I ordered for $.50 more. No big deal. I get they want to charge for something that costs them more in product and labor than buying regular or even a gourmet mustard. I also got a side of potato salad, which had great flavor for $2. \\n\\nThe thing is, it was small. That sausage was really freakin small for the price I paid. Are your brats that small, because if I ordered one of them and something that size came out, I'd kick the sucker out of bed, yo. The serving of the potato salad was equally small (basically a large ramekin). PLUS, the beer cheese that \\"comes with baguette or pretzel\\"...doesn't.

Not only can most things be made vegetarian but they have chilaquiles!  Now, seeing these makes me want breakfast but they are equally suitable as a lunch/dinner item.  Their tacos are yummy but could definitely use a second tortilla as they started to fall apart toward the end.  Salsas are pretty tasty but could be considerably hotter for me.  Maybe they have hot and I haven't yet to experience it?  They also do the staple beans and rice (veg-friendly!) well.

I know I sure as hell couldn't. Mark has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you've always known him. He's personable, friendly and interesting. It makes for a relaxing and comfortable experience. \\n\\nSecond, he's extremely accommodating and flexible. Not many cooking schools would cater to two nerds who wanted a class that covered molecular gastronomy and Ethiopian. But for three hours on a Monday night we did just that. From chicken sous-vide to gomen wot. We also got some friendly critique on our knife skills (I'm awesome; Husband needs to work on his chiffonade) and learned how to debone a chicken. As someone who only recently began to re-ingest and cook meat, that was an extremely valuable lesson. \\n\\nFinally, the food we created with Mark was delicious. He made me love spaghetti squash. I hate spaghetti squash. (I suppose that should be in the past tense. I used to hate spaghetti squash.) The chicken we made in both the fancy sous-vide machine and in ghetto-style sous-vide on the stove top was the moistest either Husband and I can recall ever having. And the other Ethiopian dishes we made were seriously good. I ate entirely too much. And we still had left overs. So I ate entirely too much the next night for dinner too. \\n\\nIn short- I cannot recommend Mark and ArtEpicure more highly. It was a unique, fun experience I sincerely hope to do again. I see learning how to make a perfect risotto in my future."},{"name":"The Picnic House","address":"723 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The ONLY reason I can't give this place the 5th star, is the price- I felt comparatively it was about a dollar-two dollars higher than what I would normally pay.\\nThat said, the service, decor, and charming personality of the entire operation makes one forget they are paying an extra buck or two... or at least it did for me.\\nMain dish: I ordered a half salad/half soup combo. Mushroom soup, fresh berry salad. Soup was slightly bland, but very good texture- added a tiny salt and all was well. Creamy and hearty.  Salad was good size, the berries and candied nuts together made a great amount of crunch and sweet in the salad.\\n\\nDiet coke with cherry grenadine. HAND MADE, mind you! Talk about OG!\\nGrilled Pound Cake w/whipped cream and some lemon curd, dear lord- this was both dense, yet delicate and just amount of sweet to linger on my tongue and leave me skipping out of the building.\\n\\nI would eat here every day if I had the money and didn't mind the cost- I love 1920-1930's era items, and this place is adorned in them, with some history of the building as well, just ask one of the charming servers for more info.\\n\\nPrice aside, I would suggest this place for anyone at least once.

Now she has a CDC and a bunch more staff, so they now can manage the occasional vegetarian or GF eater.\\n\\nThe portion sizes have always been appropriate for a multi-course menu; Beast has never been meat-and-three, nor a place where you ate free if you finished the ridiculously large steak. It's also not the place where you eat six courses and then want a burger after. The portion sizes and amount of wine poured are just right for a well-paced two and a half hour dinner.\\n\\nThis is not the same Beast as 10 years ago, which is forever in the restaurant world.

Overall, I'm happy with the place and will return. So here's the scoop....\\n\\nThe owner did a great job at revamping the old place (was the former Turkish Steak & Salad). Think \\"Industrial meets Farmhouse. Ok, I get it. I'm diggin' it. You order like at Chipotle, are handed a number, & they bring your food to your table. \\n\\nMy friends both ordered the Butter Chicken Tacos. Quite tasty. Strong spice in the sauce... I'm thinking curry but wasn't sure... They loved it... I thought it was a bit much. Ingredients were all fresh and you could tell a lot of thought went into the \\"art\\" of this dish. Fresh jalape√±os were a nice touch as were the Pepita  seeds. I would like to try the Pork Belly Tacos next time. \\n\\nI ordered the Spicy 1/2 Roasted Chicken for $9.99. I chose grilled corn on the cob & plantains as my 2 sides. Chicken was GREAT! Moist, flavorful, cooked perfectly. Grilled Corn was yummy with parm cheese and chives. Plantains were too thick & still firm. Looked good but I didn't like the texture. Would opt for the Yuca Fries next time. Also asked for Chimichurri Sauce. Was yummy and seemed homemade. Nice touch to make a little chicken burrito with my 2 tortilla shells. Highly recommend this dish. \\n\\nThe tables nearby ordered Brisket (unfortunately there seemed to be a lot of fat in my neighbors brisket & he wasn't happy at all). Others looked like they had huge sandwiches full of various meats & those looked like they were worth trying too!\\n\\nSadly, my platter came out a good 25-30 mins after my friends, so they were done by time my food arrived. Oh well. New restaurant has to work out some flaws I guess. It was worth the wait though. \\n\\nWines and beers looked nice. I bet this would be a nice hangout after work with friends. MUSIC was way too loud!!! You already have the clink and clang of the kitchen and the place could use some noise reduction panels.... But top that off with the crazy loud music and I felt like I needed a Prosaic by time I left! Lol.... Minor tweak. \\n\\nOverall, I liked it. Immediately told 3 different people about our experience & told them they must give it a try. I'd sum up the place as :  Ribs (only at dinner) . Brisket sandwiches. Other Big sandwiches. Weird tacos. Black beans. Yuca. French fries. Mix of Four Rivers, Black Bean Deli, & Tako Chena. Yep. When you eat there, you'll understand.

My boyfriend and I were on a search for it but kept going at the wrong time... after 8pm,  on Tuesdays when they're closed, etc.  Finally, we found it on the most random strip of restaurants and retail stores in Revere.\\n\\nOur favorites that we always get are the cambodian style pad thai, special fried rice, and lort soup with shrimp.  When we go with other friends, we usually get the tiger tears, too, and everyone always loves it. Tiger tears is a steak salad with bellpeppers and crisped rice - it's very flavorful, and you get a good amount of beef for the price.  The pad thai is steamed, rather than stir fried, and it's topped with pickled cucumbers, dried radish, peanuts, and fish fluff - it's a little sweet and very flavorful.  It sits on top of boiled bean sprouts and is surrounded by hard boiled egg wedges.   The fried rice has bits of calamari, fish cake, imitation crab, shrimp, and peas in it.. I always top it with some extra white pepper powder and fish sauce... soo good!  The lort soup is a short/fat vermicelli noodle soup that's super garlicky and flavorful.\\n\\nThere are some more traditional dishes, too, which are more fishy.  They're good, but I'm a huge carb person, so I stick to our 3 favorites.\\n\\nI never get the MSG coma after eating here, so I don't think they use MSG in the dishes I order.

My mom even read about it on American Airlines' magazine once.  The family is super nice, and they're just a very honest family.  Service is always very kind.  Food doesn't come out as quickly as at most Chinese restaurants, but it's because everything is made to order, fresh, and not too greasy.

The main brewing operation is in a long warehouse, and this is where you will find the tasting room. There is another long, open-air barn style structure filled with picnic tables. There are a few other smaller bars throughout, but they weren't serving the Jester King brews as far as I could tell (I think it was just other unique drafts). There is a pizza company on site too, and plenty of open space to hang out. Apparently the line for the main tasting room takes 45+ minutes, which didn't surprise me because the line stretched out the building and down the lawn in front of the brewery. \\n\\nThere is a Bottles to Go tent near the back of the main building, and there is a separate menu for beers available to go. Most of these are 750mL bottles and there is an awesome selection from local breweries to those all across Europe. They also offer some local cider options as well as wines \\n\\nThe beers (in order of preference):\\nFirst off, Jester King brews sour beers, which are unlike anything I've ever tasted. They are very light and make you pucker like if you were eating fresh citrus. Definitely get a sample first if you haven't tried their beers before.\\n\\nRepose: This one is simply awesome; being aged for a year in brandy-soaked barrels really helps this one shine. It's caramel colored, unfiltered, and looks great in a glass. The flavor is tart and lightly sweet, and it is almost champagne-like in its crispness. The inclusion of hay in the mix gives it a very mild earth tone, but that it definitely not the overwhelming flavor. Of course, there is the nice mild sour finish that Jester King is known for. This is sure to be a crowd-pleaser and is my favorite so far.\\n\\nEquipoise: The Equipoise was Jester King's limited release from April 2015. I thought it was refreshing and tasty. It was brewed with ginger salt and tarragon, then fermented with cantaloupe, though the cantaloupe was the only flavor I could distinguish. The sour flavor is moderately strong, similar to the Repose and Ambree. I was expecting something a little more complex and unique, but at the end of the day it tasted very similar to their other offerings with some mild cantaloupe flavor. The Equipoise was OK overall, but the Repose is still my favorite.\\n\\nAmbree: this one is mildly dry and tart while being heavy on the malt. It's very smooth going down, and it's almost like a light caramel flavor sticks around after you swallow. Compared to the Repose, the Ambree is darker, has a lot more of a malt flavor, and isn't as complex. The sour finish is about the same as the other Jester King beers I've tried.\\n\\nHibernal Dichotomous: a very interesting, different, tart beer. Don't let the smell sway you from tasting it; it definitely smells funky, but the smell doesn't come through in the taste profile. The beer is a beautiful grapefruit color, and starts off with the sweetness and tartness of a grapefruit or tangerine. The finish is definitely sour, with a slight twang of bitterness. It's not a hoppy bitterness, it's more like a strong citrusy twang. This one was a very unique combination of flavors but overall very light and fruity. Not everyone I shared it with was enthusiastic about it, so this one may be more for Jester King veterans."},{"name":"Buckhead Bottle Bar & Bistro","address":"268 E Paces Ferry Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"I heard about this place thru word of mouth so I thought me and a friend would give it try.

Incredible environment. Excellent wine menu. I would love to stop in for lunch for their salads more often. My only suggestion would be to add a mustard and/or a jam/marmalade/honey or something to the charcuterie board.

It's a great, clean, fast airport filled with local eatin' and drinkin' options that are all priced the same as the restaurants' in town locations. So of course, when I hit up a Big Town Hero at PDX, I know I'm not going to get some crap version of a BTH sammich but for twice as much $$.\\n\\nI found myself at the airport on a Saturday morning at 7am hungry, incredibly tired, and in need of breakfast. Security (and this is a rare one for PDX) took forever, so I was running out of time to catch my flight (plus, I was flying Southwest, so it's a get-there-early-or-get-stuck-in-a-middle-seat kind of situation. Needless to say, I was in a hurry (as most people in the airport are) and something at least somewhat breakfasty was in order. \\n\\nAs I hustled on down to the C gates, I was presented with these otherwise decent options: Gustav's, Good Dog/Bad Dog, and some Mexican place. Oh, and there's a Wendy's and a Coffee People (coffee-shop pastry was not going to cut it this morning). As I stood there in a daze, I made the snap decision for BTH. Healthier than Wendy's, not a sausage (which is definitely not breakfasty), and not, uh, random Mexican. \\n\\nI ordered up an 8\\" veggie from the incredibly apathetic cashier. I was the only person in line. I waited quite some time for my sandwich. While it was nice that it was made fresh, it took way longer than BTH normally takes. \\n\\nThe sandwich itself? Pretty decent. Not the best ever, but it definitely hit the spot.

I successfully talked them into checking out Easy Tiger with me. \\n\\nIt was already pretty late so the restaurant was empty. They have a cute bakery upstairs and a bar and restaurant downstairs. The ambiance was casual and hip. There was an awesome looking patio also but we elected to sit inside because of the Texas heat. \\n\\nWe ordered a Texas beef board, a snack board, and a couple of more pretzels to share. The food was plenty for the four of us. The pretzels were large, warm, and so soft. Exactly what I was looking for! The beer cheese dip was fantastic and went so well with my pretzel! The sausages were excellent with pickles and yummy meaty sauce. Beef jerky was pretty good, too. I wasn't in the mood to have more drinks. The guys had whisky and let me have a sip. It was very strong. But they seemed to enjoy it a lot. \\n\\nI almost gave Easy Tiger a five star based on the great food we had but the service was a bit problematic. \\n\\nSo here is the story. I got a glass of water after sitting down and the glass was chipped. I asked the waitress to bring me a new glass because I was not gonna drink my water from a broken glass. Apparently she wasn't happy about it. Then she unwillingly brought me a new glass of water, put it down heavily on the table, and stormed out. Wow, I wasn't in the mood for that kind of attitude! I let it slide because I was having a good time. Otherwise you'd call me easy tiger! \\n\\nOverall a very satisfying visit. It was already 1:30am when we left.

I judge BBQ by the ribs and brisket. Many places will have great sides and okay/decent proteins or vice versa. We tried their pulled chicken, ribs and brisket served with collard greens, smoky Mac and cheese, potato salad and baked beans. The brisket is the star hands down. Smoked for 14 hours, it was glistening when she cut into it and it literally melted in your mouth. Slightly seasoned which was perfect to taste the quality of the meat. They have their own BBQ sauces. The hot was a black pepper and sweet combo. Their Fuel house sauce was amazing with tomato and sweet peppers with a vinegar tanginess. This was my favorite. The ribs were high quality with a great balance of fat and meat. Perfectly cooked and juicy. All the sides were delicious. Collard greens still had a hearty texture to them (they could've have been mustard greens) with a flavorful smoky broth. Mac and cheese were made with a white and yellow cheddar which made it very creamy. The baked beans had pulled pork in it and the sauce was sweet and thick. Potato salad was a mustard base and was just okay. Much better than 4R, Bubbalous, Sonny's etc. Oh and they are connected to a nice sports bar next door and have an amazing outdoor space. Worth the Friday night drive."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Absolutely delicious ice cream.  The rotating monthly flavors have me coming in at least twice a month to try the exciting new concoctions.  A bit pricey but it's totally worth it.  *Not* worth waiting in line two hours for as can often be the case, but the trick is to go during slow times to get your ice cream fix.  I give 4 stars and not 5 because service, while exceedingly friendly,  is insanely slow.  The line needs to be moved along much much faster.

The place is packed and the Saints fan energy is really high for the entire game (and usually an hour and a half before the game starts). The crawfish etoufee is really good, and I also really like the Cajun Gumbo. I like this Gumbo more than Genes and more than Sambets. They have a good burger if you just want a burger instead of the Gumbo or etoufee. The crawfish poboy is excellent. \\n\\nThe negatives:\\nThe portions are kind of small for what they charge, especially in their seafood baskets and plates. They have also recently increased their prices. The secret is to get what they have on special that day. You can get a good chicken fried steak for cheap Sunday evenings. The roast beef poboy is too dry, and I don't recommend it at all. Genes clearly has them beat in the roast beef poboy competition.\\n\\nI like Shaol Creek and I will keep going, but I do wish they would lower some of the prices, or increase the portion sizes."},{"name":"Beijing On the Common","address":"62 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This is place is average.

This French caf√© was directly across from my hotel, the Marriott City Center. I walked over and glanced at the menu. They have many delicious looking desserts and pastries but that didn't line up with my healthy plan. I looked over in the refrigerator and found premade salads and sandwiches that looked good. I decided to go for the Nicoise Albacore salad. On a bed of lettuce there was tuna, green beans, French style potato salad, and a few other vegetables that looked good with a light dressing. The people working there did not seem happy at all and did not greet me with any kind of positive energy. As you know, I'm a customer service enthusiast, and this was not a happy bunch. The price was reasonable and the entire experience was very quick. This place would be very difficult to find parking as it is saturated in the middle of downtown. Overall, I would skip this place, the salad was not great, possibly because it had been sitting in that fridge all day. If it wasn't for the convenience of the location, I probably would've skipped this place myself. There is so much great eating in Portland, I would go elsewhere."},{"name":"Eat Me Speak Me","address":"340 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"4.5","text":"Just finished my meal here.

I've had several sandwiches back home in Jackson with almost the exact same ingredients (hot chicken, pickles, Cole slaw).  I could eat that combo over and over again!  That being said, the first Tavern sandwich was kind of boring.  Plain yellow cheese, raw onions, old, burnt bacon on it.  Supposedly came with mustard but the whole thing screamed dry.  As far as the hot chicken sandwich, it fell flat for me too.  Just lacked flavor.  Don't get me wrong, it was extremely hot!  The spice was a plus.  The spicy sauce also kept it juicy unlike the Tavern.  But in comparison to similar sandwiches I've had, you have to bring the spice and the flavor.

It's not often I encounter such a discrepancy between Yelp reviews and my experience at a business. It does happen, but it's damn rare. \\n\\nHere is one such case. \\n\\nClutch Prime Sausagery is in an incredibly inconvenient location to my home, but I made the trip out anyway. Would I drive over here every day? Not for anything. But I'll definitely be back for some of these amazing flavors from time to time.\\n\\nI sampled the kimchi dog with lime togarashi aioli, sesame and seaweed atop shaved brussels with parmesan, lemon zest and hazelnuts ($14) and it was good. Really good. The dog has a deep, complex flavor that's seriously enhanced by the aioli and kimchi on top. A meat + greens option that, for the price is filling and has the added benefit of being lower carb. I also sampled the hot smoked rib dog with pork rinds, crunchy slaw and smoked habanero barbecue sauce ($10). When ordered as a dog, it comes on a Pearl Bakery hot dog bun and is piled with the listed toppings. My dining companion scored the pad thai dog atop the shaved kale with farro, beets and cr√®me fra√Æche ($14). Of the three dogs, this was my least favorite, but that's a misleading word, because I still liked it a lot. I was simply pretty blown away by the kimchi and hot smoked rib dogs. \\n\\nBoth my dining companion and I were wowed by the flavors. The balance of sauce/toppings and fillings made for a great taste experience. Casing is nice (more like a sausage) but the size is more like a smaller sausage or dog. IMHO, the best way to go about ordering here is to get some greens and add a link. Those little boxes of salad are stuffed full of greens, and it's a more economic way to eat your tasty dogs. Plus it's better for you.\\n\\nI rarely mention other reviews in my Yelp reviews but I will here. I admit that my main concern about Clutch is the price (as others have mentioned). The dogs by themselves are not large, and you get no sides, and at $9 or $10 that's maybe a little steep. I can see how someone on lunch would be in a pickle having to add on chips and a drink and bring the price up to what, for me, would run over my lunch per diem. However in this case I do think that they're offering something special here. I am willing to pay more for locally sourced and responsible meats, especially when it comes to sausage (which traditionally contains the worst of the worst processed meats - lips and assholes anyone?!). Also I think the key here is to know how to order. You get a lot of food all of a sudden when you add a dog on to greens, and the price is not that much more than the solo dog. Plus, less carbs are better for you. \\n\\nAnyway, soapbox over. I really dig this place. I might normally drop 4-stars because of the price (I'll agree that $9 or $10 is more palatable when it comes with a side) but man, there's a lot of hate here and I think these guys deserve extra props for bringing real, non-industrialized, chef-powered food out west of the hills. I won't eat $1.50 costco dogs because I don't want lips, assholes and nitrates. I'll pay more for the meat that won't kill me any day. \\n\\nGive Clutch a try. Keep an open mind. Know what you're going in for. Not giant, gut-busting dogs, but interesting, high-quality creations."},{"name":"Pei Wei","address":"2501 W Osceola Pkwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3","text":"I love Pie Wei, but as of lately there customer service isn't up to par.

As we sat down the booth was full of crumbs and under the table we were stepping on a couple pieces of chicken nuggets. Anyway, the waitress (Haley D) brought us chips and salsa she asked if we wanted drinks ( just like that). No introduction, no welcome to Chuy's. We ordered our drinks and she turned to walk away, I asked if we could get a guacamole. When she came back she had our drinks and guacamole.

I wanted the creamy jalape√±o sauce. \\nShe brought my son and I a refill on our drinks and dropped off a ranch (looking and tasting) sauce. \\nShe brought the food out and I confirmed this is the jalape√±o sauce she said yes.

She told me some and then said I really don't know without a menu here. She mentioned a green Chile one so I asked if I could try that. She brought it out quickly. Toward the end of our meal she took and plate and my son asked for a refill which she brought one for me too.

The gnocco fritto was nothing mindblowing but tasted like a good deep fried donut.\\n\\n-Brioche (4/5): this went well with the board but first batch didn't come out\\n\\n-NEW YORK STRIPLOIN 10oz (4.5/5): The steak was A-mazing! I still think about it. So I gotta go back one of these days. What didn't make it for me was the chimmichuri sauce. It tasted a bit off. Not sure what though.\\n\\n-VIETNAMESE COFFEE PARFAIT (3.5/5): Very interesting on paper but it tasted too chocolatey for me. I only liked the coffee jellies. I'd totally love if they had a dessert that's made of just those jellies.\\n\\n- VANILLA CHEESECAKE (4/5): Very nicely presented with a raspberry center. The cheesecake is very light.

Justify it however you like, this is not a good look. The sides: mac and cheese was awful, congealed and tiny portion to boot, beans were either canned or just murdered, potato salad wasn't seasoned, corn bread (corn cake style) was like saw dust, and the chips were stale. To their credit the sauces were quite nice but I suspect they are just doctored some bottle sauce. The total was nearly 30 bucks, which is nothing for transcendent bbq, this was not that.

Aside from the fact that they are thoughtful enough to leave a place for a tip when you buy TOKENS with your credit card, it gets better. Look carefully at our receipt. Beneath the total, they have automatically calculated what your suggested tip should be by percentage. Except it's conveniently wrong. For those mathematically challenged kids out there (me included), to find a fifteen percent tip, you simply go to your handy calculator ap and multiply your total by .15\\n\\nThey are already assuming they have exceeded the standard 15 percent, so they just start at 16. So our $26.74 bill x .16 would be $4.28. According to them, it's $6.07. Huh. 26.74 x .18 is $4.81. They say it should be $6.83. Nope. 20% tip should be $5.35, but they say $7.59. I just had an appetizer and a really bad drink. What if we had stayed for dinner and had a $100 bill, let's say? If you followed their tipping methods, you'd be paying $28 for a 20% tip.  How many people have had a couple drinks or were in a hurry and didn't catch it? \\nNow let's talk about the drinks. The fact that there was a bar was the only thing that convinced me to go into that overstimulation hellhole. Whatever you order is served in the same weird small glasses. I really didn't want a drink with fruit and a sparkler in it, so I decided to just get a top shelf margarita. Let me just tell you--if it's not one of their bullshit fruity cocktails, they do not know how to make it. I hate sending stuff back. I don't want to feel like the \\"can I speak to a manager\\" lady. I had to send it back. It was like rubbing alcohol. Drink #2 was undrinkable so I just left it there. My daughter ordered a drink from the bar on her own, came back, and said \\"God! Taste this! It's so bad!\\" I said no thanks. \\nSo, when I figured out the math situation on the receipt, I did ask to talk to the manager. Very nice lady. Did not seem surprised at all but said she'd talk to someone. She agreed the drinks were terrible and suggested I just order wine so they couldn't mess it up. \\n\\nI gave them two stars because the appetizer was decent and my kids had fun for an hour. But guess what D and B? We won't be back. For as much money as you spend in that hour, we can do a ton of other more interesting things.\\n\\nUpdate: This place cares so much about our \\"experiences\\" that they rotate the same three or four replies for every bad review and tells us to call someone else.

After one server pointed out that she was 'with the cute guy over there', she was allowed to use the restroom, but would not let her take her bag with her.\\n\\nShame on those servers for not treating my mother with more respect and shame on them for their UNPROFESSIONAL attitudes. As a former restaurant manager, I am embarassed and saddened.

It's such a great place to meet up with friends to have some wine or coffee after work. This is Jaho's 4th store in the Massachusetts area and I am so happy that they are expanding. The coffee and food stays consistent every time I visit the Back Bay or the Chinatown store. \\n\\nI love getting lattes here because they have unique drinks that most coffee shops don't normally have. For instance, one of my favorite drinks is the iced Hanoi, which is their take on Vietnamese coffee. It's not the same as what you would find at a Vietnamese restaurant or cafe, but it's sweet, creamy, and definitely gives you the same kick to start off your day. Another one of my favorites is the cinnamon bliss latte and the french toast latte. As you can tell, I just have a sweet tooth. But one thing that blows me away every time I visit are the alternative milks that they offer. Being lactose intolerant, I love how they offer so many different kinds! I also love the teas here! They have both tea bags and loose leaf teas which are both amazing! If you get the chance, definitely try out the zodiac teas as well.\\n\\nThey're sandwiches are also amazing! One of my favorites is the Cubano sandwich. I love how they make most things in house, such as the pulled pork, the sauce, and the picked vegetables. Delicious! You can definitely tell that Jaho puts in a lot of time and effort into many things that they serve here. \\n\\nNow, onto the alcohol. I love that they offer a good amount of canned/ bottled beers, wines, and beers on tap. They also offer flights, so it's great for those who enjoy trying different things! \\n\\nI love this store especially because it's close by the shopping areas and the look of this newer Jaho is aesthetically pleasing. There are options to study at with booths, high tops, or just regular cafe tables, and options to drink at the bar as well! Jaho brings the best of both worlds with alcohol and coffee. They also have a point system, and you get $2 off after 10 points! They also offer birthday rewards, so this spot is definitely worth for frequent coffee drinkers!

Smaller portions, but still plenty of food for under $20.   Not a fan of deep dish pizza and thought Uno could change my mind. Eh, still don't like it--not a fan of tomato sauce overload on my pizza.  Although the crust was good, sausage on it was minimal. The chicken milano was pretty good.

The volcano roll did not have any scallop on top as listed. It was pretty much a California roll with some imitation crab rolled around in some spicy mayo and tempura flakes. The spider roll was ok too. They load up the rolls with lots of veggie but not a lot of fish. In addition, the avocado is not fresh. The pieces of avocado had lots of brown spots. One piece was even black and spoiled. Bleh. You also don't get good consistency. The makis are cut to all different thicknesses. Some rolls come with 4 pieces, some with 5, some with more. It was hard to tell which you were getting. We also got the tuna tataki appetizer. It looked disgusting!! It was not tataki thin like it should be. It was literally nigiri fish put on a plate and doused with sauce and sopping wet tempura flakes and orange zest and black pepper. It was horrible.

We both ordered Reggie's with French fries and Shitake Mushroom Gravy and she ordered some biscuits to go. The fries with gravy were superb: crispy and piping hot, hot enough to mask the off temperature gravy. The gravy was delicious but a little cold. It did not bode well for the biscuits which honestly were not very good. On top of the cold gravy the biscuits were less than fresh and our chicken patties were suspiciously uniform, something you might expect at a Denny's. This is very disappointing. So many times I have seen a restaurant start with a lot of zeal and excellence only to decline when they try to expand. Somehow it is hard to transfer the zeal to the new joints and even the whole organization gets contaminated sometimes.

I went back a few days later to take them up on their offer to replace the unsatisfactory shrimp biryani and ordered the chicken biryani and naan.

If you look on social media a few years ago, you couldn't scroll far down your feed without seeing someone post about their avocado toast. And while no longer at the height of popularity, it's still common enough to see people posting pics of their favourite gram worthy dish.\\n\\nBut avocado toast has actually been around for a long while. In San Francisco, people have been enjoying avocado on toast since at least 1885. It wasn't until Gwyneth Paltrow included it in her 2013 cookbook, however, that it really took off among the hipsters and millennials .\\n\\nNemesis Coffee has been on my radar for a while as one of the prettiest avocado toasts in the city. Now, I'm not just in it for the looks... I do really enjoy avocado and toast on their own... throw on a soft boiled egg in the mix and I'm in heaven. Located next to Victory Square on East Hastings, Nemesis is one of the many shops taking up roots in the gentrifying downtown east side.\\n\\nOn this visit, I ordered a Pistachio Cream Kouign-Amann ($4.25) which is a type of round, crusty cake that has layers of butter and sugar folded in. The butter puffs up the dough while the sugar caramelizes leaving a soft interior while the exterior becomes dense, chewy, slightly sweet, and crisp. The pistachio cream on the top forms a bit of a crumble-like topping.\\n\\nWhile I'm not much of a coffee drinker, I decided to order a Latte ($4.50). This is pretty much the least-coffee tasting \\"coffee\\" drink that you can order. As for my main, I went with the Avocado Toast with Poached Egg ($10 + $2) - as if there was any doubt to what I was going to order.\\n\\nThey smash up their avocado and pair it with ricotta cheese, cilantro and maple syrup. Isn't this just a thing of beauty? A perfectly poached egg with a runny yolk that spills onto the plate - what more can you ask for? The toast had a substantial crust that was difficult to cut through and gave you a satisfying crunch when you bit into it. It's actually quite a large slice of toast and soaked up all of that delicious yolk.\\n\\nIt was fairly busy here when I visited in the morning but service was friendly. They'll give you a number for your order and deliver it to you and they'll clear away your dishes after you're done. If I lived or worked closer to Nemesis, I'd be sure to spend a lot more time here."},{"name":"Ping","address":"102 NW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Growing up in a place that has lots of great Japanese infused cuisine (Chicago), I was happy to see Ping's unique take on the skewers.

Meats smoked in house, brats made in house, mustard made in house, bread made in house.  The pretzels are great.  Some people complain about how the pretzels are not warm and gooey like other places, but that's not how ET is.  They make pretzels and they hang up all day, like a real pretzel.  I love the beer cheese, it's fucking delish, what else can I say.  I love the turkey sandwich.  It has a TON on turkey with avocado and their garlic mayo and whatever else they throw on there. I don't feel like describing it all, it's just the BOMB!  The food here has just all around been great and everything I expect.\\n\\nI would give this place 4 stars because they have not always lived up to the same standards as when I first started going, but the service has always remained friendly and consistent, and I find my self coming back here all the time because I just cannot stay away, so they get to keep the extra star just for that.\\n\\nPeace and love to ET"},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a fantastic seafood restaurant in the heart of downtown Salem, located in the historic Lyceum Hall.

I decided to try this place based on some recommendations. This place is different in that you order off a menu with pictures instead of the usual push-carts. \\n\\nThe first thing I noticed when I got inside was how plain and boring the restaurant looked inside. It's like they barely tried to make it look like an Asian restaurant with very minimal decorations. They also only have one bathroom and it's the typical dirty/small Chinatown kind.\\n\\nThe Food:  We enjoyed the Jade Pearl Dumpling, Pan Fried Turnip Cake, Steamed Shrimp and Chives Dumpling, and the Steamed House Mini Pork Buns.  The Jade Pearl Dumpling was soft and honestly pretty good. The Turnip Cake was about standard quality for dim sum. The Steamed Shrimp and Chives was delicious because I like Chive and it was well made. The Mini Pork Buns were essentially Mini Xiao Long Bao with about 8 pieces that was nice for the quantity, but about average for taste. \\nThe bread and butter of dim sum, Ha Gow and Shai Mai were painful small and easily broke apart when picked up, which was not a good sign. The share ribs were ok, but the problem was the very small portion that it came out, which was about half of normal. The Chinese Beef Meatball was lackluster in flavor and a chore to eat.  \\n\\nThe Service: The servers and hostess weren't very attentive. I had to be aggressive to get dishes removed and I initially had to ask twice before I finally got seated. I never got welcomed or greeted by anyone. The only positive is that the food came out in a timely matter and they were quick about taking my orders.\\n\\nOverall, a lot of the food here was very average or below. For a place that states that everything is made to order, most of the food we got was lukewarm temperature and not much better or fresher than a push-cart place. They need to improve on their customer service, temperature and quality of their food, and would probably benefit from a renovation or redecoration.\\n\\nMaybe I came on an off day, but I'll pass on Winsor Caf√© and go to other dim sum restaurants nearby that are more enjoyable and have better quality food."},{"name":"Chicken Guy!","address":"1506 E Buena Vista Dr, Ste A","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is aptly named \\"Chicken Guy!\\" for a reason.

Turner's has been a local family business which proudly stayed that way from generation to generation and their fishing headquarters are currently based out the oldest seaport in America in Gloucester, Mass. The menu even states exactly where the fresh fish comes from. \\n\\nWe got lucky just walking in around 8pm on a Saturday the week before Halloween and not having a wait at all. I'm not sure that's the norm so, go ahead and make reservations first. (They're on Open Table!) They hostess and who believe was an owner greeted us warmly and sat us immediately. They gave the kiddos Wikki Sticks which they live and a children's menu complete with standard kid's fare as well as healthier options and fruit too. My little foodies opted to choose from the regular menu and foibles to their soup, salad and baked Mac in seconds. Turner's was very welcoming to children and families. \\n\\nTurner's offers all of your New England favorites and the appropriate classic accompaniments... Chowdah, Lobstah, any way you could possible think of, cod cakes, bisque, bakes, bouillons and all sorts of fried goodness. The menu has some more unique items such as tuna and salmon burgers, a variety of muscles, a plethora of pastas, an entire raw bar, even sashimi and teriyaki, Szechuan, Mexican and Portuguese inspired dishes also. They cater to gluten free patrons and there are some vegetarian options. Vegans, stick to sides and salads and you'll be fine. Something I found interesting on the menu was the option to add lobster or crab chunks to many different items including soups and their signature baked Mac and Cheese (which is a great option for the Little's by the way). \\n\\nThey have a lovely, reasonably priced wine selection and cellar as well as a complete cocktail menu. \\n\\nI really enjoyed the decor and vibes here in this historic building.

Salt and Straw definitely has the buzz of the moment, and you'll know it if you come on a weekend evening - especially when the weather is as unseasonably wonderful as it has been in October of 2012.\\n\\nIs it worth the wait in line? Sure, if you're really jonesing for some ice cream. There are other ice cream places in town with smaller or no lines, so choose your time wisely.\\n\\nThe store itself is cheerfully minimalist, with a trestle table and benches, and the serving counter dominating the room. The menu of constant flavors plus seasonal flavors is clearly visible from most anywhere in line once you get inside the door, and the staff is friendly and efficient, patient with you even if you decide to taste every dang flavor in the place.\\n\\nAs for the flavors themselves, well, Salt & Straw definitely caters to the foodie gourmands. Their chef's flavors - created in partnership with local restaurants like Beast - feature truly outlandish combinations, including cheeses and foie gras (among others). Lavender, Olive Oil, Goat Cheese, Caramel, spice, and more are all fair game. I don't have the list memorized, but rest assured you will be able to taste at least two flavors you never could have conceived before you walked in the door. The Spicy Monkey Caramel is a flavor I really loved. Their Oregon Bounty (Featuring a variety of ingredients all from our state) did well on the tasting spoon, but a scoop of it proved to be too much.\\nThe abundance of out-there flavors can be a negative for me, as there are generally fewer than four flavors I would conceivably order at Salt and Straw. Every person's different, though: some want their ice cream flavors to be a little less adventurous, while others really appreciate the experimentation.\\n\\nOnce served, the ice cream itself is delicious but can be on the \\"icy\\" end of the spectrum versus my preference, the \\"creamy\\" end. My first visit, I was surprised to find that the consistency of the product was closer to Ice Milk, a \\"treat\\" I recalled with dismay from a faddish period of the late '80s.\\nThat said, on my last visit, the ice cream was wonderfully creamy and quite delicious, so maybe they've solved the ice problem.  I can't say for sure.\\n\\nI also can't comment on the quality of their cones, as I never get cones; I always get a cup. They certainly smell delicious when cooking, though, so I can't imagine they're anything short of delicious.\\n\\nBottom Line: The myriad flavors can turn some people off, while it is the draw for others. When the ice cream is creamy in texture, it's in my top 3 local shops. You have to go at least once."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Food and service was amazing! We dined outside.

Almost immediately our order arrives (pre-cooked and then rolled in sauce of our choosing) with our side salads which were decent sized, but similar to what you might get at a hospital cafeteria - slice of tomato, a few croutons, a bowl full of lettuce.  Visually I was concerned - the wings looked just like the pathetic ones they have at the supposed to be hot case at your local mini market.\\n\\nThe boneless ones were super small pieces of chicken hidden under an inch of deep fried batter.  The traditional style wings were skinny on the meat as well. Both of them were dry and sort of warm.  I ate 1 of the boneless and 2 of the traditional and said fuck it on eating the rest - what was the point?  I could just as easily bought a bag of the Tyson's frozen crap and I wouldn't have been able to tell the diff.  \\n\\nIt seems pointless to discuss the variety of sauces they can roll your dry cold chicken limbs in when the problem is the chicken, not the sauce.

The chicken taco was pretty good mainly because of the kale slaw. When I told my sever I didn't order beans on my taco and that I didn't really like it he apologized but didn't attempt to rectify it. I let it go and picked the beans off which didn't help. My friend had a margarita which she liked but wasn't wow'd. I loved the chips they were just the right amount of salty and weren't too thin.

Weird to me because I would think he would know the difference between a steak cooked medium/rare and medium well. He took the steak back without issue and another steak comes out fairly fast.

We both had zero drink left besides water and that was almost gone so didnt get a chance to take advantage of happy hour.

Maybe that's why I found the Butcher Shop to be fine, but not at the same level when compared to the other experiences.\\n\\nThe place is small, and basically you are seated at the counter or other high tables by the windows. There is a HUGE butcher block table which they do partially use for butchering meat that can be bought to to cook at home, so it is an actual butcher shop, but a good portion is actually used for patrons as well.\\n\\nArriving right at 4:30 we had to wait a bit since they were still writing up the menu on butcher paper, cute. The drink list is limited to only wine, but the wine menu is several pages. If you want a cocktail you're out of luck.\\n\\nWe started with the steak tartare, of course, and a homemade pasta dish with three varieties of mushrooms. The tartare was seasoned well and had a nice consistency. The pasta was el dente and mushrooms very tasty, which says alot since I'm not a big mushroom fan.\\n\\nFor main courses we had the pork chop and lamb. Pork chop was a large piece, about 1.5 inches thick, with a warm sauerkraut side. It was sitting in a sauce that had a very nice flavor to it. The lamb was a loin cut, again a generous portion, and was rare. It was a little bit tough to cut through, but it was not all chewy when eaten. A bit overly salted, and did lack the lamb taste I enjoy. the side was cornmeal bread, fairly bland.\\n\\nWe shared a dessert, chocolate mousse, which was very rich, more like a fudge rather than the light whipped up variety, which I very much appreciated!\\n\\nService was at first non-attentive, but then again we arrived as soon as they opened. Once they were warmed up, service was excellent, didn't hurry us and answered our questions concerning cuts of meat, etc. \\n\\nTo wrap up, Butcher Shop reminded me of other quaint South End eateries, which is not a bad thing, it just didn't standout from the rest, Unlike Menton and No.9.

The naan was okay, but the garlic was no where to be found. There were a little bit of dry crispy garlic bits, but they were hardly palatable. The texture was also a bit different than I'm used to; it tasted similar to those bubbles you get in pizza crust. I don't think that's the norm, but I also haven't had a ton of Indian food.

I asked for butter again, because the cornbread was toasted possibly and did not come with any butter, but they were packed and there were only a few waiters on that I could see so I think he forgot and it took one more request to finally get the butter, he apologized for forgetting which was nice. That was my only complaint though, no butter and cornbread I wanted to eat, and I definitely was distracted until I got the butter.

Watch the cooks work their magic. It's a little more upscale than a no frills full BBQ joint in the South or Midwest, where you leave smelling like the hog they smoked, but you came to eat, and you did, and it is done.\\n\\nNo smoked BBQ smell here. Maybe because they don't seem to have a smoker. Getting ahead of myself.\\n\\nThis place is only a couple weeks old, and the manager, owner, and waitstaff seemed to be quite attentive and eager to please on the weekend. The waiters don't quite have all their words down yet, but hey, it's new. It's okay. Southern as in wood grain interior with Edison lighting and gigantic Mason jar pitchers of beverages brought to the table, and a ginormous bourbon / whiskey menu complete with flights of infusions (and beer and wine for you strange non-whiskey folks). If you're vegetarian, you're nearly SOL -- there's only one vegetarian main entree, and the fried okra starter is vegetarian, and that's about it. Pork rinds and bacon and all the meat things are all over the menu -- because this is Southern style, unabashedly whole hog if you will.\\n\\nTheir fried chicken bucket is extremely generously sized -- a friend and I shared the bucket and the ribs and collard greens and the bayou tacos (they have alligator. Just sayin.' Three mini tacos with garnishes and veggies. ) and um, we took half the ribs and chicken home and yours truly is polishing off the leftovers for lunch as we speak. Yours truly is a gigantic eater and my friend definitely also holds his own. The chicken was perfect -- crispy, battered skin, delightfully moist meat, peppered and hot out of the fryer with three enormous, skillet browned buttermilk biscuits (which I suspect may be Pillsbury or a close cousin). Nonetheless delicious. The collard greens side was small, sauteed, done in the Southern fashion with vinegar and sugar and cooked down to a little pile, accompanied with the salt of bacon. Pretty good. \\n\\nThe ribs were moist but not fall off the bone, not smoked, reasonable for Boston but would not hold their own versus my favorite BBQ joints in the Midwest (which I hold as a comparison). Four sauces were provided -- one had a buttermilk base, there was a runny sauce, a thicker BBQ sauce, and one last one that I can't recall; they were good but not remarkable.\\n\\nThe general food presentation was gorgeous. Our next table neighbors got the deviled eggs (with fixins') and dare I say that the eggs were the most beautiful deviled eggs I'd ever seen.\\n\\nThe flights of infused bourbon were also smooth and flavorful. The vanilla porter was my favorite, but I am a fan of the dark. Bourbon and vanilla love each other; some of the best vanilla extract is done from a bourbon base.\\n\\nSince I liked this place so much, I returned with my roommates, asking for more. We had the fried okra which was expertly lightly battered and fried with slivers of spring onions with (presumably the Southern buttermilk ranch sauce) as a base, and a tad of heat. \\n\\nMy roommates also had the old fashioneds, which were generous on the bourbon and with a gigantic fried pork rind on a toothpick on top; we Northerners didn't find the latter item necessary but so it goes. Pig, more pig.\\n\\nI came back for the Frogmore stew, which involved several choice offerings of tender (cocktail-tender) shrimp, flavorful sausage, fresh perfectly cooked (not mushy) okra, and mussels in a small amount of savory broth with an expertly prepared (as good as my own homemade :) cornbread wedge which was then brought back to the skillet to fry up the top and bottom. Crispy, moist, and with corn bits. As it should be!\\n\\nMy roommates had the shrimp and grits and the chicken and waffles. The chicken and waffles looked like it had nearly a whole battered chicken in parts on an enormous waffle with syrup and savory sauce. Both roommates were floored by their entrees, and said that they were the best meals they had eaten in a long time. It also doesn't hurt that we live a stone's throw from Assembly, and that as a much desired alternative to the largely chain (but sometimes reasonable) offerings in Assembly Row, that this place fits the moderate (mid-20s to 30s) price range but also delivers in spades.\\n\\nAlso, given the recent warm weather (happy second day of summer!), the place is air conditioned with gigantic floor to ceiling windows that open for that wonderful modern open air feel. Bar stools on the sides to capture this. Yesss.\\n\\nWe rolled back home in happy food coma, soon to return. Maybe not before hitting the gym first. \\n\\nSoon, soon....\\n\\nCons:\\nI don't really have any. I am happy to see that there isn't a line out the door yet.

The taco came first and as soon as my first bite, the meat was so tough and had a hard time chewing it. The pork belly was flavorless, was a bit cold considering that it was \\"fried\\" according to the server and I had to use my fork and knife to cut through the meat of the TACO. It was a disaster and ended up not eating it. \\n\\nThe second item I ordered was the chilequiles in green salsa with chicken. It was decent in my opinion and the portion was quite big. The only thing I did not like was it was drenched in sauce that I ended up not finishing it as well. \\n\\nOverall, it was quite dissapointing as it was my first meal here in Georgia and should have stuck with my rule to not go to restaurants with less than 4 star reviews the bagel place down the street would prolly be a better choice for brunch."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Always loved this place.

Much like Tikkaway seems to have not consulted a single Indian person in the conception of its menu, Southern Kin's cuisine seems to have been constructed by someone who's seen southern delights solely on Instagram. The most powerfully flavored thing between the entrees my friend and I shared was the maple syrup on the chicken and waffles. Their idea of 'spicy' was a bastardized Tabasco flavor, with all heat and no depth. I've seen a lot of reviews focusing on the whiskey selection and cocktails, but there are plenty of awesome cocktail options in Boston, and food should be the focus of a sit-down restaurant review.  \\nIt makes perfect sense that these overpriced franchises are are popping up in heavily gentrified neighborhoods, as they cater to not specifically to northerners, but embodiment of the white upper-middle-class Connecticut ranch-owning type of northerner. \\"Ooh, SOUTHERN FOOD! How exotic!\\", they might say, as they peruse the menu with lists of ingredients designed to confuse them into being impressed. The kind of person who might think Assembly Square is a hip place to live, and not a plasticky neighborhood that an 11 year old designed in Minecraft.\\nThe reason this rating is not a 1 is because our server was friendly and prompt and the drinks, although not special by Boston standards, got me through the meal. Sweet Cheeks and Smoke Shop are viable alternatives that are significantly cheaper. I regrettably have not had the chance to try Buttermilk and Bourbon yet at the time of this review.

There wasn't anywhere to sit so we grabbed our drinks at the bar and headed to the back patio to hangout.  Not too longer after, we found a place to sit at the communal picnic benches in the enclosed area.  It was easy to strike up conversations with people when you are sharing a table.  Love the chill atmosphere and vegetarian/vegan friendly menu.  Had a couple mason jar drinks and snacked on some chips and salsa--the next thing I know, the back patio was closing because it was 10pm and we ended up staying there for almost three hours talking to random people.

A good mix of rings and tentacles, we ate almost the whole thing but wanted to save room for our main courses. \\n\\nsilly us though, we \\"saved room\\" but at the end of dinner we all had leftovers for days. The portions are more than generous especially for the fair prices. I got the Veal Chop Parm special with some homemade linguini pasta. Amazing. The best veal Parm I've ever had. The sauce is not overly intrusive, leaving plenty of crisp on the veal. Sometimes the meat can soak in the sauce and become too soggy, but not at Rinos. A perfect blend of flavor, sauce, and crisp.

During that decade, my wife did not care for wings at all and usually ordered a chicken sandwich or something if she ever tagged along with me on a wing eating binge. Last year, I finally hit the end of my love affair and moved on to other options. The cost of eating at BWW surpassed my tipping point. They did away with the Tuesday discount and the quality of their product degraded a bit. The only discount that you really see is an occasional deal on their awful boneless wings, which are really just over-breaded chicken nuggets. \\n\\nOf course, this was about the time that my wife tried their salt and vinegar flavor and suddenly started loving wings. Honestly, that's my favorite flavor there as well but they come over-cooked, under seasoned and with broken bones, which are kind of off-putting, more often than not. These complaints aren't specific to this location but to all the BWWs I've dined at during the last year. I've just stopped eating there and gone back to the Wing Dome, which has the best standard Buffalo Wing on the planet and a few other epic flavors but unfortunately, no salt and vinegar flavor. \\n\\nI don't really have any complaints specific to this location other than the global issues listed above. The service was fast and friendly, the restaurant was clean and so on and so forth. The prices sucked but that's a corporate issue.

I love seeing the staff prepare the next plate and I don't even mind the communal seating. One of the dishes that came out was a chicken and morel mushrooms wrapped in bacon, you take a bite and it stops you in your tracks. That's how good everything is that comes out. I love this place and would recommend it to anyone. Remember to rsvp because they do get booked. \\n\\nBrunch update:\\nI just don't have anything bad to say about Beast. I thoroughly enjoyed every plate. They just do things right and their service is on point.  We sat at the chefs table this time which was totally fine because a. We basically have our own table, b. We get to watch the makings of each dish, and c. We got served first. The first course was a cherry clafoutis with candied bacon.

I took my husband here with my daughter to celebrate his birthday and unfortunately did not have a good experience.  We made a reservation through open table and the restaurant put us down as a no show because we were 17 minutes late even though the reservation says that the reservation would be held for 20 minutes past the reserved time.  I had reserved a table for two and put in a request for a high chair. The table was set for only two adults without a high chair.  We were there at 5pm and wanted to check out the happy hour menu. We were told happy hour is not served in the dining room. Hostess wanted to move us to the bar, but fortunately the server said she would serve happy hour to us in the dining room.  We had the bite size happy hour menu. It was good but very pricey even for happy hour since it was 1 bite size item for $4 (e.g. 1 small size meatball). We ordered our drinks and several happy hour items. The oysters were good. So we wanted more seafood and I wanted to check out the misty effect of the chilled seafood tower.  We ordered the chilled seafood tower and it took FOREVER TO COME.  We checked with our server after waiting a good 1 hr thinking it shouldn't take that long cuz it's a chilled seafood platter.  Server said it will only take 3 more mins. So we waited and of course the 3 mins ended up being 10 more minutes. When it came, it was the wrong platter. She gave us the cooked platter.  We were contemplating about leaving because even our toddler who was distracted by watching you tube waited too long and said no you tube.... and started to get fussy.  But we were hungry and did go all the way to Burnaby to try the chilled seafood platter.  Server ordered a rush and said it would take 8 minutes.  Here we go waiting another 10 minutes. The seafood was good but definitely not worth having an over 2 hr dinner experience waiting.  \\n\\nWhen I compared notes with my sister's experience... I did not receive the same service.  Here is a list of my experience  ... (the server probably forgot or the restaurant is just not consistent) are as follows:  \\n\\n1. Inefficient service:  food took so long to come\\n2. Poor accuracy:  wrong order (platter)\\n3. No complimentary bread (my sister had complimentary bread the multiple times she went) \\n4. Chilled Seafood tower did not have dry ice  creating the misty effect (I purposely wanted to see that for my toddler to experience) \\n5. My open table reservation was made a no show\\n6. The reserved table had no high chair even though I've requested it on my reservation. \\n\\nWe live in downtown, would have been better off going to joe fortes or Gotham's.

I rarely ever complain about a drink, but having spent 6 years as a bartender in a very busy establishment, I felt obliged to say something. There were 2 bartenders working and it took me over 10 minutes to catch the attention of one of them. I told her what my issue was and she said \\"oh I think we are out of tonic because another customer mentioned that earlier\\" and then she took my drink. Why she wouldn't have told me they were out when I originally ordered it is beyond me. Then, I would have assumed that their standard protocol would be that of any other bar- when a customer complains (very politely I may add), you immediately attend to their issue. Instead, she took my drink and went on to serve other customers. About 20 minutes later, I think it finally clicked for her that she never gave me another drink.

We ordered at the counter inside and both staff members we spoke to were awesome. Very welcoming and pointed out a few recommendations on the menu.

Again, a server was friendly and brought drinks in a timely manner.  BUT THEN the food came. The amazing pulled pork sandwich I've heard so much about ended up being below average. It was extremely dry, chewy and overall just difficult to eat. I can only assume that because they were close to closing, they were just using up what food they have left over? And this meat had probably been sitting there a while. I get that they are preparing to close on a mid-week night, but the standards shouldn't drop like that. As for my side of corn, I can't comment on it because it never arrived. I was given fries, and when I informed our server he apologized and kept saying he would get the corn, but never did.

I'm also not the biggest fan of how you go to the back of the restaurant to order which doesn't make too much sense because when you walk through the door the menu is to your left and the kitchen is right there so it would make more sense to order closer to the menu? Not a huge issue but definitely inefficient since it's a bit awkward to walk in and order only to be told by kitchen staff to order at a different area. \\n\\nOtherwise great place, great vibes, and friendly staff!

I was staying at the Crown for a business trip, and came down for breakfast.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict and a cup of coffee.  I was basically expecting typical hotel fare--middle of the road Benedict and reasonable everything else.  When the food arrived, the first thing I tried was one of the breakfast potatoes.  I'm not sure why I always do that--they are often stale tasting and not well seasoned.  These were not at all that way!  They were perfectly cooked--well seasoned, slight give on the outside, and fluffy in the middle.  Wow, so far so good.  I tried the Benedict, and it was quite good as well.  Often the hollandaise is too sour for my taste, like the cooks use too much lemon juice; but here it was a nice tasty complement to the eggs and Canadian bacon.  The eggs were also nicely done.  I think even the Canadian bacon had a light sear on it.  I finished the whole plate--no regrets.  I would come back."},{"name":"Muscle Maker Grill","address":"358 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"4","text":"Very rude cashier, very poor customer service skills.

Ping is tugged away in the up and coming gentrified OLD TOWN/CHINATOWN neighborhood.  There are plenty of crappy americanized chinese restaurant in chinatown, but Ping stands out even though its not an authentic restaurant.  The menu ranges from Thai to Taiwanese dishes.  You've got your Thai ramen $8 with prawns, pork broth, egg, cilantro, and minty bok choy.  I highly recommend the ramen and some of the delicious appetizers.  Check out the fish ball skewers and the small octopus, I would shy away from the hydrated dry cuttlefish.  all ranges from $2.50 to $5.50  They also have fairly cheap warm sake, $6 a bottle.  Great price!  Another surprising twist to the place is they've got Taiwan Beer, something I had when I visited my parents on the tropical island.  Its made of fermented barley, rice, and sugar cane.  It tastes along the line of Corona but with a hint of sweet and nutmeg after taste.  I love it, $3 a cane not too bad for a rare item in the pacific NW.  I also recommend the salted duck egg salad, very good dish for a vegetarian.  So after all the tasty goods, you've got a wonderful selections of dessert.  Man... get the ice cream topped with rice... oh my gosh... orgasmic!  The sweeten coconut sticky rice with the minty ice cream and crumbled peanuts.  Oh man, you have no idea how tasty that combo is!  $6 for a small bowl, enough for my boyfriend and I to share.  Delicious!  Since we were such good conversational costumers, the bartender decided to make us a treat.  He brewed up a full cup of hot coffee, over a layer of condensed milk + spices and sweetener (something fancy I forgot the names).  Oh man, I usually don't drink coffee, but that was amazing.  Its an original concoction he came up with working at Ping.\\nSo the wait is a bit long considering they only opened up on Tuesday, we visited on Friday and two of us alone had to wait 15 minutes for the bar counter.  I imagine this place will get even more popular as the word of mouth goes out.  Did I also mention this place is opened by the owners of POK POK?

The menu is a mixture of fast food and higher end selections. Example, we had a muffuletta sandwich and lamb chops.  Both completely ala carte. The charcuterie board was good but rather light on items for 21. The muffuletta was served with chips. All good, not high end. The lamb chops were served on a cutting board with checkered paper. Concern that we'd eat the paper with the chops. Just odd.  We had the broccoli and sprouts roasted vegetables. We simultaneously noted these were not roasted, cooked as identified, but raw and crunch, some exterior cooking viewable. No silverware nor plates for the charcuterie plate.

Several comfortable over stuffed chairs and a couch serve those who are waiting for the rest of their party to join. Several carvings of Hindu Gods adorn this room, all of which are what I would consider exquisite pieces, but are likely found in any street Bazaar in India.\\n\\nThe (small) bar has four stools at it, and faces a modest stock of wines and spirits. There is never a full time bartender here, and if it's not one of the drink options on the menu, the staff isn't the greatest. Although they certainly go out of their way to try.\\n\\nOf course, no one is really going to an Indian place for drinks anyways. You're coming for the food!\\n\\nDinner starts off with a thin cracker thing made of lentil flour as an appetizer. Three sauces, Tomato Chutney, a Mint Sauce, and a Coconut based sauce are on the table as tasty accompaniments. Sometimes they switch them out as I've also had pumpkin curry and another, totally different, tomato based one before.\\n\\nTheir pakoras are among some of my favorites around though. The onion ones especially. They're just the right amount of crispy fried goodness coupled with greasy onion goodness. I keep meaning to try one of the other types.... but the onions just keep calling out every time.\\n\\nMy wife is a huge fan of the both the palak paneer and the eggplant curry. More then once she's had to ask the waitress to come back for our order because she can't decide. For me the palak is better then the eggplant, but only by an infinitely small margin.  \\n\\nIf for some reason I'm not stuffed on the pakoras, or I want to have a huge dinner of leftovers the next day, I always order thali dinner version. The rotating vegetable curry is always good, although I'm not a huge fan of the raita. It's not bad, just not my favorite. \\n\\nThe thali dinner's main dish is all over the menu (literally) for me. I've had just about every entree they serve. All are so good that even trying to narrow it down to two choices is near impossible. The Vindaloo, Chicken Curry, Chicken masala, Chicken saag, chicken makhani, and chicken tikka masala are all regular rotations. \\n\\nAnd all that topped off with some of the best Naan bread around. My ex (Indian) girlfriend's home made recipe couldn't even compete with with whatever crack they put in theirs. I could easily make a meal out of the Naan by itself. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that they tone down the spice on the vindaloo for American palates, you have to insist that they spice it up for you for that more authentic flavor. Luckily I come here often enough that the waitresses know that and try to accommodate. \\n\\nLastly, and in my opinion, most importantly is the service. Even a night of poor service here is still better service than most other places good service. When the service is good, it's outstanding compared to other places.\\n\\nIf you are a newbie to Indian Cuisine in general, Swagat is a great first timer's choice. The quality of the food overall, coupled with the accessibility of the food from a taste perspective should give even the most picky eater a reason to come here and fall in love with one of the world's best cuisines."},{"name":"Kings Dining & Entertainment","address":"50 Dalton St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Pretty cool spot-shuffleboard, bowling, jenga, and pool are just some of the games here.

We wanted to pay with two cards and when the checks came back to sign, we realized somehow we were only being charged for about a third of the total. Notified the waitress and she reran the bill. Then, there were $24 of errors on the bill - wine charged at a third higher than the first waitress quoted us.

Imagine we did the honest thing of calling out a nearly $180 error in our favor, and when we asked the manager to correct the overcharged wine we were told no. In the end, our bill was corrected but the manager was extremely rude to us. I've been to Accanto many times and have run into this type of poor business and poor treatment of customers.

Most places I've been to haven't made redeeming coupons so difficult. We went to the arcade area and saw that many of the games were broken, some were also very old. A few games took our money without even letting us play, one game broke as we were playing it. The place was very crowded with both adults and kids, and there were cups and trash everywhere with no one really bothering to clean up. But, we played our games and had fun collecting tickets. Unfortunately, the store where we would redeem our tickets have very little to offer and was a mess. We didn't try the food- I would rather eat elsewhere and get quality food for a better price.

I understand that with only a beer & wine license (a full liquor license is forthcoming), one's options are limited, but I have been in other restaurants with just a beer/wine license, and still had nice cocktails (albeit, low alcohol).

Great BBQ in Florida is hard to find, and unfortunately I don't feel like I found it at Fuel. Across multiple visits and various menu choices, I was charmed by the building decor and the staff but was disappointed in the taste and quality of the food.\\n\\nOn my first visit I had a pulled chicken sandwich with baked beans and mac and cheese. The pulled chicken was very dry, but it was better once I smothered it in one of their signature sauces.  I expected the baked beans to be sweet and savory, but there was an odd addition (what tasted like rotel) that I just didn't enjoy the flavor of. The mac and cheese on my first trip was greasy and ended up separating, not at all creamy like you'd expect, but it was much improved on my second visit. \\n\\nMy second time through had me tasting the burnt ends, green beans and cornbread, and I tried their highly touted brisket, as well. Much like my previous visit, I found both meat selections to be pretty dry. Both had really thick rubs that ended up being caked on the outside of the meat, so it felt like I was eating a moist paste on top of dry meat. I was looking forward to the green beans, but they ended up being greasy and slightly sweet. The cornbread was good, slightly sweet with a cake-like consistency,  almost as if it had been sifted.\\n\\nBoth trips to Fuel left me feeling underwhelmed and slightly disappointed, especially after hearing so many good things from the community.  I hope that they take these reviews as constructive criticisms and work to improve their output, as they have a beautiful venue, a friendly staff and the potential to be a staple in downtown Sanford."},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"1425 Wells Branch Pkwy","city":"Pflugerville","stars":"2","text":"You should know there is a time when they just get everything right.

It's sliced a bit TOO thin, and portions are super tiny. I could feed a baby bird with the way they cut their meat. If they could alter their slicing to more of the industry standard, their rating would be bumped. Also, their mango smoothie was delicious - the bae had a nice alcoholic beer, but kept drinking my sugary goodness instead of boozing it up. \\n\\nOverall, a good experience a day a pleasant surprise.¬† I'll come back one Saturday to try their lunch menu, and maybe portions of other parts of their large menu."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"There are over 450 reviews of this place.

After eating & asking twice for another drink with no response, I laid my winning poker slip on top of my empty glass and slid it all the way forward in front of me thinking maybe she just hadn't heard me. She walked past it probably 5 times, asking every other customer if they needed another or refill (including my man) cashing two other poker slips, and still ignored me as if I weren't even there. I ended up having to wave my ticket in her face in which she rolled her eyes, snatched it from me, started to run and cash it, stop and began helping someone else, put my winnings on the counter, didn't count it out, didn't say one word, and walked away and still never asked me if I would like another drink when my man was on beer #4.

My girlfriend enjoyed her Salmon Bearnaise and said she'd order it again. Next time we visit I will definitely order the Miso-Glazed Seabass as I hear nothing but great things. The bisque was so creamy & aromatic, I could have tipped the cup over and chugged it down.\\n\\nMost tables that night received the Baked Alaska for their anniversary dessert and we were looking forward to the spectacle of its presentation at our table when complimentary dessert (always a bonus) was delivered. We were surprised to see that we received a slice of chocolate cake & carrot cake instead.

Great vibes, music was upbeat, staff was amazing! I love the local Atlanta flare on the menu as this is a locally owned place they have cool titles of things like, let's go to MJQ, and we don't call it HOTLANTA anymore. The drinks were amazing aka strong and like Bartaco, they don't use any pre-mixed ingredients make all of their mixes and items from scratch. The taco selection is different every night, the owner, David, said. We had the Barbacoa, the chicken, and the poblano pepper tacos. It's nice they give you an option of corn or flour tortilla. I do wish that they had some sauces out so if you had a chicken taco and you wanted it to be a bit more juicy, you could add something. But I was able to ask for a side of the sauce on the other taco and without any problem got a side to dip. The guacamole comes in three different sizes and the smallest plenty for two people. I also loved that they have local artwork that changes every month on their walls. Saw some super inspirational things and got to check out some new artists as an added bonus. Definitely worth A walk down the beltline, because there's no parking so get those walking shoes out and stroll down have a seat at the bar maybe even grab some kombucha from the kombucha spout while you're there.

Not only was she able to smooth ruffled feathers throughout the entire packed front of the restaurant, but she was affable and compassionate and put everyone around her in an amazing, we're-all-in this-together mood.

We called on a Saturday night to see if the wait was long for a table for 2. We were told 15 minutes. We immediately get in the car and are there in 10 minutes. We are then told 30 minutes...no problem. We go to the bar, I order a dirty Martini  and my wife a glass of wine. Don't know what was in my drink but it wasn't olive juice. So I order a beer, the bartender can't screw that up. We wait, and wait, and wait. An older couple who were told 30 minutes were seated after he complained and after he waited 1 hour and 20 minutes. Twenty minutes after we arrived a group of four come in, a couple and their daughter and a daughter's friend.   We wait, we wait, and wait. After an hour and 10 minutes we see a table of two get up and figure, ok finally. But now, they grab the four that came and seat them! They'd been there about 40 minutes!...we were now going on 1 hour 10.  We were miffed, tired, hungry and had wasted 40 bucks at their awful bar. I politely ask and was told that that table was for four, even though a couple had just left. When I ask how this is possible I get a shrug and am told I will be sat soon...like I was an hour earlier. We stormed off. It ruined the night.

Fried Pickles were heavily battered and rather limp. They're just sandwich pickles, so not so sturdy for frying, perfectly fine on your chicken.

We had water to drink, and you help yourself. \\n\\nIt was a warm spring afternoon and we sat outside. After about 5 minutes the food was brought out to us. \\n\\nThe Falafel Pita Wrap was served wrapped in foil. It was stuffed full and was a little difficult to eat without a fork. The sandwich was served in a warm pita spongy bread, three or four falafel balls, lettuce, hummus, and a creamy yogurt sauce. The fries were seasoned and twice fried. Both were delicious. My partner's  Chicken Pita he said it was nicely done. \\n\\nTo sum it up, the restaurant is nothing special inside, more of a counter than a restaurant.

Check it out, you're missing out!"},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My friends raved about this place so the bar was already pretty high. I had ordered 3 things upon my visit and I received only 1 thing correctly. My chocolate potato donut came out as the bacon wrapped date in which I did not eat. After I informed another server passing by they brought out the correct order. The server apologized and said he'd strike the date from my check.. which shouldn't have been on it anyways. After waiting for my whole parties' food to arrive, it struck me when the table next to me received their biscuit orders before mine. It wasn't until a little while later that our server checked up on us and I checked in on my fried egg n cheddar biscuit. She had told me that she didn't even write it down and had asked at that point what I wanted in my sandwich. I chose the fried chicken, then changed my mind that I didn't want the order. My party was almost done with their meal and I didn't want to hold them up so I told her I no longer wanted it. To my surprise I saw the sandwich with bacon had come out on a board. Once again another mistake. At that point I was getting more irritated that not only were my orders placed wrong, but my last request was ignored. I was ready to strike Tasty n Sons off of my list. \\n\\nThe server came back extremely apologetic. I've worked in a restaurant before and I know how hard it could be. I ended up taking the sandwich to go so I wouldn't keep everyone I was with there any longer. Based on what I just wrote I wasn't planning on writing a review, even though this was a fiasco. I hate being the difficult customer, which this case I don't think I was. I hate more to write a less than glowing review on an establishment that deserves better.\\n\\nWhat ultimately changed my mind was the fried egg n cheddar biscuit that I so longly waited for. I got home and upon first bite, I knew I couldn't easily write Tasty n Sons off of my list like that. The biscuit was fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside. I can't tell if it was the bacon grease or added butter on the inside that made the biscuit so moist and savory. I honestly did not want to put it down. I will definitely come back for the biscuit with the chicken. When I devoured the sandwich at home, I was so happy that the sandwich came despite my request against it. Maybe the server knew I would regret not trying this amazing sandwich. Maybe their mistake was to get me to come back and try the rest. The server ended up taking the sandwich off of the bill which was extremely kind of her. I didn't want her to go through all of the trouble. I can confidently say, this is the best biscuit breakfast sandwich I have ever had! You are truly missing out if you pass on this like I almost did.\\n\\nThe chocolate potato donut was very moist. Once I got over that there was potato in it, it's just a regular chocolate donut. I would get this again if my sweet tooth beckoned for it. Let me tell you, Aunt Paula knew exactly what she was doing when she was making that French toast. MMMM! It was light and fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness. The whip cream topping was dense and reminded me of ice cream. All of my friends foods smelled incredible! The aromas of everything just dancing in my nostrils with every inhalation. I had a long list of foods I want to try so I will definitely be coming back. \\n\\nThe food easily receives 5 stars. Dare I say 6 stars if that is possible? Considering the food is what saved this review from ever seeing light or be a shocking 1 star. I would have given this Tasty n Sons a regrettable 2 stars based on my experience today when I was filled with my hangry rage. Despite the mishap, I would give the service a 5 on account that the servers I encountered seemed genuinely sorry for the mistake. It's a tad pricey for the serving size, but quality over quantity. I wouldn't mind paying this much again for amazing food."},{"name":"Graffiti Junktion Clermont","address":"2400 S Hwy 27","city":"Clermont","stars":"3","text":"Stopped in tonight for the first time and found the place not busy at all.

He talked about how he was in the navy.. funny dude. Being a fellow veteran and all, i got his jokes and me and my buddy laughed a lot with him. The second guy.. this little chap, was more of the farts and sex joke type.. I had nothing against it but it wasn't my thing. I left during the performance of their \\"headlliner\\". I was expecting to be rolling on the floor, holding my stomach laughing but I didn't even smirk once. The guy had a set that only someone with the minimum age of 50 would get. He talked about things that neither myself or my friend could relate to. He kept naming all these old medicines from the 1940s that I had no idea of and I would think they were funny because the older viewers were laughing but I didn't get anything he was saying.\\n\\nWe left towards the end of the show because it was just getting embarrassing.

Our experience each visit has been almost identical to the one before. After multiple visits, our consensus is that it is too early to give this place a higher grade than average.  Truthfully, 3* is a bit of a stretch. \\n\\nSo far, the good:  The brisket was good. Nice bark, not too salty, tender, tasty. The pork was just ok - in fact, it was rather bland. Nothing special because pork is a very neutral meat that relies on a combination of a great rub, a nice smoke using a flavorful wood like pecan or orange or apple, and as a last resort, a defining flavor in the sauce to be used as a complement instead of needing to be the dominant flavor. Not quite there yet. The cornbread was very good. Sweet, moist, tasty - a nice save after the overall weak meat-n-three meal we had each visit. \\n\\nUnfortunately, still to be worked out: the baked beans were void of any distinct flavor and much too soft for our liking. The mac & cheese was dry & bland. The collards needed salt. The cole slaw had no defining flavor. We couldn't taste anything in any side item that made us want to come back & order any of the sides we tried again. \\n\\nWe haven't been able to try the ribs, because on each of our 3 visits there were no ribs to buy. We've been by at noon; around 2pm; and around 5:30pm, all on different days, and we have yet to find ribs for sale. Why? Not good to be out of what most folks look for as a main ingredient in pretty much every BBQ joint in the South, especially if you are trying to build up a buzz through word of mouth. Poor planning, or just taking baby steps for the first several weeks - either way, this place needs to get their act together if they expect to build a reputation as the go-to BBQ place in our town. \\n\\nWe're going to be patient.

By no means are the curries top of the line, but they'll do when craving that sweet earthy red deliciousness of a Marsala or Vindaloo. One of the upsides to the Swagat buffet is that it has a lot more of the style of curries that I like - possibly a regional preference, I don't know (I just know what I like - what more do you want from me?!).\\n\\nWhile I'm not going to drive all the way out to the westside to lunch at Swagat, it's definitely a solid spot to grab a meal when you're in the area... and of course when you don't have anything to do besides sleep off your food coma for the following few hours."},{"name":"Rino's Place","address":"258 Saratoga St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely delicious food!.

We got the veal with gorgonzola sauce and mushrooms ($27), and the chicken in a cream sauce with mushrooms. Two things about this: 1) I am generally a fan of blue cheese and gorgonzola, but WOW there was way, way too much gorgonzola in that first dish. It was overpowering, punctuated only by bites of ill-suited parsley. I rarely come across a dish that I seriously cannot continue eating because I dislike the taste so much, but this was an unhappy addition to that list. 2) We didnt realize that the entrees would come with their own little dishes of spaghetti in marinara, as sides. If we had, we probably would have avoided ordering appetizers with pasta in them...\\n\\nNavigating the unevenly paved (to say the least), cramped parking lot can be stressful.

A quaint restaurant with crisp white walls and rich black accents - leather upholstered chairs and a beautiful ornate black chandelier lights. Minimalistic  Emphasis on the food. Awarded Gold for Best Casual French 2012 re: 23rd annual Vancouver Magazine Restaurant Awards, Pied-√¢-Terre surely one of the best value dining experience in Vancouver. Also, ranked high are our list is Tableau Bar Bistro and Salade de Fruits.\\n \\nDuring October 19th to the 30th Chef Andrey Durbach has put together delicious menu during the Seventh Annual Game & Mushroom Festival. Enjoy dishes such as Shiitake mushroom caps stuffed with scallops, garlic-soy butter and Roast lingcod, gnocchi and chanterelles. \\n\\nWe rallied a few friends to dine with us - 3 courses for $48.\\n \\nShiitake mushroom caps stuffed with scallops, garlic-soy butter: Lightly battered like cream puffs the mushroom caps oozes with earthy flavors. Scallops were perfectly cooked and the sweetness complements well.\\n \\nSweetbreads with wild mushrooms: The name sweetbreads always throws me off. I always imagine it is like donuts or waffles... In reality sweetbreads are the thymus and pancreas glands of animals. But what did it taste like? Chicken. \\"Chicken\\" swimming in mushroom essence stuffed with some more spores.\\n \\nBreast of duck \\"forestiere\\": I should brush up on my French. Thank goodness for Iphones and the world of Google. After consulting my BFF, the Internet, I learnt that forestiere aka \\"of the forest\\" is characterized by deep, hearty flavors, usually including mushrooms. Voila! So the duck breast is a wild beast in the forest of kale, fingerling potatoes and mushrooms. This is a rich dish where the skin of the duck is crispy, the meat is tender and moist. The sauce is bold but can get salty after consuming too long. Best to take a couple sips of your wine to cleanse your palate. My friend found the duck to be slightly gamey, but I thought it was alright.\\n \\nRed deer chop with shepherd's pie, game jus, cranberry sauce: There was no trace that this was wild game; and could've probably passed for a slightly more tender version of a tenderloin. Sitting on a bed of asparagus and carrots, the cranberry sauce served as an agent to break apart the heaviness. The sophisticated version of Shepherd's Pie is light and fluffy and seats atop of the minced meat.\\n\\nRoast lingcod, gnocchi and chanterelles, braised lettuce, peas and carrots: The fish is fresh and bouncy. Although very lightly seasoned, the sweetness of the white fish is lifted with winter greens. The herbed crusted gnocchi pillowy soft with a chewy texture and the orange, meaty and funnel-shaped chanterelles mushrooms are mildly fruity with a  peppery taste.\\n\\nShropshire Blue with oatmeal biscuits and marmalade: Sharp cheese. Sweet marmalade. Sweet home made biscuits. Served with celeries to cleanse your palate.\\n \\nApple begniets, ginger and cardomum custard: Kudos to the nice gentlemen who recommended this to me. This delightly apple donut with vanilla bean ice cream and a warm center makes me so happy I wanted to cry. The morsels of apple bites screams oh mon dieu!\\n\\nChocolate mousse, raspberry pur√©e: Tart raspberry puree and bitter dark chocolate mousse on the bottom. Remember to scoop from the bottom to the top to even the complexities on your palate.\\n \\nFor $48 this was a satisfying meal. Portions were generous and I'm glad they didn't skimp out during a promotional tasting menu. 8th Annual anyone?"},{"name":"Bossa Nova","address":"290 Main St","city":"Malden","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place to be , nice music , nice ambient, awesome food.

Most are filled with overly rude staff and bizzare dishes that have no flavor.

The place was so clean and kept that way. You can tell the staff enjoy working there and take pride in it. Our food was delivered hot from being freshly made instead of from a hot lamp. They had some awesome hot sauces that I had never tried before. They had a good selection of condiments which I appreciated. I am visually allergic to mayo and ketchup, which is what is usually only available at most places. I highly recommend the Habanero hot sauce if you like some spice.

But, my terrible experience last night compelled me to prepare those that seek out this restaurant based on undeserved reviews and advertisements on the Food Network.\\n\\nTruth be told, this does feel like your mom and pop neighborhood home-cooked Italian eatery, but the food is just as good as suggested. Maybe it was magnified by the huge hype and endless hours of waiting, multiplied by the rudeness of the lady in control of the list, but the food was just not that amazing.\\n\\nThe Lobster Ravioli was too heavy and a bit too salty. Albeit, there were large chunks of lobster but two raviolis later I could not eat any more and not because of being full. The ravioli skins were also too thick and hard to chew probably from making them so large to contain all the lobster filling.\\n\\nNext, the chicken parmesan was pretty good. But, nothing mind blowing. It was good but in the time waiting I could have flown to Italy for a much better meal.\\n\\nAs a warning be prepared to possibly not even get a seat until the kitchen is almost closed because of their need to seat reservations first. And, these can slip in at any time even if they call in last minute. For us, we made the trek to sign our name before 5 pm and were told we would have seating between 7-8pm. However, calling around subsequent times in a 2-hour period the numbers of parties before us had not changed and we were not seated until almost 10 pm, told repeatedly that a new reservation had come in.

Joe came over here from the B-Side and is as friendly and knowledgeable you could ask from a bartender.  Tell him what ingredients you like, and he'll mix up your new favorite drink.  My standby is the Old Overholt manhattan on the rocks - an extremely generous pour is $7.50.  If you're into bourbon and want options beyond Maker's and Jim Beam, Highland probably has it.

The soup was also not that great; add to that the fact that it was like an ice chunk and I had to wait days for it to thaw and then sadly discovered it was very onion heavy- not something I'd purchase again. They had enough to choose from though that I could go back and buy some other items, and if I'm in the area, I'd definitely do that.\\n\\nMy big problem was the price. Five items should not come to over $40 when it's soup and smaller items. While the soup and rugulah were clearly marked, the other items had a \\"guess how much we charge\\" type of feel to them.

Tasted great even without the mayo sauce. \\nCoconut fried banana was as delicious! 5 thick rolls, about a finger long. I mostly tasted banana (inside roll). \\nThe Thai iced tea was okay. I'm not a big fan of Thai iced tea in general, so I've learned after a couple drinks in my life. At least it wasn't too sweet or powdery.\\nI was on vacation in Boston and if could, I would come again someday to try an entr√©e."},{"name":"iPho Noodle House","address":"3005 West Lake Mary Blvd, Ste 108","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"4","text":"This becoming a weekly habit for me.

I also enjoyed the Hummus and Stuffed Peppadew Peppers that were also $7 each.  There's a full bar with craft beers and wine for all your drinks needs but don't overlook the delicious hand crafted Sangria.  There are two different types of sangria.  Marbella Red is bold red wine infused sangria with orange, blueberry and strawberry and Andalucia White is crisp white wine sangria infused with pear, lemon and ginger.  You can try one or both at $7 a glass or $35 per carafe.  It's so delicious, you'll want to have a carafe all to yourself.  The signature pizzas (Waverly, Asian BBQ Chicken and Garden) were excellent, but you'll also want to try their specialty ATL BLT and my favorite, the Delphi pizza which is loaded with roasted artichoke, olives, roasted tomatoes, red onion, mozzarella, feta, roasted garlic puree and kale.\\n\\nI was stuffed to capacity but I couldn't leave without indulging in some gelato.  It was $3 for a single scoop, $4 for a double and $6 for a triple.  I had a taste of the butter pecan but my friends were having personal relations with the bourbon and cookies and cream.  I can see this restaurant quickly becoming a popular hub for locals and pizza connoisseurs throughout the city."},{"name":"Cuon - Vietnamese Street Food","address":"600 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Best Vietnamese food I've had.

That was also delicious. The sandwich was huge and the fries had great taste. My boyfriend really liked his Turkey BLT also. The potato salad came with it and that was really good too.\\nMy usually fave is the deli trio which comes with your choice of 3 salads (chicken, shrimp, tuna, egg, etc) on lettuce. I needed the carbs today though!\\nYou can also pick from a choose 2 menu if you want to try half portions of a sandwich, soup, or salad. \\nI like that you can order anything to go and they specialize in quick and easy catering.

For Greenlawn, you can order at the food truck and then have somewhere nice to sit down and eat. If you want a beer, then you can go to the bar and order. Sometimes, I know I will feel like one or the other. Many times, I will just be stopping by for a couple of pounds of the delectable brisket to take home.

I truly have experienced better.\\" \\n\\nFor starters, I am a hospitality junkie, and customer service goes a long way with me.  We were greeted by the hostess who immediately asked of if we had a reservation, in a bit of a snooty way.  Just not very welcoming. We had to wait for our table even though several were open. Our server had a sass to him that could have been very fun, but unfortunately came across like he could have really cared less to be honest, and gave the impression that he really just didn't want to be there. He also had a large party at a different table, and that didn't help matters as his attention remained with that table.   \\n\\nThe ambiance of this place couldn't be cuter, and the name fits so well.  It literally looks like a Picnic House!  There are strings of lights, \\"windows\\" that look like you are standing on the outside of a house, cute quotes, greenery, and you really feel like you are outside.  The problem was the food tasted like it literally sat in a picnic basket.  I had the stuffed portobello which I would have imagined would have been far more delish had it been warm.  My dinner companions had the lemon roasted chicken, the maple brined pork chop, and the short rib over savory pancake.  None of the dishes were warm (everything luke warm, and mine was almost cold).  The braised beef looked a little dry, but the pork chop was extremely dry to the point where the person that ordered it did let the waiter know.  He was kind enough to take the dish off of the check since she didn't really eat it.  She then ordered the Roasted Tomato Soup, and it was delicious, but again luke warm.  \\n\\nThe appetizer we shared was the Artisanal Cheese Plate which was very good! It was only served with one bread loaf which was 5 small pieces for the 4 of us however, and it took 45 minutes to finally get more bread after we asked 3 additional times. The 2nd bread loaf came well after dinner was served.\\n\\nFor Dessert, we shared the Grilled Pound Cake and S'more Pudding, and those were the saving grace of my picnicking experience, or this review might have been 1 star."},{"name":"Taco Bell","address":"502 W William Cannon Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"Oh I forgot to mention the guy with a girl sitting in the middle of the place.

From the time we entered, to the time we left, there wasn't a single borderline complaint. First off, the staff that was here, was so darn friendly, then, on top of it all, they even have their own little concoctions they like and are more than happy to give you advice if you want or ask, as to which topping goes with what or what tastes good in their experience so far. The amount of things you get for the price is downright awesome. This place is also very very clean and visually \\"Super Sanitized\\". They don't nit pick on things to charge you more either. Then, comes the cooking part, they do it in front of you and made sure it was done to our liking which is even more cool. The flavors of the food are undeniably the best I have had on this coast, like you would get from a mom and pop italian place. I'm a huge pasta lover and pizza lover first off, but I'm also a full blooded guido too . I would give this place my 5 star recommendation anytime to anyone anywhere. And I'll even drive back from Tampa over an hour just to have dinner here. It's that good. Whoever created this concept has got it down pat, no if ands or buts about it. Definitely a place all pasta and pizza lovers will want to try. And to add extravagant to already awesome, keep your receipt, the 10% off they give you for being a local is also given when you visit cold stone creamery next door for dessert. And from me, also a business owner and from my perspective and opinion, businesses showing that they're great neighbors and friends makes me as a customer feel even more at home and included in a great thing. So 10% off here and then another 10% off at cold stone just adds the words \\" Ridiculously Awesome\\"   to an already great place.

By the end of the night, my husband was giving bro hugs with the owner, Lee, who made sure we were taken care of and checked on us throughout the event.\\n\\nTo start, Saltyard's private events do not charge a room/reservation fee or require a minimum to hit, and are so flexible in numbers, accommodating guests numbering 20 to over 80. Their event menu is set as family style courses and you get so much food for a very reasonable price per person. We went with Saltyard because of the reasons listed above and creative menu. To be clear, patrons receive all dishes listed for each course and do not have to select one dish per course as I mistakenly understood until Jami clarified. For our particular event, we received all of the following:\\n\\nTo start: \\n1) Cheese platter with seasonal jam, crackers and pickled vegetalbes\\n2) Bruschetta\\n\\nCourse One: \\n1) Tuna tartare with kimci and miso aioli (this was seriously amazing; however, disclaimer, I am a kimchi-lovin' Korean)\\n2) Grilled corn with garlic aioli and cotija (cheese corn yes!!)\\n3) Roasted asparagus in a watercress bechamel sauce and poached egg (so so good)\\n4) Kale salad with pickled onions and peaches (very lightly dressed and fresh)\\n\\nCourse Two:\\n1) Grilled filets over mushroom marsala sauce (very tender and full of flavor - my favorite of the mains)\\n2) Swordfish over polenta (very mild but slightly underseasoned for my tastes)\\n3) Parmesan gnocchi and smoked chicken (delicious!)\\n4) Red curry roasted broccoli in a kombu broth (the broth threw me off but grew on me the more I ate)\\n\\nCourse Three:\\n1) Blueberry tart\\n2) Salted caramel creme brulee\\n3) Chocolate lava cake (Everything was beautifully presented and not overly sweet.

Come early to grab a table outside or make new friends as you enjoy your meal! \\n\\n| WHAT TO GET | \\n\\nI ended up trying the grilled cheese with beer cheese, pretzel with beer cheese, and a kielbasa on a pretzel roll. \\n\\nMy fave definitely was the pretzel with a small side of beer cheese. The pretzel had a great taste but was on the crispier side of the scale so it was more like a pretzel stick which was totally fine with me. The beer cheese balanced the saltiness of the pretzel really well. The grilled cheese was also a huge portion since they stuff it with beer cheese so you get full pretty quickly. The kielbasa was solid but nothing too out of the ordinary. I liked the chili topping they put on top with a dab of their whole grain mustard \\n\\n| SERVICE | \\n\\nService here is super friendly. Our waiter was quick to bring us what we needed and was so kind to let us split our bill and pay separately with ease. \\n\\nEasy Tiger is a great location to start your night down 6th and enjoy the Austin scene with a nice view and good food.

Let me start by saying that this was my first experience with Brazilian food other than steakhouses, so I can't comment on the authenticity of Muqueca. I'm just comparing the experience to the various other Latin and European foods that I've had.\\n\\nMy friend and I went on a Tuesday at 7:30, and there were about 5 tables being occupied. The interior is pretty casual, no frills, with some colorful wall decorations. \\n\\nWe wanted an authentic experience, so we started out with some caipirinhas. Man were these good. Just the right amount of alcohol and very citrusy and fresh. We then split an order of fried yucca. I'm familiar with yucca and have had yucca fries at different restaurants, and this dish wasn't spectacular. The small bits of yucca were fried well, but the white \\"special sauce\\" didn't have much flavor, so we ended up also dipping them in the hot sauce that was on our table. \\n\\nWe then split one muqueca with fish and shrimp. They brought two orders of rice with this, and it was definitely enough for two people. I don't know.. I guess I just had high expectations, but this didn't blow me away. The tomatoes, onions, and cilantro in the clay pot complemented the seafood well. It also came with a small bowl of fish sauce, which I scooped by the spoonful onto the rice since the white fish was a bit bland on its own. Overall, it was a nice dish, but I've had more flavorful stews in the past.\\n\\nConsidering that we had 2 drinks, split one appetizer, and split one entree, the total of nearly $50 seemed a bit steep, especially since the environment is so casual and the ingredients used weren't super expensive (we mainly filled up on yucca and rice). Their menu is extensive, so if I return I would try something else. I'd still recommend it for a solid Brazilian food experience!

I believe that many of them are her family members because I continue to see the same ones sitting in the same places in the restaurant at different visits.

It was around 6:30 PM on a busy Friday night with lots of theater-goers competing for tables, and we didn't have a reservation, but the personable and friendly hostess found a 2-top for us immediately.  It is a large restaurant with a very interesting and creative interior design that we took to right away.  We had a great waiter, and a really enjoyable meal.  There actually are a fair number of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free dishes on the menu, and the mix-and-match \\"picnic\\" concept works well for customizing your meal to your tastes and needs.  Here's what we had:\\n\\nGrilled Veggie Skewers ~ the highlight of our meal, good enough to make you forget about grilled meats.\\n\\nSmashed Yukon Potatoes ~ the name is accurate, these are more like smashed whole potatoes rather than mashed potatoes.  To make these vegan, you would need to have them hold the parmesan cheese, but we did not notice that ingredient on the menu (and so we ate it anyway, and it was great).\\n\\nBrown Rice Salad (cold) with root vegetables ~ also very very good, very flavorful.\\n\\nWhen we told our waiter we were looking for vegan and gluten-free options, he suggested the Bruschetta, which is mostly vegan (the pesto may have had cheese) and he added gluten-free buckwheat crackers for my wife (in addition to regular bread for me).

That side dish is highly recommended.\\n\\nThe final problem was the price.  Microwaved chicken plus two sides and a soda set me back $11.95.  Astrnomical prices for a food cart.  Plus, the menu was a little vague, so I feel kinda like I was suckered into paying that sum."},{"name":"Bahama Breeze","address":"1540 Rinehart Rd","city":"Sanford","stars":"3.5","text":"For a chain restaurant my meal was pretty good at this location.

After networking, I got back pretty late in the evening, so I quickly called the store to verify they would be open before I headed over.\\n\\nI headed over, placed my order for the vermicelli bowl which includes not one, but TWO proteins (I chose chicken and meatballs).  The man working the register was really friendly and threw in two complimentary spring rolls as the store was closing soon.  I left a happy customer with enough food for 3-4 people!  \\n\\nThe quality of the food was pretty spot on as well.  Coming from Houston, I am no stranger to properly made spring rolls and other Vietnamese cuisine.  The spring rolls here were made properly -- the skin was soft, the vermicelli inside was soft, and they included the proper amount of vegetables inside.  The sauce that came with the spring rolls was a little different from the usual sauce I'm used to and tasted like a hoisin + peanut curry hybrid of some sort, which I actually really enjoyed. The bowl was equally as impressive with all the vegetables, meat, and fish sauce.

I am forever grateful. \\n\\nHere's all the things I love about EPL:\\n\\n1) EPL is local. I think it's important to support businesses within our community. Plus, by supporting EPL you are supporting our local Humane Society, which is where the cats come from. \\n\\n2) EPL is run by a wonderful group of people who are kind, caring, and creative. They obviously love what they do, and it's inspiring. I've never felt \\"pushed\\" to adopt or purchase anything. When I did adopt, they patiently answered all my questions. They provided me with paperwork, a sample of food, and even recommended a local vet (Cats Only, who we also love). You all rock, and thank you for what you do!\\n\\n3) EPL has a relaxed but fun atmosphere. You pay a minimal fee and receive a timer that lets you know when your time is up. When you register at the front desk, you can purchase a drink or snack to enjoy as you play with the kitties. I've seen people go in to interact with the cats, or use that time to just read or work on their laptops. \\n\\n4) EPL thinks out of the box. There are additional ways to interact with the cats, such as yoga with the cats or painting sessions with the cats. I've seen them do movie nights (the awesome documentary \\"Kedi\\") and other events. Their social media is pretty active, too. They take photos of each adoption, and I love following up to see all the happy matches! \\n\\nHere's all the things I don't love about EPL:\\n\\nNothing! I can't think of a single thing. \\n\\nIf you haven't been to EPL yet, give it a try. You may just find that - like me - you are indeed a lover of felines. You might even find your perfect match.

We got: edamame with poprocks/salt (very interesting flavor that I've never thought of/had before, worth trying especially since it's only $4), squid fries (these were amazing I've never had squid that tasted so tender and the aioli, lemon, and herbs made for a perfect pairing) and the kimchi flank steak over rice (amazing flavors, gives you a bit of carbs and meat and overall very tasty). \\n\\nWill definitely come back to try a few more things - cornbread, kale salad, goat shoulder - all sounded interesting and I love when restaurants serve combinations of things that are unique or hard to put together at home. fantastic service as well!"},{"name":"Salsa & Agave Mexican Grill","address":"1205 Pacific Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Heard a lot about this place and was looking forward to trying it, however, was a tad disappointed.

They have a modern authentic vibe going on the second you walk into the restaurant.  Large bar to your left, plenty of seating room to your right, bright colourful walls, and fun, authentic Mexican decor to go with it all. If you walk more to the right you'll see a spiral staircase that leads you downstairs. That's where our group sat. We had a large table in the center of the room. This area looked like it was reserved for larger groups. Half of our party didn't show up and the staff was kind enough to let us keep the extra table. \\n\\nSidenote: I love spiral staircases. I always told my parents that when I owned my own house one day, it needed to have a spiral staircase. So the fact that La Casita had one, I was excited. \\n\\nFood-wise, we had a set group menu. Parties over 8 or more, they give you a set group menu. We were unaware of this when we came here originally, but our whole group was able to find something they enjoyed. To start we got a round of chips, queso, salsa and guac. The queso had to be my fave of the 3. Which is saying a lot because I live for guac. The queso being cheese based was already perfect, but they added an extra sprinkle of cheese right on top, so when you mixed the tortilla chips in there, it added an extra layer of cheesiness. I loved it. \\n\\nFor my main entree, I got the veggie enchiladas. It was a bit pricey - $18 for 2 enchiladas and a side of rice and beans, but hey, that's what I get for eating Mexican food in Vancouver. The dish was filling, savoury, cheesy, and delicious. \\n\\nTo close it all off, we got a few orders of their house churros. Ah-mazing. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. It was perfect. \\n\\nService was great. Being downstairs (away from the main hustle and bustle), service tended to be a bit on the slower side, but nonetheless still great. Our server was friendly and attentive. I was more so impressed that he carried all our dishes down that spiral staircase. Props. \\n\\nIf you're in the Gastown area and craving delicious Mexican food that's different than Tacofino and La Taqueria, come to La Casita.
