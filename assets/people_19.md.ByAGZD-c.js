This place has tons of rave reviews and I just don't get it.  I was expecting BBQ nirvana. Instead, I got meat covered in sauce. Who has to hide their meat in sauce...in TEXAS of all places. Now I understand why. I sent my plate back to have it made without the sauce....MISTAKE but easily correctable by adding it back.\\n\\nI ordered the 3 meat combo plate with Brisket, Ribs and Sausage. They brought out a plate with 1 rib, a little brisket, a few slices of sausage and 3 side which were coleslaw, potato salad and beans.\\n\\nFirst, the good stuff. The coleslaw was wonderful. It was like eating an asian inspired slaw. Very light, fresh and really hit the spot. The sauce was very good. I have never had anything like it. Actually, I have. It was similar to the sauce at Artz's Rib House on South Lamar. At any rate, it was good. These 2 things add up to one star as the real show should be the meat.\\n\\nNow, the bad. The brisket was tender but not fall apart tender. I still had to use a knife with it. It almost had a steak like texture instead of brisket. It lacked flavor and character.  The ribs were much the same. Meaty and tender however, it just lacked pizzaz without the sauce. The sausage was laughable. Did they open up a package of Hillshire Farms and heat it up? YUK! The Potato Salad, and I could be wrong, seemed like they boiled some potato's and added their sauce to it. BLAND.  I saved the worst for last. The so called beans on my plate tasted like spoiled Ranch Style beans from the can.

When Craigie first moved to its Main St. location, my husband and a bunch of coworkers called them up on a Tuesday and said, \\"We have no reservation and we're not dressed nice.\\" Craigie: \\"Come on over.\\" You can propose to your girl/boyfriend or just drop in for a snack here, and it's not unusual for Chef Maws to bring the meal to your table himself.\\n\\nThere's several ways to eat here, depending on what you're after. You can do an eight-course ($118) or six-course tasting menu ($98) or a three-course a la carte ($68). You can sit at the bar and order a few snacks, or Craigie's famous burger, a bargain IMO at $18. Every night I've been there, they've offered sides of duck fat brussels or bone marrow for $10. Or you could eat my favorite way with the four-course, $45 chef's whim, offered on Sundays after 9 and made of whatever Maws feels like cooking (well, and needs to use up).\\n\\nThe wines, beers and cocktails are consistently excellent. The menu changes but the emphasize is always on sustainable, local sourcing and French influences, with Maws's Jewish roots coming through now and then. Some of my favorites have been the charcuterie, the grilled Spanish octopus, the house-cured fishes, the orange blossom beignets, of course that burger, and, on one whim night, crispy Chinese duck necks.\\n\\nThe last thing to say is that Craigie is an amazing supporter of the neighborhood, staying open to feed us when weather closes every other place.

After finally coming around to it again, we decided to give it a try for a post-Christmas / early New Years meal.   The expectations were high given that this place is always on the Best of Boston List and scored one of the highest of Phantom Gourmet (before they switched to only reviewing oohhy---gooyey pizza and burger places).\\n\\nSetting: Casual, romantic, french farmhouse inspired.  The kitchen is open, so you can see the young chef staff working furiously on your meals.   It was nice to see owner Tony Maws keeping it real and actually cooking in the kitchen (and not off doing some celebrity chef television show).\\n\\nFood:  They make a big point to stress that this is a farm to table restaurant with very fresh and local ingredients.   The front of the menu lists all of the farms the meats and veggies come from.   We tried the 3-course prix fix (versus the 7-course tasting menu) since we had a late evening reservation.   The appetizers were outstanding (spanish octopus and then mushrooms with sweetbreads) that were cooked perfectly.   The entrees were of excellent quality (venison and then trout), but nothing that really set it apart from other quality farm to table restaurants in the city.   And that's what cost Craigie the 5 star rating.   This place has superb quality and cooking technique, but I feel like you have some truly innovative expensive restaurants out there pushing the envelope, and making Craigie feel...ordinary.\\n\\nDrinks: The wine list is exclusively European, with a heavy dose of French.  We know our way around Californian, Australian, and even South African wines, but French leaves us lost.   The descriptions of the wine are also non-existent (it's almost like they expect you to know all about them), and the prices are high ($48 - $250 for a bottle).   Luckily, you can order by the glass (which we did considering we couldn't agree on a bottle).   \\n\\nService:  Our waiter was a true professional, and was proud of the restaurant and it's reputation.  He helped us through the wine list (though always suggesting some of the priciest wines).   The only small gaffe was that he send a glass of wine to the table with dinner that I had considered, but never officially ordered.  Also, I should note they have great hosting and valet service.\\n\\nOverall, I really like Craigie...it's quality, conservative, farm-friendly, and remains true to it's original mission.   I just wish it took a few more chances or pushed the envelope slightly more with some risky culinary combinations.   For some people, this is all they'd ever want in a high quality meal, but for me at the price...I like a little more adventure in my meal."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The place is great but the food can be better.

They're the best - no contest. We really appreciate the effort they put into making the pizzas. When we order from them, we know we're getting a darn good meal. We've tried just about every \\"Specialty Pizza\\" they offer...and they're all winners. The BBQ chicken pizza is our favorite, though. \\n\\nIn the past they have messed up our order once or twice. They're always polite about it and always make up for the blunder by giving us \\"$5 off next purchase\\" coupons. That's a fair trade, I think.\\n\\nCon: We know it can be confusing to get into our building if you've never done it before, so we give people simple directions (seriously simple - even a monkey could follow them). The individual who takes our order always assures us that the directions will be passed along with our order.\\n\\nMost of the Austin's Pizza delivery drivers follow the directions and find their way up here without a problem; however, a particular young woman constantly neglects to follow the directions and eventually takes the stairs up. She has delivered here several times. Every time she has an issue getting up here and every time she expresses her frustration with a pissy attitude. The thing is, we're nice folks. We're sympathetic - those stairs are no fun...but don't blame us for the fact that your foundation is melting when you're the one who didn't follow the simple directions - and expect your tip to decrease by $1 with every one of your divalicious eye-rolls."},{"name":"Little Bangkok","address":"2225 Cheshire Bridge Rd Ne","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Always a great option for lunch- all dishes come with soup, rice and are typically $8 including tip.

I stumbled upon Sake one day as I was on Washington St and decided to give it a try. \\n\\nSo, this past Friday night, my husband and I ordered delivery.  We thought the prices were a little high, so we were hoping that the sushi would meet our expectations.  It did!  We ordered a variety of maki (crunchy roll, spicy tuna, spicy yellowtail) and sashimi (tuna, striped bass), along with seaweed salad.  \\n\\nThe sushi was fresh and delicious!  The seaweed salad was light and refreshing - the perfect way to start.  The only slight complaint hubby had was about the spicy tuna roll.  He's  a spicy tuna afficionado and he didn't love it.  Maybe it was because the tuna was chopped, instead of the one whole piece that was used for the spicy yellowtail roll.  He said there was also too much spicy mayo mixed in.  Don't get me wrong, he loves spicy (he puts Tabasco on just about everything) but the quantity of mayo just overwhelmed the sushi.  The spicy yellowtail, however, was made perfectly, he said.\\n\\nOverall, we were very happy with our order.  And to top it off, it was delivered in under a half an hour.  We called at 6:30 on a Friday night.

We arrived around 5:00 and we were greeted and seated by our waitress, Mary Ann, right away. She was a really sweet older lady. Since this was our first time she explained the menu to us and also let us know the soup and pirogi flavors of the day. Today  they had cheese and potato pirogies and also mushroom and sauerkraut pierogies. \\n\\nWe ordered the pierogi appetizer which we got for free with our Yelp check in and we got two cheese and  potato pierogies and one mushroom sauerkraut one. We had the option of pan fried or boiled and we chose pan fried. For our entrees we both ordered the Polish platter, his with mushroom sauerkraut pierogies, smoked kielbasa, and tomato sauce on the cabbage roll, mine with potato cheese pierogies, fresh kielbasa, and tomato sauce on the cabbage roll. \\n\\nWhile we waited we were given two pieces of a delicious bread. It was sweet and the texture was fluffy. So good. The pierogi appetizer arrived with sour cream on the side and we dug in (and forgot to take a picture). The potato cheese pierogi were perfect, you can't really go wrong with potato cheese. The mushroom sauerkraut weren't my favorite, but my husband loved them. Mushrooms aren't my thing. Our entrees came out pretty quickly as we had gotten there before the dinner rush. Though not long after we were seated and our orders put in a lot more people started coming in for dinner, so we just barely missed it. \\n\\nI loved all of the items on the Polish platter. My pierogies were delish, the saurkraut was good and more mild than the normal sauerkraut you would put on a sausage, the cabbage roll was great and very filling, and my fresh kielbasa was really good though I might order the smoked next time. I tried a bite of my husbands and it was very flavorful. They were both very tasty though and I can't really pick a favorite. We ordered a piece of apple strudel and a piece of the coconut peach cheesecake to go and haven't had those yet. There is no way out stomachs could fit any more food right now. \\n\\nThere was a really rude guy there who was mean to our waitress which made me angry. He came in and wanted a table that was reserved for another couple and even had a reserved sign on it. When she explained it was really reserved for another couple he angrily said he would just eat somewhere else and walked out.  So rude!

We were getting pretty full just from these three dishes. For the entrees we got the beef bolognese and the short ribs. The bolognese was...boring - the pasta was a bit on the soft side and the dish was lacking flavor. The short ribs were very tender and delicious, and I thought the veggies it came with were a good go-with. \\n\\nAll in all I left stuffed and sleepy.

It's on the old Chevy's building at the West Oaks mall which isn't the best location so not sure if it will last.  Sign on the door said they are now closed for lunch Mon-Thu due to low volume so that's not a good sign and it was fairly empty at 12:30pm on a Sunday.  The waitress recommended the onion rings and most New England seafood places have great ones so we got them as an app.  They were very bland so I wouldn't get those again. Being from Massachusetts we always try the fried clams when someone advertises New England style.  They were OK but portions were very small for the price.  Boston's Fish House in Winter Park has similar prices but better taste and much larger portions.  They did have 2 for 1 Bloody Mary's which was nice.  My daughter asked the waitress if their pastrami was red (New England style) or black pastrami which is what you normally get in Florida.  The waitress didn't know and had to ask the bartender.  She confirmed it was red pastrami and my daughter let me cut off a piece and wow it was amazing.  I will go back for the pastrami but they need to work on the batter they use for fried items and serve larger portions before I go back for seafood again.  Boston's Fish House and Celebration Town Tavern both in Orlando area have much better New England seafood.

The Hemphill location was easy to find, but the bar stool setup along the walls seemed really awkward.  \\n\\nI ordered a Diavola pizza and a cannoli.  The cannoli was the best I ever had.  The thought of not filling the pastry until sale is brilliant - apparently I have been eating unnecessarily soggy cannolis all along.  The creamy and and crunchy sweet goodness is worth a return on its own.  The pizza went the other direction on the soggy scale.  Don't get me wrong, the flavor was great - the ingredients were fresh and yummy, and the parts of the crust that remained crisp tasted awesome.  However, the crust in the center of the pizza is a soft, almost mushy mess.  Perhaps getting it sliced was a mistake - keeping it whole and tearing it later would have kept the juices on top of the pie.  Even so, I've had similar style pizzas in other cities (Il Vicino in St. Louis is one example) where they slice the pie but don't run into the sogginess problem.  The sogginess problem is not just a flavor/texture problem, you will have evidence of being at Antico on your clothes.\\n\\nAll that said - it is not a bad pizza, but I'd only recommend it for a lazy afternoon with friends (parents with kids are asking for disaster).

This place - while it may not be a true hold-in-the-wall pub - was the most enjoyable out of any of the places we visited during our WDW trip. It was so enjoyable, in fact, that on my next Disney trip (two weeks away) I want to take my friend Liz here. She's a true-blue Irish lass who actually spent her entire college career in Dublin drinking at real Irish pubs - and yet despite this, I want to bring her here to enjoy the food, booze, and atmosphere. \\n\\nLike I mentioned, this place is much fancier than any pub you'll find in Ireland. The food here, in my opinion, should be considered upscale, but with an old-world twist. They have the classics like Shepard's Pie and Fish and Chips, but other yummy dishes like Raglan Risotto and something called Pork Supreme.\\n\\nWe made reservations for the place, but we had to wait 15 minutes or so despite it being January. At the time, Raglan Road was the newest restaurant in the Downtown Disney area, so I'm assuming that's why. We waltzed through the gift shop during our wait.\\n\\nThe first thing you'll notice about this place is the decor - dark wood and even darker lighting make this place feel like a pub. Yet the expansive dining area tells you it's no ordinary watering hole - this place means business. Overall, it had quite the charming effect - we were seated in one of the quieter dining areas to enjoy a memorable meal.\\n\\nOur server - and I forgot his name - was warm, committed, and downright hilarious - he was open to friendly chit-chat about anything. He told us, at the end of our visit, how wonderful it was to shoot the breeze with him. To me, that's definitely the spirit of an Irish pub - friendly conversation and humor, regardless of location.\\n\\nAnd so, the food - my mother had that Raglan Risotto, minus the parm, and she raved about it. I had the Beefy Murray, and while I'm not the biggest fan of spicy foods, I'm a sucker for anything in puff pastry. Despite the two different meals, one thing was for certain:  the food was well-prepared and fresh. The portions were a bit small for the price, but the quality definitely made up for it.\\n\\nWe were encouraged to stay for as long as possible despite the busy crowds. We kicked back with some coffee and Bailey's - the waiter even brought me ice cream because it was my birthday. \\n\\nWhile we were having our after-dinner drinks, a show was going on in the main dining room. Irish step dancers amazed the audience with their skill. It was definitely the cherry on top of a great dinner sundae.\\n\\nOverall, this place earns a five star in my book, and I would love to return here whenever I'm at WDW. I have the opportunity to visit a number of pubs in my area, but there was something unique about this place - maybe it was the high-quality grub mixed with old fashion charm. \\n\\nKeep in mind this place gets loud and rowdy - maybe not the best for small kids. I would actually recommend this as a place for parents to get AWAY from kids - the booze is varied and plentiful, and the food is different. If you've got a date night away from your kids while vacationing at WDW, give this place a go."},{"name":"Universal Orlando Resort","address":"6000 Universal Studios Plz","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"My vote for best theme park for adults, with islands of adventure a close second.

I really love the fact that the staff is so friendly and they keep everyone engaged in the games that are taking place. The food is definitely better than any sports bar that I have frequented.

I read the reviews, got the advice and eventually came here. I was just so disappointed.\\n\\nFirst off, our waitress/hostess was extremely rude. I never notice or really care about people's attitudes at restaurants, but she made everything so uncomfortable. From yelling at people to move their chairs, berating the woman next to us for not knowing what she wanted, and losing patience with someone else for asking regarding vegetarian options. It was honestly to the point that I couldn't even talk to the person I was at dinner with because these antics were so encompassing in such a small space. It was like going out to eat with your aunt and uncle and they get in a fight for the whole dinner. \\n\\nNow the food, we split the house special. It was not good. The seafood was, but the pasta was nothing special and there must have been 2 gallons of water in our dish.

I don't think I'll ever visit Boston without trying to get a meal here.  It's one of the best restaurants I've ever visited, and I was as happy with my dinner as I was with the brunch in my previous review.\\n\\nWe arrived early for our reservation and had a drink while we waited.  There wasn't a great place to do this, but the staff did their best to keep us comfortable.  I had a disappointing cocktail.  It was $12 and had a preposterous name (Nature of Nurture), so I expected some craft.  Made with hibiscus tea and flower-steeped London dry, Domaine de Canton, Grand Marnier, maple, and sparkling wine, it was overly sweet and medicinal.  As we drank, we saw a burger go by, and for that reason we decided to eat in the bar room rather than our table in the main dining area.  It was a comfortable space, more casual and tavern-like than the other side.  Service throughout the meal was attentive and friendly.\\n\\nThe food was stellar.  We got started with a nice warm basket of bread, nothing too fancy but certainly good.  There was one wheaty variety studded with sunflower seeds that took the win.  Then we ordered.  With four people, all family, we shared two prix fixe menus and got a couple entrees a la carte.  It was a perfect attack plan.\\n\\nThe prix fixe is not really a deal, but if you're going to get an appetizer, entree, and dessert, you might as well get the amuse bouche and paired dessert wine for a total of $75.  The whole table doesn't have to participate, so sharing is good, and you can order your priciest items prix fixe.\\n\\nWe had a choice of three amuses, of which we tried two.  Both were hard but not impossible to share, and they were excellent.  A chewy squid \\"pasta\\" with nuoc pham and tiny sliced radish offered a ton of flavor and a fun novel texture.  Cured goose breast pastrami with pickled okra, carrots, and corn was tasty even in shreds.\\n\\nThe appetizers were superb.  The grilled Spanish octopus was tender and meaty, and it delivered a fantastic tomato depth of flavor.  It was served with grilled ciollini onion, fresh hearts of palm and lemon salad, and a savory chorizo sauce.  House-made black pepper straccetti pasta with house-cured ham and Peekytoe crab ragout was another wonder, with a strong wheat flour taste to the al dente pasta and great texture from the crab.\\n\\nI often find that entrees at nice restaurants break the promises made by strong appetizers - not the case at Craigie.  We got fish, steak, vegetables, and a burger, and every one was delicious.  The line-caught tautog a la plancha was phenomenal, a luscious, fatty cut of fish served with toothsome Wellfleet and razor clams, whelks, mussels, and a cardoon puree.  All-natural hangar steak a la Poele was cooked a perfect tender pink.  It came with a sweet beef tongue ragout and spinach, prunes, almonds, and a parsnip tsimmes laced with sweet potato, date, spices, and a lot of comforting flavor.  Craigie can do beautiful things without meat, as shown by a glac√©e of early spring farm vegetables.  This was an artful medley of beet, asparagus, broccoli, white and purple cauliflower, peas, and more, served alongside a stripe of parsnip puree, spring ramp coulis, and walnut oil, and a heap of five grain and mushroom pilaf.  There were a lot of things going on, but the result was harmonious, with earthy flavors and some definite heft.  And finally, that burger, which was only available on the bar side.  It was a simple burger with Vermont cheddar and crispy onions, and it came with fries, lightly dressed greens, mace ketchup, red wine pickles, and a Southern slaw, all on the side.  The meat had an even fine grind that cooked to a beautiful soft medium rare, and it oozed juice.  The bun did its job and the cheese and onions were just right.  The ketchup and pickles made the burger even better, and I even liked the fat potato wedges, a type of fry I rarely favor, thanks to their significant crispy outsides.\\n\\nCraigie does not skimp on portions, and we were full by dessert.  Even so, we made quick work of what we ordered, as well as the wine pairings.  I had the sour milk panna cotta at brunch and wanted it again, this time with coriander-cashew granola, dried cherry and kirsch pur√©e, and brown butter.  It was ridiculous, with a lush thick texture and an irresistible tang.  The granola added great crunch, but I could've eaten the pure panna cotta on its own, out of a bucket.  It was paired with a sweet white wine, a golden glass of Sainte-Croix-du-Mont.  The bourbon pecan ice cream tart was almost as good, a hefty slice of pecan ice cream topped with soft chocolate, sitting on a subtly salty bacon pecan crust.  A crunchy crumble and smoked Mexican salt chocolate sauce finished the plate, and it paired well with a bold cuv√©e.\\n\\nThe meal ended with some almond rochere clusters, which were quickly replaced when we polished them off.  Like everything else at Craigie, they were just about perfect."},{"name":"Upper Crust Pizzeria","address":"20 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Wow, wow, wow!

A very, very, very long let-down. We showed up for our 8-course \\"Ultimate Craigie Experience\\" at 7:45pm and didn't leave the restaurant until almost 12:30am. Ultimate, indeed.\\n\\nWe waited about 30-40 minutes past our reservation time before being seated. They encouraged us to order from their drink menu while we waited on a cramped, dimly-lit entryway ramp with several other couples who had earlier reservations. In the meantime, we watched the stressed-out front-of-house staff try to convince everyone waiting for their tables to take small tables in the bar area instead of waiting for a dining room spot. Nobody accepted, and the entryway continued to get more crowded.\\n\\nUpon seating, our server apologized for the wait and offered to bring us some \\"complimentary\\".... tap water!!! While I appreciate the offer for a free taste of Boston's finest tap water, I would have preferred that they not charge us for the single Pepsi we drank a half hour earlier.\\n\\nOur server explained that the \\"Ultimate Craigie Experience\\" is a customized tasting menu, where they can tailor the experience to whatever you want. He explained that they have a normal progression of courses, but \\"for example, if you really don't like scallops, we could replace it with another fish or whatever else you want.\\" We said, it's great that you mentioned that; we've had scallops twice in the last day so we would prefer not to have those. Our server replied: \\"Well, we would really prefer that you not substitute out the scallops. It's better if you stick with the normal courses.\\" Don't advertise a \\"custom\\" experience if you don't actually want to customize anything!\\n\\nThe pacing of the meal was unbearably slow. More than 30 minutes between courses is unacceptable. At least we had some entertainment throughout the meal-- the chef stepped out of the kitchen at one point to berate a runner in the middle of the dining room. Otherwise, the staff was mostly absent and we needed to flag someone down a few times throughout the meal for various reasons (missing silverware, etc.)\\n\\nThe food was mostly unmemorable and sometimes bad. We were served a fish course that smelled and tasted intensely \\"fishy\\" and did not seem at all fresh. When we pointed it out to our server he apologized and offered to replace it with a cheese course at a later point during the meal. They then forgot about the cheese course until we reminded them at the end of the night. We also never received any petit fours with the bill, which we could see sitting out in the kitchen and being delivered to every other table with the bill.\\n\\nI've waited a few weeks to write this review and needed to go back through my photos to remember any of the food we were served during our $400+ marathon dinner. That should tell you all you need to know about the quality and originality of the food at Craigie.

If you've ever baked Red Velvet cupcakes or at least looked a classic recipe for it, you'll realize that RV cupcakes are basically a Devil's Food cake recipe (which is chocolate cake, but less intense as a normal chocolate cake), with the added red food coloring paired with a cream cheese frosting.

You must order a drink in order to partake in the happy hour menu and its pricing. \\n\\nIt's a bit loud and busy but we got our drinks within 10 minutes of being seated. Oddly, some of the dishes took a while to come out but I chalk that up to it being busy there. It was pretty packed and many people were there taking advantage of the lower priced menu options. Standouts were the handroll (salmon and cucumber for that day and $3!), the shishito peppers, and the NW Philly Roll. Admittedly, the philly roll is almost self explanatory AND they deep fry it. If you love creamy and crunchy rolls then you'll love this one. All told, the 3 of us left stuffed paying about $22 pp. Not bad. Definitely ordered all our options off the HH menu. \\n\\nI want to come back and try the omakase. I've heard it's amazing and also to try some other options for nigiri. It's pricey but many sushi places are and for me...it's par for the course. It doesn't get 5 stars because I wish the HH menu had more options for rolls with fish.

We had a great dinner here the other night.\\n\\nAlthough everything was outstanding, highlights from the meal would definitely be the Accara, which was an appetizer of black-eyed pea fritters, and the Yassa Guinar, a chicken dish served with a fabulous caramelized onion sauce (I wish there had been more of it) and jasmine rice. The bottle of wine that we ordered, the Pinotage, was so unbelievably tasty. My friend got the Vegetarian Nems that are rolls similar to a spring roll but about ten thousand times' more delectable. We had the beignets for dessert and they were served with this delicious coconut cream sauce and bits of what appeared to be kiwi on top. \\n\\nThere's flavor in everything down to the garnishes of salad atop the plates, and they're all so bold and complex. The sauces were over the top and this is definitely a sauce haven for those who enjoy them. \\n\\nIn fact, my only criticism of Teranga would be that there needs to be more of these delicious sauces -- I know that it's considered trendy and pretty to have plates without a lot of sauce, but there wasn't enough that came with the Yassa Guinar and I found myself intentionally conserving the little that came with it. The appetizer and bread basket didn't have much either, and I feel that adequate saucing is an important part of a successful dish, especially if there's rice accompanying it.

I was told it would be steak like the meat from a philly cheese steak.

First, my 4-year-old son and I were told (with several empty tables) that we'd be seated in five minutes.  Five minutes later, a couple comes in and was told it would be 10 minutes.  Five minutes after that, I complained.  They said we could sit in a table that \\"wasn't too cold\\"--fine.  We were given water (mine in an obviously-dirty cup--things were floating in it).\\n\\nWe finally got menus, and ordered.  My drink and my son's soup came fairly quickly, but not before the other couple was seated, and had received something to taste.\\n\\nMy son's drink came much later (a good 15 minutes after that), at which time the SOLE waitress asked if he wanted more bread.  Of course, he said yes, as any carb-loving four-year-old would.  At that point, I mentioned that he'd also like his sweet potato fries as well.  Needless to say, she never brought the bread.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the other couple received their lunch, having received their soups immediately after my son.\\n\\nThereafter, my son received his sweet potato fries.\\n\\nAbout 15 minutes later, approximately 40 minutes from being seated, I received my salad (appetizer at the same time).  I asked what was on my salad, and was told \\"queso fresco\\"--I reminded her I'd ordered without cheese.  She said, it would take \\"3 minutes\\" to make a new one.  I said \\"Really? It took 40 minutes the first time.\\"  \\n\\nThe Santa Fe salad was ok.  The gobi manchurian was not as good as the first three times I had it.  My son's drink was 100% bitter--lemonade without any kind of sweetener at all.  I think she could have mentioned that before we ordered it for him.  Or, it was just made very, very wrong.\\n\\nWhen I got the bill, the soup was not on it.  I did not say anything, as I figured it was the least they could do.  That was the only food we had on the table for a half hour.  I'm shocked I didn't get a ticket, as I had only about 1:12 on the meter.  I left \\"only\\" 15% as well.

Rudely greeted with: WE'RE NOT LETTING ANYONE IN, WE ARE AT CAPACITY!!!! Seriously? Get a grip. First off, I understand building codes and liability and all that, yes.

Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to its reputation.  After waiting well over an hour (closer to two) on an extremely packed Sunday afternoon, my girlfriend and I tried the brisket and ribs.\\n\\nThe brisket wasn't exactly horrible but it certainly wasn't the best (especially compared to any of the BBQ restaurants in nearby Lockhart, TX).  Honestly, it was just about on par with any of Houston's mediocre BBQ restaurants (e.g. Good Company, Pappa's BBQ, etc.) with the exception of Rudy's (which is Houston's #1 BBQ restaurant, IMO, despite being something of a \\"big chain\\" restaurant).\\n\\nThe ribs...absolutely pathetic.  Anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of smoked BBQ ribs will tell you that a signature characteristic of good ribs is that it'll practically fall off the bone.  Even Pappasito's (a Tex-Mex restaurant chain) knows how to do this consistently.  Not so at the Salt Lick.  Our ribs were a real pain to chew (on the bone) and nothing close to falling (not even peeling) off the bone.\\n\\nIf I had to guess, I'd wager that at some point in time, the Salt Lick was an excellent BBQ restaurant but perhaps it just got too famous for its britches.  This might explain why their brisket (and especially their ribs) are suffering in quality.  Maybe they can't keep up with the demand and are rushing their smoking process.

This place is right by the convention center and if you are just sick of heavy restaurant meals, this is a great break. I wouldn't say it's worth driving across town for if you have great choices nearby, but if you're close, it's worth a visit.

We got one small fried calamari for an appetizer with marinara sauce and it was delicious. The sauce was flavorful and the fried calamari was crispy. For our entree we got the dinner for two which had a boatload of seafood - shrimp,scallops,calamari,clams,mussels and lobster,served over linguine with your choice of sauce and we went with the spicy red sauce.

It's not like the real thing, and the imperialist US government is responsible. I appreciate their struggle: these continuing complaints are the foodie's main contribution to the Cuba Libre cause, and it's an effective strategy. It's like a very selective hunger strike -- as much of a hunger strike as you could hope to get out of a foodie. They will constantly criticize the cultural competency of Cuban cuisine to anyone who will listen, and their efforts will not cease until Cuban food is truly free to be authentic, from sea to shining sea. \\n\\nSo in support of the foodies fighting to change the US' Cuba policy, I make the following plea: for the love of all that is holy, Barack Obama, please lift the embargo against Cuba; it's the only way to make the whining stop.\\n\\nNow, until victory is achieved, we'll need to find a way to go on living, with or without authenticity.

BET ON eleven AT LOEWS ATLANTA\\n\\nOn midtown's bustling eleventh street, Loews opened April 2010 to give Atlanta one of its newest five star playgrounds.  Once through the doors of this lavishly designed hotel, a classy cosmopolitan feel quickly grabs hold and immerses one into a fashionable comfort.  Its flagship restaurant, eleven offers guests innovative foods that are loosely based on the deconstruction of classic southern recipes. To give these offerings a unique twist in their taste and presentation, Executive Chef Olivier Gaupin infuses a seductive French flair to Chef de Cuisine Derek Rosen's down home Tennessean culinary background.  The blend of these diverse cooking techniques seems to harmonize well giving the foods associated with the South a contemporary facelift that's new and exciting. \\n\\nBefore reaching the tucked away intimate eatery, one is instantly captivated by the sounds and happenings of the posh bar eleven. Each Loews hotel has created a special drink that reflects its milieu and mood.  Sit with one of these many designer libations and magically watch the hustle and bustle of the outside world begin to disappear.   At Loews Atlanta the signature cocktail is the Sage Blossom.  Each refreshing sip of this sassy concoction effortlessly sways the mood to a tranquil state of mind- made with Hanger One Mandarin Blossom Vodka, fresh lemon juice, orange slices and garnished with a sage leaf.  If a non-alcoholic drink is desired get the iced tea, you won't regret it.  Brewed perfectly, this classic southern beverage is served with four house-made flavoring syrups - jasmine, peach, lavender, and raspberry - never knew iced tea could be so gratifying, as well as, fun to play with.  \\n\\nBesides the restaurant, Chef Derek oversees the extensive bar menu, an offering of spruced up southern nibbles, like the cornmeal-fried pickles, that carries over to eleven's awesome menu. The classic soul food - fried green tomatoes - is served with a feisty house-made pimento cheese spread and micro-green cilantro - totally scrumptious!  Rivaling those served in Maryland, the large Savannah style Crab Cake is a mound of delicate moist lump crab with a savory crawfish remoulade - probably the best crab cake in the city, and that's saying something coming from a Marylander.  Showing his playful side, Chef Derek takes the Dr. Seuss classic story Green Eggs and Ham and turns it into a culinary adventure - a deviled egg that's filled with a green basil-QimiQ puree accompanied by house-made bacon and crispy prosciutto window crisps.  Adding an exciting layer to this dish - warm white asparagus is topped with shaved green asparagus and yellow pea shoots with a gastrique made from truffled balsamic crema, chardonnay vinegar, grade A amber maple syrup, and juicy blueberries - this off-menu offering is amazing - ask for it. \\n\\nThe \\"not to be missed\\" signature dish at eleven is the Shrimp and Grits.  Large sweet tasting Carolina shrimp with chunks of a spicy andouille sausage in a corn tomato fondue sauce that's poured over smoked Gouda and cheddar cheese Red Mule Grits.  A pinch of chipotle adds a nice tang to this thrilling classic dish which will stand up to any served in Charleston.  The entree that competes with the house signature dish is the beef short ribs.  After braising for 12 hours with smoked peaches, jalape√±os, pineapple and onions, this fork tender meat is served with a stunning BBQ sauce made from the braising jus. This succulent meat is taken over the top with a side of Yukon potato hash that's served with an explosively delicious chimichuri sauce and cotija cheese - so many mind-blowing flavors to enjoy.

I racked my brain on our options for a weekday breakfast spot. It was still fairly early so we had many to choose from.  I decided on a place in College Park that I'd been to before and had a really good experience.  It was cheap with home-style cooking, which I knew he would love. On our way there I realized there is a much closer spot that I'd been dying to try out...Bananas! I'd heard about their limited parking, but who doesn't have that problem in Orlando. We pulled in and were lucky to get a spot right in front.  We walked in and were happily greeted by the staff and the hostess sat us right away. Our server was over shortly after to take our drink orders and returned with our waters promptly.  We then ordered bloody marys, which we were a little hesitant to order since it's made with a wine based vodka, but they were surprisingly good with the perfect amount of spice and not too thick. I ordered the biscuits and gravy which had fluffy homemade biscuits and my boyfriend had the crab benedict with home fries. I noticed the home fries were a little on the cool side but he didn't complain. We shared a chocolate chip waffle with whip cream which was the perfect breakfast dessert! Before our server dropped our check she offered us some cotton candy and I was like, \\"Did you say cotton candy!! Yes, please!\\"  What a genius idea!! I couldn't decline the offer even if I had just finished eating a chocolate chip waffle and it was still breakfast time.  I mean how often do you get to eat fresh made cotton candy!

Both Universal and Disney are great and have positives that outweigh the negatives.\\n\\nThat said...I love Universal and I was disappointed when I was in Orlando this summer with my daughter and my son forbid us from going (we weren't allowed to go to Harry Potter before him).  There are some really great rides here-including the new Despicable Me Minion Mayhem ride which was simply great.  ET, The Mummy roller coaster, The Simpsons, Men in Black, and the Rockit Roller Coaster...it simply makes for a great day.  I was hoping to see the Beetlejuice Rock and Roll show, but we didn't have time.  We DID however get to see the Blues Brothers performing.  Don't expect them to sound like Belushi and Aykroyd, but the guys were fun and they put on a great show.\\n\\nIf you have the time, I recommend that you not rush through either Universal Studios or Islands of Adventure.  I think you can easily spend a whole day in each park, but I know most people try to squeeze both parks into a single day.  That could get hectic and you'll probably miss something simply because you won't want to wait on the lines.  I also recommend buying the Express Pass and doing the single rider option if you can...both will literally save you hours of waiting in line.\\n\\nBetter than Disney?

There were 3 of us, each having our own entree and splitting two appetizers.

I highly recommend the steamed mussels appetizer with an ice cold Moretti Lager, followed by the Lobster ravioli...magnificent.

My hunger requires immediate satisfaction. I don't care how good people say it is because more often than not it turns out to be merely an overhyped trendy eatery. And yet, against my better judgment, I decided to brave the line and give Totto Ramen a shot. Thank the food gods I did!\\n\\nThere was a girl taking down names outside the restaurant. I waited in line while my friend looked for parking. I fully expected a very long wait. Honestly, I didn't feel we waited that long at all because they called our name just as my friend met back up with me after parking the car. \\n\\nI ordered the paitan ramen with chicken and mushrooms. My friend ordered the extra spicy ramen with pork. We both ordered char siu pork buns.\\n\\nI LOVE pork buns and could easily have a meal consisting of just that. These were wonderful; simple and delicious. The pork had a really nice char crust that reminded me of carnitas. Perhaps it's weird for a Japanese dish to remind me of Mexican food, but it was this similarity and flavor memory that made me love the pork buns even more. \\n\\nMy ramen was perfection, and surprisingly very filling! The chicken broth was rich and flavorful. The chicken itself was juicy and tender. Halfway through my bowl I decided to add a bit of the chile oil that accompanied my friend's spicy ramen. The oil had a very smoky, earthy quality like a dry rub. It also had a slow burn, but a burn nonetheless. A little goes a long way! It ended up giving my ramen a very satisfying kick. \\n\\nOur waitress was so attentive, quick, and friendly. The food came to our table extremely fast. The music (a factor I rarely take note of) playing in the restaurant was surprisingly excellent! \\n\\nOverall, I'm beyond glad I decided to try this place.

The periogis are AWESOME, and they typically have different flavors, so be sure to check those out.  Plus, there is a caramelized onion sauce on top of the perigois that just pulls the whole thing together.\\n\\nBy far the best part is dessert.

My girlfriend just happens to be a classically trained Irish dancer, so we decided this would be a great way to have some food, fun and maybe make some new friends. We arrived around 11am for early lunch. The dancing didn't start till later on, so we had a few drinks and some nosh. \\n     \\n     The beers are always great, and the cocktails are good too. Food is quite Americanized, but tasty all the same. All the dishes have great presentation, and are nicely put together. The only real problem I've ever had with the dining experience are the servers. Some are fantastic, and some aren't. It really just depends on the day. So once the presentation started, they asked the audience if there was any volunteers. We were to do some sort of traditional Irish group dance(Again, the name escapes me). Of course with my girl being a dancer, we jumped up immediately. \\n     \\n     The rest of the day was spent mingling with the dancers, and the host. Most of them were actually from Ireland, which was awesome. We were telling them about where we came from, our trips to the Emerald Isle(We've both been there separately) and they were very friendly and welcoming. Now all of these positive notes do come with a bit of criticism:\\n \\n      It is located in Downtown Disney, which I've found to be an either love it or hate it type venue. When it's not busy, it's not so bad, when it is, you better have read up on your Rosetta Stone. Other than that, it's a great place to eat, drink, and be entertained.

At the time I'm writing this there are 908 reviews of Porter Beer Bar and YET somehow I still feel as though this place flies under the radar. Maybe its because I've never been where there's a wait.

That being said, if you want a little extra attention paid to you by super knowledgeable staff I encourage you to sit at the bar sometime and have a meal/drink. The bartenders are super knowledgeable and for a novice in the beer game like me that's essential. Why, because their drink menu is long and yet long/thorough with page after page of quality selections.\\n\\nTruth be told I've ONLY had the Fish and Chips...which will run you about $12. But the reason is its SO DARN tasty. Worth every penny. I would venture to say on par with what I've had in Iceland (yea I said it) and the fries and tartar sauce aren't just there to be there. They are actually delicious on their own merits. \\n\\nI will say that I came with a friend the other day who ordered the samosas and popcorn. We both liked the popcorn; although if vinegar is not your thing I probably wouldn't suggest it. I didn't try the samosas.

My experience was not so lucky.  \\n\\nUpon arrival and after a short wait, I ordered a Mediterrean Salad with Almond Crusted Tuna as an add-on.  I also asked for the dressing on the side.  When the servers brought our lunches, mine had tuna fish on top...(ew!) so they took it back to the kitchen to have it re-made.  No big deal...happens all the time, right?\\n\\nWell, literally 20 minutes later (I only get an hour for lunch and its a 5 minute walk to/from the office) I meet eyes with the food runner, he turns around to see how much longer it's going to take to make my SALAD!

So I call him over and he says it's going to just take about 2 seconds and he is going to have the manager comp my meal.  Cool beans!\\n\\n10 minutes later...STILL NO FREAKING SALAD!!  It is no 12:40 and I gotta be at work in 20 minutes.  So FINALLY the manager brings me my salad.  THEN HE TRIES TO TAKE OFF WITHOUT EVEN SAYING HE WAS SORRY!  I stop him & ask him about comping my lunch, to which he replies, that he would take care of it.  \\n\\nThen I dig into my salad...and guess what? NO DRESSING!  Luckily the lunch runner comes over to ask how my food is & he runs over to grab some for me real quick.\\n\\nThe salad and tuna were good, but nothing worth waiting 45 minutes for and definitely not worth the $12-$14 it cost.  \\n\\nThen guess what...I need to leave and still no manager.  He sends a different food runner over with about 4 $2 off coupons for me - still no 'sorry'.  I'm beyond ticked at this point - not at the staff - but at the manager.  I take my coupons up to him and tell him I am not interested in coming back and I just want my money back...and besides, 4 $2 off coupons don't even cover how much I spent on that salad.  He takes my receipt and I'm thinking he is running the credit on my credit card.  3 minutes later he comes back with some additional coupons saying he wants me to come back and is sorry.  At this point I am pissed but I gotta go back to work like 5 minutes ago, so I leave.  \\n\\nMANAGEMENT SUCKS! Food is ok but definitely not worth the prices or any kind of wait.

Since we were just having drinks and not dining, we didn't want to take up a table on a busy Friday night so we opted to sit at the bar.  The bar area was very overcrowded (which is typical of a Friday night anywhere in Atlanta).  I did feel like they were trying to fit one too many chairs in the bar area to accomodate everyone sitting down, but it made me feel like I was elbow to elbow with the people next to us.  \\n\\nThe drink menu is great! I thought it was just a wine bar but they actually have a full bar menu. My friend got the sangria (it was red, it had one slice of orange and one lime so if you're the kind of person who likes to eat all the fruit in the glass, this is not the sangria for you), and she said it was really good.  I think it was around $10.  I ordered a lemon drop martini.  I am very specific about my martini's. I don't like a lot of sugar, I'm specific about my vodka, and I know a good one when I taste one.  That was the BEST lemon drop martini I have ever had.  It was $12, but it was a very good portion.  \\n\\nI would definately go again.  I agree with the poster  who said that the crowd is the \\"over 30s crowd\\".  I'm 27 and my friend is 26 and we were absolutely the youngest people there but that didn't bother me at all.  I think the reason for that is because the prices for the food are a little higher than the surrounding places (think Canoe).  Not a lot of people under 30 can just throw down $70 for dinner/drinks for two.  Hence the older crowd, they simply can afford it =)\\n\\nI actually prefer the crowd.

Our waitress returned noticed my fries hadn't arrived and said she would go figure out what the wait was, she came back to inform us she had never placed the side item but just did and would put a rush on the order.

It seemed that a number of their breakfast choices that could hold their own without bread. I had the huevos rancheros with a side of homemade black refried beans, sour cream, and homefries (which I subbed for fries b/c of my allergy to cumin). The eggs were delicious on top of perfectly crisp tortillas, with lightly crunchy edges. This is not your typical fried taco salad bowl masquerading as traditional huevos rancheros! My only criticism is that they used sub-par salsa, which wasn't bad but I dropped a star because everything else had a cooked with love feeling except the bland & salty jarred salsa. I'll also admit I'm a huge fan of hot sauce and super spicy pepper style salsa so it was a little disappointing given the quality of everything else. I also give the roof top atmosphere a \\"WhooHoo! As good as it gets!\\" rating. The weather was perfect today, bright with a nice breeze... if I wasn't ruled by the parking meter I would have stayed and drank cocktails all afternoon.

I (and four of my friends) specifically went there on a fact-finding mission to try their burgers, which we were fascinated by after reading a blog post that describes how they're made (the blog post was linked from Serious Eats' 'A Hamburger Today' blog when I read it).  \\n\\nI have to say that the burger is pretty awesome - second maybe to the burger I had at Upstairs on the Square, but I'd have to try the Upstairs burger again to really be sure...  Back to Craigie - the burger lives up to its name: it's not too greasy (Four Burgers), perfectly cooked, and really wonderfully flavorful.  My palate is not quite sophisticated enough to taste the sumac ketchup in the presence of the beef and onions flavors, but possibly the burger could have done a bit better with a little acidity in the ketchup.  It's also quite hefty: I didn't eat anything after that until the next afternoon!  We also had some pigs' tails, which were not the best accompaniment to the burgers, perhaps, as they are on the heavy side, but they were delicious nonetheless.\\n\\nLike others have mentioned, I found the sweet potato fries really difficult to eat, and I prefer fries with more starchy softness in the middle than the potato stick kind.  The salad was lovely, though - a dressed-up version of the salad that comes with the steak at Central Kitchen.\\n\\nOn service: we had much better service than I had the last time I came, though I still think the waiting area is beyond awkward because there isn't really one: people resort to standing in the handicapped ramp, in the doorway, in front of the hostess stand, and are generally in the way wherever they stand.  The service, though, was not pretentious like it was the last time, but attentive without being overbearing (unlike the overzealous service at Gaslight).  Water glasses were refilled whenever necessary, service didn't seem hectic or hurried (I hate when servers are rushing around everywhere; it ruins any chance the you'll have a relaxing time).  We felt especially pampered by the insertion of a few surprise bites: an amuse bouche before dinner, and a few sweet bites at the end - the standout was a tea-infused (assam tea, I think, but my memories are a bit hazy) panna cotta that was on the acidic side - it must have had yogurt or creme fraiche in it.  I have to say that I dislike the tiny madeleines that come with the check, but that's a personal blanket dislike - I just find that the smaller the madeleine, the drier it gets.  To conclude regarding service, I wonder if the difference in service was just a matter of Craigie hitting its stride, or whether it's just better to have a larger party?  I guess time will tell.  Oh, one other thing - I love that the bar at Craigie is open late - in fact, our reservation was for 9:30pm and though we were seated promptly, we didn't make it out until nearly 12am.\\n\\nA word to other reviewers (this is not directed to the restaurant): though Craigie is delightful, it isn't a neighborhood place.

Those were good memories and I remember the margherita pizza was especially good in its simplicity that made the quality of the ingredients really stand out. I don't think you can go wrong with any pizza served here at Antico, and another great thing is you can order them to go! The place gets very crowded so it's tough to find a seat. Sometimes it can get to a point where you have to hover behind/near a group that seems to be almost finished...

The French toast was the perfect sweetness paired with a good coffee. Not too overwhelming but sweet enough to treat yourself! The shrimp and grits had a bite to it and was paired perfectly with a sauce that blankets the dish. This place is great for kids and the whole staff was so welcoming and helpful.

The ponzu sauce on it was salty and there was no hint of lemon at all. Most of the fish especially the Saba sushi smelled very fishy. $3 for a piece of sushi, which is  a typical price, but man with a very tiny portion?? Spicy tuna roll was not that good neither. Have had better..way better. Skip the sushi and go for pork gyoza, cheesecake and Japanese green tea creme brulee. They were pretty good.

I've been lucky enough to have dined at some incredibly high end restaurants through my 32 years of travel, leisure, and business. Some one off restaurants, some high end chains, and everything in between. I have to tell you that from a quality, consistency, and experience perspective, Ruth Chris is top 3, if not the best I've experienced. I've been to Ruth Chris 8-9 times in the last few years. We have been there for my fiances birthdays the last few years, to celebrate my moms bday, to celebrate her selling her house, and also just recently to celebrate me and my fiance's engagement. Each time, we get sat immediately and our table is setup with either birthday or congrats confetti. Just a nice warm touch for a celebration. The service is always very good. The best, no. But so close that it doesn't really matter much. The ambiance and environment there is top notch. Very dim and elegant. It's a perfect setting for a wonderful meal to celebrate anything, or to just have a wonderful meal. \\n\\nNow to the food. Let's be honest, no one goes to a restaurant that is incredibly beautiful, elegant, and top notch if the food is sub par. The food has to be good and that's the key part of any dining experience. Here is where I'd rate Ruth Chris as the true game changer in the food game. They have some of the best food, if not the best, that I've ever had at any restaurant in any continent or area I've been in. You go here for the steak. And the steak is the best steak I've had ever. Consistently every time I go. the steak is the best I've had. The sides, while top notch, are comparable to a few other places I've been in terms of just being out of this world good. But I have not found a place that quite matches the steak. Here is what we usually get. We start with an appetizer of shrimp cocktail and the veal osso buco ravioli. The shrimp are huge and are as fresh and as succulent as you could ask for. The veal osso buco ravioli are filled beautifully and are drenched in a bold brown sauce that ends up being perfect for dipping their amazing bread in. We then usually get soups. They vary based on when you go, but they always have their lobster bisque and personally, that's my true favorite. It's a perfect consistency and unlike other bisque's have had, it actually has a fair amount of lobster in it. You have the option of spending extra money to get some sherry on the side for it and it compliments it nicely as well. We then get the meals. I always get the filet mignon. You cannot go wrong with it. It's a perfectly tender and cooked piece of heaven every time. Their claim to fame is that they come on a 500 degree plate and I can attest to the fact that not only does it keep the steak as hot as it was coming off the grill until the last bite every time, but it doesn't overcook it while you're eating it. It's a perfect temperature to keep it hot through the entire eating experience without cooking it further. And it's pretty obvious, but this place knows how to cook a steak. So if you like medium rare, but you're afraid it's like every other restaurant that over cooks steak, don't worry...you'll get it perfectly cooked to your liking every single time. As for sides, they are a la carte, meaning you don't get sides that come with your steak, you have to order them separately. But their sides are HUGE, so definitely share them. We usually always get the lobster mac and chz which is the best side I've ever had. We got the hash brown pie side once, but it was too crisp on the outside and not cooked enough on the inside for our liking. I don't see it on their menu anymore so they might not have it any longer. But they promptly replaced it with a new side of our choice. We got the mashed potatoes and they were phenomenal. We also have gotten the baked potato and it was incredible as well. The asparagus is huge and cooked perfectly too. So you can't really go wrong with the sides. And to top it off, usually we're too full, but we did get dessert a few times and it's just like everything else, amazing. You can't go wrong with whatever you choose. \\n\\nIn closing, if you can afford to go here regularly, it's worth every penny every time. But if you can only afford to go to a restaurant of this price and caliber once in a while, make sure you choose Ruth Chris in Boston for your finest of celebrations. Whether it's something annual like a birthday or anniversary, or it's something monumental like right after an engagement ask, you can count on Ruth Chris to provide you with the best food you've ever had in a wonderfully romantic and elegant setting with solid service. I couldn't possibly recommend this place more. \\n\\nOn a side note - Alexandra the GM is amazing. She will take care of you as will any of their staff. And if you can get Kate as a server, you'll be in great hands as well."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"45 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Favorite steak place..

It's not Bacchanalia-level expensive, but it is pricey for what you get. Some of us ordered the arugula salad which looked like a pathetic piece of old arugula lettuce squished on a plate and doused in olive oil and (too much) lemon juice. I ordered a pasta dish, the lobster special with pappardelle, and it was so-so. The lobster meat was so not succulent - it was pretty weak. The sauce tasted liek it had been sitting in a pot for a few hours. The pasta was overcooked. None of my other dinner companions were happy with their dishes, either. The presentation of every plate we ordered was horrendous as well. For what you pay at this place, the food should be presented nicely (not just thrown onto the plate haphazardly - my friend's veal scaloppine looked like mystery meat, seriously), should taste better than mediocre, and the service should be at least decent.

My son who usually doesn't like Thai food loved the khao soi Kai very much! As a non curry lover, even I had to admit it was delicious! The wings and pork belly were also very delicious and drenched in flavor. \\nEnjoyable, indescribably delicious meal!

We had a lovely time celebrating my sister's birthday with dinner and drinks at Strega.  The atmosphere is grand and upbeat.\\n\\nThe restaurant seems to have no trouble filling their large number of tables and seats for dinner. It was full capacity when we went on a Tuesday night.  The large number of people and the noise levels compliment the restaurant.  All of the patrons and employees are extremely cheerful.  \\n\\nThe white table cloths, dark wood interior, low lighting, and upbeat jazz playing added to the upscale setting.  There are large windows along the walls, which allow you to watch the goings on of the city and waterfront.\\n\\nThe menu has a great selection of seafood and Italian dishes.  Our table split a bunch of delicious dishes:\\n\\n1. The meatball appetizer- the meatball is quite large.  To be honest, the ricotta cheese in this dish stole the show.  It tasted homemade and a bit sweeter than typical ricotta.\\n\\n2. Prosciutto-wrapped shrimp over pineapple appetizer - Very good.  The pineapple tasted like it was picked from Hawaii that morning.\\n\\n3. Lobster Mac & Cheese Entree- Definitely the best dish we ordered- extremely generous portions of lobster meat in the pasta.  The cheese blend was perfect.  The dish was cooked in a skillet so the pasta was crispy on the top and creamy on the bottom.  10/10!\\n\\n4. Lobster Ravioli - Nothing stood out to me.  It tasted like most other lobster ravioli dishes I've ordered elsewhere.\\n\\n5. Special: Surf n Turf- the filet was divine, cooked to perfection, excellent consistency.  The stuffed lobster was just okay.  I felt that the overly-breaded stuffing was unnecessary.  It actually took away from the lobster tail's flavor.  I would recommend asking for the dish without the stuffing!\\n\\n6. Dessert: Tiramisu- delicious!\\n\\nOur server was perfectly attentive and welcoming.  He went out of his way to accommodate us and make food recommendations.  I am confident that his warm personality is the standard at Strega Waterfront.  I will be happy to go back any time!"},{"name":"Kal√©","address":"50 SW Pine St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I absolutely love this spot!

I can't believe the cook would even hand the girl raw bacon to give to me. We decided to just eat the burger minus the bacon at this point we didn't want to wait any longer.

Forcing whoever I was with to go here every time we were in Orlando ( from Miami) for a UCF football or basketball game- so a couple times a month throughout the season. It had become a tradition.\\nLast saturday, 10/30, before the UCF/ECU game we drove up from Miami and went straight to Kyoto.  Long story short- the cook on the hibachi grill thought it was a wise idea to cook every hibachi meal whose ticket he'd rec'd in about a 15-20 minute time span at one time. Turns out we were one of the first ones received, therefore having to sit and wait for my food for 35 minutes (according to the time on our receipt). I was already angry as this is a FAST causal establishment  and that is a LONG time even  for the fine dining restaurant I work for.  I had ordered steak-medium rare- The steak came to the table nothing less then VERY well done.  I pointed this out to our flustered waitress who put in another order for steak. After this I received Teriyaki steak NOT hibachi as I had ordered and now waited 45 minutes for.  I brought this up to the grill myself after finding out the manager was the cook on the grill and asked him basically what the deal was. First he actually blamed the wait for the food on our waitress (GREAT move for a Mgr) that it had been ready and she had never run it- which is funny because I'd been watching him make it and finish it the whole time with the other 12 orders. Then he also proceeded to tell me that the steak always has teriyaki- also funny because its never had it on it the other 17 times I've ordered it...hmmm...To say I lost my temper would be an understatement as we were LATE into the game that we drove 4+ hours to get to even though we were at a restaurant ON CAMPUS with over an hour before we needed to be in the stadium- Thank you Kyoto and Management for not only making me late to the game, but for forcing me to find a new place to look forward to going to.

Service was good by both gentleman, we were very happy to not have experienced the man others had complained out which is why we made sure to ask for the waiter's name. We are very glad we tried the place out, because the food was definitely darn good. We had the lamb chops, which always makes me very happy when I'm at a good Indian restaurant. We also tried the Colombi Shrimp which was seriously delicious, their Palak Paneer was one of the best ones I've had. Their Butter chicken was very delish, great flavor, but I'm use to it being a bit more creamier. We took the left overs home and our friend just happened to have cream so we added some the next day it was beyond perfect. We ordered everything with a medium heat, and they seriously nailed it. Everything was nicely spiced, had a kick without making our meal uncomfortable to enjoy. We love spicy heat. The plain naan and the garlic naan was good, though I do prefer mine with a quick rub of ghee after it comes out of the tandoor oven, none the less still very good, just different. We wobbled out of the restaurant stuffed to the gills. Definitely yummy for our tummy....

In September of last year, I took my (now)girlfriend here for our first date (it worked!). Sitting down at 8:30 and being the last ones to leave, we had a long romantic meal, served excellently by a gentleman who is still there. Last weekend, we repeated our experience almost identically.\\n\\nOver the two meals, we tasted the following:\\n\\n- Chef's Charcuterie Plate: big and delicious. We had to take this to-go even though it was our first dish because had we finished it, we'd have been too full for the rest.\\n\\n- Insalata Caesar: well balanced flavors, not too much dressing, shaved parmesan and white anchovies. Simple and easy, but amazing when done well (like this!)\\n\\n- Raviolone Aperto: one of their \\"signature\\" dishes, this is a must-have if you/your party has the appetite, or if ordered as a main dish. It is indeed very seafoody, so if that's not your flavor of choice, you may prefer the next one.\\n\\n- Rigatoni alla Bolognese: sooo good. This was my favorite. Once again a simple dish, but when perfectly done, scrumptious. The sauce is smooth, the pasta cooked just right. Reminded me of my grandmother's cooking.\\n\\n- Ossobuco di Maiale: This we had both times. Also big, it came home with us both times, too. But man oh man is it tasty. Rich. Heavy. Makes you go to sleep afterwards. And, believe me, you'll be hard pressed to have a better breakfast than this the day after with sunny-side-up fried eggs.\\n\\n- Tiramisu: both times, arrived at our table on the house. Full disclosure, I ordered celebration-calibre wine, so that may have made it easier for the server to swing, but it was a very nice touch, and very good. Just the way I like it, chilled and soft with barely any cake and lots of coffee.\\n\\nOverall, the food is simple and very well done, bringing out the straightforward pleasure of uncomplicated flavors - one of my favorite ways to eat.\\n\\nThe service in my experience has been phenomenal. We were seated at the same table one year later, the same waiter. He let us take our time, serving the wine (very decent list btw) before taking our food order, always waiting until we were clearly done before moving on to the next course, we never felt rushed. I'm sure if you want to speed things up, they'll oblige, but when you want a long relaxed meal and the service supports that, it makes all the difference.\\n\\nAmbiance really is just the icing on the cake.

The two times I've been to Pure, there have been complementary chips and salsa on the table before I could even get my jacket off.  I have always been seated relatively quickly and my food has always come out in an appropriate amount of time.\\n2. Deals! They don't really advertise this, but on Tuesdays they sell their fish, pork, chicken, and veggie tacos for $2 a piece.  This is the way to go. The fish taco is my favorite.  It seems to stay together the best, while other ones like the veggie are bound to fall apart. I also really like the sauce and slaw on the fish taco.\\n3. Black beans! Their black beans are supremely delicious. I suggest coming on a Tuesday and ordering 2 fish tacos and a side of black beans.  You'll come out with a bill around $6. Can't beat that.\\n\\nThe negatives\\n1. Spicy! I'm a baby when it comes to spicy food.  Most things at Pure from the salsa to the vegetables to the chicken are a tad too spicy. One of my dinner buddies who loves spicy food even noted that she was guzzling water all night to compensate for the spice attack.\\n2. Me oh my 2 fish tacos and beans for $12! So besides the occasional good deal, Pure is slightly over priced.  Again, come on Tuesday and you can get tacos for $2 a piece. They have a few entrees for $10 which is a bit more reasonable. \\n3. Parking! They have \\"complementary valet\\" which we all know is really like $3 parking.  They also have a lot that manages to be full at all times.

As a result, you often don't get that meticulous consistency of portions and assembly that you might find with a more veteran crew. The Davis Square location is a bit more like the wild west of burrito making (which is appropriate, since Chipotle started in Denver).\\n\\nThe good news is this is a restaurant where everything is assembled right in front of you. If you don't get enough pinto beans, ask for more. It's your burrito. The staff here is always super friendly; they won't mind.\\n\\nAnd the flip side of that coin is that you might get way more meat, or better yet, guacamole, than the typical, franchise-approved serving. That's what makes coming here worth it. The one risk is the dreaded re-wrap, which mixes the ingredients up too much for my taste, and always loses some guac in the process.

The Porter's selection TRULY is heads and tails above all the rest. I can't say that I'm a big eater at the place though I always get one thing consistently -- the garlic fries -- which are better than any kind of potato I've ever had prepared, lol. And the goat cheese fritters. Yeah, yeah, you're thinking, 'goat cheese?'  Yes! Goat cheese. They are amazing. If Porter would deliver them a mile away to my home I'd probably eat them every evening with or without beer. They are scrumptious! \\n\\nThe design of the Porter is also cozier than any of the other top beer bars you'll find. The top/back room bar of the Brick Store in Decatur is its only rival in this respect. This mom and pop is nice, close and intimate. Not an airy showroom like the other corporate beer chains-yuck. \\n\\nAll of this said, I'm giving the Porter one star. Here's why. The Porter is located in Little Five Points Atlanta, the most progressive neighborhood in Atlanta that is also ethnically mixed and diverse. It's THE place to hang and live if you're living inside the city. As someone born, raised and educated in Atlanta I'm very proud of what we've overcome and what we've built with Little Five Points, home to the funkiest, coolest, most eclectic shops you'll find in most of the southern United States.\\n\\nSo when I have to walk through a picket line packed with people charging the Porter with racism and sexism, I don't like it. But the goat cheese fritters call so I do (don't snark, you would too if you'd munched on the goat cheese fritters). \\n\\nOnce I'm inside and waiting I spy something I didn't expect and the reason I won't be having another goat cheese fritter anytime soon. If ever. The Black staff are wearing shirts that read, 'I'm Black and work at the Porter'.\\n\\nI guess it's possible that they wanted to put on those hideous and insulting shirts but I just can't fathom that.

I think Giacomo's is only so famous because Rachel Ray came here for one of her TV shows and gave it rave reviews.  I've eaten here several times and I always find myself starting off with a bottle of house pinot grigio.  Honestly, it's got to be the cheapest in the North End and surprisingly pretty good!  I highly suggest it.  The bread that they serve you with each meal is absolutely delicious.  I could eat it all day.  The meal I have ordered the most amount of times is the pumpkin tortellini...it's always absurdly good and has never, ever disappointed me.  I've come here with others that have ordered various seafood dishes and they have had nothing but great things to say about their food as well.  The prices here are def some of the most reasonable in the North End and the portions are huge and filling.  However, the space itself is really small...you may even find yourself (uncomfortably) sitting at a table that is literally 6 inches away from a table full of stangers (hence the long lines outside...which, I will say, tend to move fairly quickly though).  Service is always rushed here, too.  This is not a place to spend hours or even one hour...it's chew & screw or your server will make you feel like you're an asshole for not leaving right after you finish paying.

For me, it's never been my favorite place, but the atmosphere is always fantastic and very suitable for either a romantic dinner or two to four good friends gathered around the table, gnashing over a plate of appetizers or enjoying a hearty soup or stew while grabbing a few minutes out of the cold.\\n\\nThe surroundings are that of an old-style neighborhood tavern - with a large rectangular bar in the center-back surrounded by a host of two-top and four-top tables along the edges and throughout the front half of the restaurant.\\n\\nThe walls are red brick with a few mementos tacked on, GD Ritzy's-style - but it's far from garish or awkward. In fact, it's more reminiscent of an old barrister's den which he converted from a den into a sitting room for brandy with old college chums.\\n\\nYet - with all that said - the Olde Mohawk is free of pretension. The crowd may or may not be affluent and well-educated - but for most, this isn't the matter of the day - it's hanging out and eating good food.\\n\\nSo, let's get onto the food, right?\\n\\nWe ordered the Sweet Potato Tots with a Sriracha-Ranch dipping Sauce. Well, everything was exactly what you'd expect and nothing that you'd expect at the same time. The tots were crispy on the outside and gave way to a tender and sweet yam inside. The dipping sauce was creamy with the very slightest hint of spice - neither taste was overpowering and the Tots felt at home with or without the sauce.\\n\\nOur entrees came just as we finished our appetizer. I ordered the Crab and Shrimp Cajun Pasta and my friend ordered the House Special, a baked lasagna.\\n\\nHe'd had the lazana before and he's a big fan of that, too.\\n\\nLike I said, the Olde Mohawk WASN'T one of my favorite German Village places to visit before this. I like both Katzinger's and Schmidts - so maybe I'm a bit more traditional and a lot more low-key, edging towards classy fast food [Noodles, Piada, Chipotle].\\n\\nToday, however, it was a sea-change for me.

This is especially true in the Dirty South, where authentic, jaw-dropping pizza can be as easy to score as unobtanium.*\\n\\nRejoice, pizza fiends--manna from the gods hath arrived! You've no doubt been regaled with stories of Antico and their amazing pies. Fret not, Flava Flav: BELIEVE THE HYPE.\\n\\nNestled on the corner of Hemphill Ave. (so named after the divine Shirley Hemphill of \\"What's Happening\\" fame), Antico was teeming with diners the night I waded in. What's novel about Antico is that you order in front, and dine in either the small room to the side, or back in the kitchen. Given my parameters, I chose a community table in the kitchen and discovered with joy that they pipe in Italian opera over the PA. I watched as sweaty men thrust their obscenely long pie turners into giant ovens. Delightful! All that was missing was Joe Pesci becoming irate and stabbing someone with a pen.\\n\\nI planned on downing a slice or two. Once the steaming pie arrived, however, I knew I was in trouble. The Margherita pizza was a marvel of restraint, its ingredients, few, but top-notch: San-Marsano Tomato, Bufala Mozzarella, Basil, Garlic, and Dough. That's it. \\"Where's the high fructose corn syrup,\\" you ask? \\"Is there crazy bread,\\" you also ask? Sorry. Antico keeps it simple and the result is perfection.\\n\\nFrom the first bite, I experienced a sort of transubstantiation; the pizza turned mythic and holy, and at once I regretted the nights spent grazing Pizza Hut while watching Stargate SG-1. Nubile cheese, gurgling sauce, and dough the purity of Justin Bieber meshed into a symphony of delight.\\n\\nI finished the first slice, polished a second, inhaled a third, mainlined a fourth, crammed a fifth, and soldiered through a sixth, leaving two slices and a table of strangers worried I'd detonate. I started wrapping the remaining slices up, but--NO LIE--they began to coo, \\"Eeeeeat us. Eeeeeeat us NOW.\\" \\n\\nIt was the Tell-Tale Pizza, and I was weak. I ate the whole thing. By myself. In Barack Obama's America. Such is the power of Antico.\\n\\nSo by all means, GO, but PLEASE use caution.

How to review it.\\n\\nSo - for breakfast options - I have a terrible sweet tooth. Their waffles are great! Get the loaded waffle. Blueberries and strawberries and bananas and whip cream and syrup... oh my. Oh yes.\\n\\nBut their pancakes leave a lot to be desired. This is definitely the pancake snob in me talking - but their pancakes are just overly dense and not good in general. Pancakes should be light and fluffy! Theirs are not. Not good. They have the density of a towel soaked in water. Bleh. You could slap somebody with these things and it'd hurt. I was impressed that they were able to cook them all the way through when they were so freaking thick and dense - but that in no way makes them good. The varieties they serve aren't anything special either. Banana and walnut? Really? No. M&M/Reese's/Snickers pancakes? Gross.\\n\\nService at breakfast tends to be good, probably mostly because it's so quiet.\\n\\nFor lunch - vegetarians aren't really allowed. If you do happen to be vegetarian - you have to design your own sandwich or get a breakfast meal. I chose the former, which essentially ended up being me saying \\"give me everything on it that wasn't once walking\\". It was pretty good - but just not enough food for the money. I'm told their more meaty lunch options are very good though.\\n\\nService at lunch is not so good. I've always been greeted by the super stressed out young waitress who snaps at you like a drill Sergeant. Please don't beat me up ms. waitress. I just want to eat. Is that so wrong? But I've never actually been waited on by the angry one - and the other waitresses have been very nice.\\n\\nTheir website is... awful. Among the worst I have ever seen. Words cannot describe it. Bad in all ways possible. Worst of all is their \\"funny stories\\" section where they tell the tale of a dog getting blown up by a stick of dynamite because he thought he was supposed to fetch it for his master like he would a normal stick. Hahahahaha oh man so funny. This look of disgust I'm giving your website is really me just hiding all my jolly belly laughs.\\n\\nSo in short - If you go here for breakfast - get an omelette or a waffle. Do not get the pancakes. For the love of all things fluffy DO NOT GET THE PANCAKES. If you go here for lunch - don't be afraid of the crabby waitress who hates her life almost as much as she hates you. But also - don't go here for lunch if you're a vegetarian. Don't do this to yourself.\\n\\nSo - in the end, I can give this one neither a thumbs up or a thumbs down. I'm giving it a cock-eyed sideways thumb with an evil eye."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Have been twice.

For about 20 bucks you can get a giant pizza that will fill two people. My favorite option here is the Diavaolo (aka Diavola) pizza. The Diavola is a hearty meaty love fest of sopressata, pepperonata and bufala with little tiny spice bombs of sweet heat in the form of Calabrian peppers (little spicy red peppers from a region of Italy called Calabria). The seeds are still hibernating in these deceptively puny peppers so watch out...or if you're a masochist you can add more of them (at which point, scientifically speaking, you might have an adrenaline deficiency you little risk taker you). Antico's awesome self-service station in the back is where you can also get more garlic, parmesan, basil, olive oil and anything else I'm forgetting.\\n\\nMy second favorite pizza here, if you want something slightly less spicy, is the San Gennaro. Named after the patron saint of Naples, where pizza was supposedly invented, this pizza is a crowd pleaser and Di Palma came up with it himself. This pizza is made up of salsiccia (sausage), sweet red peppers, fior di latte (cow's milk mozzarella), fresh bufala (mozzarella made from the milk of the Italian water buffalo) and cipolline (onions but actually the bulb of the grape hyacinth and so also go by the name wild onions).\\n\\nThe pizzas are made in ridiculously hot Italian Acunto wood-burning ovens that hit 900 degrees F. Acunto ovens are hand-made traditional Neapolitan ovens. These ovens are the secret ingredient to getting that perfect smokey and crispy char on the outer crust while keeping the inside of the crust, dough, and toppings perfectly done. It's the equivalent of a raw steak hitting a properly pre-heated pan to get that perfect seared crust on the outside while keeping the inside slowly cooking. But not too slow, these pizzas get done in about 100 seconds once they hit that oven so start hunting for a spot (it's harder than you'd think) to chow down and get your booze (or juice box, vino, vino juice box) as soon as you order. Seriously, the pizza comes out VERY quickly and next thing you know you're THAT guy, stuck with a soon to be lukewarm pizza bigger than your first born child, doing a little awkward dance in the corner. \\n\\nI think they still take reservations... but a day in advance (not necessary if just two people). I love that they are open for lunch and dinner Monday through Saturday from 11:30 a.m. until \\"the dough runs out\\" although I've been here for dinner at a variety of times and the dough has never run out...but still clever and good to know. Parking is fine, especially now that Di Palma is kinda turning the whole area into a \\"Little Italy\\" (how adorbz! OMG) so there are multiple little lots to choose from now. Call me weird, but I actually really like coming here on rainy nights because there's no line out the door. A little rain, some vino from a plastic cup, and a Diavola. Only downside being that every time it rains now I crave pizza. Shwoops.

After the visit, we needed food NOT from the bar at the track.  Thankfully, my brother-in-law had Polonia in mind, and, after driving in a circle from the nearby track, we arrived at this little slice of Poland.\\n\\nPolonia's a weird little house-like building in a strip mall parking lot that may have been another kind of restaurant years ago.  Hole-in-the-wall, yes.  Inside the front door, there's a deli counter and cash register where you can catch a glimpse of and buy the fresh kielbasa and blood sausage made on site.  Off to the right is the dining area -- pretty spartan.  Just tables and chairs, but perfectly comfortable given that warm, wholesome food you're about to eat.\\n\\nIt should be noted that Polonia's prices are a little higher now than what they advertise on their website's menu.  Non-sandwich items start at $10.  Appetizers were $4 - $5 and up.  Sandwiches start at $8 and go up.\\n\\nI tried the Wazanki dish -- truly a wonderful comfort food of cabbage, bacon, noodles, and kielbasa.  Alas, for $10, I would've loved to have about half portion more.  It was THAT good.\\n\\nMy wife enjoyed the roast beef sandwich and homemade potato salad.  She thought the bread was a little doughy, but I thought it was the best fresh roast beef sandwich I'd ever put in my mouth.  Other dishes sampled by my family included the pierogis, stuffed cabbage, sauerkraut, and potato pancakes.\\n\\nI also enjoyed the Polish beer -- the Warka at $5 was probably the best deal on the menu.  A truly awesome wheat beer, I almost had to pry it from my brother-in-law's hands.  My sister almost over-enjoyed the Polish honey wine.  The waitress advised her against a second glass if she was gonna be driving.\\n\\nFor two people (my wife and I), it cost about $36 with tip.

The waitstaff were exceptionally accommodating, and seemed like they wanted to make the experience memorable. But, some thing seemed deceptive. Cutting to the story, my fiancee and I ordered two hamburgers, which we were told was not on the menu, but we ordered them anyway. While we waited for our meals we observed filled tables with parties sipping wine, while an open kitchen with animated chefs cooked and prepared orders for their patrons. When our meals arrived, I took a bite out of the hamburger and was at a loss. It occurred to me, that this hamburger was like every other bar burger I have ever eaten from any dive bar to average burger joint. It was not that great, but just average. I'm not sure where all the hype is coming from. When looking at dessert, the waiter mentioned that we should get two deserts because we can share them, and they are just that amazing. I took another chance, but maybe I was suckered into something again. After the fact, the dessert was very good, but still the overall experience was average at best. When the check arrived, I was taken back by how much the total bill came to for two hamburgers and two desserts. In sum, I wasn't really happy with our experience at Craigie On Main.

Elliott, the young man who helped us with room service and all of these deliveries, was super nice and helpful.\\n\\nThe hotel wasn't super busy the night we were there, which I'm sure allowed the staff to do extra for us.

The restaurant has a nice modern atmosphere.  Roomy enough but I can see where it would get crowded during peak hours.  One thing to realize is that this restaurant does close between lunch and dinner meals.  We showed at 2:55pm with only five minutes to go before the kitchen closed.  I would have liked to have know that before we showed since we really didn't have time to scan the menu.  In our panic we opted for what we know should have been good.  The Pad Thai and Green Curry.  The service was friendly, but I got the rushed feeling since we were encroaching on the close of the lunch rush.  We got our appetizer quickly but had to ask for utensils to eat it.  I am not a service snob or a needy diner, but it does help to have something to eat with.  For me service is about the details that most would never even notice.  The Pad Thai was very good, though not a lot of noodles but ample chicken and the sauce was full of flavor.  The curry was sort of watery, I sort of got the feeling that they watered down left overs rather than making a little more.  It tasted alright, but I had doubts about being worth sending back.  The portions are slightly smaller than elsewhere, but the price is a little lower than most.  My wife prefers larger portions, but we usually have left overs so I would rather have smaller portions at a lower price.  My daughter loves Thai tea so when we were leaving she really wanted to take the cup with her, the staff took charge and gave us a to-go cup for her which I thought was excellent.  \\n\\nOverall, I think this has a grand potential if we planned our visit around their open hours.  As a rule I do not expect great service near closing time.  We will definitely give this a redeeming chance to get four stars or even five."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"My boyfriend took me to this restaurant for my birthday and we had an excellent time.

Compared to Journeyman, another great restaurant with a tasting menu, Craigie on Main's portions are larger and more filling.

We had already waited much longer even with a reservation so I didn't want to send it back. The French toast itself is sweet alone. Then once you add additional toppings it taste like a cinnamon roll. I liked the fish but wished it was warm. Additionally, in order to avoid waiting for a long time, make a reservation through yelp. This restaurant is very popular so be prepared for a wait if you don't have a reservation. Parking can be a hassle too.

It's very unassuming from the outside and does look like a house.  The decor and vibe inside was anything but a house.  It was very warm, cozy, modern and filled with the beats that the DJ was spinning. \\n\\nIn the beginning the service was prompt and attentive.  We placed our order:\\n\\n2 salads (the ceasar + the pickled ginger)\\nCrispy Chicken with Fried Rice\\nGarlic Tofu Noodles\\n\\nThe salads were brought in a fair amount of time and were both tasty.  About 20 minutes later our waiter comes out and announces that the Chef forgot to mention to the wait staff that they did not have any 1/2 chickens to make the Crispy Chicken.  He did suggest a next option and I went for it.  Oh did I mention my dining partner is Vegan?  Well, we did tell our waiter that at the start and he was very helpful as we ordered. Until they brought us some chicken on a bone, compliments of the Chef, for the previous snafu.  Too bad it didn't meet the dietary needs of our entire party.  They then asked us if we wanted cocktails (free of charge) and we did not take them up on the offer.  Instead they delivered 2 Spritzers on the house.  Soon after this our food was brought to us. The food was good, but my dining partner's food was cold.  Why?  Cuz his was ready, when they found out they did not have what I ordered.  Did they try to recover for the mix up?  Yes, but we would have been a lot happier if they kept the chicken on a bone thing and the sprizter's in the kitchen and comp'd some our our bill.  Instead, we still paid $60 (that includes a tip) for dinner with zero alcoholic drinks.\\n\\nWill we go here again?  There is a good chance, but no guarantee.\\n\\nGood luck and I hope you have a better experience than we did.\\n\\nSuch is life!\\n\\nDid I mention that Ludacris is a partner in this place?

It came on a bed of olives, eggplant, zucchini and tomato in a balsamic dressing. The cheese itself was dressed with a sweet red pepper sauce. Amazing! Unfortunately this is not on the menu, It really should be, if any staff member reads this please please put this on the menu. \\n\\nThe main reason this restaurant does not rate higher for me is because of the mains. I got the sausage rigatoni in a spice vodka sauce. I didnt really think much of it. Although I enjoyed it and ate it, I had eaten the whole plate without really a second thought!  At $18 for a small-ish pasta main i thought it was overpriced. \\n\\nWe tried a sample of some desserts. They were all good.\\n\\nIf you are in the area its definately worth checking out.

On our past visit, we were seated right away and our orders were taken. It was right before the show so we were expecting our food to take a little longer. However, we didn't expect to wait an hour and 15 minutes like we did. We were actually about to walk out when we finally saw our food. We were starved and went to take immediate bites and noticed something was off. My husband requested sweet potato fries but got regular fries. No biggie. We both ordered veggie burgers (since this was our favorite spot for that all over town) and they were both entirely wrong. Like completely different orders! We waved down the server to tell her and she said that it was exactly what we ordered. I showed her an example of cutting what was supposed to be fried goat cheese and it was a crab cake. My husband wanted the buffalo burger but instead had bbq sauce, cheese, and bacon on it. What? She finally realized we were right and we had to wait another 10 minutes for our right order. We were still excited but when we bit into the burgers, we realized they have completely changed it to an in-house type of burger - mushy bean type of patty. It had no form and was just not any good. We felt completely ripped off and unsatisfied. Our server said it's not her fault but the people in the kitchen (?) so not to blame her but she'll give us a free desert.

If you stand in line for decent but completely ordinary food you get what you deserve. Explore the neighbor...go to Salem St which runs parallel to Hanover. Many of the restaurants there are just as good, less crowded and will treat you like a guest rather than something to be fleeced. Or go down the other end of Hanover and treat yourself to some fine dining. It's more expensive but many of the places charge what they're worth. There's another restaurant not far from Giacomo's but it's a local secret.

Really fun, it's certainly not something you see everyday. I went this past Friday night with my boyfriend to remember Our time there on our first date. We went in at about 11:30pm  and it wasn't very busy, lots of empty tables. We stopped at the counter where you are normally greeted and then seated, we even admired the desserts in the window and then decided that they don't have a hostess this late at night so we sat ourselves. We took a booth next to a few other seated tables so we were sure to get noticed. At first nobody stopped to greet us  which was fine because they had drinks or something for other tables and we also had to use the facilities so a slight delay was kind of necessary. 5 minutes turned into 10 minutes and then we started to get impatient. We have now been SEEN by everyone. All the servers have made glances out way and not one has said hello, or asked if we need help or a menu, or ANYTHING! I'm a hostess/server and I could never do that to someone. We're starting to think of leaving when there's a glimmer of hope on the horizon. A group came in and NOW a host comes up to the counter. He's getting them menus and while doing so he sees me, makes direct eye contact with me for a decent amount of time and I can tell he's thinking \\"I didn't seat you\\" and I thought he was thinking \\"maybe I should get you some menus while I seat them as well. Apparently that is not what he was thinking because he sat them down right next to us and said nothing to us. Just walked away. I was in shock. Then we gave them a common sense ultimatum, If a server goes to see them first we are leaving, but for some reason I still had hope, it was false hope. Less than a minute later a server that looked us over several times went right up to them to get their drink order. We were done, over done, like the burger's probably would have been. That's not fair, I like there burgers, or I would have if I was served one! We directly got up and left and on our way out, who else did we see but the host? He was in the corner booth sitting and glued to the screen of his laptop, giving less than half of a crap. So why should we? Clearly nobody wanted us there so we left.

I've tasted it and experienced it in many ways growing up in France and it's always been a huge part of my life. The food network is always on in my apartment and I spent quite a bit of time in the kitchen when I can. Hell, the only reason why I'm not in the culinary industry is because I'm allergic to seafood which would have limited me. But I digress. I've had many meals but the one I've had earlier this evening at Craigie on Main was one of the best.\\n\\nTheir menu is very modern and eclectic and we were lucky enough to get the ringside seats (there's only 4 of them available in the restaurant) because a previous reservation had cancelled rendering them free. Those very special seats are for a select and very lucky few and overlook the kitchen directly. You even get to interact with the chef a little bit. That alone made my night. \\n\\nThen came the amuse-bouche, which in my case was pork belly sliced very thin over fennel and mozzarella. It was very tasty and opened up my pallet nicely for what was a memorable meal.\\n\\nNot being able to eat seafood I settled for Potage of Sweet Butter and Sugar Corn which was absolutely exquisite. They replaced the seafood sausage pieces that come with it with fried squash flowers. A very interesting item that I had never tried. At that point I was very impressed and was looking forward to my entree. I saw that they offered bone marrow and it has to be my favorite dish ever, all time. It's literally what I want for my last meal and it's not found everywhere so I jumped on the occasion and thus ordered the hangar steak which comes with bone marrow, smoked beef tongue, shiitake mushrooms, Camargue red rice and huitlacoche jus. It was very intriguing yet very tasty. The bone marrow portion was HUGE which made my night as well. It was so, so good!\\n\\nThe wine paired it very well. Then we had a sour milk pannacotta. I had quite a bit of wine at that point and can't quite remember what it was exactly, but it was flavored with tea and had a very delicate, soothing texture. It was wonderful. My friend and I both ordered the same desert, which was the Market Fruits Crisp, a crumble which featured berries. It wasn't over sweet at all which was nice. They let the natural sugars in the berries express themselves.\\n\\nTo end the meal, we were given shots of a hibiscus froth.\\n\\nOverall it was a very intriguing, fun and wonderful experience going to Craigie on Main. The prices are high but you get what you pay for. Their menus change daily based on what's fresh and what looks good and the chef and staff are very attentive to the food they serve and the details making for an excellent experience. A dish never sat more than 10 seconds at the pass before being picked up by the runners.\\n\\nWhat I do recommend you do is try to get the ringside seats (or whatever it's are called) so that you can sit and get to peak at the kitchen. It's very entertaining and you'll learn quite a bit. The head chef is very friendly and for those feeling adventurous, you can order a half of a pigs head, roasted. They have a whole bunch of interesting items on their menus and my friend and I made a deal that we will be heading there every three months from now on to experience the menus as they change with the seasons.\\n\\nI love this place, it's a real gem!

The atmosphere is laid back and great for weeknight drinks and a good conversation with friends, brunch on a sunny Sunday afternoon, or people-watching on a summer night with the windows open and a great draft beer in hand. In the summer their rooftop is the best outdoor bar area in Cambridge, with views just above street level and a good breeze rolling in from the river, and and in the winter the red walls and dark wood are cozy without being stifling, while a kettle of hot cider fills the air with cinnamon, tempting you to order a glass with a healthy swag of rum. \\n\\nThere are certainly better restaurants in Cambridge if you're looking for fine dining but the food is great if you're just meeting up with friends, or want a solid meal without a solid check. The tomato bisque and buffalo chicken tenders (deep fried, not grilled) are long-standing favorites, and the steak or portabello salads are substantial entrees, though the seared scallops and stuffed pork medallions are also great. The daily specials menu features chefs-special risottos which have featured mushrooms, steak, or lobster but are all appropriately creamy and come in healthy proportions; special salads are also typically very good, and overall the menu offers a broad range of options (particularly compared with similar local venues like Redline or Grafton). Brunch is reasonably priced and offers a variety of great egg dishes (a classic benedict, well-balanced omelet or enormous breakfast burrito, among others), and often impossible to get a table given its popularity among locals (read: undergrads, MBAs and nearby recent grads such as myself). \\n\\nThe bar offers a great range of beers on tap (local favorites such as Sankaty Light or Smuttynose Old Brown Dog Ale as well as imports like O'Hara's Irish Stout or or Pilsner Urquell) and the experienced, knowledgeable bartenders make well-mixed, reasonably priced cocktails to suit any request. The staff is consistently friendly and attentive and you can always spot one of the owners here at night, shuttling between chatting with regulars at the bars upstairs or down, and checking into the kitchen to make sure everything is running smoothly. \\n\\nThis place is honestly one of the reasons I still haven't moved out of Cambridge since graduating 4 years ago."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"The very best barbecue experience in Austin.

As you can see, the menu also included the Treezy Cheezy sandwich, which had blue cheese, green onions and bacon in between grilled slices of Texas Toast. Since I ate the King Caesar at the truck and was full, I couldn't eat the grilled cheese there as well. I took it home with me and enjoyed it the next day, though I couldn't get it to heat properly and the cheese didn't melt like it probably did when it was made.

It was extremely delicious while were eating, but within half an hour of leaving the restaurant we both felt extremely nauseous.

Because my friend got similarly ill, I decided that they should be notified of a food illness concerning their product. \\n\\nThey did not call me back when I left a message telling them that what had happened. I have worked in food service for a long time and just wanted to notify them that this was occurring. I figured that they should be checking their stocks and all of their prepped foods and refrigerator temperatures. As far as I know this food may make other people sick because they are unaware and unwilling to admit to the fact that their miso made me ill.

We usually try to avoid return visits to places just so we can try all the eateries we can, but Flour is one of the best bakeries we've ever been to (if not the best). \\nThe first day we came for dinner and ordered the breakfast sandwich, curried tuna sandwich, Boston cream pie (when in Rome ...), and they gave us a complimentary chocolate chip cookie for the wait on our sandwiches. This was above and beyond because we had just finished our dessert and didn't feel as though we were waiting a particularly long time on the sandwiches. \\nEverything was incredibly fresh and delicious to the nth degree. The breakfast sandwich has literally the smoothest, creamiest egg you'll ever eat. The curried tuna is one I'm going to try and recreate at home - it had the perfect amount of natural sweetness (from apples, golden raisins, carrots, and tomato) to balance out the savoriness of the curry. It was grilled rather than toasted, giving it a better flavor and keeping the sandwich from tearing up the inside of my mouth. I mean, if I could eat this sandwich every day of my life, I would. \\nThe Boston cream pie was so light and fluffy and simultaneously rich. It didn't taste like refrigerator or seem stale (admit it, even the best bakeries can put out products like this sometimes). It was just so fresh and awesome, plus the size of one slice is really generous. The complimentary cookie we received was INSANE good. Everything about it was perfect. We also ordered sodas - one bottled, one housemade raspberry spritzer, both of which were great. \\nThis morning, we went for their famous sticky buns (we called ahead for 4 of them because we're crazy), and I also grabbed a fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Two sticky buns would have been fine - I finished mine and had maybe two bites of the next and my husband ate the remaining three. (This is why I married him.) I see why these are famous - they're so fluffy and the perfect amount of sweet without being cloying. There's an awesome amount of chopped pecans, too - they don't skimp here. \\nAnyhow, this is long and I'm getting emotional.

The vegetables seem half-way decent, but the meats are all cheap quality cuts.\\n\\nFor example, shrimp with black bean sauce.  Most places you would assume this means medium sized shrimp.  Here it means baby shrimp, none of which have been deveined.   \\n\\nOver two visits, I have now tried about eight dishes, and all were average at best.  The real test for chinese is how it holds up as leftovers, since leftover chinese food is one of the great snacks (when it is good, that is).   Unfortunately, last time we ordered here, with every dish less than half eaten, I preferred tossing it all in the garbage.  I couldn't endure even the thought of having to eat this food later.

The first time our pizzas weren't ready and after several stories of \\"just coming out now\\" and \\"just going in now,\\" I went in the store.  The manager acted like it was my fault and got upset that I refused to wait around for 15 minutes while new ones were made because the truth was they'd never made them originally and were afraid just to be honest and tell me that.  The second time I again had to wait, then they got the order wrong, then they tried to tell me I'd ordered it incorrectly online even though my correct order was on the receipt. The manager (same one, very young woman) again wouldn't accept any responsibility and just kept saying, \\"It's all good, man, it's all good...\\" after stealing the correct pizza from someone else's order and giving it to me.  To top it off, we got home and the crusts were so soggy and undercooked nobody would eat the pizzas.  I'm done.  If I eat Donatos again it will be from some other location.  I can't believe a company would let this person be their public face because it's clear she has no respect for customers and no control over the operation."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Live music and Irish dancers every night, I love it!  The food was great, too!  Unfortunately, it wasn't a perfect 5 star, as I expected it to be for Disney.  First off, the booth we were seated at was hard to get into, and I'm not a big person, so the heavier people in our group I'm sure struggled.  Also, my biggest complaint is that not every table can see the stage and performers.  As someone who adores everything Irish, I was extremely bummed to not be able to see the musicians or the dancers.  For a restaurant that advertises live music and dancers, the layout could have been done much better to give every guest that experience.  My other complaint was the appetizers- our table got the large sampler platter; however, for the price, there wasn't enough food to match the price.  Everything tasted good, yes, and I know it's Disney, but I still expected more food than what was on that platter- a big disappointment especially at the start of the meal!

Unremarkable waitstaff and an ungenerous kitchen.\\n\\nMy Girlfriend and I decided to celebrate a year and a half together with a dinner at Craigie on Main.  We had the 10 course tasting menu.  I don't usually do this, but I want to throw in the disclaimer that I am comparing this experience to Eleven Madison Park, which may just be unfair.\\n\\nI will not go into the individual dishes, both because that would be extremely long and the dishes are constantly rotating, so there is no guarantee you would ever get any of them again.\\n\\nThe first thing that I noticed is that there was a MASSIVE variety in the sizes of the plates.  The first three were absolutely tiny (think about 4sq\\")  and I found myself gorging on bread so that I wouldn't have to try and find late-night food in Somerville.  Then came dish four which was the cheek of some massive fish (were talking a meal of meat on its own).  By the end I was so full that I found myself merely tasting the dish because I simply couldn't eat anymore.\\n\\nThe dishes themselves were obviously made from very high quality ingredients.  That seems to be this place's shtick.  The scallop sashimi was divine and had a hint of the vinigeriness of ceviche.  Yet none of them transcendent the sum of its parts to create a greater whole.  The fish cheek was overpowered by a chili-oil sauce.  The first course, a collection of three amuse bouche each was a bit interesting, but they didn't play off of each other in a way that would explain why they were served as a single dish. \\n\\nThe wait staff was casual, but not unpleasantly so.  I, however, am used to giving my tastes at the beginning of a chef's tasting menu and I am used to having the kitchen at least consider them.  For example, I love lamb and all lamb related products, and when I told my waitress this, her face read \\"So?  Then you should have ordered lamb.\\"  Now maybe that is more of an issue of restaurant policy than my waitress and maybe I am being unfair.  I also told her I loved bone marrow.  However, rather than having bone marrow as a course, it was brought out as  $20 10th  course (wedged between 6 and 7) and was served so late in the night that I had trouble really appreciating the texture and flavor because of how full I had become.  \\n\\nA quick note on the deserts.  One was simply a slice of the a la carte cake and the other was a thimbleful of hot chocolate.  Neither was great and both were frankly disappointing.\\n\\nNow maybe this seems harsh, but I think that if you are going to offer a $115 10 course chef's tasting menu, there better be some good thought going into it and you better come out of it feeling like a king.  It didn't and I didn't."},{"name":"Yasu","address":"1366 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"My first Korean BBQ!\\n\\nWhat a beautiful way to eat with a group.

I think heavy dusting of spices on the chips are free. \\n\\nM2: This margarita was Tequila heavy, but I didn't mind. We both ordered an assortment of tacos; Chicken, beef, chorizo and pork.

Inside, the interior provided a cool escape that put my fears to rest. After grazing on snacks and sweets all day, Pio Pio provided food actively reflecting the culture-rich landscape of Orlando. Our server was attentive to the -nth degree, by topping up our almost-full glasses to the brim; an act that did not go unnoticed for us dehydrated individuals.\\n\\nAppetizers: Fried and Guajira Calamari\\nMain Entrees: Quarter Rotisserie Chicken (me), Pork Chops (dad), Grilled Skirt Steak with Onions (bro 1), Grilled Skirt Steak with Onions and Red Peppers (mum), Breaded Steak (bro 2).\\n\\nInternally, I was thrilled that we ordered the Guajira Calamari. There's a song titled Guajira, so I have a positive association built-in and seeing this menu item made anticipate trying this dish even more. The Guajira Calamari is boiled in a marinated tomato-based sauce. My brothers, avoiders of the boiled calamari variety, actually enjoyed this dish. It was shocking. As for the fried calamari, similar to the guajira, was oh-so tender. It had the right amount of breading that did not compete with the calamari.\\n\\nThe menu features different portion sizes of their rotisserie chicken: quarter, half, and whole. \\"Rotisserie chicken? Underwhelming much?\\" you wonder. Visually, the plating is sub-par mediocre. Don't let that drive you away. Taste it. The rotisserie chicken is the cr√®me de la cr√®me. If the wall of rotating chickens does not convince you otherwise, hopefully I can. I am always cautious about chicken served bone-in. Will I have a hard time eating it? Will my hands have to get dirty? Will it be worth it? Lay down your worries, for those worries are unwarranted. To melt is an understatement. The chicken dissolves into a richness I have never encountered. All you need your fork to gently pull away the meat from the bones and savor the tenderness. Effortless. I did not think I could be satisfied with a mere rotisserie chicken. The rice is not of the typical variety. It's fluffy with a subtle and earthy aroma. The plantains, dipped in anyone of the sauces served, are a wonderful counterbalance of textures. \\n\\nAs for the other dishes, my family members were satisfied, however, perhaps not quite blown away as I was. All around approval for the appetizers, rice, and beans with a mixed basket on their main entree items. \\n\\nThe owner and chefs of Pio Pio have a taste for sauces and flavor combinations I simply want more of."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Favorite casual italian in all of Boston!\\n\\nI've been to both locations and I think the North End location beats the South End not only because of the general atmosphere but when I eat there I can tell in my soul that the cooks and the waiter truly cares about what I am about to eat. \\n\\nOf course part of the entire experience is to wait in the long line and look longingly at the people inside. Once my dining partner and I sat down and started to strategically decide what dishes we would order I noticed a group of about 5 people being served the seafood pasta for 2. Immediately one of the girls took out her camera and started to take pictures of the beautiful dish and the waiter snatched her camera away and yelled in a good natured way \\"food is for eating! not taking pictures!\\" the entire restaurant (all 15 tables) laughed and that is when I knew I was going to have a fantastic meal. \\n\\n- calamari appetizer: it was so good that we regretted not ordering the large\\n- seafood pasta with a combination of the giacomo sauce and their spicier sauce (as recommended from the \\"food is for eating! man\\" : as soon as it was set down in front of me the man asked me \\"do you want cheese?\\" and before I could answer him he quickly said \\"yes, you need cheese.

The first hint that things were not going to live up to expectations was the fact that out of the 15 beers on tap a third or more were kicked.  The bread brought to the table was stale and the pork belly gnocchi was uninspired.  The gnocchi was overcooked, the sauce relied heavily on butter and had no complexity, and the pork belly was non-existent.  We also got a meat and cheese plate that was decent.  The oven roasted pork shoulder was done well but the cheese looked like it had sat out for a while as the cheese was sweating oil.  The salty pig pizza was extremely good, it had a few different pork cuts and had a mustard base which was cool.  One problem with the pizza was that I always eat my crust and here I did not want to, they should probably consider brushing the crust with oil.  We finished if off with the grilled short rib which was overcooked and had a terrible flavor combination.  The short rib was slathered with a sauce that resembled simple syrup and the grits were undercooked and so were the carrots on the side.  Thankfully the waiter did comp this item after he noticed we barely touched it.  To top of the tremendously disappointing experience the waiter dropped off our check and then disappeared for nearly twenty minutes before coming back to run the card.

They were flexible and professional enough to accommodate almost every detail -- dietary restrictions, serving presentation, day-of logistics, and the list goes on. \\n\\nWith a long engagement, it was almost a year between our first contact with them and the actual wedding. During that time, we dealt with three different coordinators (due to new hiring and employee vacations) and while that could have been a total nightmare, they managed the hand-off of our event with grace and without anything falling through the cracks. Our final event coordinator Callie Hill was definitely the most wonderful to work with. Before putting in the final order, we went to their Driftwood location for a tasting and lunch.The catering and restaurant staff treated us and our parents amazingly well, brought us extra goodies, and answered all the questions we had. It really felt like red carpet treatment months before we event had our wedding. \\n\\nAs for the food: if you've eaten Salt Lick before, you know how truly amazing their BBQ is. And we're happy to report that their catered fare is not lacking one iota in quality! The catering team arrived with their grill/smoker in tow and the BBQ that they put out on the buffet line was as good as any I believe I've ever had.

Aside from the amazing food, they were in and out so smoothly and neatly that I was astonished. They arrived early and set up in a flash, cleaned up quickly and thoroughly, and even gave us some leftovers which we and our friends devoured after a few drinks at the after-party :) \\n\\nIn conclusion: incredible, professional admin and catering staff who are willing to accommodate almost any request; and of course WORLD CLASS BBQ.

I also opted to have bacon on mine.  It was surprisingly filling and I could have eaten another one because of how good it was but after I ate that and had some fries I was actually full.  The fries are only $2.75 so I was expecting to have just a small serving but it's really big for the price you pay.  My husband and I were able to share one and boy oh boy are they tasty.

Now, I understand going into the North End on a Saturday night is risky business and you're going to wait no matter where you go. But, I've worked in the industry as a bartender, wait staff and hostess and I know that giving wait times is not a complicated matter, especially when you have a computer system in front of your face with your nightly report on it. Waiting a little extra is understandable, but, a 2 hour wait when you told us 30-40 minutes is not. Alas, this we were all willing to get over. However, when we sat down it was literally one thing after another! First we were greeted with used silverware...not dirty like, some spots on it. Dirty like, I just cut into my meatball marinara and set the knife back on the table. No biggie, we asked the busser to replace it and he went to take it away (not replacing the napkin it was on) and instead of setting it to the edge of the table he put it on the seat where one of my friends was about to sit...gross. We again shrugged this off, determined to have a good night, because I knew the food was great at this place (especially those rice balls, yum). After our very testy waitress gave us about 30 seconds for 6 people to look at one drink list we ordered our beer and wine and waited. We were happy for the bread and the drinks and needed to relax. It was at this time that three things happened one after another, My friend realized his beer glass had a giant crack in the side (like down half the glass), I pulled a giant piece of hair out of the bread that was in my mouth and my boyfriend found a huge piece of plastic in his draft beer. \\n    Now, we had been very patient up to this point, but, being an industry person I felt it important to notify someone of all that had gone wrong. I made my way to the hostess and very politely let her know our situation, explaining we were trying to be very patient but really felt whoever was in charge needed to know. She was very nice and said she would send the owner over. When the owner came over she said (and I quote) \\"What's the problem\\" I explained to her that we felt she needed to know all of these things that had just happened and we had only been seated for about 12 minutes. Instead of apologizing about the situation she rolled her eyes at me and said \\"So, What do you want a free meal? Is that what your after?\\" I said, \\"No, Absolutely not, but, as someone who works in the restaurant business and thinks things should be communicated with the manager I certainly wasn't looking for you to be rude to me.\\" She again rolled her eyes and said \\"well, the list was getting pretty long\\" and I said \\"You're absolutely right, that is A LOT of things to go wrong with one table, I would hope you'd be concerned, not angry at us. Can my friend at least have a new beer glass and can we get some new bread\\"\\n   The waitress continued to be impatient with us and brought us the wrong number of Arancini (we wanted one for each person and she brought 4 for 6 people). When she took our drink orders I tried to be polite and say hey I'm not quite ready Ill order when you come back, and she just said no, you can't do that. Really...REALLY because I'm pretty sure you CAN???\\n\\nWe received 10% off our meals (which were not the best I've had there) but NEVER got an apology from the owner. As an owner or manager of an establishment you should ALWAYS greet a complaint with a smile and an apology if something (or several things) have gone wrong.

It's really good pizza.  The San Gennaro is the best pizza I've ever had.  Too bad it's so fucking hard to enjoy it on premises due to the sheer volume of people riding the hype.

Every time I go to Disney I usually end up stopping by a quick service because I'm usually really hungry and being in Florida, it's always hot. Plus, the fancier sit in restaurants recommend making reservations otherwise, you'll be waiting to be seated for forever. There's nothing really special about this restaurant. It's crowded and pretty chaotic throughout the day since it's literally right next to the small world ride. That's a clever sales tactic by the way because people are lured in by the smell of food after a boat ride. Anyway, we sat at a table that was next to a window which overlooked the small world ride and we could wave at the people getting on the boat, so I thought that was nice. The food was pretty tasty but nothing spectacular. It wasn't horrible but you don't get that much for your money. Just a square flatbread pizza, fries, and a drink which comes to about $13, give or take a few dollars, if I remember correctly. I could probably get a large pizza from a chain restaurant like domino's or something for less than or around that price. It's just ridiculous, because you end up paying a five star price for a two star meal. And I don't think there's an option to buy a combo meal. Everything is priced separately I think but even if there are combo meal options on the menu, it's Disney so expect to fork out a fortune just for one meal.

Especially when you compare to it NYC, they give more BUT it doesn't taste as good as some of the NYC restaurants for similar or equal pricing, hence the 4 stars and only recommending to come here once and not again.  This restaurant might be the most sophisticated food in town, then I understand why a lot of people gave this place 5 stars.  If it were to stand up against restaurants in NYC, I think it would be around 3.75 rating.\\n\\nIn any case, onto the food.  \\n1st course, we ordered: Crispy Fried Pig's Tails, Grilled Spanish Octopus, and Lamb shank pasta\\nThe pig tails was delicious but overly salty for my taste, my companions thought the salt content was just right.  The flavor profile is more asian/thai mix.  The meat was tender but there are some small bones.  The waitress recommended using my hands to eat it, but a fork was just fine and much more civilized.  I would recommend this dish.\\nThe spanish octopus in my opinion lacked seasoning.  You got the full tenticles.  Because it was the entire length with varying thickness, the ends of the tenticles were burnt and that ruined my taste buds.  I would recommend preparing the tenticles differently so everything is evenly cooked.  The thicker portions of the tenticles were tender though.  They didn't make it rubbery or chewy, I'll give them that much.\\nThe lamb shank pasta was flavorful.  I wish they gave more of the sauce/broth.  The sauce/broth had deep lamb flavors to it.  Absolutely lovely.  Reminded me of a bolognese sauce.  I would recommend this dish.  Earthy flavors to the dish.\\n\\n2nd course we ordered:\\nTor Tor fish? of the day (don't remember what it's called, ugly fish head which is dis proportioned to the rest of the body), Venison, and beef brisket (forgot the full description).\\nThe fish did not complement the red beets at all.  Didn't go well together and didn't taste good.  My assumption is that they tried to use the beets to cover up some of the fish taste.  It didn't work.  I think the fish would have worked with just seasoning and pan frying it.  Then combine it with a liquid sauce, maybe an earthy type of sauce.\\nThe venison was cooked to perfection.  Loved the marble meat.  Definitely enough pieces on the dish if you want to share.  Flavors went well together, quite a heavy dish.  \\nThe beef brisket was decent.  Lots of sauces and it was basically a well season brisket, nothing spectacular.  But I preferred the venison much more.  \\n\\n3rd course we ordered:\\nBanana Millefeuille, Apricot tort, and Cajet Creme Caramel.\\nLoved the millefeuille, lots of banana flavor and the glazed sugar over the banana on top really added to the dish.  \\nThe apricot dish was presented beautifully but it's on the tarty side.  I think if you just ate the apricot with the ice cream and pistachio without that yellow gel on the dish, it would taste a lot better.\\nThe cajet creme caramel was decent as well, but it was my least favorite out of the 3.  If you don't like kumquat, then you won't like the dish.  The kumquat just didn't complement the other components, the flavors from the kumquat was just too strong.  I think they should have just made it a powerful dessert dish.  \\n\\nOverall, decent meal but I would only go once."},{"name":"Subway","address":"Seafair Shopping Center, 8671 No 1 Road, Unit 6","city":"Richmond","stars":"2","text":"After"},{"name":"Acitron Cocina Mexicana","address":"473 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"4","text":"Authentic feel.

That's not the case at Reuben's. You really do get your 1/4 lb of meat (if not more). More often than not I can't even finish my sandwich. \\n\\nIn addition to being super speedy and delicious, everyone who works there is really nice. In a rush and want to get in and out? Call ahead - they'll take your order and have it ready for you when you arrive (my new favorite trick that I just learned today). Can't get out of the office? Don't worry they deliver (and are honest about the time they'll actually get there). So if you work / live / dine anywhere around Broad Street you MUST check out Reuben's tomorrow. It's a lunch time fave. Oh and one of my coworkers said their breakfasts are amazing as well. So let me know if you try that."},{"name":"Chinese Sauerkraut Fish","address":"4940 Number 3 Road, Suite 101","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"We ordered the fish for 3-4 people size, decent portion and delicious food.

Since we had a group of us there, we thought it best to do a pre-selected order of food. The selection they brought out to us was pretty good, and the food was filling. There were a few entrees that I wasn't a fan of, and the clams I remember being too salty. Overall, the meal was decent.\\n\\nHowever, the reason for the 2 stars is that a few days after my visit, upon checking my cc statement, I realized that the restaurant overcharged me by $24.95. I always keep my receipts and check my statements for this very reason. I'm not happy about this overcharge, and I'm currently disputing this charge with my cc company and hope to get it resolved soon.

MMMMM I've had Frog Legs in France before and these ones at Chambar were just as delicious!\\n\\nFor our main, I ordered the Fletan au Tamarin (Haida Gwaii halibut, sea asparagus, sweet peas, mustard greens, spicy tapioca, jalape√±o pistou, tomato tamarind broth), it was pretty delicious. Interesting concept with the broth poured over the meal, it wasn't too dry or too soupy. Who ever thou tapioca in a savoury meal?! Well it works, everything about it was perfect!\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the La Pi√©ce de Boeuf (Char grilled 9oz Manhattan steak, cauliflower pur√©e, broccolini, heirloom tomatoes, chimichurri, horseradish & shallot marmalade.) The steak was pretty delicious with the peppercorn which really brought out the flavour of the meat.  Pretty sure if we had to take a wild guess, we would of thought it was regular mash potatoes, but nope - I give the cauliflower healthy option a 2 thumbs up! \\n\\nThe show stopper was the dessert, Terre Rocheuse de Chocolat (Belgian chocolate mousse, almond chocolate streusel, crisp chocolate caramel, raspberry buttermilk sherbet), if you love CHOCOLATE as much as much as we do this will steal your heart and make you wanting more! It was dark in the restaurant and at first I thought the raspberry buttermilk sherbet was some exotic fruit, I was surprised but then we devoured into it without any hesitation!\\n\\nMy boyfriend had Belgium beer and I had a lemony cocktail, both were very tasty! \\n\\nThe portion sizes were very good for a high end restaurant. Just the perfect amount because the last thing we want to do is leave feeling hangry!

The only thing was we had multiple servers which was okay and we had to flag them down towards the end because we were a bit tired.\\n\\nChambar truly lived up to it's high review and expectation, I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a fine dining experience and if you have never tried French food, this would be the perfect place to go.

Always thought it was a quick service place for some reason. You can order food to-go. But they also have table service. We chose to sit down and eat. I loved the menu. So many things I wasn't sure what to choose. Ended up getting the brisket dip sandwich which was quite good. Waitress was great. Only major complaint was that the food took forever at 2 in the afternoon. Waitress did say she was having a manager check on the food to see what was up. About 15 minutes later our food finally showed up. Kind of shocked no manager bothered to stop by and apologize or anything. Typically if that happens the manager will either bring the food out personally or stop by shortly after its delivered to check in and apologize for waiting an hour for 2 sandwiches. Never happened. It was all up to the waitress herself to get the food out to us. Also the fries were pretty crummy. Very brown and tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours and not tasty at all. Had to cover mine in salt, pepper, and ketchup just to make them appetizing. This place could have had more stars but lack of good management and crummy sides haulted that.

Luckily enough a good friend of mine was having big birthday bash there so it gave me the perfect excuse to drop everything and head on over. This was no ordinary group either. We occupied a good portion of the main dining area with 3 communal tables. I think there was about 27 or so people in total. This usually spells nightmares for waitstaff and the kitchen, but they handled it beautifully. Drinks were refilled, orders were taken in a timely matter, and they were genuinely happy to have us there. With so many diners at once Nakato offered a special tasting menu to guests who had agreed to it prior to the night of. I covertly sat next to a couple of people who ordered the tasting menu and I ordered a la carte myself. (sneaky, I know...but a boy's gotta eat) \\n\\nI'm usually pretty good about including details of the various dishes on my reviews, but since it was a birthday celebration I had quite a bit to drink. The sake and beer were flowing pretty generously. Not very good for my short term memory. The highlight of my meal was the hamachi kama though. It's probably the best one in Atlanta. A lot of times i find that hamachi kama is overcooked or has an overly fishy aroma. \\n\\nI cannot overstate how wonderful their service was though. Especially with a group as large as ours I felt as if it were an intimate dinner. I never felt neglected once during the entire meal. Paying for the check was pretty painless as well. I thought it was gonna be a mess, but it was simple and organized. Nothing ruins a perfect meal more than a painful payment process. \\n\\nWe had a blast that night and I know we'll be back in the future.

People stand and eat their pizza atop boxes of San Marzano tomatoes when all the tables are full (trust me, they will be).

We were seated quickly and charmed by a waiter with a fun personality, who took our order and brought our coffees.  \\nAnd then it all went wrong.\\n\\nThe place started to get quite busy and it turns out there was just this one waiter (who had only been there 2 weeks) and a very unhappy looking hostess to take care of the whole restaurant.  I am assuming they were not doing the cooking as well, but with as slow as muddled as everything became, I would not be surprised.\\n\\nMy sister ordered the kielbasa and sausage with scrambled eggs and an english muffin, I ordered a breakfast burrito and my companion ordered biscuits and gravy. In the course of waiting for our food - which was a somewhat long and hungry wait - I saw at least two patrons send things back to the kitchen.  \\n\\nRight before our food came out, the hostess stopped by the table to tell my sister that they'd run out of kielbasa and they'd already subbed in sausage, and was that ok?  My sister, whose stomach was probably eating itself at that point, just said, sure whatever, just bring it out.\\n\\nI am here to tell you these were the saddest, most anemic looking sausages I have ever seen.  After tasting them, we all decided that not only did they look like albino cat turds, they tasted pretty awful as well, with the consistency of packing sponge.  The \\"scrambled\\" eggs were an offense I have seen committed by many dining establishment.  It's almost like they pour the eggs in the pan, push it around half- heartedly and call it done when they're assumed to be cooked through.  You need to sort of whip them or whisk them about first, and then do whatever it is you have to do in the pan to make them look \\"scrambled\\".  Not like a block of egg product, the kind you get in prisons and IKEA.  You know what I mean, right?  Scrambled?  Scrambled.\\n\\nAlso, they forgot her english muffin.\\n\\nThe breakfast burrito was serviceable, although I don't think there were any olives in it, as the menu mentioned.  Don't you hate that?  When the menu gives a lengthy description of dish with all kinds of tasty components but then the finished product is missing most of the stuff that made it sound so amazing?  My companions biscuits and gravy were, as he stated, \\"ok\\".  \\n\\nMaybe it was an off morning.  They did seem really, really short-staffed.

While Surin is light and airy with white paper on tables, Harry & Sons is dark wood colored, and slight grungy.\\n\\nThe sushi lunch specials are surprisingly good and a great value at $10-12 ...choice of 4 combos where you get 2 large rolls.  You can go with the option of rolls with tempura fried shrimp or other things, or more simple/traditional ones  I tried- the rainbow roll and spicy tuna roll, or a tiger roll and eel roll.  The fish is fresh, and portions are large.  I also love the Thai lunch specials that are also served at Surin that are under $10- the chicken noodle bowl, the Chicken Massaman, or the Thai noodle (also known in other restaurants as pad Thai).

I don't remember the drink order taking too long to make its way over to us, but the food took a good minute to arrive.

Based on the fact she told us, \\"Be careful, hot plates,\\" this was a strong possibility.  I had eggs, Soysage, a biscuit and the cheese grits.  I think eggs should be one of the easiest things to get right on a menu, but these did not make a splash.  The cheese grits had a really bland taste as well.  I can't them credit for the cold Soysage since that is prepackaged.  The wheat biscuit was the only thing that I thought was tasty.  My friend had the pancakes which I nibbled on as well, but they were also bland.  He ended up leaving his turkey bacon and part of his eggs behind because he wasn't impressed.\\n\\nOur server eventually made her way back with our check after a while.

After hearing rave reviews about Ruth's Chris from my parents, I decided it was time to take the plunge and try this place out.\\n\\nA couple of years ago for a one year anniversary, I scheduled a reservation for dinner at Ruth's Chris. When I made the reservation they wanted to know all the details about the evening. When I explained to them it wasn't a marriage anniversary and it was just a relationship anniversary, they said it didn't matter and that an anniversary was an anniversary. I didn't know what that meant exactly, but I went with it.\\n\\nWe arrived at Ruth's Chris and were immediately treated like royalty. Everyone was calling me Miss, and even the manager of this particular establishment came around to see how dinner was treating us. I was too preoccupied to answer, seeing as how I was stuffing food in my mouth every time I came up for air.\\n\\nMy steak was delicious. There was a lot of seasoning on it that I could have done without (I like it plain, what can I say?), but it was seriously the easiest steak to cut. I felt like I could practically cut it with just my fork, and that's a big deal with steak. And then once it was in my mouth, it nearly melted. It was the smoothest steak I've ever had.\\n\\nAnd I don't even know what to say about the potatoes. I LOVE potatoes, and I'm a huge critic when it comes to good mashed potatoes, and Ruth's Chris did not disappoint. I was very impressed and even when I was full I forced myself to finish the potatoes because they were that good. \\n\\nThen after our dishes were cleared, our waiter came by with a slice of chocolate cake and a candle and he said, \\"Happy anniversary. Dessert on the house.\\" It was very sweet of them to do that, and the cake was amazing.\\n\\nI enjoy Ruth's Chris. It's definitely pricey, but it's certainly worth it.

I don't want to call myself a pizza    connoisseur but I kind of am. I've had pizza from some of the best the US has to offer, including pizzeria bianco in Phoenix Az. Antico is better than any of them.  The pizza from Antico is perfect. The crust is slightly blistered and has a nice char, but not too much so it becomes overpowering and tastes burned like some I've had. The creamy mozzarella melts in your mouth and  the slightly garlicy sauce creates just the right balance-perfect amount and not overly sauced. You can't go \\nwrong with any pizza you choose. The first times I went there I kept it \\nbasic with the Margherita because I usually like to keep it nice and \\nsimple. On subsequent visits I decided to branch out a bit and was not dissappointed- ok maybe 1 time. The pomodorini was ok-the vesuvio tomatoes should have been halved because they overpowered the pizza. The San Gennaro and Lasagna are pure heaven. The small sweet red peppers were incredible-don't normally like peppers on ny pizza but these are so sweet the taste blew me away. I live caramelized onions only made a great pizza better. The ricotta and meatball combo on the lasagna one was equally fabulous and it still had the same great margherita base with the creamy mozzarella and sauce. I know Antico has gotten great reviews and all are well deserved. I'm so fortunate to be so close to the best pizza in the world!!

My only warning is that if you prefer your meat more rare, it can be a little harder to find something that is more on the pink side.\\n\\n  As for the other buffet items, the salad items are always nice and crisp and the rice and beans very tasty.

Most of the male staff have beards and mustaches, most of the female staff are sexy with great style.  They've got the hipster atmosphere here down.\\n\\nI give 5 stars to the drink menu - TONS of beers on draft and in bottles. The prices are pretty steep but the selection is great, plus you will also receive the proper glass for the type of beer that you order. I got the Second Self Red Ale and it was $5 for an 8oz pour - my only gripe is that the drink was served to me with about 2oz of head on it each time (I had two).  Pls, spoon off the head and pour my drink until the glass is full of drinkable beer, not foam.\\n\\nThe food menu is about 4 stars, which is why the overall rating is 4 stars.  I think the menu is at times a hipster mess and maybe they need to ask some old heads in the restaurant business a thing or two about making a creative menu without being silly.  We went for brunch and had an appetizer of the fried pickles and pimento cheese.  The pickles are sweet, the menu doesn't clarify that at all.  The dish is great though and the homemade pimento cheese was FANTASTIC.  You get a very large portion which can easily be shared, plus the cheese and pickles go great together, along with the tiny bit of celery greens that are used as garnish.  Great dish!\\n\\nMy partner had the brunch special, which was a Korean rice bowl with pork, greens, pickled everything, and two sunny side up eggs on top.  It tasted fantastic and was a very generous portion.  \\n\\nI ordered the shrimp and grits which was, honestly, a hipster mess and just some sad food.  The grits tasted great and were the star of the dish.  The shrimp looked boiled.  Very pale, soft, and smooth, plus the plate smelled very \\"shrimpy\\" when it was placed in front of me, which was a turn off.  The dish also had some sauteed porcini mushrooms which didn't taste very good with the shrimp - they had a very strong mushroom flavor and seemed out of place whenever I'd eat one.  My tips on the shrimp and grits is to put some damn hair on this damn dish's chest.  Sear the shrimp in garlic, onions, and tomatoes - anything, just give them some FLAVOR, color, and some crispness. Add some sausage to the grits and don't make it so soupy, and make a hipster gravy to top it all with.  The way this dish is served - so white and pale pink, it just looked and smelled like something you'd punish a bad kid with.\\n\\nAnd please - stop serving those expensive ass beers with so much head.

I noticed they have a nice thing where you go get a set of cured meats, some cheese and a salad as a meal but I wanted to try the Salty Pig Pizza. Well, service was good, and it was unique but probably they need a disclaimer that it is more of an oval flatbread in that there is no tomato sauce, instead they have whole grain mustard in a thin layer, and then some delicious salty pig, and then arugula on top. First, not all that crazy about mustard, or a lot of it and I have this aversion to greens on what I thought was a pizza...my fault, and I realized it is kind of cool and cultural but didn't hit my cool spot.

With so many Thai places to choose from in the area, I would expect this place (or any place for that matter) to try to distinguish itself a bit. Hasn't happened yet.  Some co-workers of mine go with the Yellow Curry and the Panang Curry, both of which seem to offer at least more flavor and substance. Stay away from the Garlic and Pepper dish on their entree menu.

It was not.\\n\\nIt was not the worst pizza we've had in Boston area, but only because that dubious honor belongs to Charlie's Pizza & Cafe in Brighton. Well, that's neither here nor there. We started not liking the pizza; that grew into outright revulsion by the time we each reached slice #4, which went maddeningly uneaten. It was just too disgusting. It was both burned (perhaps from sitting in that damnable oven for an extra half hour) and soggy. This combination of factors is a curious one, but rest assured it is far from pleasant. The color of the cheese was also a mysterious dark orange. We're not talking the pepperoni-tinged mozzarella orange that fans of cheap eats pizza are familiar with. We're talking the whole pie looking like the pepperoni just flat-out bled out on it, or was used as a communal tampon for a few weeks prior to consumption.\\n\\nIn short, our experience tonight has pushed us firmly into the Presto's camp, where pies are cheap and decent while the service is professional."},{"name":"Alborz Persian Cuisine","address":"3300 W Anderson Ln, Ste 300","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"4 stars just for the intoxicatingly amazing smell of warm spices when you walk in the door!\\n\\nAlso 4 stars for food.

They are also a green restaurant, with the vast majority of their dinnerware being compostable--veyr admirable. They don't have traditional wine glasses, which I also love; our server, Bernard, told us it's because they don't want to be one of 'those' wine bars with the 'pinkies up' approach to wine. Love it! \\n\\nWe sampled several of their tapas, and with a gift certificate from 365 Things to Do in Austin, TX, we were also treated to an wine flight with 4 of their organic wines: a chardonnay, a sauv blanc, a cab sauv and what Bernard described as a 'kick ass' chianti. All were great. The baked brie, sauteed calamari, spinach and artichoke dip and escargot were all delicious. We also ordered a bit of the chili spice-rubbed pork with extra-buttery grits and garlic aeoli potato wedges, which were great.

Shower in the bathroom had excellent water pressure, only drawback was the sink had a small leak, but it was workable.\\n\\nRoom Service: We had comp AM bev service due to the aeformentioned Select Guest membership. We also had breakfast on our first morning, which wasnt too shabby and was delivered to our bed by an amazing member of staff who was both polite and cheerful!(I would be for 14 bucks/plate LOL) My only drawback was due to bev services on sunday morning of our stay, as our water for tea was barely lukewarm and not even notified of its delivery.

The valet team simply had no clue where many people's keys were because they did not have the keys assigned to the proper valet tickets.

D√©cor was cool but some of the booths are uncomfortable and some of the seats already need to be replaced.\\n\\nFirst off, this company/restaurant needs to figure out what it wants to be.  When you order at the counter up front, they have a tip jar located next to the cash register.  I don't understand what this is for?  Taking my money??  Not once did any employee stop by our table to ask if everything tasted good, if we needed anything, or if we needed a drink refill.  My gf and I went up to the main counter a total of 3 times to get our own refills.  The first refill session the employees had their backs to the counter and I stood there for a little while hoping someone would see me.  Eventually a girl who was on the phone snapped her fingers at another employee and he finally took care of me.  They couldn't care less about the customer's experience!  Where is the manager?  Who is the manager?  In addition, each time we received a refill our drink cups were COVERED IN SODA which I had to wipe off before carrying them back to our table!  Why don't you wipe that shi* off???  \\n\\nIn addition we noticed at least 3 times there were no customers ordering anything, yet the employees were standing around doing nothing.  I counted a total of 8 employees hanging out behind the main counter, yet nobody could come to our table for a refill? We got our own refills, we had to ask for the salt shaker, we even cleaned our own table. Again you have a tip jar for WHAT?  \\n\\nAnother odd detail is they bring out each food item as it comes up from the kitchen, instead of waiting for all items to be ready and bringing them out to the table together.  \\n\\n  Now time for the food.  I'm going to list the food items with a short description to make it easy:\\n\\n1.  Fries ordered with no seasoning - some of the best fries ever!  The fries are the highlight of the meal.  Ask for them \\"extra crispy\\" and you can't go wrong.\\n\\n2.  Chicken taco - tastes good but the cheese wasn't melted.  If you go to the store and buy any flour tortillas, throw some pre cooked chicken pcs, and some shredded cheese... same thing.  No presentation, nothing special.  WEAK SAUCE!\\n\\n3.  Zucchini Fries - complete let down!  SOGGY AS COULD BE!  No flavor.  They were completely undercooked and I only ate a few because they were disgusting!  Either the cooks don't know what their doing, don't care, or quality control is non existent.  One of the three.\\n\\n4.  Caesar side salad - WORLDS smallest SIDE SALAD!  $3 for a salad in a very small cup!  Unreal!  Complete rip off!  McDonalds has a better quality $.99 side salad that is 2 x bigger than this pathetic overpriced side item.\\n\\n5.  Kahuna Burger - burger was ok.  Bun was really good.  5 out of 10.  Just average overall.\\n\\n6.  Cheesy beans and rice are a hit!  Give them a try, you can't go wrong.  Magic in a cup!  Oddly enough the same cup you get a side salad in!\\n\\n7.  Diet Cokes are extra good here!  Crunchy ice is awesome!\\n\\n  This restaurant should ditch the tip jar and put drink stations out where the customers can help themselves.  Larger side salads are a must!  Bring the food out together.  Put salt shakers, ketchup, and mustard out too.  Learn how to cook the zucchini fries.  If you're going to serve people, then do serve people.  Don't make people come get their refills on top of handing customers soda covered cups and expect a tip!

I devoured the $4.95 small and was still hungry. The medium size ($5.95) was adequate, but there are other options nearby that are cheaper and more plentiful.

In my previous review, I'd mentioned that Kika is owned by the same owners as Dali and Tapeo, but that is not the case.) Kika's menu is similar to that of other tapas restaurants in the area, which can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your perspective. I was happy to see some tried-and-true favorites on the menu (the pork loin in bleu cheese, the sauteed artichoke).\\n\\nWe ordered 6 dishes, a couple of which disappointed. The chorizo was tasty enough, but just kind of there (no adornment). I think we were spoiled after a couple of dishes that had wonderful sauces for sopping up with bread, like the aforementioned pork and the lamb meatballs in a truffle cream sauce. The sizzling shrimp and garlic reminded me of something I could easily make at home. But nothing was bad per se - we still cleaned our plates.\\n\\nWe sat outside as it was an unseasonably warm night, so I can't speak to the noise level inside or the decor, which (as others have noted) is a bit \\"busy.\\" We lingered for a bit and didn't feel rushed in any way by our pleasant waitress. In addition to the usual wine and sangria, they also had a good cocktail selection, and I highly recommend La Tormenta Negra, sort of similar to a Dark n' Stormy.\\n\\nThe one caveat I have is, either take public transportation or figure out what you're going to do with your car! The parking situation in Kendall Square sucks. Kika does not have a lot and there is no on-street parking in front of the restaurant. I wrote a review on the parking garage nearby (Standard Parking) which is fine if you are out of there before 9:30."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"This place is off the hook.\\n\\nAmazing, crisply prepared cocktails at the bar.

(Lunch portion of the above, beer, and standard tip was $20.)"},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"This place is the BEST. A little of a drive from the good ole ATX but totally worth it! I had the Thurman plate and it had ribs, brisket, and sausage. Brisket was my fav, I opted for the fatty vs lean."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"We dined at the bar and, to be fair, we only ordered wine and a side. Both were not to our taste. We ordered 3 different glasses of wine and only one was any good. The others were weak and vinegar-y in our opinion. We ordered a side of the bone marrow, which comes with bread. The bone marrow side was probably one of the worst bone marrow preparations we have ever had. After ordering this side, we decided we did not need to sample any more of the food. The other patrons plates looked very unadorned, small portions, and unimpressive to us in any visual way. There was nothing to tempt us.\\n\\nUpdate: the business did offer to reimburse us or to comp us some future food to allow us to taste things that might be more to our liking. We may take them up on it since it has been so many years and things may have changed. At this point it is worth giving them another try. Will update my review once we have dined again."},{"name":"Stats","address":"300 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"On a mild Wednesday January 31, 2018 A friend and I visited STATS sports bar for a quick lunch.  We'd researched the parking situation like you must in downtown Atlanta.  The parking garage is directly across the street.  Although the STATS website says they validate for the 311 Marietta Street Parking Garage, but this Garage is marked 275 Baker Street. Luckily, there's a sign out in front of this garage that lists the restaurants that validate for it.  In spite of that, it is SUPER easy to find and perfectly located. Now upon entering STATS we were greeted by the super sweet Chelsea who ended up being our waitress as well.  She promptly took our drink orders and made phenomenal suggestions for our meal.  She knew the menu and made great suggestions.  She was conscientious and always smiling.  As far as decor and seating, STATS is a very large sports bar with endless television viewing options, varied seating arrangements, oh and beer taps. There was no need for a lunch reservation, though reservations can be made.  Now on to the food. Apparently, there is an amazing protein master working in the kitchen, the slow smoked pulled pork sandwich was amazing and the green side salad was fresh and beautiful oh and huge.  All in all this was a great lunch spot, parking was convenient, service was impeccable (thanks Chelsea) and food was delicious.  Oh and ladies-- the diners were about 80% male, probably from neighboring conferences or offices.  LOL!
