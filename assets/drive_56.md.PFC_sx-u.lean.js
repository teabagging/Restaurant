Was surprised how packed this place gets with a line literally out the door even in the rain. It was a little chaotic and confusing for a newbie but I had plenty of time in line to figure Out how it all worked.  Even through all that hipster chaos, I was really impressed by the level of service at the register.  The ladies taking orders were really knowledgeable, patient, and gladly accepted substitutions and made great suggestions. \\nI settled on the Love Alive smoothie with whey instead of dates, and a Demi version of the Goddess with quinoa subbed for brown rice, and squash instead of beets.  \\nThe smoothie was light and tasty. Not necessarily what I'm used to in my own kitchen which is a little creamier and rich, but it was a better fit to go with the meal since it was more refreshing than filling.  \\nThe Goddess bowl was incredible.  I was so pleasantly surprised with this dish, Even though I received with brown rice instead of the Quinoa I had ordered. The Nama shoyu sauce was so creamy and delicious.  I used to think I hated Kale, but it turns out I just never had Kale prepared like this. I'm not even a carrot person, but when drenched in that delicious sauce, I could eat a hundred carrots. The best touch were the two little scoops of butternut squash on the side of the bowl which had a delicious balance of savory and sweet.  I couldn't quite place what gave the squash that delicious flavor but I think there must be a little maple syrup blended in. The only thing that really disappointed me was when the meal was over, when I instantly regretted ordering a \\"Demi\\".  But to be honest, I was surprisingly full after the meal and only my taste buds were wanting. \\nI'm so happy to finally have a healthy food option in the Boston area.

Its cozy enough for a casual dinner. Intimate for a romantic night out. My friend's and I came here to celebrate a birthday. Although there were only three of us in our party, I noticed they accommodated a larger group as well. There's not a lot of space, so reservations are a must. \\n\\nOur menu choices:\\n*Pappardelle Mare e Morti - Pappardelle pasta with seafood in a cognac sauce. Can't go wrong with a bowl of steamed seafood and fresh pasta!\\n*Stracetti con Ruchetta - Thin sliced tenderloin in pinot grigio reduction served with arugula. This dish was so simple and light, yet full of flavor.\\n*Ravioli all' Astice - Crab and Artichoke ravioli in lobster cream sauce. I had a few bites of the other dishes, but this one was mine! Oh my goodness amazing!!! I must have made a \\"mmmmm\\" sound with every bite, it was so delicious. The sauce was my absolute favorite. Not heavy at all. It was so good, I scooped it all up with bread after I devoured the ravioli. I do wish the portion was a little larger, cause I could not get enough of it. Both of my friend's, said they'd probably order this dish the next time we come in for a visit.\\n\\nThe service here is good. We had a reservation, so we were seated right away.

A perfect ending to a great meal.\\n\\nThe reason for taking away a star:\\nI called in twice. Once to make the reservation and the second to attempt to change it. In both instances, whomever I spoke to was a little rude, and I felt like I was being rushed off the phone.

So while I don't do either of those things all the time, I do get a warm fuzzy feeling eating at Life Alive. I like that you can actually see the piles of real, whole vegetables in the back being turned into wraps and dishes, that there is the smell of real spices in the air, and also that at least for today no animals were killed to make my lunch. Personally, I also like milling around in this subculture, where the people are scruffly or pierced or wear unusual makeup or dyed or wearing something funky and definitely not boring. It just feels tremendously welcoming and laid-back.\\n\\nThe food is quite good. If I had kids, I would bring them here as often as possible, because they would actually want to eat their vegetables. There is definitely some skill involved in making a vegetarian meal tasty and satisfying; I tried getting veggie food at nearby Clover but they often didn't manage to do either of those. I'm also addicted to the Life Alive coconut smoothie, which despite being vegan is completely as satisfying as a milkshake and is a great summer drink.

You start with complimentary still or sparkling water and our bread for the day was cranberry bread with cayenne honey butter.  \\n\\nWe split a bowl of clam chowder, perfect appetizer size when split, a bit small for an entree if eaten alone. Probably THE best clam chowder I've ever had, but we are from Arizona.  The ingredients all maintained their individual flavors in the soup from the larger clams to the al dente potatoes, and the sauces part of the soup itself was perfect - not too milk and creamy, more rich and saucy.  The little part of the house biscuit that comes dropped in the center was amazing!  Crisp outer, warm buttery center.  Flavor - perfect. \\n\\nWe then split an order or the lobster roll with hand-cut fries traded in for the kettle chips and coleslaw as well as an order of the lobster roe noodles.  The noodle plate was definitely the winner. It featured braised short ribs (best \\"roast beef\\" I ever put in my mouth, it just melted when cut with my fork and had the most yummy rich and buttery flavor.

We walked right in and sat down, we had a table right by the kitchen so we could see the action. The decor inside is beautiful. Steak reminds me of a mans restaurant--lots of wood, antlers hanging from the ceiling, wine bottle shelves reaching very high--but it's softened by the lighting. I LOVE dark restaurants, they can turn \\"just a meal\\" into something really memorable. \\n\\nWe ordered a bottle of wine (side note: the waiter reccomended a $120 bottle! I had to politely order a $36 bottle. This is a recession after all) and our dinners pretty quickly. I had the pork shoulder appetizer as my meal alongside the chopped salad. Mom had the 6 oz. filet mignon (plenty of food, I even was able to eat some) and Dad had the 10 oz. ribeye. Both cuts of meat were amazing. Different, as individual cuts of meat are more fatty, but cooked similarly with a delicious crust on the top. Our sides were the elbow mac n cheese tart (wonderful) and a wedge salad (bacon on top was very good but I liked my salad better). My parents even splurged for dessert; a dark chocolate mousse cake that was moist, decadent and not to sweet. Overall, a perfect meal.\\n\\nOne thing to be aware of, and it's so minor: I pulled into the Stove Works complex, thinking Steak was next to Rathbun's.

No one checks on you other than to clear your plates and give you the bill. The menu is almost illegible with white out omissions of dishes and virtually all prices raised. Not to mention that the portions have drastically changed. The presentation which was their strong suit is almost nonexistent. The Volcano Roll for instance was shaped like a volcano with shaved fried yam and fried salmon. Now it's almost half the size, with no salmon and is more expensive!

Either way, every single employee is helpful and courteous. \\n\\nEach meat is absolutely unbelievable. The lean brisket and turkey are my personal favorites, girlfriend always gets the St. Louis ribs. So moist, succulent, and the edges of the brisket explode with smokey flavor. The turkey has a rub that must have been sent by the Gods of BBQ food. Their sauce is to die for as well.

When it comes to trying out a new bubble tea shop, I usually opt for a milk tea or taro. You can usually judge how good a bbt shop is by those two drinks as those two are probably the most ordered drinks at a bbt shops. This visit, I ordered their classic milk tea, the peach tea and my mom who was with me tried their grapefruit yakult drink.\\n\\nThe Milk tea was okay. It was a little on the lighter side as far as the tea goes but it was not bad. The tapioca was okay as well. The peach tea was pretty good if you want something without milk. I ordered it because it was the only other drink besides the classic milk tea that they offered in their bulb cup (available until they run out). I love tapioca so I wanted to add it in the peach tea but the cashier said I couldn't add it even if I paid extra (which is weird since I'd be paying more and they'll be filling up my cup with less drink since the tapioca would be taking up space in the cup but whatever). My mom liked her drink but said she couldn't taste the grapefruit flavor as much. I thought it was good if you want a light drink. You can definitely taste yakult!\\n\\nOverall, I think the place is really cute and is a fun place to hang out.

I can totally understand the appeal of this place, and I'm sure if I returned at some point I could have a change of opinion. But it's my duty as a Yelper to report accurately. Keep in mind we are not high maintenance diners.\\n\\nThe wait was pretty long, but that's to be expected for when we arrived (45 mins). We put our name down and walked around a bit, by the time we strolled back we were seated. Not being from the area, a long wait is a good sign we're at the right place.\\n\\nThe menu is really big, which made us a pretty indecisive. Everything sounds good. We asked the waiter what he recommends, he suggested the chilaquiles from the \\"Mexican\\" menu (about 5-10 dishes amongst the standard brunch fare). We took his advice as they were described as breakfast nachos. The menu also hyped up the corned beef hash as their signature item, so I was eager to try it. My girlfriend ordered a simple eggs and bacon with a biscuit. \\n\\nWe ordered some drinks while we waited, the bloody mary and mimosa were pretty good. The mimosa is huge, which is awesome. I ordered a coffee as well but never received it. \\n\\nIt took a long time to get our food. The chilaquiles were very good, but the other dishes fell a little flat. My girlfriend's bacon was undercooked. The corned beef hash was fine, but I was disappointed for the amount of praise they give themselves. It's just not very balanced; there is so much meat it feels like a plate of shredded beef.\\n\\nWhen we were finished, it took a long time to get the waiter over. When he finally came, he presented this digital device that accepts payment on the spot. This is fine, except you have to choose the waiter's tip as he holds this device out for you. This can be a little awkward as he's watching you while you do this.\\n\\nOverall, we were just not impressed. Service was just not attentive enough, food was not good enough (to justify the price). As I mentioned, I feel we could easily have a great experience here. I'm pretty sure anything off the Mexican menu would be good, and if we come back that will be my plan."},{"name":"MOD Pizza","address":"204 SW Yamhill St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I was already a big fan of Mod Pizza and used to drive from SE Portland to Beaverton because that was their closest location to me.

I really like it that they have the \\"mini size\\" pizza because that's the perfect size for one person and it costs about the same as a typical hamburger at a fast food place.

Be prepared for a long wait. They don't take reservation here or do they have a system that will call or text you when your turn is up. I can see why they don't have something of such because there was 3 person working in a tiny small restaurant that sits roughly 15 people. It would be a lot of work for them to manage a call system rather than to walk out to the street and just call the next person when the table is ready. Maybe it's a mind game ? When you have a long queue of people waiting outside of the restaurant for hours to eat the food must be amazing ?  Right ? Don't get me wrong the food was delicious but I don't know about the \\"WORLD FAMOUS\\" tag that everyone seem to be using in their review is fairly accurate. I've never heard of this place before until we were searching for food to eat near the Harbor area.\\n\\nLet's talk about my experience here. We showed up on a Saturday evening at 6 pm and waited 2 1/2 hours before we sat down to eat. There was a line to end of the block and people was just standing there and talking to each other while they wait for their food.  We had a friend that was supposed to meet us there but was on the wrong restaurant, we told to come over and meet us in the Hanover St location and after an hour to look for parking and walking we were still in line. Surprise ! Surprise ! After an hour and half we figured out that the place only take cash so while some of us took turns walking to our closest bank. Don't worry you will find plenty of ATM nearby and you have plenty of time to walk there.\\n\\nWe finally got seated around 10 PM, the waiter was kicking some of the people that were in line because they wouldn't be able to serve them prior to closing time. We ordered the biggest dish we can find since it's been hours past our dinner. The Lobster Fra Diavolo was mentioned a million times in the reviews so we decided that's what we should order. Lobster Fra Diavolo was delicious, the sauce was on point. We shared the dish and ordered it with the squid ink linguine ( over rated , I would prefer regular linguine. I had it before with rice at a Puerto Rican seafood restaurant which was extremely delicious  ). The pasta was a little over cooked in my opinion , I can't tell if it's because of the squid ink or that's how it supposed to be. I usually prefer my pasta a little on the al dente side.The dish was about $91 dollars after tax. \\n\\nOur waiter was super friendly and nice. He took our order fast and food was served very fast as well since there's only a small number of diners at one time. I enjoyed our meal and the experience minus the wait. Can you tell by now that I really hated waiting 2 1/2 hour outside of the restaurant ? Some locals recommended coming during a work day for lunch for a much shorter wait. FYI.\\n\\nI'm giving it a 3 star for now, if the wait was 30 minutes or shorter I'll give it another. If you ever in town and feel the strong urge to eat at place that requires you to wait for hours so that everyone else knows you been here then this is the spot for you.

I especially like that you can customize your dishes.\\n\\nProjected delivery was 7:15, which is smack dab in the middle of my kids' bedtime, so I moved the slider bar to 8:00pm. Unfortunately, this was overlooked, and our food was ready for 7:15 delivery. However, I really appreciate that they called. I asked if I had selected the wrong time with the app, and they were very forthcoming and said it was a mistake on their end. (I love when people just say they made a mistake.) So they asked if they should deliver what was ready, or redo it for 8:00. Since I didn't want the food to go to waste, I said just bring it. \\n\\nIt was piping hot when it arrived, but we got to it later. Still, it was rad! Solid Chinese carryout.

There was a group of 13 of us. When we arrived, it was about 8:30 and there was hardly anyone inside the restaurant, and no one on the patio outside. When we asked to sit on the patio and push some tables together, the hostess told us we couldn't sit more than 6 to a table. Although we found it strange that we couldn't all sit together, we agreed and followed her out to the patio. It was there she told us that we actually couldn't push tables together and that we'd have to split up and sit 4 to a table (there was 5 of us sitting at mine). \\n\\nEach table had a different server, and our waiter was a super nice guy. We ordered our drinks and an appetizer for the table. My husband ordered a margarita; it was nothing to write home about. A few minutes later, our waiter came back and we ordered our food. I ordered the shrimp and fun guy Taquito; it was supposed to come with red bell pepper, beans, potato, cheese, mushrooms, and of course, shrimp. \\n\\nAs we were waiting for our food, we noticed that the other two tables we came with had already gotten their food and had started eating. It took a long time for our waiter to come in and check on how are drinks were and apologize for the wait. Finally, 15 minutes later, our food arrived. Our waiter told us that he was sorry and that the kitchen was \\"backed up.\\" We were the only people at the restaurant at this point! By this point, our other party members were finishing up their meals. I took one bite into my Taquito and realized that it only contained three of the six ingredients it said it came with. I was literally eating a burrito with potatoes, beans, and a little bit of cheese. No shrimp in my shrimp taquito! It was then that I looked up to see that one of the friends I was sitting with took one bite of her burrito, and a bunch of black beans spilled out, when I had clearly heard her ask for no beans. Another one of my friends had asked for no chickpeas in her salad, yet the salad was riddled with them. Sigh. \\n\\nThe waiter did take the black bean infested burrito off the bill, since my one friend only took that bite out of it, so that was nice.

Hubby proclaimed it was the best B&G he's had in Portland. The biscuits are amazing - sweet potato and oh-so moist and tender. The gravy is loaded with large and small chunks of sausage and applied in generous proportion as to produce a pool on the plate.

I know what I'm ordering next time we go!\\n\\nMy only slightly negative comment is that I ordered iced tea and literally had to go into the restaurant to get my first refill, and had to wait for additional refills.

Essentially Rudy's captures the stereotypes in its looks.\\n\\nNow to the BBQ. It is very good and not as expensive as most would believe. A good link of sausage is less than 4 bucks and a pound of brisket is around the same price. The line is fun to wait in because you can grab a drink selling various beers and sodas including Mexican Coke if your into that sort of thing (as for me I don't drink sodas).  The people behind the counter are friendly and inviting basically having a lingo and fun along with it asking you if its your first time and if so ask where you are from. Anyone out of state they call a Yankee which brings a smile to my face. \\n\\nThe BBQ is very good and moist. I enjoy the sausage basically making my own sandwich out of it adding cole slaw and sauce into the sandwich. Delicious. I love their potato salad because its not thick, its creamy, and not heavy as I have had at other bbq joints. I also enjoy the warm cream corn as another delicious side. Same goes for the cole slaw. The brisket is good and you can get a choice of moist or dry.

All totally delicious (and very generous portions for the price - one tube of batter is about 6 bucks, but makes 7 or 8 small pancakes). \\n\\nTurkey bacon? Ridiculously delicious. Thick cut. Full of flavor.\\n\\nI haven't tried the other menu items, but everyone in the restaurant always seems happy with what they're having.\\n\\nThe serving staff are all having a great time - they really seem to enjoy working with each other and seem to believe in their business.

Normally a challenge in and of itself, they currently have some of the spaces torn up doing some form of construction (maybe expanding the lot?) and so there were less spots than normal.  Thank heavens I showed up early!  Then, when you need to leave, most of the spots are blocked by the drive-thru line of cars, so trying to get out of your parking space is more than challenging... So try and limit your need to drive here and park.\\n\\nAll of that being said, this is a great location to come in to work.  They have these great two-person booths.  However, singles take them all the time and like to put their feet up on the opposite seat (nice).  There is no accounting for manners these days, even in the South.  If you are lucky to grab one of these for a meeting, they are just perfect.  They are distanced enough from the other booths, that you have a little privacy - great for one-on-ones.\\n\\nAs for te coffee production, it is usually spot-on.  They train upstairs, so one would hope they get it right 99% of the time.  And my experience is that they usually do.  So, yes, I am a fan of this location, even with the parking challenges.

There was no one at the counter when we walked up. Quickly two other families lined up behind us and we all stood waiting until I eventually went and got some one. They apologized and seated us quickly politely.\\n\\nWe each ordered the chicken wings that we'd heard so much about and got them spicy. At first I was thinking, \\"$14 for six wings? They better be made of gold and glazed with platinum.\\" Turns out they were. To begin with they are enormous wings. It's the entire wing, not just a piece of one like you'd expect. So each of the six wings is like eating 2.5 normal wings. The flavor was mind boggling. They use a fish sauce in their preparation and it completely alters the flavor of the wings in the most delicious possible way. Their wings are what I like to call \\"conversation stoppers\\". We absolutely ate in silence and savored every bite. I wanted try their curry noodle soup afterwards but was too full to go any further.\\n\\nDrinks. Of course they have the expected selection of craft beers and liquors. Their wine was completely unimpressive, but you don't go to Pok Pok for wine. Where they really shined was in their coffees and drinking vinegars. Personally I love drinking vinegars and have been really into them since arriving in Portland. If you don't drink but still crave that \\"bite\\" that booze offers, drinking vinegars are an incredible non-alocoholic alternative. Flavors ranging from sweet to savory, spicy or salty, their drinking vinegars are primo. If you've never had one, you owe it to yourself to try. Their coffee selection was great as well. I tried an iced \\"kafae\\" which was prepared in some regional fashion that ended up being delicious.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is really cool. Tons of wood, nice lighting and in the summer time I'm sure it's wonderful to sit there and enjoy wings, a beer and feel the breeze lilt through the windows.\\n\\nMy only gripe here was the service. Our waitress wasn't rude or anything but rather was just very lackluster. She didn't make recommendations, conversation and only smiled once or twice. Had she been more engaging I likely would have purchased at least two more drinks or maybe stayed a bit longer until I had room for the curry noodle soup.

I said, please seat us wherever as long as it is the shortest wait time, which they said was 30 minutes. The couple after us was told by manager or owner (not sure who he was) if they wanted, they could sit at inside bar with a 5-7 minute wait. We were not told about that option. So upon hearing that, I told the girl we wouldn't mind sitting at bar since it was only going to be 5-7 minute wait. We waited about 30 minutes and got seated at the bar. What?? Asked if we could sit at the tables, there were several available but was told it would be 30 minute wait. I was not going to wait another 30 minutes. Btw, they seated 3 people at those tables- they came in after us- they don't take reservations for small table, so how they got seated there, beats me. \\n\\nOn to the food- kinda lost my appetite after the seating incident. Decided to order two dishes. We ordered the Kai Yaang half order $9  (which is rotisserie chicken- it states it is hen but it tasted like chicken). Btw, the chicken/hen was anorexic because it was the smallest hen/chicken I have ever eaten. It was ok- came with 2 sauces- I liked the fish sauce which had a little kick to it- touch of spiciness. The other dish is  Yam Maheua  Yao- which is a smoky eggplant salad with shrimp which is $13.  I counted 3 shrimps on that plate. I love love eggplant but this dish tasted weird and not flavorful at all. The eggplant did not have the smoky flavor as advertised, the boiled egg, pork, and raw shallots tasted weird and didn't go well together. We ate half of  it. The dishes didn't come with rice so we ordered 1 bowl of jasmine rice ($2) and coconut rice($3). My favorite dish was my bowl of jasmine rice.  The Thai tea was good. The water had a slight hint of coconut in it. I love coconut juice but it tasted weird. I think they should just stick with regular water. \\n\\nIf we were in the area again, I wouldn't give it another try. Not sure if we order the wrong dish or what. I know their signature dish is the chicken wings but not sure if they actually cook it in house, since we saw a big van drop off huge containers of the fried wings.

Pretty good, not great.  I ordered what is reputedly Dubya's favorite dish, the flatiron steak.  It was tough and disappointing.  Much like Dubya's presidency.  But I digress.\\n\\nMy second visit was to last Sunday's brunch.\\n\\nThis brunch buffet was a little like heaven.  The selection was IMMENSE.  So immense, that I took it as a personal challenge to try each and every item.  I did not fail.  Nay, I owned this buffet.\\n\\nAnd while I'm not in the business of giving unsolicited advice - I feel that my total mastery of this buffet on my very first attempt not only qualifies me, but actually charges me, with the responsibility of passing on my knowledge to you fine people.  \\n\\nSo, let me start with lesson one, and just share a brief word of caution about portion control.  Take a small portion of everything the first time through.  I know, I know.  Just trust.\\n\\nIf you hit it too hard, you won't make it through.  Nor will you possess the will to go back for seconds of the stuff that really blew your taste buds.  Keep some room in the tank for later.\\n\\nOkay, that's it for the don'ts.  Easy enough.  Here are the do's: \\n\\nDo get a helping of white chocolate bread pudding, every time you leave the table - no exceptions.  \\nDo buy a cup of coffee - it's quite pleasant.  Do grab a couple turkey pesto croissants.  \\nDo hit the chicken fried steak and chicken strips, with gravy, and - hell - throw a mini-biscuit under there while you're at it.  \\nCinnamon roll.  \\nMorning glory muffin - I didn't even know what the hell it was - it was awesome: do it.  \\nBlueberry muffin.  \\nBanana walnut bread.  \\nSome other kind of bread I can't remember.\\nBasically, everything on the dessert table (waffles optional) - do it.  \\nAnd...might as well reload the bread pudding again while you're there.  Mmmkay?\\n\\nOne other valuable tip for you guys - eat dessert early.  Go ahead and load a small plate right after you've filled your main plate, on your way to the table for round 1.  Then you can hit the second half of the buffet for round 2, finish that, then go back for seconds for round 3, and hit another mini-dessert plate at the end.   Now, I'm not a nutritionist, but here's the way I figure it: you're body's going to be a bit overloaded by the task of digesting all this food.  Just being realistic here.  So you're going to be pretty wasted here in about 30-40 minutes, and believe me, it's just going to get worse.  What you'll need is energy, my friend.\\n\\nSooo, how my little technique works - obviously - is to hit a generous portion of simple dessert carbs at the start of the meal to deliver a quick energy spike to help you digest all the tasty fats and proteins you're about to knock down.  Then, after you've digested all of that, you're definitely going to crash - and hard.  That's where the post-meal carbs come in.  A little time-released pick-me-up, you dig?  And for a little extra kick, wash it down with some of that tasty coffee.  They are good about refilling that coffee, God bless 'em.  Now this is not to say that you won't experience a crash and/or food coma - you will.  This little trick will make sure you make it into work Monday morning, though.\\n\\nI suggest you bring your eating pants, and don't expect to go anywhere or do anything - or even move much - for the rest of the day.  Just lower those expectations right now.   If you have errands to run, things to do - well, honestly you should have planned ahead and gotten it done on Saturday - it's not getting done today.  You may want to shower beforehand, if you plan to at all, because that's certainly not going to happen afterward.  And, though I personally feel I was safe to drive home from Moonshine brunch - you may want to go ahead a call a taxi to be on the safe side.  Just looking out.\\n\\nNow, as to housekeeping matters, I see some different info here in the Yelp reviews.  The buffet is $15.99 as of my visit May 2008, but honestly, most of you probably won't eat again for 24-36 hours afterward, so it's cheaper than McDonald's if you average it out.  If you enjoy morning cocktails, the mimosas and bloody marys were just $3 according to my wife.  I really wasn't paying attention.  To me it's a bit foolish to distract oneself from the task of eating by sipping cocktails, but if it works for you, by all means.\\n\\n10am is gametime.  Get out there, get in line, and get your gamefaces on, or you'll be eating my scraps.

But, certainly not memorable.\\n\\nWe had the Papaya Salad which, was so so bland..in fact, all their dishes (aside from the Fish Sauce Wings) were desperately lacking salt which, is rare for me to say because my palate often times favor the less salty. It was fresh and a nice balance after half those wings but, mediocre despite the fact that it is apparently one of their best dishes.\\n\\nNext up, Khao Soi with Chicken. I liked this dish. It was interesting with ample amounts of chicken (dark meat) and the noodles tasted home-made, it was thin and delicate and the crispy noodles on top added a nice crunch. The curry could have used some work though. It had good flavor but, just like the Papaya Salad, it was bland.\\n\\nI would say, the one dish worth getting is the Fish Sauce Wings though. We had an order of it while waiting for our table at the Whiskey Bar (Also, run my Pok Pok so, they had some of their dishes AND your server at Whiskey Bar will also let you know when your table is ready at Pok Pok since they are partner restaurants which, is pretty smart).

First of all let's start with the service, Matt and Tara, thank you for being the most wonderful and attentive waiters, you took our experience to the next level!Tara's descriptions of the seafood were honest, well thought out, and on point. Matt's wine suggestions, drink pairings and total expertise of the food and drink were so appreciated--he has really mastered the art of describing food in a relatable and focused way.\\n\\nThe ambiance was fun, more of an upscale casual (no barefoot beach bums please), and extremely sensual--you were close with your party, close to others, and up close and personal with the staff -- in a good way!\\n\\nNow to the food. We started with 2 island creek oysters, which are their signature type and 2 other smaller MA type. The Oysters were fresh, briny and savory, and had a perfect salinity. Next we had the crudo and oh my myyyyy was it heavenly!! The fluke was as fresh as it gets and oh so delicate -- on par with Morimoto quality. The crudo was marinated in a citrusy lime/orange and sesame sauce -- YUM. We loved the sauce so much that after our fish was gone we dipped our bread in it. \\n\\nNext we had the mussels in a garlicky white wine sauce with perfectly cooked Israeli cous cous. Unlike most mussel dishes, these were off the shell and made the scooping and shoveling all the easier... Nom nom nom!! The mussels were cooked perfectly, were a great size and texture, and absorbed the soft white wine sauce perfectly while the cous cous retained the stronger lemony and garlic flavor, but wasn't too overpowering--just a great compliment to the delicate mussels and light sauce.\\n\\nFor our last course we wanted to go a little heavy and decided on fish n chips -- possibly our favorite food. Let's just say AMAZING. Perfectly fried and crispy with a flavorful batter yet no moisture was lost on the fish. The tartar was simple and fresh and not gaudy and too pickley like some others can be. After all of the eating and drinking we had done, the portion size was a perfect way to end the night...happy and with extremely satisfied bellies. \\n\\nI want to live in Boston so I can have this restaurant at my doorstep.

You can't have pizza cos it has cheese!\\" WRONG! This pizza joint makes me a slice of vegan pizza (all veggies and NO Cheese) upon request, AND the owner only charge me $1.50 for it too! That's amazing because their standard slices are $1.50 and their daily specials are $2.25. The owner and his staff are very good about just making ONE cheeseless slice for me, -their slices are big, so one slice usually suffice, so I'm more than happy to wait about 15 minutes for it to come out of the oven.

I am drooling thinking about it. We got a side of the sticky rice to put at the bottom of our bowl and it was for sure the missing ingredient. Not that it was ever missing anything. This is the reason I can't sleep at night. It was bliss in a bowl. \\n\\nWe also shared one of their drinking vinegars. It was...interesting. After a lot of talk and some pro con lists we still can't figure out if we like it or not but we all agree it was worth the experience. It was a little early in the day so we didn't get an adult beverages (what a horrible excuse!) but the brother in law is a local bar owner and says that the bartenders here are true bartenders who take the time to not just put some liquids in a glass for you but to honestly create and mix you a little piece of art. \\n\\nIf I haven't made it clear already GO!!!!!!!

I looked at their website before hand and I know there are 2 Pho Hoangs -- one on Rutland and one off 45. I've been to the 45 one and it is good. Their website shows the menu, but nowhere does it say that the menu at the Rutland one is half the offerings of the one on 45. So I go there wanting 2 things which were not even available.\\n\\nNow I always have lower expectations of service at Asian restaurants. I'm cool with it if the food is good. I also know that a lot of times, Asian restaurants will have their kids working there to save money and keep prices lower. Makes perfect sense to me. However, when your kids (the servers) are socially awkward and mumble everything and can't get your order right, then there's an issue. The boy server took an order for 8 main dishes when there was only 7 of us. He didn't know what to do with the extra order and then I saw parents giving him (and us) the evil eye. \\n\\nThe other negative part (besides not having half the menu), is that 2 things I wanted on the menu were not available! No explanation why, just \\"we don't have it.\\" I also don't like that they take only cash. \\n\\nNow food review: 4/5. I had the com thit noung with bi and a side of eggrolls. The eggrolls were really good and big. Usually they are 3/4 or half the size at other places. This was a nice large size like my mom used to make them. The main dish itself was good. I have no complaints about the food and I would eat it again. \\n\\nSo a 1/5 and a 4/5 averages out for a 2/5.

I knew I had to try Pok Pok after my aunt said it was worth waiting an hour for. Let me give you some background, my aunt doesn't wait for anything! Her favorite restaurant could have a 10 minute wait and she would go elsewhere. She always says, \\"I don't live in communist Russia, I shouldn't have to wait for my food\\". So when she said that Pok Pok was worth the wait, I planned my trip across Portland immediately. My dad and I came on a Wednesday afternoon. I figured there wouldn't be a wait considering what a strange time it was, but I guess no wait at Pok Pok is unheard of! After about 20 minutes of waiting in the rain we were seated inside. (I'm not exactly sure how the seating works. We sat indoors at a table by the bar but there appeared to be outdoor tents that people were sitting in as well?) I ordered the Vietnamese fish sauce wings as promised and a side of sticky rice. My dad ordered the Kai Yaang which was half of a game hen stuffed with various Thai ingredients. To my surprise, our food came very quickly! But to my dismay, the $3 side of sticky rice was smaller than my palm... I couldn't believe how much they charge for 3 measly bites of rice! But once I bit into the first wing, none of that mattered.. I was in love! The balance of sweet and spicy, the crunchy skin -- they were perfect! I ate every last bite and didn't even mind that my hair and face were completely covered in sauce. My dad agreed that the wings were a true gem. He was less impressed with his dish however. He said it was pretty boring and under seasoned so I recommend to stick with the wings!

I liked that these used slices of tomato instead of tomato sauce. The Pesto was slightly saltier than I expected, yet the Greece Lightning - which I expected would be the salty one because of the \\"Greek salad\\" toppings, was not.  Our third pizza was a build-your-own carnivorous pizza which included bacon, always a plus. It hit the \\"meat zone.\\" The mediums don't seem to be significantly larger than the smalls, which I guess is why they're only $1 more - even so, they didn't feel like a better deal.

Whether it be the food quality, service, or menu.\\n\\nThe first time I came here (July 2017), we had terrible service. This was when the Bottomless Mimosas was still 20$ and they did not put a time limit on how long you can drink for. Every time the server came up to us, she made us feel like an inconvenience. The food was fantastic though and my eggs benedict was made correctly.\\n\\nThe second time I came here (December 2017), we came for the dinner service and ended up sitting inside with a group of my friends. The service was fantastic this time but the downside was that the beef hash was super salty.

Our drinks were brought out promptly and the waitress checked up on us multiple times to make sure we were good.\\n\\nThe food:\\nEGGS BENEDICT: The eggs benedict looked FANTASTIC, however, when I cut into the eggs, I found out they were not runny at all. Other than that, the dish tasted great. Even with the overcooked eggs.\\n\\nCRISPY PORK FLAUTAS: This is something I have never seen on the menu before which a party member of mine ordered. The flautas were great and they had just the right crispy texture to make it a top choice of mine.\\n\\nQUINOA: I've never really dabbled in the quinoa world and it's not really something I would order as my top choice, however, they made a fantastic quinoa dish. It was so impressive that the next time I go to brunch here, I will probably order it. If they still have it on the menu...\\n\\nThe Drinks:\\nYou can't really go wrong with the drinks. We ordered 2 carafe's of mimosas, however, instead of them mixing them, we asked them to put the juices (orange and grapefruit) in another cup so we can mix them ourselves.\\n\\nAll in all, I'm not too sure what to make of this place yet.

Now I know that Hae Paul's sort of does the fusion Korean/American, but the bulgogi was served differently then what I thought. I usually expect bulgogi to come with lettuce, garlic, samjang, etc. But this lamb bulgogi was served stir fried with some veggies over a bed of white rice. The portion was a little small, but it still tasted good. I really wanted to wrap it all in lettuce though.\\n\\nNow I decided to see if they have anything for dessert. I tried what I could only describe as a cupcake sized reeses cup that was filled with cream instead of peanut butter. The filling was great, however a cold, cupcake sized chocolate cup is hard to eat. The bottom of the cup was thick and resisting any attempt to be broken apart.\\n\\nService was excellent.

Personally I think its better than Shin Jung on Colonial in Viet Town. So lets get started.\\n\\n5/5 Bulgogi: Perfectly seasoned, Bulgogi is my favorite IF its not too sweet & honestly this was perfect. You get to cook it yourself over table top stoves, so not only you get a dinner but you get a dinner & a show. \\n\\n5/5 Kalbi: Very nice and tender, seasoned very well. It reminded me of Korean bbq in Las Vegas or SoCal. You can't go wrong with the infamous Kalbi ribs, it was very easy to eat, came right off the bones. \\n\\n5/5 Sides: Like most Korean BBQ spots they offer a ray of complimentary seasonal sides of Red Leaf Lettuce, Vermicelli Noodles (Japchae), Potato Salad (Gamja Salad), Chilli Pepper Paste (Gochujang), Seasoned Laver (Miyeok Muchim), Seasoned Bean Sprouts (Kongnamul), Diced Radish Kimchi (Kkakdugi), & Kimchi.

Finally, after much anticipation I had time to head over and treat myself to a bowl of vegetarian Pho soup. \\nLike I mentioned before, this small restaurant is very simple, with limited seating and a simple decor. As we walked in we were welcomed with a smile from a lady behind the counter and a young monk who was helping out with the food preparation. We eagerly looked over the menu, which is quite limited with its 5-6 choices. You can also pick from a variety of ready to eat items that are located on the counter.   \\nWe  ordered the spicy noodle soup and the vegetarian pho soup. Both were delivered warm and with a side of fresh bean sprouts, mint, and Thai basil.  I enjoyed my spicy soup and especially the tvp ( textured veg protein) that was floating in the savory broth, which was there to replace the thinly sliced raw beef that is usually found in traditional non-vegetarian pho bo. \\nBoth soups had a delicious blend of wild mushrooms that infused the broth with an earthy flavor and added a great bite to the soup.\\nAlthough the soups were very filling,  there was still room for dessert.  On my way out I picked up a Che Ba Mau, or rainbow drink made with coconut milk, sugar, and tapioca jelly. Very delicious and refreshing, unlike anything I've had before. \\nThe location is very easy to pass by as it is huddled away in a small corner among all the hustle and bustle of the Colonial Dr. area.

Start with cocktails, both the Blood Orange-Sage Daiquiri and the Refashioned (their version of the Old Fashioned) were classically made, no complain from me who is typically very critical. Will also recommend Ginger Wolf, which had a good mixture between Brandy and Rye and not overshadowed by the sweetness from the syrup, which to me is how a proper cocktail should be.\\nSince it was during Dine out Boston restaurant when we had visited, we tried the prix fixe menu offered. I had order the duck liver mousse as my first course, and flat iron steak for my second. Both of which were well delightful. The flavor of the duck liver mousse was plentiful but not overwhelming, and the steak cooked to medium rare as I had requested, served with an au jus/gravy that was well paired, bringing out an abundance of natural steak taste.\\nIf I were to be harsh, I would say the weakest point of the meal was the dessert. The espresso beignets although were beautifully presented, was rather mundane in taste. However that does not diminish the overall experience for me at the restaurant, as everything else was meeting or exceeding expectation.\\nI've noticed a 5 and a 7 course set menu, both of which looks extremely appetizing.

Based on the solid Yelp reviews we decided to give this place a try.  Tonight we started off with Caprese made with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, fresh basil and oregano atop of a bed of salad drizzled with EVOO.  The portion size is on the larger size so this would be perfect for sharing.  The mozzarella was a little harder than what I am accustomed to but nonetheless was very good.  The fresh tomato slices with the bed of salad was great.  We drizzled some balsamic vinegar which went perfectly with the salad.  I ordered the fettucine al funghi porcini which was made with fresh fettucine with porcini mushrooms, garlic and parsley.  The sauce reminded me of the white wine sauce typically made in clam linguini with the fusion of the mushroom taste.  It was a nice somewhat deep flavor.  This pasta dish is definitely for the mushroom lover.  My friend ordered the ravioli di spinach al pomodoro which is ravioli filled with spinach with tomato and basil sauce topped with Parmesan cheese.  This was light but the tomato sauce was fresh and very flavorful.  A simple dish with not too much complexity allows you to taste all the fresh ingredients.  This was a fantastic and more healthy alternative entree.  \\n\\nThe ambiance was cute and charming.  The staff is very friendly.  Since the pasta and ingredients are all fresh, entrees do take longer than most but it's well worth the wait.  Ours took about 30 minutes to get.  Portion sizes are perfect, not too skimpy but not so large that you'll need to get a wheel barrel to wheel yourself to the car.

Filled with zucchini, yellow squash, red bell, Anaheim and Serrano peppers, onions and crimini mushrooms - after one bite you'll totally forget about meat. The dish is also served with handmade flour tortillas and a myriad of toppings. We opted to add a marinated portobello mushroom and grilled baby shrimp for some extra goodness.

Skinny margs are hard to craft and Chuy's serves up a pretty tasty one.

There was a lot of meat, and it was cooked nicely, but there was no sauce, and hardly any other flavor to the dish. The sides were minute, tiny, with not much flavor either. Strangely undersalted. I had to add salt and pepper to my food and I never do that. We had some sides that were pretty good, the bread at the beginning was pretty good. They also give you these homemade salted caramels at the end which are fun and yummy. We got a desert which was pretty good.

It has a very classy feel in there, and I expected more of a casual restaurant.  The waitress was great!   They serve soda in glass bottles, and it's the all natural stuff, like Coke with real sugar.  They have an ok selection of wines, but it's really limited, so if you're particular about your wine, be prepared to try what they selected for the evening.  \\n\\nThe chefs do a killer job!  We were amazed with everything at the table, in terms of taste and presentation.  I do recommend you come here more than once and try many things.  \\n\\nCONS:   Long wait, even with reservation.  Avoid the place during Sox games, and probably on Weekend nights, unless you don't mind the wait.  Parking is a pain in that area in general.  During Sox games, it's a nightmare scenario.  The place is pricey, so be prepared to drop steakhouse money (maybe a little less).\\n\\nThe menu seems a bit limited, but that can be a neutral thing, since they specialize in what they make.  I don't recall seeing alot of variations of salmon or shrimp dishes, that some seafood restaurants offer.   Entr√©e wise, there were probably 2-3 items that were calling my name, and I suspect I'd stick to those with every visit.

The service was a little bit off. We were with my kids and they didn't really seem kid friendly over there. On top of that the server seem to be irritated when we asked questions about certain dishes in the menu. He wasn't very attentive to us. My husband asked the server if he could bring a dessert for me for my birthday. He gave me my dessert with a candle and just walked away. My 4 year old son even made a comment and asked \\"Mommy how come noone is singing to you\\" lol which I didn't really mind, but say something when you give me the dessert with a candle on it just to know you acknowledge that we were celebrating a special occasion. Last but not least, what i found very annoying was that there was a table next to us, with a little baby all of the workers and i mean almost every single one from the cook, bartender, and other servers came out to greet this lady and baby and asked how her food was blah blah and was very extra nice to them... who knows maybe she worked there or something and was on maternity leave. Because everyone kept coming out greeting her and she kept showing them pictures etc. it annoyed us, because they were rude to us, and seemed annoyed when we asked questions etc, and for me i felt like part of it was because my 1 yr old daughter would cry from time to time.

Perhaps because it's located in a strip mall next to a grocery store my expectation was perhaps not so high, that the atmosphere really surprised me. \\n\\nService: Fantastic, spot on service. Don't remember our waiter's name, but I'm willing to bet he is the only Asian 6' 3\\" waiter working there. \\n\\nFood: If nothing else, I hope someone at this restaurant gets this message: \\"Chef, put down the salt shaker, seriously\\".\\n\\nFor my appetizer I ordered the Manhattan Chowder. Everything about it should have made it some of the best I've had; appearance, texture, aroma, etc. One thing though, it was nearly inedible because it was way too salty. \\n\\nFor my entree I ordered the Red Snapper vinaigrette. The first one they brought to my table was so over cooked I sent it back. Chef, here is another message: \\"If the Red Snapper needs a steak knife to cut it, then it's over cooked. Furthermore, you should NEVER, EVER,  send out a bad plate in hopes the customer won't notice, we do\\". When they brought my second plate the fish was better, not great. And to add to the experience, the saut√©ed spinach also was way too salty. So again, Chef, for the love of God and those of us who love well prepared food, put down the salt shaker before you hurt someone like you did to my first experience with this restaurant.\\n\\nIn conclusion, given the atmosphere and service this seems like a good choice for oysters and martini's (assuming they don't let the chef near either)."},{"name":"House of Tofu Soup","address":"4651 Garden City Road, Ste 1110","city":"Richmond","stars":"4","text":"Mmmmm spicy Korean dishes on a cold Vancouver day. \\n\\nDecided to try this place after I ate at another restaurant in the area on Tuesday. What a good find :) I love that the menu is limited, and they do such a good job with each dish. Sometimes you don't want to spend 20 mins going through a 200 item menu like pho restaurants or Fusion cafes. \\n\\nWe started off with the Stone Bibambap which came with all the complimentary Korean side dishes (kimchi, bamboo, pumpkin soup, seaweed, and my favourite mashed potato...there was just something about it...sweet and had corn?). The rice was hot in the stone bowl and was crunchy on the bottom which we loved. It was topped with vegetables, a raw egg and slivers of bbq beef. The sauce that came with it wasn't very good but it also wasn't necessary. \\nNext we had the Mixed (seafood, beef) Tofu Soup that also had a stone rice bowl. This time they scooped the rice out for you and soaked the stuck rice with tea. We prefer the crunch over the softened tea rice so if you do too I would suggest asking them not to do that. You can order different levels of spiciness (we got \\"HOT\\")and ingredients (beef, pork, seafood, dumplings, mushrooms etc). It wasn't too spicy, just enough to add to the flavour of the dish. The down side to this dish was the minute amount of seafood in it. There were maybe 5 mini shrimps, couple pieces of clam; not worth $10. \\nFinally we had Japchae. Boy was this a large, must share dish. It was delicious. Nothing much to criticize about this one. \\n\\nI loved that every soup that came out of the kitchen was bubbling all the way to the table. Makes your mouth water. I am eagered to try the vegetable pancake next time.  Will let you know how that goes :)\\n\\nOnly thing that prevented it from being a 5/5 is the service. Not that they were rude or dismissive but that they were understaffed. Their priority is to serve you your food which we of course didn't mind but it took us 30 mins to pay our bill. We had to flag 3 waitresses down to get our bill. Then finally walk up to the counter to pay, which took another 5 mins cause they didn't know where our bill was. \\n\\nFree Parking =bonus :)"},{"name":"Summer Moon Coffee - Buda","address":"316 N Main St","city":"Buda","stars":"4.5","text":"Nice quaint little place tucked away in Buda to visit, study and get a great cup of coffee.

Technically the trucks can move, but they all seem to sit conveniently across several locations downtown. Thai Sky sits on the intersection between Oak and Fifth along a row with other food trucks. The primary difference is Thai Sky is usually open for dinner until 8pm, a time when crowds are substantially smaller than lunch (and is incidentally the only meal when I can actually go). Downtown parking is plentiful, particularly past 7pm. There's even a (sort of) eating area on the sidewalk by the truck.\\n\\nFood:\\n\\nRight up my alley - cheap, fresh, and delicious. Every dish is made to order, right in front of you (which means it's fresh and hot - right off the wok!). In a blind taste test, I think the food would compare favorably against most Thai takeout/casual restaurants. Most dishes end up having the same sort of taste (stir fried basil, onions, and bell peppers), but that's hardly a bad thing if you're into basil. You can also specify the level of spice in your dish, but note this place has an \\"authentically\\" Thai scale. I'm usually one for challenging myself with really spicy dishes, but their \\"8/10\\" is pretty legit. To make your next day easier, I would recommend topping out at a 6/10. =)\\n\\nI've honestly not had anything bad from the menu, but their mainstays are definitely the starch (rice/noodle/rice noodle) dishes. I'm a big fan of their Pad See Ew and Yakisoba (fried noodles - not sure how authentically Japanese, but hey, it's tasty), as well as some of the more vegetable oriented stir frys - the Basil, Onion, and Bell Pepper or the Eggplant Basil. As far as protein goes, Shrimp and Chicken are winners, while the beef leaves something to be desired (can be a bit dry and tasteless).\\n\\nService: \\n\\nService is fast, efficient, and very friendly. The owner clearly loves his job, and always has a smile on his face. As every dish is made to order, and there is only one chef, I suspect wait times can really add up when there are many folks in line, but considering the quality of the dishes I'm impressed by the speed at which he can turn out the dishes. Besides, waiting for freshly-cooked Thai food isn't bad at all when you can strike up a good conversation while he's cooking. Usually with food this cheap one doesn't expect much from service, but at Thai Sky you can have the best of both worlds - cheap, quality food AND the owner always seems to be in a great mood. Extra points for me here.\\n\\nI also like that even if you don't have cash, they still take most credit cards with a nominal fee ($0.50). Very convenient, although a bit awkward when the credit card reader doesn't work. Luckily even in this case there are Chase and Bank of America ATMs within close walking distance.\\n\\nValue: \\n\\nWhen one considers its quality, this place is phenomenal value. I don't think there's a single entree priced above $7. Soft drinks ($1) and teas are also very reasonably priced. Portions are absolutely gigantic (definitely Asian American portions). I would consider myself a pretty big eater, but let's just say I don't plan on going to the gym after a meal here if I finish the entree (which I always do because it's delicious). Honestly I'm not sure how these guys (and other food trucks in Portland) make money. Considering the quality of food and portion size, I'm not sure if I've had Thai food with the same price-to-goodness ratio outside Thailand. \\n\\nOverall: \\n\\nA go-to for takeout and a solid 4 stars.

I had the vegetable pho -- good mix of veggies -- but the broth was so incredibly sweet that I couldn't eat it. I literally picked the veggies out, and tried to get them to drip dry before eating. I did call the waitress over and ask whether it was supposed to be so sweet... I'm not a pho novice and I'd never had anything quite this sweet, but I figured I'd ask. I mainly got an eye roll back and a half hearted offer to get me something else. Well at that point my dining companion was nearly half done with his (which was also sweet but not as sweet as mine), so I declined. \\n\\nIf you tend to like dessert for dinner, this might be your place, but if you're interested in a more traditional pho, I'd look elsewhere."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"GREAT experience and GREAT food.

I will add it was my first time having lobster and clams.

For someone that's been unsure of trying a normal corndog their whole life, this was sort of the most rocking thing.

Okay, they had me at macaroni and cheese, but the addition of green chile, beans, corn and chicken sort of made the whole decision thing a non-factor.

My martini was awesome, but the mint julep was a smidgen too sweet (still quite drinkable, though). \\n\\nFor lunch, I ordered the big red's BLT with a fried egg ($10.95) and my friend ordered a salad ($6.50-12.95). We also shared the beer battered asparagus appetizer ($8.95). The asparagus was amazing- I would highly recommend it. My BLT came with crispy bacon, arugula, tomatoes and a fried egg. I don't even normally like BLTs, but this one sounded so interesting that I went for it. No regrets!!!! It also came with french fries that were quite thick (more like wedges) and were just as good as the sandwich. \\n\\nThe meal was cheap, and kept me full for almost the whole day- I didn't even eat dinner afterward. The servers were nice, and the food was amazing. If I lived nearby, I'd definitely be a regular here. There were so many other things on the menu I wanted to try as well!

If you go during happy hour the mocktails and ginger beer are $1 more than a pint of beer, but it is nice to have something available to drink besides water and pop. \\n\\nAs for the food, the happy hour portions (while well priced) are a bit small.

Upon entering the place, I was first struck with alarm at the feeling that I'd just intruded into someone's home, namely the two north African grandmothers who were sitting and chatting with two little girls, presumably grandchildren, in tow. The couple sitting by the window eating, however, along with the very warm welcome we immediately received from one of the ladies, who we later learned is named Aliya, quickly assuaged all worries. \\n\\nThis place is small and extremely cozy due partially to the decoration and partially to the proprietors. The specialty is Tunisian food and they offer a number of mezze dishes that can work as an appetizer for one or provide a few bites to each member of a party of six. My group chose the latter route and got to sample five mezzes in all. Some particular standouts were the zaatar cocca (caramelized onions on a pita) and the very simply constructed dates and labneh (literally just dates with thick \\"greek-style\\" yogurt but both ingredients were exceptional). \\n\\nI ordered the appetizer du jour for my entree and had more than enough food. It was mushroom stew with ricotta ravioli and it was killer. Best of all, it only got better the longer it sat and all the flavors mingled as I ate it. \\n\\nTwo of my party got the white and red meat plate and seemed a little underwhelmed and the other three got the eggplant entree with couscous which I tasted and thought was pretty good but certainly preferred my own dish. I guess I'd recommend going heavy on the mezzes and trying the specials. \\n\\nWe also of course ordered a pitcher of rose lemonade for the table that was outstanding. The seven spice chocolate cake piqued my interest but the group was set on Toscaninis for dessert so I let it go.

It's a relatively small place, and on a Thursday night was completely full! It feels a little like walking into Italy, it's nothing fancy but a nice ambiance.

First the bread; my mom and I are picky, often finding bread too sweet but this bread was the real deal and absolutely delicious. We each had a very different pasta dish with the homemade pasta and both were phenomenal.

The place has been renovated but still a little smelly. Don't wear nice clothes unless you want to smell like Chinese food.\\n\\n3.

The so called seafood noodle only had around 5 pieces of chopped shrimp and mini scallops, not to mention the noodle was also soggy and tasteless. I am not an expert on food but I know what bad food taste like. Just few bites from each dish and my family and I were ready to get out of there.

Cheap labor is great if the work actually gets done, however SIX customers walked out because of all the mess ups. To make matters worse, two employees that were SUPPOSED to be pressing the dough and adding the pizza components were busy ignoring the customers and instead talking about how the employee that called out needs to be fired.

Both seemed like amateur cooking experiences from someone that just learned how to cook. \\n\\nThe falafels had a strange after taste (baking soda-like) and I was disappointed to pay $11.50 + $1 (tip). I wasn't able to continue eating due to this and left still hungry. The plate was also very tiny. They stated pita but it was very thin slices of pita. Even if I was able to stomach eating the plate, it was such little food I would've still been hungry.\\n\\nMy wife's pizza was not even comparable to a tombstone pizza which is quite sad... and that was $8 + $1 tip. Moreover the pizza looked like a kids portion.\\n\\nI'm such an idiot to tip at the time of ordering. Should've waited to taste the food. Lesson learned. Honestly I wouldn't even eat that food again if it was free.\\n\\nOverall the food was terrible and way too expensive. Will not be going back again.

My wife and I love everything Thailand including the food and we thought we'd check out what this is all about. Well if I were to describe it in one word, it's overhyped. I agree with some of the more critical reviews. This place is sodium city. Like I understand the wings are made with fish sauce and all but I'm not even sure this is Andy Ricker's vision for the wings since they were salty to the max. Or perhaps as typical America goes, this is exactly his vision. I do like the fact that they used some meaty chickens for the wings but man lay off on the sodium. Same goes for a couple of the other dishes we had including the pork belly and shrimp vermicelli clay pot. Less is more for sure. One other comment about the food. The sticky rice is laughable. The portion is not even enough for one person and comes in plastic baggy. For 3 bucks... Come on now. \\n\\nOther than the food, the service was variable depending on who came over. The guys that brought the food out looked like they wanted nothing to do with the customers as they just dropped the food on the table, mumbled the name of the dish and walked away. Maybe going for the authentic Asian experience. \\n\\nMy final complaint on the night is that the restaurant is located in a house and a portion of it is in a covered shelter outside.

I brought a different friend along, and we gave it a shot.\\n\\nWe got the Redneck Totchos, Southern Comfort Burger, and the Shrimp & Grits Stuffed Burger. Long story short, it was an entirely different experience.\\n\\nLast time, the Southern Comfort burger had pockets of spice (instead of being well-distributed) and there was pretty much no cheese in the burger, just macaroni. It was also very dry. This time, the burger had a perfect pink, bursted with just the right amount of cheese, and had a subtle spice that kicked in after the sweet BBQ sauce. The totchos were also really fantastic with much more toppings, so it wasn't like just eating plain tatertots.\\n\\nThe Shrimp & Grits Burger was undoubtedly one of the juiciest and most savory things I've ever eaten. The litany of flavors somehow managed to be identifiable and perfectly complimentary. I think it was a little too much for my taste, but I would happily recommend it to someone who loves savory food. It was definitely a burger unlike anything I've ever had.\\n\\nJust a heads up: these burgers are enormous. I barely ate half of mine.\\n\\n\\nOLD REVIEW: I live nearby, and I've run past the place a million times. After seeing the \\"Voted Best Burger in Atlanta\\" banner so many times, I gave in and tried it out\\n\\nI went with three friends. We ordered the black bean burger and the \\"Southern Comfort\\" burger (Stuffed with mac n' cheese). We also ordered the Nacho Tochos. We ended it with their Chocolate Lava cake.\\n\\nIt was all pretty bad, honestly. I'm not a very picky burger person in any way. The black bean burger was simply dry and didn't have much flavor at all. It barely had any sauce on it. The Southern Comfort burger was dry and simply tasted bad. The mac n' cheese inside tasted flavorless and had no substance (It was as if they half-boiled some macaroni and put it in the burger). There was also some spicy sauce, but it tasted cheap like tabasco. The lifeless mac n' cheese with cheap spicy sauce and sweet BBQ sauce was simply an awful combination of flavors. I honestly couldn't finish it. The Nacho Tochos had little toppings, so it was mostly like eating expensive tatertots (which were admittedly decent). The lava cake wasn't hot at all. It was kind of like a small bundt cake that had hot fudge poured in the middle. I think the idea is that the hot fudge should heat up the whole cake, but it doesn't work like that.\\n\\nHonestly, I was really really surprised. I had heard great things about the place, and the reviews here are stellar. The food was just dry and lifeless. Maybe the brunch is better, but my whole experience was incredibly disappointing.

Recently they were offering vegan tortilla soup and cashew cheeze quesadilla specials, both of which I desperately wish were offered all of the time, as I would eat them at least 3 times a week given the opportunity.

The salmon tartare was absolutely awesome, especially if you like a little heat.

And even still, there are at least 4 other appetizers I can think of that I want to go back to try.  The lobster roe noodles - well let me say that I ordered them both because they looked delicious and because I'd seen a bunch of people raving about them on yelp.  They WERE good, but I think I was expecting to be more wow-ed than I was.  And - not that this is in any way a bad thing - the portion is honestly normal.  You can eat almost the whole thing and be hungry in a couple hours - this isn't your typical plate of pasta at a restaurant.  I suggest you order it one of the first few times you go, but if not on the first and you don't go back, it was probably better than whatever you ordered.

I ordered the The Dark Chocolate Cremeux (yes, it deserves capitals) fucking blew my mind.  It's quite possibly it's only because I've just recently discovered that chocolate and passion fruit (the sorbet on top of which it sits) is one of my favoriate combinations EVER, but...no, it's not ONLY because of that as I recall the texture of the cremeux and the depth of the chocolate made me sigh every time I took a bite too.  And lets not start on the white chocolate milk crumble.  WHITE CHOCOLATE MILK CRUMBLE.  Should I say it again?  Sorry I'll move on.  The ICOB doughnuts with lavender pastry cream and red berry coulis were also phenomenal.  I'm not even going to say anything else about them so as not to take away from your own, perfect experience.  \\n\\nThe end."},{"name":"Habibi Lebanese Semoran","address":"6651 S Semoran Blvd, Ste 108","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I love this place.

Went on a Sunday night and it was only about half full so the service should have been right on point.

The locks on the bathroom doors of of both male and female restrooms did not have locks. There was a small hand written sign that said \\"please knock before entering\\" because they had not fixed the locks which was impossible to notice so i walked in on someone using the restroom. There was a long hair in my ginger. No one asked how anything was so we didn't have a chance to give any feedback. We had to flag down our waitress to ask for more drinks. The tuna on our salmon roll did not taste super fresh as it should at an $18 roll. But the crab dish we had was phenomenal.

Not welcoming. Had his finger on his chin as he looked us over in a weird affected manner. I felt like we were being judged for our worthiness to even walk in the door. He proceeded to mumble a bit and then found a table for us.\\n\\n\\nNext red flag came about when the waitress was talking about the tequila used in the Mojitas.\\n\\nCeviche had no flavor on the top half of the mound of fish. Didn't seem mixed well. Just didn't have that tangy bite though even as a bit more flavor was found in the bottom half. The plantain chips included were ridiculous. They were cut and fried tiny round chips resembling trail mix banana chips. The ceviche really doesn't work with these sized chips. It's better to be eaten with just a fork. I've had better fried plantains and ceviche before. A good aesthetic tip would be to fry the plantains lengthwise since it's easier to eat with the ceviche in that shape.\\n\\nBut the most disgusting part of the experience was the paella. I've had amazing paella before. This wasn't it. It was just colorless white clumpy mess in a white bowl. Three pieces of soft sugary plantains topped the rice. If you search for paella on the Internet, the pictures you find will be completely opposite what you will find at this restaurant. There was no flavor. But the final insult to the legacy of this famous dish were the shrimp that were just gross. It was like some kind of pre boiled shrimp from HEB that hadn't even been de-veined. Just disgusting. Honestly,  it's probably all they could really do for $18. But what is delivered to the table makes you still ask yourself, $18 for this shit?\\n\\nIn fairness, the manager or chef or somebody refunded us some of the bill.

We sat right next to the open kitchen downstairs and it was a cool place to sit - watching the cooks at work. We started off with a trio of spreads that came with some fried plantains. The highlight was some mashed up chickpeas, the tapenade was delicious and the artichoke spread was ok - although still good. My girlfriend got the grilled butternut squash. It had a great smoky flavor but my GF thought that there was too much sweet chili sauce on top. I got the pork roast with gnocchi. The dish was good but didn't knock my socks off. The pork wasn't that tender, which is what I expected for a pot roast and the gnocchi was a little too soft for my tastes.

This cafe is like something you'd find in San Francisco, Seattle or New York. The level of craftsmanship in their pastries is on another level. They serve coffee roasted by Tandem Coffee Roasters which is delish, and then they put their special touch and deliver beautifully poured lattes and perfectly tampered espressos.\\n\\nPro tip: they don't offer flavored syrups (when I asked, I felt dumb, so hopefully this pro tip saves you). A lot of high end espresso bars and classy coffee shops don't offer sugary syrups, so if you're looking for something on the sweeter end, order a mocha or a New Orleans style coffee. The New Orleans typically comes iced in a mason jar and is seriously to die for.\\n\\nAs for the food, you cannot go wrong. MY favorites include the egg sandwich (this can also easily be split in 2 with a knife), the cinnamon roll (also recommend splitting this) and the blueberry tart. But whatever you pick is sure to delight. Stick around for some insta-worthy shots of your coffee and snacks, plus the vibes there are cool and calming. \\n\\nPro tip #2: they don't offer WiFi, this is the kind of place to bring friends and family, or a good book"},{"name":"Ninja Grill","address":"5253 SE 82nd Ave, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Cute name?

I got the spicy chicken which actually just tastes like grilled chicken. Poured some teriyaki sauce on it and created teriyaki chicken :) Not very spicy at all if you ask me which was disappointing. Both of us also got the ribs which were also just ok - lots of Asian fusion places out there have higher quality ribs but for the price that you can get them for at Ninja Grill, it's nothing to complain about. The beau also got spicy pork which is made Korean style and very flavorful! I highly recommend the spicy pork because it's nothing like I've ever tasted (in a good way!) :) \\n\\nThey forgot our order or gyoza but the people working at Ninja Grill were so sweet we happily waited for it to come out.

We have two small children and dates are hard for us to manage and when we do, our time is precious. \\n\\nWe arrived at about 5:30pm and asked to sit at the sushi bar.  Our first issue was that there was nowhere to put our coats.  We ended up putting them on the stool next to us, but a coat rack would have been nice.  The chefs greeted us but when asked if we could order sushi from them, they said we had to order from the waitress.  She came over within two minutes and asked if we'd like drinks.  We ordered a dirty martini and a glass of plum wine.  We also placed our food order which included miso soup, seaweed salad and a number of sushi items.  We waited for over fifteen minutes with no acknowledgement from the chefs or the service staff.  We finally got our drinks but I had to ask for water after twenty minutes and it took an additional five to get it.  We finally asked the sushi chef if we could get our miso soup at least and he asked the waitress to come over to us.  She did not come for another five minutes.  By this point we had been waiting for some kind of food for over half an hour.  There was a couple who came in a few minutes after us who also sat at the sushi bar who ordered, received their food, ate, paid and left in the time we were waiting.\\n\\nWe finally got up and left.  This was absolutely unacceptable service.  We arrived and placed our order before the big rush had started.  We should not have had to wait more than five minutes for our drinks and should never have had to ask for water.

When we go back I'll ask for a booth again and ask to be in her section! She made the night so much fun.\\n  As for the food, it wasn't cheap, but it was worth it! I saw a couple of reviews that said it was overpriced and I disagree. High quality food isn't cheap. The oysters are a must have! They were fresh and delicious.

It was all contained in a single, standard carry out container.\\n\\nI bit into my first bite and the sauce was thick, sweet, tangy and the batter was a great light crispy fried chicken taste I was craving, however the way the chicken was cut up and portioned it was hard to diagnose where to bite into on a piece to get any meat....that is the real disappointment here. The spicy version was great and extremely tasty, it was just not the greatest pieces of meat which became disappointing right away.\\n\\nIt was supposed to be a whole chicken I suppose, but there clearly were no drumsticks to be had (which I look forward to eating when doing fried chicken) and no thighs or clearly designated breast pieces. It was just all hacked up random pieces of the bird that were fried up. \\n\\nPerhaps im just a spoiled American, but I was hoping for some clearly defined pieces of meat. A few breasts, thighs, drumsticks, wings...u know standard fried chicken?...Especially for almost a $20 price tag.\\n\\nInstead, it became difficult to know what you were biting into as you dissect into the pieces to determine edibility and it was hard to find nice chunks of chicken and completely forget about a big bite of juicy tender white chicken.\\n\\nI have to agree with the other 1-star reviewer that these were perhaps not the best pieces of meat they could use and they are skimping on the cuts to not waste any of the chicken and perhaps use the best pieces of the bird for other dishes. \\n\\nThere was no big juicy, meaty pieces of chicken like I was expecting, and wanting.\\n\\nNot completely terrible as it is tasty, but I certainly cannot recommend or would ever probably return myself for it. Disappointed because it would be great if they used better pieces of meat and I would love to bring them some drumsticks and breasts to fry up for me because they would be outstanding."},{"name":"Barlow","address":"737 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Pricey drinks and small plates in downtown bar.

If you want to hear about how a previous experience I had from another Peruvian restaurant almost made me give up on Peruvian food forever, please continue:\\n\\n\\nLast week my boyfriend and I both tried Peruvian food for the first time from a different Peruvian restaurant in Belleview and it was very disappointing. We both ordered skirt steak medium rare and we were both served chewy, very well done steak. The Tacu Tacu was bland and fried improperly. We decided to go back and give it another chance the very next day and we were disappointed again. We both ordered pork sandwiches but my pork tasted like it had been microwaved, they forgot my salsa criolla, and I couldn't tell that the pork had been fried... my boyfriends sandwich had so much sauce that he couldn't taste the meat. I thought maybe I just don't like Peruvian food, but I noticed \\"Taste of Peru\\" on the way to my terminal and I thought I'd go there to give Peruvian food one last chance and so I could compare their food to the bad experience I had in Belleview... I am so glad I did give Peruvian food that chance, because at \\"Taste of Peru\\", both our steaks were cooked beautifully, perfectly... My Tacu Tacu was packed with flavor and fried beautifully.

Sam LaGrassas is for real.  I decided to go to this Boston deli when I saw it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives on the Food Network and then researched it on yelp. While on a weekend getaway in Boston with the wife I decided to give it a try. I had heard about the huge lines that usually form at Sam's( which is only open for lunch Mon-Fri) and decided to go after the lunch break working crowds. My plan worked and when we arrived there were only about ten people in front of us. Amazingly it only took about two minutes until we arrived at the front of the order counter where the now infamous owner was waiting for us. We barely had enough time to figure out what we wanted but I decided to order the Corn/Beef and Pastrami on Rye Sandwich Platter with Fries and Slaw. Simone went with a vegetarian Portabello, Cheese and Pesto Sandwich.  I ordered my Sandwich and watched as about thirty pounds of house cured Beef and Pastrami was thinly sliced on the slicer and then slapped down quickly on homemade rye, topped with slaw and another slice of rye and quickly cut just in time to join the straight from the fryer french fries. The whole process took about 30 seconds and four people...amazing. Simone's sandwich took a few more minutes to prepare as hers was toasted in the Panini Press. While they cooked her sandwich we found a seat with a street view and sat back and watched the sandwich magic continue. These guys operate behind the counter like a fine oiled machine and its entertaining to see. My sandwich was great, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Swiss, Slaw and Tangy Russian Dressing. Sam's Corned Beef and Pastrami is described as Rumainian...whatever region of the earth it is from does not matter...im just going to call it friggin good.  The Slaw is also good , although not as creamy as I like and a little heavy in celery seed. The bread is made fresh daily and you can taste it. The Rye was excellent and laced with plenty of seed's. The sandwich was huge but It was so good I couldn't help but finish it.  Simone's sandwich was also very good. Like almost everything at Sam's, the Pesto is nothing short of perfection, especially if you are a garlic lover as it is pretty heavy in it. The sandwich was stacked high with Monteray Jack Cheese and Portabellos which also had a good amount of Garlic in them.  This may not be the best sandwich choice for a first date, but after 5 years of marriage my loving wife was not concerned with the abundance of Garlic. On a side note, after you have eaten at Sam's, take the long walk up two flights of stairs to get to the restrooms. Do this up and down a few times, and you will have worked off enough calories for maybe another sandwich !  Overall we ate a great meal and had a great experience at Sam LaGrassas. Although it has had its share amount of fame, it still holds true to its neighborhood deli feel and it is truly a great sandwich. 4 stars."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This is hands-down punch-me-in-the-face the best oysters I've ever had.

Unfortunately, Commonwealth is not comparable in scale or ambition to Bee's Knees which in my mind is the epitome of an urban high-end market. Some elements of the market are a win, like the refrigerator cases filled with home made ice cream, fresh dairy, and seasonal vegetables. But other attempts in the market fail, like the antique cast-iron stove filled with outrageously overpriced jars of Helmann's Mayo ($4 for 8 ounces) and bottles of Heinz Ketchup. Although you can grab a baguette and some house made jam, there is no delicatessen, butcher, or cheese monger available.\\n\\nDinner (3 stars)\\nCommonwealth is a farm-to-table concept, which is all good and well, but the menu errs on the side of oversimplified. The best starter may be the home made Omni-Parker House style rolls served warm with good butter. The scallop ceviche satisfies but the meager portion hits low on value. The bowl of mussels is a better option for a seafood starter that satisfies. Main courses are split into a la carte proteins and sides. The meat and fish options are all in the $20-30 range. All sides are $10, resulting in an easy $30-40 per diner, just for the mains. Again, not a great value, but forgivable. Of the main dishes sampled, all were cooked and seasoned properly. The downfall of dinner is the largely uninventive menu. Everything being a la carte, there are no composed dishes. Items listed on the menu are exactly that, no herbs, spices, or accoutrement. I prefer to dine out for items and preparations I can not achieve simply at home, and Commonwealth does not meet that bar. \\n\\nLunch (4 stars)\\nKendall Square has no shortage of lunch spots, but Commonwealth is a fantastic new option. There are typically 5 sandwiches and salads available for take-out or dining in. Of three take out attempts the sandwich portion varied, it may be that the kitchen is still dialing in the right size sandwich for the $9 price point. Sit-down lunch offers the same menu of sandwiches and salads for $12. Sandwiches are served with sides of both duck fat fries and salad greens. The 'steak and cheese' sandwich is simple but tasty, with deep beefy short rib flavor. The pork belly bahn mi is full of bright acidic veggies, but the pork belly varies between soft and juicy and dry and mealy. The roast beef has a welcome kick of horseradish mayo, but is otherwise just an average sandwich. Overall, Commonwealth is an affordable and enjoyable option for a work-day lunch.\\n\\nService (5 stars)\\nMarket aside, the service at Commonwealth is fantastic. The bartenders are knowledgeable and talented. Though on my night visit they were behind with mise en place and took a bit too long to prepare cocktails. Servers and runners were courteous and efficient. The team was helpful but not overly chatty, interactions were pleasantly terse. The Market staff seems to vary from jumpy to unaware. A greeter near the door is quick to chase you down and explain the footpath to follow for market, take-out, or sit-down, even if you happen to know where you are going. A couple of team members behind the market counter are standing around at lunch time, unsure of their role. Generally, though, the team is happy and accommodating."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Nothing could prevent me from enjoying some of the finest Thai cuisine, not even the cold glare from my boyfriend sitting across from me.

We went during the early afternoon so they didn't have a full house yet either, but it's still nice to be able to walk in a group and be accommodated for.\\n\\nI do think it is confused about what it's trying to sell though as it's Thai food is far better than its pho. I went in on a cold winter day for some soothing soup and found it to be only okay. All your classic meats are in there so that's a plus, but the soup base was salty with not a lot of dimension as classic of a good bowl of pho. It did hit the spot though so I can't say the food was terrible, it just wasn't fantastic!\\n\\nI had some friends who ordered Thai dishes like the Pad Thai and found that to be much better in comparison to the pho. If you're craving pho, there's other options in the area that can give you equally similar pho taste and perhaps at a better price point. My bowl of pho ran around $10 after everything said and done. \\n\\nHowever, if you're looking for some easy Thai food, this is a pretty good choice I think. The menu has a variety of things to choose from so if it's just convenience you're looking for, this is still a viable option.

Marriot seems to do a better job keeping up their side of the grounds, if it's all the same grounds keepers they overlook trash, debris and needed upkeep in many areas around the Ritz. \\n \\nWhile I, and many others, staying here this week have valid complaints, I would not hesitate to return, there is just that much to offer. That said, I have not ever been to a resort that had so many complaints openly talked about between guests, in such a short time frame and with all being fairly well acquainted with Marriot and resorts, these complaints should not be taken lightly, changes should be made. \\n\\n My party was, as were others, given mixed, incorrect information about costs, times and availability or access to for much of the amenities. \\nExamples-\\n* I was told there are saunas and private whirlpools...I was not told they come at a charge is $50/day! And that type of deception is rampant here.\\n* \\"Our pools all open at 7 am\\"(they open at 8), \\"we have free kayaks for guests\\"(they are $30/half hour!), \\n*\\"We have an amazing eco kayaking tour\\"(Young kid had no idea what to tell us about ecology of the area and was actually just 'filling in')\\nSo did they call to tell us they don't have a guide? NO. \\nDo not take our money for some lame ECO tour that we could have just paddled on our own. Shame on them at the \\"Our eco tour is $40(concierge)\\" to being charged $60. I will attempt to have those charges reversed. (I will let you know)\\n*Upcharge for a pedicure \\"It will include a  long honey massage\\"(I got my feet painted with honey and wrapped in hot towels with no massage at all! I would like a rebate on that too!) \\n*Some of the other guests mentioned feeling nickle-dime to death, the expenses on site for food etc... (the prices on resort are outrageous- with just a few dollars in reduction they might do a bigger volume. I heard so many people say they would not eat on site, 'wait' til we go to ____, or even debate sharing one sandwich(not a bad idea for most of us but still $8.50 or more for a half sandwich) Lowering food charges, especially out in the pool areas, would certainly benefit those hungry staff workers, that have little to do if the blue flags are not being raised on the back of the chairs. \\n* Being disrespected by staff- another guest told me she was reprimanded for ordering her sandwich from Bodegas and then going to Starbuck to order her coffee. Yes, reprimanded. I know it's true because I was told these same words \\"It only takes 60 seconds for us to make your sandwich\\" She was told \\"next time' order your coffee first! Rudely. \\nI was overlooked for 5 minutes at the lobby bar, two other men walking ni and sitting down on either side of the bar were served first, and then when the bartender did approach me, she asked me my room number aloud, she did not ask the other two men... I told her I would not give out my room number aloud! \\nAt the lazy river pool, younger staff members can be rude nearing closing time. There are ways to say, we are closing soon, with making it sound like \\"get out now\\". \\nOver all the staff needs to be taught some manner to approach each and every guest to make them feel good to be at the resort. \\n\\nIn addition to all that, I did try to make arrangements for local attractions, something nature filled with one of the concierge, I made my own reservation for an eco kayaking tour and requested more outdoors activities. I was sent indoor skydiving as a suggestion and other -\\"CAN DO EVERYWHERE\\" activities. By pass the concierges that don't listen and research yourself. I recommend close by manatee viewing and interaction walks in Tarpon Springs. \\n\\n Our grouper at The Kitchen on site was really good, ham hock- too salty, so on the side for that. (Best waitstaff is at The Kitchen- hands down)  My chicken was perfect, the sauce, mixed on that. \\nThe restaurants on site are all okay, some not so okay- I did not try Harrys though.

First generation Asian American children are all too familiar with this phenomenon.  :/\\n\\nNori Nori, which loosely translates to \\"seaweed\\" in Japanese, is a no-frills sushi/seafood buffet located in Sandy Springs.  Once you walk beyond Nori Nori's fish tank, the adornments are minimal, with just enough to let you know that you're in a Japanese restaurant.  You'll hear Japanese pop music while sitting in the dimly lit dining area, and you'll see kitchen personnel rolling sushi in the brightly lit, open air portion of Nori Nori's kitchen.  This stark contrast of lighting means that, like a moth to a street lamp, you'll be subconsciously attracted to the buffet time and time again.\\n\\nOver a dozen types of sushi are available, as well as soups, skewered steak, shrimp, crab cakes, at least 10 different salads, fried squid, fried rice, yakisoba noodles, tofu, fish, desserts, and more.  Every item is labeled, so even if you can't visibly discern a \\"California roll\\" from a \\"Sandy Springs roll,\\" you'll be spared from having to play a guessing game with your taste buds.  And be sure to conclude your meal with their green tea ice cream.\\n\\nLunch is from noon to 2:00 P. M., and dinner is from 6:00 P. M. to close.  If you go for lunch as I did, know that Nori Nori will stop replenishing food at 2:00 P. M. but will allow you to continue to pile food onto your plates for an additional 30 minutes.  Linger until 2:45 P. M., and you'll witness their entire staff devour the remaining buffet offerings.  The benefit to discrete lunch and dinner services at Nori Nori means that even if you leave at 2:45 P. M., you'll still pay the lunch rate of $17.50, as opposed to being upcharged to the dinner price, which is in the range of $25 to $29.  That said, there are a few items that are offered exclusively during dinner hours.\\n\\nThe Travel Channel led me to believe that only licensed chefs are allowed to prepare sushi in The Land of the Rising Sun.  Notwithstanding, you're likely to hear the Nori Nori kitchen personnel speaking Spanish rather than Japanese.  So although Nori Nori is not the most \\"authentic\\" sushi restaurant in the Atlanta area, it is markedly better than a typical Asian buffet.  And no, the irony of a sushi/seafood buffet in the same shopping plaza as L. A. Fitness is not lost on me.  Gorge like a sumo wrestler!

That's fine, I just want to eat dinner.  The waitress (who we later find out is the manager, I'll get back to this) takes our order and then my raw food comes up pretty quickly.  \\n\\nStriped bass ceviche:  Is it possible to overcook ceviche?

It's a wimpy deep fried oyster with a brioche that is too dense and dry to be any good.  It detracts from the flavor of the oyster.  \\n\\nAs for my friends, his appetizer of mussels came out with his entree.  So he deferred his fish entree until he finished his appetizer.  An hour later he gets his main course when the rest of us are done eating.  \\n\\nWe wait another hour, its after midnight now.  There has been no one at our table since the hour before when my friend got his lukewarm fish entree.  \\n\\nWe later flag down another waitress who tells us that the person who took our order initially was a manager and found out we were never actually assigned to any particular waiter.  Excellent.  Exhausted we pass on dessert.  \\n\\nOverall, I liked the oysters and the awesome 90s music.

The manager came over to talk about the gluten free menu to let us know that they were very careful about making sure there would be no issues for us.\\n\\nI ordered the chicken roulade, chicken breast wrapped around veggies and manchego cheese, over lobster risotto. It was absolutely delicious. The only thing I noticed was that the lobster was overcooked, but otherwise it was absolutely fantastic. I was comfortable halfway through the dish and should've taken the rest home, but I couldn't help myself and finished it off. \\n\\nOne friend had a burger on a gluten free bun, which they did not warm up first, so it fell apart. They did however warm the buns when they served them to us as dinner rolls. They should definitely warm them before they serve them on a sandwich. My other friend ordered a salad. I didn't notice if it was good or not because I just don't eat salad for dinner. That's probably why she's a size two and I'm not! Anyway, definitely check out Burton's.

Today was such an experience. Let's lay out the facts first. The 30 day rating details, which is really only used in hindsight, reveal something startling--it drops to an average of rating of 3. That's a sudden drop in the trend. \\n\\nSo, let's attempt to capture the experience. It's a classic hole-in-the-wall, teal framed Italian diner. People line up in anticipation of a gustatory orgasm, if you will. Expectations rise with every opening of the door, as the aroma of garlic in olive oil waft out into the streets. It's cold, but you tell yourself it's worth it. This synthetic rationalization knows not what's coming. \\n\\nYou order the much talked about squid-ink pasta in the most classic form of any pasta, simple olive oil. A true test of ingredients and technique. When the waiter brings the plate to the table, you're confused at an unpleasant visual--but hey, the tongue and the stomach know best.\\n\\nYou twirl it fashionably and sink to what's hard to explain. To say it's salty would be understatement and an insult to salts. It's mostly a two-dimension flavor of sodium that manifested itself into noodles. The other dimension is mind-blowing. You can taste the freezer's history through the specks of calamari that play with the minced garlic. Most seafood restaurants go for the taste of the ocean, but this one is not \\"traditional.\\" It takes pride in it's freezer, but I don't. But the synthetic rationalization pushes you to finish at least half the plate, but you can only pretend for so long. \\n\\nSo, you wait to make eye contact with the waiter, hoping something could be done about it. He never stops at your table. He walks by but never comes by. You pause and think how this experience could devolve any further, and it's through service. Surely, he would find it strange that people haven't finished their food. Surely, something's amiss. But know, he avoids you at all cost. When you leave away from the food, he collects and walks away.\\n\\nIt is not a shock after the sodium pasta. It'd hard to beat. You feel a need to tell him something's wrong. So, as you leave you point that that \\"we had a hard time eating.\\" He's quick and curt to display what hes rehearsed in his defense, \\"It's too late now. It's done. You finished eating.\\" What's this? You can fix the food and quality with effort, and maybe the chef's have an off day. But this.. this is something you can't fix.

What makes me the most upset is that restaurants are jumping on the gluten free bandwagon because it is trendy, without knowing enough about celiac disease to prevent people like me from getting sick. I told the waiter that I was extremely sensitive and that one crumb of wheat could make me sick. He said nothing to dissuade me from eating there.

On the same block as the Kenmore T station, ISOB. Owner and operator Skip Bennett opened Island Creek Oysters in Duxbury, which now provide the restaurant, along with many other Boston restaurants, with extremely locally sourced farm-to-table bivalves. With a 25-seat bar and plenty of dining space, the modern decor mixes well with the remnants of fallen oyster shells that are caged to the walls.    \\n\\nOpening at 4 for the raw bar & drinks, dinner does not start until promptly at 5pm. We headed to the bar for an amazing cocktail.  Although a lengthy list, we both decided on the \\"Death in the afternoon\\", a mix of champagne & absinthe (two of my favorite drinks!) with a twinge of lemon zest.\\n\\nAt this point I was pumped, an amazing cocktail, a hopping bar scene, what else do you need? Unfortunately the meal went downhill after the cocktail. We headed past the large raw bar to the dining room.\\n\\nWe took our seats and were given our just-printed-fresh menus. With an informative raw menu providing a variety of locally-sourced oysters and shellfish (but no crab), I could see how this place is so popular. Not the biggest fan of raw anything, I passed on the raw bar (which may be why the meal went downhill) and went straight to the fried clams.\\n\\nI usually love all fried clams, or anything fried really, but in each bite I had bits of sand, so I was sadly disappointed. My date had an oyster slider which she reported was tastier than the clams.\\n\\nFor dinner I went with the lobster roll, having heard this roll was the best in Boston (even better than my warm favorite at Neptune Oyster) I had to try it. A nice toasted bun hugged the lobster meat which was well prepared, but the killer of the whole dish was the overpowering raw red onion bits. Each bite tasted a bit like lobster, a bit like mayo, and a bunch like onion.

That, I think, is the biggest reason that I can't give a full 5 stars. I ended up picking something without fully studying the menu because there was just SO much!\\n\\nI ended up with the Bun Tom, the shrimp with vermicelli noodles with nuoc chom sauce, and a fresh roll. The shrimp was just amazing - so incredibly flavorful. But I had to peel it myself, which I don't love. I added some of the homemade chili paste, which was AMAZING. It smelled and tasted like maybe they roasted the dried chili first - better than I've had in many other restaurants.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Bun Tom Thit Cha Gio, the shrimp, pork, and crispy roll with vermicelli noodles with nuoc chom. She said the pork was a great flavor but there was too much fat; she compared it to unrendered bacon. She was a little disappointed in the dish as a whole, but neither of us were 100% sure what this dish consisted of when we ordered it, so we can't blame that on the restaurant. She said she didn't expect it to be so \\"salad-like,\\" in that it was a cold, mostly un-cooked dish. \\n\\nAll the dishes (both that came to our table and the ones we saw other patrons getting) were presented beautifully. Our water was refilled regularly and timely, and food arrived quickly. \\n\\nOther than the large menu, my biggest issue was that we were given the bill while my friend was still eating. That in and of itself is a little rude, in my opinion, but the fact that they came back to get the bill less than two minutes later, while she was STILL eating, really irked me. I understand that this is a small restaurant with maybe 30 seats, and there were people waiting. I don't mind not sitting and chatting after we're done eating so that someone else can have the table.

Definitely get it WITH cheese, as it's all gooey, melty goodness with enough butter and garlic to ward off any vampires you encounter later in the evening. The side of steamed broccoli was nothing special, but necessary in what was otherwise a rather carb and protein heavy meal.

Here's the good things about the hotel:  check in was quick , friendly and efficient . The hotel lobby and common areas are really beautiful. The grounds are well maintained, the pool is awesome and The room was clean and comfortable. Also , the concierge was helpful when a confusing and unfortunate incident regarding the shuttle happened. We expressed our frustration and the lady made sure to remedy the issue right away. We appreciated that!   However, here is what ultimately left a bad taste in our mouths. 1. A lot of hotel employees did not seem to know much about the hotel or how anything worked. It was not helpful. 2. The cab service that the hotel contracts are a bunch of crooks who charge rates all over the place for the same trips. You never know what to expect even when asking ahead of time. When we notified the staff, there was no real response . I think they know this and just don't care. That is a very infuriating all in itself . 3.  We got turn down service once out of five nights and had to repeatedly call housekeeping because if not, they would have only cleaned our room twice .

I haven't been knocked off my stool with anything I've ever eaten, but if we're going to eat at a bar this one's not so bad of a choice.

The atmosphere is great, lots of young professionals that generally work or live in the area. Overall, I'd say this is a good spot if you're in the mood to grab a few after work or just hang.

Last night was no different, and that's ok. We started out with the tuna tartar, mixta plate, and p√¢t√©. We also ordered Brazilian Caipirinhas to drink. The drinks were very good, and the tuna tartar made it out first. This was good, and the salad garnish added a little flavor to the lightly seasoned tuna. Next out was the chorizo y pimento. This is where it started to go wrong. You could tell that the chorizo had cooked in the sauce all day, and the sausage was mushy and over cooked. Also, for chorizo, it was especially bland, a trend that continued through the meal. Out next, p√¢t√© and the mixta plate. The p√¢t√© was bland, and grainy. The hams on the mixta plate were good, but the cheeses lacked any flavor, short of the blue cheese, but that was saved for the beef tenderloin slices. The remaining plates, the tenderloin slices (substituted for oxtails) and grilled shrimp both suffered the same problem, lack of flavor.\\n\\nIn short, a very unremarkable dinner.

I like it when waitresses understand business and get me what I need. 45 minutes in and out, it's a win-win situation.\\n\\nOn the downside, as the hostess showed us to our table, I had to move it away from the soft chairs against the wall as it looked like the area was still being cleaned up. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the table tops (a very nice Spanish tile on concrete) are not secured to the frame and I ended up jamming my finger between 100lbs of concrete and steel.

The menu is ok. The miso soup was passable, the salad that came with the omakase was too sweet and the octopus salad was also a bit too salty and briny. The actual sushi (we got the omakase) was pretty decent but nothing that I haven't experienced at an average sushi place in Boston or its surroundings.

I ordered their fish sauce chili wings for which they are known for and got myself a mango cocktail. I'm extra judgey on their wings because I myself am Vietnamese American and I've tasted a fair amount of fish sauce wings.\\n\\nMy first impression of the wings was that it was not too spicy which was fine with me, the server said it would be less than Siracha level spicy. The wings weren't as crispy as I would have liked, more on the soft side which is ok too, some people like that. However the deal breaker for me was the taste of the wings - it was too salty. Fish sauce is hard to cook with and if not balanced correctly, it can overwhelming be incredibly salty which it was. What's also weird would I get some chili bites in between so the sauce didn't seem evenly distributed. I finished the water pitcher they gave me by myself and downed my alcohol drinks. The only reason why this review gets an extra star is that the bartender who helped me was very attentive, making sure I had a pleasant dining experience, and made sure I enjoyed the drinks he made. Despite quality service, I was so disappointed in the wings and am shocked it is their best and most popular item on the menu.

This occasion was a family birthday and we had 8 adults and 3 children in our party (ages 11, 7, and 3). Here are my impressions:\\n\\n1. When you first walk in, the kids are measured to determine how much they'd be charged. Our 7 year old measured right at 4 feet. If we took his shoes off, he'd probably be a bit below. However, the manager insisted on charging him 1/2 adult price (vs. 1/5 price, $10 difference). This is after we tried to explain that we have 8 adults and one older child and they are already getting $30x8+$15 at minimum from us and maybe should not nickel and dime us. Plus, our child (as any child his age) barely eats so he will definitely never eat $15 worth of food. Maybe $6 worth max.  (which is the 1/5th of adult price and fair). The manager seemed young and inexperienced and stood his ground like his life depended on it. This is definitely not the way to start off your clients' dining experience on the right foot.\\n2. We made reservations in advance since it was a large party. When we got there (right on time), the table was not ready yet. After 10 min. wait we were led to the table closest to the kitchen, right in view of clanging dishes and all the usual unappetizing sights/smells. We politely asked to be moved. We were moved to the table right by the entrance which had zero ambiance and cold AC blasting right at us. \\n3. The buffet left much to be desired. The freshness of fish was average (nothing to rave about). Many types of sushi were not replenished. The signs to mark the sushi were confusing because the signs are side by side while the menu items are arranged one behind another on the buffet. It was confusing which item you were getting as many types of sushi look similar on the outside but can be very different on the inside.\\n4. There is only one cook making to order hibachi style dishes and he's very busy. Kids typically only eat hibachi in this restaurant so it took forever to get their food made and resulted in very cranky children.\\n5. The restaurant had a distinct smell to it (maybe fishy?). The bathrooms also didn't smell good and seemed unclean. \\n\\nAll in all, a very poor experience for the amount spent.

The egg drop soup is really good, I was almost tempted  to cancel everything else and order a really big bowl. It was really really good. The garlic chicken was good and seasoned very well. When I order GARLIC chicken the star of the show should be garlic. This was on the light side of garlic and the pepper was a close second. A really good balance.

Every experience I've had with Ceviche has proven that to be true of this establishment. I've been there three times, always with friends who sing its praises, and every time I've been disappointed. \\n\\nThe first two times I went to Ceviche I was a vegetarian and every overpriced little tapas plate was very underwhelming. When my friends suggested going to Ceviche for dinner last night I told them I wasn't a fan, but didn't have a better idea so I'd give it another try as a non-veg. They assured me that I'd be more pleased with the meat dishes than I ever was with the veggie dishes.\\n\\nWrong.\\n\\nFirst, we got there around 9 pm and were told it would be 20 minutes for a table. It was about 45 minutes. We were actually just about to leave when our buzzer went off. Once we were seated it took about 10 minutes before the waiter came to take our drink orders. We ordered drinks and I asked the waiter if he could also bring us some bread (we were starving after our 45 minute wait.) He told me that they had a new rule that they couldn't bring bread until the table ordered hot food. Come on. It's bread. I've never heard of a rule like that--have you?\\n\\nUpon looking at the menu I realized that anything that looked appetizing was $12-$15 for a tapas-sized plate and upwards of $18 for what I guess is the regular size. Since my biggest gripe with Ceviche (and other tapas-style restaurants) is that you have to spend at least $30 to fill up and even then you feel like you need to swing by Chik-fi-a on the way home because there's just not enough food on any given plate, I tried to choose very carefully to not bankrupt myself on food I might not be thrilled with. I ended up getting an appetizer that consisted of three small crostinis topped with anchovies, tomatoes and onions, and a mixed-sausage type of thing. The anchovy crostini were flavorless and the sausage thing came in some canned tomato sauce with heavy spices. I picked the sausages out and ate them, but there were only 4 small pieces. I left the tomato sauce because it had a heavy perfumey taste to it. Those two things--three pieces of bread with canned anchovies and tomato sauce with four pieces of sausage--was $16. \\n\\nThe best part of the meal was the bread we got when we ordered our hot food and the pesto-ish sauce that came with it. There were three of us and we killed the bread pretty quickly and asked for more. The waiter brought us more, then leaned down to tell us that they had a new rule that they were supposed to charge for extra loaves of bread, but that he wouldn't charge us this time. What's this bread made out of? They act like its a precious metal. My friend's stuffed calamari was cold, so she didn't eat it. The whole meal was just laced with disappointment. When we left one of my dining companions said she was now on board with my Ceviche-hate and understood why I didn't want to go, even though she had been pleased with previous experiences.\\n\\nCeviche is just one of those places that I think people feel like they should like because it's pricey and dark and a little more upscale than other places in the area, but the truth is it's a bomb.

The inside is dim, warmly lit and pretty chatty. I'd suggest getting there \\"early\\" or on an off night so that you're guaranteed more space. \\n\\nThe service was relatively fast for our party of 5, and our waitress was pleasant and checked up on us often.

When we walked into this establishment, we were greeted by the hostess who was nice.  We informed her that we would like to sit outside on the patio.  That was the last good thing that happened at the Ivy.  After about 25 min of waiting for our server to take our drink order, she arrived.  I ordered a bloody mary, she asked me if well vodka was alright? I answered yes.  Then she disappeared back into the restaurant for about another 20 -25 min or so before returning to our table with our drinks and to take our food order.  Me and my two friends all ordered club sandwiches, and when they finally arrived my bacon wasn't fully cooked.  Not a problem for me, I just took it off.  However, when we asked for some mayo and ranch dressing from our server, she went back inside and practiced her disappearing act again.  We finished all that was edible on our club sandwiches and asked for the checks.  She returned with the checks and we paid and left.  We weren't too thrilled with the experience and decided to not come back just based on the service alone.  Now, when I got home I discovered that my card had been charged twice.  A charge of 20 dollars, for my meal and bloody mary.  Then a charge of 13 dollars, for what reason I have no idea? I have attempted to call the Ivy twice regarding this matter of the second charge, and they have not answered or returned my phone call.  I am highly dissatisfied with this location not simply because of the mediocre food, but because of the horrific service that we received.

I paid my bill and my tip but the evening ended up horrible. People should be able to go into a decent restaurant and pay for it and sit down and relax at a sushi bar without hearing nonsense 5th grader commentary.  While the waiter tried to cover it up, it was only made worse by the fact that the customer had said \\"must have hit close to home\\" to me as he was leaving.

Which is pretty fine by me, as it was peak lunch hours on a weekend.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is very nice looking, a common observation among my friends was that it looked like a place that would cost a lot more than it did. One of them looked over at me and was like 'when we first walked in, I got really worried I wouldn't be able to afford anything', then went on to say that they were actually surprised at how affordable everything was. For about $10 they got a bowl of ramen and an appetizer, though they could have skipped the app and gone even cheaper (though they wouldn't have wanted to, as they said that the bao was delicious anyway).\\n\\nA number of people ordered an appetizer for the table to share. Overall we tried the bao, the karaage, the edamame, the potato croquettes, and the takoyaki. Everything was really well done! I particularly liked the karaage. As opposed to other places I've had it at, the meat was nice and moist (the spicy mayo they served it with was a good addition as well).\\n\\nIt was my birthday celebration, so I went extravagant and ordered the garlic tonkatsu ramen. It was pretty good and definitely garlic-y. Everyone was pretty happy with their ramen, though one of my friends realized he made a mistake when he added in additional sauce at the table. Several people actually couldn't finish their dish, but thankfully they had to-go cups available (...unlike a few ramen places in Portland).\\n\\nOther things to note. They offered everyone free tea (either oolong or green), which is a really nice detail. After we were mostly finished eating, what I suspect was the manager came over and asked us about our meal and ensured that everything was good. Everyone was sort of awed by the customer service in general. Overall, the price was the same (and even cheaper in a lot of cases) than all the other ramen places in the area. However, the restaurant itself, the versatility of the menu, and the customer service all make it seem like a much more expensive place. \\n\\nFor the price of an 'average' lunch, we had an excellent experience that I can't argue with at all.

I understand the desire to keep your electric bill down and to do your part for the environment and all that, but it's 100 degrees outside at 7:00 in the evening, and it couldn't have been any less than 85 degrees inside CC. I keep my house at 80 during the day and Counter Culture was definitely warmer than that. There is at least a good fan going to give you a nice breeze, though.\\n\\nIn the same vein, I was a little put off by the warm glass of water that was given to us after we were seated... once again, very noble to abstain from huge amounts of ice. The reasoning makes sense to me, I assure you. And yet, I feel you should pick one or the other... either warm indoor temps but ice water to cool you off, or crank up the A/C a bit and stick with the room-temperature water. Perhaps these are big draws for the hardcore eco-conscious among us. It just made for a somewhat uncomfortable dinner.\\n\\nI hate to sound so negative about this place. It's just not for me. The decor seemed to be going for retro, but the fake wood paneling just looked old. A coat of white paint and a new floor could do so much to cheer this place up. And the jukebox was less nostalgic and more unsettling... my boyfriend described it as 'Music you hear on the radio in the house of a serial killer that is murdering his latest victim'.\\n\\nThe food was good, but unremarkable. I had sweet potatoes and greens on a bed of quinoa. I think it's impossible to roast sweet potatoes without them being tasty (bless you sweet potatoes, you delicious orange nuggets!). I think a sauce of some kind could have helped it out as the beans were a tad dry.\\n\\nI would probably give this place 2 and 3/4 stars, but 3 will suffice - after all, it is 100% vegan, and I do recommend it if you are in the area.

The ambiance is very European, romantic, and elegant, with luxurious plush seats and dim lighting. Perfect for a classier dinner / special occasion. This is actually my third time here - a review of what I've tried: \\n\\nApps: \\n1) Seared Foie Gras (torchon) - Came in pate form and served with an elevated toasted bread/brioche with dark chocolate (with ganache filling) on top - very innovative! The perfect amount for two to share. \\n2) Grilled Spanish Octopus - Also good, and beautiful presentation. Wouldn't say it's the best octopus I've had but enjoyed the grilled flavor & texture.\\n\\nEntrees: (in order of how much I'd recommend it)\\n1) Lamb neck - Wow. Seriously good, and probably a seasonal special? Get it if you like lamb, rich sauces, and bold flavors. The meat is actually falling-off-the-bone tender.\\n2) Seared duck breast - Seems like a popular dish, and for a good reason; the duck is perfectly cooked, beautifully presented, and complemented by the fruit.\\n3) Grilled pork chop - Tender / not dry at all, although could use some more flavor in the middle; but overall a very well-made rustic dish.\\n4) Wild Boar Ragout - A great option if you're in the mood for pasta, just beware that the portion was REALLY small. Nevertheless, very rich and flavorful.\\n\\nDessert: Souffle!! Get the chocolate one - tastes like molten dark chocolate, and the texture is very light and fluffy."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"OK the wings are great.

Usually I don't have to do this in Portland, but alas at Pok Pok I did.\\n\\nEven more disappointing than the lack of options was that one of dishes was pretty horrible. My boyfriend and I shared two dishes- mushrooms with greens and eggplant salad (with fish sauce, hence the pescetarian). Mushrooms and greens was about what you'd expect- nothing special, but they were high quality. The eggplant salad though, was incredibly disappointing. In fact, between me and my boyfriend (who we're splitting the two dishes) we couldn't even finish half of it. Something about fish sauce, boiled eggs and lime... all in one sauce... does not sit well with me. In fact, we both felt sick for 24 hours after eating it.

I never write 5 star reviews. Bistro du Midi deserves 5 stars. This is one place that will go down in my memory banks of amazing restaurant experiences. \\n\\nWe started at the downstairs bar where Geoffrey served us a pre-dinner glass of wine. It was early and slow so we started chatting about wine and he was gracious enough to pour us a taste of two amazing bourbons and two gins. It wasn't the tastes that were amazing - it was the service. \\n\\nThe hostess was wonderful. She made sure we were seated promptly after asking for our table (for which we had made reservations but then detoured to the bar) and was gracious while I checked my coat. She directed us to a second hostess (who really needs to eat a sandwich and wear flats) upstairs. \\n\\nThe upstairs dining room is incredibly tastefully decorated. Sunny, great view, comfortable and elegant. As the sun set the view changed into twinkling lights. Lovely. Understand New England elegance at its finest tempered with studied Provencal inspired French cuisine. \\n\\nOur server was Eric, who was the only dim spot in the evening. And it's not that he was bad mind you, it's just that everyone else was amazing. Eric was helpful and kind - he just didn't have the same fine dining finesse as everyone else. He was a little less knowledgeable and a little more familiar than the evening warranted. He could recite the menu, but he didn't know the menu - n'est pas? \\n\\nThe pork terrine was amazing. The foie gras was sinful. The sea bass was probably Chilean - meh. But the fennel it was served with - oh my god the fennel. Cooked sous vide and then seared. The sky opened and harps played as angels wept. That fennel was smack your mama good. It was smack yo' gran'mama good. The cod needed a wee bit more seasoning and I was ever so slightly disappointed that the chorizo wasn't more in the foreground. Also - the chickpeas could have been lightly mashed so they don't roll on the plate. \\n\\nBut dessert - order dessert. Order the souffle. Order the Grand Marnier souffle. Angels, choir, harps, yes, yes. (A previous poster mentioned the server asking about dessert too early - however - if a souffle is being made fresh it needs at least 20 minutes. The ticket is going to go in after your entree is served. The server needs to ask early if souffle is one of the specialties - which it is at Bistro du Midi. I ordered mine with my appetizer). \\n\\nThe brightest spot in the evening - the sommelier, or self-proclaimed \\"wine geek\\" Kelly. I heart Kelly. I will always ask Kelly's opinion when I go to BdM. His pairings were spot on. We savored every moment, every sip, every sniff, every swirl. \\n\\nBottom line - great food, great service, great atmosphere - without feeling stuffy or pretentious.

Lasagna had heavy layers of rich veal and cheese with a garlicky marinara. Eggplant was deep fried to perfection, a side of homemade spaghetti with the marinara and a healthy layer of cheese.

It is a cross between Torchy's and Freebirds.  I thought the prices were a bit high. $13.99 for a whole rotisserie chicken is a bit much. You can get 2 Flaming Birds with 2 sides and corn tortillas for $17. I do like the fact that they had grab and go breakfast tacos. They were also a bit high at over $2 per taco. I had a friend who used to own a taco place who told me at one time that breakfast tacos were very inexpensive to make. I am not sure what is with the high mark up. I can see paying over $2 for a taco if it was a little larger than what they offered. I did like the fact they had made their tortillas fresh. I an opted for a burrito. I wanted to get a side but it would pretty much add $4+ dollars to your lunch meal. If I am going spend almost $15+ dollars for lunch, I would rather do it at a sit down place.\\n\\nThe service was excellent. I would have thought the guy at the register would have made some lunch suggestions other than, \\"Our burritos are huge,\\" They are huge. You could easily make a burrito into two meals.

Even if the change is only a couple dollars, protocol is to bring it back to the table and NEVER assume that the change is your tip. Again, thats something that i never did as a server. That is also very rude and would not fly at almost any other restaurant. \\n\\nBottom line, these people do not care if you enjoy your meal.

Damn- that was good!!! If my son didn't have 3/4 gone before I snagged a piece, not sure I would have had a bite but tasty, thick and addictive... It was gone in a minute. \\n\\nFinally table called a bit late - but we were ready and had already studied what we wanted before we arrived \\n\\n1. Started with apps- the Lobster Fritters and Bone marrow. The Fritters we're 4 bites of pure lobster heaven. So we ordered another one as there are only 4 bites, and closed our eyes and each got a whole app. \\n\\n2. The Bone Marrow was something my son had not tried and it was fantastic!! 2 large bones, crisp bread, and cranberry compliment to mix. Scoop out the marrow, spread on cracker, add a bite of cranberry, wow. We both loved it, loved the presentation and dug right through it. \\n\\n3. Anticipating our entree- we then ordered Foie Gras so it would arrive with the entrees. Stole a small bite but wanted to share with the entrees. \\n\\n4. For Entrees- we did a Bone in Filet -MR- a 16 OZ NY Strip and for sides the cooked spinach and the best- the cream jalape√±o corn. \\n\\n5. The Filet was perfect. Actually, the first bone in filet I've ever had- and I have had a lot of Filets- cooked perfect, juicy, loved pulling the bits off the bone. Put a slice of foie gras, and the black truffle butter- OMG... perfect. To compliment both meals- we ordered a whole steamed lobster tail so paired that as well with the corn, spinach, foie gras, spinach and a good merlot- it can't get any better, \\n\\n6. The NY Strip was perfectly cooked and paired as well just as I did my Filet. Perfectly cooked R/MR, tender, tasty- mixed with all the goodies- it was a LOT of food. \\n\\nService from Eric was spot on, great recommendations and made sure we were happy all night!  \\n\\n7. Still not done. Although I had now had a beer, some wine, a Whisky ( lots of water) - had to get a desert so we went for the Creme Br√ªl√©e . Thick coating of blazed on sugary crispy bark- the way I like it, and a wonderful vanilla creme inside. We dug in and were done. - We thought. \\n\\nAs I like to finish a meal with a cordial- I opted for a Hennesy VSOP, and with a large Cigar option- I chose a good Romeo /Julieta and headed to the outside patio to finish the evening. \\n\\nProbably one of the most relaxed evenings and only regrets was I was not on expense account- which I usually am for places like KR, so albeit buyers remorse in the $$$$ spent, worth it for my son who keeps reaching his goals and loves his experiences in some finer things in life and has earned every experience he has had.

As most people in who enjoy the type of meal, you'll find that the sides vary at almost every restaurant. In addition the main difference between the restaurants is whether they use charcoal or have good ventilation. \\n\\nFavorites about the restaurant - Kimchee, bean sprout and oil with salt and pepper sides. This mades it nice and easy to order unseasoned meat. There were several sides here that I didn't feel inclined to use, but no big deal. \\n\\nFood -quality of the meat was good. Charcoal grill, everything cooked fast. Nice ventilation. I did not smell like smoke when I left. However, there were only a couple people dinning in the restaurant at the time. \\n\\nService - really great.

(i got about 10 macarons) i think they do need a credit card to put on hold for the order, if i can remember properly. i gave them mine, but when i picked up my order that day, i paid in cash, so my card wasn't charged.\\n\\nthe day i went for pick up, i was happy with the accuracy of my order since i had about 5 different flavors. all of them tasted GREAT. i usually get my macarons at maison robert, but wanted to try his place because they had a violet flavored one i could try and are a little cheaper. the chocolate macaron has a fantastc rich filling, almost like a fudge. much better than maison robert's. the violet is a light flavor- i would recommend eating this flavor separate from the more distinct flavors, such as lemon, which will drown the violet flavor out.\\n\\nwill be back next birthday!"},{"name":"Counter Culture","address":"2337 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Had some great potato salad and mac and cheese.

She thought they were chewy. Now, I wouldn't have ordered the fried clams for dinner. It just doesn't seem like something one should get for the main course at a nice place, but she did anyway. I was mortally embarrassed when my brother decided to complain to the waitress as she was clearing our plates. Not only did I feel that if there was going to be a complaint, it should have been earlier when they first arrived, but it also seemed like we were trying to get them off the bill. I know some people subscribe to the notion that one should complain at dinner, but I personally like the yelp model a little better. I have no interest in drawing the waitress into our drama. I don't think my mom enjoyed the vibe here and that was affecting her impression of the food. \\n\\nMy husband and I loved it, however. I liked that the decor was fresh and fun, but that the service was not uptight. Yes, the food isn't cheap, but it is so impressively good that I didn't care in the least. We will definitely go back especially to feast on the oysters."},{"name":"Taste of Peru","address":"9521 S Orange Blossom Trl, Ste 117 A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"After eating this meal all I can say is, DELICIOUS!! Don't let the outside of this place fool you. We had a very lovely waitress. The place is small but open. The restaurant was very clean lots of videos of Peru on the flat screens. We ordered the Ceviche Mixto and the mussels (forgot name). The ceviche Mixto was ordered spicy and absolutely mouth watering. The cevich was filled with fresh calamari, tender white fish, shrimp, and mussels. For $17 you will never get this quality and portion of seafood perfection. The mussels were also delicious not ordered spicy. My meal (forgot name) was a spicy array of seafood in creamy spicy sauce on a bed of crispy rice and beans.  I'm so sad I will only be able to have this when I revisit next year! The rice was amazing and cooked to perfection. Again, the amount of seafood cannot be beat for $17 and probably never will.  The sauce is incredibly light but still has that creamy taste that you'd think you can only achieve by having a thick and heavy sauce. My boyfriend got the skirt steak with pesto spaghetti. I do not eat meat or chicken (occasionally sea food) but he said the meat was cooked and marinated deliciously. He really praised the cooking technique for his steak. The spaghetti was a light and flavorful pesto sauce. Exceptional quality and service and for $66 a completely steal. The only complaint is that this place does not have fountain drinks just in cans with of course no free refills. PLEASE STOP BY HERE.

The atmosphere is totally like a late night street restaurant in bali or thailand. It's really fun and there are a decent amount of seats. \\n\\nIt is pretty popular so expect to wait. We came around dinner and were estimated a 45-60 min wait but it was probably more like 30 so that was good. The host was nice enough and helpful. \\n\\nThe menu was a little huge but still manageable. There are a ton of sections that don't really entirely make sense but all the food has descriptions so that was great. The KAENG HANG LEH was absolutely amazing. It's the pork belly/shoulder curry. We ordered another order after we finished the first. The meat was so tender and the flavor was amazing. A MUST get if you come here. Also the wings they're famous for are also great. Smell a little odd but taste fantastic. We also got the baby back ribs and they were alright. The flavor was really just on the outside and the meat wasn't that tender. We got the sticky rice and some shrimp dish also but it was okay. \\n\\nThe waitress was nice but wasn't that good with checking on us or giving us water unless we asked. I guess the major kicker at this restaurant is the price. Like I said earlier the kaeng hang leh was great but it was so expensive.

It took a while to get our food because of the sheer volume of eat-in and carry-out orders, but I kind of enjoyed watching all the families that were there, and watching the kids at the pinball and Ms. Pac-Man games.\\n\\nThe pizza itself was just ok, nothing stand-out-ish about it.  They said they make their own sausage and meatballs; we ordered the combo pizza, so it had the sausage on it.  The sausage seemed strange--it was lighter in color than other sausages I've seen, and also it was pressed very thin.  The crust was thin, so it had a good crispiness to it.  It was hard to tell how much cheese was on the pizza; it may have been buried under the toppings, but it just didn't seem to be that cheesy.\\n\\nImportant things to know:\\n\\n- Cash only\\n- Carry out, but not delivery\\n- They don't do pizza boxes--just thin cardboard plates\\n\\nI suspect this place is highly rated simply for its nostalgic factor; it's located on Main St. in Bexley, close to the theater and is probably a neighborhood pizza joint that many families take their kids to because of its affordability and fun pinball and arcade games.

They have lots of box meals which have a main item, noodles, vegetables and soup all for under $10.  I got the curry chicken for $7.50 which includes tax.

A friend ordered something that looked like wontons but they were slightly crunchy.

One of my friends was surprised when he couldn't get hot tea.  They had a refrigerator full of canned and bottled beverages -- sodas and tea and stuff.

A lot of restaurant and bars get that part right but the experience isn't so great. Not here. This place is amazing. Often with new places I find they have \\"just opened\\" issues. Untrained staff etc. this place did not disappoint. My husband and I started downstairs where they serve food and have a smaller bar. The menu is so different from what is offered at a lot of places around. We tried a couple of small plates. If you don't get the Bacon Risotto you will regret it. The presentation was amazing and I'm so disappointed I didn't take a picture. We sat at the bar and Ryan was our bartender. He was a wealth of knowledge and was one of the most attentive bartenders we've experienced in a very long time. We asked about the upstairs bar (which doesn't serve food) but has a different cocktail menu and from what we had heard one of the most grand appearances around. He actually took us upstairs. Yes, walked us up there so we could check it out. It's not openly apparent where the downstairs and upstairs come together. He didn't leave the bar unattended to do so, he ensured everyone was covered. The upstairs is wow. Absolutely stunning architecture and they've kept a lot of the original items from the citizens bank building built I believe in 1901. The decor is stunning. It's the lobby and their are residences above but still feels intimate. It's huge but cosy. After we finished downstairs we went up for an after dinner cocktail to completely have our minds blown by the menu. I didn't know what some of the ingredients and alcohol mentioned on the menu were. Another fantastic bartender whose name eludes me probably because of the super strong and insanely delicious drink I had. He was almost a history buff of every drink, how the alcohol is made, who invented the drink at the turn of the 19th century type of info. Turns out they were trained in New Orleans by some of the best. It clearly shows. There was a drink presentation for a couple of the cocktails on the menu that included dimming the lights and lighting it on fire. The drink I wanted did not based on the menu. I asked and he changed an ingredient to give me a fire pour anyway. The glasses are chilled with liquid nitrogen. It is an amazing experience. We will return.

I was somewhat disappointed with the pizza offered here. I was expecting a setup like Maddio's(which I like alot). The pizzas are just a bit bigger than a personal(you might even have 2 slices to take home with you vs a basic personal). what I like is that it is thin crust and the employees were great(no attitude and tried to be helpful). My wife ordered the gluten free pizza and it was terrible. I mean the crust was lifeless(like eating cardboard) and soggy to the point the center of the pizza seemed uncooked,YUCK!. Needless to say my wife absolutely hated it. She even had them recook it and it still didn't win her over. My pizza was just OK...even though my wife's pizza sucked, they did offer to make her a new one but my wife was over it Lol However they did make me another pizza to take home and that was nice of them.

Casa B is the culinary creation of architects Alberto Cabr√©, from Puerto Rico, and Angelina Jockovich from Colombia. Architects turned caterers turned restauranteurs...the combination somehow works. The clean but warm environment is separated with completely different feelings upstairs and down. Upstairs is white, clean, calm, quiet...downstairs has the open-kitchen, the quaint bar area, and the green wall. Yeah, you bet we went downstairs. \\n\\nWe walked down the white stairs, past the spoons, past the kitchen, and sat in front of the green wall, surrounded by wine bottles and bubble lights.\\n\\nWe dove right in with our mini silverware....questioning if we would actually use these (we did) while we looked over the extensive drink list, a whole packet of drinks!\\n\\nNext was deciding on the long and descriptive food menu, filled with tapas, pinchos, veggie options, and specials. After agreeing on sharing handful(s) of food, we ordered & snacked on plantain chips with asparagus dip.  \\n\\n\\nFirst were the crispy avocado rolls with a prune & cilantro sauce...\\n\\nFollowed by my favorite dish of the night, the organic vegetarian-fed beef tenderloin with saut√©ed onions, crispy shallots + grandma's ketchup. Two bites...and tastes like a whole tenderloin dinner exploded in your mouth...aaaamazing. I will go back, just for multiple orders of this dish.\\n\\n\\nNext we snacked on the yucca fries, Spanish paprika sauce + fresh parsley. The Spanish paprika sauce had such an intense smoky almost-spicy flavor.\\n\\nWhile enjoying our fries, we couldn't help but notice the sweetheart couch-chairs...still undecided how I feel about these...\\n\\nOur next course was the yucca stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon with a cilantro ginger dipping sauce: my second favorite...but I do love bacon.\\n\\nThe Puerto Rican pot roast, yucca gnocchi on a sage brown butter sauce was next...\\n\\n...and then the massive special of deconstructed seafood stew with calamari, scallops, and prawns. Tasty...but quite difficult to each, especially difficult to share.\\n\\nOur final course was the stuffed fried oysters with sweet plantain corn relish & a red pepper aioli sauce, served on a bed of sea salt.\\n\\nWe were too stuffed to even look at a dessert menu, so we used this super neat little gadget where we could rate our courses, calculate our own bill and how to split it, and even add the tip & swipe our own cards before signing with our fingers and being all set!  \\n\\nIf you like to share, and you like ordering a bunch of food, you will definitely be a fan.

How about going back to when you delivered and amazing experience???

Get a rude young lady who made me consistently repeat my order, no greeting, no thank you. I pull up and get sweet tea instead of unsweetened tea. Turn back around and after explaining the rudeness and order mess up to a \\"manager\\" I'm giving an excuse that the tea was mixed up and offered a coupon for items that I didn't order/ would never order. No apology or addressing of the rudeness or poor service. Get home, cold and overcooked nuggets.\\n\\n2) Visit. Leave drive through. Get home and realize I was given 8 count nuggets instead of 12 count. Call and talk to the \\"manager\\" at the time. Told they're sorry and if I wanted to drive all the way back. Instead I ask if I can get a call from owner. Told yes. Never get a call.\\n\\n3) Visit. Despite a car in front of me already being pulled over waiting on  items, I'm told I need to drive forward and park. But I'm actually instructed to go park on a side street bc there's no room to wait in front bc other people are already waiting. Funny that this location had no problem collecting payment quickly, but the customer then has to wait. And why would you make multiple customers pull forward and wait. In addition, there was a \\"manager\\" shouting these orders to the drive thru attendant. Why not instead be a leader of great service nd come address the customer directly, instead of hiding. When my order is brought out to me, I'm given a quick apology and again a coupon for the item they're currently pushing, not anything that I'd want. And no real attempt to adress the issue of rude/ poor service. Get home and have a kale salad instead of the normal side salad I wanted.\\n\\n4) Visit tonight. Rude attendant is more concerned about non working headset. Mixes up drink order and doesn't pack all items. Plus food is cold/ old. Family gave up halfway through entrees. Call in to talk to \\"manager\\", given excuses, and told it will be days before I can talk to owner/ GM. No specific time offered.

Bibimbap is decent (choose beef instead of chicken, if you can), the seafood pancake is crunchy, and we always have plenty of panchan. The spiciness factor is just right in the kimchee and dishes.

The buffet included a hibachi grill, udon noodle bar, salad bar, sashimi and sushi rolls galore, a crepe station, and a row of hot foods and desserts (including soft serve green tea ice cream)! \\n\\nThe hibachi grill offers a choice of meats, including shrimp, scallops, and steak. The chef cooks it with butter and lemon juice and serves it with a selection of vegetables. The wait was a little long but well worth it.\\n\\nUnfortunately for me, I'm not a big fan of raw oysters which would have looked yummy if I were adventurous enough for them. Also not a fan of crab legs, especially without the proper equipment for eating them. The hot bar had a lot of good options, including grilled squid, which I was a HUGE fan of, although I could only go through once and didn't wish for seconds. The sushi rolls were what got me though. Too many options (and very similar too) and I couldn't stop grabbing. There was so much rice overall that I had a hard time stomaching the rest of my food. The sashimi wasn't bad, wish the tuna could have been a little fresher... just looking at it I wasn't sure I should attempt it, but I gave Nori Nori the benefit of the doubt. Let's just say the next morning wasn't so pleasant. The salad bar looked meh. That's the only word I can think of to use to describe it. The seafood in the salads didn't look as fresh as I would have expected. Dessert bar was varied but I didn't see anything that popped out at me. The soft serve green tea ice cream tasted just like the powdered matcha green tea. Personally I prefer when my green tea ice cream is a little milkier and creamier but I still liked it!\\n\\nNow that I think about it, I never got to try the udon! Will need to try it next time... if there is a next time. \\n\\nI have a feeling that since it was such a busy night, the food was a little less carefully prepared, especially toward the end of the night.
