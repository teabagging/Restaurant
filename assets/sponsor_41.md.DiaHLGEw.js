Here were the areas for improvement: The buns were not exactly toasted, but rather charred black on the top, which is a little over done if you ask me.  The meat itself was good, the goat cheese wasn't evenly distributed on the little slider which made some bites better than others.  The flavor, when you got the meat, the non-burnt bread, cheese and fruit together was really good. \\n\\nMy beau had the cheeseburger sliders and liked those.

My friend and I came here and split 3 doughnuts: the Blueberry Bourbon & Basil, the PB & Spicy Marionberry Jam filled, and the Orange Olive Oil Cake donuts. \\n\\nWhile we both loved the Blueberry Bourbon & Basil icing on the donut, the donut itself was very underwhelming. I don't know if it had just been sitting out too long or what, but it wasn't fluffy nor doughy as we had expected; in fact, the texture was somewhat reminiscent of a donut you would find in Vons or Ralphs. \\n\\nPB&J was better. I could've done with more heat in the marionberry jam, but that is understandably more of a preference thing. The peanut butter powder added a nice flavor and was nicely done. Again, the donut texture was not as great as expected. \\n\\nFinally, the Orange Olive Oil cake donut was our least favorite. I wonder if the \\"olive oil\\" part was more about flavor, but it definitely wasn't the kind of olive-oil-cake moist in the manner that we had set our minds to. A bit too heavy on the dry side. The powder was alright but didn't add much to the donut, and the orange was definitely present, but... eh. We had asked the staff to surprise us on this last choice because we couldn't decide between this and the Dulce de Leche & Hazelnut. In retrospect, should've gone with the latter as it definitely looked more moist. \\n\\nOverall, we definitely enjoyed the atmosphere of Blue Star, and the staff was really great and patient while we asked a bunch of questions in order to decide what we wanted. The flavor varieties all really peaked our interest and just sound fantastic. While we would definitely say that the flavors were nice, unique, and gourmet, the execution of the actual donuts themselves were just not to the standard that we had hope.

These little things seem small, but they're essential to making Vietnamese food great.  It's all about contrast.  Sweet, salty, crunchy, sour, spicy- they all contribute to the dish.  How much do cucumbers, carrots, and daikons really cost in Chinatown?  Not very much.  I'd rather \\"risk\\" going to Dorchester than going here again.\\n\\nThe meats are fatty too.  It's ok if there are a decent amount of meat.  But it's another story if there's little meat, and the fat is the filler.  The egg roll  is small and quite oily.  Not very crispy.

The menu looks really interesting with some extravagant items like cavier.. which i did not get to try.\\n\\nRestaurant Vibe: Super cute, all the tables are marble tables. \\nService: It was OK, the server didn't seem really happy to serve or recommend us much on the food.\\n\\nHere are the things we ordered:\\n\\n1. Steak Tartar - pretty good, they give a generous amount of meat (see my photos). I liked it that they do not add too much veggies into the meat like other restaurants but I do think that it could have been saltier and the eggs could have been a bit more raw. Again, my preferences are different, I tend to like really raw stuff and salty food.  (dish rating: 7/10)\\n\\n2. Chopped Clam Pizza - the pizza is a good size to share between two people. I really liked this dish because of the generous amount of clams that they gave. The pizza just smelled really good and the thin crust pizza was cooked perfectly. (9/10) I'd give it a 10 if there were even more clams! haha\\n\\n\\n4. BUCATINI CARBONARA - my friend really liked this dish. I find the dish a bit too bland (again I like saltier food) and that the pasta was not cooked enough. I generally like pastas that are on the softer side. They do give a lot of bacon though, big chunky pieces! (6/10 - mainly because I don't like the hard pasta) (6/10)\\n\\n3. Cinnamon Roll - Nothing special for me. The bun was almost tasteless without the sauce that was drizzled on top. There were barely any raisins. I think the one from Flour Bakery is much better (3/10) I wouldn't recommend this dish. \\n\\n4. Coffee - It was normal coffee but what I liked about it was that it came in a cute filter jug. \\n\\nI do want to try out their dinner menus though! So I guess I'll be back."},{"name":"The Mission Bar & Grill","address":"724 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Best steak tips I have ever had. House salad was also on point.

We agreed to meet downstairs where I would have a table.\\n\\nI walked into a spacious room dim but not too dark, lit by small lamps on the communal tables. The server informed me last call was in 10 minutes so I took a quick look at the drink menu while pondering the logic of closing a hotel bar/restaurant at midnight. A medium selection of European ales like Boddingtons and lighter fare like Austria's Stiegel. Nothing out of left field but some solid beers with a blonde and a Hef rounding it out. I went with the cheapest can. A half litre tallboy by the name of Old German Lager. I asked the server if it compared to say other cheap lager like PBR. He agreed it did and would. $2.50? You got it! \\n\\nIt arrived ice cold with a tall pilsner glass. (How considerate.) I played nice and poured the beer. Light and straw coloured, crisp and kinda nutty-bland as many basic lagers are. It was just fine for the price. I had enough time to order one more before last call and downed it before midnight in order to meet up with everyone just before the place closed down....\\n\\n***Fast forward 3 days***\\n\\nMegan and Jared had gone to LePigeon for dinner and I was jealous but I just couldn't do another $75 meal. Although in hindsight the money I plunked into the pinball machines at Ground Kontrol would have covered it. ***yikes***\\n\\nAnyhow, after an epic marathon of pinball madness I headed back to the hotel with a case of PBR for later in the evening and stopped in at the Common for a bite of nosh and some bevies.\\n\\nI was seated at a long table with a few others seated opposite and beside me. They smiled a bit nervously but didn't engage me. The place was pretty busy and it took awhile for the server to realize I wasn't with the other party. Once she wandered over I placed my order for the Trout Rillette and another German tall can. But I wanted a cocktail first. Where the beer selection is a bit lacking the cocktail list shines and I would go back for cocktails here even if I wasn't staying at the hotel.\\n\\nI ordered a Bourbon Renewal which featured Maker's Mark, lemon, cassis and bitters. I prefer scotch as far as whiskey goes but Bourbon is a great base for a nice cocktail I figure because it's a bit sweeter. Anyhow this hit the Mark as it were **zing*** refreshingly tart and bitter with the lingering sweetness of the cassis and bourbon. I'm gonna replicate this at home.\\n\\nMy trout arrived looking very much like tuna salad. It did not taste like that though. It was a very nice. Creamy and flavourful. Not too fishy. I spread it on the crackers provided and washed it down with lager.\\n\\nNext up was the blackened catfish on ciabatta. A simple sandwich with remoulade and crunchy iceberg lettuce. I learned a thing or two about sandwiches on this trip and I will elucidate it more when I write my review for Laurelhurst Market. The catfish was well cooked and not overdone, a nice char mixed with the heavy flavour of the catfish mixed well with the mayo-like remoulade and the crunchy lettuce. A very nice sandwich that I finished with another Old German.\\n\\nAfter my very delightful meal I ordered a Spiced Dark and Stormy which used an in-house Chinese five-spiced dark rum, and blended it with a house brewed ginger beer and lime. I'm not usually a huge rum drinker but something about the five spice called to me as I was interested in how the Szechuan pepper aspect would play out - it was barely noticeable, but the anise and clove worked with the brown sugary sweet dark rum making the drink a bit of a dessert. The bit of lime lightened the whole affair and feeling well and truly good I paid for the whole shebang and headed across the bridge to meet the kids at Sassy's for some stripper-tainment - but that I suppose is another story/review"},{"name":"Shirkys Pizza Zone","address":"70 E Canal St","city":"Carroll","stars":"4.5","text":"My only experience is a bit disappointing. \\nCalled in Saturday night at 7:06 pm and was told my large pizza order would take 40 minutes.

The Rudy's people should know better than this - it's all about volume and you can't have good volume if the people have no place to sit.\\n\\nPrice: 2 stars.  For the quality of the food you get you're paying an unreasonable premium.  I can eat at Rudy's for roughly the same price with my family of 5.  What gives?

Why settle for fast food when there's delish fresh Thai food right down the street available til 3? That right there gives them 3 stars in my book. However, the food is also really good. My friends and I always get the Tom Yum fire pot and it is always scraped down to the bottom and no one does the polite..\\"you want the last scoop?\\" because it is that good. The Pad Thai is always a hit as well...at least 2 people in our party always order it and everyone always picks off their plates.\\n\\nCaveats: The spring rolls are really small and the peanut sauce is really thin...more like vinegar with crushed peanuts on it than the regular rich peanut sauce I come to expect with Thai food. Also, I get the papaya salad pretty much any Thai place I go, but this was the only place that wouldn't let me add meat to the salad. I told them, go ahead and upcharge me whatever you want because I really want the beef from the beef salad put on top of my papaya salad. The poor waiter was like...oh no no can do. Hmm..ok. Maybe he was new, and this is not standard, but that was the one thing that made me go :( The papaya salad was also SUPER SPICY!

The menu is full of Tex-Mex dining and you will probably have to order a few times to find something you like. I would recommend the Chorizo Stuffed Chicken...it's awesome and spicy.\\n\\nThe wait: The only nights where you may have a 40-60 minute wait is on Fridays and Saturdays. Also, the entire party has to be there to even be put on the waiting list to sit down. \\n\\nThe drinks: Drinks are great. The bartenders make them stiff and the prices are very reasonable. They do have daily specials which are relatively cheap and stiff as well. The Mexican Martini will get you hella tipsy for only 7 bucks :)\\n\\nThe staff: Always friendly. I have yet to come across that a**hole waiter. You know the one I'm talking about. \\n\\nNote to Smokers: There is an upstairs bar and dining area that is exclusive for smokers. Yes, that's right, you can actually smoke inside a restaurant! Non-smokers, don't fret, the smoke is very closed in and you will not smell or breathe an inch of smoke. \\n\\nOverall, I really like Trudy's.

I am of the mindset that mexican food really shouldn't be expensive since it's usually some combination of the same ingredients. Okay, maybe if it is steak or seafood it should cost a little more but $11 for spinach enchiladas? Probably not. Especially when the spinach was barely cooked and it didn't even come with beans, only plastic-tasting rice that I couldn't eat more than a bite of. \\nAlso, how are you going to mess up queso when it costs $7?!? It was EXACTLY like the velveeta+Pace picante sauce recipe that comes on the velveeta box. Only with the disgusting addition of raw onions.

However, their smokehouse pub #2 does a much better job in this area; in fact, that establishment has cider, whereas the original Barley's does not.  The smokehouse has BBQ; Barley's #1 does not.

Its been consistently solid over that time. Its always been a bit more expensive than most other takeout Chinese, but it has been worth the premium usually. However, it has been going downhill lately in a few areas - portions are shrinking, prices have gone way up, and the quality of the meat has decreased. Our modest dinner for 2 is now almost $40, up from $25 a few years ago; the portions have noticeably shrunk at the same time-  same size containers, but a little less food and a lot less meat, replaced with much more broccoli, etc; and the meat isn't as tender  as it once was.\\n\\nI do realize that there is cost inflation going up, but for me this is more extreme than most other places and has reached a tipping point.

Also, unless I erred by not ordering it specially, the \\"Wisconsin Cheddar\\" on my burger was suspiciously similar to American slices.

The banchan rotate but generally include vegetables with chili paste, kimchi, egg omelette, and scallion pancake (my favorite), and they will refill your banchan per request. \\n\\nFor appetizers, I've had the Fried Pork Gyoza, Egg Rolls, and Seafood Pancake. The Gyoza and Egg Rolls were both a bit dry and bland, but the dipping sauces made up for it. \\nThe Seafood Pancake was outstanding - it was crispy and flavorful, and came in a large portion. \\n\\nThe main menu is authentic and extensive. I've ordered the Spicy Pork Korean BBQ, Sweet and Spicy Chicken Korean BBQ, Ttokbokki, Chicken Clay Pot, and Spicy Yaki Udon Noodle. Each dish is around $20 which is a bit on the higher side, but the KBBQ and Ttokbokki were well worth it. \\n\\nThe Korean BBQ dishes were a standout - I love Korean meats and these are among the best I've had. They come on a sizzling hot plate and have the perfect kick of spice.  The meat is perfectly juicy and tender and comes in very generous portions. \\n\\nThe Ttokbokki is likewise a must-order. It packs just the right amount of heat and the ingredients mesh together masterfully. The gooey, melted cheese oozes beautifully onto the perfectly chewy rice cakes, and the fish cakes add muscle and texture. \\n\\nThe Chicken Clay Pot was nicely presented in a small stone pot, but the chicken tasted like it was undercooked and the seasoning was underwhelming. The rice to chicken ratio was too high, so the rice became tedious to eat after I had finished the chicken. If you are a carnivore like me, definitely get the KBBQ meat plates instead for more meat and flavor for your money. \\n\\nThe Spicy Yaki Udon Noodle was definitely spicy, maybe too spicy for some, but I enjoyed it.

I didn't have high expectations due to some lackluster reviews from friends I trust, but perhaps they caught this place on a bad day, or before they worked things out. \\n\\nHere's what we had. \\n\\nBeef Noodle- Broth was a tad bit on the sweet side with a pleasant little kick, beef was lean but tender (almost falling apart), noodle texture was chewy as it should be. \\n\\nLu Rou fan- Also very solid offering. I wish it came in a bigger bowl.  \\n\\nXiang Chang- Spicy version of Taiwanese sweet sausage. Definitely a tasty treat, although bit pricey for 1-2 sticks though. \\n\\nFried Pig Ears- Basically a salt-and-pepper rendition of pig ears.  Because there is a good deal of gelatin in the ear lobes, the frying allows the gelatin to take on a melted, almost buttery texture that is a perfect contrast to the crispy outer breading/shell.

I have had more meals there than I can remember and it never failed me, never misled me, never let me down. It delivers exactly what I expect and my expectations for them are high. \\n\\nFalling in love with Frasca was not hard. We walked in more than five years ago, sat down, and it was love at first bite of the Frico Caldo. We promptly decided that a trip to Friuli (Frasca's geographical area of inspiration) was in order and a few short months later we found ourselves in Northern Italy hardly being able to lift ourselves from our dinner seats after 4 hours of copious grazing on insanely fresh home-cooked dishes at La Subida. A short novel can be dedicated to that those few days in Friuli, but this is not the time for that. I will say this- if you have an itch to trek to Italy, go to Friuli. It is stunning delicious, faultless. We stayed here and here and would go back in a heartbeat. \\n\\nOver the years, Frasca has been our destination for impromptu dinners with friends, post-law-school-class-weekly-appetizers at the bar, and special occasion celebrations.

The marinated chicken is incredible. I've never had chicken like this. It's like she does something magical with those spices and chicken to infuse flavor deep into every nook and cranny of its soft, juicy white meat.

The large patio out back is actually a great place to spend an afternoon. It's nicely shaded, and so stays cool during even the hottest of Portland days. It also seems to be made of reclaimed rail-road materials, which I just think is cool.\\n\\nIt is a nice place to hang out, but that's not enough for me to go to this bar, or is it a restaurant, or something else... There should also be some combination of food and drinks, preferably of quality. There is food available, as well as a few drinks, but the quality seems sadly lacking. \\n\\nThe vegetarian cassoulet  was undercooked to the point that my beans were crunchy. Crunchy as in raw. This would of been less of an issue if the server was even remotely attentive. I will be a little lenient, as it seemed that she was tending to most of the patio by herself. While it doesn't reflect badly on her (she was simply overworked) it says bad things about the management that they would allow such a thing to happen.\\n\\n To make matters worse, when it did come time to get our bill, practically everyone at the table was charged improperly. Some people weren't given proper prices, and several drinks were left off my bill.  Because of the incredible amount of work lofted on to our poor waitress, this took far longer to clear up than one would of hoped, but we were all charged the agreed upon price eventually. \\n\\nThe drink selection is interesting, but far from expansive. While Rontoms does have a wide selection of local spirits (and a few classics), there is almost nothing on tap. For those of us who dislike Belgian style beers, there was only one real choice.

I put in a reservation on Yelp a few days before, and when we arrived the check in process was seamless, professional and without any wait (impressive for Father's Day). \\nCheck in process: 5/5\\n\\nThe service was very attentive and timely, but also wasn't overbearing (they clearly respected the privacy of the guests and were trained to not impede on the guest experience). Our waitress was very professional, kind, and clear when taking orders, and when she'd check up on us. They had separate workers to fill the water and to bus the food to us. \\nService: 5/5\\n\\nWe ordered the calamari to start off with. It was fresh and very tasty - and the seafood looked freshly breaded (it didn't look prebreaded like many other establishments use). The appetizer did take abut 5-10 mins longer to come out to us than what you'd expect. The main plates also came out about maybe 20-30 mins longer than what you'd expect. I got the sense that the culture of the restaurant was more relaxed and laid back; I didn't get the sense you'd come to the restaurant for a quick meal. You'd come for a special occasion, or an event, and thus were willing to spend some time (and money) and weren't rushing out anytime soon. \\nAppetizer: 5/5\\nTime waiting: 4/5\\n\\nWe ordered the duck plate and the chicken parm. Both plates were professionally presented and prepared to us. The duck was fresh and tasty (maybe a tad overcooked). The chicken parm was delicious and a unique take on a classic dish (a homemade, slightly peppery sauce) - and again maybe a tad overcooked as well in parts. I do agree with the sentiment that the food is overpriced. For dishes that are more than $22 bucks each, you'd expect something very special. Even though the food was quality, fresh, well presented, and special in parts (the calamari, the chicken parm sauce) - it wasn't cohesively special all together. \\nMain plates: 4/5\\nTime waiting: 4/5\\nPrice: 3/5\\n\\nThe location is absolutely pristine -- the views are impressive and beautiful looking out over the city (I'm sure it can be a very romantic place for people on a date- especially at night with the view). The restaurant itself was beautiful inside as well; the nautical theme is modern and sharp. The lighting is just right, and you're able to still see most of the views from most places in the restaurant - thanks in part to the huge windows around the perimeter. The noise level fluctuated in the restaurant. Every 15-20 minutes they'd have, rather oddly, one song play loudly in the restaurant - making it slightly difficult to hear (although, we were seated by the bar so it may have been louder). The clientele generally was a mix of younger and older people, as well as a fair amount of people in their late 20's early 30's. At times the bar got a little busy with people coming from the outside bar/patio in, but nothing out of hand. The main dining parts of the restaurant appeared fine and didn't seem overly crowded or loud. \\nLocation: 5/5\\nInterior/exterior design: 5/5\\nNoise level: 3.5/5\\n\\nOverall my father and I had a positive experience!

Instead, the server suggested the Sheger combo.  On the menu it is described as \\"for two,\\" but evidently they can scale it down for one.\\n\\nI was treated to a nice sampling of food:  a chicken dish, a beef dish, two lamb dishes, two cooked vegetable dishes (green beans and carrots, and braised greens), and a salad.  It all came on a large piece of typical Ethiopian injera bread, with a little extra injera on the side just in case.\\n\\nIt was what I have come to expect from Ethiopian food:  robust, complex seasoning.  I wouldn't say spicy, as in capsaicin overload.  But definitely spicy, as in lots of flavor going on.\\n\\nSilverwear was not provided, although perhaps they have a few knives and forks for the uninitiated.

Some flavors have been great and others could have been better but the fish is always good. I always have a craving for the spicy tuna roll and as plain as that sounds when a sushi restaurant can make a simple dish well and not mess it up then it means they are doing something right. Our favorite has got the Fuji Yama with crab (imitation) tempura, cucumber, avocado roll topped with baked scallop, imitation crabmeat and tempura crunch served with a spicy sauce. Can't go wrong with ordering sashimi either especially if they have toro. The fatty piece of bluefin tuna is a good cut to try. They sometimes have seasonal specialty rolls and we really enjoyed the Foxy Lady roll as it was light, creamy and refreshing. \\n\\nWe normally bring two little picky eaters with us and the dumplings and tonkatsu (breaded and deep fried pork chop cutlets with katsu sauce) are always a hit. For those who do not eat fish there are definitely alternatives available. The miso soup is also very warming and a good start to your dinner. \\n\\nGo give this sushi restaurant a try as the staff will make you feel like family and you'll enjoy a great meal."},{"name":"Ah-Ma's Taiwanese Kitchen","address":"931 Monroe Dr, Ste A-108","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"For the price, it's not cheap for what I'm used to.

Their cheese bread is done well, maybe even better than Fogo de Chao. Their meat selection is relatively large, and when something is not cooked to your liking, they will immediately have the kitchen make you what you want. For instance, my husband may be the only person in ATL who wants chicken hearts (which I guess is not a common thing here), but R&G will quickly have the kitchen make them.

It's an awesome concept with the bar and food menu changing quarterly. I even hosted my birthday dinner there in October. We had 15 people in our party. It was amazing. Valentine's Day was completely different. When we got there, we were given an overpriced prix fixe menu. The food was nothing like the regular menu, service was extremely slow and overall sucked. I admit. My husband were about 30 min late because of traffic. The hostess admitted they called most of the reservations to advise them about the menu changes. As a result the had 130 cancellations. We were not called. Because there were no vegan/vegetarian options on the menu, the server offered to take care of one of my guest's dinner. When the check came he renigged. I've worked in food and beverage for over a decade. I was completely disappointed by my experience. I might go by to have drinks at the bar because Treaser and Mike are amazing, but I will never dine there again. I DEFINITELY will not take another large party there.\\n\\nIn response to the response to left on Milton D's review. As a business owner, your response was very unprofessional and mostly inaccurate. \\nThe server, who smelled like alcohol, did offer to take care of his meal. The server was not cursed at or spoken to rudely. Yes the owner did stop by the table, but that did not make up for the subpar service. I made the reservation and definitely was not contacted about the menu. The staff dropped the ball. Plain and simple. Yes we did not arrive together. I own that. Please take responsibility for your \\"family\\". It is a BUSINESS. The menu you offered on Valentine's day was horrible compared to your normal menu. As far as automatic gratuity the law changed in 2011. I was working full time as a bartender and server when the law changed. Restaurants are no longer allowed to add automatic gratuity for dining parties. It is only legal in hotels, catered, banquet and resort type settings. Most people don't fight it because the amount isn't large enough to get lawyers involved and all of that.\\n\\nIn response to the owner. I have zero reason to lie. Like I stated in my review. Yes my husband and I were late. I admitted that in the first part of my review. And my other visits were great. I said that too. I make it a point to support local, minority owned businesses. You and your staff dropped the ball on Valentine's Day. I did not ask or expect anything for free. It was offered to one of the members in my party.

Not really a good place for a long conversation, since you feel like you have to pay a meter for every minute you're sitting down.

I think average dining time is like 20 minutes :P Anyways, I ordered The Reggie which is fried chicken, bacon, and cheese doused with gravy in a buttery, flaky biscuit. The biscuit was freaking amazing and the chicken was really hot and moist. The gravy was also delicious as it had some sort of meat in the sauce? Probably the best gravy and biscuits I've ever had!

I have been going to Trudy's for at least 15 years and I am becoming annoyed with this new initiative. At least this has not affected the food, it is still worth the hassle. Eating out shouldn't be this tedious, should it? \\n\\nTip: Their Mexican Martini's are pretty good, and by good I mean strong. Don't bother ordering a premium tequila though, they use a standard off-the-shelf margarita mix and I have tried it multiple ways, you can't tell the difference in taste between well and top-shelf liquor.

After seeing other guests waiting by the bar area, we wandered back and hung out with the crowd.\\n\\nThe sommelier came around to each group to check us in. We were then ushered into the main dining room of Jiko where we all took our seats around a single long table, which sat around 16 or 18 people. The wines were already placed at each seat on top of a place mat that listed the name of each wine sample. As guests started to greet and meet each other, the cheeses were quickly laid in center of the table.\\n\\nOne of the Jiko chefs came to our table to explain the cheeses that we would be having during the pairing. It was impossible to keep track of which was which during the explanation but they were kind enough to give me a print out of all of the cheeses that we sampled.  Before tasting the wine, the cheese plates were passed around the table and everyone took a sample from each onto their own plates for the wine pairings.\\n\\nThe sommelier, Raul, gave us a brief rundown of the history of South African wines. He explained how the wine industry there is still relatively a young industry and still starting out. He then went into detail about each wine, one at a time. Giving the history of the vineyard, he then explained the grapes used, and asked that we all try the wine. After taking guesses of other ingredients used in the making, he jumped in and told us how correct (or incorrect) our guesses were.\\n\\nAfter a sip (or two, or three), he requested that we then try the wine with a bit of cheese or fruit and discuss how the taste of the wine changes. All three wines we sampled were delicious on their own. With the correct cheese & fruit? The flavors were definitely enhanced!\\n\\nThis went on for all three wines and then we were able to sit and enjoy the remainder of the event. Raul would walk around and talk with the guests and answer any questions they had. All wine glasses were also refilled on request until the bottles ran dry.\\n\\nI can honestly say that this one of the most memorable and enjoyable events I've attended at Walt Disney World. For the price ($25 plus gratuity), this can't be beat. It's a fabulous way to spend an afternoon away from the parks and a chance to try some delicious wine & cheese. Would I attend a Jiko wine pairing again? I'm already planning my next trip and definitely including this in my itinerary!\\n\\nThe Jiko dress code was not mentioned when making the reservations, but almost everyone in attendance was dressed up in slightly nicer attire.

I walked in right behind a couple, who were greeted and seated immediately.  I was seated immediately following the previous couple.  The waitress returned to the couple's table approximately 5 min after they sat down and took their order.  Normally I would be understanding if a restaurant is busy, but this place was not busy by any means.... an additional 5 minutes passed and the waitress never came to take my order.  At this point I thought I'd time her to see how long it took, just for fun.  The waitress returned to the other table and brought their salads.   She still had not taken my order.  I tried turning around a couple times to try and get her attention, but not once did she make eye contact as she walked by.  Finally, I got the owner's attention and asked if I could order. I also mentioned that I had waited 20 mins and no one came to take my order.  He jokingly said we must have forgot about you, but did not offer an apology and proceeded to ask me if I had the latest iPhone.....  After he took my order, I observed the waitress return to the couple's table and ask them how their food was and asked if they needed anything else.   Meanwhile, the owner brought out my salad.  Shortly afterwards the waitress bright out my order and set it down on the table without saying a word.  Not once did she return to check on me.  I thought this was strange.  I finished my food and the a waitress brought the check to my table.  Again, without saying a word.  While I was waiting to pay for my check another couple paid and as they walked out the waitress said thank you to them and thanked them for coming in.  I paid my bill and left, but she did manage to force out a \\"thanks\\".  I'm not sure what her issue was, but hopefully it was just an anomaly.

Your cozy couches in the hotel lobby look inviting, but with my \\"business casual\\" clothes, I know I'm not invited to lounge or \\"chill\\" too long.

I joked with one of the cooks that it would be impossible figuring out what to order.  She recommended that I blindfold myself and point to something on the menu, and she promised it would be delicious.  Without doubt I think I could have done that.  While I had looked over the dinner menu and felt a little intimidated, the lunch menu was right in my wheel house.  Quality ingredients, nothing over the top confusing, and enticing.  Just how I like it.  I split a burger and pesto pasta dish (started with a T... I'll update when I figure out what it was) and both were killer.  The pasta with fresh parm and walnuts was perfectly cooked and had a nice flavor to it.  The cheddar burger, served medium rare, melted in my mouth.  To compliment it, the fries were nice and salty, which is essential to any good fry.  The burger was served with a spicy ketchup, cream fraiche and a tomato and apricot puree or chutney type side.  All three were amazing.  After devouring our meals, we sat and chatted while whittling away at the remaining fries.  Even though the place started filling up, never once did I feel rush by our servers.  The servers were friendly and attentive and we exchanged jokes while I waited on my friend.

I told her not only did we have a reservation, but the reservation was made with her, and reminded her of the number of times I had to spell our name for her.

The decor and setting of all of the rooms (especially the ballroom) is beautiful. They looked like they were taken right out of the movie. Seeing the setting i was dining in, made me have a somewhat high expectations for the food. \\n\\nWhen we got the menu, i noticed that there wasn't a really big selection but that didn't phase me too much. I ended up ordering the steak, while my other family members ordered the shrimp/scallops and the salmon. \\n\\nWhen the food arrived, it looked good, but i soon found out that with the prices that they offered for dinner it was lacking in taste and a bit in quality. My steak was pretty subpar, too salty and nothing special. My family's entrees were not particularly remarkable either (salmon too fishy, just not worth it). Sad to say, i came out pretty disappointed.  \\n\\nAfter finishing the meal, we were able to go to each room to look around. Before heading out, we were able to take a picture with the \\"host\\" - the beast himself. \\n\\nOverall I'd say check out this restaurant out for lunch (as the quick service seems to be better (based on other reviews) the dinner entrees were not that special, nor worth the price."},{"name":"Thai Passion","address":"620 Congress Ave, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Good food and very good service.

The meat was very tender and the sauce was tasty. The tomatoes were cooked well. But I didn't find this appetizer as amazing as the other yelpers and sort of wished I didn't order it b/c I was already so stuffed.\\n\\nFor the entree I got the braised short rib which was a delicious and slightly unique mix of flavors. Typically I don't like to mix my food, i tend to eat a little bit of everything. But for this dish it needed to be mixed together to show its full flavors. I usually don't like eating fat or tendon or anything and I did not taste any of those things in this dish. Although I'm sure there was some fat since the meat was so soft and juicy.\\n\\nFor the dessert I had I believe it was called malva pudding which essentially was a cake.

It is pretty cheap and there are health conscious choices to be made if you know what you are doing.  There are also many indulgent, over the top things as well.  \\n\\nI personally would choose to go there because I'm a health conscious vegetarian.  With that said, their salads are generous, tasty and pretty good -- albeit kinda inconsistent -- sometimes they are covered with tons of nuts (like too many!) and other times my salad has been lacking ingredients. I like the Asian and Market salads - but be sure you get the dressing on the side...they tend to over-dress things. They always have several vegetarian soups available, which are also quite palatable BUT all contain dairy (tomato bisque, cream of mushroom, corn chowder).\\n\\nTheir sandwiches are probably a good option for most people.  I was disappointed with mozzarella/basil/tomato sandwich on ciabatta mostly because the mozzarella was tasteless and rubbery.  My sandwich tasted better without it and I typically love the stuff.\\nThey also have a grilled vegetable sandwich for vegans.  I haven't tried it but I'm relieved to report that there's NO grilled portobello mushroom sandwich (who ever started the urban legend that portobello mushrooms taste like meat should be shot; the crutch that every lackluster chef stands on to produce a veggie alternative).\\n\\nI am disappointed to report what appeared to be less-than-honest behavior on the part of one of the co-owner/managers.  The midtown location has been running a promotion that if you come in after 8pm, they will give you two stamps (instead of one) on your F2O card.  (They are open until 9pm most nights and they are kinda slow late at night, so bringing customers in late is probably better than throwing away food).  This works well for me since  I always eat late and scramble to grab a salad or something light before places close. I had been eating at F2O regularly for a couple weeks purchasing a salad and the occasional soup or whatever.  On a recent visit, owner/manager informed me that they \\"discontinued the double stamp promotion after 8pm\\".  I didn't object but thought it strange since other people in line before me had gotten the promo that evening.  After being treated differently for no apparent reason, I didn't return for a while until I had no alternative for dinner! (Actually, the reason is likely that I only buy a salad and the owner is prolly freaked out that I will redeem my card for something more valuable or something idiotic like that.)   After returning to the establishment and finding the offending co-owner/manager off duty, I asked his business partner/manager and a staff person whether they were still offering double stamps after 8pm.  They confirmed they were.\\n\\nI'm funny about little things like a restaurant owner lying to my face about something as small as a \\"double stamp\\" on my rewards card.  It is not about the card, it is about the behavior that motivated the lie:greed. That same person has access to my credit card info.  If you will lie to me about one small thing like that, I'd estimate you are capable of almost anything.  Accordingly, I try my best to avoid doing business with people like that...they can keep the rewards card entirely.  I never asked for it to begin with, they gave it to me.  If they prefer to throw away or give away the unused food, that's their business, but I think I will be spending more time at the Whole Foods salad bar and at Doc Greens and any other business that is HONEST.  I really don't care how the food tastes...THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE LEFT A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH."},{"name":"Crema Cafe","address":"27 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"A good skinny mocha, nothing special but not bad either.

They have a large pizza menu, but I wasn't in the mood for pizza. I wanted something to fill my beer battered belly. I ordered the Lasagne Verde. When this magnificent masterpiece was placed in front of me, I had wished a candle was placed in the center. This was exactly what I wanted on my birthday. White lasagna with layers of spinach and cheese ... I miss it already. The candle was presented though! My sneaky friend told them it was my birthday when I went to use the ladies. Soft Italian cookies with whipped cream, chocolate sauce and strawberry sauce. I had no room, but I made room.

At such a high price point I was expecting amazing food but I think that they're new enough that they haven't really perfected what it takes to make food taste good. Its a shame because they've got a name brand chef that's having his name tarnished with their growing pains. The pasta came out as you'd expect to get it in a cafeteria with no garnishing or compliments to the dish (bread would be nice), it tasted way more like tomato paste than a good sauce. The fries were over-seasoned/salted to the point that they were almost hard to eat and our selection from the raw bar tasted fine, but lacked the quality and presentation expected of for the cost. \\n\\nThere are very limited options for vegetarian entrees so be aware of that.\\n\\nI think it has potential but they're going to need to tweak their recipes and bring their price point more in line with the neighborhood if they hope to survive any longer than Burton's did in that location."},{"name":"Grant Park Coffeehouse","address":"753-A Cherokee Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I'm attending a class that begins at 8am every Saturday, so I did some research and found that most coffee shops don't open until 8am.

First off, their kitchen is open later on weekends than a lot of places in the area (a lot of places kitchens close at 10, here it closes at 11). This is always my first stop when I have people visiting from out of town. They have a full bar in the center of the room, with plenty of space to sit - and dining areas on either side. Even when it is really busy I have never had to wait for a seat as there is more than enough.\\n\\nBeer is excellent - with their Titan Ale being my favorite. Another big plus is that they sell growlers. For those of you who don't know, thats those big brown jugs you can buy to enjoy their delicious beer at home - and you get a discount if you bring it back and get another. Very affordable option for some good micro brew at home. They also regularly release new/seasonal flavors and tend to have neat little events surrounding the unveiling.\\n\\nTheir food is typical pub fare. One thing I like is that their bucket of fries actually comes in a  bucket. I know, I know, this has nothing to do with quality - but I hate when you order a bucket of something and it comes in a basket. Their burgers are good, but a bit pricey if you want anything other than the standard lettuce/tomato on it. My favorite dish is the big tuna melt - which is done differently here than anywhere else I have been. Its served on a pita pizza style with tomatoes and cheese. Yum! \\n\\nCalamari appetizer is great, just the right crunch. And the nachos are great - especially because the chips and 'dip' come separate which I prefer because you can put as much or as little as you want on each chip. Works great to share with 3-4 people.\\n\\nOnly reason I knocked one star off is because service is hit or miss. Sometimes its excellent, but sometimes its lackluster. A few times i have had difficulty tracking down our waiter to order food or get refills (always seems to be the same guy we have trouble with). But on the other hand, they get props because Ive come in a few times right before the kitchen was to close, and never had them sigh or be visually displeased with our presence.

Right when you walk in, you're greeted with the sushi bar and upon sitting down, I kind of thought it was strange to have the sushi right by the front door but how they present their sushi is their selling point because of how great the presentation is, and it doesnt affect the temperature of the sushi. They had well over 15 to maybe 20 rolls with your basics and your advanced rolls. The best part about the sushi bar, they allow you get as much spicy mayo and eel sauce you want, unlike other buffets that are greedy with their spicy mayo.

The Indo-Chinese options (Hakka noodles and tofu chili) were passable, albeit lukewarm. The naan was rock-hard and cold, and the steamed rice was dried out and constantly getting stuck in my teeth. Idlis sat under plastic wrap, cold and soggy, and the sambhar was unspectacularly watery.

It's easy to get lost, and at night--you genuinely wonder if wildebeasts and lions are gonna jump out of the tall grass after you finally find the place and park your wheels.\\n\\nThe ambiance?  Sterling.  Business casual is strictly enforced.  Feel free to be fancy--I daresay it will help you capitalize on the experience.  The service is welcoming, accommodating, and was (in my party's experience) top-notch.\\n\\nJiko does some food better than others--don't think it's perfect.  I'm not saying it is.  But the wait staff will help steer you towards what you desire.  My advice?  Choose your food, and make it something more traditionally South African, like their divine pork shank or crazy short rib (with some magical barley-saffron risotto stuff that knocks it out of the park).  Ask their sommelier to choose a wine (by the glass) for you, or a whole bottle if you're going cray.  I was given a black rose that I am gonna be thinking about for a loooong time.  It had the most beautiful fragrant nose, and drank like it was at least $40 more expensive than it was.  Don't be afraid, even if you don't like wine.\\n\\nThe beer?  Avoid the Casablanca brew and heed my words: Never buy booze from a Muslim country.  (they don't drink, dummy!)  My friend ordered a South African Tusker and liked it, but novelty aside... it was just a lager.\\n\\nThe cheese plate?  I liked it, but having sold cheese myself--I was surprised at the low-tier cheeses chosen.  Cremont?  Really?  It's $14 a pound and NBD.  Bayley Hayden blue?  It's really not that strong of a cheese (in character, not flavor).  Come on.  You failed to impress me.  Try Sottocenere or a more robust wash-rind cheese, Jiko.  Turn up your cheese game for us snobs. xoxo\\n\\nMUST ORDER: The wild boar tenderloin appetizer and the Malva cake for dessert. Save room.

They were one of the first in Columbus to introduce these street tacos and I am in love. But first, if you get anything else here besides tacos, get their chips and guac. OUTSTANDING. The guacamole was garlicky and fresh and I think their chips are homemade. It's a little pricey at I think close to $8 but worth it. \\n\\nTheir menu is simple. There aren't many things on it, which I like. Definitely try the short rib taco and the pork belly pastor if you're a first timer. The flavors are mixed so well. The only thing with their tacos is that they're a little pricey at $4 each. They aren't big tacos so I think they're a little overpriced. Supposedly they have a happy hour that was voted best in the city at some point and I don't understand why. We went for a happy hour and they had one beer on special so I guess I'm missing something....unless you get PBR, which they serve in a boot glass. Who doesn't enjoy a boot glass?!\\n\\nAnyway, the decor is western themed. They were playing \\"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\\" on the TV and usually play a John Wayne movie or some classic western. I think that's pretty neat. A nice stray from a sports event.

Taste was mediocre at best for my grouper sandwich, with no offered add-ons other than salt/pepper at the table (had nothing on the sandwich).

We were going to order an appetizer for us and kid's meal for our daughter, but we decided against both because we had already waited so long we just wanted to eat and get out ASAP.  When she came over to serve us she did not apologize for the wait and instead of asking what we would like she just said \\"go for it\\", she seemed annoyed that my wife asked her to come and take our order. I got the buffalo turkey burger which was very good but not very spicy as it would imply being buffalo. My wife ordered the veggie burger which she enjoyed.  Somebody else delivered the food and somebody else also asked if we needed refills on our drinks (because our server never came by to check and he noticed our drinks were empty for the longest time).  She finally came by after we were almost finished eating and her question was \\"do you need anything else here or are you all set?\\"  We said no thank you.  Then the wait for the check began. After my wife had to take our 2 year old daughter to the car because she was nowhere in sight, she brought me the bill and I finally was able to leave. Just before we left, the table next to us had to find their server (different one) and ask when their food was coming because they had been waiting so long.

They'll make you feel slightly better about your New Year's resolutions, and the chipotle sauce is incredible. The nachos here are also pretty tasty. The hot pretzel appetizer is a bit unusual (at least from what I expected); they serve four gigantic hot dog-sized pretzels and two dips (one cheese, one mustard). I'm personally a bigger fan of cheese with pretzels, but instead of it being a dip, it was more like fondue. Not a bad thing, but just something to be aware of.

It is a fresh baked biscuit, served sandwich style, with a piece of fried chicken, bacon, cheese, and an easy egg, all smothered in home made sausage gravy and served on a plate, to be eaten with messy hands, or a fork and knife. Either way, it's the best biscuit sandwich EVER. The Reggie Deluxe is far more than a biscuit sandwich, and it gets my seal of approval for both it's simplicity and it's complexity. Every item on this sandwich is cooked on it's own, and for it to come together well, every item has to be cooked perfectly. The chicken was just so, with wonderful seasoning; The bacon was smoky and crispy; the cheddar cheese was melted right below the egg, which was flavorful and fresh; the biscuit flaked apart and had a delicious buttery texture; and the sausage gravy, is a little peppery and salty, and delicious. \\n\\nI might not check in or Yelp a lot, but I go out to eat A LOT. I like to frequent restaurants such as Pine State Biscuits on my weekdays off, not during the busy weekend brunch rush.

We also ordered a red wine flight to go with our pizza. The wine flight actually took a really long time to get there. Even with the pizza coming late, we didn't get our wine flight until after we finished our pasta. The pasta was pretty good but nothing to write home about. The wine flight was good as well, there's always the one you don't love but it was okay for the price. Now the star of the show. The pizza. It was so wonderful.

Bland even when drenched in sauce. \\n-- Total cost: $23.44 \\n\\nService was brisk, almost friendly.  I saw another server giving a couple a hard time because they had too many questions or wanted to modify their food. With 1000 menu items to choose from and a language barrier, I say just pick something and save your neediness for a different restaurant. I do wish that on a 90 degree day we were offered water instead of scalding hot tea. Also, my BF's soda was $2.50, which is utterly ridiculous. \\n\\nThough far from a fine dining experience, and perhaps even an authentic experience, Hon's offers great value and pretty darn good food. It was one of our least expensive meals in Vancouver and we left absolutely stuffed. It's a good place for vegetarians, and in fact has four separate kitchens, one of which is just for preparing vegetarian items. I'd come back because there are so many things to try on the never ending menu.  4 Stars for what it is. \\n\\nIf you crave Hon's outside of the restaurant, I think there were either some prepackaged foods for sale or a sign showing where you could get Hon's in grocery stores."},{"name":"Mellow Mushroom Orlando","address":"11680 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Went there a few weeks back.

However, someone in my group suggested Anh and Chi for a birthday dinner as they heard it was good. They also wanted to do the ANH tasting menu, which I did not have last time, so I thought maybe it will be better this time. Wrong.\\n\\nThe tasting menu overall took us over 3 hours from start to finish, and it was not because they had a lot of courses to serve. The menu overall was OK, but isn't the cause of the downgrade to one star.\\n\\nBest dish: King Prawn Tamarind Soup: this was my favourite dish, the flavour of the broth was great and it wasn't too sweet, and I liked the vegetables and pineapple they put in the soup.\\n\\nWorst dish: Homemade Banana Cake: this was really not good. It tasted like they had just hurriedly microwaved some sticky rice. The texture was really rubbery. \\n\\nEverything else was alright, nothing particularly bad or good.\\n\\nOverall, we thought the staff was pretty dismissive and rude, and they acted like they had much better things to do than listen to our plebeian requests for food and drink. They all looked confused/annoyed and asked us multiple times during the dinner whether we had received x course or y course yet, as it seemed they did not keep track. \\n\\nThey also gave us two bowls of rice after we were done with the char which is unfortunate because it would have gone well together. Not sure if they missed the rice or something. But then during the soup course, another waiter kind of just put a third bowl of rice down but just walked away. Not sure if we were supposed to have rice in the soup, or maybe he got distracted by something else.\\n\\nThe end of the night finally came, and the staff charged us for too many people. Hard to get anyone's attention to fix the mistake, but finally got up out of the table to speak to our waiter directly to have it fixed and we paid and got outta there. At $39 per person plus tax and tip, it seems we are paying a premium for poor service. \\n\\nHowever, judging by the other reviews, I seem to have really bad luck, or I'm not cool enough. Probably both."},{"name":"Pizzeria Ludica","address":"189 Keefer Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Really had a great time with friends however the servers were very rude and did not indicate time limits nor minimum food purchases before we entered.

I was very impressed and ended up visiting this place twice while I was in town. \\n\\nI tried the beef pho with steak and meatballs and then the seafood on the next trip. Both broths were very tasty, and in my opinion needed no extra sauce (hoisin or sriracha) at all.  The garnishes were fresh and plentiful. They only provide a single slice of jalapeno, but I don't use more than that anyway. I'm sure you could ask for more. The seafood pho was FULL of stuff. Baby corn, broccoli, squid, scallops, shrimp, etc. \\n\\nOverall I feel like when you walk out of a restaurant after eating a big bowl of pho you should feel fulfilled. Not just your hunger but your whole body. That's how I felt when I left here.

We asked our server to wipe it for us and she gave it a few haphazard swipes down the center.  We were also surprised that there was not a drink included with the kids meal.  Rather than spend $1.50 for soda, we opted for water for the kids.  It was brought over in full to the brim adult sized cups.  No kids sized cups or lids.  They were so full that as my 6 year old tried to slide his over, ice water sloshed onto the table.  The server finished putting drinks down and left.  I was assuming she went to get a rag to wipe up the ice water since she had to put another drink down around the puddle ... but she never did.  We made a few attempts to clean it up with the flimsy napkins but there was still a puddle there when our food was delivered, when she came to check how the food was, when she brought the bill and when we left.  Food service was pretty slow.  It was certainly well over 20 minutes and it was not that busy.  I had a veggie burger and it was very mushy.  The taste was alright but it was more taco filling consistency than burger like.  I was also surprised that a $7 veggie burger did not come with fries; my husbands burger didn't either.

The cast member nearby asked us if we had reservations. We didn't, of course, but we were hungry. Sorry, but reservations were required. Fair enough, so we continued on our search for food. \\n\\nThat night, we started looking at planning another trip so we could try to hit up the new stuff that requires fast passes or reservations further out - like Be Our Guest.  We managed to snag one of the last few reservations 2 months out - at lunch time. \\n\\nAs our reservation approached, we spoke to some friends who had also recently Been Their Guests. One group had felt underwhelmed, complaining that it had been overly expensive - but they had gone for dinner. Another friend advised that we try to get tables in one of the side rooms, as the main room gets too noisy.\\n\\nWe also looked up reviews (on Yelp, of course), and found a few suggestions regarding items on the menu.\\n\\nReady for our visit, we had imagined a restaurant and dining experience. What we got was a fancy cafeteria.\\n\\nWe arrived at the entrance a few minutes ahead of our reservation as instructed. While my wife was checking in, a group of 17 without reservations came up behind us and spoke to another cast member. Surely, they would be turned away from this restaurant that requires reservations, right? Nope. I'm not sure if policies have changed, or if they had some sort of fairy godmother casting a spell, but they got in - right away. \\n\\nArmed with our hollow hockey puck with a vague rose design on it, we stepped into the line waiting to be seated.

No, this was not a standard table service restaurant like we expected. At least, not at lunch.\\n\\nSo, order your food at a kiosk - some of which were manned/aided by cast members, some not. If you ordered a fountain drink, you're on the honor system to just grab a cup and fill it yourself in the dining areas. There are machines in each of the rooms. If you ordered a bottled drink, it's delivered with your food. You're also responsible for grabbing your own silverware and napkins from a cart. If you ordered a soup, a spoon is delivered with the soup.\\n\\nAs we had been warned, it was really loud in the main room (which vaguely looked like the ballroom from the movie), so we chose to sit in one of the side rooms. The paintings and decorations were really nice and there was a spinning statue of Belle and the Beast in the middle. My wife had been expecting some sort of show or effects or attraction to tie in with the movie. We saw none.\\n\\nDirty tables were bussed fairly quickly, and there were plenty of table available, but since tables were not assigned, a number of people were sitting at tables not quite appropriately sized for their group. The result was a lot of people walking around trying to find a table for their group. That group of 17 came in and put together about 8 tables to accommodate their group.\\n\\nFood was delivered fairly quickly, and it come on fancy little carts. The servers locate your table using some sort of black magic with either the hockey-puck-rose or your magic band that lets them track where you are sitting. Pretty cool, pretty creepy.\\n\\nSince this isn't proper table service, appetizers/soup courses are served at the same time as entrees.\\n\\nThe French Onion soup was very tasty, but is made with vegetable broth instead of beef broth (and I'm assuming no Brandy either). So, while it's enjoyable, it lacks the depth of flavor one might be expecting.\\n\\nThe braised pork was good overall, but I found that some bits were perfectly moist, and others were overcooked and almost dry. Some more seasoning (pepper, specifically) would have done it wonders. Similarly, the green beans they were served with would have loved some nice coarse salt. The tuna nicoise salad, however, was just pure disappointment. The greens were nice and healthy, but the dish only included two meager pieces of tuna, and they weren't that good to begin with. While the soups and pork were fairly priced, the tuna was probably double the price it deserved to be.\\n\\nMaybe the dinner service is exactly what we were looking for or expecting, but the lunch experience just isn't worth it."},{"name":"Mike and Lill's Black Sheep Pub & Grill","address":"5 Central St, the other day","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"Not great.

We were told the fryer was off and they were no longer making the chicken strips. Which is pretty much the only reason we went there, and wanted to call ahead (but there's no phone). Fine, it's not their fault.

I checked the contents and could smell the meaty chili, which was watery.\\n\\nWhich leads me to talk about the food: the chili is more like hunks of beef in a watery salty base--it was okay, but definitely not what I'd call chili. \\n\\nThe beet salad was super duper soggy, and tasted like stale walnuts. The kale salad was so gingery we stopped eating after a few bites, and the mashed potatoes were lukewarm and had a really strange taste to it I can't put my finger on (anise?). \\n\\nOverall, I think that's the best way to describe my food experience at CC--everything was one note. None of the dishes had any savoriness, and seemed to lack afterthought. It was like \\"let's mix these ingredients together and hope they work out.\\" They do not.\\n\\nI suppose it could be because we were there a half hour before closing, but that makes no sense. If you have customers who are there to eat, shouldn't you always have the same quality of food throughout the day?

Do people actually ENJOY the food there, or is it just so popular because it's the \\"cool\\" east van diner to get your cheap breakie on? Now before you all start throwing stones at me, hear me out:\\n\\nI used to frequent Bon's up until three years ago. Back in my days of being a young adult, I was perpetually broke and had low standards when it came to food, therefore a cheap meal with undercooked \\"hashbrowns\\" and sausage that made me sick and almost crap myself was just the way I rolled. Those days are no more; there are dozens of other greasy spoons that serve a better breakfast for relatively the same price and now I'm old enough to no longer give a fuck what's cool and not just go there because everyone else does.\\n\\nTo be fair, I decided to give Bon's one more chance before writing this review, so yesterday I went for breakfast. The place was packed and my date and I got there just before the lineup started forming. The service is still slow, the place is still filthy. I ordered the all day breakfast. It showed up 20 minutes later, the toast cold and hard. I ate the sausage and eggs but didn't bother with the rest even though I was starving, and anyone who knows me knows that when I'm hungry I don't leave food on my plate. My date had the vegetarian omelet which looked a bit better than my meal, but he confirmed it was pretty gross as well.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Bon's is still less that mediocre and I won't be going back, but I'll give them two stars for being consistent and for the fact that the sausage didn't make me sick for once."},{"name":"Shirkys Pizza Zone","address":"70 E Canal St","city":"Carroll","stars":"4.5","text":"Enjoyed this place.

For our experience, the notion that buffet food, in general, is of low quality was a statement that did not apply here. My food tasted fresh and well-made.

One taste of a 'mallow here and you'll never want the store-bought variety made with additives and artificial ingredients. \\n\\nThere are many treats available on a regular basis, with seasonal offerings that fit the weather and holidays:\\n\\n-  For a classic Wondermade experience, get a s'more with the day's flavors and milk or dark chocolate (they offer only certain flavors for in-store treats each day, but there are plenty of options. Their packaged marshmallows are available in all flavors that they currently have in stock). Or for something extra special, get one of their gourmet s'mores with extra toppings and special grahams. We always ask them to melt the chocolate a little for us before they assemble the s'more. \\n\\n-  In the summer, their s'mores ice cream hits the spot and has a marshmallow in almost every bite. They also offer coconut-based ice cream flavors for those who can't eat dairy (make sure you ask about food prep techniques if you have a true allergy, as I can't speak to how they make and serve the dairy free ice cream). \\n\\n-  Don't miss out on seasonal pops, sandwiches, and new marshmallow flavors. The peppermint flavor is delicious in a cup of hot cocoa on Christmas morning, and a pumpkin mallow broiled and served on a graham cracker is reminiscent of pumpkin pie.\\n\\n-  The prepackaged marshmallows make a wonderful gift for special holidays, birthdays, or if you're staying at someone's home in another town. We always gift them with the recommendation to eat them on an open-faced s'mores made in the oven (graham cracker, chocolate and 'mallow on top, broiled until the 'mallow is just golden). Or chop them up straight out of the box to mix into your favorite ice cream. \\n\\n-  They offer online orders and occasionally have special offers around holidays. Watch their social media channels if you're interested.  \\n\\n-  Their owner, Nathan, has an interesting Ted Talk about how he and his wife started making mallows and eventually opened shop. We recommend watching it to get the background story. \\n\\nThe prices are a little higher than your corporate chain ice cream shop, but the quality of ingredients is higher, their offerings are unique, and it's a local business. \\n\\nWe've watched Wondermade grow and expand since discovering the shop four years ago, and with the owners' inventiveness, it's sure to be a sweet spot for generations of Central Floridians to come."},{"name":"Blue Diamond","address":"2016 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great afternoon grillred cheese.

It oddly almost reminded me of Korean fried chicken from a place like bonchon or of that caliber.\\n\\nAnd what about the other donuts? Let's start with the fact that making the decision of which donut to get was agonizing as everything looked interestingly delicious. We ordered 3 to go (~$3/donut):\\nHard Apple Cider fritter: The boys behind the counter helped me pick this one out. They basically said their fritters are a must try. The \\"hard\\" part of the apple cider elevated this donut over any regular apple fritter. \\n\\nCointreau Creme Brulee: Why is there a pipette sticking out of that donut is probably your first thought at sight of this donut. Within the pipette is an orange liqueur that can be squeezed directly into the donut or taken as a shot separate of the donut. I didn't need the Cointreau in my creme brulee. I think my palate was a little confused and over-sugared.\\n\\nBlueberry basil bourbon: This one was sweeter than it needed to be. If the sweet was tamed I think the bourbon and basil flavors could have been more highlighted. \\n\\nSpeaking of the boys behind the counter. They were very friendly, helpful, and extremely patient of our indecisiveness. \\n\\nSo my final decision: fried chicken donut, of course.

My friend Tina used to manage there and knew that I was a big fan of micros, especially ales, and she turned me on to Barley's famous Scottish Ale, which remains hands down my favorite microbrew in Ohio.

I have watched a steady decline in their service, but tonight was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. We came tonight specifically because we wanted to sit at the bar, watch football, have martinis, nachos, and the avocado sauce. All was good until my husband pulled a hair out of the avocado dip (that clearly did not belong to either of us). We held the chip up to the bartender and let him know what happened. He took the chip, inspected it, and said, \\"Oh no, that's not good.\\" He proceeded to throw it away and then acted like nothing happened. I asked if he could get more dip from another source (one without hair), and he did. And that was that. Later we asked the other bartender (a nice young woman) to talk to a manager and she asked what happened. We told her, she talked with the original bartender and then said he would take care of it. He called a manager on their system, and a couple of minutes later the female bartender typed something in the computer and said, \\"Ok, let's see what they did.\\" In the end they charged us half price for the nachos. Whoopetydoo...the female bartender was the only one who actually said, \\"I'm sorry.\\" A manager never even came out and acknowledged it in any way.

Seemingly understaffed, only two young women doubling as servers and hostesses, I will note that my coffee twice ran empty during my brunch and worse, given my vantage of the kitchen I was rather annoyed as I watched many plates - mine included - sit at the pass for five or more minutes before service, a situation that could have easily been remedied by an extra runner or by serving plates as they were readied instead of batching them so everything arrived at once.\\n\\nSetting aside the dysfunctional service and moving to the food itself my order consisted of two items...one \\"savory\\" and one \\"sweet,\\" but both with elements of each and both excellent.  Starting with the savory, yet another Monte Cristo in a city where the dish is seemingly ubiquitous, the version served at Clyde Common consisted of a single slice of rich fried brioche topped with shaved loin ham and pecorino tartufo plus a lightly dressed salad and a dollop of Fig mostarda and two sunnyside eggs.  Rich and balanced, naturally sweet from the figs but plenty savory otherwise, and benefitted by cracked pepper plus the light vinaigrette on the salad this was not a traditional Monte Cristo like that at Gravy...it was better.\\n\\nTransitioning from my favorite savory breakfast to my favorite dessert, the only thing that could have made the Common's take on bread pudding better is if it would have been served in a more expedited manner as a separate course so that I could have enjoyed it piping hot instead of luke warm - and yet even with that going against it the \\"Spiced Bread Pudding\\" was still pretty fantastic; the warm and dense oatmeal based bread served in a shallow baking ceramic with peanut brittle, chevre, pear preserves, and hand-whipped cream adding elements of sweet and salty plus crunchy and creamy to a wintery base of molasses, ginger, and cinnamon.

The fries were probably one of the better fries in Waltham, I've had. It was cut to a good size and fried to a nice crunch where it was not burnt but not soggy, and had that nice crisp crunch to it.  \\n\\nWhile I'd like to keep at 3 star rating, it must be brought down a notch to say 2.5. Mainly since the food really seem to have gone downhill since 2007.

Food and quality: Several types of meat served. Many were fatty and overly salty. 2 nice cuts of meat: ribeye and filet mignon. Several lower grade meats including rump roast-their specialty & bottom sirloin. Salad bar and sides: salad bar was decently presented for a salad bar, but probably not at this price point. Hot sides included these items only 2 soups- mushroom and vegetable beef (made with canned vegetables) and pasta shells in a tomato cream sauce, french fried potato slivers, black beans, white rice, and fried plantains that had been there a while.

Samples cost 0.75 and are served in a shot glass.  I would never order a beer I was unfamiliar with without sampling it, and to not ask is your bad, not the server's or establishment's.\\n\\nThe beers are, in general, good.  I wish they offered more varieties and seasonals, like Great Lakes, but then again, Barley's doesn't have the same size and scale operation as Great Lakes, so that's not fair of me.  You can't go to Kroger's and buy Barley's brew.  \\n\\nThe food is quite good and reasonably priced.  I've been a vegetarian since 2006 and the portobello mushroom burger is incredible here, the best I've had, and I order it pretty much anywhere I see one.  There aren't a lot of veg. options and I've been without meat for too long to remember my meals here before I quit eating it.  Like others said, it is somewhat on the Irish or Scottish side, a lot of sausage and meat dishes.\\n\\nThey also host the Real Ale Festival every year, these guys take their brewing more seriously than the other handful of local brewers.  On Friday night you can get beer out of the Firkin for, I think, 4.50 or 5 bucks.  The Firkin is beer straight from the brewery.  Never kegged, piped right into a Firkin cask that sits on the bar.  This beer is served at room temperature and is not pressurized with nitrogen or CO2.  That means it's flat, folks.  Uncarbonated.  It's meant to be that way though, and you should give it a try at least once.  \\n\\nI should note that although the service is generally just fine, I had one of my worst experiences ever here.

I've never had it really heard much about it. So on a hungry Saturday, we decided to check it out for a nice post workout meal.\\n\\nI like the concept of this place. You can chose between about 6 different main meats such as Brisket, Turkey, Pork etc... They do offer fried Artichoke as well, which is not a meat. Each one comes with as sauce as well. Then you can choose between 4 base's such ass Corncake, Bread Roll, Mac and cheese, Salad.  I got to try the turkey with white BBQ on top of the sandwich roll, and the Fired Artichokes on top of mac and cheese. First let me start off by saying that their Mac and Cheese is really really good. So I suggest that you try that. If you are a fan of Mac and Cheese then don't miss the opportunity. ALSO if you get mac and cheese as a side, you get basically nothing. It is NOT worth the 3 dollar price tag. Look at my pic in the review. That's all the Mac you get for a normal side. I'd suggest getting the big side, or getting it as a base... The turkey on the sandwich roll was very good as well. If you are into sandwiches, I'd say try it. The white BBQ sauce it comes with is perfect.  \\n\\nThe place has a pretty decent setup. When you walk you see it looks like a naturally lit place. But to the right of the door it looks like its setup in someone's basement or garage. Not too visually appealing at all. Maybe it looks better at night though. I'm not sure. But to the left of the door everything looks nice and modern. If you visit, you will get what I mean, so just trust me.\\n\\nService is fast and friendly. We got out food in no time. You don't really have servers. Just people who bring out your food for you after you order. No complaints here in this department.\\n\\nI'll say that this place is pretty good and solid. My biggest thing is, the proportions for the sides. It did not justify the amount of money I was spending for sure. Otherwise everything tasted good and the service was nice.

I always remembered having a good time there.  It was always crowded, and we often had to wait.  I remembered the food being pretty good.\\n\\nNow, a few years later, my dining companion and I decided to go back and tap back into Juanita's.  We were looking forward to it being as good and fun as we remembered.  It was neither, unfortunately.\\n\\nIt was a Saturday night, and the place was dead.  Absolutely dead.  There was only one table sat in the front area, and there were probably 5 or so in the back area.  Yes.  On a Saturday night on Pearl.  You could almost hear crickets chirping.  I would soon come to understand why it was so dead, while the place next door (Salt) was blowing up.  \\n\\nOur service was prompt, friendly, and attentive, so that wasn't the issue at all.  The margs were also decent, but seemed fairly weak.  The true issue was the food.  It was honestly terrible.  My dining companion and I agreed that it was one of the worst meals we'd had in quite a while.  I ordered a combo, because I wanted to try a little of everything.  It came with rice and beans, a chicken burrito, a relleno, and a beef enchi.  The burrito was flavorless.  It was filled with unspiced  chopped chicken.  The tortilla clearly hadn't been warmed before being smothered.  The green chile was really odd.  It was spiced, but the flavor was just off/weird.  The enchi sauce tasted like it came straight from a can.  The pepper in the relleno wasn't tender, but was actually extremely firm.  It tasted gross.  The beans and the rice were completely flavorless too.  However, this plate was gourmet compared to what my dining companion was served.\\n\\nHe got a smothered chicken burrito deluxe.  It looked huge when the server brought it out.  Inside, my friend discovered the same plain chopped up chicken breast I had in my own burrito, along with rice, beans, and TONS of cold lettuce.  The burrito had a lot of cheese on it, but barely any green chile.  On the side of his burrito, he had two big piles of the same rice and beans that were taking over the inside of his burrito.  There was also an additional pile of cold iceberg lettuce.  The tortilla was also stiff, and had clearly not been warmed before being incorporated into the burrito.  He barely ate a third of it before giving up.  It was really kind of shocking how bad it all was in terms of flavor and preparation.  And, to boot, it was quite pricey.  His burrito was almost 12 dollars.\\n\\nSomething has changed since I went here in college.  The food was shockingly terrible, and I am almost positive that's the reason the place was a ghost town on a Saturday night.  It's really sad, actually.  During its heyday, this place was electric.  Now, it seems like it's just sitting in the corner, waiting to die.  If the owners don't do something about the food, I'm afraid that Juanita's will eventually go under.  It makes me sad to say that, but it's true."},{"name":"Frasca Food and Wine","address":"1738 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"You're still lingering in my thoughts, Frasca. I went there today after a friend encouraged me to try their salumi bar. Apparently, that was one of the relocations affected by the expansion. I still seated myself at the bar next to the salumi slicer (a fascinating device).\\n\\nI found the staff very welcoming from the beginning. I found it unusual that the hostess asked my name though I was seating myself at the bar, but that's Frasca's way. Here is what else I learned:\\n\\nYou have two water choices, still or sparkling. The wine menu (wine by the glass page 5) is absolutely fascinating. If it weren't for the large salumi plate tantalizing me, I would have continued reading it. Their dedication to the Friuli region boggles my mind. There seems to be so many amazing wine varieties from the region. I'm actually inspired to understand their fascination with the region. I'm glad the bartender was patient as I struggled to make a drink choice. It's nice not to feel pressured by hovering staff.\\n\\nThe Corpse Reviver No.2 is an excellent cocktail. I can imagine it as a morning pick-me-up. The scent of absinthe and the finishing touch of the cherry were fresh compliments to my meal. \\n\\nThe salumi plate was hands on eating fun. Prosciutto from Friuli was subtly buttery, scarpetta slightly spicy with a peppery sensation, the speck was my favorite. Their breadsticks seemed to be a good palate cleanser. Also, be sure to get the complimentary bread and butter. \\n\\nThey are still adjusting to their changes, though it was only noticeable by the fact that the bartender was instructing some staff behind the bar. Neighborhood friends of Chef Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson were seated next to me briefly. They spoke very highly of him, but next thing I know they're whisked away to hang out in the kitchen. I debated sneaking behind them.\\n\\nI might have given them five stars, but I was overcharged slightly on my cocktail. I forgot to inquire because the bartender introduced herself to me and asked me what I was doing this evening. That led to a brief discussion of parkour that included the salumi guy too. Darn the distractions. It was a honest mistake, though. (Update: Frasca's bartender contacted me via yelp and it's been worked out.

After celebrating our second wedding anniversary this past weekend by having dinner here, we've decided \\"Forget nostalgia, let's spend our money on a place we'll enjoy.\\"  The food is just okay.  The \\"La Scala\\" bread is like a sandwich or hamburger bun.   It had so much garlic on it, the garlic was spicy hot.  I like garlic but this was borderline inedible, like just munching on a garlic clove.  A side wedge salad is $10.50, which is ridiculous for what you're getting.  Even though it's an Italian restaurant and I ordered pasta, they didn't offer fresh Parmesan or pepper.  The water was a warm tap water with only a few ice cubes that quickly melted, and that made me sad.  The service was a hair above poor. My husband order chicken saltimbocco but was given chicken picatta (we didn't bother to mention it.)  We waited 20+ minutes to order and while we waited, we watched other tables get the complimentary bread that we never received. The waiter had no personality and didn't ask if we were there for a special occasion or try to chat us up at all.  My husband said when he made reservations, they were very congenial and he told them it was for our anniversary, so I think he was expecting the waitress to mention our special occasion.  (I know, that sounds like I'm asking a lot.)  My appetizer plate was dirty before I used it.  Our meal was $100...Hyde Park prices but without the great quality of Hyde Park.  I just really wish they would step it up.  I will say this, I love the decor of the restaurant...dark, intimate and with live music.  \\n\\nBe sure to make reservations. Last year we made the mistake of showing up on a Saturday around 7:00 p.m. and were told they weren't seating anyone, they were completely booked for the night.  This year we made reservations 3 weeks in advance and the only available times were 5:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m.    It's a big homecoming date spot, apparently."},{"name":"Bob Evans","address":"6085 Gender Rd","city":"Canal Winchester","stars":"2","text":"If you have a big family and you want to take them out to lunch dont take them to Bob Evans  in Canal Winchester.

I'm usually a bourbon fan (which they do have a selection), but the flight seemed like a good way to try what they actually make. \\n\\nThe sample is $7 for 3. I chose a blood orange type, Pilsner, and the Russian. I enjoyed all of them! I enjoyed the Russian one and blood orange a lot more. My friends also did flights. One got a pale ale, which I didn't really enjoy.\\n\\nThe Reuben was phenomenal though!! It's not super hearty but it was a good portion size. The bread was buttery and had a nice crunch to it. I'd order that one again! \\n\\nOne of my friends had gotten the sauerkraut balls. Wow! It was honestly, super tasty and flavorful. There was sausage in it which may've brought out the flavor.

We started with some Thai ice tea which was delicious and an order of the Tod Mun (deep fried fish cakes with a dipping sauce). The Tod Mun was good - not phenomenal or anything - but I enjoyed it. For entrees I got the Pud Thai and my boyfriend got the Thai Passion Curry (yellow curry). The yellow curry was your average tasty hearty curry, but the Pud Thai was a little lacking in flavor. After dumping the entire sauce from the appetizer on the noodles though it was quite good. The portions were also enormous. Both my boyfriend and I had left overs for the next day!\\n\\nThe service was phenomenal in that it was perfectly how service should always be (and rarely is). We were seated within a couple minutes of arriving, the waitress took our order within the next 5 minutes, our ice tea showed up 2-3 minutes later, then our appetizer 10 minutes later and then our entrees 10 minutes after that. After we were clearly done eating our waitress brought to-go boxes and brought out the check just a couple minutes later. Our water glasses never even hit the midway mark and she was patient with our indecision when we were first ordering. I was impressed because other than the hostess, she seemed to be the only waitress there and there were at least 4 other groups there.\\n\\nI would come back more often if this were closer to where my boyfriend lives and if there were another groupon.

I saw an article about them reaching that milestone and realized that I had never written about our visit there. We had a fun night here. If you go into this experience expecting highbrow humor and sophisticated dining you are going to end up sitting there with your arms folded with a frown on your face. If you go in knowing that you're going to be eating fried chicken and listening to groan-inducing gags then you'll have a great time (at least we did). You'll find this show in Pioneer Hall deep inside of Fort Wilderness. It's very important to note that you cannot drive to this show. If you're driving you have to park at the main entrance to Fort Wilderness and then take a bus there. It goes without saying that you should allow yourself plenty of time to get there before the show starts. If you get there really early you can walk over to the stables nearby and look at the horses. There was a big line to stand in to get inside Pioneer Hall, but it was organized pretty well and wasn't a big hassle. We got our picture taken before we went in and I couldn't resist buying some copies. Just by pure dumb luck we ended up at the best seat in the house. We were sitting at a table upstairs looking down at the stage. It was impossible for anyone to get in our way and block our view of the stage. I felt bad for the people that were upstairs along the left or right side. Their backs were to the performance so they had to eat a little bit, turn around and look at the show, and then turn around and eat over and over again. I thought the food was good, but nothing earth shattering. I did like everything I had except for the dessert. I don't like strawberries so strawberry shortcake isn't going to do it for me. While you're eating the performers will be working hard to entertain you. I like that they've maintained this show instead of trying to change it for modern audiences. I doubt any kids are going to know who Davy Crockett is. The entertainers in our show put a lot of energy into their performances. There is a lot of audience participation and by the end of the night you will be strumming a washboard along with the performers. When is the last time you've done that when you're eating dinner? After the show was over we walked down to the dock and took a relaxing boat ride. It was a fun way to cap off an enjoyable night.

It didn't feel like much had changed in ambiance -- when it's busy, it's noisy and feels crowded. There's basically no chance for a \\"quiet\\" afternoon tea. You want to try elsewhere if that is important to you. Also, if you want to really take your time beyond the 1-1/2 hour seatings during their peak periods, go later. A 3 PM or later reservation should be fine and it's unlikely that there'll be anyone waiting for your table.\\n\\nAlthough our party mostly went with the High Tea (using 2-for-1 coupons in the Entertainment Book), I opted for the regular menu this time around, just to see what they had.\\n\\nIndividual red wine braised onion tart ($13) Topped with ch√®vre, roasted mushrooms, and candied walnuts. Served hot with a side salad\\n- Pet peeve time: This was on the online menu, but not in the paper menu at the restaurant. Can they not update the online menus at the same time? This isn't a complaint specific to Neverland -- quite a few restaurants aren't conscientious about this.\\n\\nMushroom & Brie Gratin ($12) Radiatore pasta with mellow onion and brie sauce, served over roasted mushrooms, topped with gruy√®re cheese and persillade bread crumbs (gluten and dairy omitted available).\\n- During our particular visit, they were sold out of the \\"normal\\" pasta (non-gluten-free) so they had to make mine gluten-free. But it was completely fine and nothing odd stood out about it.\\n- Their menu calls it \\"Neverland's own mac 'n cheese\\", which is an okay enough description since those are the primary ingredients, but if you are hoping for a mac 'n cheese, it's just not the same thing. It's quite dry and has no creaminess at all.\\n- Fairly tasty, but portion (maybe 1-1/2 cups worth) felt small for $12 and no side. This is more like a big appetizer unless you have a small appetite.\\n\\nVegan Sandwich ($11) with Kale Caesar (+$2 substitution)\\n- Basically a single sandwich using two slices of regulation sized bread.\\n- Price for portion is sort of okay if you allow that they are pricing it like a gourmet burger.\\n- Taste is pretty good.\\n- Salad was heavy on dressing, so you may want to see if you can get that on the side if you don't like too much dressing.\\n- Passable as a light lunch so if you're not a dainty eater (which, to be honest, is likely their clientele) you'll probably end up ordering something else.\\n\\nHot Choco-tea ($4)\\n- Half hot chocolate, half tea of your choice. I went with the recommended Mumbai Chai.\\nComes out sort of like a London Fog and tastes just as weak.\\n- Neither a hot chocolate nor a tea, but an odd mix of both. If you are hoping for a thick or strong hot chocolate, this won't be it as the hot chocolate is obviously thinned by the tea.\\n- Make sure you get a strong tea to compete with the hot chocolate.\\n- $4 gets you approximately a Starbucks Grande size portion (16 oz).\\n\\nService felt pretty short-handed when their dining room was full -- another reason to try a later seating if you can.\\nPretty easy to go gluten-free and even dairy-free here, and many counter items (like their assortment of brownies) are standard with either or both attributes -- bonus point for this."},{"name":"Via Napoli","address":"EPCOT World Showcase - Italian Pavilion, 1510 Avenue of the Stars","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"We stopped in here after visiting the food and wine festival.

I probably will eventually, on my way home from work one night but it's not going to be a happy visit and I won't spend more than the bare minimum, no impulse cookie buys!.\\n\\nI can only write my review based on the morning visits I've made here, on my way out to work. I really like their online ordering app, I could easily place my morning meeting order, pick it up and be on my way in less than 5 minutes. At least I could until I started coming here instead of my prior Panera haunts.\\n\\nFirst visit- the two people behind the counter - they seem to be there every day early morning - found it inexplicably difficult to end their personal conversation to wait on the person in front of me. While we waited for them, six people piled up behind me, at least three of who seemed to be familiar with the two counter people, if the comments that I overheard about them were any indication. That was a 15 minute trek that should have been a five minute order.\\n\\nSecond visit- I placed the order online. When I went to pick up the order, instead of one bag with my order in it, there was a bag, a smaller bag and a small pastry box. I think seeing all that made me check the order, which I never do. The sandwich was correct, there was a chocolate chip cookie, no chocolate chip muffie, no brownie and there was one blueberry muffin instead of two. When I brought it to their unwilling attention, I got a mutual eye roll and was told, \\"well, there's no brownie because we're out of them!\\"  Uh huh. So, the phone number in the order is meaningless? You couldn't call me to tell me that and make a replacement? So, instead you just charged me for what I ordered but gave me what you had on hand, a stale cookie instead of a brownie?? Then he had the gall to tell me, with a big smile, to \\"keep the cookie, no charge!\\" No charge? I paid for a brownie, not a cookie and the cc muffies that I ordered & paid for are sitting right there in the case, not in my bag as I ordered. Tried twice to reason with him, pointless to argue.\\n\\nThird visit, yesterday morning - I walked out the door, forgetting to place the order beforehand and cursed myself repeatedly! Once inside, there were two people in line, one girl desperately trying to put an order together and about 4 people wandering about fairly aimlesslyand making no eye contact, including the two who are usually there. By the time there were about 8 of us in line, the manager came out, chastised the poor girl for not calling her for help, but said nothing to the others. To her slight credit, the manager did immediately walk behind a register and started the line moving. The girl moved to the register and the zombies? they kept on wandering back & forth, avoiding eye contact.\\n\\nCome on!! Are you telling me this is the best you can staff your store with?? Really??? A large chain has one way to stand out and it's the level of customer service they provide, which these employees completely lack. \\n\\nI formerly spent about $100/week at Panera between personal and office purchases. The $15 I spent at Derby Street the other day is going to be it for me for a while. Maybe I'll try the Shipyard, but I'm not expecting much better service as I'm told they're part of the same franchise group. I'd rather stop at Whole Foods and pick up treats.

Scoring an ADR for dinner at BOG is a bit of a challenge, so if you are not able to do so breakfast and lunch are a great option. In my opinion, this is the only restaurant in all WDW that is a meal and an attraction all in one. You are fully immersed in Beats's castle. If you grew up loving everything about Belle & Beast, this is a must score ADR. The only way to tour the castle and various dining rooms - West wing room, the ballroom, and the library (point of fact, that is my order of preference) - is by having a dining reservation.   \\n\\nI have had the fortune of having all three meals at BOG and all have been good, with Dinner being the best of all. Breakfast can be a bit pricey, but all the food is very hearty so you will easily be able to have a very light lunch or an early dinner. I had the quiche and was quite pleased with the flaky pastry and rich filling. There is a complimentary bread basket that comes with a delightful selection of mini muffins and pastries. If you are not a big breakfast eater, you will be able to share a plate and round it out with the basket and a beverage. \\n\\nI have one tip for both lunch and dinner - Get the French onion soup! If you are on the DDP, the soup can be substituted for dessert or treated as a snack credit. I have never had a better french onion soup. It has a thick layer of perfectly melted cheese covering a full- flavored onion soup broth. I pair this with the carved turkey sandwich and I am in soup and sandwich heaven! I fully recommend getting your own soup and splitting a sandwich between two people as the sandwich is a very hearty portion. The sandwich is composed of a white baguette stuffed with moist turkey breast meat, greens, tomatoes and a garlic herb mayo. I ask for everything on the side and share the turkey sandwich with my son as I have actually had difficulty with him enjoying different foods on the kids menu. My DH enjoys the steak sandwich. \\n\\nDinner is by far the best experience at BOG. Not only is the meal table service, but each guest will have an opportunity to meet Beast and have your picture taken with him (Belle makes her appearances at Akershus in Epcot). Additionally, this is the only place and dining time in MK that offers alcoholic beverages. BOG has a very nice selection of wines that accompany the menu to perfection. Once again, the onion soup is tres magnifique! Another favorite appetizer is the mussels. The broth is flavorful and well-balanced and the mussels are always of high quality. All meals are very hearty and easily be shared by two less hungry adults or an adult and child. The braised pork, also on the lunch menu, is rich and delicious. The accompanying buttery mashed potatoes make it a wonderful comfort food meal. \\n\\nDessert - I am a big fan of the grey stuff, but must stay that all of the cupcakes are moist and flavorful. It's like asking me to pick a favorite child.... I refuse to do it. It just depends what mood I am in. \\n\\nTake the plunge, make the ADR, forget the wallet for one meal.

This morning my girlfriend called me from Reading and said she was going to stop there to pick up lunch and was going to try to go through the drive thru.  She called me back 50 minutes later in tears and told me that after waiting for 50 minutes in line to get to the drive thru window, that the person told her she had missed the speaker that was there to order and refused to allow her to place an order at the window.  She knew she made a mistake, but was in disbelief that they refused to even go grab her two bagels.  I understand how busy this place is, but the fact that they could not take an extra minute to go grab two bagels after she had waited in the drive thru for nearly an hour is absolutely ridiculous.  At the very least they could have asked her to pull to the side while they grabbed the food.  The last thing the person said to her after her seeing her upset over the issue was \\"I'm sorry but it's your fault\\".  I know it will mean little to this establishment since they are constantly packed, but they lost two frequent customers and managed to flip our opinion from very positive to negative with one event.

What a dream. Truly a culinary experience to behold. Nestled in the St. Regis sits this absolutely dazzling restaurant. When you walk in the host kindly greet you ask you can't help but look around at all the art. There are works from Monet and Picasso hanging on the walls making the atmosphere of the restaurant one of the most unique and impact full that I have had the pleasure of experiencing. On Fridays they have a live band play all night and they are just delightful. The music makes the room warm and played at just the right volume so you can still talk. Youll find that a lot at Atlas, that everything is done just right. \\n\\nWe started with the tomato soup (it comes with a miniature grilled cheese). The server delved into an extremely entertaining story about how the soup ended up on the menu, so we got 4. It was delicious to say the least. I would do the dish injustice if I were to try and describe it like our wonderful server. Next we wanted to try the Perogi with wagyu beef but some of my family are vegetarian, so they brought out one normal perogi with wagyu and one perogi with mushroom as a replacement. They were both smashing dishes. \\n\\nFor the main course I Wolfed down the burger. A double patty burger made from 28 day dry aged wagyu beef. Who wouldn't order that? It was unlike any burger I have had before, and should be on every burger aficionados list. My cousin got the rack of lamb. It ended up being two very thick ribs, but they were to die for and he had to stop me from eating his whole plate. The two fish dishes that were ordered I'm ashamed to say I forgot what they were, but they melted in your mouth. One was woody, nutty with a lemon finish and the other was sweeter and oaky. I ate a good portion of all the dishes and I have to say you can't go wrong with anything on that menu. \\n\\nAfter dinner we had to tried the cacao pod dessert after hearing the story of why it is on the menu. I implore you to ask the story but either way you should 100% order the cacao pod. From story to presentation to flavor that dish is a 11/10. The staff later comes around with a tray of an assortment of 5 after dinner chocolates. We were informed that One family once asked them to leave the tray of chocolates at the table, and the family ate all 30 of them. Try one and you'll probably do the same. \\n\\nId like to also quickly touch on service. This is the best service I have received in any establishment. Everything is precise and done in unison. They bring 5 people to the table everytime they set or clear the table, and they're so delicate that you dont even notice. But if you take the time to watch, they operate like a symphony. The restaurant had two sommeliers working that they happily paired each of our individual dishes with the perfect wine. They truly care about every single detail and will do whatever it takes to make you happy. \\nTheir service, commitment, and consistency should be a model for the entire industry.

I'm normally ok with fake meat, and have bought my fair deal of smart ground, but this stuff wasn't super appetizing.

My only problem at Take is the experience when ordering takeout - it's mediocre at the front desk. This is Service 101, Front desk people: 1) don't box the orders so high in the bag, as they're likely to tip when put in a car; 2) several times I've been waiting for the finishing of the take out order -- Napkins, soy sauce, tying up the bag, etc  -- which should be done quickly but are often neglected or done too late; 3) if I'm there, at the restaurant standing in front of you, I should be your primary concern - not taking full orders over the phone -- phone customers they can wait on hold until you've handled customers who are onsite first -- putting me on hold while standing in front of you so you can take a full order over the phone is not cool; 4) if I get a verbal \\"20 mins for pickup\\" message from you, and I come in at 25-30 mins later, I should not be waiting for anything - period (see #2 above)."},{"name":"Louie's Pizza","address":"118 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"Okay, I know I've already reviewed Louie's, but in my defense, it's been kind of a while.

Before we were married, Trudy's was one of my wife and I's favorite places to grab a bite and a drink given the 2 bars and nice outside dining area as additional options.  Fast forward and it's now the kids' favorite place to go out to eat...hands down our favorite place for Tex Mex and worth the drive from Round Rock, even with the kids.  But it still has that funky feel and still a great place to hang out with a drink outside on a nice weather evening.\\n\\nOne of the things I like the most about Trudy's is the distinctive menu.  More so than other Tex Mex joints, Trudy's has unique items on the menu and new additions every few months to keep you interested.  You can't go wrong with old favorites like the stuffed advocado, Ciro's special or the chorizo stuffed chicken, but newer items like the shrimp chipotle cream enchiladas (spicy and you can request flour instead of corn tortillas) and the tinga (smoked brisket) queso burrito are also very good.  A personal favorite of mine are the migas with hash browns, even for dinner as a nice change-up.\\n\\nLots of beers on tap, margaritas are good and although the Mexican martinis used to be better, you can still get a good version if you order it top shelf as it's mixed fresh versus the house version pre-mixed.  Chips and red/green salsa (spicy!) are always good and we always get the regular queso as well, which is also one of our favorites around town.  Queso has just the right amount of kick as even the kids love it, asking for \\"Chips and Spicy!\\" when we go.  Kids menu has plenty of choices and our kids really like the quesadillas.  Kids fit right in as well with the general volume of the place and if you go around 5:30 or earlier, you can always get seated immediately, no matter the night.\\n\\nService is normally pretty good, but there is a pretty high turn-over of servers, so you'll sometimes get someone relatively young in training.  Come back a few weeks later and that same server is much better.  Again, overall service is fine and the food normally comes pretty quickly, though we're normally not there anymore at the peak / packed hours.\\n\\nFor authentic Tex Mex, a distinctive menu, a casual hang-out and good food from a place that has been around more than 30 years, Trudy's is a great spot to go."},{"name":"Colosseum Pizza","address":"107 12th Street E","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Ordered delivery and had high hopes as the descriptions seemed fairly authentic.

Those who fear the spicy might want to get the brava on the side - it has a unique bright, heat that some might not like. Dad had the eggs with house smoked salmon.

The chicken was amazing and the broth was very tasty. I did pick out the seaweed and bamboo shoots since I am not a fan, but what a large portion it was!

The butternut squash soup was by far my favorite....I had maybe 3 bowls or so! The rice dishes were ok, and I really like curry, but I really must complain about the area that has mac n' cheese and spaghetti. I really wish that the buffet could have stayed within the African genre. I didn't try the Americanized dishes and I understand the Disney need to offer something for everyone, I just wish that people who don't want African style food (which is already heavily Americanized) would simply not go to a restaurant that doesn't offer things they are interested in........that is my only gripe.

We opted for the second one though since it was less congested. \\n\\nEach room has a large beverage station and you grab your own silverware, napkins and condiments.

Usually at any other Disney restaurant they ask you when you sit down \\"Are we celebrating anything on this trip?\\"  And generally at least do a damn good job at pretending they care.  Our waitress asked us this, but then followed up with \\"is today the specific date of these events?\\"  as if it mattered.  This trip is celebrating these events...no, it's not the \\"specific date\\", but that shouldn't matter.\\n\\nAt this particular restaurant for special occasions they bring you out a plate of what they call \\"The Grey Stuff,\\" which is a reference to the movie.  It's quite literally about 2 tablespoons of cookies and cream moose.  One of these is great for one person, but for three (or 8) it doesn't really cut it.  Our waitress brought out one plate (3 celebrations remember), lit the candle, placed it on the table and walked away.  Nothing explaining what it was, the reference to the movie, we're glad you decided to celebrate with us, nothing.  And only one of them.  She was seemingly upset that we didn't order dessert as well.\\n\\nIn fact, another waiter was taking better care of us then our waitress.  When we hadn't seen ours for a while we asked him if we could get more bread.  He came out a few minutes later just to make sure we had gotten it.  We hadn't, and he went and went back to check on it.  Wish we could have given our tip to him.\\n\\nWhen we were nearing the end of our meal, she seemed to be wanting to clear the table as soon as possible.  My niece had to as for another fork to finish her meal with because her plate got cleared before she was all the way finished.\\n\\nAll that to say, the food was excellent.  I had the Shrimp and Scallops with puff pastry and it was great.  I think it was just our sour waitress that ruined the whole experience."},{"name":"Morelli's Gourmet Ice Cream & Desserts","address":"1220 Caroline St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Two miles away from the original location, hundreds of miles away from the original in quality.  \\n\\nWe drove around the Edgewood Shopping Center for a few minutes searching for the sign, before we called and were directed to the space in between Figo and Willy's.  There's an alleyway next to the store, so you can easily park on the back side by Best Buy and walk through.\\n\\nInstead of a daily listing of flavors on the menu, the ice cream flavors here are displayed in metal bins in a glass freezer display case like a gelato shop, but are scooped from behind the counter.  Somehow, seeing the ice cream displayed made it look like they had significantly fewer flavors.  And, the flavors that they did have just didn't look all that attractive.  Where gelato is usually gussied up in a display case with seasonal berries, fresh mint, and garnishes, the ice cream here isn't and it just looks like, well, ice cream dumped in a metal tub.  They had mockups of the special sundaes created by Kevin Gillespie in the display case as well, and they just looked sad.  No way would I order one of these sorry looking creations.\\n\\nThe day I was there, they also only had two of their 'gourmet\\" flavors (salted caramel and an herb-y one I can't remember), and the rest were plain jane flavors (vanilla, strawberry, mint chocolate chip, etc).  It's already well documented on yelp that I'm cheap, so when I'm going to splurge on ice cream, I don't want it to be on the flavors that I can buy a pint of at Kroger around the corner for half the price.   I was also shocked to see bottles of Smucker's caramel and chocolate sauce on the counter.  This is where their toppings come from?!\\n\\nThe sllloooooowwww service and the annoying need to write everything down has also followed to this location.  If I'm the only one in the shop, how hard is it to remember that I want a small, half chocolate, half salted caramel, in a cone?  At the original location, this was a small annoyance I was willing to overlook.  Here, there's no reason why one of the three (!!) people behind the counter couldn't be scooping my ice cream while I paid. \\n\\nI do appreciate having a place to sit inside and enjoy my ice cream, and I like the  ice cream touches that they've added to the furniture (the banquet seating cushions look like ice cream sandwiches), but the red plastic chairs and lack of art work make the place still seem very sterile.\\n\\nOverall, this location was a disappointment from the great experiences I've had at the original location (http://www.yelp.com/biz/morellis-gourmet-ice-cream-and-desserts-atlanta#hrid:G11JqYvCTRipGCdWpWxSWg).

I had lunch there on Wednesday, November 1st with my cousin. I had never even heard of this place before she suggested eating there, which she has eaten there now for the third time. The corner it's located on is a bit tricky. If you're approaching it on West 5th, you have to be aware of the driveway entrance which is kind of odd. It is right at the light where the corner forms an \\"A\\" pointing toward the center of the intersection. So the parking lot is actually is very small with about five or six parallel parking spots and about 5 regular parking spots. Luckily I got there early and got a parallel parking spot that I could just slide into because they weren't crowded yet, but if you aren't good at parallel parking you may have to park across the street if they are crowded.\\n\\nWe got there about 11:30 a.m. and there were only a couple of other tables that were occupied, which was nice. The restaurant is clean and well lit. You order at the counter they give you a number on a holder and then go to your table and sit and they'll bring you your food. This is nice because then you don't have a bunch of people standing around at the cash register waiting to pick up their orders.\\n\\nI ordered the Brunswick stew and the cheesy potatoes. My total came to $9.98. I just got ice water to drink. They do have soft drinks, but they are seltzer water and syrup generic soft drinks, they are not brand name. So if you are a Pepsi lover or a Coke lover, they don't have those. It's like the home machines you can buy and do your own pop so there are options like Cola and root beer and a couple of other non-name brand flavors. They also do have lemonade and tea, and it appears that they serve wine. I am not sure if they serve beer as well.\\n\\nThe Brunswick Stew which came with a toasted slice of I believe French bread, and it was excellent, as were the cheesy potatoes. The only couple things that I would mention are that the portions are fairly small. I would say that the soup was approximately an 8 oz cup of soup and the cheesy potatoes would fill less than an 8 oz cup. For the price, I would expect a little bit bigger portions than that. Additionally, they may have had salt and pepper at the counter, but I didn't see any and there was none on the table. You may have to ask for these, but I really didn't feel like getting up and going back up to the counter because it was fine without more salt on the potatoes even though I would have preferred to have a little bit more of a taste to them.\\n\\nMy cousin got her usual, which was the cornbread and pulled pork, which basically comes mixed together, you don't get a slice of cornbread it's crumbled into the dish. It looked very good and she said that that's what she gets when she goes there every time.\\n\\nThey do get incredibly crowded around noon, as the place ended up being packed. However seating was very compact. The inside is fairly large but there are many small, two-people tables, that people have to slide together if there's a party larger than 2, and they have put as many of those in their establishment as they can so you are sitting really close to one another whether you know the other people or not. We chose to sit at one of the higher top tables and that was much more roomy and away from people than the standard tables, but they seem to draw a really large crowd so this is probably not a major issue for people, especially who are stopping in for lunch from work.\\n\\nThe staff is very nice and very knowledgeable about their menu. The gentleman who brought us our food even came back and took our dishes away when we were done, as we there for a couple hours just talking. \\n\\nI would highly recommend trying the Sweet Carrot if you have never been there before. Make sure you go early to avoid the lunch rush as well as be able to get a parking spot."},{"name":"Smokebelly BBQ","address":"128 E Andrews Dr NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Love it here!!

I would love to return with 1-3 other people.\\n\\nWe arrived a bit early, so the hostess guided us to an outdoor table and gave us some drink menus.  There were some great-sounding cocktails... but before we could order, we learned that our table was ready!  I was glad - although the outdoor seating area was super cute, someone was smoking.\\n\\nWe ordered carafes of apple fennel punch (\\"rye whiskey, stone's ginger wine, apple liqueur, bergamot tea, lemon, fennel syrup, apple bitters\\") and winter sangria (which is not on the online menu anymore but contained red wine, citrusy flavors, cinnamon, and I forget what else).  I enjoyed both of these.  The apple fennel punch was tasty and potent.  We were given glasses containing a giant ice cube with what I'm assuming was dried fennel sprinkled on top.  The winter sangria was also very good.  I thought I would find the cinnamon a bit overwhelming, but ended up liking it a lot.\\n\\nWe tried the following dishes:\\n\\n- Muhummara (\\"red pepper, walnut, pomegranate, house made pita\\") - savory roasted red pepper spread, mmm.  The pita was nice and soft and very addictive.

The flavor of the fennel was not very strong, which was a bit disappointing.  There were dried orange slices on top too.  Beautiful and tasty.\\n- Fried goat cheese (\\"red onion jam, TX honey\\") - balls of goat cheese, battered and fried, with some great whole grain crackers on the side.\\n- Ratatouille tart (\\"tomato, eggplant, peppers, herbs de provence, arugula, nicoise olives\\") - yum.  A buttery, flaky pastry crust containing thinly sliced roasted vegetables, topped with raw arugula leaves and a few nicoise olives.\\n- Butternut squash manti (\\"stuffed pasta, pistachio, pomegranate seeds, yogurt, brown butter, sage\\") - ooh, these were tasty little pasta pillows filled with butternut squash.  Loved the flavor.\\n- Quail a la mancha (\\"anson mills grits, manchego cheese, pimento honey\\") - I only got a tiny bite of quail, so I can't say much about this other than the quail was very tender and flavorful.\\n- Market vegetable paella (\\"catalan sofrito, shishito peppers, aioli\\") - This was flavorful, hearty, and filling (er, it would be, if I had been able to eat 1/4 to 1/3 of it...).

It is a newer concept restaurant at Walt Disney World, so they are still experimenting with what works and what doesn't. If you keep that in mind, you'll have a good experience.\\n\\nI was sent an email about a month before my trip saying they wanted to see if I would participate in a dining experience concept.

Okay, no big deal since I wanted to check out the restaurant.\\n\\nWe arrived at our pre-determined time, at were directed to the Castle door. Once inside, you get a taste of the lobby area. Instead of going to the right and picking our meal off the menu, we were directed to find a seat in any of the three dining rooms.\\n\\nThe first dining room in which you enter, is the main ballroom. It's two stories tall! It was decked out for the holidays, so it really looked nice. It was busy and loud, but what I wanted to check out was the West Wing. Dark and foreboding, it was a perfect setting. Obviously there are a lot of twisted people out there, because this was a popular dining room. There wasn't a table to be had. But at least I was able to check out the room.\\n\\nSo we headed to the third dining room, which is the Rose Gallery. The focal point of this dining room is a giant Belle and Beast music box. Tapestries of different characters decorated the walls of this room. They only sell one of them, but I wish they would sell some of the others. \\n\\nAs for the food, I would have to say I have found a new Magic Kingdom favorite. The food was really good. I had potato leek soup for a starter and braised pork (Coq Au Vin style), and it was a fantastic value for the price.

You were warned!\\n\\nNormally I wouldn't disclose some of the magic, but in today's world, especially on Yelp, people want to know it all. So here it goes.\\n\\nThey used to, and may still at dinner, give you a rose after you've ordered. Since we ordered online, they just told us to sit wherever we wanted to sit. So we did, but no one came by. You do get your drinks yourself, so when I went to get a drink, I asked a Cast Member if I needed to notify anyone, and she just smiled and said, \\"No. We'll be with you shortly.\\" I tried not reading a lot of reviews before attending, and that reminded me that, just like Santa, they know.\\n\\nSure enough, a few minutes later, our meals appeared and they knew what each person had ordered. Amazing! A Cast Members pushes your food out on a cart like in the movie. Hidden just so only the Cast Member can see it is something like a mobile device that shows the table and where each person is sitting, including what they ordered. Okay, that makes sense, but then how do they know where each person is sitting? Ah! Our MagicBands! That new device that does everything from unlocking your hotel door to storing your Park passes even keeps track of your meals. I know some people find the technology creepy, but I find it fascinating. \\n\\nSo there's one secret. The other? Well, when I was in Chicago in October and went to the Disney Store on Michigan Avenue, I was speaking to a Cast Member and we were talking about the Grey Stuff dessert. It really is grey. Look at the picture I posted (as well as many other people). He said as part of a Cast Member trip to FL, he found out how they make this tasty dessert. He asked me, which was nice instead of just spoiling it for me, \\"Do you want to know?\\" I said, \\"Sure. Because if I can't figure it out, it will bother me until I find out.\\"  The answer: they take Oreo cookies and mash them up, whipping them up into a mousse. Really! As soon as I tasted it, I could place the taste. And if you think about it, mashing up the dark cookie blending it with the cream filling, it would turn out grey.\\n\\nThere you have it. What an entertaining meal! How could anyone be gloomy and depressed?"},{"name":"Erin McKenna's Bakery NYC","address":"1642 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"EVERYTHING good in Epcot Center has gluten.  Everything.  After touring the World Showcase and not being able to eat beignets, napoleons, funnel cake, pizza, fish n' chips, and all of the items that make one's mouth water, we finally happened upon Erin McKenna's Bakery, in Disney Springs.  I could eat anything in that store!  Anything I wanted!  Most of their baked goods are made with Bob's Red Mill products.\\n\\nWill your average, Gluten-full eater enjoy this bakery?  Probably not.  Of the three items we purchased, all of them were on the dry side.\\n\\nWhy the five-star rating?  Not only was the Epcot experience a hard one for me (the not-so-proud owner of a late-onset gluten sensitivity), I had been craving a doughnut for literally the past 4 months.  Additionally, I've tried gluten-free baking myself.  It is an involved, frustrating, process that - in my case - has yet to yield a positive result.\\n\\nAdmittedly, the doughnut from Erin's needed that icing on the top to save it from being too dry to swallow, but I ate the whole thing.

As it was an early supper on a Tuesday, we were the only couple in the restaurant for probably the first forty-five minutes of our meal. As a result of this, and that our server was training another server, we had what I'd describe as an exaggerated service experience. We were doted upon, but not always in an elegant or necessarily welcome fashion. Our server was very interested in hitting all his marks, as if by checklist, for the benefit of his trainee. Had the room been fuller, the performance, we expect, would have been more low-key. The room itself was modern, featuring dark, angular, and masculine accents. Getting cozy was difficult considering that we sat side by side and service was over the left shoulder - creating a sort of chaperone-y effect. We like our cozy.\\n\\nThe food was intensely good. Following the fresh and sponge-y herbed focaccia and olive oil, we started with \\"tastes\\" of chickpea fritter with date compote followed by the little cup of roasted, salted golden beets. The fritter was an especially nice start with a ton of exotic flavor, while the beets were, well... beets. We didn't feel compelled to finish the dish. For \\"starters\\" we ordered the green salad as well as the salame with cracked green olives, shaved fennel, olive oil and pecorino. The salame wasn't salami; we're not sure why (although an explanation was offered - we probably just weren't paying attention), but we were offered shaved, cured pork loin which practically melted in our mouths. The green salad, believe it or not, contained sliced potatoes and sliced bacon. Now how are we ever going to be able to go back to eating salads without potatoes and bacon? Both starters were simply terrific. For entrees, we deeply felt the braise and so opted for the braised beef dish with polenta and the braised duck dish with garganelli. Would you believe that each dish was perfect? Believe it. Tender, succulent, generously-portioned... and the dried cherries among the duck made for a surprising and fun complement to the Burgess Cabernet. Dessert consisted of a flawless warm toffee pudding and a better-in-conception-than-execution brioche doughnut with cinnamon/pear compote.\\n\\nOverall, this was a terrific experience.

(Oh Mon Dieu!) I simply adore this place.\\n\\nYvette and I were 4 for 4 on consecutive weekend hangouts, so we were aiming for five. It began as a casual suggestion during a spirited driving game at Pinballz that we do lunch at Chez Nous soon. Yvette had ranked their escargot above Justine's, so we both felt I needed to have my say in the matter. Eventually, the suggestion morphed into an intense craving for it on our parts, and after a flurry of scheduling conflicts and flaky babysitters, her husband Jason eventually stepped in to watch their adorable little boy so we could have some quality face time on a Friday night. \\n\\nWe met around 6:30. Yvette arrived just minutes before me, and had wisely snagged a cute table for two by the window overlooking the outside. Before the first course came out, it was apparent this cute, intimate little place fills up quickly.\\n\\nI had been here before 11 years ago. For my prom. I recognized the mural on the far wall immediately, as that's where our group sat. Ha, prom. I don't remember much, but I remember the restaurant and I'm confident my date knew I was a homo even though I made no grand declaration. Once or twice I glanced over at that same spot and tried to imagine the teenager who was sitting over there so long ago, in his all-black Perry Ellis tuxedo and square toed shoes, completely un-jaded by the world. And then Yvette would say something hilarious and I'd be snapped back to my reality of being jaded and bitchy, but totally fabulous. Ah, c'est la vie. \\n\\nYvette started off by ordering both of us a glass of a robust red malbec wine. A glass? I arched my eyebrow as if to silently ask \\"Who do you think you're kidding?\\", and she immediately laughed and changed it to a bottle. I mean come on, honey...\\n\\nWe began with an order of a dozen Escargots de Bourgogne, served with button mushrooms and swimming in melted butter, garlic cloves, and parsley. They came in a single serving dish, unlike Justine's which has a special escargot platter. Yvette said the best way to eat them was to have a bite of snail and mushroom together, and she was right. The escargot were meatier and the sauce more delectable than Justine's. In fact, not a drop of sauce was left after we'd sopped it up with our bread. Delicious. \\n\\nWe both adored the prix fixe menu, where for $27.50 you get an appetizer, entree, and a dessert. I ordered the pate maison (I chose duck liver mousse) and veal dumplings; Yvette opted for salad Lyonnaise and the rainbow trout. Dessert we'd choose later.\\n\\nOver the incredibly rich and flavorful pate and what looked to be a delicious appetizer salad, we talked food, friends, and came to know each other better in a nice, quiet atmosphere like Chez Nous without the rigmarole of parties or Katy Perry concerts. She's really a very beautiful person; all our mutual friends had already told me so, it was just nice to discover it myself over this last month. And I liked being around someone who's on the same page with me, knowing full well that the amount of wine in the bottle and dirty talk will always be inversely proportional, no matter where we happen to be. \\n\\nEntrees: The veal dumplings were more accurately described as round veal sausages in a wine sauce surrounding a puff pastry in the middle. The presentation wasn't too pretty, but the taste was OK. I'll be honest: Yvette and I both agreed this particular preparation was a little odd, as a veal cutlet would have been much more appropriate. Her trout, on the other hand, was one hell of a piece of fish. With the accompanying sauce, it was a simple, yet delightfully fresh dish. I posted her entree on my mobile upload because it was so pretty, and she immediately commented \\"You know you like eating my trout.\\" Ha! I really should have ordered the fish. (N.B. the sides of grilled vegetables really helped cut the richness of all the food by offering me another food group.)\\n\\nI was all set to have the chocolate mousse when the waiter informed  us of two dessert specials: a \\"three islands\\" meringue, or peach melba. Having *just* seen Anthony Bourdain rave about seeing such an old-school dish like peach melba on a menu in NYC, I didn't hesitate to order it. Yvette had the meringue. Both were sweet, yet light--perfect summertime desserts. My peach was a little hard to cut with the spoon, but it blended beautifully with the creamy vanilla ice cream. We'd been chatting non-stop since I arrived, but when the only sound at our table was of our spoons clanging against the dishes, Yvette couldn't help but state: \\"Well, looks like dessert finally shut us up.\\" We died laughing.\\n\\nThis was one of the best, most well-rounded meals I have had in a while. It was in a restaurant that effortlessly balances true elegance with Austin-style casualness. Actually, come to think of it...the restaurant mirrors my friend Yvette perfectly. 100 stars for the company, to be sure.\\n\\nAnd 5 Stars for Chez Nous."},{"name":"Mikado Sushi","address":"6417 Raleigh St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a small neighborhood place that has delicious japanese food.

We were then asked if we were doing a dining plan or not, and shuffled back to an ordering screen with zero instructions on what we were supposed to do. No keyboard, and touching the screen did nothing. We asked the guy who was sitting there who had previously been helping someone else and he actually was supposed to take our order - and did but it was still super confusing. We felt pressured to hurry along and make our orders as well. \\n\\nSo, I ended up ordering the Tuna Salad. We also ordered the Braised Pork, and two French Onion Soups. We were ushered off to get our drinks. What a mess. Ice and water everywhere - both counters were totally destroyed and looked gross. Upon trying to get ice at one machine, I discovered they were out. The other ice machine was shooting out ice all over the place which explained the water and ice mess. Silverware was tucked away off to the side and hard to see. Once we did that, we sat down in the main room. \\n\\nSitting there looking at the main room, with its lovely candleabras, high ceilings and big windows with mountains and a snowy scene was the best part of the meal that day. We also peeked into the other two rooms which were also pretty cool looking.\\n\\n We actually waited quite a while for our food. When it came out, via one of those silly cart looking things, I was actually really disappointed with my tuna salad. Because I had been rushed in my order, I did not realize it was not actually a tuna salad salad, but basically raw tuna steak placed on a bed of greens. That really sucked because I don't eat raw fish. The waitress saw my face and asked me if I knew it came that way and when I said no, she made no effort to ask me if I wanted something else or not - and then she was gone. Luckily I was able to share some of the Braised Pork with my Mother-In-Law and my husband was ok with the tuna. The food was alright, but not remarkable considering the price. \\n\\nThis was just an ok experience and I think now that we've done it once we are very unlikely to return."},{"name":"Oddfish","address":"1889 W 1st Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Well prepared food in perfect atmosphere.

My drink -- a \\"new old fashioned \\"-- was good though a smudge pricey at $10. The server, Jacqueline, was very friendly and accommodating.

We kindly asked for eggs with runny yolks and our server quickly had it rectified. But it was still on point. For lunch it was very crowded compared to the breakfast but still an enjoyable ambiance. The roast beef sandwich and braised pork were perfection. We also redeemed a snack for the French onion soup which was a must. Dessert was the Gray Stuff cupcake & eclair and both did not disappoint.

The busboy was also quite slow and we did not get water or bread until 15 minutes after being seated (a few minutes after being acknowledged by our waiter). We ordered the Menu du Jour, as we figured given the place was very busy, the orders would come out fairly quickly if we ordered from that selection.  In addition, I got a glass of wine and escargot, while my husband got water as they did not have iced tea or soda (he doesn't drink).\\n\\nThe escargot was delicious.  I flagged down the waiter for a second glass of wine.  After another half hour (we had now been seated for an hour), we noticed that tables who were seated after us were getting their main course.  Our waiter had disappeared and we had to get another staff person to take care of us.  Since we had plans at 9:30, we didn't want to place our order again and did not want to have to wolf down our salad, main course and dessert in 20 minutes, so we asked for our check.  They did give my husband the onion soup and me the salad comped, as aside from the small escargot and the bread, we had nothing else to eat and the point of going there was dinner.  The salad and soup were tasty, as much as we could enjoy it as we were now in a hurry.\\n\\nWe had to pay for two glasses of wine and the escargot and were given a $10 certificate for the next visit which considering they completely screwed our special dinner was more of a slap in the face.

You'd never expect that amount for any restaurant near there and I think that's what has people freaking out. In comparison, if we had had the same dinner at another Brazilian steakhouse, the price would have easily exceeded $140.\\n\\nFor the people who were complaining that they never got some of the meat on the menu.... all we had to do was ask for it and it was delivered to our table within a few minutes. My wife loves lamb and she had plenty of it. I love filets and had several types of filet beef. All the meat was either awesome or very good. My wife likes her beef more rare than what they gave her until she realized you could just ask them to cut deeper into the meat on the skewer to get to the rarer stuff than what was on the outside (medium).

No one's smiling or even pretending to be having a great day here. \\n\\nThey have so much to choose from that my family seemed to enjoy. My fianc√© and I are vegan so we always have to request a few items to be made vegan by the chef. Our last visit was 2 weeks ago, and our waitress was very un-attentive. There was not many people here eating this morning but she seem to always disappear when my family and I needed something. The chef who came out to take my fianc√© and I order was very kind and sweet. He brought us potatoes, vegan Mickey waffles, soymilk, earth balance butter, tofu scramble and asparagus. All very fresh and good. It took longer for our food to come out as my family who ate at the actual buffet had already finished their food, but this was fine because our food was hot and fresh so it didn't really bother me too much. \\n\\nThe waitress on the other hand, never came back to refill any of the Jungle juice or water. The times that she did stop by she would ask a simple question and walk off before any one could express any concerns. We were a party of 6, so the tip was automatically added to the check so that was nothing for her to worry about and I wonder if that is why she was acting this way? After looking at the expensive bill and the tip she would receive for doing absolutely nothing, my fianc√© immediately went to go talk to a manager about this as I did not feel comfortable tipping the worse waitress ever over $30.  Not to mention it's a buffet, what did she really do?\\n\\nWe usually eat breakfast here at least once during our mini Disney getaways but Needless to say, I think that we are going to give Boma a break for a while.

I set out to get food at Ah Fong Chinese restaurant, and it was a good decision. We ate so much that I'm pretty sure my stomach was full the next day. She is sitting there on the bed right now, laughing at me as I'm dictating this. But in fact the the case remains that there was a shit-ton of food, it was delicious, served hot, and served to the specifications that we ordered it in. Yet there she is, still looking at me like \\"you, crazy man.\\"\\n\\nSo yes we got the beef fried rice, chicken fried rice, Shezuan(?) beef, broccoli beef, and hot and sour soup. She also got an order of crab puffs which I thought were fortune cookies when they came, which was really funny because in fact there were no fortune cookies in the order. Even though they were given to us in a big box labeled \\"Chinese fortune cookies, box of 350\\".\\n\\nHow ironic.\\n\\nWhen I called for the pickup order I asked for the food to be extra spicy. I actually told the woman on the other end of the phone that if I was crying and there were tears streaming down my cheeks I would be a happy man. They did this, even for items that were normally supposed to be spicy such as my broccoli beef. I'm very pleased with this.\\n\\nAltogether, this massive amount of food cost is a whopping $42.00, which is absolutely acceptable for the massive amount of food that we got. We got so much food in fact, that my beagle ate the pizza from two days ago, because neither of us wanted it and he figured out how to jump up onto the counter, again... Delicious food, piping hot, close, reasonably priced, and generally superior to anything else in the immediate vicinity. Not to mention, they have a funny name which makes me laugh.

The wood-burning ovens give the pizza crust a nice texture and taste with just the right level of blistering.

I have heard of its links to Frank's noodle truck downtown and Duh Ku Bee; though I have not tried the former, I did go to the latter multiple times and enjoyed it, so I had some high expectations coming in.\\n\\nUnlike a number of other Chinese restaurants in the area, the interior of this place was - how do I put it - clean and, well, modern? Maybe it's just because it's new (for this location). Service was good - courteous and prompt.\\n\\nI ordered a lunch portion \\"handmade noodles with pork belly\\" for $7.95. The noodles arrived piping hot in about 5 minutes, along with two little plates of banchan (which was confusing at first but then I remembered the link to Duh Ku Bee) of cabbage and daikon kimchi.\\n\\nThe banchan was just OK; very similar to Duh Ku Bee's banchan, which I never really cared for either. The noodles, however, were pretty good: they had a very good bite and a good sear (good wok hei, I suppose); pork belly was crispy and tender (could use a few more pieces), and the vegetables all had good caramelization, so from a technique perspective, no complaints. The seasoning could have been a bit stronger, though - I would have preferred a bit spicier, but that's just my personal taste. How does it compare to Duh Ku Bee? I feel like they are pretty close, though I think Duh Ku Bee may be just ever slightly better, but, to me, it's not better enough to justify the distance from me and the wait.\\n\\nOverall, I thought the food was pretty good, the pricing was very fair for the portion size, and the service was perfectly adequate. I would certainly be back when I'm in the mood for noodles again!\\n\\nEdit: I'm revising this review after a second visit with my parents for dinner. I reduced the review from 4-stars to 3-stars.\\n\\nWe ordered three dishes:\\n- Stir-fried hand-pulled noodles with pork belly: you'd expect that, if you pay dinner prices, you get dinner portion, right? Wrong. Same portion size as lunch for 25% higher price. Why do I come for dinner then? Tastes the same as always at least, which is good.\\n- Lanzhou-style hand-pulled noodles in beef broth: managed to achieve the standard of \\"one red (chili oil), two white (noodles), three clear (broth), four green (cilantro)\\" of Lanzhou-style beef noodle soup, but boy the noodles were thick! Either they were going for the thick noodle style, or they don't know how to make it thinner. The noodles couldn't soak up the broth because of their thickness and were therefore too bland - not a good combination in my opinion. (Disclaimer: we are not from Lanzhou originally, so this could be authentic, but we are just too used to the much thinner hand-pulled noodles in the supposed \\"Lanzhou-style\\" noodle houses in my old hometown in China. I spoke to the waitstaff at Frank's, and they claim to be from Lanzhou, and I couldn't say if that's true or not.)\\n- Zhajiangmian/jjajangmyeon: a cross between the Korean and Chinese versions? Noodles had good chew, but boy it was greasy - there was literally a pool of grease at the bottom of the dish when we finished eating it. Thank god for the cucumbers it came with.\\n\\nOverall impression from the second time: food is still good, but stick to the stir-fried hand-pulled noodles, and stick to just lunch."},{"name":"Piglet Pint & Pastry","address":"17750 Pilkington Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"Now that is has finally broken 80 degrees, we decided to forgo cooking and dine outdoors.

The second time around I had a pizza sub, which ended up being almost perfect. There was cheese and sauce everywhere, the pepperoni was perfectly distributed amongst the sub, and the bun was mm-mm-toasty. Unless you're on a strict diet, it would be hard for you to not find something you'd like on the expansive menu here at Johnny B's.

I know, poor form, but I only had exact change and didn't want to break a $20 just to tip; I resolved to tip double with the next drink.  But the bartender was having none of this.  She said, \\"Excuuuse me, you didn't leave a tip.\\"  I stuck to my guns, while noting that I would get her next drink, because after all, a tip is technically an optional token of appreciation and not to be demanded by the waitstaff after every serving.

You're not getting served.  Nobody serve this asshole for the rest of the night.\\"  And that was it- none of the bartenders would serve me, even when I offered to explain what had happened.

In this case, it is not just a favorite, but the best I've ever had.  \\n\\nTheir Chicken Soup hooooooney!  I've never looked at my mother the same way since I had their Chicken Soup.  I've never had a better chicken soup.  It is the best.  Their Guanabana Shake is also awesome!  My other favorite is their Cheese Flan.  Do yourself a favor.  \\n\\nI've taken away one star because I've been there often (as stated) and they are equally often out of the flan.  They are closed on Sundays/Mondays and even on Tuesday when they start their week they are out of my favorite Cheese Flan, which they are consistently out of.  Yes, I am sure I am not the only fan, but that would be a great indicator to stock up, no?  But I'm not bitter...  ;0p  In the meantime, I will continue to make up for lost time."},{"name":"Bangkok City","address":"167 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I've been going to Bangkok City for 20 years, since it first opened and I was working in the area.

Making the reservation was the easiest and most enjoyable part of this experience, they were very nice to me until they got my business. Even then, they didn't reserve me a room at the Hilton I wanted to stay at but at another local location. I made no fuss and proceeded to the Hilton the reservation was made for, this Hilton, 2301 Sullivan Rd. From the second I walked in the door I was treated like I was beneath everyone else and not worth their time. I had to pay almost $100 more than I was quoted by reservations, and no accommodation was made. The woman kept attempting to persuade me to take my business elsewhere but I wanted a 5 star experience so I paid the extra money anyway. Then a security guard aggressively verbally attacked my family for \\"being in the pool after it was closed\\" when the sign said 11pm and the front desk had already okayed us staying until 11. The next morning I complained to management about the bad experience and asked to go to a different hilton if possible and instead of being told that it wasn't possible without a refund and me paying for the other hotel out of pocket they went ahead and checked me out, cancelling my second day leaving me with no where to stay, worrying about the situation and on the phone with guest services and speaking to managers at the front desk for hours until we \\"figured it out\\" and they checked me back in, causing me to pay another security deposit. When I finally was able to relax with my family the second day I was in the pool area for 10 minutes, hadn't even gotten in the pool, and my younger (child) brother had chemical burns from high chlorine levels in the pool. The front desk seemed slightly concerned about it and admitted to having high chlorine levels, and we didn't return to the pool.\\nMultiple times the key cards stopped working and each time we were told it was our fault when we didn't have them near a phone or in a wallet, near any magnets etc. \\n\\nEverything is your fault at the Hilton. They're never in the wrong. \\n\\nThrough all this unnecessary and unwanted drama and chaos never was I offered extra points.. A free night.. A refund.. A penny for my problems.. Nothing. Every hotel I've ever stayed at has been lower rating (Drury Inn, Motel 6, Econolodge) but if I had any problems like I have here, they accommodated me without making me feel like I was a burden, and one time the Drury Inn even refunded my whole stay because of an awful experience due to their ongoing renovations.\\n\\nThis was my first time booking with Hilton, my first Hilton experience, and I promise unless they make any attempt to make amends when I check out it will be my last. This whole experience has caused tension between my family and made me wish I took a staycation and not a vacation.\\n\\nIf I'm going to be treated like I'm a burden or causing issues when I paid just as much as all the other clients in their hotel, I might as well save myself the extra money and go to the Drury Inn or Motel 6 where I've had great experiences.

Usually when I come up I regret having to go home, but this time I can't wait for my husband to wake up so we can get out of here. I would have had better rest in my vehicle with how stressed this staff has had me.\\n\\nThe Hilton has been a major disappointment and I wouldn't recommend this Hilton Garden Inn at 2301 Sullivan Rd to anyone unless you either work with spirit or have a wealthy aura about you.

None of it was very satisfying at all, granted I guess Happy Hour food is really supposed to just bring you in for the drinks, but still...\\n\\nLunch service was terrible. I was on break from a conference and we had limited time to grab lunch and so we were seated promptly as a table of 8 but noted that 3 other groups had all came after us, had their orders taken, and had food on their table, and were even half way through their meal before we ever got our food. I can understand that serving a large party is hard to do, but really...3 other parties first? At first I tried to blame it on one of our picky eaters whose order may have slowed us down b/c the restaurant was trying to give us all our food at the same time but no one ordered anything tricky. Lunch service took over an hour. \\n\\nHad the tuscan kale salad with a steak over the top. Steak was cooked perfectly but undersalted. Kale salad was fairly refreshing and kind of a new surprise b/c I didn't know you could eat chopped kale as a raw salad, but the dressing needed something a little bit more. My dining companion had the one pasta on the menu, the tagliatelle, which b/c it's the ONE pasta they have should be AWESOME...but WAS NOT. It also, like my steak and salad lacked an element of flavor. It tagliatelle with roasted cauliflower and a cream sauce, which was bland. The cauliflower wasn't really incorporated very well at all. It just didn't seem well thought out. Maybe if there were more or a stronger cheese shaved over the top it'dve been better.

I am impolite and have horrible table manners so I start eating, my BBQ was cold and \\"saucy\\".  Not like a smoked, pulled pork but like the garbage you get in a plastic tub at the grocery store.  Their sauces had fancy names Carolina FrooFroo Sauce (or something), that was a mustard sauce, \\"Savory\\" which was sweet and tangy, and \\"Cherry Cola\\" which actually did taste like cherry cola.  None of them were very good and all were too thin.  The veggies weren't done in the brunswick stew, hard lima beans suck, and it was thin and bland.  A ton of Tabasco helped, but wasn't what I wanted in a $4.50 cup of stew.\\n\\nIn short, very unimpressed.

Unfortunately, this wasn't any where near the best pork belly bao we've had. Not to say it was bad, just not spectacular enough to knock it out of the park.\\n\\nBeef Shank Bao\\nThis bao was much better than the pork belly bao. The meat was quite tender and broke apart easily, and the hoisin was a nice familiar touch of what I'm used to in a bao.\\n\\nBeef Noodle Soup\\nBeef Noodle Soup is the first thing I think of when I think of Taiwanese food, and Ah-Ma's does it well. The broth was light and not too salty, but still full of flavor. The highlight of the dish for me was the bok choy; it was cooked perfectly to have this ingredient tender and easy to bite, but at the same time not so saturated that it falls apart. My only criticism here would be that the beef was a bit dry, either due to not enough fat in that portion or it wasn't cooked long enough to break down the collagen.

This past summer, my Dad was in town to grab my brother & I dinner and catch a Clippers game for a guys night out.  I had been to Gordon Biersch (GB) before, but had only tried the beer sampler & shared appetizers with a few friends.\\n\\nLike Columbus Brewing Company (CBC) Barley's,  Elevator, GB is a restaurant that caters to customers that like decent food, good company, & a pint of cold local brew.  In the heart of the Arena District, it is conveniently located close to a lot of the bars and clubs.\\n\\nOn this particular evening, the chef was on his A-Game and our server was very knowledgable about the items on the menu (yet not too \\"professorial\\" with his explanations).  In other restaurants, it always seems like us vegetarians are relegated to the salad bar or a veggie burger that doubles as a frozen hockey puck used by the Blue Jackets for practice.  Fortunately, their veggie burger was made from fresh ingredients made in house; quite the revelation.  \\n\\nFor non-vegetarians, their menu is pretty extensive for those looking to try something that is made to order with fresh seasonings.  My Dad ended up ordering the salmon along with cooked asparagus, and was more than pleased with the result.\\n\\nPortion wise, they were fairly decent and filled the three of us up along with their in-house beer for a palatable combination.  Their price range per person averages $20-30 for dinner, but is worth it for the dining experience for a small group in comparison to the carryout routine that may have cheaper prices, but everything is pre-frozen and the sodium/fat content is 5 fold that of GB.\\n\\nTasty homemade veggie burger, fries with fresh garlic, and a decent pale ale...sounds like a winner for me.  For a guys night out or a small group, I would recommend GB (not so much for groups larger than 10)."},{"name":"Broadway Saloon","address":"12434 SW Broadway St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"The vibe is friendly and local, the drinks are well poured, the food is good, and the service is appropriate and friendly. \\n\\nThis is a step above being \\"dive\\" in my opinion, and they do a good job.

I was with my pregeant wife, so we weren't able to consume any liqueur. \\nThe waiter came right over, and after taking our soft drink order he dissapeared. He was pleasant with his two other tables. He explained to them about a dessert that takes thirty minutes to make, so they should order it with their food. He finnally came over to ask what we want to eat. I ordered a steack medium rare. He asked me if I prefer the soup or Salad, I went with the Salad. He made it sound like it come with the food, and didn't mentioned it was extra. He then left to check on the table next to us, and brought them more butter for their bread. My salad was brought out by another waiter, and I had to ask him for the bread. The food was brought out, by a third waiter. I finnally saw my waiter, while he was checking up on the table next to us. I tried to order a refill on my soda, he walked away. When he returned to the table next to us, to check up on them again, the gentlemen sitting there told him, that I been trying to order another drink. The waiter finnally brought my soda, and before I can tell him my steak was bloody he walked away.  He brought my check, and before he can do his disppearing act again I handed him my card, he returned with my card and dropped it on the table. I heard him tell the table next to us thank you for visiting, and offered them a disount card towards future dinners. He didn't even say Bye to me.  It  felt personal.  The bill came out to $68.00.  I didn't eat my bloody steak, and had to get pizza to fill up after dinner.  I guess he feels that he needs a padded bill to get a good tip, I guess that is why he was sneaky about  charging an extra $7.00 for a salad. It was a good thing the table next to me odered wine, or I would of never gotten me refill. This place needs to treat all it customers the same. \\nThe valet attendent was the only personable person there.  After getting the car he asked how our dinner was, and wished us a safe night home. I think they should employ the valet as manager if they ever want to see a customer return. If you want  good food, and service visit a restuarant that has a crowd.

After each had ONE bite, they did not like the quality of the cake. One thought it was stale (came straight out of fridge to table). The other thought it tasted like it had absorbed odors from other foods in the fridge.( I suspect they don't cover the cake and that's why it seemed stale and had absorbed odors.) Considering both customers had issues with the cake after only one bite we sent the cake back. When we got the bill the charge for the cake was on the bill. When we questioned it, the owner came out and stated they had tried it and it was 'fine'. She was willing to take half off the charge for the cake but would not remove the cost totally.  If the customer(s) do not like what they got, good customer service would be to take it off the bill...what ever happened to 'the customer is always right? I guess that no longer applies.

There's 3 separate dinning halls, each having its own theme within the Beauty and the Beast story. By far the most popular room is the room containing the rose under the glass dome. \\n\\nWe came here in mid October for lunch and to put it simply, the style of dining is basically cafeteria style except they put a twist on the way you order. Instead of ordering by telling the cashier what you would like, you're given a RFID \\"rose\\" which is associated to your table. You begin by tapping that rose on a sensor and through a touch screen you order the food and pay for it; all without the interaction with another human bean. Of course when you need help there's always cast members pacing around to help you. After you placed your order and seat yourself in one of three dining rooms, a server magically locates you, via RFID of your rose, with a pushcart containing your food. It's a unique experience but it's nothing new. In ancient times, the equivalent to this magic in disguise is: you order, you're given a number, you sit down with the number tag, and server hunts for your number on the table and brings you food.\\n\\nIn terms of food, it's actually not too bad. We ordered a French Onion Soup and Carved Prime Chuck Roast Beef Sandwich Served warm on a Baguette with Horseradish Sour Cream and Pommes Frites. The quality of the food is not bad, average to all the other self serve places throughout the park. Even though the soup was not as hot as I would have liked and the sandwich is almost served cold, I think the food still tasted pretty good. One thing I remember clearly was the greens they put in the sandwich, it complements the beef nicely and gives a refreshing zing as you gobble it down. For what you're paying, comparable to other grab and goes, I think this place has more value than the other places offered in Magic Kingdom during lunch because the atmosphere is unique.\\n\\nThe line does get pretty long. People begin to line up an hour prior to opening. During sunny days, they hand out umbrellas and pushcarts containing ice water for people who are waiting in line. We tried to come here again on a different day for dinner but the it was fully booked and they weren't accepting walk-ins.

We got tickets to WDW on a whim 5 days prior. 3 days out, I could only get dinner reservations at 925pm on a Saturday evening (all the rest of Saturday/Sunday times were booked - wow!). Others have already detailed most of what I would already say, so I'll just include some thoughts from a 1st timer:\\n\\nWe were stuck in the Dwarves Train Mine line for over an hour and began to get nervous that we wouldn't make our dinner reservations. After calling the main dinner reservation line, we were assured that they would hold our reservation for 15 minutes and then give us the next available table after our spot was given away. Whew, what a relief! Thankfully, we were just on time since the ride is nearby. \\n\\nApparently you are supposed to check in at this small booth prior to walking across the bridge. Of course, we had no idea - so we just marched on up to the gate to the closed door. The woman \\"standing guard\\" there was clearly towards the end of her shift and unceremoniously booted us back to the booth. We then got a pager that was supposed to flash when your table was ready. However, they also have runners who pick people up and seat them. They were calling out names, which seemed redundant. To keep with the theme, each of the runners had to say \\"Master is calling xxx.\\" Some of those poor people were definitely more into it than others were. I don't think I could have kept a straight face yelling that all shift long. \\n\\nWe had put \\"gluten allergy\\" on the reservations since bf was trying to be strict gluten free still while on vacation. The chef himself kindly came out to discuss options with him. Surprisingly, they were totally accommodating without extra charge (gotta love the Disney service model). \\n\\nThe french onion soup ($8, our version bread free) was totally delicious! It was probably the best version I've ever had. The secret, per the chef, is that it's a more traditional version with a vegetable stock instead of beef. I have now been on the search for a great recipe to make at home. Skip the hot cocoa ($2.80, it's definitely powdered mix with water, yuck), but get the lemon raspberry cream puff ($4.20, also gluten free). My salmon was perfection ($25) and bf's braised pork was delish ($23.50). \\n\\nOverall, it was a fun Disney evening. I would probably go again if we had money to splurge. Without kids and ordering drinks, dinner wasn't totally a bank-breaker. I can't imagine the bill of the tables who had 7-8 people! \\n\\nHints: make a reservation!

Yes there are (very good, crisp, fresh) vegetables.  There are also portion sizes as unhealthily large as one can find at any Denny's, a lack of whole grain tortillas (such a no-brainer these days) ... a dependence on grain (the kind that make cows fat - do you think people are very different), and only two protein choices: soy (which many people cannot tolerate) and chicken.  If you're going to pretend to offer options, have real options: fish is another no-brainer in this food niche.  \\n\\nI was surprised the person taking my order was so unaware of nutrition that when I asked what the protein choices were, he didn't mention cheese.  But then I found it:  they do have quesadillas.  Or maybe he didn't mention it because the quesadilla is really a vege-dilla with a few specks of cheese.  Yep it was tasty -- it also had about as much nutritional value as a handful of vitamins and a glass of Metamucil, plus heavily processed starch. \\n\\nI've been here a few times, sure that the time before was a fluke, but they are very consistent:  An aloof person who takes an order and isn't able to answer questions about the food.

A red wine that is so warm it seems the bottle must have been sitting next to the stove, served in a narrow-necked juice glass (but it's not very good anyway, so who cares).  Flavorful vegetables.  Ridiculously largely portioned desserts that also aren't as healthy or as earth-friendly as marketed.  \\n\\nAnd then the stinginess.  Stingy about asking for something to wrap up half the meal to go home (because I don't like to consume half a day's calories in one sitting).  A minimum charge for Visa or Debit transactions.  An automatic 8% gratuity on orders with more than 8 items (I do personally tip even when no service is provided -- but making it mandatory in an order at the counter, bus your own table establishment is ... stingy).  Signs everywhere:  No this, no that, do this, do that.  \\n\\nEven one on the shelves of condiments, that condiments are only for dine-in orders -- not to go.  Heaven forbid a customer make off with 1 cent worth of house Tobasco sauce!  \\n\\nEven if I were vegetarian or vegan, the sloooow service, the nagging-ness, the stingy portions of proteins (while charging $1-3 more for these items), the lack of truly healthful options, the inconsistencies in the \\"message\\" it's trying to sell with its food, the fact that the only redeeming feature is tasty vegetables ...

We didn't feel like driving all the way into Boston and after a google search for \\"good north shore restaurants,\\" this one popped up and on a Friday night, we found an open reservation for two for 8:30 on Saturday, so we took it.\\n\\nWe got there about 15 minutes early and were going to have a drink at the bar while we waited for our table, but much to our delight, our table was ready. Yay!\\n\\nThe restaurant is small, simple, and dark. The decor is nice, but understated. There aren't a ton of tables (i.e. definitely make a reservation), but they were spaced apart nicely so that you weren't sitting on top of the diners next to you (I hate that -- a personal pet peeve of mine).\\n\\nThe server was very pleasant and efficient. She explained their specials as well as how their menu is set up (at first glance, I thought \\"wow, these are some really reasonable prices for the pasta -- and then she explained that the price was for a half order, which made more sense). We each ordered a drink, an order of arancini to split, a side of asparagus, and a half-order of pasta each.\\n\\nThe arancini was good -- fried to perfection, but a little bit on the cheesy side (DH loves cheese... I am impartial to it). DH got the tagliatelle bolognese and I got the gnocci with lamb. Even though the portion was a \\"half,\\" I found that it was more than enough to make me full (especially after our appetizer and side). I definitely don't think I could have finished a whole order by myself, so I'm glad I didn't order that. My gnocci was wonderful also. The lamb was cooked to perfection, the gnocci was homemade and delicious, and though I would think the two would make a delicious combination, it worked. My one and only complaint is that the pasta was a tad on the oily side. Another Yelper mentioned an overuse of salt... I did detect a hint of that, but it didn't bother me. The highlight of our meal though, was probably the side of asparagus. Weird thing to say, I know, but the spears were a wonderful medium/dark green color and deliciously seasoned. The portion was also very generous.\\n\\nAll in all, we had a wonderful dinner sans kid and would definitely come here again.

I can taste too much oil/grease. This guy claims to be using a different oil and after having his fritter I believe him.\\n    So he put the donut in a box to protect the freshness/glaze, and I got my donut. He said \\"wait 2 hours before you eat this and then eat half then and wait a day to eat other half, so you can try it then too.\\" I did as he instructed for the 2  hours but couldnt wait till the next day to eat the other half so I ate the other half that night.

I suppose they didn't have the social media presence that NadaMoo has.  More's the pity.\\n\\nArriving at the store front you get the feeling at all that you are entering a space that is a chain.  I certainly didn't get the notion that I had arrived somewhere where the food they sell is made there, or that there is any passion involved.  There's a freezer with big plastic bins that come from a factory somewhere.  Or you can turn left and buy the same pints that you would in the grocery store (which cost far less that buying per scoop).  It felt like a baskin-robbins with more coconut milk and fewer flavors.  There was a lovely espresso machine there as well that none of the 4 servers knew how to use. \\n\\nAgain, I feel you can do far worse for dairy-free ice cream, but the juxtaposition of NadaMoo versus Venezia seemed to me something I couldn't get over.

I waited 5 minutes for a customer in front of me to be attended to, and then another 5 minutes to make an order. \\n\\nOnce I was able to order (pulled pork corn cake), the food came quickly. The pork was warm, and the corn cake was borderline cold. This was my first time eating a corn cake, and I was not impressed. It tasted like an un-seasoned corn-flavored pancake. The pork tasted like it was slathered in BBQ sauce, but there was no depth in flavor.\\n\\nConsidering the price & quality of food and service, I would try a different place if I am back in town for another business trip."},{"name":"Papagayo","address":"331 Great River Rd","city":"Somerville","stars":"2.5","text":"Disclaimer: this review is based solely on drinks at the bar*\\n\\nLove going to the bar here.

I ordered 5 boxes (3 bourbon flavored, 1 beer flavored, 1 s'mores flavored).  I placed the order in the beginning of Dec and there was NO communication of possible processing delay due to the holidays.  So with that said, the website clearly states that new orders are shipped within 1-2 days.  I placed my order on a Tuesday and by Saturday I had realized I had not received any email confirming my shipment.  I sent an email asking for a status....NO RESPONSE RECEIVED.  I called on Monday morning and was told it would ship out today and she emailed me the tracking number.  Apparently, the order did not go out until almost 6:00pm that day.  On Tuesday when I checked the tracking status, it said it was sent Priority 2-day mail but my expected delivery date was for Friday (5 days later).  I waited until Friday for my package and NOTHING WAS RECEIVED.  I called the company (again) and told the rep, 1) about why it took so long to ship when the website clearly states otherwise and 2) why my shipping said 2 day mail and 5 days later I haven't received it.  She apologized that I had not received my package but basically said there was NOTHING she could do to help me and NOONE available (manager or owner) to speak with.  1) Who tells a customer there's NOTHING that can be done to accommodate an unhappy customer and 2) have NOONE available to speak to above a general phone answerer?  She asked for my name, order number and call back number and told me someone will call me in 2-3 days.  2-3 days?  Are you serious?  It takes that long to call someone back?  Well, let's just say it's been FIVE DAYS and NO PHONE CALL has been received.  I am all for supporting small businesses (local or not) but customer service is so important (no matter the size of the company) and is what determines if your customers return.  I am still trying to receive my marshmallows but with this POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, I'm sorry but I will NEVER order from them again and NOT refer them to anyone I know.

They smoked my mind with deliciousness on Saturday and I gotta evangelize.\\n\\nI'll begin by saying that service was impeccable from start to finish. Phenomenal staff at this place. I had excellent conversation with my server the entire night and she was particularly knowledgeable and helpful. Sadly, I forgot her name, but I will edit so she gets her due.\\n\\nThe beverage program is impressive. I tried one of the absinthe drinks and was pleasantly surprised. A lot of places that try to integrate absinthe end up being a bit heavy-handed, but not Waypoint. The rest of their drinks seemed pretty old school, which is good in this case. Their house cocktails certainly are inspired by classic drinks of old, and they have a section of revival drinks that pay more direct homage, as well.\\n\\nThe food, though, is just silly. We tried to sample a variety of things and stuck with some of the Waypoint classics:\\n\\n1. Smoked shrimp: So clean and simple. Peel and eat, served with house-made saltines, buttermilk yogurt stuff, and hot sauce. An excellent start to the meal.\\n\\n2. Kenny's bread plate: I don't know this Kenny guy, but he's a legend. Kenny makes the burger buns, pizza dough, breads, and I assume anything else that gets baked at Waypoint (and Alden and Harlow), and he does a damn fine job. The pizza dough was great. The breads, though, were otherworldly. We had a chickpea and benne bread, a fish sauce baguette, and a seaweed sourdough. All were astounding. The seaweed sourdough was unbelievably glutinous and bouncy. These were served with a seaweed butter concoction as well as a white bean and squid ink dip/spread.\\n\\nKenny for president. Or at least Secretary of Gluten.  \\n\\n3. Smoked whitefish pizza: Dill, capers, big gobs of smoked fish. The pizza dream I never knew I wanted.\\n\\n4. Bucatini with smoked egg yolk, pecorino, and uni. I'm usually not a huge uni fan, but I figured this combination with smoked egg yolk could be a nice gateway for me, and it was. The pasta was fantastic. A good portion of chewy noodles, drenched in egg yolk and cheese. The uni blended in well and provided just enough funky brine to make things really interesting.\\n\\nI will definitely be back, probably with friends. Waypoint is challenging for multiple Boston's-best titles here: raw bar, beverage program, pasta, pizza, bread, etc. Maybe they don't win them all (or even any), but it's rare to find a restaurant that does so many things so well."},{"name":"Himalayas Indian Restaurant","address":"5336 Peachtree Rd","city":"Chamblee","stars":"4","text":"Himalayas has large menu of Indian dishes.\\nWe had a nice dinner on a Saturday night with no wait.\\nMy Tandoori chicken was awesome.\\nService was very good."},{"name":"Taqueria El Carrizal","address":"254 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"I'm forever locked in!

I came here for lunch on a Monday and had the curry of the day: Gang Dang. Like the reviews said, I had a salad immediately upon taking a seat. Unfortunately I didn't have a water that quickly and the peanut dressing, while the flavor is good, is way too watery. The curry was fine, and reminded me of my time in Thailand, but nothing special. The tom yum soup was also OK. Another dish might be more in line with my flavor preferences, sadly I may have not ordered correctly.

I have worshipped at the altar of the Mouse for my entire life.  As a college student, I interned in Disney World, and my family joined the Disney Vacation Club.  Now an adult with a responsible job, a husband, and children, I travel there regularly.  I looked forward to my first experience at Be Our Guest on my most recent trip.  Although I have been to WDW several times since it opened, I have not been there, in part because we couldn't get a reservation.  This place is VERY popular.  \\n\\nWell, now I've been there, and I'm no longer disappointed that I couldn't get a reservation.  Now I'm just disappointed.  \\n\\nFirst, let me say that I'm not a snob about good service.  I have been to many restaurants where the server was inattentive or the service was lacking, and I just enjoyed my experience.  But something about this experience was different and made me want to record my observations.  As at least one other Yelper has said, the Check-In area is a complete shitshow.  I'm sorry, but it is.  Disney, I hope you are reading this.  It is loud.  It is crowded.  It is disorganized.  There is no seating.  We showed up about 15 minutes early for a 6:20 reservation for 3 adults (my 10 year old son is a Disney adult) + infant, and were told that they were running about 20 minutes behind schedule.  Fine.  EXCEPT that the waiting area is chaotic.  In addition to that, I became nervous that we wouldn't hear our name when it was called, and let me tell you, those Cast Members did not look like they were going to be either patient or forgiving!  They were coming out calling \\"Smith, Party of 3, LAST CALL!\\"  with frowns on their faces.  Now, I get it.  I've been there.  But it is entirely possible to be three feet from the host calling your name and not here him.   BAD DESIGN, DISNEY.  Acoustics are everything in that situation.  \\n\\nThen, we were seated.  We walked through the main dining room and I was IMMEDIATELY grateful that we were not seated in there.  Now, may I just say that the architecture and decor are gorgeous, and it appears to be snowing outside the window.  But the room is ENORMOUS and you most certainly feel like you are in a FACTORY rather than an expensive restaurant.  :(  We proceeded to our own dining room, the Music Box room.  A little more intimate, so it seemed.  EXCEPT.  In one corner, behind cheap partitions, was a makeshift kitchen service area.  It was LOUD.  The silverware, plates, and glasses banged against each other, and echoed in the cavernous room!  Again...ACOUSTICS???  In addition, I looked around this room, and almost half the tables were empty.  Then why were they running late on seating people?  I'm sorry....I'm NOT a service snob, but when you're sitting in the chaotic waiting area, and there are a dozen empty tables, why can't you be seated?   \\n\\nReally, that is the bulk of my complaining.  The food was fine - I had the lambchops and I thought they were good.  My 10 year old had a child's steak (technically against Disney rules), and my husband had a steak.  Other than Cast Members breaking a huge tray of dishes and glasses, our meal was uneventful.  Our Hostess/Waitress was very nice, but there was a very tense undertone to the place.  We did not have dessert.  When I'm in Disney World, I expect to pay a lot, and we did, but I understand Disney is raising the prices at BoG by making it a Prix-Fixe experience.  Apparently, they are having trouble with people booking reservations just to have dessert and experience the various dining rooms.  Well...I don't know what to say about that.  I don't love the hyper-managed experience Disney has turned into, but this isn't the place for  that rant.  \\n\\nWe'll be back to Disney, but not to BoG.

I ordered the sushi and sashimi lunch special, which was 10 pieces of sashimi and 3 nigiri plus miso soup for $13. The fish was very fresh, especially the yellowtail (which you don't usually get in a combo) and the salmon. My only complaint was with the mackerel, which was slightly mushy.

Great service and good food. \\n\\nBut on a day when it's full, I might feel hesitant in coming. We were there for too long. I went with my friends and it took us a while to grab a waitress's attention to order. Five minutes later, we realized that we weren't served water, so it took us another while to grab a waitress's attention to get us water. Fifteen minutes later, we still have not gotten out food. Even the tables next to us, who came after us, have their food. We got a waitress to check in on our food to find out that our tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork) was given to our neighboring table. Finally, when we got our jajangmyeon (black bean sauce noodles) and our tangsuyuk, we asked a waitress where our long awaited appetizer, scallion pancake, was. They've forgotten it again. While waiting, another waitress gave us the bill. The bill included the scallion pancake, which made us confused as to why we were given the bill. On the bright side, one positive experience that stood out that night was asking for a kimchi side dish. We were told that they ran out of kimchi, but then they got more and remembered to give us this!\\n\\nI would have given this place a 2 star if I've only been here once with that negative experience, but because I've been here several times before and have had better experience, it would average out to a 3 star. Overall, the food is good. I would totally come back for the tangsuyuk and the jajangmyeon. Their restroom is pretty unique. (It has a metallic theme to it with a metal toilet!)

Recently I had three big ones: pizza, boardgames, and playing with cats. Upon a long and tiresome search, I realized I would have to suffice with two of the three components. That's where Pizzeria Ludica comes in and helped me find the things I had been longing for.\\n\\nDefinitely the biggest draw for Pizzeria Ludica is the opportunity to play games and have a nice meal at the same time. For food, there's the standard Italian fare of pizza and pasta. For me pizza just feels like the perfect compliment for board games. There's a whole bunch of games. Way too many to list but my group was into Cards Against Humanity and Politically Incorrect. Tons of other offerings like Avalon, Secret Hitler, Apples to Apples, Monopoly, way too many to list. Even saw a box for Who Wants to be a Millionaire. \\n\\nI have to note is that I love how the restaurant looks and is set up. It's spacious and there is plenty of room to eat and play games at the same time. More hyped about big wooden tables and chairs than I should have any right to be. There's also the cooking area where the chefs prepare food along and that's pretty neat to see. The cabinets on the wall are filled with all the boardgames they have and it's even categorized. Coming in I felt like I was in a fancy place to play games and have pizza.\\n\\nOrdered the Pass the Pigs pizza for myself. I'll just get my one quibble out of the way first. I don't like hard crust pizza. I always end up cutting the inside of my mouth. The pizza served had somewhat hard crust. Not my cup of tea and it was my only disappointment albeit a very small one. Otherwise I was really satisfied with what I have. Tons of toppings on the pizza and it all meshed together pretty well. Great portion size where it was just enough for me. Scored a ton of marks and was definitely one of the better pizzas I got to enjoy. \\n\\nFull-heartedly would recommend Pizzeria Ludica as a place to drop by and have a good time. Best part too is customers have up to 3 hours to eat and play. That's plenty of time to catch up with friends and try out some new games. These guys definitely know how to get people in and serve good food to keep folks coming.

We had the Beef & Foie Gras meatballs and I felt like screaming BRAVO! after taking a bite.  These were some of the most savory and softest meatballs ever.  The foie gras really took this dish to another level with a hint of creamy sweetness.  Unbelievably one of the best parts was the thick handkerchief pasta underneath.  It was so delicate and fresh I could have eaten a whole plate of it.  \\n\\nThe first act was very hard to follow but the main course entrees were indeed show stoppers.

The Mafalde was also awesome, definitely a Bolongnese worthy of praise.  For those two dishes I gave a standing ovation.  \\n\\nThe Scungilli was just ok.  I was expecting a black ink sauce but only the pasta is colored with squid ink.  The dish was actually in a red sauce but I found it kind of bland.  \\n\\nOverall it was an incredible night at Teatro.  The service was exemplary and we did not have to wait long with an 8:00PM reservation on the weekend.

No, not the Depeaux, or the Home Depot or The Office Depot.  Just The Depot.  I held off for a while due to some caveats.  We went there within the first two weeks of opening so I'm fairly sure kinks still needed to be worked out.  We were part of a large (10 people) group.  We had reservations, but the space doesn't seem physically well laid out for large groups who are there to eat and not just drink.  With that out of the way, it's time for my impressions of Depot. \\n\\nEh.\\n\\nThat's pretty much it.  Eh.  The good: the space is gorgeous, a beautiful re-purpose of an old train depot.  Unfortunately it's about as well insulated as one.  Come here on a cold day and remove your coat at your peril.  It wasn't me being fussy either; one of our party was a Canadian snow miser, so if HE'S cold then I'm two seconds away from slicing open a Taun Taun.  (Joke for nerds only.  Not responsible for non-nerds caught in the crossfire.)  At first, I enjoyed the nipplicious nature of this frozen tundra, but staring at those things only provides so much entertainment. Besides, it's all fun 'til someone puts an eye out.\\n\\nThe service was harried.  Our server did his best, but was obviously undertrained.  We let it slide knowing he had probably been at The Depot just a few hours longer than we had.  The management tried to accommodate us when we told them about the bone-chilling draft descending upon our two booths.  They moved us to another two booths that somehow managed to be even colder.  Giving up, we just ate with our coats on.  So to the management, \\"A\\" for effort, \\"F\\" for execution.\\n\\nIt was the food though that underwhelmed me.  It was merely okay.  After going over the options, I found none to my liking.  Allegedly the pizzas and the oysters, though I'm hoping not at the same time, are the draw. But I was in no mood for pizza and until a restaurant gets its sea legs, I steer away from raw oysters.  I ordered a burger while a couple of us shared the obligatory artichoke and spinach dip.  The dip was okay, though served with too few chips.  My burger was overdone despite me ordering it medium rare.  My companions were similarly....whelmed with their entrees.  The girlfriend's she-crab soup had okay taste but no discernable crab chunks in it.  I do distinctly remember thinking \\"I've seen meth labs cook with more care than this place,\\" but that may have been driven more from the freezer burn on my brain than the actual food.  And the plastic baskets in which the food was served did not jibe with the setting.  Hopefully that's been rectified.\\n\\nSo okay.  I'm pulling for you Depot. The three stars is me being VERY generous and giving you the benefit of the doubt.  (And also because I can't give 2.5 stars.)  I'll give you a pass the first time around, but it's going to be very hard to talk my friends into coming back to try you again.

The odd part was that the hits were sides, and the misses were the meats.  Before I get to the food, I'll say I really like the atmosphere here. I used to come here a lot years ago when it was a sports bar (I'm blanking on the name at the moment), and it's a good space - Smokebelly basically cut the prior restaurant in half (it's big), and uses half as the main space and half as a Speakeasy.  There's a large deck for nicer weather. Service was efficient - not exactly conversational, but drinks were never empty and food came quickly. \\n\\nSpecifics on the food:\\n-Brisket - tender and juicy...but strangely bland. If you told me it hadn't been smoked at all, I would have believed you. I get the impression they're of the old school \\"Salt and Pepper only\\" rub variety, but whatever it is, they need to use a lot more of it. \\n-Ribs - like the brisket, there was no noticeable smoke, but they were nicely cooked - very tender, but not over-cooked falling apart.  Good sauce, but I'm a fan of both rub and sauce on ribs, and they seem to be a sauce only place. Lack of smoke and rub made the overall flavor disappointing. \\n-Pulled pork - OK, I got a little smoke here. I tried my wife's pulled pork sandwich, and it was solid. \\n-Sauces - I like all 3 of their sauces (Savory, Carolina, and Spicy). I'm not a huge fan of the vinegariness of most Carolina style sauces, but I really liked this one.\\n-Chili - the best thing I had - this is a dang good chili. For reasons unbeknownst to me, most restaurants fail at Chili. Smokebelly doesn't.\\n-Mac & Cheese - very good. Could have used the addition of one saltier cheese, but overall a very worthwhile side to get.\\n-Slaw - fairly straightforward, but better than most. Slaw is another thing that way too many places fail at, but this is a good, southern style slaw."},{"name":"Somerville Brewing Co","address":"15 Ward St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"If you're looking for a commercial feel, poor quality food, fighting to keep fruit flies out of your beer, and on top of it all - terrible service, Somerville Brewing is the place for you.

Discounted drinks, discounted appetizers, happy and attentive bartenders. \\n\\nWe then found a table for dinner (which is pretty much a seat yourself experience - no host or hostess here). Our server at the table was, to put it politely, not too hot. She kept saying she heard what we wanted but didn't deliver at all. Can we have water - yeah I gotcha - water never appeared. We ordered potstickers - they never came. Then when we asked for them again she said oh yeah i gotcha - they never came. We had to beg for our check. \\n\\nHonestly I don't like the food at this chain in general. I feel everything is frozen and then prepared. Maybe I'm wrong but I don't feel like anything here is fresh. This is how I felt after eating at the Bar Louie in Coconut Creek as well.\\n\\nThe reason for the 2 stars is the server at dinner was off AND my moms credit card was compromised right after dining here. It was the only time and place she used her credit card and that night she got a call from the cc company saying that airline tickets were attempting to be charged on her card.  Had the service at the bar not have been so good, this would've been a 1 star experience for sure."},{"name":"World Foods","address":"830 NW Everett St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"They had so many Arabic foods I was thrilled to find this place.

But for some reason I feel compelled to do so now. I had lunch at Smoke Belly just a few days ago. And as much as I would love for it to succeed, as I work in Buckhead, this was one of the worst bbq meals I've ever had. To make matters worse, my bill was $24.00 for a simple serving of brisket that was a few days old and soaked in sauce and cider and two sides and a sweet tea. The tea was good, but unfortunately that was it. As mentioned, the brisket was awful and it came highly recommended. The Brunswick stew was flavorless and dull, even poor old canned Castleberry brunswick strew is better. Both the meat and the stew was smokeless, as to say crockpots or dutch ovens with no flame were used. For both, you need a fire and that didn't exist here. \\n\\nThe space was cool, a bit \\"Fado\\" like but for a BBQ joint.

Bread service was sour dough, pretzel buns and a cheese biscuit with butter from Banner farms butter, some of best bread and butter I've had short of restaurants like del post and per se in New York. \\n\\nFor appetizers we split the soft shell crab and the truffled potato pierogi dumplings. Both were great though the pierogi definitely stood out more. The slow braised wagyu was fork tender and the mushrooms were some of the best I've had in a while. For my main I had the atlas steak with the snake river farms. Cooked to a perfect medium rare it was a steak every bit the equal to any of the top name steak houses I've been to. If you enjoy your beef I would definitely get this,\\n\\nI closed with the banana revolution that came with banana caramel ice cream, banana ginger cream, chocolate and a myriad of other things I didn't quite get to identify as I powered my way through this dessert. The ginger flavors comes across pretty strongly so if you do not like it this would not be a good dessert.
