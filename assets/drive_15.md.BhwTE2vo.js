The atmosphere certainly conveys a modern richness. None of that  tacky decor you may find in the usual thai or thai style establishment. That being said, I must say, I was not overwhelmed with the food.\\n\\nPartly because the architecture lends itself to wanting to be as good as the food. I just think the look wins the battle, In fact, i tended to be more curious about the tableware.\\n\\nOne thing I will say about every single dish we had. There was a hesitation in the flavouring.  I found it tended to  fall short on having its own  flavour before adding sauces.  To me, a good  dish has a little something going for it before I fix it.  I really don't want to do too much work before I actually enjoy what i'm eating. Hey! But that is just me.\\n\\nWe shared an assortment of plates from the lunch menu.  \\nGreen Papaya Salad:(som dtam) green beans, carrots, garlic, bird's eye chiles, dried shrimp.  The in-house made Thai sausage.  Two orders of the roti.  Green Curry of Coconut Braised Beef (geng gwio warn) bamboo, grachai, holy basil, pea eggplant, spicy, rich and earthy.  Jungle Curry of Sablefish (geng bpa plah lampang) made with fried shallots, spicy, nutty and  aromatics.\\n\\nFinally, the item both servers recommended with absolute glee - Chiang Mai curry noodles (kao soi gai)mild curry with coconut cream, pickled mustard greens, and slow braised chicken thighs.  This one was my favourite of everything I tried.  It had a nice contrast of textures and flavours plus the chicken was tender to the point where it could still absorb the flavours of the broth.  To me, this dish was the saving grace.\\n\\nActually, the pink orchard cocktail, they recommended was tasty. Yes, that I would order again.\\n\\nThe other items have that problem I described.  Not as enticing to the palate as it could be.  It's not that you  would have a bad meal. Not at all but I think it could be better.  I haven't tried everything on their menu. I chose not to try the traditional Pad Thai you see on every menu because of just that.

All of the staff were incredibly friendly and seemed to actually enjoy doing their jobs (so rare!). The seating is small and cramped and you may even have to share a longer table with strangers, but the place is tiny so you do what you gotta do. They offer tons of side dishes, chips and desserts, and they play some great music so that's always a plus.\\n\\nMy husband and I both created our own sandwiches. He ordered smoked turkey & pastrami on rye with Havarti and light mustard. He's a light eater and these were sandwiches with thick piles of meat, but he ate every single bite so that means it was hella good.\\n\\nI had smoked turkey & roast beef with Havarti and olive tapenade on 9 grain wheat bread. The meats were amazing, definitely not your typical wet grocery store lunch meats. The black olive tapenade was super flavorful and they put the perfect amount on my bread, but it overpowered the thin slice of Havarti on my sandwich so I'll have to keep that in mind next time and ask for extra cheese. The wheat bread was chewy and had oats lining the crust. Delicious sandwiches!\\n\\nI also had a 1/2 pint side of the out-of-this-world-beyond-amazing Kale Salad. Oh my goodness, best kale creation in the world no matter who you are! Finely chopped kale, tons of chickpeas, walnut, some red onion, a few chunks of feta and the perfect background of lemon juice. Best side dish EVER! \\n\\nMy ONLY complaint and the only reason I'm giving Brown Bag a 4 star instead of 5 star rating is that we requested both sandwiches to be super grilled because we wanted crunchy bread, warm meats and gooey cheese. My husbands bread was lightly toasted and his sandwich was a little warm in the middle but not enough to melt any cheese. My sandwich didn't taste grilled, toasted, or warm at all. The meats were super cold and the bread had no crunch to it, which disappointed me a bit but at least it was still an amazing sammy overall.\\n\\nBrown Bag & Katzingers are both amazing delis but are 2 totally different experiences in my opinion so I would highly recommend visiting both.

Not sure that was a better idea, we should've just gone somewhere else. She got the mac & cheese which was more like pasta w/ cream poured over it like soup, she basically needed a spoon to eat it. I got this appetizer of corn fritters which wasn't bad but we serve it over rice & the add sliced avocado to it, just a very strange combination that didn't really mesh well together.\\n\\nWe decided to split dessert & that was also not worth the money or the calories.

We then shared the chicken momos which are Tibetan style dumplings accompanied with 3 different sauces with the accent being on tamarind I believe and curry.  Each sauce was different and equally enjoyable.  Next were 2 seasoned lamb skewers served with its own dipping sauce on a plate with saffron rice.  It was tender and beautifully flavoured.  We also ordered a kind of steamed Nepalese whole wheat bread which tempered some of the spiciness of the meal which was also very good.  For dessert we shared the duhbari which was a dish of  bite size  milk curdles which we found to be just right  in terms of sweetness.  If we had been hungrier we probably would have tried the Gurkha version of creme caramel which was highly recommended to us.

Once inside, I realized WHY there was a line out the door. It wasn't cause their donuts are bomb it's cause the workers are SLOW AS FCK! How long and how many workers does it take just to put donuts in a box???!

Here's what we ordered:\\n\\n1. Blueberry Bourbon Basil - You can taste a hint of basil which makes it refreshing, but it tasted mainly like a blueberry donut that you can get anywhere. The dough wasn't mind blowing or anything and it was pretty stale IMO. It tasted basically like what it looked...a yeast donut with blueberry frosting. DISAPPOINTED\\n\\n2. Original Glaze (OG) - TBH krispy kreme is still the winner here. This original was better than the other donuts we ordered at Blue Star which is pretty sad. Again, nothing mind blowing.\\n\\n3. Maple Bacon - VOODOO's maple bacon is 10x better!! The bacon here is cut into super small pieces and the quality/taste wasn't as good as voodoo's.

They were all little things; unfortunately, most of our table comprised of waitstaff & bartenders, and they noticed. She did bring a carafe of water upon returning with the bill.  That was nice, to feel like we were being invited to stay and talk. The decor was perfect for the ambiance. Unique wagon wheel chandeliers, perfect lighting, and the staff uniform of jeans and flannel shirt gave a very home-y vibe.

My friends and I shared a snack meal which comes with 2 slices of bread, a thigh, and a drumstick. Us four shared this and we were wanting more. The chicken had a kick of tabasco flavor and you can tell there's some sort of hot sauce because when you bite into the chicken there's a rim of orangey / red color on the surface of the meat. But oh man...that chicken - the skin was super crispy, the meat was extremely juicy, and not oily at all. Seriously every bite i took was a crunch (from the skin), a drip (from the juicy chicken), and that Mmmmmmm because the meat is still so tender-not-dry-at-all meat! I'm salivating as I'm typing this and reminiscing that day. \\n\\nBecause we were doubting ourselves -- was it really that good or was it because we had a whole day of red meat and with the change in food it tasted better? So we just had to go back the next day and this time we ordered our own meal - NO SHARING!! and indeed it was just as delicious as we remembered. \\n\\nI got to try a bite of the white meat and it was good too, piping hot - fresh out of the fryer and still maintain it's juiciness. but i stil llike my dark meat (thigh and drum). We also shared some sides: mac n cheese, seasoned fries, beans, and cole slaw. All were tasty. \\nThe mac n cheese was my favorite, the macaroni were cooked perfectly soft, the cheese was melty and gooey with a dash of paprika.\\n\\nseasoned fries and cole slaw were standard. nothing spectacular.\\n\\nthe beans, now i dont normally eat beans, but these were good. they remind me of Bush's Beans (from the can).

I brought my family from California  and I wanted to bring them to an Authentic Texas BBQ Joint. I did some research and I found this pretty little gem! \\n\\nSince we drove such a long way, we were really starving! So we ended up getting the Small Family Meat Plate (Brisket [lean and fatty], Pork Ribs, And Sausage with Cream Corn, Coleslaw, Mac and Cheese, Corn Bread, and Peach Cobbler)\\n\\nBrisket- This has been hands down the best brisket I have tried. It was perfectly moist,tender, and Smokey. My personal favorite is the fatty brisket, and MY GOD, did this melt like butter! It was also really good with the homemade Original BBQ sauce, if you're into that. The lean brisket was also very flavorful, it was not dry one bit. A couple of my family members really appreciated it. \\n\\nPork Ribs- Now from the outside, the pork ribs look great, but it was the worst part of the meal. The ribs were overly salted, almost inedible. That really sucked because they look fantastic. I would compare the taste of the ribs to over-salted pastrami. The ribs were the only reasons why this post was not 5 stars\\n\\nSausage- This was a really good quality sausage. It was jam packed with flavor and had a great snap. \\n\\nCorn Bread- The Corn Bread at Terry's is the best corn bread I've had in Texas! It was soft but also sturdy. Unlike most cornbreads, this was extremely moist and flavorful. This is something your mom would make and definitely worth the extra $1! \\n\\nSides- Each of the sides were amazing. I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever. The creamed corn was my absolute favorite(I probably should learn how to make this so I can stop spending so much money)\\n\\n\\nOverall, this is an awesome BBQ spot to visit. It is definitely earned the reputation it has of being one of the best BBQ joints around. Sadly, the ribs weren't for me, I did not like the seasoning but everything else was fantastic!

You have to know how to order here, its very crucial to your meal...you don't want to end up with something ordinary, do you? I suggest asking the servers what the best thing is on the menu everywhere I go, but here, it is essential. There are some sleeper items and some dazzlers. If you don't ask the servers, do what I do: \\nStart with the oysters, you are out of the house for god's sake, live a little. \\nAnd then order one of the following: \\n1) the Pan Roasted Lobster (no, not the grilled lobster, I'm sure its lovely but then you'll just have to come back another night and order correctly). Want to know who recommends this? The late and great Julia Child, she had this once a month (I heard that on the Phantom Gourmet I think), I tasted it after hearing this and pity the fool who orders anything else. \\n2) the Fried Chicken! Yes! Chicken at the Shack! God, these little things are delicious, there is a slight citrus flavor that is so satisfying and unique. \\n\\nBest idea ever?

She went with the traditional beef with EVOO and capers while I got a bit adventurous trying the pounded flat veal with lemon aoli and tiny pickles. Mine was interesting and surprising how well the flavors worked, but a bit  too much mayoey flavor for me. Ultimately the traditional beef came through strong with a nice cut and perfect seasoning. Round 1 goes to my sister\\n\\nRound 2\\n battle entree - I wanted something light so I went with the mussels in a tomato broth. It was perfectly cooked and flavored, so much so that we needed to ask the friendly cute bartender for extra rolls to sop it all. My sister went with carprece salad - SO I automatically win. I don't get why people like this dish-buffalo mozzarella tastes like plain. I'm not a fan of raw tomato's either. However, in fairness to the battle I needed to try it and I will admit it was kinda good ...for plain. super fresh and of high quality but no I still win. \\n\\nTiebreaker \\nFor the final round I need to go to drinks sense we were not in mood for desert.   I had a perfect dirty martini and a flagon of some amazing red wine Il tormodilitio or something like that..

I never did get around to trying it and it wasn't on my priority list.  At a wedding, I met a young man named Yuji and he explained that he was in the process of opening a Sushi restaurant, so I told him that I would forego visiting a Sushi joint until he opened.  So as a rookie, I would say that what I had, which was a BC roll and and a Veggie roll, was very good, crisp and fresh.  The presentation was outstanding and after watching Yuji at work, I could tell he had it down pat.  I met a couple of other Japanese customers there and they regarded Yuji's style as very traditional Japanese, with not so large portions or rolls.  It seems everyone else had forgotten the art they said, and due to the stiff competition, many establishments have been serving larger rolls, which goes against the essence of fine Sushi. I'll be returning to try just about everything.  Yuji has a large HDTV and it will be great for watching hockey.  I'll be returning over and over again.

Thankfully, one of my friends wanted to try it as well. I mean, sure, there are plenty of sushi places and Pho eateries in Vancouver. But a Nepalese restaurant? \\n\\nFirst things first, it's quite easy to miss it. The place itself is sort of a house on the second floor on Davie St, which adds to the mysteriousness of it.

The flavours were definitely there. I must say, the food is good. I eat quite a bit, so I wasn't particularly full. But I could see that the portion would fill up an average person. \\n\\nNow for the bummer. To put it in a polite manner, the service was subpar at best. The food was good, but it was clear that there was a lot of confusion going on between the staff there. It took quite a while for them to bring out the food (~30 minutes). There was so much confusion, they forgot the roti. One of the staff then mentioned that they were having some sort of a \\"crisis\\" in the kitchen. Fortunately I did not see any smoke or fumes coming out from the back of the kitchen.

I'm not talking about ordering fried rice and fried egg rolls, I'm talking about exploring their specialty section. \\n\\nTo be perfectly honest, I've never looked at their menu. The dishes we order are brought to us by our dear friend - some of the dishes are even inspired by his suggestions. So if you're lucky enough to know someone who can order it for you, or if you can get along with staff, there are a number of dishes we always order that you should definitely taste (I believe these are pretty standard, and you should be able to describe it to them):\\n\\n1. Black-pepper steak: This comes out sizzling hot. Literally. While you may need to cut up the meat into smaller bite sizes, the savory sauce is just phenomenal. \\n2. Japanese Tofu with pork sauce: This is actually my favorite dish of all, and I can eat it alone and by myself (too bad I always have to share). The tofu is super tender, and I can spoon the sauce right into my mouth by itself or let it seep over my white rice. My preferred way is just inhaling everything.\\n3. Snow pea leaves with thousand year egg: they might not always have this one as it depends on what they can pick up from their vendors. This does come with a broth that goes great with rice. \\n4. Chicken with bacon and Chinese sausage: Another favorite in our group, but I confess, I get this one mostly for the bacon and sausage. I grew up on the stuff, always sneaking bites when my mother was cooking, it's too good to pass up. \\n\\nThere are plenty more dishes. If you decide to go, hit me up and I'll help you order. We've been coming here for years.\\n\\nNote that the dishes I mention are family style. This is a very traditional way of eating in our culture - you get a bunch of entrees, a bucket of white rice, and you share your food with your friends and family. You can also play chopstick wars when it's down to the last bite.\\n\\nHope you enjoy!"},{"name":"The Globe","address":"2045 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'm giving it 3 stars because the martinis are microscopic with a price that's astronomic for the amount they pour.

Most of the restaurants are pizza or other fast food/delivery joints that have great food (I've tried most of them!) but aren't what you would consider a \\"date\\" restaurant.  \\n\\nWe managed to find parking on the street and walked to Pintxo Pincho.  At first, we were a little confused by the entrance to the restaurant.  There was no obvious sign that told us which was the entrance.  There was a little 8.5x11 sign that read Pintxo Pincho, but that was all!  After the momentary confusion, we decided to try out the door and was transported to Pintxo Pincho.  The atmosphere was warm and so cozy! (Definitely a plus after this never ending winter).  We were seated and welcomed immediately.  \\n\\nBecause it was our first time having Tapas, we left everything up to the owner, Pepe.  He recommended an excellent bottle of Spanish red, which got better and better with each course we ate.  He recommended that we get small plates rather than a paella, since it was our first time, and I quickly realized that my tapas selections would be amazing based on the noises of ecstatic approval he would make whenever I chose a particular dish.\\n\\nWe ended up having:\\n\\nthe Iberico ham (these pigs eat only acorns.  ACORNS!)\\nthe blood sausage on grilled bread (didn't taste anything like what i'd imagined.  Super delish)\\nthe chorizo with manchego cheese (chorizo is house made and amazing)\\nthe shrimp in spicy garlic oil (the aroma was mouth-watering.  i ended up dipping my bread in the oil, then putting the shrimp on top!)\\nthe quail legs in garlic oil (so crispy, and flavorful)\\nthe cerviche (which  O.H. ate, and he doesn't like seafood that much!)\\nthe hot pot croquettes (crispy bites of delicious shredded meat)\\n\\nWe also got two complimentary servings of their pintxo dishes.  One was a tomato and pepper on toast, the other was potatoes in garlic aioli.  \\n\\nThis restaurant was so laid back and welcoming.  We were warned by Pepe that later on in the week (Wed-Sat) it can get very busy and that we had chosen a great day to try out Tapas.  \\n\\nIf you have never had tapas, I'd recommend you come to Pintxo Pincho earlier on the week.  Grab a bottle of wine (it's worth the $, and you can take any leftovers home, if you have any!) order a bunch of pintxo or tapas, and be amazed at the conversation you'll have as you savor the plates!

But the very surprising thing was that 2-pages of their large menu was dedicated to promoting their outstanding pizza, with multiple topping combos, piping hot 4 cheese blend.  \\n\\nI believe BJs would be better served by instead of paying their menu authors they consulted a cook from Pizzeria-UNO , Genos East or Lou Malnatis to give them a hint what Chicago-style pizza was like.\\n\\nyuck yuck yuck\\n\\n2 stars given for beer, but their in-house brews were more expensive than the commercial brands, which is a little disappointing, since that is a small incentive to try the home-brewed beer\\n\\nService is good, but extremely choreographed, as they ask if you if things are OK, bordering on pestering.

We went tonight with our two children because I happened to get a $50 coupon through work and I enjoyed our last visits.\\n\\nLet me first say that the people really could not have been more nice.  The hostess was super friendly and our waiter was also helpful, friendly and attentive.\\n\\nBut...unfortunately the issues start with some of the food.  We ordered the fennel salad, calamari and scallop starters.  I can get over the portion size that some people mention here as the presentation was really beautiful.  High expectations.  But one bite of the fennel salad and the excess truffle oil just crushed that dish.  A simply dressed salad would have been perfect.  It was beyond unfortunate.\\n\\nThe scallops were up next.  I think these things were frozen and/or severely overcooked.  They were bouncy little hockey pucks.  Also a real shame because the plate looked great.  The caper sauce was nice but no way to overcome the poorly executed scallop.  Calamari was decent.\\n\\nFor main courses my wife had seafood risotto which was pretty skimpy on the seafood and the rice was overcooked IMO.  I had the grilled trout, which was also overcooked but edible because I was hungry since we didnt finish our small-sized apps.\\n\\nKids had spaghetti.\\n\\nSo, at this point the 2 most egregious events occurred.  I can get over a poor meal with good service.  Maybe there was a new guy in the back.  So the bill comes out and it's ~$180.  I pull out the coupon, which in retrospect must have happened in slow motion for this guy b/c my wife said the look on his face was priceless.  Whatever...the restaurant chooses to participate in these things.\\n\\nEgregious thing #1 - bill comes back and the waiter has added 20% gratuity to my pre-discount total.  For a party of 4.  Two of which are kids under 7.  Say what?!?  We eat dinner out 4 nights a week - I get tipping on a pre-discount total.  Don't insult your clients.\\n\\nEgregious thing #2 - thing #1 made me look back at the bill and realize that the bowl of plain spaghetti with butter for our kids cost $20.50.  Um...yeah.  Not $6 each.  Not even $14 for a split plate of plain pasta.  $20.50.  I've paid less than that at a Batali restaurant.\\n\\nSo - the final 5 minutes kinda compounded the food issues.  I can't imagine going back with so many good restaurants in Austin now.\\n\\nAndiamo - you choose to do things like restaurant.com.  Don't punish your patrons by taking your offer.  I wanted to like it and I'm sure there are great things on the menu, just nothing we ordered and the $20 kids spaghetti just seems crazy.

So even if you have the worst service you still pay the 20%. When we asked about the gratuity we were told it's common in a lot of places. The only time I've ever seen that is with a group of 6 or more people, which I understand, not when there are only 3 of us. What happened to the days when the waiter asked split checks or together?

I was not disappointed by the quality of the food or the menu. \\n\\nThis restaurant is in the vein of trendy downtown eateries, unique interior, and classed up comfort food. The ambiance is modern, yet at certain times I got a nostalgic \\"diner\\" feeling. We had a large group so we sat at the long high-top tables which were comfortable for both our group size (around 20) and our server to maneuver around. \\n\\nFor dinner my husband and I ordered the potato chips and I seriously could not get enough of the root beer onion dip. The chips were light and flavorful, but not greasy, and the dip was a divine light texture with a subtle hint of sweet root beer. My husband had the double on a gluten free bread and I had the trio. I ranked my trio in this order: Best: rBQ: flavorful slaw and bbq sauce, 2nd: Butcher's Cut (not sure I could have handled an entire large burger of it, but as a mini it was perfect), 3rd: the Fried Chicken, which is exactly that, a little friend chicken cutlet with sauce (sans the B&B pickles which I am not a fan of in any venue). I snitched a few of my husbands beef fat fries and languished them in the smoked mayo.\\n\\nEveryone was happy with their meals and devoured almost every bite. Some people ordered the trio of sides which I will admit I think was too much food. I think those could be cut down to more of a \\"1 & 1/2\\" a regular size in total and be more manageable (I know it's weird to ask for LESS food). I did not get to try a shake, but that was only for calorie concerns.\\n\\nOverall I enjoyed my time at Flip and do plan to come back and try the steak tartar burger (I couldn't bring myself to devour raw beef in front of casual friends) though I did feel the restaurant had a bit of a worn feeling with chipped plates and a fairly noticeable water stain on the ceiling."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place was awesome.

Frankly, I've never understood people that go out on Friday or Saturday and then complain about the service. Especially, to a small restaurant that is obviously family run. \\n\\nWe started with an order of the Spicy Tuna Poky & some edamame. The Poky was excellent. Yes it was spicy but damn it they call it \\"Spicy\\" on the menu so if your taste buds are offended by anything spicier than vanilla ice cream maybe you shouldn't order it. \\n\\nWe then ordered a couple of their special rolls, the Wild Boy and Spicy Volcano, along with Philadelphia roll. Each was cut into six nice sized pieces. The Spicy Volcano was a little disappointing. After having the Spicy Poky I was expecting something with more bite. The Spicy Volcano was much less spicy than the Poky almost to the point of being bland. It was welll prepared and presented in a interesting fashion so I would recommend it even though I won't be ordering it again. \\n\\nThe Wild Boy isn't very wild but it was tasty and well prepared. The Wild Boy is deep fried and the roll was crispy on the outside with no residual oiliness from the deep fryer. \\n\\nThe Philly roll was good but nothing to write home about after all it's just a Philly roll. \\n\\nWould I go back? Yes & no. If I was in the neighborhood I wouldn't hesitate to eat there again. But, there are several equally competent or better sushi purveyors that are closer to my house. \\n\\nThe service was friendly and competent. The place was clean.

Restaurants that offer this kind of quality food, atmosphere, and flavour at this price point are few and far between in this beautiful city. \\n\\nThis review is not for one single visit, but for many over the past few years. I cannot say enough about the quality of food at this restaurant. They have all the French classics that one would expect to find in a French bistro, and they do it right. From the Duck confit and Boef Bourguignon to the Steak Frites and Onion Soup. \\n\\nBut the unsung heroes in this establishment are the daily specials!! Get there early so you can have an array of choices. LFB's chalkboard specials are among the best in the city and are only rivaled by its regular menu offerings. I won't bother raving about specific specials because that would be cruel considering there are no guarantees that they will do them again. \\n\\nMy wife ONLY get the Steak Frites which are paired with delicious frites and a deadly sinful garlic aioli (the steak is ALWAYS done a perfect med-rare). My fav appy is the Country Pate. While it comes with crostinis, you could eat it by itself with a spoon and be content. \\n\\nWe love how bar seating is first come first serve (better make resos if you want a guaranteed table on a weekend). The service is pretty \\"French\\": not the friendliest, but sticklers for quality and promptness.

Red Robin recently (maybe less recently than I thought? I haven't been to a RR in FOREVER) revamped their menu as well as their overall feel.

I just LOVE these burgers (and the shakes...you cannot forget the shakes).\\n\\nToday, I was a woman on a mission.  Blais has a You Tube series called Burger Lab (in it's 2nd season) and finally I was going to get to taste one of these crazy-brilliant concoctions.  You see, for May and June (2013), the restaurant is featuring the burger from the featured video as the special each week.  Today was the IKEA Burger (insert assemble-yourself or horsemeat joke here).  \\n\\nThink Swedish Meatball meets burger goodness.  Add Mashed Potato \\"butter\\" (I had to skip as it has smoked cod roe in it), Lingonberry jam, topped with cucumbers, beet pickles, and gjetost (a goat cheese that was sort of nutty and shredded on top) and it was supposed to be on a dilled bun (ours had no dill on it).  See the video here (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiK9_XQq228&feature=share&list=PLoQjqpg_6bCM0VXf2598A283YB3EG6o66)\\n\\nIt was crazy delicious, however the beets were slippery and were falling off and I would have liked more of the lingonberry on it.  But I got the Swedish meatball flavor - I love to make Swedish meatballs at home, so I knew what I was tasting for.\\n\\nI also ordered one of my favored sides, the fried okra with the sriracha aioli.  I mean, seriously folks, how can you go wrong with this combo?  It was more battered than I had it the last time, but it was still amazing.  They pop in your mouth and then the aioli just kicks your taste buds into overdrive.  I couldn't finish them and I almost cried.\\n\\nNow for my shake selection - Strawberry Shortcake.  Now look - Blais and company, you are missing out.  Strawberry ShortShake.  C'mon - easy one. How did you miss this opportunity?  Anyway, a strawberry shake, chunks of real strawberries, and sliced bits of shortcake - on the top of the shake and on the bottom of the shake.  Topped with whipped cream and a strawberry slice.

It wasn't an easy decision, but the wife and I decided to share the Phat Club and the Saussy Cock.  \\n\\nI went after the club first.  Nothing unusual here other than replacing the bread with doughnuts, but still one of the better club sandwiches I've had.  I was thoroughly enjoying it until I set it down and took my first bite of the Saussy Cock.

The server made little apology for the wait, and only offered to comp corkage - which did not apply as we did not bring any drinks.

For nigiri sushi, I ve had kanpachi(amberjack) nigiri, toro(tuna belly), ika(squid) with shiso leaf, uni (sea urchin), aji(horse mackerel), kohada(marinated gizzard shad) and saba(jack mackerel). For hosomaki, I've had ika(squid) with natto, ume(pickled plum paste) with shiso leaves. Gotta say that the kanpachi is really great, the fat of the fish binds with the tender texture, creating a masterpiece. The marinated gizzard shad is also fairly great, it doesn't tastes fishy at all, there is a saying in japan when a sushi chef can make good kohada nigiri, they can make great sushi. The uni is sweet and creamy, note that the piece is performed in nigiri style, its never easy to form the uni with nigiri style as they are soft and fragile, they might break easily which again tells us that taisho yuji got some skills. This is also one of the few place to eat raw saba in Vancouver, the saba again is not fishy and it's pretty good too. While the toro nigiri is kinda surprising, its not albacore but the price is similar to the albacore belly so its pretty good too, the fat in the fish is not overwhelming but the taste of the fish is not strong enough to balance the whole flavor of the fish. For the hosomaki, there is a regret on the ume shiso maki, the plum sauce in the roll is way too salty, I have to tune down the saltiness with sake and tea. The natto ika roll is on the average, though not everyone could take the weird taste and slimy texture of the natto I think its still recommendable.

I got a dish that was suppose to have ginger in it and I bet you money there was no ginger added. Even the chai tea at the end of the meal was very bland. I mean wheres the cardamon?

We started with what was supposed to be White Queso Dip but was clearly yellow Velveeta w/ two jalapeno's and a heaping spoon full of tomatoes in the middle (supposed to be pico de gallo). The cheese dip could have been made better at home and on top of that it was cold, they comped it so no harm no foul! We then got the Avocado/Cilantro Spring Rolls which even for a person who likes Avocado had waaaay too much avocado! That may sound weird considering IT IS an avocado spring roll but there was nothing else in the roll but avocado and A LOT of to say the least, this is really a personal preference more than anything though because they were cooked and seasoned well with a good dipping sauce.Now it's Taco Time.... I tried the Baja (fried fish/spicy mayo), Rich Man's (filet tips/cotija cheese) & the Asado Zing (Korean Bulgogi/shitake mushrooms/soy & sesame vinaigrette). My girl had the Aloha (teriyaki chicken/sriracha sauce), Pacific Rim (chili crusted Mahi Mahi/Hoisin lime aioli). All the tacos were very good but the stars were definitely the Baja, Asad Zing & the Aloha. The Rich Man's taco wasn't worth the extra fifty cents especially considering the Asada Zing is REAL Korean Bulgogi (marinated steak) and was way more flavorful! The fried fish was tempura battered, fried well and was complemented well w/ the spicy mayo. The Asada Zing for me was the BEST w/ well cooked, well flavored steak and a delicious soy-sesame vinaigrette! My girl liked the Aloha Taco the best because there was a ton of teriyaki chicken and the pineapple pico de gallo was excellent!! The service wasn't the best but could be easily fixed with a few better/stronger servers and a little knowledge of the menu, we waited for refills and the kitchen was a little slow but still an overall enjoyable experience. BIG highlight was the desert of S'mores Egg Roll which was DYNAMITE and a nice ending to the meal.

There will be a flat bread/tortilla style item used to wrap the lamb with. The lamb itself was tender and pretty flavorful.

Austin isn't big on fried chicken so it was a bit harder to find. \\n\\nCute little corner spot. Parking is a bit iffy here. Its all metered or garage. Pay those meters! (free on Sundays though) \\n\\n2/2 - Food\\nFried chicken speaks to my soul. Every type of unique in its flavor, seasoning and breading. Gus's fried chicken offers a super mild spicy fried chicken with a crispy layer of skin. As you hear the crunch as you break into the skin, you're thinking 'Wow, did I really just make all that noise biting into a chicken leg?!' then you hit the meat and its mind-blowing. The savoriness with the spicy seasoning works so well together, its TOO good. Next, the fixin's.... 100% get the mac + cheese, gooey cheesy goodness. The greens were good but lacked a bit of flavor for me (Missing neck bones), the beans (made with pork) were your typically sweet beans with a typical creamy slaw. \\n\\n1/1 - Value \\nWe got a half chicken, PLUS ordered a 2 piece dark meat snack, a small order of greens + a medium mac with one drink and it rung up to be less than $30 ... You can't complain about quality fried chicken, it came out to be like $3 piece, which is slightly pricey but it was quality. \\n\\n1/1 Service - \\nOur server was awesome, super attentive, came around just the perfect amount of times without hovering over me as I looked like a slob eating this chicken. Thanks dude. \\n\\n1/1 - Atmosphere\\nOnce you walk in, you definitely get transported back in time with all these cool, awesome neon lights and signs. 100% come early, I got lucky strolling in on a Sunday at 1130AM.

The result was a very tall, drippy sandwich packed with bad-for-you burgery goodness. The bun was fresh, soft and completely covered in sesame seeds. The patties stuck out the sides showing off nicely crisped meat edges in the few places where the cheese hadn't melted around them. Burger heaven. Fries were a standout as well, fresh cut in-store, thicker than Mcdonalds but not \\"fat cut\\", and had the perfect crispiness. I didn't try the shake.

Everything was fantastic.  They use the wood-fired grill perfectly.  My favorite was the sweetbreads, but these were all hits with the table.\\n\\nJust so you're clear, these are small dishes.  If you're hungry, you will need 3 dishes to get there.  So, it's not cheap.  But, in my experience, you can easily spend over $100 per person to get food of this quality in other cities.

I mean, sure, dimsum is small plates as well - but $2-$5/plate at HeiLaMoon vs. the $10-$20 at M+C...\\n\\nGotta say, though, M+C does reinterpreted Chinese (Asian?) cuisine well.    Sweet mussels were a good size and steeped in a fragrant, tangy lemongrass broth.  The spareribs were so tender the meat slid right off the bone; the first layer of sweet and smoky flavor gave way to a spicy and citrusy finish.  Oyster omelet, beef chow fun, and dandan noodles were all standardly good, although I will say that my Chinese tastebuds prefer the sweet greasiness of the chow fun in Chinatown.\\n\\nDecor is as every other review says - Chinatown meets mod meets diner.

My big problem was with ordering and paying for food.

Hopdoddy is wildly overrated. They tout locally sourced meat all over their signage, but it's not until you get to the counter that your realize there's an upcharge to get the good stuff. Their setup is also absolutely insane. If it's crowded, there's a line out the door, so you know you just have to get in it. If it's not crowded, it's confusing trying to figure out where to order, where to get drinks, where to get water, etc. My first time there, I asked a waitress, after sitting down if I should get my own water, and if so, where it was, or if she got it for me. She told me \\"You can get it ... or I can get it for you.\\" Uhhhh... I'm sorry, is this your first day?\\nOn top of all that, the burgers aren't even outrageously good. They're average.

The side take-out door has always been a little strange and I'm not sure if it's still cash only but that sucked along with waiting awhile for your order well after it's been called in, especially on a busier night.  Most pizza places nowadays are Greek style and it's nice to be able to still get Santarpio's when I'm in or around the airport.  The pizza has not changed as long as I can remember.

That is a simple but very nice touch that is often overlooked.\\n\\nAfter double checking that none of the relish or mustard would spill, I took my first bite. It was scalding hot but pretty good. Honestly, it was not as good as I thought it would be. It's a good quality hot dog, don't get me wrong but it's way too big. I love the quality but it's just too much. It makes it very hard to eat. One's mouth just isn't wide or large enough to fit the width of the bun and the dog easily. It was a tricky operation just to get through half of it at which point I gave up. I just couldn't stomach that much meat (no pun intended.). The bun is fresh and nicely toasted which also makes it tricky because it won't bend as you bite and thus helps create a bigger mess.\\n\\nIt was ok. I guess it definitely is a better hot dog than the average one you can get elsewhere but nothing rave-worthy either.\\n\\nAlso their relish isn't pickle relish which wasn't mentioned anywhere and which was disappointing.

We had been disappointed before after arriving and they were out on one visit.  Understandable because it's an amazingly popular dish. It's the only thing we eat when we go there.  Soooo good. They said they had them and we got there 15 mins later.  It took about 5 minutes to get greeted, another 5 minutes before we got our waters.  Ordered a couple apps and double checked with the server to make sure they still had mussels. She went to check and they did so we ordered 4 bowls of mussels and 3 baskets of garlic naan. Sooooo 20 mins later, our server came up and said they were out of mussels but she left the garlic naan on the table. 20 minutes AFTER we ordered the mussels. Obviously she forgot to ring in our order and they ran out by the time she remembered it. So we ordered some vindaloo and some other dish I can't remember.  We didn't order naan because we were getting rice.  The food was good, of course, but the server didn't tell a manager what had transpired.  She could tell we were upset.  We got charged for the naan that was still untouched on the table. Saw the waitress only twice after the food hit the table.  She dropped the check then came back to pay us out. So total disappointment for my family visiting and a disappointing lunch with horrible service.  They weren't big Indian food fans, but they love seafood and were excited to try it.  \\n\\nTo top it off, we wrote an email explaining what had transpired and to see if we could get a credit for the $11 worth of naan.  It was an $80 tab. We didn't have time to track down the manger when we were there because it took 45 minutes to get food and my fam had to get to the airport and they thought lunch would only take an hour. The email was polite and we mentioned how much we love the clay pit and how much we have loved going there for 9 years.  The manager never responded.  No apology and certainly no appreciation for being loyal customers.   We have decided to find another place to celebrate our special occasions.\\n\\nTo Clay Pit Manager/Owner: really classy to not respond to the email"},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Pizza is great, brick oven style.

It had to be BBQ of course!\\n\\nSo I am going to start this review with a bit of sacrilege.  Lockhart BBQ is overrated and the leader of that overrated pack is Black's BBQ.  I have eaten at each location multiple times to give them a fair shake and the only one I would return to would be Kruetz's.  \\n\\nThat being said I am a man that loves to try BBQ and so even with the lackluster surname I decided to see if Terry had figured out how to do what his kin could not.\\n\\nAND HOT DAMN HE PULLED IT OFF!\\n\\nKym and I each ordered the lunch plate which came with 1 meat and 2 sides but we each added a pork rib and she added a banana pudding as well.\\n\\nMeat: \\nBrisket.  2nd best brisket in town behind JMueller Meat Company.  The thing that Terry Black and John Mueller understand that what makes a good brisket is the bark.  Without a good heavy bark the low and slow cooking just turns it into a pot roast consistency.  One thing they do win on is the Burnt Ends.  They had the best burnt end of a brisket in town.  Also your meat cutter is 1 foot away from you so you get to have an input in your cut of meat.  \\nPork Ribs.  Peppery.  Flavorful.  I actually wished I had more than 1 of these even though I was about to explode when we left.  The meat had a crisp pepper coating but the meat was tender and fell off the bone as soon as you sink your teeth into it.  You cannot go wrong with the Pork Ribs.\\n\\nSides:\\nMac and Cheese.  They duped me here, I grabbed mac and cheese because they were putting out fresh slaw and I did not see it at the end of the sides.  The mac and cheese was super cheesy and it actually got better after it was out from under the warming light.  It thickened up and was down right gooey.  Not a bad option but...\\nPotato Salad.  Awesome.  Period.  This is true Texas potato salad.  This will be a staple of any visit.  \\nCole Slaw.  Looked amazing, and some people sitting at our table  raved about it.  You can tell a good Cole slaw by looking at it.  Trust me just get it.\\n\\nDessert:\\nBanana Pudding. Amazing.  As I put in the Tips section this is the best banana pudding I have ever had.  Disclaimer I generally hate banana pudding because most people take the pudding part to literal and it comes out like box pudding with whipped cream and nilla wafers stuck in it.  These were chucks of banana in more of a sauce than a pudding with a light but thick coat of whipped cream and crunchy nilla wafers.  I meant to include a photo but we ate half of it before I remembered.  Sorry Yelp but trust me its worth the indulgence.\\n\\nMisc.\\nPrice was decent.  Service was fast.  The meat cutter and cashier were super friendly.  Seating is family style which was fun because we got to talk BBQ with some tourist in town for ComiCon.  \\n\\nI gotta bring Matt C here so I will be back soon and probably often."},{"name":"Ebi-Ten","address":"388 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"When I lived in Japan, one of my favourite places for lunch was a little cafe that specialized in ten-don bowls.

They also offer take-away sushi, if you like BC rolls and California rolls.\\n\\nIf you can find a seat, it's a pleasant place to eat in.

My siblings and I went to Portland over the weekend and this food truck was at the top of our list of places to visit, having seen it on the food network. We ordered the fiesta plate, which had one piece of boneless chicken thigh, two shrimp patties and a heaping scoop of red rice. We also ordered kelaguen with titiyas, lumpia and empanadas. The chicken thigh lacked in flavor and was dry! The shrimp patties actually needed MORE shrimp, and the red rice was all mushy and had no taste. Red rice is supposed to be SO GOOD that you can eat it by itself, but I found myself pouring finadene all over it just to finish it. To make a long story short, for all of us Chamorros, Filipinos, Chuukese, Palauans and all the Micronesian islanders out there who grew up on Guam, SKIP everything else and just go with the Kelaguen and Finadene. These two were the most legit items on the menu. And if you're wondering what the heck you're going to eat the Finadene with, bring it home and save it for when you make your own barbecue chicken :) \\n\\nHere are the pros:\\n\\n- Really good customer service by the guys working there.

I relaxed enough to order my first glass of wine, a scrumptious Cab from California (OK not an adventurous choice, but it did turn out to be a very good one), after the wine hit me I almost forgot about the group at the other end of the table and just set about enjoying the gorgeously prepared food that began appearing at our table.\\n\\nI had so much fun trying all the various dishes we ordered.  J got three dishes, I got three, and K got four, so all told we had about 9 different dishes to try.  The highlights for me were the fruits and vegetables; the mushrooms, the green beans, the mangoes, the beets, the onions, the potatoes and mints and strawberries...   Unlike eating at most restaurants, each fruit or vegetable was served in small quantities, prepared and paired in such a way so as to spotlight the truly distinct and delicious flavors that each posses.   It was like taking a spot light and letting the members of the chorus each have a solo.  All those \\"Side dishes\\" were suddenly stars and boy did they shine!\\n\\nI did run into a couple things that were not to my taste but, hey, that just made me appreciate the good stuff even more (there was this goat cheese that, if we hadn't been in a public place... well,  that was cheese like no other cheese I have ever tasted.  That was cheese you take home where you can be alone in a dark place with candles lit, and you don't eat it so much as you do wonderfully naughty, naughty things with that cheese...\\n\\nOk sorry I got distracted thinking about cheese, it happens.\\n\\nAnyway, I loved Barley Swine in spite of the eating with strangers thing.  The food made the shrinking of my personal space tolerable (or maybe it was the wine that did that, but whatever...).  I highly recommend this experience if you are willing to be open minded and try some new things.  Two things though, this place is extremely popular right now so parking and seating are limited.  Expect to drive around searching for a space and expect a nice long wait to be seated.  it will give you time to scope out the other folks waiting who will no doubt be sitting at your table!"},{"name":"Keke's Breakfast Cafe","address":"2435 S Hwy 27","city":"Clermont","stars":"4","text":"This place is clean and very open, which is important to me when I want to go out to eat with someone.

For those of you who are new to my reviews, see any other review where I have never met a beet I did not like.  \\n\\nThe burger was just \\"eh.\\"  To be honest, the burger did not have any flavor.  More like a patty of beef from the grill.  I had the farmhouse burger which was local, grass fed beef.  Now, don't get me wrong, I love me a good burger, but this was just beef formed into a patty without any seasoning.  To test whether I was just having another moment of my picky eater syndrome, I asked Jeff if he liked his burger.  He was the same, \\"eh...what's all the fuss about.\\"  The fries had a tasty sea salt mixture on the outside but were way too soggy for my taste.

We ordered a family pack of 16 piece chicken with large mac n cheese and large fries on the side. After realizing we wanted to eat more, we just upped our order to the 20 piece chicken without paying the a la carte price. We even changed our order like 3 times and our waiter was just so terrificly patient and understanding. he left a water pitcher at our table and enough cutlery etc etc and did everything to make sure that we were taken care of and enjoying our food.\\nthe chicken itself was juicy and very hot, and the breading was mildly spicy and delicious! The family pack was served with some white bread, and we were allowed to ask for all dark pieces (where else does that???). The pieces themselves were on the small side, so i would probably order maybe one piece more per person than you think you'd usually eat for fried chicken. The mac n cheese was thick and creamy (put some tabasco in it; its a good smoky kick!), but the fries were standard. if you're not sure about the sizes of the sides, they have examples taped up on the wall.\\nin the end we ended up paying less than $10 per person including tip, so its definitely not overpriced to eat here.

Yes, it's a small chain (originally from Charlotte) but they make the oddly fused concepts of burgers and sushi totally work. Why yes, I would love a side of spicy tuna with my jalepeno burger. It totally works.\\n\\nExecution and service here is wonderful. All the details about their menu, service, and decor are impressive. Personally, I am a big fan of their bento boxes which provide a huge sampling of food for a very reasonable price. The kids bento boxes are even more impressive than the adult version! For $6 or $7, you can choose from the usual fare of mini burgers and chicken fingers to vegetarian rolls and peanut butter jelly sandwiches rolled up to mimic sushi. So creative! (Note: the mac and cheez is not great so I would try another kid option.) They also offer a great diversity of 2 side options for kids including edamame, fries, apples, carrots, and oranges. Another additional bonus is that they have a fun rice crispy treat with swedish fish on top to resemble a bite of sushi. So fun! (My 5yo was so excited!) And to top it off? Each kids menu comes with a drink, tattoo, coloring sheet, crayons, and chopsticks holders so children who aren't familiar with holding chopsticks can also partake in this common Asian utensil.\\n\\nI've tried a lot of different things off their menu but the following are my favorites: Parmesan bacon truffle fries (YUMMMY), spicy poke dip, jalepeno popper burger, and volcanic sushi roll. I also love the thai cucumbers that come in the bento boxes but beware! Cilantro is involved, which I love (husband not so much). Def also splurge on the fusion bento box which is $2 more and provides a specialty mini burger (instead of plain cheeseburger) and more complex sushi roll options instead of just california or spicy tuna."},{"name":"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews","address":"13000 N Interstate 35 Bldg","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"This is just another chain restaurant like TGI Fridays, Apple Bees or Chilis.

The potato cakes were good although I put Izzy's in Cincinnati ahead on that. The applesauce was tremendous as well. Of course you can't finish a meal here without one their cream puffs.

Seemed like they just threw something out there but I guess I will give them the benefit out the doubt that a huge rush just beat us there.  \\n\\nWe got up to finally order about 8:30(they closed at 9) they were out of everything but brisket and sausage.  They should have just said we are out of everything but I will get to that.  As a side I got the cream corn which was hands down the best cream corn I have had in my life.   It was so good and I wish I had gotten much more. \\n\\nThe meat was terrible.  It was the worst brisket I have ever had.  I'm guessing that because it was the end of the night that they just threw out all they had.  I really wish they had not.  We went with 1 lb of brisket to share for the 3 of us(we all got different sides as well. Which all were good.) and I bet we didn't eat an 8th of the lb.  It was terribly dry.  I will say that Texas BBQ sauce is much different that I am used to but I like the sauce at The Salt Lick so I didn't expect a problem.  I did not like this sauce.  I don't know what it was.  I'm guessing that if I had that might have helped with the dry brisket but as it was it wasn't much help.  \\n\\nEveryone working however was really nice and very helpful.

I went in for lunch service on 9.19.08 Friday. The restaurant itself appears to be clean and your typical japanese style type restaurant with a contemporary look.

I immediately asked the server if they could take it off my bill because I didn't want to pay that much for imitation, he was nice about until he walked into the doors and I could immediately hear him complaining to his other co-workers as the door was still shutting. \\n\\nSo there you have it, a sushi bar that serves imitation crab.... \\n\\nbottom line if you want something that is just OKAY for high prices then this is the place for you. \\n\\nIf you want great sushi go elsewhere like Zanmais."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Amazing!

Congrats, Myers & Chang, you made it onto my list of all time favorite restaurants. \\n\\nHow did I get here? Well, I had a colossal craving for bao, and turned to Yelp to seek places to satisfy it, and settled on this place. It may not be cheap, but I am okay paying a premium price if I get what I pay for, which I sure did. \\n\\nI went on a Friday night, it was pretty crowded, but I was seated right away at the \\"bar\\" well, instead of making drinks there, they make the food in their open kitchen, right in front of you! (which is pretty fun to watch, I might add).\\n\\nWhile I usually talk about service towards the end of my reviews, I feel it worth mentioning at this point. My server Xavier N. (per the receipt) was incredible! Despite the restaurants brimming with guests, he was still extremely attentive. He made sure I was never just sitting there waiting for something (unless it was for food). Speaking of the wait, out of the two dishes and one dessert I had ordered, all three took 7 minutes or less to arrive after I had ordered them (yes, I timed it - discreetly, with my watch, not my phone)\\n\\n Water was brought right away, and when the pitcher was nearly empty, rather than wait, he brought a new one right away. There were also others in the restaurant making sure I was satisfied at all point during my experience. \\n\\n...Also, in the process of ordering, I asked about the \\"Asian Pickles\\". While it seemed interesting, I elected not to go with that option. What I did was, not knowing how much would fit in me (I didn't come very hungry) I started off with only the bao, and told the waiter if I had room I would go for the tacos as well. \\n\\nAnd now I can get into the food! \\n\\nAsian Pickles (which are an assortment of seasonal pickled vegetables) were brought to me as a gift from the kitchen. I was absolutely delighted that they would do this... even at the risk that I would be fuller, and less likely to order the tacos (which I would be paying for). What I was really impressed with in this dish was how pleasant the brine is they use to pickle the vegetables. It is slightly acidic, but it does so with a little tang and a little sweetness too! Had you asked me before, I probably wouldn't have said picked cauliflower (among other goodies) was very good. Now, I will tell you \\"Depends on how it's made!\\"\\n\\nNow, for the pork belly bao. This was something truly incredible... the pork belly was so tender and delicate, it melted in your mouth. The bun was really soft and delicate, and the sauce which came with the pork belly was gently sweet, and added to the overall divine texture. I liked the use of daikon (I think) as a vegetable element to add a little crispiness, and I liked that there were a tiny amount of jalapenos on the side if you want to add some spice. \\n\\nUnfortunately, I do have to add criticisms to the above dish. My first is that there was a lack of vegetable in the bao. If you looked at some of the pictures on here, then it was less than that. There was one slice of daikon and a teeny amount of lettuce. Also, it would have been nice to have a little more jalapeno on the side, in case a customer wants it a little more on the spicy side. \\n\\nWhen I was finished, the waiter asked me if I wanted the tacos (his remembering was cool), and I said yes. The tacos were delicious also. The fish was very soft, and piping hot! obviously not from under a lamp. I don't quite remember what the other ingredients in the tacos were, but I remember that everything in them went together very nicely. I mean this not only in the balance of flavors, but in textures too. There was some soft, some crunchy, some hot, and some colder. I was also amazed at how they filled them just right so that you get the right amount of ingredients without the taco falling apart. It is a little spicy, but just enough to contrast with the sweetness of the bao, not nearly spicy enough to overwhelm anything. \\n\\nFinally, I still had room for dessert, and got the sticky toffee pudding cake. This dish had some pretty cool stuff going on. First, you get a pretty good sized slice of cake! As for the flavors, while the cake is soft and sweet, they do a wonderful job of balancing it out. They add some walnuts and pomegranate brittle for crunch, and some pomegranate seeds for some tartness. What I really found impressive though, was that you did not have to spit the seeds out, you could eat them without a problem. Don't know how this is achieved, but I am impressed.\\n\\nLocation is clean, of course.\\n\\nWill return!\\n\\nFinally...YAY! this is my 250th review."},{"name":"Babica Hen Cafe","address":"15964 Boones Ferry Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"Popular for a reason?

I love the new location and had been coming for a year before the new location. My favorite is the Lox sandwich. Super yummy when it's made right. And right there is why I'm only able to give it three stars. The first few times I'd even here (old location) I got the Lox sandwich. I was pretty bummed out because the onion was cut so thick it was like biting into an apple. Being they use red onions that's a LOT of flavor and heat for it to be sliced that big. So I had to remove them. I got into the habit of asking if my onion could be sliced thinly, and although they obliged me, I am usually met with bewilderment, angst and perturbation by the employees. On some occasions I'd have an employee who totally got it and was happy to make it happen, but usually I felt like I was being difficult for asking such a reasonable request. The last few times I've been I got the sense that it was not a problem and I was weird for even feeling the need to ask so this visit I'm writing about now, I didn't ask. I got a pile of onion that when stacked up was larger than the one half of the sandwich. If I had left it on that would be the only thing I would taste. When an employee heard me complaining to my husband about it she offered to rectify it but I just couldn't be bothered, especially when she made excuses like \\"When it's busy sometimes the onion gets sliced think like that\\" which I know is not the case, because unless you ask them to do it otherwise you get quarter to half inch slices of red onion ALL THE TIME, slow busy or moderate paced business hours. Please fix this ongoing issue. Having worked in high end deli/restaurants when I was younger, my suggestion is to get a meat slicer and slice your onion on the slicer and then you get beautiful thinly sliced onion and CONSISTENCY so then if you have patrons who actually WANT tons and tons of onion you just add more onion. If the issue gets fixed (I'm going to write the company directly too) then I'm more than happy to give you guys a 5 star review, cause I love you guys otherwise.\\n\\n11/25   It appears that the onions are now being sliced thin without asking. I went in with some friends for lox bagel sandwiches and I asked for my onion to by sliced thin, while a buddy of mine did not ask (they were also on a separate order) and he also got onions sliced appropriately for his sandwich also. So I'm updating and changing from my 3 stars to 5 stars. Keep up the great work guys!

I am always excited when I remember what time it is and rush over there in time to order too much food for myself. Too much food is basically more than one item.

It's so nice sitting in the high ceilinged space, popping open a magazine from the many available, and being presented with a large cup and saucer of perfect coffee or a little press of tea.

Just. Wow. \\n\\nI think it was hilariously accurate of another reviewer to say of this place, \\"The food had me Yakking and I wanted to Yeti the heck out of there.\\" All hail that guy.\\n\\nAnimal Kingdom is so much fun but I think their restaurants all need serious work. I can't really comment on the food at the other restaurants as I didn't eat there, but for the most part, they looked awful. From the outside, so does Yak and Yeti, but we were hungry so we had to go somewhere.\\n\\nI'm not going to write a long scathing review here because it was nearly a month ago when we \\"dined\\" at the Y&Y. But Y oh Y did we? The menu looks so bad. Just read it. It's online somewhere. All I can say is Thank God we had the Disney Dining Plan because of what little amount of terrible food we tried to eat, the bill would have been atrocious (was $80). Ugh, let's make this quick. \\n\\nWe had Thai chili chicken wings for an appetizer. On a scale of 1 to Who Cares? They're Not Good, I'd give it a Who Cares? They're Not Good. Shockingly, this was the best part of my lunch. \\n\\nFor my meal, I had the crispy mahi mahi. I don't think it was even a real fish. There was nothing crispy about it either. Rather, it had the consistency of slime. I wish it had been flavorless. Flavorless would have been swallowable. It was like sixteen sick and sour tastes all balled up into one to form some phony, slimy plasticfish. And you want me to eat that? Well, I managed to put down about half. No matter how bad something is, I can't stand waste. Apparently I don't even like to waste waste. Stop it.\\n\\nThe fianc√©e ordered some barf salad or something. I don't remember. Oh wait yes I do! It was the tamarind chicken. That's right. My bad. At any rate, she gave the chicken a big YUCK. (This review is becoming over-the-top. Sorry, Y&Y but c'mon! Fix your food and this won't happen!)\\n\\nEven the diet cokes acted like they had committed suicide. They'd rather be lifeless decarbonated corpses of their former selves than to sit beside the bad plates on these dirty tables. \\n\\nFor dessert... listen, we had to keep getting food, it all comes with the DIsney Dining Plan... we had the Pineapple Wontons with cream cheese filling. The fianc√©e says they were good but really, at this point is anybody even caring anymore? I certainly wasn't. I just wanted to get back out there and see some monkeys. But of course first, we had to wait about forever to get the bill (still have to sign for it to chalk off those Disney Dining Plan points!). The service was less than average.\\n\\nWhy are there so many people eating here? Is this the best Animal Kingdom has to offer for sit down dining? \\n\\nWhen we finally got out of there, I saw some monkeys and managed to put the lunch behind us.

We got there early because it is PACKED at lunch time, even during the week. We were greeted immediately at the door with a shout out from all the staff (didn't understand what was said but assumed it was welcome) and told that if we wanted an individual table, there'd be a wait but seating was available at the community table. I usually have no problem eating with people I don't know but the table was way too big and tight to be slurping noodles in front of strangers. My suggestion to management: nix the big table and put in smaller tables for 4. Wait staff are extremely nice and explained everything to us newbies.\\n\\nThe menu is simple. Chose your broth flavor: miso, shio, or shoyu, cooked for hours & hours with pork belly, pork and chicken bones served with heavenly \\"hand massaged\\" perfectly cooked ramen noodles. It is absolutely delicious!!! I wouldn't change a thing about that. There are also \\"extra toppings\\" like seaweed, green onions, stir-fried veggies, tamago (soft-boiled egg), corn, butter bean sprouts, etc. My issue is the pork belly. I don't like pork belly. Never have, never will. It tends to be way too fatty for my taste. To be fair, I didn't know this was all they had on the menu but the one piece in my bowl was pretty lean (and delicious) but next time I'll ask them to leave it out.\\n\\nI ordered the basic ramen ($8): miso broth, one piece of pork belly, lots of green onions and a small sheet of nori. Absolutely wonderful...not like pho at all, but just as good. In a different way. My husband had the miso Killer Spicy Ramen ($9.50) that lived up to it's name. He's getting over a cold and was in tearing up by the time we left (a good thing). Really flushes out your sinuses.\\n\\nThere's nothing here for vegetarians or peeps who keep kosher, so stay away.

I probably would have enjoyed the meal more if I had skipped the tasting menu and just gone a la carte.\\n\\nI made a reservation some time ago, but once we arrived, we found out that they recently switched over to a tasting menu format.  $50 per person for the full tasting menu sounded pretty reasonably priced, so we said sure - why not. \\n\\nI have done tasting menus before where I thought the $125 - 200 per person I spent was totally worth it.  This $50 tasting menu per person was just OK.   My gripe about the new tasting menu format reflects a little bit about my own particular preferences, but also the pitfalls of tasting menus at Barley Swine.\\n\\n1. If you do a tasting menu format - EVERY DISH HAS GOT TO WOW.  Some were very good, some were OK, and none were 'wow'. \\n\\n2. The atmosphere, decor, wine and beer service all seem to scream for a more casual fun atmosphere.  But instead, we get a parade of different servers all given us these detailed descriptions of the 7 - 8 dishes that we had.  There was something about the experience that a was discordant - tasting menus seem more appropriate for white tablecloth restaurants where all the patrons sit at normal height seating instead of bar height counter seating, and we're all there to sit and be wowed by the food.  But we were there just to have a casual good time.  So, good food, but wrong environment for the tasting menu.  So the atmosphere seems to be made for more convivial, casual, knock-back foods instead of just lingering over individual dishes.\\n\\n3. I also did not care for the fact that every dish had to be shared between two people.   Maybe it's a cost issue,  but usually, I'm more accustomed to getting my own plate if eating the tasting menu format.\\n\\n4. I thought the food was good, but I wished that there were something heartier on the menu - lots of really tasty vegetables, but at some point, I found myself wanting a pizza or some fries to chew on.  If you're going to drink a decent amount of beer or wine, you want something to soak that up.\\n\\n5.  More generally, I have shied away from tasting menu formats, because I actually like the flexibility of ordering around the menu and constructing my own meal.  This comment might not be fair because I was not expecting a tasting menu (apparently, this format is about 2 weeks old),  and that's what we got.  \\n\\nSo... speaking as someone who has a fair amount of fine dining experience, I thought Barley Swine was just OK."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Tasty goodness!!!\\n\\nHalf the fun is waiting at the front door of Medina with all the other poor souls.

But it was more cooky (i.e. strange toppings) than the culinary magical goodness, which Blue Star provides. The first day, my bf and I ordered the \\"Pear Pine Nut Fritter\\" and \\"Dulce De Leche & Hazelnut\\" donuts. The Fritter was amazing; semi-crispy on the outside with a gooey interior, consisting of fresh pears. The thought of them sends me into a day dream about donuts clouds......

Definitely heaven in a bite. \\nOn the last day of our trip, we purposely made a trip back to get one of each flavor. The donuts endured our flight back to NY and I was pleasantly surprised that they all tasted pretty good two or three days after our purchase. \\nI would say the only con is that the donuts are a little pricey for what I would typically pay for a donut; some costing $3.25 for one.

This made ordering a little tricky, luckily I ended up with a tasty cider, but wouldn't know how to order it again in the future.\\n\\nEven though it was happy hour, there was nothing that was reasonably priced on the menu.  I ended up getting the happy hour burger ($7.50), sub impossible patty (+$4), add cheese (+$1.50), making my happy hour veggie burger $13....and there were no fries.  Granted, the burger was really good, just really overpriced.  My husband ordered a normal burger which he enjoyed as well, but he commented that he was not asked how he wanted it cooked.  Luckily it came out medium rare, which he would have ordered if he had been asked.  I asked for some mustard for my burger and after waiting patiently for awhile, I had to just go up to the counter and ask again.   \\n\\nWe ate our food and finished our beverages and had to wait quite while to get our server to bring our check.  I had my credit card sitting on the edge of the table to help signal that we were done.  While we were waiting for our check I saw a few people at other tables not receive any service.  One table got up and just left. Our server did not come to check on us once while we sat there.  She took our order and we did not see her again until she finally realized we needed our check.  \\n\\nThis would be a one star review, except the taste of the food was really good.

The presentation was gorgeous; the service was cheerful (if somewhat clueless); the decor was casual.

The space is pretty big and has a nice vibe to it with a huge wine bar (makes sense) and nice rustic wooden tables, along with outdoor seating in the summer. However, they are always packed so make sure you call ahead to make reservations if you don't want to wait for a table (the usual wait time seems to be around one hour and above). \\n\\nThe last time I came here I had an unfortunate incident with their oyster tapa, which was frozen when I put into it and tasted like eating ice. It was one of their summer specials and I was obviously disappointed by the dish and conveyed that disappointment to the waiter. Their manager came over immediately and offered us free tapas that he highly recommended and apologized for the experience. I was really very impressed with the level of service and professional I received due to the oyster incident. However, there was another hiccup in the night where our paella took 30+ minutes to come out and it seemed like they accidentally gave our dish away to another table. Once again, the wait staff was very professional and even got my friend and I another round of sangria as an apology. The food here is good, but the customer service is truly exceptional. At the end of the night, they even offered each of us a free tapa voucher for the hiccups during the meal. \\n\\nSince I've been to Barcelona quite a few times, I do have my favorites that I like to order. I've had a lovely experience with their charcuterie and cheese selection and I highly recommend ordering it if you're with a big enough group! Just choose whatever stands out to you, they're honestly all pretty good. \\n\\nThe tapas are great and I have a few consistent dishes I like to order: \\n- Jamon and Manchego Croquettes It's truly melt in your mouth goodness. The outer crunchy bite combined with the gooey inside and the most amazing garlic aioli is a combo that cannot be beaten! Plus, it's one of the cheaper tapas on the menu (Barcelona does get pricey), so this is most definitely one of my go-to dishes. \\n- Grilled Hanger Steak\\nI quite enjoy these, although fair warning it only comes with 5 pieces, so if you're in a big group make sure to order more than one. The truffle vinaigrette is outstanding and the steak is nice and tender.\\n- Spicy Eggplant Caponata\\nAn excellent dish that is reminiscent to the taste of a spicy teriyaki sauce to me. The eggplants are tender and the flavor profile is a nice differentiator from the other tapas. \\n- Patatas Bravas\\nI'll admit this dish isn't my favorite (I find I get bored of it after a few bites of potato), but it is a good dish to pick at with a large group and once again the garlic aioli is a real winner (never seems to be enough sauce in a big group tho). \\nI've ordered a few other things that were also great (they seem to change out their tapas over time), but I've had a great experience with the prawns (SO tender), these bite sized truffle sandwiches with spanish ham inside and garlic aioli (I know there's a theme here) and the beef tartare is also a nice refreshing dish!\\n\\nAlso, I will usually get their Paella Mariscos! I love the seafood in this dish, with the octopus and mussels being the real standouts to me in both flavor impact and tenderness. I find the shrimp gets a little overcooked and the clam lacks the flavor punch. The rice also gets nice and crispy if you let it cook in the skillet longer. However, I do have one gripe with this dish which is it's just a bit oversalted everytime I get it. I would say that is a theme that carries across all their dishes with a lot of things being just a touch too salty for me. But overall, Barcelona is always a good time and they have a great selection of wine (I always get the sangria!) and cocktails.

Naturally my expectations weren't very high since it was \\"bar food\\"; however, this place is known for its wing hot sauce so I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. The chicken was rubbery and the tortilla tasted like plastic. They drenched the wrap in buffalo sauce and the blue cheese was flavorless. My boyfriend ordered the Italian Stallion which he did enjoy.

Unfortunately, it makes my bar for good Mexican pretty high.\\n\\nEnter: La Superior. Like the best in San Diego's street taco/Baja scene, the tacos are a summation of flavor saturated meats and cheeses stuffed into superb handmade softshells. Their carnitas, pollo, and carne asado are all fantastic, and at something like $1.50 a taco, a really affordable treat. On the pricier end of things at $8 a plate is their chicken mole. I haven't had better--richer, spicier, smokier--anywhere outside of San Diego's Old Town. I dream of moles like La Superior's.\\n\\nIt's more of a carry-out place for us, being in the neighborhood and all. The place is low on atmosphere, but the restaurant itself reminds me of San Diego's Baja scene as much as the food does, so no complaints there. There is seating, though, and a drink cooler packed with sodas, jarritos, and I think I recall seeing cervezas in there, too.

The hash browns (diced small, and quite crispy) had chunks of barely cooked onion in them - a personal pet peeve, as that allium rush overwhelms all other flavors on my tongue for the next 5 minutes.

Again delicious! \\n\\nOur next endeavor was \\"off the menu\\" by requesting a simple \\"Spicy Crab\\" roll. I'm telling you, the sushi chef builds beautiful and tasty creations.

It was perfect!\\n\\nI also wanted to try a traditional Asian dish, so I ordered \\"Mongolian Beef\\" which is thin sliced Flank Steak, caramelized Onions, Red Peppers, Scallions, Hoisin Sauce and Chili Pepper Oil served with steamed White Rice.

I ate so much sushi during my pregnancy with him, I think that was the beginning of his love of this cuisine.  Husband and GF, not into it. Son and I shared the Fuji Boat as an appetizer - a gorgeous array of sushi and sashimi all artfully prepared and fresh as possible by the hard-working crew of sushi chefs visible in the open kitchen.  I wish I had stayed with the sushi selections for my entire meal, because the rest of what I was served - except for a surprise dessert - was truly disappointing.  The hot entrees all come with 'soup, salad, and rice'.  I chose the lemongrass chicken.  While our charming waiter David was supremely helpful and knowledgeable, the kitchen did not pace us well so that the soup and salad arrived while we were still having our apps, and the hot entrees arrived just as we were finishing off our last bit of sushi.\\n\\nThe miso soup, not very flavorful at all.  The salad, very disappointed that it was served with a too vinegary dressing and not the expected Japanese ginger-carrot dressing I love (although when I mentioned this to David at the end of the meal, he said I could have asked for it.  Who knew?)  The lemongrass chicken - a generous portion indeed, but not richly imbued enough with the lemongrass marinade.  Steamed vegetables were served with oyster sauce on the side, which helped with flavor a bit, but I left most.  Side of steamed rice, nothing unusual.  Didn't quite taste of jasmine, so not sure if it was.\\n\\nHusband and son both had steak - one the filet, the other the sirloin.  I know my son enjoyed his more - although both looked quite good, but accompanied by the same veggies and rice.\\n\\nSon's GF enjoyed her chicken tenders and noodles - not a seafood lover.\\n\\nThe birthday surprise dessert was outstanding - fried cheesecake and ice cream, garnished with dried cranberries and drizzled chocolate.  We all made short work of that.\\n\\nIn sum,  a fine beginning and end to the meal, between the sushi and the dessert.  I'd stick with those choices and pass on the hot entrees next time - if there is a next time."},{"name":"Ristorante Serena","address":"18 Lebanon St","city":"Malden","stars":"4.5","text":"Unbelievably delicious entrees.

I just didn't get that feeling you should get in a fried chicken place. I didn't like that everything came on styrofoam or cardboard with the cheapest plastic utensils and cheap paper napkins. Nor did I like that the sauces were prepacked? I couldn't cut my food and I used 10 times more napkins because they tore so easily from my greasy fingers. It was rather frustrating.

Next the JFK lobster stew which was amazing and unlike anything you can find at other restaurants. For my entree I had the lobster savannah- no way to describe it. The best lobster I've ever had, cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the portion size was just the right amount. Waiter had said it's been named one of the best 50 dishes in the country. The other awesome and out of the ordinary offering is dover sole fish. Waiter said they are one of the two restaurants in all of Boston that serves it. I'm not a fish person but tried my friends' and it was so light and delicious. Also got wine with dinner which was excellent. I can't remember what I had for dessert- it was good but the lobster savannah is all I can think about/remember. \\nMy glass was never empty, plates were cleared promptly, waiter was knowledgeable, and atmosphere is great. Definitely old school, fancy dining.  I also liked that I didn't have to scream to talk to my dining companions, even though there was 8 of us.  I think at most Boston area restaurants it gets too loud.  I would definitely recommend for a special occasion. Obviously pricey but worth the money.  Don't go trying to save money/for restaurant week, it's a place where you're going to have a big bill but it's worth it if you can afford it.

Everything was one note, with no depth of flavor. The seafood in the dish I ordered was frozen, and not fresh at all. That really detracts from a dish where seafood is the primary focus. The shellfish in the dish were still stone cold, and that also detracted. The sauce (in this case a lemon based sauce) as heavy and muddy. The Italian Wedding soup had an unpleasant thick broth, with dreadful little meatballs that were overly soft, and not seasoned at all. The red sauce on the other dish was odd, had an essence of can flavor that really wasn't nice. The four pastas that went with that dish were all the same ricotta filled variations of a theme. Boring.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we were very disappointed.

I can't think of one that's really memorable besides the berry cider that they have, and that's only sort of related to the beers. The berry cider is like a fizzy pinky-purpley glass of fruity Sprite. It's fantastic. I haven't had a beer here that I haven't liked, but I haven't had one that I'd go out of my way to seek out, either. They're all pretty simple brews--no strong flavors or complex flavor combinations. So, I suppose they're good to sip on with food. \\n\\nThe food and service at this BJ's are the bigger reasons why I'd come back. Service was attentive. Even when I've just ordered a glass of water because it was past my bedtime (hey, get off my lawn!), they made sure that it always stayed full. The food is a bit less salty and processed-tasting than many chains and for that, I'm thankful. The salmon is flavorful, flaky and huge. The deep-dish pizzas--while not a true Chicago-style deep dish--are still fantastic. They're like big, fluffy cheese breads with fabulous toppings all over.

There were two young ladies standing behind the front counter and a server happened to come up. They seemed generally clueless but seemed to  indicate that those were the day's $7.50 specials. I certainly was not lead to think otherwise.\\n\\nI was seated and eventually Eric, a different server than the one who had been at the counter, took my order explaining that the day's specials were two other types of pizzas listed in the menu which he pointed out to me. (I still was never clear if the specials on the board referred to pizzas but concluded that they did not.)\\n\\nSo I ordered the small (4-slice) Chicago Classic (which was today's special deep dish pizza) and a Coke; the Coke comes quickly and the hot pizza arrived in a timely manner.\\n\\nNow, to be fair, I'm from NYC and think NYC pizza is the be all & end all. In Pizzeria UNO's favor, the mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce and Italian sausage were all quite good; the crust, however, tasted like cardboard. Okay, a little better but not at all like NYC crust.\\n\\nSo after I finished three of the slices, Eric comes up to me and says \\"I'm really sorry but I made a mistake and those specials are only for lunch. If you want you don't have to tip me but...\\" So I said, \\"Well, why don't you talk to the manager and see what you can do.\\" Because, honestly, I thought $7.50 would be a fair price for this; the regular $12.98 is outrageous (as is the $2.99 for Coke but that's another story). \\n\\nSo Eric comes back and says that the Manager had said he would take $4 off and I said \\"Fine.\\" He goes to the cash register, the manger comes up and re-rings it, and Eric comes back saying they'd actually taken $5 which I appreciated (tho why they didn't just take $5.48 off is beyond me but I certainly wasn't gonna argue over 48 cents). I ask Eric how long he'd been working there assuming he'd say \\"a week or two\\" maybe only a few days. He replied that he had been there \\"two months\\" and added he was a student at nearby Northeastern majoring in computer studies. \\n\\nHe again apologized and I told him that given that neither he nor any of the people I initially spoke to knew what the sign out front referred to, clearly this is a managerial problem; not surprisingly, the manager didn't bother to walk the few steps over to me to apologize or even explain the situation (and the restaurant wasn't very crowded or busy at this point). It did kinda amaze me that Eric, who seemed like a smart young man, could've gone for two months working there without being told that those specials were just for lunch.\\n\\nIn any case, I paid the bill and tipped Eric what I would've originally (about 20%) since he was extremely nice and handled the situation as well as could be expected.\\n\\nBut I don't think I'll ever be going back to this or any other Pizzeria UNO.

We were hungry and ate the dishes with rice and were done with the meal when they returned with the naan. They don't seem to get it that Indian dishes are to be eaten with naan.

(We usually order from Punjab Palace because we love their dishes and have been there multiple times.)\\n\\nWe ordered around 7:45PM and the first estimated time of delivery was 8:40-8-50PM. Okay, waiting an hour sucks, but we were okay with it. Then I got an email notifying me that the delivery time was pushed back to 8:50-9PM. Nothing we could do but wait. Then the food was actually delivered 20 minutes later than the time of delivery stated. Apparently the driver was \\"stuck in traffic\\". It's hard to believe that there's traffic at 9pm especially when the place we ordered from is only 10 minutes away by car.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we were STARVING at that point. And I grabbed the food and scarfed it down. We both got Chicken Tikka Masala and an order of Garlic Naan.\\n\\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala was pretty good. I got mild and it's not spicy at all. And my boyfriend asked for Medium spicy. There was a very big difference between the two. We thought \\"Medium\\" would only be one level spicier, but it was pretty much two levels spicier than the mild. Caught us off guard, so we mixed my mild with his spicy and that was much better. I honestly wish there was more chicken though. (Punjab Palace definitely gives more chicken.)\\n\\nThe garlic naan was probably the best part. It was really good. If I would give this dish 4 out of 5. It's simple and only $4. Can't go wrong.\\n\\nOverall, I think I might give this place another chance.

We came for a 5:00 Friday reservation and the place was just starting to fill up.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere was cool - friendly and not pretentious.  The place is small but welcoming and they fit a good number of parties without feeling cramped.  The kitchen is open, which is fun to watch.  The place was very well-staffed and they were constantly refilling water, replacing silverware, and bringing the next course.\\n\\nAs for the food, it was a bit of a mixed bag.  The meal started out with a sea urchin lettuce wrap which wasn't to our liking.  Next was snapper in ponzu - the fish was nice, but the whole dish was way too sweet.  Mushrooms in green gazpacho was good, interesting flavors and reasonably balanced.  Next was homemade mozzarella in spring onion soup - the cheese was yummy but the soup was plenty salty.  Grilled bacon with marmalade was tasty and a good balance of salty and sweet.  The duck jerky with brussels sprouts was alright, but there was a bit too much going on and again, over-seasoned.  The spinach noodles with fried shrimp were yummy. \\n\\nThat was the first half - so far, lots of interesting ingredients and flavors, but nothing that blew us away.  They brought a kefir/berry/mint palate cleanser which had intense flavor and definitely awakened the senses, but was really only enjoyable when you got a taste of one of the few bits of mint.  \\n\\nThe latter half started with a slow-cooked egg with crunchy sweet potato.  It was ok, but the yolk was only half-runny and wasn't quite enough to sauce the whole dish.  Lamb loin on yogurt with chard, raisins and nuts was delicious - great smoky flavor balanced by a pop of sweet raisin.  One of the better dishes.  The halibut with chicken and foam jus was good, but again, a bit too much going on to really let the protein speak for itself.  The rabbit terrine with pickled carrots was yummy but again a bit over-seasoned.  \\n\\nSo for the savory dishes, 2 were really good and the rest were just alright.  A common theme was the prevalence of salt and/or pickling which threw off the balance of many of the dishes.  Then came desert.  My wife is gluten-sensitive so hers was berry sorbet that she absolutely raved about.  Mine was the panna cotta with pistacio crumb and fennel - amazing.  One of the better deserts I've ever had.  \\n\\nSo, to wrap up, we enjoyed our visit for the varied experience.  It's not cheap, but the amount of work and technique that goes into all the courses is definitely visible on the plate.

Wow!  That tamarind chutney just completely blew us both away - it was sooo delicious!\\n\\nOur waiter, Rob, arrived soon to answer any questions and to take our order.  Rob was the consumate waiter - always there when we needed him, never in the way or pushy.\\n\\nI ordered a chocolate martini, companion ordered a gin martini, and we splurged on two appetizers - the signature curried mussels and the coriander calamari.  The breading on the calamari was perhaps a little too \\"soft\\" - I would have preferred it to be just a little bit more crispy - but the flavor was delicious, and the garlic-cilantro sauce that was served with it was light and refreshing.  But those mussels - mmmmm, yummy!  The garlic red wine curry sauce they were cooked in was simply to die for - and the leftover sauce came home with some basmati rice to be savored again at another time.\\n\\nFor our entrees, we chose the lamb vindaloo (companion) and the kothmir salmon with korma sauce (self).  Heaven!  I had a tiny sample of the vindaloo, and it tasted wonderful, but I wanted to focus all of my attention on the fantastic salmon dish I had ordered.  The fish was cooked just right, and the richness of the korma sauce complemented it perfectly.  Wait, did I say above that there is no such thing as perfection?  Maybe I lied...  My companion didn't say a great deal about his dish, but there was enough eye-rolling and moaning that I knew his food-gasm was comparable to my own.  He did comment that the endorphins had kicked into overdrive - the spice was \\"just right\\" for him...\\n\\nBeing that it was his birthday, I asked him if he wanted any dessert - Rob overheard and insisted on bringing him something on the house.  He suggested a mango cheesecake, and I confess to being surprised when the suggestion was accepted (companion usually does not like cheesecake, and I don't particularly like mango).  Exquisite!  The cheesecake itself was like eating a cloud - it was so light and fluffy - with an overly thick graham-cracker crust that was actually a perfect balance (weight and texture) to the cake.  It wasn't too sweet or creamy, either.  And the mango was just the right touch of mango sauce drizzled over the slice of nirvana.

The waitress put my drink on my table and waited nearby until I returned.  I ordered the zuni roll and a garden salad.  I was given the option to select potato salad or cole slaw.

The texture of the crispy tortilla was so delicious.  However, the cranberry sauce wasn't sweet enough for me.  I would have preferred the canned cranberry sauce.  It would have been perfect.

Our immediate reaction based on the decor and visible patrons was that we had wandered into a hunting lodge for retirees.  Our server (one of three on the floor) seated us after a short pause and contextualized her frazzled look when she blurted out how busy they had suddenly become.  However, despite some short delay in attention, everything ran smoothly\\n\\nI ordered Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos and a draft beer.  The other members of my group ordered the Watermelon Feta Salad and a Gin & Tonic, and a Barbecued Pulled Pork Sandwich (listed on the Special menu) and a Moscow Mule.  The three Jalapenos were probably the best I've had.  Thick bacon, nice creamy filling, not overly messy - and came with a sweet sauce that could be applied (do it if you know what's good for you).  The beer, unfortunately, was not at temperature.  Not sure if this is a product of how long my beer was sitting on a tray or what temperature it dispenses at.  It was tolerable, but I got a little snooty about it.  I tried the Moscow Mule and it blew my socks across the room with how tasty it was.  The G&T was a little boozy and the waitress was very nice to provide more tonic at our request.  The Barbecued Pulled Pork was apparently amazing (did not try but watched eyes roll back into heads).  The watermelon feta salad was light on watermelon and heavy on feta.  Needed some balancing in proportions but was otherwise very good.\\n\\nOverall an excellent experience.  \\n\\nPositives:  Food was excellent, some great mixed drinks, clean, great live acoustic music.\\nNegatives: (Nitpicking!)

And just a good tip do not order the small fry unless you really do not want a decent amount of fries. If you like a lot of fries or a decent amount order the large, the large will even do for 2 people. And don't bother ordering a soda because they have self serve fountain drinks so.. Another thing I disliked was the assigned seating, I mean I'm sure or hope you could ask to be seated where you want but they print out the table you have to sit at and if you're a party of 2 they will sit you at a table for 2!

In reality it is a bastardized version of all of them that caters to American taste buds, but I was expecting that.\\n\\nNow to the good stuff. The \\"seafood dynamite\\" in a little tin shot glass is a great invention! It is cheesy creamy sauce with a mix of shrimp and seafood. They have Kim Chi, spicy Korean dishes and Korean ribs. All good.\\n\\nThere was more sushi the second time we came, around 7:00pm and it is probably a good thing that they have no actual raw fish, just California rolls, eel, cooked shrimp and the like. They have decent miso soup.\\n\\nThere were a lot of options, from breaded shrimp to what looked like baked shrimp, to breaded stir fry chicken, clams, etc. something for everyone.\\n\\nThey have a self-serve ice cream machine, which gives that icy style of chocolate or vanilla, which I like because the flavor is good, but it's not killer sugar.\\n\\nThe desert area was overkill, but great mini cakes and smaller servings of appealing sweets, so you can taste several things.\\n\\nThe service was minimal, but friendly.

We arrived sharply at 9am on a Sunday and had to wait over an hour for a table. This was after coming on a Thursday at 2 pm and being told they were out of waffles (they don't close until 3pm). The only reason we came back was that our younger son's heart was set on it after the weeks' earlier disappointment. \\n\\nLuckily both my sons were happy with their meals - the waffles for one and for the other, the wolf's platter ( assortment of sausages and bacon's). Wolf's platter was a delicious assortment of meats, however one of the items, the pork, was bland and tough.  \\n\\nMy meal was almost completely inedible. It was some supposed flat bread... If a 2-inch tall, tasteless baked dough is considered flatbread. It was piled with some meat rag√∫, canned whole tomatoes, and some once melted cheese that had cooled and congealed back to the consistency of over-chewed gum. The egg on top I had requested over easy but it was served sunny side up (with translucent, mucus-like uncooked egg white... which is why I requested the over easy). The waiter happily returned it to the kitchen to be cooked to my liking. Perhaps that's why the rest of that meal cooled to an unpalatable room temperature. However that still doesn't excuse the bland, too-puffy, too-tough flatbread. And really... Should they have given me back a cooled-off unpalatable dish??? The re-cooked egg turned out to be the only part of the meal that I was able to eat.\\n\\nTo the establishment's credit, the waiter came back and asked what I had disliked about my meal,  took notes for the kitchen, and comped that item. Hopefully the next customer will be served a better dish.\\n\\nAs for the waffles: 3 in our group thought they were good or great. One of us thought they had better tasting waffles elsewhere. The sauces were universally agreed-upon as delicious especially the passionfruit cream. The dark chocolate dipping sauce was somewhat thin, but not overly so. And the salted caramel was also quite delicious.\\n\\nAs for the \\"good coffee\\" - my older son and husband both ordered the lavender latte. And both agreed that it was slightly too sweet. They say that while the execution was flawed, it was still a good drink. I ordered the dark chocolate mocha which was somewhat gritty tasting although the latte art on top was beautiful.\\n\\nWe also ordered the hibiscus so the drink and the cardamom root beer. The hibiscus drink was delicious and beautifully presented. Although the candy hibiscus flower on was not so tasty to eat. The root beer drink was interesting for one sip, but definitely not worth $6 for a glass. \\n\\nAll in all, the dishes were hit and miss, the atmosphere pleasant but not worth waiting for, and not someplace will put on our list of restaurants to revisit nor recommend."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Desta makes great Ethiopian food.

We started with yak momos (yak is not on the menu, but we had to ask), which are just like Chinese dumplings, and mildly spicy chili chicken lollipops, which were a highlight. For mains: chicken himali (akin to butter chicken), lamb chili (my favourite) and quati (nine bean curry). The roti was thin, and the only part of the meal I did not love; it was just OK.\\n\\nOur servers were friendly and efficient, and the whole experience was enjoyable. It was a bit more expensive than I was prepared for, but we left full and happy.

I especially like their \\"Chicken on the Sticks\\" (I know the name is entertaining) but the sauce they use is like a mix between bourbon and teriyaki and the chicken just falls off the stick when lightly tugged. Their pan fried pot stickers are also really good. It's hard to find places in Atlanta that don't only serve deep fried and steamed dumplings. For the beef dishes I would have to recommend the Mongolian beef. I don't really understand how someone could give them a 1 star rating, though, since I've had many dishes from Chopsticks and never been disappointed.\\nI might be a little biased since I just moved from Midtown where the best option for a Georgia Tech student was Lucky Buddha but this place is a regular on my take out list.

Since it wasn't on the menu, I guess they didn't have the ingredients for it, and brought me some awful concoction of ew. It was water for me that evening. \\nOn to the food. Ahhhh. I got the mac and cheese. Very down to earth and warm blend of gruyere,romano,and cheddar. Little bits of onion are just enough flavor you need so it's just CHEESE. Topped with a perfect ritz crumble.  I also took a bit of my friends sandwich,I had to, which was great. I think it was called D-bar? D-something..it had veal in it,veggies and some amazing sauce all with melted cheese..I think there was some bacon shoved in there.

Strange and no good. Avoid! \\n\\nCaprese -- tasty. Granted, it's hard to mess this up but the tomatoes were fresh, the mozzarella tasty, and the aged balsamic just what I wanted. Yum. \\n\\nMushroom risotto -- damn good. No more need be said. Get it. \\n\\nChicken Satays: avoid!! Giant hunks of chicken that aren't seasoned (or particularly well cooked) on the inside. Some dipping sauces but overall just a giant hunk of luke warm unseasoned chicken on a stick. \\n\\nFries: Tasty but actually room temp/ verging on cool.

Such touches have made me give this an extra star than I initially planned on giving them. \\n\\nI like the pomegrenate stew chicken as part of a buffet as it would be too sweet for me to have as a separate entree.

It wouldn't be my choice to return. The prices are quite high for what you get and for me, the food was just okay. I'm vegetarian and asked what they could make for me since there were no vegetarian entrees offered. Our waiter suggested the pasta without the shrimp. It sounded meh (I hate being stuck with a cream sauce pasta as the only vegetarian option at so many American restaurants) so I just ordered a side of the seasonal vegetable and a side of the mashed potatoes. I also ordered a salad to start. It was all okay. The serving of mashed potatoes was in a small ramekin which was maybe 3/4 cup and the serving of veg was about 15 green beans. Since this was my meal, it seemed a bit small and I was still hungry after dinner! I am not sure what they charged for this. On the menu it states there's a $14 minimum on food per person which I have never seen before; they seem quite concerned with making money at every possible opportunity (they also add in cover charge per person if there's music). Potatoes are my favorite food and I thought they were just okay... The rest of my party seemed to like their food enough as they should since all entrees about 30+ bucks. It was annoying they didn't bring bread around at the beginning of the meal or even with the starter salads. Even more annoying is that we had to ask for it. I didn't see the bill so I am not sure if they charged for it or not but I would not be surprised if they did. \\n\\nThe tableside Banana's Foster was good but I think quite possibly the biggest waste of money ever. You get two servings of ice cream, two bananas, a couple spoonfuls of other ingredients for $18. I guess people are impressed by it lighting on fire right next to you. \\n\\nOur waiter was nice-ish but seemed, I don't know... distracted or something. He was not very warm and for it being a fancy place I expect gracious, attentive service which I felt we did not get. Also, service was pretty slow. We waited quite a bit of time between everything. While waiting I took a look around. The dimly lit atmosphere looks nice and feels nice at first but then I pictured the place with lights on and imagined it would look kind of old and dingy. Also, the bathrooms are old and not that nice. Stanford's bathrooms are ten times better and feel fancier. \\n\\nI wouldn't choose to spend money here again.

I'm definitely, definitely a fan as is my husband (who lived in northern Italy for about three or four years) and his parents (who lived there, off and on, for about 10 years). I've been here twice now, the first time being completely by accident; The Mister, the in-laws and I first targeted Mandola's, but that entire complex was shut down due to a broken water main. Next, we tried Blue Star, because we both love that place and thought his parents might, too. But, we got there Sunday and they were closed. So, somewhat at a loss, we smelled good smells coming from next door and decided to give Gusto's a try.\\n\\nFirst time around, we were extremely impressed; the place wasn't crowded at all, so the five of us (his g'mother was with us, too) set up shop on the patio. Believe it or not, the weather was perfect. Our server was attentive, but not overly so -- drinks were refilled when necessary, but overall it reminded me of a European cafe, where the servers give you space to relax and really enjoy the meal. We got three apps: the meatballs and calamari were fantastic while the bruschetta was so-so. Not terrible, but not as much flavor as we expected.  For entrees, I chose the pork shank, which was fall-off-the-bone tender; it literally made my mouth water. The Mister and his mom ordered pizzas (I had pieces of each and they were suuuuuper delicious), and my father in law ordered his old standby: spaghetti carbonara. The man loves his carbonara and he orders it at every opportunity -- he said the version at Gusto needed a touch more salt for his taste, but he absolutely loved that they use egg yolk, which makes it authentic (not every restaurant does). \\n\\nOur second trip was just today, to celebrate my husband passing his nursing assistant exam (yay!). Once again, it was us and his parents; my parents joined us, too. We again ordered meatballs and calamari, and were again impressed. The meatballs are pretty addictive -- dense, but very moist, with a nice hint of herbs. And the sauce is thick and delicious, the kind you want to sop up with bread. We also found it works really, really well on the calamari. Since we were too early for their dinner entrees, I ordered the gremelli pollo, a pasta dish with roasted chicken, spinach, onions and walnuts in a cream sauce. I'm a sucker for cream sauces, despite knowing how bad they are for me. This one was pretty outstanding -- I wasn't sure about the walnuts, but the nuttiness played really well with the other flavors. Mom and husband had pizzas (delish), dad and mom-in-law had paninis (they looked fab) and again, my father-in-law raved about his carbonara. He ordered a side salad, too, and it looked extremely fresh; so may restaurants treat the salad as a throwaway, so I'm always happy to see a good looking plate of roughage. \\n\\nWe extended our lunch with cappucinos and tiramisu -- and holy hell, that thing was boozy. We'd had the tiramisu on our first trip and it was really rich and creamy (the portion they offer is also pretty huge). This time around it was good, but FULL of booze. I swear, the pastry chef must have left those ladyfingers soaking and gone out for lunch or something. My mom-in-law, who is not a drinker, took one bite and put her fork down -- she's so freaking tiny and can get a buzz from a glass of wine. Too much alcohol makes her queasy, so the tiramisu definitely wasn't for her. My hubs and my mom, however, were damned near licking the bowl.\\n\\nThis seems like a place that could have a wait during the week, but twice we've been on Sunday and it's been a very casual, leisurely time.

The drink's taste is so unique - almost reminiscent of autumnal mulling spices - and our waiter clued us in to what makes it so. Cloves, passion fruit juice, and juniper berries were a few of the ingredients we squeezed from him. The rest is a secret! Unfortunately a carafe doesn't come with a ton of liquid, since both the glasses and carafe were filled with ice. It's too bad since we finished it off pretty fast and were left wanting more of the sweet stuff!\\n\\nAs for food, you really can't go wrong! Empanadas, arepas, and more substantial breakfast plates are offered during their Sunday brunch. Do your table a favor and order the datiles as an appetizer. The Reina Papiada arepa is shredded chicken sandwiched with a tomato and avocado in an arepa and served with a very garlicky aioli on the side. This plate may look small, but that guy was stuffed and can still be a good amount for a meal. And the flavor packed in that small package is pretty unreal!\\n\\nInside the Empanada Mechada, the warm, shredded beef with sweet onions reminded us of the Cuban dish ropa vieja. There are 2 empanadas cut in half and served with a large salad in the center of the plate. The salad wasn't too noteworthy but added a nice freshness. Also a good amount of food for a lighter meal. And the flavors of that sweet, juicy beef can't be beat!\\n\\nYou can't have a proper brunch here without a Venezuelan breakfast plate! The Pa' Los Gringos (aka \\"For the Non-Latin Folk\\") is a hefty serving of everything you would want to see in the morning. Savory chorizo, a mix of scrambled eggs with onions and tomatoes, a disc of yucca hash, and a plain arepa. The arepa was pretty flavorless but provided a nice vehicle to transport the eggs and chorizo from plate to mouth. The yucca was served hot and crispy on the outside. I'd never even yucca in the form before and wish more restaurants would get a clue. It would be the perfect accompaniment to pretty much any dish.\\n\\nSince anything goes during brunch, we ended our mid-Sunday meal with dessert. The quesillo is a Venezuelan cheese flan. The texture was creamy and the caramel flavor delicious. It's served cold and just the right amount of light sweetness to end the brunch on a satisfying note without that feeling of bloated guilt.

When we saw The Coop was opened for breakfast we had to check it out.  I really didn't know what to expect -- didn't check out any reviews.  But I must say it far exceeded my expectations.  I ordered the pulled pork/tamale pancake -- it was a perfect combo of flavors: sweet, savory and a little kick in the pancake from green chiles (?).  And -- who came up to our table to ask us how it was??  John Rivers himself.  He mentioned that he cooked my pancakes.  That says alot that the owner of a burgeoning restaurant empire (empir-ish?) is there working out the kinks.  One downside: the potatoes weren't very good, but to be fair most of the places we go for breakfast have a lot of inconsistency with the potatoes.

However, over the past year, I've visited on four other occasions and the quality of their food is in swift decline. Their tortilla soup which I've heard so much about is really pathetic. I wouldn't touch their nachos for love or money as it looks like Alpo instead of ground beef and where are the jalapenos?!?! I love puffed chicken tacos, but theirs has declined in quality as well.

It was a beautiful sunny day. Me and the GF decided that we were going to walk over to Drink for some Drinks. On the way over, I saw the Blue Wave sign with its martini glass staring at me. MMMMMMM martini. That sounded good. So we get to Drink, and we are told that the power was out but they are still serving drinks. We went up to the bar and were sort of sent off by the bartender saying that someone would be with us in the bar area. As several moments passed, with no one, we said f*** it and left. I will give Drink another chance with full bar and no power, I can understand they may have been in the weeds.\\n\\nSo, the BLUE WAVE. We walk across the street and go into BW. We are met with 4 girls cackling at their table about something. Either way, after seeing their sign portraying a martini, I am definitely ready. I ask for martini menu. GF orders a sweet girlie drink. I order a Bombay S, Gibson martini. For those of you who do not know, a gibson martini is a regular martini with pickled onions instead of olives. While I do not expect everyone who reads this to know that, I would certainly expect a bartender at a martini bar to know this. \\n\\nSo the drinks come. The bartender asks me if I want olives and if I want to start a tab. I reply \\"No, onions not olives\\". Several minutes go by and still no onions. I call her over again after she has served several other customers and ask her for the onions. She looks embarrassed and said oh, I thought you last name was onion. OK, no problem it happens. I said no I would like some onions. She said for what? I said for my drink. So what happens, she comes back out with a side plate of chopped red onions.... I did not know what to do. I looked at gf and she looked at me. We finished our drinks quickly, paid and left.\\n\\nI gave this place 2 stars instead of the 1 it deserved for one simple reason. While my martini never got its onions, my glass was filed up to the very top. This makes sense for the fruity drinks that just have a bit of vodka or gin in it, but if you order a straight martini, like I did, you get a full glass of alcohol at Blue Wave."},{"name":"Barley Swine","address":"6555 Burnet Rd, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"De-lish... if small plates with foie gras, beef tongue, and pork belly are your thing.

Fear not: the Gemstone uses a lot of locally grown ingredients, and they put together some exceedingly flavorful, yet simple, concoctions. And they have a strong dedication to fruit, which I'm told they purchase from the farmer's market each morning.

Let the tourists form the unnecessary lines at Voodoo and let the rest rejoice in Portland's finest donut establishment. Their mantra of creating \\"donuts for grownups\\" rings true in every delicious, foodgasmic creation they feature. For donut lovers or sweet tooth chasers, this is your nirvana in carb form.\\n\\nBlue Star offers a stunning variety of cake and yeast donuts, some of might be the best I've eaten. I don't want to sound like a broken record, but these premium confections are worth every penny for all interested parties. They're subtle in presentation and not as wild as some other concoctions from other donut shops. Instead, they're made from fresh and simple ingredients. Some folks might call these artisanal donuts, but that would be too cliche in a city like Portland.\\n\\nLet's start with the maple bacon, which can only be described by me as stupid. Stupid delicious. The bits of candied bacon and thin glaze make every bite as wonderful as the next. Another contender for tastiest (and certainly \\"boldest\\") donut is the blueberry, bourbon and basil (B3), which is as amazing as it sounds. The taste is a nice mix of savory and sweet, which is not something one can say about donuts.\\n\\nThe ever popular creme brulee donut deserves much praise. Sure it can be small, but the sweet level is just right. Couple it with the crunch of the exterior and you've got yourself a winning donut. For me, it doesn't get much better than the dulce de leche, with the added hazelnut topping. To say I love this donut is an understatement. I will actually eat it so slowly because I want to savor every single bite. This is of course during it's optimal freshness (newly baked). It should not be ignored during any visit to Blue Star.\\n\\nDonuts of this quality should be a lot more expensive than they are. But at $2-3 a pop, it's hardly any more expensive than other serious donut establishments around the US. The service is on point, the variety is endless, and above all, the product trumps the rest.

In fact, this salad was 90% iceberg lettuce - it fell out of the bowl making a mess. A metal cup of dressing came with the salad. OK Mangia - have some fortitude and pride in your food - charge $1.00 more and use a spring mix combo for the greens and add a few slices of tomato and something else - parmesan, toasted sunflower seeds?

Unfortunately it highly encourages you to overeat to a terrible degree.  They have their best signature sausages on the buffet. You can eat the Bahama mama mild or hot, garlic knockwurst, and bratwurst.  Mild Bahama mamas are my favorite.

We obtained a reservation by stopping in, and found the cooks & chefs, about 7 of them, prepping for the evenings service on the guest tables spread out in the restaurant. The place was warm and inviting as a gastro pub gets. \\n\\nThis meal is a pre-fix deal with about 14 courses- All small bites with an eclectic mix of flavors and farm to face seasonal produce. The first course involved Uni, which was a surprise, and was good. The progression began, and what came from the kitchen was a parade of hits and misses- Some of the dishes, like the famous duck jerky, had literally a sliver of duck jerky that maybe weighed in at 2 grams tops. you could barely taste some of the more expensive ingredients because there was so little used in the dish. One dish was a wad of fresh mozzarella, torched then served in a broth that can only be described as salty, clear French onion soup. I'm not going to go on about each dish, suffice to say, not everything worked, and left me thinking \\"what was the chef thinking\\"? but I'll give them 4 stars for the effort and good service, but was definitely not a 5 star place, yet."},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Not an adventurous eater by any means, so I had a burger.

Yes the chicken was pretty good and the staff was EXTREMELY friendly but I wasn't really sold.\\n\\nMy friends and I shared the eight piece family meal which came with two sides (coleslaw and baked beans) and we added a side of mac n' cheese and three tenders and started with the Fried Green Tomatoes. I think the Chicken was definitely the star but I did find the tenders bland and a bit dry. I found myself wishing for honey mustard to dip them into.\\n\\nThe fried chicken itself has a bit of a bite to it. I prefer dark meat and my first piece was a thigh. The ratio of breaded skin to meat was excellent on the thigh BUT on a drumstick the ratio was skewed and consequently the drumsticks were a bit too salty. I would still go back for only the fried chicken because it is tasty.... it just doesn't top my list of my favorite things to eat. \\n\\nThe sides were decent. I didn't think they were bad but they didn't exactly rock my world either. Odd faux pas moment. For our table of three they gave us TWO slices of white bread. This the white bread that you get from BBQ joints but there they try to give you practically the whole loaf for three people. I found this awkward and I hate to say it, stingy. Another issue had to be the appetizer. It was $6.75. Keep in mind if you get a 2 piece chicken plate (2 pieces of dark meat and 2 sides) it's $6.50. The Fried Green Tomatoes were $6.75 and came with FIVE slices of tomatoes. Again, I found that awkward and stingy because almost anywhere else in town that price would get you a well portioned appetizer to share but here we got five slices of tomato. Things like that, kind of bother me. We finished things off with a slice of the Chess pie which was decent, but again, didn't rock my world.\\n\\nWould I come back? Possibly? I'm not too sure because while the chicken was tasty I didn't find myself raving about it. There's a lot of food options in that area and when we went a line had formed after we were seated. If I could walk in because I was in the neighborhood and immediately be seated perhaps I'd drop by again but I wouldn't make the journey down just to get it."},{"name":"Baretto","address":"10710 Research Blvd, Ste 314","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Soooooooo cute!

Beneath the casual exterior lies a mature, upscale restaurant with a deep knowledge of seafood, service, and quality.  The fish--it's beautifully fresh, and they keep a very large selection on the menu at all times.  You can get it fried (and it's good), but there is almost always the option to have it gently grilled, or baked, which really lets the quality shine.  The cooks clearly know their business as well--from what I've tasted, it's never overcooked, which is all too common with seafood.  \\n\\nCome expecting to pay for an upscale meal, because that's what you should expect.  The service, though casually friendly, is professionally paced and delivered.  Waiters are polite, fast, and nonintrusive.  And the casual \\"shack\\" ambiance--it's intentional.  Sometimes you don't want to dress up when going out for a great meal.  Maybe SS isn't ideal for the romantic date or some other fancy occasion.  But notice that the music isn't too loud, the restaurant isn't too warm or chilled, and the tables aren't crammed together.  And hey, it's the best seafood around.\\n\\nTLDR:\\n\\n* Amazing, fresh seafood, other options very good too\\n* Good service\\n* Casual dining atmosphere (t-shirts are common, waiters wear them)\\n* Pricey, but quality is worth it\\n\\nTips:\\n\\n* Great oysters, try ordering a sampler of one of each kind.  Or specify that you want a sweeter or brinier variety, depending on your taste.  They'll have both.\\n* Apps are large, almost entree-sized sometimes.  Entrees aren't ridiculous though.  You'll be full enough if you skip apps, but you'll also miss out on some tasty things.  App followed by app would probably be plenty for most , and if not, their desserts are very good.\\n* Cornbread and rolls are excellent, don't skip.\\n* JP-Licks is near enough that it could replace dessert for ice-cream lovers that have a car."},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here on Sunday morning, after seeing reviews online.

I only wish the noodles were a bit thinner and softer, and that the broth was a little richer. I realized later on that I should have ordered the miso broth instead of the shoyu broth, but that was my mistake! I'm a big fan of having things on the table that I can add in my soup, like garlic and seaweed, but unfortunately they have none. It was very good ramen, they are fast, and the staff is really great, but it just didn't quite make it to 5 stars for me. \\n\\nUPDATE:\\nSo now that we realized we should have been ordering miso broth all along, my fianc√© and I decided to give this place another try. Two things happened: 1. I'm a vegetarian, however I do make an exception for broth, and I think vegetarian ramen is disgusting so I don't order it, I just order regular ramen with meat on the side which I give to my fianc√©. (Don't judge) This usually works fine, however this broth is just swimming in meat bits. I spent have of my time (both trips) picking out meat pieces. Again, I did not like the thickness or firmness of the noodles. They gave me hardly any broth, literally half a bowl, and it tasted almost like it came from a powdery mix. It lacked depth in a big way. I thought, yeah, I won't be coming back here again, and I'm lowering my score to 3 stars. Meanwhile...2. My fianc√© across the table says, \\"This is probably the best ramen I've ever had! I love the noodles, the spiciness, the broth, and the meat chunks!\\" \\n\\nSo really, it comes down to your personal preference. I did not like it, but my fianc√© loved it.

Thus, I have a suggestion for Blue Star and many other donut shops trying to make their way in this world - focus on the dough. When you don't cover the most basic element, every other embellishment is simply a waste of time. Without a delicious base, a donut has no soul (ironic given the hole in the middle but true). The dough at Blue Star seems like a  means to an end rather than a expression of quality. It has dutifully risen, it absorbs a (seemingly) unnecessary amount of topping, and it provides a spectacular canvas. But in terms of taste, it lends nothing to the experience. The end result is a donut that is overpowered. Either too: sugary, savory, or filled and without a counterpoint for balance. With all the creativity displayed in the shop itself, the toppings, and the experience  at Blue Star, I'm hopeful that there is room and time for a remedy.

I am an unabashed fan, but I'm fan because this cafe has never failed to deliver one of Vancouver's best cafe experiences, from top to bottom.\\n\\nThe Staff\\nThe staff in this place is amazing. Their knowledge on all their seasonal coffee offerings is constantly impressive, they're always friendly and extremely accomodating, even to a demanding guy like me.\\n\\nThe Coffee\\nMatchstick roasts their coffee right in the back of their cafe, and the selection rotates often. They are the type of roaster who roasts coffee to the level the coffee requires, not to a \\"roast level\\" just so they can sell something bold or dark or rich. You won't find \\"dark roast\\" or \\"french roast\\" or \\"blond roast\\" here. You'll find coffee roasted correctly and aged properly (sold 3-5 days after roast)\\n\\nThe Espresso\\nI'm not a huge fan of single origin espresso, but some of the better SO espressos I've had in Vancouver have come from Matchstick's Linea machine at the front of the shop. They know what they're doing.\\n\\nThe Room\\nGreat cafe room that extremely open and airy. I asked the owners about this and they told me the building's zoning means they had to limit seating (capacity); so hence, lots of space in the place. I like it, and love the common table, though I have to admit I'm getting tired of all the computer campers who sit there with their one coffee for several hours. I wish Matchstick would invoke some Internet limits so you would lose internet access after 1 hour; this might make some of the non-buying campers move on."},{"name":"Pattycake Bakery","address":"3009 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I am addicted to PVB's Sticky Buns.

I've ventured to eight different Indian restaurants in central Ohio (Cuisine of India, Spice House, Bayleaf Bistro, Taj Palace, Chutneys, Amul India, New India, and Cumin), and in my opinion, Cumin is the best of the lot.\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is beautiful - as it possesses a classy and even romantic feel. Not only that, the service has been top-notch during all of my trips there. The owner has even stopped by on multiple occasions to briefly chat with whomever I'm with and myself - making certain the quality of the food has met our expectations. On that note, just thinking about how delicious the food is makes my mouth water. I make certain to arrive there hungry, because there are times when I stuff myself so full, I receive looks from other patrons, wondering if there's something seriously wrong with me. From the Mulligatawny Soup to the papadum (and mint chutney sauce) to the naan breads (garlic being my personal favorite, so long as I have a stash of mints handy and/or I'm not on a date) to the many scrumptious appetizers and entrees to the desserts (if there's enough room in my stomach, which there usually isn't), Cumin provides a filling, delicious meal each and every time I've headed that way. Whether one eats meat or is a vegetarian, there is plenty to choose from at this restaurant. If one is fond of Indian food like I am, I highly recommend giving Cumin a gander, and even if you're on the fence about whether or not to give the cuisine a try, I'd recommend checking it out at least once.\\n\\nSome of my personal favorite dishes include:\\n\\nChicken 65 - A very spicy appetizer which provides a great combination of flavor and heat.\\n\\nChilly Chicken Changa - A milder dish, but with great taste.\\n\\nVindaloo - As the menu states, it's not for the \\"feint of heart,\\" but if you like spice, this dish may force a person to imitate Meg Ryan from the classic film, \\"When Harry Met Sally.\\" (\\"I'll have what she's having.\\") \\n\\nYes, I tend to like a lot of spice. However, even for those whom aren't too keen on spicy dishes, Cumin has a heat scale from mild to very spicy to appease customers of all types. So, no matter how hot or mild you like your food, I'd definitely give Cumin a try!"},{"name":"The Hangar Bar & Grille","address":"2305 Edgewater Dr, Ste H","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"They messed up the philly cheese steak.

After a short wait at the bar (and an enjoyable wine recommendation), we sat down for dinner with high expectations.\\n\\nThe menu seemed a bit limited, but that concern disappeared when the friendly waiter recited a long (and tempting) list of specials.  Then the food arrived, and that's where things started to go wrong.  We had scrapped our original appetizer selections in favor of sharing the antipasti special.  It was OK, but nothing special (a bit of cheese, some decent salumi, olives and cornichons), and we were especially underwhelmed when we got the bill and learned that it was $23.  \\n\\nOur main dishes,on the other hand, overwhelmed -- with their massive over salting.  I'm not someone who generally complains about restaurant meals being too salty, but in this case both of our dishes (bolognese and gnocchi with lamb ragu) had been seasoned with a much too heavy hand.  Neither of us could eat even half of our meal, and when the waiter came to clear the dishes my hubby commented that they were too salty.

Modern in style but rooted in classic technique a meal at Barley Swine begins with warm greetings and a glass of bubbly but with little fuss or pageantry thereafter the experience that follows can best be compared to dinner served in the home of an old friend - each course a story delivered with a smile, feedback always sought and satisfaction assured.  Beginning light and progressing towards heavy in traditional tasting menu format without ever once compromising on quality or complexity suffice it to say that no single dish can hope to capture the nature of Gilmore's cuisine but in an attempt to do so one would be best served to focus on purity of flavors and seemingly discrepant ingredients serving to enhance rather than alter or distract - the pristine raw snapper taking on new life in the sweetness of strawberries with an aromatic truffled linger for example...or perhaps the funky century egg brought to a head by briny capers and mustard, an aggressive assault on the senses kept in check by tender mushrooms and naturally sweet starch.  Every bit a 'perfect' meal without a single plate eliciting less than awe of its quality and nuance suffice it to say that Barley Swine was everything I expected and more - a $75 tasting trumping Michelin starred meals 3-to-6 times as expensive both stateside and abroad; a 'destination' meal deep in the heart of Texas."},{"name":"BheemaS Austin Indian kitchen","address":"1779 Wells Branch Pkwy, Ste 102","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Bheema's buffet is a royal disappointment!

We're known for being able to eat a lot of food, so clearly the portions are generous. Our very first visit we had one lamb and one filet mignon tibs (tender cube meat saut√©ed in a secret blend of spices, onions, tomatoes, peppers & spiced olive oil). We also ordered one cooked with rice, and one layered over shiro (slowly cooked chick pea sauce), one with ater (split pea stew) and one with miser (spicy red lentil stew) and both with injera (soft spongy flat bread with tiny holes). It's served beautifully on a platter and we eat it family style.\\n\\nBased on that first experience our standard order now is lamb tibs only, layered over shiro with miser. We get one order with injera and the other with pita bread. If you've never had injera you must try this wonderful spongy bread--no utensils are needed because you can use the injera to scoop the food. The injera is served rolled and stacked on a platter--if you need more, just ask. We order pita bread just to have a bit of variety, but if you can only get one, go with the injera.\\n\\nThe staff is always friendly and welcoming. We love that they're open till 11pm during the week and 12am on weekends because so many kitchens close early. If you need something delicious even late-night, this is the place to go and clearly others agree with us because we were there after 10pm one Sunday night (it may have even been 11pm) and there were quite a few people there.\\n\\nThe worst thing about Desta is it sets the bar high when it comes to Ethiopian food!"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Donuts are simple, elegant and light.

Pattycake Bakery is a completely vegan bakery, which was hard to believe because everything I tasted was so good. They have to be the best bakery in Columbus. It's not cheap but everything is better tasting and less unhealthy than a regular bakery. There's many cakes, cookies, and other treats. \\n\\nI have liked most of what I've tried. The best cakes have been the caramel coffee, mint, and orange creamsicle. In the caramel coffee I can really taste the coffee. The caramel and coffee icing tastes like a cappucino with caramel. I like the chocolate and mint combination. This was like a thin mint. In the orange creamsicle there was lots of orange flavor. The cake was creamy and fluffy, and tasted like the frozen treat. The best cookies have been the cherry chocolate co-op bar, and peanut butter. In the cherry chocolate co-op bar was the perfect combination of sour cherries and sweet chocolate. The peanut butter was chey and not too sweet. The best cupcakes have been the carrot cake, lemon, and vanilla. It's a lot of icing on these, and they're all really big. The carrot cake has the best icing, the lemon is slightly tart, and the vanilla is very sweet. The best sticky buns have been the bourbon pecan, maple pecan, orange, pumpkin, and vanilla. It tastes even better when it's warm. The best whoopie pies have been the mint, original, and pumpkin. It feels like fall when the pumpkin stuff comes out. They need 3 days for a special order cake. Cookies are $2.50 each, $13 a half dozen, and $24 a dozen. Cupcakes are $3.95 each, $21 a half dozen, and $39.50 a dozen. Whoopie pies are $3.25 each, $17.50 a half dozen, and $33.50 a dozen. It costs more but you're buying really good stuff. Pattycake products can be found in Crimson Cup, Cup O' Joe, Kafe Kerouac, Lucky's Market, Raisin Rack, The Hills Market Downtown, and Weiland's. \\n\\nI will come to Pattycake Bakery for sweets. It's recommended for anyone who likes cakes or cookies and wants something better.

In fact, it was like riding a salt lick downhill, hitting salt patches down that salt hill. Salt salt salt. From the dumplings to the scallops, everything on the menu (save the sprouts) felt like it wasn't thought out at all. None of the flavors seemed to match or compliment each other.

A generous amount of avocado is placed on top of the poached eggs (I opted for soft poached), and it's doused in their delicious Hollandaise sauce. It had some spices sprinkled on top with a garnish of some kind (looked almost like mini artichokes) and most importantly, big, plump, shrimp was also arrayed on my platter. I gotta say, I really appreciate \\"proper\\" shrimp in my food as I've been so accustomed to the tiny micro shrimp establishments usually use in \\"shrimp\\" dishes.

The standard burger was fantastic, you can taste the short rib and brisket ground into the patty and it's just the right size.  The rBQ was well spiced and tasty.  And as much as I loved the burgers, the sides were even better!  The onion rings were fantastic, cooked in a tempura-like batter (nom nom nom) and the pickles were sweet, sour, tangy and crunchy, yum-m-my!

I'm not sure what it is that they are doing wrong, but I suspect they are using a combination of water and milk, rather than just milk.  As a result, the lattes are way too dark, and quite bitter.  Yuck.  If Starbucks can get it right every time then there is no reason they shouldn't be able to as well.\\n\\nBut now for the worst: \\n\\nA month or two ago, I went to get some coffee and some food.  I was served by a somewhat overweight woman that (I later noticed) had tattoos on her legs.  Nothing wrong with either of these facts, I only mention it by way of identification.\\n\\nShe served my food, and my iced latte which, as usual, was not good.\\n\\nI was half way through eating my food when I heard a loud belch, the kind that could only be deliberate, and to my horror I realized that it had emanated from the woman behind the counter!  Over the course of the next few minutes she belched again several times - it really put me off my food.\\n\\nNow, if this had only happened once, I suppose it could be forgiven, but I had a near-identical experience with the same person several weeks later!\\n\\nPerhaps I'm old fashioned, but belching loudly in public is not acceptable behavior for anyone, and for someone in a restaurant that serves food to do it blatantly while people are trying to eat is simply unforgivable.\\n\\nSorry Cherrywood, but I can't give more than 1 star for this."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Cafe Medina has a great menu in a wonderful space.  The Waffles are the best I've had outside of Europe.  Remember to ask them to go easy on the salt when you order other dishes. At my table everyone's main dishes would have been wonderful if they hadn't been massively over-salted (we're talking salt-lick territory).\\n\\nIf you go for brunch you *must* order a waffle appetizer because they're the only thing that comes quickly and you'll die of starvation if you don't.  Delivering them also requires the waitstaff to approach your table and it may be your only chance to get your water refilled.  Cafe Medina has extended their space, but not their kitchen or waitstaff.  This makes dining there an incredibly leisurely affair with understandably harried and unfriendly servers.  That would be okay if you at least had a drink to sip on, but no one even came near the table to take an order for 10 minutes and drinks didn't come for another 20 (it wasn't just the lattes that were delayed - a beer poured from a bottle at the table took over 10 minutes to come).  Forget about getting anything refilled or even catching someone's attention to order a 2nd round before you finish your meal.\\n\\nThe portions are generous, but not overwhelming, and the prices are certainly reasonable.

That would ruin your experience.  And experience is important because Barley Swine is meant to be experienced on a very personal level.\\n\\nErrol is somebody that I consider the expert in all things Barley Swine and so I trusted his judgement when he said he wanted to join me there one Saturday night a couple of weeks ago.  Errol was very selective about when we went as he wanted to make sure that all the top players were performing that night:  owner/head chef Bryce Gilmore, Sam the sous chef, Billy the bartender (a girl, and a very kick ass girl I may add) plus the manager Jason.  \\n\\nThe first thing I noticed after taking a seat to eat at the bar is that every single person running this place is younger than me.  Yikes!  But hey, I am only 32 years old.  What's exciting about this fact is that based on how yummy Barley Swine is this could only mean we have decades of glorious decadence to look forward to in the coming years from these talented souls.  Bryce himself is the offspring of Jack Gilmore (who has done stuff like Jack Allen's Kitchen) so cooking good stuff is in his blood.  \\n\\nHaving said that I have to give MAJOR, LARGE PROPS (I like to yell) to their sous chef.  My favorite sampling of the night was a corn type soup that had so much of an explosion of taste and creativity that my typing cannot spurt out the right kinds of uniting together of letters and words to give it justice.  I know this is confusing but you just need to eat here to understand.\\n\\nBecause the idea behind Barley Swine is \\"pork and beer\\" (Bryce's favorite pairings) beer aficionados will be quite pleased at the selection of beer available.  If you hate beer don't fret because they also have a great wine selection (just no liquor--beer and wine only).  Ask the bartender to pair your beverage with your dinner.\\n\\nAs for dinner the menu rotates frequently and seasonally so it is hard to recommend one dish.  This is one of those places where you will be best served to let the waitstaff order for you.  Each portion is small (more of a 'tasting') but filled with flavor.  Of course Barley Swine gets their ingredients sourced as much as they can from local farms.  \\n\\nEvery single person at Barley Swine works hard to make sure that you have a great experience from start to finish.

Yes, it has its kinks but even when Ted Ginsberg debuted the food on various nights at General Muir or when he did the pop-up at the Freedom Farmer's Market, you knew it was going to be good.  The flavors are bold and they will take a bit of getting used to them for some while others instantly crave. I don't know where the people who find this food lacking flavor because it does not seem to be the case from the 3 times that I have been.  Also, if you are expecting this to be like Greek or Italian because it has the \\"Mediterranean\\" label, then you will probably be disappointed.  Not sure if this is why some people seemed so disappointed in some of these reviews that mention they love mediterranean food? \\n\\nFood comes in 3 versions: Pita, Laffa (essentially think of this as a soft, spongy flatbread that takes the place of a tortilla) and a Platter/Bowl.  The pita is a large portion, with the bowl and the laffa easily being two meals if you don't have a large appetite and/or eat something along with it.  You then choose schwarma, kebab, or falafel and start adding toppings.  The times I have been, I am almost certain that they didn't charge based on the number I chose, because I essentially added everything they could fit.\\n\\nAs for the taste: the kebab is good, but have only tried it once so can only say I prefer the schwarma and will reserve sweeping judgement.  The shwarma is pretty tasty but its the myriad toppings that come along with it that make it fun. The explanations are numerous but I am tall enough to see over the counter and to be able to hear the servers so I know that my experience is fundamentally different but I am sure that in time this aspect will improve.  The other sides are good and the fattoush salad was very good when I had it, pointing out that its exact ingredients will change with the seasons according to my understanding to it may vary.   Only thing that I have tasted that seemed a bit off was the Israeli pickles that seemed overly salty and lacking a bit in flavor, of which i will admit my ignorance and may be how they are supposed to taste.  \\n\\nNow the obligatory mention of the speed.  Yes it has been difficult to bring this concept to a point where it can be a quick service experience, largely because they are trying to do something no one else has.  It is a fancy version of what it was inspired by: street food that borrows from Israel, Lebanon, Palestine and probably a few other cultures.  To the people who incessantly complain about the wait, you can always go to McDonalds.  Imagine what the lines at Chipotle would be like if it was brand new and had twice as many choices for what goes on and more than half of them are things that no one has ever seen or tasted.  So seriously, we get the point and if speed of service is all that matters to you, then I am happy to have you out of the line.  More delicious Yalla for me.\\n\\nThe wrinkles, not a fault of the food are the reason for 4/5 stars.

This would not have been a problem, however, had the food been special  Unfortunately the fish which I ordered--the Grouper--was unrecognizable as such. It was not just disappointing. It simply did not resemble grouper. It was prepared with a horseradish crust which should have been excellent. However, I had the feeling this was used to disguise a much cheaper fish. The fish had a very strong, unpleasant flavor and a very displeasing texture. Furthermore, it was accompanied by wild mushrooms which, however, were cut with much cheaper grocery store mushrooms. It was also accompanied by wild rice which though advertised as wild Rice more closely resembled an instant Uncle Ben's box wild rice medley containing about 10% wild rice and 90% much cheaper rice. Equally, my wife's fish, the Chilean sea bass which we normally love was so-so at best and her side dishes no better. The garlic mashed potatoes amounted to an ice cream spoonful worth of mediocre food and her spinach was basically fresh wilted spinach but with no interesting herb or spice to bring it to life.

I went for a selection of the standards, called the trio - rBQ (beef, pulled brisket, coleslaw, rbq sauce, smoked mayo), Butcher's Cut (beef, crumbled bleu cheese, caramelized onions, soy truffle vinaigrette, frisee, pickled shallots, red wine jam), and Fried Chicken (southern fried chicken breast, b+b pickles, spicy duke's mayo). They were all good (rBQ was the best of the three), but none were as good as the less-traditional burgers that my friends ordered (we all shared). One friend had the Vedge (house made beet, black bean, and brown rice patty, bibb lettuce, tomato, sliced jalapeno, carmelized onion, and sauteed mushroom). The other friend went for the Chorizo (chorizo-spiced pork, hashbrowns, fried egg, manchego, spanish paprika, almond romesco, smoked mayo).

It wasn't until another 15 minutes that a clueless looking waiter walks by and asks \\"have you ordered yet?\\", well we would have loved to if we knew what they had!  Without apologizing after we told him we havent recieved our menus he walked away and returned to toss us 2 menus briskly and continued to cater to other tables who arrived after we did.  I couldn't help but noticed how much time was spent with Korean customers vs. others and even though to some extent that is understandable as they can communicate more easily as most of the staff were less fluent in english, but it really seemed like we were given the cold shoulder from the moment we walked through the door.  After our menus came and our tea the wait just dragged on and on, it was probably another 15 minutes for the waiter to come back and take the order. When he did it was with such an unfriendly attitude, no eye contact, when we asked for the grilled meat he told us we had to order 2 of them to grill it on the table as if we were stupid, I was just praying he wasnt going to walk away for another 15 while we decided on another order.  After ordering a tofu dish and bulgogi, it was another long wait before just the little side dishes came out with no rice and no utensils we thought we were going to have to eat with our hands.  And that's what we did, until a bus boy came to clean a table behind us that I had to lean back and ask for chopsticks.  As we nibbled on our side dishes another 15 minutes went by which meant a total wait of nearly an hour with no food and by that time after a long day at work and it being 9pm I was so hungry and so frustrated I had to get up, go to the counter and offered to pay for my order just to leave.  I expected they would apologize sincerely but it seemed they did not even understand the reason for our dissatisfaction, and that irked me.

Alongside the pork, there was a grilled radicchio salad with a light dressing. It was crunchy and acidic, which was a good contrast against the fatty pork. I managed to get through 2/3 of the pork chop before calling it quits. It was definitely one of the best meals I've had. \\n\\nOther times when I'm been to Barley Swine, I've been impressed by very nice, meaty dishes. I've enjoyed their steak dishes on other occasions. Desserts are delicious. They are treated as a good ending to a meal as opposed to being something large and sweet. Overall, the dishes at Barley Swine are very flavorful and creative. I really like how the menu rotates and is seasonal. \\n\\nIf you are a foodie who likes to try new things and appreciates creative, flavorful dishes, you should visit Barley Swine!"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Short Story:\\nAn interesting place...better than Voodoo donuts!\\n\\nLong Story:\\nWe came here on a Sunday afternoon after a caffeine high at Stumptown for some good dounuts.

Better plan ahead and take time to enjoy yourself with your company. The only other way to look at it would be fine tuning your patience skills. Ikenohana is very comfortable in its surroundings tucked away in the strip mall. The staff fritters about in a casual way that unifies them in their slowness. Personally we had a great time, but if you're the type of person who loves Red Robin because they refill your Coke after two sips then you might pass on this sushi spot. Water, tea, whatever it is could run empty for a long time. Everything from sitting, ordering, and eating took a while, 2 hours. We were catching up with friends and some relatives who we hadn't seen in a while and relished the time. They don't seem to be slow for any particular reason, like a crowded waiting area, they're just slow because maybe life shouldn't move that fast. We made a few comments over the meal that it took as long as Apizza Scholls to eat and drink. \\n\\nOtherwise the food was stand up, especially for Beaverton, and you could tell by the packed house of locals.

I am not sure if dinner is not your strength, your best chefs don't work on Monday nights or I just came at the wrong time. It was the worst meal I ever had in the Dundee/Newberg area. Some specifics: \\n\\n1. If you have an open kitchen and you are a bored or not busy chef/person who works in the kitchen, it might be better to step away than be in plain sight of hungry customers wondering why it is taking so long to get their food when you are just standing there. \\n\\n2. There was nothing very chutney like (or tasty) about the mango chutney that came with the cheese plate. I also found foil on the cheese. \\n\\n3. The bun on my husband's pulled pork sandwich did not seem fresh. The pork was great...\\n\\n4. My 6 year old ordered the chicken strip appetizer (with the cheese plate) for his dinner. We heard one of the chefs say they were out of chicken strips after this order. We assumed that meant that we would receive our order. The plate came with three small chicken nugget looking things with the rest of the plate filled with French fries and a small cup of fruit. Even our server said the portion looked smaller than usual and removed it from our bill (after I asked if it was their normal portion size). \\n\\n5. The turkey saltimbocca I ordered was very dry even thought it was sitting in a pool of butter. \\n\\n6. My daughter ordered a taco salad. We thought it was clever that there were black beans on the plate to make sure the tostada shell holding the salad did not slide around the plate. However, there were no actual black beans in the salad which was very odd...especially since it was listed on the menu. The menu also said there was chicken in this salad. There was no chicken in our salad. \\n\\nAll three servers who were working in the restaurant at the time were very pleasant and attentive to their customers. I overheard one server tell a table that the cr√®me brule tasted great but did not look very pretty that evening so she was not comfortable serving it and recommended an alternative.

The handmade, fresh corn tortillas are especially delicious, but the burritos too are served so fresh and piping-hot that it's hard to find fault. The house beans are also tasty, and pleasantly you get a little appetizer helping along with your complimentary chips and salsa to start the meal.

(There are also coupons online - they have a handy search function for that.) They added on a $2+ delivery charge which I thought was weird because they require a $10 minimum for delivery - isn't usually a minimum order OR a delivery charge?

It arrived right on time - 8:11pm, just as the computer had predicted - and HOT!\\n\\nWe got 2 pan pizzas with Frank's hot wings. One Pepperoni Lovers and one with ham, bacon and olives.

This time around, we shared a blueberry tart. Delicious, the berries were very fresh and plump. The crust was absolutely perfect, buttery and crisp. The cream was light, smooth, and very creamy with the perfect texture. \\n\\nThe macarons are priced at $1.75 each but we went for the 7 pack for $11.95. It's quite pricey but it's a little bigger than the average macaron. Sure, they were really good but the presentation needed a little work as it was a little rough around the edges. But, I can't complain as we pretty much ate all 7 macarons before we got home. \\n\\nNow, I need to head over to Thomas Haas to check out the competition's macarons. Hunt for the best macarons continues.."},{"name":"Pattycake Bakery","address":"3009 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I am a weekly visitor to Pattycake, sometimes more than once a week. I am gluten free and also vegan, try to be soy free most of the time, so I usually go every Friday when they typically have the most gluten free treats. Even if you eat gluteny goods, everyone should try the gluten free brownie. It is the most delicious, fudgy brownie I have ever had in my life. The cupcakes are also great, and I think I'm addicted to the buckeye bar. \\n\\nI give Pattycake 4 stars because it is delicious, cruelty free, mostly organic, etc etc. and I love what they are doing for the community and the planet that we call home. However some of the ingredients I would not put together to make a muffin. While the banana nut muffin is yummy, I watch what I eat A LOT and I like to eat clean. I was disappointed that there was canola oil and tofu in the muffin. I do not know all the ingredients of my other favorite items.\\n\\nPattycake is delicious and I cannot express how happy I am that there is a cute, tasty place that provides vegan goodies to non vegans of Columbus!"},{"name":"Eden's Fresh","address":"500 E Central Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"One of the best salads I've ever had.

They have a pretty good selection of Korean dishes including a pretty good Bi Bim Bop. You can shop around the market while they make your food, so I would say it has a pretty good location. With that said, the service is horrible. The owners will rush you into ordering and they make it seem as if you're bothering them (by placing an order). The food would be 3 stars with 1 star service."},{"name":"Rangzen Tibetan Place","address":"24 Pearl St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"This was a thorough delight and a surprise. I found that Tibetan food was not at all like Chinese food--which I guess should hardly have surprised me, since\\n\\nFrom Beijing to Lhasa\\nIs like Austin to Boston\\n\\nTotally different experiences. So you better not call it Chinese food: \\"Rangzen\\" apparently means \\"independence.\\"\\n\\nPolitics aside, Rangzen is truly zen inside, a cool and relaxing interior, almost spa-like. I think only Chez Panisse has a more relaxed environment. Because it's one of the quietest restaurants I've been to, I think it would be good for, say, a fourth date.\\n\\nImmediately you find something in Rangzen dishes that you won't find in Chinese: citrus. I'm guessing that there are no lime trees in the Himalayas, but it's a tasty touch anyway.\\n\\nI especially recommend the tofu, cauliflower, and potatoes. The beef slices are savory. But everything is good here -- haven't had a bad meal."},{"name":"Hot Plate Asian Cuisine","address":"14845 SW Murray Scholls Dr, Ste 102","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"This place is really bad.

There are a lot of beers they offer, and they aren't ridiculously overpriced, I think it was like 5-6 bucks for draft. Now they do have some nicer ones that will run you more if that's what you want.\\n\\nThe food is not bad...I'm vegetarian so I can't comment on all the dishes, but they have some good bar food, like quesadillas, cheese fries, and nachos, with pretty huge portions so you can share. It wasn't amazing but it wasn't too bad either.
