She tried to make a reservation, and they said they weren't taking reservations for that day anymore but that we could call ahead and put our names down and they would start prepping for us (we had I think 10 people.) They call ahead and are told that Cowfish doesn't take call-aheads so we're all confused and wondering why someone just made that up earlier in the day. Management didn't seem concerned with our confusion and said they could try to sit us outside but it would be about 15 minutes which was fine. There was only one table outside that would fit us, and it was definitely already set up for 10+ people so we just kind of lurked near the door of the restaurant and stared at it, hoping someone would just let us sit down and give them money for drinks. I was a hostess in a restaurant so I know that empty tables doesn't always mean they're ready to serve us but it was a weirdly long time for all 10 of us to stand near our table. Anyway, that was all fine, we were in good spirits and we sat down eventually. Some of us got beers and a couple guys got milkshakes because the beers were as expensive as milkshakes. I ordered the cheese fries which are soooo good. I normally don't like cheese fries covered in super homogenous cheese, but these are yummy. For my main course I got one of their sushis shaped like a burger (the \\"4-S\\".) It was tuna/yellowtail + sushi marinated veggies in the middle and the buns were made out of kani and rice. I had been thinking about getting this since I visited the Orlando Cowfish location because it looked so interesting, but honestly this sandwich was a pretty big let down. The rice and alleged kani that made up the \\"buns\\" were wrapped in spring roll wrappers, but they were soggy and had a pretty weird chewy texture that made them hard to eat. The inside of the sandwich tasted fine but there was so little of it, especially compared to the awkward big soggy buns. Overall did not feel like 15$ worth of sushi, and I ended up mostly just eating the inside of the sandwich and my fries. I tried my fiance's burgooshi (the double cheeseburger one) and it was tasty, although a bit small to make a meal out of.I will say that the Cowfish I went to in Orlando was a better experience. We ordered a few raw fish appetizers and had regular burgers and everything was tasty.

Sorry... but from the website it looked like an upscale classy place, and from the outside it didn't. But it's all good! We walked in and it was clean and beautiful. We decided to order the bruschetta, hanger steak, and chicken piccata. The complimentary bread was yummy with the olive oil. The bruschetta is listed under snacks for a good reason- they give you three itty bitty pieces. Those little tastes were probably the best part of the night- they were heavenly. My taste buds squealed for more crunchy, cheesy bread. There was a herby bite from the peso and creaminess from the cheese. The tomato added a nice flavor and the olive oil made the end smooth and amazing.  34th Street Cafe knows how to tease you with their bruschetta- best bruschetta I've ever had!  I'm not saying their hanger steak and chicken piccata were bad, but the start was music to my mouth. Anyway, the chicken piccata was pretty massive, and it was settled over some lovely sauteed spinach and rice. The sauce was a tad bitter with the capers (in a good way) and was nicely placed so I could smother the ever so crunchy and juicy chicken in it. The rice was moist and a yummy addition as well.  It was a very very good dish, I liked it better than the hanger steak. I tried the steak and it was pretty good, it lacked flavor compared to the chicken piccata but it wasn't bad at all.

Even though I came after 1 PM the place filled up about half way while we were there. We stuck to just a few dishes: tacos of chicken and carnitas, and the chicken mol√© plate. These folks make their tortillas fresh, and I consider this the dividing line between the ordinary taqueria and the extraordinary. Theirs were moist and warm, a very good sign. Tacos are not enormous, but the meats were quite tasty, and a variety of salsas and escabeche are available at an open bar. The mol√© was deeply satisfying, with a rich complexity that sticks with you long after your meal is over. It came with two pieces of chicken (leg and I think a thigh) smothered in sauce, with pinto beans and some broth-cooked rice that was the perfect foil for the mol√©. The four additional tortillas arrived hot and steaming on the side. The chips and salsa that were served (no additional cost) were thin and crunchy, but did appear to be a bit oily, so I only had a few. The accompanying salsa was mild and fairly uninspired, but you could get the more interesting versions from the salsa bar if you wished.We're heading back soon to explore more of the menu, but so far, a complete winner. I see they've applied for a liquor license, and a cold beer would have made a great accompaniment to the meal.Just so there's no misunderstanding, this is a small, bare-bones establishment with no pretense or concession to fanciness.

Whenever I were to pick a place to eat, I make sure that my company will be suited for where we eat. Especially for vegetarian/vegan fellas. Although I can't deny the fact that they(vegetarian/vegan) are pain in the ass existence in my universe, I really want my friends to have just as good experience as I would. And often, I ended up somewhere dissatisfying for meat eater if we picked a place where can please vegetarian/vegan friends.But Myers + Chang has ended my long battled dilemma. This place can satisfy both parties equally.Their \\"default\\" menu is packed with meat eaters' delight. Pork this, beef that, BBQ this, Teriyaki that.. As I was the first one to arrive and waiting for friends, I was drooling only from looking at the menu as well as what the party next to me was eating.Vegetarian menu is available per request. My vegetarian friend was super delighted how many options there were for her. She even said \\"Ah... this is what meat eaters would get... So many options!!!\\"My favorite dish was tea smoked pork spare rib. It was tender, sweet and gorgeous.It was nice to see both meat eater and vegetarian burying their face on the food."},{"name":"Summer Shack-  Cambridge","address":"149 Alewife Brook Pkwy","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"So disappointed.  I ate here with my family this evening and the staff was perfectly accommodating.  However, when I saw the price of a steamed lobster was $32 for 1 1/2 lbs when it's going for $5/lb on the docks I had to ask why.  The manager came out and gave me an explanation about how everyone in Boston charges this and it's different in Cape Ann, and the rent is really expensive- and how just today the price shot through the roof .  Hmm.  That doesn't really cut it for me.  The lobster was fine, but the corn that came with it was not good, and the Indian pudding we used to love was watery and odd-tasting.  Sigh.

Now are waitress was pretty good to us, but I finished my food before my lady got her new plate/ basket of sweet potato fries and plus I payed for bottomless fries and only 1 round of fries. So I don't blame the waitress for what went wrong this afternoon with meal I blame the kitchen staff for the poor service I received because she asked them way ahead of time me finishing my meal.

However, since you met them at a young age, you are still good buddies.My main complaints about the Local are too many hipsters and too much cigarette smoke.  On the other hand, I did used to be a smoker and I respect the right of bars, clubs and even restaurants to allow smoking on their premises.  Despite my preference for smoke-free environments, I actually HATE our smoking laws because I think they are wrong.  So I respect the Local's right to reek of smoke...  I just don't prefer to go there anymore because the smell bugs me now that I've quit for several years.The beer selection at the Local is pretty darn good, as is the jukebox.  I have been there for karaoke, which I'm not even sure if they still have...  but it was a lot of fun.  Despite my complaint about hipsters, the people here are generally pretty nice and laid back.  The food is also surprisingly not-bad for bar food.  There is a good selection of items, and most everything I've tried has been damn tasty.Hmmm, even after my backhanded compliments, talking about this place is kind of making me want to pay it another visit.

INDOORS. We sat near the front of the restaurant first, but saw 3 flies hovering over our table and the one next to ours. So we moved deeper into the restaurant. Different table, same problem. Our table had a fly, the table in front of us had a fly, and the one next to us had a fly. Strike one.Note: The owner has his cell phone number by the cash register so we texted him to let him know.This place isn't really baby friendly. All the tables are high tops so a standard high chair can't fit. There are only like 3 regular tables where you could put a high chair. They only have 2 high chairs though. One family used up both so they brought out this contraption that hangs off of the table for your kid to sit on. Yea... can anyone say.. UNSAFE??? And ridiculous. It's held to the table with 2 vice like mechanisms. If the screws don't hold, your child falls to the floor. Also, you need to have a skinny baby to fit in that thing. Our baby is skinny, but even he couldn't fit in that thing.Strike two.Onto food...I always get the classic burger where ever I go--that's the best way to standardize a burger's rating. Wifey got the El Diablo (heard good things about it.)  The burger was fine. Meat quality was good. I really liked the Sassy Sauce--sorta like a horseradish mayo. The fries were a little underwhelming. They were pretty potato-skin tasting and salty.I took a bite of the El Diablo and it was super spicy. I guess if you love spice, you would love that burger. But I don't see the point when the spice overwhelms the entirety of the food you are eating and all you taste is spicy and nothing else. But...to each his/her own.Overall, I was not impressed with this place. $7-$10 for a burger is on the high end. I guess this would be classified as a gourmet burger joint. But I don't think it's worth it. I would pay $4-$6 for this place.Also, the wait time... The first time we went, the line was out the door so we left (1 hour wait).

OK, now that we've gotten the inappropriate jokes out of the way, lets get to business. I walked into Bj's already having information about the place. The CEO here once ran Cheesecake Factory, so I had great expectations. This place would be CCF if CCF painted their ceilings black, pushed the dimmer switch down a little bit more and placed several big screens around the place. It has a louder, more festive atmosphere than CCF. Its nice. A good place to bring a date and they stay open on weekends til 1am. Yay! No more having to go to the taco stands at Rundberg and Lamar with my wife backed up against me, her hand in her purse with her finger on the trigger of her Glock while I try to scarf down a few taquitos...The CEO brought along some nuances of CCF in case you missed going there:1. Waiters with aprons (white over black, instead of white over white)\\n2. Telephone book menu that you need a Kindle to read through\\n3. attentive food servers\\n4. nice atmosphere\\n5. large portions\\nI had the crispy jalapeno burger with fires. My wife had some huge salad, I think it was Sante Fe something or other. They were both very good. reminded us of Cheesecake factory, or have I mentioned this already?

We rolled our way out to the parking lot minutes later.Price alert!!  They call it a Brewhouse because they brew their own beer. No problem. The food servers go out of their way to steer you to their home brews. Good strategy, no problem. Each pint is $6.00. Problem. Well, problem for me anyways, b/c I'm a cheap ass, but for the record, the blonde brew house is a good flavorful beer but the pumpkin ale? It was like tapping into a fresh pumpkin with a straw. But I still drank it. So, if the price of their beer is not an issue for you then go ahead. For another $1, you could go to HEB and buy a six pack of Miller lites.

It tasted like hot (temperature-wise) spicy chicken, which is exactly what you want when you come into Gus's, but I admit I was longing for a little more depth of flavor in the form of some seasoning other than pepper. The mac and cheese tasted like quality mac and cheese (hot, melty, cheese-y) and the fried okra came out hot and crispy. The service was very good - checking on us frequently, smiling, being super friendly, and refilling water as needed.The star of the show here, however, was the chocolate chess cake with vanilla ice cream. Oh. My. God. I've literally thought about it every day since we ate at Gus's last Saturday night, and have discussed how amazing it was with my boyfriend multiple times. Neither of us are big dessert people, but we'd both go back to Gus's just for this.More pie-like than your traditional fluffy cake, it's a dense chocolate-y delight. It comes out piping hot with a frozen scoop of perfectly creamy vanilla ice cream on top. As the flavors meld together and you slip your spoon into the sweet hot cold chocolate vanilla melange they create, you will be the happiest person in Austin for a few glorious minutes. We couldn't stop raving about it even as we were eating it, and were both genuinely sad that we were too full to finish it. This is a must-order, no exceptions. (I'm actually mildly lactose-intolerant - if I have dairy in large doses I get a stomachache. I still ate my share of this cake, pain be damned.

I was recently visiting the area, walked by, and was drawn to this restaurant. They're conveniently fast. I sat there for a bit watching them push out one order after another for lunch. The prices are very fair, and you do get a lot of food. I had already eaten something not long before, but I had to try their Sushi Rolls. It was just 6 pieces, but quite delicious. The menu is small and very simple. The lady at the counter kept me waiting for a bit, even though I was the only person in line.

Overall, I like the place and think it shows some promise.  I do think there's room for improvement though.First, the milkshakes...YUM!!!  Krispy Kreme is where it's AT!  I've also had the burnt marshmallow nutella milkshake.  Personally, I was disappointed in that particular milkshake...I think it may have been too burnt for my personal taste.  But overall, the shakes are thick and have great flavors, so I will happily continue to partake.Now for the burgers and sides.  I do really like the burgers.  Some of the creations are a bit out there for my personal taste (while I will try almost anything once, I tend to like the simpler things).  Now, these are not huge, soccer ball-sized burgers, so some people used to larger portions may be disappointed.  But it's not necessarily a bad thing to have a more reasonable portion.  As for sides, I think my favorite has been fried zucchini.  I also liked the tater tots but I didn't see them last time on the menu?  Tear...Service and ambiance...now, here is where it gets tricky.  Sometimes I feel like the staff is too busy looking all trendy and cool to focus on service.  One of the times I went I had to get the hostess because no one had come by our table after we had been seated for 15 minutes--and I was with a client!  Another time our drinks went refilled for 10 minutes.  Not BAD per se, but it seems that the staff should be more attentive.  One time I had to use the restroom and the manager walking by informed me that the lock on the women's restroom door was broken--and it's a single stall.  I would think a restaurant trying to position itself as more upscale would have that fixed rather quickly (he told me it had BEEN broken).  Finally, the interior decor bugs me.  I have to admit, I am one of those who think that most trendy Buckhead/Midtown places are trying too hard.  But a restaurant should be more about food than scene--if I want scene, I'll go to a nightclub.  But that's just my personal bias.All in all, I would definitely go back.

The octopus was delicious and one of the best we have had in Atlanta. The beet salad was so good and very unique. It had a beet sorbet; I had never had anything like it and it was also delicious. The grilled whole fish we had was the striped bass. It was great, but it was one fish at $80 that me and husband shared. We could get that at other restaurants for half the price or less. We brought our 3 kids, who each had the orzo and red sauce at $8 a dish, and they were small portions. You know it's a small portion when all of them eat everything without me yelling at them to finish their food.

You write down (check-off) what you want on a pad and stick it in as holder on the table, they pick it up and it's served like tapas. For a girl who hates self-checkout I was bothered that I had to take my own order but I digress. The young lady who technically was our server was sufficient and acclimating us newbies to the restaurant. I had a margarita, nice and strong like I like it. I also order the chipotle slaw and 3 tacos (chicken, pork belly, and Baja fish). I've been dreaming sweet dreams about the pork belly and Baja fish tacos and chipotle slaw since I left.

Sadly, these tomatoes were definitely over-breaded which meant they were mostly breading. and the breading was over-peppered which meant they were like biting dry pepper bombs.

We asked for a table away from the door and the basic response was \\"Do you see any other open tables? No? You sit by the door.\\"\\n-OK, accepted the initial rub from the waiter. We discussed the \\"La Familia\\" menu. We discussed how we loved Braesola and this was listed on the daily menu. The waiter points out that this is a wonderful house made version of the classic dish; great we can't wait to try it.  The waiter does point out that the dishes in the \\"La Familia\\" service are at the chefs discretion; OK we're game for that. Somehow though, out of the 7 courses, no Braesola.  He must have neglected to pass on the preference to the kitchen.  At the level of fine dining this restaurant is selling, that's a screw up. \\n-The food was much as description described in other reviews.

I liked that the table had the control for the hot plate right under the table so you can control how hot it was.  The only thing that was below average was the service.  The waitress only came around twice to remove dishes, not fill up the soup or ask how we were doing, and after we finished we had to wait a long time for someone to come with the bill.

I love how they make it slightly spicy and pairing it with some extra hot sauce is the cherry on top of a cupcake. It's tender and just overall really flavorful! Their sides are pretty good as well and it goes great with the slight heat of the seasoning on the fried chicken. I would actually say it's now my number one place to go to for fried chicken.

They shake it up with an egg white, so it's frothy on top.  I had a drink that had pisco and ginger beer - which was equally delicious.  It had a bit of a bite from the ginger - so beware...if you don't like ginger steer clear.  If you love it like I do, this is the drink for you!First up: pork belly sliders.  Not Peruvian at all...but delicious nonetheless.We then had some fresh ceviche.  All of the seafood is local and sustainable (kudos!).  Next we had some anticuchos - which are like small kebabs.  Some chicken on a stick, and some beef heart slices on a stick.  Served on a bed of potato pieces with three types of sauces.  Yum.My favourite was the lomo.  It's hard to screw up a lomo, which is basically a beef stir fry.  (I think the dish originates from the sizable Chinese community in Peru.)  The bf was perturbed to find that it didn't come with rice, which I am told it always does back home....Lastly, we had a duck leg with beer rice.  Sounds weird, tastes great.

They had oil and vinegar in bottles and about 16 different creamy dressings. The creamy roasted garlic dressing was to die for! Then we found the soup line, which had broccoli and cheddar soup, jalape√±o chicken tortilla, shrimp bisque, and black bean chili. The shrimp bisque could have been a bit thicker in my opinion and kind of had a general seafood taste rather than a distinctly shrimp taste. There was a muffin line that had lots of seasonal flavors: candy cane muffins, gingerbread, and even gluten free options! There were some different foccacias, pastas (I loved the tomato pasta and the mac n cheese), fresh fruits, desserts, ice cream machine, and a hot tea bar with lots of different unique flavors.

The three flavors are awesome together, and the frosting is the prettiest color of pink. I also recommend the lemon poppy seed donut, which starts with a dense, buttermilk-style donut. The tangy lemon glaze tastes of real fruit, and there's just enough poppy to add a nutty burst of flavor to each bite. Perfect.Oh, and their coffee? Good stuff. Really.

And it may always be seeing as how their menu is always changing! I love the concept and the intimate space. I love that they don't take reservations. Show up and wait. Go over to Henri's for a glass of wine!The point is the food. It's amazing. Incredible. Words cannot describe. Everything I've ever eaten here has been exquisite. I'm a huge fan of this whole farm-to-table new American thing that's going on and no one does it better than Barley Swine. They are innovative and immaculate. They make the strangest combinations of flavors work. I'm astounded every time.Expensive? Kind of. If you follow their suggestion you'll probably spend... $40 or $50 a person. As always, ordering drinks is what makes your bill $100/person easily. But it's worth it!! Beware: this is the kind of place where they use beet foam and popcorn essence. Go in knowing what to expect."},{"name":"Xian Sushi and Noodle","address":"1801 E 51st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm super happy that this place is right by my house. The major draw for me to this place is their hand pulled noodles (which you can watch be made while dining). My only complaint that keeps them from having 5 stars is their lack of servers. I've been here over 8 times, and on every occasion they always seem short staffed. The servers that they do have are very friendly, but seem to be stretched too thin where it causes long delays between the table. It financially doesn't make sense as there seems to be a line to be seated while others are waiting to cash out. More servers would result in faster service and higher profits for everyone. TLDR; Noodles are great, but get more servers."},{"name":"Dr Feelgood's Pub","address":"20419 SW Tualatin Valley Hwy","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2.5","text":"Do not go on weekends as they have cover charge.

I already forgot what I ordered, but it was a flank steak sandwich which was spicier than expected -- I like spicy so it wasn't a problem, but if you don't make sure you don't get this. It was a pretty small restaurant in the East Side and it was oddly quiet for a Saturday night. They were able to get the food to us before we finished our first beers, so I guess there's an upside to eating at a small, quiet place. Loved the food, the service was great. Definitely recommended if you're looking for a quick bite to eat."},{"name":"Bauhaus Restaurant","address":"1st W Cordova Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My first visit to Bauhaus restaurant and what a pleasant surprise.

The spacious dining room, bar, and outside patio is great, also. I really enjoy how there are three distinct places you can sit, it's great. (I feel like an old guy saying this, but friends, I'm only 24) the lighting was really dark! It was so hard to see my menu! Gah!To the menu: super daunting. Maybe because I usually go to Parish on dates or with one other friend, so there's always conversation, but seriously, a little overwhelming. I totally appreciate that all of the sandwiches are made by chefs around Boston (am I right or did I make this up? Maybe I made it up) which is totally awesome.I opted for The Zuni Roll (according to their website: smoked turkey breast, crisp bacon, chopped scallions, dill Havarti cheese and cranberry-chipotle sauce wrapped in a flour tortilla). I think I had this all three times I came in, and it's pretty damn good. Punched with flavor, especially with the sauce they serve it in. So, I'm sure you are all wondering why Parish is receiving 3 instead of 4 stars... I'm super surprised they don't have french fries! I mean, I guess that's an extremely fast food / burger joint thing to have, but hey, we're American, we love those things! Instead, I got the mashed potatoes, which were delicious (but, I really wanted french fries).If you're in the market for a unique menu (that is filled with flavor) and you don't mind the restaurant being a little loud, give Parish a try."},{"name":"Art of Tacos","address":"75 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"These guys are AWESOME!

Although most people would like to go there during their busy hours (around 10am-1pm) but waiting for a table can get up to 1hr. So unless you're there with your best buds who've you've longed for an hr standing outside for a good bonding, I'd still recommend you to go before 10am or after 2pm. OK, so it's not the best time for a BRUNCH, as labelled to be, but food is nevertheless at its best.\\nReading the reviews, I took off to the Sky-train at Stadium.\\nOne of the best restaurants in Vancouver you can eat for a less than $20 budget!

While a little loud, and parking was not super easy, the overall experience was worth it. I like that they didn't bring out our main dishes together, so we could share them. We started with potstickers, which had just the right amount of spice, then I had the surf and turf, which wasn't too spicy, and then my wife had the udon. We sat at a table, which I think also made a difference, since we could hear ourselves and weren't jostling with others at the communal ones. Reservations were super easy with Open Table.

Fish tibs were spectacular and devoured in seconds by our table. \\nSecond, they really scored in service for me. We brought our ten month old and our server couldn't have been nicer. She offered to bring her a bowl of rice and someone had a highchair at the table moments after we arrived (usually at other restaurants you have to ask, and someone takes their sweet time hauling it from the back).

It seems harsh to only suggest one or two burgers on this menu, but I don't want to turn this into a two page article. The Goodnight is basically everything I want in a burger and caramelized onions, jalapenos and sassy sauce just put it over the top.

I think it is a bit on the overpriced side but portions are rather large. Mostly heavy American selections, your usual steak and lobster type of stuff. The interior is very large (two large dining areas and also a patio) but they often will close more than half the restaurant so there will be a wait even though only a third of the dining room is being seated.

This past time we went, we decided to stop by and were lucky enough to be rather close to the door.

Once we were inside, the line moved along at a good pace.I decided to try the Primetime with is made with Akaushi Beef, Brie Cheese, a Truffle Aioli, Caramelized Onions & Steak Sauce.  This burger was pretty amazing, almost perfect.   I say almost because the Brie was a strange cheese, in my opinion, for this particular burger.  Somehow I think the Texas Goat or even the Blue Jack might be a better flavor on this mighty burger; don't get me wrong, though, it was a very good and juicy burger. I am not a fry gal, but these fries were pretty amazing; and the chipotle ketchup is totally addictive!  Chris order the Buffalo Bill which is made with Bison, Blue Jack cheese, Frank's Hot Sauce (he loves this stuff, lol), Applewood Smoked Bacon & \\"Sassy\\" sauce (lol); I think his eyes rolled to the back of his head a couple of times (LOL).  He was totally engrossed in that burger.I saw they were offering for a limited time a Red Velvet Shake so I HAD to try it out; one word: DECADENT!  The shake had chunks, yes chunks, of red velvet cake all throughout the shake; it was the richest shake I have had in my life to date plus it was topped with real buttercream!!!  Needless to say, I could only drink 1/3 of it and had to take it with us; sadly, I was never able to finish it off, lol!The line may be daunting, BUT DO NOT let it stop you from checking it out; the wait is worth.

Yes, it's true. Barley Swine has relocated to North Austin (if Allandale just north of Koenig/2222 meets that criteria; it's still miles from Research Blvd, what I consider the true southern boundary to today's \\"North Austin\\"). The new contemporary yet rustic space is twice as large as the old and fans of the original will find that the dining experience, from service to presentation to flavor and texture, is just as delightful as before. Barley Swine remains among the best restaurants Austin has to offer and still is my top recommendation for any adventurous eater, i.e. those who are willing to try anything and will appreciate a surprise along with something familiar in each bite. We stopped in on a whim after learning the doors had opened for dinner on MLK Day. This will likely be the first and last time anyone can just stroll up with no reservation and experience a totally relaxed meal here with a quarter full dining room and the undivided attention of everyone working the place. Our original plan was to just sit at the bar, have a drink and maybe one or two shared plates, and then head over to our regular Monday night running group. Well, that plan was quickly dashed -- we were enjoying ourselves far too much to hurry away.We did eat our 4 courses at the corner of the spacious bar, which still provides a clear view into the large open kitchen, one that is massive compared to the old South Lamar space. There are purse hooks for Amy D and electrical outlets if you need to charge your device - how nice! From this vantage point, we were able to chat with the bar staff and hosts, as well as to meet a new server with the delivery of each of our plates.I'll come back to describe our drinks and dishes in detail a bit later (Nevermind, just read Joe C.'s review. and view my photos. Thanks, Joe!), but if you've dined with Barley Swine before, you know that each item was presented with a full description of its preparation and instructions on how to get the most pleasure from the dish. See what people had to say about the original restaurant over here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/barley-swine-austin .The dreamy bartender on this night suggested the perfect novel beer for me, Hitachino Nest, a Japanese red rice ale with an adorable little owl staring back from the label. I am now ruined for all other beers and will have to return to Barley Swine regularly for my next fix of this heavenly stuff: http://hitachinonest.com/en/beer/red-rice-ale. Luckily for me, the weekday Swine Time happy hour menu http://barleyswine.com/swine-time will launch later this month when the charming front patio is fully opened.Beware, parking may be a challenge, what with Lick and Bufalina in the same small strip there. Valet is available, and it appears that there could be additional space in the adjacent lot just south of there."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"It's official. My first 5-star review goes to Myers + Chang. Celebrating a late valentine's day, my restaurant buddy and I jumped on the silver line (which literally drops you off in-front of the restaurant) to give Myers + Chang a try. And it was amazing. Myers + Chang offers a selection of set menus at a discounted price on Mondays and Tuesdays, which allow you to sample some of their more popular options at a discounted price ($40 per set menu). We opted for the \\"pig out date\\" menu over the rest. All of the menus are themed and focus on a particular ingredient (seafood, veggies, healthy options) and are all $40. They also had a \\"blind date\\" option where the chef selects what you will be eating (think omikase). How much food do you get for $40? A lot. My friend and I were completely stuffed by the end of the night. Like \\"waive the white flag\\" stuffed. The first thing to come out was their triple pork mushu stir-fry, a mixture of veggies and three preparations of pork: loin, bacon, and sausage. Spoon some of this stuff in a mushu wrapper and add a little hoisin sauce and prepare to swoon. Very, very tasty. Next was the gai lan w/ ginger, a very mellow and smokey counter to the saltiness of the stir-fry. Two Pork belly buns followed that were immediately devoured. Highlight of the meal. Our final dish was the Cantonese lacquered bbq pork, which was served on top of some sort of fried veggie cake. A little too salty for my taste, but still good. The pork was cut into small hearts, a nice touch IMHO. And for $5 you can add on a desert, so we opted for the frozen vanilla bean parfait. It was topped with orange flavored snow cone shavings, which seemed strange at first but totally made sense after the first bite. Myers + Chang gets an A+."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Let's just get one thing straight, I usually don't like cream corn because it sounds weird and fatty, but man it was delicious!

After the meal, the waitress handed us our bill even though I didn't ask for it and I didn't have our dessert yet.

Steak and cheese is average, they don't put much steak in there so it's a lot of bread. Chicken parm is one of my favorites but sometimes the chicken can be a little dry. Very filling.

The only thing keeping from a 5-star rating on here is the fact that I don't get enough cheese with the cheese course or enough chocolate with the dessert course.  Then again, I'm probably one of the few people that have that problem as they give you way more food to dip than most people can eat anyway.  If I wasn't scarfing down every last morsel, I probably wouldn't be running out of dipping sauces anyway.The full meal can take a couple hours to slowly eat through and it's much better with a group of people than just a couple (but can be romantic too).

We went on I want to say a wednesday night but was pretty packed. We didn't have to wait long to be seated (there were 4 of us). Our server was the nicest person ever. She fully explained the whole ordering system thing to us and answered all of our questions. I had ordered a sweet tea which was like $2.50 I think or maybe $3.50. At first I was like whoa that's kinda pricey but i didn't care because I love sweet tea but they bring you a full glass of sweet tea and then also a liter of sweet tea so that kinda made up for the price lol. Also I ended up ordering something I didn't like at all and the server was really kind enough to take it off my tab. At the end of your meal they give you a free taco coin if you fill out a survey.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE about bar taco were the menu choices. They have a pretty wide arrange of choice for the tacos. Our waitress warned us they were small and to order at least 3. When I looked at the side options I was not impressed at all. They were vary vague not many options. Only rice they had was brown rice. I'm not a big fan of corn on the Cobb personally and the other choices were like pineapples? Why would I want tacos and pineapples? When the food came out I was just very shocked at how skimpy they were! I can understand small but there was barely meat on the tacos or even cilantro and onions. I ordered chorizo, shrimp, chicken, and portobello tacos. I really only enjoyed the shrimp cause that one came with cabbage and carrots on top. It was the least skimpiest of all. I'm a Mexican food lover and I came into Tia place expecting some really good tacos but this place was just very whitewashed. And the prices for tacos and the quantity, not worth it. I also ordered the churros and man was I DISAPPOINTED. I looked at my friend all excited for the churros like, cmon nobody can mess up churros?! But sure enough... they did. They were fresh and hot which was nice but when I bit into that churro... it tasted like I was straight up eating a ball of dough. There was no cinnamon on the churro just pure sugar which didn't help. They give you a side of chocolate with the churros which smelled so strong i was not interested in it (I'm not a fan of really chocolatey things). But the churro was so BLAND I thought maybe the chocolate would save it. That chocolate was sooo sweet I couldn't dip too much in it. And even then it wasn't even a good sweet chocolate. OVERALL I would not be coming back here. This place is really nice if you are uncultured and don't know what GOOD tacos are. I'd rather stick to my little taquerias inside the Mexican super Mercado.

I ordered a leg and a thigh but after gagging down the first bite and waiting a while I tried a second bite that I chewed for a minute and a half and then spit into a napkin. I took the other piece home for a second opinion and my wife concurred.

The frosting on this one was particularly disappointing, with no perceivable flavor, though the frosting on the cookie dough cake was much better. That cake was too salty, though, and maybe it was the point of it to taste different than just a chocolate chip cupcake, but I just felt like it was still lacking something.

I like to be able to eat a balanced healthy meal because I'm one of those fitness buffs who always tries to eat clean. During my visit, I didn't eat clean but I attempted to have a balanced breakfast. I ordered the belgian waffle and 2 scrambled eggs. The waffle comes with a side of meat and unfortunately they didn't have any veggie \\"meat\\" defrosted so I asked for salmon instead. Had I known that I would have to pay almost $10 for a side of salmon I would've stuck with my waffle and egg. Most places will charge you a percentage of the side item if it serves as a more expensive substitute. Or at least warn you of the high price.In my opinion this place has too many carb heavy/fatty breakfast foods and not enough healthy options like whole grains, vegetables and meat substitues. I would love a restaurant if they offered eggs with sauteed vegetables (like a scrambled omelette but half the amount of food), a side of fake meat (pushing it I know), and a belgian waffle.

Service was great as well, the bartender was very nice and attentive. What I need to come back for it their milkshakes, which everyone says are some of the best in Atlanta. I saw them on there but I was so full I couldn't eat one even if I had wanted to. So next time that will definitely be on the agenda."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Was lucky enough to have the chance to go right as they opened up the shop on a Thursday (the weekend line can be crazy).

So one evening we decided to go check it out.As soon as we entered, our first impression was about the extreme friendliness of owners and staff. They sat the two of us down fairly quickly and we started looking over their menu.We ordered a good bottle of wine, which was fairly priced. Then we ordered a couple of appetizers: chorizo over bread and the spanish omelette. They also sent us a couple of small tapas for ordering a bottle of wine, which I think was a nice touch. Our main course consisted of Paella Fideua and a few tapas (rabbit, octopus, potato/kale/leek croquettes).So why the 4 stars and not 5? Little things steered us to the slightly lower rating for the time being. The freshness of the food struck us first: head-on shrimp are a great way to tell the difference between fresh and frozen... those little whiskers on the shrimp would not be intact if frozen. These are the things that true food lovers want to see! We were very happy to see the use of fresh ingredients, authentic Spanish cooking and service with a smile, all wrapped up at a fair cost. Atmosphere was great. While we enjoyed our experience there, we felt some of the food could have been prepared a bit better. For instance, when butchering the rabbit, instead of chopping it, try cutting it at the joints, so the person eating it is not stuck chewing on a bunch of bone fragments. Also the shrimp on the paella was dry and a bit overcooked. The octopus was also a bit slimier than we are accustomed to. Small things that can easily be fixed.We'll be back soon for sure and will provide an update on Pintxo Pincho. We're happy to have this great little place in the center of Woburn!"},{"name":"Barcelona Wine Bar South End","address":"525 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"LOVE LOVE LOVEThe staff was amazing and the food super good, despite that I am from Barcelona and therefore I feel that some dishes could be improved I love my Spanish tapas!

My belly is happy I did. This is a cozy hole-in-the-wall restaurant specializing in German cuisine. As most people have noted, the dill pickle soup is worth the trip alone. If you like pickles or creamy soup, it is a must. For my entree, I had a combo platter of weinerschnitzel, bratwurst, sauerkraut, and potatoes. Everything tasted like it was made in-house, not from a can, and cooked to perfection. The schnitzel was crispy on the outside and moist and tender inside. The brat was juicy with that perfect snap from the casing. The sauerkraut was tangy without being overpowering or off-putting. The potatoes were sliced in rounds and soft, which is how they should be. Most places seem to undercook potatoes, leaving them almost raw.For dessert I had the Black Forest cake. I wanted a second piece. Walking in, the desserts are on display and can't be avoided. I highly recommend getting one after your meal or to go.Overall, this restaurant is wonderful. The waitstaff is friendly and attentive. The kitchen certainly knows what they're doing. The prices are very reasonable for the amount and quality of the food you receive. My only regret is that I no longer drink, otherwise, I would certainly take advantage of their awesome-sounding German beer selection.

I've been here 3 times and each time the food has been okay, but did not warrant the price or the hype. After coming here yesterday, I finally feel compelled to write a review. We had an out-of-town guest who was craving chowder. We weren't far from Alewife and I thought of the Summer Shack, but now part of me wishes we'd have gone to the nearest Legal Seafoods. The bowl of chowder had about 3 requisite clams in it and that was it. (Bowl, not cup.) I was also disappointed that the waiter spilled some of our friend's soup while making the walk from the kitchen. He apologized, but I wondered why he didn't go the extra step of actually wiping the plate off, instead of leaving soup and potato chunks splashed on the side of the bowl. (!) Thank goodness our buddy loves cornbread. It was literally the highlight of the meal and he made quick work of the breadbasket. I'm embarrassed that we took him there for chowder and it was so lackluster. Next time I'll heat up a can of Progresso clam chowder.

I have to say that I didn't try everything that they have but I've tried enough to realized that I'm not coming back.

I can't say anything bad about desert they did had a good selection of mini cakes, pastries as well as mini cannoli. For me they were just bla. Something that I can buy at supermarket.

The chicken dish and the hot and cold chicken salad were PHENOMENAL!!!  I didn't expect much and was deliciously surprised.  The Simple Chicken was breaded and came with a delicate, flavorful gravy - like Marsala but better.  The chicken had mashed potatoes, spinach and fresh tomatoes.  A piece of chicken with the tomatoes and spinach and that flavorful gravy made for a crazy delicious bite.  Total comfort food!!!!!  I want that chicken in my dinner rotation.The hot and cold chicken salad was Asian inspired and had tons of asiany flavors.  Sticky type rice on the bottom of the bowl topped with greens tossed in a soy dressing topped with perfectly grilled chicken breast slices - so satisfying.  Onion rings were crisp and not oily and the Summer Tomato Cucumber Salad was bright and lemony.  Overall a really great experience start to finish.

I now know that there is a location less than 10 minutes away from where I live in LA... if I knew that, I might not have traveled all the way to Austin to eat here lol BUT. No regrets. Their chicken was awesome. And it's probably cheaper in Austin than in LA.So it was just the 2 of us, and we ordered a good amount of food to share.. probably too much, but what else is new. First, we started with the fried green tomatoes, which I've never had before but heard it's an awesome Southern dish, so we went for it. An order came with 5 slices and a ranch (I think) dip. It was gooooood, crispy outside and juicy inside, but not quite like those red tomatoes. It's not sweet, that's for sure. It reminded me a bit of a fried zucchini. Very tasty.For the main course, we just ordered a shit ton of chicken, can't remember which combo. But from my pictures, it looks like too much. We also ordered fries and mac and cheese, and the order comes with some white bread. The chicken was super bomb, hot and spicy but not in an insane way lol. Like the average hungry person would be able to enjoy it. It was super tasty though, I love the seasoning that went into the chicken, because it's definitely way more flavorful than your regular fast food chain fried chicken. Mass flavors! The fries were pretty good, mac and cheese too. Those were just nice-to-haves, but not necessary to the meal. The white bread... I dont really understand this, it comes with your BBQ, fried chicken.. what else?

Moroccan brunch - you can't find that everywhere.  The decor is so cute and stylish.  The service is super friendly and efficient.

I ordered one as an appetizer with the salted caramel topping.  Wow.  I wanted to roll around in this all day.  It might have been one of the best things I've eaten all month.  The latte was as good as it looked.  It had a heart design in the foam and was such a delicious compliment to the waffle.  For my entree I ordered the tagine.  You could make it vegetarian - they don't serve the merguez and substitute with 2 big wedges of fresh avocado.  This was spicy and flavorful with 2 perfectly poached eggs.  A restaurant can get 5 stars from me just for that alone sometimes.

When I inquired about it I learned that it isn't only all you can eat sushi but things like beef teriyaki, chicken yakitori and many other items. Once I discovered this, I had serious internal debate. Should I go for the All You Can Eat and try to eat $18.95 or should I just order off the menu. After about 5 minutes, I decided to order off the menu. I had the Assorted Sushi special which was 2 rolls of 3 pieces (California and Tuna) and about 5 piecesof assorted sushi.

It makes you want to order a beer!!!Rightfully so Gordoughs restaurant offers many beers, drinks and wines. But is that why I wrote this review? Hell no. The doughnuts!!!!!Fresh, warm, crisphy on outside, very chewy on the inside. Almost every item on the menu is served with a doughnut. You have to try the Southern Belle. It has pecan pie filling, cream cheese, and candied pecans on top of a made to order doughnut.

My aunt owns a Thai restaurant IN Thailand and my mother has to be the best Thai cook in Vancouver.\\nSo, taking my mother to Maenam was very bold but I was curious as the write ups claimed authentic training from Bangkok.\\nI hate to say my mother is most likely not going to return and I may with my western friends.We started with the Thai sausage which was most likely my favourite, most likely because it was not done Thai style. I don't eat them in Thailand because they are only fermented and are raw, here at Maenam they were cooked whiched allow me to enjoy them without worrying about getting ill.We had the oft raved about Thai Duck curry. My mother found the flavours muted and a bit acrid on the end and she's ready to do a cook off with the chef to show him/her how to make it properly. I however, liked the dish, it wasn't Tha per se but the duck was good quality (albeit tiny portions) and the sauce flavourful.The crispy pork which i was salivating for on the menu was a HUGE disappointment, it was essentially deep fried pork belly quickly tossed with a few slivers of ginger, basil, lime leaves and peppercorns, which did not impart any flavour onto the pork. I love fatty pork, so I had no qualms eating all the fatty pork but it was dry and very disappointing and I do not recommend.Last but not least the prawn salad. Hmmmmm. The falvours in the sauce were bang on, the truest taste of the night but 5 prawns grilled with a heap of cilantro is not worth the $15. My mother has a suggestion if the chef is reading this, add in some slivered cucumbers and some glass noodles for a much more effective dish!We didnt have time for dessert and we were a tad disillusioned and I was feeling a bit off from all the dry crispy pork belly (that no one else wanted to eat).My thoughts, it's hip and trendy, they definitely are much better Thai then the Chinese-pretending-to-be-Thai Thai House but cannot beat Sala Thai on Cambie or Thai Pudpong in West Van, both owned and operated by Thai people for half the price.Good effort and a fun place to be but not worth it.

The lamb meatballs were super juicy and tender, while the stew is heavily seasoned and very flavorful. Avocado Toast tasted a little funky with the salsa, but it wasn't all bad. Waffle was soft and fluffy, but too sweet with the powdered sugar and dipping sauce.Overall, I'm glad I tried Medina Cafe even though it did not blow my mind.

In fact, a number of items on the website menu was not on the menu at the restaurant.  That's a little annoying.We ordered the paella instead, but first we started with the bruschetta.  It wasn't bad.  The tomatoes were nice and fresh and had a good flavour, but not crazy about the crostini it was on.  I prefer my bruschetta with freshly toasted bread.  Still, tasty enough, but seemed a little minimal for $8.The paella was very tasty.  Very fresh and flavourful with a nice mix of mussels, clams, chorizo, chicken and prawns.  Again, my only complaint would be that the portion was on the smaller size for a $21 item.  It was served nice and hot on a skillet, but I was left wanting a bit more.  Had the key lime pie for dessert.  It was really good.  Very fresh, homemade and delicious.  Coffee was good, although couldn't get a cappuccino as the machine was broken.Service was very friendly and helpful, but then again, we were the only customers!

Alas, some of my friends went in their usual attire, that is, jeans and sneakers.  As soon as we walk in, the maitre d' informed me that they don't allow sneakers in the dining room, so please hide their feet.  Snobbery, but whatever.After we were served our appetizer, two of us were done and one was still eating.  Our servers took our finished plates and started giving us our entree.  While my friend was still finishing his appetizer, they decided to take away his bread plate and shift his appetizer plate to the right hand side AS HE'S STILL EATING.  Our friend ordered the short rib entree.  I've never been to a restaurant where they serve beef without giving us a steak knife.  My friend was obviously struggling to cut his short rib, so I had to ask for a steak knife on his behalf.  Our server reasoned that the rib is very tender, so it shouldn't be a problem.  Whatever.In the midst of our dessert, the server gave us comment cards to fill out.  Of course, I filled it out as \\"mediocre food at best (though I really wanted to say, can't beat me enough to force me to pay $25 to eat crappy diner meal).\\"  But before we even pay, he decides to take our comment cards, and starts to read it right in front of us.  Needless to say, my friend felt it was VERY awkward.  I, however, still maintained my stance that the food was sucky and they desperately needed some re-modeling (the ceiling above the clock was peeling off).  Food:  Like I said, the food is mediocre at best.  The fried calamari was nothing to sing home about.  I think I can get similar food at PF Chang's.  I ordered a crab omelette.  It tasted like a diner omelette.  Well, I guess that would be insulting to the diners.  I couldn't find much crab in there.  Finding a piece of crab is harder than drilling for oil.  And the ice cream.  I can't believe they'd serve GaGa's ice cream.  I think you can buy it at Whole Foods.  Why would a $$$$ place serve store bought ice cream?!?!  Seriously!  If I wanted to eat Whole Foods ice cream, I'd go there.  And I think I can also dress it up with berries myself.  Ambiance: Yeah, I know that you're old school and you've been here for a while.  But honestly, your ceiling's chipping off.  There are AC units camouflage on the ceiling.  I don't understand how this restaurant could have survived for so long.  I know Lydia Shire supposed upgraded the food (really? I hate to imagine what it was before), but hey, while you're at it, think about hiring a firm and sprucing up the place to its former opulence.  Parts of your ceiling have gold cover and parts not.  And the bar that stretches across the restaurant sometimes had dirty dishes there.  It just seems particularly awkward.  Ok, ok, I think I'm just still pissed about the whole restaurant experience.

And they make a really lovely Bellini.  Their happy hour is generous, with both food and drink specials.  I've brought a lot of friends for first-time visits because I want my local  Italian spot to thrive.That being said, there have been some notable disappointments lately.... mostly from the kitchen and mostly issues of consistency.   I brought one friend who ordered the chicken saltimbocca every time we came...until it came out smaller than usual, and DRY.  I was a real fan of the mushroom pizza (add prosciutto and arugula..YUM) until the night it arrived burnt.  I don't mean a little charred on the edges, I mean so burnt it was brittle.   They remade it without complaint, but seriously....that pizza should have never been sent out in the first place.  Did they not notice....or did they think I wouldn't?Then last night, during Restaurant Week,  I ordered the Margherita pizza.  The crust was perfect, there was lots of cheese (very little basil, unfortunately).... and half the tomatoes were completely burnt.  Now I fully appreciate the wonderful flavors that develop in a nicely roasted/caramelized tomato, but these were charred and hard.  Since the rest of the pizza was fine, I just pulled off the tomato briquets and asked them to bring me some unburnt tomatoes.  But again, why did that pizza even get brought out?

I used to regularly grab drinks and food at this location when it was Tavern on the Water with friends after work.  It was a great neighborhood hangout where you could take in a beautiful view and get cheap drinks (for the city that is) and (lousy) cheap food, especially in the warm weather.  The new owners turned it into a way overpriced restaurant with a great view. Charlestown desperately needed a new tavern-like restaurant/bar.  All they had to do is give the facelift (which they did) and provide basic decent food at reasonable prices.  Instead they tried to get too fancy with the menu so overall the prices are really high for average food and the drink prices now match food menu (overpriced that is).  It's hard to take a date there and not spend $75-$100 and leave feeling very disappointed.I definitely would not recommend this place however I tried it 3 times in the first 2 months of being open and now I see that they added the $13 burger to their menu so I might give them another shot even though that doesn't mean they improved the quality of their food."},{"name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant","address":"Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park 775 Werikhe Way","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"I have only been to the full service of Yak and Yeti once.

So walking in with Ah-Ha's \\"Take on Me\\" on the radio and Ghostbuster's and The Breakfast Club (obviously) posters on the walls and ceilings made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.Taking a seat at the counter, I was able to watch everyone's breakfasts being made because the griddle is right out front.  I had \\"The Criminal\\" (all the specials are named after characters from The Breakfast Club and other 80's classics) which was two eggs, homefries, toast, and meat (I had sausage).The red skin potato homefries were excellent - seasoned and spiced extremely well without onions or peppers (I'm a minimalist).  The sausage was also excellent, with the crispy skin I'm looking for in a breakfast sausage.Overall I had a really great experience, but I had to take off a star because I ordered the free-refill coffee, yet was never offered a refill!!!

The Tikka Masala is made with white meat and the hubby likes this one.They have an incredible lunch buffet, especially on Fri.  The only problem is that everything is made mild and find it quite tasteless compared to the added heat of a medium curry.Oh the spicy vindiloo.  I ordered that hot one time and proceeded to cry and sweat during the entire meal.  Yummy, but never again.Skip the appetizers in my opinion.  The crab cakes are mediocre.  I tried to talk the hubby out of ordering them.  Who orders crab cakes at an Indian restaurant.  The mussels are good, but the curries are far superior.On a side note, one of my friends ordered a salad when we were here.

We also tried an appetizer of well cooked kitfo slice which was also good.We also got the vegetarian platter (SUPERB!), literally all tibs on the menu (including lamb, chicken, filet mignon, salmon and ground beef). My favourite was the chicken and lamb, but the filet mignon and salmon were superb as well. The ground beef tibs were ok. Make sure you order it with awaze if you like spicy food and layer them over shiro! Special mention for the vegetarian platter which is absolutely superb considering the amount of food and delicious options on the plate. The lentils (miser) served with vegetarian platter and the tibs (if you order it as side) was finger licking good.

This place is a little small but it can sure fit a lot of people at once! We sat at the breakfast bar in front of the barista to avoid longer wait. We already figured out what to order so not wasting time we ordered a large lavender latte and a small mocha. According to the server, all sizes have 2 shots of espresso so the smaller it is, the stronger it is. Interesting, but lighter is better for me so my stomach won't get mad at me. Other then that, we ordered the fricasse, a side of waffle with white chocolate pistachio rosewater sauce, and a side of bacon. The fricasse is a dish with braised short ribs,  roasted potatoes, 2 sunny side up eggs, and served with grilled focaccia. I'm not a fan of braised short ribs or any kind of shredded meat bc of the soft texture and tastes so meaty. My boyfriend loved it though. I only tried a little of the meat, it's bearable and better than the short ribs I had from Roy's. I had everything else from that dish, the potatoes were flavorful and the focaccia was great with the sauce and the runny egg yolk. The julienne strips of green apple on top also made the dish less heavy. The bacon on the side was delicious!! It was thick cut, not too salty, glazed and garnished with cilantro. Best bacon I had so far!!! I would actually call it pork belly than bacon. Drool...Last, we ended the meal with the precious waffle (I consider anything that I like are precious) :-) Poured half of the white chocolate pistachio rosewater on top of it and what to do with the remaining half? Being a fatty, I poured the rest of the sauce to my latte since it was kinda light..they have that flavor latte anyways!

Low and behond, they tell me there will be a 45 minute wait.... And there clearly are empty tables... I'm very confused. But being a pragmatic person, I say \\"Are, you serious?\\" and they confirmed, that they were indeed serious, and apparently also bad people.Unfortunately for the piss poor hosting staff, it's the 21st century, and I can make a reservation on my phone, and did get seated, albeit 10 minutes late.

Kellys has a great reputation starting with the location on the beach in Revere. This is not the same owernship. I believe there are separate family members that own different locations. It's certainly evident at the Danvers location. Revere and Saugus are good. Danvers is not. Here's why:I've been going to this location on and off for a few years - always hoping it will get better or change. By the way, it's not all bad. The staff are super friendly but it's evident that mgmt/owernship is concerned chiefly about the bottom line. *It all started a few years ago when I overheard a manager complaining about the number of napkins the guests took and \\"wasted\\". So, they changed the napkins to single napkins that you pull out of a box. Not a big deal but a small item that adds to the equation-.*The quantity of food that you receive has decreased markedly over the years. You've always paid a bit more for quality food...but at the other Kelly's, you receive more. It's almost as if the staff are on strict orders to decrease the number of fries/onion rings on a plate order or side order. It's not even close to the other Kelly's locations.*As other reviewers have noted, the service is SLOW (especially the drive-thru). I have been offered 10$ gift cards 6x over the last twelve months as an apology. On the plus side, I was offered them without asking for anything. That said, I would rather have just received my order accurately. The quality of the food has dropped too. You can order a roast beef sandwich and have it be ice cold. Like what happened today. You can order the wraps and have them prepared the wrong way. Roast beef will come out rare when you ordered medium well. It's hit or miss. Kelly's has always been known for overdelivering for the price paid. At this location, it just doesn't happen. You pay $16 for a kids chicken plate and roast beef sandwich fries/onion rings plate. You receive 12 fries and 3 onion rings on the roast beef plate and you receive 3 medium size chicken strips. That's not the Kellys I know and it motivated me to write this review."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We went 20 minutes before opening and we were fortunate to be the last few people to sit at the bar.

If you're in the mood for a light breakfast, I recommend this dish. The hummus with beef abs running eggs was fantastic.

After an hour and half we decided to leave, we asked to be closed out and we would pay for the drinks and appetizers. The manager came over and apologized that they messed up our order. At this point we didn't want to stay because it took them an hour and half to notify us.

Being a Paleo eater, burger joints are great because I can always get the burger without the bun. At Flip, a lettuce wrap option is specifically listed on the menu. Mucho gracias. Even better, I spied a grassfed burger patty (The Farmer, $10) on the ever-changing seasonal menu. Bonus points for that. I hope to see grassfed options more often on the menu.My husband ordered the Ossobuco burger off the November specials list-- veal breast, braised ketchup, gremolata mayo, crispy shallots, micro parsley ($12). It looked great if messy. Unfortunately, the cloth napkins were utterly useless against it. That brings me to one of my only gripes with dining at Flip. You get to wipe your hands on plastic.I opted for a high-fat, low carb route with the D'lux burger -- black diamond beef, seared foie gras, wild mushrooms, and truffle aioli. It rang in at a hefty price of $21. Don't judge. You can always get a classic burger for $7. This burger did not disappoint. However, the patty was topped with a pile of sauteed shallots (?) that were not listed on the menu. That, I could have done without. Otherwise, freak'n tasty burger.Additional bonus points go to Flip for the always interesting, upscale sides. I loved the pan roasted brussel sprouts with bacon lardons and ginger bacon vinaigrette ($5). Paleo eaters, watch out for the sweet potato tots. I had these a while back and was told they are not made by the restaurant. The sourcing is not a problem in my book but the tots have a coating which do not make them gluten-free. But they sure were tasty!Overall, as a paleo eater, this place may be too tasty to resist temptations. If it's cheat day, then head on over. My former foodie slut self gave an audible gasp at the Paton XO Shake on the menu -- Patron XO cafe, vanilla ice cream, caramel whip creme, chocolate shavings ($10). Wish I could've order it. The shakes are always great tho. Personally, I'd skip the Krispy Kreme Shake (tastes like the oil the doughnuts were fried in) and go straight for the Nutella Marshmallow Shake ($5.50).

The fly's germs were already all over the other ice. I asked her to let me talk to the manager, but she was just as useless!  The manager told me that the ice bin had been serviced that week and some flies may have gotten into the bin.  All I wanted them to do is empty the ice bin , clean it, refill it, and comp me for my fly infested drink!

I've tried others around the area, and was heavily let down. 360 Pizza's food was fresh, hot and tasty. I tried their pepperoni pizza and their meat calzone. The calzone had a golden color on the outside and wasn't tough or doughy to cut through. Inside, the sausage and pepperoni actually had flavor and not just salty. The cheese they used was really good. The pepperoni pizza was perfectly made and cooked. The big thing I look for is the pizza dough. Thin and crispy without the texture of a cracker or flat bread. The sauce and the meet was cooked well. They didn't slide off the dough. The place has a real casual vibe, nothing too fancy. It's what I expect when i'm looking for good pizza. The employees were attentive and nice and the owner was awesome. Spent a little time chatting with me even though I could tell he was really busy. I'll be back for more.

I pass on the fruit salad and orange juice as they aren't worth what they are charging.On the weekend I either go around 9 am when they open or 10:15 ish after the first tables have finished and I usually don't have to wait too long to get a seat.

It's fatty, greasy fare that tastes awesome, but inevitably you'll hate yourself. Remember, one meal isn't going to kill you!

I've never had a garlic bread side like the garlic donut that came with my meal and I don't think Italian restaurant bread will ever be the same - the donut trumped them all.

I played a little basketball (I looked pretty rusty, but only because that barrier was different and the usual game moves but this was was stationary). I also learned how to play Boce...but two games in my teacher decided to get a drink and left me to converse with others...boo!Anyway, I did leave the basketball and Boce and mingles with others until a new guy decided he wanted to be my new stalker . Weird, just weird. Anyway, I made my way over to the bowling lanes where there was a competition going on amongst many. My way of trying to mingle and get away from the stalker (no such luck). The bowling game was interesting. Snack foods and alcoholic beverage were served and it looked decent although I really didn't indulge as I'm trying to get my life together and make better decisions which is probably why I did most of my mingling around the games and not the food. It was a good strategy.We left around 845p to catch an Uber...I didn't think I would be coming back so soon but ended up doubling back when I figured out I had dropped my work phone somewhere inside the venue. With that being said the staff was very nice but not helpful as they were busy conversing with one another to help out but left me back in to look. Two seconds and I had found my phone as I figured it fell out of my jacket. I hadn't eaten or drank anything so I know it had to be there or one other place. Overall, a great place to hang out.

My wife was turned onto this place by her friend who has an allergy to egg products and my wife brought home a cookie one day and said, \\"Go ahead and try it.\\" I did and my first reaction was that it was fantastic and my second reaction was, \\"This is vegan! Isn't it supposed to taste weird?\\" Honestly, unless you told someone, you would have absolutely no idea that the products in this bakery are vegan. Vegan or not, you should definitely try this place out. Pattycake has a great selection of cookies, whoopie pies, brownies, cupcakes, and they sometimes have cake slices sitting out as well. Their prices have gone up a little bit in the last year so don't plan on leaving this place without spending at least $10 but the quality of their products is typically very good. I think you end up paying extra for the fact that the products have no animal products in them (tradeoff). The cookies and cupcakes are large and moist. The only negative experience that I've run into is going to the bakery on a Sunday. I ended up getting some semi-stale products there and they were less than stellar. Stick to going to this place during the week or on Saturday. Oh, you can get these products at Raisin Rack (they have a small section next to the bread) but my experience is that you should get these from the bakery directly as most of what you find at Raisin Rack has been sitting for a while and has become stale.  Additionally, it looks like any of their products that you buy out of their store are somewhat smaller than what you would find inside their store.  My wife and I were just at the Hills Market this past week and we saw the Pattycake kiosk and 1.) were surprised at how much smaller all of the items were and 2.) noticed the really high prices.  My suggestion is that if you want to spread the word on how good the products are, or, if you want people to try them, you've gotta keep the prices out of the \\"outrageous\\" level.  So yea, go to Pattycake directly if you can.  You'll end up paying less money and getting large portions (and fresh!) that way."},{"name":"Bauhaus Restaurant","address":"1st W Cordova Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"If German fine dining means uncomfortable and awkward with a hint of insulting while eating delicious, poorly described food then Bauhaus nails it.  We attended on a Wednesday evening and the place was only about 25% full.  We were greeted and seated rather awkwardly by a waiter that seemed to assume we were from out of town.  Initially we were put at a small table right up against a wall making any knife work impossible unless you had one right-handed and one left-handed person and you had them seated appropriately with their knifing hand away from the wall.  Additionally the chairs are possibly the most disturbing element in this restaurant.  They're a bit bouncy but that isn't the problem - they're made of cheap metal that is ill-fitting in the frame so it pops in the middle like a tupperware lid.  I mentioned it to one of the waiters and he said \\"guess you're just not used to it\\" - guess I'm not, not used to rude waiters either at a $30+ a plate bistro either.  He wasn't our waiter so he didn't have to worry about ruining the other guy's tip I suppose.  Our waiter admitted that the chairs are a sore spot and that they are discussing how to deal with them.  So we changed tables to a nice location in the middle of the room. The chairs at the new table also popped - I traded chairs 2 more times until I found one that wasn't as uncomfortable.The waiter first brought a free sample foie gras / pear appetizer which was absolutely delicious. This was followed by some sourdough rye from Nelson the Seagull bakery around the corner with salted butter and a lemon cheese spread, also excellent. We ordered the Fried Blood Sausage appetizer which came with apple mustard and sauerkraut - highly recommended.  For our entrees I ordered the Geschnetzeltes which was absolutely amazing - perfectly tender veal and mushrooms in a savory sauce with a side of spaetzle. My wife ordered the Goulash, this is where things got weird.  Instead of what anyone in eastern Europe would call goulash, she received a very tender roast in a red wine sauce like bourguignon without a hint of paprika to be found - a single piece of meat in sauce.  It was delicious! Just unexpected.  The accompanying dumpling was interesting and unusual, quite good.In conclusion - the food was excellent, the utensils and dishware were unusual and delightful, the seating is uncomfortable with bad table arrangements, and the waiters need a lesson in manners.  Hope they dial in the chairs and dial back the wait staff - they don't match the cuisine."},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The sausage was kind of salty but eating it with the mac and cheese or the rice adjusted it.

The atmosphere was great and had the classy feel I was looking for that evening.  I was impressed with the variety of selections, too.  I ordered the samosas, 1 veggie and 1 chicken, for appetizers--next time I'll just order the veggie ones as I found them to be much tastier.  I also had a small side salad with their tangy homemade mango vinaigrette.  For my entree, I ordered my standard vindaloo, this time with beef, at medium heat.  I have to say I was not all that impressed.  I much prefer the vindaloo over at Sarovar because it is much spicier and has a bit more sauce.  However, my friends all ordered the mixed grills--the veggies and the meat--and they were fantastic.  Next time I know to stick with the grilled fare and nix the curry dishes.  The naan bread was thin but still tasty.  All of us had a bit of the mango ice cream and the mango cheesecake for dessert, both of which had a nice flavor.

I think that in all my time in Portland, well over two decades, I have never had worse service while sitting at the bar.  We sat down in half filled bar with a working staff of at least 10.  It took at least 5 minutes for the bartender, and I use that term very loosely, to mosey on over and bring us the beer and food menu.  We a ordered a few mediocre beers and waiting for the young blond behind the bar to return for our food orders.  The staffed milled around yacking amongst themeselves as at least one customer came up to one of the wait people and asked for a bill.  Eventually I flagged the bartender of the half filled bar down and she give me with ultimate idadaine the the \\"i am doing dishwashing sign.\\"  She had been  actually standing for ten minutes talking with an employee that did nothing else but stand and talk.  It was comical and a frankly a little pathetic to see the number of employees standing around doing nothing productive.   The bartender and most of the staff were obviously in well over thier depth and had limited to non training on customer service. Finally, after about fifteen minutes after getting out menu, we ordered for a burger which I am told was very good.   We got the burger very quickly and my colleague tells me it was very good.  When we went to check out another woman came over and took out card.  She seemed like she knew what she was doing and was vey pleasant.  That is more than I can say for most of the staff.  The place was overstaffed, the staff was ill trained, the beers enter was both slow and unpleasant, and the beer was at best average by Portland standards.  Why would anyone drink or eat at this place?I would not recommend this place to anyone for thier really is nothing to recommend about Burnside Brewing in a city full of good beer and great food.

Decor feels a little rustic, yet hip and comfortable.

My favorite breakfast dish is Cassoulet. It consists of two eggs on beans, saussison de Paris, bacon and andouille. Grilled foccacia is served on the side. The flavors are very complex and delicious from the spiciness of the andouille to the smokey and sweet flavor of the bacon. The foccacia is light and airy.\\n Our daughter always orders two waffles and a side of bacon. The waffles are ridiculously small for the price, IMO, but our daughter enjoys them along with the sauces. Her favorite sauce is the rosewater. The bacon is super thick, smokey and succulent.

Though it was a bit of a rainy night around 10 pm FLIP had a surprising amount of cars outside (or maybe it was the small parking lot). It has a retro and chic feel to this restaurant as we sat down, the ambience was table chatter mixed with eclectic dance music, TVs boxed in with expensive looking art frames, and tables put so close to one another it looks like one long dining table. The place is overall small, which I would imagine would cause issues on a Friday or Saturday night, however the burgers and the food were phenomenal. I ordered their Mango Martini, now I'm normally not a vodka girl but this drink was tasty and served chilled by liquid nitrogen which gives it cool points (HA PUN.) Then came the burger, which I ordered the Butcher's cut which was a perfect combination of sweet, tangy, and that pungent flavor of bleu cheese. The meat was a little overdone for my taste but I didn't mind, I wolfed the burger down happily leaving no trace it was ever on the plate. It was a new experience, in a new atmosphere. I would be most interested in trying their D'Lux burger which includes the controversial foie gras and is a whopping $21, I decided to favor a more tasty $8 Butcher's Cut. Finally, the Nutella & Toasted Marshmallow milkshake was pretty decent though I would like more Nutella flavor overall it was a delicious combination to satisfy my chocolate needs.Overall, the restaurant is a good one, a new experience with interesting combinations of foods and interesting techniques of serving. It is a bit pricey and the sides, unlike most places, are sold separately. So if you feel like treating yourself to a nice burger I would recommend FLIP to those willing to try new things, with a hip new chic style."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"One of the best burgers you can get.

The reviews are all over the map on this place and no one has reviewed in 2013, so I thought I would take a minute and give a few of my thoughts. First, Atlanta does need a couple more establishments where the emphasis is on wine, not beer. You can find great beer joints all around the city, but wine places are a harder find, with the most popular spot in town, being Barcelona. Pour is NO Barcelona. The demographics are different in Brookhaven, however with the construction of a large apartment complex on Dresden, there should be more people within walking distance to take advantage of the space. The wine selection is good, not great. You can hit all of the major categories of wine by the glass, but quite frankly, Ecco and other places around town offer a more extensive list. The menu is limited and since the original reviews (which go back to 2011), they have gotten the food license and ofter a moderate offering of entrees and appetizers. On two different occasions, I have had the hummus (nothing special there), the baby arugula salad for $9, which was not a generous portion and fairly pedestrian, trio of beef sliders (a much better burger can be had within a 20 second walk to Kaleidoscope) and the Atlantic Salmon (which was a bit over-cooked). Nothing was awful, but nothing was remarkable, so therein my rating of 3 stars. I ate there on a Wednesday (nobody in the place) and on Friday (a lot more crowded, but not packed). Service was fine, on Friday when there were more people, they seemed to be a bit under-staffed.Brookhaven NEEDS places like this in order to be a thriving neighborhood. I want to see Pour do well, I am just not sure if it can find it's stride sandwiched between two other popular spots. Also, they could use some more promotion. Wine is niche here in Atlanta. Everyone seems to drink it, but few really cader to that demographic. K'Scope and Verde attract a younger crowd at times, it remains to be seen if Pour can differentiate themselves and capture some of the buzz that a Barcelona has."},{"name":"Rangzen Tibetan Place","address":"24 Pearl St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Everything about this restaurant is perfect, from the cozy decor to the service to the FOOD.

Was really looking forward to a good meal and experience.  The meal was good, the experience, not so much.The fish was prepared well with tasty, well prepared sides.  The wine was priced reasonably, and the dessert was great.  The challenge with this restaurant was the noise.  It was too loud.  So loud that I felt compelled to download an app for my phone to find out just how loud it was - 95 - 100 decibels.  OUCH.  Noise at that level will effect your hearing if exposed to it for more than three hours.  Which bring me to the second issue - it took three hours to eat a three course dinner - not because we were taking our time, but because the restaurant was that busy.  I literally walked out with my ears ringing.I think one of the challenges of this restaurant, which relates to both of the above issues, is that they have set the restaurant with too many tables.  If you get a table using one of the banquettes, you will get to know your neighbors, and will be a part of the conversation.  The restaurant feels crowded.  They could remove 10% of the tables and the restaurant would still be filled.Finally, they should turn down the music in the restaurant.  All it seems to do is to raise the ambient noise level so that you have to raise your voice in order to be heard by the person across the table.  Now, imagine 250 people doing this at the same time - the result is a loud as a jet engine - literally.The real problem with the restaurant is that they charge you as if they are a high end restaurant (CAD $175 for two people - three courses and a bottle of wine).  However, because of the service and noise, it comes off as a three star experience.I would eat here again, but ONLY if it was half empty."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The food here was amazing.

We had a party of 16 for a friend's birthday, so I cut them a little slack, but still not worth 3 stars. I was quite underwhelmed by the place. They don't take traditional reservations, which was annoying as we had a party of 16. Someone got there a little early to put our names in for a table. We had cocktails, which were nice, but not great, and reasonably priced. The bar service was great. (I asked for change after dinner back at the bar, for the valet, and the bartender asked me how the mojito was from 2 hours before).The place was VERY loud, with the music blaring. It was a Sunday night and an older crowd, so there was no reason to have the music so loud. We could only really talk to the people 1-2 people to the side of us.The guac and tomatillo salsa were both very good. They have these large corn tortilla chips, half of which were oily/soggy and more of a pain and not worth the kitsch factor. The grilled corn with spices and cheese was excellent.The tacos were TINY. The smallest I've ever had. I had three and that wasn't nearly enough. The chorrizo was very good, but the grilled fish was average and was the smallest chunk of fish I've had in a taco. Smaller than a fork-bite. Less than half the fish you'd get in any other taco place. The service was weird. Granted we had a table of 16, but the server insisted on splitting the table in half so that the whole table would get our food at the same time. They split us between the bithday boy and his wife, despite his protests, which was just odd. Plus that didn't work at all, as food came trickling in for 30 minutes. Their system for writing your own orders on card might work for small parties, but it was horribly confusing to us and to the servers. The tacos came out lined up on large trays and the server tried to explain what they were, but it was so loud and chaotic, it took quite some time going back and forth and back and forth to figure out what was what. Overall the place was below average. Drinks were a B+, food a B, service a C, atmosphere a C+.

It's amazing to me that it works out so that there's no wait by the time you get through the line... but the line was pretty long when we went for Saturday night dinner. Still, it was a great choice for a nice, easy meal after we'd given BBQ, ramen, and fancy sushi a go over the past few days. We wound up getting the Goodnight Good Cause burger (portions of the proceeds are donated to Lone Star Paralysis, a local charity), which is fantastic--it comes with a bunch of ingredients but somehow manages to not be overwhelming. The patty is angus beef, topped off with Tillamook Cheddar, caramelized onions, jalapeno, BBQ sauce, their special sauce, red leaf lettuce, and a tomato to bring the zest.  The bun was nicely toasted--the kind that doesn't flatten right away when you squeeze the ingredients together. It was lightly seasoned and didn't mess with the flavors of what was in between. The beef patty was juicy, well-cooked, and served as a nice foundation for the stuff on top. It was a little overshadowed by everything else, but I thought it still worked. While the shakes were tempting, we decided to stay lighter and went with a salad and truffle fries (lighter, not light). The salad was probably less healthy than the burger, and the truffle fries were fantastic. I was a big fan of the meal overall, but I just wasn't blown away by the burger. That being said, it was as good as any local burger joint (maybe a little better, honestly) and if I was a local I would go fairly often. The establishment was also clean, they served bottled kombucha (always a good thing), and the decor, while a little Shake Shack-esque, was a lot of clean lines and wood surfaces. At the end of our meal, we had the chance to take a survey on a tablet. I thought it was clever to bring the survey to the customer, as well as use convenient devices to conduct it.

Crazy, control freak, I was JUST WALKING BY.\\nAnyway, despite that odd encounter, I decided to buy the voucher that came through on Boston Deals -- pay $20 to spend $40.

The chicken was fine but nothing special.  My dinner companion had the pulled pork which he enjoyed.  The problem came when I tried to pay.   The voucher clearly stated that it could not be used for alcohol.  This was not an issue since neither of us drink.  But the waitress, and then hostess tried to convince me that the voucher could only be used on food -- so our sodas and the tax were extra.  I tried reasoning with them and pointing out that the voucher clearly stated it excluded only alcohol but they insisted that the executive chef said \\"it was only good for food.\\"   I tried to tell them that despite the chef's clairvoyance, the deal DIDN'T SAY THAT.  We went round and round and I got increasingly irritated (and a bit embarrassed) and in the end just paid up.\\nWhat's funny is that we didn't even spend the whole $40.  So I had to pay an extra $7 for the sodas and tax and got no credit for the leftover voucher balance (which I wouldn't have expected anyway if it weren't for the situation).Long story (not so) short, for a mere $7 they could have created some goodwill with me and I would probably be a repeat customer.  Instead, they insisted that there was an unwritten rule that required me to pay more than required.

Before Navarre my mindset about food was that frozen food was okay in moderation, restaurants were for when I was too lazy to cook, and I had what I thought was a \\"good\\" recipe for roast chicken and what can only be described as 40-minute broccoli.Then, I was taken to a brand new little \\"tapas\\" restaurant that had been receiving some local buzz by a self-professed foodie acquaintance I met in a college math class.  I wasn't their first choice of a dining partner.  I went, ate, and after an hour and a half of pure \\"omg\\" in my mouth I made up my mind about two things: 1) I would only eat real food for the rest of my life, and 2) I would forget the roast chicken and learn this kind of alchemy.  I wish I could say that four months later I was hanging off a boat in the riviera, wrestling with a live octopus that would become the evening's salad only if I won...that didn't happen.  But, what did happen was that I discovered the magic and power of delicious, fulfilling food right here at Navarre, and my life wouldn't be the same without that fateful dinner.So that must have been at least 5 years ago.  Navarre has changed a lot since then.  They've gotten better, and they've gotten worse.  And for what it's worth, there's some parts of That Dinner that I wouldn't be impressed with if I saw it again now.  But Navarre has gone and wedged themselves into a small little corner in my heart that can't just be overturned by an instance of mediocre service or a dish that didn't fly like it should have.  Actually, I've found the service to be consistently good.  A few times I have gone and been the only party there the whole time (ancient history, don't even try this now), and we still only saw the waiter for food delivery and check-ups.  I don't personally enjoy being stared at from across the room as I do anything, let alone eat.  They let me order as many times as I want without being annoyed that I needed a few rounds to feel through the menu.  And they don't give me side eye when I order the same plate three times.The regional thing?  That is so right up my alley you don't even know.  I love theme.  I cook theme dinners at home, even for myself.  I love restaurants with themed menus and Navarre manages to do it all the time without coming across as corny or tacky.  First of all, the theme menus give you a chance to sample foods not often served in restaurants here.  Could a Friulian-specific restaurant stay in business in Portland?  Probably not for long, but you could have an entire sampling of Friulian food at Navarre.  Or whatever region they're cooking for today.  The creativity and vast knowledge of the chefs, putting aside their \\"success rate\\" at the plate, is quite amazing.  Sometimes there's a few culinary duds.  The hard bread problem has been going on for quite a while.  I only get the bread for the olive oil, which has always been amazing.  I've seen staff come and go, some friendly and some not.  Some people can't figure out the menu or what's on it and sometimes this is met with some hostility and scoffing.  I was actually probably scoffed at the first time I came here, but I didn't see it.  It must have been behind my back.  But, as with all my former flames, I like to focus on the positive things when I look back.  I like to remember the times with good conversation, great service, perfect weather, and the amazing food.So to my first love, I still believe in you.  You do need to get a job, but I know you when you're at your best and it can change lives.  To my first restaurant love, Navarre, I still believe in you too.  You should serve bread that doesn't cut the inside of my mouth when I try to eat it, but I know you when you're at your best, and it changes lives too."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Drove all the way in from round rock on a recommendation from one of the bar tenders that I met at the vape shop that I work at and she was RIGHT THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!!

You're in customer service for crying out loud!!! Put a smile on!!!! A simple phone call to request changing our reservation time was slammed with reasons we shouldn't even come by because the kitchen can't handle changes and \\"unless your party can without any chitter chatter, order, quickly eat and get out then...\\". We had a 2 hour time limit apparently. this isn't fine dining sister. It was a courtesy we called and a simple \\"we're full at that time\\" would have sufficed.

I ordered a three-cold-appetizer combo, which had to be already prepared, and the wait was long. The dolmades and the marinated eggplant were good, but the tabouli was awful, tasteless at best, and it suspiciously had some lettuce and cabbage in it. The serving sizes are small for US standards. Every 20 min or so they turn up the volume, play a Turkish song, and a lady appears and does belly dancing. She accepts tips. Instead of being on a stage, she dances all over the place, which, depending on your personality, can be intimidating, annoying, inspiring, or just plain fun.

I do not exaggerate. I could have been full on that and some tikka chicken alone. But then, I wouldn't be able to review the buffet. So at the buffet, I had some meatballs, tikka chicken, curry veggies (carrots/squash/zucchini), and basmati rice. Everything was well-seasoned to my liking. I went back for seconds on the chicken. Washed it all down with some lemonade, which was part of buffet meal, too. There was even dessert, but I couldn't touch it because I was too full.

Trying hard not to turn around because of the scary exteriors, we walked in through the doors. We first walked into what looked like the kitchen. An elderly gentleman then sweetly directed us to the dining room. There weren't a lot of people there. A group of middle aged Ethiopian men sat drinking and talking seriously, which was quite an intimidating sight. Anyway once we entered the dining room, a waitress came by and asked us to sit where we pleased. The decor of the room was very.. Ethiopian? It was quite minimalistic and traditional decor hung around on the walls and ceiling and an unused-looking bar. It wasn't bad, it definitely gave the place a genuine and authentic feel.Never having had Ethiopian food before, our waitress took it upon herself to answer whatever questions we had. She asked us what kind of food we liked and made recommendations on that basis. She even brought out some honey wine for us to taste which I didn't care for but my boyfriend enjoyed. She then served it to him in a traditional Ethiopian cup and told him how to drink it. It was all really fun and interesting.We finally decided to go for the big platter which came with butt loads of injera and enough food to last for a good couple of meals more. The platter had veggies, lentils, lamb, chicken, egg and beef and most everything was yummy. I didn't care much for the veggies and beef but I loved the flavor of the chicken and egg preparation in the center of the plate. It was definitely my favorite and if I get a chance to go back there, that's what I'll have. The injera was light and fluffy with a really mild flavour so it paired well with everything else on the plate.The food is yummy but the place is far for me and honestly the parking area could use a little brightening up.

My husband and I ordered a couple, which included The Gonzo:  blue cheese, chicken, Frank's Hot Sauce; and The Fozzie:  bacon, chicken,  and garlic.  The total: $22.00.  Even in their double size, I still think it was too much in terms of price.  (I also think we both had eyes too big for our stomachs because unless you've just completed a hundred mile bike ride, fasted for two days, or you anticipate a food shortage in the very near future, the regular size would have sufficed.)The Gonzo was tasty except there was too much blue cheese and hot sauce, which overwhelmed the dish, and I could barely taste the mornay sauce which could have been smoother.  The Fozzie wasn't bad, considering the sheer amount of bacon covering it (a good thing), but the large amount of garlic had you tasting garlic the rest of the day.  For both dishes, the chicken could have also been a little less overdone.

It's hard to say that it was as simple as bacon when it's a chunk that was so flavorful.  The other dish we ordered was the pig crispy trotter and wow!You have to like experimentation and want something that you will never make at home to thoroughly enjoy this place.  Nothing on the menu is ordinary - you'll never make a celery foam!!!  And if you can smoke bacon like they can, stop collecting my tax dollars via welfare because it obviously would be a full time job just to attempt it!I personally think it's best for groups of no more than 4, maybe 6 because 6 people can fit at the pub height tables.  It's louder so don't think you can discuss that new rash you found without people staring at you either.

My boyfriend and I went here for lunch today and it went wrong from the very start. When we first walked in, no one was at the hostess stand. We waited for about two minutes until a server came and sat us. He told us we could pick our seat and apologized for the wait stating that \\"that's what we get for hiring a 9 year old for the hostess stand haha\\".... ummm ok? So then he brings water with NO ICE. We looked around and every table around us had ice in their water except us. He bright room temp water with no ice. Ok, no big deal right? So he asks if we want an appetizer and we say the chips and salsa. That shouldn't take long, right? So we wait about ten minutes and still no chips and salsa. So then when he comes and tells us our food will be out soon, to which I inquire about the chips and salsa... to which he says is coming. He totally forgot about it! Then once all of the chips and salsa are gone, he asks us if we want some more chips... but doesn't bring anymore salsa. At this point I am so agitated. I see the table across from us that came in after us that had been sitting for 10 minutes with no drinks or a waiter coming to them. I just shook my head. THEN some random server brings only my food, which was the chicken bowl. It was cold! My boyfriends food is no where to be found. The waiter comes around after 5 minutes later and I told him that my food was cold! He takes it without asking me if I wanted something else or even apologizing. We then continued to wait for my boyfriends food for about 5 minutes until we had enough. My boyfriend got up to find the manager. Then my server had the audacity to come back 2 minutes later with what I know was the same damn bowl! I told him I don't want it! My boyfriend comes back and tells me let's go... the manager said we could leave. He provided him with some tokens for free tacos and offered the lunch on the house. We were so disgusted that we declined. We do thank the manager for seeming remorseful, but changes definitely need to be implemented if they want to keep happy customers.

Had the essence of the restaurant been based purely on surrounding environment and ambience, the review would easily have been 5 stars. However, I was greatly disappointed in the quality of the service and the food, particularly in conjunction with the prices. While I can appreciate the use of small snacks and dishes used as tapas with drinks, all of the food came in ridiculously small proportions! On top of this, the prices were even more ridiculously high. We had the cheese plate, which we had planned to share amongst three of us. The dish came with a small plastic sauce dish with 3 olives, a measly amount of berries, and three types of cheese, each cut in equilateral triangles with sides of about 2 and a half inches. Then there was the lobster roll: a $32 (market price) lobster roll, around 5 inches long.

Their buffet is fine, if you like Indian food you'll find something on there you can live with - its not well groomed (as in wiped down, kept clean always) but the food is alright nothing special medium sized selection. As for their √†lacarte menu it has never satisfied me - this is not because they can't cook, it's mostly because the food is not ultra fresh, which is the true mark of a good restaurant. If you've ever made any kind of fresh meat even basic grilling with a pinch of salt will taste amazing. Clay Pit's lamb/goat curry was blah, it was cooked like most places where the gravy and meat is mixed together before serving (this is not the way a traditional curry is made). Now as to why this can not be a great Indian place - it's the chicken tikka masala of course!! The meat was dry and flavor was nothing close to the real thing the gravy was too thick and obviously separately prepared. Same goes for their daal soup and the biryani  was fast food oily. So again if you are looking for a decent ambiance for Indian -- I do suggest this place.

The bill was a bit higher than similar restaurants in the area, but honestly that one last delectable rice crispy square skillfully dunked in a delightful s'more chocolate fondue was worth every penny of the $120.86 we were charged. \\"Andre\\" is the type of server that every customer wishes they encounter each and every time they go out, and the type of employee I'd go out of my way to retain if I were his manager.All kidding aside, according to my receipt the \\"Andre's\\" real name is Rui.

I want to give four, but I think I might have to save it for the next visit. But rest assured, these three stars are really good!We arrived and discovered it is indeed four tables and the bar seating. We're told an hour and a half wait. I would have loved to order a drink and sit on the front patio, but I find the barren patio has a mere table with three chairs, which happen to be occupied. Not too big of a deal, but watch that $$$ walk next door for drinks at an empty bar....Just sayin'...Pretty much everything was delicious. First off, the grilled squash with bacon and a quite pungent baby goat cheese. The squash was bursting with fresh flavor. The goat cheese and bacon together were heavenly. Definitely a great start. The crab pancake was probably one of my favorites. There's tons of crab meat so it can be shared, although you might want to pull it closer to your side of the table, if you know what I mean. The lamb dish was cooked to perfection. I almost felt guilty eating it, it's picture needs to be in a magazine or something. As far as the rabbit terrine dish, the real shining star here is the liver mouse. I have no idea what exactly goes into making it, but it tasted a bit cheesy. Sacrilege perhaps, but we dipped pretty much everything we could into it. The food was really good, with a small exception: the potato fritters. I don't understand what happened here. This dish was probably what I was looking forward to the most. Potato and goat cheese. I mean come on, what could be more my style. It was, dare I say, a little bland. Maybe my taste buds were so overwhelmed as this was my final course, but a fairly sad end to an amazing meal. It also was a bit too much of one thing. With 5 fritters, and no other component to the dish, I was a little bored. And then felt guilty leaving two on my plate. It just needed a little something more.Overall, the food here is a complete hit. The drinks are a bit expensive, and the wait is certainly not short.

The experience:Attached to union train station(probably cool in the day, but ghetto in modern times) we had to walk by a domestic violence situation in progress(the police were being called and security was on the scene) and when we left we had to walk through groups of homeless looking people who eyed us because we happened to be dressed up that night. In short, at union station, there's likely a higher ratio of people experiencing hard times, nothing against them, but it doesn't help make the experience of getting into and out of the restaurant and the whole experience very enjoyable.The inside of Wilfs looked like a 40 year aged version of the pictures I saw online, faded and aged, the place is certainly a \\"lounge\\". The food(I had the lamb and my wife had the pork): I enjoyed the lamb (but I did notice I only three lamb rib loins, instead of the four indicated on the menu, groupon mitigation?)My wifes pork was slightly undercooked and there was no sauce on top.(she wasn't impressed)The service: It was a slow evening, not many people there, yet the service was very, very slow. The waiter wasn't very attentive. Because we didn't order wine (my current diet restricts alcohol, and my wife is a serious light weight and doesn't enjoy alcohol) I think we were viewed as cheap and treated that way.The music: The artist was not the one advertised on the online music calander, and they were not very good. The value: The food was of quality ingredients, organic and grass fed, a huge plus! The price was on the high side.In conclusion: Due to the poor atmosphere, poor service, higher prices we will not be going back. Wifs may have been hip back in the day when traveling on trains was a higher class affair, and today it may be hip to hipsters, but to me it is a place in decline, trying to maintain the illusion of it's former glory.

I ordered the appetizer platter, the fajitas, stuffed avocado and another entree platter (all to go). To start off with they charge for chips and salsa on to-go orders. This is odd to me because none of their competitors do AND my order was over $50 with a $10 tip. You would think they could throw in some chips. But nonetheless, I picked up the food, without the chips and salsa, and when I got it home I was missing something from each entree. The fajita and appetizer topping/dips, the quesadilla and nachos from the platter and the beans were all no where to be found. Besides all this, we decided to eat it anyway. The condition of the food and the way it was packed was a mess - everything on top of everything thrown in there. I agree with the person that said the fajita meat is premade and not cooked to order. There is no way it's fresh cause it's no where near hot when you get it. The other food was fairly hot, but the quality was low. I would expect better quality for paying 10.99 plus per meal.So finally, I called the store just to let them know what was missing (because I couldn't drive back) and the girl that answered was very dull and her response was \\"ok\\".

Unfortunately, I was wrong.We got to the restaurant at 5:45pm and since reservations are not taken, naturally, the tables were full(understandable given the size, no biggie). This was expected. We were greeted by the hostess, my cell phone number was taken, and I was told that they would call me when a table was available(6:00pm).In the mean time I decided to take my parents to Opa's right down the street for a couple of drinks and chit chat. The place was perfect place to camp out while things at BS opened up. An all woman acoustic band and a few bottles of beer started the night in the right direction. Fast forward 1hr 15min...we decide to give the restaurant a ring since it seems like enough time had passed. The hostess tells us that things should be ready in about 15 min which sounded great because we were starting to get hungry. After closing our tab, we moseyed on over to BS.Apparently while we were gone, a huge crowd assembled in the tiny waiting area of BS. There were at least 15-20 ppl, shoulder to shoulder, wielding glasses of wine, trying to look comfortable and jovial. It was super claustrophobic. Hostess was clearly flustered...and damn it we were hungry. After talking with the hostess, I was assured that a table would be opening up momentarily, but by the looks of it, everyone that was eating looked content to just hang out, sip on more wine, and enjoy themselves (you can't blame them! I'd do the same). So we wait. I talked to my parents about it and I can tell that they are visibly bothered by length of time. I too, am getting a bit annoyed. We're at 2 hours(8 PM). We look over the menu for the 5th time discussing what we would order if we'd ever get seated. [Stomach Churns] In the meanwhile, we see at least 3-4 couples leave. Each time, we HOPE and KNOW that it's out turn. Each time, the vacant spots are filled with a young, hip & trendy couple who I know for a fact didn't have to wait 2hrs. I don't like to insinuate negative things about people I don't know, but I almost felt like the hostess was a bit of an ageist. I'm a twenty-something but my parents are about 60 years young. All this time we are assured that the group of 8 that we're waiting on to leave is ALMOST DONE...ALMOST CLOSING THEIR BILL. My question is \\"Why are we waiting on a group of 8 when we're only 3?\\" Rehashing the events of this night tick me off and is making me hungry again...2 hr 40 min. I see another couple being seated at the communal bar-like seating and wonder why that couldn't be our seat. I'm pissed. There are even chairs in between patrons. I've had it by now. That's almost an entire UT Football game!!! So after inquiring again to the hostess about our status she says \\"I'm so sorry, the table(of 8) that I thought was almost done just ordered another bottle of wine.\\" Eff That. I get cranky when I don't eat. If you can't seat us, just BE REAL, don't have my family wait around for nearly 3 hours. I'd only do that for Franklin Brisket :)Without the help of BS, I wouldn't have been able to enjoy my Birthday dinner at RED LOBSTER.

I opted for the thick noodles which tasted hand-made (as I think they were). The meat chunks were tender and flavorful.I also got the Pork and Cabbage Dumpling Soup which came in a piping hot bowl of broth that never seemed to cool down. I would recommend using the side of soy sauce/vinegar and chili with the dumplings. Such complementary flavors! The last thing I got was the Pork Sung and Cucumber Roll which was just okay. Pork sung generally has that dry, carpet-like texture so this really does need the tableside chili I mentioned earlier. The roll was made of a flakey pastry that wasn't oily though and quite soft.

Sure, I'll pay a bit more than I normally would, if it's for that!Granted, everything is made by Parish Cafe chefs, not the sandwich creators themselves, but just seeing 'wiches from the likes of Ken Oringer, Joanne Chang, Tim Cushman, etc, all over the menu is enough to send this food-crazed gal into a frenzy of excitement.I tried the Zuni Roll on my first of what will be many visits. Twelve bucks seemed reasonable enough to me, considering some sandwiches on the menu cost as much as $20! But what you get is one hefty sandwich, so it's worth every penny. Try picturing smoked turkey breast, bacon, chopped scallions, dill Havarti cheese, and cranberry chipotle sauce, all wrapped in a flour tortilla. Then, picture even more cranberry chipotle sauce with sour cream and scallions served on the side for your sandwich-dipping pleasure (that combination does sound a bit odd, but it actually tastes fantastic). If you're thinking that sounds like too much good stuff to be able to visualize it all in one sandwich, you'd be right. But no worries, I'm a good Yelper and I provided a photo for your viewing enjoyment.You are also served your choice of house-made potato salad or coleslaw. I chose the potato salad, and it far outstripped what you'd typically expect, and certainly was much better than what you can get at the grocery store deli. Also, they have a really great selection of beer, wine, and cocktails, quite impressive for what is primarily a sandwich place.One last tip - they won't seat you until your entire party has arrived, and they don't take reservations. And Parish seems to be quite the popular eating destination even at off-peak hours on a weekday, so keep that in mind when (not if) you plan to stop by!"},{"name":"Xian Sushi and Noodle","address":"1801 E 51st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Been here twice now and have been impressed again and again!

They don't even have this in Houston...actually they have ONE hand pulled noodle place but it really pales in comparison to Xian Noodle.As for the food...I typically get my noodles \\"spaghetti\\" thickness and am always pleased with them..large portion sizes, tender and cooked to perfect doneness.\\n- Liang Pi cold noodle appetizer: I always order this. At $7 it's also a bit steep, but it's one of the best versions of this dish I've had. It comes packed with shredded tender chicken, tons of flavor, and cool slippery noodles. Always a table favorite!\\n- Beef noodle soup: Done very well here. Broth was very flavorful and rich and comes with lots of bok choy and huge slices of beef! \\n- Dan Dan noodles: a cooler and spicier dish than the beef noodle soup but with tons of beef as well. Also comes with lots of pickled mustard greens- love the contrast. Not really that spicy at all so I add a healthy amount of chili oil.\\n- Happened to be there during happy hour which lasts until 6:30p on weekdays and ordered a spicy tuna roll for $4- was pleasantly surprised! 8 large pieces of sushi packed with well flavored spicy tuna.

It's not even a close competition!I tried the Blueberry Bourbon Basil and the Blackberry Compote with Peanut Powder, and both were good.  The donut dough is a good combination of chewy yet light.  And even though the flavors are unique and some are a little out-there, they actually work for me.Blueberry Bourbon Basil: At first bite, it will taste strange.  The basil resonates quite loudly, and basil and donuts are not your common combination.  But after the second and third bites, I became a believer!  It's not overly sweet, and it has a level of complexity that very few donuts can pull off.  Not everyone will feel this way about it, but I was a fan.Blackberry Compote with Peanut Powder: It tasted just like a peanut butter jelly sandwich, which is one of my favorite sandwiches.  When you put that in donut form, you will receive from me a hearty, \\"Yes, please!\\"  The compote is actually a filling in the donut, which works again because the compote is not overly sweet.  So good, so good!When we came, there was absolutely no line, and therefore, no wait.  The layout is great - very spacious-feeling and clean.Voodoo is all flash and hype, no substance.

The people at the counter were surprisingly nice and knowledgeable about coffee. Being the coffee snob I am, I like to find out the usual characteristics of coffee before I drink it. (Dark, medium or light roast, local, organic, bold, acidic, etc.) I looked for a seat, and because it was pretty crowded, I ended up sharing a table with a woman who was studying. We got to chatting, and she was really nice. It ended up she was studying linguistics, and since that is a topic I'm interested in, we chatted for a bit. She moved to Austin within the last year and half for grad school, and she said she liked Cherrywood for studying. By the time I was halfway done with my coffee, and chatting with her, I had to leave. The music playing in the place was pretty mellow and to my taste, and the coffee was easily one of the best cups I've had in Austin. I went back up to the counter and a guy behind the counter gave me a to go cup within a few seconds of me asking him. He even gave me a smile.

I must say, despite the HORRIFIC traffic on Howell Mill (which I avoid more than a screaming baby, a drunk girl or an episode of Pushing Daisies), it was well worth it.First, the place is light, bright and inviting. We sat at the main bar on comfy stools (although, would a back be too much to ask?!?!) with fun framed hi-def TVs to watch.  It's mod, colorful and hip - just as you'd expect. I love the three big cushy booths and hope to gather with a group of close friend in one soon.The female bartender/server was fairly attentive, but the male seemed like he couldn't have cared less we were there. He was far too busy counting his money, sucking in his cheeks and thinking \\"Don't I have the most beautiful blue eyes you've ever seen?\\" Well, he did, but that's beside the point.We were the first ones there at 11:30 and ordered almost immediately. It took close to 17 minutes for our burgers to come out which, I'll grant you, isn't a long time, but still - it's lunch and we were the first orders in. I'll over look that.I decided to start with the benchmark - a regular Flip burger. I asked for it rare, but they said all the burgers come out the same temperature - medium. I was thrilled to discover their idea of medium is RARE,  but if you're not in to that, you better speak up. It was juicy, seasoned perfectly and the bun actually added to the overall taste. It came with what all burgers should: tomato, lettuce, pickles, onion and a little squirt of ketchup - perfect.  I look forward to trying the more adventurous versions now. I also ordered a side of vodka-battered onion rings (???) which were wonderfully flavorful if not a tad bit dense. They're not light and fluffy, but they sure do deliver on taste. It doesn't hurt they were served with what was possibly THE most delicious honey-mustard sauce I've ever had. And I'm glad there were only 5 of them in the order - trust me, it's more than enough.It was also very affordable - my burger was $6.50 and the rings were $4. I got out of there for under $15 bucks with tip - something I'm sure Atlantas will appreciate now-a-days. On a side note, remember when they said Atlanta was recession-proof?

Bad news: I don't find this place to be as memorable as their \\"big brother\\" Chambar (they're run by the same people). My husband got the fricassee, which I was tempted by, but was glad I didn't get. I tried a few bites, and while the bacon inside was AMAZING, the sauce was way too sherry vinegary. I wouldn't have been able to eat the whole plate of it. The housemade ciabatta bread had way, WAY too many herbs in it, and not the right kind. It tasted like your basic \\"Italian seasoning\\" blend had been accidentally spilled into a batch of the bread. I usually LOVE bread, and kept taking tiny bites in hopes that I'd like it, but despite its warmth and freshness, I just wasn't a fan of the flavor. \\n \\nGood news: Belgian waffles are legit - really good, with crunchy bits of pearl sugar within. We got the mixed berry compote and dark chocolate sauces to go with. We shared a small waffle in addition to our own entrees and coffees, but really. These things are so good you'll want to hog one for yourself. Also good is their lavender latte. The green tea latte was alright, but near the end you're left with a cup of green milk after you've had all the foam, which is weird and not as good. I think the lavender latte wins.I think the perfect Caf√© Medina experience would really just be to get a coffee and a waffle (EACH!) and enjoy. The scrambles/frittatas/fricassees I've tried here just haven't been memorable. Hot and eggy, cheesy, meaty, yes. Good enough for me to come back and try them again? Nope.

They all have the same brioche base.\\nOne that had a lemon lime type curd, it was by far my favorite.  It wasn't overly eggy as some curds can be, and it had a good balance of sharpness.  It also was a perfect consistency where it distributed evenly throughout the doughnut and didn't clump in the middle.The creme burle with the contreu pipette was my second favorite. The top was perfectly bruleed, no weepyness or burnt taste, and the pastry cream they describe as a pudding ( but totally isn't) was good but was all clumped in one section, and the doughnut itself needed to be softer for such a firm pastry cream and then crispy top.  The contreu was a fun addition.Next I got the chocolate topped doughnut with crunchy chocolate sprinkles, and filled with the same filling as the creme brulee. They also called this a pudding, I wish it had been, it just didn't distribute well. Also for my chocolate top, I prefer a firmer more set glaze, and I also found theirs a bit to bitter for my taste.  Ok so the last I had I did not like at all.  It was the pb&j .  Basically a fruit filling that had no fruity chunks I was hoping for with a hint of spicyness from a pepper, and then coated in a peanut butter powder sugar mixture.  I feel if they had embraced the fresh fruit and not over processed it and left out the pepper, it would have been more successful. Overall I would have given this place a three if it were not fore the amazingness of that lemon/ lime curd doughnut.  They have great ideas, but the execution of compatible textures, distribution of filling, and need to edit I think should be reviewed. I appreciate that they are not overly sweet, and the innovation they bring to the table. They also packaged each doughnut with care, as they should. since they aren't cheap."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Yum yum yum!

Proteins were interesting: lamb heart, beef tongue, head cheese, guinea breast, pork belly. All with a host of minor players to compliment the center. The combinations generally worked well though with little surprise. One note of irritation is that preparations are not included on the menu, only ingredients. So to our surprise the heart, tongue, and pork belly were all prepared on the same wood fired grill and were mostly indistinguishable from each other because of the overwhelming smoke. The service was knowledgable and efficient. The wine menu was limited and expensive.

No need to elaborate but let me just say you may be seated next to ANYBODY.We got out for around $160 for 2 with four drinks.

My dad was surprised by how his dish came out, but he failed to ask what it was (his fault), so if you are unsure what you think the dish is - ask the waiter!This is not a five star rating just because of service. We had to ask for more water and we didn't have enough silverware settings or napkins. Those should be a given in a restaurant. It took us a few minutes to catch the eye of someone working there. The waiter that brought out our dishes (not the one who took our order) was also VERY awkward and it was hard to tell what he was saying. Perhaps they should think about having someone else do that job. The restaurant itself had GREAT ambiance and I felt like I was dining in a Venezuelan home.

Trattoria di Monica was the perfect choice. I rarely give five stars, but the both food and ambiance were impeccable. The restaurant is incredibly tiny, but not oppressively so. It simply adds to the intimate atmosphere. The bread basket was not a mere formality; the bread was deliciously feathery with a crisp crust. Perfect for dipping in the wine jus of my mussel antipasto! The mussels were slightly sandy, but the flavor was wonderful, although I generally avoid whole bivalves. My boyfriend's antipasto was arguably the best dish of the night: meltingly tender calamari rings, which which we agreed were the best we had had. Our insalata course was mixed; his green salad was wonderful and fresh, but my american-style caesar salad was a bit bland, and overly fishy. For our main pasta dishes, I ordered the pumpkin ravioli with brown butter and sage sauce. The dish was not complex, but the few simple flavor notes it hit were excellent...the texture of the pasta was superb. My boyfriend ordered a simple plate of spaghetti and meatballs, which he was not overly impressed with. The meatballs were good, but not amazing. On the whole however, we agreed that it was a lovely restaurant with satisfying, delicious food. It was a bit of a splurge for us college students; dinner for two without wine was $100!"},{"name":"Halal Bros","address":"1910 W Braker Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The Kofta kabob was very tasty, grilled ground beef that's been skewered and grilled, came with a large quantity of rice and salad, my wife enjoyed her falafel plate with the same sides, I helped her enjoy it since i'm qualified for that.

For what it is worth, my unsolicited advice to the owners is to focus more on taste and less on presentation. The concept of the restaurant is exciting.  But the food is not.One more thing.

I've actually come here at least ten times over this past year and I have not taken one sip and said to myself it was good.

Started off shaky since we initially wanted a table for 4...and were told it would be a nearly 3 hour wait. At 7pm...and this place closes at 11? Well, fortunately for us our friends wouldn't be able to join us for a while so we told them to fuggedaboudit and changed it to 2 and the wait went down to a moderate 45-60 minutes. Hung out in the bar next door and it was so worth the wait! \\nThe dishes are so creative and delicious. They put things together that I wouldn't imagine go together, yet they do. There's also a touch of molecular gastronomy going on since there were a few flavors done up in a foamy thing. Weird but man, did it work. \\nThey recommend 4-6 dishes per 2 people and my husband and I ended up with 7 dishes, with one being dessert. There was green chile mousse, pig face, goat tongue, lamb, scrambled egg, wagyu steak, and a fried croissant. No, not all on the same plate, but I'm sure Barley Swine could make that work too. I surprised myself by loving the goat tongue the best of all. Not what I thought goat tongue would taste like (like we all sit there and imagine that)...it was just....well...meat. And pretty damn good meat at that.  \\nAnd the service....phenomenal. Attentive, yet not in any way intrusive. Friendly but not *too*. I wasn't sure which wine I wanted so they brought me little tastes until we found one: A really nice Pinot Grigio that went very well with everything that floated across my tongue and into mah belly. \\nDon't expect a quick dinner. We were there for 2 hours. Two very well-paced hours. It's a small place and you share a table with others, so it's also loud, if you don't care for that kind of thing. \\nThe prices are reasonable, in my opinion. We ended up spending about $45/person on food alone. I've had much more expensive meals out that didn't feel near as special as this.

It's a mixed bag, but overall I like it and suggest you try it.The food is pretty solid. The hummus and baba ganoush are both really good, and if you order a side of the baba they appropriately top it with tahini and olive oil. The falafel was pretty good. Chicken shawarma is also pretty good. The pita is good too, but does fall apart a bit if you get wet ingredients. I think the best topping was actually the Israeli salad - the tomatoes were very fresh and flavorful and there was just the right balance of lemon and oil. While the food overall is solid, it doesn't measure up to Pita Palace at Briarcliff and La Vista, as far as Israeli style middle eastern food goes. I'd still say it's the second best falafel I've had in Atlanta, although there's not much competition.The service is just not organized yet. There were only three people in front of us in line, and it still took about 15 minutes before we had our food and paid. It's really the same serving-line concept as a chipotle or subway, so they should be able to figure it out and get things moving along. The employees were definitely nice, just slow and/or didn't have a good system to work with.Then there's the price. It's definitely overpriced, since you have to pay for ingredients separately. 50 cents to add tahini? That should be automatic.If this place can get the ordering/serving process figured out, and include one or two sauces/toppings in the price of a pita or laffa, I'd easily bump it up to 4 stars.

I think the flavors are amazing!The quality seems top notch for a Chinese buffet, and because of the high traffic at this restaurant, the food is constantly fresh. I have yet to experience hardened fried rice or old soggy lo mein. I think that because of the Korean owners, there is a larger selection of Korean dishes. There is bulgogi (marinated sirloin strips), galbi (beef ribs), vegetable pancakes, and spicy chicken and vegetable soup (which is wayy too salty). I also really really like the marinated eggplant and the octopus salad. They have this sweet marinade which is actually very similar in flavor. The only thing that they are really lacking is the sushi. They only have rolls that are deep fried and smothered in spicy mayo.

Had the Blackened Catfish Sandwich, which was a thick, well-seasoned pan-fried filet draped over a buttered, griddled, soft and chewy, brioche bun with a smattering of lettuce and tomato.  Remoulade sauce was the right creaminess and tartness to go with.  It was very juicy, not overcooked at all, nicely done.  The Chicken Sandwich, however, was the showstopper, a ginormous, flaky, breaded chicken breast filet the size of your head.  Had a taste of the Crab Cake Sliders, which was OK for Florida, but can't hold a candle to Maryland-style, but was prettily plated and dressed up with some fresh avocado.

Folks plugged in to their laptops and conducting meetings. I was one of them, so no complaints. It's nice to find a spot that caters to mobile workers. I had a large drip coffee that they splashed with almond milk for me. It really was a large, large cup. I felt like that scene from So I Married An Axe Murderer, drinking my coffee out of essentially a bowl that required two hands to sip. I will never complain about someone loading me down with coffee, so I wholeheartedly approve of it. The coffee itself was pretty decent. But ok, let's talk breakfast tacos. Let me preface this review by saying I have a chip on my shoulder about breakfast tacos, being from San Antonio, which so clearly ranks as the top contender of all breakfast taco battles. I ordered a migas taco. The veggies were fresh and flavorful, and the egg was well cooked. The cheese was a finely shredded cheddar, which I like because it melts quickly. I had the choice of corn, whole wheat, or flour tortilla. Of course I went flour because I try not to mess with perfection, but these particular flour tortillas are pretty thin. A think and soft flour tortilla made with lard is probably my one way ticket to Heart Attack City, but it's good, and it's what I like. It's also functional. It holds your taco contents in, snuggled in its thick perfection. So this thin tortilla wasn't able to hold the mightiness of its fillings. It split and stuff fell out as I was trying to eat it. It was still tasty, and I still ate it down and enjoyed it, but like I said as a Latina from SA, I have really high standards from breakfast tacos and Austin (not just Cherrywood) finds it hard to measure up to them. That being said, I was super happy with my meal. The taco was filling, as it should be for almost $4 a taco. I have been trying to tell anyone who listens to me that if San Antonio came up with a place that served amazing fresh breakfast tacos and great fresh coffee, that person would be a millionaire, because too often the decision is between good coffee and good tacos. So Cherrywood, I give you mas kudos on marrying the genius of these two beautiful individual ideas."},{"name":"Cherrywood Coffeehouse","address":"1400 E 38th 1/2 St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Wow!

Supposedly the platter is for two people, but that is obviously a joke, because the hell am I ever going to share it with anyone. And no, I never take home any leftovers. My meat-eating parents love the beef tips, and the dessert is good, although not nearly as amazing as the rest of the food.

The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is cuz the manager seemed like he generally cared the cashier seems like she genuinely cared and the food was not bad, but the service or let me rephrase this lack of service was very upsetting and disappointing. I showed up last night with my partner 1 hour before they closed we sat at a booth , there was obviously servers walking around a young black lady who had multiple tables and was on top of her game checking on our table and an older Hispanic lady (our server) who seemed to not have any tables except for one who she stood by and had a 15 minute conversation with, she did not offer to refill our drinks did not come introduce herself she saw we were there and did not even it acknowledge us, now I put the blame for the bad service on her, but that other server who was on top of her game working her tables did see me and my partner multiple times did see that the other server had not checked on us and could have checked on us or notified her manager and at least offered to refill our drinks.. After all this I was very disappointed with the service and I went and I left a cashier know of the problem she apologised for it and shortly after I sat myself back down she went and told the server or at least mention something to the server. The reason I think this  because they had a conversation I saw the server look at me and the server I'm talking about is the older Hispanic lady and just  wave her hand and brush it off like she didn't care.. I would hope someone at lubys cafeteria reads this and not just wrote that lady up they should just fire her cuz she is a horrible server.

If you're a foodie looking for a consistent favorite, Barley Swine does not live up to expectations. We enjoyed Barley Swine for the first two visits. The novelty helped us absorb the high price tag, uncomfortable communal tables, long waits, and tiny quarters. After all, the restaurant has a beautiful concept involving creative small dishes prepared with love from local and unusual ingredients. It's clear the restaurant team has a passion for food, which translates into the stunning presentations on the plates. And frankly, Austin just doesn't have that many really nice restaurants, so the fact that Barley Swine even makes an attempt at fine dining in this city is commendable. Unfortunately, by the third visit, the novelty had worn off and we could no longer ignore the facts that had been clear from the beginning. Most importantly, the majority of dishes on the menu just didn't taste as good as they looked. Perhaps two out of five of our choices (as we tend to order five $17-$25 plates between the two of us), were particularly good, while the rest left something to be desired. What compounds this issue is the fact that the everything on the plate feels like creative leftovers. Due to the tiny space and short order time, the food is clearly prepared before restaurant service even begins. This means that during open hours, the chefs are really just super talented assemblers of plates who reheat pieces of meat and make sure the foam is applied just so. The reheated meat is often underwhelming, mostly because it lacks that \\"just cooked\\" flavor, but also because the seasoning isn't particularly special. Vegetables tend to hold up better to the precooked approach, which is why we tend to prefer the vegetarian dishes (even though we are definitely meat eaters). Still, because of the limited choices in Austin for high caliber cuisine, we have continued to give Barley Swine more chances, hoping that we might hit an \\"on\\" night where all of the plates were all fantastic. After all, they LOOK fantastic, why wouldn't they taste that way? Last night was our final visit. It was a last minute date night, and Barley Swine had no wait for a change, so we thought we'd give it a try. The presentation was beautiful, and the wine was decent, and that's where it the positive list ends. We made the mistake of sitting at the bar (hoping for a good show in the kitchen), where we witnessed a chef tasting the lentils he had just reheated, dipping his spoon in a bowl of water, reusing the same spoon to plate the lentils, eating the remaining lentils from the pan, and then rinsing the spoon in the SAME bowl of water, before repeating the process with a new plate and the SAME spoon. We had a hard time figuring out what was in that bowl of water that could possibly make that sanitary while not affecting the food. We really didn't like a single plate all evening, although we felt obligated to continue eating what we had ordered. The coup de grace was the arrival of our fois gras (as presented on the menu), which really was a dish of cold, poorly seasoned duck with a fois gras mousse. It was a huge disappointment all around. $140 (with tax and tip) later, we were through with one of the least exciting date night meals we had ever had. And that's the story of a our unhappy relationship with Barley Swine. We wanted to love it, we continued to give it chances, but in the end, we resolved it's inconsistent, overrated and overpriced."},{"name":"The Crepevine","address":"249 W State Rd 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"I had to take a star away due to the bacon.

I arrived at about 7:15, the line was almost out the door...ok they are good but not that good, folks. The parking lot at the Ponce location sucks. Really bad. There's only one way in, yet people still insist on driving in the wrong way in from Ponce PLACE (instead of Avenue), and driving out through the Ponce Avenue entrance, even though it clearly says not to do so via a big red \\"wrong way\\" sign. Shaking my head. There are only about 15 or so parking spots, which clearly don't accommodate the crowds that show up there between 5-8 pm. The food is alright. I mean, it's good, but not good enough to have a line outside the door, especially when there's a Moe's RIGHT DOWN the street w/ similar food, a bigger location and its way more parking friendly. Chipotle charges for chips and salsa, which irritates the heck outta me, especially when I can go to almost ANY other Mexican food place in Atlanta and get free (and sometimes unlimited) chips and salsa. There's no salsa bar either, another (-) in my book. I ordered a chicken burrito which was so huge, I would've loved to drown it all in as much salsa as I wanted to. It was lacking a little flavor, but I ate it anyways. Without enough salsa however, it just felt like it was missing something. All in all, Chipotle is okay. But I'll stick to Moe's and Willy's.

The only recommendation I would make to the chef is to go easier on the chili oil - many dishes were swimming in it.  Other than that, the flavors popped and were truly exceptional.  My favorite was the corn-coconut soup, which might be the best soup I ever ate, whereas my wife's favorite was the Szechuan shrimp and okara grits. We also really enjoyed the wok-charred octopus and grilled corn in sriracha butter YUM!.

Let me explain. Some of us decided that we were going to head here for lunch, I think it was 6 of us to start, and as we were walking out of the building, we ended up picking up 6 more. Now for lunchtime 12 can be a big party at places, and we should have called in for a reservation, but we were already walking out the door so we didn't. Once we arrived and walked in, we told the hostess that we had a party of 12 and she asked if we made a reservation. We said no. They had a reservation and table set up for 20+. They were able to seat us at 2 tables of 6, so that worked, but then the 20 top showed up and things slowed down. Other than us messing up their lunch time by being a second large party I am sure things would have been much smoother. On to the food. The bread was very good, I want to go on and on about it, but really it was like a full appetizer with cheese and herbs and spices and what not. It honestly was a bit too heavy to start with, I watched one of my table mates eat an entire basket and a half of it though. I ordered the \\"Linguine al Ragu - Linguini with ground Italian sweet sausage in a light tomato sauce - $9\\" and it really lacked all flavor, the sausage in it was little flecks in the sauce and you couldn't tell there was any meat at all.

My husband loved his Breakfast Burger and we both loved the onion rings and the Krispy Kreme and Nutella shakes but my Turf n' Earth was marginal at best and the Sweet Potato Tots need to go.  Caesar Salad was pretty good too but we both found the french fries too greasy.  At the end of the day my humble opinion is this...despite having a decent amount of burgers to choose from...they need to add some healthier sides.

The pros: instagram-able if that's what you're going for, good drinks ($5 and up), they're open late (2am), and it's meant to be a social environment.The cons: the food here is way over priced and not very good in my opinion. The actual food items are $12-$15. The first time I tried their chicken and waffles, it was an okay portion but the waffle itself was stale which left me unsatisfied. Second time I order the popcorn chicken which is a snack and come at you for $9. It tastes like fried dough to put it bluntly and the mushy kind in the center. My review is based off the above, just not a good value for me personally. My second time here was a worst experience than my first, they established a no laptop policy since the last time I was here. To be fair I didn't see the no laptop sign, but it also doesn't really stand out since the place itself has a lot going on in terms of decoration. Came during the work week and there's literally 3 people inside but I was expected to leave and take my chicken to go, back into traffic. The manager made a one time exception for me to be on my laptop outside (note that this is after work and it's getting dark out). Just thought it was a little ridiculous. I understand that they can't really make exceptions if it's busy inside but it wasn't. I won't be coming back.

Also, there is a chicken sandwich that is amazing with some sort of slaw on top it has a interesting taste very flavorful.  Pizza seems to be the popular menu item  there are several options. During my last visit my friend ordered a pepperoni pizza, I took a small bite of a piece with just cheese and it was disgusting.Friday night included a live band which was very entertaining. Other than bowling, there is a area to play darts,  ping pong,  basketball or you can sit at the bar and lounge while enjoying the scenery. \\nMy favorite aspect of this bowling alley is the bathroom which the woman's and men's are combined at the sink with a open wall conjoined. I will be the  first one to admit strange things make me happy and their contemporary bathroom makes me giggle everytime I see the reaction of a first timer seeing the opposite sex in what they thought was a mirrior.

The Belgian waffles are one of the most popular choices on the menu.  They come to the table soft, warm, and sugared just right.  You have a choice of a number of sides that you can get with them.

The beef was a little saltier than I would have preferred, but it was still good regardless. The saltiness suppressed the potential of the spice, or maybe I just eat too much spicy food on a daily basis hahaGrilled Asparagus - perfect addition of greens to a rather meat-ful meal! I loved the idea of the sunnyside egg on top of the grilled asparagus. My only complaint is that the baby asparagus they used were too thin for comfortable fork use...Seafood paella for 2 - the portion was gigantic! It did take longer than we expected, and therefore there was a rather long period of waiting after finished the smaller plates, however the visual and the taste was enough to forgive. once again, I believe it was a little saltier than I would have liked, but regardless, it was heavenly. The seafood was abundant, the rice was perfectly soft and plump, and the portion was plenty.Wine - the extensive wine list here is so impressive. I thought I knew my wines, but after looking at their vino book, I realized I still have so much to learn.Service: I was VERY VERY impressed by the service here. We were greeted with a smile from everyone, from the front staff, waiters, to the owner that came and asked how the food was at the end of the meal.

It looks more like a lounge then a comfort food place.  All dazzle and of course since it  is  Richard Blais' baby project, this place would succeed due to this alone.  But in all seriousness, the burger lacks in heart but definitely has vision in terms of gourmet burgers.  It is so gourmet to the point that the burger looks very small and alone, without side items.  You have to order the sides separately and all this would eventually add up to a 20 + buck meal, for a small burger and a small side.  \\nI stand at a good 4'10, and the burger was a snack to me.  I don't know how you can eat it and feel happy about the experience based on the size of the burger alone, I mean let's not lie, size matters!\\nBeyond the size of the little thing, it wasn't at all that tasty and heavenly as I had imagined.  The meat was a bit on the dry side, and the flavor was lacking fat and seasonings for sure.  I ordered sweetbread and it tasted a bit like chicken nuggets, which I thought was bizarre, since sweetbread should have a mushy and creamy consistency, but it was still good none the less, but the dipping sauce was way too overpowering , it was sweet and tangy, and tasted more like McDonald's then Flip Gourmet!\\nI have to admit though, their margaritas were very good, especially for an afternoon delight!  But would I come back? eh... most likely only to entertain out of towners.  Oh I did see Blais himself standing at the counter. I was tempted to take a picture with him, but then hesitated.

Only in Austin....The place itself has literally not changed in the last 10 years and that is in no way insinuating that it is outdated. It's still got the classic dark woods, warm lighting, stone floors and walls and the friendly service. I've been treated the same way (very well) as a freshman in college and now a tourist to the city with a much better wardrobe/cash flow. The chutneys that accompany the obligatory Pappadums are exquisite. Especially the green cilantro chutney. It's not out of the can/bottle but it's freshly ground.

We have been a couple times and have had an enjoyable experience for the most part. This last time however the service was very slow and they weren't even that busy. We finished eating and ordered our desserts but they took 40 minutes to bring them out. Our table only ordered 3 desserts! The waitress never gave us an apology for the wait or.

Navarre unfortunately had a different plan in mind for us. First of all, if you prefer your restaurant to be empty at 9pm, please don't accept any reservations at 8pm anymore. I understand we aren't in Europe and that most people dine a lot earlier here, but once the clock hit 9:30pm the entire staff was busy cleaning up and getting everybody out of the restaurant. Plain rude in my opinion. Our waitress, an older lady, did not care about us at all. And this was pretty much from the beginning on. For example: she spilled wine all over the table while filling up our glasses, didn't bother to clean it up and was not interested in taking our orders. Every single time we wanted to order something, we had to raise our hand to get her attention. Not only her, but also the rest of the staff seemed robots. Just very unprofessional and unwelcoming. I have no idea what was going on. It felt we were trapped in a bad social experiment. She tried to be a little nice when we asked for the bill -  but for me that's just so fake. The bill - way overpriced, already included 20% gratuity. I am more than happy to pay at least a 20% tip, but this was entirely undeserved. Some dishes were tasty (liver, magret de canard, charcuterie), but nothing really stood out and the portions were all really small (didn't matter if you ordered the large or small version) and overpriced.

This was recommended by a friend and I have no regrets.  I tried the Parmesan truffle fries.  Unless you are a BIG eater, this will provide for 3 people easily.  As it was my first time, I tried the cheeseburger.  Plain and simple. It was one of the best burgers I have had in Austin.  The burger was juicy and the bread choice was well thought out and fantastic.  I passed on their milkshake because it was too warm to drink milk.  However, it is on my list of things to try again.  Now, here is my only complaint.  This was my first time there.  I walked in and had no idea what to do.  I was greeted by someone who seemed friendly and willing to help me out.  Then she just sent me to someone else who gave me a ticket and sent me to the back of the restaurant.  If you have never been there, you do not know to go to the back of the eatery.  My husband and I ordered our food and then went to our table.  Our food was delivered to us.A string of servers stopped in to see if we were ok.  It was annoying.  I understand they were trying to make sure we were ok, but because three people were constantly stopping by it was too much.  They actually brought us nothing and did not refill anything for us but we saw other people leaving tips.  We did.  However, I just do not like that kind of service.  They drop our food off and just stop in for no reason.  I would get if we were having cocktails or milkshakes, but we were having nothing.  And it was really overbearing.

I recently visited with the intent on staying because I had no where to eat before my next destination. The guy up front asked if I was going to eat there and after saying yes I sat down. The food was brought to me to go and I felt at that point I was being pushed out the door since it was 8:30 and there was some type of meeting going on up front with employees (they close at 10). I reluctantly left with no salsa, as I did not see the salsa bar that once stood to the left of the register. I assumed (my bad) that there might be salsa in my bag since I didn't see their salsa bar. When i got to my next stop i went to eat my dinner in my car and found no utensils, ONE napkin, no salsa and my limes marinated in my beans.

Since then there have been bi-weekly (and ok, sometimes weekly) cravings satisfied by going to Santarpio's and ordering between the two of us a huge and cheap carafe of their house red, some cherry peppers, and two pizzas. Two, because you WANT a whole pizza to take home and eat for breakfast immediately the next day.

I used to go regularly to our local Ethiopian restaurant (Ras Kassa in Boulder) while it was open, and I've often had Ethiopian cooking at pan-African events and the like (I'm of Nigerian-American), but it was a first for my two colleagues. I had Lamb Tibs with injera, miser and gomen, on shiro. It was one of the most delicious meals of any sort I've ever had. Everything tasted fresh, with a fine balancing of spices.The atmosphere was also wonderful, casual and clean. Our waitress had the sweetest smile, as if she were feeding her own children, and everyone else working there was as pleasant. Other customers eating there seemed to be enjoying themselves as well.Somehow during the course of the meal, my wallet slipped out of my pocket. My colleague paid for the meal, so I didn't notice until we'd driven a few miles away. I called Desta's as well as my hotel and our meeting place, but Desta's had not yet found the wallet. Eventually I gave up and we headed for ATL airport. At some point they found the wallet, and The Desta hostess promptly called my insurance agent from my coverage card, and my agent got a hold of me. It was too late for me to go back and get the wallet so I asked whether the hostess would be kind enough to mail it to me. She said yes and I thanked her profusely. That was Wednesday afternoon. My wallet arrived in Colorado in Friday's mail.You might think my opinion of the food and atmosphere are influenced, by what happened afterward, but I assure you that's not the case.

The softness of the noodle was just right. The chashu was savoury, but neither too salty nor dry. I always wondered what made Ramen Danbo oh so famous, and now I totally understand! :) The reason I deducted one star was that they seemed to forget my gyoza. Since it didn't come out until I almost finished the ramen, I had to ask one of the staff if the gyoza was on the way.

The last time I was there, a hipster party of about 6 sat there for a long time after they were done eating, and then they just left all of their trash on the tables and sauntered off, so the wait was even longer as someone had to clear away all of their trash from the tables.

I dined here back in November 2009 and I can say, it was okay, but I simply don't get all the hype!\\nThe vegetable pakoras are freaking yum, but as my mantra goes - nearly anything fried is delicious.  They came out slightly crispy, warm, we ate them all.\\nAs for the dinner portion of the evening - my companion and I opted to descend into the cellar as I had read that it was the most novelty-esque area to dine in.  And it really was quite adorable - lit by candles dotted along the jagged cave-like walls, the tables were spaced adequately apart to allow for intimate dining - just really perfect.\\nOur waitress, bless her soul, was nice enough, but EXTREMELY slow and forgetful.  More on that later . . . \\nWe ordered some wine - which was lovely.  And I believe we had the Vegetable Ayam and Kadhu Curry along with some Roti - all vegan as designated by the menu.  Now the portions were modest and the entrees looked pretty appetizing.  But since our waitress was a slow poke (to be fair, it was a somewhat hectic evening) - they were barely lukewarm by the time they reached us.  I heartily consumed the two dishes, but to be honest - I didn't feel any magic or spark when I ate them.  They were almost borderline bland - none of that distinctively Indian aromatic taste bud teasing - just a nice array of vegetables smother in their respective heavy sauces.  Now, I'm not saying it was downright disgusting - it was still good, but I somehow expected a whole new world the way people used to describe this place to me.  I think our food arriving pretty much room temperature probably dampened the whole tasting experience. \\nMy companion, who was um, pretty intoxicated, was especially displeased with the food.  \\nWe asked the waitress repeatedly for more water, more wine, etc. and it really became quite irritating after awhile . . . not sure why she was so oblivious to us, but that was poor form!\\nAnyway, The Clay Pit was just average to me.

The Burke was impossibly delicious, with a side of spicy pepper relish that livened up what would have been a very decent sandwich on its own. However, the mac and cheese was really disappointing. The dish was oven-baked, with a layer of macaroni mixed with spinach, a layer of bacon strips with the Gruyere baked on top, with three crostini on top (no garlic I could taste, unlike what the menu said). It looked delicious when it arrived, but upon digging in, I discovered that the macaroni had almost no sauce. I was expecting \\"a homemade sauce of romano and cheddar cheeses,\\" but instead was left with drab pasta of which I couldn't even force myself to eat half. The initially amicable waiter came by to ask us how it was going while I was chewing. She was apparently embarrassed or something and said \\"Or should I come back when your mouth isn't full of food?\\" At this point I quickly had to swallow to tell her that the mac and cheese wasn't very good. At that point, she didn't return, not even to fill our empty water glasses, until the very end of the meal, when she placed the receipt on the table and stood there, at our table, literally waiting until I gave her my credit card.

I tell my best beer-drinking buddy that there is a new-to-me taproom so close to home. We get stoked together and set a date to make a visit. Prior to our adventure, I looked GR up on Facebook to get an idea of the ambiance and if there was a food source. They responded quickly that currently they only carry snacks like chips and nuts, but that Round Table Pizza and Pita Pit deliver to the taproom. Sweet! (We didn't end up eating, but did talk to the owner about possible food options!)We head in on a Saturday evening planning to sample and possibly order takeout. We each got a sampler to ensure we sufficiently tested all offerings. Pleasantly surprised that all of them were delicious. That's an anomaly among newer craft brewers! Also, their prices are phenomenal! For a while, it was just the 2 of us and one of the owners named Amy. She was really fun to chat with and we got to learn about their history :)The taproom is really cool. It's in an industrial district with a fun vibe.

It ranks near the bottom of fast food places I wish to frequent, with the occasional annual visit to confirm that yes... it is as bad as I remember it being last year.  I was not a fan of their old french fries, so I figured it would be easy to improve on it when the bar is set so low.  Well, BK let me down again.  Their new french fry is basically their old french fry, but wider and crispier.  So their genius mad scientist in the kitchen put two bad french fries next to each other and deep fried it an additional time.  Instead of having a bad BK french fry (the old fries), you now have a new BK french fry that is twice as wide and twice as bad.

I love fried chicken and always try to find the best fried chicken in every city I visit. World's famous fried chicken? In my opinion* it wasn't the greatest. First of all, parking was difficult to find. Then, we waited about 15 minutes or more to be seated. One woman said she'd be right with us but then disappeared.  So a man came to assist us. He started to clean the table right in front of us but when he finished he didn't tell us to sit  down.  He left to the other side of the restaurant to assist his other customers.  Then finally came back to ask the people behind us how many people they had and told us we could now sit. We already knew what we wanted to order from waiting to be seated,  but no one came to take our order so we brought out a deck of cards.  Played two games of Killer aka War before our blue-eyebrow waitress came to take our order. Food came out pretty quickly.  Everything was nice and hot like it was made to order so that's great. However,  the chicken was a bit too salty for me. Wasn't a big fan of the coleslaw or potato salad,  but the beans and Mac n cheese were decent. I did like the fact that the chicken was very juicy,  even the white meat. Our waitress didn't check on us much (refills... needs etc).  We had to ask for honey mustard from someone else. Even when she brought us the bill she disappeared again. We tried to pay with someone else but that wasn't allowed.  We saw her on her phone in the kitchen so we waited patiently. Wasn't too happy with the overall customer service here. It was fun to try new places to eat but I wouldn't come back here a second time.

To me, fries are just as important to the burger experience as the burger itself. The fries were just hand-cut and salted... which is fine, if they're fried crispy but these weren't. Yes, I transported these back to the office, but I sampled a few right when I got my order.

As others have mentioned, parking is an issue. They do have a small lot, but at 1:30 the lot was full and the restaurant was not, so we had to drive around a bit. When I went up to the hostess, I was immediately told to take a seat at the bar. This was fine for us, but I thought the hostess could have asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar. Our server was very nice and quickly gave us the run down on the menu. She told us to order at least one burger and one side per person and she was right. The burger was smaller than I thought it would be, but very good. I had the Butchers Burger and my husband had the Philly. I get the feeling that this place is more about the toppings, than the actual burger. We also had the sweet potato tots and the vodka onion rings. I loved the onion rings, but thought the tots were too greasy. The sides are also a bit pricey at $4.50 for a small glass. Overall, I did enjoy my visit to Flip.

Both were good.  The eggs were VERY cheesy, but when I doused them in hot sauce it cut a bit of the richness and made it tolerable.  My boyfriend ordered the oyster scramble/hash dish.  He said it was OK (I just tried a bite - not a huge onion fan and there were LOADS of onion in his dish), but he wasn't very enthusiastic.

I am going back to try the Southern Thai Style Gati Curry, turmeric, mussels, lingcod, ocean wise prawns.We ordered the Pad Thai (gotta be honest I had better, but to be fair, I had the best of the best, so this could be the best for you!!), Halibut Hot and Sour Soup, Thai basil, lemongrass, fried garlic (first time trying this soup, amazing, I would order this again!!), Crab Cupcakes (I could live without) & 3 flavour Lingcod, Thai basil, sweet, sour, salty sauce on crispy  Lingcod. One of the Thai dishes I never fail to crave is Deep fried fish, tasted so fresh and light with the addition of sweet basil.

They asked whether my husband and I wanted a seat at a table or at the bar. Naturally I chose the table option first, but she led me to a six-top that already had a group of four sitting at it. Um no thank you! (on a side note, I haven't quite embraced the communal table atmosphere that seems to be popping up at the newer restaurants... I'm sure I'll get used to it just like anything else!) Anyway, the bar ended up being the best place for us any way! We had counter seating that looked directly into the open kitchen. It was so cool watching the chefs work like a machine. They were so detail oriented right down to the special lingo they used for each dish.So just like Swift's Attic, Sway or Lenoir, Barley Swine has taken to serving sharing plates versus entrees. We were told to order 3 plates each for a well-rounded experience. And we weren't disappointed. Of course we went right for the special, which offered several forms of duck, including a delicious pate. This was probably my favorite course of the night... so don't be afraid to try the specials!  Another one of my faves was the fried soft shell crab. The touch of peach gave the fried crab and deviled eggs a small touch of sweetness that made an otherwise heavy dish seem very fresh and light. Surprisingly the \\"swine\\" was my least favorite, in contrast with the restaurant's namesake. I found one of the versions of pig very fatty... So much so that I couldn't finish my bite. Also, they sure seem to put foam on a lot of things.

There were 6 of us and given that we were all coupled up, each couple ordered a large tray to share. Although it says \\"chef's selection of tacos\\", we all got to pick which tacos we wanted on our trays (it came with 8 total). My husband and I got 3 sesame ribeye, 2 wild boar, 1 Veracruz fish, 1 Baja fish, and 1 spicy chorizo. My favorite by far was the sesame ribeye. The other ones were good too but this was the star. We both loved it so much that we ordered 4 more. For sides, we went with the black bean salad, brown rice, grilled corn, and plantains. They brought us two wrong sides -- cucumber salad & chipotle slaw -- but told us to keep them. My favorite sides by far were the corn and the plantains. It also came with two tamales..neither of which we really cared for.It may sound like a lot of food for two people but we ended up not eating most of the sides and the tamales and would've probably fared better by ordering the tacos a la carte with 1-2 sides. But being that it was both of our first time there, getting a tray was a good way to try a lot of different things to find out what we liked.Oh but we weren't done yet. We obviously had to have churros with chocolate sauce. It wasn't the best I've had but that's not a fair comparison given it was in Spain at a specialty dessert shop. This one though was pretty close and I think as close as you can get to the real thing without having to leave the country.Now the drinks. Oh the drinks. We split about 3 pitchers of the margaritas and boy were they good! When it was all said and done, the damage was around $300 for 6 of us. About half of that went to drinks but I thought it was a bit more than I would've wanted to spend on food. Especially when they were mostly tacos. Regardless, i would like to come back. I think i will skip the trays next time and try the a la carte route which should yield a much better food for the price outcome."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"First time trying Ethiopian food and I have to say that I'm glad I did it here...however, it is not on my list of favorite cuisines. It was just ok. I am NOT a fan of the bread; the texture kind of freaks me out and it has a bran-like taste. I wonder how it's actually made? We ordered the lamb and the fish and some sides and they brought it out on a huge epic platter. The fish was very tasty, the lamb decent and I liked the jalapeno accompaniment. I liked the potato side; it reminded me of Indian spicy potatoes, but the lentil side was a bit...sweet and mushy. The collard green-like scoop was good. All in all, too expensive for what you get and not really worth it. I probably wouldn't eat it again, as I didn't love it.

The service was ok for us, but those around us were waiting a good while.Overall, definitely will not be returning here or recommending it to anyone we know. Not really sure what they're going for here.PS: The beer specials looked pretty lame too."},{"name":"Anna Bannanas NW","address":"1214 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We had a delicious breakfast here, bottomless coffee during and a cup to go complimentary.

Five Guys tries to make up for it by using VERY FATTY MEAT to avoid dry burgers.... but they end up with a stringy gristly burger... Pink Slime??The real shame is that Five Guys could be a great place.... but the corporate founders insist (according to staff at three different locations) on doing everything on the cheap.... and assuming that the employees are without skills and that customers won't know the difference.. even down to preventing stores from selling milk shakes and other stuff that would be great.Instead of great burgers and atmosphere like Johny Rockets.....

The service was really slow, it took almost 40 minutes to get the food out and there was only one person serving as well as cooking the food. Later the owner came and helped that person who was cooking. I think the reason for it was that there was a private party going on in the other part of the restaurant. The owner is really nice and asked us how the food was and if we needed anything.\\nTo start with, don't get scared by the outside  and location of the restaurant. The inside is pretty good and it's set up in a traditional Ethiopian style. If you love sweet drinks, try the honey wine, it tastes like mead. It's not expensive, costs around $7 per glass. For the food, we got the big plate which included everything they have on the menu ($35) and this can be easily shared between 3-4 people. You are supposed to eat with your hands and not use any utensils. Just take the bread and dip it in the different kinds of dishes on the plate. Everything was delicious and flavorful. My favorite was the lamb curry and the ground meat. Nothing was disappointing.\\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone for some Ethiopia food."},{"name":"Wild Ginger","address":"124 Washington St","city":"Norwell","stars":"4.5","text":"This is close to my office, so I eat here quite regularly.

Reading the reviews before going had me a bit nervous about the wait time because I absolutely LOATHE long wait times and waiting in line (part of the reason I don't club anymore). However, when we got there around 930p.m., there was no line to get in and our group got two lanes pretty quickly. I didn't bowl or play any of the other games that were there so I can't talk about any of it. Food: I was on the verge of hangry by the time we got our lanes and finally got menus(about 10 minutes after we sat at our lanes). We ordered the Waffle Dogs, Pin Fries, Pin Burger, a Long Island Iced Tea, and a Moscow Mule Slushie. Loved the fries. I'm a sucker for good fries. SO said his burger was good and showed that by devouring it as quickly as he could. The Waffle Dogs were not my favorite but I'll just try something else the next time we go. The drinks were delicious and strong. I'll come back for that Moscow Mule any day. Service: Our waitress was Megan and she was great. Great attitude and checked on us a good bit considering it was busy in there. Our party had only booked the lanes for an hour(which I didn't know since I wasn't bowling) so in the middle of eating, I was surprised to see that we were being kicked out of the lanes. Megan picked up on my confusion and told me that we could move to two of her tables in the lounge area to finish eating. There was a slight mix-up at the end with my check but she quickly fixed it for us. Valet: There also wasn't a line for the valet when we got there which was great. FYI- as everyone else has already stated valet is $2 and anything you give above that goes to gratuity. The only interesting thing was that when you're leaving,  you have to pick up your car down at the end of the driveway by the street instead of up by the valet box where you dropped it off. It's a small walk and they brought our car around pretty quickly so it wasn't a problem but I am glad that I wore comfortable shoes and not my look-cute-pain-in-the-arse shoes."},{"name":"Summer Shack-  Cambridge","address":"149 Alewife Brook Pkwy","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I'm a huge fan of fried seafood, and Summer Shack offers flavorful fried food that's not overly greasy and in a nicer environment than the typical touristy dive.They definitely have a summer beachside shack feel, but in a nicer way.

Sadly, Comella's is not worthy of an \\"A-OK\\" rating.We found ourself in Monument Square in Concord, without any idea where we should eat.  We saw Comella's and thought we'd try it.  We did not know that it was a chain, since we are from Providence, RI and don't have a location here.We ordered a Sicilian Pizza.  When it arrived, one side was too heavy on the cheese with almost no tomato sauce, and the rest of the pizza was extremely light on the cheese.  It was almost as if all the cheese jumped to the other side when it was thrown in the oven.  Regardless, nothing was a standout on the pizza.  The cheese, sauce, and crust were all just so-so.  Perhaps I am spoiled in Rhode Island by Caserta Pizza and Tommy's.  Perhaps that pizza we ordered at Comella's passes for a Sicilian in greater Boston.  But if it does, I recommend a trip to Rhode Island to fulfill any quest for good Sicilian pizza.  We didn't find it in Concord.The atmosphere in the joint was ok.

Forget folding, if you try to pick it up it just sags and all the toppings run off into the box.

First things first:  Convenient NW location, casual atmosphere and so-so service.It had been a while since I'd visited NW 23rd and had been hearing good things about Southland Whiskey Kitchen from several friends.  I decided to seek this place out for lunch this particularly busy afternoon and was pleased to find available seating.  A rarity on bright, shiny days.  The host was very attentive and seated me and my guest in the dining area of the dimly-lit yet cool venue.  The first thing I noticed was the attractive and extensive display of whiskeys behind the bar.  The menu wasn't cluttered and featured several southern-style plates from fried green tomatoes to southern fried chicken and BBQ.  I chose the southern buttermilk fried chicken cobb salad and my guest had the cornmeal encrusted catfish po'boy sandwich.  We commenced our lunch with an appetizer of fried green tomatoes.  The fried green tomatoes were very delightful.  They were coated in cornmeal and served with a shrimp and cherry tomato relish.  The combination of tart green and sweet cherry tomatoes was very pleasing to the palate.  The accompanying shrimp was equally delightful.  The lunch entrees arrived on time and the presentation was absolutely beautiful.  The battered chicken tenders rested nicely on a fresh bed of romaine lettuce and was surrounded by a colorful array of traditional cobb ingredients.  The po'boy was served on a freshly baked roll and was flanked by homemade potato chips flavored with a hint of vinegar and salt.  The food was amazing and plentiful.  Both me and my guest were quite pleased with the experience.  Our server paid close attention and made sure we remained hydrated and satisfied.  Needless to say, my experience was satisfactory and I would highly recommend this place for any occasion.  The restaurant advertised a brunch menu for the weekend which goes from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.  The menu is comprised of seasonal favorites and remains true to their southland roots.  I will definitely be paying Southland Whiskey Kitchen another visit soon.  I'm almost certain that this place becomes popular around the Kentucky Derby as their mint juleps seem to be among one of Portland's best."},{"name":"Kisha Poppo Japanese Restaurant","address":"1143 Davie St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"I have been going to Kisha Popo for about 3 months now.

The pizza is greasy, and the toppings will fall off, but the pizza is extremely great and probably the best food I had while in Boston.

Because if they had four doors they'd be sedans! Okay, a bit corny, but I thought it was befitting since Gus's serves up... well, chicken.  Best in Austin I'd say! Lucy's got nothing on Gus's yardbirds. But reluctantly, I can't simply leave this review at this point. 3 Stars you ask? For the best fried chicken in Austin? Don't get me wrong, I loved their bird, but the sides left MUCH to be desired. You can't make your main/most popular dish do ALL the work. Make it a team/plate effort! For this reason, they did not get 5 stars. They really have to bring their sides up to par with their chicken. If you go to Gus's, pick only one or two sides like slaw and okra and just concentrate on savoring their fried chickeny goodness. Their fried chicken: wings, breasts, thighs were all juicy, hot, and fresh out of the fryer. The seasoning was perfectly executed with just the right amount of spice to make your lips sizzle a little. Their chickens get 5 stars! Now onto their sides. How do I put this without offending them too much...Mac & Cheese: soggy with over cooked pasta. Bland, kinda watery. No hint of real cheese. Fried pickle spears: thin and flavorless cornmeal breading/batter. Potato Salad: Bland; tasted like cheap deviled eggs with too much yeller mustard. All seasoning went to the chickens maybe??Coleslaw: Not bad actually. Fried Okra: not bad either if you don't mind sticking with the cornmeal theme. I'm actually fine with this type of breading on okra since that's more traditional. But on fried pickles? I think not, sir! Perhaps borrow Plucker's recipe for that one. Kudos to Gus's for the friendly staff. We barely had to wait for a four top on a busy weeknight downtown nonetheless. Sorry I forgot our server's name, but he was nice, punctual, and totally laid back.

This is the fourth place I've tried bahn mi in Portland and prices are typical at $2.50 for a sandwich. Selection is pretty small with only 5 different sandwiches in comparison to Best Baguette's 9+. As for size i would say the sandwiches are smaller than best baguette, but larger than An Xuyen.Anyone who's had a bahn mi knows that they are pretty basic snadwiches that are hard to mess up and so if I had to find a complaint it would be the bread to meat/vegetable ratio is too large. The bread dries your mouth out a tad, but otherwise the sandwich (we got the #1 combination) was good.Atmosphere is not too hot with a typical asian owned look and lottery area past some swinging doors. They have free wifi, but you have to ask for the password and there's a TV in one corner. They also have bottled bear, the typical cheap stuff, some widmer, deschutes, etc. I don't remember the prices though.Ultimately there's nothing outstandingly wrong with the place, but I doubt I'll be back soon because there is better bahn mi in Portland."},{"name":"Depot Square Grille","address":"478 High St","city":"Medford","stars":"3.5","text":"So I wanted to surprise my mom with lunch.

For starters, I get the jasmine tea, which smells and tastes delicious.I frequently order Nisa's Pad Thai, which has fabulous crispy chicken pieces atop very good Pad Thai.  The bean sprouts that come with it are a good contrasting flavor and texture.  I also love Pad Kee Mao, which has a great sauce and tasty wide noodles.  The only dish I haven't been crazy about so far is the Red Mountain.  It's delicious, but served in a \\"crispy\\" bowl that only stays crispy on the edges and becomes a soggy mush at the bottom of the bowl.  A combination of ginger and coconut ice creams is a delicious way to finish off the meal.  I'd especially recommend going for lunch, as you get a tasty appetizer, a salad with amazing ginger dressing, and entree for an excellent price.My only fault is that Fox News is frequently playing in the bar area, and don't get Nisa started on politics, but otherwise a great experience every time.

The sign touts its migas taco as being one of the top 5 tacos in the US, so naturally the place can get kind of busy. We arrived around 9:45 for breakfast, and just missed a long line.In addition to tacos ($3) they also do fresh juices and smoothies ($4-6), which are really great value as they are huge.Taco wise, I had the migas, fish and pork.Migas - I can legit see why this is one of the top 5 in America. I've no idea how they get so much flavour into the egg (which is the main player in the dish), but they manage it. Seriously delicious, flavorful, and also pretty hefty in its own right! 2 of these could easily fill you.Fish - this is made with tilapia, and is definitely one of the better fish tacos I've had in my life. Great texture and crispy, with a good zesty flavor. Not as good as the migas, but a great taco.Pork - slightly disappointed, given that I'm a lover of all things pig. Not that it was a bad taco, more that the migas was so good, and I expected my love of all things pig to compound that even further. For me it was lacking slightly in flavor and just didn't have that punch I was expecting.Overall, great little value spot. Good selection of tacos and really tasty fresh juices - If you're serious about tacos, honestly I'd go for the migas - although the other fillings are worth a try."},{"name":"African Paradise Restaurant","address":"2263 Morse Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"As someone of non-Somali descent you will definitely stick out.

The menu had no prices on them. Once again, this was a bit different. Before ordering we were given the most delicious soup and then a banana. Again, weird but awesome.

All the tacos I've tried are good, but I think the surprise hit for me is the cochinita pobil.  Though it's sweeter in flavor (I normally prefer salty), I was pleasantly surprised by the orange flavor and the mix of braised pork and red onion (they call it achiote).I usually get breakfast tacos here, but I end up getting one with egg and chorizo because the special tacos contain potatoes (which I don't like very much).Don't get the pescado entortillado-- it's small pieces of fried fish in the taco and all you taste (both flavor and texture) is the baja slaw.Last point: they give you two corn tortillas that overwhelm the rest of the taco.  I usually eat only one corn tortilla with the taco and eat the 2nd one separately.Recommendation: I prefer El Chilito to its \\"mother\\" restaurant El Chile. Not necessarily because the food is better (El Chile has way more variety and is more \\"upscale,\\") but certainly because the service is much much better.  El Chile has all these \\"rules\\" that make them unaccommodating to groups over 4 people.  Also, on a busy night they will tell you your wait is \\"20min\\" and make you wait over 45min.  If you happen to get coffee or chips while you're waiting and then decide to leave when you realize that you will have to wait over an hour past the 20 min they quoted to you, they charge you for the coffee or chips.

I'm not one to be judgmental, but you are better off getting food from the gas station than come here. It's a nice, breezy Thursday and rather than frequent our normal Burger/Pizza/Mexican joint, we decided to give this place a shot. We know that it had a dismal 3 1/2 stars and gave the reviewers the benefit of the doubt, but for some reason we went against our instinct and decided to see what it was all about.After briefly walking into Paces and Vine where the manager was talking to a former employee about a paycheck (tacky, extremely tacky) we walked out and wondered what else this melodrama would take us. It was a memorable experience and one that I know we will never, ever forget.At approximately 1:30pm we walked into Cafe at Pharr and were met with a stench of musty bacteria meets mold. It was a disgusting odor that should have signaled, \\"Where was your last Restaurant Inspection\\" or \\"Have you had a flood in a bathroom that hasn't been cleaned since Hurricane Katrina?\\". It made me think of really old and decrepit buildings that you see in condemned houses when you watch those scary shows on ABC but we decided to still, proceed at caution.The waitress met us with complete and utter shock. I think that she was surprised that there were two people that showed up during her shift that wanted to be fed and rather than leading us to a table outside, she shouted a question at my husband and I. I couldn't make out what she wanted to know but my husband translated it into coherent English, \\"Drink, drink?\\". I thought that you normally sit down before you are asked for a drink - this is going to be a long lunch.We sat outside next to two other ladies that seemed to only order drinks of the non-alcoholic kind. After our waitress brought us water, she asked if we were ready to order. After looking at the menu for two minutes I asked her if I could have some coffee and she had to \\"ask\\" if I could have coffee. (I didn't know that coffee was a binary option - you should have it on your menu, You are a Cafe, correct?) She discouraged me from ordering Curry but I ordered it anyways and my husband had a Waldorf Chicken Sandwich on Cracked Up Wheat. He looked really sad as he removed the crust and said, \\"I wish that they could have at least toasted the bread for a second so that it gives me the illusion that they baked it.\\" I've worked in a bakery, so I know what he means.I'm sorry, Cafe at Pharr was far from my expectations. When I think of cafes, I think of a serious coffee habit that many Europeans and Asians have with coffee and the most delicious pastry or sandwich that you can put your hands over. I've enjoyed great food at the most modest places in Europe and the Pacific, and maybe my standards are a bit too, far fetched. But don't charge someone money to eat in a place that feels as if it is about to have a remediation crew come in and change out the flooring for mold.

Scooted over here very late on opening day to see if there would be a scrap or two leftover in the evening.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they had everything that I actually wanted to try (mind you - I'm a fan of J. Meuller's and Franklin's and a long-time victim of watching things get crossed off the \\"menu\\" as they run out).The restaurant is in fantastic location across from Parmer/Long Center and features three huge smokers in the side/rear.  As you pull into the smallish lot - the smoky smell immediately lets you know that you are in the right spot.  Outdoor deck provides a fair amount of seating, but those wanting to avoid the summer skeeters will want to sit indoors.  We met Aunt Nancy as soon as we walked in and got a good lowdown before we sped through the line.  Much like most good BBQ places - meats are by the weight - so keep that in mind as you pile up the plate.Our rundown on what we tried (and we tried as much as we could):Meats:\\nBrisket - soft, moist (to the point of melting) - beautiful marbling and good flavor.  I'd say a very solid brisket - but doesn't quite have a big bark punch.  Nice smoke ring, but would love to get more flavor.Beef Ribs - Crispy on the outside, succulent off the bone.  Great flavor and tenderness without being overly greasy as ribs can get.  Definitely a fan of these big boys.Pork Ribs - Tender and juicy without being overly seasoned - St. Louis style with the cartilage and marbled cap at the end of the bone.  Turkey - Incredibly moist, juicy cut with a hint of turkey fat.  Some of the best I've ever had and a favorite of ours.  This is a must try if you like turkey.  Reminds me a little of Thanksgiving.  Mmm mmm.Sausage - Regular and Jalape√±o  Cheddar.  Both are good, but the Jalape√±o doesn't quite pack a punch so those who can't take the heat will likely enjoy these too.Not tried - the chop beef.Sides:Cole Slaw - crisp, fresh and not overly covered in mayo.  We liked this quite a bit.Potato Salad - Not mustard based - but not mayo-e.  Maybe a hint of dill?  We thought this was a \\"refreshing\\" potato salad since it seemed lighter than most.Beans - While these were good, they weren't the standout in the sides category.Mac and Cheese - Now these are cheesy macs!!  All around favorite since they were very flavorful.  I personally would love to get a little green chili tossed in there to liven them up (but I'd still get them if not).Desserts:\\nPeach Cobbler - Yum.  flaky buttery crust with peaches.  Yum.  Not a cakey cobbler because it has that good ooey gooey filling.Pecan Pie - MMm mmm.  Not overly sweet - but has that same buttery flakey crust with great pecan flavor.  Scoop me some vanilla ice cream cause this was a pretty good way to round up the meal.My favorite part of having Terry Black's in the neighborhood - I can get great BBQ after 1pm down south now!!"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"By far the worst donuts in Portland.

I had a ran-dishing of the smoking Margarita because they were out of the drink that made it taste \\"smokey\\" , the drink Alicia made was so good, i had it 2 times. The China blossom was okay. Not strong... which isnt how i like my drinks. And the skinny Gonzales was not strong either... still good but not strong.

One of my favorite items is the Bavarian Ham & Cheese Sandwich, which comes served on a soft pretzel bun. I always slather the bun with their Spicy Mustard (this is fantastic and I recommend putting this on almost every dish they serve). I like to get an order of their mashed potatoes as my side because they're buttery and garlicky, which is what makes this pair so well with the sandwich.My other go-to is the original Bahama Mama. It has some great spice and bold flavors that you taste with every bite. This is one of the best sausage platters I've had from any restaurant and it has such a truly authentic German taste.The only downside to dining here is during the weekends. You need to be prepared to wait for a very long time. It's a popular place and they do their best to turn around the tables as quickly as possible.

I like classic thin \\"Itallian\\" pizza.  Not one specific kind but generally falling within a moderately narrow band between thin and dry and thin and a bit soupy.   In the Northeast, places that fill that tbill best would be (in no particular order) Totono's in Coney Island Brooklyn, DiFara in Midwood Brooklyn, Frank Pepe's in New Haven, Juliana's in DUMBO Brooklyn and on a good night the Thatcher Street North End Boston Reginas.  If I had written this reveiw 10 more years ago Santarpio's would definately been on this list.  At that time their pizza had that,  je ne sais pas, combination of high quality, light, yeasty, slightly salty bread like crust with bubbles that were burned in just the right amount of places, tomato sauce that tasted of actual tomatos and classic ingrediants like Italian sausage that tasted homemade.  The all important moderate skimming of high quality mozzerella so as to not overwhelm the flavors of the ingredients below.  My mouth is watering just describing it.  So expectantly I ordered three pizza's;  a chesse, a sausage and an anchovy.  What came out of the oven could not have been further than those 10 years from that sublime perfectly balanced pie.  Overworked dough yielded a hard overcooked crust that threatened to crack a tooth.  The pedestiran sausage was fatty and essentially flavorless.  Decidedly lower quality ingrediants made for an uninspired, overpriced pie that I will not make the trip through the tunnel for any time soon. There aren't that many great pizza places so it is really sad when one falls from its former glory!  But cheer up!

He was so friendly and attentive. Oh, and hilarious. We all had each other cracking up and I'll admit, I left with a solid ego boost. It's easy to tell when someone fake laughs at a joke, but we had this guy bent over and tearing up. My friend was too full after her meal and decided to get a dessert to go, but our waiter wasn't having any of it. Instead of shoving chocolate cake down her throat, he still honored her birthday with 4 candles on an empty plate. Hilarious and ridiculous but an incredibly sweet gesture. Onto the food: I ordered the steakhouse salad with sliced prime steak, a deviled egg, mixed greens, avocado, hickory-smoked bacon crumbles, parmesan, blue cheese crumbles and a lemon horseradish dressing. I know I say this a lot, but I could eat that everyday for the rest of my life. I asked for the steak medium and it was perfectly cooked with a ton of flavor. The portion was a nice size and I was full by the time I was finished. My friend ordered the mac and cheese as a side and WOW. If you're a cheese-lover, this mac and cheese is for you. Or should I call it cheese and mac because I've truly never seen so much cheese in a mac and cheese.The restaurant is upscale and a bit pricy but once in a while, it's worth it.

I'm a regular customer and I've seen a customer argue with the main guy there too and it seemed like he was not backing down. It's really disappointing because when I used to go there back in 2012, there was an older man who ALWAYS welcomed me with a smile. I don't know where he went but now it's a younger guy and he doesn't seem to know what is good customer service. I've never had any issues myself so I can't really comment on it. Other than that, the food quality is still pretty much the same as when I started going here which is nice. I don't always find this when it comes to sushi restaurants but after 2 years I'm still happy with the food quality. My usual food item rotations are the firecracker roll, alaska roll, philidelphia roll, tuna tataki roll, agedashi tofu, tamago and tuna nigiri, and the chicken katsu don.Gaya I hope you pick it up on the customer service side because I don't usually continue to support businesses who don't have good practices!!!!!"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Not blown away!

One taste of Pattycake's goods and you'd never imagine they could've come to fruition sans milk, eggs, butter, and cream. My favorites are the dense, sweet double-chocolate cookie and the best banana chocolate chip muffin I've ever eaten. Glancing through their ingredient list, I can only imagine it's the addition of tofu that keeps this muffin moist, soft, and fresh-tasting for days after purchase. Their Tollhouse cookie is also great, packed with chocolate chips and huge pieces of walnut. The weekend-available sticky buns are also light, intensely spiced with cinnamon, drenched in a sweet, thin glaze, and the perfect treat for a sunny walk around Clintonville.The only giveaway that these pastries are vegan? Sometimes they can be a bit oily. Other cons? The service can be rather curt and cold. A big plus? The credit card limit is gone!Very unique, extra delicious, and incredibly bike friendly.

I'm a pretty big fan of both, but still, it would be nice to know if what I am adding to my plate will mesh with the other flavors/foods.Oh, and the Fall/Autumn decorations were awesome.

The crowd is pretty young but it's interesting and people often intermingle so you can expect to meet some different types of folks. The Local has become a standby for my friends and I. You know what you're getting and even if you're in the for the long haul type of a night you can get out for under $50."},{"name":"Orinoco","address":"22 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"It gets the full 5 stars because the food was unbelievable, the margarita was delicious, and the server was friendly and on the ball.

The burger patties always offer the juicy punch I'm looking for, in conjuction to the fresh toppings piled on as a succulent staple. My previous go-to was the Magic Shroom but combination of cheese, pesto and mayo overwhelmed the already established aversion I have for dairy, so I tried the Primetime. Holy Moly, that thing is good. Not too meaty and the most awe-inspiring mixture of toppings. Hopdoddy's decor is clean, modern and Austin-y. I can not rate a 5 for burger place that charges more than $5-$6 for a burger, maybe it's the cheapo in me.  I go to P-Terrys on the regular for fair prices, but Hopdoddy it is when I have a little extra to spend. Tips: \\n1. Do not go during regular lunch/dinner times, you will have to stand in line.\\n2.

I expected that it must be something good and there are many! We ordered a sandwich plate for each of us: the Zuni roll, an eggplant sandwich, the Vieira and the cutlet lamb sandwich. I tasted all of them except the eggplant one and they were scrumptious! I particularly like the one I ordered, the Zuni roll which is a wrap with chicken breast and bacon along with cranberry sauce. It's so savory not too salty not too sweet:) One more nice thing is you don't have to choose only just one side dish (potato salad or coleslaw) that goes with your sandwich but you can have halves of both if those are the options for your plate!This place is worth trying out.

The fried grouper sandwich was amazing.  It was a generous portion and quite tasty.  The fish was cooked to perfection and the homemade chips were delicious too. We also ordered the meatloaf which is served with homemade mashed potatoes and italian string beans.  I found the sides to be tasty and full of flavor.

Let me rephrase that: Darn good execution on the actual food (meats, dips, spreads,vegetables et. al). It is just poorly executed with a hard to grasp menu and ordering system, This  sort of cuisine is different for some folks, so the line takes forever. I think they should offer pre determined flavor combos. Most people were ordering the lavash wraps (essentially like a squishy and better version of a tortilla) So why not create some wraps instead of everyone asking and pointing at what the 40 or so toppings are?Also, The amount of each topping placed in the wrap is abysmal, like a see-through schmear of hummus. The portion of meat seems generous though. Now they also switch around the daily offerings. On my visit they had lamb kebob or chicken schwarma only. Seems odd not to offer a wider selection, but maybe just being spoiled.My last comment is this: I paid $15 for essentially a cold burrito! Yes folks, a lamb wrap with a few toppings is $15! They don't heat up the lavash bread so it is cold. $15 dollars for a cold burrito with no plate, Wrapped in foil. $15! You get my point. With a bottled drink and tip I paid 20 bucks for lunch. The wrap comes with no sides. I was still hungry. I hope they work on the systems here. And the pricing.

Despite the lightly modern approach to most of the dishes, I assumed the food would still have the same balance of flavors with traditional Thai food. 8 Spice Lingcod - Nicely crispy skin-on lingcod in a cloying sauce (more like caramel/syrup) with various toppings including fried basil, fried shallots, and some peppercorns. I mistook some the fried shallots for the bones of the lingcod fillet but it was simply the fact that some of the shallots were tooth-shatteringly hard! This usually happens when the root and core section of the shallot is fried. 2/5Pad Thai - Very very salty. Like eat the whole portion to induce hypertension salty. Perhaps heavy handed with the fish sauce when being cooked. Even with the lime squeezed on, the noodles were salty. Ended up drizzling some of that cloying candy syrup sauce from the lingcod to balance out the salt. 1.5/5Banana blossom and baby corn salad - Unexpected to find out that both the banana blossom AND baby corn are battered and deep-fried. There was a nice dressing of the typical fish sauce, lime, etc and some mint to help counter all of that fried matter. In the end, it was way way too much fried food in one salad. 2.5/5Soft shell crab and green mango salad - A Thai restaurant staple at the authentic joints. One of the better dishes of the night. Green mango salad had the perfect balance of sweet, sour, and salty. Less heavy than the banana blossom salad by far. The portion of green mango salad was a bit small. 4/5Papaya salad -  Crunchy with the whole balance of Thai flavors. A nice refreshing dish alongside the others, but certainly not the best I have had. Also, the portion is A LOT smaller that I expected; maybe a fist sized portion. The one we ordered that say might have been missing the chili and dried shrimp. I didn't see any the day I went. 3.5/5Lamb shank curry - This was also one of the better dishes of the night. A beautiful succulent lamb shank with a nice caramelized crust in a Penang curry sauce (slightly similar to a red curry and Massamun curry). The only problem was that the sauce was too sweet for my taste, and less savory than you'd expect. 3.5/5Thai iced tea - **If you are used to the Thai tea from milk tea shops and other Thai restaurants, then this version may not be for you. It was a delicious Thai tea, but other pearl milk tea places add half and half which is a lot richer. Maenam opts for milk which leaves for a lighter drink with a stronger Thai tea flavor (not a bad thing at all). 3.5/5I hope someday there will be a Thai restaurant in Vancouver that serves similar food to this, only less modernized and in an atmosphere that allows for the casual aspect of authentic Thai food to shine: inviting portions at a reasonable price, no fuss, and balanced. Thanks Maenam for being that Thai restaurant to not serve the typical fried rices, curries, and noodles, but the mark was missed on putting out honest food."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Amazing tacos.

I have no complaints about the quirky decor or kid-friendly atmosphere.  They're not pretending to be anything else.  What I found disturbing was the quality of the food for the price you're paying.  Basically, you're paying the prices of an upscale establishment, but getting food worthy only of your typical American chain restaurant (a la Macaroni Grill or Friday's).  Bulk ingredients (a.k.a. lower quality), way too much dependence on salt for flavor, sauces and soups that taste packaged and processed, etc.  Come on guys....for that kind of money I at least expect fresh ingredients.  I understand there's an enormous market for this kind of insipid food preparation at low prices.  That's why so many chain restaurants thrive.

I typically ordered some kind of tofu/potato hash that ran ~$10 and was fully satisfied. Today, however, I was disappointed. Bijou changed their menu and now offers only one vegan option -- a fried tofu and parsley dish (seemed pretty minimal to me). I noticed they had a special consisting of yams, white beans, a cream sauce and 2 eggs, so I asked the waiter if I could replace the eggs with tofu, and hold the cream sauce. He happily obliged and said the tofu would be a side dish (although at first brought me the dish with eggs included). No matter. What I was not happy about was the bill! The special ran $12.50 and with the tofu on the side, my whole dish was $16.50. Sorry, but that was NOT worth it. I'm saving you the eggs and cream, and it's four dollars more than listed?

Not returning. Do not order flan, just a friendly advice :)\\"Imagine my surprise when I received a responce from the restaurant:\\"Sorry about your bad experience! I wish you had a restaurant... and 3 of your 6 people didn't show up... and 26 tables to serve between 5 pm and 8 pm.

She should really evaluate her management style and maybe her restaurant would do better. I see many people had a wait problem, my dinner timing was ok since I came early. I am not sure what a bad flan has to do with missing employees. I would think desserts are premade before dinner service starts. When I write a review for Yelp, I try to go into details on what was good or bad so that not only customers can be informed about a particular restaurant, but also, the owners could find out where restaurant's shortcomings are and fix the issues and make the restaurant great!

As a restaurant it's not as good as their other efforts.  Pros:\\nClean, and upscale looking.  They really put an effort into the atmosphere.  The lighting was a bit dark though.\\nService was not bad. Cons:\\nLet's start wit the beer.  I love Hitachino, I give them points for carrying it, but $10 bucks a beer is to much no matter how rare it is to find this.   The small plates were disappointing.  One of the things we really liked is the way Bamboo Sushi on 23rd St makes their shishito peppers.  We saw this on the menu here and ordered it to start things off.  Someone decided to put sun dried burnt pieces of ham into it, instead of the chewy tasty bits of ham we were always served at the 23rd st establishment.  A training issue?We decided to try the kushiyaki, and ordered the the chicken thigh and meatballs.  We had to send the meatballs back because they were very undercooked.  I hope I don't get sick from the mouth full of raw chicken I bit into.  It doesn't matter if you are using \\"binchotan\\" if you don't know how long to cook the meat before serving.  Maybe another training issue.  The rest of the small plates were mediocre, and the menu in general was disappointing, and what you would expect from a non-Japanese owner.  Finally burgers are not Japanese Izakaya.  Ok whatever we are in America, but saying that they are made from \\"wagyu\\" is a crime.  A real wagyu steak is north of $300 dollars on a good day.  How they managed to make a burger for $14 from wagyu is some kind of magic or an outright lie.  I'm so tired of seeing people doing this kind of thing, saying they are making wagyu burgers or kobe hotdogs.

If you expect it, it's a little more bearable I guess. I usually get the red sangria or a beer. I've tried a couple of other drinks and I'll admit I was disappointed. But, I'm reviewing the food because after all, it's a restaurant that happens to have a bar. Not a bar that serves food. The Elephant walking on eggs in what I usually get. The portion is big (it'll last you through a few rounds of drinks) and the salad that comes with it is tasty as well. I'll warn you about one thing. The Parish loves goat cheese. So if you don't, ask them to go light on it, because it can be overwhelming.Overall it's a great place to get a good dinner-sized sandwich and have a few drinks.  I wouldn't recommend it for a date (too loud and a little too drunk in general), but it's the perfect spot to take a group of your friends you haven't seen in a while.

I'm giving Flip two stars only for the food; for service, it would go into the negative star range. Why? So, I'm a fan of Top Chef and have been wanting to try this place with great anticipation. We decided to go there for my birthday this past Sunday. We arrived around 7:30, and there was only a 20 minute wait (good). We were seated on the Patio. Right off, our server was not very nice and rubbed us the wrong way. One of us ordered coffee, and there was no cream. Then, when another of us tried to order decaf (as it began to get chilly on the patio), we were told that there was none made. Okay, I can forgive that. However, about 30 minutes after ordering out food, the server told us there was a \\"computer problem\\" and that our food would be another 10-15 minutes. Well, she came back about 10 minutes later to tell us it would be another ten minutes. By this time, tables who had been seated after us were paying for the food they had been served. We got our food after about an hour, by which time it was dark and we were the only people left on the patio. We waited so long for our food that the restaurant was about to close by the time we ordered milkshakes for dessert. After we ordered, the server had the gall to drop off the check before we had even gotten the shake! Rude! Also, they offered us no sort of compensation for the fact that many other tables were served before us. When my girlfriend asked the server about it, she sent out the manager who said, \\"I wish you had told me about the wait; I could have speeded things up.\\" 1) That's not our job 2) The server had indicated she was taking care of it.  In any case, they ended up giving us 20% off, but with the rudeness it was by far too little, too late.Food: Decent\\nService: Worst I've ever had in Atlanta (which is saying a lot).Richard, you may be a good chef, but your restaurant is going to fail if the service continues to be this bad."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is donut place to go, try several donuts like Maple Bacon, Chocolate and some more.

I get to Casa Maria a little after 7:15am. There is no tortillas order ready for me.

What I am greeted with is: \\"You didn't place an order, because we didn't have one.\\" and \\"Our tortillas are cooked.\\" I told the woman, \\"yes, I called at 4:30, yesterday, and I spoke with an older gentleman. Everything was set. And no, they are not cooked I just ate one and it is part raw.\\" Again and more direct she advised that I didn't place an order. There was no apology. There was no understanding. I could tell that she was only going to get confrontational so I ended the conversation.\\"Yes, I must be lying. I appreciate your help and understanding.\\" I hung up. I am so dissapointed. Because of this experience, I will not be going back to this establishment to enjoy their delicious mole, or their wonderful migas, or their abundant plates of fajitas. There are too many other authentic mexican restaurants in the neighborhood for me to put up with this type of customer service and quality.  That's about it. I am now off to figure out how to cook these tortillas before lunch...I am embarrassed to even serve them, but I don't have the time or ability to go buy any other tortillas. What a shame, Casa Maria."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Every time I go to this place the staff, especially the GM TIM are Wonderful!

I had their Primetime burger, deciding to \\"go big or go home\\" so to speak as I didn't have a car at the time and didn't know when I would have a chance to bus back and try the place again.Primetime burger: I ordered the patty medium rare (as everyone should in my opinion, haha) and couldn't wait to try it. I was hoping to have one of those flavor explosions that good burgers tend to give you, but this was definitely a miss. To me, the burger was actually overdone and dry, and didn't carry a lot of flavor at all. I usually can't forgive bland restaurant food, but upon relaying this information to my friends they assured me it must've been an off night and told me to try the place again. So I did.The times I went there afterward were much better. First of all, I have to say the service every time I have gone has been good. The workers behind the counter were friendly and helpful. The ambience is dim lighting, making it feel more intimate and the bar that shares the space with the dining room gives it a 'hip' nightlife feel. i had the Magic Shroom on the subsequent visit. And lo and behold, I became a fan. Unlike before, the burger was juicy, medium rare (how I like it) and flavorful. The mushrooms did NOT make the whole burger slimy, which was a great plus because most mushroom burgers do become that way. The basil came through, and the goat cheese added a good richness to the burger as well. They also offer a variety of sauces to go with fries (if you choose to order them) which are fun to discover and dip into.All in all I really do like Hopdoddy.

We sat at the mozarella bar, where the lady in charge immediately offered us complimentary proscuitto. Delicious!  We all ordered different dishes, and she was able to describe them in detail. Two of my dining companions ordered chicken dishes: Hearth Braised Chicken with Apricots, Figs and Dates; Spit Roasted Heritage Chicken with Prosciutto and Lemon..Another ordered the swordfish skewer, and I ordered the lasagna \\"from the Borgia table\\". We shared portions of our entrees, and we found them all outstanding.  The chicken and swordfish were perfectly cooked, moist and tender, with wonderful depth of flavor and beautiful presentation. The lasagna was a taste revelation for me. A wonderful relief from the ubiquitous tomato sauce based versions. Portions were perfectly sized too. We ordered several different wines and were especially impressed by the reds: Aglianico, Dolcetto, and Multipulciano. All were very good vintages and were served at the correct temperature, something that happens all too rarely. It's touches like this that make a great dining experience. And the service!! Our server Daniel was a true professional: very friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable about wine/ food pairings. In fact, he recommended the wines we chose. We never had to ask for water or wine refills, which were provided often without our noticing. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming with beautiful lighting and low noise level, which made conversation easy.Finally, a shout out to our bartender Jared, who served our pre-dinner drinks at the bar near the hotel entrance.

Both times, leaving our table with empty drinks and waiting on him to return to us with something we'd asked for (first time, it was ketchup for my daughter's fries and second time, it was a to-go box and the ticket). Really bad form. And the other thing that weirded me out about this guy (besides the porn hair/'stache) was the fact that when he was tableside, whether talking or listening, he was constantly doing this strange rocking/swaying side-to-side thing. Maybe it was caused by his nicotine jones. Whatever it was, it was unnerving. In my opinion, the breakfast offerings are superior to the lunch/dinner stuff.

I am glad I did. I'm new to the idea of the build your own cafe style pizza, but I have eaten pizza in some of the more famous places across the country from Chicago style in Chicago to thin crust in New York, to the worlds worst Dominos attempt at pizza. This place is good. Just plain good. The thin crusts they use are very reminiscent of the thin crust styles used in Southern New Jersey, not quite New York, but slightly chewy, slightly salty and a bit charred. Delicious. The toppings were nearly all what I would have hoped. Freshly saut√©ed broccoli, cauliflower, good quality pepperoni, a nice selection of peppers and a great selection of cheeses. High quality garlic and artichokes, just very well rounded. Nothing looked unappetizing, and everything tasted fresh. They do use that somewhat fake precooked and formed tyson style chicken that subway uses, I am guessing for ease of use, which I find to have a horrid texture but I don't imagine most people would mind. It just seems out of place with all the other high quality ingredients. The service was great. All the employees were helpful and friendly, everything was done correctly and ready quickly.

The masala was perfectly creamy and spiced, with the chicken tender and not tasting like it was left over tandoori - WHICH I HATE BTW!!! Take note restaurants, we DO notice reused items and its gross. Bleck.  The curry was buttery and smooth with the perfect blend of spices.  And finally the lamb was incredible.  Big pieces of roasted(?) or seared onion and green peppers tossed with fluffy seasoned rice and tender lamb pieces, mixed in with peas and carrots (neither of which were squish or overly crunchy!).Ahhhhhhhhhhh perfection. It was the perfect meal.  I don't have one con, unless not having an overly warm waiter is a downer for you.

From their signature Bahama Mama sausage to German potato salad, Schmidt's offers an array of dishes to try!My personal favorite would have to be the sausage stew. It was rich, hearty, and full of flavor. Pairing that with the light, sweet apple-and-yam dish gave that blissful yin-yang treatment. All the sausages were wonderful, but the Bahama Mama was my clear favorite (the Knockwurst was second). Just the right balance of seasonings here. The natural  casing on each sausage provided a good snap. To me, the sauerkraut and the red cabbage are the two sides that best complement the sausage. The mac and cheese was cheesy and gooey, although it really lacked that gourmet pizzazz (wouldn't have expected that from a German buffet anyway, though). I also really liked the German potato salad. The zing from that vinegar and the saltiness of the bacon nearly made me do a happy dance at the bar counter.Finally, I couldn't leave without trying one of Schmidt's signature steroidal cream puffs...half-pound monstrosities!The cream was a bit on the rich side (not the lightest I've had), but perfect in taste because it wasn't overly sweet. Some guy playfully wanted me to take it down in three bites or less. Maybe if I could inhale and digest food like a python, I'd have seriously tried to do it.Schmidt's is an amazing place for German food and great desserts.

We were so disappointed.  For over $100, I expect good service, good food, and good atmosphere.  We received none of these things.When we arrived at the restaurant, they shuffled us through two rooms trying to find us a table in a mostly empty locale.  It turned out they had not even taken down our reservation...not that this was an issue: the place was not even close to being full at 8:30.As to the food:  We ordered the foie gras appetizer.  I have never in my life had to struggle to CUT a piece of foie gras.  Foie gras, by its very nature, is supposed to be buttery; a knife should not even enter into the equation.  This foie gras was stringy, drowned in a balsamic reduction, and sparse in serving. The waiter brought us a basket of over-toasted (possibly stale) bread.  We waited another five minutes for the butter, which was rock hard and near impossible to spread.  The foie gras appetizer was supposed to include toast rounds...we received none.My husband and I dared to be different and stray from typical American fare, as we are wont to do.  He ordered the venison; I ordered the duck.  When the plates came out, we were cautioned that they were \\"extremely hot\\": a very bad sign, since this typically means they've been sitting under the warmer for way too long.  My husband's venison looked like a high school cafeteria's salisbury steak.  Both meats--mine and his--were obviously frozen, and I am 95% sure that my duck was defrosted with the employment of a microwave: overcooked, tasteless, and rubbery.  The entrees were served with a laughably pretentious whipped potato scoop, which was under-seasoned.  Along with this was some sort of greenish-beigish blob, which, upon closer inspection, turned out to be a broccoli gratin (I think).  Unfortunately, this concoction received all of the salt that the potatoes did not.  Eating them was almost impossible, it was so salty.  There were two boiled carrot slices on the plate, equally tasteless, and a half-dozen haricots verts that had sadly not fared well during their extended stay under the hot lights.  Top this off with the fact that the whole mess was swimming in a gelatinous, poorly-concocted sauce--no doubt intended to mask the flavor of low-quality, badly-cooked meat.We considered having dessert to try to drown out the flavor of the mess we had both consumed, but when the couple next to us commented that the chocolate souffle tasted like cake mix, we both said to hell with it and got out of there as quickly as possible.  Our waiter seemed nearly apologetic.  On New Year's Eve 2013, my husband and I paid over $100 to flee to Cheesecake Factory to try to forget all of this had ever happened.  Disappointed does not describe; this food is criminal.  I'm reading the reviews to the right and I'm wondering if it's simply a case of people never leaving Orlando, or if they all have a drug or alcohol problem.

Well, although the bottom of the menu had \\"GF= gluten free\\" written out, not one item on the entire menu was labeled as being gluten-free.  Seriously, nothing, not even the salad.  Confused, I asked my waitress what my options were.  She told me a few things and tried to be helpful.  I also asked about the fries.  Initially she told me they were GF, but then came back and said they were not as they were fried with other items.  I asked if they could be baked and she said no.  I then asked about another appetizer.  After checking with the chef, she said that it was not GF as it \\"contains blue cheese, which comes from bread.\\"  What!??!  She then said that the fries could be baked so I ordered those and an entree that I was also told was GF.  Well, my meal was delicious and I thought everything seemed fine....wrong.

It was basically a buffet at our table. They have side salads that go along with the entrees. Lots of unusual items on their menu which had a definite authentic vibe to it. We met the cook and I had read that she was from Venezuela, and was focusing on that type of food here.The bartender was pretty busy and she was the only one taking the orders but she did quite well. They've got some fun cocktails. I had the \\"Fancy Lady\\" which was a bubbly drink.The inside is decorated with lots of light fixtures from the 60s/70s.. you know the amber lights that are pocked and have the black metal around them.  They also have a badly done Conquistador looking painting which goes with the lighting.  Comfy cushiony chairs to sit at at the tables.They've got an outdoor section but, (my pet peeve), the tables have ashtrays on them so the folks that don't pollute have to sit inside when it's beautiful out.On the flip side, we got to listen to a ton of 45s off of their jukebox, all free. We chose the ones from back in the 60s/70s, including Tighten up (both sides of the record), James Brown, T Rex, Yardbirds etc. You could hear the needle picking up after each song.And yes, they do have the song Conquistador, but it was not by Procol Harum and we did not want that dirge in our minds forever so we did not play it. Someone else did though.

We get spicy ketchup with what I believe is chipotle and the fries are topped with a seasoning that contains some salt, maybe parsley? Either way, they were good and I scarfed them.My burger was spicy. I'll take note next time. I like spicy food but found the burger hot enough that it was hard to taste the flavor of the beef. Still I ate it all like I was on a mission. Food, overall is great. No complaints.I like that Hopdoddy's is taking a standard American burger and making it higher end food. It's still leisurely but I feel that a part of America is celebrated with the simple burger.

Not authentic Thai but it was an interesting take. The fried prawn balls weren't tender, actually quite chewy. Some people might dig that. Mussels were awesome, I really liked them - fresh, simple, delightful.Then came the curries. I liked the red curry with prawns but it really tasted more Indian than Thai to me. The green curry was too peppery from total green peppercorn overload. Quite good but not authentic or great. My favourite dish was definitely the white fish with a dark soy sauce dressing. Savory, meaty, fresh. I'm thinking it's cod, but I'm not entirely sure. And fluffy rice to go with it is a definite plus for me, I like perfectly cooked jasmine rice with Thai food.However, I really didn't care for the Pad Thai at all. There was nothing memorable about it. And in my opinion, if you're going to put Pad Thai on the menu, it jolly well be outstanding. It is the yardstick for any Thai establishment.

Every single dish we tried (group of 7 and we all got totally different entrees) was DELICIOUS!! Not a single thing I would change about any of the food we had - everything was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked. Super generous portions of the seafood, no skimping on the lobster in the lobster ravioli, and the mussels appetizer was soooooooo good! That sauce was to die for. On top of the excellent food, the service was great. They ran out of scallops and two of our party had to change their order as a result, which was fine with us, but they comped our appetizers totally unprompted anyway! The manager came over to apologize in person. Such an unexpected and generous gesture, we were all very impressed. Unfortunately I don't live in Massachusetts so I don't know when I'll be back, but I wish I could go here for every special event dinner. I cannot stress enough how wonderful our food was.

We were impressed with the decor, but so much by the food. I had the pork schnitzel with chorizo gravy. A LOT of gravy. Over a cutlet. Over 4(!) buttermilk biscuits. The gravy didn't just smother the dish, it snuffed it out. Any texture the dish could have offered was drowned in a luke-warm mush. My wife had the prawns and polenta, the polenta had a similar affect. While the dishes weren't bad, they didn't quite stand out either. It was a lot of heavy food that didn't show a lot of love.Of course, my son had a very different experience than either of us.

On a early Sunday night, there was one couple who left as we came in, and we were literally the only people there then the entire time we dined for dinner. Our server was friendly, and the drinks came out quickly. The food was all mediocre at best though. They charge for bread and there is a separate charge for butter or oil. We got the butter, and the bread isn't served warm, and the butter was still too chilled and hard to spread. If you're separately charging for bread and butter, I have higher expectations for the free bread put out places... The cheese and salami plates come with only cheese and salami- no accompaniments at all. Both were tasty, and we had it with our bread, which was fine. The pork was dry and lacked much flavor. The steak was cooked a nice medium-rare but also lacked much flavor. The paprika cauliflower tasted solely of paprika and didn't have the nice crunch to it you expect. The potato latkes tasted like salt. The food also seemed to have been prepared while we ate the bread/cheese/salami, and the ones likely prepared first were only lukewarm when they reached us. I'm guessing they just got ahead of themselves since we were the only customers and they just quickly made everything. We didn't even try dessert because all of the food had been mediocre at best and we couldn't justify the price for a dessert we likely wouldn't love. The positives were the large drink menu, a rotating food menu with some unique and delicious sounding options and a cute space. They may just have off nights sometimes, but I won't come back to try again for awhile considering the multiple great tapas options in Portland."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We were spending a few days with my wife's family near Atlanta and Flip Burger was on my list of things to do.  When we drove in, I was a little worried based on the surroundings and exterior but when I walked in it looked awesome.  The design is very modern and sleek looking.  In our party of 5 plus a baby, 3 people commented separately on how comfortable our booth was.Service:  The hostess was kind and accommodating for our party.  Our server, Jabel, was fantastic.  He was personable with everyone and so kind to my daughter in her high chair.  He understood the menu inside and out and had personally tried most of it.  He had recommendations catered to what people were looking for while keeping it light hearted the whole time.  He even gave my daughter some free french fries since she was having a plain hot dog.  They have a guy come around to top off the water all the time which is great because my wife usually drinks both of ours by the time a server makes it to our table.Food:  We got two orders of the vodka battered onion rings to start.  Everyone loved them and the beer mustard they came with.  With 5 people, we ordered 5 different burgers and no one was disappointed.  I had the lob-steer which is chunk lobster meat on a beef burger.  It was fantastic.  I would try something else next time, but only because everything looked so good.  My wife had the classic and added bacon.  The server suggested pimiento cheese and she loved it.  She likes her burgers well done and it was cooked properly.  We tried the sweet potato tots, fries and fried pickles from around the table and all were excellent.  Dessert:  We shared the burnt marshmallow and nutella along with the krispy kreme shake.  It is cool when they come to the table smoking from the liquid nitrogen.

That being said, Clay Pit is not traditional Indian, but rather an interesting version of the country's fare that I find pretty amazing. They do the standards right: the veggie samosas are wonderful, and the garlic and basil naan is always warm, well-seasoned and perfect for scooping up whatever flavorful sauce is gracing your plate. If you like calamari, their coriander version is, for lack of a better phrase, like crack. (Try to stop eating it. I dare you.) And their seafood yellow curry is full of perfectly-cooked shrimp and veggies in the most delicious sweet sauce. (Begin salivating.....now.)The best thing about Clay Pit is that there is something for every pallet. Vegetarian? The rich veggie korma is a delight, as is the vegetarian vindaloo. (Go for medium or spicy; it really adds a punch.) If you trend more towards carnivore, the lamb roganjosh is truly one of the best dishes I have ever had. I would advise going for dinner, however. The daily lunch buffet leaves something to be desired, even if it is pretty affordable. (I had to take off a star because the lunch situation just isn't that great--too many fried things; not enough interest.) The ambiance really adds to what is already a delicious menu. Housed in a quiet old building on Guadalupe, the Clay Pit really transports you a little bit back in time. To top it all off, their wine list is impressive (and they sometimes suggest food pairings.) Clay Pit is a definite not-to-miss."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Flip burger is very good.

It's not a huge restaurant and it seems people linger and chat, so that could be what makes the line so long. Once inside, my friend and I both ordered lattes. She had the lavender latte and I had the the raspberry latte. It's cool that they have lots of flavour options. The flavours were very subtle though and we both would have preferred a stronger flavour. We then shared a waffle with pistachio white chocolate sauce. This was amazing and highly recommended! For our mains, I had the avocado toast with 2 eggs and 2 lamb sausages and my friend had the saumon fume. Both were okay and not really anything special. The sausage wasn't cooked very well in my main and I did get sick after eating it. This was really disappointing, as it ruined the rest of my day. It's actually turned me off lamb sausage forever.

Now, some would argue that it's a very nice 'last resort', and indeed it would seem as such, but not for someone like me. I really want to like the Point Grill, but it's far too expensive for what is offered, and the offerings for vegetarians (again, like me) are extremely sparse: a fatty pasta and a tiny stir-fry. The vegan crispy tofu & broccoli stir fry was great the first couple of visits, but it's not so wonderful once you realise that it's basically all you can eat from there. Still, if I'm going to be (reluctantly) paying $13 for three pieces of broccoli, two carrot slices and ten tofu squares, you'd think that they'd be far more generous with the (delicious) broccoli/carrots and at least give the option for brown rice, something I've come to expect in the city of endless health food stores and yoga pants.

We loved them so much that we came back the next two days and order them to go, back to our hotel room for a light breakfast, quick and easy."},{"name":"Frontier Public House","address":"4909 NE Hazel Dell Ave","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This was our first time here, and have to say I'm impressed with how nice it is inside. The photos on yelp of the interior don't do it justice. This place would fit right in with any of the trendy places in Portland. I also don't think the outside is bad either, sort of retro cool in fact. Parking however is difficult as you have to back out if the lot is full (which it was). The menu as others have said is limited. The best things we ordered are the skirt steak and the bacon wrapped jalapenos, both are great, especially the steak dipped in that incredible sauce. The wedge salad is good, salad dressing should be much thicker as it was watery, and a bit more toppings would improve it to a very good wedge salad. My wife liked the tortilla chips with salsa and cotija cheese, I do wish there was an option to add chorizo or even chicken. The creamed corn quesadilla was really good, sort of reminds me of the southern specialty-fried cream corn, with a corn tortilla added. Definitely would order that one again. Also had the chicken n dumplings, I thought the portion size was fine, but then again we ate it as part of a shared dinner and not as a single entr√©e. The only real stumble was the fish and chips. They need to take the words \\"light tempura\\" off the menu before somebody else that has ever eaten tempura orders it. This is traditional pub style, heavy beer battered fish. Some people like that style but we were expecting tempura as that is what is on the menu (even panko would be fine). The Pacific cod fish part was very good, just don't care for the heavy, greasy beer battered coating. If it just said \\"beer battered cod\\" we would have not ordered this and I felt duped by whomever wrote the menu description. And the fries were frozen shoestrings. In a place like this no question they need to be doing hand-cut fries, and selling them as a featured item. Who doesn't like a cold beer and a large platter of fresh fries? The tartar sauce though was great and this place does sauces really well (except for the watery wedge salad dressing which actually does taste good, just sogs down the lettuce and an easy recipe fix).The cocktails here are excellent, so surprised they serve mint juleps as I usually have to explain to bartenders how to make them and never served in the correct cup. Thank you for featuring that drink. The huckleberry lemon drop is also killer, so good my wife ordered two which she rarely does. Good beer selection too, the Backwoods IPA on tap was my favorite (not logyard or double cutt, something else)Our server, Samantha was excellent. We also had several other servers stop by to help out and they were all very friendly. Really great service overall and yes we were greeted right when we walked in. As many others have mentioned here, this place is very loud. We could not hear each other across the table. I can't imagine how loud it would be if we were there when they have live music. The owners need to address this issue as it is a real problem. One other thing I would like to mention is to give customers some options since it is such a limited menu. For example how about adding house cured corned beef as an option instead of just a Portobello mushroom Rueben, or a NO lox style salmon on the BLT (I'm a west coaster and like my salmon hard smoked but neither kind on my BLTs). You have great thick cut bacon and it doesn't need salmon (which I find just weird on a BLT but sliced avocado would work) I also would like to see a few entr√©e specials rather than just ONE (and it was lamb which is not a big hit in our family). A pasta dish of some sort would be a great addition, I bet the chef could make some really interesting mac n cheese or Alfredo specials. So a few alternatives on current dishes and maybe a pasta addition would really help, and even just one more entr√©e special would be really great. This place could be a 5 star with a little tweaking of the menu and if they get the noise under control. Not sure if I will be back for dinner, at least on a weekend, as it was just too loud (think Oba! in Portland), but definitely will come back in for lunch, and for a couple orders of that melt-in-your-mouth skirt steak!
