I should have gone with a salad instead, my fault. They have a soup side too, but it was too hot for that. The place is small, but there is seating outside, if you can stand the heat. There are several pages to the menu, but I didn't have time to peruse it. There is a Lunch Special insert. \\n\\nI received very good service by a smiling waitress. The food came quickly, the meat was delicious, the pita fresh and I think it spent a  minute on the flattop. Fresh tomatoes, onions, & lettuce and of course, tzaziki (sp) sauce. The fries were good, perfectly and well-seasoned, not just salt. The gyro had the correctly wrapped foil on it for eating without getting sloppy. \\n\\nPlenty of time to eat, read and relax, plus time to get back to work . Reasonably priced, came out to around $10 with a drink and tax. I'll be back.\\n\\nI went back about a month later and the waitress recognized me and smiled and said \\"Welcome back!\\" as I was sitting down. It was just what I needed to lighten an otherwise gloomy day. Had the gyro with the salad this time, it's the way to go!

Came on a Friday night around 6pm just as it was becoming busy.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is much larger than I expected, with most tables being round and seating 6 people each.  Only a very small number of two or four person tables.  \\n\\nOne Yelper noted a perceived preference for seating asians before non-asians, and I have to comment on this as I think it may be a misunderstanding.  \\n\\nThe restaurant gets very busy and we (1 asian, 1 caucasian) waited in line.  There were asian couples/groups seated before us who actually arrived after us.  HOWEVER, it's because the asian groups were asked (in Cantonese) if they would be ok sitting at a table with other people.  Since the tables are so large, they often sit multiple groups together to maximize space.  I think it's more common in asian custom to share tables, while for stodgy white guys like me who wish to wait longer for their own table ;-)  They likely have learned to avoid asking non-asian couples their preference and just assume they want their own table.\\n\\nRegardless, the restaurant is large, clean and brightly lit.  The service is also quick.  Typical to many Chinese restaurants, you'll want to raise a hand to get a service person's attention to place your order or get the bill.\\n\\nMy mouth watered as I watched beautiful dishes of roast meat, spicy fried pork chops, and steaming bowls of congee pass our table.

They rate 3.5 stars on Yelp.  They did not have a Restaurant Week menu posted.  And they price their Restaurant Week lunch at $25, which is the highest of the 3 options ($15/$20/$25).\\n\\nBut my dc nixed a bunch of my suggestions, leaving this as the one with the shortest commute, and they open for lunch at 11am.\\n\\nOnce they posted their RW menu, I once again had 2nd thoughts.  What?!  They are only offering 2 courses for $25?  What was steep became steeper.  And to this sweet tooth, it was a lost opportunity to consume dessert at lunch.  And second, the entrees options didn't exactly thrill me... so I would probably go with the vegetarian entree option, which generally isn't the wise choice for RW.\\n\\nBut my dc put a pleasant spin on it - \\"hopefully that means it's VERY VERY good.\\"\\n\\nMiel's is located inside the Intercontinental Hotel.  What I didn't realize was that it consisted of 3 parts - the front bar area (RumBa), the back dining space, and a patio out in the back.\\n\\nThey started us off with slices of sour dough, which I paired with the olive oil that was already on the table.\\n\\nTheir Beef Tartare - capers, dijon mustard, shallots, parsley, grape seed oil, grilled sourdough - was quite good, though the grilled bread served alongside the stout tower of chopped beef was too burnt in my opinion.  When I asked the server if he could do something about it, however, he willingly brought out a plate of lighter grilled slices (rather limp actually, as if the kitchen was afraid of overgrilling yet a second time).\\n\\nThe portions of both entrees were quite acceptable.  The vegetarian option, the Bucatini alla Primavera - asparagus, broccoli, peas, tomato, zucchini, pine nuts, parmesan, cream - was tasty with firm vegetables and no longer al dente tubular spaghetti.  The Pepper Crusted Salmon Pailard - artichoke & tomato panzanella, basil, lemon vinaigrette - was not as thickly covered with pepper as I had imagined it would be.  Both were good and made for a satisfying lunch.\\n\\n*** 3/2017 RW ***\\n\\nMiel posted its Dine Out Boston menu earlier this time around, and it tempted me enough to plan a return for a 3 course dinner for $38.\\n\\nWe started with the Duck Confit Toast appetizer (caramelized onions, goat cheese, honey roasted pears, arugula, champagne vinaigrette) and found it a shareable portion with a heap of shredded duck topping a full slice of toasted bread.  I enjoyed the contrast of flavors given the sweetness of the pear and onions against the savory duck and goat cheese, and crisp crunch of the bread.\\n\\nThe sides listed attracted me to the Maple Brined Berkshire Pork Chop entree (bourbon glazed honey crisp apples, grilled red onions, fingerling sweet potatoes), while others at the table opted for the Four Pepper Crusted Atlantic Salmon (celery root puree, hen of the woods mushrooms, hazelnut brown butter).  I sampled the fish which my friends deemed overly peppered while savoring the mushrooms, but relished the thick meaty pork chop with its sweet sauce and tender accompaniments.\\n\\nDessert, however, was a slight disappointment after our enjoyment of the preceding two courses.  The Riz Au Lait (traditional French rice pudding, vanilla, canella, bruleed sugar) was as advertised, but nothing special despite the addition of the crisp sugar crust over the chilled pudding.  My Flourless Almond, Orange and Coconut Cake (candied orange peel, citrus cream cheese icing) had coconut shreds too generously speckled throughout the cake which was too much texture for me.  While the citrus tinged icing topping the cake was nice, the grey smear decorating the plate tasted odd to us."},{"name":"Suki Hanna","address":"4060 Town Center Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I often come here with friends.

Very messy to eat but loved the bold flavors, the garlicky-ness, and texture. I got this b/c of the rave reviews by other Yelpers and I'd get it again.\\n\\nBUGSY SIEGEL SANDWICH - $11\\nShort rib pastrami, braised cabbage, Swiss, Russian caviar dressing. Loved the smoked flavor of the pastrami but man, that sandwich was mostly all meat. I'd call it a guy's sandwich for sure.

Not a fan of the taste either. If kale is what you want, pay an extra $1 to get the Hail Hero salad instead - you'll be much happier :)\\n\\nROASTED MUSHROOM & WHIPPED BRIE - $3\\nNot worth the $3 - only filled the very bottom of the Chinese takeout container it was served in. Presentation could be much better. Mushrooms were button and very salty. The brie had an interesting flavor.

The Hydra Salad looked good (but co-worker said the Hail Hero is better).  \\n\\nOverall 4 stars for creativity and interesting ingredients. Staff is very nice too. Just be prepared that with sides, your sandwich meal may be a little pricier than expected. Next time I'd like to try the Kingpig of Crime (rosemary stuffed pork), and sometime try their Evil Potion cocktails ... although some of them do sound potent (e.g., sichuan peppercorns, habanero-lime syrup)!\\n\\n***UPDATED 5/30/13***\\n\\nNATASHA FATALE - $9\\nAnother new sandwich favorite. House cured tuna salad, Swiss cheese, cucumber, sliced tomato, arugula ... all stuffed inside Ciabatta bread. Honestly looked like it might be a boring sandwich but loved the flavors although tuna was maybe on the salty side. Chunks of tuna - not the mushy shredded kind I was expecting since the menu said \\"tuna salad\\". Would've loved more veggies but if you're more about the fish, you won't be disappointed.

First off, you can bring your pup with you if you sit on the patio (screened in this time of year) AND they even have a mini menu for your dog! Also-side note- they sell bandannas for your dog and if you buy one you get 50% off your dogs meal AND the proceeds go to the Oregon Humane Society, how awesome is that?! Now, to the food. I ordered a vegan scramble (I don't recall what it was called) and the flavors were really great- they even brought out some Earth Balance vegan butter for my toast- ah so nice! The group of about 12 people I brunch with were all treated as if we were the only people in the whole place despite them being totally packed.

(Yes, I know they're all different.) But I didn't, and decided that the responsible, adult thing to do was to return some other day. \\n\\nToday was that day. My thoughts? This taqueria could improve in practically every area.\\n\\nI. FOOD & DRINK\\nPretty standard taqueria eats, which include enchiladas, burritos, grilled meats with beans and rice, etc... Their menu does not have some of my favorites such as al pastor and tripas, so that was a bit disappointing. Thus, I opted for the carne asada and carnitas tacos. To wash everything down, I asked for a horchata:\\n\\n*Tacos Carne Asada: OK, but not memorable. The meat had some good fat, however, it lacked a tasty marinade and robust sear. It's really too bad, because that meat could've been crazy sexy. Or, even CrazySexyCool. (YES, I JUST DID A TLC REFERENCE.) ($2.50 each)\\n\\n*Tacos Carnitas: Like the carne asada, the meat could've used more flavor. Perhaps a bit more salt and coriander during the slow-cook? ($2.50 each)\\n\\n**Horchata: Not only did I receive horchata, but mine literally arrived in a gigantic glass chalice that I think is used for margaritas. Personally, I would've preferred a simple plastic cup, but this was cool, I guess. (Haha.) About the horchata, though, it's a basic mix of horchata powder and water. It's satisfying, but nothing to go out of your way for. ($4)\\n\\nII. SERVICE\\nFor me, service is usually an added bonus, not a dock. (Unless someone sets my hair on fire or calls me a racial epithet.) I'm more lenient than most and totally understand that people have bad days. But damn! There were a few misses today, and it was hard for me to overlook. My thoughts:\\n\\n-No one greeted me. \\n-I found the host, so I walk towards her.\\n-Where's the server? \\n-Server comes, so I order a horchata. No water.\\n-Where's my horchata? There are only five other people in this restaurant.\\n-It's in a chalice? lol. \\n-Food. Where's the food?\\n-And the list goes on...\\n\\nSo yeah, I think there are some things that they could smooth out. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and not hold this against them. \\n\\nIII. ATMOSPHERE & D√âCOR\\nThis wild wild west/ Mexican bar setup is pretty cool. I could totally see a western fight scene occur there, and that makes me excited. (Hello The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.) Also, I love how a painting of Frida Kahlo (the one with the famous unibrow) overlooks the entire first floor. I hope that holes in her eyes exist, for the business owners and managers to watch patrons. Wouldn't that be awesome? \\n\\nOh, and there's a small bar, too.\\n\\nOne thing you should know about the first floor is that it's incredibly dark, no matter what time of day. So it's ideal for bringing a date that's not so cute. (I kid! I kid! ...I am sort of serious.)\\n\\nIV. PRICES \\nHigher than average, although, fitting for the higher-than-average Midtown. For tacos, as I noted above, each was  about $2.50. My horchata was $4! (But it did arrive in a glass chalice. lol.) Wow!\\n\\nV. OVERALL\\nHmm, I can't see myself returning anytime soon, however, I wouldn't mind having a future meeting here. I hope their other bites on the menu are better.\\n\\nFor now, I'll give them a very generous three-star. Please improve the food! It's so close to my house!"},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Me and my girls go here for lady brunch and after school drinks & late lunch.

We arrived at 7:30pm on a Thursday night and waited 1 hour and 15 minutes for a table in the \\"pet area\\". We had heard the waits were long, so we expected it. The host was very nice, and super attentive. Our server was meh...told us about the features, delivered our food, asked how it was, but didn't \\"wow\\" us. The service was also a little slow. She didn't ask my bf if he wanted another cider, but made sure we had plenty of water. \\n\\nI would say the menu is typical \\"hipster fare\\". Lol. LOTS of vegan options, and dishes rich in vegetables. I like hipster food but my BF is a meat eater, so he found there were limited options for his carnivorous appetite. He ordered the sausage plate which was a decently generous portion of 2 kinds of sausage with sauerkraut and wedge potatoes, but a little pricey at $17.00. I ordered the pork and pineapple tacos and a garden salad tossed in wasabi bleu cheese dressing and topped with toasted hazelnuts. The salad was a decent size and very fresh...and the dressing was amazing. The pork tacos were good too...they didn't blow me away, though. My daughter ordered a cup of soup - it was a beef stew that she enjoyed. The server told her it came with a baguette, so my daughter expected a chunk of crusty bread but what it actually came with was a dollar-coin sized 1/4 inch slice of baguette. Lol\\n\\nWhat was cool about this place was that you can order an entree for your dog. We ordered beef and sweet potato for our small dog. They bring each dog water in a doggie dish and also serve the food in a doggie dish. The dog food entree was $7, which we found pretty pricey for what it was. You could order beef or chicken with rice OR sweet potato. For $7, you'd think the beef or chicken would come with sweet potato AND rice. On Tuesdays, dogs eat free, so I would imagine Tuesdays are a popular day for dogs at the Tin Shed. \\n\\nCute restaurant in a neat setting (it's literally a tin shed - small restaurant covered in galvanized metal with a garden patio. It's in the trendy hipster Alberta district neighbourhood. Sooooo many hipsters...whatev, they're cool. \\n\\nNo idea what Guy Fieri tried when he was here. I'm guessing he didn't try anything vegan!

We washed it all down with a couple of interesting brews from the bar.  Great service, and everything was yummy.  The only downside is the lack of variation for their main entrees.  I guess this is because of their in-season-only policy, but of a list of only 6 or so entrees, a full half of them were fish.

This included adding a array of heart melting desserts, instead of the usual brownie or dry cake the last owners called a dessert. I was impresses by the grade-A quality service given to us by a tall, African-American man with a wild Afro and a soft warm voice. My cup was never empty, and our food was the one some of the best I have had in years! The cook even came out to greet us and ask how our food was, which was quiet impressive!

Great food, Great taste, Great service, and Great new owners! I would love to see this place flourish, even more than before!

We ended up coming here twice - the first time for the burger, and ended up sharing some other plates and drinks with friends, and then again to get the burger and try some other things that appealed to us on the menu.   This is the point of burgerweek, offer a great deal and get new customers through the door.\\nI will say, the first evening there was far superior to the second.  Their burger was SO good - perfectly medium rare and tender beef, delicious soft bun, spicy ginger sauce and asian pickles... oh it was delicious.  They had watermelon mimosas!  Duck confit in custard (soooo yum)!  Raw scallops, raw tuna... it was all amazing and I was conviced this was my new favorite restaurant.  I spied chef Johanna Ware (we share the same name lol) and knew things were coming up on point because she was there.  The service was impeccable and they were jamming 90's R&B.  The manager even sent our table a round of apertifs for no reason whatsoever.  We had an excellent time.\\nThe second night, was not as great.  We sat outside, so I can't confirm who was working the line, but I was not as impressed.  The burger didn't come out the same at all.  Nearly well done and the bun was a lot stiffer.  The flavors were good, but the bite of it was just not as appealing.  This was Sunday evening and they were probably just 100% over burger week (we all were) so I can't hold this totally against them, and the burger was only $5, but still.  If I had had THIS burger the first night, I would not have come back.\\nWe did try the kale chips this time which were amazing.  I loved the sauce, texture, everything.  Could have eaten a couple bowls of that.  \\nWe also had the spicy duck ramen, but they were out of duck so chicken was put on top instead.  It was still the same yummy broth, and it was decent, but nothing to write home about.  I've had better ramen for half the price.\\nThe cocktails were again, perfectly balanced and delicious.  And I do love the neighborhood and ambiance.\\nI'm going to keep the inconsistency in mind and the food was more delicious than not.  Overall, they definitely deserve a 4 star rating for what they've done and are capable of continuing to do.

First time seeing that anywhere; welcome to Portland!\\n\\nThe wife had the BBQ burger which she said was very good.  With that she had their soup special, a tomato-basil bisque, that she described as \\"amazing!\\".  I tried it, and agree that it was pretty tasty.  I had the Stacker sandwich with marinated chicken, avocado, red onion, tomato and cream cheese.  I opted to hold on the cream cheese.  It came on what looked like locally made sourdough toasted on the grill.  The sandwich was very tasty!  Nothing too overpowering and it all went together well.\\n\\nThe only negative that I have is that the food took 30 minutes to arrive, and they really didn't appear to be THAT busy.  Our server was very apologetic and even brought me a complimentary pint of Wit, raising this rating from 3.5 to 4 stars based on a server who actually gave a shit that we were waiting a long time.\\n\\nOverall, the Tin Shed is a fantastic neighborhood restaurant that, if I lived nearby, would probably become my \\"usual\\" breakfast or lunch place.  The overwhelming vibe that I felt was that this was a place with a staff that really cared about their food and their service.  What more can you ask for?

This is not your typical elementary school-ham-and-cheese sammies your mommy made. Bunk Sandwiches is on a totally different level from that! Their sammies have substance and great flavor profiles.\\n\\nI've been wanting to go here for the longest time and finally made a visit! Bunk Sandwiches has two locations. The original location is on SE Morrison. For my trip, I went to check out their sophomore location off of SW 6th Ave. The venue is very, very cozy! It probably fits less than 10 people to sit at bar stools. I wasn't sure if there were any bathrooms. They had 2-3 patio tables outside as well. \\n\\nWhat to get (SO WORTH IT):\\n-PORK BELLY CUBANO: this sammie was featured on the show Man v Food. After having a bite of the delicious pork belly, thin slices of ham, a couple slices of Swiss cheese, thin slices of pickles and hot mustard upon a flat baguette, this sammie was worth it! The pork belly was utterly delicious - and with all the other flavors, the overall sammie is quite a food-gasm! ($9, 5 Stars)\\n\\n-MEATBALL PARMIGIANO HERO: was quite amazing! This is totally worth getting marina sauce and melted cheese spilled upon yourself! Even if you're wearing white! The meatballs are cooked so tenderly. Lots of melted parmigiano cheese were scattered throughout the sammie. Placed upon a hot-dog type bun, this meatball sandwich was just as mouth-gasmic as the Pork Belly Cubano. ($8, 5 Stars)\\n\\nTake a pass on this (not worth wasting your money and time):\\n-PULLED PORK: the idea of a pulled pork sandwich sounded great on the menu. There was an abundant amount of meat, apple-cabbage slaw, sliced pickles and deli-style mustard, embedded between a poppy-seed kaiser roll. Unfortunately the sammy came out quite soggy. In addition, the mustard and the sour-tangyness from the cabbage slaw, over-powered the essence of the pulled pork, that you could hardly taste the flavor of the meat. I couldn't even try to finish a bite of my share of the sandwich. I commend them for this unique sammy, but the flavors did not collaborate harmoniously. ($8, 2 Stars)\\n\\nService is friendly, quick and cordial! The employees making our sammies were kind enough to slice our orders into a couple of pieces for us to share! (Thanks!) Parking here can be quite limited since you're in downtown. You may be lucky to get two spots off of SW 6th (90 minute max meter parking), but there are other streets nearby you can find parking at as well (paid meters).

Was to be ready within 37-47 minutes. I watched the food tracker and noticed about 10 minutes passed before my food left the store. \\n\\nOnce at the hour mark, I called questioning the length of the order and was told that there was a delivery before mine.  At the 90 minute mark I called back but was interrupted by and incoming call from the driver who asked me \\"Where you at?\\" Confused I tried to ask where he was and direct him to my home. He became aggravated \\"Oh my god...\\" he sighed.  He was hostile and aggressive on the phone then proceeded to ask me if I was going to pay for my order? This is when I became offended. How am I. Being judged as a criminal simply for trying to help you find me to give me my food. I asked my husband to go outside to find the driver and he initially came back unsuccessful. The driver meanwhile is on the phone yelling at me \\"You want your food? You're gunna get it alright. I'm outside, where you at.\\" Turns our he was at the wrong home. \\n\\nI called he store to explain that not only was my food cold, the additional items I ordered were not delivered. I ordered my food at 3:30 yet here it is nearly 3 hours later and my husband is actually in the store waiting for our food. The store manager was reasonable enough to remake the order but after speaking with him, being told the order was being made, getting dressed, and driving to the store, the food hasn't even begun to get prepared yet. Bad service all around today. Why it's always the places that cater to black neighborhoods that give the worst service??

We were there on a saturday night with an 8:00 reservation, and the place was empty. only three tables eating put of maybe 45 or so total tables. his should have been a warning light, but given the fact that its in the intercontinental i figured is was an oddball, bot the rule. The wait staff was there to take the order and fill the water glass as well as refresh our cocktail and wine so I'd give them a four star for the most part. However they never asked us anything like \\"how was your meal\\", which I found a little disappointing at a nice place like this. \\n\\nFYI, they no longer serve multiple olive oils with the bread. Instead they have an olive topinade with a small bottle of decent buttery EVOO on the table. I was expecting the EVOO buffet, but this was nice enough. \\n\\nNow the apps were outstanding. The honey glazed sea scallops with parsnip pur√©e was Devine! It was a 10 for sure. The baked oyster provenciale was good, but besides the garlic we really couldn't discern any other favors of Provence.\\n\\nSo far we are at a four star, pushing to a five if anything wows us. Unfortunately our entrees arrive and wow. The duck ( ordered med rare) is full brown! It boils my bubble when top food is ruined. The accompanying items were decent enough, only the chickpea casserole was very dry, again seemed way overcooked. My wife had the lamb steak. It was a horribly tough cut of meat and should have been turned into stew or mergueze rather than served as a steak. Again, she ordered medium rare and it was brown throughout. A one star for the entree!"},{"name":"Alfredo's Italian Restaurant","address":"1989 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Located off of Cheshire Bridge Rd. in a seedy part of town full of strip clubs and \\"adult novelty\\" stores, Alfredo's isn't much to look at when you first arrive.  But don't be put off!  Inside the nondescript brick building is one of the Atlanta culinary scene's hidden gems.  Plus they have plenty of free parking!\\n\\nThe first thing you notice is how \\"authentic\\" Alfredo's looks.  With Italian opera playing softly in the richly colored and perfectly lit dining room, I always feel like I'm on the set of The Godfather or Goodfellas when I walk in.  The bar is on your right as you enter.  It is fully stocked and usually tended by an attentive and knowledgeable woman who's name escapes me as I write this review.  Feel free to arrive early and unwind with an aperitif at the bar because there is always good people watching at Alfredo's.\\n\\nLet me just start by saying that all the food is good.  Order anything on the menu, but here are some of the items I have enjoyed from Alfredo's.\\n\\nThey are famous for their veal, which is hand cut on the premises.  If that sounds like your thing then try the Padrino - one veal francese, one veal parmigian, and one veal marsala all on the same plate.  First rate!\\n\\nAlso imminently satisfying is the New York Strip - cooked to perfection with a light char outside and a perfect medium rare inside and served with a port wine mushroom sauce.  I'm starting to make myself hungry.\\n\\nBut what I really LOVE about Alfredo's is the fish.  The Snapper Casalinga is awesome!  But I always ask the waiter about the specials.  Occasionally they will offer a Chilean Sea Bass in a white wine butter sauce with capers and sauted portabellas that is so delicious you will lick you plate clean.  I'm not kidding.\\n\\nI've tasted most of the desserts and can say with reasonable certainty that you will be satisfied with anything you choose.  My favorite is the ricotta cheesecake.  They use fresh, homemade ricotta cheese.  I have never tasted anything like it any place else.  I usually wash down my ricotta cheesecake with an espresso since Alfredo's espressos are perhaps the best in town.\\n\\nThe downside - typically I will spend around $120 for a four-course meal for two with wine.  But you can probably show a little more restraint than I and still come away with a fantastic dining experience for far less if you are on a budget.\\n\\nInsider Tip: \\nAsk for a booth when you make your reservation (definitely make a reservation).  Cushy and upholstered in smooth black leather, these booths may be the most comfortable restaurant seats in the world!"},{"name":"Smallwares","address":"4605 NE Fremont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Delightful neighborhood place with top rate food.

Almost a chicken Marsala with Swiss. It is actually under the burger section, but I picked chicken as the protein instead of beef, and left off the bun. I could swear that the spinach dip and potato salad were from Publix. I eat both from Publix at home, and I find it almost impossible that both would taste the same. Never had that at any other restaurant. Not that they were bad. Just not made in house and never heard of any restaurant serving anything from Publix.

Sure it has a solid four star average, but over the months it has apparently tanked. Thank you Yelp for providing this extra service. \\n\\nI came here with my uncles and my mom for a late breakfast/early lunch deal. We were all kind of hungry but up to try something new. There was no line when we got inside and we quickly decided on what we were going to get. I really wanted a Chai, but unfortunately they serve Dragon Fly and I'm allergic to the stuff. Instead I ordered a steamed soy milk and a PB&J sandwich. The others got drip coffees and a diet coke as well as a cheese bagel, turkey sandwich and a grilled three-cheese sandwich. \\n\\nWe ordered (and I must add my voice to the people annoyed with the $.35 charge which, might I add, breaks the agreement that all business owners when they sign with the credit card companies) and then we waited. And waited. Someone got their latte and I still was steamed-soy-milk-less. I decided to stand and wait for the food while the others found a giant (I'm talking HUGE) table and sat down. Never once did the barista dude tell me he was going to bring the stuff to our table. Instead he walked past me with the stuff, making me feel like a total dweeb. Believe it or not, I don't like standing aimlessly in the front of coffee shops. \\n\\nFinally, after what must have been fifteen minutes, we finally got to eat. I would have blamed the wait on my mom's grilled cheese, but that couldn't be it as the STRING CHEESE in the center hadn't melted. Who, pray tell, puts string cheese on a sandwich...WHOLE no less.

It was on the 16th floor and looked like some kind of old holiday inn room from the 80's, there was such a strong, odor of mildew and smoke; I had to call down to have us moved. We ended up in room 720. This room was slightly better, did not smell like smoke but certainly musty. The bathroom is not updated with a tub that you would find in a holiday inn, but not even a new holiday inn express, again an old hotel tub. The lights in the bathroom were dim.

Super nice and funny.\\n\\nOur meal started with chips, salsa and queso.  The chips were white, red, and black.  Am I the only one that feels weird about eating black tortilla chips?

You have a problem with the black tortilla chips?\\"  The salsa was pretty good, as was the queso.\\n\\nWe sipped our drinks while we waited for our food to arrive.  I had a raspberry margarita and my boyfriend had the equivalent of a Mexican Martini.  He had 2 during the meal and acted a bit tipsy, although he said it tasted weak.  My margarita was great.  \\n\\nWhile sitting in that booth, we pondered what the place would look like if the lights were turned all the way up.  For one, the decor would seem quite garish--very loud colors and lots of stuff stuck on the walls.  The most striking thing would be how dirty the place is.  The booths are separated by partial walls, and those walls are FILTHY.  Looks like many years of salsa-smearing by children. The floor was pretty nasty, too.  \\n\\nOur food was okay.  I wasn't very hungry so I just ordered some tortilla soup and my boyfriend had chicken enchiladas.  They claimed the soup is the best in Austin.  It was kind of strange when our waiter friend set the bowl in front of me.  It had no broth.  He then poured the broth on top of the chicken and stuff in the bowl and told me to say \\"when\\".

The restaurant comes with a scenic view and a romantic airy space. The hotel restaurant is close to the Downtown core, but still quietly tucked away from the crowds and offers a lovely ocean view with ceiling-to-floor windows and sky rooftop. \\n\\nWhen making a reservation, a seat by the window or on the balcony is highly recommended for a glimpse of the ocean. Staff is very polite on the phone and will set aside a 'reserved' sign for your table. At the window, boats  can bee seen sailing on the ocean. The tall windows and sky rooftop brings in a lot of natural sun light which makes the restaurant feel open and bright. There is also an outdoor patio that overlooks the streets.\\n\\nGaliano Island mussels were ordered to start, followed by the entrees Angus Burger and Ahi Tuna Poke salad. The Galiano Island Thai coconut mussels were fresh and the sauce paired very well with it. It tasted like there was a hint of wine in the sauce. The Angus Burger's meat was a bit dry and too well-done, so it wasn't juicy anymore. This may have been due to the restaurant being so busy, so maybe it sat on the grill too long. (We came in during Canada Day last summer). The Ahi Tuna poke salad was delicious, but the tuna was mildly over-seared and tasted more like tuna jerky. The salad was made of organic quinoa, crispy rice noodle, avocado, cucumber, edamame and grape tomato in Sambal sweet soy reduction. The sweet soy was very good, making this salad a dinner favorite at our table. It would have been preferable if the Ahi Tuna poke was more raw.\\n\\nAmericano coffee and a Hot chocolate were ordered after dinner. The beverages took a long time to come (at this point, the restaurant was crowded and very busy). The server noticed that the hot chocolate was wrapped in a cloth napkin. We were trying to keep it warm since it was getting cold from the wait for the dessert. Even though 3/4 of it was finished, the server offered to replace it with a fresh complimentary hot chocolate. It was a very nice gesture from her, and it was delightful to receive a new piping hot chocolate to go with the just-arrived dessert. The server was gentle, friendly, and did her best to serve guests and tourists as promptly as possible during a bustling evening. The White Chocolate creme brulee was made in-house, with raspberries, blueberries and a Madeline lemon cookie lightly brushed with icing powder.\\n\\nOverall, this restaurant lies somewhere between casual and classy (it can be both). It can be a romantic spot for couples, or a party night for groups. There were several couples inside, and the casual groups sat at the outdoor patio for fried food and beers. If you are looking for an open space restaurant with natural sunlight in Vancouver Downtown, but not directly in the crowded areas of Robson or Canada Place, P2B Bistro at the Pinnacle Hotel offers an intimate and scenic atmosphere."},{"name":"Joe's On Juniper","address":"1049 Juniper St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I used to love this bar.

Unfortunately, they got my order wrong by giving me two tacos I did not order and initially forgot my beer (which seemed kind of small?) so that was a strike, though to be fair we were too hungry to return the tacos and they were decent anyway. Also, inside seating was very small, so we ended up having to sit outside in the Texas heat. Patio seating is nice, but considering the weather here is sweltering most of the year I think they should have invested in more indoor seating.\\n\\nThe tacos themselves were solid. I loved the variety of options and the unique flavor combinations. The queso was really unique and flavorful, but it was SO drippy that I ended up making a mess all over the table and some even dribbled onto my dress. The flavor was worth it though--red curry and coconut go surprisingly well with cheese, who knew!--but unfortunately the tortilla chips were SO salted we could only eat about half of them.\\n\\nOverall, I hope my next experience is a bit better, but it's a pretty good lunch spot if you're in the area.

Their happy hour menu is decently priced-- cocktails were $8 and food ranged from $6 to $8. For cocktails, I would recommend the Uptown Daiquiri and for food I'd recommend the zucchini fries. We also ordered the shrimp and grits, calamari, and lump crab meat mushrooms, which were all pretty good. But, our experience was TERRIBLE. We arrived around 5:30pm on Friday  (a time when restaurants should be prepared to start getting busier), and we waited 1.5 hours to receive our food! Aside from the bar/lounge area where we were seated, the restaurant was basically empty, so we were very confused as to why we had such a long wait on food and drinks. It took about 30 minutes for my friend to receive a club soda! Then, a friend who ordered at least 10 minutes after the rest of us received her food first! It was at that point that our new servers realized that our previous server never even put our orders in (I think the first server was asked to leave after the complaints started rolling in). The group of 3 seated next to us had the exact same issue-- their food and drinks were delayed, and parts of their order were completely missing when the food did arrive. We all spoke to the manager who was very nice and apologetic and took care of part of our meals, which we really appreciated.

He told us that there was no reservation under that name at all (obviously untrue because we all have the email confirmation). In any case, we went and found our friends already seated. There was no water on the table even though they were already seated.\\n\\nWe perused the menu and someone came and filled our glasses. Some half full, some too full etc. Obviously just wham bam thank you ma'am. Just wanted to get it done. \\n\\nThe kusshis were delicious and super fresh. Loved the light green mignonette they had. The red one was too much of a punch and took away from the delicate flavor of the kusshis.\\n\\nThe chicken and waffles were tiny. For $16 I expected more food. The waffles were thin and there wasn't much drizzle. The chicken had a lot of flavor on the outside but the inside was bland. I was still very hungry. I told my girlfriend on the way home I'd probably need to get more food.\\n\\nThe beignets were not that amazing in fluffiness. They weren't oily so that was a plus. The dipping sauce was delicious!\\n\\nThe reason for the 1 star:\\n\\n- service was atrocious. Couldn't flag someone down. Literally waited over 15 minutes before I ended up getting help at the bar. \\n\\n- the grits were lumpy. Grits are never supposed to be lumpy. It's a sign that there wasn't proper care and attention to those grits.  It was also way too watery. Grits should have the consistency of cream of wheat or congee. \\n\\n- a table near us who'd gotten there before us still hadn't gotten their food. We were all mostly done with our food. She inquired. All she got was really crappy attitude. If I had just been seated, I would have left from just watching that interaction. In fact, the table nearby that was just seated did get up and leave. Wonder if it was because of what they witnessed, the fact they hadn't been served water and/or because they'd been waiting over 15 mins and no one had come by to ask if they wanted to order yet. Anyway, the fact remains their \\"apology\\" to her was a non apology. Told her that his brain was fried and the kitchen was busy and it's brunch so what'd she expect. Are you effing kidding me? How about he try this on next time, \\"I'm very sorry for the delay. There's no excuse. We're very behind in the kitchen and as an apology, can we offer you some drinks on the house?\\" Or comp one or two of their 5 entrees. They were so hungry that when just one of their entrees showed up, the five of them shared it. And that entree was tiny so sharing it was like splitting a scallop among 5 people. \\n\\nThey used to be pretty great. Aside from the oysters and great green mignonette, there isn't much to rave about. Come during 3-6pm buck a shuck and that's about it. The lack of customer care and service was appalling and so were the portions. \\n\\nLastly, customer service isn't just for buds. You should be as great with everyone as with your friends. Two of their buds showed up and we watched as they were greeted with bro hand shakes and literally bud this and bud that. Their drinks came out immediately. No joke.

Being that she was nice little Asian woman, I had a bit of a hard time understanding why we were getting a soup sampling, but we went with it. Anyway, the soup was not good. One was Cream of Potato and the other was a very sad attempt at French Onion. Needless to say none of us ordered the soup.\\n\\nWe all ended up ordering breakfast because that is why we came here.

There were pictures of every dish much like a dim sum menu. We all ordered the normal breakfast type things. Eggs, potatoes, etc. I will say the pancakes were quite good.

Fantastic food in a chic but cozy atmosphere, with prices to match.\\n\\nWent on a Saturday reservation for two at six. It's immediately clear why reservations are essential and hard to come by: The place is *tiny*. But with the exception of negotiating my way to the (impeccably designed and clean) restroom, I never felt cramped or crowded. Even when the tables filled up around 7:00 the volume never rose above conversational, and hushed every time there was another blaze of fire from the open kitchen. The excellent use of lighting and space to keep the mood relaxed reflects the care that seems to have gone into every aspect of Benatti.\\n\\nOur meal was no exception. My companion started with \\"the best salad with balsamic I've ever had.\\" While she was enjoying that, I was devouring my seared scallops in an orange juice reduction. After years of eating scallops prepared with the most delicate sauces, it was a revelation to see that they can hold up just as well against something so rich.\\n\\nNext came the pumpkin tortelloni for me and seared snapper for her. The tortelloni was simply the richest, most delicious pasta dish I've ever had. I see on the web site that the filling is made with Amaretti cookies. Yeah, that sounds about right. Other Yelpers have complained about the portions, and while I'm sure I could have handled more than the ten or so little pillows of heaven on my plate, they were more than satisfying. The snapper also didn't look small by any means, and the well-seasoned fish melted on the tongue.\\n\\nDessert was the caramelized banana and chocolate mousse. As promised by our server, the mousse was delectable.  Again, more than enough to split after the rest of our meal.\\n\\nService was attentive (love those water pitchers!), knowledgeable about the menu, and amazingly agile at maneuvering around the miniature maze of the dining room. The wines we had by the glass were exemplary.\\n\\nFor all this, you pay prices on the high end for Boston, let alone Cambridge. But to me they were decidedly fair given the experience. If you're looking to try Benatti without committing to a $150 check, it seems to me that showing up early to grab the pair of seats at the butcher block bar between the dining room and the open kitchen would be an excellent move, and probably an educational one."},{"name":"Kanji Ramen","address":"12636 Research Blvd, Ste C101","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'll start this review plagiarizing another review.

We came on a chilly evening, perfect for a hot bowl of ramen.\\" And after having some pretty good ramen earlier this week, have to say Kanji is just passable. \\n\\nI ordered a #1 signature ramen that's effective a tonkotsu shoyu blend with extra chashu, nori, mushrooms and bamboo with an egg. The broth tastes good but is definitely on the thin side. It doesn't soak into the noodles very well and you only get the hit of flavor when you drink it directly, but the flavor is good. \\n\\nThe sides are a bit bland - chashu is fatty and reminds me of bossam - clean pork flavor but not much additional seasoning on its own. The bamboo is a bit sharply cut, which gives it a woody texture (for better or worse). The egg came out in the soup cold, which is more jarring than anything.\\n\\nThe owners are nice and check up here and there. Ambiance and space is quite nice if you care (especially the mural). So if lighter feeling ramen is your cup of noodle, then you'll love Kanji.

She made a little more small talk and was ready to walk away but I stopped her and asked if we could go ahead and order drinks. \\"Oh, yeah.\\"  She said. My daughters and I got San pelligrino and I ordered a Martini. My husband ordered a Manhattan. We indicated that we would be ordering wine, so she cleared two of the four wine glasses. \\n\\nShe disappeared for a while again and we used the time to select appetizers.

No complaints here...it is always good. \\n\\nI ordered the buffalo strip loin and my daughter got the tenderloin.  Both were fine but under seasoned. Salt and pepper are a good thing. \\n\\nI forgot to mention that my husband and I ordered wine right before the entrees came out.

I think they have good food intentions but miss the mark by a cooking method here and an ingredient there. Years ago this was on our must do list, but I think it'll go into the standby column. I can get the mushroom soup at the bar next door and get a taste of the best dish at artist point without spending a fortune.

The price, however is probably just to attract new customers and once they get going, if they ever do, they will take the special away.

This decor gave the appearance of a dimension in time in which two very different eras had collided, but in congruity. The service was excellent, I believe all restaurant attendants should have as much passion in expounding upon the menu as any owner, such as the case at the Corner Bistro. I had ordered a Shirley Temple, which was delicious, with the smooth and slightly sour in combination. A friend of mine had ordered the Fizzy Pink Lemonade which had the most appropriate combination of sweet and sour, probably one of the best lemonades which I had tasted. I also ordered the baby French onion soup, which was served with both a savoring spoon and a larger spoon; the consistency was soft and smooth, while the soup itself was savory, with the sweetness of the onions came through perfectly in the broth. For an entree, I had the beef tenderloin with the added veal bone marrow crust. The tenderloin was prepared just as I have a liking for, seasoned perfectly, medium well and slightly smoky with a deep rich flavor, the added crust gave an appropriate balance of textures, in a word, excellent. The frites on the side were also quite tasteful and seasoned perfectly. As the day wore on, it seemed apparent, however that the acoustical hard surfaces of the restaurant created the music and conversations amongst the tables to increase in volume, which slightly disturbed the ambience, but the ears did ease into it after awhile. For the end of the meal I had the chocolate truffles, which melted in the mouth, with the taste that was just perfect for an after dinner dessert. Monetarily, I felt that the price was in the range of just right and slightly above estimate, although the experience in complete combination is most certainly of appropriate intrinsic worth. In summary, decor is only one reason to dine at the renowned Corner Suite Bistro, the food is spectacular the service is fabulous. I would most definitely return to try the other most fascinating menu items."},{"name":"Uncle Nino's","address":"313 Park Ave","city":"Revere","stars":"3.5","text":"Huge Subs!

The service was fine but I do t recommend getting food here as it is highly hit or miss, moreso on the miss. So here's the story, me and my friend came here for a late lunch (2pm) and they close the door at 3pm. We ordered 2 dim sum items (the duck wrapped in tofu sheets and the pan fried pork soup dumplings) 2 regular items (pineapple with deep fried fish and the spare ribs with onions) and a hot and sour soup. The soup was alright, but not your traditional hot and sour soup. The dim sum was where it started to go wrong, we were warned that the dumplings would take 25 minutes to arrive and it ended up being the last item to arrive, not only was it not your traditional style soup dumpling; I don't think I was able to pick one up without them tearing apart. It was as if the cooks got lazy and just left them on a hot plate to cook, the dough was also pretty thick and if you didn't notice the thin crispy flaky skin at the bottom you'd think that this entire dish was one piece stuck together. Next the duck wrapped in tofu skin, not only was the order small (3 pieces), it fell flat in flavour; if it didn't come with hoisin sauce, it literally would have been some duck with green onion wrapped in tofu sheet. The deep fried fish was ok, a bit on the hard/dry side but still palatable. The spare ribs on the other hand were pretty bad, not sure what to think but the meat itself tasted pretty fat, it's not the typical spare ribs you'd think you'd get at a Asian restaurant, it literally feels like it was cooked in a layer of fat. Not sure when my next visit to this restaurant will be but let's hope it's not too soon."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"This place is one of the worst places I've been to in a long time.

When we asked what children's options they had, he couldn't answer. Once established that they didn't have a children's menu, we decided on a short stack of pancakes and bacon PLAIN an order of chicken and waffles with ALL of the condiments on the side. We also ordered champagne service as it was better than ordering individual mimosas. Several minutes passed by and our drinks had not been delivered (30 minutes at this point). When we finally saw the waiter he was delivering appetizers to the table seated next to us, which arrived after us (remember we were the first in the building) we asked where our drinks were, he replied waiting on the bar. In my head I asked myself Ernesto do drink take longer to make than food? I digress 2 minutes after that moment we get our drinks delivered. A flask size orange juice and a bottle of champagne (40 minutes in). Hoorah our food arrives, nope just the child's order of pancakes and bacon with a marmalade and honey no syrup (remember we ordered the short stack for a CHILD). They also didn't explain what the sauces in the ramekins were. After further analysis of the plate of short stack pancakes we discover that they are sitting in a bed of roasted ricotta cheese? ROASTED RICOTTA CHEESE really? Let me explain the taste of roasted ricotta cheese to you, it taste like burnt milk tossed in charcoal. Let's continue, we share this \\"short stack with burnt milk\\" with others at our table and they agree it's utterly disgusting. The pancake had the consistency of flour and dirt. We flag down the waiter and tell him that we need to send it back and get an order of PLAIN waffles, PLAIN!!! Nothing fancy just plain waffles. He seems really confused as this is all going on the rest of the tables food arrives. The faces scattered across the table are of pure disappointment and discontent. We get our waffles and once again, they seem to not know the concept of plain!!! As they arrive with marmalade and ramekins of sauces with no explanation as to what they are. We ask our extremely knowledgeable and attentive waiter what they are, he responds with I'm not sure I'll go ask. At this point we're well past the hour mark of being there. We ask for our checks, not to my surprise the waiter has charged me for all the food we've ordered which they destroyed and a 20% gratuity added to our check. I flag him down once again, I explain to him that I would not be paying for items we sent back and he responds I will take care of it.

And don't worry, for those of y'all with better taste than I, Jack's Pizza has a good (not amazing, but definitely decent) selection of draft and bottled beer.

The crust was on the thin and crispy side, which is something that I usually do not like, but it worked for this particular piece.  Their menu lists a variety of kinds of pizza one can get in individual slices or medium or large pies.  One of my friends got a slice of their \\"soul food\\" pizza ($4.49), which had fried chicken, mashed potatoes, collard greens, and gravy on it.

My friend went with General Gao's Chicken, which we liked less... it just wasn't as tasty as we'd hoped, and I found the breading to be a little heavier than ideal.  \\n\\n Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to order from May's again, although I'd be interested to see what else the Medford/Somerville area has to offer."},{"name":"Oppa Sushi","address":"185 Harvard Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I went to Oppa Sushi for dinner with 4 other friends and the waiter who was serving us was very accommodating.

The bartender (some girl with eyeliner that looked like unsteady pencil lines drawn from her eyes to her hairline) was shockingly rude and had an attitude throughout the entirety of our experience. My boyfriend and I came into MyPlace for the first time to watch a football game tonight. Right when we got into the bar, the bartender kept trying to make us take a seat at a table even though a generous pair of women gave us their seats at the bar. The bartender gave us some serious crap and audibly complained to the server that we had ordered a beer with the server before we sat down and she couldn't transfer the tab over (which was b.s.). She was rude and curt every time she spoke with us. Halfway through our game another patron (a regular, Josh was his name I believe) offered to buy us a round. We were getting ready to leave but we obliged. However by the time we got our check, she had intentionally put his round on our tab. She was obnoxious and went out of her way to act like a snot any time I tried to talk to her. She even gave me some serious crap because I had never heard of Bass Ale (my bad, I like to stick with Mexican beers and American microbrews, geez). I live right down the road and I will NEVER EVER NEVER come back to this HORRIBLE sports bar ever again and I will let everyone I know how horrible the service here was. I thought that maybe the bartender was just having a bad day but she was courteous and friendly with every other patron in the bar (Perhaps because I was the only female - and better-looking one, geez - at the bar? Whatever). I was a server for many years and in all my life I have never not left a tip but this was the closest I ever came to doing so. If I could give this crappy place 0 stars I would. It's a shame because it's so close and convenient and the regulars were extremely friendly and lot's of fun. Heck, even the server was great! The bartender was just shockingly awful.

I've been many times since they opened, both in pairs and groups, and have enjoyed it every time. \\n\\nThe service is great and friendly. The food is definitely striving toward fine dining with a focus on beef, and I think it's a mark they generally hit.  I must admit to being surprised when I ordered the cod and found it to be better made than seafood I've had at seafood restaurants too, though, so definitely don't feel like it's only about the beef! Also I've been here both with a friend who has celiac and a friend who is vegetarian and both were treated with nothing but respect and attentiveness and both received entrees and appetizers they loved.\\n\\nIf you're not a fan of fine dining portion sizes or prices then sit at the bar. The bar menu is lunch-sized portions and skews cheaper. Also the dessert menu isn't written down but if you ask the waiter or bartender for it, you'll find it's around $10 per item and really delicious. (Especially the skillet cookie). \\n\\nI do think their strength is their creative cocktail menu that has some seasonal options as well. They're $10 to $12 each and truly beautiful creations. The Bee's Knees comes with a candied hibiscus flower you can eat at the end of your drink, for instance. Pumpkin Up the Volume is finished with a pumpkin spice dusting through a stencil that looks like a boom box.

It's great that this is an 'outdoor' space (heated tent) even in the colder months, and I liked that it was counter service which meant you could go at your own pace and hang out as long as you wanted. That being said, I wish the seating was a bit comfier and the space a bit cozier; it was basically patio furniture which didn't make you want to hang around for long periods of time, plus there weren't enough chairs and/or tables so when it got crowded there were a lot of people just awkwardly standing over those of us who were seated. Maybe it'll feel better in the summer when the space is open air instead of tented, so we'll see. It'd also be nice for the walkway to the bathroom to be covered/heated (the bathrooms were real thankfully, but that trip was really cold/wet), and the locks to actually function correctly. \\n\\nThe highlight is obviously the beer, which I've been a big fan of for a few years now and it's great I can get it fresh on tap along with a quick low-key snack (the mustard choices for the pretzel were all made with Slumbrew beer, and the Happy Sol one was lick-the-plate good). Haven't tried a brew I didn't like, although my go-to is the Porter Square Porter which is exceptionally good. It'd be cool to see them do unique pilot brews only available here.\\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't hesitate to stop in if I were in the area, and like to see how it feels during the summer when it's a proper beer garden.

It's name is very apt - as it's got a cozy feel to it with all the warm hardwood and brass fixtures.   It would be even better if it was big enough for a fireplace.    Friday nights on Granville can be hit or miss for me - and this was no exception - shortly after I walked in there a large group of VERY young guys walked in and took over the back.  Kudos go to the waitress who was able to manage them just fine despite them being pretty pushy, and a bit obnoxious.   It didn't deter from the service I got - which was excellent - Guinness in hand within 5 minute of sitting down, and she came by often - but not often enough to be pushy.    \\n\\nThe front of the bar had a bunch of people that were likely regulars - and if I came there on any night beyond a Friday/Saturday - I bet I would see a few of the same faces.     \\n\\nOverall - I think Vancouver needs more pubs like this - especially in areas of town not already full of bars - it would be nice to see a place like this as a neighborhood pub."},{"name":"StackHouse Burger Bar","address":"1224 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This place was perfect!  the food was so very, very good and the service super friendly.

The food was pretty good, but the service was completely abysmal. The problem started with the looooong wait be greeted by our waitress after we were seated. I wasn't sure yet what I wanted to drink, so she disappeared again for a long period time. Once we ordered our drinks they took forever to arrive. Seriously, we had already received some of our food (which was ordered after our drinks) by the time our first round of drinks arrived.\\n\\nWe were hoping to linger over a nice, relaxing meal but that wasn't in the cards. While the front of the house was super slow, the kitchen was super fast. It's like the waitstaff was stoned and the kitchen was wired on speed. Why is food coming out quickly a problem? Because we were still working on the mussels when the paella arrived and we still had plates on our table from our first course before the mussels. (Remember the slow service I mentioned?) There was simply no room whatsoever at our table for the paella and we really weren't ready for it. The server who brought out the paella looked at me like I would magically make more space appear at the table. I guess he didn't realize that this was his job. Clueless.\\n\\nI told the server \\"Why don't you set down that paella somewhere and clear some space by taking away these wine glasses and the plates from the first course?\\" He said \\"ok\\" but didn't seem to understand my point... he walked the paella back to the kitchen and never returned to clear the plates. I eventually talked our semi-checked-out waitress into finding some paella for us about 20 minutes later.\\n\\nThe other problem with the service was the weird order in which the food was served. We ordered one appetizer, two hot tapas and a paella. We had assumed that the food would be served in this order. In fact, the two hot tapas were served first and the paella attempt occurred before we were served the appetizer. It was only my refusing to be served the paella so quickly that enabled us to have the appetizer before the paella.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal I considered ordering a port, and I asked our waitress if any of their ports were tawny ports (which I prefer). She had no idea, so she disappeared for a long while and came back much later telling me \\"I figured out which of these is a port.\\" Of course, that wasn't the question. I decided to pass on the port both because I didn't trust her recommendation and because I didn't want to wait 20 minutes for it to arrive.\\n\\nIn short... the food was pretty good but the service was freakishly bad... it was some of the worst restaurant service I've experienced in a long time.\\n\\nOne note about the food... The paella was tasty, but lacking the delicious crusty layer of well cooked rice on the bottom of the pan that really good paella develops as it cooks over the fire. I suspect that our paella didn't cook in the pan in which it was served. That's the best way to develop this super delicious crust. Plus, there wasn't much actual paella in our paella pan... had it developed a nice crust it likely would have been all crust. I understand the need to not go too heavy handed on the seafood... but Barlatta, do you need to be so tight fisted with the rice?\\n\\nIf you want really awesome paella, skip Barlata and take yourself to Fino and order the paella. It's going to cost you $48, but it will feed six people and make the paella from Barlata seem like Rice-a-Roni in comparison.\\n\\nAll that being said... I wanted to like this place. We are going to give Barlata another try somewhere down the road and hope that the problems with the service get worked out in the meantime.\\n\\nIn closing... I'm putting the waitstaff of Austin on notice: in the past I tipped 20% to everyone, with little to no correlation between the service and tip. Those days are over. I'm very happy to still tip 20% at the places they deliver great service (like the aforementioned Uchi, Barleyswine and Oliva plus the less expensive places we frequent like Enoteca, Woodland, 2nd Bar, Fino and Cipollina.)\\n\\nI waited tables when I was younger so I've walked in your shoes. I busted my ass, gave great service and made good tips... you can too.\\n\\nBut if you give me shitty service like we experienced tonight, you can expect to receive a horrible, insulting, not-enough-to-buy-a-latte-at-Starbucks tip."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Was told to go here by a local and extremely glad I did!

How are we suppose to eat with nothing to drink? When she dropped the food off we asked again if she could clear and wipe the table. She cleared it then said she will be back to wipe it. Ten minutes later she comes with drinks but nothing to wipe the table off with. We ate our food on a dirty table then was rushed to close our tab as if we asked for the bill.

We'd seen in other reviews not to be put off by the strip mall location and bowling-alley-like signage, so we weren't. Although it would surely be a concern to me if I was the owner, the signage in particular. That aside, we were pleasantly surprised at the interior ambience. Clean, quiet, cozy and classic. Our server was welcoming and pleasant, and overall, the meal was very good. We started with the calamari appetizer. Generous portion, nicely fried to golden. The red sauce and garlic butter sauces were nice, but we'd have liked a sweet option as well. Calamari was tasty, but we both thought it could have used a good deal less salt. We try calamari everywhere we go and this would rate above average, but not great. For entrees, my wife ordered lasagna, and I got the pollo cattiatori. Both dishes were very good, with mine standing out as especially strong. Very fresh, an explosion of organic flavors of green pepper and mushroom, along with the wine added to the sauce. It included two very tender breaded chicken breasts. I've never tried cattiatori before, so have no others to compare this with, but I will say I've become an immediate fan of the style based on this sample! Our server was very attentive to the status of our iced teas as well. Minor note: the entrees were very slow to arrive, and the restaurant was not crazy busy. We assume the time was due to fresh and careful presentation, so it wasn't an irritant, just a good to know, and actually was encouraging to know that the details weren't being rushed.

I hope they fix it, because it's otherwise very good for a traditional tzatziki. \\n\\nService was quite slow.   They didn't seem very busy for their staffing, with maybe a half-dozen tables seated, and a couple people at the bar.  There were 3 servers, a hostess, someone working the bar, the two owners and at least two people I saw surface from the back, out of the kitchen.   It took 10 minutes to initially get our server to take our drink order, another 15 minutes to take food order.   Appetizer came out in 15 minutes followed by our entrees almost 30 minutes after that.

They're outside of the establishment, which is OK since most of the seating is outside as well.  But, in order to use them, you have to go inside to get a code first, which can be a unnecessary delay if there's a line.  I understand why they do this, with the number of runners, rowers, and vagrants in the area, but it's just a little hassle.

It was bad enough that I had become  lost getting off of a previous exit and not ever finding the McDonald's. I drove a half hour out of my way and finally ended up at the Sunberry McDonald's. I ordered my large sweet tea with 3 lemons in the drive through window. When I got up to the second window to receive my tea she said \\"wait one minute. I am putting in your lemons. I took a quick drink while waiting on change and quickly told the young snippy blonde that something tastes off about the tea. I asked her was the  tea fresh? She became indignant and was very put out that I asked.  I said I don't know what is wrong with it but I'm telling you that something tastes funny about this tea like it's starting to turn bad. She said, \\"Well, I did exactly as you told me to do and put the three lemons in your tea. Sorry about that.\\" I looked at her in disbelief that this  was her answer, with her snotty little attitude. She never offered to take the drink back, or exchange it. She just glared at me and I just ended up driving off extremely thirsty and very frustrated. I drank  one more drink just to make sure it wasn't my imagination. Yes indeed it was awful. Furthermore it did not taste like lemon. I open the lid  and there was no lemons.  I wondered if maybe the lemons were at the very bottom of the glass so I stirred the glass. I pulled over to the side of the road because by now I'm really getting angry. I knew it wasn't going to drink anymore tea so I put my head to the bottom of the glass just to see if there was three lemons at the bottom. No lemons.  I'm not saying people can't forget things. It happens all the time. But she went to great efforts  to explain to me that she would be a minute because she was putting the three lemons in my tea. Then explained after the fact when I complained,  \\" I did exactly as you asked me to do and put three lemons in your tea.\\" She deliberately lied. She did not forget. She lied before and after.  Why lie ? So when I pulled over to the side the road with my hand dripping with nasty tea.  I tried to call the McDonald's. No answer. No answering machine. I tried for the next two hours. I'm still trying to call them. No answer. No answering machine. I went and looked at all the other reviews and realized that I am in a long line of dissatisfied customers. When you become angry enough that you have to stop along the road to call and to write a bad review about a McDonald's you're visiting while traveling through, I guess that speaks to how badly their restaurant is.    I'm guessing that the restaurant manager will never read these yelp reviews.

A lot of sushi restaurants don't give much thought to presentation, especially those on a lower price point, but this is where The One stands out.

My favorite drink is something extra peculiar drink called \\"Beehive\\" that has a little buzz flower inside of it. My server told me the way to drink this is to take a small bite out of the buzz flower before taking a sip- it gives a tingly feeling and it is so delicious and strange at the same time. Haven't had anything like this before. \\n\\nI typically start my meal off with the Yellowtail Shots- which is my favorite item on the menu! Each shot includes a piece of yellowtail, a small sliver of jalapeno, a drop of sriracha and ponzu sauce. It comes delivered on a tray with six shot glasses that have rounded bottoms, so every shot is placed differently. Sweet, savory and spicy. Then I switch to the Chanel Replica Roll which is a tuna + scallop roll that is served with a sweet soy chili sauce (I also add spicy mayo, which really ties it together and gives a good blend of creamy sweet). Sometimes I forget to add the spicy mayo, and those are the times they ironically decide to add it in there with sriracha on the side as presentation! I accompany this with the Smoked Toro- it includes five pieces and is very competitively priced (I think the last time I purchased it, it was $25 which is a total steal). The Smoked Toro is delivered to the table under a bowl that is infused with smoke which adds a hickory flavor to the Toro mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES.

Typical kimchi flavors but the crisp apple made the dish pretty much the best kimchi I have ever tasted and I found it to be very creative. The cauliflower was similarly delicious and perfectly spiced with an incredible tahini gravy. Now for the kale, I know I'm going to be an outlier here but I just found it to be a little too much. Too much flavor (is that a thing)? I just felt that the fish sauce was well intended but slightly overwhelming and to be honesty, I was a little disappointed after they hype. Spicy noodles...nothing much to say...little bland and boring. Chicken ramen was pretty similar to the kale in that the broth was completely overwhelming and salty. \\n\\nAs for the dessert? Incredible, absolutely delicious and perfectly spiced with the curry accent. \\n\\nTake aways: Try for yourself. I thought it had great potential and maybe I just hit it on an off night.

I was witness to this as the group was ordering a round of shots, and she completely ignored a few people at the table... rather than be left out of the merriment, one person when running after her to add on the drinks. In addition to that, they didn't have a few of the liquors requested... and she took FOR-EV-ER to come around to the table with the drinks after they had been ordered! In that amount of time, I could have walked down a few blocks, asked a drunken bum where he gets his booze, walked around the liquor store, found the booze I wanted, got ID'd, bought it, walked my happy ass back to the bar, and poured a shot into everyone's mouth. Apparently, this slow service was going on throughout the entire night. Needless to say after this last round of shots, we bolted and went somewhere else.\\n\\nThis was my first time here in the dining area... the one other time I'd been here was also for a brief moment while I was Christmas party hopping but I just came in for a single drink - then bounced.

After growing up in NY/NJ and spending a couple years in SoCal, I have come to the realization that California may be great at many things, but pizza is not it. Stick to the tacos. I only went in because it looked neat and it is incredibly close to home. I went in with my expectations still sitting in the car. \\n\\nI waited a few days for the crowds to settle down and made my first of two visits at 10pm (2nd visit was at 1215am). There was no line and about four crew members eager to assist. As others have described, this is a subway style pizza joint. Just go down the line and add what you want. They offer up a few menu options if you can't make up your own mind. All pizzas are $10, with the exception of basic cheese, which is $8. I have now tried both the pink and red sauce and have been happy with both. The ingredients list is more extensive than one would imagine. They offer several cheeses, including fresh mozz, feta, smoked gouda, gorgonzola. Toppings include about every meat under the sun as well as some \\"premium\\" greens like artichokes, red peppers, caramelized onions. You can literally make a million combinations, depending on your mood. \\n\\nAfter you choose your toppings, it goes int he Quizno's oven for a quick bake. I'd say it takes about 5 minutes to cook. This leads you to the register, where you can find about 20 craft beers on tap, including about 20% from SoCal, which made my heart happy. I have had both my Ballast and  Green Flash fix this week. Beers run anywhere from about $5-7, and they were running a \\"blue star\\" special last night, where random beers were $5 (my Green Flash passion fruit). \\n\\nThe service has been top notch, and what you would expect from a place that takes care of its team. Everyone was engaging and eager to educate customers on the place. The restaurant was clean, with someone always running around cleaning. The pizza was very good. It was not NY, Chicago or anything gourmet. It is a basic crust with whatever you want...quality. \\n\\nAfter two visits in three days, I am having to give this place an honest five stars. It has done nothing to warrant less. It has only exceeded my expectations and has me wanting to go back for both more beer and pizza. The fact that they are open until 1am daily is pretty damn amazing.

I happened to also have the previous 4 days off as well but it was the first full day that my darling wife was back in town after nearly a fortnight away. Unsure of how many other folks get the day off as well, we thought it was possibly a good day to get us some breakfast and not have to wait interminably for a table. We were mostly right.\\n\\nThere wasn't a table available (the indoor dining area is rather small) so we sat in a table in the covered patio area. We could have just sat there but my wife is more sensitive to cold than I and I'm not sure if all of their heaters were working. I did notice that breakfasters that did choose to sit outside were offered blankets, which is pretty effin' thoughtful. The folks ahead of us were seated in fairly short order and, in the meanwhile, we helped ourselves to the self-serve coffee (hot and delish). The staff kept us up to date about the status of our table, which only took maybe 10 minutes to be made available. We were initially offered a portion of the community table, which we took, but when a corner table became free a few minutes later, our waitress offered it to us and we took it. Again, very thoughtful!\\n\\nThe reason we drove out from SE to Alberta was to get some grits, which my wife was craving. We both had the standard two egg brekkie; hers with grits, mine with potato cakes. Both were quite good. I need to realize that even though I like my eggs over medium, I think you get MORE when you order scrambled. I don't know if any laws of physics are being broken to account for this increase in mass but I kind of think it's just harder to keep track  of the amount of the scrambleds when cooking. The bacon was well cooked and high quality. However, it was not the best bacon I've ever had. I like it when it is crispy and tender, yet a little juicy when you bite into it. This was more meaty than that. Still good, though.\\n\\nThe corner table was a little hard to manoever in and out of and I don't know how the folks on the inside of the community table get out to refill their coffee so the space is slightly awkward but serviceable. It's cozy when you sit down. I was very happy with the service and consideration we were shown. Top marks for that.\\n\\nIt was a nice (yet selfish) way to spend Veterans' Day. I'm thankful for the sacrifices that our military members make and have made for us to enjoy life's little luxuries, like breakfast out on a cool autumn morning in a city that embraces freedom so eagerly."},{"name":"Corner Bakery Cafe","address":"19325 NW Emma Way","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"3.5","text":"This morning was my Fourth time eating here.

Being a stout and porter lover I have high expectations. This Hotbox Coffee was outstanding with rich coffee notes and a clean, almost sweet finish! We received quick and tentative service with drinks on the table within minutes. Only passing through for a beer, we didn't order any food but the menu looked pretty tasty. I did however eat at the Lyons location where everything ordered was excellent. Pearl St. parking can be a tough but you can use one of the local parking garages, or find a side street a few blocks away and walk there. Four stars because they don't offer Gluten Free Beers. Overall we had a great experience, and I'm telling you to put this place on your list for must try breweries in the Boulder area!"},{"name":"Hot Pot Buffet","address":"70 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I visited this place twice. The first visit was OK, second visit I left horrified. I honestly don't remember what it was about the first visit that had me coming back, but after my recent visit, I am NEVER coming back here again! The food was not at all fresh, beef came out frozen, corn was hard, and my fish paste had worms in it! I unfortunately did not realized it until after the fact that it had been cooked because a friend of mine had place the fish paste into the broth before inspecting it. First of all, why would my \\"fish paste\\" have vain in it?! If you don't believe me, look at the picture and be the judge. You can even Google image \\"worm in fish,\\" compare it to mine and I can assure you it's identical.\\n\\nThey should thank god that it was cooked thoroughly before I had ingested it or else I could have have sued the place, quit school, have their establishment shut down and I would be set for life. How unfortunate for me though. I don't get what it is about this place that people love so much, it's not even fresh.\\n\\nEdit: Thank you all for the clarifications of this \\"black moss.\\" I did happen to Google it after follow up reviews and yes, there was a huge difference. The fish balls were covered with black moss unlike my fish paste having just a few strands, this was actually my second order of fish paste and the first batch had absolutely no \\"black moss\\" in them so don't tell me they went cheap and cut back the moss in this delicacy. We also definitely did not order no \\"black moss\\" from the menu, unless they reused their food on other customers, which seems to be the case in most written reviews anyways, that's definitely another reason to stay away.\\n\\nIt's quite funny though how people would go out of their way to create a yelp account to write five stars reviews to balance out the bad ones.

Given this, it takes exceptionally high marks to rate a location the best bubble tea I've ever had.\\n\\nBoston Tea Stop earns those marks.\\n\\nThe small cafe uses two tea bases: a black and either a jasmine (which is often predominantly green but can have white or black) or a green.  They have approximately 24 tea flavors one can mix and match; see uploaded picture for flavors!  Their teas can be ordered hot or cold, with or without milk/cream, and have additional styles that involve ice (with or without milk/cream) that have cute names like 'snow'.  They have boba, of course -- but they also have lychee jelly, and often other treats like mango 'stars' or strawberry 'hearts' for shorter spans of time.  Try them while supplies last!\\n\\nThey often have mochi, ranging up to about 12 different flavors, but will occasionally sell out.  Three packs of these awesome summer snacks can be purchased for a discount price.  (NOTE: To ensure the mochi maintains its structural integrity, their freezers are kept pretty cold, meaning that you may have to wait a couple minutes before the mochi is soft enough to eat in an air conditioned environment.)\\n\\nSome other things to note:\\n- Boston Tea Stop is /cheaper than most local bubble tea stores and chains/, including Kung Fu Tea.  As the shop is owned by a local businessman, I'd strongly suggest buying local.\\n- Boston Tea Stop has WiFi!  Useful if you're camping out for a while.\\n- As a counterpoint, the store is small, and does not have a public restroom.\\n- Contrary to what their outside decor may still say, they no longer carry dumplings, sadly.  They didn't seem to be as popular when they were carried.\\n\\nBy far, the best bubble tea I've had: in New England, in Chicago, in Philadelphia, and in (what locations I've gone to) in California.

I was in the mood for carne asada, so I yelped \\"best carne asada\\" and Gabriela's popped up. It was a hit!!  The drink special was their half-priced House Margarita, which came in at $4 each. We were both PLEASANTLY surprised!  He had frozen. I had on the rocks and both with salt. They came in double-old fashioned glasses. All I needed was one. They were very tasty and effective!  We ordered guacamole, which came with homemade tortilla chips, and shrimp ceviche', which came with crackers and a large fried tortilla. We made great choices on those, too. I got the tacos carne asada, which came on soft corn tortillas. You get two. They were topped with caramelized onions and side of pickled red onion, charro beans and rice. My husband ordered the tacos pastor and had all the same sides as I did. I think guacamole came on the tacos, too.

Oysters were fresh and a good deal. Service was much better than Rodney's. Ambience was a little loud for my taste (yes, I get the loud music makes the place a little more hip/trendy) which made talking a little difficult (my poor throat!) but I suppose a good place for after work drinks with a group of friends. The Seafood Pan Roast was nothing that I expected - it came out looking like butter chicken on rice except instead of chicken, it had seafood. I found the dish a little creamy and bland. No, it wasn't spicy like butter chicken but it wasn't flavourful either. Yes, I am a fan of seafood and enjoyed the 3 scallops and lobster but I feel there is definitely room for improvement for this dish.

The waiters are all older men with Italian or NY accents - and yes, they look like mafia but more importantly, the service here is GREAT! I've eaten here many times and tonight, introduced 5 more friends to Alfredo's. The place was packed when we got here (around 8:30) - so make reservations! \\n\\nMy friends loved the garlic bread (the smell alone is delicious) & the pickled vegetables. For appetizers, I ordered the mixed greens salad which was disappointing b/c they use iceberg lettuce (vs. the mixed greens described in the menu). 3 people ordered the minestrone soup which was perfect for tonight's cold weather - they loved it. I tried a bite and it did taste good. But the best appetizer was the caprese salad. 2 people ordered it and the rest of us sampled. We all agreed that had to be the best mozzarella we had ever eaten. Next time I will definitely order it - a great appetizer for 2 people to share. \\n\\nFor entrees, I got the Padrino which is the veal sampler - veal marsala, veal francese, & veal parmesan. It also comes with a side of pasta or vegetables - I chose pasta. My favorite among the three was the veal francese. I love veal but I don't think I would get the Padrino again. One friend got the eggplant parmesan - if you love eggplant, this is the dish to get. It really was very good. Two people got the linguini with clam sauce (another favorite of mine) -- the person who got the white sauce liked hers, but the person who got the red sauce thought the clams tasted too fishy (it did). Another person got the spicy penne - it was just ok. Another favorite of mine but no one ordered is the salmon penne in vodka sauce. \\n\\nFor dessert, we got the ricotta cheesecake (light & delicious - and doesn't taste like your ordinary cheesecake) & the tiramisu (just ok to me). By now, we were stuffed - and satisfied. Everyone seemed to be very pleased with the dinner experience and some said they'd come back with their spouses. Server was really great - and nice enough to let us do separate checks.

I was not disappointed.\\n\\nWe were greeted immediately, and the staff were all super-friendly and willing to answer questions. The space is nice, fairly open with a few muted/captioned flatscreen TVs and some upbeat, Top 40-ish tunes in the background. There's a load of sleek, modern seating available. The place was a bit more empty than I thought it would be for 7pm on a Saturday, but as we had our meal, more and more people streamed in.\\n\\nLuckily for me, Waffold was still celebrating National Waffle Day, which meant that with whichever sandwich I ordered, I'd get a free dessert waffle as well. My main dish was the Lox Cream Cheese ($7.95); delicious and cool and really well prepared. The waffle was perfectly crisp and browned, and the salmon/cream cheese/cucumber/chives combo really hit the spot. My free dessert was the Nutella & Banana Sandwich ($5.95 that I saved there), which I urge everyone to go try *immediately*. I'm already craving another one.\\n\\nMy only complaint would be that my dessert was brought out at the same time as my main dish, so the dessert had gotten a little lukewarm by the time I'd finished my first sandwich. I'm not sure if this was because everyone was getting a free dessert that day, and that was just how they were taking care of it for convenience. Of course, you can always ask to have your dessert brought out a bit later -- the friend I brought with me did, and the staff were happy to comply.\\n\\nOverall, it was a buck or two more than I would regularly pay for a single sandwich -- but I have to be honest, it was an *excellent* sandwich with a cool novelty twist. I definitely recommend hitting this place up at least once, as it's a perfect-sized meal if you're looking for something quality than won't make you uncomfortably full.

I could easily go 2 stars, but I'm cutting Main Event some slack here because it was only one visit, and an employee commented to my wife that they hadn't had a crowd anywhere near that size on a Sunday since they'd opened. But a large part of it seemed to be a church group that I'd guess was around 100 people - I'm sure that group didn't show up unannounced, but ME seemed very unprepared. \\nMy first reaction upon walking in was, \\"Wow, this place is way better than Dave & Busters.\\" And it some ways, it was, some it wasn't. \\nOverall, we spent roughly 90 minutes in line waiting to pay for bowling, laser tag, the gravity ropes, and to get \\"prizes\\" (3 separate lines). Granted, this was somewhat mitigated by the fact that we had 1 adult wait, while the other went with the kids to play games, but that much time waiting in line is unacceptable. \\nThe place is pretty poorly organized, and generally inefficient, and most of the employees seemed disinterested and generally unhappy to be there (we did have a good server in the bowling alley...once we got a server to come by, which took 25 minutes. \\nAs for games, most of them seem pretty lame (virtual jump rope? Seriously? People pay for that? Oh yeah, my 9 year old niece got about 15 seconds of \\"fun\\" from it). I don't get arcade games these days - most have great graphics, but aren't any more fun than arcade games of 20 years ago. They have several varieties of game where zombies or the like slowly walk towards you as you shoot them. Yawn. Most games seemed to be $1.50 per play (which for kids is often less than a minute). Cheapest games were $1.00, some were $1.25. I'd much rather pay $0.50 for old school arcade games! \\n\\nOn to some positives \\n-We enjoyed the laser tag - my nephew commented that it was \\"too short\\" (I think the sessions are about 10 minutes once you take out the \\"training\\" video and getting set up with the vests). I thought the duration was fine. The \\"arena\\" set-up seemed really good (but I haven't played laser tag in probably 20 years). \\n-I also liked the bowling alley set-up - a bunch of giant TVs at the end of the lanes. Seems like a great place to watch a sporting event while bowling. \\n-Gravity ropes - I didn't do this myself (I assumed I was too big, but later saw it surprisingly has a 300 lb weight limit - I'm wayyyy within range =), but it seemed pretty cool...although beware that a lot of kids seemed to get scared up there and freeze or come right back down (including my nephew). The session my niece and nephew were in had way too many kids under 10 or so in it, and it was a complete mess. \\n-Food was about what I'd expect. Not terrible, not great. Didn't try the pizza, but it looked better than I would have expected in a place like this. \\n-Lots of pool tables that looked to be in pretty good shape (we didn't play pool though). \\n\\nBeware that things get expensive really fast (definitely get the passes if you they make sense). Bowling is pretty expensive (wifey paid so I didn't see the final tally), but I think it was over $50 for 2 adults and 2 kids for 90 minutes, as are the video games. Including dinner, we dropped almost $250 in about 4.5 hours with 2 adults and 2 kids, and with 2 or 3 exceptions, only the kids playing video games."},{"name":"Boston Tea Stop","address":"54 Jfk St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Amazing!

It does not disappoint. I had the Newport Grog, which was an absolutely perfect cocktail. It was a bit sweet, a sour, and a bit herbaceous. As appetizers (actually from the pub fare section of the menu) we had the gruyere biscuits and the tacos, both of which were excellent.  The tacos were loaded with tempura rock shrimp and a delicious avocado/lime sauce as well as a slaw. For main courses we shared the steak frites and the pork porterhouse. The steak frites were quite good, but not amazing. I've certainly had better. The truffle fries are nice and we enjoyed them, but they were not the kind of fries I typically expect with steak frites. The steak was good, but again, not my favorite. the pork porterhouse, though, was phenomenal. It is a huge portion. SO much so that we took some home wiht us, but we look forward to having it for breakfast. The side with the pork porterhouse, white fife, is sort of like israeli couscous, and delicious. I couldn't get enough. For dessert, we enjoyed the crepes, but I saw someone else's custard at another table and wish I had tried that dish too. It looked excellent. \\n\\nMy one real complaint was with regard to seating. We arrived promptly at 8:30pm, but our table wasn't ready for another 15 minutes.

I thought I was going to kill a waiter when he went to clear my cutlery after my boyfriend finished eating and I had not even received my meal. I almost ate his arm, curiously it might have been better then the food? I clearly am an undiagnosed hypoglycemic. Another note, I am not the type of person that enjoys being consoled by the waiter through them touching you, especially while you are sitting with your boyfriend. If I wanted a back rub, do you really suppose I would come into Chewies to get one? If so please state it as an extra charge or side dish. There is a very weird space for women created by men when they unnecessarily touch you, if the woman says anything they are assumed to be a bitch, curiously the man is not a creep? So is it unjust to call my waiter a creep? Or was I just starving? If it was like a pat on the shoulder suggesting to \\"hang in there\\" like those lovely cat posters that suggest to maintain motivation, then it would be okay, but there comes a point where you touch a person too much whilst serving them and then fuck up there food order that perhaps the honest reciprocation would be to punch said waiter in the balls.  \\n\\nI agree with many of the negative comments about Chewies, if you are a foodie, enjoy the atmosphere of being by the beach, at what cost should they come?

I almost always order extra cheese, and I'm super glad I resisted this time.  It's a tasty, high quality mozzarella and they give you a *ton* of it, which made my day.  The only thing they could do to make it better would be to get the crust a bit more cooked and crispy.  The crust had an extremely chewy, undercooked texture.  The pizza is a bit big for one person, but not enough on it's own for 2 hungry people.  Though there are enough other small items that it's easy to share.

I'd always heard great things about it, so I didn't hesitate when my friend suggested it. The happy hour menu has a good selection and decent prices. And during the week, happy hour is from 5-11pm.\\n\\nBut the food was mediocre at best. My asparagus risotto was mealy, and there was very little asparagus in it. And it was completely devoid of any seasoning. We had to ask a nearby table for salt and pepper (and I almost NEVER salt my food). \\n\\nMy friend's mac and cheese had slightly more flavor, but we both wondered whether they made it with Velveeta or Cheese Wiz. It was unnaturally orange for mac and cheese that didn't come out of a box. \\n\\nThe house bread was boring and tasted old. Dipping it in olive oil and  vinegar didn't help. \\n\\nThe only thing that was decent was the carpaccio. Unfortunately we didn't really get the time to enjoy our appetizers as they brought out our entrees immediately after serving the apps. \\n\\nThe service was good, but I definitely won't be returning to Bastas."},{"name":"Bunk","address":"211 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The downtown location is perfect for an early afternoon lunch. The place itself is tiny, and parking is usually a pain so we always order to-go. Unfortunately, there are often issues with the phone system/voicemail that they have set up and sometimes we cannot get through to order! \\n\\nThat aside, I'm hopelessly addicted to the pork belly cubano. I really haven't had much desire to try any other new sandwiches because I love this one so much! The bread is perfectly grilled and crunchy, perfect proportions of tangy ham, creamy, fatty pork belly, melty swiss, thin slices of pickles and just enough mustard. I really could live on cubans, except \\"living\\" is the operative word here. I have also tried the roast beef, and it was great. The simple bag of kettle chips is perfect. As long as they have the pork belly cubano on the menu, they'll be in business!\\n\\nConsidering we're always ordering to go - I would say don't try to order too far past 2:30 pm, since they close at 3. Every time we've tried to order too close to 3, we've been shut down. Which is such a bummer - and don't get me wrong, we're not placing orders if we don't think we could be there before 3 pm.\\n\\nI really think the staff on the phone could be a little nicer as well - it almost feels like we're inconveniencing them sometimes. I assume that the size of their location makes them a perfect take-out spot, so it's not anything out of the ordinary. Since we're spending money at their establishment, I really hope they appreciate that and consider customer service and not just sling out sandwiches when it's convenient for them. \\n\\nThe quality of their sandwiches will keep me coming back, and my 4 star rating is specifically for the food. I would probably knock them down a peg if I actually ate in house and had the same poor service in person."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"2875 SE Powell Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"2","text":"Moment of weakness...

Granted it was a Saturday night and we knew it would be busy, but even so the staff was not super friendly and there was a 1 n a half to 2 hour wait to bowl at midnight. Why would you even wait when they close at 2?! And to pay over 30 dollars?! They do have other things to entertain yourself, but we were kind of set on bowling. Theres games, laser tag, pool tables, and a ropes course. The bathrooms were also disgusting. I know thats a long day with lots of people in and out, but they should  consider cleaning in the middle of their rushes because I am no germaphobe and could not deal.

It took a long time to get our food and I saw my server about 2 times the 3 1/2 hours we were there, but that was not the issue. We ordered our food, but asked the waiter to come back to see if we could put in an extra order of fries. He said the kitchen was really busy, but he would try because he didn't want us to get them late. We said that was fair. We sat right by the kitchen. Apparently, one of employees in the staff was irritated by our order so she turned around, faced us, and yelled at us for trying to put an extra order in. At this point WE ARE HOT!! We didn't say anything. We ate our food and decided we would ask for the manager after we finish dinner. The entire time the kitchen staff is yelling at each other, loud, the manager was yelling at them. It was extremely unprofessional and disturbed our dinner the entire time. We finished eating and asked to speak with the manager about 3 times. After about 20 minutes and her not showing up we asked what the ETA of her coming over would be. We were told she asked what we wanted and that she probably wouldn't come. She then walked past us to go on break and never acknowledged us. I then after called corporate to complain and I was assured that they would call me back, but they never did. I initially said I would never go back to this location, even if somebody paid me to eat there. However, it seems the lack of communication and following up goes all the way to corporate.

So let me break it down for you:\\n\\nRaw fried buns: crispy on the outside, juicy and soupy on the inside. Also nice and large, 6 for $7.99.\\n\\nBeef noodle soup, $9.99: I rarely have good beef noodle nowadays, even at Taiwanese restaurants, but this one is very good. The beef/tendon one is even better, but I don't eat tendon, so usually opt for the beef only.\\n\\nRed oil wontons, $7.99: 12 pieces, small and flat, with peanut and hot sauce on top, sprinkled with crushed peanuts. Yum!\\n\\nSalty soy milk, $4.99: Thick, pieces of fried Chinese donut inside, and pickled veggies. We opt for hot oil on the side so we can control the spice.\\n\\nI have also tried their stir fried rice cakes with pickled vegetables and edammame, and the fried fish wrapped in seaweed. These are not bad. I would probably not get the mushroom wraps, which were just ok, and their xiao long bao are average, so I never get them here.\\n\\nI do find this place to be a bit more expensive than similar places.

My order of steak frites was quite tasty and the black Angus steak was cooked to perfection. The truffle fries were also delicious, albeit very salty. The tarragon aioli was just okay. My companion ordered a grouper dish that included an orzo mac-and-cheese base; this could easily be the best dish on their menu. It was absolutely flawless. \\n\\nAlso noteworthy are the RP's Gruyere biscuits. Again, rather salty, but they are downright sinful, with a meat-infused (bacon?) flavor that is divine. \\n\\nI have to disagree with the several Yelpers that didn't care for the service: the valet was efficient, the hostesses were friendly, and our server was fantastic. She was very attentive without smothering. \\n\\nWhere RP loses a point or two is in value for the money. I was disappointed that my steak came ONLY with the fries ... no veggies anywhere on the plate. I don't mind paying a bit extra for quality food (which this obviously is), but it would be nice to have more than two flavors on the plate. \\n\\nThe Ravenous Pig stands out in the Winter Park dining scene, which is sadly lacking outside the Park Avenue area and Houston's.

Then, had the (mis?) fortune to pick up a friend at PDX at the ungodly hour of 7:22am on a Saturday. Brilliant idea: we headed straight to Tin Shed and walked right in the door. What a sweet place! It was like having breakfast in a friend's cute backyard and your friend is an excellent host AND an excellent cook AND loves both your child and your dog AND has a blanky ready for you if you feel a draft. Our waitress was lovely and took the time to have a pleasant conversation with the small child at the table and bring her a special no-spill sippy cup for juice (love it). I was apparently the first person of the day to order the daily breakfast special, which was a Portobello mushroom red pepper brie scramble of some sort, and everyone was very concerned about my feedback. No worries - it was yummy, as was the accompanying biscuit and potato cakes.

In the end, the creamiest and tastiest to me is still the plain lotus seed paste (and if I'm in the mood for it, the black bean has a coarseness to it that can also be pleasant), but it's nice to be able to buy pumpkin and green tea, and even nicer that they sell mini mooncakes.  They even carry shanghai style mooncakes, which have less sweet fillings and a flaky pastry crust.\\n\\nOf course it carries products rich with cheese and dairy that you may not find in chinatown, like creme caramel cake, cheese tarts and cream puffs, but even in the regular buns, there is a pretty stark separation from Yi Soon and the chinatown bakeries, which are largely the same.  Both have soft bread dough, but Yi Soon's has more butter, which makes it more brioche-y, and much more fragrant.  Right when you open the individually packaged buns, you will be struck with the incredibly strong smell of condensed milk and butter.  This is definitely different from the relatively plain bread doughs in the chinatown buns, and I usually prefer Yi Soon's, but sometimes I find myself really enjoying the more standard bread.  The added flavor in the dough does put the coconut bun above anything I've had in Chinatown.  Just wow."},{"name":"Papa Murphy's","address":"2004 N Rosa Parks Way","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"They make it, you bake it.

I was excited to hear that such an arty-type cafe had opened in Lynn. I've lived in Lynn for the majority of my life and I NEVER, ever hang out in Lynn because there's really nowhere  to hang out that's not filled with complete, ugh, I don't even have words for them. \\n\\nAnyway, a friend of mine said he was playing a show here and I assumed he meant the one in Salem, so I was confused. I hadn't a clue about the Lynn locale. So I decided to check out the place beforehand and see what it was like. \\n\\nI popped in just to check it out and order some coffee and a panini to go. Very cute place, simple, cozy and overall nicely decorated. It had a good feel to it. The latte I got was delightful and the sandwich I ordered was simply orgasmic. Also, the beer and wine list was pretty decent, even though I didn't order from it since I was on my lunch break. =(\\n\\nThe problem was the service, or complete lack there of. There were two people working and both of them looked like they wished they were anywhere else but there. When I ordered my sandwich, the guy who made it acted like I has asked him to whip me up a medium-rare beef tenderloin with gorgonzola butter and a balsamic reduction. I just wanted a bunch of crap slapped between two pieces of ciabatta. I was afraid to order my coffee from the girl, but my thirst got the best of me. She made it silently and plopped it in front of me, promptly walking away and leaving the room. The guy, in the same fashion, flopped the meal down in front of me and walked away, leaving the room. I then stood there like an a**hole waiting for ONE OF THEM to come back so I could pay. I know for a fact that I could have walked out of there without paying and I don't think they would have realized it for a good hour or so. Eventually they both came back to the front area where they stood with their backs turned to the counter, not able to see me. Now, had I not had partial laryngitis I'd have happily and loudly said excuse me, but luckily a friend of the girl's was there and eventually got her attention to me. She looked at me dumbfounded and I said \\"Can I pay someone??\\" She slumped over and with no conversation involved, rang me up. I left there feeling like I had really inconvenienced them, like it was there private home and I burst in, held them hostage and forced them to make me lunch. Force a friggin' smile. It's a nice place with a relaxed dcor. The service does NOT reflect the type of place you expect it to be when you walk in. \\n\\nSo, I'll go back again to see my friend play, but I'll be afraid to order anything because I'd hate to see how disgruntled they get when there's more than 3 bodies in there."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Really cool patio with a great happy hour.\\n\\nI had the pulled pork on a biscuit which was delicious.

I did the obvious thing anyone in stress would do - I went looking for something sugary to eat - I know, not a wise or healthy habit. One of the Boar-Head sandwich shop was selling slices of cakes for about $4 and I chose red velvet flavor. I gobbled it up pretty fast and I thought it was one of the best red velvet cake I have ever tried. The label said it was made by 'Piece of cake'! Until that point, I have not heard of 'Piece of cake' at all! And on my trip back to Atlanta, I picked a slice for my partner and he loved it too!\\n\\nI admit, other than occasional sugar craving, I'm usually not into heavy cakes - I usually prefer fluffier Asian cakes with fresh cream icing but the cream cheese icing at Piece of cake is the only exception so far. So recently, for a birthday, when it was my turn to pick a cake, I went to piece of cake at buckhead location. It was located in a cute little cottage sized building. All the cakes available that day was written on chalk board. If you didn't preorder it, 9 inch cakes are the only ones you can buy. They also have 7 inch cakes and some cakes available in sheets as well, for about the same price as 9 inch cakes - pretty good deal. But you have to preorder. It's $37 for 9 inch cake, by the way. \\n\\nSo we couldn't quiet make up our mind on whether to pick 'red velvet' or 'Cookies n creme'. The staff at the store gave us a cupcake each on both flavors and we decided to go with cookies n creme. The cakes here doesn't have fancy look like ones you buy at french or Asian bakeries. \\n\\nAlso a tip, leave it at room temperature at least for an hour before cutting a cake - it gets harder to cut when chilled and I find it tastier when it's not hard. \\n\\nAs for the taste, everyone liked the cake but how much you can eat their cake depends on whether you have sweet tooth or not. Lets face, there is no way around this, the cake is denser and heavier than French/Asian cakes and is made with pure sugar and butter. Most of my friends had a full slice while others just had a sliver. But everyone agreed that it was quite tasty. Keeping this in mind while picking your cake will avoid any disappoitments."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Decent breakfast and service.

Everybody raves about Dona sauce, but you can get a similar sauce at several places around town with better tacos.

They are so slow when it's busy I wanted to go behind the counter and do it myself last time I was there.  Assist them with the lack of efficiency and focus I was witnessing.  Maybe it was the annoyingly grating canned pop music affecting their brains, because It was affecting mine!  Not to mention that as I stood there waiting for my smoothie, assuming it was coming out of the fumbling around back there...I realized they made the 3 juices the man behind me ordered first.  He was out the door with his kids, only for me to then be told they were out of the main ingredient.  I had literally been standing there for over ten minutes by now (was aware of time, not exaggerating), as I had thought to pop in for a smoothie before I needed to be somewhere...watching three people fumble over each other behind the counter, and mine wasn't even started yet!  So we improvised something, but I was treated a bit condescendingly at the idea of wanting some vegan protein added (because I'm dairy intolerant), as the guy smirked that I 'eat this stuff.'  Another woman right behind me earlier on this same visit had walked out, because she called in an order for two juices and they didn't even have them started. While she stood there incredulously wondering what on earth was going on back there as we stood there waiting at length.  When she said something to me, the staff exchanged blatant looks of annoyance amongst themselves.  I got an accusing 'dirty look' when I nodded in agreement.  This is before man wanting 3 juices even walked in.  If you call this place and they don't pick up, the message will tell you that they are too busy to take phone orders at the moment, not even apologetically...that's just bad business in my opinion because it  only adds to the air of condescension you get when you walk in there...especially since another time I was in this place, I was the only customer there with something being made at the moment, yet the staff was milling about doing stuff and did not pick up the phone while it was ringing off the hook. Is it impossible that the customer standing there could conceivably have tried to call another time and got no answer?  If I were the owner of this place incognito I would have fired them on the spot. I really hope the owner of the daily press juice bar sees this review. It really does feel like this staff of self-entitled teenagers thinks they are genuinely doing us grown ups a favor.  It took me a full 20 minutes to get out of that place last time and instead of feeling refreshed as I was hoping I had to put up with a certain loss of dignity.  Yes, the rich kids got to me.

So you can eat there and enjoy the standard side orders that come with every Cuban meal.  One issue is inconsistency in entrees.  Sometimes, the ropa vieja, bistec empanizado, and/or palomilla steak are VERY GOOD.  These staples of Cuban cuisine are really good and make for a great and authentic experience.  However, all have all been not very good on occasion.  It can be hit or miss -- but I feel that they have gotten more consistent and better as a whole.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are not really done in the Cuban style, but they aren't bad.  Also, the batidos (Cuban milkshakes) are pretty good.  Try the mamey and guanabana.  Although mamey is my favorite, the guanabana is the best there.\\n\\nThe appetizers still aren't very good.  But the main courses really make up for it.\\n\\nSide note -- perhaps the best thing about it is the cool ambiance and the nice staff.  Really makes it a nice experience to eat there.\\n\\nI recommend trying it for yourself, and think you will probably come back over and over, knowing what to order and sticking to that.  Just don't order takeout.\\n\\nOne last thought -- some of my Cuban friends and I were hanging out the other day and called to ask if they could put together some large orders of rice, beans, and maduros to go with food we had already cooked.

I was nice and he didn't care to make conversation,  I came back to order 2 shots for my wife and her 2 friends and myself to share 4 ways because it was getting late and it looked like it upset him.  First he acted like he didn't have any cherries or other items to make a fruity shot then just suggested a straight liqueur shot (yuck) instead of a fuzzy nipple etc type shot divided by 2 for the sake of my friends whom had been there for 2 hours already.\\nWhen he refused to come up with a shot I rattled off a combo for a shot and he made a very short 2 shots with 2 extra dirty shot glasses to take to my wife's table to share with her friends.\\nSo far I'm dealing with it figuring this guy is having a bad night.

He proceeds to give it back to me and I say kidding \\"what are you doing?

Hopeful for a romantic weekend I booked a Friday through Sunday in a park-view premier room. The staff are as friendly and helpful as possible, but I got the feeling that it was in spite of the hotel itself. \\nCheck in took way to long, the room wasn't ready and they had to switch rooms. \\nThe room service menu, while priced highly and commensurate with their image/marketing was sorely lacking in variety.\\nThe quality of the food, ( we ate exclusively through room service ) was second rate at best. And while the room service wait staff is more than willing to run down to the kitchen to get forgotten items, you would think that there would be better attention paid to the number of people being served when they set the tray. \\nI have had much, much better food staying at the Park Plaza, which markets itself below the Taj. \\nWhen checking out, I called the bell desk for a porter and was placed immediately on hold with one of those annoying \\"bell desk, please hold, click...\\" answers. I was left on hold way too long and finally  hung up and tried again. Someone else answered and took my request. This is something that may be acceptable at a Marriott or Hilton, but not at a hotel that seeks to portray itself as a first class establishment. \\n\\nLittle things add up when you pay top dollar for a supposed finer hotel.

The dish arrived with maybe 4 clams, and 6 small ravioli in a salty, tomatoey broth.  The clams were cooked fine.  The ravioli had not a hint of pork cheek flavor to them; no smokiness, no crispness.

This weekend I was back in town for a visit, and made eating there one of my priorities.\\n\\nThe experience was stunning. Last year they were doing a great job with the four-course menu. This time, in addition, there was a new menu to try, a full tasting menu of something like ten courses. I can't say exactly how many, I confess I lost count, and there were no less then five amuses. Nine of the courses came with wine pairings. I was nervous about being overwhelmed with too much food -- I tend to have a small appetite -- but each course was a perfectly sized gem so that by the end I was full without feeling overstuffed.\\n\\nThe quality and innovation of each dish was striking. Castagna reminds me a great deal of Coi in SF, but it beats Coi in my book for its extensive use of rare herbs. How often do you see \\"sweet woodruff\\" or \\"lovage\\" on a menu? They also find a lot of innovative uses for young green almonds, a wonderfully light and refreshing ingredient (totally unlike mature almonds) that is hard to find elsewhere. One dish that stood out was the slow-cooked duck egg yolk covered with smoked oyster foam and sprinkled with miniature flowers, herbs, and toasted garlic, equally a delight to the tongue and the eye. The \\"sherbet\\" that came as a palate cleanser was wondefully light and airy. I could rhapsodize about each dish, but at 14 or 15 courses that would make an excessively long review. \\n\\nI wish Portland could better appreciate the gem that is Castagna, and I'm disappointed at the number of negative reviews here from people who went there expecting -- I don't know what they were expecting -- and came away grumbling that the portions were small, the prices high, and the food challenging. Uh, yes... if that's not the kind of restaurant you're into, there's a really awesome cafe next door also run by Castagna that has an *amazing* burger. \\n\\nIf you're into this kind of restaurant, then Castagna might be one of the best things about living in Portland.

Over the past year or so they have added seasonal menus that never disappoint!  Last evening, unfortunately was a disappointing experience.  Our party of two ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes featured on the seasonal menu and a soup to accompany our meals.  Those came out super quick and as usual were fantastic.  Our main courses were another story; we both ordered entree salads, something that should be relatively easy to prepare.  However, they took forever!  When our food was finally delivered to the table our waitress indicated that she \\"didn't want to return to the table without having our food.\\"  A statement that is understandable as it wasn't her fault the kitchen was on a delay; however when she expressed that the delay was a result of a bigger party and their food was delivered it was clear that they only had flatbreads which one would assume doesn't affect the kitchens ability to prepare salads. As for the food, the Caesar with salon was prepared well.  The grilled vegetables and steak salad was another thing; one would expect a salad advertised with grilled veggies to actually HAVE grilled veggies.  It didn't.  The steak was fine but the salad was swimming in dressing....  Overall very underwhelming.  In addition to the underwhelming food, our waitress seemed overwhelmed and never offered additional drinks. Will this deter me from returning?  Probably not. But it will change my decision to eat an entire meal here.  Appetizers are always quick to come and reasonably priced but for a $17 salad with only half the advertised ingredients, I don't know that I'll be eating an entire meal here again.

I heard about it a little over a month ago and have been every weekend ever since. The food is exceptional, delicious, quickly prepared, and very fresh. My favorite omelet (pictured) is the Greek Omelet (add turkey sausage). I love some of the healthier options they offer, as well as the sweet decadences. \\n\\nI usually get their breakfast salad instead of home fries/toast which is fantastic! Personally I order it without honey because I don't think it needs the extra sweetness. But still delicious. Their home fries, which I got this time, are also wonderful. You can definitely tell they are fresh and homemade as opposed to just a frozen batch warmed up. \\n\\nIn this order I also had their banana nut caramel waffle. Absolutely amazing! The waffle was hot and crispy when it came out, but soft and fluffy inside. It really didn't need maple syrup at all due to the caramel as well. I personally would've halved the amount of caramel, but I don't eat sugar much at all. So most people will find the amount just right. \\n\\nPro tip: If you're watching what you eat but still want to indulge in something sweet, opt for one of the waffles. Their waffles all have the same topping and flavor options as the pancakes and some French toasts, but they pack considerably less calories per dish. \\n\\nWhich brings me to my next point, I love that they share nutrition information on their website! That's one of the main things I look for in a restaurant so I can make wise eating choices. \\n\\nFinally, the server staff were all super friendly and attentive. My food has been quickly and accurately prepared every time I've gone. And the restaurant is very clean. On the weekends, there is typically no wait time if you arrive before 9:30am or after 12pm.

Again, we're one of 4 or so tables in the restaurant. When they arrived they were a bit over cooked. Gravy was delicious and was all that saved the biscuits, which is a shame because we *loved* their biscuits when they were at their previous location. Our meals arrived just as we finished the 3 biscuits.\\n\\nMy wife's english muffin for the Eggs Benedict was over cooked so much she could almost not cut it. Literally had to ask for a sharper knife. Was like cutting shoe leather. \\n\\nOverall the food was disappointing compared to every other meal we've ever had between Ravenous Pig and Cask & Larder.\\n\\nTold server about the meal problems, and said he told his manager. Guess they weren't too worried about it though as they didn't even offer to comp. the half pot of coffee (which, don't get me started on the fact that you can't offer refills of coffee but instead charge me for another half pot of coffee instead).\\n\\nRavenous Pig was one of our go-to spots, along with Cask & Larder. We LOVED them! Now that the latter is at the airport, with Ravenous Pig replacing it, we likely won't be going to either again.

There are many flavor options; some to me are enticing, others not so much.The wings taste like they have been baked in the pizza oven and have that special quality that makes them markedly superior to your typical fried wings. \\n\\nOn the other hand wings are not as good as chicken wings cooked in a smoker and then finished on a charcoal grill or specialized oven (liked you get at other places around town) I definitely do not like the minuscule  amount (a cursory serving) of celery sticks that they give with the wings and I have equal disdain for the pre-packaged dressings (ranch and blue cheese).. \\n\\nAs far as the pizza goes...well...it is decidedly  good but certainly not great. I have tried many different one-topping slices and some specialty slices. I liked all the ones I tried. Some more than others (Sunshine especially rocks). Pizza here kinda reminds me of the kind one might procure if you crossed Johnny's NY Style Pizza with the pizza at long defunct Shakey's. Odd and weird yet somehow works - maybe it has to do with the dough that they use. \\n\\nI am a pizza purist and I like one or two toppings. Some of the specialty pizzas here feature crazy, off-the-wall toppings (like the ballpark dog pizza and the soul food / fried chicken with collards pizza). I tend to shy away from that weird stuff. I tend to leave that kind of food to folks like Andrew Zimmern. \\n\\nI often sit at the bar (when the place is not crowded during the day) and drink, eat pizza, watch TV and chill. If I walk in and find that the place is overcrowded (which happens often at night) and there is no space at the bar, then I turn around and walk out. My friends and I have often hung out at one of the picnic tables out on the back patio and drink cheap beers ( micro-mini beers such as miller lite or miller high life) and cheap shots (fireball and \\"eye of the tiger\\" [not sure about the contents of the latter]).\\n\\nInside at the bar or outside on the patio; both areas great for people watching.

Since I have been craving good shanghai dumplings recently, I suggested we drive up to Richmond, BC to have some. To my surprise, my friends were willing.

My friends had never had shanghai dumplings before, and they said they liked them.  \\n\\nPork Belly with Bok Choy ($13.99) - We ordered this dish because we noticed many tables around us hvaving it.  How can you go wrong with pork belly?!  This dish was really really good!  The saltiness was perfect and went well with the steamed bok choy and rice.  Mmmm. I want some as I type this!\\n\\nSweet and Sour fried Fish ($11.99) - We ordered this dish at the recommendation of the server.

The weather was perfect so we sat outside. This place shares a great, comfortable outdoor dining area with Noodle. \\n\\nThe cashier was very nice in welcoming us and very helpful in answering questions. Under his suggestion, I tried the Vulture + Duck Debris Gravy on the side. Our food came out within moments after getting our drinks and sitting. For the first half of my sandwich, I spooned a conservative amount of duck gravy on it. As I feared, the duck gravy was entirely too salty and rather ruined the sandwich. For the second half, I skipped the duck gravy and was able to truly taste the great flavors the sandwich had--the spices in the Cajun turkey and the seasoned mayo. The lettuce, tomato, and pickle were very fresh and great in the sandwich. I especially loved the pickle because it had a very unique flavor. The bread was very toasted and fell apart easily. On the parts where the mayo touched, the bread was the perfect texture; on the dry parts the bread was almost inedible.\\n\\nThe Disco Volante (veggie chicharones) that comes with every sandwich was so salty I could not eat more than 2. One of my coworkers also gave up on eating her meal, also saying it was too salty.\\n\\nGood sandwich concepts but execution could definitely be improved."},{"name":"Boteco Restaurant","address":"5135 International Dr, Ste 12","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Come omg yes their steak is soooo good.

Besides the on-another-planet waitress there were things about the food that I feel need to be addressed. Our appetizer came out at the same time as our main dishes (it's just hummus and chips, people). The hummus was incredibly bland - not sure if they're aware that it takes more than garbanzo beans and garlic to make it. I wanted to like the reuben sandwich SO BAD because the flavors were delicious but the meat was so tough, fatty and chewy that it made every bite an ordeal. My date enjoyed his vegan burger.

The skin of the dumplings seemed delicate and thin, but they held together quite nicely. I usually eat it by holding it with chopsticks and a spoon underneath. I take a tiny bite into the side and sip the pork juice out before biting into it so that it doesn't spill everywhere. The pork filling was simple as it was only made up of pork meat and a few other ingredients for flavour, yet it was very juicy and delicious. They were really tasty but not overpowering, the meat was nice and soft, and the skin was suuuper thin but didn't let any of the flavourful pork juice spill out. Overall, I think that the Shao Long Bao in this restaurant was actually comparable to the ones I've had in Toronto at Ding Tai Fung.\\n\\n     The star of the meal was definitely the Shanghai Soup Noodles. This dish is another of my favourites and after trying this in many other Shanghainese restaurants, the one here still outrules em all. It's just that fricken good. This was my first time having this dish and I enjoyed it very much! The thick noodles were surrounded with a rich soy sauce broth. I tried eating this dish two ways; first, I scooped the noodles out and ate them on their own. This method resembled a dry noodle dish that came with pork bits and chopped cabbage. However, I soon realized that the best way to tackle this dish was to pour the broth over the noodles, resulting in a noodle soup that was packed with flavour! The soup was one of those bases that you could literally mix with anything and it'd taste amazing. Good balance of flavour; not too bland and not too salty. We later drowned a plate of veggies in the soup and honestly, I probably would have drank the entire bowl if no one was watching.\\n\\nAdditional Tips - Make a reservation!"},{"name":"Casey's Diner","address":"36 South Ave","city":"Natick","stars":"4","text":"Two hot dogs fixed the way you like, a soda and a bag of chips - best lunch ever!\\n\\nI was taken to Casey's the first time by a Natick townie, and I'm hooked.

A couple were probably poor choices (\\"Heyy sexy, How\\"s it going?!?/! }:-P \\" sent at 3:30 AM to a guy friend of mine is a prime example.) One good text that came out of the intoxicated nonsense were the plans I (apparently) had made with my friend K for a late lunch.  \\n\\nOnce her and N had spoken, they declared we were going to Maudie's. Oh, quelle surprise! I swear to God, if they *don't* suggest a Mexican/Tex-Mex restaurant, I'd think they needed to check into the hospital. Tex-Mex, Tex-Mex, Tex-Mex, all the damn time. I don't think there's enough tortilla chips, cilantro and margaritas I could shove down their throats to ever satisfy these two. Sorry about the venting. I mean, perd√≥name.\\n\\nI'd never been to a Maudie's. Oh sure, I've heard it mentioned a million times, but for some reason, I always had it confused in my head as some sort of Opal Divine's-type beer bar instead of a Mexican restaurant. Clearly, it's not. It's also a chain...something else I never realized.\\n\\nWe were seated in a booth, and started the usual banter about work, boys, and our mutual friends who may or may not be full-time strippers. I ordered the guacamole for my chips, and was mildly satisfied with it. Against better judgment, I ordered the enchiladas as hangover food instead of requesting my usual chicken breast and vegetables, the only healthy dish I can think of when I'm at a Mexican restaurant. \\n\\nThe service was adequate; we didn't wait long for our food. The enchiladas were mediocre, but filling. I don't know if the chef knocked over his shaker of black pepper into my plate, but the one characteristic that stands out was the overkill of black pepper in the enchiladas. This was on top of the green pepper chopped into the meat. If anything, it opened my sinuses, but the last place I want to be a snotty mess is at a restaurant. \\n\\nFrom what I gather from other friends, Maudie's is suited solely for brunch, and even then, solely for their migas (which apparently you can order all day). That and their monster margaritas, which was the last thing any of us needed that day. \\n\\nAs I ate my black pepper with a side of enchiladas, I learned that 1.) K was finally over the guy she was dating recently. Mazel tov...; 2.) N claimed I wasn't over the idiot I had a crush on, which wasn't true; and 3.) I was too tired to argue with either of them on the subject. \\n\\nFor a hungover late lunch, Maudie's came through.

Well, I finally decided I should at least give it a chance.  Unfortunately, my instinct was correct.  I can appreciate the sort of worn-down, \\"authentic\\" atmosphere they maintain--many of my favorite restaurants are like that, but the food just isn't very good. \\n\\nThe garlic bread was mediocre at best--kind of like a Stouffer's French Bread Pizza with more garlic and no tomato sauce.  I thought the caprese salad was below average as well--served with onions and capers (and no basil) on a wilted leaf of lettuce. I had the Penne Arrabiata for my main dish.  I couldn't tell if the tomatoes were fresh, because the sauce was horribly over-cooked.  It was also very salty and covered in parsley, and I thought the mushrooms and pancetta only made the dish worse.  ***Want a good arrabiata? Simmer a chopped clove of garlic in little olive oil for a minute, then add can of peeled San Marzano tomatoes (or fresh if you like),  some FRESH basil, kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, and crushed red pepper and simmer for 15 minutes or so...not that hard.***\\nI also tasted the minestrone--not terrible, but it was served luke warm, and the Ravioli Pomodoro--meh.  \\n\\nTo me, good Italian food is about simple, fresh, high quality ingredients, cooked in such a way that the quality and freshness of each ingredient can be enjoyed. The seasoning is there to bring out the natural flavor of the tomatoes, pastas, breads, cheeses, etc., not to overpower them.  Alfredo's food has no nuance of flavor, no sense of freshness (despite their claims).  \\n\\nIf you are looking for Italian in Atlanta, you'll probably see Alfredo's at the top of many lists--but I caution you--it's not good Italian food...there are better options.  Sotto Sotto is excellent.  Figo, though it's a local chain now, is a quality restaurant at a very reasonable price. Varasano's serves mainly pizza, but he knows what makes real Italian food special."},{"name":"Fortune Pizza","address":"3508 SE 52nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"The people who gave this place good reviews must either be employees, friends of the owners, or just not know what actual food is supposed to taste like. We ordered a salad, wings, pizza & bread sticks through Eat24, and none of it was even remotely edible. How anyone could eat any of what this place sells is completely beyond me. And let me clarify, we're not food snobs in any way. We knew we were ordering cheap, low quality food. But this is some next level low quality stuff. You can actually taste the fact that this \\"food\\" came straight from a frozen package. The bread sticks were soggy and bland - essentially just grease soaked pieces of cardboard. The wings were also soggy, mostly breading, very little meat, and just tasted terrible. And the pizza - I have never tasted pizza as bad as this was. It just all tasted so so bad and freezer burnt, and not like real food at all.\\n\\nAfter attempting to choke down a few bites, I decided to call Eat24 for a refund. The ladies I spoke with at Eat24 were awesome, for the record. They called the restaurant, and came back and told me that the manager at Fortune Pizza said he'd only give me a 70% discount as opposed to a full refund because we took some bites of the food. Let me reiterate that - the manager at Fortune Pizza wouldn't give me a full refund simply because we tasted the food. He actually sent the delivery driver back to my house to get the uneaten food, of which there was 99% left. I'm sure he expected to \\"catch\\" us by sending the driver back for the food. Nope. Not trying to scam ya here dude, we just couldn't eat this cardboard you're trying to pass off as food and I felt like I shouldn't have to pay for cardboard we weren't going to eat. \\n\\nAs far as pizza goes, you're much better off spending a few more dollars and ordering from Rudy's or Pizzicato. And if your heart is set on cheap crappy pizza, go for Papa John's or something. That I'm even mentioning Papa John's is a testament to how bad this place is.

We decided to sit at the bar, and our bartender/waiter-man was friendly and attentive (to be honest, the Yelp reviews I'd read made me nervous, but our service was never slow and our server was very knowledgable). We started with the Seared Sweet Miso Duck. I really didn't like it, but my friend loved it. To be fair, I'm thinking I'm not a duck person.\\n\\nWe then ordered 2 signature rolls (Sex in the City and Picante), and one regular Rainbow Roll.

My friend tried the Gingertini, and the Lychee Saketini. Not my thing at all, but she liked them well enough. I ordered a glass of wine to start with, and had a Pop Rocks Creamy Espresso Martini something or other (I don't see it on their menu now) for dessert. Both were good, and the Pop Rocks/Espresso Vodka drink was surprising and fun.\\n\\nAll of that being said, as good as the food is, and as fun as the drinks are, the prices are just short of outrageous. I really, really enjoyed my dinner, but I've had similar service and equal quality food for a much better price. As much as I enjoyed my experience, I'm finding it hard to justify returning.

All three live up to their respective company names and provide room rates to match that much touted reputation. \\n\\nJust a smidgeon below that elite group is the Peabody Orlando, essentially a business hotel trying very hard to fancy itself a five-start, luxury hotel. \\n\\nDecor/Exterior/Design:\\n\\nThere is no mistaking the hints of five-start luxury in the hotel's designs: a grand, marble-filled lobby, large HD (every channel is in HD) flat screen TVs, plush and comfortable beds. There are towers (each appropriately named Mallard Tower 1/Tower 2). One tower, #2, is the newer of the 2 but I cannot tell you the difference in room design as I was unfortunately housed in the older tower #1. \\n\\nMy room, while you can tell has been built some years ago, has been meticulously renovated with new furniture, new bed, and new bathroom interiors. On the flip side, however, is that the bathroom is still unbelievably cramped and the walls are thin and prone to exterior noise. Generally-speaking the room is small, but comfortable, modern, and clean. \\n\\nPlease note that they do offer WiFi throughout the hotel. However, it's not considered free b/c you are obligated to pay a 10 dollar/day resort fee which includes wifi, among other things such as gym access, etc.\\n\\nService:\\n\\nSo here is really where the luxury brands leave other hotels, including the Peabody Orlando, in the dust. \\n\\nFirst of all, i checked in somewhat early (12pm) and they got me a king bed room as requested. However, i specifically requested the front desk to provide me a room away from the elevator to avoid hearing noise in the middle of the night. The front desk receptionist had signaled that she understood my request, yet when I arrived to my room, low and behold our room was right next the elevator. I subsequently called the front dest receptionist and explained the situation. However, the receptionist responded in an irritated manner, implying that b/c I checked in early there will be no other rooms available. While I understood the predicament of my situation, why did the receptionist not present me w/ a choice to wait or get a room near the elevator when we first met at the front desk? I ended up settling w/ the room.\\n\\nFurthermore, on the last two days of our stay, around 8-9am, there were be scraping sounds originating from one of our walls. It actually turned out to be painters painting the side of the building (we were in the last room of the hotel). We informed the receptionist about this and offered to upgrade us to a better room, but of course, they only offered this on the day of our checkout.\\n\\nOverall impression:\\n\\nIn the end, I felt for a decent price (150-200/night), the Peabody is a good choice for people wanting to stay in an upscale accommodation outside of Disney World. It has many, many amenities (pool, spa, restaurants, in-hotel rental car kiosks, etc etc), luxury accommodations, renovated rooms. However, for those who expect a 5-star hotel will ultimately be disappointed as  the service aspect of this hotel falls short of the likes of Four Seasons, Ritz, etc."},{"name":"Bloc Somerville","address":"11 Bow St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Decent snacks.

I've been to the Bay Moorings restaurant several times thinking it was convenient. As of tonight, I will not go back or order any takeout.  The deck is lovely in the summertime but that is all that works for this place.  Dinners are very average, flavourless, and the food is always dry and over cooked.  The service is fair at best.  Tonight, I ordered a pizza, take out, and it was pathetic.  It was undercooked and the cheese was so cheap, as well, flavourless, that when I re-cooked it under the broiler at home, it would not even melt.  The pizza was flavourless and gummy, much like you would get with a cheap frozen supermarket pizza.   No amount of salt or spices could help this dead pizza come to life.\\nI had asked for feta on the pizza and you would have thought that there was a world wide shortage of feta.  Almost zero feta on the pizza.  Bay moorings had better get it together as Olive & Anchor  and  the new Troller Pub are get additions to Horseshoe Bay which will eclipse this sad, old, poorly run restaurant.

So here goes; first of all i was not impressed walking in and looking at the menu's i didn't see anything different that i couldn't get at subway.  I decided to create my own since the asian salad they came up with only had oranges and crispy noodles(thats not asian).  So i got roman lettuce, black beans and corn, grilled chicken, chic peas, shredded cheese, almonds and chipotle ranch dressing.  So i just realized i didn't even get my 5 free toppings till now but thats probably because i felt rushed by the staff and also the line of people behind me even though there was 5 people behind the counter they cant do more then 1 task at a time they were very disorganized and didn't even greet me or act like they are even there to serve me.  I was handed the plate as if i was in a cafeteria line.

The chicken they put on the salad was real sparse not to mention the salad was nothing more then a side salad you would get with a dinner entree and i think for paying an extra 2.50 for chicken i could get a few more pieces at least an entire breast worth.  So i sat down to eat it and i noticed the chicken was real crappy even had some dark meat in it and a yucky looking fatty piece so i was grossed out.  I was not impressed by the flavor or the look and then when i went to leave i noticed the staff all sitting at the tables because they had no customers at the counter and all i thought was i don't think they wash their hands lol.

I've had just about the worst dining experience of my life eating here. Let me start off by telling you that when my boyfriend ordered apple juice, our waitress failed to inform us that they don't give refills. In every restaurant I've been to, they always make sure to inform you if a certain drink doesn't come with refills. Anyway, we then ordered fried calamari as our appetizer. When it arrived, i was confused because it looked and tasted more like microwaved fish sticks to me. Very unappetizing. I don't think I've ever been served fried calamari like that before. As my entree, I ordered a spicy tuna roll and tempura udon. For some reason my spicy tuna roll came out before our appetizer did, which was weird because the tuna roll was apart of my entree. Thank goodness I ordered the udon last minute or else I would've finished my food before my boyfriend even got his.\\n\\nWhen my tempura udon arrived, It looked stuffed with vegetables and noodles, and upon tasting the soup, I realized that the noodles were soggy and it didn't really taste good either. I wasn't about to pay $13 for something I wasn't going to eat, and forcing myself to eat something that I didn't like was out of the question, as I've read that another review did just that to avoid being charged extra. I explained to my waitress that the noodles were soggy and that I didn't want it. She then told me she'd be right back and walked over to another girl, I'm assuming she was the head waitress or something. I saw them talking by the sushi bar, and then the other girl looked at me and nodded her head to what my waitress was saying to her. When the other waitress came up to she had a bit of an attitude, she asked \\"do you have any questions?\\" Kind of snappy. I then told her that I didn't have any questions, just that my udon noodles were soggy and that I wasn't enjoying the meal. I made sure to add that I had sushi before and it was fine, I liked it. But she seemed offended that I didn't like the soup. She then felt the need to give me a huge attitude, talking fast and dismissing my opinion on the food that they gave me by saying \\"the soup just came out of the kitchen, that's how they are. And all of our other customers that had it liked it so there's nothing wrong with it.\\" I was shocked when she told me this so rudely. She then took the soup from my table, and when I tried to hand her the tempura as well she ignored it then turned to my boyfriend and asked him if he wanted a to go box for his food. I was so shocked by how absolutely rude this girl was, she wasn't even our waitress, I have no idea who she was actually. Or what authority she had. My boyfriend had just started eating, and we left no indication that we were ready to leave the restaurant yet, so I was horrified by how this girl handled the situation. I felt like I was being kicked out. My boyfriend no longer wanted the food anymore because of how I was treated but I told him he should ask for a box anyway to avoid anymore issues. \\n\\nWe waited a couple of minutes in awkwardness because we kept getting stared at by the staff. And when our waitress came with the to go bag and our check she slammed it on the table and kept walking without saying a word to us. At this point I was just so done with this place. I left the to go box where it was and had my boyfriend pay the bill. And get this, they had a male waiter come and pick it up, probably cause they didn't want to \\"deal with us\\". I've never had so many waiters at a restaurant in my life. Upon receiving our debit card again, I made sure to write my complaints on their copy of the receipt. I am usually a very generous tipper, I know how it is to wait tables and run around bringing food out all day. I myself, have worked as a waitress before so trust me, I know how it is. But I just could not tip this waitress for being so rude. Even before the problem with my food began, she was not attentive to our table at all, I counted about five times that she walked by our table and made eye contact with me and the pile of plates I put at the edge of the table for her to take, but she did not take it. Who would want to eat their food with dirty plates sitting next to them for so long? Also, she never once asked if I wanted a refill on my drink. This place was all around bad. I'm not sure why it has four stars. The service was just as terrible as the food. Of course, eat here at your own risk, but beware the waitress Jiawen. So rude. It's unfortunate that I didn't catch the name of the other waitress she called over.\\n\\nI would also like to add that when I left my table to get the heck out of there, our waitress and the waiter that picked up the bill were standing at the corner by the door staring at us. It was very weird and a bit creepy.\\n\\nI will never eat here again!!!!"},{"name":"Antique Table","address":"2 Essex St","city":"Lynn","stars":"4","text":"Love the eggplant rollatine app, the waiter that tells you to drive safe cause his girlfriend is out there and I crave the chicken valdostana (at least the half portion I split with the wife - it's huge (TWSS))!"},{"name":"Kahuna Grill","address":"13701 S John Young Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"Mediocre at best. \\n\\nWas looking at dining options in the area and thought \\"why not\\"...

It came with a great selection of soft and hard cheeses, alongside olives, chicken liver pate (yum!), sliced meats, and many other bites to accompany and complement the cheeses. Everything was so good that conversation ceased, except for the occasional compliment of the food, until the platter was cleared of all its tasty bits.

The bar was actually pretty packed for a Wednesday night with the scene considerably more upbeat and younger than 2 weeks ago when I was there.\\n\\nThe best part about the renovation is the adding of new \\"craft\\" beers (yah) and upgrading the menu.

The inside though - if you can believe it - is even cooler as they definitely stick to their villains theme. The far right wall is one big world domination art type design, it's so cool. I was charmed immediately.. The bathrooms are a treat too (in terms of design of course).\\n\\nThe menu's main feature are sandwiches, in addition there are bar snacks, salads, a few traditional sides, and cocktails - If you hadn't guessed all of the menu items are named after a famous villain. We got a kick out of figuring out which villain came from what fandom!\\n\\nFor my entree I went with the 'Montgomery Burns'  - a short rib featured sandwich, with - wait for it - Cheese Whiz Brie - I had to have it, can you blame me? While the Whiz nor Brie aspect were big stand outs, I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless, and it seemed to be a pretty big hit at our table. I also had the kale salad, which again I thoroughly enjoyed - the kale was crisp and fresh, and the dressing was delicious! On the side of all sandwiches come a side of complimentary chicharones - Mexican style chips - which are tasty. They were on the menu for our initial visit and I was sad not to see them this visit until I noticed that they had become a complimentary staple. Points!\\n\\nI was also fairly impressed with their cocktail menu - they all sounded so creative and well conceived, I got to try one featuring Mexican Coke, bourbon, and roasted peanuts - needless to say, it was awesome!\\n\\nI really enjoyed both experiences at Villains - definitely come for the scenery and stay for the food!"},{"name":"Congee Noodle House","address":"141 E Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Whenever I decide to take a road trip from Seattle to Vancouver, Congee Noodle House is always a must visit after any event that involves drinking.\\n\\nThis last visit was just as great as the others.

I've been going for over a year, and regularly for the past four months or so for weekday lunch.\\n\\nThe pizza is very good - great flavours, thin crust.  With only a couple of exceptions, reheated slices are always very good.\\n\\nSo, why two stars you ask?\\n\\nOperations & Management\\nI've been a server, a bartender and worked at large corporate restaurant chains.  It pains me in some way almost every time I'm in there when it comes to the people and general operations.\\n\\nI hope that ownership reads this and takes some of my comments as constructive criticism.\\n\\nServer(s)\\nUsually only one during busy lunch hours, and for whatever reasons, the turnover is incredibly frequent.  Not only that, hired staff, while largely pleasant, clearly have little to no hospitality or restaurant experience.  \\nI've shown at least three servers how to pour beer after watching them struggle, had to instruct others on basic bar (I watched a server try to make a caesar for someone with rum...), a server who isn't even old enough to pour drinks and so on - to be fair, I don't think she works there anymore, very high turnover.  I've taken people there who are incredulous that the place runs at all.\\n\\nThey also don't have the experience to be on their own and to know basic skills involved in serving, so orders are taken down wrong, customers wait and wait and wait, and then wait some more.  Drinks are made and poured without ice (the ice machine that didn't work in ages is at least gone).  While communication is a challenge with some (lot of eastern European and other Europeans go through the place), they are trying and I don't really fault the individuals, rather, feel bad for them.  No one has trained them, and the only support they get that I see is someone yelling at them from the kitchen. I would remind the owner(s) that ServingitRight certification is required for anyone left in charge, even as a food primary licensee.  Details on the program may be found here: http://www.servingitright.com/   I do often enjoy a pint with my pizza provided they aren't currently out of one or more draft beers.\\n\\nTake out vs eat in\\nFor the love of good, have your people serving the take out window let people know it's for takeout only, and/or make it very obvious with a sign.  EVERY SINGLE TIME I go there, people either do or try to walk inside with pizza slices from the window or wait ten minutes only to find out they have to go outside.  It's terrible for customers and hard for the servers.  It's a bit unusual in this part of the world to charge more to eat in, but if you're going to do that, make it less painful for everyone, it's a fairly easy fix.\\n\\nGeneral Management/Operations\\nHow many times have I gone there during the week or weekend and:\\n \\nLocked up closed at 1130 am when it should be open\\nCook hasn't shown up so there is no pizza\\nOvens not working, being cleaning, not clean so whole pizzas only or slices only\\nAnswer the phone\\nIf someone has the foresight to place a large order ahead of time, try to make sure it happens at least close to the time so my staff aren't scrambling when they expected to have pizzas.\\n\\nMy last criticism...when a customer does have a concern, consider addressing it, especially if it's legitimate.  Better yet, don't serve slices that are obviously burnt as they have been in the oven twice as long as they should be.  If the entire crust is black and brittle, it's not pleasant to try and eat.  Today I was served two slices, one of which was wrong.  Normally I would just eat it (not the first time it's happened), but it had mushrooms and I can't eat them.  So, while they heated another slice, they took away my first slice, but just left it sitting on the counter getting cold.  That's how I got it back, one delicious almost what I ordered slice and my cold slice that had already been reheated.\\n\\nThe food is so good, and so much potential, just a few tweaks around service and such would turn it into an amazing place.  \\n\\nHire good people, have/hire a GM, invest a bit in people/customer service - do something or it's a slippery slope in this business.  I haven't been to the other location, and I know one is opening soon.  Perhaps they are better, but before you start expanding again, let's look at fixing what's broken.\\n\\nSadly, with the hundreds of other places around, including pizza, I will be taking a break from here."},{"name":"Barlata Tapas Bar","address":"1500 S Lamar Blvd, Ste 150","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Delightful meal.

I was sitting on the edge, with 50 cents in my pocket from the $2.50 cup of coffee. I had another dollar in the barrel, with me ready to splurge $1.50 for a refill. This did not happen because I had loose pockets that day. My quarter fell to its death, all the way down to the first floor. Didn't kill anyone, though.\\n\\nThere is a great vibe for anyone wanting to get work done, socialize, or veg out. Additionally, you can say you have enjoyed a beverage or a meal (not only breakfast items here, mind you) in the Austonian--not in the premises of one of the following: Congress, 2nd Bar+Kitchen, Bar Congress. Whatever. It's still a prime property to enjoy a morning or afternoon delight in. Well... maybe not TRUE afternoon delight.\\n\\nTake my advice when I say that the best time to enjoy this clean-cut satellite branch of the Austin cult coffee classic is Saturday or Sunday morning. More likely, you will enjoy Saturday. A larger majority of folks will be hungover on the 6th day rather than the morning of the Sabbath. What follows will be some perks: free parking out front until 11AM on weekends. After this pre-noon time, you won't want to stay longer anyway--what with sprinting to your car to not drip a drop of sweat after soaking up that cool coffee shop A/C.\\n\\nAustin-centric establishments that get transplanted into the corporate parts of town (see Wholly Cow Burger, with its roots originally in a gas station on South Lamar) often lose character.

I went there last night with my fiancee, and we enjoyed every bite of every dish. I ordered an Oldfashioned and she ordered a Bellini while we waited for our table. My drink was awesome, served with a slice of bacon, and I felt a little buzz after it (a rarity for me). \\n\\nWe started with the Gruyere Biscuits and Mussels, both of which were delightful. The biscuits were surprisingly filling, served as they were with a delicious spiced butter. The mussels were soaked in a witte beer, which was a delicious innovation on the usual lemon-butter sauce. I want to stress that these mussels were MASSIVE, and they were served with a thick saffron sauce. They also came with truffle fries, which were absolutely the best fries I've ever had. I was truly amazed how TRP was able to craft these delicious shoestring fries, and it demonstrates the restaurant's theme of doing otherwise normal pub food at a 4-star level.\\n\\nThen, the entrees. My better half ordered a pasta dish (because she was already getting full from our apps), and I went with the Pork Platter Sampler. Now, I'm a pork man. I travel the Southeast looking for the best BBQ (best I've found, btw, is at Fresh Air BBQ in Georgia). So I thought that, if any part of our meal would underwhelm or rest on its laurels, it would be my main entree. Wow, was I wrong. 3 different pork variations comprised the platter: a pork belly piece (served with an apple chutney), a \\"country steak\\" portion (with fat marbled in, served on an acidic bed of cabbage), and a kielbasa pork sausage (served with these delicious pickled heirloom tomatoes). Each flavor combination worked so well together that I really can't find words to describe them. All I can say is you won't be disappointed with this dish, and if you're a pork lover, it's pretty much your wet dream. And it went really well with the Cigar City Oatmeal Dark brew I ordered with my meal. Delicious!\\n\\nWe passed on dessert because we were so full, but our meal came out to be about $120 (with tip), so I felt this was actually very reasonable for the quality of the food and drinks.

I typically don't like the food that they serve.  And I will say that this place has the feel of a chain restaurant (whether or not it is, I dunno).  I went to an event held by a local non-profit at Get Sum, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The food deserves some dim sum street cred, despite the fro-yo-shop feel of the restaurant itself.\\n\\nDim sum is always best when shared between multiple people, so I went with two others.  We split a ton of food and got to try a bunch of things.\\n\\nHrmm...:\\n-I was a little disappointed to see that there was only one kind of soup on the menu.  I'm not a hot and sour fan, so I was looking for wonton or egg drop.  I love me some soup to start a meal off right!\\n-The fried rice and chow mein were both dreadfully under-seasoned.  Luckily they provide soy sauce, chili oil, and chili paste, which did the trick.  Who knows...maybe they purposefully under-season so you can customize.\\n-There's hardly any pork on the menu!  The only dumplings they have that contain pork also contain shrimp.  The gf was not happy about this.  The BBQ pork steamed buns (bao) were the ONLY pork-only item on the menu.\\n-The Chinese broccoli was well-steamed, but drenched in oyster sauce.  I was fine with it, but the gf was a little disappointed.  It actually smelled/tasted like the ocean.\\n-The veggie egg rolls tasted good, but I was totally turned off by the residual frying oil running down my hand.  Just not very appetizing.  The gf DID like these. :)\\n\\nAlmost as good as I've had:\\n-Potstickers: both the veggie and chicken varieties were very tasty.  The veggie ones were filled with ACTUAL veggies...not that non-descript shredded cabbage/carrot-y mess that usually comes in veggie dumplings.  I was very pleased.  All I ask, though, is that there be a pork potsticker on the menu.  Whoa...that might totally win me over!\\n-Shrimp dumplings: these were almost as good as the Shanghai (restaurant, not city) version.  They're very satisfying.  It's so simple, too...just a well-cooked shrimp steamed in some sort of wheat-starch wrapper.  Perfect with chili oil and soy sauce.\\n-Sticky rice: so many options!  We got the chicken and Chinese sausage variety.  Sooo good.  Too bad we got it last.  I wasn't able to eat it all because I was so stuffed!\\n-Egg custard bao: I'm usually not a fan of the egg custard tarts (I'm just not much for sweets), but because my fellow Yelpers absolutely raved about these, I had to try one.  I see what the fuss is about!  Very good.  It's similar to Bavarian cream, but it's stuffed inside of a steamed bun.  Crazy idea, but it works.\\n-Service: The manager (and maybe owner) was very helpful and attentive.  Our food came out as soon as it was ready (so we got it in waves), which I prefer...especially with something like dim sum.\\n\\nOverall, I liked this place.  Will I choose to go to Get Sum over going to Shanghai for my dim sum fix?  Probably not.  But if I happen to be in the area and need to kill some time, I wouldn't mind popping in for an order of dumplings!"},{"name":"Szechuan Chili","address":"804 W 6th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I order delivery here when I get home late from work and I'm always pleased with my order.

Well, she at no time told me they don't have Tandoori Chicken today and no where on the menu board does it reflect this.  Then she admitted that she even overcharged me on the overpriced item!

That was true some of the time.  Whoever makes the wings on Thursday is not the same person who makes the wings on Sunday.  On Thursdays, the wings are always freshly dipped and more than enough sauce.  On Sunday, I ordered Lemon Peopper wings that were extremely bland with little to know lemon pepper.  The wild asian teriyaki were also lack luster.  I could barely taste the sauce.  I was already sitting home eating, so I couldn't...well I could have, but didn't go back to complain or get extra sauce.  \\n\\nMy husband told me that he didn't like the wings here when I first ordered(on a Thursday).  But, when they arrived, he told me the wings looked different (better).  Now, I'm assuming he went on a Sunday and was as disappointed as I was.  \\n\\nI loved this place for the price and quality before my Sunday experience.

On our trips to Bend, OR, 30-40 or so miles away from our home in Prineville Oregon, we'd finish a day shopping or going to the movies with some Shari's pie and as a kid I absolutely loved it.  Since then my taste and expectations have heightened and while I still come here from time to time, I'm not a huge fan.  While the menu has more than enough to choose from what you'll get ends up being mediocre for the price.  For instance I just got a Spinach Cobb Salad which was essentially what I'd throw together at home in a few minutes.  That said, the reason I do come here is for a cup of coffee, the service, and the wi-fi (which I'm using now on my beautiful new iPad).  And that brings me to what's good about Shari's.  It's a good place to sit alone, drink some coffee, and work.  It's also a good place to meet with friends and family and just talk for an hour or two (they won't pressure you to leave, just eat more pie!).  Sadly since the anti-freedom junkies have taken over there's no smoking--and that's one thing I used to love, could come here at 11pm or later, smoke, and talk with someone for hours, and just release tension (I should note I also believed restaurants that allowed smoking needed to [by law] keep smoking and non-smoking sections in completely separate rooms; most restaurants either didn't think of it or didn't want to undertake the costs; unfortunately this, imho, lead to the eventual passing of anti-smoking laws by people who were rightly irritated to be two seats away from a table of chain smokers--oh frack--back to my review!!!).  Well, that's about it.  Don't come here if you expect the food to be great (it'll pass), but do come here if you want some time alone with a cup of coffee, book, or computer, and/or some dinner and desert while socializing with friends and family."},{"name":"Banzai Sushi & Grill","address":"3914 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I miss the days when Banzai was located on the Drag, but they have changed their menu and pricing since moving to the Hyde Park location.\\n\\nI would avoid their sushi, but I like them because they have fairly good, affordable Japanese non-sushi entrees such as the kashiage don, the lunch bento boxes, etc.\\n\\nI don't visit them regularly, but when I get a craving near campus for tenpura or katsu Banzai is my #1 pick."},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"300 West 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"I don't really like chains and I realize this is difficult to avoid in FL but I ended up here anyway and regretted it.

Being an exploratory individual (not to mention in a constant state of hunger), I said to my husband one night: \\"Let's head down 10th and just go in someplace to grab dinner.\\" Famished as well, my better half was like, \\"Ok. Cool!\\" And then he gave me two thumbs up (that last part did not happen, by the way).\\n\\nSo we drive and drive, unable to make a decision to land somewhere. We were just looking for a place that seemed like it would accept us lookin' kinda ratty in our t-shirts and shorts; wouldn't cost us an arm and a leg; would give us decent food and cold beer; and wasn't ridiculously crowded. \\n\\nFinally....we landed....at Joe's on Juniper.\\n\\nWe squeezed my car into this parking spot (which I was ecstatic we even got one!), and headed up to the front door. Somehow I missed the rainbow flag (I know, right?), but as soon as we walked in, I was like, \\"Hey, hang on a quick sec....there are a lot of dudes here.\\" It was trivia night, though, so I thought maybe it was just frat bros enjoying some man time out. Yea...no. One more detailed look around and the light bulb went off. I looked behind me and saw the flag and was like, \\"How did I miss that beautiful thang all wavin' in the wind??\\" \\n\\nWe sat outside cause it was super crowded and loud inside (trivia). Plus, there was quite a wait. But I didn't care. I was so happy I could hardly contain myself. This place seemed so fun and the night's air was actually quite nice. Plus, I was freakin' hungry, so I would have sat on the kitchen floor to eat. \\n\\nIt was fairly quiet outside, but there were a few other tables of folks, so it wasn't like we were isolated and being lame outside. Once I shared with my husband what was going on, he was surprised (and perhaps a little uncomfortable at first), but he eventually warmed up and really enjoyed our time at Joe's....as did I. \\n\\nOur waiter was SO adorable. He looked like he stepped out of an abercrombie catalog, but he had a very innocent look about him. He was a sweetheart and kept our drinks coming and made sure to check up on us frequently. He even gave a flirty smile to my husband once, which I felt validated my choice for a life partner. :) The gays know, lemme tell ya! \\n\\nOur food was pretty decent. Nothing too special, but the fun atmosphere kind of dulled the fact that the food was average. I thought it was a bit pricey for what it was, but it wasn't, like, offensively expensive or anything. And it's simple. I think my husband had like a chicken sandwich and I had a burger. Hard to screw that up.\\n\\nAnyway, Joe's is way fun, and I thought the people there had a good overall attitude. I'm not sure how good of a place it would be if you brought a big group of dinner or anything, but a night out with your pals (or, hell, even your husband) is sure to be a good time at Joe's.

The tonkatsu ramen was a little on the salty side and the chashu was okay. The shrimp tempura could've been a little more crispy, and the shrimp were not the same length.
