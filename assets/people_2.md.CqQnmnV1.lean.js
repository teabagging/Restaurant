She covered her mouth and giggled coyly, but said she would ask someone. They came back and offered to cut up the fish for him - only took a couple minutes! And it was almost boneless after that... delicious! We were only expecting a little instruction but they basically filleted a whole fish for us.\\n\\nDRINKS\\nThai tea is always delicious. I usually have the jasmine green tea or the ginger tea (yum!). Tonight we tried two kinds of sake -- coconut lemongrass & Asian pear. We both preferred the first one...it was nigori (unfiltered) sake, very exotic and a little creamy. \\n\\nFOOD\\nThe best part. There are so many delicious dishes. One of Sea Thai's unique dishes that I don't find anywhere else is their soft shell crab curry. I think it's best with red curry but they sometimes offer it with other flavors like Thai Basil. Otherwise here's a list of my favorites:\\n- Phad Woon Sen (SO flavorful - best noodle dish!)\\n- ANY curry!\\n- Pineapple Duck Curry\\n- Mee Grob\\n- Smokey Pot (very unique flavors but not too strong to enjoy)\\n- Anything with peanut sauce \\n- Any of their desserts, especially mango sticky rice\\n\\nIf you love Thai food, you will LOVE Sea Thai."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Foods good not gonna lie .

Seriously, I've been here for over an hour and still no closer to the counter than I was an hour ago. I saw a little girl sitting on the counter while her parents talked to the ticket agent and now, 10 minutes later, she's still there. Poor thing. I can't imagine how arduoud this would be for a first-timer to the park. I've been fortunate enough to be able to visit this park many times over the years, this being the first time I've been back since 2009. However, I've been to Orlando area parks (disney included) since I was a year old, and I NEVER had to wait over an hour just to get my ticket to go to a stupid park. \\n\\nAnd despite the few entertaining rides on its premises, in retrospect, Universal Studios isn't even worth the admission. This park is unoriginal at best. The Disaster ride is just a rebranded version of the Earthquake ride. The Simpsons ride is just a rebrand of the Back to the Future ride. Even the new Despicable Me ride is a rebrand of the Jimmy Neutron ride, which was a rebrand of the Hanna Barbera ride. Same ride, different character. Sometimes they don't even bother hiding the remnants of the past ride. The last new ride they created is the rip ride rocket which according to my friends, isn't as exhilirating as it sounds. \\n\\nThe customer service here is abysmal. I just got to a teller, after a 1 hour and 20 minutes, and she spent 5 minutes doing nothing, not acknowledging me or my family's presence or anythsng. \\n\\nIt's been 5 minutes since the last paragraph and while I ended up going to another open teller, that was slightly more attentive, the lady that was in line behind me just collapsed a minute ago and we all chipped in to get her some water and a piece of candy. I think she suffered from low blood sugar from waiting in line here so long. I wish I were making all of this up but I'm not. Folks, this park does not give a dime about its patrons. I've seen enough in the last 5 minutes that would warrant never coming back to this park again. If you value customer service and want your family treated to a great time, I seriously suggest you go to a Disney park.

The crust is burnt just enough (think about the perfect marshmallow; caramelized, but not charcoal).\\n\\nI'm typically the guy who doesn't mind leaving crust. I CAN'T do that here. The condiments are self-serve, so get a little cup and pour some of olive oil, peppers, salt, black pepper, garlic, and BAM, you have the best dipping sauce for your crust.\\n\\nThe anchovy pizza was good; however, by the 2nd slice I was kind of over the fishy taste. They aren't grilled anchovies either.\\n\\nI LOVE it here. Bring your own wine. \\n\\nIf there's no seating inside, go to the other establishments and they'll bring the pizza to you (if you tell them).

She literally goes above and beyond to suit your customers needs. Excellent customer service seriously makes my day especially from an unlikely place such as a burger joint. \\n\\nLike many other reviewers have mentioned, the burgers here are very simple. I like simple no fuss burgers. I don't need them to be stacked five times high, or be bigger than the size of my head. Something that tastes good and fresh and that I am able to put into my mouth without turning into a she-beast would be nice; and Five Guys has just that. \\n\\nYou choose your toppings and sauces and you get to choose a single patty or double with the options of cheese and bacon. The burgers I got today were cooked on par, with the one exception of the patty not being as hot as I would have liked. My cheese didn't melt all the way (i'm assuming this is due to the burgers not being hot enough?) and some of the fries were overcooked (it was very strange how some were overcooked and dark coloured whereas the rest of them were perfectly fine). Since I am so smitten by these burgers i'm definitely going to be returning here and next time i'll be sure to ask them to cook my patty just a tad bit longer.

Don't go expecting to get your food quickly or even be seen quickly- make sure you've got plenty of time to kill. Their serve staff can be pretty rude as well. One of our visits there, our server was so terrible and mean. He made us feel stupid for asking for water and told us \\"I have more important drinks to fill right now.\\" He had been standing still in the corner for a solid 15 minutes prior to that...

The service, though friendly, is incredibly slow. I'm not sure if they're understaffed, but it didn't seem like they were good at budgeting their time. We stood for about 5 minutes while staff people walked back and forth before someone grabbed some menus and pointed us at the one of the empty tables. Honestly I couldn't done that myself if they didn't have a big sign saying, \\"Please wait to be seated.\\" It also took forever for them to run the credit card we had given to pay the check.\\n\\nI ordered the Grapefruit Sunrise smoothie, which was fruity and delicious, though I wish the sweet-tartness of grapefruit was a bit present. Their smoothies are more towards the juicey side rather than the thick side. We decided to share the mac n cheese and the hummus plate, to balance out the fatty cheese with some healthy veggies. The mac n cheese was okay; I liked the ritz cracker topping and the veggies mixed in, but it lacked a strong cheesy flavor. The hummus plate was tasty, except it had maybe three cucumber slices and four carrot sticks and then a pile of greasy pita chips to scoop the hummus.\\n\\nI love the idea of a bookstore and caf√©, but I wasn't really blown away."},{"name":"The Porter Beer Bar","address":"1156 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Whoever owns this place is very passionate about what they put out.

I can't even come to terms with the fact that Ruth's Chris blatantly tries to pull the wool over people's eyes and does so successfully (by in large), by way of the beautiful decor and the masking of inferior product by lathering it in butter and salt. Either way, I felt personally insulted when I was invited to dinner here to learn that I would not be getting the experience that I had hoped for, but in all reality was skeptical of from the start. \\n\\nI started with the Seared Ahi and the Shrimp Remoulade Cocktail. Seared, maybe at one point it was, but clearly the line cook forgot about it and whoever was expediting that night felt no need to check its doneness as it was delivered to me as dried out as a slab of plywood! Tuna, well done? really? By the time it arrived to the table most of my party were finished with their apps so I simply moved on to the Shrimp. While the size of each shrimp was adequate, the flavor of the spicy New Orleans homestyle cocktail sauce was anything but spicy. Flat out, it tasted like it was poured from a supermarket brand bottle.\\n\\nNext up was the entree. After perusing the menu, I wanted to get up and leave! Who in their right mind would promote the fact that their beef is \\"corn-fed\\" like that's something to boast about???!!!! And if this wasn't abhorrent enough they pepper the rest of the menu with terms like \\"USDA Prime\\" like the government body who regulates industry while in bed with them means anything resembling integrity and quality. My God, wake up!!! Off the specials list was a Kobe Beef cut which I was immediately doubtful about so when I asked our server where it was from, you can imagine my shock when she replied \\"I don't know, do you want me to find out?\\" UHHH YEAH! As it turned out the \\"Kobe\\" beef was from New Zealand!!!!! WHAT A FRAUD!!!! It was probably corn fed too... I opted out of the beef and went for the Lamb, which was boring, unimaginative, and lacked depth. Please, do not use adjectives on your menu that you have no business using. Also, \\"free-range\\" simply means the barn door is left open, doesn't necessarily qualify as pastured. RC's ignorance, or the fact that they just don't care, is appalling.\\n\\nThey have generously been given a second star based on the decor and because they have an okay drink menu. The servers seemed to have been on parole or work release, the food was terrible (at best), and the price was not worth what I regrettably digested. Ruth's Chris is nothing more than a done up Outback. If you have to spend money on a nice steak dinner, please do yourself a (huge) favor and go around the corner to KO Prime. At least Ken Oringer takes pride in what he puts his name on and his reputation and resume speak for itself."},{"name":"Noodle Market","address":"470 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3.5","text":"Very tasty food!

They are only resting on their past reputation. It is not worth the wait anymore. I took a party of five and as I said the food was average, the service as always, terrible, and the wait extra long. The pastor was overcooked and underseasoned, the Yakima sauce was bland. The broccoli which has always been a staple for them was tasteless. For a place that makes you pay cash for their convenience, doesn't take reservations, makes you wait outside, and makes you bag them for service, this all adds up to a place that should not be in business. The customer has to be the priority, and they act as if they are doing us a favor. Something has to change fundamentally in this restaurant.

A pastry challenge of sorts - Mike's vs. Modern vs. Maria's.\\nIve done this with donuts - why not Italian baked goods?\\nTo be as close to fair as I could - I decided I would get one cannolli at each place. The plan was one plain cannolli. So I could compare apples to apples. Or cannolli to cannolli, as it were.\\n\\nMy take:\\n\\n***Maria's - 4 Star!***\\nMaria's is TINY! If there are 6 customers in the store, they'll be sardines. Luckily - we were the only ones there. We didn't have any more room for food (or sugar) - so we decided to get our items to go and eat them later.\\nAs with Modern - cannolli are filled to order. Choice of shell, choice of filling. I ordered a plain shell with plain ricotta filling, the coworker decided to make hers the same as mine.\\nThe filling - solid! The flavor was every bit as good as Modern, but not quite as thick. But great texture overall - I would never pass one of these up.\\nThe shell - PERFECTION! Crispy, flaky, delicious!\\n\\n***Modern - Solid 5 Star!***\\nModern is far smaller than Mike's, and with only a small fraction of the baked good on display. More retail offerings (imported coffees, mugs, \\"grab and go\\" pre-wrapped baked goods, etc.) than Mike's and a very cozy atmosphere. Cannolli are filled to order. Your choice of 3 shells, 4 fillings, assorted toppings. I went with the plain shell, traditional ricotta filling and powdered sugar on top. It was a bit smaller than Mike's - but that's not a bad thing. It was a proper serving size for one!\\nThe filling - OMG perfection! Thick, creamy ricotta with just barely a hint of sweetness. THIS is the cannolli filling I fantasize about.\\nThe shell - similar texture and flavor as Mike's - but thinner, so breaking it was not a problem.\\nThe coworker had a filled zeppoli with vanilla creme. She really enjoyed it - and was able to eat it without logistical issues. Yay!\\nAs with Mike's, our timing was impeccable. Only a few ahead of us in line, no problem getting a table - and when we left - the line was WAY out the door.\\n\\n***Mike's - 3.5 Stars, Rounding up to 4!***\\nThis is definitely the most tourist friendly of the three. I was warned about long lines - but being there on a mid day Thursday while it was snowing kept tourists at bay.  Our timing was perfect - only a couple people in front of us - and no problem getting a table. It started filling up and lines extending as we were finishing up. Smells the way I expect a bakery to smell - lots of flour and sweet in the air. Visually, the most impressive of the three bakeries. Several cases of Connolly, cakes, butter cookies, cupcakes, puzzles, biscuit - an overwhelming variety. And THIRTEEN varieties of Connolli! Cruel to provide that many options! This was the first stop - and temptation did me in. So much for plain - I ordered the chocolate ricotta cannolli. \\nThe filling - WAY sweet! And from other reviews - still not as sweet as the creme filled. Even separating out the level of sweet the chocolate brought, this was sugar overload. The texture was great, the size was ginormous - but I couldn't even finish half of it...this was just way more sugar than I can possibly handle at one sitting.\\nThe shell - very nicely done. A wee bit thicker than I'd like - I really had to slam my plastic fork into it to get it to break. But the flavor was impeccable.\\nMy coworker ordered the Boston Creme Puff. The chocolate shell on top was too hard to navigate with plastic fork AND knife. The server who brought the pastries and drinks to our table instructed her to turn it upside down and eat from the bottom. The flavors were great - but she was quite frustrated it was that difficult to eat a pastry, and gave up on the pastry and chocolate, throwing over half the item away."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"A must do if you are in the Disney area.

Granted, my husband and I are very tall (6'6\\" and 6'0\\", respectively), and with six of us we were really packed into our table.\\n\\nWe ordered some small plates to start that were pretty tasty, but each plate comes with two very very tiny portions.  Really just two amuse bouches per plate.\\n\\nThe \\"anchovy salad\\" was horrible.  They really tried to make clear that the salad was \\"not a Caesar,\\" and it definitely was not.  It was a few leaves of romaine with an anchovy on top, covered with some very greasy oil.  It was definitely not a high-end olive oil because it had almost no flavor.  Once the anchovy was gone I couldn't finish the rest of the salad because it was so oily and flavorless.\\n\\nThe highlight of the dinner was the baked trout.  It was absolutely delicious and inspired me to cook trout at my next two dinner parties.\\n\\nFinally, I have a big problem when restaurants serve $50 bottles of wine in crappy Ikea tumblers.  It really ruins the wine experience and wastes the money you spent on the wine.  This was kind of the feel that I got from the whole restaurant.  They want to serve you expensive, higher-end food, but they are going to give you a rustic dining experience.  Just give me comfortable chairs and good wine glasses, and I'll probably be much happier when it comes to eating my dinner."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Lunch selection was good.

She suggested the shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles, Peach cobbler French toast, salmon coquette. Which we ordered all of this plus the oatmeal, side of chicken breast, chicken and biscuits with gravy, pancakes, and eggs. The Peach Cobbler French Toast was amazing. SERIOUSLY GOOD with a side order of chicken. The chicken was seasoned so good. The oatmeal was good as well. We asked for Strawberries instead of berries and it was exceptional.  We were satisfied with the serving size as well. When you order juice (orange/apple) it's a bottle of juice and no refills.

A few times I've eaten here just because i wanted to go back for a specific drink they had at one time or another\\n\\nTheir charcuterie board options are fantastic, especially if you go all out and get a few of the condiments. I think it was the smoked shallot marmalade that really knocked our socks off. A well-designed board isn't cheap or necessarily filling, but your taste buds will thank you.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a full belly and full wallet approach, you can't go wrong with the pizzas. They are prepared with all the same creativity as the other menu items, but tend to be much more food for about the same price, and they are very well executed. The broccoli rabe pizza with lemon zest and ricotta is a recent favorite. Obviously anything with pork on it is a win as well.\\n\\nAlso, The Salty Pig has a pretty cool range of events for which you typically trade a ticket for a food and booze pairing. From Porkapalooza chef showdowns (yea it's as awesome as it sounds) to all-you-can-eat whole hog roasts, I feel like the Salty Pig goes out of their way to have fun events that more traditional restaurants would never attempt.

Unfortunately, the brisket was just not that great.  It wasn't very tender and was actually sort of dry.  The pork rib was just ok as well... again, just not very moist.

I also liked the vinegar-based cole slaw and potato salad.\\n\\nAfter a semi-dissatisfying lunch, we were craving something delicious for dessert.  We should have just gotten some pie, but we opted for a peach cobbler.  Should have known not to go for peaches before peach season.  We ended up with a sad cobbler made of canned, soggy peaches.  The crumble wasn't crumbly and the peaches weren't.... peachy?  Probably the worst cobbler I've had.\\n\\nSo, I can't compare to Franklin, but I can say that I prefer Rudy's over Salt Lick.

He then bowed to her greatness, and rightly so, as she has created a true masterpiece.  \\n\\nTheir sticky buns are amazing.  Get yourself a glass of milk, sit down, take off your coat, and prepare yourself for an experience.  Pure heavenly bliss every bite!

But it wasn't until the days passed, and the craving for another one crept up that I knew they had created another masterpiece.  The sandwich has just the right taste and texture, I promise you will be back for more.  I have yet to find another Roast Beef Sandwich that even compared.  And their homemade sparkling raspberry drink compliments it perfectly.\\n\\nOther things of theirs I've tried is the Tomato Soup, and it's honestly one of the best I've ever had.

This is a very small area. Some of the tickets behind us were being filled before ours was, so we had to smoosh to one side to let the people behind us through to the counter. Then we had to smoosh the other way to let them exit the line. Orders were being taken much faster than the kitchen could cook, so the things that were being filled out of order were things that were already made (like pizzas, those seemed to be in constant assembly). That made me feel a little better about the temp of our sandwich, since they were having to cook new ones. \\n\\nThere is seating outside, upstairs, on an outdoor balcony, and in several seating areas downstairs. We bravely went upstairs through a narrow stairwell with our tray because I could see a few open tables up there - that was a mistake. The tables were being held for a group, so back down the narrow stairwell we went with our tray of hot food. We are lucky no one was trying to fight us for stairwell space; that area needs a traffic cop of sorts lol. We walked through a few dining areas looking for some sort of table, then hit the jackpot with the table we snagged! It was off by itself, near an air vent, with very little foot traffic going by us. We were surrounded by little details related to Pinocchio, but our area didn't have any of the big murals I noticed in the other rooms. The dividing wall behind me had stained glass in it, that was really cute. I wish I had taken photos but I was so hungry and tired by that point I just wanted to eat and take a break. When we go back I will definitely have to make up for it - and we will be back!"},{"name":"Stats","address":"300 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"We were in town for the SEC Championship game and wanted to find a fun place to have snacks and be able to enjoy the Atlanta vibe without feeling like a sardine.

However, maintaining an open mind, our experience was very disappointing.\\n\\nService: From beginning to end, our experience was less than mediocre. Even after having reservations (they weren't even busy to begin with) they seemed unorganized. When they gave us the three menus (there were four of us) we had asked to see the restaurant week menu which somehow was not put together with the regular menu. Our waiter's attitude seemed to change after we asked to see the restaurant menu and he proceeded to be rather aggressive practically dropping plates down in front of us. \\n\\nThe food: In our small group of 4. I chose the \\"rollatini di nico\\" which was an eggplant dish with ricotta, spinach and mozzarella. It was delicious but nothing to really rave over. For the main course I went with salmon while my boyfriend chose the prime sirloin (we shared our entrees). The main reason we chose to come here was that they offered a 16oz sirloin steak! However, his steak was ordered medium rare was so overcooked, dry, and bland that he couldnt even finish it. My salmon was average, nothing special. For dessert, I chose the cannoli while my boyfriend had the tiramisu which were like the rest of the experience here.. unimpressive.  \\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.

I luv ramen and the more good ramen joints the better, IMHO.\\n\\nOn to the review:\\nI liked the Char Siu Buns. I thought they were very tasty, the pork was juicy and charred just right.\\nThe ramen chicken broth was light, but fine.\\nThe veggies in the ramen bowl were also good (not great).\\nThe 3 times I ate here, my group and I were sat down in a relatively quick time.\\nNote: long waits is expected and I wouldn't give less points if I waited longer.\\n\\n2 out of the 3 times I ate here, the ramen noodles were under cooked.\\nOther people in my group also noticed this. It wasn't enough to stop me from eating the noodles, but it was a distraction.\\nAlso, the noodles they serve is mass produced, not home made. While most ramen joints in the Boston area does the same (exceptions: Yume and Gene's), this will always make the taste and rating for the noodles as average.\\n\\nDon't order the Mega Ramen. There's really nothing Mega about it, except it costs $4-5 more and you get a bigger bowl. Do you get more noodles? Maybe....No. More pork? Possibly....No. More veggies? Hmmm.....No. More soup? Yes! Yes, you get more soup!\\n\\nThe service is poor to average (but always nice).\\n0 out of 3 times, did I get my drink refilled without specifically asking, even when the waitress looked straight at the empty cup.\\nAnd when I did ask...\\"excuse me...excuse...excuse me, can I get some more water\\" did it get refilled. Yes...I ask 3 different waiters/waitresses.\\nI also asked for red chili powder (you know, the ones in the black pepper dispensers), and she brings out spicy hot sauce. Sure, ok. Cha-ching! $1.25 added to the bill...\\n\\nPersonally, I think the service is a training issue. I'm sure it can be fixed if management took some time to train the waiters/waitresses. All of them seemed very nice and had a positive attitude. They were just never around, or focused on something else.\\n\\nFinally, after the meal was all done, I didn't feel right a few hours later. I can't say that I got sick (I've gotten food poisoning before, and this was not that severe), but my stomach did bother me all night and the toilet was my best friend that night (let's call him John). John was nice and flushed my troubles away.\\n\\nWas Totto the reason John was my best friend? Maybe, maybe not, but watching one of the cooks repetitively wiping his plastic gloved hands on his jeans between handling all of the food for the entire restaurant... I'm sure that's not a good thing. I'm sure his jeans were clean at the start of the day, but after wiping his hands on them every 5 mins (subconsciously, I'm sure), they were definitely not clean by the end of the night.\\n\\nSorry about the OMGWTF review.\\nI really do want a new ramen joint in the Boston area, but like Eeny and Meeny said \\"You are not it\\"."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Just the facts:\\n\\nWhat I ate: Aroz Con Pollo: I really liked this dish.

Then again I don't think it would have mattered, but ultimately dessert kept me from ordering a blockade of Pambiche.  \\n\\nThe night started well enough.  We ordered a couple sangrias which were very tasty.  I can imagine having a few of these seated outside when the heat and humidity of summer arrives.  We'll be going back for happy hour sometime.  Sorry, back on task.  We decided to order an appetizer and had ordered the croquetas the first time we were there.  I remember them being pretty good, but instead of getting the jamon like the first time we chose to go with the pollo.  Well, the pollo croquetas had me wishing someone had invented a portable \\"FAIL\\" button that would alert other unsuspecting diners discretely to not order this.  I say discretely because I'd hate to tip off the kitchen and wait staff for fear of retaliation.  Anyone seen the movie, \\"Waiting\\"?  I didn't want anything special on my entree thank you.  So anyway, I recall the ham croquetas being a bit more firm in consistency, but the chicken ones were very mushy.  I kept sipping my sangria to take my mind off of it.\\n\\nMoving on.  I ordered the pollo criollo for dinner and I have to say that it was a good start to putting Pambiche back in the good graces of my taste buds.  The chicken was falling off the bone, very moist and flavorful.  I had the red beans and ham instead of the black beans and I think I like the black beans better.  However, just as I was starting to feel good about the place again they sucker punched me with the tostones that were served with my dinner.  Tostones are basically deep fried green plantain chips.  I love plantains...RIPE plantains and I love all things deep fried, but this had me asking WTF!?!  I'm lucky I didn't break a tooth trying to bite into one.  I quickly began thinking about dessert.  \\n\\nLa Banana Borracha!  The Drunken Banana...is by far one of my most favorite banana desserts to date.  It's a layer cake made with bananas and rum.  I took one bite of this sinful dessert and it was like Calgon taking me away.  All the bad from earlier in the meal was absolved by this amazingly sweet slice of bliss.\\n\\nSo as you can see I like this joint inspite of the few \\"fails\\".  The atmosphere is great, the staff is very friendly and helpful especially when it comes to answering questions about the food.  The sangria is good and at least one dessert is awesome, but for dinner I would recommend the Rabo Encendido which Sarah likes a lot or the Plato Cubano which I had on our first visit there.  Get the black beans...usually I like it when ham or any other pork product is introduced to the mix but in the case of the red beans...it doesn't make me weak in the knees.  Stay away from the pollo croquetas unless you like your baby food lightly deep fried.  Lastly, order dessert.  Although the Banana Borracha is the only one we've had there, I hear the mango tart is delicious.  Next time, I'm going to try the Aleman...a Cuban spin on German chocolate cake.  \\n\\nPambiche...I'm looking forward to the next time.  Perhaps you will win me over with more than just dessert and alcohol then.  \\n\\nA hui hou!"},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Surprisingly, there's no sign for this place, but it's located right next to Kale Me Crazy.

We ordered the chorizo + sweet and sour figs, spicy eggplant caponata, hanger steak, whipped sheep's cheese, and beef tongue. It is great that their menu changes so that you can try new dishes when you come back and dine with them. \\n\\nEverything was delicious! I was pleasantly surprised by the sheep's cheese. I'm normally not a huge fan of cheese, but this was really smooth and creamy (addicting with the bread they give you). I also enjoyed the eggplant, which is actually a cold dish. It was very flavorful and not too spicy at all. I've never had beef tongue outside of a Japanese BBQ place so it was great to try Barcelona's beef tongue. The outer edges were crispy but the tongue itself was very tender. \\n\\nAt the end of our meal we got the crepes as dessert. This was decent. I especially liked the chocolate sauce (dark chocolate!) and the ice cream, but thought the texture and taste of the actual crepe was just alright. \\n\\nOverall, food was amazing, the waitress and waiters were friendly, and the tapas cost about ~10 per dish.

After telling my story to many people and being told to put this on Yelp...Here it is.\\n\\nMy wife and myself ventured into the North End on Saturday May 14th as a treat the night before her sister was graduating from College.  At this time my wife was 7 months pregnant and she was craving Italian food so we lined up at 4pm to get into Giacomo's( they do not take reservations and open at 4:30pm) It was a warm day and standing outside for 30 minutes before the restaurant opened was tough on her but she was a trooper and stuck it out because it was a special night she had been looking forward to for quite sometime.\\n\\nWhen it got close to 4:30 the woman manager on duty came out side with her clip board and was taking the number of people per party.  We obviously told her two and she could see that my wife was pregnant when taking our information down.  When they started to let everyone in ( The place is very tiny)  we were next to go in but there was a table of 3 tucked in the corner so the manager let us know that the party of 3 behind us would scoot in first then we would sit at the table of two right next to them.  We did not have a problem as we figured they do this all the time and know how to maneuver around the tight quarters.  When we finally sat down I was about 6 inches from a wall and my wife had about 6 inches behind her before she would be hitting chairs with the gentlemen behind her.\\n\\nAs we were settling in the waitress told my wife she needed to get behind her seat to get to that table of three.  As my wife sat there 7 months pregnant with no room to move I could see she was getting uncomfortable. The waitress started to get irritated that she could not get around so I spoke up and said \\"I am really close over here and my wife is 7 months pregnant and cannot scoot anywhere\\"\\n\\nThe waitress got really mad and raised her voice in front of us and everyone and said \\"I CAN SEE THAT\\"  at this point the place started to get a little quieter as it is really small and everyone was looking around to see what was going on.  The nice couple next to us was trying to see how they can help us by possibly switching seats but at this point my wife was so embarrassed that she looked at me teary eyed and got up and walked out of the restaurant.\\n\\nThe kicker was that the waitress could careless that she did this and the people sitting next to us were more concerned.\\n\\nAfter I left to console my wife I went back in and told the manager about everything that had happened.  If you see someone that is pregnant or not able to move you should look to place them somewhere on the side where you do not have to reach around them.\\n\\nI know all the reviews on here rave about the food and I really wish I got to experience it but with everything that happened I would not go back there and they have left a very sour taste in my mouth.\\n\\nI know we are only one couple but many reviews speak of the rude workers and rushed pace which sooner or later will catch up to them."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"So my brother recommended this place...remind me never to take a recommendation from him again.

I got an enchilda combo with one beef and cheese enchilada with red sauce and one chicken and cheese enchilda with green sauce and a chile relleno.\\nFirst off the red sauce was totally missing something, something that makes acapulcos 100% better, even on a bad day. The shredded beef enchilada was totally bland, especially the beef, and parts of it were really dry. \\nThe chicken enchilada, I swear was missing a tortilla and was drowned in cheese, but the salsa verde was pretty good, and the chicken was in nasty chunks, and had that real nasty chickeny taste (you know what i mean) lol. \\nThe chile relleno...I dont even know where to begin. There was no beef inside, I think it was cheese..I am not too sure it was unidentifiable. The outside whatever it was coated in was all mushy and nasty, like breadcrumbs that were mixed with water or something. I really was quite disgusted. I barley even ate it.\\nThe beans they serve arent refried deliciousness they serve them whole and they are in some kind of sauce. They tasted like boston baked beans, like what they serve with hot dogs. ARE YOU SERIOUS???? And, no rice or tortilla chips to go with the meal. I asked for my sour cream and guac on the side and thy slopped it on the side on top of  a piece of lettuce. No I meant in seperate containers on the side, because iif you slop it on the side it melts and becomes useless, which it did. \\nI love love love mexican food and I was totally dissapointed by this place. It was definantly not a mexican in the back cooking. It tasted like it was like americanized mexican. Also, the service was horrible.

Our group of 8 showed up to a long line and a 2 hour wait. The hostess, Samantha, was an absolute sweetheart and gave some of the best customer service I've ever experience (I've worked as a hostess and can attest that she really went above and beyond her pay grade to accommodate the customer). She told us that we were more likely to be seated on the patio before we got a seat inside. She was right but still gave us a buzzer just in case something changed.\\n\\nThe atmosphere of this place is very authentic or at least I assume that's what Ireland feels like. The inside was dark, full of low light and dark wood. There were two stages in the main room for the live band and everything looked very comfortable. Outside, where we sat, it was a little chillier (very Irish) but still lovely. We sat at the table right next to the live band outside. It was rather loud and our table was not stable because the concrete was uneven. Although it was a little noisy sometimes, it was nice to listen to the band and clap along.\\n\\nThe food, though, was the true star of the evening. Since there were so many of us, we all got a different dish and passed them around so everyone got a taste. The salads are delicious though $5 to add chicken was a little steep. The Chicken Curry was phenomenal. The Seafood Medley was worth every cent and was very satisfying. The Garlic Fries are unique and perfectly seasoned. The Shepherd's Pie was hearty and had a little kick to make it both filling and interesting. Their meat is always cooked to tender perfection and their mashed potatoes are smooth.\\n\\nOur only problems stemmed from the long wait and the fact that the restaurant wouldn't split out check. We had to put 8 people's worth of food on one credit card (we are college students and that was not ideal for any of us).

However, when factoring in price , we dropped $350 for 2 people, and the fact that I spend $175 a person, well, never, except if it's my 15 year anniversary then it get's the two star and considered one, because at that price you should be wowed.  For the particulars, we arrived with no reservation because we just got out of the house and started driving, we usually end up eating at the bar because,well, that's how we roll pathetic planning.  We first went by Highland Kitchen but it was mobbed but the decided to head over to Main Street because I know some stuff has been popping over there.\\n\\nArriving with no reservations, hostess and a waitress who was helping us with drinks on the ramp were super.  Then got seats at the bar.  Cocktails, excellent. We went for the 6 course tasting menu because we thought that would knock our socks off, and thought, hell I could either get that electric guitar I've been pining for,forever, our do the foodie splurge.  I like to cook and have been all over the Boston food map, from Hammersley's, to Rialto, #9 Park, to the blue room when Frankenthaller was still there, etc, so I was fired up to be here because of the accolades but I cannot imagine that the chef/owner was in the kitchen that night.\\n\\n1st Course was presented as the Amuse Bouch,that I thought would not be the first course, but it was, thought it would have been a cool way to start, in the sense, you ordered the Six but I'm really going to give you the six and a half but was not to be.  It was fine.  I believe it was Swordfish collar, marinated, as a crudo, some smoked/cured salmon and some caviar,single bites, the swordfish was most tasty.  Second was blue fin tuna with some melon coins, good/buttery, melon nice foil but a little sinew left on the tuna made for an extra chew.  Then the striper with daikon broth and ribbon of daikon, fish was cooked perfectly,skin was left on, love fish skin,  but not this fish skin, it was rubbery, like it got poached, personally crisp it skin side down in oil, be done with it, but rubbery, this seems really wrong.\\nNext was rye flour pasta with boudin noir,  you would think the flavor profile would be good, something you want to be impressed with, but it was flat, no earthy anything from the boudin, and,for me, jury is still out on whole grain pasta.  We then had venison 2 ways, 2 or 3 slices of sausage, 2 or 3 small coins of meat, with what appeared to be and tasted like, I don't maybe mild Sirachha  type sauce in the middle decorating the plate.  The palate cleanser was the nicest suprise, apple/celery sorbet, apple on the front of the pallete, celery on the back, really nice.  It was served with the equivalent of fresh string cheese.  I don't really get it, but it tasted good.  2 deserts, that is one plate each of different deserts, the apple with crepe and sour milk ice cream was dissappointing,the crepe, seemed again of whole grain, and tasted like the whole wheat roll ups I use for the kids to get them to eat something health, the apple scattered on top, again fine.  My wife had something with chocolate, salt was sprinkled on it, pretty good, but seems hard to screw with good chocolate.   The bread had the it was made fresh in the morning but you got here late so deal with it 'bite' to the crust.  We waited something like 25 minutes between 2 courses.\\n\\n My expectations were high, at this caliber of restaraunt I would think that A) Flavor Profiles would be awesome something you could not do at home, this did not happen. B) Presenation/preparation would be flawless, this did not happen.\\n\\nI really wanted to love the restaraunt and experience but $175 per person, $350 all in, I know of a variety of restaraunts that would have been better at half the price so just disappointed.

Their menu is not very big in size, with some items that carry a punch and others that just aren't that memorable...and then there are those that you just want to forget like their version of the summer salad which contains romaine lettuce with lots of fruit and a blueberry dressing. Um...fruit in salad? Not a fan. My favorite thing to order is the baked brie appetizer. It is a small wheel of brie wrapped in delicate, crispy puff pastry and accompanied with a strawberry sauce, candied nuts and fresh fruit. It's soooo delicious. Among other things, the grouper sandwich and salmon salad are good choices along with sweet potato and yucca fries. Their freshly baked chocolate chip cookies are the perfect way to end your meal.

Everyone in the area has heard of it, and the long lines outside of the door beginning around opening time prove its greatness. They don't take reservations, but as long as you avoid the busy hours, you'll only be waiting outside for a little bit. This restaurant is cash only, which is a bit inconvenient, but there it an ATM within a two minute walk from the restaurant. The servers are incredibly passionate and knowledgeable and willing to help you figure out what to order. I think some people are a bit turned off by the 'quick pace' that the servers have - i will admit they are very quick and to the point - but that is very much needed at a restaurant as busy as this one. It's a very homey atmosphere and everyone is very kind. The restaurant is quite compact though, so I wouldn't recommend for large groups.\\nNow, onto the food. It's amazing. I've only tried a couple of things here, but I've never been disappointed in any of it. They have a regular menu and then specials on the wall and a great wine selection.

It had been suggested by a coworker who had actually never been before. My boyfriend decided on this place for my birthday dinner and I was not disappointed. \\nWe walked in right after work for an early dinner and the place had just opened. We were the only table for about 30 minutes, but then a few other parties arrived.  Which, by the way, I would not recommend bringing a party over 6 (which would even possibly be pushing it) because the restaurant is so small. About 12 tables in total. But I loved the cozy, intimate feeling that this provided. Also - remember - you're in the North End, these aren't giant family restaurants.\\nOur waiter was great and I wish I knew his name to give him his due praise! Attentive but not annoying. He also handled an awkward situation at our table, where he had brought over the appetizer right as I had gotten emotional (we won't get into why - but at no fault of my boyfriend's, I'll say!). He made light of the situation by blaming too much pepper in the dipping oil. Props to him for making me laugh!\\nFood was outstanding -- for an appetizer, we split the sausage and polenta cake with broccoli rabe and fontina foundue. Literally can't get over how good that was. So creamy and fresh. Boyfriend got the lobster ravioli special and I got the asparagus and truffle risotto special -- both delicious. Another reviewer mentioned about portion size. I did not find them to be outrageously small, though they were not oversized either. With the appetizer and my entree, I was contently full and did not even finish the risotto. Wine was typical by the glass prices in Boston -- around $9, and good selection. Waiter recommended the tiramisu, which was just as tasty as the other food. Even brought it out with a candle for my birthday, which was a lovely surprise.\\nWould highly recommend this place to friends, though might suggest going during the week as opposed to the weekend nights, as I'm sure it can get very crowded in there."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I haven't had any experience with the owner of this place..

Unfortunately, when the back of the house messes up, it makes the servers look bad.   I think she did what she could.  \\n\\nLast night was my second time visiting Escobar; the first time was neither good nor bad.  I never had an issue with the waiting staff, as they have been super nice.  My biggest issue is the wait time to get our food.  I understand there are growing pains in any new establishment.  So my friends and I decided to give it another try. \\n\\nTo start off the night, we decided to order the salmon chips.   The salmon chips ($12) were really good and full of flavor.  They are oversized potato chips with some smoked salmon on top, red onion, capers, and chipotle cream cheese but could've had a little more salmon for the price.   The cocktails were really good as well; we order the T.R.U Story ($12), which is a mixture of 1800 Silver, Grand Marnier, Sour, Pineapple, and Agave Nectar.  \\n\\nOn Tuesday nights, they have crab legs for $10 (the previous week it was $20).  We ordered our cocktails and entrees around 8:30-8:35 p.m.  The waitress delivered our cocktails around 8:50 p.m. (no fault of hers). Keep in mind there was only one other party in the entire restaurant at the time and maybe one or two people at the bar.  The waitress came to our table around 9:10 p.m., saying our crab legs will be out shortly.  She did state they had to re-cook the crab legs because the cook didn't like the way they came out.  At 9:30 p.m., we finally received our crab legs after waiting for an hour, and they were cold! Not lukewarm but cold.  The manager offered to have the cook make them over but waiting for over an hour; we were ready to go.   She did offer us a free round of drinks on this house.   \\n\\nI understand growing pains, but 15-20 minutes for a cocktail and over an hour for food is unacceptable especially when there is no one inside.  I would hate to go when if it ever gets crowded.  They need to get a handle on the wait time and how they handle the back of the house.  \\n\\nLastly, there needs to be a discussion regarding the prices.  Forget about free water; they only serve $3 bottle water.   The food and drinks are way too expensive. I love to support black businesses, but after my second visit, I probably won't return.    The establishment has a lot of potential and hopefully they can find a way to get through their growing pains."},{"name":"Antico Forno","address":"93 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"One friendly Italian eatery.

The bread they serve is really good, pillowy soft. Sausage was my least favorite, not like it was bad or anything, just average sausage. Coleslaw was good, but different from the usual slaw I get at bbq places, seemed like it was just cabbage in a watery sauce. \\n\\nOverall, the atmosphere is what really makes this place stand out.

Finally went a couple of weekends ago and was not disappointed at all. We were greeted with the friendliest of smiles and sat down at the bar. After looking at the menu, I was slightly surprised (I say slightly because I read in passing earlier in the day about some Vietnamese influence in Senegalese cuisine) to see a few items that clearly had a Vietnamese twist to them. I asked the waitress how that came to be and she replied that as both were French colonized the mixture of cultures is evident in Senegal, which has a large Vietnamese community. Hm...learn something new everyday I guess.\\n\\nA plate of toasted bread came out along with a dipping sauce that had hints of curry. We devoured this in seconds, not only because we were both starving but because the dipping sauce was highly addictive.\\n\\nI had to order the Nem, which is Teranga's version of the egg roll. This came with a nuoc mam (fish sauce) dipping sauce. I have to say if you replaced the beef with pork you might be able to have this egg roll in a Vietnamese restaurant. Ok, the texture of the wrapping was a little different. Instead of being a lighter fried wrapper it had a chewier, ricey tasting wrapper. Not that this was bad, in fact, it was very, very good. Any future trip to Teranga has to include an order of Nem.\\n\\nFor our mains, I went with the national dish (Thiebou Djeun) which is a herb-stuffed white fish served with jasmine rice and some root vegetables. The fish came out looking a little dry, and it did taste a bit overcooked. The flavors itself were good, but I think I was expecting some bigger flavors. I've never had Senegalese food before, so my expectations might have been wrong to start, but I was thinking bold, spicy flavors. The rice was nicely cooked and the portion was huge.\\n\\nAbby, who lately has been ordering a lot better (maybe luckier) than me, went with the Brochettes. This was grilled cubes of beef with yucca fries. Perfectly cooked beef with great flavors. She enjoyed the yucca fries a lot, but I thought they needed a little salt.\\n\\nWe weren't sure about dessert until our waitress described a rice pudding-esque one that comes with fruit. We both agreed that sounded fantastic and ordered it. The \\"sauce\\" of the rice pudding was very good and sweet and was complimented nicely with raisins and other chopped fruit. The \\"rice\\" was couscous and I wasn't a big fan of it, but Abby didn't mind it at all.\\n\\nService was very friendly and treated us great. Water was refilled in a timely manner, even though there were only two people working the entire restaurant. Some people had to wait because they had a large group (9 people I believe) but other than that it seemed like people were getting seated in a timely manner. Overall, I really enjoyed Teranga and want to come back to try other items. I do have to take half a point off because my fish was dry.

Only since Yelp doesn't use bullet points, I'll use asterisks, but please don't think of them as stars.\\n\\n* My margherita pizza from last night was so charred that I consider the crust burnt.  A little char is fine.  Inedible crust is not fine.\\n* The few times I tried the San Gennaro pizza, the center of the pizza was pretty watery.  (This was a while back, and may be why they are overcooking things now.)\\n* The place is disorganized when it's not busy.  It's complete chaos when they're slammed.  I once had to stand in line to order my food at the right register, then get back in line to pay at the left register.  And the two lines were merged a few feet away from the registers.  No one seemed to know what was going on.\\n* The original idea was for the place to be a takeout place, but the pizza is best eaten straightaway while it's still hot, so everyone understandably wants to eat at the restaurant.  (See note 1.)  You're lucky to get a seat, or even a place to stand and eat.\\n* This is a horrible place to have a party.  This isn't directed at Adam so much as every OTP tool who thought this place was the new Chucky Cheese and wants to have their kid's 7th birthday shindig in the Antico kitchen.\\n* Part of me is a little dismayed at eating in the kitchen.  On the one hand, I want to eat my pizza while it's fresh and hot.  On the other hand, I worry that they're violating some health regulation.  Well, this is less of a worry now that they have counters separating the ovens from the dining area, but still.  I remember eating pizza at the front communal table while someone was making dough at the worktable in the room.  That's just weird.\\n* Parking has historically sucked, but somehow they are now using the lot across the street.  Definite improvement.\\n* Prices are a bit high, though I understanding they are importing everything from Italy (including flour, salt, tomato sauce, and other exotic ingredients not found in America).  I know the Euro was pretty high, so I'll get over it if they make an effort to keep the quality up.   \\n* I'm not a Coke drinker, but I suspect the bottled Cokes are imported from Italy given their 8 oz size and $3 price.  (See note 2.)  If so, I'm kind of amused since Antico is like a mile from Coke's world HQ, but if that's what it takes to avoid HFCS nastiness, so be it.  Can anyone confirm?  \\n \\nAll that said, they've still served the best damn pizza I've had in my sad pathetic life.  Everyone who works there is friendly, and back before they got famous, I got to try their homemade limoncello at closing time.  3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.\\n\\nNote 1 - If you don't live too far away, you might consider getting your pizza to go, and then taking it home and broiling it in the oven for a minute or two or three.

The dipping sauces were just average, and after trying them once we didn't go back to them again (which is fortunate because we only had one chapatti...yes, I am stuck on that.)\\n\\nPutting that aside, I was actually really interested in the chicken tikka masala, which I use as a standard to compare all indian restaurants to. The chicken was so overcooked I couldn't even bite it in half. It tasted like it had been sitting in a vat all day. I ordered the sauce in mild because I don't like really spicy things, but the sauce tasted almost watered down and had absolutely no kick to it. Honestly speaking, it was the worst tikka masala I've tried, including the little packet of spices that you make yourself at home. The millionaire's curry with tilapia was the best out of everything we ordered - the tilapia was cooked perfectly and was tender and flaky, and the spiciness was tolerable. The only problem is that there were little pools of grease floating at the top of the curry, but I just stirred it all in and pretended that I didn't see anything. Potato cakes were pretty good, but verrryy spicy.\\n\\nI don't know if this was a weird fluke because I ordered for pickup on mother's day, but I think from now on I'll stick to The Clay Pit. :("},{"name":"Estelle's Boston","address":"782 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I came here with a friend. \\n\\nDecor & Ambiance\\nThe place was nicely decorated.

The pizza itself deserves a solid 4 stars but I'm giving it a 3 based on a total lack of customer service. The outside of the restaurant has little appeal and the word \\"pizza\\" isn't visible from the road on any of their outdoor signage, yet somehow they were packed on a Monday night. It's obvious to me that Antico survives by making every first-timer feel like an outsider with the expectation that you'll bring friends in for the same bizarre experience. The ingredients on the menu are tiny and hard to read, the cashier was reluctant to answer any questions I had about the pizzas and when I asked her about non-bottled water there was a smug indifference in her voice when she replied, \\"you can get it from the sink, but we don't provide ice\\". Having dined at pizza dives in Italy, I can see where they are drawing their elitist attitude, it's part of the culture. In a city smaller than Atlanta though, this place wouldn't last a year. \\n\\nIn summary: Give it a try, but read a few more reviews so you know what you're in for. If you can ignore the hype machine that is Antico, you're in for some pretty decent pie."},{"name":"Tapatio Mexican Restaurants","address":"18615 SW Farmington Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"We ordered a to go order so I'm not sure how the service is.

Maybe before I just went on a couple of bad nights. We've gone a few times since then and I found everything to be delicious and fresh! We almost ordered off the menu fearing the buffet wouldn't be as good, but glad we didn't. \\n\\nJust a couple of things I wish I'd see on the buffet: (1) some crumbled feta cheese would be nice to have with the herbs and bread. (2) I'd like better tahdig. (3) Rice with zaresk (sp?) would be nice to have. I know it's on the menu, but why not the buffet? Or, a little side dish of it to mix in with the plain rice would work too. Thanks!\\n\\n******************************************************************************************\\n\\nFirst, please let me give you a little background on myself. I am just a local white girl, but I have been married to a Persian man for over 10 years. In fact, our first date was at Taco Arriba in Northcross Mall, which was owned by the same guy who owns Alborz, and if anyone remembers, they sold Persian food in addition to the Mexican. I may not be able to pronounce the food, but I have eaten some of the best Persian food, including home-cooked meals made with love from my mother-in-law and I have learned to make a few dishes myself.\\n\\nWe have eaten at Alborz many times, but it saddens me to say that it used to be much better. I suspect if you order from the menu, the food will be delicious, but from the buffet, it is only mediocre at best. There were dishes that were really good, but others not so much. For example, the beef kabobs were thin and dry, and the chicken was dry  as well. I admit I'm not the biggest lamb fan, but mine tasted so bad I had to spit it out.\\n\\nI'm sure we will eat there sometime again, but it won't be the buffet. The atmosphere is fun - we like the belly dancers and TV's - although my husband said it seems weird to see skinny blonde dancers.\\n\\nLastly, we think if some competition came to town, Alborz would really have to improve things.

I was quite satisfied with the meal; fast food fish is always a calculated risk, but theirs came out firm and well cooked. The batter was thin and seemed authentic. The chips were, well, thick fries--nothing special, but good nonetheless.\\n\\nIn addition to F&C, there are chicken fingers for your squeamish kids and maybe a couple other things. And deep-fried candy bars--not touching that one. The room is small and not terribly atmospheric; in spite of the faux-wood paneling, there's no getting over the fact that you're at Downtown Disney.

This was the real-deal in terms of traditional, Italian margherita pizza. We had a calzone, pepperoni, and margherita between the three of us. It was all exceptionally good - while it was hot/warm. I lowered my rating to 4 stars only because once it was cold the crust was so chewy I couldn't cut it with my pizza wheel.

I ordered a caesar salad and it was full of chunks of the butt of the romaine, which was disappointing.  Both myself and my co-worker ordered the shrimp and scallops, but with different sauces.  When our entrees were brought out by a food runner, they both had the same sauce.  The runner said she would leave the entree for me to pick at while they quickly re-made it correctly.  I thought this was nice as they would just end up throwing it out anyway.  My happiness was short lived tho, as she quickly came back and removed it, with little to no explanation.  Our server came out a few minutes later with the corrected entree, saying that she did enter it correctly and was sorry.  The meals were both good and we opted to get our dessert to go, in separate bags.  Again, a runner brought out stuff out, and it was only in one bag.  I'm all for teamwork in the workplace, but two errors could have been avoided if our waitress had been the one handling the delivery of the food.  Overall, I wouldn't rush back..

Once inside, you're herded to a tiny table in a large, bustling room, overwhelmed by music, chatter and normal restaurant din.  Staff was attentive and friendly however I was taken back by the deer-in-the-headlights reaction when I asked for the fried chicken, biscuits and gravy--but the chicken on the SIDE (to avoid getting gravy on it). She said she'd ask the kitchen what they could to accommodate!? Just put the chicken, I dunno, on the side?? Things were awkward until I suggested putting the GRAVY on the side to accomplish the same objective. That apparently registered and she seemed relieved. Now for the food. The fried chicken breast was moist and tender and the breading was seasoned and cooked well. A+! The biscuits were disappointing but probably a solid \`B-\`; I just had my hopes up for hearty, salty, steamy and buttery, but no such luck. The gravy was okay but very thin.

He called and made a reservation for 9pm, and though we arrived five minutes late, we were greeted pleasantly by the woman at the hostess stand. She asked if I wanted a high or low table, and I chose a high table near the bar (I liked having the option!). She was great; that was the last good service of the night.\\n\\nWaitress was bored and uninterested in being there, serving us, and/or life in general. She asked if I wanted anything to drink, I asked her if the bar does mojitos, she said no, and when I told her I needed a few minutes to think, she just kind of shrugged and walked away. Would have been better if she had provided some recommendations or specials from the drink menu. \\n\\nI lied -- the bussers, who brought the bread, refilled our water, and cleared our plates, were also friendly and professional. Good service there, too. \\n\\nBread was good, not fantastic, but good. Pesto oil dip was really good. Volartini on the rocks was very well made, both times (often I find the second drink is a weaker, less-good version of the first). Lobster ravioli was delish IMO; my boyfriend wasn't crazy about it. Caesar salad was just fine - needs more croutons! They were so flavorful I could have eaten a whole bowl just of croutons (my minds telling me no... but my bodyyyyy is telling me yessssss!).\\n\\nPizza was a huge disappointment. I ordered the caprese pizza, which I assumed would be like a caprese salad, with tomato, fresh mozzarella, and basil. Ordered extra mozzarella (see any number of my other reviews for my explanation on my affinity for all things cheese), thinking it would be balls of fresh mozz. The pizza comes out -- good size -- SOGGY from all of the olive oil, covered in cheese but not an ounce of fresh mozz in sight. I even asked the server \\"this is the caprese..???\\" and he confirmed. Flavor was just okay. Skipped dessert and went elsewhere for drinks. Also forgot to mention their menu does NOT match what's online -- my boyfriend specifically wanted lobster mac and cheese (listed online) but it was nowhere to be found on their actual menu.\\n\\nVolare is fun if you are a local and you want to have a few drinks at a fancier-than-average place sitting at the bar.

The place is actually kind of cool, you walk in and walk down the stairs to the hostess and its a giant place that feels different, as you can tell I don't really know how to describe it so I'm rambling. \\n\\nAnyway the late night menu consists of cheese selections as well as pork cold cut selections from certain parts of the pig. We got the pig head, pig shoulder, a few more selections, but I couldn't stop eating those two, hence the amazing memory. For cheese, we just got Manchego and it suited the cuts wonderfully. The plate is served with pickles and mustard, which was too spicy for both of us, but it definitely melts in your mouth if you have a piece of bread on the bottom. \\n\\nAfter the plate we also got the salty pig pizza! THIS THING WAS DELICIOUS! I am not a pizza person, trust me, it never really is my first choice, I am selective about my pizza. I prefer thin, crispy and decadent slices. Generally I only get pizza from The Uppercrust in Brookline, but I think the salty pig pizza might give it a run for its money! The pizza was made in the brick oven and we could see it from the table being handle with such loveee. The pizza came with arugula and just the right amount of cheese. \\n\\nI will definitely be back for the pizza as well as other times of the day to try out some more items!

Much like other reviewers, we were on the way to the Aquarium which is across the street. Had noticed a long line on Sunday for breakfast and we went Monday morning when it was not so crowded. Nine of us including 5 kids. Ernie, one of the owners, met us at the door and put together a bunch of tables for us. The kids went for the carbs, huge stacks of pancakes with bacon and they tried but couldn't eat all of them. Sometimes, when they get so fluffy you can taste the baking soda but these were perfect.The coffee was great. I think we surprised our waitress by how many cups we drank ( serve bigger cups :)) We had the omelette and it was a large with over three eggs. My wife was on the perpetual diet and Ernie made a special dish for her. The staff was relaxed and smiling and the place had a great vibe, its nice when the owner is everywhere and the staff cares. We would go back.\\n    Oh yeah, the parking is at a premium, maybe eight spots. We were able to walk from our hotel, the Omni, but you may need to park in the lots around the aquarium.

Living in Los Angeles, where stellar customer service is generally a given, I've forgotten what snooty wait staff can be like. \\n\\nWe were lucky to score one of the best seats in the house upon walking in, without a reservation, around 9:30pm on a Friday. Our table was by the window seat, sort of separate from the rest of the restaurant -- private and romantic. The downside is that we waited about 20 minutes for our drink order to be taken, and waiters tended to zoom around, being hard for us to flag down. The one that finally took our order (our wait staff kept changing) seemed a bit condescending. \\n\\nWe ordered:\\n- Poutine (when in Canada, do as the Canucks :). It was delicious, but French Fries and blue cheese are pretty hard to mess up! The Poutine reminded me of Chili-Cheese Fries back home in the States (even though there's no meat in Poutine) -- this is the sort of bar food/diner fare which I don't really associate with an upscale restaurant. The portion was way too huge for 2 people; I probably would have gotten more food if we hadn't ordered this as an appetizer. Still, I'm glad that I got to try my 1st Poutine at an establishment of Chambar's culinary caliber \\n\\n- \\"Octopus a la Peruvien\\". This was Prince Charming's selection. He loves octopus, orders it everywhere, and said this was one of the best he's had, ever! But the portion was minuscule, with the Octopus sliced paper thin. Good thing we were both pretty full after starting with the Poutine!\\n\\n- Boeuf et Morilles (despite the name, this dish actually had Chanterelle mushrooms instead of Morels), with onion rings and pine nuts. When it finally arrived, there were 5 bight-sized pieces of beef atop small Onion Ring & candied Chanterelle \\"towers\\". This is definitely a very creative and original dish, and pretty tasty! But again, a teeny-tiny portion (yes, I'm aware that \\"Petits Plats\\" means \\"small plates\\" in French, but I'd have to argue that these were \\"Plats Minuscules\\"). \\n\\nI'm sorry that Prince Charming and I didn't get to try more of the minuscule dishes, or the enticing desserts, but we were full after the ginormous Poutine. \\n\\nIn summary: excellent food, but tiny portion/price ratio and snooty, inconsistent service. If we return to Vancouver we might give this place another try, but there are many other interesting places with (hopefully) less attitude."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I LOVE this place.

He was good but a little clumsy, he dropped a few things and threw rice around a lot. But the show is only part of the experience so I didn't mind. The food is why you're here, and it's good, but not great, our steak was supposed to be medium rare, it was medium well, mainly because it was thin and cooked faster than he could catch on.

I love pig ears, I love poached eggs, and I'm down with organic and local and Cambridge and yadda yadda yadda.  But I've been to Craige 7-8 times now, and its never lived up to the first time I went (when it was Criagie St. Bistro), and I'm tired of making excuses for Tony Maws and co.  They do serve some outstanding dishes, but it's just too expensive to serve mediocre food, and they serve lots of it.  \\n\\nBefore I get to the negatives, let me just say that we've had some great food at Craige.  We went once and had the 10 course chef's tasting menu, and the first course was this unbelievable 3 bites of seafood with oysters, octopus and squid salad.  Amazing.  Also had their goat cheese cheesecake for dessert which rocked my world, and a fried pig ear's salad that was rich and delightful.  So there's plenty to like, for sure, and I can remember plenty more great dishes.  \\n\\nBut there's just too many negatives to live up to its rep and its price.  Couple examples: we went once and had the roast chicken dinner for two.  That should be a softball a place like Craigie, but the chicken had this unappealing thyme jus and the potato side dish was not good (i think it was something like au gratin, how do you mess that up?).  Another: just went for brunch, and the scallops and grits was just too much fat and a strange combination of flavors.  A friend had the ham and cheese panini which was oddly gross.  It had this piquant flavor in the ham that left a very unappealing aftertaste in your mouth.  Finally: that 10 course chef's tasting menu - by course 5, we felt bloated and ready for bed.  Literally didn't eat the last 2 courses.  I mean I know 10 courses is decadent, but EVERY COURSE had loads of butter/duck fat/pigs ears/pulled pork/etc and its was just too much.  Trust me: I love all those things.  I'm the guy that has 5 lbs of duck fat in his freezer from the last 2 batches of turkey leg confit.  But 10 courses of that and even I feel like death.  It was just a poorly designed meal and for the price was not at all worth it.  \\n\\nSo go to Craigie if you must and order that amazing burger with bone marrow, or just have the pigs ear salad at the bar.

I did try some of the sweet sauce on the plantains, it was good - but certainly didn't enhance the flavor of the dish.  Neither did the other sauce.  Per my husband (who is Cuban and Puerto Rican) the traditional Puerto Rican/Cuban doesn't add extra sauces to dishes.\\n\\nPambiche is a fun, vibrant, clean place!  The music really transports you to Cuba.  The d√©cor is bright and really adds to the experience.\\n\\nI wanted to try the desserts, but didn't leave room.

The waitress said that no, another party was sitting there and we had to sit at the counter.  But wait, I thought we would get \\"first available\\" and that table was first available.  Yes, well these other people would only sit at a table.  So even though we had been waiting longer, we had to sit at the counter while the other people, who arrived after us, got to sit at a table.

While this may be true, I've been spoiled on eating many a breakfast in various Gloucester coffee shops, which by themselves are on a whole different level. \\n\\nI had the Stephy's omelet that included bacon, sausage, cheese and veggies and came with homefries and toast. It was okay at best. The sausage had a very weird taste to it, like no other sausage I had tasted before, and made me think of toxins and chemicals, yet strangely enough I ate it anyway. The omelet itself must have been a 3-egg as it was very thin. The best part about it were the veggies because they tasted very fresh and very good. \\n\\nMy girlfriend did not really enjoy her meal of pancakes with glazed apples on top, bacon, two eggs and homefries. She has pickier taste than I as she prefers her bacon to be chewy and Stephy's automatically does theirs crispy. She was also hoping the apples would be fresh and mixed into the pancake batter, but instead they seemed to have come right out of a can onto the pancakes, much to our dismay. However, the pancakes themselves were fluffy and tasty.\\n\\nThe homefries were average and the coffee was typical diner joe. Stephy's only allows for one coffee refill and my girlfriend and I agreed that was pretty lame. There were some breakfast specials posted that looked good, although one was an omelet with bacon, sausage, ham and cheese with homefries, toast and coffee priced at $9.65. Compared to my Stephy's omelet that came with homefries and toast combined with my coffee, the special was $2 more. I am still trying to grasp that pricing scheme. \\n\\nOverall Stephy's prices are the best I've seen for breakfast fare. The place was busy with a bit of a line, but the tables opened up quickly. I did like the long counter with stools for patrons to eat at, as I consider myself a counter man as opposed to table eating when it comes to my breakfast. \\n\\nAgain, if you don't mind the drive and you want superior breakfast, go to Gloucester.

NO WAY. That's just an objective fact. I've seen people get wedgies that required medical attention for trying to pull crap like yours at Professional Food Critics School. But hey, congratulations, you have a free account on Yelp, you know how to type, and the fry cook rejected your sexual advances. I'm really sorry about that. NOW STOP CRYING BECAUSE THE TEARS ARE IMPEDING YOUR GUSTATORY ABILITIES!\\n\\nOh, I'm sorry, were you completely flabbergasted that a place called Little Big Burger would serve up a burger that might be considered \\"little\\" according to some metrics? I mean, who saw that coming? Okay then, let me let you in on a secret: there are other places in town to buy physically larger burgers. Failing that, you can order an off-menu option called BUY A SECOND BURGER, GENIUS, IT WON'T BREAK THE BANK.\\n\\nAnd hey, no offense intended to those for whom it would break the bank. Except that, let's be honest, those people aren't eating here. You want a truly cheap burger? Then odds are you aren't trolling Division St. west of, oh, I don't know, DAIRY QUEEN, are you? And no disrespect to DQ, BK, McD's, or any of the other fast-food joints so familiar that I don't need to type out their full names. Sometimes you want that. More frequently, I do not. Which is why I come here. For something better. It's the free market at work, Adam Smith's invisible hand making burgers JUST THE WAY HE WOULD'VE WANTED IT.\\n\\nIs it the best burger in town? No. Don't be stupid. Remember when I was talking about Adam Smith, like, a paragraph ago? Yeah, so, there are places where you can get WAY MORE EXPENSIVE BURGERS than what Little Big Burger serves up. Odds are, at least one of those $10+ burgers is superior to LBB's offerings in the same way that a $10 bill is superior to a $3.75 bill -- which, yes, Mr. Numismatist, I realize doesn't actually exist, but that happens to be the cost of a Little Big Burger cheeseburger.\\n\\nSo if you need to find the best burger in town, go somewhere else. Please. Because your whining hurts my ears when I'm enjoying my bacon-chevre burger (minus ketchup, add mustard), and that's something of a feat because, yeah, the music in there can be VERY LOUD. That's how much your whining grates.\\n\\nOkay, let's sum things up. Here's what you need to remember: LBB serves up small but excellent fast-food burgers.\\n\\nOkay, I can see you need a FAQ.\\nQ: Are they large burgers?\\nA: No, they are not. I'm not a small guy, but I frequently find just one burger is enough, with the fries -- which, in addition to being SUPERB, are also copious, and therefore filling. But sometimes my wife and I will split three burgers between us (and, again, one order of fries; that's all anyone needs, I promise).\\n\\nQ: Are they gourmet?\\nA: No, they're just very good. Good brioche buns. Good ketchup (and this coming from a guy who kind of hates regular ketchup). You know, tasty. But, you also know, served in a place with bright fluorescent lights and a long counter -- this isn't Castagna, in case that wasn't glaringly obvious (cf. earlier in this sentence where I mentioned the fluorescent lighting, and note my clever use of the word \\"glaringly\\").\\n\\nSHEESH, PEOPLE!"},{"name":"Tube","address":"18 NW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I went on a Saturday night and there was not many people there but they had good music.

I've been on it once and that was enough for me because I am not a huge fan of The Simpsons. When it was Back to the Future, I never missed riding it. However, when they changed it, all they actually did was slap some new paint on it and change the movie which is played during the ride. In my humble opinion, they should have kept it as Back to the Future. \\n\\nThe Beetlejuice show and The Horror Make-Up Show both should definitely NOT be missed! The Beetlejuice show is much more fun at night because of the pyrotechnics. If you're looking to cool off from the sweltering Florida heat, then step into the Horror Make-Up Show; the temperature is always kept very low in the theatre and it's a very nice reprieve from the heat. Both shows are so great; I've seen them multiple, multiple times! \\n\\nOne thing that is wonderful about Universal is you can by a souvenir cup for about $6 filled with your choice of soft drink and continue refilling it for about $.79 cents at either Universal or Islands of Adventure. Also, hang on to this cup because even if you don't return for years down the road, you can still use the same cup for the unbeatable refill deal! \\n\\nI can't speak highly for any of the food which is served inside the Park. It's expensive and not very tasty. If you just want a snack, the pretzels with cheese sauce are very good; however, if you are wanting a meal, then pop out to CityWalk and enjoy a meal at one of the many wonderful restaurants there; you can always head back into the Park when you are finished with your meal. \\n\\nAll in all, you'll have a good time and you won't regret going. It's definitely a fun time!"},{"name":"Bamboo Sushi","address":"836 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My go to sushi place!!! Why 4 stars not 5??? Because the service is sloooooow.

From the time we ordered, to the time it was brought to us, it took 65 minutes!! \\n\\nWe ordered the green chicken curry, which was delicious. We also ordered a vegetarian stir-fry, which was cold. Eating cold food at a place that barely seems to be holding it together isn't the safest thing (cleanliness) so I didn't touch the stir fry. If I weren't paying with a shoppingspree.com voucher, I wouldn't have paid for it. \\n\\nThere were several other tables full of very unhappy people. I saw people chasing down the staff to ask where their food was. There were a few people that got very upset at the staff. And every time some food would come out, they would walk from table to table asking who ordered whatever they were carrying. \\n\\nIf this place was even decent, we'd be back for the curry and the outdoor seating. No way we'll be going back.

Are you willing to spend at least $50 for it? Well if you said yes, this place has your answer. \\n\\nIt is highly recommended that you make a reservation since this place is not a really big restaurant. Even changing the reservation from two people to three was a little difficult because we would have to go at a later time, which indicates how popular this place is. \\n\\nWe arrived at our table, and we were told that we will have the Chef's Whim menu. This menu is a surprise, and it is whatever the chef will make. They provide a note card and a pencil to write down what the servers explain to you and in case you want to remember what you ordered here. We ordered a four course version, which consisted of the following:\\n\\nBluefish with a rice cracker served in a small dish.\\nKampachi sashimi with a Harissa rose vinaigrette, red onion shiso salsa and avocado puree. \\nTautog Cape Cod Fish with red Quinoa Puree, Peeky Toe Crab and Jerusalem Artichokes. \\nSirloin with Bok Choy, oxtail pastrami, and a creamy potato puree.\\n\\nThe first two dishes were extremely small, but presentation was impressive. I ate the bluefish in one bite. The texture of the fish combined with the crunch of the cracker made this a great snack. The sashimi was tasty and the avocado gave it a nice flavor. The Tautog was fantastic. Every bite had a great texture combined with a nice rich flavor. It was very freshly cooked and I really liked the Quinoa Puree. If I had two of those Tautog dishes combined with a generous large scoop of rice, it would have been a hearty, but very delicious and excellent meal I would not mind eating often for dinner. The Sirloin was also fantastic, and shows that steak and bok choy can make a great and tasty combination. The beef was juicy, tender, flavorful, but most importantly, really tasty. The texture of the bok choy was just right, and the potato puree was a great complement to the sirloin. \\n\\nWe got a variety of desserts, which included flan, a couple thin strips of chocolate, and an ice cream dish mixed with brownies and peanuts. The ice cream was all right, it was a little melted, but the brownies and the nuts were good. The flan though was probably the best dessert. The desserts were able to make our stomachs significantly fuller than before.  \\n\\nThe four course Chef's Whim menu, combined with a couple rolls of bread, a dessert dish, and a glass of fresh drinkable water, should be enough to feed one person as a light but almost moderate dinner, especially if one had a really heavy lunch several hours before coming here. \\n\\nService was actually really good. The server was really nice, patient, professional, and very knowledgeable about the dishes. One of the bartenders happens to be a classmate who went to my high school, so it was cool to see her again after eight years. I was surprised she even recognized me and we talked a little bit. Interior looks casual so I guess my recommendation is that you can wear jeans, but wear a nice buttoned shirt with a collar. It also gives a slight feeling that you are almost in a large living room rather than a restaurant. \\n\\nOverall, this place probably has one of the tastiest light dinners I had in Cambridge so far. This place is a worthwhile visit if you have a good amount of money to spend for a light dinner with an impressive presentation and good service. This place may have a legitimate chance to be the best restaurant in Cambridge and one representation of some of the finest restaurants in the somewhat decent State of Massachusetts."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Uh this place was a roller coaster of (mostly good)emotions...overall had a fantastic time here thanks to our lovely servers Cynthia and Ryan and the company of great friends, but it was an interesting journey.\\n\\nMy awesome brother and his girlfriend brought us here to celebrate my husband's birthday and the end of our honeymoon. We had a reservation at 8:45 PM on a Friday night but were seated almost an hour late. Brad, the host, was very apologetic and set us up with some sangria, a delicious cocktail (whiskey root?), and a charcuterie board when we were seated. Complimentary champagne toast too! We then ordered the gambas (~5 shrimp), jamon and manchego croquetas (4 pieces), spicy mussels (big bowl), and chorizo with sweet and sour figs (probably good for 2-3 people). All 4 were delicious and filling. The mussel shells looked normal sized but the actual mussels were the smallest I've ever seen. Shrug. Just a note for you yelpers who like details.\\n\\nWe also ordered a 1 serving order of seafood paella as is and a 2 serving order of seafood paella modified for food allergies. Cynthia was great taking our order and repeating it back so I know she wasn't the one who messed this up...When the paella came out ~45 min later, it was 3 portions of the modified version (not a big deal by itself), but also SO overly salted. We took a few bites out of hunger but ended up drinking a lot of water to counteract the intensity.\\n\\nBut sometimes for great things to happen, bad things gotta happen first. We received a grilled hangar steak tapa for our troubles and also some grilled calamari/octopus? and mussels that were intended to make up for the serving of seafood paella that was not supposed to be modified. We LOVED the grilled calamari/octopus. Apparently it's off menu, but you can ask for it.\\n\\nWe ended the meal with a beautiful dessert board courtesy of the restaurant (I think for the multiple special occasions we were celebrating). There was a hazelnut lava cake thing, a lemon-y panna cotta with raspberries, a flan, and some crepe-like things. My favorite was definitely the flan. I don't even like flan!

I killed it anyway... savage style. with coffee stirrers as chopsticks... it was tough. so i shifted  using my hands.  I know. gross. BUT really worth it.  i was drooling for it. And i was lazy to call for a fork at 4am. \\n\\nI paired this with their cheapest chardonnay..and it worked.\\n\\n*Spinach Porpadelle: This was on the Specials board. It came with grilled pork tenderloin and portabello mushrooms in a plum tomato sauce with crumbled goat cheese. I said goat cheese. Any pasta with goat cheese is already an Oomph.

We ordered by the pound and had pork ribs, brisket, sausage, & chicken.  For sides, had potato salad and cole slaw.  The sides were good, but nothing out of the ordinary from any other restaurant.  In terms of the bbq, my absolute fave was the sausage; it had so much flavor...it didn't even need bbq sauce.  In tie for 2nd place was the brisket & pork ribs.  I drenched them both with the delicious BBQ sauce (best sauce ever!...not too salty, perfect consistency (not too watery or thick), & slight vinegar flavor).  There were 2 choices of bbq sauce (original & spicy...both were good, but since i like spice, I stuck with the spicy bbq)  I personally like my brisket lean and Salt Lick has very lean cuts of brisket.  If you like your meat fatty, you might not like the brisket here.  Downside of lean meat is that it can be drier, but when you drench it in bbq sauce, you wont' notice any sort of dryness.  I wasn't too much a fan of the chicken...the breast meat was dry and it wasn't as flavorful as the other cuts of meat...even w/ the bbq sauce on it.  And best of all, at the end of the meal, it only came out to be about 10 dollars/person (prior to tip).

I haven't had okonomiyaki in Japan, so I can't speak to the authenticity, but it was nice and crispy and flavorful! \\nThe ramen here is awesome as well! The chicken truffle sea salt ramen (which according to our server is less salty than the soy sauce version) is a must-try. I have had a lot of bowls of ramen in my life, so when I see an interesting twist on the classics, I have got to try it. This bowl is perfectly portioned (generous but not stomach-exploding) and you can smell the truffle flavor as soon as the bowl gets to the table. The broth still tastes like a classic broth with just the right hint of truffle. The pork chashu is great here, and the soft boiled egg is done perfectly. \\n\\nThe service here is some of the best I've ever had. Everyone is so nice and takes care of customers so well.

Cafe Yumm has become one of my go-to eateries on campus, especially before I work in the evenings. Some people don't like the Yumm sauce and I think I understand. It isn't a super conventional taste nor is it especially exotic. It is a very mixed flavor and I love that it is neither extremely \\"out there\\" nor too boring. My favorite changes. All the bowls are delicious and come with the toppings of dice tomatoes, olives, avocado, cheese, and a dollop of sour cream - changeable upon request. Service is fast and the cashiers are pretty friendly. It's a good place to relax before work or class, for someone who enjoys relaxing in ambient noise and not complete silence. There's always at least a table, so I can eat there and get a little bit of work done. \\n\\nTop 3 bowls for me: Chilean Zucchini, Edamame, Smoky.\\n\\nI haven't tried their other foods aside from the teriyaki chicken plate. The teriyaki is too salty for me and not worth the price. I give Yumm 4/5 because their Yumm bowls might be their only selling point, and the fact they raised the prices of the bowls a year or so ago (while the Cafe Yumm by Pioneer stayed the same, as of a few months ago)."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Somewhat reminiscent of the soup Nazi from Seinfeld, only the Italian version and less extreme, yet just as in the Seinfeld episode, it's well worth standing in line for.

Three-cups of French Press for $5 is the best coffee deal I've found in Austin. I seriously thought about ending this review right here, but that would be a little short even for me.\\n\\n2. I couldn't care less about wine or beer. But if you do, they offer over two dozen wines by the glass and/or bottle, and a dozen different beers by draft, pitcher, or buckets of bottles.

It was pretty busy and we had to wait in line for a little bit. The menu was confusing because I did not understand what a lot of the words meant, so we randomly ordered the Gigiotto and the Capricciosa. We also had trouble finding seating because everyone was spread out in such a way that no three seats were together. After finally finding a seat, we waited about 10 to 15 minutes for our pizza to arrive, which was not a bad wait time at all considering how many people were there.\\n\\nThe Capricciosa pizza was really difficult to eat. The sauce was really watery and the pizza would drip every time I picked it up to take a bite. I ended up having to fold it to get it in my mouth without making a mess. Because it was so watery, the dough tasted like a soggy mess and I couldn't really enjoy the flavor of the artichoke or mushrooms.\\n\\nAfter being disappointed with my first slice of pizza, I was placing all my hope in the Gigiotto. However, after picking up a slice, I noticed that most of the crust was burnt black. Now I'm not that picky on things being slightly burnt, but this was burnt to the point where it tasted like I was eating ash. I didn't really like the taste of the broccoli rabe either and it kept getting stuck in my teeth. The cheese was very chewy and not easy to bite through, possibly because the pizza had already gotten cold by that point (even though it had arrived only 10 minutes previously).\\n\\nAltogether, I came in with high expectations based on the reviews here on Yelp and I was sadly disappointed.

I only wish that it was as good warmed up the next day as it is when they bring it to you. The second time, my boyfriend and I split the Lime Leaf Triangles, Mix and Match Spicy Eggplant and Duck, and the Pad Mee.

Barcelona Wine Bar is located in Inman Park and is a more elegant option if you're looking for a restaurant that serves tapas and drinks. We ordered the white wine sangria, champagne (celebrating a birthday!) as well as several tapas. They serve tapas as the chef prepares them, so it's good to order several tapas so you don't have to wait around for your food to arrive. \\n\\nI tried the patatas bravas, which are diced and fried then topped with a creamy aioli and served under a bed of warm tomato sauce. The potatoes were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside - it's definitely a fun tapas to start with! We also tried the mushrooms a la plancha - mushrooms marinated in a garlic and shallot confit and topped with tomatoes - as well as the eggplant tapas. The eggplant came steamed, it seemed like, and sat under a bed of a white yogurt sauce. We also got the gambas al ajillo, which is shrimp that's marinated in sherry, garlic, herbs, oil and butter. This was delicious and left a great sauce to dip the remainder of your bread into. The white wine sangria is delicious - we heard it's a popular drink, so our table ordered two pitchers to share. Keep in mind this is pretty sweet, fruity, and the wine flavor is not super prominent. My friends ordered the seafood paella and seemed to enjoy it.\\n\\nWhen the servers found out we were celebrating a birthday, they brought out a wooden board with two crepes, ice cream and a flan for the table - a really friendly gesture and a yummy trio of desserts. Overall, food was enjoyable and I'd come again to try other tapas or dishes. At times, the servers seemed like they wanted to rush our table out - strange, considering the restaurant wasn't too busy when we stopped by. I wasn't sure if it was their service just being super attentive, wanting to clear our dishes and continually asking if we were done eating, but it came across as a bit excessive. Other than that, the experience was good and the restaurant is in a great location as well. I'd probably come again. 3.5 stars for me."},{"name":"Terramia Ristorante","address":"98 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Real, homemade pasta. Can you feel the difference?

For the starter, we were served with warm bread and delicious butter. For the appetizer, my boyfriend had the tomato soup, and I had the salad. They all tasted really fresh and delicious. (However, the waiter brought out our main course before we finished our appetizer, which makes us feel like being rushed a little) For the main course, we both had the filet, and I added the lobster tail for additional $17. The filets were cooked perfectly but the plating didn't look as nice or tasted any special, and the lobster tail didn't taste fresh. For the sides, we chose the creamed spinach and upgraded one of our side for the sweet potato casserole. I've never had sweet potato casserole, and i must said that it tasted amazing!! This was the only dish that made me feel WOW! (It somehow made me feel like I'm eating cream br√ªl√©e) Lastly, for the dessert, we both had the warm bread pudding with whiskey cream sauce and some berries on the side. The fruits were sweet, and the bread pudding tasted good. \\n\\nOne thing that I don't appreciate is \\"pay at the table\\" where the waiter carried a hand held machine that made you tips in front of him.

Additionally, the waiter came to swipe our cards while we were having our dessert, which was very awkward and feel like being rushed. \\n\\nOverall, hoping the service could pay more attention and don't rush their customers.

I told him that I have been to Strega in the North End and love it and so I wanted to try this. The interior is very modern and interesting. Very roomy not crowded. I liked the feel. We were dying from our walk over and the heat so we didn't want to sit outside. We had them sit us inside but with an outside view. All that was between us and the people eating outside was glass. I liked that. \\n\\nI'm not going to lie. The food was absolutely delicious! They were very attentive throughout the entire meal. They brought drinks and the bread basket which was nice and full and the oil with the olives is such a treat. We ordered the scallops sauteed in Grand Marnier for an appetizer. Those were stellar! A friend ordered the Calamari and said it was a tad bland. Strega if you are reading these posts, change the Calamari or offer it both ways. I have dined at several places that use an aioli rather than marinara and they drizzle it on top of the calamari. Much better. Send someone out to Rustic Kitchen or Sofia to try their Calamari which I feel has a little something extra! \\n\\nMy entree was a special. The Chilean Seabass. This was delicious! It came with parmesan mashed potato and 2 huge pieces of asparagus, an orange pepper and a small zucchini that were tied together. You had to pull it off this little skewer thing. Really good. I was looking to eat healthy so I accomplished my goal. My friends had the Porterhouse steak with those mashed potato and veg and the other had surf and turf. This was pricy $68. Wow! My chilean sea bass was about $42. I think the porterhouse was about $39. The Scallops were $19 and the Calamari $13. The Calamari looked plump and fresh, I didn't have any but my friend told me that it was bland. I told her to dredge it in the Grand Marnier sauce from my scallops. for dessert I had Creme Brulee. It was delicious as usual. They put a swirl of some type of raspberry sauce or something on the plate, but I love my Creme Brulee with fresh berries. My friend had a really big piece of chocolate cake. The other friend had lemon sorbet. They stuffed it in a lemon shell, which was nice looking. \\n\\nI'm definitely going to go back for those scallops in Grand Marnier. I loved everything I had. Now I just need to try Nico's.

We did not try any of the beers during this visit. Our experience occurred during the early evening hours and the restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived. \\n\\nThe hostess sat our party of 3 adults in a booth that was adjacent to a booth with 6 young children seated in it with 6 or so adults at a table alongside the booth. The children were well behaved so that is not a complaint only that we could have been sat with one empty booth between us. This appeared to have been done for the consideration of the waiter rather than the comfort of the guests.\\n\\nAs for the food we ordered the Rueben Sandwich which was served with the bread completely drenched with the sauerkraut juice making it difficult to pick up. Overall this sandwich was mediocre at best and was served with french fries that were not hot but more like room temperature. We also had the BBQ Sandwich which was okay and also served with room temperature french fries. Lastly we had the Cuban Sandwich which again was okay but nothing spectacular. The Cuban was served with sweet potato fries that were served at about one third the portion of the regular french fries.\\n\\nOur waiter was friendly and on a scale of 1 to 10 was probably a 6.5. Overall the food items could have been better and the hostess should have sat us with at least one empty booth between us and the large group of adults and children.

A couple of friends and I decided to do a steak night armed with a $50 gift certificate in hand and it was a great meal.  We all did variations of the Classics set dinner which gets you an app, main with personal side and dessert for $40 or $50 if you opt for a regular-size filet mignon or ribeye.  \\n\\nI had the chilled gazpacho soup with crab meat, filet mignon done rare and strawberry shortcake with chocolate pecan truffles.  The soup was a fantastic summer dish with its cool and refreshing flavors.  The filet was grilled exactly to spec with a great sear and very cool, red center.  Although I loved the texture from the well-marbled beef, I actually would've preferred a hotter center.  Contrary to what some fellow Yelpers have noted, the 500 degree plate did surprisingly little in further cooking the steak...I suppose you need the copious amounts of sizzling butter to get that job done?  Amongst us, we had creamed spinach (delicious!), fingerling potatoes (loads of flavor) and mashed potatoes (fine, nothing special) for sides.  The shortcake at the end was pretty good and I really enjoyed the truffles.\\n\\nAs for the service and ambiance, both were exceptional - dimly lit, not too noisy.  Our waitress was well-spoken and amiable and she did a lovely job throughout the evening.\\n\\nThe steaks are well-worth the money and def go with the set dinners for added variety and the best value.  So far, I'd still have to give the nod to Grill 23 for the best steak I've had to date in Boston."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place to read a book, a magazine, do your homework or meet someone for a quick bite or coffee and desert.

It provided a new perspective on the classic Sunday meal, with innovative preparations that impressed far more on palate than on paper.\\n\\nMy friend and I opted for ringside seats, from which we had a complete view of the busy open kitchen.  I would definitely recommend this spot - the kitchen is exciting!  Our waiter was awesome and pointed out various interesting tidbits about the kitchen and the food both with and without prompting from our annoying inquisitive mouths.  He even brought us a sample of the house-made ketchup when we expressed our curiosity as to its dark orange color.  Both the ketchup and the service were fantastic. \\n\\nFor my meal, I went with the prix fixe, but it wasn't necessarily a bargain.  I think it came to a couple dollars' worth of savings, though I suppose it did include a pot of tea.  My friend went with two a la carte courses and we shared the prix fixe dessert (which, incidentally, was our choice, regardless of what it said on the menu).\\n\\nWe whet our tongues with alcohol.  I opted for a Bloody Mary and my friend went with a 1771.  My own was more my speed, a truly special preparation of the classic libation.  Craigie's version came with house-pickled onion, fresh horseradish, and a celery stalk infused in-house with agave and jalape√±o.  My, that celery was a treat.  The drink itself was excellent, with optimal thickness and swimming with spices.  \\n\\nFor our starters I ordered the coriander and cashew granola and my friend got the house-made doughnut with confiture du lait.  The granola was good but unmemorable - I prefer mine chewier.  The doughnut, on the other hand, was phenomenal.  It looked bewitchingly simple, just a small sugared doughnut in a small puddle of sauce.  It blew our minds - fresh, warm, perfectly textured, and with a mouth-filling doughnut and caramel flavor that managed to please without cloying.\\n\\nFor our mains I got corned beef hash and my friend got the shrimp and grits.  The hash was made with grass-fed and house-brined house-cured beef, and it came with a gorgeous slow-poached egg and crispy onion rings.  This dish was so delicious I nearly fell off my stool.  The textures, the seasoning, the consummate hashiness...I could eat this every day.  The shrimp and grits were more earthbound but excellent as well.  Composed of creamy Anson Mill organic white corn grits, bacon-braised greens, smoked rock shrimp, and sauce d'homard, it felt sophisticated but still plain tasty and comforting.\\n\\nFor dessert we opted for the sour milk panna cotta with blueberries and blueberry coulis.  The presentation was very simple and vaguely reminiscent of block tofu, an observation I offer without judgment.  The panna cotta tasted incredible - creamy and silky soft with modest sweetness and a hint of tang, it would've shone alone, though the fruit and sauce were lovely accompaniments.\\n\\nThis meal was so good that my friend made reservations to return for dinner that very evening, from which he texted me the contents of every glorious course.  I recommended Craigie to my parents on their trip to Boston and afterwards, my mother and I spent a decent amount of phone time discussing the virtues of the doughnut.  This is a brilliant restaurant with stellar service and unforgettable food - it is not to be missed."},{"name":"Strega Italiano - Seaport","address":"One Marina Park Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to Strega on Thanksgiving and I felt right as I walked in the door they rolled out the red carpet for me and my family.

That said, Giacomo's is great if you're the right sort of patron for their scene. The restaurant is definitely as much about the experience as it is about the food.\\n\\nThe line generally looks like it is going to take longer than it will. While that is good for you waiting outside, there is a fast-paced feel inside, which can upset those looking to kill 3 hours in a restaurant, mulling delicate flavors and swirling your wine about in a glass. You know, the American interpretation of European dining.\\n\\nSo, you stand outside for 20-45 minutes or so, longer on the weekend, and you're seated a little gruffly with instructions like \\"2? you're in the corner\\". Now you might think it's a little strange not to be instructed *which* corner they're talking about, but once inside you can basically survey the whole restaurant without needing to turn your head, locating this mysterious corner seat in only moments.\\n\\nThe menu is primarily on a large chalkboard, with a wine list on the table. I've always done well with the seafood dishes, as its a personal preference. I would consider the food to be more home and comfort than foodie, with giant portions and not too much flair coming out of the kitchen.\\n\\nService is *great*. In my visits I've always experienced an incredible efficiency topped off with a sense of humor that gives you a sense of being on the inside of some social circle. The fact that you're probably seated inches away from another table generally contributes to this, as you're almost certainly going to be interacting with the people around you, who I've always found to be in good spirits.\\n\\nAlso, I've always paid cash anyway, but last night I noticed the table next to me paying with VISA. I'd always thought it was cash only, but perhaps they've updated the policy.\\n\\nIn summary, if you don't mind bumping elbows with strangers and laughing about it, want huge portions and don't mind eating relatively quickly, you really can't go wrong with Giacomo's."},{"name":"Reuben's Deli","address":"57 Broad St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I have been coming to this place since I was a student at Georgia State...I am now a working adult (BOOOOO!!) and my job just happens to be in the same area as Reuben's.

We were a party of three that sat at the bar (we walked in without a reservation on a Sat at 5:30).  The ambiance was great. The service was stellar. My cocktail was one of the best cocktails I've had in a while. I got the Mellow Yellow..it was very well-executed. The bartender was working the bar very well.  For food we got the octopus appetizer, the burger, and the pig's head (for two).  My favorite was the octopus appetizer. The burger was very good but I'm not sure if I'd say it was the best burger I've ever had.  The pig's head was rather fatty...not as meaty as others that I had.  For a $72 half's a pig's head..I ate everything...fat and all...and it was a lot of fat.  I regret doing that just a bit.  The main gripe though with the hoisin served with it....texture was off..it was rather grainy in texture...you can taste the flour or corn starch or something in it.  And they did not give us enough of the bean sprouts and pumpkin sambal.  Still..given all of that...Craigie deserves 5 stars.

Kanom krok - scallop with coconut cream with galangal- again small bit big flavor.

When you first walk in the bar it seems like your run of the mill craft taproom. The taps only serve beers they brew in house, windows behind the bar let you see all the excitement going on in the brewery itself, and of course board / card games are available if you want that whiff of nostalgia. The layout of the bar area itself is pretty good. There is a big area with tables scattered about with an area off to the side with couches and a coffee table. We showed up with a big group of friends and moved some tables around to accommodate (basically making a giant circle). The bar tender was cool about it and we made sure to move everything back after we left. I believe the building was likely an old auto repair shop as the main entry was an open garage door. The outside had a few benches in a fenced off area for those who love them some fresh air. Considering what this area of town used to be like, this is a huge improvement.\\n\\nOne of the odd things about this taproom / brewery is that it is actually two breweries. Two separate companies, Broken Strings and Black Cauldron, share the brewery and taproom. I didnt realize this until I looked (and ultimately stared) at the sign outside and was confused by first listing the name and logo for Broken Cauldron, followed by the names and logos of each brewery. I know this sounds really weird, because it kinda is, but I tried beers by both and they were each quality products. Either way, we had a great time and ended up coming back after the show.

I'm not a sardine person but this was my first fresh sardine and now I'm converted. Came in for drinks and stayed for a full meal. I recommend ordering the grilled plantains (see bottom of menu) and croquetts de Poison together as they went perfectly into one bite together. The Teranga Caipirinha and the Passion d'amore drinks were amazing. The bartender took the time to explain some Senegalese traditions and culture which made it feel especially welcoming.

A Must at Downtown Disney\\n\\nWe had a wonderful time at Raglan Road, good food and great entertainment. \\n\\nWe had reservations for 7:15pm and were seated promptly. We got a great feeling from the energy of the staff and crowd that this would be a fun evening. The meal was very good and the entertainment outstanding. An acoustic group called \\"Elan\\" played wonderful Irish/Celtic music, some high octane jigs and reels that had everyone clapping and tapping along, and some softer melodies with their female vocalist. Between sets, there was Irish dancing on stage and on a small elevated platform in the center of the restaurant. They also had children from the audience come up to learn some of the dancing. This all made for a great experience, the funnest night at Disney this year.\\n\\nThe food:\\nI started with a pint of Granny Mary's Irish Red Ale, an Irish craft beer suggested by our server. Great flavor; dark caramel with a slightly sweet and malty aroma. Wish I could get it nearby. My wife had a Margarita (Pepe Lopez) and daughter had lemonade. \\n\\nThey bring a Guinness brown soda bread to each table, served with a Guinness reduction dipping sauce. I was surprised at the sweetness of the sauce made from Guinness, and it was delicious, complemented the bread well.\\n\\nThere were so many great sounding dishes on the menu, so while my wife had a hankering for Fish and Chips, and daughter Mac and Cheese (duh), I asked our waiter for suggestions. After so much walking that day, I was plenty hungry and he suggested their signature Kevin's Heavenly Ham. It was a very large portion. The ham was basically three very large and thick slices of smoked and salted ham, like you might expect in the US for a holiday dinner. It was served on top of \\"Colcannon Potatoes\\" (mashed potatoes with pepper, cream, scallions, chives, cabbage, bacon). The potatoes were complemented by cooked cabbage and a Parsley Cream Sauce, and for the ham a Raisin Cider Jus - fruity, sweet and rich, perfect with the ham. I thought my entree was very, very good. My wife thought her fish and chips were very good and well prepared, just not uniquely flavored. Lastly, Mac and Cheese for kids, well, always a winner. \\n\\nFor dessert, I had the Strawberry Apple Crumble. It came in a mason jar with a mini pitcher of cream to pour on, but that jar made it a little hard to eat in my opinion. It looked nice, but was hard to get the crumbly topping, ice cream, and fruit mixed well for each bite. Still, pretty good. My wife's Dundon's Delight was very good; cold, creamy with raspberry sauce. Our daughter had the Strawberry Delight from the kids menu; ice cream with pavlova and strawberry sauce. She loved it, but it was humongous... so I got some too.\\n\\nThe only miss this night was the service speed. Not sure why, but our meal took a very long time to come after we got our drinks, and then our dessert took a long time after that, and then the check took a while. The table seated next to us and after us received service more steadily. But it did allow us more time to enjoy the music so it was definitely okay. \\n\\nIf you are at Disney or in the Orlando area, I highly suggest an evening at Raglan Road. Wonderful evening."},{"name":"Super Burrito Express","address":"10506 SE 42nd Ave","city":"Milwaukie","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food. yummy burritos, great tortas.\\n\\nIf you get the super burrito ask them to remove the chili, its not that good.

The crust wasn't mushy or over cooked and provided a great foundation for the sauce and toppings.  The sauce was applied generously, but didn't weigh down the pizza at all.  I liked the smooth flavor of the sauce - no lingering after taste and no mushy tomatoes.  They certainly did not skimp on the toppings, either.  My slices were piled with pepperoni & sausage, both of which were quite good & not overly greasy.  And it was even good re-heated once I needed a snack later ;)\\n\\nThey have a 2 large pizza for $22 special, which was perfect for our small crowd of hungry folks.  After tax & delivery fee, our total came out to about $27 and, once we tossed in a few bucks for tip, we paid just over $30.

Yelpers i encourage you to look this up!\\n\\nI can't definitely be certain of whether or not Totto used any forms of MSG, but what i can say is that i did get really thirsty after my meal even though i only had a few spoonfuls of their broth- implying the use of different forms of \\"MSG\\" or it could be that my body just couldn't handle the amount of salt that was in that bowl. \\n\\nBut come on, let's be real.......almost every single restaurant out there uses MSG in some shape or form and theres really no way that you can avoid that- MSG can further accentuate the natural flavoring in food. As a foodie, the use of MSG doesn't hinder me from enjoying my foods- it ultimately comes down to the execution of it, and the final product. \\n\\nDid i just write an entire yelp review on MSG? lol......"},{"name":"River Maiden","address":"5301 E Mill Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"The coffee is good.

I meant to say possibly the best fries in the entire Orlando area. Skin on, fried in peanut oil, delicious.\\n\\nThe dogs were expertly dressed and visually very appealing. The taste of the Chicago Dog was just right. Everything in balance. No single element overpowering the others. (One minor glitch: They came without the sport peppers.

Within seconds of returning to my table, Jeremy, one of the owners, came by and apologized as well, and made us feel valued customers. Good guy!)  \\n\\nTo sum it up: Good Vienna dogs, fresh poppyseed buns, fresh condiments. GREAT FRIES!  My dinner companions were stuffed, as was I, at the end of our meal.

One of these woman (one without the accent with hair pulled back and glasses) particularly has gone out of her way to be just mean to my me and my son and she now considers it sport at this point and seems to relish the opportunity.   Sounds silly and it really doesn't matter to me now because I go to Caf√© Medici and love it the folks there are so pleasant and are grateful for your business.

So, we were pleasantly surprised when we \\"discovered\\" that one of our favorite vegetarian spots serves brunches on the weekends! First, the most important part of a restaurant review: the food is goooood! If you're looking for a sweet breakfast, definitely try their vegan pancakes (made w/ sweet potatoes and dates... Mmm!) and vegan French toast, both of which are great with coffee. (Un)fortunately, my wife and I have both locked on to our favorites, and we seem to always get the same selections whenever we go there. My hands-down favorite is the Omelet Du Chevre, which is filled with goat cheese, sweet potato, caramelized onion and arugula (a terrific combination of savory with a hint of sweet), served with home fries and toast. My wife's fav is the Breakfast Bandito, a wheat tortilla filled with egg, soy sausage, refried beans, cheese, and salsa, then topped with a bit of creamy poblano sauce and greens.\\n\\nGreat food aside, the place also has a great feel to it. They recently (few months ago?) redesigned their interior, and the place has a natural bamboo-y theme going on. The place is pleasantly bright (as I recall, the old decor was a bit drab), and the layout feels more open than before. Overall, a very comfortable place to dine.

I will never know the difference!\\n\\nWe were craving Cajun food today but didn't feel like going to Evangeline's Cafe, our regular destination of choice for Cajun eats.   We have been meaning to go to Nubian Queen Lola's restaurant for a while now and today presented a perfect excuse to finally visit the highest-rated restaurant in the East Side according to the Fearless Critic commentary.\\n\\nThe colorful atmosphere makes up for the small dining room.  Seating is limited and there isn't too much room to wiggle.  It took a while to get our order in place as the waitress kept mingling with the few patrons that were there.  As soon as the waitress took our order, she headed to the kitchen and disappeared for a while.  I soon realized this place was a one-person show, our waitress was the cook and the cashier as well.  Although the chicken and sausage gumbo was served immediately after we placed our order, it took another 25 minutes to get our po'boys.  My co-worker liked the gumbo a lot.  I was not convinced it was real gumbo at all.  The gumbo lacked a caramel-colored roux although the dish was tasty.  Wasn't too sure what was missing to categorize this chicken/sausage soup as gumbo but it was good.  My co-worker ordered the pork chop po'boy and I got the fried shrimp po'boy.  The po'boy was huge!  This was the most manliest sandwich I have ever consumed.  Sure, I can easily chow down on a 12 inch sandwich at Subway or Quiznos but I kid you not, I only managed to eat a little over half of the sandwich.  My co-worker only ate half of it as well.  The shrimp was breaded with a light batter of sorts.  The shrimped was topped with lightly battered onion rings as well.  The french bread was so good!  I had a hard time stuffing my mouth with the sandwich and after a few big bites, my stomach didn't have the strength to go on.  I kept nibbling at the bread and my body finally shut down.  Did I say the sandwich was a monster!  It was huge, tasty, with the typical tomato, lettuce, and over sized pickle making a cameo appearance.  Not the best po'boy I have eaten but surely one of the most filling. \\n\\nApparently, Lola, the waitress, cook, cashier and owner was homeless at some point in her life and now she is a huge homeless advocate in Austin.  As we left, a man down on his luck walked in.  He told her he found a job and thanked her for helping him out.

I ordered the sea bass special and my husband and our guest had the lamb chops special.  Both dishes were exceedingly greasy.  Hard to imagine greasy fish (this was not fried), but it was really inedible.  The only thing good about the sea bass dish were the cherry tomatoes it was served with.  Even the 2 asparagus on top of the fish were not very good. My husband was equally disappointed in the lamb chops.

They had a 3-course offering for $33-appetizer, main course, dessert-however, in my mind it's a better representation of a restaurant's prowess if you go with items not typically offered as a special. I began with the French onion soup; the \\"cave aged' Gruyere had me curious. After all, Gruyere is a  top favorite cheese & one I use regularly in my Gratin Dauphinoise. I hoped the cave aging might somehow present a different flavor profile for the soup. Alas, while I was hoping for a deeper, sharper flavor that didn't convey; the cheese tastes as does a typical non cave aged Gruyere.The broth, while tasty, wasn't as rich as I've tasted in other places. I presumed since the dish mentioned short ribs, it would have a richer flavor, yet it wasn't as expected. The soup isn't simply about the broth & cheese; it should carry through the caramelized flavor of the onion. The broth, bits of meat, caramelized onions, bread & cheese altogether should produce a delicious & luxurious mouthfeel. This soup overall, while good, wasn't as favorable as expected from a restaurant that claims it's a French bistro. Perhaps a different bone type  for the broth, a different & more caramelized onion...ah well--give it a try; it isn't bad by any means; just not up to expectation. I moved to the Steak au Poivre-even though it was done with a filet. To be fair, the French prefer a thickly cut & lovely marbled cut...a filet may be think, yet marveled it is rarely to not. Regardless, I gave it a try. The chef prepared the beef perfectly to order, the peppercorns were noticeable & not too overly pounded out so the hint of pepper played through the flavor nicely, not overpowering the beef or sauce. The sauce was good, yet I suspect they may use the same stock as in the soup so it lacked the richness & depth I desired. I finished with the Apple Tarte Tatin--it was alright; I ordered it without the ice cream & only the caramel sauce, with an extra side of caramel. How disappointing that the extra was delivered cold, not warmed--which leads me to believe it was added to the dish & heated afterwards. The caramel was most likely house-made but truly was tasteless & instead of a caramel texture & flavor tested more whipped-like. My server, Megan, was great & she treated me well. I'd not rule out Aquataine, however, I wouldn't say it's an absolute go to. I'll try a few other places while here & upon my return give them another try."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"When I go to Trident, it is often for brunch or to kill time looking at books - and it is great for both!This week I went to meet friends for lunch and get some work done.

You have to be honest, without being rude. So, that's exactly what my goal is when writing this review of the Salt Lick. It almost pains me to give a place such a low rating when the place is \\"notorious\\" for \\"amazing bbq\\". I'm a bbq girl all the way, but I like TEXAS bbq and honestly, this just didn't stack up against other places I've had que. \\n\\nIt was a bright Saturday afternoon and we had no real plans for the day so I said \\"ooooh let's go to The Salt Lick!\\" We did exactly that. The best boyfriend in the world made that hour drive up to Driftwood for what we had dreamed about and drooled over when we continuously saw people like Bobby Flay, Guy Fieri & Adam from Man vs. Food speak of as the most amazing bbq you'll ever have in Texas. \\n\\nWe got there and discovered it was cash only, which was a bit disappointing because honestly, who always just carries cash now days? It wasn't a HUGE deal, but we did have to make an 8 mile drive back into town, which wasn't a total loss because we picked up a six pack, being that it's BYOB at Salt Lick's establishment. I think one thing that kind of took away for me in the fact that they've taken that feeling on a Texas bbq joint away by not just letting you go sit, order your food etc. They give you a \\"vibrating thingamajig\\" and tell you have a seat. The guy we initially gave our name to was completely rude and annoyed at the fact that he had to write our names down. \\n\\nWe sat and waited for about 15 minutes and decided let's just get the food to go, it's packed and hot and we'll just go have a picnic under a tree somewhere (with our beer). We ordered the plate with a pork rib, sausage and brisket. The service at the to-go area was prompt, but we were a bit in sticker shock when he told us the total for two plates, 30 bucks. For me, that's a bit high for bbq, even higher when you consider the portions we were given. They also don't offer sweet tea. My other half and I both looked at each other in sheer horror! No sweet tea at a bbq place in Texas?! Whaaaaaaat??! \\n\\nWe found our spot and opened up a cold one in anticipation for the bbq that we were about to partake in...and then we each took our first bite and I could tell that he could tell that neither of us wanted to comment just yet. I gave everything a try in small bites before I judged. I can honestly say the meat was perfectly cooked, brisket had the signature smoke ring and the sausage was great texture and great flavor. I took a bit of the rib and wasn't so impressed with it, as it was slightly dry and a bite tougher than I have imagined their pork ribs to be. I gave my rib to my boyfriend. \\n\\nThe coleslaw was awful. Capitol AWFUL. It was a dry coleslaw, as well as a dry potato salad. It was seasoned with only a bit of pickling spice and I'm just really not okay with dry, flavorless coleslaw and the same goes for the potato salad that was basically just stacked on top of the slaw. The beans were severely lacking in flavor. Here's the kicker....they slathered the meat in the sauce and THAT'S where this meat that should have been a 4, was taken down to a 2. The sauce was not our cup of tea. It's a mustard based Carolina style sauce and it just didn't do it for either of us to say the least. I found myself trying to go for the meat that didn't have that sauce on it. \\n\\nFor me, I'm a ketchup/vinegar/pepper base sauce girl, straight up Texas style bbq sauce and this was just in no way shape or form close to it. I'm always up for stepping out of my comfort zone with foods and flavors, but this just wasn't appetizing sauce. \\n\\nWe both said we wished we wouldn't have wasted the money on this meal. It was nothing short of disappointing, after hearing such great things, even more so a disappointing experience. The best of the sides were the beans, which needed something. not sure what, but something. I really feel like maybe since becoming a bit more famous, something has happened her and that feeling of a Texas BBQ joint just isn't there anymore and that's one thing we were looking forward to. We won't be going again. This places smells amazing when you drive up & I thought I would be thrilled, but I just wasn't. \\n\\nIf you like the flavor and consistency of a South Carolina sauce, you'll probably really enjoy this place. I didn't taste anything other than mustard & some peppers in this sauce. No beer, no depth of flavor etc. It was just really lacking. I think if I was going back, which I won't be unless someone is paying other than myself, I'd say no sauce. I'd also like to see them get some sort of dressing to go with the coleslaw. German potato salad isn't my cup of tea and this was more like a German style salad rather than your southern potato salad recipe. We'll continue our quest for the best bbq in Texas, but so far, Salt Like, you're just not it."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I just picked up a San Gennaro pizza to go.

Cafeteria style means there is no tipping necessary and $6.50 total price includes tax. The only place anywhere cheaper than potluck cafe is ding ho (nearby in Chinatown, kneeland st) but ding ho closes earlier, is take-out only and has only 2 or 3 dishes from which to choose.

They close for lunch at 2:30, but the place was still bustlin! And it was mostly Asians which I consider a good sign of good authentic food. I really wanted some pan fried buns but they were out, so got the scallion pancake, Taiwanese lao mian, the chitlins noodle soup, fried white turnip cake, and soy bean milk with youtiao. The youtiao and scallion pancake were a bit oily but still good. I have to admit I didn't try the chitlins noodle soup cause I don't like intestines, but from what I hear it was good. The lao mian was my fave though, nice flavor throughout, nice texture to the noodles, and nice fried onion crunch going on. The soy bean milk came out piping hot which I appreciate and tasted nutritious and freshly made.

This was one of my two most favorite part of the weekend Boston trip. I indulged in this 10-course Chef Tasting experience. Though it was $115 per person, the portion was very generous well worth every cent compared to a lot overrated places in DC. I was also offered the chef's kitchen table where the entire food preparation took place in front of our eyes. I was very impressed by all the chefs, diligently working away in the most organized fashion - I think this is also why Craigie is successful. The kichen was immaculate and the chefs all had their station prepared and kept clean at all times. From kitchen to floor - all the staffs' attention was on serving the food hot!  Head chef Tony Maws even chased after waiters when they were not ready when the food was ready. Now that's something to note for!\\n\\nOur waiter -  he was very enthusiastic about recommending wine and all kinds of stuff to us. He was also very nice about letting us substitute any a-la-carte items if we wanted to try them. He also printed us two copies of the 10-course menu - now that's great service! We didn't need to ask for too much - it's a wonderful restaurant with a 'giving' attitude. The wine list was mostly french and I was just in heaven with it but my friend wasn't so sure. We were a bit apprehensive about the choice of wine but I ended up picking the 1999 Bandol Domaine du Gros Nor√©  which the waiter recommended over and over. It's Mourv√®dre, Syrah, Cinsault, Grenache - you can't go wrong with that! It had to open up hence it needed decanting - it was a very fine wine with a nice tannin yet balanced. I liked it alot.\\n\\nSeafood trio of fish liver, squid noodles w/ nuoc cham and fried shrimp. I read that the nuoc cham is made in-house, together with the squid, it was very complex yet delicious dish. That was my fav of the trio. \\n\\nSalad of hiramasa sashimi w/ red onion-shiso salsa, avocado, & harissa-rose vinaigrette: The sashimi was great but I thought the cumin in the harissa was slightly overpowering even though it tasted fresh toasted. Slightly less cumin would be better. My friend made a comment to the waiter and the chefs probably heard it but I hope they took it constructively.\\n\\nWaloo with Yuzu - The fish was so fresh yet sweet and fatty resulting in this creamy taste with the yuzu sauce which was incredible. We both nodded our heads for this one.\\n\\nRed chile & sesame marinated Faroe Island Sea Trout Kama (the collar, Maws calls it shoulder) - with higher gelatin level near the cartilage, it's like Chef Maws understands why the asians love fish that are not detached from the cartilage, it's priced for the gelatinous layer that provided the fish flavor and tenderness. It's smooth and melts in your mouth. The fish swam in a red sauce made from red chile and sesame. I hope I am wrong on this but the sauce if mixed with something from ready made from a jar which gave it the extra saltiness. The sauce was velvety and aromatic but just a tad too salty for me hence it's off balance. The fish however was cooked to perfection. I still give this dish a 5 star for the chef Maws' adventure with experimenting with something most chain-restaurants-overcooked-flavorless-fish-fillet type fans would freak out about.\\n\\nPork heart sausage ragu, uni and fresh pasta - I know I like the dish below but this is my favorite dish of the night - Hands down. I gasped for a second when they told me what was served the sound of pork heart didnt resonate well for me because I am not a big fan of organ meat. Untill recently I started loving foie gras and sweetbread but pork heart!! I didnt let my fear get the best of me so I just sank my fork into this amazing ragu. The pork heart sausage was well spiced and cooked till very tender in the sauce. Then I combined it with the uni. The flavor of this dish worked wonderfully, more than I expected. I think Chef Maws is a genius at this point. It was simply an amazing dish. I wonder if my palate has matured or it's just simply organ meat made simpler\\n\\nVeal Sweetbread, blood sausage, egg, farro - absolutely amazing bursting with such complex flavors. This dish had me going on a tasting galore I was speechless - First three gave it such a complex flavor and I absolutely love the farro absorbing all the flavors. Loved it!\\n\\nLamb trio - lamb tenderloin, lamb sausage and lamb belly - I heart the lamb belly in this dish, belly is becoming a popular part but the lamb belly was a nice touch.\\n\\nWe also ordered the bone marrow which seemed like the hot ticket item, the prep chef who toasted fresh bread that accompanied the marrow had the alarm clock going off practically the entire night.\\n\\nJasmine tea infused panna cotta w/ candied citrus zest\\n\\nPeanut Butter Ice Cream,  Banana mousse\\n\\nAncho chile & cardamom spiced Valrhona hot chocolate\\n\\n3 Desserts were great but too much food at the en"},{"name":"Wienerschnitzel","address":"2512 W Braker Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Oh jeez.

It's located down Kingsway just past Royal Oak - not really near any of the other big Asian hotspots, unlike the area just directly around Metrotown. The interior is a bit older and looks a bit shabby but a few friends and I were craving wonton in the area and thought we would check it out anyways.\\n\\nThe restaurant is interesting because it seems to cater to a more Chinese-Canadian western friendly audience in some ways, which usually signals to me questions of whether or not the food will be authentic. Surprisingly, I was not disappointed. Service was quick since the restaurant was not too full, and our two orders, a wonton noodle and soup along with some BBQ pork came out of the kitchen. The wontons were actually pretty good and the BBQ pork was nice and not too tough as well. The meal wasn't even that expensive either which was a nice as well, and kept the dinner budget well under $15 bucks (the BBQ was split with my friend).\\n\\nOverall, 3.5 stars. I wouldn't say that I would go out of my way to travel here, but if you happen to be at this part of Kingsway and want some Chinese food, then this isn't too bad of a place.

My friend got the Coquelet Braise, a cornish hen with a citrus marinade and with vermicelli that looked and tasted very wonderfully, although the hen was a bit tough (even though it smelled deliciously).

The food is inconsistent and ranges from sub-par to barely adequate, and friends who are less picky than I have vowed never to return. I only eat at Broadway Station Sushi because I work nearby, and the occasional sushi craving sends me grudgingly there. Though the portion sizes are reasonable and the prices fair enough, the fish rarely seems fresh, and the rolls sometimes look like they were assembled during an earthquake.\\n\\nOn the other hand the service is consistent: it is unfailingly terrible. Servers take orders without making eye contact, and you can forget about quality checks once your food arrives. Even something simple like a water refill is almost impossible to get. When it's busy the servers seem unable to cope, and when it's slow they are more interested in chatting with the kitchen staff than clearing tables or greeting guests.\\n\\nMy most recent visit may be my last. Upon my arrival just at the start of the dinner rush, a server halfway across the restaurant gestured to a large table by the door while in the middle of taking another guest's order. Because several others had arrived at the same time as me, I made it clear to her that I was alone and didn't require such a large table. She was disinterested, and although she heard me she didn't offer me another spot, so I sat down. After I had gotten settled with my tea and water, my server returned and brusquely informed me that I would have to move to a smaller table across the restaurant to make room for a larger party that had just arrived. She began to walk away before I even replied, but my silence was apparently enough of a clue even for her to understand. She then asked if I minded, to which I replied \\"yes\\", as I had already offered to take a smaller table. She gave me a dirty look and wordlessly removed the extra settings from my table. That was almost enough to prompt me to walk out, but I was feeling so spiteful that I didn't want to surrender my table. The rest of my meal was very uncomfortable, and I left without tipping for one of the few times in my life.\\n\\nOverall, if you are looking to try a new sushi place, your should leave this one off your list; we are fortunate in Vancouver to have many other better restaurants. But if you're in the neighborhood and you absolutely must have sushi, then Broadway Station Sushi will get the job done.

Perfect combination of spices and seasonings, cooked to perfection with a little smokiness, not too dry not too undercooked, nice snappy skin.   It was A-1 top of the charts.  Pulled pork and brisket were about average, pretty good but not sure I'd drive way back out to Driftwood again for it.  PP was maybe a little dry and needed some sauce, brisket was just not that flavorful.  Again not bad, just average.\\n\\nService was exceptional, they will treat you right, great place and great people.

I thought the rice balls with the pork was better than the ramen. \\n\\nJust went a few days ago and got the rice balls with the pulled pork. Still delicious, but it's way too much rice. Rice to pork ratio is bad. But the bites of rice and pork together are so good! \\n\\nNow to the ramen. First time I went, I got the spicy ramen. This time I got the miso ramen. So tasty! The broth is super thick-- thicker than any other ramen place I've had. I for sure could not finish all the broth. The pork is good and the egg was perfectly cooked! My boyfriend got the mega ramen - the broth wasn't as thick as the miso ramen. But if you are looking for a lot of meat, this is the way to good! And probably great for the price ($15). The miso ramen is $12, but smaller than the mega ramen. \\n\\nOverall, pretty good. I would come back again when I want a hearty thick ramen. Cash only.

I am completely dumbfounded at the popularity of this out in the middle of nowhere BBQ joint given its unquestionably mediocre food.  Now that my high expectations have been thoroughly grounded in reality I realize that Salt Lick is more of a tourist attraction than an oasis of free flowing Texas BBQ bliss.  \\n\\nSince you'll spend more time waiting in line than you will actually eating your food, I think a paragraph about the inevitable minimum hour wait is warranted.  First, you're routed through a dirt parking lot only to park about 10 minutes away from your destination.  Then you're corralled into a waiting area (still outside) where you're forced to endure live country music covers while trying to avoid 100s of mosquito bites until your name is called.  Not my bag, baby.  Finally, you're led by a waitress you will never see again because this place is so crowded down a long hallway to sit on an uncomfortable picnic table.  All of this would be willingly endured if the food was top notch, but that just wasn't the case.\\n\\nNow I know what you're thinking - This sounds like a two star review if I ever heard one, right?  So to set the record straight, the sausage and ribs were worth mentioning, good enough to save Salt Lick from wallowing in 2 star misery.  But the brisket was dry and the sides were just pitiful.  The sauce was atypical to say the least, more closely resembling honey mustard than your traditional tomato based Texas BBQ sauce.  I can see how you might like it just because it's so different, but I was not a big fan.  \\n\\nMy experience at Salt Lick was much like my experience at a State Fair.  I bought into the hype, I paid a lot (in terms of drive time and other BBQ joints I could have eaten at), I waited in line forever, and when I finally got my turn to ride the ferris wheel it was real, it was fun, but it wasn't real fun.

Enjoyed my Sam Adams while I waited for my dad.\\n\\nThe bread they give you it large, I hate those tiny pieces of bread some places serve. We ordered the INVOLTINI DI MELANZANE, rolled eggplant with ricotta. Hard to make that not taste good, but the eggplant was especially well prepared. There was a ton of extra sauce which was perfect for dipping with the large bread. My husband and I shared the AMALFITANA pizza with smoked mozzarella, tomatoes and arugula and the baked fusilli with veggies and goat cheese. We liked both of them. The smoked mozzarella was a nice change from the norm, and tasted even better for lunch the next day."},{"name":"Antico Forno","address":"93 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We were visiting family in Boston, they had never been there and we were looking for family friendly place to eat in the North End.

The bar is in the heart of little five points and surrounded by the eclectic-ness that comes with it. The bar is part of a generation ago where beer was less industrial and gentrified. Here their strength is in the number of selections with the bottle menu consisting of a literal book. It would be hard pressed to not find something you can enjoy. Sometimes with massive quantities comes a lack of quality but not at the Porter Beer Bar as many options are rare and very sought after. The space is long and narrow with booth seating in the back behind the bar. A kitchen puts out some serious eats and gained my respect as the first beer joint to have foie gras on the menu. In its definite dive-y style the atmosphere is nearly approaching dilapidated. In a surrounding area that does not need any help being any less refined and its rough around the corners seems almost overdone these days although but perfectly comfortable if that's what you're looking for. I never actually feared for my safety when walking in but not a place I would want to bring my grandmother either.

It was with great expectation we finally made this much touted pilgrimage to this fire pit mecca of smoked meat and tangy sauce.  \\n\\nFirst, we did NOT go on the weekend, but on Monday for lunch.  When you see the empty line que, think Disney Land before opening, you understand the numbers of people they serve on the weekend. The parking lot is HUGE for a reason.  The entire place is HUGE.  I loved the rustic decor, and sunny indoor dining room with large windows.  There are also large covered outdoor areas with big fans to handle the busier times. But as with all BBQ, it is the smoky smell that entices you in and holds you there in salivating expectation. The firepit full of smoking meats at the entrance is an alter worthy of worship for all us pilgrims.  A true feast for the senses.\\n\\nThe staff was attentive and friendly, and we quickly ordered sliced brisket sandwiches, pork ribs (the waitress said they were the most tender), and sausage.  It all arrived fast.  Hubby's sandwich of sliced loose cut brisket was declared one of the best ever.  When my son's and mine were rather spongy and chewy, the waitress quickly brought us a new plate of meat that was to die for! I ate mine on their sliced bread that was that wonderful white gummy delicious that sops up their homemade sauce.  The meat was spiced and smoked just right.\\n\\nTheir sausage is very finely ground and some of the best I've ever had.  The pork rib was good, not great.  A bit too chewy and lacked meat.  Finally, we ordered the pecan pie, which was the first outright miss for me.  While the pecans on top were nicely toasted, the filling was too mousey/cakey for me.  I really like more goo in my pecan pie!  Opinions about pecan pie vary as much as ice cream flavors, so I imagine there are others who feel just the opposite about it.\\n\\nWe left grateful to have experienced this Texas institution, and looking forward to coming back soon!

When we arrived, they told us it would be a half an hour until we sat unless we went to the bar... so we went to the bar. After sitting at the bar for 5 minutes or so, we were told you must be 21 and older, which was not previously mentioned, so we turned back around and proceeded to sit in the lobby for about 20 minutes. An honest mistake on the host's part. After we sat down, feeling parched, I took a drink of water and was unpleasantly surprised. By reading a couple reviews I found out something is soaked in the water to give it a somewhat coconut-y taste. I began to like it, but being thirsty and the water being barely chilled with a bizarre aftertaste... no thank you. In short: The people who don't like it are valid. The people who love it are also valid. THE WINGS ARE NASTY! Just kidding. The wings really are good, especially with the vegetables it came with. The Khao Soi Neua (pardon a misspelling, there probably is one) was just alright. It was flavorful and creamy, but just not for me. I'd just order 17 plates of wings and call it a night.

The decor matches the season (Since it's Halloween right now, it is more likely than not that a fake spider will be crawling across your table)\\n9.

I sometimes eat here alone, and am never bothered by creeps, unless they're my friends who are sitting at the bar while I try to sneak into the back. \\nSometimes it is really smoky, but not during the day. \\nThe beer list here rivals the brickstore, and the staff is really knowledgeable. I don't usually come here to drink -- I come here for the food. The food is GOOD. Especially the specials. I've never been dissatisfied with a special, and the only time I was not completely excited and enthusiastic was the beef stroganoff, but maybe i just wasn't in the mood for it. That said, the house-made noodles were the most perfectly textured noodles I've ever tasted, and very fresh. The stand-by here for me is the Shrimp BLT, it's satisfying but still cool and refreshing -- the jicama is the best part. I usually have the arugula salad on the side, it is so perfect (occasionally overdressed but not smothered fortunately) . The banana split is pretty crave-able as well as the apple beignets (\\"There's no shame in two desserts,\\" said the server). Last night I had a soup that blew my mind. Once again, another enticing special: I wanted something comforting and mild, not too filling, so I went for the cauliflower soup. \\"Shaved Almonds with Beer Marshmallow,\\" said the heading. BEER MARSHMALLOW?!? What's a beer marshmallow? The server explained to me that it was a house-made whipped marshmallow flavored with beer. I ordered it, and immediately the fear was mounting. I questioned my choice -- was I out of my mind? \\nMy palms became sweaty as one of the kitchen staff brought a platter to me with a bowl and what looked like a Belgian beer glass full of milk. \\nHe whispered with the anticipation of a child awaiting a report card, \\"cauliflower soup?\\" \\n\\"Oh, yeah,\\" I somehow choked out. \\nHe set the bowl down. Its bottom was covered by shaved almonds. Atop them was a fluffy, slimy, white blob. He poured the contents of the beer glass over it and instructed that I enjoy. I scooped out a heaping spoonful of the frothy slime and slurped. It was cool, sweet, mild, pleasant, heavenly. La Chouffe! In Marshmallow form! The soup was delicate, satisfying, and perky with fresh parsley leaves. i savored the last little floating frothy lump with a scoop of the almonds from the bottom -- rich creamy goodness. \\nI am amazed that such a place exists in L5P.

I like how the restaurant is towards the end of the Ave, so it's less crowded but still busy enough to do some fun people watching.  I had tomato soup & a salad that had grapes, walnuts, apples, & was finished off with a light vinaigrette.  Everything was great tasting and filling, but not heavy, which was perfect for me!  My friend had the burger with the sweet potato fries which I tasted & was incredible.  The rumor around town is that SPICE happens to have the best burger.  It's not a rumor- it's true!  \\nPrice wise, it was extremely reasonable.  Both the salad & burger was $9 and the soup was $6.  I'll definitely be back.

I'm not talking about the type of meditation where the room is meant to be silent so that your breathing is the only sound you experience; I'm talking about the type that throws you into a sense of awareness of every sight, smell, sound and feeling...true mindfulness.  I've had this experience twice at Revelry.  You walk in to a room reminiscent of an old converted workshop; wood floors, wood paneled walls, high ceilings and metal fixtures; an old-soul room come to new life with paintings of cassette tapes, hung boom boxes and dizzying geometrics that force your eye to scan the entire place.  It shouldn't be a surprise at this point when I tell you the food caused an awakening in me - an emotional experience to say the least.  I found that three dishes reversed feelings of stress and uncertainty into euphoria.  The flavors were daring; almost taunting you with some secret you're about ready to be in on.  Even though you may not be the first to experience these flavors, the craft makes you feel otherwise, almost like the entire building, staff and menu was created just for you.  The sensation is and will only be available to you if you allow yourself to get lost in the surroundings: the heavy bass from soulful hip hop, the energy, the aesthetic...all meant to awaken your sense of being alive.  I don't  want to go into descriptive detail about the food because you should go to Revelry with an open-minded sense of exploration...zero preconceptions.  Too many times we read reviews about some other person's good or bad experience leaving us expecting some sort of parallel that can truly distort true objectivity.

Awhile back, I checked Nakato's website, and the prices were definitely higher than what we were looking to pay. But, recently, I picked up a brochure and found them to be much more do-able. ($18-25 range for the hibachi dinners)\\n\\nWe made reservations for a Friday night; although, when we got there, it seemed pretty obvious that they weren't necessary for that particular night. There were plenty of hibachi seats open, the bar area was nearly empty, and the smaller rooms were only sparsely populated. It was getting more crowded by the time we left, though.\\n\\n3 stars for good, fresh-tasting hibachi fare...if more run-of-the-mill than standout. (Then again, run-of-the-mill was really all we were looking for.) The noodles are a little different touch than most other places--very thin with a sesame/soy sauce. Pretty tasty for an add-on. The soup was not the best I've had, but the ginger dressing on the salad WAS some of the best I've had. Our shrimp appetizer came towards the end of the meal prep process for some reason, but the shrimp were really big and very tasty.\\n\\nI had steak and chicken--steak was really tender and chicken was nicely cooked, although I thought the portions were a little small. Same goes for the serving of veggies--nice with the addition of broccoli and mushrooms, but there just weren't a lot of them. The $2+ upcharge for fried rice is silly. It was a hefty portion (comprising about 80% of my leftovers), but I think it should be standard with a steamed option....not the other way around. \\n\\nI'm also particular about the traditional sauces that come with hibachi dinners. Nakato's ginger sauce was great, but the other creamy sauce was more like tartar sauce, with a little bit of a lemony edge. Never figured out what the chunks in it were... Not bad, but just not what I prefer.\\n\\nStaff was very friendly, valet was complimentary, and the food was good enough for a fix. We'll probably go back.\\n\\n(P.S.

I've been here on 2 occasions. On my first visit, I went there with a group and the shrimp & grits dish was the most memorable - a good amount of shrimps and great texture taste of the grits. I would definitely recommend this dish to anybody on their first visit. On my 2nd visit, I went with my beer enthusiast bf because he looked at their beer menu ahead of time and saw that they had Creature Comfort's Tropicalia on draft. We ordered:\\n\\nEntrees:\\nPorn Dog¬†- house smoked kabano sausage, giardinere, this baby is so big you don't need no stinkin' side / $14.75\\nThey weren't joking about this being big. It was easily enough to split between us. This was just too much. The sausage was already super salty and greasy, so the giardiniera's added spiciness and sourness just made it overbearing. We had to stop eating after about half of each of our portions.\\n\\nMussels - westbrook ipa, garlic, tomato broth / $9.25\\nNow this was absolutely delicious. The mussels themselves were on the small side but there were a lot. Not sure how this is placed in the \\"Starters\\" category, but it would be a great starter for a group of people. Dipping the bread into that garlicky, herbaceous, and rich mussels broth was super satisfying and never gets old. We only wished we had more bread to finish that broth.\\n\\nBeers:\\nCreature Comforts Tropicalia\\nWe've only had this beer in cans and we liked it a lot, and after getting this on draft here, we liked it even more this time! Maybe it was the freshness, or our changed/matured tastebuds. fruity, juicy hops up front balanced with bready malts at the end. Surprisingly we could actually appreciate the malt presence. Noticeably lighter in mouthfeel and other aspects (it was an IPA after all, and not a DIPA like we prefer) but it didn't bother us at all. Very nice balance and we're so grateful to try this on tap at this restaurant.\\n\\nBreckenridge Vanilla Porter Nitro\\nThis beer had a pleasant lactosy? sweetness and it was overall light in body and flavor that paired well with our heavy meal.\\n\\nNext time, we will just get starters.

Next we had a sashimi, I don't remember what kind of fish it was, but it was very good. Each course was better than the next. The third course was fried clams. They were really delicious and the squid ink sauce they came with was amazing. Lastly, we had pork three ways.

My girlfriend got a chocolate tobacco dessert which looked really really cool and I was given an almond lemon bar dessert which didn't look too great. At first sight, I was not excited.

Scallops in Fra Diavlo Sauce- also great fresh scallops but the sauce was not spicy at all.\\n\\nGreat place to try if there is a short or no line but definitely not worth waiting for than 10 minutes in line, especially since there are so many options without a wait in the north end. \\n\\n(They do take credit cards but no Amex)"},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"45 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The wonderful food was overshadowed by abominable service.

I am not impressed. Three strikes and I won't be back. The food is not well priced and it's incredibly greasy. For the same price, I can get a big, juicy burger and fries from a real grill at a real restaurant. Great alternative to McDonalds/Burger King/Checkers if you want to spend twice as much and not go to a restaurant. To be fair, I might have liked Five Guys when I was in college, before my tastes had evolved to exclude fast food. Wait times here tend to be around 8 minutes."},{"name":"Pizzeria Sul Lago","address":"315 1st St","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"Less than a week old, there are still a few kinks to work out. Center stage is a brick oven from Italy. The ambience is casual, the music a little too loud.  Service was fast attentive.  We split a salad, which my wife liked but I was meh.  The pizza crust was good, straight from the oven with a nice crunch. I had the white pizza, it was OK but fairly bland, my wife had the margherita pie which needed more cheese and basil.  Overall, this has promise but need to work on the balance of ingredients.  i. e.  For $14, I expect more than bread and a little pizza sauce.

Excellent bread (especially the brioche), sandwiches are tasty, attractive, fresh and sized just right (about 1.25x the size of a Starbucks egg salad sandwich, so invitingly generous in size without being too much). Unbelievably good roast beef sandwich, beautifully grilled bread on the BLT, fresh and cool hummus sandwich. Neat and secure paper wrap of sandwiches to go holds them together well so they don't get mangled in your bag/briefcase or leak and make a mess. The \\"mosh pit\\" of waiting while your order is filled at the 3 functional stations is a good community experience, even if you're sticking to yourself (we do live with others after all, so it is a moment to do something other than nose-in-smartphone -- hanging out quietly is fine, no need to feel obligated to mingle). Coffee is excellent in flavor and temp, but given the limited number of machines don't expect during rush hour to get a hot Beverage order processed as quickly as places that lead with beverage as why they exist.

We tried brisket, pork robs, beef ribs and sausage. Food was good but not great. We got everything with sauce on the side and nothing blew me away.

Don't get there too early or too late if you've got a complex about being in a quiet downtown restaurant. Too early would be before 7, too late would be after 1030 or 11.

Wish I had gotten the original Benedict or something else instead. The hollandaise sauce was all cream and splattered on top which masked the flavor of the whole dish.

Lemonshark offers a better selection of sizes and doesn't charge extra for certain toppings.\\nI guess this shouldn't be an issue if you want a large serving anyway, but personally I prefer to buy the small size when ordering poke and I wish they offered a smaller serving option for a little less than $12.\\nI do like the mango/pineapple salsa topping though- which is unique- and the dole whip.
