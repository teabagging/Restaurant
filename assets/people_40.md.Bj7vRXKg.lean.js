We came to this restaurant because it participated in Magical Dining Month and she brought those menu's once we requested them. \\n\\nI ordered the crawfish bisque as the starter, the New York Strip and fries as the main and a lemon cheesecake for dessert.

Although they sometimes do include a little bundle of condiments I recommend that while you are waiting for them to make your order that you go to the condiment bar and help yourself to the radishes and if you like something spicy there are carrots and peppers.

All the items and ingredients were spot on but it need something to bring it together. Maybe a sauce? Only because with the bao being a non wet item and the shrimp being fried and the relish being mango chunks, it was kinda dry together. i dont mean dry i flavor but in texture. Maybe instead of a relish, i think a saucey mango/pineapple chutney or some sauce aspect would definitely tie it all together.

The restaurant was sponsored by Adidas and all the servers looked athletic and wore Adidas gear, there was a sports radio show that was hosted in there, they had an in house smoker so the ribs, chicken, and bbq was out of this world, and an epic menu that was quite diverse and included collard greens, mac and cheese, and a variety of other seriously delicious dishes.  Couple that with the fact that is legitimately they only restaurant I have ever seen that has tables with beer taps so that guest can refill their own beers at their table.  \\n\\nFast-forward to today.  Sloppy looking servers in faded t-shirts, a one page paper printed menu with stains and very mediocre food.  Honestly, to say it's a sports bar they only have two burgers on the menu and have limitations on stupid things like not being allowed to split a wing order half and half with flavors.  The drinks come out in plastic cups...it's very very regular and disappointing now.  The only thing saving them is the layout, the great rooftop, and the fact they still have the table bar taps.  \\n\\nThere's now better options for sports bars close to Phillips Arena and the Dome to deal with this place.

It was very good and certainly something different. My food was good. Their entrees come with 2 sides and they have a great selection of those, lots to choose from, plus you could also add on a salad so it could be very filling. My only gripe is that the regular menu lists only 2 beers on draft, Budweiser and Blue Moon. Right below that it specifically states ask your server about local craft beers. Well apparently they don't have any, the server was even joking about Darden owning this chain and that that's not a thing at any of their restaurants. ?? They did have at least a few more draft beers than the 2 that were listed but they're all standard major brands, nothing local. So I feel like they really need to fix their menu.

We beat the rush since we got there around 530. There were people already inside but we we relieved that we didn't have to wait and got seated right in. I love the theme of Salt Lick-- country and family. The restaurant is big! It also sits in a big lot which eliminates parking issues and waiting wouldn't seem too bad since you can walk around and just enjoy the TX weather (ha). There are also benches available guests can sit on and just people or site see. \\n\\nThere are plenty of hosts waiting for guests and as soon as we were shown to our seats, we met our server. Service here is also very fast. We got our order in 10 mins. My hubby ordered the brisket plate while I ordered the ribs. The portions are big so as appetizing as the \\"family\\" plate sounds (all you can eat meats), make sure to know what you're getting yourself into. But if you're really tempted, ask the server and they should tell you the serving portions and give you suggestions. \\n\\nBack to the food--\\nPlates come with beans and potato which we're both okay in my opinion.

They have live music at night and you see families and groups of people just gather around with their BYOB draaaanks and just having fun. I can see this place as the \\"usual\\" hang out spot for people. The vibe is very mellow and casual-- you just can just enjoy yourself.

When meeting for cocktails, it was a surprise on the 10th day that we had 2 other people joining our party, and in fact, Fris was the one to book it. No one knew where we were going. Now normally, this would make me nervous, because I am such a picky eater. But being in the NE, I knew we were safe. The NE means everything to me.  Fris had made a reservation for us at Terramia. The atmosphere is very small, only enough to hold about 40 people. It is very narrow, with lots of commotion with the wait staff since there is so little space. It still feels intimate, and it feels like a nook in Italy rather than in the NE. Bri and I had wanted to split the Caprese, but Fris said no apps. However, we caught him ordering the Carpaccio di Manzo, so we threw in our order. Why was he being so secretive? Why couldn't Bri and I order our app?\\n\\n It was soon forgotten after a few bottles of wine, and the amazing taste of the Caprese. The buratta tasted like sweet butter, with the freshest tomatoes and basil. It was by far, the best burratta I have ever had. For meals, we all enjoyed what we ordered (meat sauce, spagetti con pomodoro, frutti de mar), except Patch who had order regret with his open faced Ravioli. It was weird, and had very little food on the plate. My spaghetti was freshly made, with the most savory and flavorful homemade sauce. Yes, my body thought I was in Italy... or maybe that was just the wine.\\n\\nMy word of caution is the bread. They give 2 types of bread. 1 type of bread is a 3/5, and the other is a 7/5... which means there is a huge difference! Bri was enjoying her piece, while i was in distaste... only to find out we weren't eating the same time. Beware! Look for the right bread! \\n\\nOverall, this has been one of my preferred restaurants of the NE.

We had the Parma (whole basil leaves, salty slices of prosciutto, and just a smattering of cheese). The whole wheat crust was surprisingly good and served as a good base for all the toppings. \\n\\n$16.95 for a large specialty pizza is a good deal considering the quality, but if you choose a plain pie ($11.95 for large) and add your own toppings ($1.50 each), it can be cheaper. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that the \\"foccacia fries\\" topped with EVOO, rosemary, and garlic were not worth $6-- despite being tasty, the skimpy portion size was not a great deal. \\n\\nOverall, I think Mangia is cheaper than Upper Crust and thank goodness, they don't burn their crusts.

My husband and I ate here a few times over the years and average or less would have been a good assessment. Not horrible, but with Angelina's , Scorpio's and Goodfellas close by.. Who needs average for family pizza places. Then we heard that they were remodeling and revamping for Restaurant Impossible, we were ready to try it again. We showed up the day after the reveal and had dinner. I have to say, it was delicious. We had an excellent Caesar salad and probably the most delicious meatballs between here and Prato in Winter Park. Followed by a completely average pizza and horrible service. Now don't get me wrong our server did her best but was yelled at and berated multiple times by the owners. I was a little shocked considering how much she was hustling! But again, it was very clear that someone who knew what they were doing worked on the menu and save for the pizza had managed a miracle in this place. The question is, did it stick two weeks later? I'll give you one guess... nope! \\n\\n\\nSo this is what I have to wonder... Are the owners arrogant to think that they could go back to the same nasty food as before or are they just lazy or perhaps undertrained? I suspect they are arrogant considering the awful way they treat employees and changed the menu so fast. Two weeks later, the Caesar salad dressing tasted as if miracle whip and horseradish were mixed and box croutons tossed on top. No grilled lemon. Just utter laziness. And the meatballs and sauce were equally bland. Gone was the delicate meatballs tossed with pine nuts and light marinara and crostini. In its place was fairly gross meatballs with canned sauce. And of course, since I am sure they know better, a lot of the same crap was back on the menu. \\n\\nClearly these owners took nothing away from the experience except for a remodeled interior. Shame on them for not implementing the changes to improve the food. They should be embarrassed that they were given some 5 star advice and degraded back to 1 star food and experience.

The ceilings are brick vaults in a style that I'm sure is NEVER used in modern times. Enough about architecture, but if you love that stuff, this is your place!\\n\\nFood in detail:\\n Bread = kinda lame Italian bread but the whipped butter made it 100% better. \\n\\nAppetizers: I had the Cesar salad, which was very ordinary with the exception of a giant Parmesan cheese crouton... Can you say YUM? I will get that every time I go there. My friend got the Tuna and said it was so fresh and perfectly prepared. The wasabi sauce it came with was quite savory too.\\n\\nWine: Ok so I'm partial to whites but with beef you have to have  a nice red. We weren't offered many suggestions on a bottle but chose an Argentinean red Bodega Catena Zapata.. I must recommend it if you are going to spring for the bottle. Very tasty and goes perfectly with the steak.\\n\\nEntrees : Who am I kidding we all got steak!  3 of us all got the fillet, I got it with blue cheese crust ( which isn't just blue cheese but bread crumbs and roasted garlic too!)  How do I describe the best steak I've ever eaten?  Juicy, tender, melt in your mouth, cooked with love, swimming in butter ( you can ask for it without of course) Perfectly cooked medium rare. Absolutely fabulous, I couldn't think of any alteration that would make this steak better.  My friend's father had the 22 oz porterhouse and didn't speak a word til he was practically licking the plate.  It was that good!\\n\\nSides: We got the potatoes Au gratin, broccoli Au gratin and 2  orders of Mashed potatoes.  All were very good and freshly made, but the broccoli Au gratin we could have skipped... it was really just broccoli and cheese. Next time we will definitely try the creamed spinach or one pound baked potato (mmmm loaded taters make me happy)\\n\\nDessert: Share them, I'm telling you your stomach will thank you. The molten chocolate cake was delicious with some ice cream. The chocolate sauce that erupts from it is kind of thin and less fudgey so its not too too heavy. Creme brulee was delicious and with the fresh fruit, you almost feel like you are being good!\\n\\nService was excellent, quick and friendly, nuff said about that because they are professionals here.\\n\\n\\nWelp Yelps,\\nWith a beer and tip it ran the 4 of us a little over 400 beans.. yes that's right... most of the steaks on the menu are 40-50 a piece and sides are big enough to share with one other person but run around 11 a piece.

I just recently made my 3rd visit. \\n\\nThe service was great - after walking in, i promptly got seated by one of the waitresses. My waitress took our drink order and it arrived faster than expected. We ordered a pitcher of chicha morada, its a purple juice, it was great. I love the drink. \\n\\nAfterward, we ordered a half chicken combo. It included fried rice with veggies and chicken, as well as french fries. The chicken was great - very well cooked with just the right amount of seasoning. The rice was pretty good. The texture was a little stiff but it was alright none the less. The fries were alright too. The food didnt take long to cook either, which was great since i had to leave soon. \\n\\nThe absolute best part of the meal was this green spicy sauce that they gave us. I believe it was called Spicy Aji. It made everything taste better, went great with fries and amazing with the rice. I definitely recommend it. \\n\\nAfter that, i paid and left. The bill wasnt big either - and i got a ton of food for two. We had to take the leftovers home!\\n\\nNow, i will say that they get busy around lunch and dinner time, so the resturant gets super packed. This causes the staff to get sloppy and start neglecting good service. I recommend coming around 2:00pm or in the morning, just to dodge the traffic. You could also phone ahead and come to pick up your food if you're interested in takeout. \\n\\nThe atmosphere in the resturant was amazing - there was decal around the entire place with the best places to sight see in peru. It felt great to see such thrilling places, even if its just in pictures. Theres also a giant llama in the rear of the place where you could take pictures.

They chat with people at the drive thru if their order is taking a bit longer than expected.  They genuinely seem to enjoy their jobs.\\n\\nThis particular franchise offers a few nice extras:\\n\\n- a frequent user card where once you've accumulated enough punches, you receive a free sandwich\\n- a lovely children's play area (separated by a door from the dining area to minimize noise)\\n- family-friendly activities throughout the week (although \\"daddy-daughter date night\\" weirds me out)\\n- a patio with outdoor seating\\n\\nThis restaurant is kept very clean and the property is well-maintained (the store was built in 2012 or 2013).  Free WiFi is available at most Chick-Fil-A restaurants, I believe.\\n\\nAccessing CFA while going northbound on Sawmill requires you to enter at the light and use the service road around back.  Accessing it going southbound, you use a feeder road that meets up with the service road.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located across from popular shopping destinations like Kohl's, Target, and Dick's Sporting Goods, so it's a good place to refuel before moving on to your next big shopping destination.\\n\\nI've been a regular for Saturday morning breakfast runs.  They open at 6:30, but business really starts to pick up as early as 7:00-7:30.

Definitely a win there too.\\n\\nI'm not sure you can actually get a burger here, which is fine by me.  They do chicken well, from sandwiches to nuggets (although those nuggets can be quite miniscule).  Food orders arrive plenty hot and the waffle fries are tasty and are sufficiently crispy.  Don't forget to ask about dipping sauces for your chicken or fries--there are plenty to pick from, including Chick-Fil-A sauce, which has the creamy consistency of honey mustard (but honey mustard is also on the menu).\\n\\nMy only concern would be the lack of vegetarian items on the menu; vegetarians are limited to fries/tots and maybe a garden salad.  A veggie burger of some sort would be nice.\\n\\nIf you're in the Sawmill Rd. area and are in a bit of a hurry, Chick-Fil-A is a good solid option if you're a meat-eater.  Just don't forget:  they're closed on Sundays.

The Bostonian friend loves the roast beef, and I got the chicken & avocado as a salad.  They only have a balsamic vinaigrette dressing, which has egg (I asked why it wasn't vegan because I can't have most dairy), and I wasn't a huge fan of it... but I can't take a star off for that since I don't like balsamic vinaigrette anywhere.

It's a Cuban restaurant, and that my friends is a very important distinction. Pambiche is the real deal, and it's also really delicious.

I preferred the jam√≥n with creole b√©chamel and peppercorn, while my lunch date preferred the pulled chicken with chorizo. But really, we were just splitting hairs, as each was delicious. An order comes with 4, which was more than we had expected. \\n\\nFor lunch I had Ropa Vieja: adobo shredded beef with yellow onions, green peppers, a tomato broth and peas. It's served on a bed of your choice between black or red beans and rice or Moros y Chrisianos. I went with the latter, which is still just black beans and rice, but is somehow different? I don't know. Anyhow, it was crazy tasty, though heavier than I had anticipated. At only $8.75, it was a filling lunch at a beyond reasonable price. In the name of trying out more of the menu, I'd probably get something different on my next visit. That being said, I'd easily recommend this dish to anybody. \\n\\nI was super impressed with the aesthetic of the space. The artwork and colors definitely reference their Cuban roots, but it's not so \\"HEY WE ARE CUBAN!\\" It is bright, festive and while I've never been to Cuba, it certainly reminds me of the places I have visited throughout the Caribbean.

So let me help you figure out whether or not to make the trip.\\n\\nThe word that comes to mind when I think of this restaurant is precious. The menu is very limited and isn't dumbed down for the average American palate. Everything is made from 'scratch' and they specialize in gluten-free dining. I highly recommend you check the menu in advance (it changes on the first Tuesday of every month) to make sure that (a) you find something you'll enjoy and (b) don't have sticker shock. This is not a place where I would bring my kids.\\n\\nMy first visit was for cocktails and dessert since I usually like to give nicer restaurants a test run before a full meal. The chocolate lava cake was one of my favorite desserts in 2010. The cocktails were well made and the service was excellent. All of my other visits have been for lunch when I'm dining solo. \\n\\nHonestly, I've kind of been keeping this place to myself for awhile. The price point makes it a bit of a splurge restaurant and not something most people are willing to spend for your average lunch or dinner. Portions are relatively small, so I never go when I'm starving. This is my go to place in Lake Oswego when I want to have an elegant, healthy meal. I'm especially fond of their soups.\\n\\nThe space is tiny. About six seats at the bar and a handful of tables. For my lunch visits, I always sit at the bar and chat with Robert. I have a feeling we'll all be hearing more about the chef, Patrick Lee Warner, but as far as I'm concerned, this is Robert's place. Lunch service was introduced a few months ago and still isn't very busy, so I always feel like I have the place almost all to myself.\\n\\nA few months back, I had a disastrous experience at a Portland restaurant where they served me an inedible version of zucchini.

We'll win you back.\\" He absolutely did. \\n\\nThis is five star place for me because I truly enjoy the staff, their vision and the menu.

Those two factors would make me think that when I came with my party of five to ask for a table the service would be a bit more inclined to, I dunno, serve.  The place was FULLY empty and they told me that all the tables were reserved.  And they didn't say it apologetically, they said it like this is a thing they do on the regular; reserve their entire place and wait patiently in silence for those reservers to show up.\\n\\nI know this is kind of a lot to write about a place I didn't go to, but I'm honestly blown away by how this place manages to survive in a prime location with nobody in it and nothing really to offer.

There's something circumspect about a place that is often hailed as 'cheap' and 'sushi' in one sentence, but we decided to take a chance none the less, on Yanagi. It's in our neighborhood, and we hoped to find something special nearby, a place we could call our 'own'. \\n\\nAnd Yanagi is IT. Not only were the rolls plentiful and well-made, but Oh. My. Gawd. Everything about the place was better than we'd hoped for! Now keep this in mind, this is coming from an Alaskan transplant, and from 2 folks who'd lived in Seattle, where seafood and sushi are of the best quality and available 24/7. We were not disappointed with Yanagi at all. In fact, we're pretty sure we found 'our' place.\\n\\nWe started out with a seaweed salad, which we were informed, is always sent out gratis when you sit at the sushi bar. Then we had 2 bowls of pretty decent miso. Not the best ever, but not bad. Then... the rolls. We ordered some nigiri of saba and hokigai, and a variety of rolls: the caterpillar roll, the crunchy roll, the 3 times a lady roll, and an umeshiso roll. The caterpillar was sweet and salty, and chock full of great fresh ingredients. The 3 times a lady roll didn't knock our socks off, but that's due to our preferences, not the roll itself. The crunchy roll was to die for. I could eat a platter of those all day long, sweet, spicy, crunchy, chewy, all the right flavors and textures at once. And the umeshiso isn't on the menu, but I always get that at sushi bars, and when I ordered it, the senior sushi chef knew what I wanted, and taught the junior trainee who was serving us how to make it. \\n\\nThen it turned out the senior chef had also lived in Seattle and Alaska too, so we chatted about that, and the camaraderie that makes a great sushi bar began. The chef started sending out handrolls and different tastes of things. We talked about this and that, and had a great time getting to know each other. \\n\\nAnd after stuffing ourselves to overflowing- nearly painful really- we got our bill, and it was only $42 for all that amazing food!!! We will definitely be back, again and again and again. I only hope that more people go there, because as someone else wrote, there weren't that many folks there the night we dined, and I would hate to see them go under.\\n\\nEat at Yanagi's!

Going through the Nickelodeon Studios tour and seeing Clarissa Explains It All being filmed as well as trying \\"slime\\" (It was applesauce and food coloring?) Plus seeing the slime fountain out front was awesome. Fun fact: They did a time capsule in 1992 and when the studios shut down they moved it to the Nickelodeon Suites Resort where it is set to be opened in April 30th, 2042. Some things include: VHS tapes, CDs, Reebok Pump Sneakers, Jar of Gak (can't wait to smell that one!), a Barbie doll, roller blades and a ton of other things. Can't wait!\\n\\nThis is where you come ride the movies and well...live them too. I always spot something new in the decorations or run into a new character roaming the streets.

The illusion was destroyed forever. This ride had one of my favorite queues of all time, possibly because I was such a fan of the movie. They had the Delorian outside with Doc Brown roaming around from time to time...the video introduction was cool and the little waiting room right before you board had the hoverboard.\\n\\nJaws - Another legend bites the dust to make room for Harry Potter expansion - I ain't mad at that! Just because the film was so iconic this ride was a stand out even after MANY YEARS of no upgrades. The story pretty much remained the same, you shot Jaws, he came back, you shot him again, some things exploded, you ended up in a boat house, shot him one last time and it was over.\\n\\nKing Kong - I was terrified as a child. Nothing more needs to be said.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ones that are still around and the new additions are great:\\n\\nTerminator 3D - A big fan of the movie it was cool to see it come to life.\\n\\nMen In Black - A little kiddie for me, but I am sure the kids love it.\\n\\nTwister - Still cool to see and also has an AWESOME queue. \\n\\nShrek 4D - Also for the kids, but a cool experience.\\n\\nRevenge Of The Mummy - Not a big fan of the movie but this ride is just awesome! The story is great, the effects are great, you go backwards and then into a high speed coaster....all while in the dark. I dig it!\\n\\nThe Simpsons - Replaced back to the future and did a great job! Bringing a big name like the Simpsons is exactly what Universal needed to draw back patrons. I love the set up outside and I hear they are adding a ton more Simpson inspired shops, which would be cool to grab a slushie. \\n\\nRip Ride Rockit - FINALLY! A roller-coaster (outside)! This is a great experience as you choose your soundtrack and film a music video. I chose Kanye West and rapped into the camera the entire time. I look like a fool, but it was fun. THAT 90 degree ascent in the beginning is one of the WORST experiences I have ever had on a roller coaster...hate that feeling, but once it turns the top, it's all good!\\n\\nHaven't done Transformers yet, but another great addition and I read the new Harry Potter expansion will be great! Can't wait for those.

In fact, the restaurant was practically empty when I came in. \\n\\nThe design of the restaurant is reminiscent of a 70s diner back in the day. Barber shop style checkerboard tiles line the floor, tables and booths lined with swivel chairs are spread across the room. There's a cafeteria style area in the back which is probably a buffet area or something on the weekends.\\n\\nI was quickly seated and given a menu to look at. I already knew I wanted to try the chicken and waffles so I ordered immediately. The food too around 15 minutes to arrive, kinda long since the restaurant was empty at the time. \\n\\nThe dish arrived as two chicken sandwiches, with fried chicken in the middle and waffle as the bun. The waffle had deep pockets like a belgian waffle but was a lot fluffier and lighter. It held together pretty well and soaked up the juices of the chicken and syrup. \\n\\nThe chicken was okay. The breading was crispy and had lots of grooves and edges just the way I like. They served white meat for the chicken, which tasted a little dry to me. You know sometimes when you get fried chicken and the breast meat is bland and stringy? That's how the chicken tasted to me. I'm sure a brine or buttermilk bath would improve the taste a lot more, not sure if they already did that. \\n\\nI usually judge the service by how attentive my server is, from checking up on my table to filling my water cup. I guess it was early, but my server rarely came over and spent most of the time talking to the rest of the employees. \\n\\nOverall the experience is different for me since I came on a weekday morning.

One thing they do exceptionally well are the crispy parcels... there is no reason they should be that f*-ing good.

No complaints whatsoever on the appetizer front.

I would honestly prefer to give them 4, but can't quite seem to do it.  \\n\\nTen years ago when I lived in Quincy, I took my sister to Giacomo's based on a some good reviews and word of mouth.  This was prior to Rachael Ray's endorsement (the kiss of death for transforming a decent local joint into the ninth circle of hell teeming with loudmouth tourists.)  What I remember is a lobster linguine with sauce so sublime that I licked my plate.  I'm the consummate slob, but that's even a mite disgusting for me.  In other words, this was some good freakin' sauce.  \\n\\nThis is a family-style joint with big plates and a basic menu, where you choose a sauce, meat, and noodle.  But unlike other paint-by-numbers places, the food was actually good.  The Macaroni Grill this was not.  Is not?  \\n\\nMy dad and I are back east right now, and I couldn't wait to take him to Giacomo's. \\n\\nShould've heeded the warnings.  Every local that we spoke with practically rolled their eyes while giving us directions to Giacomo's.   I considered the possibilities:  \\n\\nThe food is crap now.  \\nThe service is crap now.\\nThey are just sick of tourists asking about this particular place.  \\n\\nI'm an optimist about food, so I went with option 3.  \\n\\nThe wait wasn't very long (it was a rainy Tuesday night) and the waitress looked like she wanted to put me in a headlock when I asked her what the \\"Giacomo sauce\\" was before she got a chance to complete her menu explanation spiel.  \\nOtherwise, she seemed like a nice lady that would probably take in stray animals and babysit your kids on a moment's notice.  \\n\\nThe caesar salad was just average.  It didn't exactly suck.  The dressing wasn't too tangy, too thick, or too anything.  It wasn't bad, but it was far from memorable.  The very middle of meh.  \\n\\nMy dad ordered a plate of the fried mozzarella.  This was a little bit better, the batter was very light which and the mozzarella wasn't rubbery which (in my determination) are the only factors that prevent this dish from tasting like it came from TGI Friday's.  \\n\\nToo bad they slathered it in marinara sauce that wasn't unpalatable, but was of a similarly unmemorable variety.  \\n\\nWe moved on to the pasta special with fusili in the \\"Giacomo\\" sauce (bechamel and marinara combined)  with chunks of lobster and shrimp.  I don't know why everybody thinks that a 20 dollar and beyond price tag on pasta is such a bargain.  I don't.  And I don't care if it is topped with gold leaf and truffled Harvard diplomas.  \\n\\nThat said, the lobster was delicious and the folks at Giacomo's do not skimp portion-wise.  I only ate about a quarter of the pasta and I felt painfully bloated afterwards.  Generosity is not a problem here.  \\nThe sauce was good, the pasta al dente, and the shrimp decent but overcooked.  This was good stuff, but not the Giacomo's pasta of my memory.  It was not a transcendent experience, but merited a few Mmmms.  \\n\\nI got plenty of time to consider the virtues of this meal as it repeated on me until midnight that night.  \\n\\nGo to Giacomo's and don't expect to be blown away by the appetizers. \\nMy guess is that they do fried appetizers well, so stick with those, and any entree involving lobster."},{"name":"Native Bowl","address":"4233 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this cart specifically the Alberta bowl.

I have suggested that many many visitors and locals as well go to this restaurant for some great Cuban food. Unfortunately, after my last visit I will not be coming here any more. Now, you may think that this decision is a bit harsh, however, the service and the food quality has been declining for a while but I was in denial (the service faster than the food quality). The time before last after having an ok meal I passed it off as the waiter just being in a bad mood, but I just can't use that excuse again. \\n\\nMy husband and I chose to eat here because we were craving some good Cuban food. Upon our arrival, we were asked where we wanted to sit and since the rain let up we decided to sit outside. Sitting ourselves at the small tables the hostess asked us if we wanted a larger table and we said we were ok. When our waiter came out to take our order he became angry and told us we couldn't sit there. He probably was trying, in his own way, to warn us about the impending rain, but at the time we were just trying to figure out why he was so angry at us. Well, the rain started so we moved to the larger table and again he came out, not to our table but to speak to another waitress obviously  rolling his eyes and talking about us. We couldn't believe what was going on - you can't make this stuff up . My husband asked the waitress that our waiter was speaking to if there was a problem, because after taking our initial order our waiter never came back to check on us, and she replied that there was no problem. We were dumbfounded as to why the waiter had seemingly chosen to abandon us and tried to recollect the interaction after receiving our food which was delivered by yet another waitress. \\n\\nThe food was just ok and we had to flag someone down to get more water.

We actually asked for and received a copy of the menu so we could remember what we ate.  We also carefully chose different items so that we never duplicated anything and could try the full range of porky goodness that Tony Maws and company was serving that night.  We also splurged on the drink pairings which were all spot on and complimented their dishes very well.\\n\\nThey started us off with Les Cochonailles, which was a small dish with many bite sized tasting of pork.  The fried crouton of pork cheek was a divinely salty treat, as was a small dollop of pate where I think the goal was to make a tastier version of deviled ham.  Mission accomplished.  Lastly was a light and fatty pork rind that didn't even require chewing.  You just put it on your mouth and allowed it to melt.  This was paired with a 2007 Sydre 'Argelette\\", Eric Bordelet.\\n\\nSecond choice for me was a salad of crisphy-fried pig ears and fresh shrimp with watercress, frisee, beets and bacon vinaigrette.  Surprising the pork did not overwhelm the dish.  The ears are less porky but chewy and long lasting.  I'm not really a fan of beets, but when combined with everything else they mixed into a very tasty mouthful of food.  This came with a 2008 Pinot Blanc, Domaine Meyer-Fonee\\n\\nFor my date it was the red chile-rubbed St. Louis pork ribs with pickled peanuts, toasted garlic and jalapeno.  They were a bit to spicy to her heat-averse tongue but I thought the heat built up nicely towards the end and was very enjoyable.  This came with and Olde School Barleywine from Dogfish Head.\\n\\nFor the next course she had the blood sausage tagliatelle with suckling pig ragout and maitake mushrooms paired with a 2009 SP68, Occchipinti. The pork saugage was fantastic and really went well with the win. \\n\\nMy choice was the rye flour fusilli with a ragout of pork heart sausage and sea urchin.  Of the two pasta dishes this was by far our favorite.  The urchin lent a nice additional saltiness when you stumbled onto a piece.  This came with a 2008 Beta Delta, Tanutae Lageder.\\n\\nMy choice for the next course was braised pork cheeks with pig tongue confit, country sausage and garbanzo bean cassoulet.  Had etiquitte allowed I'd have licked this plate clean.  I managed to maintain my composure and simply scrape as much goodness off my plate with a fork as could be had.  This came with a 2009 Beaujolais Villages, Damien Coquelet.\\n\\nShe got the Berkshire pork belly with morcilla (a Spanish blood sausage), bluefoot mushrooms, tangerines and pistachio butter.  All was fantastic and once again the ingredients really complement each other and the wine.  My date is not a huge fan of mushrooms but loved them in this dish.  This was served with a 2009 Chinon 'Les Galuches\\", Jean-Maurice Raffault.  \\n\\nAfter a refreshing grapefruit-Campari sorbet with champagne foam we moved onto dessert.  Mine was a huge piece of bourbon and pecan ice cream tart with lard crust and crunch bacon on top.  By itself it was absolutely decadent.  It was served with a Farmhouse Flip, which if memory serves (I had to ask the waiter as the ingredients were not on the menu) was essentially a shot of espresso, bourbon and a few spices.  It was the absolute opposite of sweet and I enjoyed it alone but when mixed with a bite of the tart it was even better.  \\n\\nShe got the cornbread pain perdu with bacon and pineapple caramel and buttermilk ice cream.  I wish I could make cornbread so melt in your mouth sweet and delicious.  It came with a 2009 Lambrusco Biano, Lini 910.  \\n\\nThis was more than a meal, it was an eating experience.  For us, probably a once a year at best experience because of the cost but well worth pinching pennies to insure that you can pull it off. \\n\\nIf you have considered visiting Craigie on Main but haven't yet I encourage you to save your money, eat in for a few weeks and make the trip.

Tasty banh mi? Vegetarian too? I'm down! \\n\\nI rolled up at 1:30 on a weekday to find the cute little trailer park off of Airport. There's this truck, a po'boy truck, the Mmmpanadas truck, a coffee truck, and Short Bus. I knew I was coming here though so I made a quick beeline over to the stand where one other guy was in line. \\n\\nI knew I wanted the monk sandwich, hold the peppers, with a side of seasoned fries. Hey, if I'm going to hell might as well do up the basket real nice. And besides, I am carbo-loading for my first triathlon! \\n\\nAbout 10 minutes later, the food came fresh off the truck. I literally burned my fingers handling the fries and the I almost cauterized the roof of my mouth with the molten hotness of fried tofu innards. Though I give this place 5 stars and would most willingly come back any day of the week, there were some things that I wanted to point out for anyone wanting to order this tofu sandwich...and general sandwich engineering tips that I can't help but point out. \\n\\n1) The tofu is good. It's sliced rather thick. That's the thing about alternative protein sources...they just don't quite shine when they're handled the same way as animal proteins are. The textural contrast of this sandwich would be monumentally improved if the tofu were sliced thinner. More surface area to be fried (for the textural contrast) and less molten hot tofu innards. Let's think about this...everyone likes fried tofu because of the skin on the tofu. That's why the Protein 2000 is such a hit at Veggie Heaven...because it has chew and texture that's NOT like tofu!  I had to wait about 30 minutes to eat the sandwich. I am NOT complaining as this sandwich was FRESH as all get out but if I have 1 hr to eat then...I'm sad Asian face for 30 minutes. \\n\\n2) The tofu was lacquered in sauce...albeit mostly delicious sauce...it was a little sweet. Too sweet in my opinion. \\n\\n3) Cucumbers, though delicious, were sliced too thick. I pulled 3-4 slices out of my sandwich sliced at about 1/4 inch thick in cross length slices that spanned the entire thickness of the sandwich. This adds to...\\n\\n4) How big the sandwich was! Not complaining just...I can't competently eat the sandwich because my jaw doesn't unhook (damn it) and because..\\n\\n5) The avocado was spread into the seam of the sandwich. The bread was sliced open and the first ingredient was soft avocado spread into the seam of the sandwich that then followed with gargantuan slices of cucumber, and tofu. Everything in this sandwich is huge....which is great but it's hard to eat competently due to the lack of integrity. And sadly, the avocado soggifies the bread so that it starts to fall apart amidst the giant jaw stretching that it takes to eat this behemoth. Again, not complaining. \\n\\nI think it would have been much better had the avocado been spread against one side of the bread. I ordered mine with egg and it was perfectly cooked. Veggies were fresh and the bread...so perfect. They got that part right down.\\n\\nFries were hot, crispy, and well seasoned. \\n\\nThe people who took my order were great, courteous, and nice.  I really like this place and hope they do well. I don't doubt that they will...they seem to have a good thing going and a nice catchy shtick (Ni Haowdy fries!)"},{"name":"Strega Italiano - Seaport","address":"One Marina Park Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Came for drinks\\n\\nThe restaurant is absolutely beautiful, more specifically the bar area.

I went and told everyone about this place. First off the staff there was wonderful. They were kind, and on top of everything, and they were very helpful with choosing the dishes. First we started off with drinks and appetizers. I ordered a cappuccino which was the best cappuccino I've ever had in my life. Then came out milk buns. I didn't even know what this was. It was the softest bread I've ever had in my life with such a great flavor. It was almost like a yeast roll but when I cut into it it was like cutting into butter. Then we have a conch fritters which had a taste that was unlike any conch fritter I've ever had. Sometimes it can have a fishy taste this absolutely did not. Then we had what was called up plantain flatbread and that was just late but bold in flavor. Then we could choose from a salad or soup. I decided to choose the soup because a salad you can get anywhere. Although the salads did look good when they came out. I got the potato soup which was blended and thick but so light it wasn't too heavy. The flavor was simple yet awesome. Then came dinner time and I asked the waitress what was the best entr√©e on the menu that we were presented. She said absolutely hands-down it was the fried chicken with collard greens and macaroni and cheese. I thought how can this be the best plate in a nice fancy restaurant like this. She told me the flavors were very different from the typical macaroni and cheese and fried chicken. So I went ahead and ordered it and boy was she right. I just could not get enough of this dish. The flavors were so so different and so incredible. She told me that the chicken is slow cooked for hours then they soak it in buttermilk and pan fry it ... amazing! Then of course, came dessert. I had the choice of Tiramisu or white chocolate panna cotta with chocolate crumble and chocolate Crema. The consistency of this was almost like a flan but a little more custardy.

You can also order food \\"to go\\", which was a 45 minute wait, which I noticed a lot of families did.  (Everything is cash only, FYI.)  There's a children's play area with tons of tables, so people brought their food out there.\\n\\nThe long wait didn't deter us, though, because this was on my husband's wishlist for our trip to Austin!  Once we were seated, we ordered right away to chow down!  All of us adults indulged in Thurman's Choice plates with brisket, pork ribs, and sausage.  I had a double helping of the potato salad (one scoop substituted for slaw, which isn't my thing) and they bring you pickles and bread if you ask.  I'd eaten at the Salt Lick in Round Rock on a visit back in 2011, so I was excited to eat at the original.  The brisket was outstanding as I remembered, and the potato salad doesn't have mayonnaise from what I can tell; it's more of their yellow BBQ sauce than anything.

But my one issue - and it's a big one, unfortunately - is that they sell day old bread at full price. Even Matchstick who does a better loaf of sourdough bread charges 40% less if the bread is a day old. I have no problem buying bread that was baked the day before, and sure, it tastes pretty good.

I first discovered this little hole in the wall gem that Orlando has to offer about 2 years ago when they first opened. I have since been back multiple times and decided to give them a well deserved five stars. \\n\\nTo start, the location of King Bao is probably the only negative I could find about this restaurant. It is located on Mills and 50 and if you aren't paying attention you can miss it easily. Here's a tip for parking, instead of trying to park on Mills, go for the lot behind the restaurant on Thornton. It is a open lot for many of the restaurants on that strip. When you are walking to find the front door, just look for the King Bao character on the window, a giant bao bun with a crown on top. \\n\\nWhen you get inside the menus are to your immediate right. Keep in mind there are 2 menus, one standard and one special. Check out both in my posted pictures. If there is any line do not worry, it always moves quick. \\n\\nFor this visit, I opted for the 3 bao combo which comes with your choice of bao's and soda. I had The Cuban, Kickin Chicken and OMG (all pictured). The Cuban's mojo pork was to die for! It was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. The Kickin Chicken was amazing as well, the sriracha aioli added a perfect kick to the chicken. The OMG fish was a great flavor mashup of a perfectly cooked fish and slaw with tartar sauce. We ended with the Tarzan which is a fried bao bun with Nutella, powdered sugar and a sliced banana in the middle. This was a perfect ending to yet another amazing visit to King Bao!

I was full halfway through, and that is saying something since I usually can eat 2 bowls of this stuff. \\n\\nWhile I think it's definitely worth the money, I don't know if I could consistently come in due to the fact that there are too many other options in Allston and especially in that area.

When you sit down at a table, the servers will bring you a menu.

Talk about fresh.\\n\\nAfter having some drinks and guac, we went to check out the back part of the restaurant. There is a bar that opens up to an outside patio that overlooks a beautiful lake. While sitting outside, the bartender grabbed us a few of their in-house beers (which tasted like Blue Moon) and directed us over to a little wooden porch area that overlooks the lake. This area has some seating, but is relatively open and allows for people to dance around a little bit. The combination of a beautiful view, good music, and some drinks made this area the place to be for the rest of that night. \\n\\nOverall, Rocco's has everything that one would look for in a Mexican Bar in an area like Doctor Phillips. The good drinks and beautiful views combine to make for an evening that can be both wild and relaxing at the same time. I'm not sure about you, but there aren't many places I can think of that provide those features simultaneously, so I'll be sure to be back on future nights."},{"name":"Nubian Queen Lola's Cajun Soul Food","address":"1815 Rosewood Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"If I were to give a review for the owners social work and community efforts it would be 5 stars.\\n\\nBut if we're talking specifically the food then this place deserves a one star, which is difficult to do.\\n\\nI love authentic creole food, but this is far from that.

So we went to the windows where there is a rail, but then we were told you couldn't sit there to wait.  We then went to the hightops right behind the bar, and tried to wait there.  Again we were told, that was for guests that were seated by the hostess.  Neither of us still knows what she meant by trying to find a comfortable place to wait, since the entire space is to be seated by the hostess.  It is also very narrow, so there is not really a space to wait by the bar.  \\n\\nMy fiance tried it for lunch one day.  He noted they were out of two beers, and he was never offered water.  That should be an automatic.  He then got the Roast Pork Banh Mi with Spicy Aioli and House Pate and the chicken coconut soup.  The soup was a typical thai soup and was tasty. However, the waitress almost took it away half full.  Granted it comes in a coffee cup and it may be hard to see in at the taller tables or bar, but it still was odd to him.  He said the Bahn Mi sandwich was good.\\n\\nThat being said, the construction of the burger really bothered him.  IT CONTAINED 3 TO 4 COLD CUTS FROM LIKE OSCAR MEYER.  It had something like bologna in it.  As far as the roast pork, it too looked like cold cuts, but he did say it may have just been something like a roasted pork loin sliced very thin.  As for the House Pate the name prominently featured on the menu, it contained a small smear of pate that was not that detectable taste wise, when he was expecting something more like slices based upon the description.\\n\\nAnother downside is they won't take reservations.  The place is packed with no where to wait comfortably.  The lack of reservations really doesn't make sense.  In addition, my fiance noted that three men left as they were seated at the bar because the seats were too close together.  They probably could do with one less seat around the bar, but I am sure they won't given that is more revenue.  There are also not a lot of spaces for groups larger than 4, and I am sure the wait would be considerable.\\n\\nWe loved Blue Ginger when we visited it, and I know Chef Tsai is trying to create a more casual pub atmosphere, but we did expect more from Blue Dragon.

With that said, the service spoiled the night. We had this one older guy, old school italian sort of guy. First off, doesn't give a menu, tells you to look at the wall. Finally gave us one after a few minutes after we started looking online for a menu/food images. We then had a question on the menu, and asks us to how we think we should interpret the menu based on the ingredients in a very condescending manner. We then proceed to order, tells us we can indeed order what we originally asked, but forgets to write down my order and takes down something else instead. Needless to say that he brings something else out for me, and argues when I tell him I wanted the other item. He tried making up for it by offering what I ordered, but at that point I just wanted to get out ASAP. \\n\\nSo, good food, perhaps try another location. If you go here, don't expect good customer service (we asked another lady for the check and she told us she wasn't our server).

O'Sullivan's","address":"151 Central Ave","city":"Lynn","stars":"3.5","text":"While I generally think of three stars as less-than-stellar, the Yelp descriptions of \\"A-OK\\" versus \\"Yay! I'm a fan\\" leave me believing three stars is appropriate. \\n\\nThis place was okay. The positives were many: it's another business in Lynn trying to establish itself, we were seated right way, the place was clean and modern looking, the burgers were decent, the staff was accommodating and pleasant, and they serve alcohol. Just the fact that they are a burger joint that serves alcohol already gave them +stars in my point. The onion rings were AWESOME. Like the best I have found in the North Shore thus far, awesome. If I had nothing to do and some friends wanted to try this place out, I would go back for beer/wine and onion rings. I didn't even mind the fact that everything kind of took forever, and one of the waitresses had been hired that afternoon and thrown into the lions den--they were all holding their own for a brand spankin' new restaurant. I have opened restaurants myself as a server, and they seem to be doing quite well.\\n\\nThe negatives, for me, were enough to probably not go back. Firstly, the $10 cheeseburger & FF/OR plate for an average cheeseburger seemed steep, but I am not cheap, so I am already over it, I just wanted to mention it. I ordered a mudslide on the rocks (Kahlua, Baileys, Vodka--I even mentioned these ingredients just to be sure), and received a white russian (Kahlua, vodka, milk), in a small highball, filled to the brim with ice, for another $10. I did not send it back, just drank my sweet milk quickly and ordered another, making sure he knew there was milk in it when there should not have been, and if it came with Baileys instead this time, \\"yes, I would have another.\\" Husband had a Miller bottle. The tables were so tight that it made me uncomfortable. Here I am, trying to eat this unnecessarily wide, messy burger and some big guy's ass is almost touching my elbow. It was extremely loud, but not in a way that upset me because everyone seemed happy. But the loudness, coupled with the tight confines left me uncomfortable. Parking was tough, as expected. My main objection was that I spent almost $60 at a burger joint with cafeteria seating for three drinks and two burger plates. I have spent $110 on just myself for an amazing meal in Boston, and it was worth every penny, so I am definitely not cheap, but I do appreciate value, and it just didn't hit the mark for me. $35 should have been what I spent here. \\n\\nI hope you try it at least once. Nothing was bad, per say, just overpriced. Maybe they will make adjustments as time goes on. I'm sure someone will ask me to go with them again at some point. I would recommend sitting at the bar, definitely get some onion rings, and try their beer or wine instead of a mixed drink...\\n\\nI should mention that I went 6PM on a Thursday."},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite places to take a first date.

Their food is a blend of original Texas style BBQ with a hint Hawaiian sweetness, and it's very subtle too. I love it! They keep your glass filled, and they have an awesome buffet option too if you can't get enough meat, like me! The only reason I can't give a full 5 star (even though the rating is) is because the meat doesn't fully live up to my minds expectation, which I know isn't fair. Their beans are a bit plain, and their coleslaw is a little too sour. I know they also make. Their famous Texas toast in house, but it just tastes like a regular Burger King bun with excess sesame seeds on top. However, it's free with order. Just make Sure to ask for it. You can also get free pickles and onion with your order, which really helps cut through the fattiness of the meat. Overall I would give this place a 4.8 out of 5.

We also had the Mortadella (Bolognian Emulsified Sausage, Pistachio) and two cheeses: Fritzenhaus Gruy√®re and the chef's choice, which was a semi-soft goat cheese. To me, the star of the evening was smoked shallot marmalade-wow!

There were so many problems that I feel the need to write a list: \\n\\n1. It took almost 15 minutes for the server to take our drink order. \\n2. Once he took our order, it took over an HOUR to get our food. \\n3. We ordered an appetizer that was forgotten despite the fact that we asked the server about it one time. \\n4. Once we got our food, each and every plate was served freezing cold. Who wants to eat cold eggs!? We were out late the evening before and were starving by the time we got our food so ANYTHING should have tasted amazing, but alas every thing that we ate was stale and cold. \\n5. A few people at the table asked for their plates to be reheated and the others suffered thorough our meals. Of course the re-heating process took so long that half of us were done eating by the time we got our plates back. \\n6. FINALLY a manager came over and asked how everything was today. We wanted to be nice but at this point we had been there for well over 2 hours and were still not happy with the service or food. So, one of my friends nicely explained what our experience was. The manager was fantastic and said he would then take a percentage off each of our bills and apologized again and again. \\n7. Manager returns our bills and only took a percentage off 2 of the bills, the rest of us had cold food, stale bread, slow service, and STILL had to pay full price.

Bring CASH. \\n\\nTotally worth the wait. Order the special for two with wine. It's a huge portion and the seafood is fresh. This restaurant has an open-kitchen concept and seating at the bar, service is polite and relatively quick. The restaurant is small so don't be alarmed or too uncomfortable if the hostess seats you elbow-to-elbow with another party... that seems to be the norm here (as my boyfriend and I were seated at a table for 4 with another couple). \\n\\nThe seafood was a tad bit over-cooked (scallops and mussels were chewy and on the tougher side but still relatively tender). The lobster was cooked to perfection, and the noodles were al dente. The special is HUGE so after waiting in line for 2 hours, just know that you'll probably be ravenous and you and your friend might just be able to finish the entire dish. We ended up eating the rest of the seafood and left the noodles in that wonderfully tomato-ey Giacomo's sauce.\\n\\nSince we put our names on the list the day of, we ended up waiting in line for 2 hours... A con about this restaurant is that you can't just leave your name and number and come back when a table is ready... so maybe they can fix that system. Overall, I think one time to wait in line for 2 hours is enough but if I'm ever in Boston again, I'll be sure to make a reservation (if they allow it), or arrive at the restaurant much earlier. For a tourist, this was an excellent meal. Highly recommend it for a special night out or celebration.\\n\\nNote: I took the \\"T\\" (metro) to this area and walked to Giacomo's even though I had a rental vehicle... the parking in this area just seems insane and Boston drivers enjoy honking too much; therefore, I'd highly recommend other tourists to do the same.

To start, I got a Frozen Strawberry Margarita served in a pineapple. It tasted delicious. I only wish that the core of the pineapple was also taken out because then more margarita could be poured in its place! My boyfriend got a Premium Margarita and had no complaints there. For an appetizer I ordered the Chips and Salsa Trio since it was only $3! The house salsa and the mesquite smoked salsa were my favorite. The mesquite had the perfect balance of smokiness and heat. I'm not a huge fan of salsa verde but it still tasted good to me and had a little kick to it. For my entree I ordered the Pink Tacos. They come with a large side of Mexican rice and pinto beans. I don't eat pinto beans but the Mexican rice was hot and tasty. I thought the tacos looked small initially, but I was completely full from this entree by the end of it. The achiote chicken was seasoned amazingly. The only thing I would've changed is that next time I will ask for flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas since the corn tortillas were a little hard to take bites out of.

I had The Salt Lick BBQ bookmarked since my fellow yelp friends had reviewed this place so highly. And seeing such a high rating, I figured this had to be the place to have some mighty fine barbecue. Well I was surly wrong.\\n\\nMy husband and I came to this place, roughly a 30 mile drive from Austin, on a Sunday (parking is free). After we parked and walked over to this restaurant, we saw a booth where we had to put our name down for a table. Then were directed to another booth to pick up a pager. This pager can reach over to the Salt Lick Cellar that is just a short walk from the restaurant, with outdoor seating and heat lamps (unfortunately only 1 heat lamp seemed to be working on the day we came). Please note that the outdoor seating area is not covered and the day we came it was raining off and on. \\n\\nAnyways, we were told that wait time would be about 45-60 minutes for a table. About thirty minutes later, our pager was buzzing and were seated, by this time, it was 4:23 pm. We were placed at a small table in the very far corner. I was afraid that we would be forgotten since we were kind of by ourselves. Eventually a server came by and he greeted us but he said he didn't know if he was our server since he just came onto his shift. But he said he would take our order down anyway (he ended up being our sever)\\n\\nWe ended ordering:\\n\\nChicken Plate, $13.95 prior to tax- I was deciding between this and turkey. The employee told me he would go with the chicken because the turkey here is on the dry side. I thought my chicken was good, but average for the most part. Another barbecue place that I had gone to a few days earlier had a much better seasoned chicken. I thought the potato salad was kind of interesting. It was mashed more so than actual pieces of potato and had some unique seasoning that reminded me of turmeric and cumin. The cole slaw was rather heavy handed in vinegar, making it rather sour. I didn't like the beans that much. The food that was brought to us was lukewarm to cold (well aside from the cole slaw). This was definitely a pretty disappointing meal.\\n\\nFamily Style, $24.95 prior to tax- This is the all you can eat option. My husband opted for this meal. Because service seemed rather slow, my husband asked our server if he could bring him another order of brisket and pork ribs as soon as he brought over his food.The employee said he needs that small plate (that was holding the ribs, brisket and sausage) to plate another order on. My husband immediately just plopped the food onto another plate and gave it back to him. Anyways, my husband thought although the brisket and ribs were tender, they were rather bland. I had a small bite of the sausage and didn't care for the seasoning and found it to be dry. And just like my plate, his food was lukewarm. Same with the beans and potato salad. \\n-----------------------\\n(Total= $42.11 after tax, prior to tip)\\n\\nService truly was lacking during our dining experience. Our server was pretty bad during our meal. We ended up waiting over 20 minutes for our food to be brought out to us after we had ordered. We had seen other tables getting served, even though they had their orders taken after us. Our server only came to check back on us twice during the initial time. He had asked if we wanted more bread, in which we said yes, he never came back to bring it to us. \\n\\nI really wanted a to go container to take my chicken home and because our server never came back, I just went to the front to get it myself. \\n\\nWe ended up getting another server to find our server so we could have our check. \\n\\nBecause we were just tired of waiting during the entirety of this lousy meal, we paid cash (something we rarely do by the way) so that we did not have to wait. And even though the server did not deserve a tip, we still did. \\n\\nHonestly this place is overhyped and not sure what is so great about this place. If you like cold food and meh meat then Sal Lick BBQ is the place to go for that. And if you would like to be ignored, then by all means, come here. \\n\\nI will not be coming back. And yes I did request to speak to a manager about our dining experience (again something that I rarely do, even when I am very disappointed over a dining experience) and sure enough, no one showed (big surprise there). I really expected better and maybe that was my fault for having high expectations.\\n\\nThis place whole heartedly deserves my 1 star rating. \\n\\nDon't send me hate messages because you disagree with my review.

We went last night, on a slightly chilly late-spring evening.  The upstairs was packed with Harvard Business School students having a celebratory end-of-semester drink.   They were in small groups talking loudly, happily. The doors were open, the room was dimly lit showcasing the deep red walls, the music was good (Curtis Mayfield, James Brown).  For a minute, I forgot I was on Mt. Auburn Street in Harvard Square.  The atmosphere is that good.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is good enough that you almost forget about the food, which is startlingly mediocre.  I had the special salad- spinach, roasted corn, roma tomatoes, shrimp, goat cheese, and a citrus dressing.  The special salad was 90% spinach, three small pieces of tomato, a few pieces of corn, and an uninspired dressing.  For $14.95, it felt like a big rip off.  My boyfriend ordered the blackened halibut which was served with a fruity salsa and some rice.  It lacked the most basic ingredient - salt - and the entire meal was very, very dry.  The fish was over-cooked, the salsa lacked the wetness that salsa is supposed to have (it was just some chopped-up, not-yet-ripe fruit) and the rice was less-than-exciting.  \\n\\nMy advice: go for a drink."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"45 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Yes I did read most of the previous reviews, so I was fully prepared to \\"wait\\" for my reservation.\\n\\nActually showed up before without a reservation because my friend forgot to make one.

We were seated right away and eventually the server came by asking what we'd like to eat. Seeing that the meat plates were $13-16 for 1 type of meat and sides, we decided to go for the family style meal that's priced at $24.95 per person. The family style meal is all you can eat and comes with all the 3 main meats (brisket, sausage, pork ribs), 3 sides (potato salad, coleslaw, and beans), and optional bread, pickles, and onions.\\n\\nMan, was that a large meal. We barely finished the first plate of meat and had a nice chunk of sides leftover. Unfortunately, Salt Lick doesn't live up to its hype. The sausage was the best meat. The brisket was dry and the pork ribs weren't as tender as I expected them to be. I had to put more pressure than usual to rip the rib meat off the bone. I'm used to \\"fall off the bone\\" ribs so I wasn't sure if this was Salt Lick's rib smoking style or not. I did order a 2nd small plate of brisket and ribs to see if the 1st plate was a fluke. The brisket was much better and fattier while the ribs were about the same.\\n\\nI had no idea how we ordered pecan pie after the meal. The pecan pie was nearly all pecan filling with hardly any pecans. As much as it's homemade, I don't think the $6 per slice is justified.\\n\\nAt the end of it, our meal was filling, but not truly satisfying. I heard comparisons on how this place beats out all the other BBQ places like Franklin, Le Barbecue, and more. I just don't see it nor do I see it being the worth the drive. I think Salt Lick is a good local BBQ place if you're around Driftwood, but not worth the detour. Maybe the meat is great and we came on an off day yet I wouldn't think so. A old time place like this would've nailed consistency a long time ago.\\n\\nI will say one thing though. Salt Lick's sweet tea is phenomenal. It's the best sweet tea I've had in my life so far. It has just enough sweetness from the cane sugar to keep you drinking more, searching for the extra sweetness that doesn't exist with the next sip. Incredible balance of sweetness. Bravo.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nQUICK TIPS:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n# Despite the rave reviews from my research, Salt Lick is not a top contender of greatest BBQ meats ever. It's a decent, local BBQ spot at best.\\n\\n# If you decide to drive out here, beware of going on a weekend and during peak lunch and dinnertime. I've heard the line can be absolutely nuts. When I went during a weekday lunch at 2:30 pm, it was a ghost town.\\n\\n# Be careful not to miss the restaurant as you're driving Salt Lick is really easy to pass by on the highway so pay attention to your GPS directions.\\n\\n# Cash only (there is an ATM inside) and BYOB although I was too full to drink my can of Austin Beerwork's bloodwork orange. You really don't need to bring beer, wine, or whatever...get the sweet tea here!\\n\\n# Instead of the family-style meal, order the meat by the pound and order the sides individually. The 3 main meats are the brisket, pork ribs, and sausage. Order the least amount possible then order more as you need more.\\n\\n# You MUST get the sweet tea. It's absolutely phenomenal pure sugar cane goodness.

However, for what it lacks in these areas it more than makes up for in character, panache, and deliciously crafted food that Italian mothers and grandmothers have been feeding families for centuries. \\n\\nWe took some guests that are not from Boston but had gotten several recommendations to the place. We had not yet been here so we were up for whatever they wanted to do. We waited outside for approximately 20 minutes. Outside? In the winter? THIS IS MADNESS! Well, when the place is so crammed that there is no space inside to wait you either leave or get in line. We opted for the latter and sent the wives to the wine bar next door to stay warm (figuratively and literally). \\n\\nOnce we were seated, we were given some menus that are essentially a \\"build your own pasta\\" as well as a chalkboard of specials and favorites. The table opted for a Caesar Salad and the fresh Burrata as starters. Both were excellent and tasted fresh with the typical signs of being made in-house. \\n\\nFor our dinners, we all opted for pasta dishes that featured extremely fresh seafood and sauces. Two of the dishes had in-house made pasta while two had high quality (but bought) pasta (linguine and penne). The difference here is monumental between the bite and quality of the pasta. It didn't \\"ruin\\" any of the dishes but each two would have been elevated with the addition of the house-made pasta. I would recommend replacing any of the pastas with the in-house made pasta without hesitation. The lobster and shrimp in diavolo sauce was perfect. It was salty, spicy, and had that briny flavor that comes with the seafood stock that is used to create the dish. The frutti di mare with the Giacomo sauce was fantastic as well, as the seafood was perfectly cooked and there was no fishiness to be had anywhere in the dish. \\n\\nThe service was relatively quick without feeling rushed and they have plenty of reasonable wine and drink choices to make any semblance of a wait that much more enjoyable if you didn't want to put in an appetizer to pass the time. \\n\\nIt wasn't surprisingly expensive either for the quality of food you get... especially in the North End of Boston. This was probably the cheapest bill we have had despite having two pasta dishes, an appetizer, and a bottle of wine for each of the couples. So, YAY for value here!\\n\\nThis place will not necessarily be for everyone because of the nature of the size and style of operation, but it feels like what ever great Italian home kitchen feels like on a Sunday family dinner. If you can't appreciate that kind of atmosphere and the excellent food that is being pumped out consistently, then I'm sure someone else will gladly take your place in the line outside ;)"},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Rocco's is the best, and they have a great happy hour.

It is what the Japanese chain, CoCo Ichibanya was built on. Sadly, there are no CoCo Ichibanya outlets in the Pacific Northwest. Though Kal√© (no relation to the vegetable) does try admirably to bridge the gap.\\n\\nKal√© is located in downtown Portland, a short distance away from Nordstrom. It is practically next to the westbound Galleria MAX station. At first upon entering the restaurant, I thought I was in the wrong place. The entrance does have a very peaceful zen look to it.\\n\\nThe restaurant inside is very spacious. It was previously a Japanese restaurant and remains so. Though my thoughts on what a curry house looks like don't quite match to the interior. I think a curry house being a hole in the wall type place. But this looked like the kind of restaurant that would serve sushi and teishoku meals. What I am saying is the dining experience here seems meant for something bigger than the simple menu offered here.\\n\\nAnd it is really a simple menu. The main items here are curry and doria which come with (chicken or beef) or without meat. Starting meal prices range from under $7-9. If you add toppings like spinach or a hard boiled egg, add a dollar or two more each depending on the item. Kale (the vegetable) is not a topping however. Though it is not associated with Japanese curry, I think it could work and would tie into the name of the restaurant.\\n\\nI decided to try the most classic dish, the beef curry with rice ($6.95). The curry is quite enjoyable. It hits the right notes of what I consider to be a Japanese curry. The beef is a bit an afterthought however. It was in the dish, but the curry was what made it work.\\n\\nThe pricing is about right for what you get. This place would rate as three stars on food alone since the menu is not as extensive as CoCo Ichibanya. But given the lack of Japanese curry places in the PNW plus the nice service and ambiance found here, I have to add an extra star.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a Japanese curry fix in Portland, Kal√© is the spot to go in town."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Despite the 1 hour wait on a Sunday afternoon for our party of 10, the wait was definitely worth it.

The batter was crunchy, rich but not overly heavy, a tad on the greasy side. The squid itself was super fresh, light, gentle-chewy (i know it's not a word) and spot. ON. Breaded and fried red peppers/jalapenos = perfection. Only complaint was that there wasn't enough marinara dipping sauce that came with. \\n\\n- Frutti di mare w/ fra diavolo sauce -- ($19) Absolutely delicious. Bright flavors and fresh seafood! Al dente linguini in a slightly spicy, well seasoned tomato sauce. The seafood in it was wonderfully fresh, though I didn't care for the mussels. The squid was the highlight but shrimp were a tad overcooked and I definitely would not have minded a bit more seafood. I couldn't finish it and had to take 1/2 home. \\n\\nOverall, I would love to come back to try different dishes.

We sat down and the waitress came to us within minutes. After she brought us our waters, she disappeared for 35 min. We got our hostess attention to see if someone else can assist us, once she realized our waitress never returned, she decided to take our order. Again, took her 10 min to return, both my boyfriend and I were both frustrated with our wait. The hostess never returned and the same waitress we started off ended up returning and taking our menu. I confronted her why it took so long, she did not have an excuse and did not apologize. To add to our frustration she got our order and drinks wrong. What we thought would be a simple and fast dinner ended up taking over 2 and a half hours. We definitely will not be turning to this restaurant, the service was not great.

I recommended he put little asterix next to each dish that could be made vegan.\\n\\nI got the poblano pepper dish.  I have to be honest, it was extremely spicy.

I only ate 1/2 and then my stomach hated me.  I got the 2nd half to go and gave it to my boyfriend. He ate it for lunch the next time and put some cheese on it that helped.

They were served properly cold, with as many types of sauce as possible (cocktail, mignonette, mustard, and a milder tomato). The bivalves were plump, tender, briny and d-lish! The shrimp were cooked well; not limp and not rubbery. When I asked, they brought (wait for it) ... house-made saltines. Who MAKES saltines?\\n\\nThe New England Clam Chowder was best in breed. Rich, creamy, full of tender clams, potatoes and bacon. I'd bathe in it if I could.\\n\\nThe warm buttered lobster roll was the priciest I've ever had; $34.

I've been coming to Ichiro for at least one full year for lunch and dinner occasions, wanting to sample various items on their menu in order to provide the most comprehensive review that I can. I've brought family and friends on a few occasions, but have mainly eaten here as a solo diner. If you're having a craving for good Japanese food, prepared by Japanese people, with authentic Japanese ingredients and cooking methods, Ichiro should definitely be on your list of places to go!\\n\\nThere are a few reasons why I am giving Ichiro a five-star. One of those reasons is the friendliness of the staff. As you step through the welcoming main entrance, you will undoubtedly be greeted by at least one of the many friendly waitresses and staff members that work there. As well, the chefs at the sushi bar will never fail to send a smile your way as you pass by the main area en route to your table. On every one of my visits, the waitresses always seem friendly and happy, checking in with customers during their visit to ensure that everything is going well. The staff are very caring.\\n\\nAnother thing that makes Ichiro stand out, in my opinion, is the quality of ingredients. In the past, among other things, I've had the Super Ichiro Don, which is about $30.00, but gets you a pretty solid bowl of quality food (unagi, chicken karaage, grilled beef, and shrimp tempura on top of rice); and the tenzaru soba, which is fairly standard, but decently tasting in terms of presentation and taste compared to other restaurants. One of the absolute favorite selections at Ichiro is during lunch time when you have the option to pick a lunch set of two small rice bowls of your choice for about $20.00, but I always get the ikura don, which comes with a generous portion of ikura on top of rice, and a mini Super Ichiro Don. You really get your money's worth if you're into that stuff like I am! I really recommend coming here for lunch. The plating and portion sizes are always spot on. By the way, to add, Ichiro is one of the only restaurants in Richmond that offers a decent bowl of ikura on top of rice and, to me, that's a sign of quality.\\n\\nLet's not forget about the sushi now 'cause that's my area of \\"specialty\\" so to speak haha. I've had a good amount of experience with the menu at Ichiro over the past year, so much so that I can confidently say that the sushi here is among the best you'll find in Richmond. I've ordered the time-tested simple rolls, the Westernized rolls with weird sauce combinations and ingredients on them, and also the traditional nigiri sushi plates. Among my favourite things at Ichiro that are sushi related, there are two: the unagi nigiri sushi, which will absolutely MELT in your mouth the moment it touches your tongue, and the ikura nigiri sushi, which, with every bite, will send your taste buds to cloud nine as you feel the juices from each of the fish eggs explode with depths of flavour. Truly, I can't recommend ordering these pieces enough, and I always make sure to order them myself whenever I visit Ichiro.\\n\\nWhile Ichiro has definitely earned it's place among Richmond's best, I would be lying if I said every one of my visits were perfect. On one occasion about a year ago when I visited with my mother, brothers, and my uncle, after we were seated we waited about 15 or 20 minutes for the waitress to come back and serve us tea and take our meal orders. I remember on that night that it was a fairly busy service with only two waitresses running the whole front of the house. That being said, it was a small thing to pick on, and it happened so long ago that I'm not weighing that part of my visit too heavily on this review. The rest of that particular visit ran smoothly and without incident. Another thing that people might pick on is the price point of their menu. At Ichiro, prices will be slightly higher than at other Japanese places, especially when it comes to their sushi. But honestly, if you don't mind paying a little bit extra, it's not that big of a deal. For me, if I know I'm going to get even just that little extra quality and I know 100% that I'm getting what I pay for, I'm gonna do it, no problem. \\n\\nHonestly, almost everything that comes out of the kitchen here is going to be great. Whether you want a small snack or are coming in for a feast with a large party or you're bringing kids in for a simple family meal, Ichiro Japanese Restaurant will accommodate all of your requests with passion and respect. Check them out if you're ever in the Steveston area!"},{"name":"Pizza Hut","address":"4421 Hugh Howell Rd","city":"Tucker","stars":"2","text":"Really wish we had read the reviews before ordering.\\nIf I could give zero or negative stars I totally would.\\nHere visiting with two kids that were very hungry at 915pm two hours after ordering still no pizza.

White, slender guy with hair that kind of flips up ini the back is the best way I could explain him. His attitude sucks. That simply is the only way I could explain it. My wife and I ordered a couple of steaks. She had the Tbone and I had the filet. They quality of the steaks is atrocious! Think Golden Coral but slightly better quality. And I mean slightly. My steak was overcooked and was like leather my wifes was supposed to be medium and still had ice in the middle which answers my question on if these were just in a freezer and not fresh. \\n\\nWhen we talked to the floor guy he was very standoffish and had a really s.... attitude towards the situation. He advised me that this is not a 5 star steak house. I could not believe that he was talking to my wife and I like this. I get that it's not a 5 star steak house but told sell me on \\"these are the best steaks in town\\" and then give me those steaks only to tell me that I should expect a lower quality of product. He didn't even offer to have someone remake them nor would I want him around my food after that exchange. Seems to be a very upset, not mentally stable individual. \\nWe didn't complete our meal, I paid and we departed. Ill never bring my staff in their for meetings or come there with my wife again while someone like that works there. A shame as it was nice to come there and deal with professionals that took pride in their club. \\n\\nLastly, if you're drinking beer, don't go here. While offering 3rd rate service they are charging you Miami prices for beer. I would have to look at the receipt as it's been a bit but I believe it was 6.00/6.50 a beer? For what? Bud Light... What do you get for that price?\\n\\nA. When you go into what is supposed to be a nice place to eat you get some wanna be ma√Ætre d with an attitude problem who has no service skills and shouldn't even be there as a barback more less dealing with the public. \\n\\nB. Low quality food. Since Chef Rick left the food quality has gone to the point of whatever the bottom grade Sysco has to offer from their frozen food section. On top of that, a chef that doesn't know how to cook the food correctly and again this \\"G\\" guy that refuses to offer service.\\n\\nC. Miami level prices for beer and drinks and 3rd rate service to go with it. \\n\\nD. Lack of varierty of girls. When you go to Rachels in Miami or even the one by the airport they still have women that look classy. Although they are entertainers you can tell they of a different caliber. And they are not all tattooed up with muffin tops and stretch marks. They just aren't held to the same standard as their other clubs. If you enjoy going to the hood, this is more that type of club. \\n\\nMaybe the owner will clean it up, maybe he/she doesn't care. From the looks of it, it's the latter. Excessive beer prices, poor food quality, and staff that has no professionalism, looks like a winner to me!"},{"name":"Tiki Rock","address":"2 Broad St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Found this new place the other nice and was not disappointed!

I was hoping to sample their offerings because, having lived in Naples, Italy for three years and being married to an Italian (my wife's family still lives in Naples and we visit quite often), I love authentic pizza Napoletana and was curious to see just how authentic theirs was.\\n \\nWhen we arrived, the oven was going strong and the two employees were still there prepping for dinner with the door and window open. We stood there for a minute while the woman looked at us without saying a word, so I finally asked her \\"Are you closed?\\" to which she responded only with a \\"Yes\\". I was a bit shocked because there was absolutely no reason to turn us away and they did not even bother to tell us why they would not serve us at 2:02 PM. \\n\\nIf this was a sit-down restaurant, I could understand why we would not be served. However, having eaten many pizzas in Naples and attended a \\"pizzaiolo\\" (pizza maker) course there this past February, I know that a Neapolitan pizza takes less than 90 seconds to prepare and about 60-90 seconds to bake at 485 degrees Fahrenheit. I understand that they were \\"officially\\" closed and may have had things to do, but taking 3 minutes to make a pizza for a customer was, I believe, not too much to expect.\\n\\nThe restaurant business and customer service are all about making customers happy and turning us away so rudely was, in my opinion, uncalled for. Having spent a great deal of time in the business and owned a very successful mobile food operation myself, I would have never turned a customer away in similar circumstances, but that is just me. \\n\\nAfter leaving a tip on Yelp regarding my experience, someone (whom I am assuming was the owner or manager) sent me a compliment with a \\"You're Funny\\" tag stating: \\n\\n\\"I'm not going to serve pizza anyone even 1minutes late. Please come during business sir. Thank you\\"\\n \\nWith literally millions of readers annually across several platforms, including Yelp and my popular blog, my responsibility to readers is to provide an accurate, honest \\"opinion\\" based on my experiences, so I did not appreciate being laughed at (\\"You're Funny\\") because I take my responsibilities and commitment to my readers very seriously. A more professional and customer-oriented response would have been much more appropriate in my opinion. For example: \\"I am very sorry that we had to turn you away, but our employees were busy prepping for dinner and could not take the time to serve you. Please accept our sincere apology and come back to visit us very soon!\\" would have been a much more appropriate response and they would have likely gained a return customer. Unfortunately, based on our negative experience and the business's insulting responses to my tip, I will not be returning any time soon. Not an unreasonable person, if an apology is forthcoming, I may consider giving them another chance and revising my review/rating.\\n\\nCombatCritic Gives Pizzeria La Sorrentina 1 Bomb Out Of 10 And A Spot On My \\"WALL OF SHAME\\" ...

A couple of our appetizers and desserts were never ordered, he claimed we never ordered it and was doing us a favor by getting it for us.  Other waiters and waitresses would come and announce their plate.... when there's 25 ppl, it's hard for us to figure out whose plate is whose.  Shouldn't the waiter know when they take the orders and keep track?  My cousin ordered a chicken thigh and was given a breast and the waiter refused to return it and make it right, he stated she already touched it! So we kept it and ordered another dish.

In addition to the initial phone call made to inquire that they could accommodate a group of our size; I went in person to place everyones individual orders in an effort to ensure a seamless execution. There's a very strict time schedule that must be  adhered to. So, as you can imagine the horror I felt, when the young gentleman about to take my order tells me lunch is ONLY buffet! It was confusing to say the least, as he was literally with pen and pad in hand. Did my clip board and lengthy order scare him into saying that on a whim? Nowhere on the website, nor was it communicated when the initial phone call was made, that lunch was ONLY their teeny-tiny buffet!!  After pleading with the young man, he finally came back with good news. The chef made an acceptation and they agreed to take the orders. \\n\\nEveryone arrived at precisely the time I'd advised the Chutney's staff. The food did start coming out as requested, but not as fast as one would expect with a restaurant that was NOT full. Unfortunately, some guests had to take action and just go to the buffet station and serve themselves their rice, as none of the Murgh Tikka Masala bowls came out with their starchy best friend. In our servers defense, it seemed like he was a one man show. He answered the phone, took my order when I arrived in person, than served our whole table by himself. There was also a lovely young lady who seemed to be the only other server in the restaurant. She was had a warm and inviting presence, and was kind enough to apologize for all of the \\"No's\\" she heard me continually receive for the most basic of requests.  \\n\\nNow on to what you've come to my review for. THE FOOD!\\n\\nUnfortunately, I'd love to say that though the execution was rocky the food was a different tale to tell. However, it was not.  My chicken was overcooked and for the $14 price tag there was definitely a lack of the featured protein. The rice was also not the fluffy, cloud-like texture one expects when putting a spoonful of this heavenly carb into your mouth. It was disappointing to say the least. Rice is a pretty basic ingredient that should've been executed perfectly, (in my opinion,) especially at an Indian restaurant. \\n\\nWhen it was all said and done, it almost felt like our contribution to their lunch revenue was a bother. Which is just not a good feeling. Definitely doesn't live up to the company vision statement thats proudly displayed on the website. \\nThis may just be a restaurant that thrives on single tables as they are clearly understaffed and larger groups may be a bit overwhelming."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Had brunch here based off of stellar Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint.

Then he charged me the extra $1.09 for guac when it was supposed to be on the burrito in the first place. The burrito didn't taste good, plain ingredients and very plain chips with no salt, or cheese, or pico de gallo. I didn't like the owners attitude how he was watching over things and not helping, and he put a piece of paper down in front of the girl right where she was making my burrito and she immediately moved it out of the way.

It was great.  It was a meat assault.  It felt almost like Godzilla, where I was Tokyo and the meat was every kaiju there ever was.  And I was defeated, damnit, which in this analogy means I left meat on my plate.\\n\\nI ordered a plate of brisket (half fatty, half burnt ends), which comes with a bit of beans, cold potato salad, and slaw.  It looks like a normal-sized plate, and the serving of meat doesn't even look that huge, but it's all an illusion, some kind of BBQ'ed mirage.  You eat meat, and there's still meat left on the plate.  You eat some more, and it's like you haven't touched any meat.  It just keeps going and going until you stop or die or turn into a cow yourself.  \\n\\nBut the plate wasn't my downfall--the ribs were.  I'd never had BBQ before (I know, shut up) so I wanted to try a few things.  The beef ribs--I thought they'd be small but they're the size of, let's say, a child's forearm.  Meat on both sides of the rib.  Two ribs to a plate.  Luckily I was splitting this, so I had only one rib to myself.  It was DELICIOUS.  But it did me in, I couldn't finish it.  \\n\\nThey have desserts--cobblers and pies--but you'll have to tell me how they are.  The very thought of eating any more made me laugh.\\n\\nEnough useless information.  Some tips:\\n\\n1) It's a tough call, but the beef ribs were superior to the beef brisket.  If you can, I'd try both, but if you had to pick one and had never had anything like this before, I'd say the ribs are the better experience.\\n\\n2) The brisket comes in three styles: dry, fatty, and burnt-ends.  I got a half-half split of the latter two and would probably recommend that.  A full plate of the burnt-ends would be a workout to chew through.\\n\\n3) BYOB.  There is an adjacent shop for alcohol, if you forgot.\\n\\n4) Read the history of the place--it's short and on the menu.

I should have just turned left onto a very dark little road which was not to inviting. it turned out this was the only entrance to the parking lot which you enter behind the restaurant which I found a bit peculiar.  Once in the parking lot there was more than ample spots available and had nice landscaping with multiple walkways to the front door. \\n\\n     Upon entering, I walked into the bar area which was extremely pleasing. The bar area had an amazing amount of appeal which derived mainly from its attractive decor. One wall was a see thru structure into the dining room with wine racks etc. behind the bar which stretched the entire length of the restaurant was a bookshelf styled shelving unit that housed the top shelf liquor. A nice touch to the styling of the bar area was the three types of seating. First you had seats at the bar, next in the middle a row of high tops from front to rear and lastly some 1/2 booths. \\n\\n     At this point, I should mention that this trip to Bonefish Grill, I was attending a special event put on by Yelp to taste a new winter menu.  \\n\\n     When I took a seat at I was brought a Winter Martini. It was the BOMB!!! Made with Vodka, white cranberry  juice and syrup with 3 fresh cranberries floating on top.  I would definitely give this drink 5 stars!\\n\\n     The first course was a platter with their signature Bang Bang Shrimp and Bang Bang Chicken.  I found the flavor to be sweet and only a tad of a bang if that? They were also a little on the soggy side. I give them both a solid 3 stars. \\n\\n     Next came a stuffed shrimp, this was a great little dish. The taste was creamy but firm all at the same time. They were medium sized shrimp cooked perfectly. The presentation was fabulous as they arrived in a sizzling cast iron pan. Bravo!!\\n\\n     At this time I was thinking yes! a great night of food.. And then the salad arrived, it looked great but lacked flavor. It was very bland and unappetizing. \\n\\n     We were then served a superb looking dish, This was a layered production starting with mashed potatoes that had great texture and taste,  a couple cloves of garlic unfortunately only partially cooked with a generous portion of pork on the top layer which had a funny after taste, not so appetizing :(  and on top of this was a mushroom gravy which was way to salty for my taste buds. I'd give this a 2 star rating only for the presentation. \\n\\n     I was very surprised to see the next course , it had a sampling of four types of fish, Mahi Mahi, 2 types of Salmon and one other. Once again the presentation was tops!! But unfortunately lacking flavor for the pricing I saw on the menu. \\n\\n     At this point I was excited to try the desert which was being bragged about?? It was a chocolate brownie with a chocolate frosting on a strawberry sauce which my plate lacked, accompanied by ice cream (mine was melted leaving a puddle on my plate) and topped with a bit of whipped cream. They missed on presentation and the taste was definitely not there. Sorry but only 1 star :( \\n\\n    As I thought we were ending on a bad note, I was totally surprised with a second round of deserts coming out.  Thankfully this dish was fun as well as tasty. The waiter called them donuts, but I would list them as fried dough. They were fried to perfection and the dough was hot and soft in the middle and just the right amount of crunch on the outside. Now comes the fun part. The dish had 4 fried dough pieces along with a dollop of whipped cream and a small bottle something you would see at a child's art booth at a fair which was filled with caramel which you used to inject the warm caramel into the dough. Awesome!!! Someone finally figured out that adults with a drink or two in them would love to have a fun tasty desert... Kudos on this dish!! A solid 5 star desert.\\n \\n     The waitress and waiters were all friendly and very knowledgeable when it came to the menu items and drink ingredients. Excellent service was received by all.\\n  \\n     I would like to point out that the floor was a tad on the slippery side as if someone spilled something with oil and tried to mop it up without enough cleanser, so be careful on the way to the rest rooms which by the way were very clean and had sufficient supplies.\\n\\n     I really really enjoyed the atmosphere so because of this I will definitely return with hopes of improving my rating. I would have issued 3 1/2 stars but since I have to choose between 3 and 4 stars, unfortunately I have to go with 3."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"The first time I came here, it was hard to find parking and there was a long wait.

Unfortunately for us, the 3 families around us could've competed for \\"worlds worst behaved children.\\" There should've never been 4 tables crammed back there, especially with larger families and 3 strollers each.

We pulled up at 11 and they were closed they don't open until 12. So we hung around and came back when they opened. When you first walk in it's not very appealing they need to work on the decode a little better make it more cozy feeling. Feels like walking into a fast food restaurant hard booth seats so we ere greeted when we came in by a young lady very polite. She handed us menus said sit where you want and come to the register when ready to order. I personally prefer to have someone wait on me at a restaurant or I would have  gone to a fast food place. Plus it's a money maker for the young girl for tips if I have to order my own food I'm not tipping for someone to just bring me my food I know it's my choice.  \\n\\nThe shrimp taco though are omg good just enough shrimp and cooked perfect. I put some of the sweet chili sauce on mine took them up a couple of clicks. The coleslaw wasn't very good and the okra was ok. We would return for the th tacos for sure. \\n\\nWe did talk to the manager/owner about not having a server he did mention that he is set up so that servers can come to the tables. I think he would do a lot better with table service,  people are on vacation we don't want to wait on ourselves like myself when I go out to eat and on vacation I want someone to give excellent service and they will be rewarded well at the end. \\n\\nI gave a 4 star really 3 1/2 is what I wanted to give.

Take initiative if you're starting to get hangry!\\n\\nWe ordered a number of different items between the three of us. I ordered the typical avocado roll, kappa maki, agedashi tofu and veggie sunomono that can be found at almost every restaurant. Added a crispy roll in for something different; it was basically a green bean tempura roll. \\n\\nResponse time-wise, they brought out the food really quickly! It looked like they had tons of chefs available for their dinner rush, and based on what my friend told me, the wait usually isn't too long. \\n\\nTaste-wise, I've had better sunomono; the noodles tasted as though they had been recently taken out of the fridge or freezer. The tofu was softer than expected for an agedashi tofu, and although I had been informed that the rice for the sushi usually has a lot of vinegar, it wasn't crazy spectacular so I was a bit let down. Take heed: this is the experience of a vegetarian who eats way too much sushi. Rice makes a huge difference for me.\\n\\nNevertheless, for a poor graduate student who hadn't eaten in hours, the meal was still awesome and this place had really well priced sushi for dinner.

When we did sit down they handed us menus and the pleasant wait staff approached. We were then given an alternate menu with a Happy Anniversary label. A nice touch. It went down hill from there. I would like to chalk it up to opening week jitters , but with a highly respected chef, it should go off without a hitch.\\n\\nThe menu sounded creative and interesting. We started off with a \\" snack \\" as they call it of Pork Croquetas with Mojo, South Florida Mango and sour orange. They were tasteless, mealy and uninspiring. Next came the corn bread with natural honey butter. It arrived cold and was told that's the way it is served. We asked for it to be warmed. Shouldn't have bothered. It was dry, crumbly and not what was expected. Sent that one back.  I did order a ceasar salad and it was good. Not great but passable. Enough said about that.  We were intrigued by the 1921 burger. We didn't really want to order a burger at such a highly touted restaurant, but it sounded great. Sorry folks, it was not the burger I wanted. It was a combination of 3 meats. Brisket, chuck and short rib. It was topped with a house bacon and , what they call a \\" cave aged cheddar.  The cheese I'm still looking for, the bacon was smoked to death and the burger , although cooked to our liking was an odd flavor and overpowered by steak sauce and crispy shallots. We are dessert junkies, at least I am and was looking forward to some modern, yet home-style tastes.  The graham beignets arrived warm and displayed nicely. They came with 2 dips, a key lime pie filling and a guava custard.  We enjoyed them but we were already ready to leave by then.\\n\\nMaybe, just maybe, we expected too much from this new restaurant.  For us, it started out not so well and went down from there. We were dressed for the occasion, not like most of the other diners . I asked for a black napkin instead of the usual white and was told they did not have them. We have been to many restaurants in our days and the good ones always have black napkins for people wearing dark clothing.  \\n\\nWe work and live in Mount Dora and were really excited to add this place to our favorites.

I've never eaten hibachi here and not interested to, but their sushi and traditional dishes are often superb.  I've had all sorts of sushi here and recommend getting the premium omakase, which is about $40 and features toppings that are prepared very well and are actually high quality, such as good toro with chef's sauce brushed onto it, sea eel (a specialty of the main chef here) that's clearly more refined than most places', juicy and balanced shiny fish (like kohada, aji, or saba) properly paired with garnishments, or perhaps even surprises like a creamy and pungently seasoned fire squid.  Good technique and tasty sushi rice.  The ikura is not as good as Hayakawa's (I feel harsh just for using this comparison), but tamago is quite fine.  Again I recommend the premium omakase.  I've ordered the chirashi before as well and was not nearly as impressed.  Also, I've been here twice where my party has arranged in advance to eat the multi-course kaiseki meal, and it seemed to me you can't expect too much in terms of sushi in that format, unless you are going for the $120 dinner.  \\n\\nAnyway that brings the attention to the kaiseki offering itself.  Nakato being a formal traditional Japanese restaurant actually quite impressively offers, not just one but three different price tiers of, kaiseki dinners.  That's basically multi-course fine dining with emphasis on seasonal ingredients, variety of techniques, and thoughtful presentation.  Having had this twice already (not a repeat dish in the two meals!) my assessment is that it is very good experience for the money (especially if it's your first kaiseki), and a nice way to celebrate an occasion with a party.  But some dishes fell a bit short, IMO not because of execution but   because it just had to be that way to keep the price manageable.  With that lesson in mind I would probably choose the more expensive price tiers knowing I can trust the chef's skills.\\n\\nNot gonna go into details but the broth dishes, grilled dishes, and fried dishes are all generally very good.  I've observed inconsistencies but overall the food is much better than average.  Also, the sake menu is respectable in size with more than a dozen good offerings, many at reasonable prices.  I don't care much for the \\"garden\\" that you can see out of the dining room, but like the festive birthday thing that they do (you gotta see it).

The atmosphere is awesome, it can get kinda loud but I don't mind. During dinners and especially weekends, it gets packed and I've seen wait times of over an hour. The hostess will take your name and number and tell you to take a stroll down the water front or rather opt to grab a drink at the bar. When the time comes they will text you when the table is ready. \\n\\nLets move onto the food. For appetizers we ordered Tuna Tartare, steamed mussels in red curry sauce and fried calamari. Tuna tasted well seasoned and fresh. Would go really well with the bread that they give you, going to have to give it a try next time around and see if i'm right. The mussels were really good, a lot of places in the past where i've ordered mussels tend to over salt the sauce and it can ruin it for me. Another great way to use the bread they give you is dipping it into this sauce. Calamari was small in portion size and wasn't anything to go crazy about. \\n\\nMy main entree, I opted for the creamy lobster roll which I rarely ever get as im a hot buttered lobster kinda guy. First impression was how much lobster was inside the sandwich. The first bite, I noticed right away that they incorporated chopped celery into the mayo mix. I dislike celery so that kinda bummed me out a little bit, but not enough to not eat it. The mayo was a little on the heavy side but not to the point of not tasting the lobster. Learned my lesson tonight that I should just stick to buttered lobster rolls and thats what ill do on my next trip back.\\n\\nMy reasoning for not a 5 star is that our waiter at times was nowhere to be found. We kinda grew impatient at times, as we waited a while after the appetizers came out just to put our dinner order in.

That's not to say those adjectives aren't apt; they are.  It's just that the food, service, and atmosphere of this restaurant deserve so much more than zeitgeist nonsense descriptors.  \\n\\nLet us try this:  If being hungry was like wandering around alone in the cold, Kal√© is like a warm, comfortable, embrace when one needs it most; the food is hearty, lovingly crafted, and rich.  Kal√© opened in 2011 and has been a hot spot for comfort food since then.  One orders at cafeteria-style counter with tray--the options are built around various \\"Kal√© rice\\" dishes modified by numerous toppings.  Your order is called when it is ready and you bring it back to your table. We ordered the Kal√© rice curry (beef) with added chicken cutlet (13.95$ including the cutlet) and chicken cutlet with doria rice (15.95$ with cutlet added on).  The dishes come with white rice and fukujinzuke (sweet red pickles made with daikon radish).  The doria concoction was interesting; it's basically their curry with cheese and paprika baked onto the rice and sauce.   Just remember to be hungry when if you order the doria with cutlet.  The flavor profile of the curry was subdued but rich at the same time. I could taste the mild slow-cooked goodness of the onions, tomatoes, carrots, and other veggies.   Oh yes it was great.\\n \\nAdding to the food was the large and peaceful atmosphere.  It's very laid back in the way you order, seat yourself, bus your own tables, and help yourself to the complementary teas.  I really want to use \\"zen\\" in my descriptions of this place but let's continue to avoid clich√©s ok?  What made this dining experience even better was the service.  The gentleman (Makoto I believe) behind the counter was warm and full of details about Japanese Food; his pride was obvious and appreciated. The dining area has the feel of being in someone's house rather than a restaurant (in a good way).  One can choose traditional tables or corner tables featuring tatami mats.

Occasionally, old Embryo Face gets a mad craving for dumplings.  Luckily, he happened to be at Boston University East last week and was able to mingle with the children without giving off that Sandusky vibe.\\n\\nSome people aren't so lucky.  A family friend of ours went horseshoe bald at 20 and started getting grays at 21.  He had a mustache that was only a little wider than Hitler's.  Above the mustache was a toucan's beak.  Above the nose were coke-bottle glasses.  And above the glasses were two fuzzy plantains.  It was the totem pole of 50-year old virgins.\\n\\nIncredibly, he had a wife and three kids.  His wife had a mustache too.  And a big nose and thick eyebrows.  Her glasses were like the InSight Lander's solar panels.  Their sons did too.  The four of them looked like they decided to show up to gatherings with Groucho glasses.  If Groucho and Bogdan from 'Breaking Bad' had kids, it would be that family.\\n\\nExcept for the daughter.   She had luscious mutton chops.  I bet she's marrying runaways in Vegas right now.\\n\\nI chuckled to myself over these memories while waiting for two orders of dumplings: The celery and pork and spicy napa cabbage and pork.  I can't emphasize enough how courteous the attractive older woman who greeted me was.  Even after taking my order and making sure my glass was full, she kept looking over, hoping I would ask for a neck massage or her daughter's hand in marriage.  This doesn't happen often and I appreciated it.\\n\\nThere's twelve dumplings in each order, which was just about enough to satisfy the insane craving.  I liked the pork and celery but the spicy napa and pork were probably some of the best dumplings I have ever had in my life.  \\n\\nFirst of all, they lived up to the bold claim of spicy.  My relationship with Boston's spicy food . . . man oh man.  Boston's \\"heat\\" is my allegedly recovering heroin addict son: Now and then, I'm encouraged by his progress but mostly I have to ignore the painful knowledge that there's a picture of him on Craigslist like Kate Winslet in 'Titanic.'\\n\\nNot so here.\\n\\nThe spicy napa blasted open my tear ducts and they were accompanied by a SWAT team of sichuan peppercorn.  I LOVE sichuan peppercorns.  Using them in just the right amount is a skill and when you nail it, you will get a perfect numbness that makes each taste bud hum like a little generator.  Heat by itself is nice but that little hum from the peppercorn turns the experience 3D.\\n\\nThe freshness of dough and the filling was evident.  I recommend eating really good dumplings like these as soon as possible after they come out of the steamer.  Their half-life is short and the freshness of the flavors threaten to get buried under sogginess.  Think a crisp Belgian autumn day that turns into a humid Vietnamese jungle in July.  Think exfoliated face vs. runner's taint.\\n\\nThe waitress suggested I eat them with both the soy sauce and Chinese black vinegar.  Soy sauce is standard but the vinegar is an acquired taste.  I think it might be the cilantro of the liquid ingredient world.  To some, it will taste like diesel.  If you give it a chance and use it sparingly, you will appreciate the truffle-like woodsy quality to it.  One little dip of the crimped edge of the dumpling in the vinegar is enough.\\n\\nI downed twenty-four dumplings and happily left a 25% tip.  I walked in fully aware of some diners' complaints of brusque service and I want to give them full points for rectifying the problem.  A lot of places simply choose not to give a virgin's fuck.\\n\\nI may try their other dishes at some point, just out of curiosity.  I'm not sure yet.  What I am sure of is that every dumpling on my plate the next time around will be the spicy napa and pork.

When you walk in, you will see a large menu board with all of their regular bao (which is essentially a slider) options, tot options, and a smaller menu with some of their specials. \\n\\nWhen my wife and I stopped in, we looked over the menu and decided to get their 3 for 9 deal. The 3 baos that we ordered were (in order of preference) the kickin chicken bao (one of their best IMO), the coconut shrimp special bao (solid and should become a regular), and a tikka masala bao (fun, but not as good as the others). After placing our order, the cashier handed the order over to the guy making the baos and he got right to work. Despite being second in line, we received our bao in less than 5 minutes! While I'm usually a little skeptical about getting food so quickly, the tasty bao tells me that the speed was just due to their ultra efficient processes. \\n\\nOverall, King Bao is a fun and tasty little Mills spot with great options that get made in a flash.

The new restaurant is on Highway 50 in front of the West Oaks Mall. With the mall and much of the surrounding area experiencing a slow and painful death It seemed an unusual place for a new start. The parking lot was nearly empty when we arrived. The restaurant has been completely renovated and has a large bar area with a connecting outside porch. Although the bar was also empty I thought that it had lots of potential.  \\n\\nThe hostess immediately greeted us and was very upbeat and friendly. Her smile was contagious and welcoming. We were seated in the near empty dining room and waited for a waitress to appear. About 10 minutes went by before our waitress arrived.  She seemed confused by informing us that she was going to get our check. After  we explained that we haven't ordered a meal she volunteered that she wanted to go home but was in fact scheduled to close the restaurant. I'm not sure why we ignored the strong indicator that we were going to regret visiting this establishment but we stayed a little longer. \\n\\nWe ordered a bowl of clam chowder, oysters and clam fritters for appetizers. The clam chowder was tasty and the oysters were good but the fritters were tasteless, greasy, dough balls with a tiny piece or two of chopped clams.

We were hoping to catch another server and ask for assistance in locating our waitress but the opportunity never presented itself.

Methinks not.\\"  That's exactly how I feel about Dim Sum Heaven.  However, since the food did not kill me and it wasn't completely atrocious, I'm giving Dim Sum Heaven 1.5 stars, rounded up to 2.  Like Seth V. touched upon in his review, this is more like Dim Sum Hell.\\n\\nDim Sum Heaven is located in the Pinetree Plaza shopping center on Buford Highway (same shopping center as Bo Bo Garden, Thien Thanh, and Chef Liu).  The front of the restaurant has pictures of many non-dim sum entrees you can order and the menu itself has many more traditional Chinese (Fuzhounese) entree dishes than dim sum selections.  The restaurant's dim sum selection is located at the bottom of the last page of their small foldable paper menu.  There are maybe 25 or so dim sum items.\\n\\nIf you tell the server you are ordering dim sum, they will also provide you with an 8.5 x 11 picture menu of many of the dim sum offerings.  That's helpful.  I tried the following:\\n\\nHouse special Ho Fun soup\\nTurnip cake\\nPork shumai - dumpings\\nTaro pie\\n\\"Glutinous rice\\" shumai - dumplings\\nCha siu baau - steamed BBQ pork buns\\nSpare ribs\\n\\nMost of the items were $2.50 each, including the soup.  The house special Ho Fun soup was decent.  It contained soft white noodles, miniature whole shrimp, and Chinese mushrooms.  Simple to make and it hit the spot.  The turnip (\\"white radish\\" on their menu) cake was good - standard for dim sum places here.  The pork shumai did not seem very fresh and the pieces were slightly bigger than I'm accustomed to.  The taro pie was was like the pie form of the traditional dim sum taro dumplings (the pieces with the fluffy, flaky exterior).  I like the \\"original\\" version better.\\n\\nThe spare ribs came with plenty of black beans, but was too boney.  We didn't even order the \\"gluntinous rice\\" shumai and the cha siu baau.  I told the server I wanted the seafood chive dumplings, but he told me they didn't have those, so we could substitute the seafood with pork.  The result was not a pork chive dumpling, but cha siu baau (steamed BBQ pork buns)!  I like cha siu baau, so I ate it anyway.  It tasted like it'd been frozen and reheated.\\n\\nThe \\"gluntinous rice\\" shumai is the exact same thing as the pork shumai, except with small clumps of white rice on top.  The server also gave us two egg custards, which we sent back because we didn't order them.  I'm also pretty sure one of the employees from the kitchen went to the Oriental Bakery next door and grabbed either two of their egg custards or sesame balls to be reheated and served over here.\\n\\nIn summary, both the food quality and service at this place were not so good.  It's too bad because I want these places to do better and succeed.  The restaurant is split level, has fresh seafood (tilapia, eel, turtles) in aquariums by the window, and a few flat panel TVs for your viewing pleasure.

Little did we know what awaited us.\\n\\n(A) Pros:\\n\\n(1) Hot Bartender - this guy has been here every time I've been here (maybe 5 times total) and he's worth at least a star and a half of the 4 stars I'm giving HG.  Go and check him out.\\n\\n(2) Secret not-on-the-menu chicken wings.  Why wouldn't they put these on the menu? They are delicious.  I put some in my mouth.\\n\\n(3) Doctors.  Now this is a bit of a double edged sword.  If you are in your 20s and single you probably wouldn't mind meeting a doctor.  So the proximity to MGH and the amount of doctors clearly goes under \\"pros\\" - however, please see section (B)(1)(b) for the counterargument.\\n\\n(4) The hot bartender.\\n\\n(B) Cons\\n\\n(1) Vomit\\n\\nAnother Yelp reviewer commented on the fact that she became oddly ill after drinking at HG.  Now don't confuse what I am about to tell you with normal \\"I guzzled 5 glasses of whiskey and threw back 100 gross girly shot and now Im puking all over myself\\" sickness - HG has a weird way of making you sick off of a very small amount of booze.\\n\\n    (a) 3 months ago I came here with friends, had maybe 3 glasses of wine and a cobb salad, almost puked in a cab and then got out of the cab and puked on my lovely winter white peacoat while standing on a street in the North End at 10pm on a Wednesday while people looked at me like I was a crazy wino.  That was fun.\\n\\n   (b) Last night my friend Balison had a few stiff ones - drinks that is (you never know with Balison) - and the next thing I know the hot bartender is very nicely asking me to help my friend.  I turn around and Balison is asleep on a doctor's shoulder.  Mouth hanging open, body heaving up and down with every deep sleepy breath she took.  We wake her up and our other friend - let's call her \\"Melted Cheese\\" or \\"MC\\" for short - realizes she is about to vomit.  As MC helps Balison to the bathroom, Balison begins to throw up - right into her own hand.  She continues the puke festival across the bar, into the bathroom and I think eventually into the toilet.  When she emerges she is covered in puke and says \\"I threw up on my shirt - and down my boobs.\\"  Sure enough, puke was down her boobs.  This isn't ideal when you're trying to meet doctors.  Last I checked, doctors don't call girls that puke into their own hand, and down their boobs.\\n\\nWatch out for the drinks.\\n\\n(2) Fistfights\\n\\nWhile Balison slept and vomited, MC and I were deep in serious conversation.  Unfortunately, this random 40 yr old who we later found out was a regular at the bar did not care.  He was so obnoxious that we wanted to roundhouse kick him, but being the sweethearts we are, we kept politely telling him that we were trying to finish a serious convo and would talk to him when we were done.  That did not deter him.  \\n\\nFinally this dude starts insulting us, and I get heated.  Verbal banter ensues, and I am fabulously defending myself and telling this guy what a dbag he is.  MC alerts the bartender to the guy's d-baggery and the bartender moves this guy away from us.  Yet he returns and this time grabs me.  I react with catlike reflexes and push him away, at which point I extend my pointer finger and instruct him not to touch me.  He responds by biting my finger.  At this point I almost certainly have rabies from this random guy biting my finger, and I respond by socking this guy in the face. \\n\\nSeriously, who does that.  Harvard Gardens makes you crazy.  I don't know what they are putting in those drinks, but I am not the girl who punches anyone in the face, especially some DUDE who probably could have knocked me into tomorrow.  But yeah.  Punched him in the face.\\n\\nThen I asked the doctor that Balison was sleeping on for Neosporin.\\n\\nIn sum:  Come here for hot bartenders, doctors, fistfights, and vomit.\\n\\nDo not come here for a normal, quiet night."},{"name":"Jimmy Vs","address":"912 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I little bit greasy this time but tasted good."},{"name":"Universal Orlando Resort","address":"6000 Universal Studios Plz","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"The Universal Orlando Resort is a great time!

Also, I found posted times for other events and shows to be wrong as well. I was waiting for their nighttime show at 8pm one night as posted in the app and map, as were tons of other people. A worker walked by and someone asked why it hadn't started yet at 8:15pm and he said it wasn't until 9pm that night! Errrr, what. I ended up leaving the park.\\n\\nQuick service food is terrible at most locations within Universal except for the Simpsons area and the Harry Potter area. If you must get a quick bite in the parks, stop in one of those sections for your dining needs. They have meal plans at Universal but for someone like me who can't eat much at one sitting, it's not worth it by any means.\\n\\nWorkers are hit or miss at Universal. Some are miserable and couldn't care less about the guests or their experience. I did find a few employees that were just amazing (like an older gentleman at Leaky Cauldron) making great conversation and just generally being fabulous! Service truly can make or break an experience.\\n\\nHave you ever noticed that at the end of 90% of Universal rides, the workers all clap for you? Though I don't always understand each ride, I'm pretty sure I save the world in each story-line. SUPER SARAH!\\n\\nThe Universal Orlando Resort is ever expanding now adding what is shaping up to be a ground breaking water park! And even more onsite hotels. They are also adding a ton of rides and some new sections to the park which should be fantastic ---- Super Mario Land??? Uh, yes please.

What I get is pretty safe and hard to fuck up.   It's always been decent.  My review has nothing to do with the quality of the food or the cleanliness of the restaurant itself.   I placed my order online and charged it on my debit card.  I get the same thing all the time and it comes out to 11.50 plus 2.00 for delivery charge.  I was looking at my balance online and noticed the charge to Nan Ling was 15.00.  I rechecked to make sure the prices didn't go up and they did not.  The delivery person added a 1.50 for himself as a tip.  After I signed the bill and closed my door, I realized I didn't get the copy of the bill.  When I noticed the charge I called up and was told to call during the day when the manager was there.  I called the next day and she told my I signed the bill and I was mistaking.  After I kept stewing over this, I said to myself, \\"Self, the only way to resolve this is to go there yourself\\".  I walked almost a mile in the snow and ice to confront them in person.  I got there and was shown the bill and there it was in the tip box 1.50 which I did not write.  She said I did.  She went into the register and took out 1.50 and gave it to me.  I told her I did not walk here for 1.50.  It was hard to communicate with her as she spoke very little English.  She insisted her delivery person did not do this and I insisted that he did.  What really pisses me off about the whole situation, is that when I opened the door to see if I could catch the driver, I wanted to write down a 3.00 tip which I had forgotten to do.  The fact that he took it on is own to write down a tip pisses me the fuck off and I want everyone not to give this place any business.

It's currently becoming more and more common to see poke restaurants, and Sweet Tuna is no exception. Sandy Springs, in particular, has plenty of poke restaurants.\\n\\nLocated just outside the perimeter near the Target plaza, parking is plentiful here. While you may not get a spot right up front due to the many other restaurants and shops close by, you shouldn't have to go far for a spot.\\n\\nAs with pretty much many other poke places, there are signature bowls with pre-selected options, as well as create you own bowls as well. Prices are based on bowl size and scoops of protein:\\n\\nSmall with 2 scoops // 8.99\\nMedium with 3 scoops // 10.99\\nLarge with 4 scoops // 12.99\\n\\nIf you're decently hungry, a medium should be more than enough for a lot of people. Several people I went with ended up going with a small and were full. As far as selections go, you get:\\n\\n- 2 bases (rice, veggies, etc.)\\n- Protein (tuna, rib eye, crab & shrimp, etc.)\\n- 4 mix-ins (cucumber, green onion, etc.)\\n- 1 add-on (seaweed salad, crab salad, etc.)\\n- 2 flavors (ponzu, shoyu, etc.)\\n- 3 crunches (furikake, nori flakes, etc.)\\n\\nOne thing to keep in mind is that some poke places will give you unlimited toppings, while some have a set amount and then an another charge for anything extra. Sweet Tuna generally falls in the latter.\\n\\nI personally went with kale and veggie noodles as my base with three scoops of tuna. I mixed in cucumber, edamame, corn, and bell peppers and added on crab salad. I went with spicy ponzu and topped it with garlic chips, onion chips, and nori flakes. The ingredients were really fresh and while I was ordering, many were being replaced so it seems like they don't sit out too long. \\n\\nFor 10.99 + tax and tip, a medium is definitely a great deal in my opinion for a lot of (healthy) food. Service here is really good too - all the staff were friendly and the line moved quickly.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed the food and experience, and will definitely visit again."},{"name":"Treaty Oak Distilling","address":"16604 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Outdoor and indoor areas, live music and great craft drinks.

Hearing about the great atmosphere of bananas, me and my friend thought it'd be a great place to grab lunch. We were sorely mistaken. Long wait for our server.Finally she came and was really trying to sell us on ordering an appetizer so we began our meal telling her we were strick vegetarians. This was met with a \\"You should try the jalapeno corn fritters then, they are really good and also vegetarian!\\"  Those sounded amazing to us so we ordered them right away to give us more time with the menu. We settled on ordering two different types of veggie burgers. After a little while the fritters came out. The applesauce dip was great but I was missing the bite of the jalapeno, in fact I didn't taste or see any at all. However, what I did see, taste, and pick out of the fritter with my finger horrified me. A big square of greasy bacon. Me and my friend immediately spit out what we were chewing. We couldn't believe after specifically letting our server know we were vegetarian, she suggested an appetizer containing bacon. What a nightmare. We could already feel ourselves getting sick. We tried to let her know immediately after but she took awhile to get to the table. During the wait time my friend realized she knew one of the cooks walking around. We expresed our distaste for the fritters and caught up a bit. When we told our server she didn't seem apologetic at all. Rather she was like \\"Oops, I didn't know those had bacon in them.\\" Well I have news for you, as a server you should know the menu. Especially after recomending something to two VEGETARIANS. She insisted on getting us another appetizer instead. We decided on the house goat cheese, It was pretty good, it would have been better had it not came out with our burgers. Both burgers got cold as we ate the goat cheese. No matter, we dug in anyway. I was about a quarter through my burger when I realized how juicy it tasted, how greasy, and how soft and meaty it was. I moved the toppings off of it and surveyed it. It was a grey color and was a soggy consistancy. I turned to my friend and said \\"I don't think these are veggie burgers.\\" Her face got white and she spit the rest of hers out. Trying not to panic she called over her friend(A COOK). \\"What are these?\\" She said quizzacly pointing to our burgers. \\"Oh, those are the turkey burgers, aren't they great?\\" He said cheerfully. We said \\"But we ordered veggie burgers, we are both vegetarian\\" he looked down at the burgers \\"No those are definitely not veggie burgers those are turkey burgers, you can tell by the grey color and juicy consistancy.\\" We said thanks and he left being done with his shift. We were really upset and we pushed the burgers aside in distaste. We looked around for our waitress and even called her a few times. There was no way to get ahold of her. I even noticed her in the corner talking to a fellow waitress, figures. I got up angry and walked over to the manager. I told her all about our expierience. She was apologetic and ensured us that the meal would be on the house. Eventually the waitress returned and took our burgers away. You think this would be where the nightmare ends, and I wish it did. But no. It only gets worse. A few minutes later a cook walked out with our burgers. He insisted that they WERE veggie burgers and he took them out of the plastic himself. He talked about them having fake grill marks (there were none) and being boca. We insisted they weren't(5yr vegetarian,we know boca) and that we were feeling sick. When you've been vegetarian for a long time you get pretty sick from eating meat. He left them on the table and walked away. We pushed them aside again and waited angrily. The manager walked over and said the cook wouldn't lie about that. We insisted again that they weren't veggie burgers and after even being told by someone who works there that they were turkey burgers we just couldn't eat them. After another ten minutes or so of sitting there our waitress silently dropped our bill and walked away. Not only were both burgers on the bill, so were two drinks, the goat cheese appetizer, AND the jalapeno corn fritters. At this point I was so livid I wanted to just leave. Waitress, nowhere in sight as usual I had to go back to the manager. She apologized and we waited about 20 minutes for the check to get changed.The only thing she took off was the fritters. The goat cheese, two burgers, and both drinks remained. I went up to her to discuss the overall expierience and WHY after such a dreadful expierience we were being charged for EVERYTHING. She said because the burgers weren't the problem in the end so we should be more than happy to pay for them and everything else and she hopes we will come again. Are you serious?

They're more the texture of biscuits, and have visible layers. It's also studded with some fruit that looks like cranberries, but doesn't taste like them - probably red currents? And the devonshire cream they serve with it is delectable, like a less sweet, more dense cream cheese frosting. YUM.\\n\\nNext was a savory course of canapes which was less impressive. They were a variety served on white bread that had been cut in small rounds. I enjoyed the portabella mushroom one the most, and can't comment on half b/c they were meat laden. \\n\\nFinally, another round of desserts with a vanilla and chocolate petit four and a mini cheesecake.

The food-coma euphoria gave me life. \\n\\nThings to know:\\n*****\\nI. LOCATION & PARKING: Atlanta Breakfast Club sits across the street from one of the Georgia Aquarium's parking decks. They have six parking spaces in front (which are more coveted than Wu-Tang Clan's Once Upon a Time in Shaolin aka the most expensive single album ever sold), and... yeah. I suggest one of three things:\\n\\n- Don't drive. Hail an Uber or Lyft.\\n- Park on Mills St. NW (behind the building), for free. (Limited spots, though.) \\n- Arrive before 10 am or after 1 pm. \\n\\n*Pro tip: Patrons can now reserve your spot in line using the Yelp app, and it provides an estimated wait time. Arrive before the estimated time to check in with the host, and you won't have to stand for too long.\\n\\nII. FOOD & DRINK: They offer your classic Southern brunch fare, and a few dishes have twists. I devoured the following:\\n\\n===Recommend===\\n*Shrimp & Grits ($14.95): Probably the second best bowl of this stuff I've eaten in my life. The perfectly creamy and savory grits paired well with the small shrimps they used. I couldn't stop eating and would totally jump in to a pool of this stuff buck naked. Ugh, omg, thank you, Jesus. (And I'm Buddhist.) \\n\\n*Peach Cobbler French Toast ($10.95): An immaculate, unique take on French Toast that did not disappoint. The crispiness and sweet made my eyes roll into the back of my head. I love carbs. I love this Peach Cobbler French Toast. It's as if Selma Hayek turned into a breakfast food. (I don't mean to objectify her, though.) \\n\\n===Good, but wouldn't order again===\\n*Crispy Chicken Biscuits ($9.95): These homemade biscuits -- with chicken breast, and signature gravy -- didn't serve as my favorite entree (because the others set the bar so high) but I liked it. I don't dig the slight sweetness, but the biscuits tasted flaky, and they didn't overcook the chicken. \\n\\n*Cinnamon Roll ($5): They don't always have cinnamon rolls, but I liked theirs. Was it transcendent? No. But I ate up the roll's frosting. The roll itself tasted a bit dry.\\n\\nFor drinks, they offer coffee, minute made, juice, and other conventional sips.\\n\\nIII. SERVICE: I had William as a server, and he slayed. His on-point recommendations made for a memorable first time. And for a packed house, I thought the food arrived reasonably fast.\\n\\n*Note: If you've complained about their long line, then head over to another brunch places with short lines and terrible food. #savage\\n\\nIV. AMBIANCE & DECOR: It's a mix of classic diner and industrial. Most importantly, it's spotless inside. Oh, and they play Atlanta hip-hop. Enough said, yo.\\n\\nV. PRICES: Very reasonably priced, especially when compared to other brunch joints in the A (that don't taste as good). \\n\\nVI.

The  red velvet waffles tasted more like tea and the shrimp and grits looked like they had been left under a heat lamp but all in all it wasn't bad.

I also asked about the student special just to see the distinction between that, and a normal five wings order. I showed my student ID, added a beef patty to my order, and was off to the races.\\n\\nIt turns out that the student special is $1 cheaper than the five wings meal, because it contains $1 worth of less chicken. He got five wings. I got four. They were certainly tasty, but they were also gone before I wanted them to be. The beef patty however was freaking delicious, although it felt expensive at $2 for beef puree in a shell. The meal came from some bland french fries that needed ketchup, but was otherwise OK. We sat at the window chairs, and chatted while gazing out onto Blue Hill avenue.\\n\\nI also learned exactly what Tingz are. It turns out that it is an industry term for a $1 surcharge for using a credit card. That was certainly not what I expected when I read my receipt, but they had already charged me, so there was not much I could do about it.\\n\\nSo there you have it. Get your wings.

Their pastries are legendary and this is definitely the best place to get one of Boston's famous cannolis.

In addition to their delicious treats, they are just as well known for the absolute chaos that engulfs the bakery as hordes of around 50 customers attempt to order without any semblance of a line. Although my blood pressure skyrockets every time I set foot in Mike's, I never have to wait too long to get served. The staff are very efficient and do a fantastic job at making sure customers are in and out as quick as possible. Speaking of leaving the bakery, don't plan to stay there and eat your food. There are a couple tables and chairs laid out for customers to sit at, but do you really want to eat your food surrounded by dozens of customers that are packed in the store like sardines? Not very fun. \\n\\nThe food at Mike's is all delicious, but I recommend all first-timers to order a cannoli. They have a deliciously flaky shell and a creamy filling (ricotta is the most traditional) that is to die for. I have also tried their ice cream, Lobster Tails, cookies and brownies and have never been disappointed by anything. Aside from the cannolis, the Lobster Tail is absolutely fantastic and another crowd favourite. The reason I'm giving Mike's a 4-star review rather than a 5-star review is because I find their pastries to be a tad over-priced (they average $4-$5) and they only take cash. Although this is fine for tourists who typically have a wad of cash on hand, I can't remember the last time I kept bills in my wallet. I guess cash makes transactions a lot quicker, but there have been too many times when I've wanted to go to Mike's for a cannoli but haven't because I only carry cards.

The meat is salty but it also lick-worthy good. \\n\\nThis was the first BBQ on our two day, three barbecue joints odyssey and it was an outstanding welcome to Austin. We went with the Family Style AYCE ($19.95) even there was only two of us. As Camellia C. would say \\"BOLO!\\" which is the barbecue version of YOLO.\\n\\nService: 5*\\nPeople here are so nice, welcoming, and generous. Our waiter Sam always anticipated when we wanted more food, soda, sides and would be johnny-on-the-spot with more meat when our plate was even half-empty. The words \\"let me get you some more meat\\" without us even asking were sweet music to our ears and encompasses what makes Salt Lick so great. \\n\\nFood: 3.5-4*\\nI hate to reference Big Thunder Ranch BBQ (BTRBBQ) in Disneyland when talking about the Salt Lick but it is the only other place I've had the pleasure of All-You-Can-Eat BBQ. The food at Salt Lick blows BTRBBQ out of the water. However, I thought the brisket was dry and needed to be paired with copious amounts of their really good sauces (Spicy Recipe was better than original IMO). Eventually, with each new plate of meat, the brisket got more juicy and more tender. I almost felt like a game where they were rewarding us for finishing each level of meat. \\nThe pork ribs were much better, not quite fall off the bone but didn't take much to bite the meat right off. \\nUltimately, I liked their sausage (the oft neglected third meat of the Texas Trinity) the most. Crisp (snapping with each bite), juicy, plump and delicious. \\n\\nThe best part is just the crazy amounts of meat you get. Plates are filled with a mountain of meat. The sides are hearty and the cole slaw was really delicious. Light, crisp cabbage with a very light sauce and nothing like the mayo-heavy cole slaw you might see at KFC. \\n\\nVerdict: I ultimately tried Rudy's, Franklin BBQ, and Salt Lick in these two days and Salt Lick would be number 2 in terms of food (considering Brisket, Ribs, Sausage, and Sides). \\n\\nAmbiance: 5*\\n\\nSalt Lick is beautiful inside and out. It is so spacious and relaxing. It has a vineyard, a big ranch area where kids can play on a jungle gym and big groups can take up multiple picnic tables for anything from a weekend grill-out session to even wedding parties. When you walk in, you pass by their mega wood-fire grill and it is the crown jewel of the place. Make sure to take a picture next to it because it is a BBQ lover's must!\\n\\nShort version: I'd try Salt Lick at least once for sure. Salt Lick is fantastic for big groups, they give you all the food you could ever dream of, you don't have to wait in long lines, and the service is everything that is right about Austin TX's hospitality.\\n\\nTips: No wait at 11:54 am on Saturday 2/15/14, CASH ONLY.\\n\\nBBQ Lover Tip: Ask for one last plate during the Family Style AYCE and let your server know you'd like to take some of it to-go (even your soda). They'll slide you the biggest plate of meat you could ever hope for, Sam also winked at us and told us not to tell anyone that he was giving us so much meat.

Despite Austin's coup of the top BBQ city in Central Texas this place was the original. \\n\\nThey have barns, dirt roads and glorious smoke going 24 hours a day. Despite not having a traditional smoker they are able to get solid pink smoke ring on the Beef and yes this is beef country.\\n\\nBrisket us moist, has bark and the fat is melted and broken down to perfection. Pork ribs are good, but could use some more seasoning. Turkey is brined so it doesn'tdry out, but I found it bland without traditional Thanksgiving sides. Beef ribs are large and meaty, real dino sized. Sausage has snap, spice and is very juicy. Thurmans choice is what I got along with a split beef rib order with my friend. Pickles are great as well as the onions, apparently the bread varies from white to rolls. I got white and it was just fine. We took some to go back on our trip back to Austin and we took beer out here on out trip from Austin. That's the real protip. Take some bread and get the Marino Chop for some road munchies. Not near the side offerings I was expecting from a more family oriented BBQ place. Sweet tea with free refills, amazing. Peach cobbler was good, but I would have liked some textural differences in it. A tad mushy.\\n\\nMy friend Richard could not have painted the picture coming in any better. The service is excellent, very catering to travelers instead of locals and regulars. Prices are very affordable considering the weight of the portions. Ambiance is pretty much like all of Texas. Slaw was a little dry and bland, mac & cheese was classic, not dry or oily.

We made reservations for 8:30p.m. and called earlier that day to confirm all was good. We arrived at the crowded restaurant at 8:20 and told to wait for a table to clear. There is literally no room inside the restaurant to stand and wait for a table to be ready so no matter where we stood we ended up being in someone's way, even by the bar area. It made for a very stressful and annoying situation. At about 8:40 our buzzer buzzed and we went to the hostess for our table, she said \\"Oh sorry, i meant that for a table of 2,\\" and told us to go back and wait again. Meanwhile tables large enough for our party of five were clearing and random groups who came after us were being seated. The hostess made no apology or acts to speed up the slow process of finding a busboy to clear the empty tables so people could be seated. \\n\\nThis went on and on until about 9:15 when we finally sat down. At that point we were ravenous and frustrated. A waitress didn't greet us until 9:30 even after we had asked several passing by busboys for assistance. When we FINALLY got our food it wasn't anything better than I could've made at home or gotten at Olive Garden in Framingham. The $20 LINGUINE CON VONGOLE was essentially linguine in a hot water and garlic broth, with a few sketchy tasting clams in it... but at that point I was so starving I ate it anyways. My friend's pizza was soggy and the toppings were sparse. Most annoyingly, when the check came an 18% gratuity was already added. I usually am a good tipper but this extreme lack of service or quality did not deserve an 18% tip and I was very annoyed that it was auto-added. Very disappointed at the service we had here on a night that was a special outing for friends who hadn't seen each other in a while. \\n\\nWould certainly NOT return here or recommend it to friends unless they have money to blow and time to waste."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"My review is not related to the food, but trampling upon the concept of a reservation.

I will preface by saying I did take advantage of a fantastic $52.80/night  \\"Mile High\\" promotion, so we were getting a very good deal price-wise. I read all the negative reviews online and started to get very nervous. However, we were very pleasantly surprised by what we got. Although it is definitely true that elements of the hotel structure are dated, in our room at least we felt they had done a good job of renovating surface elements and decorating the room with a nice ambiance (definitely better than a Motel 6 quality as some reviewers asserted!). Everything seemed clean and orderly. We were personally extremely pleased with the firmness of the bed; it's the first time in a while that we have traveled and not woken up with a backache from a too-soft hotel bed. We also loved the big window and heavy curtains, enabling us to both have a room beautifully lit with natural light in the day time, and near-total darkness at night. The tv certainly is dated, although my husband and I don't generally utilize the tv when we travel so it didn't affect us much. The grounds were beautiful, and the location was great, a very easy and quick drive to Pearl Street and other Boulder locations. The internet situation definitely needs improvement; in this day and age I think it is outrageous and unacceptable to charge for internet use in the lobby business center. I had overheard a man being told at check-in that in room wi-fi was included in his stay but we were unable to verify for ourselves  whether they charge for wi-fi or not as the router in our part of the hotel was experiencing technical difficulties. We overall found the front desk staff very helpful and friendly; we were offered a new room when we asked about the router issue (we declined) and told we could always use the complementary wi-fi lobby (we did, also the free wi-fi range extends to the bar so one evening we sat in the bar with our laptop to check e-mail while enjoying drinks). Another front desk staff member gave us a great recommendation for a breakfast burrito place in walking distance that we loved. The only downside is they indeed do not offer complimentary toiletries as many hotels/motels do, but referred my husband to Safeway when he asked if they had any shaving cream since he neglected to pack it.\\n\\nOverall, we were pleased with the hotel. I can see the justification behind a couple of the complaints such as wi-fi, but we both agreed that it definitely felt like a much nicer place to stay than a Motel 6 or La Quinta level hotel, and especially at the price we paid we were extremely satisfied with our visit."},{"name":"Tiki Rock","address":"2 Broad St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Fun vibe and good tiki drinks, but I would not recommend ordering food here.

I love it in the morning, for lunch, and I particularly love it for dinner on a Friday night when the work week is finally over and I can shower and relax. It is my quintessential comfort food category. One that when done right, makes everything in my world i'rie mon (harmonious & happy).\\n\\n\\n[ THE EXPERIENCE ]\\n\\n4.5 star average rating after 2,000+ reviews sets an expectation in my mind that I can't turn off. So lets start with arriving. While many people talk of the wait time (which was an hour in our case for 2 people), parking is really the most stress inducing part of the visit. The two lots available for the business are relatively small for their popularity and street parking is a waiting game requiring extreme patience. You practically need the long wait time just to find decent parking.\\n\\nOnce seated, pray you are not near the front, because on busy days (like our visit) people waiting for a table spill into the dining area. It is highly likely you will have a butt  standing near your shoulders or a purse that feels dangerously close to knocking you in the head if seated near the entrance. People waiting don't  seem to be conscious of personal space violations.\\n\\n\\n[ THE FOOD ] \\n\\nAs far as the food, nothing was terrible and nothing was extraordinary, which was upsetting considering the wait time, trouble finding a decent parking space and the fact it is 42 miles from my driveway to the restaurant. I wanted the food to match the effort to dine there and I personally did not feel it was energy well spent on my part. We ordered:\\n\\n+ GULF SHRIMP N' GRITS (3.5 stars) | $13.95\\nI've had amazing shrimp n' grits all over the south! My favorite shrimp n' grits on earth are 45 minutes north of Atlanta in a town called Lawrenceville, GA. Again, expectation from the high yelp rating did not match reality. I thought the shrimp n' grits were good, but boring and not particularly flavorful.\\n\\n++ PEACH COBBLER FRENCH TOAST (4.5 stars) | $9.95\\nBest item of our visit! Lived up to my expectation for such a highly rated restaurant. NOTE: Shared like an appetizer\\n\\n~ BREAKFAST TACOS (3 stars) | $9.95\\nThe tortillas are made of a french toast batter, kinda like the McGriddle sandwiches @ McDonald's. Not bad, but not great either. In the right mood, I might have enjoyed this more, but on this day I wanted it to be a corn tortilla taco. NOTE: Shared like an appetizer\\n\\n~ SALMON CROQUETTES (3 stars) | $12.95\\nMy mother made these all the time growing up. As a kid I hated them, but as an adult, I really loved them. I would have liked more flavor and found the ones here a little too mild for my taste.\\n\\nFinal bill with coffee & OJ = $64.52 before tip\\n\\n\\n [ SERVICE/ATMOSPHERE ] \\n\\nOur server was extremely friendly and prompt. The hostess was also super nice and management walks around checking on every diner, which was a lovely personal touch. However, the environment feels chaotic and somewhat claustrophobic. Everything just feels so tightly packed together. I'm sure this is not a bother for some, but it added a little anxiety to my experience, and I'm not prone to being anxious.\\n\\n\\n[ FINAL THOUGHTS ]\\n\\nI honestly think I make a better breakfast at home. While the pricing here is EXTREMELY reasonable for a near downtown establishment (right across from the Georgia Aquarium), I just don't see returning to deal with the parking, wait, long drive and lack of amazing flavor to make the trouble of dining here worth it. But hey, 2,000 other reviewers say differently, so what do I know!\\n\\n3.5 stars overall\\n\\n\\n2019/25"},{"name":"King Bao","address":"710 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"When you walk in, you will notice that the seating might be an issue.

Weren't looking to spend a ton of money and Thai food is usually a good bet.  I had the Massaman Curry with beef ($9).

The sweetness is offset by tamarind, transforming the slow cooked meat of your choice with potatoes, carrot, onion, peanuts and crispy red onion.  Hmmm.  Interesting description don't you think?

Up until last night Arabian Breeze has been one of our favorite restaurants for atmosphere, good food, reasonable prices and decent service. \\n \\nLast night was my wife's 40th birthday there; coordinated in advance complete with the number of expected guests (about 35,) complete with two telephone confirmations on the date, time and number of guests.  Despite the confirmations, we received one waitress who seemed new and put-out to deal with the large group and another person who appeared to be extremely new that was helping by occasionally bringing bread and water to us.\\n  \\nTo be fair, 1 of our 3 tables was reasonably happy with the service they received, their dishes came in a reasonable time and they did not feel horribly neglected.  The other two tables, ours included, received unpleasant, inconsistent and in some cases, non-existent service.  Most notable were the many strange comments made by the server which I am about to go into.\\n\\nOur table which received the night's middle of the road service, received our meals approximately a  1/2 hour after ordering, received one drink that was passable and another of the same drink that they apparently ran out of one of the ingredients and decided to ad-lib on, making it unpalatable.  When asked if they could make other drinks, we couldn't get a straight answer, just \\"we have a limited bar,\\" and other non-committal remarks.  Although I was not present to hear the remarks, two other people at our table were upset by the server's attitude and snippy comments which they did not repeat to me.\\n\\nBy far and away, the worst service was received by the last table where several people waited two hours for their meals which they NEVER RECEIVED.  When they brought this up to the server, she made the comment that \\"oh, this party was only scheduled for 15 people\\" so there for we should not expect quick service and that \\"for parties this large, they only do buffets.\\"  We specifically asked during the confirmations if 35 people ordering separate dishes would be OK and the owner said \\"yes.\\"  The server went on to say that \\"you know, the owner speaks Arabic, don't you?\\"  To which, my friend responded that \\"he spoke English on the phone.\\"  Other strange comments made were that they \\"had to do dishes to have enough plates,\\" and others indicating that even though our individual bills weren't necessarily the food we ordered, they were for lesser costing dishes.\\n\\nOverall, I would have been content if they would have just been honest but it seemed to be restaurant policy to try to lie and cover they short comings.  I completely would have understood if they told us to be patient because they were short staffed or that they really didn't have the ability to make mixed drinks.  I am also embarrassed that my friends left after two hours to go to another restaurant because they were too hungry and frustrated to wait any longer and that the restaurant did nothing to correct, make up or even address the situation with them or us which has led to this unfavorable review.\\n\\nTo qualify this, I do not generally write negative reviews, but after feeling embarrassed and lied to as friends walked away from my wife's birthday party, I felt this was a valid exception."},{"name":"Crush","address":"1400 SE Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I really want to like this place, but so far its just ok.

Definitely one of our favorite places we tried."},{"name":"Grand Floridian Cafe","address":"4401 Floridian Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Lately it seems that where I dine is largely determined by where my friends and clients stay when they visit Orlando. Today, a breakfast meeting brought me to the Grand Floridian Cafe in the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa. \\n\\nThere is no question that the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa is a beautiful setting for a meeting. It tries to evoke turn of the century (not the most recent turn . . . the one before that!) Florida charm and it succeeds wonderfully. High ceilings, large windows, lots of natural lighting and tasteful furnishings all contribute to the sense that visitors are stepping back to the early 1900's. (I hope that is the hotel's intent but, regardless, that is my perception of it!) \\n\\nThe Grand Floridian Cafe is located in the Resort and Spa. I located it with only a couple of hiccups along the way. When I arrived, the gate attendant rather vaguely told me to park across the street but did not really tell me how to get across the street. When I did finally get inside the facility, the employee with whom I consulted for directions to the Cafe gave me directions that were not accurate so I had a bit of an adventure in finding the Cafe. As a result, my client arrived at the restaurant before I did . . . not something that I wanted to have happen. \\n\\nWhen I did make it to the Cafe, it was a very nice setting -- like most high end hotel restaurants in Orlando. I was comfortable. The lighting was great. The linen table cloths were clean and freshly pressed. Everything was I would expect it to be, and equally unmemorable. Perhaps that is what a restaurant should be but I would like something more unique that would require me to pay more attention to my surroundings. \\n\\nOur server was very nice and engaged us in very pleasant conversation. Since we shared a common heritage, based on her name tag which indicated her country of origin, we quickly found a common ground for discussion and it helped to make my companions and I feel welcome. \\n\\nI ordered an egg white omelet with potatoes and dry wheat toast. My two companions ordered a fruit plate and a cheese omelet, respectively. Each of the orders was delivered promptly and was well prepared. \\n\\nThe fruit on the fruit plate (strawberries, various melons, pineapple) was fresh and juicy and served with strawberry yogurt topped with granola. Our omelets were both well prepared -- neither runny nor over cooked. \\n\\nSo why does the Grand Floridian Cafe merit only three stars? It just does not offer food that is comparable to the price that it charges. With tip, breakfast for three came to $53. At an off-property restaurant, the same meal would have cost about half that amount. Yes, we did get all of the Disney bells and whistles -- cold but immaculate setting, great service, excellent ambiance and very good but not remarkable food. \\n\\nIf the value proposition for dining at Grand Floridian Cafe were better, I would have given it a four star review. Unfortunately, that is not likely to be the case any time soon."},{"name":"Gourmet Oriental","address":"625 Washington St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"2","text":"I normally come here often, this will be the last time i come, what a huge disappointment! \\nMy family and i were the only ones on the restaurant side, to start with no greeting.sat down, order hot tea, which was cold , said an actual hot one would be a 5 minute wait.

If you want to astonish your friends/family from out of town, Atlantic station is a great place to start.  This restaurant is situated at the core of Atlantic station with the outdoor seating area facing the central plaza which typically has an event taking place for your viewing pleasure.  The building is designed with clean lines just like a contemporary japanese building would.  As you enter through the vestibule, you're greeted by a nicely dressed doorman making sure you're not too underdressed.  Then you're greeted by the hostess which gives you the option of sitting by the bar, outside, downstairs, or upstairs by the sushi bar.  The color schemes and furniture reflect those of the exterior, contemporary japanese.  There is a private party room, that's worth taking a peek.  It's got a divider with a red/white backlit acrylic panels that I just gotta point out.  Their bar is well stocked which displays extra large bottles that rise from floor to ceiling, which is a nice background to take a picture infront of.\\n\\nNow, the food.  When I come here, I go specifically for the sushi.  Shiiiet, forget ordering sandwichs and soup.  Their variety of sushi is enough for you to ask the waiter for their recommendation cause there's just so many to chose from.  If you decide to sit by the Sushi-bar, ask to be seated by Jimmy.  He's the head sushi chef there, and even has his own menu item, \\"Jimmy's Special.\\"  He, like the rest of the staff is very welcoming.

She ordered the classic Burger with mushrooms and white cheddar. It came out with no mushrooms or cheese but had bacon on it. When it was sent back we were told that the cheese had melted so much that it was translucent. Ummm...I don't think so. I ordered the NY steak sandwich, medium, which is supposed to come with carmalized onions, mushrooms and arugula. It came open faced which was not disclosed on the menu. No arugula, but topped with a slice of tomato. The steak was well done, almost like chewing on leather. It also was about half the size of the bread it was served on. Too add insult to injury nothing was even seasoned, even the fries that came with both dishes. But not seasoning a steak is just embarrassing. Not sure if there was a salt shortage or what. Each complaint was passed along to our server, believe her name was Sierra? She apologized each time and offered us a free dessert. But she never took the complaints to management. How can something be fixed in the future if management doesn't know what the complaints are. So we ordered the pistachio creme br√ªl√©e. It was very basic. No pistachio on or in it that we could taste. Didn't finish any of our dishes and left still hungry. The only reason I gave a two star review is because both the bartender who seated us and our server were both very personable.

I've eaten at this sandwich at 2nd Ave, Carnegie, and Katz's delis and I think Zaftigs is the best - it is actually a normal human height so you can actually get it in your mouth and the meat is really juicy and has a great texture. I opted to have it on a sourdough rather than a rye, which I think made it better. (I had the  New Yorker on a later visit with Pastrami and Corned Beef, which was also good, but was too huge and unwieldy, and not as juicy possibly from just too much stuff) Other noteworthy things I've tried include their latkes and blintzes, not as heavy as these foods often end up being and don't leave you feeling icky. Their French Toast will also keep me coming back. I was not impressed by any of their egg-based foods, yogurt, or chopped liver, but whatever, there's other stuff to make up for it. \\n\\nI also have to give props to their staff, who never seem frazzled by the overwhelming hoards checking over and over to see when their tables will be ready, and our waitresses were usually able to do a pretty good job not losing track of us and checking in.

I came here with friends from out of town, and it was really embarrassing. Service, food, space and wine list were all a 3 or 4 out of 10. I get that cocktails are their schtick, but their wine list is crap - there were only 4 or 5 choices, which seems like an odd decision for a place that strives to be trendy. The menu was ok, but don't bother coming here if you're a vegetarian, because there's not much here for you other than \\"hand-cut\\" chips (not sure where they were hand-cut, though - in a Doritos factory, I think) and really, really salty salsa. We tried the soft tacos and the burritos (also no vegetarian options here), and they tasted like, well nothing.  The wine was warm and the food was cold, the tiny bit of meat in the burritos was overcooked and tough, and the bulk of the filling was just plain white rice. The guacamole looked like it had been sitting out all day. I asked if the tacos could be made vegetarian and they did it, but they could have done so much better than just throwing a few rings of sauteed green pepper together with some raw onion. The space itself is ok, although it's looking a bit worse for wear and there are definitely nicer rooms in Gastown. \\nAnd the server... sigh. She brought us alcohol so I suppose she must have been at least 19, but I think this might be her first job or something, since she was clueless and rude. She was really uncooperative when my friend ordered a beer - acting confused and really condescending about the request, making my friend feel really stupid about asking if they had anything local (they don't) and she either didn't know anything about the beers they DO have, or she just felt like being pretentious. It wasn't a difficult request, sweetie. Basic courtesy seemed to elude her - like if a customer tries to be helpful by handing you the dirty plates on the other side of the table, don't tell him to put it back down so you can do it your own way - and when you are ready to pick it up, try walking around to the other side of the table to pick it up, instead of leaning across your guests for 30 seconds or more, so they have to stare at your side-boob while they try to talk to each other. \\nNext time I want to take friends out in Gastown, I'll just stick with Chill Winston."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Thanky, thanky Yelp for guiding me to quite possibly the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had.

It was a lot sooner than 20 minutes that are bay was ready. The establishment is a big open concept park with different levels of play, we were situated in the middle level on the second floor so the view was super nice.  You can see the Orlando eye fairs wheel from where we were standing. It was just a beautiful night. The staff was incredibly friendly, and were always around, so questions/concerns/orders were easy.  They provide you with all the golf balls and golf clubs in each rental unit and the whole experience is technology-driven.  All of the golf balls have computer chips in them which track the distance and scores.  You can play different types of games, they have everything from beginners up to experienced golf players. I would recommend Topgolf even if you've never swung a golf club in your life, like me ! I still really enjoyed my experience. It was a great date night for the boyfriend and I but its also good to in groups with some friends, or even your family. It's a really nice atmosphere. It's best to visit as early as possible because it's cheaper (as low as $25 per hour) and you won't have to wait in a line. The later you go the more expensive it gets, we went at night so it was $50 per hour which isn't bad if you are splitting it in a group of 4 or more but if its only 2 people it can add up especially with food and drinks  so just keep track of time\\n\\nPs you are required to purchase a membership if its your first time and its $5 which you only pay once, the very first time."},{"name":"Boston Lobster Feast","address":"8731 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"My boyfriend has eaten here before and liked it.

We were seated quickly even though we were a bit early for our reservation.  Water glasses kept full all the time.  Our Waiter did a nice job answering any questions and they accommodated requests from our party.\\nDinner starts with some decadent rolls and biscuits.  Delicious, moist and dense.  The menu items sound and look scrumptious.  Reality for me, well it was less than stellar.  My chief complaint, way too much salt in the dishes (I did sample a bit of everything)  I was so dehydrated, after a few glasses of water no less and no alcohol.  I ordered the pork medallions.  I got thin pork cutlets that were tough.  There is a difference between cutlets and medallions.  While very tasty and salty, it wasn't what I expected.  The special mac and cheese dish with smoked gouda (and I love smoked gouda) was good, but personally, I'd like just a hint of smoky flavor, and with the bacon, just a bit much for my taste.  One of the pasta dishes was just undercooked on the pasta.  Another minute in the water and it would have been perfect.  \\nDessert, was wonderful.

But the end result is pretty great. It doesn't look at all like the previous restaurant!\\n\\nI saw their Dine Out menu and wasn't impressed so I waited until Dine Out ended until I could give it a go. \\n\\nIt's a smaller restaurant but with plenty of service! We were never left waiting and there was always someone checking up on us (but not hovering). It's really nice to see restaurants not skimp on staff. Our server was really friendly and made us feel welcomed.\\n\\nThe caesar salad was delicious! They didn't use the traditional cream sauce we're used to but instead did olive oil but kept the garlic and anchovies. It was a really nice change and the slightly charred romaine was delicious. I liked how they just cut up one romaine vertically and then charred it and served it. It was a beautiful presentation. Three critiques though: I would have liked less olive oil, a tad more anchovy flavor and more parmesan shavings. Other than that, an excellent dish and I've never seen a caesar like this before.\\n\\nThe crispy pork belly appetizer was delicious. Wouldn't change a thing. The beans were cooked perfectly and worked with the nice, perfectly cooked kale and the 4 dollops of sauce really complemented the pork belly. Ok fine, I'd change one thing: I'd like more sizzle on my pork belly. It wasn't as crispy as I like.\\n\\nMy linguine vongole (claims) was delicious! I was a little disappointed with the portion of this dish compared to other entree dishes I saw around me, but it was nonetheless delicious. The chef could have also been a little more conservative with the olive oil. When I finished my delicious dish, there was a sea of olive oil at the bottom. Also, would have liked a bit of freshly shaved parmesan on top.\\n\\nThe deconstructed black forest cake (in a stemless wine glass) was delicious. That was the moistest chocolate cake in a restaurant I've ever had. I could have done without the black forest and just had that chocolate cake by itself. SO good!\\n\\nA wonderful meal here.

This is a pretty good deal considering how expensive Rockmill beer normally is.  For bites, the happy hour appetizer menu had some $4 offerings (a dollar off normal price).  I shared the fries, brussel sprouts, and cheddar biscuits.  The brussel sprouts were tasty, but really kind of reminded me of vegetables coated in the thick sweet sauce you'd find at a Chinese restaurant.  There appeared to be whole mustard seeds in the sauce, but I could only taste sweetness and not the nice spice or bitterness that mustard might lend to it.  The fries were fries... nothing special, but satisfying as all fries are.  The star of the Happy Hour menu in my opinion was the cheddar biscuits.

The salad, vegetables, cold seafood, lobster, snow crab legs, salmon, lobster bisque and prime rib were all deliciously fresh and full of flavor. Several repeat customers I spoke to had excellent things to say.  Our 7 lobsters were cooked perfectly. My husbands favorite was the blackened salmon. I loved the prime rib. The lobster bisque was a bit too salty for my taste but they didn't skimp on the chunks of lobster in it. The kids enjoyed ice cream and my 7yr old had the greatest time for her bithday dinner. All she's wanted was lobster and enjoyed all 4 of hers lol. \\n\\nOur waitress Swaizy was amazing and great about checking in on us especially with it being a full house.

Ever since we moved to Columbus from Philly, I haven't found a decent bowl of pho. I've eaten probably 200 plus bowls of pho in my life. There are some elements that must be important:\\n\\n1. The broth- Shouldn't taste like MSG. Shouldn't be overly sweet or salty. Shouldn't be warm. It should taste beefy with aromas of onions and anise. Their broth is clear and has all the essence. And it is steaming HOT. The way it should be.\\n2. The noodles- Should be springy still when it arrives at the table because it will still continue to cook in the broth. It is.\\n3. The beef- I typically get Pho Tai. That means beef round. You should find a good amount of beef in your noodles. Not one or two measly slices. There's a lot of beef in the noodles. I would encourage folks to get beef on your pho.\\n4. The herbs and other toppings- It should be a plate full of thai basil, cilantro, bean sprouts, lime and jalapenos.  \\n5. The sriracha- I typically just add a quick swirl of sriracha to the pho. Any more, and it will take away the taste of the beef broth.

If you can't make that happen, the shells start to get soft within 4-6 hours.  By the next day, they will be very soggy.  So while the ricotta filling will still taste great, you won't get the satisfaction of a crunchy shell.\\n\\n- The chocolate dipped shells tend to stay crunchier longer. I suppose that's because the chocolate layer prevents the shell from getting soggy.  So these might be the best option if you are taking them for other days (these happen to be my favorite cannoli flavor anyway).\\n\\n- It's unfortunate they don't have a location at Logan Airport, as you see with Laduree in Paris.

The Brussels sprouts, mac and cheese and broccoli were all stellar.\\n\\nA nice selection of wine is available, although it is a bit strange to see this at an Austin BBQ place (remember \\"highfalutin\\").  Local beers and a list of specialty cocktails round out the available libations.\\n\\nNormally I wouldn't have enough room for dessert after scarfing down some 'cue, but they had coconut cream pie on their menu.

Myself and fellow cbusfoodbloggers were asked to create menu items for a Taco Tuesday event. Since each Taco Tuesday at the Kitchen is a theme you can always expect something different which makes it even that much more fun! \\n\\nOn this night we had Loaded Pizza Nachos, Korean Beef Bulgogi bowl (this was my favorite dish of the night), pulled pork quesadilla, tofu bahn mi tacos, a fish and chips taco, a greek lamb gyro, a german sausage taco and a thai peanut chicken salad. Seriously, the guys in the kitchen just killed it with our dishes. Everything was over-the-top fantastic. I could not rave enough. \\n\\nIn additional to amazing tacos and sides, we had some great drinks and desserts too. For drinks there was a strawberry rhubarb paloma and a boozy root beer rumchata float (that is as tasty as it sounds). Finishing off the meal was a apple peach pierogi pie. This was slovak style so unlike any pierogi I've ahd before, this was more flaky and crispy and covered in powered sugar. I could have had 5 of those so good thing they sold out before I could order another. \\n\\nPrices were perfectly reasonable ($3 tacos, sides ran $6-8, quesadillias $5-7 and dessert $4).  In addition to their Taco Tuesday nights, the kitchen also offers event likes meals that you can participate in, you can also have events like dinners, a shower and even get married.

We had a party of 15 people so nothing to big to handle...or so I thought. I am the manager at the clinic and my contact person for the restaurant was Nisha. Nisha was great. She was extremely accommodating, friendly, and was quick to respond to my emails. The doctor at my clinic chose a pre-selected dinner menu which was $70 per person along with an open, top shelf bar. We also had three of the chilled seafood platters waiting on the table for our staff when we got there. The MINIMUM our group had to spend was $1,800 and we went over that amount due to the top shelf alcohol. Our entire staff had extremely high hopes because we only get together like this once a year at Christmas. Only two of the staff members had eaten there before so we were all pretty excited for some tasty food. Man oh man were we in for a surprise. The set up was beautfiful and our servers were pretty good as well. However, everyone except for me ordered steak and I ordered the catch of the day. When ordering the steak the staff was told by the servers that they could not guarantee that their steaks would come out to the temp that they ordered them. WHAT? I thought we were at a steak and seafood restaurant, but apparently you do not get steaks cooked how you like them so why even bother coming to Ray's? I ordered the fish and I must say it was terrible. My poor filet of fish came out without any kind of sauce or butter. It was bone dry. I took it and my fiance's steak home and fed it to our dog. No one enjoyed their steak because just as the servers had told them, they were either over cooked or undercooked. For the two sides we picked mac and cheese and asparagus. Sounds easy and simple, right? WRONG. The mac and cheese had a terrible flavor and we didn't order any seconds on it. The asparagus were huge and tasteless. On our pre-selected menu we had three desserts listed so the kitchen should've known we would all be choosing one of the three listed. Almost every wanted key lime pie, but the kitchen was completely out of it! That left us was the very plain and basic cheesecake and chocolate mousee. The people that ordered cheesecake got cheesecake that was completely frozen in the middle and the chocolate mousse was not good either. I reached out to Nisha a couple days after our dinner and she informed me that the general manager and assistant general manager wanted to speak with me and try to make things right. I thought this was wonderful customer service. WRONG. The so called general manager called me and I informed him of all of the above. He apologized and said numerous people had told him Outback and Longhorn steak houses had better steaks (my entire staff said this as well). He stated that he wanted to make things right and asked me not to post anything on social media so I didn't. I believe in second chances. He informed me that he was going to cater to our staff and would email me to give me more info. Guess what? HE NEVER EVER EMAILED OR CALLED ME AGAIN. I will never eat at another Ray's establishment again neither will most of my staff. It is obvious that there is a serious problem starting from the general management all the way to the kitchen. If you have over four people I would strongly advise to avoid anything with Ray's name it in unless you want to have terrible food and be lied to by the general management."},{"name":"Punjabi Dhaba","address":"225 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"The place is close to my house, and I visit here often.

The room was also pretty quiet, unless a group of rowdy revelers occupied the bar just outside and downstairs from our front door...or if running the heater/air conditioner.

As someone who works in the HR profession, I've seen many people get turned away for jobs due to criminal history. I worked in healthcare which is highly regulated, so I get it. But for other roles, you kind of have to ask yourself \\"If people make mistakes, truly repent and want to turn their lives around, how can they do that if no one is willing to give them a chance?\\" Enter Joe DeLoss and the HCT labor model. Joe is the owner and founder of HCT and he fulfills the roles on his team with associates who may have a previous criminal history. I love that! I know I'm getting away from the topic of the food and what it tastes like. But as a Catholic, I truly feel that everyone deserves a second chance and the fact that Joe is so passionate about these under-represented individuals is heartwarming. I actually met Joe (a fellow Capital grad!) about five years ago and we chatted for awhile. I doubt he'd remember me but his passion and enthusiasm was contagious. I could kind of tell he would make it big one day! So much so that when HCT first initiated as a pop up restaurant in Old Town East, I mentioned the labor model in my grad school class one evening. At the time, only one other person raised their hand to say they had heard of HCT. Crazy to think that just two short years later, I'm sure everyone in the classroom would have heard of it! Anywho, enough about my slight HR crush on the labor strategy. (For more on this topic, go to their website and check out their interview with Megyn Kelly.) \\n\\nOk so now about this chicken!!!! Dang it is so good!! I have been pretty addicted lately which is why I'm finally getting around to writing a review for these guys. This chicken is the best quality chicken I've had. No weird random crunchy pieces (you know what I'm talking about! The piece that you just chew and chew and then have to spit out bc it won't break down. Gross!) Also no weird rubbery looking glossy meat. No sir this is the real deal. The taste is superb and will have you dreaming of more within the next 12-24 hours. My favorite is the hot. Absolutely perfect temperature! If you're unsure, start with the warm and work your way up. Their guide/descriptions on the website are pretty dead on. If I'm getting the meal, I typically also get double mac (never been a coleslaw fan). The crazy part is that when I do that, I end up with two meals: one sandwich for dinner and then the mac for lunch the next day. It's just so much food! I don't think I could ever eat it all. I've also just gotten the sandwich which is the perfect amount. \\n\\nAnd an entire paragraph needs to be reserved for the ranch dressing. I need everyone to know how amazing this ranch is. For starters, it is FREE!!!! And the better part is that you get your own ranch in an assembly line after you've placed your order. So if you're a condiment queen like me, then you can get four containers of it and no one can judge you that you need four containers of ranch dressing for one chicken sandwich (yes I legitimately use all four). I LOVE dunking my sandwich into the delicious zesty ranch dressing. It's actually so good that they've started bottling it and selling it in stores!\\n\\nAnother freebie is the tea! Tea is my favorite drink so I love that too! I like to mix 1/2 Ma's sweet tea and 1/2 Joe's unsweetened tea. It's the perfect amount of sweet! \\n\\nAs for this particular location, this is the OG HCT (unless you count their pop up station in Old Town East.) It's in the upstairs part of the North Market. I came here with coworkers a lot when I worked downtown. I remember the first time we went here was bc I requested it for my bday lunch and then all of my coworkers were hooked by the end of the meal! All of the other times we came here, the line was out the door! (Always a good indicator of a great restaurant)! If you want to skip the line, you can call or order to go online. \\n\\nLastly, my only two critiques (which are more recommendations than anything) is that I'd love to see HCT get a few more side options, preferably potato wedges. How amazing would that be?! And on a similar note, I'd love to see a chocolate pudding cup. The banana one just doesn't do it for me. I love sweets and think it would be awesome to add something chocolatey to the menu! \\n\\nOther than that, HCT keep doin you!

We ate on it for 3 days--that made the more pricey supper check more valuable. Orange chicken was tasty with thick white breast meat with a simplistic orange sauce. Pork fried rice was old school with bean sprouts. Shrimp with snow peas and baby corn was in good quality white sauce. The Rangoon (not sure if that is what they call it here but pictured) was not sweet, actually had some fake crab in it and tasted fair served with sweet and sour sauce as shown. This is not pushing gourmet or even near realistic Chinese (like Canton House) but it is in my opinion the best around the Decatur area.

Vagaries of the economy notwithstanding, if you've been selling cake for a century, you're doing something right. And Lyndell's, open for business since 1887, is definitely doing something right. A ten minute walk from Davis Square on Broadway, Lyndell's let's you know about a block away what you're in for with its old-fashioned red and white sign of a jolly chef dancing. It's a portent of the good-natured ladies behind the counter and possibly of an urge to do a happy dance once you walk in the door. \\n \\nYou will first be met with that intangible quality that can't quite be quantified in any other way than taking a deep breath and being met with the scent of doughnuts, cake, Italian cookies, cream puffs, pastries, pies, and bread all jumbled together. You know, the smell that thrilled you as a kid, when you walked into your local bakery and your mom told you to pick out a treat. Eons could be spent dwelling on that dilemma at Lyndell's, as I don't think it's possible to pick just one treat. Luckily, I didn't have to! \\n \\nI went first for Lyndell's specialty, their half moon \\"cookies.\\" I put that in quotes because the disk of light, fluffy cake is nothing like a cookie, and when frosted with thick, dark chocolate and vanilla creme icing, it really has left the realm of cookie far behind. Call it a flying saucer of cupcakey goodness, but don't call it a cookie, please.\\n \\nWhen you've satisfied yourself as to the deliciousness of the moon cookies, proceed directly to the danishes, cinnamon buns, and other breakfast pastries. This is where the old world influence shows: yeasty bread laced with layers of cinnamon, twisted around dollops of raspberry jam and laced with sugar glaze. This, with a cup of Lyndell's coffee, is breakfast heaven. And judging from the number of goodies they make each morning (and sell that same day), a goodly portion of Somerville agrees.\\n \\nAfter your moon cookie and danishes, veer to the doughnuts that, in and of themselves, justify Lyndell's existence. Cool, creamy custard stuffed into a chewy dough and topped with a dark chocolate glaze: the Boston creme is the apex of what a doughnut can be. It turns out that bliss can be bought folks; and it only costs 95 cents at Lyndell's. You really only want to get one per person though, as this plump baby packs enough goodness to fill you up for the morning.\\n \\nwhen you've oggled the cupcakes, considered hauling home several of their pies (including a lemon pie, which I will have to sample on another round), and generally loaded yourself up with as many boxes of goodies as you can carry, the final touch is the old fashioned machine they use to throw twine over your bakery boxes. No kidding, a machine from the 1950s that ties twine for you.\\n\\nI really couldn't ask anything further of a bakery, except perhaps some tables to sit at.

With a toddler in tow, we figured it would be a fun, easy meal out.  We were sorely disappointed on several counts.\\n\\nFirst of all, we were seated and waited on by a young girl who was not friendly and didn't seem to be listening to anything we said.  We placed our order for a family platter, and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited.  They came by to refill our waters, but never offered an explanation for why our food hadn't come.  The longer we waited, the more the staff avoided even looking at us.  After an hour, we got up and asked someone if they could at least please bring us some injera for our super-hungry three year old.  They did.\\n\\nFinally, our food came, and it was... OK.  We had ordered a three person plate, but it was very skimpy, and some of the dishes only contained a couple of table spoons worth of food.  A lot of it was barely warm, and the lentils were really dried out, they had probably sat in the warmer all day long-- they should not have been served.  A few minutes later, the friendly owner came by our table (for the first time) and asked about how everything tasted.  I told him that it wasn't worth waiting over an hour for.  He apologized and said that something had gone wrong in the kitchen, and that NO ONE had ever had to wait this long for food before EVER in the history of his restaurant.  Hmm...   I said that someone should have said something, anything, to us and at least brought a bite for our daughter.  He also said that was true, and apologized again. Then he brought our table some dessert.\\n\\nInterestingly, we were CHARGED for the injera that we had asked for while waiting over an hour for our food.  Sure, he was nice.  But it in no way made up for the super-crappy service, the mediocre food and the insane wait.  By the way, the restaurant was not very busy while we were there, so all of this seems even harder to justify.

Okay, so family style wasn't what we wanted.\\n\\nOur entrees arrived piecemeal over a ten-minute timespan.

They introduced themselves with their first names and immediately responded to any of my needs.  Rubin, who was on the front desk every day I was there, was unbelievably accommodating.  I left my wallet with my key in my room and he told the other front desk clerk I was good for another key because he remembered me.  He also extended my check out time so I could sleep some more after my meetings because I was awakened by the ice maker in the hall very early on my last day.  He also suggested the \\"Snack Bar\\", a fantastic restaurant a few minutes away.  \\n\\nI was able to hold meetings in the lobby without distractions.  There is a gift shop with a Starbucks right in the lobby (unadvertised), so it was the perfect environment for a meeting.  The weather was unbearably hot (up to 106 while I was there) and so it was delightful to sit in the hotel lobby where it was a nice temperature.  \\n\\nThe workout room was clean with good equipment.  The pool was outside but it was too hot for a daytime swim, but at night it was perfect.  The hotel is right off the main drag of S.

We started with some great bread and a bean puree- sort of an Italian hummus. So far, so good.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it all went downhill from there. The overwhelming flavor profile of this restaurant? Salt, and lots of it. One of our party of three had a Ceasar salad. Passable, but not special. I had the spinach salad with pancetta vinaigrette. Great ingredients- mushrooms, raddichio, roasted peppers and candied spiced pecans- but it was extremely salty and bereft of any acid finish, something I expect from a vinaigrette. I chalked the salt up to the pancetta, though, and moved on.\\n\\nTwo of us split one of their nightly specials. King crab and what I have to say was a perfectly prepared pasta. Unfortunately, the sauce was so salty that I gave up on the wine and mainlined water. This dish desperately needed some brightness and really? King crab without any sort of acid hit to it? The preparation was heavy handed and very one note.\\n\\nThe other in our party had the linguine and clams. Clams were cooked to within an inch of their lives- a bit dry- and this time the sauce was not only so salty it almost hurt to eat it, it was very oily, heavy and far too abundant.  The linguine- again, perfectly prepared- was drowned with it. All of the subtlety of this sort of dish was missing. Was there garlic in it? Who knows?

I have eaten here several times and never had a problem until I decided to order delivery. My first go around was on Grubhub.com.  The order was to be delivered in under an hour...needless to say an hour an a half later, ice cold Naan and all, it was finally dropped off. Whatever. Not a big deal. You can't be perfect all the time. Last Friday evening I decided to try them again but this time opted to call them directly.  I ordered the lamb tikka, raita, and onion naan, the same order I had previously. Now, my same order through grubhub had cost $19.07. This time it was $20.28. Doesn't make sence but I went with it. What's a dollar?  They said it would be 45 minutes...again, an hour and a half later it came...minus the raita. I called them back and explained they had forgotten the raita in my order. After clearly hearing their deliberation, the man came back and said he would have it to my house in 10 minutes. Yet again, 30 minutes passes and I decided to call back to check as my food was getting especially cold at this point. The man who picked up the phone said he was the one who took my order and immediately became mean and hostile. He started to yell at me and claim that I never ordered the raita, nor did i pay for it. First, this just didnt make sense. Lets do the math: lamb tikka-$12.95, onion naan-$3.50, raita-$1.50 = $17.95  + tax (there is not delivery charge). I paid $20.28 and have the receipt to prove it.  He also said that they \\"didn't have time for this\\" and said he was going to give me a credit for next time. Problem. There will be no next time. What is even more sad is that I've been in the industry for over 12 years and hardly ever complain when something goes wrong. I know what it's like to have a rough night but to be as rude and mean as this man was AND rip me off of my also hard earned cash really just upset me.

I was expecting dishes with bold flavors, but the combinations did not suit my fancy. For a Friday lunch they were at 3/4 occupancy and our server took 15 minutes to come over but she apologized for the wait. Alright that's fine. I ask for some recommendations from the small menu and to be fair we did quite like the Brisket Bao she suggested. Aside from taking our orders, we did not see her again until we asked for the check. That of course took another 15 minutes of waiting around. \\n\\n\\nCharred Avocado $5 - not a fan of the pomegranate seed, yogurt combo with the creamy avocado. Personally for my co-worker and I we thought it was too tart. The sourness from the pomegranate seeds too harshly clashed the avocado.\\n\\nBrisket Bao $12 - one of our favorite dishes that packed a ton of flavor. It had a ton of bbq meat overflowing from the bao that I actually needed a fork to assist in picking up the leftovers. The sauce and flavor was not evenly distributed so when I bit into one side it was an explosion of flavor and spice, while the other was much more bland.\\n\\nEggplant Torta $12 - more avocado because why not?! The bread used for this was off for me since it blended into the bland creamy flavors of the eggplant and avocado. Also it was an extremely chewy texture that clung to the roof of my mouth. The sandwiches are probably the best \\"value\\" on the menu as you get 2 large halves but I would not want to eat an entire bland eggplant sandwich. \\n\\nShrimp Louis Salad $16 - ONLY 3 SHRIMPS for the salad! If you're sharing this with several people be prepared to fight your companions for the shrimp. Seriously poor value for this. The dressing used tasted nice and it had a nice flair with the paprika.

The margaritas are decent, although they can't really be credited with anything there beyond not buying Sysco's cheapest mix option. I had a burrito, taco, and an enchilada. The green chile seemed like it would taste good if they tried a little harder but at least I could tell it was made in-house. Everything else was pretty much on par with a fast-ish food restaurant(think Santiago's without the amazing green chile, but served on real plates).

The suspended ceiling was sagging and stained. \\n\\nThe waitress greeted us and took drink orders. She then placed four bite sized pieces of bread on the table in a basket large enough to hold much more, so that the incredibly skimpy portion looked even skimpier!  She was unable to answer my questions about how some of the food was prepared, which I think is a major problem in any restaurant, and when asked questions by a customer ordering take out, she had to make two trips to the kitchen to find out what the customer wanted to know. \\n\\nI ordered the Mediterranean Stackers, which were grilled (burnt) slices of eggplant with tomato, basil and mozzarella  cheese. It was stacked and I think the cheese was melted in the microwave. It would have been so much tastier under the broiler. I also had a side of spaghetti, which I sent back because it was swimming in water. Chef! There were eight people total in the place, could you have taken a minute to drain the pasta? The sauce was watery, tasteless, and loaded with pepper. Pepper! Absolutely awful. And that was just my meal. My husband's? Side salad cut in giant pieces on a tiny, tiny plate with no room to cut the giant pieces, and a giant blob of breadcrumbs and cheese and pepper sauce that was supposed to be eggplant parm. People, please peel eggplant when you use it in Parmesan.

I even worked here for a few months in the Spring of 186.\\n\\nHowever, I would guess that I've eaten there over 3000 times and spent no less than 15,000 dollars there - so when I say consistent, I'm saying 97% consistent. At the nearby Burger King, I have a very, very difficult time simply ordering a \\"Whopper with just Cheese, Mayo, extra mayo, and pickle. - they can't handle that idea at all and I get either a loaded whopper with extra Mayo AND extra pickles, or I get a cashier at the drive-thru telling me \\"it's not a plain whopper if you put stuff ono it. - then I have to go inside and explain that 30 percent success rate is not a success rate at all.\\n\\nHowever, I'll save that review for my next trip to BK - we'll see if they can top their normal mediocrity. I'm here to talk about Wendy's on Main in Reynoldsburg.\\n\\nI order the Double Stack without Ketchup or Onion - no problems - I get pickels and mustard and cheese. I order the Double Baconator without Ketchup, and so it arrives. I ask for three double stacks minus Ketchup and onion on two hamburger (effectively two triple stacks) - and they do it - no hassle, no mistakes, no waiting.\\n\\nI eat fast food about 4-5 times a week all over Central Ohio - this place STILL remains among the best - and it has nothing to do with my consistent visits.

It was a great time, made a lot of memories here, even had one of my friends birthday parties here. Then they hired this girl, she doesn't work there anymore, but usually they would give me a time that my food would be ready and i would come upstairs and pick it up, well this girl would say \\"just come up whenever and your food will be done\\" so i went up after about ten minutes the first time and i had to wait ten minutes while my food was being cooked. I didn't like that but i gave it another shot a week later. Same thing. So on a third occasion i ordered queso dip, i asked her when i should come up to get it and she replied \\"well it will be done when you get here\\" so i said \\"so about 15 minutes then?\\" She said \\"yeah that's fine\\" so i went up after fifteen minutes and i asked for my pick up she said \\"ok i will go get it\\" she comes back out with no food in hand so i asked if my food is ready and she said \\"well the queso gets a film on the top if we let it sit there so i want it to be fresh\\" (mind you i am at work at easton on a saturday during the summer when this happened, i litterally have two minutes to grab my food and go) i told her no, i can't wait and left and didn't eat there for a full year after that. I went some time later because i just wanted a burrito, but didn't want to walk to abuelos to get it so i ordered at adobes. The gave me a time to come get it, i picked it up, went back to work, food was good, end of story. Fast forward about six months to today 9-8-2017..... I'm craving some tacos, condados was packed and i didn't have time for that since it was a busy day to work so i go to adobes website to see if anything strikes my taste buds....as we all know there have been these big hurricanes happening, earthquakes, just a lot of peoples house being destroyed, lives being lost because of these disasters and lots of people having to think about rebuilding and starting over with nothing to start from not to mention my boyfriend who is a merchant marine is out at sea and will be docking on the east coast soon where all of these hurricanes are headed towards....well, i go to adobegilas.com and in big bold letters it says HURRICANE PARTY......OMG SERIOUSLY ADOBE GILAS??????

I found the menu for Bits and Bites in the vestibule of my apartment building and thought I'd give them a try.\\n\\n Their P4, Grilled Portabella Mushroom Panini is delicious. I subbed roasted peppers for caramelized onions and it's easily my favorite thing on the menu. Their P3, Eggplant Panini was also yummy. Both were still warm when I received them by delivery which did take an hour or so. The S4, Spinach Salad I had was a generous portion, fresh tasting, and quite filling. Now the R10, Eggplant Pita Roll-up, I found to be pretty flavorless. It needed more acid than what the large sun-dried tomatoes could offer, they were huge pieces that should have been cut down to bite size. I found the R9, Avocado and Brie Roll-up to be Fresh, but the flavor combination there was not to my taste and there were way too many red onions involved. \\n\\nService in the restaurant is SLOW. I've seen people walk out because their orders were just taking too long. The restaurant was seemed unclean and sticky. The cute menu from the vestibule didn't match the random sports memorabilia on the wall and the drag race that was blasting on the television in the eating area.  I waited 45 min+ for a sandwich and a salad. My girlfriend and I went in together and she was denied a slice of pizza because \\"they didn't have any ready.\\" Mind you, we went in after 12 noon! She ended up having to spend almost twice as much as she had planned on some flavorless mozzarella sticks and cold marinara that looked like it had been something they poured straight from a can and neglected to season. \\n\\nThey delivered me the wrong sandwich once and when I called to have my order corrected I was told it would be at least an hour and a half before that would be possible. I was told my money could be refunded instead. However, they charged me an EXTRA $10 and have yet to refund my money. When I called to complain, I was given a 1-800 number to call which resulted in nothing. I am displeased and outraged by their lack of professionalism. However, for the sheer yumminess of most of the vegetarian options at Bits and Bites, I award them 3 stars.

But over the years I'd always been happy to have gone.  The extensive menu was a big plus.  Every staff person whose path I might cross was effusively friendly.  Quantity, quality, and presentation of the food were unfailingly excellent.  My love for the place was such that when I was organizing get-togethers of persons who'd attended my school in Japan, we always took over Ginza's \\"overflow\\" space and good times were had by all.  Whether I appeared solo or with as many as 38 people in tow, all of the positives outlined above held true.\\n\\nA year and a half, or so, had passed since I'd ambled through Ginza's door.  With an event to attend in the area last night, a couple of Ginza-lovin' friends and I decided to eat there beforehand.  Yeesh!  The place had gone downhill like a Black Diamond ski slope.  It was good to see that the grime and graffiti had been power-washed off the exterior walls, and that the interior was still impeccably clean with a laid-back feel.  (THANK YOU for not having muted flat-screen TV's on every vertical surface!)  But beyond that...not so nice.\\n\\nNutrition guilt usually isn't a factor when you're consuming Asian cuisines.  Just about any entree you order is served loaded with a variety of veggies.  If you're a good girl or boy and eat them all you've built your food pyramid for the day.  The sliced carrots, broccoli florets, etc add to a dish's visual appeal and enhance its taste as well.  But last night it seemed as though Ginza's food buyers had skipped the produce aisle.  One of my friends ordered yakiudon.  Anticipating the typical stir-fry of good eats from the garden, she was taken aback when what was delivered was a heap of noodles with a couple of tofu cubes and asparagus spears.  That was IT.  Even the normally ubiquitous green peppers were nowhere to be found.  Meanwhile, I'd decided to indulge a craving for tempura and selected shrimp.  That's literally  what I got served -  tempura'd shrimp.  Zero vegetables, not even stir-in's for the sauce.  Adding insult to injury, the batter tasted \\"off\\" in the way that batter does when it's time to change the oil in the fryer.  I  *will* concede that the edamame were as crunchy and yummy as fondly remembered.  \\n\\nWe were greeted and sent off with smiles, and the service was quick and efficient.  (Then again, a snowstorm was well underway outside and few other customers were there.)

It's basically a noodle soup with some sort of meat (although you can get vegetarian as well).  If you like ramen noodles or lo mein noodles you will like, and/or, LOVE pho.  I haven't found it until recently but I think it's safe to say that I LOVE pho and this place is the king of Columbus Pho.  This place is a small but charming place with pretty neat decor and every time I've eaten here it's been populated by about 90% asians which is a good thing I think as it shows just how legitimate it is.\\n\\nThe P3 I think is what I get.  It's beef noodle pho and the beef is cooked rare.  Not to worry though, it continues to cook when it's served and it's not raw or even like rare steak you get, it's just normal beef and it's awesome and it's delicious.  The broth is incredibly good, it's like crack, I have no idea what they put in it but I always drink every last drop.  They will give you a large Asian type spoon which is all fancy to sip the soup and then they give you chop sticks for the noodles.  \\n\\nOh yeah, the service is super fast and you can get in and out in time for your lunch hour if you come over here.  They aren't the friendliest bunch as they are always trying to get everyone taken care of but they're never unfriendly, just efficient and fast.  \\n\\nThis is, hands down, one of the best places to eat in Columbus and by far the best Asian place I've ever eaten at.  It's not cheap if you get the egg rolls (got to get the pork and shrimp summer rolls) and a drink, it's an expensive lunch to be honest, but it's well worth it for the quality.  I always get the large bowl when I plan to eat in or the jumbo if I take it with me.\\n\\nIf you like noodles and/or Asian food at all then you must check this place out and be prepared to become addicted like me.  I routinely drive to this place to eat and it's nearly 45 minutes from my house, lol.

There's nowhere to park, nowhere to sit.  How could this be a five-star place?\\n\\nThen I tasted it.  \\n\\nMy wife and I both got the grass-fed beef brisket, since it was Sunday and it's only available on Sundays.  $8 seemed a little steep for a sandwich from a food cart, but it was worth every nickel.  The beef was so tender, and loaded with meaty, smoky flavor.  It's served on a seeded, toasted sub bun with a cup of tangy, spicy sauce.  To be honest, I would've preferred a thicker, richer sauce, and would've liked some pickles on my sandwich, but those things only would've added to an already five-star sandwich.  The sauce was very good, and I provided my own pickles at home.\\n\\nAs good as the sandwich was, though, I think the baked beans were the star of the show.  No other baked beans even come close to these.  The sauce is so rich with brown sugar and spicy, too.  Next time, I'm going to double up on the beans.\\n\\nI'm still calling City Barbeque my favorite BBQ place in town, due to the many menu and condiment options and the fact that they have seating.

However, after only one brief visit to Croissant Gourmet, I can safely say that this is an excellent establishment.\\n\\nI had been trying to get over to Croissant Gourmet for some time and figured that today was as good a day as any to make the trek to it. Fellow Yelper Chris R. mentioned something about this place on Facebook a while ago and, since he really knows his food, that really got my interest. I think he suggested ordering an almond croissant here, which is exactly what I did. I also ordered a piece (it's actually a very long, but thin, pastry; probably enough for two people!) of jalousie, which I've never tried in any capacity or anywhere else before. The sign next to it I believe described it as a pastry with almond butter or maybe sliced almonds in it, as well as raspberries or a raspberry jelly. I haven't tried it yet, but I will later. After I paid for these two items, I sat outside and tried a little bit of the almond croissant, which is delicious! It's very buttery and not terribly flaky (I prefer my croissants to be less flaky than perhaps do others) and was chock-full of/with almond shavings and was topped with powdered sugar and maybe even an almond butter (?; the inside of the croissant looked a little more buttery/\\"yellowy\\" than do the insides of \\"normal\\" croissants). If you check out the shop's website, you'll see a full menu of exactly what else it sells. I was tempted to buy a chocolate croissant (it looked like a regular croissant, except it was drizzled with a chocolate sauce and perhaps has chocolate in its center), but refrained. I don't think I'll be able to resist during my next visit, though. The coco rochers (they appeared to be coconut-flavored macaroon-esque treats) were tough to resist as well, but I was able to ... this time, at least. Don't bet on that happening during my next visit.\\n\\nAll items seemed reasonably priced. My croissant and jalousie were a combined $6 and change. \\"Regular\\" croissants are maybe slightly more than $2, and the coco rochers are I believe less than $2.\\n\\nAs the menu on the website suggests, this is not solely a breakfast/coffee/pastry shop - salads, sandwiches and more are offered. I didn't try the coffee here since I'd already been out to get coffee at Downtown Credo Coffee Shop (see my review) earlier in the morning, but I'm sure it's good here.\\n\\nGive this place a shot! I feel comfortable recommending it to everyone. The majority of the reviews are of the 4- and 5-star variety, and I feel comfortable giving the shop the full 5/5 since I'm extremely eager to return after just one brief visit.

Sure it can get a little loud at night when they have a full house and large crowds, but I personally don't mind that one bit.\\n\\n* FOOD! Neapolitan-style pizza makes my heart sing. We've tried a couple different pizzas on several occasions and the one stand out is: The Crimson Ghost. There's harmony that Pizza Bruno created here--garlicky red sauce combined with the saltiness of the meat and the sweetness of the hot honey. It just works so well when put together.

As a happy hour spot to get drinks Kona is fine. As a restaurant, not so much. I'll 'splain:\\n\\nFood - I hate the term \\"overpriced\\" when it comes to restaurants. Good food at a nice restaurant costs a lot. Deal with it. HOWEVER - some ramen noodles, about 2 ounces of beef tips and a couple of veggies isn't even a meal. Its something a college student makes. This would be the Pan Asian Noodles. The flavor was bland and it was just a weird looking entree. I've also tried the macadamia nut crusted chicken which had been cooked about 20 minutes too long and was as hard and dry at a piece of wood. I've also had the sushi which was mediocre.\\nHOWEVER - The salads ARE good and the pizza is good-ish. So there is that.  \\n\\nAmbiance - Dark woods in the dining area, wide open patio for happy hour. They layout is nice and the decor is nice enough for a date but festive enough for a group. They do a great job.\\n\\nService - I have had the weirdest service at Kona. Last night's waiter was great in terms of an employee for the restaurant but was extremely obvious about upselling us in terms of suggesting deserts and coffee and appetizers in a manner which was borderline pushy. From a restaurant's perspective this is a great waiter as he WILL consistently write larger tickets. But to patrons sensitive to that sort of thing it was a little bit of a put off. He WAS, however, better than the coked up waiter I had last time who was hitting on one of the girls at our table. You're at work dude.  \\n\\nOverall - Kona is a very good place for happy hour. Their drinks are good and in general their service is also good. For dinner, I would recommend pretty much any other place in the Domain. I've had nothing spectacular and I've never eaten a meal there which has compelled me to order it again."},{"name":"Cambridge Common","address":"1667 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Tip to the golddiggers (courtesy of Wendy L): skip the FiDi and come here. The HBS boys come in droves and you'll look much more sincere if you get em while they're young, ya know? So what if you'll have to wait a few years to really get wined and dined, this place is great in the meantime. \\n\\nCheap. Good burgers, good selection of brews, fried pickles. Just pass on the chocolate cake cuz it came straight out of a Sysco (food distributor) box. \\n\\nPlus you can watch the game on their many screens and partake in friendly banter with the patrons. The staff is super chill and as long as it's not super busy (rotation is pretty quick) they'll let you lounge."},{"name":"Burgoo Bistro","address":"1100 Burrard Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Super delicious!

I need a clean, quiet room with a comfortable bed to sleep in, a staff that can answer questions, and help when needed, and some basic amenities like towels and coffee. The Hyatt, while a lovely hotel, dropped the ball in all of these areas at some point during my one-week stay. \\n\\nFirst, it's noisy: the room doors slam shut pretty fiercely, such that you're going to be getting up when most of the people on your floor get up. And due to the open design of the hotel's interior, the live music on Friday and Saturday evenings really carries. You can listen to it while sitting in your room. It was the talk of the elevator Friday evening. Also, there's a lovely back patio that looks out over the lake, but they keep two large TVs going there all day. \\n\\nSecond, the staff, while very polite and helpful-seeming, don't follow through on some of the things they say they'll do. They seem inexperienced and unsure sometimes. This may be because they are so young; I never saw anyone on staff over 30 the entire week.\\n\\nLastly, housekeeping was inconsistent. One day we didn't get glasses, another, coffee. On another day they threw out some \\"garbage\\" on the bureau that was something I was saving. \\n\\nNot a bad place to stay, but I bet there's better."},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"All the 5 star reviews are no accident.

The soup is rich but not greasy, the pork belly and hard boiled egg were cooked just right, and the texture of the noodle was on point. But this place is a bit far from where I live. That's the only reason we didn't visit it again. We do enjoy good food but we usually choose convenience over taste. We are not picky eaters. Last week I noticed there is a new ramen place opened in my neighborhood, so we gave that one a try.

We started our night with margaritas, I had the house and Kelly had the matador. Because of the ingredients they use, all of their margaritas are skinny (bonus points from the ladies I can assure you). Both of them were delicious. We also decided to go with the queso, which came with two salsas, verde and house. All three were delicious. The bartenders were outstanding. Our drinks and apps came out quick, they helped us find seats when we were standing, and every bartender knew us by name.\\n\\nAfter only about a 30-40 minute wait, we were seated. We had a great little table in this great atmosphere. Our server Evan was a funny dude and extremely helpful. We said, what do you eat here? He told us three dishes, and we decided to split the Fajitas Mixta. These were the best freaking things I have eaten in years. They come with chicken, skirt steak and pork belly. And they come with melted foamy butter... Holy hell. Not only was the meat amazing, the homemade tortillas, refried beans and rice were incredible as well.\\n\\nThis place just jumped into my top 5 favorite restaurants in the city in a hurry!
