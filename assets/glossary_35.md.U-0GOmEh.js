If a ramen place can make me get up on a Saturday morning just to line up outside their doors...it's a keeper. I have to say their Ol' Skool ramen (only offered during lunch) is by far my favorite item on the menu. I love the chicken based broth: the lightness, the taste, the soul and depth in flavor. For real though, as much as I like the normal thick, rich pork broth, the chicken broth is so much better. Although the ramen only comes with one piece of Chashu meat, you will cherish that piece of meat with small tiny nibbles to try and make it last.So why not 5 stars? For the price of $9, I just don't feel completely satisfied after finishing a bowl. Don't get me wrong it's really good ramen, but I don't think the portion size is equivalent to what you pay for. Of course this is just me being picky, so feel free to shout at your computer screen and boo at me for saying this.

Between the patio and the pizza specials on Tuesdays, you've got yourself one hell of a quality joint to relax with a pitcher and group of friends at any time of day. It's comforting to know that a place that's yet to be gutted and reconfigured my yuppies still exists in an otherwise overly gentrified part of town such as German Village. The interior has a rustic and woody feel to it that without a doubt has been in tact since Plank's opened for business before the turn of the century, and it's safe to assume that little about the business has changed since then. The pizza isn't the greatest as far as texture goes, but there's plenty of toppings and surface area to make everyone happy enough to look beyond its relatively modest shortcomings. Besides the mysteriously rank smell that sometimes makes its way to the front of the restaurant, there's not much else I can say about Plank's that would be classified as negative.

And I can sautee it with cabbage and pretend I'm Irish.\\nThere is a theory that the more taste dimensions a dish has, the more satisfying it is.

And the burger was good, but very sweet. The bread was sweet, the pickles were sweet, so if that's your jive, have at it!All in all it was fast service with filling, delicious, food.

I have eaten at Pok-e-jo's many times but it had been well over a year. I had forgotten there was one so close to my work. This trip did not disappoint. I will add it to my regular rotation. I judge every BBQ restaurant in the same manner. How good is the chopped beef and sausage/hot link sandwich. I fell in love with this sandwich in college, in Stillwater, OK at a place called Cherokee Strip. They called it a Badwich and still is the best chopped and hot link sandwich ever. They used to have two for 1 on Tuesdays.  Back to Pok-e-jo's they make a very good sandwich it is my 2nd favorite chopped/sausage sandwich in town behind Branch BBQ. The sides I had tonight were green bean casserole and Mac n Cheese. I got all of this for under $10. I think Pok-e-jo's has the best side selection and the best tasting sides in Austin. Oh and they even have buttermilk pie, which is great but not as good as my Mom makes. Pok-e-jo's has two sauces the regular and spicy, I went with the spicy tonight for the first time, it was ok. No where near as good as the original sauce. One last observation I think the location on great hills is much better tasting.

Fat Matt's does not provide a huge variety of food, nor does it give you overwhelmingly large portions of food. However, it has the best sauce in the city, if not the country. That sauce is slathered on perfectly cooked ribs and pulled pork, yielding a decadent sandwich. The sides are typical Southern fare, and they're all absolutely delicious. I'm a huge fan of mac and cheese and collared greens, and they're the real deal here. Top it off with some sweet tea and a slice of sweet potato pie, and it's heaven.

Brunch will never be the same again. Each order of biscuits and gravy has 2 biscuits and a generous serving of sausage gravy. Foodie tip: Save the excess gravy for your chicken. Order the stack of fried chicken skewered on to a waffle. I suggest eating the chicken first with the sausage gravy and saving the waffle and maple syrup for later.The bananas foster french toast is decadent and delicious. It can be eaten as breakfast or dessert. Whatever you choose, you'll walk out a few pounds heavier and a few smile lines happier wondering how soon you can come back.

My meal was the 'Screen Door Plate' which for $13.95 offered a selection of three plates from the sides / local organic selections, along with cornbread and honey-butter.  I chose the plum and fresh fig salad, the catfish, and macaroni and cheese.  My cousins had the buttermilk fried chicken with collared greens, and another Screen Door Plate of hash with chanterelles, and two other dishes.  The food came to the table after a short wait, even though the restaurant was pleasantly crowded.  Each of our plates were presented beautifully but simply.  The portions were also very generous.  Each of the dishes were delectable.The bill for the three of us for the three dinners and two drinks came to about $50.00.  Wow.With a warm, dark maroon ambiance that was inviting and unpretentious, excellent service, and most of all delicious local and organic food, combined with large portions that are very reasonably priced, I easily give Screen Door a 5-star review.

She does not even acknowledge you when you bring the money to her. To her benefit, it's really busy and she's used to Chinese people being rude to her so she doesn't make any effort. In addition, I feel like the place has a sense of arrogance, because it's close to the only elevated parking lot in chinatown and they get a lot of customers, they feel like they don't need to be that polite. One time, one of the waiters came up to us and yelled at us for not tipping enough in front of everybody. After about 5 minutes of yelling, we gave him 2 more dollars and he said thank you and left us alone. Another time, I asked if we can be seated on the first floor so my elderly grandparents don't have to take the stairs. The hostess said in Chinese \\"please...I'm sure they can manage.\\" After these experiences, I boycotted them for about  a year but went back simply out of convenience (it's closest to south station-red line) and the food is rather good.

I have a real simple review for a simply GOOD BBQ place. First though, the Pros:   The staff is very cool and attentive. While you sit at your table they are watchful and keep your glasses full. A VERY big plus!  And at first, I was concerned of leaving 4 stars only because of the small environment and long line out the door. Allow me to point out however that this was due to a Sunday lunchtime and that this place use to be a small diner of some sort or another. And really, the AMAZING food makes it worth it.\\n  \\n   I tried the 1/4th ribs and 1/4th chicken combo with the rum baked beans. I suggest any reader of mine to do the same (or with any side) to really get a good sampling of what they have as truly the very best in Atlanta when it comes to BBQ.  The chicken is SO tender and fall-off-the-bone and the sauce on the ribs is fantastic! The rib meat is savory, each bite leaving you with a bit of heartache knowing it brings you one step closer to finishing your meal.  Gladly though, this combination leaves you QUITE satisfied and for less than $15.  I also recommend topping it off with the homemade sweet potato pie. PERFECTLY made, indeed.  These people know what they are doing, to say the least. They have a separate cook house where they make the food apart from the dining building. A complete building dedicated to the perfection of this BBQ mastery. You MUST try this place if you haven't yet.

I can say that once the line got moving it moved pretty well. My advice is not to get there any later than 730. When we arrived we were about halfway down the line already. Also, they absolutely do sell out so I would hate for someone to spend an hour or so waiting just to get turned away. Get there early and be prepared to wait.

So I just started going there less and less, but it's so difficult when one works in such close proximity. Sigh. So, I think the big tip off is when I got guac with a smear of whiteness.

It was warm, perfect. There was no butter or side served with it - simply because the bread is great on its own. Before dinner began, and after we finished our drinks from the bar, we inquired with our waiter about ordering a bottle of wine. We gave the price point we were looking to stay around. He acknowledged the request, and promptly returned with a bottle he said would pair nicely with all our dishes (and it did)!Our perfect 7 course dinner then began. 1.

I'm also from the Bay Area where there's a boba spot around every corner. When I first discovered Mo Cha, I knew I was going to be coming back frequently. And if I honestly didn't live 30 minutes away, I'd come everyday. First of all, their boba is bomb! It's always super sweet, not too hard and not too soft.  My all-time-favorite-go-to boba drink is definitely the Peach Mango Green Tea with regular boba and rainbow jelly. I don't know why, but this combination just always seem to hit the spot! I've tried other things on their menu, but nothing seems to beat this one. If you prefer fruity drinks over milk tea, this is a good one to try. If you want a snack to pair up your drink with, I've always liked their Popcorn Chicken. The portions are rather large so it's definitely enough for to share (or more for yourself!), and they give you the option of making it mild, medium, or spicy. I've tried spicy and OOOH! it definitely has a kick! Unless you're up for it, medium might be your best bet. It still has a little hint of spice, but not too much. If you love spicy, go for the spicy! I enjoy the atmosphere. It's a cute place that's usually packed on the weekends, but now that the weather is starting to get colder, people seem to be jamming in the place a lot less. There are plenty of tables and chairs for groups, and some high table/chairs on the side for smaller parties Aside from the fantastic boba and food, another thing that keeps me coming back is the fact that they have a loyalty card program. Every 10 visits is a free drink as long as it's within a $4.00, I believe.

But really, how bad is a wait at a restaurant where you can just sit at the bar and get margaritas? That's where I've always found my friends. Last I went there we got pastellitos for an appetizer which were little pastries filled with chieken and a dip that was oil, oregano, and other tasty goodness. For an entree I got fish tacos, much to the amusement of everyone hearing me order fish tacos and let the jokes fly about them being able to witness me eating fish tacos. But in all seriousness, they weren't so good.  Maybe I've been spoiled by the west coast and Hawaii, but I'd always had fresh pan-seared fish in the tacos, not a huge hunk of fried fish. The margaritas were tasty, but severely lacking in the alcohol department.  The first one I had I couldn't taste any alcohol. The second one tasted really strongly of tequila at first sip, but then was just as bland as the first. Good thing they aren't very expensive. All in all, a good night out.

We didn't realize that the restaurant serves predominantly \\"small plates\\" for sharing, but as we were curious to try multiple dishes that was totally fine with us! Our waitress (really fun and nice, with short curly hair) recommended that we each get two dishes for a total of six for the table. We tried the grilled octopus panzanella with sunchokes, Maine shrimp with lemon aioli, Spanish mackerel with celeriac remoulade and pickled green tomatoes, the New York strip with burnt scallion and tonnato, the pork belly with grits and apples, and the \\"secret burger\\" which that day was pretty simply dressed with bacon, lettuce, onion, and Thousand Island dressing.Of all the dishes we tried, I was most fond of the octopus panzanella, where the meaty grilled octopus was perfectly contrasted with the crunch of the sunchokes and bread and the tang of the lemony dressing, the deliciously tender New York strip, and the \\"secret burger,\\" which, although simply, was unbelievably rich and tasty--you can really tell the beef that they use is quality. There's a reason why it runs out so quickly! It is obviously meant to be a meal for one person, but it would be very hard for me to eat all of it. I was less impressed with the other three plates. Each were perfectly cooked, but the mackerel was overly strong and \\"fishy\\" as the way that mackerel can sometimes be, though the remoulade and pickled tomatoes were wonderful. The Maine shrimp were tiny, tiny enough that the waitress recommended eating them shell and all. Unfortunately the shrimp were not fried enough that the shell was totally crunchy--it was left chewy enough that it made more sense to peel the shrimp before eating them. Nevertheless they were tasty and we had great fun sucking the \\"juices\\" out of the shrimp heads! I was most excited for the pork belly, but it was very, very fatty--I realize pork belly is meant to be fatty, but there was almost no meat to complement it. So out of 6, there were 3 that were absolutely stellar and flawless, and 3 that missed the mark a bit. Obviously not everything is for everybody, and the meal was really lovely and the ambiance and service wonderful, so I'd recommend Alden and Harlow.

First, this was the only time in my life that I was not offered chopsticks at a Sushi place. I was given a fork, and I had to hunt down someone for  what should be the default.Forks? Really?? Meat, it was fishy, covered up with sauces. The spicy tuna looked like a childs thumb in a snowball of rice. Lots of rice, but they are cheap on the meat.  The overall quality seemed low, and fast food. Like grocery store Sushi. The Edamame was dry and saltless. The only good thing was the Soke, which is almost impossible to mess up since im guessing it was no made by them. The service was ok, the order was messed up and it had to be remade. We asked for one roll to be rolled in cucumber instead of rice which is nothing too crazy if you're at a real Sushi place.. but forget about it, this was like asking for a taco at a pet store. We had to visually explain it multiple times to the waiter, and they still messed it up.Overall I can only judge the sushi at this place, so the \\"Asian Cuisine\\" might be decent.

Anything less feels like an injustice. The interplay of the smoke and the fat and the rub is just perfect. I waited three hours and would happily do so again. If I had a single negative thing to say about the brisket I would, but I just don't.The ribs were very good, but not as good as the brisket. I actually preferred the pork ribs at Smitty's in Lockhart. The pulled pork was quite tasty as well, but also out shined by the brisket. These aren't so much knocks against Franklin's other meats as acknowledgements that reaching that level of quality is an almost impossible standard to match on the other meats.I actually consider the wait a positive aspect of my visit. It made the trip to Franklin an experience, rather than a mere meal. We showed up at 8 am and were about 10th in line. Having asked a few friends who's made previous visits, we brought folding chairs and champagne, because what's a Sunday morning without a little booze. We then spent the next three hours getting to know the people in line around us. I don't think being generous with the alcohol hurt, but we actually had fun, vibrant conversation. There's an instant shared quality that sparks conversation: the willingness to be at a BBQ place three hours before it opens just to have some smoked meat. I'll remember hanging out beforehand almost as much as the meal itself.Another thing I liked was that they make three different sauces, each tailored to go with a different meat. The dark espresso sauce pairs well with the richness of the brisket. A tangier, lighter sauce to go with the pulled pork, and a middle ground, dark sauce to go with the sausage. Oh yeah, I forgot about the sausage. It's fantastic.We tried the bourbon banana pudding pie and the lemon chess. Both are provided by the Spoon Cake bakery in Austin and both provided light, flavorful bites after the meat. I enjoyed them both.Plan ahead and make a morning out of it. You won't regret it.

The service was excellent and the food came out quickly.  Eating the ribs was a sticky mess, but that's the way to eat them!  The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender.  The only negative thing to say about them is they are expensive.  A full rack of ribs is about $20 by itself, but it is worth every penny.

Its a good way to judge the food before diving into an expensive night of food.Drinks - I had the Siamese Caiparinha which had good flavor but not a lot of drink.  The happy hour price was $8 but not unexpected since most of the drinks were mixology style.Escargot - pretty good.  I could taste the kaffir lime leaf.  I still was missing a little something that I can't figure out (maybe salt? butter flavor? hint of garlic?)  It came with good bread but a little too toasted to soak up all the extra sauce.Fried Cotija Cheese - absolutely amazing.  I've never had Cotija cheese as a chunk but it was delicious.  It was soft and chewy and buttery in texture.  There was a hint of truffle oil which I did taste.  Their was a fruit (which I can't remember) as well which added some sweet but I would have rather had more fried cheese.Brussels Sprouts - very good.  I actually wasn't going to order this because I was thinking the apple part would make it a sweet dish. We ended up trying it and I would definitely get it again.  Not sweet at all and very flavorful. Also came with some kind of fried breaded rice cube which was good to mop up the extra sauce with.Ambiance - even though we went for happy hour it was already night time so I can only vouch for how it looks at night.  Awesome ambiance - dark setting with soft lighting and candlelight.  Definitely a must go for date night.Cons - we were still pretty hungry afterwards.  The happy hour plates were small (I'm curious if it comes with more when not on happy hour).  Granted...it was only $5 per plate....I was just expecting a lite more food on the plate.I will definitely come back and try the pork chop (highly recommended by the bartender)."},{"name":"No Mas!

I'm not a BBQ sauce lover and have never liked those places where the food is smothered in sauce or you are expected to choose from a large selection of sauces for your food.At Franklin's you really don't need to use a sauce. They do provide 3 sauces (a dark coffee flavored sauce, a mustard based sauce and a spicy sauce).  Although I did try them none of them improved the taste of the brisket and ribs that I was already enjoying.I arrived at 8am with my vegetarian wife who accompanied me for moral support so I would have someone to talk to before the restaurant opened.  We were roughly 10th in line with the first people arriving at 7:30..... yikes!Bring a chair and drinks and maybe something to read.In the 4-6 months since I moved to the south I never developed a taste for brisket. Whenever I did have it, I always found it dry and tough until Franklin's opened my eyes and taste buds to what brisket is supposed to taste like.  The pork ribs were fall off the bone tender and the sausages were soft on the inside and snappy on the outside.Leave your diet outside because there's nothing healthy about this place except maybe the potato salad (which is mustardy but generally nothing special).I've read that the turkey is bathed in juice and butter after carving and just before plating. I think the white bread is for soaking up the grease so you eat it instead of having it drip down your elbow onto the floor but I liked making little sandwhiches with the pickles and onions that is thrown in.Be warned that butcher style meat wrapping paper is used for everything and part of the hole in the wall BBQ atmosphere.I'll come back, but I hope I don't have to wait 3 hrs again."},{"name":"Happy Garden Chinese","address":"377 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"2","text":"Ordered takeout - beef lo mein and steamed dumplings.

Also probably the rudest employees I've encountered, anywhere.I don't know whether these guys have carpal tunnel from the monstrously large  sodas and margaritas they're constantly refilling, or hearing problems from the twangy country soundtrack, or shallow pockets from barhopping college students' skimpy tips, or what.  But don't expect any interaction with them to be pleasant: the host may unceremoniously throw your menus down on the table, the waiter may visibly roll his eyes when you say you may need a few more minutes to finish your meal, the hostess might say \\"I don't know.\\" and then stalk off when you ask how long a wait there is (and this isn't even during their busy hours--expect a line for dinner).This place is probably managed so badly.

Pretty Things Jack d'or on tap means somebody is paying proper attention!Nice, various menu. Our waitress, Jillian, was very, very good and attentive and suggested the salmon dish which I had.

As one of Portland's oldest and most respected culinary institutions, I wouldn't expect less.Thus, expectations are most likely high, as far as the bar goes, for any newcomers or first-timers. Let me emphatically proclaim that as far as fish houses are concerned, this is a smart and final choice.Let me start with happy hour. In no other portion of the city could you order five dollar fresh mussels or five dollar clams in white wine broth. How about a regular Tillamook Cheeseburger for $4? Great food prices during this tiny window. There is a catch, though! You must be able to find a seat in the tiny, crammed bar. Happy hour is not served in the dining room.For lunch they offer a slim gamut of well known options, plus an oft-changing \\"blue plate special\\" menu for lunch. Lunch items are trim but priced economically, running from 9.99 for a cheeseburger to 12.50 for blackened chicken Alfredo or chicken Marsala. Quite the bargain and you won't go home hungry! The Marsala could have been priced doubly for the fresh green beans, mountain of mashed potatoes, plethora of mushrooms and the caliber of its sauce.For dinner many of these options persist, but it is the fresh fish market offerings that are the true star. Don't plan on coming for an entree in the seafood department for less than $25, and in fact ranging up towards $50.If you haven't been here I highly recommend it.

And we were not the first ones lol. Franklin's is one of the best BBQ's in town and everyone knows it's worth the wait. There are even lawn chairs you can borrow, though those run out kinda quickly so we brought our own. We got our food around 11:30am/noon. And it was the loveliest line I've ever had the pleasure of waiting in. Everyone is patient and just happy they got in line in time. At a certain point an employee comes around to ask about how much of each meat you will be purchasing. That way they can cut off the line at some point so people don't wait for nothing. Yes, they run out pretty quickly and close as soon as they sell out. Franklin's was no less than a spiritual experience for me. All you need is the brisket and a few ribs. My sister loved the sauce but I liked it just fine without. Coleslaw and bread help break up the meat a bit and you can make a mighty fine sandwich with them and the meat. Honestly, this stuff melts in your mouth. I'd never had real barbecue until Franklin's. It has ruined the cuisine for me quite honestly.

Both of which tasted great:) \\n   Poured over the menu trying to decide what looked good. Found it a struggle as many items were definitely a unique fusion and I couldn't even begin to imagine what it tasted like. Finally decided on two rolls both of which the names escape me though I'm sorry! They were on he menu in the more adventurous section though. One I liked but was odd, the other was alright but very spicy. I didn't not finish the spicy one. I like spicy btw, not painful ghost pepper whole spicy but I've done it. That roll was up there. \\n  Finished what was possible to and payed the bill. Was a little pricy for what you get I thought but not outrageously so.

You should call and make reservations.  The place was packed on a Tuesday night for us.  The place is in Midtown so parking can be tough.  With our reservations, we got seated fairly quickly.  The place is two stories, but looks like an old house.  So there is a counter/bar to eat at up and down stairs, a few tables up and down stairs as well with the majority of seating is in their covered patio area.  Not being from the South and trying some of the Southern flavors for the first time we decided to order and try a bunch of things.  For starters we tried the Fried Green Tomatoes and the Pork Belly with Kimchi Collards.  The Fried Green Tomatoes were awesome!  Crispy but not greasy, but had almost a flavor of fried pickles but you could taste a little tartness of the green tomato.  The Pork Belly with Kimchi Collards were interesting.  The texture of the Pork Belly through me off a bit with the fat desolving in my mouth.  Texture was a little different to me.  But the kimchi collards were great.  I could have eaten a whole plate of those.  It was flavorful and spicy.  Very good!Next was the She-crab soup.  It was also flavorful and creamy with bits of crabs.  You could also taste the sherry in the soup base.Entrees were Fried Chicken and Shrimp and Grits.  My friend has the Fried Chicken and it was golden brown, not greasy and very tender.  The chicken was juicy and the skin was crunchy.   Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had.  The shrimp and grits were also very good.  It was a gravy sauce with ham and cooked very well.  The shrimp was cooked to perfection and not dry like some places are when they cook shrimp.  Dessert was an apple cobbler pie with ice cream.  It had kind of a pecan topping to it and a great crust. This went down as one of my most memorable meals ever!  We are still talking about this place after being home for 3 days.

I'd seen it before, since we went to a coffee shop nearby. And then, as now, it was pleasantly crowded. Not overcrowded like you can't get in, but clearly a lot of people liked this place. Good sign.Now, I will say that I know next to nothing about tacos, so I don't have all too much to compare with. But our tacos were both incredibly delicious, and I'd definitely go back for more. A huge plus is that my partner is a carnivore, and I lean veggie. It's often hard to find a compromise restaurant where we'll both be happy. But I'd say Tacodeli is a pretty good mix. Their vegetarian selection was pretty extensive, but they also had a lot of different meat options in every variety. I'd say you'd be happy on any part of the meat to veg spectrum.Also, the ingredients tasted extremely fresh, with lots of crunchy lettuce and juicy tomatoes accompanying our tacos. I think they have a pretty high turnaround from the crowd during lunch today, and I'd say with some certainty that you can expect fresh ingredients and freshly cooked food.

I am a HUGE fan of Stubbs BBQ sauce so I thought, damn this is going to be great!!!! Sadly, it wasn't. I order their IPA on tap, wasn't very flavorful but I hadn't had it before and wanted to try it. Brisket, mashed sweet potatoes and potato salad for me while my boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and Mac and cheese. He loved the Mac and cheese but he barely touched the sandwich. Potato salad was almost better than my brisket. It came out cold and was pretty dry. I'm really only giving them 2 stars based on the fact that the staff was very nice. Food wasn't really worth what I spent. But hey at least I tried it. It's a shame to see places like this that lack consistency especially when people (like myself) are just hoping for nothing but at least above average BBQ. Sorry Stubbs.

It is an amalgam of BBQ that wastes perfect brisket and diminishes the religious qualities that appear when consumed on its own.\\nThou shalt order the brisket -- you will be asked \\"lean\\" or \\"fatty\\", which is a really personal choice between you and your maker, but just know that the \\"lean\\" will be juicier and more succulent than any \\"fatty\\" brisket you have eaten anywhere else on planet earth.  And the \\"fatty\\" isn't really so much actual fat but from a lower part of the animal's belly that is not as developed a muscle.  Either will set you free. (I go with 2/3 lean, 1/3 fatty in a 1/2-lb. order)\\nThou shalt have a beer with your meal -- I recommend Austin Beerworks' Pearl Snap or Peacemaker, or Lone Star aka \\"The National Beer of Texas\\"\\nThou shalt overorder.

With that caveat, let me say that I am an avid fan of churrascarias (aka - Brazilian steakhouses), and have eaten at them across the country.  I will say that this place falls solidly right in the middle (hence the three stars).  The value was decent, but the place was nowhere near as good as Fogo de Chao.  Since it's somewhat cheaper, though, I think the value is still there if you're not willing to drop $60 a head at Fogo.  The service was acceptable, not awesome, but it appeared that many of the staff was new.  If I have one real complaint, it's that many of the meats were over-cooked and the staff was not knowledgable enough to know where the medium rare sections were on the individual meats.  Once we said something, we started getting less charred meat and the quality was decent.  The salad bar and other selections were diverse and interesting, very different from other Brazilian places I have been to.I would go back, but only if my party was too cheap to want Fogo de Chao.  This place was worth the money, but not quite a premium dining experience.

I had come across the idea of this place when I was researching Portland urban wineries earlier this year, and had been waiting for their grand opening. Four wineries altogether in one location? All making wine together in a collective? Sign me up! I love when people involved in the local craft community work together. Great minds create some incredible collaborations.The space itself is beautiful, although I imagined something larger. 30 people in here and the place is packed out. Which is a decent size for a tasting room, but with the power of four wineries coming together, they could have made a great space for the community (I'm thinking of you, Enso). That said, great craftsmanship put into the decor, it's a really comfortable space, large windows, welcoming and warm.The Wine, the main reason anyone would be coming here, is great. If you know wine or just a starter, you'll be impressed. Of course pinots are present, but there pinot blancs, gamay noirs, and various other varietals that please the palate. But the pours are dismal! Maybe the glass was too big? Maybe the fact that this is a new place has them worried about money, but $14 bucks for 6 small tastings and a square of chocolate is steep. I wouldn't be surprised if the prices start to drop when they notice people sharing or avoiding the full taster.So order a glass or just taste a couple that catch your eye and you'll be happy.

I got there about fifteen minutes after they opened and didn't have to wait for a seat. When I was leaving, not even an hour later, there was already a crowd waiting. I thought the atmosphere was nice, not too distracting but simple and warm lighting, a nice relax feel. I ordered the Foster burger with bacon added. I was excited to try the fries since they are one of my favorite things to eat. I also ordered the deep fried avocado with endive kimchi and green goddess dressing. The avocado was fantastic! I've never had deep fried avocado so I wasn't sure what to expect, but deep fried can't be all that bad, right? It had just right amount to crunch but you could still see it was an avocado and the kimchi had the right amount of spice and tang. The dressing made it all come together. It made me want to put it on my burger because I loved the combo of the flavors. My burger was done medium well (yes!) and I was very happy with the bun. It was nice and soft but had a lot of give but didn't fall apart in my hands. The house pickles on the burger gave it a nice brightness among all the juicy meat and bitey onion. The fries were perfect! You could tell they were hand cut and they were fried just right, not too greasy or too crunchy. I love that they're seasoned with salt AND pepper. I usually have to add my own pepper but by the time I do, the oil is already cooled and it doesn't stick. Anyways, overall, I can't wait to go back and try the Black and White Fries, a milkshake and one of the other burgers.

I eat at Sarku Japan more often than any other restaurant in Barton Creek Mall, including the fancy Nordstrom's Cafe that serves much better food.  Why?  Because usually when I'm at the mall, I just want to grab something quick so I can finish up my shopping and get the hell out of there.  I like to shop, don't get me wrong - but malls don't hold the same allure for me the way they did when I was a teenager.Sarku is like the fast food version of Benihana.  They have a big, flat grill where you can watch a chef cook your meal.  99.99% of their customers eat the chicken teriyaki, which is their perpetual special of the day (I've been there many, many, many times, and have never seen any other special on the board).  It costs just $5 and they give you a very generous portion with your choice of fried or white rice and a side of stir fried veggies.  For $1 more, you can get double meat.  They have a big bottle of sriracha sauce at the end (Yelper Delicious L. calls this \\"hot cock,\\" which I think is freakin' hilarious) so you can douse your food in spicy goodness.  I highly recommend doing so.They used to have these cute older Asian male chefs who would put on a little show for you while they cooked your meal, banging the spatulas and spice shakers together and chanting loudly, \\"Eaaaaaaaat moorreeeeeeee chicken teriyaki!\\"  The last year or so, they've been replaced by younger Hispanic guys who look like they'd rather die than make fools of themselves that way.

I order a BBQ and Bacon burger.  It was delicious.  It's a smaller, thin patty, but it was a good size and it was won't leave you feeling bloated.  The sweet potato fries were sweet, salty, and piping hot.  My partner had the smash fries, which are with oil and parmesan; they were equally satisfying.  The regular fries, that my sister had, were also good.The shakes were thin, a traditional make shake.  I had a vanilla shake, while my sister had a banana cream shake, and my partner had the salted caramel shake.  All were good, although the banana cream was VERY sweet.The service leaves much to be desired.  We weren't greeted by the cashier, Kentai (not sure if this is the right spelling).  She yelled over the people in front of us and asked, \\"for here or to go?\\"  Since we thought she wasn't talking to us, we ignored her until the silence became awkward.  During the ordering process, we weren't sure how things worked (it was our first time here).  She asked for my burger first, then all 3 of our drinks, then the other two burgers.  After that, she asked if we were all paying together.  My partner asked for butter cream shake, but she said \\"no, that's only a flavor for voting on.\\"They did deliver us the wrong shake.  The lady cleaning the dining room checked on us; she was super nice.  Very accommodating.  But she took the shake back and remade it.  She returned to the table very shy and nervous.  I think she got in trouble for making the wrong shake initially.  I asked her after, and she said, \\"shhh, I don't want to get in trouble.\\"  That was not my intention at all; I'm actually more concerned her boss is not very forgiving.  Especially because she was genuinely nice, the only one that seemed to be.I will give this place another try, but I think at another location.

These guys are busting their ass to serve everyone so be patient!The food - I was impressed, I used to live in the south so I am very used to good southern food and they didn't disappoint. We had a couple of appetizers, fried okra and pimento cheese.The fried okra had a corn meal breading with a bit or horse radish kick. The horse radish was a neat twist on an old classic and pretty tasty. I think that they were a little heavy handed with the breading though. I suspect they are batter dipped instead of dusted per usual so it probably can't be avoided.The pimento cheese was strong and sharp just the way it is supposed to be. The sesame crackers they serve it with are really really good. This is a great appetizer!My wife had a pecan crusted trout served with creamed spinach and roasted root veggies. Wow - truly amazing trout and I'm not a big fish fan but they worked magic. The creamed spinach was probably the best I have ever had. I would love to have the recipe, I would make it weekly. The root veggies were roasted perfectly fork tender and were left unmolested so that you could taste them.I had the buttermilk fried chicken with mashed potatoes. The chicken was incredibly tender, I don't know how they get it so tender. The crust on the chicken was super crispy and tasty. They really cooked it perfectly. The mashed potatoes were really nice and creamy. The greens that came with my meal were absolutely perfect too. They were cooked and seasoned exactly the way they should be.We sat out on the heated patio which was still a little chilly but fine. We ordered coffee and our cups were never empty.The service is absolutely amazing seeing how busy this place is. Definitely go here to eat.

Only issue, the bread was quite soggy when we ate the stew, wished they had kept the bread on the side\\n(4) bread basket (comes with all orders)- had their cornbread and biscuits with butter and an apple jam.

First of all I found the table height way too high for myself and the only thing to order my son was the poutine with everything on the side. The dishes were all share plates so they were small and fancy.  I had the crab ravioli which were 4 medium sized pieces for $15.  Definitely some great flavours, but it was not cooked to perfection, too al dente.  The cabbage salad on top was refreshing and tasty.  I was tempted to try the Naniamo bar dessert, but didn't feel like staying any longer. The service was good and the place was busy.

Service is fast and efficient without being untidy or unfriendly. Our cheerful waitress filled my water and coffee were filled whenever it went past the halfway point.

The Hollandaise was ice cold as was the friend green tomato.  I do understand that breakfast is difficult to serve hot but this wasn't even close.  They were very apologetic and within a few minutes served one that was fresh and warm.  Although it tasted fine, it needed seasoning and didn't have a special taste to rave about.  My friend had a dish with the chive grits and they were absolutely delicious but again, the rest of the breakfast dish was tasty but nothing to make a long drive or go out of your way for.  The Orange Blossom sweet tea was delicious and it was a bonus you could receive free refills.  The one major downfall, in my opinion, is family style seating.

This time, we shared the following:\\nPraline bacon waffle ($9.50): this was as delicious as it was the first time. The waffle is light and fluffy, and is covered in ample whipped cream and maple syrup. The chopped pralines added a delicious crunch and sweetness, and the thick-cut slice of bacon covered in chopped pralines and caramelized in brown sugar was pure crunchy, salty, umami perfection. The best waffle I have had in my life!\\nBananas foster French toast ($8.25): this was delicious as well, although not as much of a standout as the bacon praline waffle. There were two large thick-cut brioche slices that had been soaked in vanilla custard and grilled to golden brown perfection.

A friend had purchased a GiltCity offer, which was good for a credit of $60.The menu consists of appetizers, salads, pastas, pizzas and main entrees, specializing in Italian type fare.  We opted to get a grilled octopus appetizer to share and each got our own entrees, including: Rigatoni Alla Bolognese (Pork, beef and veal, homemade meat sauce, $19), Steak Frites (8oz Prime skirt steak, porcini butter, b√©arnaise, French fries, $28), Brasied Shortrib (Comes with whipped potatoes which we subbed out for truffle fries with no additional cost, seasonal vegetable, crispy onion, $32), and Smoked Salmon Pizza (Smoked salmon, truffle cream, goat cheese, capers, truffle oil, $22).The food came out in pretty decently sized portions.  The grilled octopus appetizer came served over a type of grain similar to millet and was just ok.  Bolognese, tasty but standard, nothing special.  The steak from the steak frites wasn't special in flavor and the bearnaise sauce didn't add much definition to the dish.  The short ribs were cooked perfectly but definitely could have used a sauce. The subbed truffle fries were probably the highlight out of everything we tried.  The smoked salmon pizza was also a pretty yummy but I don't think it is good enough to be worth $22.Overall, flavors were just ok; the high price tags did not make the food feel worth it.

Well, after last night's fiasco I don't believe we will ever return. We arrived around 9:15 were promptly seated. Chips and salsa were immediately brought. Our server came took our drink and appetizer order. Then before she had even gotten our drinks she's back asking if we're ready to order. No mam...we are not. While waiting on drinks I got a work related call...only lasted about 45 seconds.. she sets drinks down right before I'm about to hang up. Are you ready to order yet? No mam..sorry..I have not had a moment to look over the menu yet. We will need one more minute please.  She says ok. Then does not return for about 7 minutes. She comes back and takes our order and leaves while neglecting to refill either of our drinks that are empty. Food comes very quickly...I ordered a plate with a fish taco 2 shrimp enchiladas and rice and beans. Well I devoured the taco..it was awesome. The I start in on the enchiladas. I take a bite along with some rice and beans...it tasted meh, but just like all enchiladas there is not much filling in the ends. So I take another bite...with rice and bean...it's tasted off. So now I've reached the middle..the part with the most filling...I take a bite..on its own and it hits me...that funny shrimp taste. Nope...no more of this so I push the plate away. Did I say the server still had not returned? So here I am waiting....10 more minutes pass and she returns. I tell her the shrimp tastes funny. I'm not going to eat it . Please just bring me 2 steak tacos instead,  but to go. Since my roomate was done eating and ready to go. She looks at me like I'm crazy and like she's appalled and confused. She takes it away and about 5 minutes later this snarky little manager waddles over and asks me how everything was. (like he didn't already know) I go thru the whole thing with him and he starts in about. I saw your plate and you ate this much of the food..blah blah blah. I respond with yeah..I know..I ate the taco and half an enchilada because it took me 3 bites to really get a good taste of the shrimp. That's why I'm only asking for 2 tacos and rice and beans....  he says...oh you want rice and beans too..you ate this much of that(I'm the most condescending tone ever, while moving around in an irritated fashion), but it's no big deal to me ... That's when I lost it. I don't care how much I ate...all I'm asking is to replace what I didn't eat with an appropriate amount of food. 2 tacos and rice and beans. Don't sit here and try and make me it out like I'm trying to get one over on you. Are you kidding me? I laid into him... I asked him if it didn't matter then why do you keep bringing it up? He just keeps being snarky and says I'll just take it all off!!! Oh yea? That's not what I wanted, but I won't argue with you anymore.

I would say if you want to have a relaxing brunch where you can sit, enjoy your food, and talk then this is not the place for you. They simply can't accommodate the amount of guests they have but they keep selling the meals regardless of the lack of space.

Unfortunately, my experience didn't live up to the hype. Having said that, I tried to go a little easy with my judgment of this place since I figured it'd be hard to topple it off of the high pedestal it had been placed upon.I'll start by saying the cocktail I ordered tasted like it was top shelf liquor despite the fact that I ordered a well drink. Plus, it was a good pour, so no complaints there.I always enjoy a place that uses really tacky tchotchkes in order to let the customers know, \\"Hey.....we're not taking ourselves too seriously, so relax\\", and Dirty Franks has its walls covered in it- rock n' roll-style. The place is very small and was crowded and noisy when I went, which made it really hard to carry on a conversation. I could live with that, but since both customers and wait staff were constantly bumping into the back of my chair it got a bit annoying.Onto the food. My friend and I both ordered 3 hot dogs (yes, we're pigs) and a side dish. The dog nick-named \\"The Nicola\\", which was a Greek-inspired dog, had Tzatziki sauce, cucumbers tomatoes and onions. It was very good. Nothing spectacular.....but for $3 it was a really good deal. The other 2 dogs I had were okay, but very forgettable. Both my friend and I felt the same way about 4 of the 6 dogs we ordered: They could be made at home with simple ingredients most people have lying around in their kitchen. As far as sides dishes go, my friend ordered the Boston Baked Beans and said they tasted like regular Bush's baked beans (not actual Boston-style baked beans) that had been spruced up with onions and cheese. I got the mac and cheese, which I thought was okay, but didn't taste homemade. FINAL VERDICT:\\nI'm giving Dirty Frank's 3 stars instead of 2 simply because their prices are really hard to beat, and they seem to pour a good drink. The not-so-serious stuff on the wall lets you know it's not going to be a 5-star restaurant, and I can admire that. I think this place would be great to stop by for a late night snack after having a few drinks out at the bars, but I'd rethink going back for just a regular dinner."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Portland is the land of brunch spots and boy, did this place blow me away.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I have heard of Fox Bros., but had never been until today when a couple of colleagues suggested it as a great place with a nice big patio where we could enjoy the first breezy, relatively cool day after a blistering August. The smoky essence in the parking lot promised tastiness and the kitchen delivered. The fried dill pickles were a delight, with a buttermilk batter and a dry rub sprinkle to add a little seasoning but not too much salt, were crisp and not greasy at all.  We got a 1/2 order of the Tomminator - fried tater tots topped with chunky Brunswick stew and shredded cheese. Sounds crazy, but it was great. I would not recommend a full order for a table smaller than 10 people, but for a table of 7, a half order gave us just enough to savor. A definite guilty pleasure. \\nSince this was lunch I settled on the rib sandwich, four on the bone ribs over white bread, with a side of collards, but I was sorely tempted by one of the specials - The Fox Bros. Burger, sliced barbecued beef brisket with pimento cheese and mayo on a roll. A colleague who ordered it could only eat half, but pronounced it delicious. \\nMy ribs were the perfect portion for lunch and were meaty, smoky, mildly spicy awesomeness. Tender, flavorful, not a bit dry or chewy. I almost wished I'd ordered the half-rack, but I would have been worse for the wear at work after. The sauce is a little thinner than some of the sweeter, more ketchup-y versions I've had elsewhere, but was a nice blend of spicy with a hint of vinegar and sweetness. The collards were a little \\"al dente\\" for my taste and could have used a little more seasoning--maybe a lovely smoked bone in the broth from one of their smoked butts. A gifted onion ring from a friends plate was crisp and tender at the same time, with a nice beer bite to the batter.\\nDespite full tummies we opted for two dishes of banana pudding to pass around the table. I didn't expect much because I'm not much of a banana pudding fan, but I had 3 spoonfuls and would have happily eaten a whole one by myself! Thick and creamy with sprinkling of crushed vanilla wafers on the top and none of the sliminess that can accompany waterier versions, I would recommend taking some of your entree home to leave room for this dessert.\\nA bit on the pricey side, but they will give separate checks with no hassles, right down to splitting the appetizers and desserts seven ways. \\nChase, who I am guessing is one of the owner/chefs, came out to check on us a stayed to chat for a moment about the fine art of pickle frying.

Although we did have a reservation, I'm not sure it was needed because the inside was relatively empty. We ordered the calamari and garlic edamame for appetizers. Both were generous portions and very tasty. We ordered the rainbow roll and the lobster shrimp roll for entrees but I wouldn't brag about the taste of either. The rainbow roll came immediately after our appetizers so it just sat there until our other roll arrived. Timing of food delivery could definitely use some work. I came here a few months ago with a large group of friends when RA first opened and getting seated was a nightmare, even with a reservation- so it seems like they've definitely improved since then.

Take another look folks, because the new and improved downtown Columbus is not dead.  As Dr. Frankenstein would say, it's alive!  Alive!  ALIVE!  Buahaha-hahaaaa!Case in point: The Commons.  How an old chunk of grass, a stage and some chairs became a social and cultural mecca I'll never know, but it did.  That old grass became hip, trendy, and populated with residents.  Yes, hang onto your hats: people are now living in downtown Columbus.  Not just old money people, but yuppies, Gen Xers, and millenials.  Lots and lots of millenials.  At long last, the buildings which surrounded this hip grass were being filled with retail, and plenty of it. One of those results: Condado Tacos.Simply put, Condado is to Mexican fast food what Melt is to grilled cheese, only without the hipster attitude and long waits.  (Sorry, Melt, but it's true.)  When you are seated, you are greeted by a variety of order forms at your table.  Anyone who has ever faxed in a Chipotle or Subway order will immediately be familiar with the drill: pick your taco style, your protein, toppings and sauces.  It's a lot of choices to take in for a first-timer, so if you don't like making such crucial life decisions under the gun, you can do what I did and download the order form from their website ahead of time and take your time in the comfort of your own, uh, cubicle.  I went the conservative route: two flour tortillas with roasted chicken, onions, tomatoes, salsa verde and chimichurri sauce, with a side of black beans.I met my sister and father there for lunch at noon, but in spite of the rush our orders were turned around quickly.  My soft tacos were modestly sized and dribbled a lot, thanks to my choice of liquidy toppings.  (Word to the wise: real estate is limited, so don't overload just because you can.  It's messy and the flavors easily drown each other out) In spite of the minor flooding, my order was very flavorful, and the fresh factor was off the charts.  The downsides were few.  The joint was loud, partly because of lunch rush, partly because of bare painted walls echoing every bit of conversation.  Price was okay; I think my party of three escaped with a check of about $10 apiece.  Portions are a bit small by American stuff-your-face standards, so don't expect 'supersize me' Chipotle style orders.  If you're really hungry, you might want to go with three tacos instead of two, but remember, Mexican food is starchy, and my two were deceptively satisfying.  I have never been to the South Campus/Short North location, but according to Jessica D., this location is a bit roomier with faster service.All in all, Condado is yet another reason to park yourself in Downtown CBus and give it a second look.  Then a third. There's a lot of old gems complimenting the new ones like Condado to create a whole new atmosphere in this old town of mine.  Thanks for that, hip grass."},{"name":"The Squealing Pig","address":"134 Smith St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"a friend of mine just moved to mission hill and lives near this irish style pub. i am glad, because other wise, i never would have know about the amazing beer selection and tasty pressed cheddar and tomato sandwich this place has to offer. i've heard the term gastropub thrown around a lot lately to describe bars serving good food - this place fits the bill."},{"name":"Fazenda Cafe","address":"3710 Washington St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"Fazenda has become our weekend treat.

The chicken pot pie LOOKS massive, but as soon as you stab a hole through the top, the whole thing deflates and it becomes this sad looking....caved-in pie. So given that more than half of its original size is completely EMPTY, I definitely didn't think it was worth $10. The inside of the pot pie was alright, nothing special. For me, there wasn't enough crust to balance out the soupy inside. But with this dish, overall, I just felt cheated. My heart sank almost as fast as the pot pie deflated. The gooseberry tart wasn't good either. I had no idea what a gooseberry was until then. The berries themselves were alright, but the crust was severely lacking in flavor. It just tasted like sugar. The custard topping holding the berries to the crust was okay, and if you eat it with the crust, the combination isn't bad. But overall, this was pretty meh.

Next time I will request it on a biscuit instead, because frankly the english muffin seems too... pedestrian for this meal.I tried bites of the chicken and waffles, the praline bacon, and their country gravy and biscuits.

This is the second location they have been in, in that time period. They were first in a small strip when you first enter Poinciana which is sort of not there anymore and now for the last couple of years in the Publx shopping center down the road. This is a family owned business. The restaurant has counter service and a few tables to sit at with waitress service and delivery service. Nice murals painted on the walls and of course the red and white checker board tablecloths. There antipasti salad is stocked to the bream with meats and cheese such as salami, cappicola, mozzarella and provolone. The grilled chicken breast salad is seasoned just right. The greek salad is amazing. Insane amount of feta cheese and black olives. Great dressing. The best item they have are the chicken wings. Either breaded or not the taste and array of sauces are point on. They do not skimp on the toppings on their pizza or in their calzones. Worth the money and the trip.

If everything else is as good as the torta, it's a winner.They need to work on details, though. When I was there, the soft drink machine wasn't working, although there were canned drinks in a refrigerator. Unfortunately, the refrigerator wasn't working right, either, so the drinks were barely cool. I asked if I could get a cup of ice, and was told they didn't have ice.

Upon entering, you're surrounded by cool and modern pieces of furniture and decor with a sleek ice cream counter just a few steps away. The two counters are split for vegan/non-dairy flavors and the other side containing dairy products. The flavors rotate everyday except for the Speculoos (cookie butter) and ash coconut ice cream. They have a huge variety of unique flavors that you can't find anywhere else that range from Asian inspired flavors, floral flavors, and decadent ones. The price for one cone is pretty hefty with a single scoop being about $4.50, with an additional scoop for an extra $1.00, a cone for $1.00, and each topping for $0.75. So it's definitely pricey cream. I decided to get one scoop of ube ice cream and the lavender earl grey one with an ash vanilla cone and some hibiscus sugar sprinkles which came out to be a little over $7. It's the most I've ever spent on one ice cream cone and I don't think it was worth it. The ice cream itself tasted great since we got to sample them prior to purchase but the cone had a hole in the bottom and it's almost impossible to eat the ice cream fast enough before you become a dripping mess. Also, the ice cream was a little too \\"soft\\" for my preference and lacked the cool, refreshing feeling you get with a lick on a hot Florida's summer day. All in all, the place is great if you want cute ice cream pictures and I'd opt for just getting the ice cream in a regular cup to make it worth your while."},{"name":"Jimoco Cafe & Pasta","address":"1046 Austin Avenue, Suite A","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"4","text":"The best pasta in coquitlam by far!

Definitely the best American barbecue I've ever had.I am an extremely picky eater and barbecue sauce is one of the things that I really don't like. I've lived in the south for many years and despite all my efforts to get into pulled pork and ribs, I was just never a fan. That is, until I had the barbecue from Franklin's.Their barbecue relies on a dry spice rub (I've heard that their famous brisket is seasoned only with salt and pepper), which is amazing for people like me who dislike barbecue style. It was my first experience with this style of barbecue, but one bite and I was a believer!! I seriously can't recommend their food enough.So as far as logistics go, I read a lot on yelp about long waits going up to 3-4 hours, even on a weekday. My friend and I were planning to hit up Franklin's on the day we were flying out from Austin, and since our flight was in the afternoon, we didn't want to risk waiting in line.Luckily, as we were browsing their website, we noticed an option to order in advance online for takeout. SCORE! Sure, you have to order a minimum of 5 pounds and the prices per pound are a little bit higher than the sit-down prices, but to me, it was absolutely worth the convenience and lack of a wait. If you want to go with this option, I would recommend placing your order online well in advance to be safe. They have different time slots you can pick up the meat, and we opted for the earliest time slot of 10:30 am (which is actually before they open!). You have to pay a $75 deposit when you order and then pay the rest when you pick up. On the day of, everything went super smoothly. We got there around 10:40 and they started slicing our meat fresh in front of us. Everything came in well wrapped packages so that the grease from the meat did not leak through, and in addition to the meat we ordered, they gave us a couple containers of barbecue sauce and bread.We ate as much as we could back at our Airbnb, and then packed the leftovers up to bring back to SF. The meat survived our 5 hour flight very well and I was still happily munching on leftover brisket for the next couple days at work. Definitely consider this option if you're in Austin for a quick trip and want to bring home some delicious barbecue to share (or not)!We ordered:\\n2 pound brisket\\n1 pound pork ribs\\n1 pound pulled pork\\n1 pound sausageMy favorites were the ribs, followed closely by the brisket. I can't do the food here enough justice with anything I could possibly write, it was that good. Everything was very well flavored with the simple spices they use, and the ribs were the most tender fall-off-the-bone ribs I've ever had.If you have a smaller stomach and only want to try a small selection, definitely go for the brisket and ribs. The pulled pork and sausage were both delicious but not as mindblowingly good as the other two. Parking is kind of a pain, as they only have a small lot. We were able to park in their quick 20 minute takeout spot (they have two) but otherwise we might have had to circle around a bit to find parking."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Great dinner/food and atmosphere.

The long lineup was a bit of a turnoff at first, but the wait turned out to be worth every second of it.Seated next to the kitchen, my friends and I were able to witness all the chefs hard at work and perfecting every single dish that leaves. What astonished us Canadians the most were the massive portions that were being plated. I'm not talking about a meal fit for a king. Rather, a meal fit for three kings!It'll be difficult for me to list all the dishes we ordered, but I highly recommend ordering their beer battered chicken (an apparent signature dish), the fried catfish, anything with their bacon mashed potatoes, cornbread, and (if you dare attempt) their burger. I, myself, ordered the pork loin daily special with seasonal vegetables, mashed potatoes, salsa, and some other items of delicious. For the amount of food we were presented with by our sociable and friendly server, we'd expected ourselves to pay at least $30 per person. Guess what? It was more along the lines of $14 (excluding tip)! Yes, there is no tax in Oregon.Screen Door had me thinking about their food and somehow integrating my visit in several conversations for days, even weeks after my dining experience. If only they were open on Labor Day because I prepped my stomach for a lunch feast.Cheap, delicious food, massive portions, a friendly, vibrant atmosphere, and staff that are on their toes and willing to answer all your questions easily earns Screen Door a 5-star review."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Wow by far the best ribs I've ever had in my life.

It was pretty clean and they got us water right away.My husband got the hot link po boy and roasted potatoes which came with ketchup. He loved it, and the potatoes were very flavorful. I got the famous chicken and waffles. It comes in three sizes, a single, double or the full-size--the single is definitely enough food but I got the double that came with 2 pieces of chicken to share with him. The chicken was just ok, it had obviously been cooked a little while ago so it was kind of soggy and the breading is way too peppery for my taste. The waffle, however, made the whole wait worthwhile. It is a sweet potato waffle and it was incredible, I can't even describe how good it was except to say that thinking about it right now is making my mouth water. I didn't need the chicken at all but would love to go back and get just a stack of 2 or 3 waffles.

This night was no exception. Some asshole had parked over the only line left in the lot, leaving no room, so we had to circle a few times before something opened up. Inside, crowded and tight, and dark, really dark, we waited a good 15mins before a table became available. Said table was right in the middle of the main room, so we were constantly brushed by everyone inside. That degraded the mood quickly for me, I don't mind a busy place as long as I'm not the center of it. Menus is simple, easy to read, beer selection is so-so but I would have preferred more. They had Fat Tire but were out of it, so I got a Stella. The server was polite, efficient (not quick, but not bad), and helpful. Our food came out in a reasonable time, it all looked nice but was just average tasting, I liked it but I didn't get excited about it, and won't rave about it now. Pretty average as far as what I've had, but with BBQ it's typically either great of horrid, so this is a win for them as it's not horrid. Would I go back?

And the beans that they were pushing we weren't wanting. Apparently these spicy garlic beans are their specialty. Special enough that I have read of them by scribbles on their sandwich board outside. Now reading their description I was not sold. Chilled green beans seasoned in a hoisin sauce glaze with sesame oil, garlic, and lime. It is just beans in sauces. For $8 a conservative plate I could buy all the ingredients and make enough for the week. But I can see the appeal. A healthy snack that is salty and fun to eat. Say, a Western answer to the Japanese edamame. The menu has your usual bar fare: wings, burgers, and fries.

The food is to die for, it's some of the best food I've eaten or will ever eat.  And the guys that work there are super friendly, really helpful, make sure you get plenty of food and then some, and they work hard to make sure you're happy and will happily hand out samples.They open at 11, and I'd recommend getting there at 10:30 as a line forms.  And avoid going on game days, as people get there very early and order massive to go orders, causing them to sell out by 11:30.  And avoid going when it's hot, waiting in line for an hour when it's 100 degrees out with no water outside isn't fun.  It wasn't fun for the girl in front of me who had heatstroke and I thought she was going to die and the paramedics had to come and help her.  It wasn't fun for my brother either who was visiting, sweating profusely, and thought he was next.  So if you get there early, avoid game days, and avoid really hot days, and are prepared to wait if necessary, get ready for some of the best food you'll ever eat.

If you arrive early your first time they will let you step inside and let you watch them make the pizza and how everything works- and there are a few places to sit- but it will be crowded.  They only do pizza, you have to go to the carry out attached to get drinks if you plan on eating there.  It is a fun place and as far as I know its $10 a pizza, or 3 for $25.

This is a 3.5 for me for sure. I've always had a good time here, but I've never been blown away, and there are a couple of little things that bother me. We arrived at 6pm on a Wednesday and it was already completely full, apart from bar seats. Alice S and I were happy with spots at the kitchen bar where we could observe all the food being made - both of us had been once before and sat in the same spot! We had lots of catching up to do so we were chattering away a couple of times when our server came by to take our order. We grabbed a couple of happy hour wines - the \\"glass of white\\" was actually rose that day, but it was tasty! A very nice balance of dryness and a touch of sweet.Once we were ready to order our server did seem to disappear for quite some time, but I can't blame her as we had taken our time until that point. Alice ordered the tuna ceviche, I got four meat tacos, and we splurged on the guacamole; $9 seemed pretty crazy to me for guac, but we thought we'd give it a shot. Our food took quite a long time to arrive, and unfortunately it all came at once - I was really hoping to nibble on the guac before my tacos arrived. I saw other people's food arriving more spaced out, but ours was clustered. That said, the guacamole was truly excellent - perfectly acidic, smooth, great texture, and the avocado was very fresh.My tacos were good, but quite small portions. $11.50 is a good price for 4 tacos, each with two soft corn tortillas, but the filling was no more than a tablespoon for most of them. The flavours were good, and I liked that the server who delivered them told me which was which. One sadness was at 6.27(ish) we flagged our server to try and quickly grab a glass of wine before happy hour ended, but unfortunately she was busy and didn't come by until 6.40, at which time she said happy hour was over so no happy hour wine price. It would have been nice to have a little leniency, but it wasn't a huge deal.The decor is gorgeous here, and the open kitchen is great entertainment. The servers are friendly, but always very busy.

However, there was something not-right about how fast these plates came out, ice-cream scoops of sides and luke-warm meat. I was expecting deliciousness, and was greeted with super-fatty ribs and super-fatty sausage. Sure, they were pork ribs, but I'd like at least a couple bites of meat off the bone in between all that ... not meat. The fried okra was ok - a bit soggy, probably from sitting in the kitchen, the mashed potatoes standard, my cheesy serrano spinach was almost too spicy to really enjoy (and I LOVE spicy) but this was just too hot, not enough flavor.

Even had a relative ask for the chicken recipe. It was THAT good. The cost was reasonable as well.  If you are planning an event I absolutely recommend No Mas Cantina. They are so nice and helpful and were that way throughout the entire event (which is a pretty big deal given the 60+ people we had all having a different need at the same time :).  They handled it all with good natured grace and impressive patience.

Today was the day I decided to finally stop into this cute, tucked away neighborhood spot for brunch. I was pleasantly surprised by the two dishes I tried. First, I ordered the red quinoa/eggs/broccoli. At first glance, this dish looked very simple and I was a little concerned with my choice, but the flavors and texture were superb! The broccoli was perfectly charred and paired perfectly with the creamy, flavorful eggs. I finished my brunch with the caramelized pineapple and almond cake topped with maple, coconut butter...and oh my god!!!! It was perfect! It was a fluffy slice of heaven with chunks of fresh fruit in the moist, dense pancake middle. This doughy center was perfectly balanced by the crispy edges from being baked in a cast iron skillet! Overall, 5/5!!!"},{"name":"The French Table Bistro","address":"3916 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Classic French cooking, perfectly done, serviced on lovely plates.

Awesome. The food was okay. The best part was the grilled avocado. That was tasty. My fish tacos (heh) were very fishy, the strongest swordfish I've ever had, which is to say, not the freshest swordfish I've ever had. Enough hot sauce covers that up.... Chips chips and salsa were plentiful and apparently the margaritas were good. Our waiter was... kind of brusque not very attentive and while he brought things out quickly and drinks were refilled appropriately had kind of an attitude. Our party of 8, or was it 9, was slapped with an automatic 18% gratuity. Which kind of sucks for the waiter, he would have gotten more if he'd been able to split the bill which his manager wouldn't let him do.Anyway, sub par food, decent drinks, plentiful chips and salsa, and acceptable waitstaff. A good place to get drunk, but the food leaves a lot to be desired. Except for that grilled avocado.Oh and when you call in advance to reserve a table, you get the run around and hung up on.

I came to Alden & Harlow specifically to try their Secret Burger, but since I wasn't able to get here until 7:45pm on a Wednesday, they were already sold out. I tried to ask the hostess if one could be reserved, but apparently they don't do that. I guess I shouldn't be surprised because it keeps the allure of the restaurant high. Alden & Harlow can be a bit difficult to find since the signage is on the side, and they are below street level so you have to keep an eye on the street numbers to make sure you walk down the flight of stairs. This is one of the most hipster-ish restaurants I've been to in a while- the inside is super dim, and the upper half of one of the seating areas is made up of living plants (novel idea, but being poked in the head by a long vine and/or having dirt fall on your clothing during dinner kind of sucks). My colleague and I were seated when we arrived (we made reservations ahead of time), and we tried:-Complimentary Pickled Green Beans (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alden-and-harlow-cambridge?select=-cxKP1qaAngkg5beafGjXw#-cxKP1qaAngkg5beafGjXw): Yikes, this was super vinegary, and too sour for my liking. My coworker liked it a lot more than I did.\\n-Crispy Berkshire Pork Belly (Blistered Grape Agro Dolce, Anson Mills Grits, $15): Pretty good, and a solid pork belly dish, but not so amazing that I would definitely have to order it again. It was a good but not super memorable dish.\\n-Grilled Spanish Mackerel (Celery Root Remoulade, Pickled Green Tomatoes, $17): Again, good, but not amazing, and not that memorable. I wouldn't order this again.\\n-Charred Broccoli (Butternut Squash Hummus, Bianco Sardo, Cashew, $13): I liked the charred broccoli, but the butternut squash hummus was strange, and way too sweet. I thought the ingredients in this dish were fighting against each other, and there's too much going on- skip!\\n-Pickled Verrill Farm Corn Pancakes (Buttermilk, Maple, Shishitos, $13): I loved this dish, and it was my favorite of the night. The pancakes had a wonderful sweetness from the corn, and the shishitos were blistered perfectly. I also loved the addition of popcorn- I think I could've eaten 3 plates of this on my own- a must order!\\n-Chicken Fried Local Rabbit (Celery, Apple, Blue Cheese, Chili Oil, $15): Better than I expected, but I didn't like the addition of blue cheese, which overpowered a lot of the other flavors. The chicken fried rabbit was cooked well though, and was nice and crispy.\\n-Buttermilk & Lemon Pound Cake (Torched Blackberry Compote, Almond Whip, $9): Pretty good, but not quite amazing. However, it was a good end to an otherwise uneven dinner. Our server was friendly and nice enough, but we didn't like most of her recommendations- maybe we just have really different palates. However, she was nice enough to remove the charred broccoli from our bill since it was very obvious that we weren't fans of the dish. Overall, I thought the restaurant was overhyped, and I'm not sure if I would come back again. I'm torn between really wanting to try the much raved about Secret Burger (and to get the corn pancakes again), but I feel like I would probably leave disappointed. The dishes were on the pricier side for the portions, and the traffic and parking around this area can be quite challenging (however, there is some street parking available a couple blocks away).

As soon as they would bring out a tray it would be gone because there would be a line of people waking.  Had to ask he waiter twice for more water and none of the waiters/waitress seemed to have a clue.  They have been open long enough to have had time to iron out the bugs.

If it was just the food, I would've broken this rating and given it six stars. However, there are a few drawbacks. So I guess I'll start off with the bad news.The bad news is, if it's a hot day, you'll have second thoughts about wanting to eat here. You wait outside in line for a table to open up/wait for those ordering to get their orders in at the front before being seated. Then, once you're inside, the rather small cramped area makes you feel like you're being rushed as people eye your table.Now, for the good news. Once you get your order in, you sit and wait for about 10 minutes, which is really not a long wait. You get your ramen, and enjoy. The eyes of those in line disappeared as I ate my ramen. It was delicious, not too salty, not too thick either. I had the mi-so-not, while my gf had the Tonkotsu original. I tasted both and found both of them to be good first choices. We also had the edamame on the side with what looked like sea salt.

The tomatoes were also so over ripe, that they had almost no texture. And it was a little off putting that the waitress seemed to be scowling and dismissive specifically to our table.

I hadn't done a whole lot of research so I expected a cajun/gumbo shack style restaurant.  Boy, was I wrong! Instead, the wife and I walked into a place that was very swanky and reminded me of the typical steakhouse environment - sans leather booths.  I don't know what it is, but usually if a restaurant has someone's first name on it you expect it to be casual.  Our server was very understanding and she stated that back over a 100 years ago when Jake's first started out, it was one of those places, and now it has transformed into a high quality seafood place.  Currently owned by Landry's it was previously owned by McCormick and Schmick and was their flagship restaurant.  Crawfish is still served, but only as a tradition when it is in season.But enough of the history, and on to the food.  The selection of fresh seafood and oysters are incredible here.  The fact that they also have escargot attests to how old school they are. We started off with a dungeness crab Louie salad, which is a total misnomer.  It has a huge amount of crab in it (hence the $30 price tag) and almost no \\"salad\\".  I know it makes some people cringe to just think about the fact that Louie salads usually employ a good deal of Thousand Island dressing.  But in this case, it did not overpower the delicate meat of the crab.  It was one of the best crab Louie salads that I had ever had.  There was enough crab meat to split between two people.  My wife ordered the oven roasted stuffed pacific salmon and it was fantastic.  Stuffed with Dungeness crab, bay shrimp, brie and some dill beurre blanc, it was perfectly prepared.  The salmon was so soft and fresh it was melt-in-your-mouth.  I have been to other restaurants that serve a nationally acclaimed stuffed fish, such as Mama Fish House in Maui, and usually the dish ends up being overcooked and heavy.  Not this one, the brie cheese added a dimension of richness while keeping the dish relatively light.  I had Jake's etoufee which was pretty decent.  The sauce was nice and nutty, what you would expect from a well-prepared roux.  The crawfish, however, was a bit strong and overcooked, probably because it was previously frozen and not in season.Overall, Jake's is a great place to go for fresh well-prepared seafood with a killer selection."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"it was Thursday night and my friend and I weren't really sure where to go eat, especially since Columbus doesn't have that many places open at this time, he suggested we go to this place, when he first told me the name of the place,naturally I wasn't very excited, but he kept talking about it that I finally gave in.\\nNow have in mind I'm not really a hotdog guy, and when I first went there I was surprised how many options you get with just a hotdog, anyways I ended up ordering two kinds and for the appetizer we got the nachos with meat and cheese.

This restaurant needs editing, in just about every realm. Someone to say \\"nope, take one thing off, you've gone too far here\\" and \\"yes, this is where you shine. More of this!\\" There wasn't enough of the good, and there was a lot of blown potential because it was overly complicated. First the good: The pasta! We had an excellent home made parsley bigoni with lobster mushrooms. (We left the bacon off because I don't eat pork, and while perhaps it's good with the bacon, the dish didn't feel incomplete without it.) It was phenomenal, and if I lived in Harvard square I'd go back early on a weekday for this dish and a glass of wine at the bar. I think it's a seasonal dish, so get it while the gettin's good. The middling: most of our food, and our service, was middling. \\n- The shishito peppers were nicely charred and I loved the haloumi pairing (seriously, I'm going to make that at home), but they should've stopped there. No pickled eggplant, no drenching in sauce. \\n- The broccoli pieces were too big to be as crisp/undercooked as they were. Smaller bites, or more moisture when you cook them. The cashew and hummus situation also needed to be dialed back a few notches. \\n- Fried quail - great crunch on the batter, but the batter to meat ratio was way tilted toward batter. It was hard to find the quail. We did NOT love the creamed corn; it tasted like it had been made with sweetened condensed milk, with so much sweetness that it obscured the natural sweet of the corn. Seriously, edit. This dish wasn't bad, but it didn't wow us. Drinks and service: \\nMiddling, again. Took forever to get our first drinks, and we watched as people who arrived at the bar after we put our orders in got their cocktails first. One out of two cocktails we ordered was good (Lowland Heat), but the second (Paper Mache) had a very unpleasant bitter finish. I had my spouse try it, because she generally likes more bitter flavor profiles than I do, and she didn't like it either. I'm inclined to think something was off in the execution. Martini was fine - hard to seriously screw up a martini - and the glass of wine my spouse ordered (based on the server's rec) was excellent. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable, but she walked past us 3 or 4 times while we waited for our drinks without saying anything, until on the 5th pass I flagged her down and politely asked about them. From then on she was super on it, but I don't think I should've needed to say anything. I was also confused they didn't bring the pre-meal pickled beans to snack on while we waited for our drinks. They may have been understaffed, so I don't want to put it all on our server, but after 2 years of operation they should know what they need for a Saturday night.The bad: \\nThe lamb breast was inedible, unless you really like scraping the fat off of the top of a roast and eating it. Lamb breast, like pork belly, needs to be cooked down so the fat can render and leave you with incredibly juicy flavorful meat. Unfortunately, we were basically just served slabs of fat, with no meat to be found. We had 2 bites and couldn't eat any more. The accompaniment was also bizarre - grilled sunflower, which didn't taste like much except chewy and tough, and a pepper relish that was not very tasty. I've never sent a dish back unless it had an allergen in it, and I don't think I've ever been totally unable to eat something - but we just had to leave it untouched. To her credit, the server took it off of our bill, which I appreciated, because $17 for an inedible preparation of the cheapest cut of lamb is absurd. I did feel like that was a waste of that lamb's life. Hopefully someone made better use of the rest of the animal. Overall, I thought Alden & Harlow was pretentious, overwrought, unfocused, and pretty disappointing. It needs an editor, better direction, and someone who knows how to cook lamb breast. The pasta, though! The pasta was delicious! A whole extra star for the pasta. And I hear the kale salad is good. I'd recommend arriving by 6 to eat the pasta and kale salad at the bar with a glass of red wine, and leaving before the atmosphere becomes too much."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Pros: Fatty brisket, ribs\\nCons: Limited supply, have to wait in lineSo I waited in line for 2 1/2 hours starting at 8:30 AM.

My friend from Portland took us out to eat brunch here during the weekend, and the anticipation of eating here was psyching me out a bit. Especially after having such a great meal out at Tasty N Sons after arriving in Portland.  This is one of those places that can probably be compared to Bills Cafe in SJ (which I still haven't had the luxury of eating at yet).  I'll have to see how Bills rates next to Screen Door soon.  Anyhow, the wait was pretty long but easy when you have three other friends to talk to.  The place had an outdoor patio eating area and was essentially packed.  They had some pretty good free coffee inside for all patrons waiting (both decaf and regular I believe).  The interior was nicely trendy and slightly modern from what I can remember.  I was pretty decisive on ordering the fried oyster benedict and damn the portion was big.  I couldn't finish the whole thing, and had to box up like a third of it. The other food ordered looked f-ing delish which I had pictures of.  I don't usually take pics of food before eating but should think about carrying a point and shoot for that more often.  I remember seeing a guy next to us pull out a full sized Samsung Galaxy Tab, first time seeing someone use that in a restaurant... hehe.  Anyway, I really liked the restaurant setup and the seemingly reasonable menu prices, quality food, and relatively fast service all around.

I was thinking the place would be more on the lines of Goode Company Barbeque in terms of wait in line and order at a counter and sit on some benches. No, this place is pretty much like a 99 restaurant.It was the Sunday night during Memorial Day weekend so the place was full. Ended up being sat at a table in the bar/waiting area, which was fine. I could of declined and waiting for something better to open but I was hungry. It was there I realized just how much a tourist attraction it really was.Ordered the fired green tomatoes, which were awesome. As for my meal I got brisket with potato salad and pinto beans. The portion first off wasn't very big nor was the food that great. Meat was lacking even with the sauce. A chicken dish was also order from the party and it appeared pink and almost raw in some places. Not good.Worse part is of all this, two 1-meat plates, 2 beers, and an app cost me $50.

I don't know if I'll ever try this place again, if it wasn't for the horrible service I probably would.  My advice to the owners, never sacrifice service or food, even if you have to serve the guests yourself, plus you're in a premier location with many good restaurants around you, it's important you notice when your guests are having a really bad experience before they walk out, or else they leave a review like mine..

THE WAIT: About 10 minutes for a group of 4, around 1pm on a Thursday.SERVICE: They're definitely busy and the staff always seems to be running around, but someone always seemed to come to our table at the right times and be there when we needed them.THE COST: About $15 total for a big meal shared with four. The best thing was they offered to split our bill per each person's entree, evenly spitting the cost of the appetizers across the four of us!MUST-HAVES: The Fried Mac n Cheese special impressed us all. We all liked the Frito Pie, after wondering what it was. Everyone's favorite meat by far was the Pulled Pork.Please see my photos for extra info/details!* Fried Mac n Cheese - 4.5 stars\\nVery thinly, evenly crisped balls of mac n cheese. Still very warm and gooey on the inside. We loved this!* Frito Pie - 4.5 stars\\nA surprise favorite. They take their chili and mix it with Fritos, serving it out of a Fritos bag. Sounds kind of ghetto, kind of random, but it actually comes out really good!* Texas Fries - 3.5 stars\\nGreat components with all that cheese and meat on top of the fries, but it gets to be a little too much, too quickly. If it weren't for all that extra cheese and sauce, the meat would be on the dry side.* Fox Bros Burger - 4 stars\\nButtery soft bun, a ton of meat, cheese, and bacon. This was great, albeit very filling! The brisket would be dry if it weren't for everything else on this burger.On the meats...\\nEverything was good, though as I mentioned, the Pulled Pork was the favorite. The Brisket had big chunks of fatty meat that I had to pick around, but if you like that all the better.On the other sides...\\nThe Chili is not worth getting if you're getting the Frito Pie. I don't usually like Coleslaw but I like theirs - it tastes fresh, has this light sweetness about it. The cornbread was dry like last time. You need a lot of butter.

I've had both on multiple occasions for the past few years and with different crowds of people or just on a date. The overall ambience us pretty laid back with a nice waterfall wall by the entrance. There's always at least one friendly host as you make your way into the resraurant, pass the waterfall wall. Take a left after being greeted by friendly hosts and you will on the hibachi side of the restaurant.Over the past few years, the food from hibachi has improved tremendously. However, it's not as much as it used to be. I would always have leftovers from hibachi but for the past year, the food quantity has decreased. At least the hibachi food are more flavorful and hibachi isn't just for the show. They have limited flavors of fried ice cream. For the most part, their fried ice cream are delicious. Drinks aren't as good as it once was. It is now more watered down. Servers on the hibachi side are more attentive than the sushi/hotpot side of the restaurant. Hibachi prices here seems to be in the norms compare to other hibachi reataurants. If you're wondering, you can also order sushi even if you're sitting on the hibachi side of the restaurant. With your choice of hibachi section, you will get a complimentary side salad with peanut sauce and a small bowl of miso soup before the hibachi show begins.Now, onto their sushi and hotpot. They have a variety of selections but on the pricier side. The servers on the sushi/hotpot side of the restaurant lacks services. Does that makes sense? It's been like this for years and have yet to change. They're slow, not attentive, sometimes you get a friendly server and sometimes you get a 'I don't give a crap, just give me my tip money' server. Food takes forever to come out and you will need to flag someone or another server to get wgat you need. For some reason, at least half the time I've been at the hotpot/sushi side, the sushi comes out before my hotpot food, including the pot of broths. I'm not sure what goes on in the kitchen but does it really take that much longer to bring hot pot food and broths out? Prices for their sushi and hotpot selections are pricier than the average cost.Parking. Oh man, extremely limited. If I remember correctly, there's 5 parking spaces and 2 handicap parking spaces in the front of the restaurant, along with one ginormous pothole or many potholes. No biggie. You can park over on the side of 99 restaurants or SSP parking deck (parking garage). Just be careful and look at all directions before crossing the street if you don't want to die. Overall, I like it here, especially for their hibachi and the closes one to me as of right now that I can drive to with parking. Their hotpot isn't my to go to place but I'll come here for hotpot if I'm in the area and too lazy to drive to my favorite place for hotpot. Yes, too lazy to drive elsewhere but not lazy to walk from the mall over.

I loved that they paired the tomatoes with goat cheese and the sauce underneath was nice and light.

If the crab cake was not enough the hash will put it over the top. Easy to share between two people. + Chicken and waffle: The must get if you come to this place. The chicken is just as good as everyone has said! It was lightly coated but crispy on the outside while the inside was moist and tender.

The decor is really modern and pop art-like, with the under the sea theme. The seating is nice, half indoors, have outdoors on a balcony that overlooks city walk . They also have cornhole, which I love playing because I happen to be an MVP at throwing bean bags. \\nThe service was great, everyone was really friendly. One of the hostesses even said I looked like Rapunzel because of my long hair and that made me feel wonderful of course.\\nNow on to the food. It was delicious, they serve one of the best burgers I've ever had. I must admit it was hard to choose because I love sushi and burgers but they also had a couple bento boxes which came with a half roll of sushi and a mini burger. I recommends trying them individually though because the mini burger just isn't as delicious as their full sized ones. If you want maximum flavor and delicious juiciness, go for the full sized burger. The sushi was also really delightful. I love the philly roll and their's hit the spot.\\nI thoroughly enjoyed my experience here and will definitely be coming back with friends and family when we wanna go somewhere good to eat.

I do enjoy that you can order a beer with your food. It's a decent place if you're looking for a quick bite before a Sox game. However, you can't order a burger medium well which leads me to believe they are pre-cooked/frozen patties. This doesn't surprise me based on their prices but they do not even taste that good and mine have been soggy both times I have ordered a burger here. The fries are on par with buying a bag of frozen grocery store fries. In all honesty, I'd rather pay a few dollars more somewhere else for better food, i.e. Five Guys. My biggest gripe with Tasty Burger is that my waitress did not give me my full change after I payed in cash. I am a generous tipper but I do not appreciate a waitress expecting what they can keep and just not giving me my change."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"My first visit I went during lunch and it wasn't that busy.

On my last visit, we were seated at a table that had cold air whooshing down on us (they did move us), and our server was a little impatient with us, which we found annoying since we planned to eat & drink like crazy and spend lots of money!The two disappointing items that stick out my mind were the pumpkin salad and the misson figs. I've had the squash salad in the past (many times), which is a very similar dish, and the amount of food on the plate was less than half of what it was when I last ordered the squash salad. It's not even meat...why skimp?! The mission figs were delicious, but the dish was literally two raw figs sliced in half on a smear of pate, for like $13.

It's around the corner from me and the staff recognize me and my family when we come.  The girl behind the counter asks about us, remembers little details like that I'm a teacher, and knows what I like.  I appreicate that a ton.The food: we think the food here is beyond excellent.  I like the original and the dipping ramen.  My husband likes the original and the miso-hot.  I usually add ginger and the corn butter combo (corn on the bomb) and my husband will add one of the spicy bombs. The spicy additions are very spicy, but they're served on the side so that you can control the spice yourself.  Personally I think they kind of wreck the flavor of the soup, but my husband loves spice and thinks they're great. Sometimes we add the garlic too (it's just raw garlic served with a garlic press, but it actually is really good in the soup.  Just no kissing later.)  The broth is creamy and porky and crave-worthy. The sweet and sour yodas are intense little brussel sprouts served with apricot vinegar.  My husband finds them too vinegar-y but my daughters and I love them.  The katsu burger is awesome but we almost never order it because it's really rich and the bowls of ramen themselves are over the top rich.  The potato salad served on the side of the katsu burger is so good and I wish they would add it as a side to their menu.We always add one chasu bowl - a bowl of rice with veggies and chashu pork.  It's sold for a $1 discount if bought together with a bowl of soup and makes a perfect meal for my two daughters (they split one bowl).  Plus, even though they proudly advertise no take out, they will give you a box to take the chashu bowl home in, so even when I eat there alone I order one and pack it up to go after.  It's great the next day for lunch.They also serve beer and sake (yum) at very reasonable prices along with all those weird Japanese sodas and coffees that I don't get but other people really seem to love.  There is frequently a really long wait on Friday and Saturday nights, but if you go when they open during the week (I think 5:30) you usually don't have to wait more than about 5 min in line and the food gets served pretty quickly after you sit down.  They've been experimenting with the whole process of getting people thorugh the line and seated.  They're not quite as efficient as Hopdoddy yet, but they've really responded thoughtfully to customer feedback and they've gotten a ton better over the past year."},{"name":"Tokyo Japanese Steak House","address":"250 Granite St","city":"Braintree","stars":"3","text":"I went to this restaurant in Chestnut Hill all the time and it was fantastic.

Their strength is in their variety and consistency. From their breakfast menu, I enjoy the Jess Special, but also love the build-your-own options. Price varies based on the number of items in your taco, but even the 4-item option rings in at under $3 each. One thing I've discovered here is that mashed potatoes are surprisingly good in breakfast tacos. The creaminess of the potato takes some getting used to, but it's a great base for the other items and helps to balance out the heat from the salsas. I don't think this is for everyone, but maybe worth a shot if you're looking for something new.

And, after two meals there in less than a week, I can definitely recommend SCK in the heart of Midtown as a great choice  for Southern food done well.After scouting out SCK for lunch earlier in the week (The SCK Pimento Burger was killer), I took my wife there for her birthday with her BFF...and it was everything I hoped it would be for a modern southern experience.Server-guy was professional...a little light on personality and very serious throughout but, efficient. No complaints. He brought each of us a glass of wine and answered our questions succinctly (although he incorrectly suggested a few of the appetizer portions were 'personal sized' when they turned out to be much larger). Earlier in the week I met bartender Mark...and he was very informative and a great advocate for the restaurant and, all things ATL.\\n \\nThe chicken liver appetizers were surprisingly good (lots of flavors going on @ one time)  and the She-Crab  soup was pretty killer. But, we all unanimously thought their much-hyped fried green tomatoes were just 'ok'. Just not a ton of flavor in spite of the goat cheese and red pepper sauce...or maybe the taste buds of 3 people all failed at once? For dinner, we got the shrimp & grits and two of us got the fried chicken and they were outstanding choices. HOWEVER: Be sure and go to this restaurant super hungry...or you'll risk falling into that familiar trap of not being as hungry when the main course comes). Everything is just interestingly good...for someone not that familiar with 'southern' cuisine so, it's hard to not overindulge on the early courses..Final tab for 3 was $140 with tip so, pricey but, not out of the ballpark for the quality.

His entry was selected, so we did not have to wait the 4 hours to be served.I talked to the manger, and Franklin smokes 2,000 lbs of meat per day.

This places is literally where i want to someday build a fort underneath all the tables and live there, while stuffing my face full of all the amazing-ness that goes on in that kitchen! In all seriousness, this place is AMAZING!! My friend and I decided to spend a weekend vacation in Portland, Oregon and i was put in charge of  planning all the good eats around Portland. Using my trusty yelping skills i found \\"Screen Door\\" as one of the most highly rated brunch/breakfast places in Portland. So my friend and I got up in the wee hours of the morning (8 am) and took the bus to the restaurant. We got there at 9:30-ish am and there was already an hour and a half to 2 hour wait! DAMN! I have seen breakfast places with a long wait time but this was the first time i have ever seen a place with such a long wait time for when they just opened! But what the cheese, my friend and i decided to wait and walk around until it was our turn. \\"Screen Door\\" is in a more residential area of Portland so there wasn't a whole lot of shops to go to and it was still early in the morning so most of the shops were still closed. Luckily, there was a Starbucks maybe 5 blocks down (yay....maybe). So my friend and I decided to get away from the cold and sit le coffee shop and play Angry Birds. When it was about an hour since we placed our names on the wait-list, we started to head back and see how much longer we would have to wait. I think we might have waited a little less than an hour for our table and then another 20-25 min for the food. Due to the help of my fellow yelpers i already planned out the two dishes we were going to get so that we can just start eating. We ordered the fried chicken and waffle and the banana's fosters french toast. OMG let me dive into the awesomeness that are the two dishes i have consumed! Fried chicken and waffle: This is by far the BEST chicken and waffles i have ever placed between my lips! This beats Rossoc's chicken and waffles to the ground and a couple of more slaps in the face! There wasn't just one or two big huge slabs of fried chicken breast but THREE, huge deliciously fried chicken breast that was still moist  and had a little kick to them. Underneath the mountain of chicken glory was a delicate sweet potato waffle. This was a real waffle. Nothing like the flimsy stuff you but and toast at home. This my friend was what all the other waffle babies dreams to be! This waffle was almost as big as the THREE fried chicken breast...but i know i am digressing. This was like a perfect marriage made in chicken and waffle heaven. Each held their own in flavor and integrity and complemented each other very well. When you place the magic elixir we call the syrup over the two, you have instead HAPPINESS!! I can literally go on and on about this one dish but i have to move on to what i think is the only dish that should ever be consumed. Banana's fosters French toast:  If you thought i was a little obsessive over that fried chicken and waffle dish, you haven't read nothing yet. I shall begin by saying that if i had to choose a last meal to eat in the whole entire world, I will pick this dish right here! No words can ever describe the instant euphoria that i felt eating this master piece. I normally do not like ordering sweet things for breakfast or sweets in general but after reading all the reviews and how \\"good\\" it was, i decided to give it a shot. OMG i am so glad that i did! It might look like just a simple french toast number but no no my friend this can and did for me, change my life! The toast was super fluffy and light with just a hint of sweetness from the syrup. The banana's were perfectly caramelized and still had it's firm texture to it. This is the money bit everyone, when i got a piece of the french toast with the all the nice yummy syrup over it and then a sliced banana with it, with some of their fresh whipped cream and the touch of cinnamon in the toast.......BOOM.....life CHANGED!!!! You might think i am joking but honestly i am not, it was just that good! Such a simply dish just changed everything in the french toast world for me. After the orgy in our mouths, my friend and i could not get out of our chairs because the portions were super huge, two dishes can easily feed 3 people with a tummy ache to spare. We had never been so sad and happy all at the same time after attempting to finish our meal. Best and worst idea ever!! When i got back home, i had this moment where i was already planning my way back to Portland so that i can have the banana's fosters French toast again. Bottom line: Just go! Go and be happy and eat at \\"Screen Door.\\" You have to at least try and stop yourself from eating that french toast. Just go....and take me with you please!"},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I have to start by giving South City Kitchen *massive* props; they impressed my parents.  And that is NOT an easy job!  Whenever I go out to eat with my dad, I hold my breath a little.  He is notorious for causing scenes at restaurants.  And I don't mean just sending his steak back if it's not cooked right.  One time he bitched out our server at Il Pasticio in Savannah for not distributing a bottle of wine around the table well enough and made him cry.  No seriously, he refused to be our server and pushed us to someone else.\\n    So yeah, I'm always a little scared to take him anywhere.  And I was even more scared this time because Kyle had chosen the restaurant.  And I'm sure we all know how dads love to be harsh on the boyfriends...   He complained a little at first.. We had to wait a few mins for the table even though we had reservations... The wine list could be bigger..  But he was nothing but smiles and compliments once he tried the food!  We passed around chicken livers, fried green tomatoes, and shrimp for appetizers.  I don't do bizarre organs, but my dad really loved them and my mom was impressed by the shrimp, which is shocking since she grew up on the river and is a total shrimp snob.  \\n     As for the entrees, all I remember is my vegetable plate!  I love vegetable plates and this was a great one!  I also appreciated that our server graciously allowed me to substitute for one of the items.  Crisp, sweet corn, field peas, green beans...  All flavorful and delicious!  And get this:  It was my birthday and at the end of my meal, a little baby chocolate bread pudding showed up with candles.  Now this wouldn't have been surprising at all, except that no one left the table the whole meal!  How is this possible?!  Turns out, Kyle had noted that it was my birthday on his online reservation.

So I asked a waitress to bring it back to the kitchen and check the taste with a chef, but she refused it. Moreover, she brought a spoon and tasted the soup in front of us, then said 'it is normal taste'. Well, I guess she thought that I am a stupid woman who complained about NORMAL TASTE OF UDON SOUP.

I never raised my voice, I was speaking in my normal tone. I was not showing any frustration. This guy should not be answering phones or dealing with the public. he had no nice way about him, and he apparently thinks it's ok to just hang up in a womans ear.  After reading other reviews ( read 19 reviews for Dim Sum Cafe that are not currently recommended) it has come to my attention that hanging up on people has become a regular occurrence.  If they are frustrated with YOU in any way, you get hung up on. That kind of attitude is not good business practice. It is beyond comprehension that they can treat people this way. Will never do business there again. I don't need to be abused by a place that I am giving my hard earned money to. There are plenty of places that treat their customers with kindness.

Nope!\\n The coco prawns are overcooked to the point of being tough, and they'd also be dry except they drool excess oil. The \\"firecracker marmalade\\" they're served with sounded like it would be some kind of balanced sweet/hot sauce, but it's just nothing less or more than jellied orange juice. Edible, but disappointing, and at $8 for four not-very-sizeable shrimp, not a good value.The curried goat roti with potatoes would more truthfully be called a potato wrap with goat and curry flavour; the filling is mostly potatoes with a sprinkling of small pieces of goat meat. The curry sauce is OK but not better than that, the flatbread wrap's texture is floury and dry, and the size of the whole roti is not reasonable for the $13 price. Sigh.

It's not the place for romance or a special occasion nor is it remotely authentic or Tex-Mex like you'll find in Texas, but it serves its purpose pretty darn well and I've never, ever, had bad service here.

Pros: Free parking, nice bar, lots of seating, friendly staff, cheap prices, great selection of beer and dogs so much that it takes me forever to make up my mind, lol.  Cons: Floor was dirty where we sat, I found the food to not be as good, the front door slams very loud every time someone enters which is unsettling.     Server was prompt to get to us.  My guy ordered pop and then realized he meant to get the beer of the week and when he told the server this he was more then happy to get the beer and told us to just keep the pop.  Granted the pop is already poured, but he was nice about it and handled it nicely.  We always get the French fried with cheese and bacon (best I have ever had as I love the cheese they use) you can't beat the price I think it's $3.  This time when they came out first thing I noticed was it was a smaller portion then in the past and it wasn't done very well and flopped to one side of the basket.  It was covered in tasty bacon, but the cheese was not as saucy and that made me sad.  I told the server I was torn between the West Virginia dog or the Slappy Pappy sloppy dog and he said the slappy pappy was the best so I went with it.  I also tried it ripped which means fried, and I went with a normal dog when I usually get a brat.  So while I wasn't happy with this slappy pappy I am not sure if it is because I changed the way I order or if it really is that deceptively flavorless, I mean it has chili, cheddar, fries, and sour cream, but I couldn't even taste the chili.  It sounded awesome, but turned out a dud I didn't even eat it all.  My guy always gets normal hot dog in the chili dog, but this time he went with a brat and had it ripped.  He was happy with it.     The art is great, the staff is great, the local music only is great, the atmosphere is great, and usually the food is great (at least at the original location), and the prices are totally awesome.

Ordered the biscuit and gravy with a side of mac and cheese. The dish comes with one giant biscuit which is up to par with many other biscuits. The gravy was a good mix of flavor and just enough to cover the biscuit. Almost not enough for every bite though. The mac and cheese comes with a top layer of potato chips that adds a great crunch to a very rich mac and cheese. I consider this a must order. The second diner at my table ordered the chicken sandwich that tries to mimic Chick Fil A. I think it does a better job than Chick Fil A itself. The sauce is a good mayo based savory addition and the pickle is fantastic. Not under pickled and not over pickled. The chicken has a great crisp to it and is very tender.

Have not eaten anything however. First time, I stupidly went by on a Tuesday. Closed. Well, everyone needs a day off,  but this is supposed to be an old time burger joint. I'm old time, and I've never seen a burger joint closed on a Tuesday. Go to Yelp to find hours. Closed Tuesday AND Wednesday. What sort of idiot planned this schedule. Oh, the guy from Ping and Pok Pok. No wonder. And no wonder they don't offer tomatoes on hamburgers in January. \\"God! They are out of season, and in Portland, we ONLY use ingredients when they are in season....\\"  NO TOMATOES in an old fashioned hamburger joint????? Get off your high fu-king horse. I love seasonal stuff, I grow fantastic tomatoes, herbs, salad greens, etc. But on a fu-king burger, yes, even in January, I want a tomato and I don't need the Food Nazi (whose waitstaff at that Pok place has got to be the most irritating folks I\\"ve ever been served by \\"Uh, that's pronounced XXXXX,\\" I've been told more than once. Ok, the waitstaff here has lived in Thailand and knows all the transliteration variants of written and spoken Thai.....I don't think so...look at any 4-5 Thai menus around the USA and you'll see wide variation in these hard to standardize orthographies)  No Tomatoes In January on the Hamburger sir, and that is pronounced \\"HAM-burger\\" .  Asshole.Ok, Yelp tells me, and other reviews around the 'net tell me this place is open late...Yelp says until 11pm on Mondays. But I'd heard about the lines and decided to delay dinner tonight until a bit later. So at 9pm I cruised over--in my neighborhood, nice to have something replace the very-much-missed CAVA--to have a 'mater-less burger with a tedious pedigree for every ingredient. Oh, by the way, is lettuce in season in Oregon in January? Is wheat, and thus the flour used in the buns in season in January in Oregon? What about the sugar in the apparently awful milkshakes (see other Yelp reviews) in season in Oregon in January?  If were gonna carry this loco-vore nonsense this far, then why not for everything, Mr. Pok?  Anyway, I went in, sat down. Thinking about that burger without a tomato that has a certificate of provenance for every single ingredient. Well, the nice waitron comes over and says, \\"we're closed for the night.\\"  What??? I thought you were open late. Your hours say you are open late, every review, almost, that I've seen has said you are open late. What gives?  The footnote here is that this is just another proof to me that Portland is an extremely provincial little burgh where the sidewalks roll up at 9. Maybe 10. I've been in bars here that, even on Saturday, close down around 11 or 11.30 because they are empty. Shit, in Austin, bars don't even start filling up until that hour, and I can't think of ANY bar that would be empty at 11pm on a Saturday.  And I can't think of ANY burger joint there that would not put tomatoes on a friggin' hamburger  because \\"it's not in season.\\" Give me a break!!!!!Sorry, Mr Pok, you will have to go on without my $$$, not that you really care...yer PP fans will gobble up your precious burgers and stand in line for an hour or two for the privilege of saying \\"Man, you have to go to Foster Burger!

Luckily for us, they were not busy and got seated right away, but I read in other reviews that reservations are recommended. However, by the time we were finished eating, the restaurant had filled up quite a bit.  They do not have a private lot, and you must find street parking.  We parked across the street in a pay to park lot.Although we were looking for chicken and waffles, we were disappointed to discover that they stop serving this dish after brunch time (3 or 4 pm). They do offer the chicken in its own dish, so you're just missing out on the waffle. The Springer Mountain Farms Fried Chicken comes with collard greens, red bliss potatoes, honey-thyme jus.  The potatoes are well seasoned and super creamy, which I love. The fried chicken did not disappoint; it is boneless, juicy, and the skin is crispy.I ordered a Country Thyme Lemonade  (american spirit white whiskey, thyme, fresh lemon & zest) with my meal.  It was light and refreshing, and I didn't taste any alcohol, but it did make me flush quickly! It's a tasty drink that packs a punch. I loved my meal at South City Kitchen.

I've read and heard great things about it and always wanted to go. We take a seat on this beautiful Sunday, facing the street. The restaurant is really nice, I love the division of patio style seating and restaurant seating in the back. \\nThe nice experience ended there. \\nWe sat, and sat, got water poured for us by a man who seemed to be trying to help the servers out (I think there were two servers taking care of this section, but it was a small section so that shouldn't be an issue..). We look around and notice one server on the other side seems to be doing his job well, the other is standing by the bar fiddling his thumbs and just kinda standing there. We waited a good 10 min before we asked someone if we could get a waiter to our table. Still nothing for another 5 minutes and then we were greeted by Jack? Zack? Irrelevant now, but it was one or the other. Wasn't the guy who was actually serving people, it was the other one. We give him our entire order right away, beverages and simple lunch order. Another 10 min go by, my dad signals to Jack that I haven't gotten my drink yet, which was a draft beer.. should take a good 2 minutes... a few minutes later he brings it. I'm hoping at least the food will be good and he won't take forever for anything else, after talking this place up to my dad and reading other yelp reviews as we sat there, I was getting frustrated. Then someone brings me my Caesar salad, but it's missing the chicken I added. The guy who brought it looks at the ticket, it seems like Jack may not have written to add chicken, either way he takes it back to the kitchen. Then a gentleman who sat down about 10 minutes after we did receives his big sandwich order. I'm confused because we got a salad, and a burger, and the wrong salad took about 20 minutes to come out. We keep waiting. A good while later, the correct salad comes out. Doesn't even look appetizing, but I wait for my dads burger to arrive before tasting my food. We wait 15 minutes, we ask Jack where the burger is and remind him that we placed our order at least half an hour ago, he says \\"sorry let me go check on that for you\\". He comes back to tell us \\"sorry, apparently, we have been out of burgers as of 20 minutes ago\\". So 1. Why didn't you tell anyone who placed a burger order this information, 20 MINUTES AGO? When it apparently happened? 2. How do you work in a restaurant? Just how? Also how are you out of burgers...... this is unreal. So I left my untouched salad dish, my half empty peroni, and we walked out. Are you kidding me?? For a place with so many reviews, I'm so stunned and for a NEARLY EMPTY RESTAURANT, this meal should've been a breeze. If sonsie gets so busy, so often, how did no part of our 2-person order and overall experience go right? I don't get it, wasn't impressed by the least. Idk if it was just our server, or a bad day for the restaurant.. but there's no excuse. It was calm. Not busy. Everything took way too long, and when we did get interactions, they weren't even normal or nice, there were constant issues. Won't ever be returning. As a hospitality graduate, and someone who's worked in restaurants since I was 16, I was so confused by this experience.

Spoiler: I still prefer vietnamese pho (obviously it's very different but they're both noodle soups from Asia, give me a break).I went at 9pm on a weekday and had to wait about 10 minutes in line. I've seen the line much longer at other times and it's definitely not worth the wait. In fact, even at 10 minutes of wait I don't expect to come back to this location until it becomes less crowded. Surprisingly, it takes another 10-15 minutes to get your food once seated. I'm used to pho coming out in 5 minutes or less so I guess this just seemed odd.My girlfriend and I both got the number 1 because we didn't know anything about ramen. I thought the broth was delicious; it's super thick and has a very strong flavor on its own. She doesn't like pork as much as me and thought it was too thick. To each her own, I suppose.Overall, it was very tasty and I'd eat it again but pho is cheaper, faster, and more available while tasting equally good to me (although, again, they're very different, they don't taste the same, they're just both good in their own way). As such, I don't expect to be making regular trips for ramen the way we do with pho.Bottom line - check it out unless you hate pork but it's not worth waiting in line for.

We had a reservation, but weren't seated until 15 minutes later... which had us just sitting down by the time the \\"brunch special\\" ends. So, naturally when the waitress came by I immediately let her know we had hoped to take advantage of that special and would it still be ok. She said it was fine, we place our order right then, and it was all downhill from there.We must have irritated her, because she was rude to us for the remainder of our meal. We never got the basket of breads every other table got. At one point, she came to clear our plates and tipped the plate to dump my silverware onto the table. Finally, we were charged double for a side order of 2 pieces of bacon! I had ordered the eggs benedict which doesn't have meat, and ordered a side of bacon after the fact - on the menu it says with the meal it's just $2.75. On the bill it was $4.25. Upon asking, she said because I didn't order it immediately with my meal she had to enter it differently - Ok sure, if that' how your system works then fine, but don't just overcharge without asking! She said she had to ask a manager about fixing it. She did and we paid and that was that.For what was supposed to be a special meal, we had a really disappointing experience.

Unfortunately I wasn't in the mood for a burger so I got the buffalo chicken sandwich for myself and my mom is a huge burger fan so I got her a bacon cheeseburger. I also ordered the 50/50.Chicken sandwich was good nothing special. Fires and onion rings were like crack (not that I know how crack is). I was in heaven eating those things. Once I got to my mom's house and surprised her with a \\"tasty burger\\" she said it was very good but nothing compared to Fuddruckers. I guess I'll be the judge of that when I try one for myself. Service was very slow. I was disappointed which is why they get three stars. I would've given 4 for the fries and rings alone but it was cold and that little heated lamp thingy wasn't doing the job. If you tell me my food will be ready in 10 minutes and I order it at 5pm I don't expect to still be standing at the window at 5:20."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We visited on a weekday morning, with no wait in sight. We had the chicken and waffles and the chicken biscuit sliders. Both were excellent, very hearty portions. The fried chicken and the biscuits and gravy were great. I was pleasantly surprised by the praline bacon. Despite my love of bacon, I often do not like candied bacon. However, this wasn't overly sweet and had a ton of pecans on it, which I love. I'd tell you to share something when you visit because the portions are so big, but it's hard to decide for first time visitors."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Went to this place with a lady friend to get dinner before going to Nick's comedy stop (which ended up being a lot of fun). Stopped in for happy hour (half off tapas) and a Cinqo de Mayo special. Overall, we had a great time and I would definitely go back.\\nWe got there on Quatro de Mayo (Saturday) at 6:30pm or so and saw an almost entirely empty dining room and were told that we couldn't sit b/c they had a lot of reservations for 7-7:30. I found this annoying. Perhaps 30 minutes later she came over (after we had gotten a beautiful seat at the bar) and told us we could have a table, to which we replied \\"no thank you\\" and then I cursed her name after she left. I understand having a lot of reservations, but we're talking almost totally empty. I didn't like her. The place itself is nice and clean, nothing all that interesting, but definitely nice. The bar area was nice too. Once people started arriving, it was hopping and had a good crowd - lots in their 30s I think.\\nAnyway, we started with drinks - a glass of red sangria and white sangria. Both had fruit in them, so they passed that test. They were both fruity without being super sweet. I liked the fruity, but would've liked them sweeter. But they were still solid sangrias.\\nThen moved on to the tapas. We had a combo where we got one of each, which ended up being like 10 different things. We were very happy with it. Probably enough calories for a entire meal between the two of us, but that's how it goes. Most everything was flavorful and tasty. Some with some zip, but none super spicy.\\nOh, the service at the bar was excellent too. Really liked our bar tender.\\nWith the meal came some bread - corn and white with butter. Pretty good bread.\\nAs an appetizer we got the beef chimichangas: good size for an appetizer, came with guac drizzled on the plate, tomatoes, and cubes of cheese. Quite tasty.\\nFollowed this with the spiced grilled tiger shrimp, served in a spicy sauce with salsa and rice pilaf. 4 giant shrimp, well spiced and quite tasty. The rice was rice, but it took up the flavor of the sauce well. Quite tasty, though not too filling unless you eat 2 cups of rice.\\nFinished with a chocolate taco: chocolate ice cream in a fried sweetened tortilla, topped with a mint leaf. Not that fancy, but you can't go wrong with chocolate ice cream and fried dough.\\nWe were able to split all that food between us and still take some home. \\nThe price wasn't cheap, but seemed pretty reasonable, considering how much food we got.\\nOverall enjoyed it."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I really enjoyed Border Cafe.

But after waiting two hours, I am pretty sure that my shoe would have also tasted good. We had the brisket (it was actually a little dry), the pork ribs (really good), and the turkey. Now here is the thing with the turkey - it was absolutely AMAZING. My husband, who \\"f*cking hates turkey,\\" for some bizarro reason decided to order it. He LOVED it. And it was the best turkey I have ever tasted. You have to get this - if for no other reason than to taste how fabulous turkey can be! He couldn't stop talking about it all day.It would be nice if they put up some awnings over the parts of the line that are in the sun. They could easily do this to make the long wait a little more tolerable. But do yourself a favor - while one person waits in line, send someone over to the Purple Bean Cafe which is three blocks down from Franklin on 11th Street to pick up iced coffee (and maybe a snack). SO good!Also, if you are ordering a LOT of meat (5 pounds minimum), you can actually do that in advance via email and then pick up your order between 10:30 - 10:50 am (right before they open). No waiting in line. So, if you have a group of people who want to eat, you might want to go that route. You do have to take it to go though and you have to order the food by the pound.

It was a quite good dining experience for us. We have been to a chain Brazilian steak house on 2 prior occasions (Fogo de Chao in Atlanta's Buckhead district). We were all pretty hungry after a day at the parks and traveling. The decor was nice. Dark lighting but nice. About what you would expect for such a place. I did notice the kid zone, which seems like a good idea if dining with children.  Our drinks were pretty good. I like strong drinks as does my wife. The house margarita was a nice start to the experience. Pretty sure I saw that they were using Cuervo 1800. We were impressed with the quality of the food at the banquet area....The Salmon and capers were pretty good. We are 20+ year Alaskans who harvested our own salmon when we lived there. The salmon didn't taste like the mushy Atlantic salmon that is farmed in our more recent dining experiences. If you've ever had wild Alaskan Salmon and compared it with farmed salmon, you know what I am talking about...no comparison. Theirs was quite good and cooked well, though not overcooked. Other dishes were pretty tasty too, the Shrimp polenta with cheese, marinated mushrooms and the butternut squash soup were nice compliments to the main course. The Cerviche and sushi as appetizers were very good. The hearts of palm and asparagus were nice touches too. The cold cuts and assorted cheeses were of very high quality and a nice compliment to the meal. The honeycomb, black walnuts and assorted dried fruits (figs, papaya, pineapple) were nice touches as well.The meat that was brought to us was cooked well, though a bit too overcooked to my preference. I like my meats bloody and pink in the middle...so I call that medium rare. These were more medium to well done pieces. Highlights of the meats were the top sirloin, the cuts of lamb (shank and chops) and the flank steak. The filet portions were wrapped in bacon as was the chicken, they were smaller, bite sized portions. Salty but still ok. I recall the cuts at Fogo de chao being of a higher quality and consistency. This wasn't too bad though. The service was passable but we were a bit shocked when the bill came and the service fee, which hadn't been mentioned prior to dining, was added to the 39.99 per diner fees. We usually tip well with good service and prefer to decide ourselves whether we are going to give 18% or more.

I clarify what that means, assuming it's the liquor but wanted to be sure.  $3 more for a double vodka she says. She brings back the drink and slops it down on the counter - no napkin.  The women next to me hands me a napkin and gives me an understanding look.  I take a sip.  It's like tomato paste.  I stir it thinking maybe that was the issue.  Nope.  Definitely too thick.  I also can't taste any alcohol or spices.  It was the worst Bloody Mary I've ever come across in my life.  The waitress was ever so snarky, there were only 3 people at the large bar but when I tried to get her attention as she moped by I was ignored.  I finally brought the drink up to the bar and told her it was too thick and didn't taste any alcohol.  I didn't even want another one because  I knew if they got it this wrong, there was no hope.

OMG I love Wright's, it is best in town for sandwiches, salads and sides.  Everything is made fresh including daily cakes, yummy! I usually get a club sandwich toasted on wheat and it great every time.  You can get sandwich as whole (recommended for take-home) or just a half.  Though I don't dive around into many assortments they do have close to 20 sandwiches if not more.  There potato and broccoli salad are fantastic but they also serve a few others that I have not tried yet.  They also make fresh pink lemonade and tea; their sweet tea is the best sweet tea in the city!  I don't know what they use but it tastes like some mint leaves are added to give it some sort of different tastes but whatever it is I am addicted to it.  They do provide regular soft drinks as well.  Now for the small part of negative with Wright's, their prices can climb fast and seem high at first but with such quality I don't mind as much but getting a sandwich, small side of broccoli salad and a drink is close to $10, for me that is high for place you think of as a sandwich shop but I've never regretted paying that price for what I got.  The other downside is their hours of operation.  They aren't open late for dinner and I think they are only open on Saturday for the weekend.

It's a pretty hot habanero cream/avacado concoction. It's addicting.  And it is exclusive to Tacodeli.  My only wish is that they were open later than 3pm."},{"name":"The Wild Horse Cafe","address":"392 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"3.5","text":"Due to the food being fantastic here, I came back for another run. The service was a little better than previously. Although my girl ordered a mojito, and had to send it back because the wilted browned mint wasn't crushed and it looked like it was picked off a crack in the sidewalk on Cabot Street, plus the drink tasted like kerosene. We asked the waitress to take it back in exchange for another drink and she acted like we had 6 heads. The wine list is still lousy. They need to add more wines from Europe. They still have the mediocre ones from Australia, and Argentina. I say this becuase the food here is top notch. Essentially it is so good, that I bumped this up to a 4 star. This place could easily be a 5 star establishment if they would just deal with the service and wine issue. They have a great selection or beers and Martinis, so improving the wine selection would only be natural.One other note.

They didn't tell me that for orders of $15+ you get a free miso soup, so then I had 2. The menu itself was decent. They don't stray too far from the sushi and Japanese home cooking. (For example, BF wanted Fried Rice, but they only have don buri rice bowls, not fried rice). Lovely heritage building on the corner of Kingsway and Burlington (near Royal Oak, across from the IHOP, beside KFC).

We ended up here. Though they weren't very busy, it took them 15 minutes to find a table on the patio for us. We were seated in the shade, right beside the intersection- not much of a view, and boy did it get chilly. We decided on a pitcher of sangria between the three of us, and were excited to look over the menu. Our waitress came back 15 minutes later, without the sangria, and asked if we wanted an appetizer. We said no to the appetizer, and before we could ask about our sangria or order our lunch, she took off. Another ten minutes pass and we had to flag down another waiter to inquire about our missing alcohol. When our server finally brought out our sangria, the table beside us had already gone through 2 beers each and had finished their appetizer and were chowing down on their entrees. We were eager to get started on our drinks and finally ordered food. Let me just say- the sangria was WEAK. The only alcohol you can even remotely detect was in the fruit- which might I add was like the canned Dole fruit medley, and there was little to none in our pitcher. We might as well have been drinking watered down juice. Our entrees finally arrived and we were starving. I ordered the Shrimp & Grits (being from The South, I had low expectations, but sometimes you just need a taste of home). The dish was divine. I was so happy with my food. We finished, decided on the Lemonade Tart (also very good) and paid our checks and went on our way. About 20 minutes later, I noticed my fingers swelling up. My hands swelled to the point that they were in severe pain and my skin was stretched to the limit. Then the vomiting started (sorry a bit of TMI right there). My only thought was that something I'd eaten was bad or I'd developed some sort of allergy. I did my research, and my conclusion is that I've either developed a random shrimp allergy, or the shrimp was not anywhere near the appropriate freshness that should be served. ALL in all- The service was some of the worst I've ever experienced, the alcohol was weak (I've never experienced that before!) and the food freshness was no where near  where it should be.

The ham was horrifically sweet, as if every individual slice of meat had been bathed in a corn syrup solution prior to being placed into my sandwich. Also starring on the ridiculously, unforgivably sweet scale was the so-called cherry limeade. It was more cherry Kool-Aid than lime. The soda fountain may have suggested adding a squeeze of lime juice, but what they really mean is to take all of the limes from the lemon-lime  container and squeeze them into your drink. Then, steal the limes from your friends' drinks and add those, too. If I had one nice thing to say about this place, it would be that the medium is a very generous size and they don't skimp on the meat (unfortunately sugary meat).They didn't greet me when I walked in.

I don't know if it's the fact that they serve awesome country food, or that they have an amazing bakery, but this review is not flowing easy.When I first arrived, I was confused. The app had taken me to the old location, a few blocks down, to a property that had been vacated. A quick call to Se7en Bites and I got that fixed pretty quickly. I re-routed, or recalculated as the GPS likes to say, and I arrived at the right place. The restaurant was bigger than I was expecting. The inside is pretty cool, and while I looked around some guy jumped the line and got in front of me. I guess he was really hungry, but no worries, food is abundant and time is limitless.I ordered the Florentine/Florence biscuit, which is an egg Benedict over spinach, and to drink I got a black tea because I had a little bit of a cold. I forgot to purchase a side of honey but luckily I was able to pay at the bakery. I wasn't in the mood to sweeten my tea with syrup or stevia, which are the only two options, but I didn't know that stevia has many medicinal properties, as well as honey.The biscuit was flavorful, and it was all cooked perfect. It was even fragrant, something that tells restaurants apart. It was simple soul food elevated to gourmet standards. Really good.The ambiance was cool. I stayed there for a bit but I had stuff to do. I also wanted to pick up something from the bakery, which has its own register, but I was really satisfied with my biscuit, I didn't need anything else.

I love this place because it's good for both vegetarians and meat eaters! They have a whole page with vegetarian listings, so you don't have to scan the menu and read every description only to find out the beans are made with meat. I like places like this because then I don't have to feel like \\"the vegetarian\\" and my omnivore friends can order what they want. Everyone is happy!The free chips come warm and crunchy. The salsa isn't my favorite, but that's a personal thing and I definitely eat it happily anyways. I also love their huge cups for fountain drinks so I don't have to bug my waitress for refills.Obviously I can't recommend meat dishes, but my boyfriend loves the Cajun food. So far he's tried the Blackened Catfish, Catfish New Orleans, and Crawfish Etouffee and has said \\"Oh man,\\" with a huge smile after every first bite. He says they make the fish meat \\"soft.\\" All the plates came with flavorful rice, beans, and a piece of THE BEST CORNBREAD EVER (see description below).For vegetarians, I highly recommend the corn and black bean empanadas, they are DELICIOUS. Unfortunately, they have cheese in them so they aren't vegan. They are full of protein and come with a nice red pepper sauce, along with rice and beans. You get four, but they're packed with protein and will probably fill you up after just two. You know what that means? LEFTOVERS! Two meals for $7. Also, a waitress recommended the corn bread and OH MAN it has a dreamy soft consistency like cake! It's also somehow crispy on the outside... I absolutely love it! I've also had the Black bean tostada salad (or something like that, I don't remember the exact name). It doesn't even need dressing and comes with a scoop of guacamole on top. It also comes in a huge, beautiful tostada shell, but is hard to take home/eat as a left over.I love the eclectic, vibrant feeling, especially downstairs. I definitely would recommend coming for lunch or an early dinner, especially if you have kids and don't like a loud/bar atmosphere, as it sometimes gets upstairs at night.

After we decided what we wanted to order and closed our menus, it took the waiter a good almost 10 minutes to take our order - and the place was not even full yet!We both got the fruit 'first course' - which was not even large enough to be considered an appetizer, much less a course!  I got maybe 5 tiny pieces of canteloupe/honeydew and 4 tiny pieces of pineapple in the bowl - and maybe 2 slivers of strawberry.  No wonder the fiesta brunch is so cheap - they barely give you any food!The free cornbread was pretty good, as were the cranberry chipotle/honey butter/apricot habanero garnishes.  I've had better cornbread (for instance, the free cornbread at Union) but it was not bad.  The main courses were not bad either.  I had the scrambled eggs with cheese which were pretty tasty.  The home fries were kinda soggy (not 'fried' enough), and the toast was a bit dry.  My boyfriend had the huevos rancheros, which were pretty good but not amazing either.All in all, I'd give the place 3 stars for food, 3.5 for atmosphere (liked the music) but only 1.5 stars for service - the hostess was downright rude.  Bottom line - a \\"good deal\\" like the fiesta brunch is only a good deal if you get actual substantial food (we didn't) and hassle-free service (we didn't).

While this hotel is not exactly a short walking distance to some of the many popular locations, it is located just about 5 minutes away from the train station that will take you to the airport (for only $2.50!), downtown or anywhere else you desire. Additionally, the hotel has a shuttle that will take you anywhere within a 3 mile range, which we definitely took advantage of. They run a nice schedule on the shuttle that is very accommodating and at one point the shuttle wasn't readily available so the hotel offered to pay for our cab fare to wherever we wanted! If you're looking to sober up then a good walk will take you to many of the popular attractions within 25 minutes or you can take a cab for about $13. There were a couple of things that did suck about this place like the water temperature for the shower, which fluctuated like crazy in our bathroom. Also, at about 8AM each morning trash trucks arrived and completely ruined our sleep. We could have closed the windows, but the ac unit did not function very well, which I think may just be as a result of the weather and the hotel probably focusing on heat vs chilled ac.

I liked the soulfire sauce the best, and my bf liked the sweet sauce the best. We got potato salad and collard greens for sides. The potato salad was good, probably from a nearby grocery store. Collard greens were alright. The cornbread, I thought, was pretty good. It wasn't too processed, like Boston Market's cornbread or anything. They also had mac n' cheese, coleslaw, and a few more sides I can't remember right now. This place had apps like wings, chili, etc. They had three or four different salads, sandwiches, and ribs. Prices were ok, considering the amount of meat you're getting. I think the full rack of ribs was something like $23. The thing that impressed me the most was that we got our food in less than 10 minutes after ordering. Bathrooms were pretty clean, and decorated nicely. The interior was also decorated kinda nice, painted bright red, and music-related art hangin on the walls. There's also a big TV, always playing some sports game. But yeah, I recommend getting the ribs."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Loved this place!

Their tsukemen is one of the top 3 I've had.Tsukemen is a dipping style ramen, usually with a fish based broth/sauce.The noodles itself are (in my opinion) superior to ramen in soup as they are cooked al dente and thicker. The broth is also thicker in consistency to cling onto the noodles, and you dip each bite as you eat. I added the extra garlic, and I definitely recommend doing so too.The restaurant is small, but the wait time passes by quickly with moderate to quick turnover rates. The table setup is more skewed towards smaller groups of 2-4 people, but I'm sure they'll try their best to accommodate a larger party if requested. In addition to the tsukemen, I also tried one of their tonkotsu original ramens. I'd choose tsukemen over the Tonkotsu ramen any day.I learned the hard way that tsukemen is only available during dinner. I returned anticipating this delicious noodle for lunch, but reluctantly left after finding out we lined up for nothing. We found another tsukemen on Yelp available for lunch and went on our way."},{"name":"Wrights Gourmet Sandwich Shoppe","address":"5482 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"4","text":"Great place for lunch!

I had been to the shop they ran over on Huff Rd. before, which was mostly outdoors/garden stuff. So, when I walked in to see the really spectacular art and lighting, I was impressed. My companion immediately remarked on what a cute choice the place was.The staff were consistently attentive, and after we finally found the lunch menu (it's about 3 pages from the end of the menu), we ordered. The chips and salsa were good -- the salsa had a nice smoky flavor that was a bit more complex than you expect from the stuff they sit down in front of you just for showing up. The chips were freshly fried and tasty, though they needed salt. My companion had the fried chicken tacos and she was very pleased, at one point asking for forgiveness as she took a break from our conversation to consume the rest of her meal. I had the lunch combination, a choose-two kind of deal. I got a chicken taco and a beef enchilada with mole sauce. The food was respectable, and even good once I added salt. The bill was reasonable, and the service was appropriately speedy for lunch.The verdict: Go here, but add salt."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I heard about this place from vegetarian friends who miss hot dogs.

With such high expectations, perhaps it is not surprising, but as a meat-eater, I just wasn't wowed. The experience was unique but the food was just average.

We were outside in the hot Texas sun with my 80 year old grandmother...the first ones in line and didn't mind waiting at all considering we didn't have reservations. The issue was the attitude Michael had. He sighed when we said we had no reservations scribbled our name on his paper....I guess they would see if they could fit us in. My grandmother had walked right inside the doorway (out of the way) to get some A/C since the heat was making her feel ill. I asked Michael if this was okay and he grunted with his hands up, \\"Do whatever you want\\"...A grimaced face and unwelcoming. The energy and vibe was so negative from that one person we just left. I went back to politely tell him about how he came off and he said...\\"We'll there were like 20 people bombarding me\\" (???).

The price per person increased by a little bit compared to before as they split the menu into 2 and increased the other one. Atmosphere was louder than I remembered. A lot of rowdy high school Aged people came on this visit and you will need to shout a bit to talk to other people at your table. The food here is just ok in my opinion. The sushi here never disappoints. Not the freshest ingredients but fresh enough. The beef short ribs were really good but we got a lot of fatty pieces. Tonkatsu and the BBQ chicken wings were also pretty good. Nothing else really stood out. Nothing was bad, either. Service is not the greatest. Some portions were small   even though we asked for a lot. Some wrong orders arrived and other orders came pretty late or not at all until we asked about it. The servers were rushing and fast walking all over, But they explained well when we gave questions or requests. Washrooms were nice with the modern dark granite walls but it was sticky.

This place is a real gem.  I can't tell you how many times I've walked up to a trailer when its 120 degrees outside expecting to find ambrosial delights straight off Zeus' table only to find another dumpy hipster-laden disappointment with plasticware and crappy food.   Ramen Tatsu-Ya was an entirely different animal.  We went, child free, fully expecting to wait in line one hour (at 7pm on a wednesday in north central austin) and did just that.  We chatted cheerily with our fellow waiters-on-line and just waited to see what happened.  We got inside, ordered a couple of beers and waited a bit more. The wait honestly is a bit overwhelming, but for once, there is some payback, because the food is indeed remarkable.  We ordered a number 1 and a number 2 both with an extra egg and a salad.The salad was $2 and a surprisingly enjoyable twist on a played-out japanese salad.  Where the average japanese salad is flavorless romaine lettuce with a grainy beefsteak tomato and an equally grainy ginger dressing this was threaded daikon, shredded purple cabbage and very ripe cherry tomatoes (halved) mixed with vinaigrette that was neither overly gingery or vinegary.  The Ramen was truly enjoyable.  The number one (standard ramen) and the number 2 (with soy paste) were legitimately different dishes.  The number one had a deeply fatty and bacony quality that suffused the broth, but still made room to enjoy the noodles, the pork belly, and particularly the soft boiled egg (i recommend ordering all the eggs your cholesterol count will allow) to shine in their own right.  My wife ordered the #2 which had a more generally more flavorful broth, but made the other additions less enjoyable.  The ideal situation would be to order a number 1 with a spicy bomb, add a little spice to the number 2 and break the rules and share.The key to enjoying this place is making sure your 1)not staving when you arrive, because you're in for a wait 2) bringing some levity, because as i said, your in for a wait 3)order eggs, because they're the absolute best you've ever had.

I'm actually not the person you should listen to about food most of the time because I'm incredibly picky and prefer things that are bland, straightforward, and standard.  I don't even use any of the four (apparently amazing) sauces that SoulFire offers at each table.  That being said, SoulFire manages to cater to my depressing palate while pleasing every other person I've ever gone there with.  The fried chicken, which is what I order without fail, is absolutely amazing.  It is moist and juicy, flavorful, and worth waiting the 20 or so minutes it takes to prepare (if you say you've never been to SoulFire and you order this meal, they will warn you about a delay because it takes a while).  I have also witnessed the enjoyment of the pulled pork, baby back ribs, spare ribs, and all of the various sides.  Mac and cheese is a favorite (it has a little bit of BBQ potato chips crumbled on top!), and the gravy for the mashed potatoes could be sold wholesale for quite a profit.  The cornbread has been a source of a fight or two when there is only one piece left.  My fiance and I enjoy the food so much that we are having it served at our upcoming wedding.SoulFire does lose a star, however, on the staffing/service side of things.  It's not bad, not necessarily even mediocre, but it's hit or miss.  Sometimes the waitstaff can be inattentive or slow, but sometimes they're great.  Sometimes, when the place is very busy and we've had to wait for a table, the staff seem slow to turn over tables and seat customers efficiently.  It's not enough to make us stop going, not by a long shot, but I couldn't in good conscience give the place a perfect rating when I know that sometimes I walk out of there very full but not totally psyched."},{"name":"Tia's Waterfront","address":"200 Atlantic Ave, Fl 1","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"This place is really close to the waterfront, which I make import of mentioning preemptively, likely for the same reason that the aforementioned addendum was suffixed to the name of this establishment, because it is the only redeeming quality of its existence.

Yes, Ramen Tatsu-Ya is that delicious; you'll notice that when you see the line out  the door. The wait is never that bad, maybe 15-20 minutes. You can order sake or beer while you wait too so that's a plus. The menu is pretty standard for ramen food, a good mix of additions.

I recommend #2, delicious.There's plenty of seating but the servers place you so you may get lucky and get your own table or have to sit at a long table with other patrons. It's not bad, but if you plan on having an intimate conversation and not worry about people eavesdropping, then Ramen Tatsu-Ya is not your place.Parking is fine as their are plenty of other restaurants in the same shopping area (Din-Ho, Pho Van, Coco's, Sunflower, etc.) So don't be too scared if the parking lot is kind of full, all those restaurants have plenty of patrons but the wait for Ramen Tatsu-ya is worth it."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Border Cafe gets an applause from me.

Even the hot and sour soup has lost its robust flavor. It has some spicyness, but has lost the full body flavor it used to have. The lemon chicken has a thick breaded crust with very little lemon tang. The service and ambiance are still excellent, but the food quality and flavor are a real disappointment."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Where I live in Connecticut, there isn't much for authentic Ramen, but on my vacation in Austin, Tatsu-Ya was top of my list of restaurants to visit.

The Ramen, though...just incredible.  The broth was both full of flavor and filling.  The noodles were thinner than I expected, but delicious.  The pork - oh man, the pork.

The chicken bao had a generous piece of fried chicken breast, julienned onions and carrots, scallions and an aioli. I added Sriracha because what is life without it. Veggie bao had big juicy mushrooms (that perhaps should have been sliced; they all fell out after one bite) and was slathered in a ginger-peanut sauce. Kimchi fries featured pork belly and a sweet hoisin-type sauce.A question for the experts though -- are the actual bao buns supposed to be cold? Everywhere I've eaten one, they were, including here... which results in the rest of the sammy getting pretty cold quickly. Guys, I want a warm bao!

I made a reservation for 8, and the host(s) were very accommodating of our large party.  They even baked a chocolate cake on site for us, allowing us to avoid lugging a cake into Boston.  It was $5 a person for the cake.   The first thing you notice when you enter Masa is the gigantic drink list containing various unique margaritas, bloody mary's, and mojitos.  I am more of a beer type of guy, but everyone I was with enjoyed their cocktails.  My wife liked the raspberry mojito in particular.  I liked the fact that they had Allagash White ale on tap as well.  For appetizers, 3 people got the Southwestern Caprese Salad w/\\nTomatoes, Avocado, Queso Blanco, Paprika Oil, Balsamic Glaze.  They all enjoyed it.  I got the Spicy Tuna Tartare.  It was much spicier than I expected, but it was really good.  For dinner I got the Negro Modelo braised pork shoulder.  The waiter recommended this as a popular option.  It was pretty good, but I wish I had gotten the cowboy cut steaks or swordfish.  My wife got the cowboy cut NY strip.  It was delicious.  For dessert, as I said above, Masa prepared a chocolate cake for us.  As is their MO, they did their own unique spin on it.  The cake had a harder shell-like chocolate icing on top, and between the two layers of cake, there were small slices of pineapple.  Certainly different for a double chocolate cake, but everyone enjoyed it.

They are giant and really tasty actually. I typically always get the chips and queso of course. Today I ventured outside the box and just went for the nachos since it takes care of my melted cheese and chips and queso issue. It was pretty awesome-tastic. Except I probably could have used more queso, the cheese to chip ratio today was low. But over all it was really filling and good. The price for the amount of food that I got was awesome too. The line was fairly long at this location during lunch hours but for the most part it moved pretty quickly. The parking lot can get a little crazy too here during lunch. There's a lot of surrounding businesses here. I did notice like a reverse lunch rush here. It was very busy around 11:30-11:50 and the line was empty at around 12:10-12:15 strange to me, since I assume most people go to lunch at 12:00. Either way the wait isn't too bad anyways.

I had never seen escargot presented like this as they were nice big chunks with big slices of bread to go with them. I also liked that the sauce on it favored more towards savory instead of some of the lemon and butter sauces that I am used to. It really made for a nice change of pace. The cru du mer was wonderful. The crab meat just killed it and I couldn't get enough of the trout roe. For my entree I decided to have the Idaho trout. This ended up being an insanely awesome decision on my part. Not only was there a healthy portion of trout, it looked amazing. Thankfully its taste held up to its looks with the sauce having a nice spice kick to it.

Disappointment is really what it comes down to.  The brisket was dry and somewhat lacking in flavor.  The chicken was also very dry with so-so flavor.  The ribs were decent but far from high on the list compared to many other local and semi-local places.  You do get a good amount with the ribs, though.  The fries came out cold and soggy for the two of us who ordered them.  My coleslaw was fine.  The mac and cheese was a little bland.The ambiance was appropriate for a Texas BBQ joint and we didn't have much of a wait - which surprised us on a Friday at dinner time - but this is likely because there was no music going on when we arrived and the food just wasn't that good.  We hung around for a bit until the show started and had some drinks throughout.  Drink prices were good considering the location (soda, beer, and booze).  The sound was solid for the show, though it was so packed as a sold out show that we couldn't get to a decent spot for my wife to see anything (she is short).

I didn't find it at all appealing; the padron peppers for $8 consisted of about 6 oversized peppers that were just OK; the dessert waffle was only about the size of a very small bread plate for $8) at too high prices.  It's a noisy damned place but not because of loud heavy rock music as some reviews complained.  Yes, there was some music playing but not loudly enough to even identify the genre, let alone complain about.  But it was so crowded that to converse yelling was necessary.  So go for the fries and beer but go somewhere else to actually eat your meal because sadly at La Moule you're not gonna get much value for your money.  Tiny, tiny portions (other than the fries) at exorbitant prices.  Food beyond the fries is OK but not stellar."},{"name":"Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This was really close to five stars. Really, really, close. First of all, this place was packed. I had to park on the street and walk to the restaurant. Parking could really use an improvement. Then we we had a 35 minute or so wait to be seated. It was slightly earlier than prime supper time, and when we walked out the wait looked significantly longer. The service was attentive over all. Yes, the food was a bit slower than I am used to but it wasn't overly bad. There was one point that our drinks got empty but the server was busy taking another large tables' order. There are hiccups in the service, but it has a lot more to do with the place being packed out then the servers themselves. My biggest complaint outside of the food was the noise level. The place is small and packed so I understand the talking noise, but the music over the top of all of that made it seem like you had to yell to converse over the table. Not exactly what I want while I am eating with friends or family. Eating on the patio seems like a better idea, but there was a pretty significant threat of rain on the day that I went. Then there is the food. I ordered half and half fried pickles and jalape√±os as an appetizer. The fried jalape√±os were a bit too hot for a few at the table but I enjoyed them. They faltered when put up against the fried pickles though. Those things were amazing. The best fried pickles I've had, anywhere, hands down, and I mean that. The buttermilk ranch dipping sauce was great as well. The main course was a combination of beef brisket and chicken. I am not a brisket expert. In Georgia it is hard to find beef based BBQ so I have really only had it at one other place. I can't compare it to other places, but I have to say I really really loved this stuff. Much better than the one other place I had it. It was delicious. The chicken was the best 'smoked' variety chicken I've had in Atlanta. They got the spices perfect. This place clearly knows meat.The sides for me were baked beans and brunswick stew. The baked beans were great, but the brunswick stew had several chunks of potato in it that I felt detracted from the flavor. I just wish those potatoes were cut up into much smaller chunks. It wasn't bad brunswick stew but there was enough of those potatoes that it kept popping into my mind. My biggest issue for the food, and what mostly prevented this from hitting five stars was the sauce. The BBQ sauce that is bottled at the table isn't great nor bad. There is just nothing memorable there. It isn't overpowering when you put it on the meat which is nice but Ive had far far better sauces. One member of my party ordered a beef short rib that came with a horseradish BBQ sauce. It got passed around the table to unanimously negative reviews. The horseradish was just far too prevalent in the sauce. It totally ruined it. I did get a white BBQ sauce with my brisket that was very very good though, and I was glad that I could use it over the bottled sauce at the table.So the meat is five star quality. The minor complaints and the sauces weigh in and bring it down a notch. Great bbq."},{"name":"Papa Razzi Concord","address":"768 Elm St","city":"Concord","stars":"3.5","text":"Manager took me in a minute before close.  Service was excellent.

And the cannoli is one of the best I've had at a restaurant.  I haven't had anything that I wouldn't recommend.I think the main reason this place has remained a reliable staple in the area is because it is family-owned and family-run.  They seem to really take pride in what they serve and how they maintain the restaurant.  Unlike a corporate chain restaurant that is run by impersonal management with no real personal stake in the business, Bambinelli's stands out from the crowd with a truly exceptional staff and food.This is not a fancy place, but it is clean and attractive.  It is suited for an intimate dinner, but can also accomodate larger groups with ease.  Everything seems to work like clockwork here, and I always leave happy...counting the days until I find myself craving pesto ravioli again.

I was so excited to see this coming our way, because I feel like we have still not recovered from the terrible events of January 6, 2009... now there is another spot in our neighborhood for meeting friends and hanging out over a mug, a pitcher, a game of pool, a burger, a burger salad, a slushie, a shaft... A friend and I came out tonight for the inaugural evening, and although Tasty Burger was slammed, we enjoyed frosty cold mugs of beer, and hot, delicious dinners.  I enjoyed an organic chicken sandwich, \\"Buffalo\\" style.  It was steaming hot, the chicken not overly cooked and thus juicy.  It was treated with a tangy hot sauce which just might have been Frank's Red Hot (if the extra bottle on the table was an indicator) and creamy bleu cheese.  Yum.  Did I mention how crunchy the batter on the chicken was?  And it was organic!  Hallelujah!  A sesame bun rounded it out.  Yum.  My dining companion feasted on a hamburger salad, which is exactly what it sounded like: a burger patty and the requisite baby salad greens, etc.  She was somewhat taken aback by the abbreviated salad dressing list (Italian or blue cheese) but recovered and ordered the Italian.  She said the burger was fantastic.  We were happy.Mugs of beer are brought to you icy, and at $5 for a Harpoon IPA, or $5.50 Hoegaarden or Stella, pretty reasonable.  I saw that they offer an assortment of cans of beer, which you could buy in quantity, but I couldn't quite figure it out.  Definitely available are pitchers of beer.  There is also a nice listing of wines.I liked the spice racks, er tiny lazy susan's, on the tables, featuring Frank's, Lee Kum Kee Sriracha, mustard, ketchup, relish, salt &  pepper.

When I was able to get a Sunday off for a local convention and saw that Screen Door offered brunch on the weekends, we attempted to go. Alas, the line was once again around the block. We went to the convention and came back at about 1:30pm and no line! Just a small wait in the waiting area.We had to option of sitting outside, which we preferred, and luckily was seated there. The outside area was covered and had clear plastic separating the dining area from the sidewalk. It would have been nice to have a more open air seating area, but oh well.The brunch menu is very short, with fairly standard breakfast fare but done with uniqueness. The chicken and waffles had a sweet potato waffle for example. I opted for biscuits and sausage gravy with soft scrambled eggs as I tend to rate a breakfast restaurant on this specific item. Clara got a breakfast poboy. From the description it sounded almost like a hash on bread: andouille sausage, fried egg, crispy onion straws, and tomato jam on bread. Clara and I decided to give each other half of our meal.They wait for the food was a bit longer than expected, but the waiter was very attentive and came by our table very often. The anticipation of the meal grew every time another table was served mounds of delicious looking sustenance. Finally our food arrived. The biscuits were shaped in rectangles and weren't cut out, which is fine with me as they were some of the best biscuits I've ever had. The gravy was definitely made to order with several large chucks of sausage. The eggs were perfectly soft scrambled (the first time correctly done since I started ordering them this way) however could have at least had some salt and pepper added when cooked. Clara's poboy, however, was the hit. A nice slab of andouille sausage, not chunks, a perfectly cooked fried egg, so much so that when you grabbed the sandwich, the yolk streamed out onto the plate, the crispy onions were made in house, not those yucky French's ones, and the tomato jam was very flavorful even against the spicy sausage. Clara commented that if she were to buy a poboy like that in New Orleans it would cost way more than what our meal cost here.Our bill came to less than $30 for some of the best food we've had.

Overall it is an okay place to dine or hang out, but I won't become a regular."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya has been on Heather F's to try list for sometime and their vegetarian ramen only served on Sundays has been on mine so we finally made a date to give them a try. The History.\\nThe chefs/owners Tatsu Aikawa and Takyua Matsumoto have worked at such places as Musashino. They opened September 2012 making them the first brick and mortar ramen restaurant in the area. The Line.\\nConsidering they have been opened 10 months and the line still wraps around the building is a testament of their loyal following and undeniable popularity. Although the line was long we did luck out weather wise with an overcast sky and a nice breeze. A couple brought their own sake purchased at the neighboring market to pre game while in line.  We got in line at 6:30 pm., ordered around 7:30 ish and our food arrived about 10 minutes later. 2 stars.Ambiance.\\nWhen you walk in the first thing you notice is the cool Japanese inspired art on the walls and noodle like fixtures hanging from the ceiling. Secondly you notice the loud music which is a reminder that the chefs/owners are former DJs. The seating arrangements are communal giving it a true authentic feel of a ramen restaurant in Japan. 5 stars.Drinks.\\nThey serve Austin Beer Works beer as well as Japanese beers. There is also sake but booo no wine. I ordered the Hitachino White Ale from Kiuchi Brewery that was approved for import in Texas just a couple months ago. It was an excellent light beer, great for drinking in the summer heat and it went well with ramen. 3 stars.The Ramen.\\nI ordered the vegetarian ramen with aji-tama (marinated boiled egg) and spicy bomb. The noodles were thick and perfectly cooked. The bowl was chock full of delicious veggies to include crisp Brussels sprouts, bamboo, fresh spinach, corn and onions. The dish also had tofu and was topped with Korean chillies. The broth itself tasted very clean but bland without the addition of the spicy bomb. If you are vegetarian or want a healthier option I do recommend their Sunday veggie ramen otherwise my bet is the traditional broth is the way to go. 3.5 stars, rounding down to 3 stars overall.Improvements.\\nIt is hard to ding them for the line/wait simply because they are that popular but it could be a deterrent. If they could sell drinks while customers wait they would easily pocket more money and make for happier customers.  I can tell these folks work really hard, even one of the chefs was delivering food. But when there were a couple things that needed fixing it was hard to waive someone down. I recommend having a dedicated employee to check on guests.Tips.\\n1. You will wait in line so dress accordingly. 2. They will not sell alcoholic drinks for you to consume outside while you wait but you can bring your own.3. If you want to take home leftovers BYOC(ontainer) as they do not provide to go containers. I was sad to literally leave a half bowl of ramen.4. They keep cold water in a cooler near the door, make sure to stay hydrated in line.I like Ramen Tatsu-Ya but there are other excellent ramen shops in Austin where you do not have to wait an hour. But if you have the time and can embrace the wait, it is a fun experience.  I intend to go back and try their munchie katsu slider and pan seared pork gyoza."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

I'm not sure if this has to do with the fact that we were shoved to the basement :( I read in another review that upstairs had more options, maybe I'll go back, hopefully I don't get pushed to the basement again. In general, the food were more greasy than your average dim sum. I thought the sticky rice, chicken feet, tripe, and the bean curd rolls were pretty good. The shrimp dumplings were disappointing though. The price was average for dim sum, we paid about $25 for the two of us. Is anything a \\"small\\" item anymore?

I will give this restaurant if you want to call it that a \\"single\\" star. You want an honest review your better off saving yourself a lot of money by going to a KFC, Popeyes, or Boston Market! For starters the appetizers are canned fruit cocktail and tuna salad on a \\"single\\" cracker. There's only 1 choice for your children, which is Foster Farm chicken nuggets with no dipping sauce and Kraft Mac n Cheese. As for adult meals I can't rate the beef as my husband and I both chose the bone dried chicken served with Stove Top rice and frozen bland veggies. The chicken was so dry, my husband had asked our waitress for Tobasco sauce or even A1 to help the flavor and dryness of the chicken. They only serve you 2 varieties of soda which are Pepsi and Sprite. Not even ice water. The beer served with dinner is Budweiser. The highlight of the meal is the Betty Crocker brownie topped with chocolate syrup and canned whip cream! Forgetting to mention the salad has nothing in it besides a few olives which is disgusting. The Campbell's tomato soup is also terrible. Especially when you can literally see small clumps of flour they left in it, which was likely used to thicken the soup. Lastly you are required to pay $5 for parking which I didn't mind compared to the required tip they charge. Which is $5 from each adult, and $3 per each child! The performance was decent nothing spectacular, but the performers were very nice, helpful and friendly. So I'd suggest if your really considering trying this place. I'd highly suggest you think twice! I'm giving you a true honest review so if you do decide to go here.

Regretfully, I didn't partake in as much all-you-can-eat action as I would have liked, nevertheless, I did enjoy the chicken kaarage, oyster motoyaki, nigiris, inaris, and scallop temakis.Service was quick and snappy, tea cups never empty and constantly being refilled.

It ended up being quite delicious, and the pairings added a great note. From Bone Marrow Salad to Home Made Gram cracker Desert, everything tasted amazing. Now I would usually leave it at that, and wouldn't even bother with a review, as I normally don't take the time review anything unless I've been extremely unsatisfied and want to warn everyone else. But, I felt the need to change it up this time and write a positive review. As we sat eating at our table enjoying each others company and indulging ourselves in a beer from the previous course, our waiter begun prepping the table for the next course. The first thing to come out was the beer. As he was making his rounds dropping off beer in front of each of us, he accidentally tipped over the tray filled with cup fulls of beer he was carrying in his hand. And to my luck, he was directly over my shoulder, so the beer spilled all over this all white polo I was wearing. Now mistakes happen to everyone, and I know the waiter felt really bad, and so did the hostess. I got up, luckily had a change of shirt in the car, but returned to rise my shirt in the bathroom as to not stain it. As I stood up, not only did the hostess stop me, but requested that I give her my shirt so that they could dry clean it on them. I obliged, and returned to my meal. A few minutes later, the hostess came back and gave me a gift certificate, and a pack of La-Moule T-shirts for the whole table. After a week, I received a phone call from the hostess (Valerie), and she let me know that my dry cleaning was done, but her fine tuned eyes could not get away from a slight brown stain that remained on the shirt from the beer. She wanted to replace my shirt. I told her that she could wait until I set my own eyes on it, cause sometimes we can't unsee things if we're \\"told\\" to not look for it. She insisted on replacing it even so, requested my home address, and shipped it directly to my home. She even told me to come pick up the shirt anyways and keep it, so now I have a back up. I was ecstatic with my experience and the type of proactive customer service I received from Valerie and the people at La Moule. This experience paired with great food, is well deserving of the 5 stars here on Yelp. I would gladly recommend this place to a friend and plan on returning soon. -Cheers"},{"name":"No Mas!

I heard nothing but good things about the Oakwood and funny enough a guy who works in the same building as me said he has a friend that is a chef here and suggested it highly. I was told that this place is a sharing restaurant where you order a few different things and try them together instead of getting an entree each and what not so I didn't know how that was going to turn out because I felt it might come off more like an appetizer meal rather than a dinner. That didn't end up being a problem as most of the plates were pretty filling. We tried the:\\nBuratta cheese : Extremely salty and it overpowered the delicious sauce (wouldn't suggest)Albacore Tuna : Perfeclty seared on the outside with the inside being perfectly raw, it melted in our mouths. The sauces it came with were.. interesting but it was good.Warm Kale Salad : One of the best salads I've had anywhere..it's was absolutely amazing. I'd suggest this and would come back just for it! The sauce was perfect.12 Hour tri-tip : This one is only big enough to share between 1-2 people but it ended up being filling. The tri-tip was cooked perfectly and the potato foam/curried romanesco were a delightful combination. The restaurant is nice but it's a bit dark for my liking.

The wonton noodle soup: barely any broth. The wontons were just spiced pork rolled up in a wonton wrapper, not a fresh vegetable to be seen. I can forgive these things, but I can't forgive the fact that the noodles, the most important part for me, were reminiscent of overcooked instant ramen noodles: fat, soggy, and flavourless. Where are my thin, al dente noodles? This was a huge disappointmentThe \\"spicy\\" black pepper beef: no spice to be found, not even salt. The dish came and was about 60% onions, 20% green peppers, and MAYBE 20% beef. I ordered beef, not onions. The chicken fried rice: how can you mess up chicken fried rice? Barely any salt. Almost completely flavourless, with tiny springy bits of chicken scattered throughout. Terrible texture. As though, instead of frying the rice, they took freshly-made steamed rice, tossed it with oil, some frozen peas, and chicken from a can. It's all technically edible, but wow I have never been so underwhelmed by take out (and I have eaten my fair share of underwhelming take out)."},{"name":"Times Irish Pub & Restaurant","address":"112 Broad St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"This place is great.

They've had a bit of a shaky transition, but there's a strong devotion to flavor and quality that has permeated every item.  The broth here in the ramen puts it FAR ahead of other local Ramen establishments that can't quite get the pork flavor down and instead taste a bit bitter or bland.  Rather than just conventional green tea, they use a green tea with a nice jasmine flavor, in both hot or cold variants and it's awesome.  They've also recently switched to a \\"pay up front\\" waiting system which is far more efficient than before and puts this much more in line with their competition.  I should mention that this place is basically deserted most nights, yet has roomy clean tables, INSANELY fast service, good prices, and great ramen.   There are only two real quirks here.  One - is the music, which was strangely locked on Matchbox 20-type 90's music the first time, and Rave-Techno this last time.  I think the techno was slightly more suitable for ramen, but I'd maybe dial back the volume like 50% so it's not so intrusive.  The other quirk - the interior is distinctly western in design and actually feels a bit like an upscale hotel lobby.  There are no Japanese lanterns to be found, no kitsch, just super clean hotel-lobby vibes.  The light up sign on the ground out front is really cool and so is the store sign though.  I cannot subtract points for music when the ramen is this good, and the interior ambiance is still stellar since the place is so roomy and empty.   I hope business picks up here as it's difficult to find ramen of this quality in Austin without standing in line for 30 minutes (which I've done, and was NOT this good)."},{"name":"Hunan Pearl","address":"15160 SW Bangy Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"This is best far one of the best restaurants in Portland.

First, let me start with the food. I love the variety of dishes that they have and the food is always warm or hot when served, as they should be. Flavor is great and the price is more than decent. Second, although you'll probably run into a fatty line outside, don't worry, the turn around time is fairly quick. I have never waited for more than 15 minutes with a big group. Third, they have a nice decor which makes the food even more appetizing. One of my biggest pet peeves is walking into a restaurant in chinatown where they have ugly decorations and dirty tables/utensils. When you pay, one thing that you might notice is that they don't really \\"ring you up\\" at their cash register. They add up the total themselves...and you might wonder how the heck they calculated the tax. From what I've seen, they have a tax table on the back of their carbon paper pad, which gives them rough estimates. The reason for the minus star....well, they have a few tables on the main level where the floor is elevated; therefore, the dim sum carts aren't able to be pushed next to the unlucky customers sitting there. The customers must get up every time to walk to the carts...ANNOYING!

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:  La Moule opens PROMPTLY at 5 PM...not a minute before - even if there are 8 people anxiously awaiting to get in.  They also DO NOT accept reservations (except for special-occasions - Like Valentine's Day) ~ You're welcome.We were the first 2 of the 8 waiting to get in...And even though we waited for 10 minutes - once inside, it was truly worth the wait!!La Moule has an easy vibe.  Very low-key.  The decor is nothing flashy OR boring.  The lighting is good - but not so bright you have to squint to see!  The overall feel for me was very romantic...Perhaps that is because I was on a date-night...but for me, that is how it felt.  The color scheme is black, white and grey.  The music was a bit too loud and not really my choice or taste (New Wave/Alternative??)  I would have preferred just instrumental (it just seems less intrusive). No biggie though.We were promptly seated in the bar room dining area.  We got the corner window seat!  It was an amazing seat!!  Our server was very helpful and informative.  My husband and I had never been here before and she was kind enough to tell us about the dishes we were planning to order.  Everything is a la carte.  However, we were sharing (THANK GOD!) because we wanted to sample more than one of the tasty items on the menu.  We started out with the Steak Tartar & Bone Marrow with Quail Egg.  Oh my holy taste buds!  I have had steak tartar before but nothing as tasty as this.  Paired with the fatty deliciousness of the bone marrow & quail egg, this appetizer tasted like Heaven in my mouth!!!  Seriously, if I had not been dressed up and had all my proper & skilled table manners going on last night, I would have picked up that chunk of bone and licked that baby clean dry AND I would have done the same to the tasting board it was served on...feeling NO SHAME...whatsoever!!!  DON'T JUDGE ME.We also ordered the Mussels Mariniere.  The portion was huge!  I hate when I order mussels that have been overcooked (CHEWY PIECES of RUBBER!)  All of the mussels served were plump and cooked to perfection!  The broth (butter, wine, capers, lemon) was divine!  The only thing I would want more of for this bowl of deliciousness would be a plate of crusty bread to sop all the broth instead of just 1 slice!  We asked our server for more bread and she was kind enough to bring us a chunk...but there was still broth leftover after we had consumed the chunk of bread she brought.Our final order was the burger & fries.  The burger...Oh my...Where do I begin.  You wanna talk about an elevated burger.  This burger was ground chuck, it had  a thick-cut slice of smoky bacon (WHICH THEY HAD FORGOTTEN TO PUT ON THE BURGER and HAD TO BRING IT OVER with an apology from the chef!) and triple (yes, TRIPLE!!!) cream brie on a brioche bun and a small side of pickled red onions and gherkins.  We like our burgers pretty rare...Even though there wasn't much cook on the moo, all the other ingredients paired so well together that upon taking the first bite everything meshed together so well it was just one amazing bite!  The fries come in a boat, cut in shoe strings style and served with house-made aioli.  In my opinion, a burger AND fries is more than enough for 2 people to share!!We ordered beer(s) for our food pairings.  We ordered the Unibroue Blanche De Chambly and the Karmeliet Triple.  Both of which were delicious in their own styles (Unibroue - Witbier and Karmeliet - Belgian Triple).  Both score high on Beer Advocate (90 & 94).  We are huge fans of Belgian & German-Styled beer.  We were extremely happy to find a place the actually serves these styles on tap!!!  And the prices were pretty decent for the pour size, as well ($6 & $8).  They have a nice selection for on tap AND bottled beers.  The prices vary but I think are priced nicely for what you're ordering (hence:  \\"you get what you pay for\\").The restaurant is very clean, efficient & thoughtfully well-placed and nicely staffed.  My one complaint and this is more of a suggestion than a complaint...If you're going to have a \\"UNIVERSAL\\" bathroom, please put in toilet seat covers.  I am a germ-a-phobe and having to go to the bathroom after a man (who happened to be my husband AND he didn't bother put the seat down...OR wipe the rim clean!!!) it is a little gross.  The prices are good for what you're ordering.  Our total bill was $71 for everything we had.  My overall (first-time!!) experience at La Moule was AMAZING.  I am hoping to have many future dates here and I truly look forward to trying the other menu offerings...Maybe dessert the next time!?!?!I would highly recommend La Moule to anyone and I THANK YOU for the wonderful service & food!"},{"name":"The Arlington Restaurant & Diner","address":"134 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3","text":"I ordered a take out order over the phone for a large coffee and omelette with toast and home fries.

But note that this place does offer a lot of relatively inexpensive items.  Ordered two platters, one with pulled pork and baby back ribs, and the other with chopped brisket and spare ribs. All of the good was good. Personally I prefer bbq with sauces cooked on and carmelized. Here everything is smoked, so all of the meat was very dry, and you then have to add your own sauces.  While I enjoyed my pulled pork and baby back ribs, I thought the spare ribs looked extremely fatty and I had no desire to try them. My boyfriend did like them. The chopped brisket was surprisingly good, and did not taste at all like what i expected. Note that they do not have a full bar, only beer and wine. If I lived in the area, I would probably go back, even without a groupon. However, since I do not, I would rather spend my money at Texas Roadhouse instead, since I think their bbq is a lot better.

Definitely impressed by the simple and eclectic decor. Modern but doesn't feel like it's trying too hard to be fancy.The waiters were very well trained and knowledgable. My friend had the steak and I had the duck. The cook was perfect and the seasoning on the steak was good too.The Maine lobster appetizer I had was a major disappointment for the night, as well as the desserts. The lobster was rubbery and though it tasted decent, it was nowhere near as tender as butter braised lobster should be. The warm cheesecake had way much nuts on it that it overpowered the experience of eating a nice creamy, rich cheesecake.I tasted my friends apple tart and it looked and tasted fairly bland. For mid-tier restaurant these might be ok appetizers and desserts but when you are paying top-dollar at a pricey restaurant, it gets a little when the dishes don't amaze you. I would have expected richer more decadent dessert options and a much better appetizer lobster.The overall experience was nice but I can get just as good service with better food and larger portions at other restaurants that are still cheaper than Aria.

My biggest complaint: $1 for the spicy bomb! I put the whole thing in my bowl and it was still not spicy enough. I can put as much chili sauce in my food as I want in any Asian restaurant for FREE! Is the $1 just a scheme to make us want to try the darn thing, just like the ridiculous line made us want to try this place out?Overall, their food was still pretty good for the price.

Ramen Tatsu-Ya has no bar and there is no room to wait inside.  In fact, you can't even go inside and order a beer and drink it outside while waiting in line thanks to permit restrictions.

Perhaps you should bring your own \\"water\\" to drink while waiting in line.If you are at the front of the line outside you have to watch for the inside of the line through the glass front door that is ordering their food to go down.  Once it goes down you can go inside and wait to place your food order (counter order style).  What this means is that in essence you are waiting in 2 lines.   Once inside you have the option of beer or sake to drink while waiting in the 2nd line.  Ramen Tatsu-Ya has no wine.There are a couple of appetizers on the menu but mostly ramen soup.  Note that ALL their soups are made with a meat stock so even if you remove the actual meat from the ramen you will have meat in your broth.  The only option for vegetarian is Sunday.  This is unfortunate.  When you are standing in the 2nd line you will get a number and you will be told where you will sit.  If you are unfortunately sitting under one of the many high powered ceiling fans be aware that your ramen will cool down very quickly.  I wasn't even half way through my bowl of ramen before it was stone cold thanks to the ceiling fan.  Not a good set up.I like the hip hop music that was playing on Sunday but it was WAY too loud.  Amy D (who went with me) kept asking me to repeat myself when I was talking with her.Since you don't have a waiter or waitress understand that if you need something you will have to flag somebody down or walk back up to the counter.  I had placed an order for 2nd noodles and had to flag somebody down to get them.  They put a paperclip on my order number when I originally ordered the noodles so I thought this meant some sort of system was in place where they would know to bring the noodles out but they did not.  This place is A-OK but not worth the hype."},{"name":"Saffron","address":"3616 Far W Blvd, Ste 113","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I seem to have had a different experience than many of my fellow Yelpers.

I have been to all the BBQ hotspots (Salt Lick, Louie Mueller, Opies, Kreutz, Blacks, etc.) and I would say the brisket is around the top 3.  Louie Mueller still has the best brisket in my opinion.  So as I was waiting in the long line, I wondered if the wait would be worth it since I could just drive to Taylor, eat some Louie Mueller and head back before I would even eat at Franklin.  After I tried it, the answer is definitely not.  If the line was shorter, or better yet faster then I would  make regular visits since it is close.  They also have long lines and sell out fast but they have a better system to accommodate customers.  I guess what makes this place cool is it's in the heart of Austin and it has great brisket. Tasted good but thought it was cheating to watch them dunk the turkey in a big bucket of melted butter before slicing and \\nserving.

Located in a very unassuming strip mall, Ramen Tatsu-ya is like a hidden gem that can easily be missed from the main road. Yes, there was somewhat of a line out the door even on a Wednesday night (I believe some of it was due to SXSW vacationers), but we were lucky enough to beat most of the crowd just by a little bit. They have menu's posted outside their walls to facilitate decision making processes with regards to type of broth, add-ons, dessert or not, drinks etc... I was ecstatic to learn that they have a chicken based broth option as well as a vegetarian one.  Whether you are craving their original hearty pork-based broth, or something different with their chicken or vegetarian broth, Ram Tatsuya is a cut above other ramen restaurants who mostly offer pork-based broth. The hus-bae ended up ordering their original pork-based ramen and I opted for the chicken-based bowl. So hearty and oh so fulfilling, my mouth and tongue were immersed in an exciting sensation of flavors and textures that only a good bowl of ramen can deliver. I would say their noodles, for me, were the most satisfying part of the entire dish; delightfully chewy with just the right amount of bite. I added on corn, fried tofu, swirled fish-cakes and their 5-chilli blend chilli bomb. The chilli-bomb for me was not at all hot. Next time I think I will try their habanero-based bomb. The combinations are endless, so take your time and definitely take advantage of their numerous add-on options. They have a few mixed drinks as well as a variety of other canned and bottled drink options. We had a great first-time experience here and we would definitely recommend putting this place on your check-list of things to do if you are ever in the Austin area."},{"name":"Smashburger","address":"1298 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"3","text":"I went to this place twice this summer, both visits was great experience to me, place was clean, waiter/casher was friendly, most importantly their food was great, I ordered classic smashburger and smash fries.

C3 Presents owns and runs the entire joint, so huge applause to them for brilliantly combining great live music and delicious Texas bar-b-q!As a venue, Stubb's is great, 5 stars, hands down.  Indoor stage is super cozy, sound is great, and it doesn't permeate the entire restaurant so if you just want to sit down and eat with your family, don't worry.  The stage is downstairs, next to a billiards room and with its own bar.  The music crowd won't bother you much.  The outdoor stage is huge, and an epic stage for performers who come through ATX.  Multiple outdoor bars and the VIP deck upstairs make it nice and convenient.  Great noise, and the staff working shows is AWESOME.  They make the artists feel at home and run the door so smooth.  Seamless operation.As a restaurant, Stubb's is great as well, but you have to understand.. in the capital of the best bar-b-q state in the nation, we have to be a little picky.  The brisket is delicious, and the mac and cheese is the creamiest I've had.  I think the brisket is the standout on the menu, everything else is good, but the chef makes it pretty safe.  The sauce is where it's at, though.  Stubb's sauce is a food orgasm.  They even sell it at the restaurant to take home, and it's sold in lots of stores in Texas, including HEB, Whole Foods, and Randall's.  Anything can be great if it's smothered in Stubb's sauce!!They have a full bar with one small tv, but it serves the purpose, and really, this place is about music, not sports or tv shows.  Tap selection rotates, but has local brews on tap, and always good.  I've been to Stubb's for over 50 shows during my college years here, and I frequent the restaurant monthly.

We had a reservation and only had to wait five or so minutes to be seated. Our waiter came over and introduced himself, and we were each given a water. We waited at least 20 minutes to order our drinks and another 15 minutes before we all had our cocktails. We had to ask the gentleman serving water to find our waiter. Once we had our drinks, we again had to wait at least another 20 minutes before we were able to order our food. About another 20 minutes or so after we ordered our food, we were brought cornbread to snack on after we asked twice. By now we had been in the restaurant for nearly an hour and a half and still did not have our entr√©es. Another 10 minutes or so we were finally brought our food and we could finally eat. I had the fried chicken and mac and cheese, both of which were quite good. The food, however, could not make up for the continued poor service. The waiter again was relatively slow to bring us our check after we had dessert. There were 7 of us, and to simplify things we split the check down the middle. To make up for the the fact some had drinks while others did not, those who had drinks tipped for those who didn't. The waiter looked at some of the receipts in front of us, and questioned why some did not tip. I have never seen a waiter do this before. Had he looked at ALL of them, he would have seen he still received a decent tip from those who ordered drinks and tipped extra to make up for the even split check. To top things off, when we went outside to get our cars from the valet, I noticed that my car had been pulled up, doors wide open, because the valet man had somehow mixed up my car and brought it up for someone else. The other family told the valet man this wasn't his car and I said it was mine. He did not even apologize for the fact he was ready to send my car off with someone else!

A remodeled warehouse in the heart of old East Austin, the design is very nicely done - industrial, but still approachable, friendly, open and ample parking.The service was impeccable.  The hostess was welcoming, and our waiter, Cat, was amazing, very knowledgeable and friendly.The food was outstanding!  We started with the vegan chicharrones.  Oh my gosh, I can't describe how ridiculously good this was.  Tapioca bubbles that are fried and dusted with vegan bacon powder... I don't even know what that means, but I know they were delectable!  Paired with two house made fresh salsas, this is an excellent appetizer.  We also shared the walnut Caesar salad, which was delicious.  The flash-fried crispy parsley on top really balanced the subtle fishy flavor (not in a bad way!) of the dressing. You could easily make this a lunch entree by adding protein (they have three choices, I believe), but we had it plain.  The hubs had the beef tongue tacos for his entree.  Cat, the server, had explained their prep and described them as looking like beef jerky, but with the tenderness of good roast beef.  He did not disappoint - they were unbelievably tasty, served with fresh tortillas, escabeche, more fresh salsa, cotija cheese and house made creme fraiche.  This is definite recommend!  It's actually considered an appetizer and could easily be shared with others to start a meal.I had the redfish (today was snapper) and chips which were divine.  Served with house made (seeing the theme?  They get the details!) ketchup and garlic aioli (to die for!) and malt vinegar (a MUST with fish and chips - see previous reviews! lol) and scattered with additional crispy parsley and some crispy basil.  Yum!The restaurant generously 'bought' us dessert, so we tried the cocoa sorbet topped with Earl Grey foam.  I can't describe it well, but chocolate-y lightness that perfectly ended a fabulous meal.Lunch is a win here!  I'm sure dinner is just as wonderful, so we'll be back.

The prices of some things are a little on the high end, and it's definitely worth coming by during happy hour where food prices are half off, and cocktails are just $5 (this happens all night Tuesday & Wednesday, and from 4-7 pm MRF).I had the snapper ceviche, and it was gone pretty quickly. And have been able to try four cocktails so far, and they were also all great - La Ni√±a (strawberry rum, lime, simple, blackstrap rum, housemade ginger beer), Painkiller (navy rum, pineapple, housemade coconut cream, over shaved ice), Daiquiri (not frozen; rum, lime, simple syrup), and Isla Rum Smash\\n(spiced rum, simple syrup, tiki bitters, orange, cherry).

First off, I got to Franklin at around 9:45 this morning, I thought parking was going to be difficult but I found a spot right up front. The line wrapped around the building through the parking lot and to the complex next door. The two employees walked around and took orders to estimate how much meat they would have and about what time we would be served. They were telling us for my part of the line that we were guaranteed brisket and sausage but that pork and beef ribs (sold on Saturday only) they also were telling us 2:15-2:30 which we thought was a 2 hour or so wait but it was the actual time that they expected us to be up to being served. It was a long wait, we waited about 4 hours but luckily you meet friends in line and it's BYOB and they do have some camping chairs. When we finally got in the door which was around 2 PM the 2 girls told us that they still had pork ribs left. I ended up ordering a pound of brisket (moist and lean), a pound of pork ribs, half pound of pulled pork, 1/2 pound of sausage, a single of potato salad and a bourbon banana pie and a Big Red to quench the thirst. Everything was seasoned and smoked so well, it was delicious without any sauce, all the meats were so moist and tender, including the brisket was so tender, even the lean one, the ribs were easy to take apart from the bone and pulled pork was amazing. I enjoyed the potato salad as it was tangy and a little kick from the mustard and rich from the mayo. The bourbon banana pie was so good, taste the Bourbon first then the banana pudding and it had a nice textural contrast with the graham cracker crust and not too overly sweet. I'm really glad I decided to tough it out and wait, basically their whole operating hours but I have to say it is pretty worth it, but after 4 hours waiting in the open I am pretty exhausted."},{"name":"Bao Down","address":"12 Powell Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Went last night for the first time.

There's usually a good number of cart-server-ladies with a variety of goodies. You can't go wrong with what you're served here. It's very good (although I would say it's sometimes to an American standing.. It's different from HK) but I will admit that I don't like the doughy skin... but that's personal preference. My go-to steamer is the haa gao (sp?) or shrimp dumpling. Overall all of the dumplings are generally delicious. Also, they sell very popular Asian dishes like chicken feet, crab claws, fried rice, etc. So if you don't find yourself fancying dumplings there's so much more to pick from (you can ask for a menu also).I'd like to note that service is actually very good (in comparison to a number of American-Chinese establishments). Based on 20+ years of experience, I am ALWAYS treated well by the cart-ladies and waitstaff whereas the hosts/hostesses are much more annoying to deal with, but whatever.Although I've grown up and no longer rely on my parents' ability to communicate with the waitstaff/servers (because I can't speak Cantonese to save my life)...

Unfortunately, the center was cold when it was served to me, leaving me to contemplate that it may have possibly been microwaved, or that it had been sitting for a while before it was served to me.

We recently moved from Las Vegas to Portland and sadly we no longer have In-n-Out, the Habit, or Smash Burger :( So we decided to give Five Guys another chance, since the first time I had it back in Vegas I didn't think it was anything great. I ordered a little bacon cheeseburger and my boyfriend got a normal cheeseburger and we got fries too. First off, the buns are smashed, soggy, not toasted or anything. Looks like Wendy's or something. Second stupid thing, the cheese wasn't melted enough and still cold on the pieces sticking out. Not a huge deal, but I like my cheese melty! Third thing, my bacon was so thin and burnt that it was just flavorless crisps of grease, didn't even taste like bacon. Fourth thing, the burger patty itself was flavorless and kind of dry. I've had better frozen patties cooked at home. No juiciness, no fresh taste, nothing special.Lastly, the fries were smothered in salt and were soggy and gross. We didn't even eat them because they were so mushy and salty, so that was a waste. And why on earth are people saying this place is cheap?! It was 20 bucks for 2 cheeseburgers and a side of fries and 1 small drink, with one of the burgers being a little one. Not that I mind spending that kind of money, but I expect your food to be good or have something special about it! I'll go to killer burger in a heartbeat over this place and get a huge ass delicious burger and good fries and spend the same amount of money. Also this place is dirty. Who even likes peanuts?

Interesting enough, the executive chef Andreas M√ºller hails from Sweden; whoa, that's far from the deep south!*Setting*\\nRevival is in an old house situated right behind Twain's. The inside is decorated with perhaps pictures of Kevin Gillespie's family and some interesting knickknacks. It was rather loud in the place, not too thrilled about that.*Reservations*\\nYou can make them online or over the phone. Not a bad idea since Revival was full of folks when we went. *Service*\\nOur server was polite, helpful, and attentive. He did however mess up our bill at first which led to some confusion.*Food*\\nMost diners go with the family style option which is $42, not sure why the price isn't on the menu. You pick out an entree and a dessert, and the other two courses and sides are filled in by the Revival kitchen team. We went with the fried chicken ($14 if a la carte) which seems to be one of the most popular dishes. I was tempted by the bacon-beef-pork meatloaf, another time!The first course consisted of puff pastries filled with smoked trout and accompanied by pickled veggies. Very tasty. The next course was local kale salad with peaches, charred onions, fancy cheese, and boiled dressing. I love kale so I was very content with this salad course, though I would suggest adding more peaches to the towering mound of greens. The fried chicken was commendable, with a crispy seasoned (reminded me some of KFC, possible blasphemy on my part?) exterior and moist interior. The white meat wasn't as good as the dark meat, just my opinion. Mmm, dark meat.There were lots of sides. They included fatback-friend silver queen fried corn, dirty rice, field peas and butter beans in sweet cream butter with dill, hickory-smoked local greens, and green cabbage with confit ham. I liked the corn the best. It resembled grits in texture and was delicious. And cornbread was set down too. I wasn't a huge fan of the cornbread since it wasn't corny enough for me. White on the inside, not yellow as you'd expect.For dessert, I ordered the peanut butter oreo pie ($7 a la carte). I also had some of the fried peach pie with almond ice cream. great! The oreo filling bottom layer of the pie got a little lost, but the chocolate cookie crust and smooth peanut butter filling were marvelous. Oh man!*Drinks*\\nI almost considered not ordering a cocktail since I wasn't exactly in love with the one I picked out at Gunshow. But I went for it anyway and was really charmed by the Honeysuckle ($11). Described as \\"Rum. Honey. Lime, Elderflower. Honeysuckle,\\" I was concerned it would be too sweet, but the Honeysuckle wasn't too cloying at all, just right. Yummy. Perfectly refreshing and summery.*Parking*\\nEither street it or resort to the \\"complimentary\\" valet. Given how busy the area gets, your best best might be the valet.*Verdict*\\nRevival scratches the gourmet southern food fix itch.

In addition to the fried cone options, they also serve fries, burgers and probably some other various snack items I can't recall for the time being.When I got my first mighty cone, I thought just one filling wouldn't be enough to make it a meal, so I went with the fried chicken and avocado cone.  BIG mistake.  Literally.  That was enough fried food to make the Colonel bashful.  And honestly, the chicken wasn't so great.  A bit dry, a bit too fried if you ask me.  If I had the option to eat the thing with knife and fork it may have worked out a little better, but bobbing my head in and out of a cone-shaped snack to try and pick off scalding pieces of fried chicken--it was about as successful as bobbing for frogs.The avocado though!  Oh, the avacado!  Delicious.  Warm and soft, fresh out of the fryer and with a little sweet sauce from the slaw.  Weren't for that I may not have enjoyed my Mighty Cone experience so much.My advice?  Try the cone.  I've heard the sliders are good too, but give the cone a try.  But if you're not up for the challenge of the chicken & avocado combination, go for the good old avocado.

This place had great food so I want to give them their props!Went tonight. I expected long lines and there were a few people outside, no big deal. There were even more folks inside waiting of course! Ha. We were told the wait would be about 30 min but I think it moved a lot quicker. Inside is pretty dark, the tables are very small and very close together but they fit a lot of folks in there and they do bar seating. There's a small patio with a few tables outside too.Pro: The wait moved by nice and quick and the gentleman sitting everyone was very personable. Con: I don't like dark and loud, I would have liked to have sit outside but I was happy to finally get to eat.When we finally got to sit our waitress who took our order didn't ask us how we were doing or give her name or anything. Not great customer service skills. She looked at me blankly like I knew what I was supposed to tell her first and took our drink and dinner order all at once. Not really my idea of great service but it was busy so...whatever.We had: Butter salad - yum!\\nMac and cheese - nothing specialFried chicken with mashed potatoes, gravy, and collard greens - get this!\\nShrimp and grits - I prefer cheese in my grits but these were very traditional and had lots of nice big, perfectly cooked shrimp on top. I drank some tequila thing with blackberry puree - very good and the bartender brought it over with a flourish of his hand that made me smile.\\nAt the end of meal I was too full for dessert which was kind of a bummer because the pecan pie looked really good. We'll have to go again! Darn! The tab was about $50 for 2 - not so bad. And the food was great. Def go for the chicken your first visit I'd say and try to sit outside on the covered porch if its warm enough.

The food took FOREVER to come out (which explains the board games) and then we realize that the calzone is nothing but a gigantic mound of cheese.  There was no meat, sauce....nothing else but cheese.  They remade it, but we definitely didn't plan on sticking around as long as we had.

So when I had the chance to have brunch here, of course I was excited. We arrived on Sunday around 1:20 pm. The patio tables were taken, otherwise they would have been nice. We were seated inside within minutes.We ordered:\\n- confit tuna, roasted garlic hummus, potato croquette, poached egg, tomato and cucumber salad, honey dill dressing, crispy chickpeas ($16)\\n- open-face smoked brisket sandwich, BBQ sauce, over easy eggs, maple grainy Dijon mustard, pickled red onion, home fries ($15)I was really impressed by the size of the dishes. My dish came with 3 scoops of confit tuna, 3 large potato croquettes, and half my plate was the salad. I was really happy with ordering this dish. I wasn't sure at first because I didn't see any pictures on Yelp. But there was more than enough of every component of the dish, and I love variety in my meals. I almost couldn't finish, which is surprising since half of it was a salad. I loved the crispy chickpeas paired with the salad, and the dressing was light and not too overly dressed. The tuna confit was tasty as well as the potato croquettes. I do think the potato croquettes could be a bit more aesthetically pleasing.The brisket sandwich was topped high with many thick pieces of meat, on top of a thick piece of toast. The mustard complemented the dish well. Our server was alright. She wasn't overly friendly or anything. I would rate the service that day as \\"OK\\".It would be a plus if they accepted reservations for brunch, especially on OpenTable.I'm thinking about going back for DOVF next year, as I remember it was pretty good last time at the mid-price range.

So the ambiance is bright and casual.  We ordered Samosas, garlic naan, lamb vindaloo, and murg shahi korma.  I didn't bother to ask for anything to be extra spicy, but in retrospect I should have ordered plain naan for my wife, the garlic naan was wonderfully potent.I was a bit under the weather, and had zero appetite on our visit, yet despite that all of the food was perfect with regard to flavor and presentation.  I took most of our meal home, and enjoyed it the next day as well...  The Samosas were very good, and mild enough for my wife to eat half of one...  She said it was good, but it set her mouth on fire.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I put them at a 3 or 4... but I'm not a reliable scale, as on a scale of 1 to 10,  I'm around 20...  Both entrees were perfectly balanced and wonderfully flavored.  The vindaloo had a warmer spice mixture of the two dishes, but was not excessively spicy.

It was my first experience and I wish I had scoped the place out before hosting a 14 person bday party.  Originally our reservation was for 8:45.  I had to add a person the day before so they pushed it to 9:15.  The hostess called me at 9:15 to say they were running behind.  My very large party had to wait outside due to lack of standing area.  Around 15 mins later they sat us in an area downstairs.  The table was quite long and the restaurant was super noisy.  I wish I knew just how small this space would feel.  Our server was VERY underwhelming.  He seemed to rush us to order, had an attitude and didn't acknowledge my bday.  He alerted us that they close at 10 and was quite sarcastic.  The fried green tomatoes were amazing.  My chicken and mashed potatoes were descent but seriously needed seasoning.  My hopes were to high due to other Yelpers.  There was 1 stall per gender upstairs.  There was quite the line out the ladies room so a few started using the men's room.  I don't judge that.  It seems like the restaurant used to be a house.

They could push the carts from your kitchen through your dining room, out to your living room, to your bedroom.  You could have yum cha delivered to your living room couch, wouldn't have to beat off any other Chinese diners to that last plate of ja leung.  You could munch on fresh gin doy while sipping boba, watching tv in your fuzzy slippers (dim sum ladies won't be judging).That's the dream!   But, given that has a few logistical problems, I've always maintained it would be truly awesome to have dim sum delivered to your door.  Something I never thought possible living where I do.Enter Dim Sum Cafe. I've ordered there twice now... and not ordered one piece of dim sum. Not one order of ngow yeun.  Epic fail on my part. But I did order beef pan fried noodles (I'm always happy when I order pan friend noodles and they come back Hong Kong style - so many times I order and ask to make sure it's Hong Kong style and they say yes... and I get these fat bloated noodles, or those noodle sticks).. scallion pancakes, tofu pad thai, fish stir fry, teriyaki for the kids, chicken and green beans.  Spicy salty () chicken wings.  It was all tasty, fresh.  The rice plate serving size was especially large.  We liked that the scallion pancakes had the puffy layers as opposed to some other places where it's just one solid layer - makes such a huge difference!  The spicy salty chicken wings were really good both times - juicy, and the spicy salty was really good on it.  The size of that order was really satisfying as well.   It's easily the best Chinese food delivery in my area, which sadly, is easily done.  But it's good enough to appease my parents tastes too, and my mom is one of those picky Chinese women who hit up 5 different bakeries in a single Chinatown visit to get the best of each baked good they want.  (Exhausting!)It would be nice if they expanded their dim sum menu because I am a pig and my dim sum check is always riddled with hash marks.

Do not expect the best barbeque of your life. Simple as that.The atmosphere is weirdly empty and too open, which is y'know, fine. Except when it's 10 degrees out and the door doesn't shut properly and the whole place is cold. Bring a jacket, kids. Or have some of the fire barbecue sauce. The way it works is you order a meat. They bring you the meat and you get to douse and/or sprinkle it with the bbq sauce of your choosing. Which is nice because I like 2 of the 4-5 sauces enough to want to eat them both. The best meat to order is the chicken. It's consistent, it's fraad, and it's moist and delicious. I really don't like the cubed brisket. It was tough and just looked like a whole bunch of steak dice. Somehow they were also really fatty too, which does not attract me. I've tried the shredded brisket twice. Once it was good, once it was fatty and chewy. I stick to the chicken.Do they have mac and cheese? Yes. And it has a little dusting of bbq chips, which is extra special, but I've never had it served to me more than lukewarm.

Their pork ribs were good, but I have had better in Atlanta and surrounding areas.  This makes sense as Fox is a Texas style place where brisket is usually king. I lived in Texas 33 before moving to ATL in 2015.  I have found ribs to generally be better in Georgia and the Deep South in general.  As far as the sides, the collard greens, Mac and cheese were quite good.  I did not care for the Brunswick stew, but Brunswick is not really my thing.Please note.

Well, today it was literally right on our way, and we needed a place to warm up and eat (when the march got going 90 minutes late on a 35 degree day...)Empty when we got there, and packed with other folks seeking food and shelter by the time we left, the service was excellent the whole way through.  Even as she got crazy busy, our server kept our drinks full and checked in right when needed; plus, everyone was gushing over Baby K (I'm afraid she will get a big head.)  The view is great, and it would be a nice place anytime, in any weather, to watch the goings-on downtown.  Probably a neat way to have lunch with friends visiting the city, too.  Huge windows, comfy seating, cool curved space.There is a lot on the menu that I wanted to try, Sweetie too, but we settled on a wedge salad (her) and the crispy pig pizza (me.)  She liked her salad, and Baby K had a lot of the toppings (tomatoes, bacon, eggs, etc.)  The pizza was very good.  Bigger than I expected, heavy on the toppings (assorted pork, brussels sprouts, onions,) crispy thick dough.  Tasty and filling.Sweetie saved room for dessert because they had her favorite, tres leches cake, and it was the only disappointment.  Dry.  Like, super dry, the opposite of what tres leches should be.  I mean, there's a clue in the name...  Topped with good whipped cream, and bits of pineapple, she really did not like it, I agreed, and Baby K, who tried a bit of both the whipped cream and cake, was totally put off.Prices are slightly high, but given the location, not bad.  $35 or so for a big salad, big pizza, fancy dessert.

I've found some of the best southern food in the country isn't from the south, and I'd heard really amazing things about Screen Door.  I expected it to be a 5 star place, but it really wasn't, but barring my expectations, it was a 3-4 star place.  The two things that really made it 3 stars in my mind were that the wait was quite long, and the service was sub-par.  Long story short, my impression was the place is so crowded and busy that the waiter couldn't keep up.The food was good.  The buttermilk fried chicken was ridiculously good (5+ stars), but it kind of takes the joy out chicken strips and fries when you don't get the sauces you want.  They came out with a honey mustard sauce, but no ranch or BBQ.  Our waiter never came by to check on us to make sure we had everything we needed, so I was sitting there twiddling my thumbs while my chicken cooled.I'm a little unusual.  I don't care about being waited on at all, and normally, I don't give a rat's cheeky butt how good my service is at my table, because I always know if my waiter is busy I can get what I need by asking someone else.No big deal, right?  So I got up and couldn't find him/her anywhere.  Maybe he had to take a massive dump or something, who knows.  So I go to the kitchen and ask for a side of ranch and BBQ.  They said NO, and that I needed to go through my waiter.What.the.fuck?  Ya dumb ho, why the fuuuuuck do you think I'm in your kitchen asking for condiments?  You have to be stupid to think I'm going to walk to your kitchen and ask for food if my waiter is doing his job.  What is this, a southern place with southern decor and New York manners?  That really pissed me off.  People don't use logic and reason much of the time, and that they feel they are bound to the \\"rules\\" of a place, so I guess either a) the employee back there was a dumbass or b) the rules of Screen Door have established I was fucked and not allowed to enjoy my $4 fries or $7 chicken tenders the way I desired.So, back I went.  I walked the entire restaurant twice only to find my waiter out on the patio overwhelmed by dishes (about 18 inches high), trying to carry them to the kitchen.  That's a busboy's job.  Not sure what that was about.  He brought my sauces, but the table had all but finished the fries and tenders by the time I got back.The shrimp and grits were good, but I've had better.  They had a lot of shrimp, which is great since grits cost nearly nothing.  I'd rate them a 4.  The chicken tenders were so good I'm giving the place a 5 overall for food.  Would I go back?  Sure, if I were in the area.  Would I trek across town to check it out?  Only if I'd never been there before.  And I've never been for brunch, so I'll check it out again.

Nothing was original or interesting.  My main course was the lasagna.  It was a reasonable servicing with a thick meat sauce.  I sent it back twice, however, because it was lukewarm to cold.  It was clearly pre-made and reheated.  They finally microwaved it enough to actually get it hot, but by that time the pasta was so broken down that it was like eating lasagna mush.

Then get me an avocado, an ice pick and my snorkel.\\" -- Half Baked (1998)I'm a big fan of the Westside and I had no idea this little gem was over there until a one of my friends introduced me this week when she suggested we go there for lunch. And I heart tacos!We walked in early on a Friday and they were not busy yet, so we were greeted immediately. We were brought waters and started looking over the menus. We opted to order one of the cheese dips to start (especially while we decided on which tacos we wanted to order).  We opted for the Queso Fundido (with poblanos and onions) and out came this bubbling, cheesey goodness in an iron skillet and a container of flour tortillas. Twist my arm!As we snacked on this amazing dip, we decided on tacos. I decided on the Pastor (I'm a sucker for a great pastor) and the aguacate - a fried avocado taco. The tacos came out promptly and I was ready to dig in - the tacos were wrapped in white corn tortillas - authentic. Let me start with the Pastor - this was disappointing. My first big bite, I could not get thru the pork as I hit a big chunk of gristle. I had to spit it out (how lady-like of me). The flavor of the pork I could eat was excellent and full of spicy, rich flavor. Unfortunately, my last bite was also mostly gristle and so I could only really eat the toppings and a small bit of pork - again, spitting out the inedible pieces of \\"protein.\\"Now, the aguacate was amazing. Crispy outside, warm and soft inside - not meant to sound dirty at all - but a crazy mix of textures in this taco. There were pickled onions, corn salsa, and a fabulous crema on top of this taco - spicy, flavorful - I'd eat 3 of these.  The rice that comes with the tacos was good, but the black beans were too dry to eat. The flavor was good, but not good enough to eat them. Half the entree and the tacos - all for $13. Can't beat that for lunch!  I'll be back, but will try other tacos and will most likely buy them without the beans and rice."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Pros: The wait Staff was friendly and the Elvis-themed Milkshake was terrific. The Bento Box was \\"meh\\" at best. The tiny slider/burger was cooked to a well-done, hard, cold piece of meat. It had to be the most pathetic excuse for a Cheeseburger I've ever had and made McDonalds seem like a Kobe steak in comparisson.  Honestly, if this is a sample to showcase the fact that you make burgers as one of your two themed items, then you completely fail. 1 star or LESS for the burger portion.  The sushi was quite tasty. 4 stars for the Sushi. The rest of the items in my bento box were also cold and obviously had been sitting for a while before being brought to the table.  Cold Fries, cold edamame.  I was sat at 7:15pm on a Sunday. My food arrived at 8:25. Sushi and a bento box.  Nothing that needed any kind of cooking to speak of- aside from the burger which as I mentioned was cooked beyond salvation into a grey, small dried ball the size of a golf ball. I think a golfball would have been tastier. Honestly, I wasn't impressed.  Don't make excuses about how busy this place is. You shouldn't have to wait over an hour for any of your food to arrive anywhere.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"So recently I began to eat meat again and the very first thing I wanted was BBQ!!! I was not ever a huge BBQ eater until I met my boyfriend who loves his BBQ, and he loves it a specific way (something I'm beginning to realize is quite normal). He had told me how good Fox Bro.'s was and how he was craving it all the time. So on Sunday we decided to take trip intown so I could give it a try. I thought the establishment was nothing short of your typical BBQ restaurant. If you ever pull up to a BBQ joint and it's all fancy, turn around and go elsewhere. Upon entering, we were immediately seated and given our over-cluttered menus. While the idea of the menu is neat, having one big piece of heavy stock paper with different fonts and colors describing the items on the menu, it was way too jumbled and difficult to read. The second I saw fried pickles on the menu, I knew I had to have 'em. We got that and some drinks and were all set to attempt to read what else they offered. As much as I love fried pickles, I ordered the half-order because we wanted to make sure and leave plenty of room for everything else to come. When the pickles came out to the table I assumed the server had accidently put in a whole order instead of a half. Upon asking another server he informed me that we had the half. PLENTY of pickles to go around. And they were really great! You can't go wrong with pickles dipped in batter fried and then served with ranch. MMM. I knew upon going here that I wanted ribs. So I ordered the half-rack of ribs with mac-n-cheese and baked beans. The ribs were good. Great? No. But good. I prefer my ribs to be wet (\\"That's what he said!\\") and messy and these were quite dry. The meat was moist, but I was constantly adding BBQ sauce. The Mac-n-Cheese was good, not great. I prefer my mac-n-cheese to be a bit more traditional, crusty cheesy top and gooey cheesy middle. The baked beans were good, but I couldn't eat much of them due to their strong taste. I don't know if they had too much maple or what it was, but a few forkfuls was enough. Fox Bro.'s is a bit of a drive from where we live and I probably won't be coming back. I'd much rather prefer The Swallow at the Hollow.

There's a large variety of options, all served off carts in what I can only assume is a fairly traditional manner. A lot about the experience of eating here also depends on where you're seated, it seems. We've been seated everywhere from in the middle of the room (sharing the table with a small family) to a smaller table in the very back of the restaurant (by the windows in the back, and against the corner). When you're in the middle of the room, you get to be a bit more laid back about checking out the carts and getting your food. Everything is basically passing you anyway.When you're tucked in the back corners though? You have to be more aggressive in even seeing what's on the carts. When you find something you like, you have to grab it too...because you're not exactly sure when a cart with those goodies is going to be back in your direction. All in all, the food is decent. I haven't found anything that I consider a \\"must have\\" from the carts, but the shumai is one of my go to options. I'm also pretty fond of anything with taro, so I tend to jump at those cart options. I'm sure I'll be back...it's decent and convenient. Somehow, I always leave this place having eaten WAY too much.

That being said, there are things they knock out of the ballpark and things they just do well. All I care about are the things I keep coming back for again and again. First, let's talk about the brisket. Juicy, smokey, salty and peppery, perfection. I'll take it just about any way they serve it. My favorite is just plain old sliced with some delicious sides. It needs no sauce. I'll dip a bit for fun, but really the sauce is just icing. The best item on the menu, however, is the short rib. There's nothing small about this rib and it's so much meat (that's what she said), that it's at least two meals for me. Which is great because the price tag is huge for a BBQ joint. $35 for one killer rib - just rubbed with salt and pepper and slow smoked until it's falling off the bone. Incredible is an understatement. And it's only available a couple of days a week.As for sides, I love the cornbread, Frito pie, Brunswick stew and fried okra.

My sister got the buffalo chicken sandwich and my immediate thought was fried chicken dipped in hot sauce but it was so much more. The sauce was good with the right amount of kick but not nose-running spicy and the chicken was huge because it surpassed the size of the bun. My son with his simple self ordered a club sandwich because he was scared to venture out.  He said it was good and it actually looked good but I didn't visit this place for a sandwich?!?!?! Normally I would try to convince him to try something different but I didn't feel like battling and I was too busy anticipated what I had ordered to worry with him(teenagers....lol).  All in all, everyone was happy and I'm always happy when my family is happy. Ps. I forgot to give props to the server, he was very knowledgeable of the menu, made great recommendations for alcoholic beverages, and he was attentive.

Anyway, loved loved the bacon & potato - I mean how can one ever go wrong with bacon.  The potatoes were thinly sliced but you could still taste it, gave the overall slice more depth somehow.  It was a bit on the greasy side, but the crust wasn't so that balanced it all out.  The vegan pizza, on the other hand, I would never order again.  It was cold & soggy and on some sad vegan crust that was thick and white.  And the darn toppings kepts on falling off so I resorted to using a fork and just picking them off.  Even then, it wasn't doing anything for me.

Luckily the service was fast and efficient, as my friends were waiting for me. When I laid my hands on the egg rolls, I found out they were more spring rolls ( Deep fried rolls with stuffed vegetable) than egg rolls. No eggs were harmed in producing something called 'egg rolls'. In their defense, they actually had described spring rolls in small print below 'egg roll', and the spring rolls were pretty standard, and were coming at a decent price.

I am so glad they were able to incorporate this type of place into the beautiful CityWalk. Really just a cool, inviting atmosphere. They have computers built into the bar so you can look at menu's, play games or surf the web. Think Zin Burger but with sushi, and way cooler.Our names were called in the amount of time that they had said, which was good. We tried to follow the fish thing, but when we checked it, it was only half way up, but then we received a text that our table was ready 2 minutes later. It confused us, but it was a cool idea.Our waitress was extremely nice, however, she kept forgetting to bring us things that we asked for such as lemons for water, silverware, and spicy mayo. We had to ask at least twice for each of these things and they still took a while to come out. Also, our main entree and dessert took way longer than it should have to come out. Our appetizer didn't take very long though.The food was very fair. We started with the Jen's roll. It was very good, but not the best I've had. Then as my entree I got the Bento box. This came with a small slider, sweet potato fries, spicy cucumber salad, edamame, and 4 pieces of a special roll, I got the Boss roll. Everything was fine, except the slider, which was extremely dry. I had asked for blue cheese on it, to make it different than just plain American. The cheese was just thrown on it in a tiny amount, it wasn't melted or anything. There were no onions on it like they said there would be. Very poorly made. Also, there was way too much of the cucumber salad. It was ok, but they should have given more sweet potato fries or something rather than so much of it.My brother really enjoyed his burger, \\"The Big Squeal\\", so I'd recommend that. I wouldn't recommend getting the bento box, unfortunately. They should make it so you can burger and sushi without it costing a fortune, because there really is no other way to do this than getting a bento box.Come here for the fun atmosphere and concept.

The ice cream-cookie portion was also off as I had too little ice cream stuffed in between the cookies. My ice cream melted quickly, leaving me to eat the cookies on its own.

Huge portions and lots of fries. It's been a while since I had really good fish & chips. Dog & Duck used to be great, but they changed a couple of years ago and went downhill. Now they're closing. When I picked her up at the airport Friday night, I told her that I wanted fish & chips. I did a Google search on fish & chips in Austin, and Porter Ale House came up near the top with lots of great reviews. It's not far from the airport, so we decided to give it a try. We like to support local businesses as much as we can. With the word Porter in its name, we thought they brewed their own beer. Turns out they took the word from a Johnny Cash song. They do have a great selection of local beers, so that's a definitely plus. Nothing like a 512 Pecan Porter on tap! The place was packed, but that's to be expected on a Friday night. Still, we were seated within 5 minutes. The restaurant is clean and well designed. Nice decor and extremely friendly and helpful staff. So far, perfect. We ordered the risotto balls for an appetizer. These were incredible! I highly recommend them. Now, on the main course. We ordered a single order of fish & chips to share, thinking that, at $17, we'd get more than enough food for two people. My wife paid $14 for twice as much food in DC. She couldn't finish it. My heart sank when they brought out the plate. It was three small pieces of fish (maybe 3\\" long each, like big fish sticks) and four potato slivers that were battered and deep friend. That's it. Instead of the traditional tartar sauce, they brought out their own type of sauce which was ok, but it didn't add anything. They should offer an choice between their sauce and tartar sauce. While the fish was fresh, the batter was greasy, and there was a definite lack of flavor. We tried dipping in their sauce, but it just didn't add anything. We left still hungry. You'd think that after $37 plus tip, we'd be full. We had to go home and eat some leftovers to finish off the night. Porter Ale House had all of the markings of greatness, but the fish & chips killed that idea. We might go back and try other appetizers. And again, it's great that they serve locally brewed beer. But we will be hard pressed to spend that much money again on a plate of food that offers so little in return. The burgers looked again, but I don't know that I want to take a chance on overpriced food."},{"name":"Pallookaville Fine Foods","address":"17N Avondale Plz","city":"Avondale Estates","stars":"3.5","text":"This place will ruin your diet, but is extremely worth it!

Three VERY generous chunks of delicious goat cheese complimented the tomato and french baguette extremely well. The tea is freshly brewed. There are cool herbs and plants being grown along the patio. They split our meal into separate plates for us. the cool and rare international music (Ashley heard an artist she recognized from years ago, that combines memphis and african sounds) matched our curiously accented waitress. nice touches. I can't think of anything that WASN'T interestingly awesome. The special we had, beef medallions with pesto cream sauce....to die for. Maybe I'm just a huge fan of such things, but the extraordinarily tender beef absolutely helped. All of this in an hour's lunch time. And for like $10.

Anytime I have friends from out-of-town come to Atlanta, I make sure I take them to Fat Matt's (or at least make sure they go there).  Ribs here are everything you're looking for in ribs.  The meat-to-bone ratio is awesome, and the meat just falls off the bone.  The sides aren't the best I ever had, but they are still pretty good.  They might even be on the smaller side for the price; however, the ribs are the star here.TIP:\\nThe rib sandwich isn't really a sandwich.  It's just an even smaller rack of ribs (bone-in) between two slices of bread.  If anything, it's more like a kid's meal rack.The seating situation is sufficient indoors, but it's even better when it's nice out because they have even more tables outside.  Unfortunately, the outdoor seating isn't covered when it rains.If I had to really nitpick, it's the live music (but not the music itself).  The live music tends to drown out conversations if you're eating inside because it's hard to hear anything else.  With that said, Fat Matt's isn't really a place for eating and catching up; it's more for just eating and enjoying the moment.  So just enjoy the moment! I've dined here numerous times, and I've even made large-scale orders to-go a couple times.  The food tasted great every time, and I've always had a positive experience.

These flavors come out fresh and clean as you eat it. In other words this is not the normal northeastern burrito that buries those flavors in so many spices the only experience of chicken, beans or rice you end up having is their texture. Some have noted that service is a bit slow at i Taco and I definitely agree with that. But the end product is worth the wait, and they really do put a lot of care into making it right.

Aside from the absolutely stunningly beautiful weather (which the restaurant has no control of) we chose to try this place out on Easter evening.  I made reservations, but I need not have bothered as there seemed to be plenty of seating both inside and outside.  The large patio is wonderful in good weather with beautiful views of our downtown and it overlooks the fountains where children frolic!  Inside the seating seems comfortably placed with plenty of large tables and lots of 4 tops and a nice bar.  Outside there is also lots of seating for different sized parties.  A really large party might have some difficulty, but there were tables for 6-8 available.The menu is limited, but has options for all.  We went just for dinner so we did not have an appetizer or even a salad.  Instead we tried a couple of their signature cocktails.  They use locally brewed spirits and have local beers available as well.  I went for the Milestone Mule a concoction of Buckeye Vodka, lime, and Gosling's Ginger Beer.  It was served in a copper mug with a slice of lime as garnish and I found it to be a tasty starter.  My husband had the Whiskey Smash:  Buffalo Trace Bourbon, lemon, rosemary, and honey simple syrup.  A little sweet for him, but he liked it none the less.For dinner I chose the Ahi Tuna which came with coconut basmati rice, sesame broccolini, and pickled cucumber slaw, with a soy-Siracha butter. The tuna was cooked to my specifications and the whole meal was delicious!  Reasonable portions well prepared and nicely combined and presented.  My husband at first said, \\"If I was a vegetarian, I'd have the Beet Bourguinon!\\" I pointed out that he didn't have to sign a waver stating that he ate no meat to order vegetarian, but then he said he had a craving for the Shrimp and Grits!  Wild Gulf shrimp, Andouille sausage, tomato fondue, and white cheddar grits.  He said it was the best Cajun he'd had in Columbus, and loved the tomato fondue!  Again he had a reasonable portion.  He also ordered a beer, and when they didn't have the exact one he was craving, the staff was very helpful in finding him a substitute that he liked very much.  We passed on dessert, but the table next to ours ordered two.  The banana pudding, and the chocolate cake (which comes with a small jar of milk - a genius idea on the chef's part).  There were just two diners at the table, and each of these desserts could have served four people easily!  No kidding just HUGE servings - totally wasteful and outrageous!The wine and spirits menu was extensive with something for everyone, and I could imagine spending an evening there with friends later in the summer relaxing over great food and good spirits.Now for why I didn't go for that 5th star.  First, the place as nice as it is, happens to be one of those restaurants where the noise level is going to always be high, even when there are only a few diners.  Next, parking could be a difficult proposition, and when we went (early dinner 5 p.m.) the valet was not on duty.  We were able to find a place to park, but had we had an older person or a disabled person with us it could have been sticky.  Finally, I saw several other tables where people had their orders mixed up and ended up sending food and drinks back to the kitchen and bar.  One diner ordered a Cosmopolitan and was first served some sort of house cosmo not a traditional one.  Another diner sent back a dinner she had not ordered, just a mix up, but not classy.  Our service was nice, good waitress who was helpful and not pushy.  We will go back.  We are happy to have this nice restaurant in the heart of our city."},{"name":"Boston Shawarma","address":"315 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The place is rundown but chicken shawarma was excellent.

Around $9.00 for a sub that is not quite enough. If the manager is reading this, I recommend that you begin asking people at checkout if they would like a medium or a large sub. The option on the menu is kind of hard to find at first glance and I didn't even realize there was an option to upgrade to a larger size until it was too late. I would have gladly paid the couple bucks more for more sandwich.I used to love Quizno's but since Subway has been pushing them out of business all over town I have to find a new spot for my sandwiches. I have nothing against Subway but sometimes I want something that does not feel quite so fast food. I do love the coke machine though. I feel so American when I am using it. 100's of combinations of soda? Why not? Not a hot sauce fan but I do like that they give a lot of options.

If you're into some of the more authentic/exotic Mexican tacos (i.e. tripas, barbacoa, chicharron) then this is your place.  I usually get an al pastor and bistec which is also amazing.

The family style meal includes a separate entree for each person and includes 2 shared appetizers and 5 or six sides and cornbread and a dessert.None of us are huge eaters, so we chose to order our separate entrees and a side of mac and cheese, broccoli fritters and the cheese mushroom fondue appetizer with grilled bread to share.The entrees our party ordered were fried chicken, fried pork chops, fried catfish, meat loaf and fried catfish and some sort of pancake special of the day.Everyone was swooning over the food.  Their fried food is magical.  The fondue is addictive.  The sides are glorious.  Most of us did not like the cornbread.  It tasted as though it had been cooked with bacon grease.

The atmosphere is also really relaxing, incredibly nice and pretty without being too fancy (or asking diners to be too fancy or formal).

When they arrived not only were they all overcooked,  they were not seasoned. The server seemed to be put out that we didn't order a more exotic combination but, that is not what we wanted.

I could not find any current references to that on their website, but I see many reviews mention it. The buffet was relatively small, nothing fancy, but it was reasonable food at a reasonable price. I'm betting it hasn't changed much.Last night, I was visiting friends who live a bit farther away, and we ordered take-out from Joti Palace, because they were within the delivery range. The amount of time they quoted for the meal to arrive - 80 minutes - seemed a bit high, but considering the amount of food we ordered on a Friday evening, plus delivery, we decided it was reasonable. In fact, the food arrived about 30 minutes earlier than quoted.The entrees held up reasonably well and came with more than an adequate amount of rice. The chicken in the chicken tikka masala was tender, but the sauce was quite a bit lighter in color than at many other restaurants at which I've ordered it (more creamy than tomato). The lamb in the lamb dishes was also tender but slightly fatty. But all the entrees were still quite tasty. The samosas were still crisp and hot. The pakoras did not hold up as well. The garlic naan was the most dissatisfying, quite chewy, and difficult to pull apart. I've never had a bad meal from Joti Palace, but I also can't say that I've ever had anything there about which to rave. It's decent, basic food at decent price."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I've always wanted to try this restaurant as I have heard such good things.

Here's what we got:Smoked snail fritter: good but heavily flavored, not much snail taste\\nSalt roasted beets: has a spicy aftertaste but otherwise beet taste comes out\\nBlowfish tails: ok, tastes like any other fish, not particularly unique seasoning, rather bland\\nCharred broccoli: not memorable\\nCorn pancakes: one of the best dishes of the night, interesting textures and flavor\\nVeal breast: small portion. Lots of fat on top but meat is tender\\nWellfleet clams - sauce is excellent (pesto/spinach-taste)\\nSmoked lamb ribs: meh, dry, not much flavor\\nBraised beef neck: tastes like meatloaf\\nPork belly: good but tiny portion\\nChocolate cake dessert:  very good - can taste bittersweet chocolate\\nBread pudding is good, very moist\\nMaple cashew cake: ok, cream on side tasted better than the cake itselfOverall, I liked the variety of dishes the restaurant had to offer and the innovative way they updated staples.

Went to Saigon Seafood with my aunt, who was raving mad about the goat stew and roasted fish (which is exactly what we ordered). Both were served with their own different accompanying plates of veggies, noodles, sauces, and rice wrappers. I was pretty happy with the amount of food we got for only ordering two dishes; who doesn't love a good dinner spread? Literally had no more room on the table to fit anything else. Awesome.On the downside, the goat stew was just okay. The soup base was a bit too sweet for my taste. Thought it needed a little bit more of an umami kick to it. It did come with generous amounts of meat, which is always good in my book. Still, it just wasn't a memorable dish to me.The whole roasted fish on the other hand! Damn, someone needed to contain me 'cause I was all up in that fish carcass! I shamelessly picked every last bit of meat off that poor fish's bones. Yes, it was that good. The fish came out hot and steamy -- the skin was perfectly crispy and the meat was super moist. Ah, it was so lip-smackingly-delicious! All of the accompaniments also worked perfectly together to make it an even better dish. Let's just say I'm a fan of the roasted whole fish -- yum.We also got salted fried squid, which was very good.The only major slip-up of the night was spoiled tofu that came with the goat stew. Since it was on the side, it wasn't a big deal to me. I told our waitress that the tofu tasted sour, and she quickly apologized and brought us a brand new plate of tofu and veggies. The manager/owner also came over the check in with us to make sure we were doing okay after this little incident.At the end of the day, Saigon Seafood is a seafood restaurant, and that's what they specialize in. So if you're planning on going to Saigon Seafood, don't be an idiot and not get any seafood dishes. Be smart and get the whole roasted fish if you know what's good for you.And with that, I'm ending this ridiculously long review.

The proof is in the pudding...or in this case in the BBQ sauce on your fingers and face.Seriously, this place is legit!  I've been coming here for years and they are still holding it down as the King of Ribs of ATL.  The menu is simple here but almost everything is very well executed including their sweet tea and lemonade.  (I always do mine Arnold Palmer style- half lemonade & half sweet tea.  Yum).  Our go to entree is the back back ribs.  You can order it half rack, full rack, or in a sandwich form. They also have chicken & chopped pork available.  All the meats/chicken doesn't come with sides.  My favorites are \\n-potato salad-  so good here!!\\n-bourbon baked beans (you won't have to take away the car keys from the person that had this side)\\n-mac and cheeseActually, all the sides are pretty good in my opinion.  I have yet to get the peanuts though because I don't really consider that a side item...  maybe more of a snack before your meal?  Now back to the main event- Fatt Matt's Ribs.  The ribs usually just falls off the bone.  Love it!  There's just very good smoked flavor on the ribs. They also come loaded up on BBQ sauce.  Now I remember years ago I alway said \\"'Man, Fatt Matt's should really bottle up their bbq sauce and sell it!  It would fly off the shelves.\\"  Fast forward the times and noticed that they now have it bottled up for sale.  BUY THEIR BBQ SAUCE.  It's so good!!  Those that haven't had it yet just don't know.  There are some occasions that some of the ribs are extra fatty and some prices comes out a little dry.  Most of my experience here are filled with perfected ribs.They also have some pies available.  The sweet potato pie is pretty good.  It's super soft and available for sale by the slice. The staff has always been so hospitable and friendly once you dine in. They will check up on you and even sometimes bring you refills.  Remember to leave some tip for the staff.  One time I came by before they opened and literally the parking lot was filled and people were already in line so come early if you can.  This place usually packs out so be patient.  The food is worth the wait.  They also have live music on some nights.If you're looking for the Mecca of BBQ ribs in Atlanta, this is your place!  They know what they are doing.

Trust me, they're all show with no flow.The harsh review was capped off by the poor service. As I said, with no tables to be had the server only truly cared about us when the bill was issued. We asked the server for just a small cup of the pickles and he just walked away. Yes, he brought them but he acted like we were being such a bother.

Seriously, you have to see it. Don't forget to take a stroll through the adjoining furniture and accessories store, you will want to redecorate. My only complaint is the service.

I think you need to go into the place with the right expectations and right mindset. Is this true authentic Shanghai style cooking? Not really, but my date said that the Shanghai Style Chicken was actually pretty close and it's decidedly better than 'fast food/take-out\\".Atmosphere: The decor is a bit silly with a strange mix of Golden Buddhas and pictures of the Chinese revolution in the background all lit under Red Lanterns. But somehow it actually works.  Realistic? Heck no, but it is fun and my date found nothing offensive about it (she thought it was cute if a bit strange) and she's a professor in Shanhai who teaches East/West culture.Food:  My only real gripe was that the food, while better than expected, was overly salted. Not  horribly so but they could cut back and let the flavour of their dishes do the work more as it was actually pretty good. The portions were sizable and the price not unreasonable. The mixed drinks cost about as much as mixed drinks out do.So I'd say give it a try if you're in the mood for a fun place with decent (if somewhat salty) food."},{"name":"Oishi Sushi","address":"8101 NE Pkwy Dr, Ste E2","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We really love coming here.

One of my friends said, \\"I would rather be waterboarded in Guantanamo than have to eat another chicken in a cone...\\"While I did not agree with his assessment, mainly because he is a small town boy living in a lonely world and could have taken the midnight train going anywhere, i would have to honestly say that I have had better chicken, I have had better sliders, and I have had better french fries.  For a quick meal on the run when you are not feeling very picky and do not need anything special, it may be a-ok.  The problem for me, though, is when I think of Hudson's on the Bend, I think quality and I wanted this place to be special and fast and inexpensive.  Instead, it was just irritating.It makes sense to have ice cream in a cone... chicken, it does not.  Both times I have eaten here I have been frustrated with this gimmick. I almost went last week for the free Austin City Limits \\"excess food giveaway\\" but then I remembered that I really do not like this gimmick at all.  Yes, I passed up free food because it is served in a cone.  (One star, though, for not wasting leftovers from ACL... and providing a meal for many Austin folks.)As you take a bite of the fried chicken/fried avocado, and your hand goes to squeeze to get a better grip, the shape of the cone forces the meal up and out... the delivery system is messy and unnecessary.  Much of it ends up on my face. This is disconcerting and I do not find it attractive. I could see how it might look good on you, though.  Like one of those \\"got milk\\" ads... but make it mayonnaise.Just take the fried chicken or the fried avocado out in your hand, sans cone, and take a bite of it... it is nothing special.  It tastes bland.  I have eaten at Hudson's on the Bend many times and I know that the chef has the potential to make (or instruct someone how to make) killer fried chicken that is spiced perfectly and makes you come back for more.  This is not that.The last time I just took the tortilla out and ate the chicken -avocado- -mayonnaise -coleslaw mixture like a burrito.  So, the gimmick doesn't work for me.  The first time I ate here I actually got a mouthful of mayonnaise because the coleslaw was not mixed up enough...I like mayo, but not that much.  Half of the french fries were a bit soft, like, mealy in the middle.  I really liked the spice on the fries though, and they put the right amount on them... (another star for spicy spice.)The Mighty Cone, let me give you a tip... toss the cone idea and re-think the batter/spice on the chicken.  The only problem is, you are called \\"the mighty CONE\\" and I have a problem with the premise."},{"name":"Golden Garden","address":"63 Concord Ave","city":"Belmont","stars":"3.5","text":"Âú®ÁæéÂõΩÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÊ¨°ÂêÉÂà∞‰∫Ü‰∏úÂåóËèúÔºÅÂ§™ÊøÄÂä®‰∫Ü‰ª•Ëá≥‰∫éÂêÉ‰∏ÄÂçä‰∫ÜÊâçÊÉ≥Ëµ∑Êù•ÊãçÁÖß...ÊØèÈÅìËèúÔºåÈîÖÂåÖËÇâ„ÄÅÂ∞èÈ∏°ÁÇñËòëËèá„ÄÅ‰∏úÂåóÊ∞¥È•∫ÔºåÈÉΩÂ∑Æ‰∏çÂ§öÂÅöÂà∞ÔøΩ?ÂàÜÁöÑÊ†∑Â≠êÔºåÂõ†‰∏∫ÊÄù‰π°‰πãÊÉÖÂ§ñÂä†Áã¨‰∏Ä‰ªΩÊâÄ‰ª•È¢ùÂ§ñÂä†‰∏ÄÂàÜÂèòÔøΩ?ÂàÜ„ÄÇËøòÊòØËõÆÈÅóÊÜæÁöÑÊú¨Êù•ÊòØÊÄÄÁùÄ8ÔøΩ?ÂàÜÁöÑÊÜßÊÜ¨ÂºÄËøáÂéªÔøΩ?..‰ΩÜÊòØÊúâÁöÑÂêÉÊÄªÊØîÊ≤°ÊúâÂ•ΩÔºåÊÄªÁöÑÊù•ËØ¥ËøòÊòØÊåØÂ•ãÁöÑÔºÅÂª∫ËÆæÊÄßÊÑèËßÅÔºöÈîÖÂåÖËÇâÊúâÁÇπÂ§™Áîú‰∫ÜÔºåÂ¶ÇÊûúËÉΩÂ∞ëÊîæÁÇπÁ≥ñÂ∞±Â•Ω‰∫ÜÔºåÈÜãÁî®ÂæóÂæàÊ£íÂïäÂæàÊúâÈÇ£Áßç‰∏ÄÊãøÂá∫Êù•Â∞±ÂãæÈºªÂ≠êÁöÑÈ¶ôÈÜãÂë≥„ÄÇÂè¶Â§ñÊ∑ÄÁ≤âÊåÇÂæóÊúâÁÇπÂéöÔºå‰ª•Ëá≥‰∫éÊúâÁöÑÂú∞ÊñπÁöÑÊ∑ÄÁ≤âÁÇ∏Âæó‰∏çÊòØÈÇ£‰πàÈÄèÁÜüËÑÜÔøΩ?Â∞èÈ∏°ÁÇñËòëËèáÂéüÊú¨Â∫îËØ•Áî®ÁöÑÊòØËå∂Ê†ëËèáÔºåÈ¶ôËèáËôΩÁÑ∂‰πü‰∏çÈîô‰ΩÜÂ∞±Ê≤°ÊúâËå∂Ê†ëËèáÈÇ£ÁßçÁâπÂà´ÁöÑÂë≥ÈÅì„ÄÇÂè¶Â§ñÂ¶ÇÊûúÊ≤πÁ®çÂæÆÂ§ß‰∏Ä‰∫õÈÖ±Ê≤πÁ®çÂæÆÂ∞ë‰∏Ä‰∫õÁÇñÁ®çÂæÆ‰πÖ‰∏ÄÁÇπÂèØËÉΩ‰ºöÊúâÊõ¥Áõ∏ËûçÁöÑÈ£éÂë≥ÔøΩ?Ê∞¥È•∫ÂêÉÁöÑÊòØÁôΩËèúÁå™ËÇâÂë≥ÁöÑÔºåËøò‰∏çÔøΩ?..‰ΩÜÊòØ‰∏™‰∫∫‰ª•‰∏∫Â¶ÇÊûúÂ∞ëÊîæ‰∏Ä‰∫õÂßú„ÄÅÂ∞ëÊîæ‰∏Ä‰∫õËÇ•ËÇâÁöÑËØù‰ºöÊõ¥Â•Ω„ÄÇÁé∞Âú®ÂêÉÂÆå‰πãÂêéÂò¥ÈáåÁïô‰∏ãÂæàÂ§öÂßúÂë≥ÔºåËÄå‰∏îÊúâËÇ•ËÇâÁöÑËØù‰ΩìÁé∞‰∏çÂá∫ÊâãÂ∑•Ê∞¥È•∫ÁöÑÂ•ΩÂ§ÑÂïäÔøΩ?ËøòÊúâ‰∏Ä‰∏™ËíúÁÇíËè†ËèúÔºåÂ§™Âí∏‰∫ÜÔºåÊãøÊ∞¥Êï¥‰∏™Ê∂Æ‰∫Ü‰∏ÄÈÅçÊâçÂ•Ω‰∫õ„ÄÇÂª∫ËÆÆËøô‰∏™Â∞ëÊîæÁÇπÁõêÂìàÊõ¥ËÉΩÂêÉÂá∫ËíúÁÇíÁöÑÈ£éÂë≥ÔøΩ?,2016-10-02 00:55:19\\neG-UO83g_5zDk70FIJbm2w,South City Kitchen Midtown,1144 Crescent Ave NE,GA,Atlanta,30309,33.785954499999995,-84.3844341,4.5,2618,1,Restaurants"},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"BRUH.

In fact, I've probably spent more time at this particular establishment than anywhere else on Disney property. That's saying quite a bit, too... I mean, I spend a lot of time on Disney property and there's certainly no shortage of places to have a drink, right?I'm a fan of everything from the staff to the atmosphere here; it's become a high point of each and every vacation. My wife and I always look forward to seeing familiar faces behind the bar and trying new tequilas. Sure, things can get a little busy in the late afternoon, but you can attribute that to people like me who'd never dream of going to Epcot without visiting, here. Hell, I go to Epcot just to go here! I truly hope they never change a thing less they risk losing the charm that so many of us have embraced.My wife is a huge fan of the Chips and Salsa (reminding me now, to be sure and mention how awesome the  guacamole is) and tends to favor the avocado margarita. I'd never consider a visit complete without having a San Angel Inn Margarita...or two.  I've seen several reviews that aren't exactly fair when pointing out prices. Some are very quick to give a blanket price and move on worth their reviews; e.g, \\"I had to pay 35.00 for a shot!\\" Well, yes... you can indeed spend 35.00 on a shot if you request it from a 125.00 bottle of tequila. Taste is relative and the tab you accrue will indeed reflect yours. Remember, La Cava is regularly recognized as one of the top ten Tequila bars in america. With almost 100 different brands to choose from, there's something for everyone and every budget. I'll resist the urge to try and correct the numerous misconceptions about Tequila that exist, but suspect that's where a little sticker-shock can come from when people go stumbling in looking for a 5.00 shot of Cuervo.That said, if you're like most and simply looking for a fun and friendly introduction to tequila, try the 22.00 tequila flight. You'll get three 3/4 oz shots served on a paddle with a nice little glass of Sangrita. I can't think of how many people have approached me when I'm enjoying a flight and asked, \\"Hey, what is that?\\" I've yet to have anyone who ordered on my suggestion give me anything less than an enthusiastic 'thumbs-up' after trying one. You'll get a Blanco, a Repasado and a nice Anejo. Your bartender will also be more than happy to educate you on what you're sampling. Tequila has a rich and storied history so while you're escaping the heat of the day, you can actually learn a little something in the process.So, do yourself a favor. If you're waiting for a table to open up at the San Angel Inn (Reviewing them next) grab yourself a flight and ask the knowledgeable staff about what you're drinking!  I've even taken my new appreciation of fine Tequilas home with me where I've continued to research new brands.Already looking forward to my next visit.

Both of our sandwiches came with a potato salad which didn't have much mayo (which is good for me, as mayo makes me nauseated sometimes) but it did have a lot of whole grain mustard and parsley, which was so yummy.Cute and casual place with nice ambiance (pig themed, obviously)."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"It is so worth the 45min-1hr wait!!!

They posted the \\"SOLD OUT\\" sign just after we got inside.THE FOOD:  The brisket is tasty, though too salty for a regular visit, and Lum's beats them hands down. The pork ribs, delicious, fall off the bone. Sausage, juicy and perfectly done although Lums gives you a choice of regular and spicy.  The 3 types of pulled pork,  very good. turkey breast was not as juicy as I like it.  Potato Salad, pinto beans and cole slaw were good - but I make better.

Came here again today because we had such an amazing experience yesterday, but unfortunately the story was not the same. Today our server was Chandler, this guy was NOT friendly, in fact he acted as if it was a problem every time we asked him for something (including things we had initially asked for and he forgot so we had to ask him again). He was quite rude and seemed miserable and when you work in a customer service industry it's not professional to wear your feelings on your shoulders. Needless to say, our experience with him was very unpleasant. The three stars is a split for the service we received yesterday vs. the service we received today. If we had Emanuel again today I would have hands down given a 5-star rating because the food here is absolutely delicious! The rating has nothing to do with the food. The food is definitely 5-star worthy, just the service was inconsistent and was a night and day difference between the two men. As for the menu, I highly recommend the fried green tomatoes starter and the chicken and waffles (add pecans) for your main! Their house-made lemonade is delicious as well; defiantly a must!"},{"name":"Edgewood Pizza","address":"478 Edgewood Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"So the pizza was great.

Definitely looking forward to going back!"},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I almost gave this 4 stars, but the minor issue wasn't enough to deduct a whole star.To start, this is where my bf wanted to go for his birthday, but I was a bit worried after all of the reviews and knowing that it was no longer a locally owned place and is now part of the Landry's chain.  But, he was absolutely sold, so I decided to hope for the best, and that's really what we got.  \\nFood:\\nAppetizer - We had the steamer clams to share which were amazing.  I got one bit of sand after probably 15 clams (and it was split!), so I can't fault that.  The broth was rich and yet still acidic, absolutely delicious.Entree 1 - He was hesitant, but I told him to get the dungeoness crab sautee, which was $43, because he LOVES crab and really wanted something that would highlight the taste.  It was also very good.  He and I both love mushrooms and artichoke hearts that came with it, but they were left on the side while he ate all the crab.  The amount of shelled crab that comes with it is really worth the money, considering they are shelling it and still providing probably 1/2lb of crab.  His only remark, which is very subjective, is that he wished it had been baked because he thinks baking crab makes it sweeter.  Entree 2 - I really wanted halibut.  I haven't had really good halibut for a while, and I had been craving it so I asked for our waitress's opinion between the halibut cheeks and the grilled halibut.  She suggested the cheeks because you can't get them anywhere else and when was the last time I'd had halibut cheeks.  Fair enough, I had never had them, and I am always up for trying something new.  They came in a creamy, yet acidic sauce with capers.  They were very delicious, tender and sweet.  I am not a huge fan of heavy creamy sauces, and this was just on the border so I just pulled the pieces out before I ate them.  The accompanying asparagus was cooked to perfection.  Easily cut with a butter knife, but still firm.  Yum!  He got white rice and I got some good garlic mashed potatoes in addition. Dessert 1 - Since it was his birthday, she brought a molten lava cake with some ice cream, that we liked very much, and we were unable to turn down the dessert tray after seeing the options.Dessert 2 - We got the trio, which had a berry cobbler, chocolate torte, and creme brulee.  I'm a sucker for creme brulee and if it's on the menu, I always order it.  I also love berry desserts, and chocolate, so we couldn't go wrong!  Except, unfortunately here it did.  The berry cobbler filling was quite good, but the crust was very hard and I was worried I'd break the dish or the plate it was on trying to get into it with my spoon.  The creme brulee also was very, very disappointing.  It either was not properly prepared, didn't cook long enough, or water got into the pot because when I cracked the delicate sugar top, I immediately saw a watery mess in the middle of my creme brulee.  I still took a bite, because I had to! but it was watery and weird, so that was it.  Thankfully the chocolate torte was fantastic, almost like fudge or a brownie in richness, so we finished the meal with that.We also had some really yummy drinks.  I got the blueberry and regular lemon drops, and he got a gin and ginger drink that he fell in love with, especially after asking for no sugared rim on the second.  \\nService:The highlight of our experience, however, was our waitress.  5 stars for Mariko!  My mom was a waitress when I was a kid and I know how it can wear on a person, and how people are soo picky at finer dining restaurants like Jake's.  But Mariko was absolutely genuine.  Whether with us when we asked for suggestions, or with other tables I could hear her.  When I brought up the creme brulee, she offered to get a new one, but we were full before that dessert anyway and didn't need anything more.  I just wanted them to know, so they wouldn't send any others out to diners (who might be more rude than us).  The only  other thing is that since it IS owned by Landry's now, she had to try to sell us on the member card, which is a $25 buy-in and not a very good point system.  She left us to \\"mull it over\\" at the table privately and didn't push it at all when we declined though, so it was not obtrusive at all.  \\nAll in all, I was pleasantly surprised by everything and glad it was a very good and memorable night out for a special occasion.  I would go back to Jake's again."},{"name":"Madhouse Sports Bar & Grill","address":"5280 Old National Hwy","city":"College Park","stars":"3.5","text":"Food is good, but they are always out of something.

Each mussel dish comes with a piece of bread, which gives you more carb for the meal. That also allow you to dip it into the soup base to enjoy its flavor. Not only did they taste great, their portions were huge too. Each of our mussel dish came with about 17-18 pieces of mussels. They were all pretty fat and plum! With the same price, you would probably get around 1/3 to half of that portion in San Francisco.

But after 3 sub par visits, I just can't. As a born and raised Austinite I consider myself a bit of a food connoisseur--specifically a spice connoisseur. This being the heart of Texas, spicy food is something of a staple so the very idea of  stuffing \\"deep sauteed\\" goodies into a tortilla and slathering them in a spice filled sauce lights my fire and sends me into a tizzy. The shrimp cone is a bit on the pricy side so I stick to the \\"Hot & Crunchy Chicken Cone.\\" It all SOUNDS delicious but the actual food falls short. The chicken is dry, the avocados liquify, there's not enough sauce, the tortilla is a bit stale and all the coleslaw slides to the bottom. Added bonus? It's not even spicy. College cafeteria food taught me the beauty of hot sauce and let me tell you...this food needs a real kick in the bum from some Sriracha thai hot sauce. AND ANOTHER THING! If you're going to serve bland food then at least serve it with a smile. On this last visit I encountered a really heinous young woman working the ordering station.

We will certainly be back, there are several more pizzas there we want to try!"},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I'm another victim of high-expectation-related disappointment when it comes to Alden & Harlow. We visited this restaurant after many recommendations and we were not impressed. I should mention that we came on a Tuesday night, so perhaps that is why we had a bad experience. Nevertheless, we showed up and were seated immediately (the restaurant was maybe half-full) but then had to wait almost 20min for our two glasses of wine. We ordered some food immediately upon receipt of our drinks, but then had to wait again for almost 30min before anything came out. We ordered three small plates (the Brussels sprouts were really quite good), and were planning on ordering entrees after our small plates arrived but decided against it since we didn't want to be there forever. The food and wine were good, and the prices were reasonable, hence the three stars, but the overall experience was not enjoyable."},{"name":"Bao Down","address":"12 Powell Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I loved the food and the service. Great value and ridiculously tasty. No surprise at all that they are opening another location. I had the award winning Bao Chicka Boa Bao. It did not disappoint. The kimchi fries, though I'm not a kimchi person, became an instant fan. Highly recommend this place."},{"name":"Apres Diem","address":"931 Monroe Dr NE, Ste C103","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I used to love this place. I still love the atmosphere. The location and people watching can't be beat. It has been one of my default places to meet up with friends who live in different parts of town. So yeah, I hate to say it but I probably will go back. But the service has been declining. Today's visit  -- the server had to examine the chalkboard posted at the entrance in order to tell us about the specials (and that was after I asked, the information was not volunteered). She could offer no more detail than what was on the board. My entree included a biscuit and a croissant. I had to ask for butter and jam. Then, I was given plenty of butter (three packets!), and one..ONE...little jelly packet. I asked for more and was given two additional packets. Three flavors to choose from. Ummm...yay? Generally at a restaurant at brunch time I would expect to be given a small bowl full of jelly and jam options. We all know that one of those little plastic thingies is not enough for an entire biscuit. The croissant looked nothing like a fresh croissant that you would expect from a restaurant, even that I would expect from Publix. It was a bread roll in the shape of a croissant reminiscent of something that would have come in a large plastic-wrapped cardboard container from Costco. My entree was $16 and the croissant ordered a la carte would have been $3.50. Also, the salt shaker on the table was gross. I saw some sort of food - sauce, syrup, something - near the spout of the pitcher used to refill our water glasses. And, this...the ladies at the table next to us received a plate of food. My friend and I heard it being announced as calamari. That calamari was so light in color that it looked like it was straight from the freezer, not the oven or fryer. I kept staring at it wondering if they were going to eat it, if I was the crazy one. They ate a bit then had it replaced. The second round of calamari was darker. How did the chef let that out of the kitchen? How did the server actually serve such a thing? Where is the pride in the product and service being provided? On a good note, the biscuit was fluffy and fresh tasting. The water was delicious. The coffee was served in a huge mug and I didn't have to beg for cream and sugar. We got to sit in the sun and feel a sense of community with the diverse group of patrons. The $16 omelet was pretty good, though smaller than expected for the price and luke warm when it arrived. I hope that one day I can love this place again."},{"name":"Cassis Bakery","address":"261 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"4","text":"what a great place for dessert. this place by far has to be the best bakery around. they have a huge variety of pastries. that look tooo good to eat. if you like taking photos of your food and sharing it with friends stop by this place and take a look. and you can't beat the taste. i always hate pastries that are too sweet and sugary and everyone think their wonderful. cassis desserts have it all the texture the flavors the sweet and the mmmm... that comes after eating something wonderful. you can tell how much care was taken into each one of their pastries just by looking at how they are presented. each dessert pastry looks like a work of art. and all the prices are reasonably priced. when i have a special event or am just in the neighborhood i usually make sure to stop by and grab a few things. my favorite things are their hazelnut clusters, friut tarts, carrot cake, cheese cake and the chocolate covered strawberrys that look like tuxedoes. what a wonderful dessert cafe."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"The Place is Great!  The Service is always really excellent & the Food is always Terrific.  It is such a great value for what you get.

I'm a huge fan of their petite Steak fillets \\"Jim Bowie Style.\\"   It's so good.
