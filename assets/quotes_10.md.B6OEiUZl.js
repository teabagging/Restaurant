The classic Italian isn't quite the atom bomb that I remember it being but its still a solid A minus sandwich.  The meats are good but just not quite the greatness you get at Monkey Subs.  Maybe they've spoiled me....very possible.  I think Mikes is just a wee bit more processed and fast food infected than I remember.  Its nothing like crap Subway is slinging...not by a long shot.  No pool chemical cured meats at Mikes!  And big town hero is totally flavorless so get the images of both those out of your head.  People at my work go nuts for jimmy johns.  Sorry, but theyre a pretty big yawn as well. Its 'edible', but sandwiches are easy enough that they should be amazing.\\n\\nBut the Big Kahuna cheese steak goes BOOM!  Best Philly Ive had in the Pac NW by far.  Go Kahuna, trust me on this. It adds double cheese, jalapenos and mushrooms.\\n\\nNow like most things, I have my own way of making it 'mine': Since the Kahuna is double cheese,I like to split my cheese right down the white American/provolone middle since both are what I consider authentic.  Go for some of both. Cheese whiz may be the choice of some, but this is MY review and whiz can suck it!  Also, I make sure to have them add every form of hot pepper they have.  That red cherry pepper relish (hoagie spread, as we call it on the east coast) should be mandatory on EVERY sandwich Mikes makes! In fact, Id say its a 5th food group on its own.  The  oily pepper salad at Potbelly is good, the cherry pepper relish is the nectar of the hoagie gods.\\n\\nEven if Mikes doesn't have all the mojo as I remember back east, its still a solid go-to for a great sub!"},{"name":"Out of the Blue","address":"215 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Out of the Blue is an odd duck.

My usual here is the Lobster Thermidor Burger. One note: if you don't like or are allergic to onions, there are unnanounced scallions on this burger, so tell them to leave those off. Personally I don't like unannounced scallions, chives, etc. A splurge is to get bacon added, which I didn't this time. I ordered the burger medium and it came out medium well. I just accepted it, particularly as our waitress was not around for a while after our food arrived. It's wellness roulette for me anytime I get a burger, here or wherever. I appreciate some pink, which one should get with medium, but maybe I go medium rare here next time and see how that works. As far as the fries, they are fine. Well down the list of Walt Disney World fries (that list is for another day), but they are OK here. My quick summary is this is a place that can easily be 5 star on a really good day, but quality control on average will put it in the 4 star range I believe. If the $12 Manhattan had 3 Luxardo cherries. If the burger was cooked a lovely medium. If the fries were Boathouse quality.

Yes, having watched Hosea R. on Top Chef, we came in with high expectations. If our dinner had been even halfway decent, I might be willing to chalk it all up to an off night and give the team the benefit of the doubt. But it was not that. It was terrible. Let me explain.\\n\\nI'll start with the service--the one and only good thing. The host gave us a friendly greeting, checked off our reservation, and seated us immediately. Kelsey, our server, was also friendly, asked all the right questions, and was both efficient and also let us have a leisurely pace for our meal.\\n\\nOtherwise? Every single dish was terrible, each in its own way.\\n\\nThe Mezcal-cured Salmon Tostada was, in a word, salty. It had promise, with a range of textures from the tostada on the bottom to the crunchy salad on top. But the salt of the salmon overpowered every/any other possible flavor, and there was no acidity available to take that power down a notch.\\n\\nA dish called Red Chile Posole should really be called \\"Tomato-Flavored Beans At The Campfire Into Which Someone Dumped Too Much Hot Sauce.\\" Let me be clear: I love spicy, flavorful food. But this didn't have any depth of flavor, it was just tomato on the surface and then a red pepper kick afterwards, with some beans in between. My wife ended up mixing in some of the sour cream from our tacos, which helped but ... not enough.\\n\\nIf this were a Top Chef episode, the Roasted Beet Salad would have been the dish triggering an elimination. Why? There wasn't really anything wrong with it--but there was also nothing right about it either. It tasted like the kind of salad you get at an Applebee's in an airport, where your food options are limited and you're trying hard to be \\"healthy.\\" The beets had a very mild flavor, and were surrounded by arugula that had grown too long, i.e., the stems were too thick and chewy. The goat cheese dressing and the crunch from the various quinoa/nuts combos could not save this.\\n\\nFinally, the Grilled Panela Cheese Tacos. Where to start? How about we just keep this simple. The description says \\"abbondanza yellow corn tortilla, snap pea-jicama slaw, green rice, adobo milling organic beans, cream mexicana, charred allium salsa.\\" That's like a word salad. A flavorless word salad, as it turns out. Don't order these. The green rice is apparently rice to which a magic green sauce is added; the magic is that it removes all flavor and texture, turning it into mush. The beans appeared to have had liquid smoke added to them, but ... nothing else. Some of the salt from the salmon would have been great with the rice, beans, or both. And the tacos themselves? Whatever. Is that apathetic enough?\\n\\nOne last thing that has to be said: the reviews for this place are high. But after eating here? It feels very much like the emperor's new clothes, where no one wants to be the one to say: this isn't good. So I'll say it: this isn't good! Don't eat here! And if you do?

Superica is a delicious and unique spot with incredible service and a premo location.\\n\\nTwo salsas are ready and waiting for you pretty much as soon as you sit down and chips/chip refills are free (Woot!).

I've tried both the guacamole app and the chili con queso app. I prefer the guacamole - don't skip on the squeeze of lime that comes with it. It is an essential part of the guac's success. The queso dish is more of a stringy experience than a classic cheese dip. Delicious, just not exactly what you might expect. The drink list here is also a stand out. They have TONS of all-star beers in the $4-$6 range and offer a variety of affordable mixed drinks as well. \\n\\nAfter two visits to Superica, I'm convinced they have reached the height of superior tortillas. I can't tell you how they do it, but their tortillas are THE BEST. On my first visit, I had the steak tacos. These are still the best tacos I've had in Atlanta and a REAL challenge to finish. Grown men can hardly finish this dish. Most recently, I had the shrimp tacos. These come on a different tortilla (corn) than the aforementioned tortillas, but still delicious. I'd recommend working out a taco trade with someone at the table so you can try a couple. I would also recommend ordering sides as a table. The rice and beans are yummy, but everyone certainly does not need their own order. \\n\\nI've been with a small group and a large group. The service and recommendations from the staff have been great both times. I went with a small group on a Thursday night and we were seated immediately. I went with the larger group on a Friday night around 7pm. We only had to wait about 45 minutes.

The food we recieved was properly served and attractively presented. I had the shrimp tacos and they were very fresh and excellent. The shrimp remained crisp and tender inside their light batter coating. All vegetables were fresh and unblemished. We were visited by a very competent floor manager who was checking for customer satisfaction. Our server also frequently checked on us and adjusted the umbrellas for our comfort. The day was sunny and hot, but the constant breeze and the umbrellas kept us comfortable. The prices were higher than we would pay for the same items in Austin.

But this time I was looking to try something new, so I asked one of the workers for a recommendation and he suggested La Vie en Rose, which is rose black milk tea. The rose flavor was not overpowering at all, and the sugar level was perfect--not too sweet or too bitter. Overall, I was really pleased with my drink. My friend ordered a fruit tea, which I think was called the Sunrise. \\n\\nOne drink I would not recommend (unless you prefer bitter tea) is the Jasmine Green Tea. It's a bit more bitter than I'm used to, but that's probably just my personal\\npreference. \\n\\nThe location itself is quite empty and spacious, with several soft, low benches to sit on. It's a calming and quiet environment for the most part, and it's a nice place to sit and enjoy a drink in the afternoons during he summer, especially because it's a little darker inside.\\n\\nI'm deducting a star for a couple of reasons. First, the drinks are not cheap at all ($6), especially given the amount of drink you get. The plain black milk tea is $5, which is more reasonable, but still--compared to KFT or Gongcha, the prices are worse. Second, because this is a pop-up, the hours are often really unpredictable. I've visited here around 4-5 times, and 2-3 other times I've made my way over to the store after checking the website for hours, and still Abide wasn't open. \\n\\nOverall, if you're looking for a boba shop with unique flavors and really pleasant workers, this is the place for you."},{"name":"Torched Hop Brewing","address":"249 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The atmosphere here is beer halls from Germany or the midwest. It's large dining room areas with loud chatter amongst friends and  coworkers. My friend and I came here before a show at the Fox Theater on Tuesday night. We entered at 7 and the host said there was a lot going on because of office holiday parties but he would be able to seat us upstairs on a corner table. The table itself wasn't very appealing since it was by the computers the servers use to order food, it felt dingy and not very comfortable. However since we were low on time, we sat down. My friend ordered a flight while I got an IPA. My IPA arrived quickly but her flight took a while to get. While we waited for our beer, we ordered food and told our server we had a show to catch so can we make this fast? She said she'd try. When my friend's beer arrived, it was 7:15, granted we arrived there at 7, and we happened to look at our tickets for the show. Doors open at 6:30 and show starts at 7:30. And then it was a mad dash to finish our beers, we chugged everything, told our server to cancel our food orders and we ran to the fox. \\n\\nThankfully the show at the fox was a few minutes behind so we didn't miss anything. \\n\\nAfter the show, we agreed to go back to Torched and get the food and some more beer. This time we were seated in the main dining room, downstairs, had a different server and got the food. I ordered the Braised Beef Sandwich with Fries. It's supposed to be beef that's been braising for many hours, served with beer cheese, aioli and peppers. The sandwich was fine but I didn't get much flavor on the aioli or the beer cheese. The cheese tasted mostly like melted cheddar cheese on the braised beef. I don't hold that against them, knowing we ordered food at 10:15pm, they may have been out of the beer cheese. The peppers were the perfect addition to the rich, fatty beef. The fries were great; I am an all around fry lover and picky about my fries and these were definitely above average. I say above average because there were many pieces that were limp or tasted lukewarm. I don't hold this against them because it was so late in the night. \\n\\nOnto the beer, this place has the longest beer menu and I love it. It's nice going to a brewery that has pages and pages of great beer. I would come back here just for the long list of beers and to try few more. \\n\\nOur service was great the first time we entered as well as the 2nd time. Both of our servers checked on us periodically and made sure we were happy with the beer and the food. \\n\\nParking is a pain so plan ahead. Torched doesn't have any parking space designated for them, except for the couple in front of the restaurant bar. We parked across the street in the back of a clinic or some office that was closed after 5pm. A man standing there said he'd watch our car for $5; that's probably illegal and all kinds of shady but it was our best option. If you have time, try to find street parking nearby or a garage, although on the night we went to the show, garage parking was $15."},{"name":"Musubi","address":"2134 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I was so ready to love this place.

There was WAY too much rice for the tiny spam, so I had a mouthful of only soggy rice.

I can honestly come here multiple times in a week and not get sick of it.. the only downside is the lineup through the door during busy peak hours.

Service is generally pretty quick, so lines go by pretty fast.\\n\\nThe portions are really quite generous and filling, they don't skimp on portions. There's always an abundance of fresh herbs, veggies and toppings in their soup, it's a really good meat to noodle ratio. Each order also comes with fresh veggies/herbs to further customize your soup, as well as lime and chilies for extra tang/heat.

It was a little chilly, but I wanted to walk up so I could take my time and get more in touch with the restaurant.  \\"Welcome to the Shack\\" is how Mallory greeted me with a warm smile for lunch today. She highly recommended the ribs, but I wanted a taste of everything, so I went with \\"Mallory's Combo\\".  It consists of 3 rib tips, 2 wings, a sausage link, cornbread, and 1 side for $11.50.  For my side I had the collard greens, and I also ordered a side of baked beans pushing my total to $13.50.\\n\\nWhile I waited, Mallory went back and put together a free sampler of their sides. Outside of what I ordered it included potato salad and coleslaw.  The slaw was finely cut with less mayo than some places and a little more vinegar; overall a solid version.  My first bite of potato salad contained a nice chunk of hard-boiled egg.  It was creamy with a bit of mustard, and good enough to have me rethinking my order.\\n\\nFood came out surprisingly fast.  \\"Come back to the Shack!\\" were the parting words from Mallory.  Based on the weight of the bag I quickly realized I would have leftovers.    \\n\\nI started with the greens which were tender and had just the right amount of tartness.  I enjoyed the side very much.  The flapper wings were fantastic.  They are very lightly breaded, simply seasoned, and juicy.  It reminded me of homemade pan fried chicken.  The biggest shocker had to be the sausage.  Based on the short menu description I was expecting just a small cut of smoked sausage.  What I got was a sausage on bun with peppers and onions.  I was initially very disappointed when I saw that it was casing free with dry looking ends, but to my surprise it was very juicy and flavorful with red pepper flakes mixed in.  An awesome and filling main dish on it's own.  The baked beans were very unique in that they had a hint of flavor similar to pumpkin pie spices. The rib tips were nice and meaty with just the right amount of BBQ sauce for me.  The sauce had lighter hints of the unique flavors found in the baked beans....I'm writing way too much and haven't even mentioned the well executed cornbread.  \\n\\nA purist would probably kill me for saying this, but I don't like to stick with the same style of BBQ.

And the veggie burrito was pretty tasty, dripping with roasted veggie juice when I got home.  I'd say the most unique thing about this place is the 40-50, I kid you not, different kinds of hot sauce they have available, from mild to genital-scorching, I imagine.  Really fun names on some of these, too, like \\"See Dick Burn\\" and \\"See Jane On Fire\\", and \\"Ass Kickin Hot Sauce\\" and \\"Liquid Stoopid Hot Sauce\\".  And so on.  :) If you're getting your burrito to go as I did, you'd have to unwrap it to slather hot sauce on, and since my tortilla was already absorbing juices, I didn't want the whole thing to fall apart on me.

Don't really like the long lines at peak times, Jamie really should have figured it out by now after five plus years in the same location.

Like going to the Soup Nazi for the first time but without any yelling. You order at the counter but are discouraged to form any sense of a line. A very friendly \\"no lines please just come up to the counter!\\" voice called out to the sea of confused tourists.\\n- Their cannolis are big. They don't mess around.\\n- Their prices are as stated...tax included.\\n\\nWhat I preferred about Modern:\\n- Felt less crowded. Not sure if that's because they had a legit line instead of a frenzy.\\n- More formal of a space to sit, take your time, enjoy the food and company you're with if any\\n- They took a credit card. Mike's was cash only.\\n\\nI'm no cannoli expert so this probably doesn't hold too much weight. I think they are all delicious.

Five years I came for lunch religiously with coworkers and friends, to the point that the manager knew us by name and most of the staff by sight, and we could be more or less guaranteed a table for our parties of eight to fifteen on a Thursday or Friday. They just wrote us down on the list. They kept our friend's gluten-free soy sauce in their fridge for her personal use because regular soy and heavy salt made her desperately ill. Shabusen became an institution throughout my college years and early working life.\\n\\nShabusen's Burrard Street location is something of a flagship between the fancy shopping district, CTV, and the businesses lined up from Granville to Howe. We made our trek rain or shine all year round. The entrance upstairs is shared with another popular Chinese restaurant, but we turned in knowing what was to come. The dinner all you can eat offers the freedom of Korean barbecue done at your table with a range of meats, like chicken, beef, spicy beef, and pork. Open flame and sushi are a fabulous combination but for lunch time, the offerings are more limited.\\n\\nOne of the great blessings here is all you can eat sashimi. We devoured platefuls of salmon and tuna, some of it still half-frozen to keep up with the lunch time pace. Rolls of tender maki were plentiful and devoured. I became an addict of tekka (tuna) and cucumber rolls here. They are tiny, bite-sized creations rather than the looney-sized, rice-stuffed monstrosities that crop up occasionally at lesser sushi joints. There are other varieties like spicy scallop cone (a beloved favourite of my friends), tamago (egg), and the usual suspects. Quantity is a plus for the all you can eat, but quality is definitely not too bad. As always, dinner has far more selection than lunch in the fish department. \\n\\nThe menu allowed you to select how many pieces you wanted, and that doesn't seem to have changed. Estimating by the piece can be tough; groups inevitably will finish up what isn't eaten, though it can be trickier with just one or two. Remember the old adage of your mother's: you can always order more. \\n\\nDinner time BBQ is delicious but it is filling and a bit time consuming to prepare the meat. Go in hungry to make the most of your meal. You definitely need two to three people to make good on that."},{"name":"India Palace","address":"23 Union Sq","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"As of today, I am changing my review to five stars.

When I got less pastries one time, I realized I must have been charged the wrong amount before. After that I did my own math and every time I had to correct the amount they asked for.

The salad part of my salmon salad was not good at all. There was loads of lettuce and just a tiny smattering of onions, cucumbers, and tomatoes (I omitted the blue cheese crumbles).

We deserve so much better than the dining options we have available to us. Everytime I visit a new, local, establishment, I am hoping to be blown away. That's just not the case here.\\n\\nHearing good things about Uptown Pasta, we decided to check it out; after all, there was a Groupon! Let's get one thing straight right now. Uptown Pasta is not authentic Italian. Neither is Olive Garden, or Little Italy's, or Cafe Al Dente, or any other \\"Italian\\" restaurant in the Couve. Real Italian food is a regional cuisine that focuses on simple, beautifully prepared ingredients.That being said, Uptown doesn't claim to be authentic, rather \\"East Coast\\" American style Italian. So that's fine. There's a place for that food too! \\n\\nBut I'm off track, let's get back to Uptown Pasta.\\n\\nIf you don't want to read the rest of my review, just know this: This place is worse than Olive Garden, and this is coming from a guy who despises Olive Garden and everything that Olive Garden stands for.\\n\\nThe food at Uptown is over-priced and poorly prepared, the ingredients are of the lowest quality, the service is meh at best, the wine list is terrible, and everything about the restaurant is inconsistent and unorganized.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, we were told it would be a 15 minute wait. The restaurant has no space to wait inside (it's a small place), so we decided to wait outside. We watched about 15 people leave the restaurant, and kept waiting and waiting and waiting. Tables sat empty for 10-15 minutes before anyone even attended to them. I watched as tables who had been seated 15-20 minutes prior finally received water or menus. This left a bad taste in my mouth, but I wanted to go into the experience with a good attitude, so I decided to forget about it. Finally, 35 minutes after we arrived, we were seated. The restaurant WAS NOT very busy at this point, with only a few tables remaining.\\n\\nThe menu looked good and we were pretty excited to dig in. We ordered a bottle of white wine with dinner. The wine was watery and a little flat, but that doesn't necessarily reflect on the restaurant. However, the $28 price tag was way too much. Most of the authentic Italian places I eat at in Portland have bottles from $20-$30 that are 100 times better than what we ordered. \\n\\nOne other thing that bothers me. It seems every other table got bread service, and we didn't. I don't know if you have to request bread service here or not, but Italian food is supposed to be about hospitality and making someone feel welcome. Bread service is integral to that I think, even if you have pay for it. We werent given the option, and it wasn't on the menu. \\n\\nAppetizer was bruschetta with basil pesto and tomatoes. The tomatoes look like they were straight from winco. Awkwardly, unevenly, inconsistently, cut, no flavor, and pasty. The pesto was okay, but needed a pinch of salt. The bread was actually not bad. All in all the bruschetta seemed like something out of a box. Definitely forgettable, and definitely overpriced. \\n\\nAlso, we got our appetizer about 5-10 minutes after at able who had ordered 10 minutes after us. That doesn't make any sense. I'm fairly certain our waitress just forgot about it and let it sit under the heat lamps. Definitely annoying.\\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered the Gnocchi with Alfredo, and I ordered the tagliatelle a la bolognese. My bolognese was AWFUL. The sauce tasted like raw red wine. If you cook with red wine, you need to let it burn off a bit, not pour it in 30 seconds before you serve the food. The bolognese also really needed salt, and had no depth of flavor whatsoever. Just the same pasty tomato taste and raw red wine. Bolognese is supposed to be a rich, deeply flavored dish. Very disappointing, and actually almost inedible.\\n\\nThe gnocchi actually wasn't bad, at first. The gnocchi were cooked okay, a bit too dense (not pillowy enough), but they were acceptable. The alfredo was actually good too, and seasoned nicely. However, about 5 minutes after we had started to eat, the alfredo sauce started to separate, and badly. Really, really disgusting to have that happen, especially 5 minutes into the meal. Seeing the amount of butter in that dish was also appalling. I think Paula Dean is working in the kitchen here!\\n\\nNeither of us ate more than half of our entrees. Our total bill? $66. Way overpriced for disgusting, poorly prepared food, disorganized, spotty, uninformed, service. The people were friendly, but that doesn't make up for anything. \\n\\nBottom line, if you want cheap \\"Italian\\" food go to Pastini. It's not authentic, but they do a good job. If you want REAL Italian food, go check out Ristorante Roma or Gildas in Portland. Or A Cena Ristorante. If you're stuck in the Couve, then Al Dente or Little Italy's are definitely a better choice.\\n\\nI will NEVER go back to Uptown.

In a city with so many sushi restaurants, you would think it easy to find good sushi but alas it has mostly been a series of disappointments. Perhaps largely because my boyfriend and I are not into the \\"special\\", fusion sushi craze. Kilala is a breath of fresh air in a sea of too many over-sauced, over-stuffed, and over-hyped versions of what should really be simple and fresh food. \\n\\nAt Kilala, I appreciate that they let the ingredients speak for themselves. The seafood is fresh, tasty, and handled with care. The sushi rice has the right texture and flavour. Not packed too tight and I appreciate the rice to filling ratio in their rolls. Their nigiri is the best that I have tried so far, so although their prices are just a smidge higher than competitors in the area (I've pretty much tried them all), it's money that is very well spent. \\n\\nI loved finding a sushi restaurant actually owned by a nice Japanese couple. The menu is limited but you'll find yourself coming solely for sushi anyway. The ethnic tuna & salmon, and the saba shiso roll are a must and try their battera for a different sushi preparation.

We order our food with our drinks because we had so much time to look at the menu. We order our food, which arrives quickly. We ordered ribs, chicken and brisket. It was literally the worst bbq I have ever had. I was shocked that this place with such great reviews could serve such terrible bbq. Rudy's bbq is better than this. The rib meat was hard, the brisket was flavorless and the chicken was okay. For our sides, the macaroni was terrible. The fries were good. The biscuits we were given before our meal too.

FOUR layers of uni in an uni nigiri?! The Beatles made a song about that before, I think - All Uni(ed) is Love. \\n\\nAlas, my visit at Sushi Bar Kilala fell short of love. \\n\\nIt started off with a bit of a wait since there were no tables available and the only people working were (what seems to be) an elderly Japanese couple who run the restaurant. The husband makes all the food, while the wife attends to all customers. Given this, I didn't mind the wait for our table or food as much; I truly admired the couple's work ethic and amiable nature.\\n\\nOur party of three ordered the Sashimi Salad ($6.95), Kilala Combo ($9.95), Kilala House Roll (full) ($13), Saba Battera (10.50), Chicken Udon ($7.00), and of course, two Uni Nigiris (seasonal: $4.75/each). \\n\\nThe Sashimi Salad was fairly simple: mixed greens with a creamy dressing and two pieces each of incredibly fresh salmon, tuna tataki, hokkigai, and tako.\\n\\nI can't speak much to the Kilala Combo or the Chicken Udon as they were the mains for the rest of my party. However, for the Kilala Combo, I thought the California Roll could have been executed more cleanly. In terms of taste, it was only all right. \\n\\nOn the topic of cleaner execution, the Kilala House Roll was quite the mouthful to eat and consequently difficult to pick up with chopsticks alone. It is overflowing with tasty ingredients like salmon, tuna, masago, artificial crab meat, avocado, and tamago on the inside, with a slice of smoked salmon on top. Once you take a bite, it will inevitably fall apart. Now, I usually avoid this by eating it in one bite, but the House Roll is not kidding around. It is the biggest kid on the block. Shout-out to the chef for making a delectably eggy and flavourful tamago, by the way.\\n\\nThe Saba Battera, on the other hand, was so pristinely presented. Clean cuts of saba and rice, and clean flavours throughout that were only enhanced by the shiso leaf tucked away between the layers.\\n\\nNow, to go back to where it all started, the esteemed Uni Nigiri. The uni was melt-in-your-mouth creamy and left a pleasant, briny aftertaste. However, our pieces of uni weren't as uniform or as plentiful as the one that vancouverfoodie had. I would say that our nigiris had about two to three pieces of uni each, with the bottom layer unfortunately being broken up.\\n\\nMy two cents? When you dine at Sushi Bar Kilala, you're paying a premium for the quality of the ingredients as opposed to the atmosphere (small, homely space with minimal seating) or the service (slow but friendly). Do give it a try though if you're looking for fresh, simple, and authentic Japanese food!"},{"name":"Cafe Intermezzo","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Councourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"What a terrific find in the B Concourse of Atlanta Airport.

Best prices on the west side or so it seems to me so far and I will elaborate in a minute on why 2.  Great coupons and specials, which from what I have learned Mom n Pops places just aren't offering and should be.  3.  generous portions and even distribution of toppings  4.  service was average, but speed of service was great at about 20mins for pizza and fried mushrooms.  and for the 5th star.....crust was between a thin crust and a hand tossed and had just the right amount of crunch to it, sauce was a nice sweet style sauce, and the mushrooms were so good!!!  Now to elaborate....My Honey and I just moved here from Mansfield and we were wanting to try out a local place so we looked on Yelp (I am getting addicted Help!) and we did some calling Around lots of folks said Josies was the best, but for the second time calling them they have no specials they are not very friendly on the phone and the price for a large 1 topping is 13.99 so they are the 2nd lowest priced pizza next to Bellas, but Bella's large 1 topping is only 11.95 and they are smart enough to run coupons and specials.  We called a few other places with some being as much as 17.50 for a large 1 topping so we were about to give up our Mom n Pops search and just go for Papa John's 11 buck deal on pepperoni meatball pizza and it was then that I saw the coupons on my fridge I got back on Yelp and pulled up Bella's to see they only had one review, but a very good one and the coupons were amazing so we used the buy a large 1 item at regular price get your choice of a free Italian sub, cheese sticks, or breaded mushrooms!!!! Killer deal and I'm not the picky one when it comes to pizza usually it's my Honey he is weird about the crust it is usually too thick or too this or that and the sauce the pizza isn't saucy enough and it taste funny, so when he says he loves it I believe you have a winner.  \\n     I know they are in a strange location and for some even hard to find, but I am telling you they put coupons in the red plum circular and the next time you see those gems I highly reccomend you try Bella's Pizza out!

I moved away before it was finished  and was finally able to come to come back now to try it.\\n\\nI must say that the decor is nice and definitely more than what average restaurants have. However, it is less than I expected. The screens that they have on the second floor do not go with the rest of the decoration and they look like a quick fix to a lack of the more sophisticated atmosphere that a restaurant associated with universal should have. It also does not match the extravagance of the entrance. This was the first disappointment. \\n\\nThe second disappointment was the menu! For a chocolate emporium I expected more meals to include chocolate besides desert. I myself ordered the short rib and it was great but the grits do not go with it. My partner ordered the meatloaf and he enjoyed it but was definitely not worth the price. We also ordered the truffle fries and they were way too small. Even more expensive restaurants can afford to give you more fries for the price. However if it's not then they should charge more instead of serving you 10 fries or make that a small portion and then have a larger portion. If you can't get the fries right at a restaurant that's a problem. That was the second disappointment.\\n\\nThe other disappointment was the service by Amanda. I had to ask for water 3 times. We asked for water without ice and water with lemon. Both waters that were brought were without ice, and no lemon in sight. We had to wait for another waiter who brought the food to be able to ask him to ask Amanda to bring water, which we had already drank despite not being what we asked for. Amanda then took another 20 minutes to bring the waters and they were still wrong.\\n\\nAnother disappointment was that Amanda assumes we weren't planning on ordering desert and she simply brought the check without asking first. I had to go outside to order because I didn't feel like dealing with her any longer.\\n\\nThe last disappointment were the desserts themselves. Although good, I also had higher expectations. Look at Boca's House in Miami for reference to shakes that are well executed! The worst part was the whip cream which was cheap and tasted bad.

Waitress was about 20 years past the time to retire and had no idea what she was doing. So my wife got the pot roast dinner and food came out and her pot roast was nothing but griddle and fat. She asked to send it back for more meat to be put on. My fried chicken came out a a single piece of griddled chicken and no white gravy?? Waitress swore up and down that's what I ordered???? Not worth the fight when they have no idea the difference between griddled and fried chicken?! I don't think she could pick a chicken out of a lineup?! My wife's second plate of pot roast came back and it was so cold it was almost frozen!?! Plus looked like the chef microwaved it?? Waitress agreed and said chef laughed at her when she went to complain and then sat in the window smiling at us making fun of us!!!! What a dope! Dude your a line cook at Bob Evans! Enough said!!

It's on the west side of McCaslin, N of 36, about 2-3 strip malls N of 36 - you turn in left at the Dairy Queen.  Entering, you are greeted with many pieces of art from that sector of the world, including woven rugs hung on the walls, tapestries, various statues (presumably of Hindu deities), 3 of 4 various sized cool-looking prayer wheels (unknown if they're ok to touch and give a spin to, someday I'll ask) and even a wonderful looking large dragon mask with 3 skulls set on top of it.  It's so cool it's the wallpaper on my phone. :) I think I may need to upload it as a pic. ;)\\n\\nIf you're getting take-out, you'll have a wonderfully soft cushioned leather sofa to sink down into, if you don't feel like perusing the various decorations that festoon the place.  All the dishes (outside of those in the buffet) are made fresh to order, and you can make special requests (including dairy free, gluten free or vegan) when you order and the chefs will accommodate those for you.   The waitstaff would be best described as quiet and cheerful.\\n\\nMy most recent visit my friend and I both ordered from the Tibetan cuisine part of the menu.  We ordered the Tibetan Roll for an appetizer, 2 large eggroll-like-but-not-eggroll wraps with vegetables and some delicious gooey cheese which were amazingly tasty.  For entrees, I had the thenthuk (stew), a large bowl of vegetables, potatoes, homemade wheat dough, in a flavorful broth. You can choose your protein to be cooked into this framework and I chose *yak*.  That's right, *yak*.  It's fun to say, say it with me!! ***YAK!*** GO YAKS! (cheer) whee! :) Yak tastes like very tender beef, it was amazingly flavorful.  My friend had the thukpa - a bowl of home made noodles, fresh vegetables in a flavorful broth - and he also choose yak as his meat.   We're both big fans now.   Both dishes were served with naan bread, and unlike Sunshine 2 reviews back who had the misfortune of having doughy, unpuffed naan, ours was soft and puffed and delectable!!! mmmmm...I love naan...how something that so resembles a flour tortilla can taste so much better than one, I have no idea.\\n\\nWe both had delicious lassi as our beverage, I opted for the somewhat exotic banana lassi which I'd never seen at any Indian place previously, and my friend got the standard mango lassi.  Both were wonderful -- and filling!  You get a *nice* sized glass of lassi for $3, not a little glass better suited for jello pudding to be served in.  For whatever reason, their menu calls it \\"lashi\\"...which made me think of Lassie.  Weird.\\n\\nBoth portions were far more than either of us could force into our expanding bellies so we took them home.  I confess to fishing in mine on the way home and swiping out a piece or 2 of YAK.  Yummmmmmmmmmm. \\n\\nDishes are very reasonably priced, you can dine like royalty here if you're budgetarily-challenged -- there's not 1 item on the menu over $15.

Keep it to no more than 5-6 guests. They really don't want to be bothered with the hassle of looking after more than 10 people, and it reflected in the harried service my friends and I received. \\n\\nThe quality of the brunch was mixed. I myself ordered the American Breakfast (meat, eggs, toast, potatoes) and it was fantastic. I was a little disappointed at first when I was told they ran out of duck eggs that weekend, but the chicken eggs were cooked so perfectly I didn't care. The toast and house-made jelly and butter were phenomenal, but the roast potatoes were a little dry and underseasoned. I also ordered a side of raw marinated venison, which was tasty but a little heavy on the lemon juice and lacking a nice presentation when brought to the table (looked akin to dog food piled up a small plate). My girlfriend ordered the Pon Haus, a type of corncake topped with egg that was very delectable. Others at the table who ordered Latin-influenced dishes (such as the enchiladas and the Torta Ahogada) were not as ecstatic about their food as myself, making me think that Dai Due has the traditional breakfast nailed down but definitely need more work on their more exotic dishes. \\n\\nFor drinks, my girlfriend and I shared the Autumn Punch, a glass of still apple wine, and a glass of draft mead-ale. All the drinks were well-made, very delectable, and fairly priced, no complaint here. \\n\\nThe service was under par. My party waited for 10 minutes at the main entrance to the restaurant for a hostess to greet and bring us to our reserved table. We didn't get seated until I finally stopped an employee in the middle of the restaurant to let them know we've been waiting without anyone talking to us, at which point I was told it was because we were standing on the wrong side (there are two entrances to the restaurant; the entrance facing Manor is not the correct entrance). \\n\\nThe food and drinks came out at a satisfactory pace for our party of 11. The problems came when we were told that they would not split the check up for us, although almost every single person was paying separately. Although it would have been nice for the waitress to help us out a bit in calculating our totals instead of coming by once every five minutes to ask us if were finished figuring it out yet, I can't help but blame the restaurant's policy rather than the waitress herself. \\nInevitably, we messed up calculating the totals after spending 30 minutes passing the receipt around the table and trying to split up the total, tax, and tip. \\n\\nAfter venting our frustration to the supervisor, the management stepped in and helped us get out the restaurant after being there for over two hours, letting us know that they do not normally accommodate large parties in their establishment nor do they normally take reservations for lunch. I wonder now why then they even took my reservation to begin with if they knew it would be this difficult for the staff to coordinate. \\n\\nOverall, the food was as delicious as I remember when I used to order from Dai Due at the Farmer's Market, but now just a little more expensive due to the overhead of the staff and establishment. However, with that extra overhead it would be nice to have a little better service and attention instead of having to spend over half an hour trying to split up a receipt for 11 people, and then being told that it's only half their fault since they don't normally take big parties. \\n\\nAs a final note, there were quite a few people in our party who would've really liked some of the fresh-baked bread that Dai Due had displayed up front. If you're going to bake bread in front of us, maybe it might be a consideration to put some on the table? Just a suggestion, would have definitely improved the experience very much. \\n\\nWill try again at some future point.

I took it!  Usually (And I've seen this on Yelp and from the mouths of the ladies at reception at Le Cellier) it's a 3-4 month window of time since the place is popular and seating is limited (152 persons according to the seating limits on the sign) .\\n\\nAt the appointed time, and perhaps a little earlier, we made our way to the Le Cellier, beneath the Canadian Provence at the World Showcase in Epcot, and checked in. Immediately we witnessed one couple who tried to get seating being told about the 3-4 month wait, but also told that if they were planning on coming back to Epcot to try for lunch, when seating is easier. Once we checked in, we were told that they were running 5-10 minutes behind time, and invited to sit down in the ac'd lobby or we could stand outside but not leave the area between the bridges and they would come find us at the appropriate time. \\n\\nThey -were not- running behind. At 8:30 they came and got us, seated us and our waitress, Candice was pleasant and warm. She asked if it was our first visit and explained the menu. We opted for the French Onion Poutine (SO GOOD), the NY Strip and the Fillet Mignon.  She brought out the bread basket, which contained pretzel bread, which is by far my favorite bread!\\n\\nThe service was exceptional! The food was Good. The French Onion Poutine: Could I have this every day, please? Salty, but not overly so. Rich but in a good way. And so so damned tasty.

After we explored a cute little vintage boutique, and a strange little co-op, our tummies began to grumble.  Brunch time!\\n\\nFirst off, the interior of the place was truly so inviting and really what one would expect from a clean, comfortable, warm and inviting place to slow down, and enjoy a beautiful afternoon and meal.  They do offer outdoor seating, but my mom and I really just wanted to take it all in and enjoy people watching, and honestly I wanted to see what everyone else was getting.\\n\\nThe first course my mom and I decided on was a bowl of Blackberry Grits. Blackberry grits are basically southern style grits topped with blackberry compote. Let me tell you something: I've never been able to actually LIKE grits outside of my home, but these were something special. My mom said they were the best thing she'd had in a while.\\n\\nThey were so creamy, and a they actually had a bit of a chew which provides an amazing texture. The blackberry lent an almost desert-like-decadence while still being completely appropriate for breakfast. Basically, you should go get some.\\n\\nFor our entrees, I settled on quite possibly the least brunchy thing on the menu: The Grilled Tuna Wasabi salad - fresh gulf tuna, seared rare and sliced over mixed greens with cucumber, red onion & mandarin oranges. Drizzled with wasabi mayo, served with Oriental vinaigrette.\\n\\n\\nThe Ahi tuna on my salad was perfect for me, but I can see it leaned more toward totally rare than seared. I wouldn't have it any other way, but that's me. The quality was where the tuna wasn't at all fishy, had a really wonderful firm and tender texture, and the flavor bordered on mildly sweet. The wasabi mayo added just enough heat, but it didn't overwhelm at all.  \\n\\n\\nMy mom got the second least brunchy thing on the menu: The Southern Shrimp Salad - Marinated, grilled shrimp atop a bed of spring mix, with cucumber, mandarin oranges, sliced strawberries, feta & sprouts.\\n\\n\\nYes I wanted brunch, and some of you might be confused about the salads, but isn't that the beautiful thing about brunch? You can get whatever the heck you want! We had grits, and salad. To add more breakfast to the mix, I got a side of some country potatoes to even everything out.\\n\\n\\nI can't finish talking about Another Broken Egg Caf√© - Austin without mentioning the franchise co-owner Cody. The passion he has in this business and the drive he embodies is really very stimulating as someone who shares similar passions. The excitement he had in his smile and the truly charming nature about him made the experience very special.

The business occupies the former location of \\"The Old Spaghetti Factory\\" for those of you familiar with the area. You can park for free at the Camden Apartments garage or you can sometimes find street parking on the blocks nearby. The entry has the Torched Hop logo prominently displayed and there's a sign on the Penn Ave side.\\n\\nI ended up here with a few friends and fellow Yelpers - as I recall this was one of Michelle T's \\"Beer UYEs  or Sarah M who organized the gathering - that included several regulars - I'm not quite sure as it was a last minute thing for me to attend  - there were 8-10 of us sharing a big table upstairs. If you haven't experienced this place it's worth it just for the venue - industrial finishes with exposed brick walls, overlaid with rich woods and real hardwood flooring; and expansive views across a huge space. There's a mezzanine second floor (where we sat) that overlooks the first floor littered with tables, a bar and several manual-skill games. If you're looking for a venue for a party you could do much worse.\\n\\nThis is a brewery pub in the purist sense - they make beer here and offer decent food, much in the same fashion as 5 Seasons and New Realm. They also have a nice list of local Micro-brews as \\"Guest Taps\\" and a full bar with Featured Cocktails. I started by sharing a flight of the House Drafts - honestly I wasn't too impressed but I think this was more due to the styles offered:\\n\\n*    Hops-De-Leon IP - fairly solid IPA, lots of hops with some citrus, this was just tapped\\n*    Sherman's Wrath Smoked Porter - I love porters but this one was maybe a bit too smoky and felt flat to me.\\n*    Cukes n' Cream - I normally don't care for flavored beers and cucumbers with beer just sounds weird to me, but this one was surprisingly good\\n*    Saison in the Raw - nope, I just don't like saisons in general, it's sour in just the wrong way for me, actually in the sour direction past a Dubbel towards the sours I tend to pass on.\\n\\nI ended up with one of the guest taps, a Westbrook IPA which more than did the job for me.\\n\\nFor snacks we pretty much went down the list and ordered most of the Smalls:\\n\\n*     Hummus - Red Lentil, w/veggies and veggie chips - frankly I thought this a bit boring but it did satisfy the vegans among us\\n*    Herbed Fries - w/sriracha, smoked mayo, kimchee ketchup - not much to these steak-cut fries and probably the weakest app we tried.\\n*    Redneck Poutine - tots, sausage gravy, cheddar curd and bacon - loved this, but then again throw bacon and cheese on any tot and I-m happy\\n*    Cheese Board - Tomme, Sweetgrass Camembert, Hooks Blue - some decent cheeses here but there probably needs to be at least one other, either on the briny-side or bitter side to balance the sweet creaminess\\n*    Wild Game Nuggets - Duck and rabbit leg, w/blackberry Meaploy - I didn't get much from these - very crispy but not a lot of flavor.\\n*    St Louis Ribs - Sriracha butter, sweet pickled peppers - loved these and could probably finish a few orders by myself\\n*    Jumbo Whole Wings - Spicy and sweet paprika, peach chili garlic - not as spicy as I thought they would be and a bit over-fried.\\n*    Local Tomatoes - crumbled mozz, basil, croutons - loved these, perfect balance of acid-to-fat\\n*    Hot Crawfish Pimento Cheese - oregano parmesan crostini - awesome dip but I would have preferred it a bit spicier (it was perfect for others in our party - I just like really spicy)\\n\\nI think in general the food is pretty solid if a bit on the \\"bar food\\" side but that's to be expected. We ordered a couple of extra items before moving to Nancy's across the street. The service was a little lacking - we were off to one edge and it took some flagging of servers to get water and beer glasses filled.

This is now my ABSOLUTE favorite place to eat in Orlando.\\n\\nLet me start off by saying that Tony is one of THE BEST servers we've ever had. He truly went above and beyond to explain menu items and provide recommendations. We trusted him on all of his recommendations and literally ordered most of them (we like to eat lol).\\n\\nDrinks - for alcohol, my boyfriend got sake and I got a gin and tonic. Drinks were good. We were honestly more excited about their refreshers. I don't remember the names of them, but we got the lychee flavored one and the lime flavored one. They definitely lived up to their names cause they were definitely refreshing drinks.\\n\\nAppetizers - we started off with the gyoza and grilled octopus. The gyoza was tender and the sauce was BOMB! We even asked to keep the sauce on the table so we can use it for our other meals. The octopus was grilled beautifully and you can really taste the flavors that come out of it. It was plated on breaded Japanese potatoes and that was tasty as well.\\n\\nEntrees - we got the tonkotsu ramen and bi bim bap. Hands down, that was THEEEEE BESTTTTT ramen I have ever had. I can't even begin to explain how flavorful the broth was. The noodles were perfect and the pork belly was so tender. The bi bim bap was also delicious as well. The bulgogi was marinated to perfection and was so satisfying.\\n\\nSushi - Tony gave us a ton of recommendations for sushi, but we decided to go with the spicy tuna roll. The fish was fresh and the roll definitely had a nice kick to it. I wish we could've tried more rolls, but we were stuffed at this point lol.\\n\\nSeito sushi, you won my stomach over.

For our mains we did the short ribs (8/10) which was actually my favorite plate for the night, the cheddar grits were really tasty and ribs were soft and savory. My friend had the Tour de France burger on a pretzel bun (4.5/10) the burger was disappointing, the bread wasn't good, and overall the quality of the ingredients was low. We upgraded our order to truffle fries (0/10) and I seriously don't recommend doing that. The fries were soggy and tasteless. Then we tried the banana Nutella French toast (8.5/10) this one was delicious, lots of Nutella on it, bread was amazing! And to finalize we had the Brookies, Cookies & Cream Sunday (6/10) it's a big dessert but the cookies were cold and hard and that really brought it down for me. I also tried the cookies and cream chocolate shot from the gift shop and that one is a 10/10!!

I've spent more than my share of time wondering when places like The North Market will sprout up in Buffalo. Granted, Buffalo isn't Chicago, but we could certainly use something like this...\\n\\nThe North Market is a dream. It's no Quincy Market, but the fact that there aren't nearly as many shops makes the North Market a bit more low key than QM. I like it for that fact, and that I can appreciate the best of Columbus inside this little market.\\n\\nI went twice during my few days in Columbus and I was completely satisfied each time. The first day we spent wandering around the place, mouth a-watering from all the delectable options. I settled upon a hearty sandwich from Katzinger's and loved all the combination of flavors. Mmmm yes.\\n\\nThe second time I went for the coffee and a slice of pizza (which is an interesting combination, but early lunches call for both). I'm just so impressed that there really isn't a bad option in the North Market. My friend also grabbed a soft pretzel and he gave some of it to me. Oh my goodness, it was the most perfect soft pretzel of my life. I was hitting myself for not grabbing one before we left.\\n\\nI'd say the North Market is a unique highlight of Columbus. The area is definitely growing around it. It's kind of cool that Columbus isn't the biggest city around, but has one of the best public markets nearby. When we were leaving on Saturday, they also had a farmer's market in front of the building with fruit, veggies, eggs, etc. \\n\\nI hope to come back and try more food here.

I believe 12 donuts is around $6 (I could be wrong, I'll check and update accordingly). Each donut is about 3-4 bites each, and filled with either Nutella, sea salt, cinnamon and sugar, maple and bacon, or a combination of all of them. For instance; their Dirty Wu, Pips most popular donut, gets you Nutella, sea salt, and cinnamon on it. If you wanted to try out a few flavors, get 4 donuts. If you want to shares, get 8-12. They also have a secret menu with a smores donut (see my uploaded picture). \\n\\nAnother great aspect of Pips is that all of their teas, coffees, and drinks are the same price for a small-large. They also offer different types of milks for lattes and have a flight of chai teas to try!

He commended my food choice and placed the order with the kitchen.\\n\\nMy food came fairly quickly. My drink was wrong. It was Sweet Tea, but I wasn't that worried about it. My burger looked great, but I ate my salad first. It was quite good for a side salad. Nothing fancy, but exactly what I wanted. It had a reasonable amount of dressing, a generous amount of shaved parmesan cheese, and the perfect amount of croutons. I ate it in a few minutes. \\n\\nOnto the main course. The burger looked and smelled great. The taste did not disappoint, e hipither. It didn't even last as long as the salad.

It was very rich, the strawberries were fantastic, and the whipped cream really topped it all off.

He laughed and asked if I wanted anything else. \\"Nope,\\" I said, \\"I'll die if I eat anything else.\\"\\n\\nHe quickly brought me my check, and noticed I had barely touched my iced tea. I explained that it was sweet tea, which I don't care for much. He did not hesitate and said \\"I'm sorry about that. I'll have the manager take it off your bill\\".\\n\\nHe promptly returned with the updated check. I thanked him for his awesome service, and left him a solid 30% tip. Turner was awesome.

We got 6 mini donuts to split between 2 of us, one of each flavor, with the exception of the candied bacon maple (got 2 of those). They make them fresh per order, and they're obviously best eaten when they're warm. You can watch the guy make the donuts while you're waiting.\\n\\nInteresting to note that these donuts are really \\"mini\\". One person can easily eat 3-4 or more, depending on how hungry they are. The actual taste and texture reminded me of malasadas (Portuguese donuts). Pip's donuts are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The flavors are what really sets these donuts apart. Each flavor is uniquely different, and I like the fact that there are only 5 flavors (plus 1 seasonal flavor) to choose from. Keeps it simple. On the day we were there, they had cinnamon sugar, raw honey & sea salt, nutella & sea salt, candied bacon maple, the dirty wu and the seasonal flavor was sweet potato pie.\\n\\nTheir pricing is very affordable as well:\\n4 = $3.95\\n6 = $5.95\\n8 = $6.95\\n12 = $7.95\\nLimit is 4 dozen per customer.\\n\\nThese mini donuts would be great to take to a party or even an office meeting.\\n\\nI ordered a medium Smoky Robinson chai as well, and it was delicious.

They also have coffee drinks and other drinks, if chai is not your thing.\\n\\nThe service is outstanding. The staff members are all very nice and friendly. The inside itself is very spacious - I was not expecting that. Bathrooms are big and clean as well.

I really wanted to like it. From the second you walk in a magical sweet smell hits your nostrils and you see ice cream and candy galore. They have almost every chocolate you can think of and then sum. I will say this they advertised a 15minute wait and I only waited 5.  The ambiance inside the restaurant was amazing. It's decorated in a steam punk style and the servers are allowed to put their own flair. Then everything went down hill from here. We were sat and waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged by a server. Jaide took care of us she was a bright spot, she answered all of our questions. We ordered our appetizers the crab dip, chocolate bread, meatloaf for me and the pub burger medium rare for the lady, and then the wait began. After about 25 minutes one of our appetizers came, the spinach and crab dip. It was a little watery for my liking but flavorful. 2 minutes after that our entrees came! I asked to see the manager and Alyssa came over. She was there within 2 minutes. She apologized for the wait on the appetizers ( mind you we are still waiting on the chocolate bread) and wanted to make sure everything else was ok. My food was ok but the Pub Burger was cooked medium well not the medium rare as ordered. We asked how long for a new burger and she said \\"we try to make the recooks a priority but right now the kitchen is a little busy\\" my girlfriend decided to keep the over cooked burger and Alyssa said she would discount the check and offered to dessert. Not ideal but ok. Half way through the entree the chocolate bread came out. I was not a fan but my girlfriend loved it. The cookie jar milkshake was very good and in my opinion the best thing on the table. The bill comes my girlfriends burger was still on the check (should have been taken off) no discount applied. I did save 10% for being an annual pass holder. This place has all the pieces to be amazing just needs to learn how to use them!

The passionfruit was so good I wished we had gotten a dozen of that and then skipped out the rest! The other flavors they have is cinnamon sugar, raw honey and sea salt, nutella and sea salt, candied bacon maple, the dirty wu (cinnamon and nutella with sea salt) and then the seasonal flavor of the day/week. We didn't care for the candied bacon maple, it was too salty and a bit too much. We probably could've skipped out on getting the cinnamon sugar and nutella one since we ordered the dirty wu. Raw honey and sea salt was alright but again my favorite was definitely the passionfruit. I noticed the seasonal flavor seems to be a hit and a lot of people's personal favorite.

I'd have to try one of their other chais next time I'm back in Portland, but this is definitely a spot to come back to! Even though the line was out the door, it moves relatively quickly even when the donuts are made to order.

The service was good, our server was good, the food all came out quickly and right.\\n\\nWe had:\\nbeef tartare, which i felt could have used a touch more salt but i like a lot of salt, otherwise the beef itself was so tender and tasted great and i loved the mustard they used. also great tasting egg yolk on top, and i got to eat the whole thing since no one else in our group wanted it :)\\n\\nglazed carrots - soft, perfect, sweet, i could eat these all the time\\n\\ncrispy pork confit with apples and radish, the crust on this was just amazing and so crispy. perfect with the sour crunchy garnish. maybe could have used a sauce, but the meat tastes so good its not really necessary\\n\\npork neck chop, which was like a pork steak and it was the most interesting piece of pork i have had in a long time. very simple (no sauce or anything) but it tasted great anyway.\\n\\nDrinks were really reasonably priced:\\n$4 champagne on wednesdays, that was good if a little sweet\\nwe had the white and red on tap wines, and both enjoyed those and they weren't too bad pricewise. $2 firemans 4 can.\\n\\napple caramel biscuit bread pudding great end to the meal. a little dry for being a bread pudding i think, but my husband loved it being more dry, so it depends on what you like. but it still tasted good. only $6 for dessert\\n\\nOverall, everything was simply prepared and the ingredients had so much flavor: i think very true to that italian approach they are going for. they make it easy to have a complete meal, drinks and desserts are reasonably priced, i felt like the portions were big.

I have worked at chain restaurants to high end steak houses. I tend to notice things at a restaurant that other people do not..but probably should.  The Floridian Cafe has a picturesque setting over looking their pool and gardens.  You are sat at a marble table and given real table wear and linen napkins.  Check your table wear though since some of ours was dirty and needed to be replaced.  I was in a party of six and I am writing this only from my persepective.  Our waitress barely spoke any english which in itself is fine, but I noticed that the questions we asked about the menu were not answered.  Not because she did not answer them but rather that we could not  understand her.  We ordered appetizers that all seemed ok except for the cheese plate.  The cheese plate consisted of four pieces of cheese.  A slice of blue cheese that was good, a hunk of cheddar that was so stale that it was on the verge of molding.  And two other unrecognizable cheeses that were rock hard and inedible.  Along with the cheeses was 4 small pieces of bread.  I know what your thinking...the cheese is supposed to be like that.  Not these cheeses though..I know what most cheeses look like and should taste like..these were not exotic cheeses.  Needless to say I was not confident that my entree would be any good.  The second the server said that the plates were very hot I knew that the meal would be terrible.  Why would a hamburger with lobster thermidor need to be on a piping hot plate?  Trick question...it shouldn't..it was sitting under a heat lamp for way too long.  I asked for medium..as did my son and both came out beyond well done..they were hockey pucks.  After eating for 10 minutes the server finally came over to check on us when I informed her of the issues I had with the food.  She apologized and asked what she could do and if I wanted another one.  I passed of course. Also, the service was not too good either.  Four of our party got steaks and when we asked for steak knives the waitress brought them and dropped them all together on the table and just left.  Literally \\"klang!\\" and then just walked away.  Also, when our food was being served one of the servers who was delivering the food was holding one of the plates against her stomach and her top stomache fat roll was sitting on top of one of the plates touching some vegetables.  I am not kidding!  The service and food was equivalent to a noon time lunch buffet at a trucker rest stop.  We were on the Disney Dining plan and when I looked at the bill it was over $500 with the mandatory tip that is required.  Not only would I never eat there again..but I will never stay there or go to any event that facility hosts."},{"name":"Grand Floridian Cafe","address":"4401 Floridian Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The Grand Floridian Cafe was one of my preferred restaurants in the monorail resorts.

Without hesitation, we grew hungry around 6:30 PM and walked in without a reservation. Luckily, we were able to be seated in the dining area right away. We were greeted by our server, Doug who was great and took care of us the whole time. I would like to say that it seemed as though Doug was very impressed by how much food two young girls could take down! We started with the burrata appetizer and a salad. They also served complimentary bread with a bean dip. I ordered my classic martini and my colleague joined me and got gin instead. The martinis were perfect. I wanted homemade pasta and I decided to get sweet potato stuffed ravioli with a cinnamon butter glaze. Pansotti Di Zucca. Yes, I was in Austin and already eating enough for five people so I figured I would continue to treat myself. My colleague got a delicious pasta and short rib dish. As if all of that wasn't enough, when Doug came over and asked if we were interested in dessert (assuming we who'd grab our waists and say \\"no we're stuffed), we politely obliged and ordered two chocolate chip cannolis. We sat for a while before we left because we really couldn't move. Next time we go back there, I am definitely wearing stretch pants! We sat right by the kitchen and we could see all of the gorgeous dishes coming out. We also got to watch them make their handmade pizza and glop the pizza dough right in front of us.

The baristas and servers are all very nice but on my last visit here two different kitchen staff were both incredibly rude ! The tray was out of glasses so I politely asked one of them if I can grab one and he stared at me and then walked away without saying anything or helping me. Ok, if that's not part of your job then you can just say so, you are standing around with a Dalina uniform on, so it's hard for me to tell what is and isn't part of your job. But ok, I forget about it and ask someone else for an empty glass for my drink. Then after finishing my drink, I asked for the key to the bathroom and the person at the front counter nicely told me she just gave both the regular key and the staff bathroom key to other customers and that I could just wait outside until one of them came out. So I waited and when the woman came out she started to pass the key to the staff bathroom to me but one of the cooks was walking by and literally SNATCHED the keys out of her hands without saying anything to either of us and cowardly went directly into the freezer/store room without even looking at us. So incredibly rude ! So I just went into the bathroom since the lady kindly held the door open for me and he proceeds to come and yell at me that I need the key. Well yes, obviously, but you just ripped it rudely out of the poor woman's hands before I could get it. I get that maybe you don't want patrons using ur staff bathroom, but then don't give out the damn key and don't be so angry and rude to customers, just be a decent human being and explain it nicely. It's not my fault if your counter person told me I could use it but you don't want me in there. I was about to go back to order sandwiches but after that interaction there was no way I was giving anymore money to this place . I live in the neighborhood and used to come here often with friends but after this experience I would rather go to any other of the cafes nearby. Don't have an open concept kitchen if ur kitchen staff are going to give your customers appallingly bad attitude for absolutely no good reason!

My group of four ordered a mix of omelettes, scrambles, and sweet breakfast items. The standouts were absolutely the sweet items; we tried the challah French toast and the fresh blackberry waffle. The French toast was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with cornflakes added for extra crunch. The waffle was simply divine and the blackberries were perfectly ripe. Our server (whose name I failed to get) was personable, accommodating, and genuine. Any time there was an issue, he was prompt to see that it be solved.

If you don't love golf, but you enjoy activities like bowling and putt golf, you will still love Top Golf.  If you love eating and drinking good food and drinks, you will love Top Golf.  My favorite thing about this location is the shot tracer technology.  Not many Top Golf locations are equipped with the technology to show your golf shot shape, apex, speed  and distance.  The concept behind Top Golf is to hit golf balls at Targets in a driving style type set up, only there are 3 different levels, and your golf balls come with some sort of laser equipped technology so that your booth screen will show you which target you went in and what your score was.  There are a number of games to compete from.  Each person gets 20 balls to hit per game, and then after that you reset and can play the same game, or choose a different game to play.  All the while, you have a server who is taking orders for you on drinks and beer.  Every bay also comes with a TV that you can control from your booth, or if you have the Top Golf app, you can change the channel right from the App.  Watch Masters Sunday coverage, while hitting balls at Top Golf? Yes!  The hours are definitely cheaper earlier in the day.  The 2nd and 3rd levels are definitely better than the ground level.  It is definitely better to arrive early - especially on Saturday and Sunday.  It is not uncommon to see a 2 hour plus wait if you get here too late on a weekend!  Especially during holiday season and during the Summer.  Don't even bother coming!! Call ahead to check on times.   If this is your first time and you are considering if you should go to Top Golf, stop considering and go!  Such fun times!  Oh and, if you have your own golf clubs, by all means bring them! I have friends who feel embarrassed about bringing their golf clubs to Top Golf.  I ask them, if you had a custom made bowling ball, would you leave it at home, or bring it to the bowling alley?

So I was very critical of Abide's \\"Godfather\\" drink. \\n\\nBasically the same thing, the Godfather is way overpriced let me tell you. Abide's one cup size is LimeRed's regular size. The Godfather is $6.42 without boba.... You can get that at LimeRed for a large.

Also there isn't/wasn't a formal line to order so it was confusing as to who was ordering v. done ordering. So that was a little frustrating. This place gave me deja vu only to realize that Abide is the club Middlesex during the day.

I have to say I approve of the changes for the most part.  This location has always been underrated in my opinion because the staff has always been very helpful and the salad bar is excellent.  One large draw to this location are two large party rooms making it a destination for youth sports teams.\\n\\nIn the remodel as I walked in I was devastated initially to see the big salad bar was gone, replaced by a beer bar.  It didn't take long to notice that a smaller salad bar was installed by the buffet area.  I went over to check it out before ordering and was happy to see that most of my favorite things were still there, so I was happy.  The floors are now a wood laminate which lends to a much more Pub feel.  Other Pub additions besides beer and decor are a new menu of hamburgers and expended Buffalo Wing sauce choices.  The arcade was expanded as well, complete with tickets spitting out for the kiddies to collect and trade for toys.  When I saw this I was afraid they were going for a Chuck E. Cheese feel but luckily that was not the case.\\n\\nFor a large chain I will make a bold statement of the large chain options Round Table has the best quality pizza available.  There, I said it, and I stand by it.  Between the staff, the pizza, the menu and newly remodeled bathrooms that were in dire need of change I have to say that they took a good place and made it much, much better.\\n\\nWe were there yesterday for The Tax Deduction's (I refer to my son as the Tax Deduction) basketball team end of season party with the Wife, The Mom and The Mother In Law, and I have to say we had a ball.  We adults were at a table eating our salads, waiting for the pizza talking with each other and other team parents while the kids were in the arcade and it was really relaxed and fun.  \\n\\nHere is what I was not thrilled about.  The price of the salad bar, the downsized salad bar was $5.99 for one trip or with a meal and $6.99 a la carte.  You downsized it and left the price the same, attention management, knock off a buck please.  Soda selection was large, lots of spigots but only one diet beverage option, there used to be two.  \\n\\nHandicapped access was excellent, two parking spots near the door, big wide doors and super smooth floors, lots of room to maneuver a walker or knee scooter.

Very disappointed given this bakery is a staple of \\"little Italy\\". The cannoli was bland- I didn't taste any hazelnut flavor. These were eaten the day after I purchased them, so maybe that affected the flavor? They were kept refrigerated though. All three were left unfinished by both my husband and I. Would not recommend.

So, you order chicken (1/4th) or meatloaf and two sides or just order sides.  Two plates of food and one coke, at just the right amount to fill us up without having to take food home, was $2l.00. \\n     The only thing I could recommend would be for the staff to be more friendly and learn to smile and look someone in the eye.

The kids menu isn't printed on the main menu, but they have great smaller portions for the littles. None of that \\"kids menu\\" business I can't stand, like a sushi restaurant serving kids mac and cheese. It's got things like delicious flatbread and buddha bowls with rice, carrots, broccoli, peanut sauce, an a choice of tofu or chicken.

The ingredients are super fresh, homemade, and loaded with flavor. The crust is stone fire oven deliciousness. We always get our pizza made classic style with mushrooms, sopressata, ricotta, and meatballs. Nom nom nom! They also serve beer and wine. They have a few local brews on tap and those revolve. They have a good craft beer selection in cans and bottles, also. Once you come here the first time you'll start getting coupons in your email, too. I highly recommend the garlic knots and the meatballs with the lemon ricotta. These are not to be missed! If you try to come here on a Friday or Saturday night, expect at least a 30 minute wait. Also, you may have a revolving door of servers. No big deal, although a little weird. They are so busy and the secret is out so don't come here looking for 5 star service. They know their food is what brings people back. The hipster servers are just there to provide you with food and keep turning tables. They're not trying to make you their new best friend. It's also pretty loud in there with such a small space, all the chatter, and the music level is about a 7 or 8, designed to not keep you lingering.

It comes with the most amazingly seasoned pulled pork piled on top of yellow rice with a side of red beans,  a salad, and your choice of a side.  My side was the fried green plantains but they have the sweet ones too. The drinks were those famous banana and guava juices, you've probably seen them at Kroger. Everything was outstanding.

We started off with Shishito Peppers that are covered with sesame powder that dissolved when adding the lemon. We then went for the Brisket Bulgogi Potstickers and boy were they delicious! Probably my favorite of the evening! We also tried the Carolina BBQ potsticker and while they were amazing, they still didn't compete with the Bulgogi ones. We then went for the Tuna Tartare and again, super fresh tuna with the perfect balance of crunchy (came with Gaufrettes) and spicy and absolutely loved it. The 2 dishes that were a bit of a let down were the Teriyaki Bison Burger, that was rather on the dry side and the Garlic Chile Braised Octopus that didn't really have much flavor with it. Most of the flavor came from the accompanied salad and that was very average as well. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive that night, so overall I really enjoyed my dinner.

However, when my fianc√© and I dined here during happy hour on Tuesday and the restaurant wasn't very busy yet, we had a less than ideal experience. We were sat fairly close to ta young lady who was clearly training a new server. During our entire meal we heard nothing but this woman yell at the new server telling him \\"Wow you're just really not good at this\\" and constantly yelling at him and putting him down. It was extremely uncomfortable to witness, especially because the gentleman was getting increasingly angrier and uncomfortable. If I were him I would have left the first time she made a rude comment to me or talked in the tone she was giving him. To make matters worse, she progressed to cursing. We had to hear the F bomb numerous times and her saying how customers don't know sh*t about asian food. We couldn't wait to get out of there, I feel so bad for the new server and hope he chooses to work for someone who will treat him better. \\n\\nNow for our server and the food. Hayley (sp?) took care of us and was prompt and so kind! She took the time to explain everything and answer any questions we had. I ordered the summer rolls, which are so fresh and the herbs are amazing, not to mention the peanut sauce is to die for. I also ordered the curry laksa soup, which came with chicken, fried tofu, shrimp, noodles, and veggies. It did not disappoint! It had just the right amount of spice and the broth was delicious. I would definitely order it again. I hope if we return, the server manager or whoever she is, isn't working that day. Someone needs a lesson in professionalism."},{"name":"Pizza Bruno","address":"3990 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Been here several times and haven't been disappointed yet. The garlic knots are super garlic-y with a good marinara type sauce but I'm Italian so we like things with more garlic. Every time I have had them they are amazing. Just super fluffy and packed full of flavor. We also came on a Monday when they have wings, which we got with a garlic buffalo sauce. Insane amount of garlic on it, great char to the wings that honestly just had so much flavor throughout. A lot of times when you bite into a wing, after the skin is off it just tastes like regular chicken. Here the flavor went to the bone, it was awesome. And the homemade ranch they serve with is great.\\n\\nHad a wide variety of pizzas here. The KBAR is a usual favorite for my wife and I but we've also had the Blanca and Five-OH. Most recently we had the G&B which has blueberries and guanciale which is basically pork jowl but non-smoked. The taste of that, on its own, is basically a fatty bacon. Sliced super thin on the pie but with the blueberries it totally melts into a really delicious taste. The sweet and savory really blend on this pizza.\\n\\nAll of the pizzas we have had so far are just well thought out with a good balance of flavor. Me, personally, I like a little crispier crust and the crust they serve is not as firm. Has some char marks and a fluffy crust (which my wife usually eats, not me) but a good flavor. \\n\\nPizzas are small, around six slices give or take for what we have had. But the ingredient quality is the seller. The inside is very chill, low lighting with an urban flair. Service has always been quick for us the food also comes out pretty fast. We have never had to wait on a table longer than five or ten minutes and usually we walk right in. But, it can get busy. We also haven't had take-out from here yet.\\n\\nCannolis are also pretty good. We have had the nutella and I believe one month they had a peanut butter type cannoli. They are super sweet but they have a good flavor and are pretty large.\\n\\nTypically just for a pizza and appetizer we spend about $35 which gives us a nice meal the next day (as the garlic knots or wings are pretty filling for just 2 people).

Going there on a Sunday night, it's hard to come up with anything else positive to say about the place. Oh yeah, they picked the best salsa band in town to play there (the Brew). \\n\\nFirst, you should be aware of the new layout. The first two floors were uncrowded and reasonably pleasant. You can sit outside or inside with the AC. A separate entrance leads to the third floor. It's a large, open bar where the salsa band was playing. The dance floor was packed, and the setup is terrible. There was only a narrow path, which is also the bar area, to walk through from the front entrance to the entire rest of the third floor. \\n\\nThe music is great, and there is a beginner salsa class. The \\"good\\" salsa dancers generally won't go there, though. I'm not one of them. A dance floor packed with beginners like me is actually the reason the good dancers don't go there. I would recommend work boots and shin guards if you're going to dance. People (like me) will be constantly bumping into you and stepping on your feet. A lot of women there were dressed to impress, but I don't know how they survived with open toed shoes.\\n\\nThe overpriced food has been at best average for years. The service is still consistently terrible. Out of six people, the waiter completely forgot to place the order for one of the six meals. No manager came to apologize, nothing but an Oops! from the waiter. We waited forever for him to appear, and another eternity for the food, and then one of our meals simply never came.\\n\\nBeyond that, they only give you chips and salsa if you request it. They don't ask if you want any. While waiting for the first sign of our waiter, one woman in our group walked over to the bar to get some water.

Here is my assessment:\\n\\nCanolis- I've read some people received them when they were not as fresh, but this hasn't happened to me. The cream is perfectly light without being too sweet, and the crust is crisp and tasty. I also like the chocolate covered ones...yum!\\n\\nEclairs- When you take a bite and taste the cream inside, you won't be disappointed. However, the chocolate stripe for me is a little weird because it's made of the same stuff they use for their chocolate frosting. I'd prefer a lighter chocolate to balance off the cream, but overall these are decent.\\n\\nRed Velvet Cake- This was my first time trying this cake flavor, so I can't really compare it to others. However, I can say theirs has made me a convert! Red velvet is oh so delicious and I like their cream cheese frosting. Can't wait to try this one again.\\n\\nSpecialty Holiday Cookies- Each holiday they make sugar cookies decorated in frosting. This time around I tried ones for Halloween and they had cute shapes like pumpkins, ghosts, and bats. Kids would definitely find these cute, and although the taste was good, they were a bit hard.\\n\\nFruit Tart- Never again! I really like fruit tarts and I have ordered this on two different occasions in hopes the first bad one was a fluke. The custard in the shell is really bland, the crust is dry and hard, and the fruit consistently taste as if were doused in a lot of medicine. It's to bad, because they look so pretty, but don't make my taste buds dance.\\n\\nTiramisu- This is just good tiramisu...not the best, and not bad either. I'd prefer a stronger coffee taste, but the texture is right.\\n\\nAssorted Donuts- When you get these warm right out of the fryer they are awesome. I really like their sugar donuts especially.

The food was GREAT, however, they refused to provide tap water with our meal and drinks.  Instead, they offered us bottle water, for $1. Listen--it's not that I didn't have the money for bottled water.  However, when I CHOOSE your restaurant over the countless others on S.R 256--I'm expecting you to provide basic accommodations--tap water and ice are top on that list.  I basically had to get huffy with the bartender before she would flex on the \\"no tap water\\" rule.  This policy is dumb--not to mention illegal (if an establishment serves alcohol, you must provide FREE drinking water).  If you're being this stingy with water and glasses, you really need to reevaluate your business practices.  The money you save by refusing patrons tap water probably isn't worth the cost of a lost customer and a bad review."},{"name":"Pho With Us","address":"9900 S Ih 35 Frontage Rd, Ste 500","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"As someone that stumbled across Pho With Us during its soft opening while trying eat at the previous pho restaurant in the same location, I was extremely impressed.

The oxtails had about 9 or 10 bones with about 4 of them being huge ones. So moist, tender and full of flavor. The cabbage was cooked perfectly. It wasn't raw.

I'll never go back again.\\n\\nThe parking situation is now several multi level parking lots where it used to be a single parking area. However, while creating more parking spaces they have created more traffic.\\n\\nThe signs and the lights and the lack of proper flow makes the entire process one giant pain in the ass. I used to skip the main entrance and go in the back way, then park near the lake and walk in by Cirque. Now it is one crazy messed up cluster !@#$. It is horrible. 100% stupid. What engineer(s) thought up this crap?\\n\\nAfter we parked and made it in to the main area I found it completely over populated. This must be because the extra parking spots allowed more people to be jammed in like cattle. The more people the more sales, the more sales the more profit, the more profit the more they want to pack more cattle in to buy more over priced junk.\\n\\nOne of the new additions which I found to be faux pas, was the Disney food trucks.\\n\\nThis is just a good example of Disney's commercialism. Food trucks have a deep history of why they function in communities. Originally for construction sites, in the late 90's they became a way for entrepreneurial chefs to get out to the public with their quasi fine dining with a twist. Like having a Kobe burger with black truffles and smoked Gouda cheese on a fresh made French roll.\\n\\nInstead, Disney has put trucks in fixed positions serving processed foods out of bags and cans. It isn't any thing amazing or special. I looked at the menus and found it to be ridiculously over priced packaged food. I want to vomit when I think about them.\\n\\nOne of my favorite spots here is the AMC dinner theater which is now off my list of destinations. We walked over to the Planet Hollywood side and decided that it was so crowded that we would go back to cars and leave. There was too many people to make it towards the Lego area or Rainforest Cafe.\\n\\nTotally not worth the visit. 100% tourist trap. 100% over priced. 100% not worth my time."},{"name":"Delaney‚Äôs Diner","address":"6150 E Main St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Got there just in time before it got filled up.

It's nice to have an authentic Korean fried chicken restaurant ITP (inside the I-285 perimeter) and it sure beats having to drive to Duluth (e.g. Thank U Chicken) or even Fayetteville (Bonchon Chicken). The fried chicken and other Korean snack and street foods are tasty and service is good and quick.\\n\\nHello Chicken opened in November 2017. It replaced Lee's Tofu House which was formerly Korea Garden. All three businesses were/are owned by the same family. The daughter of the owner of Lee's Tofu House and Korea Garden, who formerly owned Harue Food & Cafe in Duluth (now Harue Korean Chicken Snack Bar), owns and operates Hello Chicken. This is a humble \\"mom and pop\\" restaurant.\\n\\nIf you ever visited Lee's Tofu House or Korea Garden, the interior of Hello Chicken remains largely the same. The dining room has a lot of tables separated by half-wall dividers for privacy. There's plenty of space and this place is great for groups. The inside has been modernized, to a certain extent, and made to look more fun with things like additional TVs (some playing K-pop, of course) and colorful wall art including playful murals of chickens. They even has beers on tap. All in all, it's a relaxed, clean, and comfortable environment.\\n\\nThe menu features Korean fried chicken in 4 different flavors for $19.99 (half and half orders available). These platters serve 2-3 people and include fried potato wedges and coleslaw. There's also 10 and 20-piece American-style wings (same flavors, $8.99 and $15.99, respectively). Street foods include fusion-type foods such as Korean tacos, kimchi bulgogi quesadillas, and kimchi cheese French fries ($3.50-8.99 each). Like Harue and other Korean snack food restaurants, Hello Chicken serves topokki (a.k.a. tteok-bokki or stir-fried rice cakes; $8.99-10.99), fried rice ($9.99), noodles (e.g. japchae), kimchi and seafood pancakes, and deep-fried pork and fish with rice plates ($9.99-10.99). Finally, you can build your own bibimbap (Korean mixed rice) in either a regular bowl ($9.99) or on a hot stone plate ($12.99).\\n\\n$8.99 lunch bowls (bibimbap or chicken teriyaki fried rice) and $9.99 lunch boxes (similar to bento boxes) are available Monday-Friday, 11am-2:30pm (except holidays) and at dinner for $2 extra.\\n\\nFour of us split Hello Chicken's $49.99 family combo (designed to serve 3-4 people). I thought it was ideal and just the right amount of food (we're all fairly \\"big\\" eaters). After tax and tip, this meal worked out to be about $16.20 per person -- not bad at all considering the amount and quality of food we received. Here's what comes with the family combo:\\n\\n* One order of fried chicken - we chose half and half, regular flavor and sweet and spicy flavor (other flavors are soy garlic and spicy)\\n* One bowl (bibimbap) - we chose white rice with spicy pork and most veggies (bean sprouts, broccoli, kale, carrots, onions, and radish) with Korean red chili paste (gochujang)\\n* Kimchi bulgogi quesadilla with fries\\n* One toppoki - we chose topokki with bulgogi\\n* Four-piece oden kochi soup - Korean fish skewer soup (a.k.a. odeng)\\n\\nThe fried chicken was delicious. The sweet and spicy flavor was outstanding and, hands down, better than the regular flavor (which was just okay). The fried chicken was tender, flavorful, and had an extra crispiness and crunchiness to it which was delightful. In hindsight, we should have ordered the soy garlic flavor instead of the regular flavor (more on that at the end of this review).\\n\\nThe bibimbap \\"bowl\\" was yummy. I put bowl in quotes because our bibimbap was actually served on a hot stone plate. We poured the spicy chili paste, which was served in a squeeze bottle, on top of the rice and veggies and mixed everything together while it cooked, sizzling, crackling, and steaming on the plate.\\n\\nThe kimchi bulgogi quesadilla and fries were surprisingly good. The bulgogi was beef. The quesadilla had a lot going on - many different types of flavors - and I really enjoyed it. The fries were those crispy, airy, and more orange-colored fries like the sesame fries that Yumbii serves.\\n\\nThe toppoki with bulgogi (also beef) and the oden kochi soup were A-OK. The rice cakes were appetizingly soft and chewy. This was the only non-spicy/red topokki dish on Hello Chicken's menu so in comparison, its flavor was more subdued. The toppoki dish had slivers of fishcake. As for the odeng soup, I liked it. It was simple and comforting.\\n\\nOutside of the combo, I tried a Korean fried chicken taco ($3.50). It was terrific. It was nice and meaty and packed with lots of fresh ingredients including Asian slaw, a bit of cheese, and a wonderful sauce.\\n\\nSmall update: I returned and ordered the soy garlic chicken and it was fantastic. The sweet and spicy and soy garlic flavors are definitely the two flavors to get here. Don't order the regular flavor. It's not as good. I also tried the veggie toppoki ($8.99) and liked it a lot. You can vary the spiciness level on any toppoki dish."},{"name":"Tijuana Flats","address":"8274 Champions Gate Blvd","city":"Champions Gate","stars":"3","text":"First time trying, and honestly impressed.

Went with a coworker and was a bit thrown off by the counter menu.  Wasn't a complete menu and had no prices.  We decided to sit down and that was much better for us.  Full menu complete with prices. The service was very good, the waiter explained the specials and we both opted for those.

Soft and tender on the outside, flakey outside...perfection!  The sandwich was chock full of sweet yummy pork and covered with a crunchy slaw.  I needed more than just a half sandwich!  Soup came next, a large portion...well maybe...2 shrimp which had no flavor but they didn't skimp on the squid.  I think I offended someone when I started picking out the dried onions-because he walked over and said \\"why are you doing that?\\"  I didn't have a chance to explain that onions usually make my belly ache before he told me next time to tell them to leave them out and they would.  I really like this place.

Our waitress told us that we couldn't order dinner there, but whatever, it was comfortable and the drinks were good. Apparently, at some point the hostess had seen us seated there, and had assumed that we were just going to eat in the bar area so she took us off the list.\\n\\nAn hour later I went down to ask about the status of our table, only to discover we'd been totally passed over because of the crossed signals of her seeing us seated but (apparently) not being aware that they don't serve dinner at the bar. She apologized, and put us at the top of the queue. Maybe the hostess (or our waitress) was new, who knows, it just would have been nice if they would have confirmed whether or not we still wanted a table instead of crossing us off the list.\\n\\nDon't let this dissuade you from going there, I guess, if nothing else, make sure you make it clear that you want to eat dinner at an actual table in their dining area if you're settling in for a 30+ minute wait."},{"name":"Clover Food Lab","address":"100 Burlington Mall Rd","city":"Burlington","stars":"4.5","text":"This was our first visit to the Clover BUR location, which we made after they reopened from their corporate-wide shutdown.

I never even knew that this place existed until I heard some coworkers talking about it.  I just thought the second level of the market had seating and that's it.  I implore you to explore a little more and make your way to the top floor because it's worth it.  I ordered the \\"Warm\\" chicken sandwich combo that comes with double mac n cheese.  It was so filling that I took the second scoop of mac n cheese to go to eat later.  The sandwich comes with two slices of white bread on each side because one slice just can't handle the behemoth that is the piece of chicken they give you on the sandwich.  I'm not a huge bread fan so i took two pieces of bread off and ate it with a knife and fork.  I'm sure that violates a ton of unspoken rules, but it was still delicious.  I routinely eat pickled jalapenos and the \\"warm\\" was pretty similar to the same heat.  It's counteracted by the slaw and pickles on the sandwich.  The mac n cheese was super creamy and cheesy.  The sandwich meal was $13.  Each patron can help themselves to free sweet or un-sweet tea. The yelp checkin offer of free banana pudding was a delicious ending to the meal.  The topping on the pudding was both salty and sweet, which was a great juxtaposition to the sweetness of the pudding."},{"name":"Greenbeat","address":"486 N Orange Ave, Unit 4","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"The light Cobb is my favorite.

I love being able to get a pumpkin spice cannoli in the fall, a chocolate dipped cannoli on a cold winter day, and a refreshing strawberry cannoli in the summer. One that they don't often have behind the counter but sometimes have in the back room is the mint chocolate chip, which I also love. \\n\\nThe only drawback is that they don't take credit cards (kind of a hassle to always carry around cash in the North End) and there is really no organized line formation.

For years, she has always talked about visiting this landmark location.  We made reservations at least a week in advance to ensure that she would finally be able to go to this restaurant.  The food and service really met our expectations.  \\n\\nHowever, after today's visited I have mixed feelings about our experience and would think twice about visiting this restaurant again.

It's a bit typical but I do appreciate how nicely packed the salad roll was (nothing worse than a salad roll that just falls apart when you pick it up).\\n\\nI also ordered the Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings ($11.50) which turned out nicely as well.

The ladies were dressed in white uniforms. The look was very sharp and sentimental to a different period of time. We asked a female staff if indeed for a first timer it should be a cannoli and she agreed. \\n\\nWe continued to look over the cases as others hovered too. My daughter decided on splitting a chocolate chip cannoli after some discussion with staff. The woman seemed annoyed to help with questions.

We were lucky enough to score a table that someone had just got up. Overall considering how busy the joint was it was clean. My daughter enjoyed and ate every bite. We both thought very good, not blown away by it for all the hype. We probably needed another item to compare. \\n\\nI'm torn on this one and will take the the low road at a 3.5, rounding down.

Was there a long line of people waiting for an employee? No, there was one other small party also looking into the pastry cases. Did someone come over and ask us if we would like help? No! And that's OK except for a few other things...\\n\\nMaybe this one's on us, but we'd like a little more consistency in pricing. Sure we could have asked for each individual item's price, but we would like to think that an approximation can be made from the menu board. This was simply not the case when we received the bill. (For those curious, we ordered 5 things of various types and had a total of 19.75).\\n\\nAs for customer service, a positive was the employee we sought out to help us behind the counter was friendly and quick to retrieve our items.

In the course of wanting to eat at the tables we discovered a few disquieting facts:\\n1) no readily accessible silverware\\n2) no garbage cans\\n3) where was the table service?\\n\\nWhen I walked up to the counter in front of two employees, I waited patiently for the young lads to finish their task and acknowledge me. Neither employee did, nor did two other employees that walked by with no apparent task of their own (judged by the contents in their hand [i.e. nothing] and the pace of their movement). Finally I asked to be excused for interrupting them and asked for two forks. The employee grabbed for two plastic utensils, tastefully gripping them by the ends, and then for no apparent reason rubbed his hands along both forks at the end that you put in your mouth.

They totally beat out the other two famed Portland doughnut places in my book. \\n\\nDoughnuts start at 4 for $4. But if you get a dozen it's $9, which is the best bang for your buck. I'm pretty sure they do not sell just single doughnuts. Because why. Only a monster would buy ONE SINGLE DOUGHNUT. In contrast, they even have a limit on how many doughnuts you can purchase: four dozen. Like, think about that for a sec. Their doughnuts are so good that people just come in here and buy 48 doughnuts!??!\\n\\nTheir flavors are: Cinnamon Sugar, Raw Honey & Sea Salt, Nutella & Sea Salt, Candied Bacon Maple, the Dirty Wu (basically a combination of all the other flavors minus bacon), and a rotating seasonal flavor. When I visited, it was Black Cherry. My girlfriend & I tried all of the above and our favorites were the plain raw honey & the candied bacon. They were all so delectable! \\n\\nI'm not a fan of chai tea (too many spices if you ask me) but Pip's chai tea was amazing. Yes, you absolutely need to pair your doughnuts with their chai tea. All their chai is handmade in small batches & in-house!\\n\\nI definitely recommend the Chai Flight if you come with someone because WOW so many flavors and it's also super fun to try! It's 6 oz of each flavor (5) for $15. \\nThey even have a customized wood board for their flight so you know exactly which flavor is which. You can order it hot or iced - but they have to be either ALL hot or ALL iced. Even though it was a sunny day, we ordered it hot cause I feel like you can definitely get more aroma and flavor that way. Also, maximum comfort. \\n\\nIt's hard to pick a favorite, cause they were all so good. The only one I did not love was the Smokey Robinson - chai tea made up of vanilla, cinnamon, clove, Assam tea & Lapsang Souchon. Pip's has dubbed it the \\"Campfire Chai\\", and while I personally did not like this one very much because it was TOO SMOKY, I can appreciate the fact that they've actually managed to capture that smoky campfire essence. \\nIf you like the taste of fresh smoke and getting a mouthful of pine tree scent, this is the one for you! \\nOk for the record, my friend did enjoy this one. \\n\\nGinger Rogers - ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, molasses, Thai chile and Assam tea: This one's the \\"Spicy Chai\\". I loooved the way it set my throat on fire. Not sure if they use ginger syrup or fresh ginger, altho it felt like the latter cause there's that kick from the ginger. The ginger complemented the chai very well. The ideal sick day tea, if you ask me! \\n\\nHeart of Gold - coconut, turmeric, clove, cardamom, Assam & Genmaicha tea: I don't remember tasting very much coconut in this one but it was a solid chai tea. In fact, this one's probably the closest to \\"regular\\" chai tea you'd find in most cafes.\\n\\nKing & I - cardamom, clove, anise, Thai tea: tasted so much like just Thai tea. Really good, especially if you're a fan of thai tea. I especially enjoyed the bold black tea flavor!\\n\\nEmmylou - lavender, chrysanthemum, chamomile, honey. There's no caffeine in this one! I feel a little like this one can't really be classified as chai tea cause there aren't any spices, but it was still delicious. The Emmylou was described as \\"very comforting\\", but honestly I found all their chai teas (sans the Smokey) to be very comforting. I definitely felt soothed. \\n\\nIf I lived in Portland I would totally pick up a box of Pip's and a hot chai to-go, snuggle up with a blanket and pass out cause I've maxed out on comfort (and probably too many mini doughnuts). \\n\\nI suppose it's a good thing I don't live in Portland."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Expensive, mediocre food.

I really enjoyed the cinnamon sugar, raw honey and sea salt, and their seasonal lemon doughnut. The Dirty Wu was a bit too much topping and really took away from the actual doughnut. I also loved that they're made to order so when you get them, they are warm.  We also ordered chais, which was pretty good. My BF really liked the Heart of Gold, which was the coconut chai.

I went to the grand opening and I've never been to a \\"restaurant\\" that had a cover charge to get in, let alone $10. I ignored it seeing as that it was the grand opening and when I've been to other se√±or frogs there was a $5 cover charge; But even then at other locations they gave you a free souvenir cup with your paid admission which then you could pay to fill up once inside.\\n\\nIt was not completely bad since the ambience inside was pretty good as well as the music. But that was quickly swayed once you saw the drink menus prices. Especially since the servers go around taking your drink order and asking you what size before youve even gotten to see the drink menu or prices.  I've seen large 20+ ounce drinks go for around $12-$15 at other places but here the drinks started at $14-$19 for the smaller 22oz drinks and $18+ for the 28oz drinks. I thought to myself \\"you know what this is se√±or frogs, so if they're charging that much they must be pretty strong drinks.\\" so I ordered one.  I instantly realized that it was definitely not worth it as there was maybe 2oz max in their 22oz drink. I would assume for the price that was being payed you would actually get a decent drink. Don't let them fool you by them saying that they are disguised as juicy drinks because that is what they are juicy drinks. The only way they will \\"sneak up\\" on you is if you drink at least 7 of them which you think you can drink 7 22oz drinks, more power to you but a heed of warning this will easily empty out your pockets at close to $85+ not including tip.  As even refills are ONLY $2 less than getting a new drink.\\n\\nOn a side note, I don't know if many of you are tequila drinkers but on they're menu a couple of they're margaritas claim to have Juarez \\"reposado\\" tequila.  Which if you know they don't make a reposado tequila as Juarez doesn't make a 100% agave tequila as it is comparible to montezuma tequila, which is like drinking popov or mccormicks vodka. So for a place known for it's margaritas to lie on they're menu about what tequila they use is disrespectful to se√±or frog name.\\n\\nEven at the end of the night they have flaws.  Now I know security is responsible for herding people out at the end of the night, but you would assume they would be asking those who were actually drunk and heckling people to leave. I say this because as we were leaving there was a table with 3 or 4 old guys heckling people and making comments.  Now I could understand if they managers or owners that security would not ask them to leave. But if they were I find it unprofessional for a owner or manager to be drinking, getting drunk and heckling their guests in their place of business.\\n\\nNow don't get me wrong the music was good and the staff was friendly.  But that nor the Se√±or Frog name will be enough to keep this place busy for more than a few months.  Although I'm sure they know it as they're already trying to hide it as they've deleted any negative comments people left on their Facebook page so that others dont see it.\\n\\nPS:  if you do see any 3+ star comments they are mostly likely se√±or frog staff members trying make the place look better than it is, and they should know that technically those that work at the location they are posting about are not supposed to according to YELP guidelines."},{"name":"The Greek Corner","address":"1600 N Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great food.

Almost an hour wait to be seated, so we chose to order for pick up with only a 30 minute wait instead. We ordered the Crimson Ghost. I'm not even sure how to describe the sauce as anything but delightfully unique. The combination of hot soppressata and sweet honey was married together with fresh basil and mozzarella, making you only crave more! We also ordered the wood fired artichokes - these were a bit of a disappointment (more melting of the cheese in between the many leaves may have been better? And perhaps longer cooking time to make it a big more tender?) but had a great balsamic dipping sauce. Next time I will be trying the garlic knots instead that I had eye-balled as they delivered to another table during our wait. Overall I am excited about this spot and will definitely be returning for more pizza !!!\\n\\n\\n2nd visit (?12/2016): kale salad appetizer was OK, but I actually like the taste of kale so slightly disappointing as it is overly smothered in Parmesan. If you love cheese and trying to sneak those greens in, choose the kale salad.\\nGot the ninety-two pizza which was good, but mighty salty. Doesn't matter, crust and red sauce is still amazing. Pies are consistent.\\n\\n3rd visit (01/22/17): O. M. G.

And, if we're getting deep here, 'Mexican' food is not 'Mexican' food. It all depends on region, state, etc. There's a lot to choose from and expectations will and should vary accordingly. So, all that said: Superica is d@mn good Tex-Mex.\\n\\nThat means chips & salsa. That means queso. That means drinks with lime. Are you ready? Get ready. Actually, before you get ready, get a table. That may be a challenge. People love this place and tables have a wait. A long wait. I came here on a Thursday in mid-Spring and the hostess was, all, 'Yeah, you *wish* you were getting a seat.' My friend and I gave our name and left to roam the Market to find another place to eat. The tables in Superica weren't full but we were told there was a wait. Knowing me, you can guess how that went over. My friend had the good thought to return to the restaurant and hit the bar. The point was to get lit BUT it just so happened that you can eat at the bar... with no wait... picking up what I'm putting down?

I wasn't driving and I had no where to be. That's the best kind of drinking. Everything I had was very enjoyable and I can see how/why Superica could be a turn up spot.\\n\\nRecommendations = eats. With all the booze I was putting in my belly, I should soak it up with food. Since I was Tex-Mexing it, that meant queso. That meant chile con queso. That also meant chicken fajita nachos. Oh mah goodnuh. I love me some Tex-Mex but don't have occasion to have it often. Every bite was a wonderful memory. AND, there's plenty of gluten-free options. You can gorge without worry, y'all. I was planning on eating more but I was full. Me. Bottomless belly. Full. Think about it.\\n\\nSnark = people watching. As a very busy bar/restaurant, Superica attracts all sorts of people.

The restaurant itself is clean and well decorated. Having just opened, I understand that they are probably a little understaffed and the wait can be long. The service is not excellent, but it is not so bad either. Our waitress was quick to bring over water and take our orders, but never really checked on us after that - even after the food had arrived. I have been here three times and have had the chance to try a bit of the menu. The appetizers are a bit over prized, specially the fried yucca ($7 for 7-8 sticks). You can find tastier, bigger, warmer and cheaper fried yucca at Inka Chicken up in Round Rock. The anticuchos were very small for the prize as well. I found a better option for anticuchos at Ceviche7 ($4.00 for thick slices and more pieces). I do have to say the tamal de pollo that I had was pretty excellent. The masa was solid and the tamal was filled with plenty of chicken. Very yummy. The main dishes I have tried were not that great. The best by far was the tallarines verdes. The meat was tender and the sauce had a pretty authentic taste. The aji de gallina, on the other hand, lacked seasoning and it was not spicy at all. The arroz con mariscos was not so bad, but unfortunately the shrimp was overcooked and the dish itself tasted bland. I had a chance to try the cau cau and was taken aback by the fact that I only got three small squares of potatoes in the whole dish. Also, there was not much cow tripe and there was barely any sign of salt - most of the dish was just a big heap of rice. I did try my brother's lomo saltado and found the meat to be overcooked and the authentic taste was just not there. Their pisco sour is not bad at all. I had the premium one, I think that is what it was called, and it was very strong and tasty. The maracuya pisco sour was lacking pisco and a sweetner. Overall, I am happy that there is a Peruvian restaurant so close to home and I will go back periodically to check out any improvements."},{"name":"Santo","address":"1265 Alpine Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"If Santos is trying to be more sophisticated than a typical Southwestern/New Mexican restaurant, they should have a more sophisticated staff. \\n\\nWe began our dining experience at the bar. When we're sitting at bars were not there to hear stories from the bartenders, or to talk to the bartenders. Female bartenders get it. A great local example of great bartenders who are focused on high quality service without chit chat or flirting is at the Kitchen Upstairs, in case the owner needs a local example of a sophisticated and professional place to drink cocktails without worry. HIRE FEMALE BARTENDERS: \\n\\nWe don't care about the bartenders, who they are, what their stories are, etc. except to the extent that they make good drinks in a timely fashion and deliver them discretely and quietly without interruption. \\n\\nGreat bartenders, like great wait staff, are invisible. We didn't come to Santos for a bartender show. The women in our group complained about how few women serve as bartenders, yet how much more comfortable they feel when there are female bartenders, especially in an open fish bowl setting like the one at Santos. Santos had no female bartenders. \\n\\nThe women in our group mentioned that they don't want to be hit on by the men bartending anywhere nor do they want to have to feel the discomfort that comes with some unstated obligation to chat with the bartender simply because they're chatting them up. HIRE FEMALE BARTENDERS \\n\\nOnce we moved to a table, the staff was slow to bring water (Leave a bottle of water on the table ready to go since you already set them - no one likes to wait on water). It was 5-10 minutes before Carolina, our waitress, came to the table. It was busy, but that's no excuse. A bus staff or water pourer, or even the hostess could have checked in, but it didn't happen. Carolina wasn't great. She's curt, constantly interrupted the conversation as she provides services, and seems untrained and uncomfortable with herself as a waitress. She definitely didn't come off as polite and courteous, more transactional, efficient, and as if she was trying to control the experience. \\n\\nI know that when we get a chance to dine with friends we want to engage and connect with them, not the wait staff. The wait staff should be on top of things, but entirely invisible. You don't have make a scene to pour more water or bring more water once you get around to the table. \\n\\nThe lengthy explanations at the beginning of the meal are pointless. Let the food speak for itself, or answer specific questions if someone has them, but no need to try and tell us everything up front; it feels like lecture. \\n\\nFew people care who the chef is at a restaurant, or who owns the restaurant. People care about whether or not they get great service, high quality food at a reasonable price, and are well served. And, every great chef we've ever known doesn't care if anyone knows who they are. They all now that people will figure out who the chef is, if they want to know, after they experience the taste of great food. It comes off as cheap and unprofessional to do a little advertisement about the chef before you've even eaten the food. \\n\\nAs for the food, it was delicious - so good job chef. I can't remember the name of the chef, again, because no one cares and it doesn't matter, but the chef prepped awesome food and we loved it. Everything is rich and flavorful. It's also spicy in most instances. There are non-spicy items on the menu so the restaurant should group the non-spicy items together and make clear, as they do on the current menu, that the rest has spice. I'm suggesting a non-spicy section. The note at the bottom of the menu can remain (all items not on the non-spicy list have varying degrees of heat). We were very appreciative of the warning up front as several people in our group can't handle heat. Make clear there is some super yummy non-spicy food on the menu. \\n\\nFood was good, bartenders and service staff unsophisticated and unprofessional. We'll try once more in a month to see if anything changes. For now, 3 Stars.

To Jersey Jews there are few words more holy than \\"Jewish Deli\\".  And, incidentally, few words more blasphemed in Boston.  In a town that worships the pagan Dunks gods, the search for good bagels is essentially the Exodus.  \\n\\nSo I definitely expected good things from a Jewish deli smack dab in the middle of Boston's Little Jerusalem.  But, like most things for Jews in history, it ended with disappointment.\\n\\nI mean, it wasn't that bad.  We had the stuffed cabbage which was really  good, flavorful and still with a bit of heft to the cabbage.  The potato pancakes kicked Mamaleh's greaseball version to the curb, though there was barely enough apple sauce to notice.  The matzoh ball soup, a real test, was pretty tasty.  Nothing astonishing, but pretty good.\\n\\nBut the knish.  Oy, the knish.  A knish is a big fat meat/potato pie with fried, flaky crusty happiness around it.  Zaftig wrapped a ball of cheese in a sheet of filo and called it a knish.  It is not a knish.  It is an abomination.  Again, I'm overstating it, but if you're going to sell knishes in a place called \\"Jewish deli\\" in the most Jewish part of Boston, you can't be bringing me these weak-ass meatballs.\\n\\nAll in all, it's basically a less upscale version of Mamalehs.

However, this is not to say that Mike's doesn't make a good cannoli, after all, the line out their door on cold Boston days seem to suggest otherwise.\\n\\nI had a friend visit from out-of-town and she wanted to try the famous cannoli and so I accompanied her and ordered a red velvet cupcake. I was told that the frosting was a mix of buttercream and cream cheese frosting but the taste was missing the essential cream cheese element that is key to a great red velvet cupcake. The cupcake was very cold, stale, stiff, and all manners of not-fluffy-and-light-and-delicious. The frosting felt like biting into a block of very firm butter. Needless to say, the cupcake was not enjoyed, which is a shame because they're quite large.\\n\\nMy neutral rating of 3 stars is a mix of my personal ambivalence towards cannolis, my disappointment with their cupcakes, and most of all, my desire to give them the benefit of the doubt seeing as people who do like cannolis are willing to wait out in the cold for them.

I wanted to take them to a someplace special since I don't get to spend time with them very often. We saw a write up for the restaurant  in a local magazine and it looked interesting.  Unfortunately it was not a great choice. The server was friendly but every time we asked for something she seemed overwhelmed and unsure of herself. I started to feel bad if I asked a question. She also wasn't very observant and when I finished my wine early in the meal didn't want junk to ask if I wanted another (which I would have had if asked).  The food was not as good as expected. The menu didn't offer a great variety and the explanations of the offering were so pretentious I had to google some of the descriptions to figure out what they were trying to say. The cheesy biscuits were heavy and not very tasty unless you slathered it in the condiment (not even sure what it was - perhaps some kind of butter??) my father ordered the spicy chicken sandwich but before ordering he asked the server about how spicy it would be and she said that it is not really spicy except for the hot pepper that is skewered to the bun with a toothpick that he could take off. Truth was it was very spicy and although he ate most of it he made a joke about having a fur extinguisher for dessert which totally went over the servers head. I had the burger which was awful - dry, covered In s thick coating of cheddar cheese that tasted grainy, I had to scrape the cheese off to eat the burger. The one highlight of the dinner was some very yummy Brussels sprouts. Wish I knew how they made them because I would love to eat them again but I will definitely not be returning to the Rockmill Tavern.

I asked why, since they do custom cakes, and the person said that they have a few more options for \\"larger cakes\\" but not for smaller cakes. Ok, fine.

I liked the lamb dumpling ravioli dish and also liked the blowfish tails which were small but extremely tasteful. \\n\\nService: It took some time for food to arrive and I wouldn't say the service was slow but you might wait 20 or so minutes.\\n\\nOverall, the ambiance was more formal and less casual but I wouldn't say many people in suits were in presence. The lighting was dim.\\n\\nProbably won't come again as the price was much too high to come without a strong reason but a nice experiment since it's close to MIT where I go to school."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We ordered two cannolis: pecan caramel and Florentine.

Two of us opted for salads with scallops added. We each received an appetizer size (super small) salad with four scallops each.  The price for this was $32 a person. I can't think of anywhere in the world where you would pay this for a SMALL salad with 2 ounces of fish. When we got the bill, we thought it was meant for another table as they listed this as a \\"seafood platter!\\" Had we simply ordered the scallops dinner, it would have had a full size dinner plate with lots of steamed vegetables AND SHRIMP for two dollars more. This should have been explained to us. We mentioned this to the server, again, thinking it wasn't our bill, and she spoke to the manager who took one half off of ONE SALAD bringing the one salad down to $17 which is still high for a small salad but within range of a fancy New York restaurant.

The burgers here have all been misses for me. When they're flavorful, I'm not a huge fan of the flavor. And sometimes, the burgers are not flavorful at all, and rather tasteless. Either way, I don't understand why everybody loves Hopdoddy for the burgers. You're paying so much and ingesting so many calories, but the meal isn't even enjoyable? Hard pass.\\n\\nThe last time I was here, I got a special burger. It was the truffle mac burger with arugula. I have to admit the truffle fries here are great, so I wanted to give this place another try with the truffle mac. I was hugely disappointed. The burger itself was flavorless, and the size was not huge (so seriously, where are all the calories coming from?). There was so little arugula that I had to take off my bun just to make sure they put it in at all (they did, which is disappointing because now you know how little they put). For a \\"gourmet\\" burger, this is unacceptable.\\n\\nMore specifically, the mac & cheese was fried, but other than the texture, you couldn't even tell it was mac & cheese because there was 0 flavor. And truffle usually is really easy to taste/smell because it has a rather strong aroma, but again, there was nothing. The patty was indistinguishable from a normal patty you could get at, say, Shake Shack, and there was so little arugula you wouldn't even know if you had gotten some in your bite.\\n\\nOther than that, the fries and the milkshakes were good. But, they were nothing unique so I would not come to Hopdoddy to get the same thing I could get at many other places. Kinda mad tbh that I spent gourmet burger money on this last burger, and ingested SO MANY CALORIES in the process, but yea.

We met Crystal and Jasmine, and they were amazing servers! Jasmine was in training, and was very eager to give great service, and she did just that.

They were seasoned with a creamy sauce which was pretty good. Crab legs were typical. They also have oysters and shrimps. There's a small desert area of cakes but it's not really appealing. The ice cream was good though. \\nThe service was good. No complaints."},{"name":"Vick's Restaurant","address":"5320 N Orange Blossom Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"I understand that the restaurant business is difficult. I even understand and expect that when a place is brand new there are bound to be a few kinks that need to be worked out. But in this case we had hardly walked through the door before it became evident that this place is faltering right out of the gate.\\n\\nWe arrived for lunch after 1pm. Since they present themselves as an international steak house I was surprised to find that the interior of the restaurant is configured pretty much exactly as it had been when it was Perkins. The overall decor has been toned down but the space certainly did not give off a rich steak house vibe. In fact, Marty remarked that it was amazing that for a brand new space it already had a run down feeling.  \\n \\nWe walked into the entryway to find one other couple already standing at the podium with no greeter in sight and a staff of servers passing by here and there doing their very best to avoid looking our way. Seriously, is it too much to ask that you actually look AT your customers rather than THROUGH them? It's not like I'm Medusa - you won't turn to stone just from looking at me! Anyway, we were already feeling like our presence was more imposition than appreciated, but we still settled into line behind the other couple to wait. Several minutes passed before the hostess finally appeared and seated the first couple addressing them in a manner that made me think that she had already interacted with them prior to our arrival - basically just grabbing up menus and saying \\"right this way\\" as she led them to their booth. Throughout this exchange she perpetuated the warm fuzziness by  never once looking past them long enough to make eye contact and acknowledge us. But since we are gluttons for punishment we continued our wait with our invisibility cloaks firmly in place and watched as the server at whose table this other couple had just been seated, remarked to the hostess in an exasperated manner that he thought he was done for the day before begrudgingly walking over to take their order.\\n\\nBack to the podium came the hostess to answer the phone that was now ringing  and still without a single glance in our direction (our direction being two feet in front of her face) started to deal with the person on the line. Finally she put the call on hold and actually looked at us. Cue the Hallelujah chorus. At this point did she say \\"hello\\" or \\"welcome to Vick's\\" or maybe even \\"I'm so sorry to make you wait, it's been a little crazy\\"? Nope. She simply said \\"Give me a minute\\" turned around and once again disappeared.\\n\\nWhen she returned this time I thought for sure this was when she would actually greet us. This was when she might even apologize for thus far blowing us off. All I want is my fair share. All I want is what I have coming to me. (obscure A Charlie Brown Christmas reference for those of you who may be wondering but I digress) Anyway, I was wrong. She simply looked over and asked \\"Do you guys want a booth or a table?\\" We \\"guys\\" opted for a booth and so she led us over, plopped the menus and paper napkin wrapped service wear down in front of us and left with nary another peep.\\n\\nThere we continued what was now our only apparent raison d'√™tre ... WAITING!!!! After another 10 minutes of being patently ignored passed by, we had reached the end of our rope, got up and walked out. No one seemed to care although they would have had to have paid enough attention to us in the first place to know we were there before they could notice or care that we were leaving. \\n\\nOn the way out I held the door for a woman who was struggling to exit as she maneuvered to get her Mom's wheelchair through. (Again none of the actual staff saw fit to come over and assist.) But there's that whole you have to look at your customers conundrum again in order to help them.  She and and her Mom noted that we had never had anyone ever come over to our table. Yes, other customers were more aware of what was going on in the restaurant then the actual restaurant staff. When we said that we had indeed sat there without ever getting any service she remarked that we didn't know how lucky we were. Her very words \\"It was awful\\". They had sent most of their meal back uneaten.\\n\\nThroughout  our entire time at Vick's, there was no evidence of any type of manager on the floor. There was no one who seemed to be in charge at all or concerned with what was going on (or not going on). There was no one who seemed the least bit enthusiastic.

There are also various levels of heat to choose from. Drinks that are either sweet tea, unsweet tea, or water are free which is awesome! Alongside your entre√©, you also get the options for two sides. I went with the chicken sandwich, spice level hot. For my two sides I opted for both baked beans and Mac and cheese. Seating is open, it's kind've a picnic table concept which I like. Once you order, your name is taken and you grab a seat. Your food is brought out and from there on you enjoy! At first bite, spice caught the back of my throat and I coughed. However, overall flavor of all my food was fantastic. Creamy Mac and cheese and flavorful beans were a great addition.

Yes, it's a hole in the wall, laid back, casual, and cramped restaurant (I've been to high end places in the heart of the North End that are much more cramped than we were there however), but our waitress and host staff were friendly and helpful (Our waitress was old school Italian..she was sweet..a little rushed, but I think she just knows what she's doing!) and never did I feel like they were trying to get us out of there.

I knew exactly what I wanted. The reviews were pretty high for the rotisserie chicken and the seafood ceviche.

Of course I couldn't pass that until I realized I was drinking high fructose corn syrup with yellow number 5.  But that was all good. What I came here for was the food.\\n\\nThe rotisserie chicken was moist but a little under flavored. I was expecting more because I had a great experience of Peruvian rotisserie chicken in San Francisco (Limon Rotisserie).  Compared to Limon, this place is 5/10. I meant the chicken was generally good but nothing special. I could just go to Costco and get a rotisserie chicken and just be as satisfied without having to drive all the way to Gresham. The salad was nothing to rave about. It was just iceburg lettuce w/ some tomatoes and cucumber. The fries were soggy but I am not a big fan of fries anyway so I didn't care so much.  They had five different kind of sauces for you to try. Nothing amazing about them. One of them was sriracha sauce. The other big disappointment was the ceviche. It said seafood but it's mostly squid. There were a lot of onions and toasted corn that was inedible. Just imagine half done popcorn (they felt like hard kernel that you could break your teeth trying to chew on them). I have had way better ceviche in the Portland area. \\n\\nDespite my above comment, this place was packed. The dining area is not that big and  with minimal decor.

If you wanted to add a couple of slices of jalapeno it would cost you another $2! The fries were extremely cold and leathery, and to be honest with you this hamburger and fries combo was not even on par with Whataburger. My wife's entre consisted enchiladas that look like they came out of a frozen TV dinner, and without exaggeration came with about 3 tablespoons of rice and 1 tablespoon of guacamole for the bargain price of $13.95.

I splashed some of the 'spicy' sauce on it -- and that just tasted like crushed red peppers. Strike one. Strike two: my ribs weren't as 'fall off the bone' as I prefer them. Plus the texture was off...they were covered in a dry rub,( which COULD have been fine if it tasted better) ... anddd then drizzled with some honey fruity concoction...which ruined everything for me.

I have to say it was much better than the ribs, but still a lot less moist than it should have been...and there was still the sauce issue. \\n\\nSides were good... we had potato salad and mac n cheese.

If in Boston's North End / Little Italy section, you will want to find an Italian bakery and a pizzeria.  And there is plenty of \\"literature\\" instructing one where to go.\\n\\nI've only been to this city twice, with the last time including a foray into the historic North End which had been in front of my face all along the first time I went to Boston.  The consensus is that one goes to Mike's on busy Hanover Street for their cannoli and Italian pastries.  And, sure enough, Mike's turned out to be a popular place, with a line out to the sidewalk which dissuaded me from going in.\\n\\nAs it turns out, I was out at Castle Island from which you can see both the port and Logan Airport from \\"Southie,\\" or South Boston, where the protagonists from \\"Good Will Hunting\\" were supposedly reared.  A few neighborhood ladies, dyed-in-the-wool Irish-American Bostonians out for a walk along the waterfront at Castle Island, were nice enough to give me some tips on where to go to slam dunk some things down the hatch.  And, when they heard I was considering Mike's for baked goods in the North End, they emphatically proclaimed and nodded \\"Modern.\\"\\n\\nModern Pastry is sort of diagonally across from Mike's.  And, when I was there, there was surprisingly no line, while there was a line at Mike's.  I was still debating.  I then walked in and looked at the display cases.  There was no need to go anywhere else.  \\n\\nThe employees were definitely helpful and they're not being too busy might have helped.  I ordered two or three items, which looking at the photos will remind me what they were, and had a hot beverage. I remember that the pastries (along the lines of a cannolo, a mille foglie/Neapolitan, and a strawberry tart) ordered were incredible and that I should not go back because I would order those same two or three items again!  And I thought how, in Los Angeles, with its 4 million people, there were good Italian bakeries, but nothing quite like this.\\n\\nModern Pastry is bright, though the tables are on the smaller side.  The prices are fair.  (I think that they do well when you consider the volume.)  And everyone seemed to be in a good mood chowing down their incredible treats.  I was sandwiched in between a table with a couple where the husband had a Boston College sweatshirt and another table with some young ladies visiting from Chile.  And, a senior from the \\"old country\\" who was apparently a local even nodded to folks with friendly acknowledgment as he made his way into and out of the pastry shop.  That trilogy made for good karma.  \\n\\nIt's all here.

Not quite like a chef's table, but the next best thing.\\n\\nCame with two others and I was able to try all six tacos on the menu. Averaged $11 a person. It's funny that it's called Trill, a word associated with Houston, color-changing paint, styrofoam cups filled with violet viscosity, and hip hop.  I think Frill Taqueria would be a more apt name. Be aware that the tacos made here have nothing in common with anything you would grow up with in a Hispanic household, so I'm incredibly confused about the review below mine talking about how these tacos are \\"the most authentic.\\" If they are authentic to anything, it is solely the ultra-healthy, local, very pricey, out-of-the-box vegan-friendly fare synonymous with keeping Austin weird. \\n\\nI think that if you're a vegetarian with a hankering for interesting vegan tacos, this is probably a great place. You should definitely try it. But beef eaters may find the meat tacos are on the back burner. Both the pork and beef tacos are just simple meat, nowhere near as interesting as, say the butternut squash/mozzarella/chard taco I had yesterday, which definitely reached i-didnt-know-tacos-were-capable-of-this quality. If I come back, it's definitely for that taco. But I don't even remember the pork, which looked exactly like the beef cheek.\\n\\nThe beef cheek has stiff competition from your typical fresh San Antonio barbacoa on a Sunday morning. The homemade salsa wasn't quite enough to make it unique. The chicken salad taco felt a bit like honey mustard fried chicken in a tortilla, which was kind of cool. \\n\\nI appreciated that the beet taco made beets (not exactly my top 5 favorite veggie) very taste good and fresh. The water content was almost like a tomato, maybe since the local ingredients used here are so fresh. \\n\\nThe sweet potato taco was so heavy on large chunks of sweet potato that it was hard to appreciate much else within. I could do with dialing back on the amount of sweet potato, which a bit too much of a soft ingredient to make a full focus--like biting into a taco full of avocado and nothing else.\\n\\nOverall: Would recommend this place to a jaded vegetarian."},{"name":"The Rolling Rooster","address":"13717 Mopac Service Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I went on a rainy Friday night for a fried chicken craving.

When we got our meals one had no slaw or pickles. I wasn't impressed by the 4 slices of regular ole Schwebel's bread. Don't get me wrong, from a business stand point, you are on point serving up inexpensive items to go along with decently good chicken, but as a consumer I would have really appreciated it at least being toasted so it didn't get soggy... as it did. Since I had to head back to work, I wasn't able to enjoy the food at it's hottest prime moment, but it was okay, maybe even mediocre...at best. I likely won't return for lunch at all since that won't go over well at work more than one time.

More often than not we could not get a reservation because the restaurant is a little smaller than other EPCOT restaurants and the food had always been outstanding, if a little expensive. Fortunately, after not getting in for a number of years, two weeks ago we did get a reservation and were so excited. That excitement did not carry over to the end of the meal. While we knew that the meals were always expensive, the entrees are now outrageously expensive. And while we had never had less than an outstanding meal, that also was a disappointment on this visit. While the food was certainly good, the beer cheese soup is still outstanding, overall the meal was an expensive disappointment. Nothing special at outrageous prices, quite a disappointment. Plus, it was our impression that Disney jammed in more tables than the previous times we were there, making for a very cramped dining experience. We were able, without trying, to find out and hear all about the Disney experience of the New Jersey family on one side of us and the Long Island family on our other side. Expensive, cramped, nothing special, such a disappointment compared to our previous experiences at this restaurant.

I came back a week later  in hopes they were open and they were! I walked in ready to try this high rated ramen restaurant and found that there were only 2 diners in and was thinking to myself, \\"yes, quick easy service!\\"\\n\\nUpon entering the establishment you order at the front and they give you a numbered card, take a seat and wait for your food.\\n\\nFood review:\\n\\nI ordered the Black Tonkotsu which essentially is black garlic oil mixed with I'm assuming with shio based broth from the hint of saltiness I tasted. When I got my bowl I noticed that it was stacked with yummy goodness. The bowl was almost completely full of ingredients, perfectly cooked noodles that had a nice chew to it. The seaweed was plenty and the Charsiu was perfectly cooked that melted in your mouth and the best of all they gave you a full soft boiled marinated egg instead of just half. If you know my reviews of Ramen soft boiled eggs are always my deal breaker and not only was it perfectly cooked and marinated they give you that full egg instead of half!\\n\\nWith all that great stuff happening what kind of drew me off was the ginger that didn't go well (for me) with the overall flavor and would rather have bamboo than the ginger garnish even though both are really a powerful ingredient. The broth was also a little too salty for me for a shio style ramen. But, the price you pay and the quantity you get with most of the ingredients  is definitely worth the price tag.\\n\\nEnd food review.\\n\\nMy dining experience could also be better as I was sitting at the bar table and hearing all these conversation about how low the employees getting paid and how they can't worth for tips anymore. I can instantly tell most of the waiting staff are still in high school but hearing these conversations and complaining about pay was a bit distracting. What also was distracting was some of the staff were making fun of pronunciation of a Japanese word along with making a really annoying \\"quacking\\" sound for a good 5 minutes to the cook; that and one of hte waitress who was hanging in the back impersonating a \\"surfer californian\\" accent stating, \\"you ever hear Californian's talk? like, totally rad, like, dude, surf's up\\" hmmm.. she must've known i was from California was my thinking."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Lambert's, I dig your sexy historic building.

There are also several high end clothing stores and some mid-range clothing stores too. The Lucky location is quite spacious, much larger than the one at Tampa's International Plaza. The mediterranean design of the shopping areas of Disney Springs gives off a very Southeast and Southwest Florida meets Spain meets Southern California kind of vibe. This is not just an outlet mall with bland somewhat uninspiring architecture like Tampa Premium Outlets or even some outlet malls that dominant the Orlando shopping scene.

Best time is weekend mornings around 10:30-11am. they still adhere to the same practices of stamping everyones hand on the way in with numbers and matching them on the way out which is cool so nothing to worry about. The way these places has changed is they are absolutely immaculate and not one machine was broken. You can visit and just play games or you can order pizza and sit in a reserved booth and watch the same mechanical show that looks similar to years past. Token machines take dollars or the best, credit cards and dispense in $5 amounts. There is still a crawling tunnel but they ditched the ball crawl which was probably smart since germs festered there.

Tea leaves are sold by the gram and you can smell the flavors prior to buying. \\n\\nTea Drinks: If buying tea leaves isn't your thing, highly recommend grabbing a drink. I got an iced tea and it was delicious! Flavor for the drink (which does fluctuate!) was a Shanghai Green Lychee Tea and it was fabulous. \\n\\nInterior: Super cozy on the inside. Definitely can see myself coming here to read/study.\\n\\nService: Quick and friendly! The worker who made my drink was super nice and pleasant. \\n\\nRandom note: If you want some peace and quiet, I suggest coming here in the morning or after lunch time. I came here around 130ish on a Sunday afternoon and found the place to be pretty empty. \\n\\nOverall, pretty happy to have discover this place and can't wait to try some of the tea I brought!"},{"name":"Seito Sushi","address":"4898 New Broad St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is one of the best restaurants in the Orlando area if you're in the mood for Asian food.  The interior of the restaurant is upscale and modern, as is the menu.  I've had two different sushi rolls there and their beef pho ramen soup.  First, the sushi is outrageously good.  I went with my mother, who has almost no experience with sushi or Asian cuisine.  In fact, this may have been her first or second time having sushi at all.  We ordered the Sweetheart roll at the recommendation of the waitress, and we both loved it!  The beef pho/ramen noodle soup though stole my heart.  It's all about the broth with these soups, and this broth was amazing.

A woman then came over and I ordered my omelette but it was not an omelette just an egg scramble and It was tasteless. The liquid she used to coat the pan looked like melted butter but tasted nothing like butter. Everything else was mediocre at best. Prime rib appeared dry and overcooked.

There is a reason this place is killing it in stars! Atlanta doesn't have very many fantastic Mexican restaurants in my opinion and when I lived out here I struggled with finding some that compared to what I was used to back in California! \\n\\nI came here last night with a group of friends and we were hit with the 2.5 hr wait!! I can honestly say that I've NEVER waited this long to eat at a restaurant. My best friend was so adamant in that we stay and wait. Cool I'm on vacation but I'm also hungry af! So a couple people out of our group headed to the bar to get some snacks and drinks to keep our minds off the wait! Only problem with drinks is it intensifies my hunger pains lol. Grouchy and all I waited and waited to finally be seated and at last! The feast of what we can call some of the best TEX-MEX began! \\n\\nFor starters our party of 8 was sent some compliments from the chef because it somehow must've been communicated that we had been waiting for a crazy amount of time! We were sent out some flautas, beans and cheese, queso dip and fresh guacamole and chips! Everything was fantastic! If the appetizers were this good I can imagine what the actual entrees are like. The most popular item ordered amongst the group was the verde chicken enchiladas! I opted for the fried egg option for $1 more and it was well worth it! The \\ncheese fondue with chorizo is an alliterate but I included this with my meal! Absolutely delicious! My entire table was impressed with their food! \\n\\nConclusion: would I return? You bet! I would've loved to give them 5 stars as a rating but the wait time and the fact that they DO NOT take reservations blows my mind. A place this popular and busy that doesn't take reservations is insane!

Wow, what a dreaful experience.  The food was truly dismal.  We started with Carrot Ginger Soup and their Irish Nachos.  The Carrot Ginger soup was burning hot and extraordinarily bland.  The Irish nachos were decent.  We then moved on to pork medallions with veggies and potatoes and red snapper.  I was told the pork medallions would be tender.  They tasted like pork fried steak at Denny's.   They were tough and chewy and extraordinarily salty.  The veggies (zuchini & corn) were mushy and too salty as well.  The mashed red potato side was ok but once again too much salt - and I like salt!  My boyfriend had the red snapper which had been cooked with olives and tomatos.  Well it tasted like it had been sitting in olive juice for days.  All you could taste was olive!  And the fish was definitely overcooked and dry.  Dessert was the only decent thing (oh, and the cocktails).  We had berry trifle and creme brulee, both good but not fantastic.  As we finished dinner, we realized that we were the last folks in the dining room and that they were closing up shop.  No big deal except for the fact that the kitchen staff were talking to each other in raised voices and it was very unpleasant to finish up our last 15 minutes there with people yelling at each other and swearing loudly.  Also, our server had a problem running our credit card and he and the manager had a big argument about how to fix it about 10 feet away from us so we could also hear them fighting as well.  Now I hear that breakfast / brunch are truly Mother's specialities so perhaps I picked the wrong meal.  However, the dinner and experience were so bad, I'm not sure I could make myself go back.

It has been a long time since I have come back to eat here, and if it wasn't for someone's Christmas party I probably would not have come in. I use to love coming to Shabusen, a great place to just stuff your face with a multitude of food, afterall this was the 'go-to' AYCE place to hit up for the Korean BBQ, Chinese Hot Pot, and Japanese Sushi all put into one, just either book the table, or line up and get your group here with hungry bottomless stomachs and go to town on the food, yes, those were my youthful days, back when there were two locations, now there is just this one, and from coming in here, I can tell you nothing has changed, where there has been no facelift, the small seated boats at the far end are still intact, the washroom handles still look like something an amateur woodworker made, the lighting, the floor, everything is how I remembered it... except the food that you are eating\\n\\nNot coming a long time, I did not know they removed the hot-pot option, so you are just left with the BBQ and sushi option, and a sheet is given to you just to mark off what you want, and the feast begins. Be warned, if you are looking for 'green' options, you can really forget about it, there are none, from the sparse servings of overly sour kimchi, to the overcooked edamame, that's practically all you are really getting. Where do I even begin with this dinner, with the sushi portion, so you put in an order, and they bring stuff like nigiri, sushi, and limited sashimi, and even cones. I can say that anything that has rice attached to it... have fun, as this is the most foolish thing to order lots of. The trick here is to give you so much rice, to the point every bite is like eating a bowl of rice, to let it sit in your stomach so you do not want to eat anymore, and you really cannot do anything about  it, cause the restaurant can call food-wastage on you, and they can impose something like no longer serving you. The sashimi portions were pretty pathetic, as we ordered this spicy mixed sashimi dish that looked like the ends of fish, all diced up in small bits, over-sauced and mixed, then tossed on a platter like prison food for all to enjoy. The cones, these were massive.. on the rice ends as well... you keep eating these, I guarantee you aren't going to last too long into this dinner.\\n\\nThe BBQ meats ordered were a poor shame as well, from the pork to the beef ribs that we started to order, the first piece of meat had a ratio of 70-30 fat to meat. The beef ribs, if you were lucky, weren't overly chewy, we even eventually ordered lamb and chicken, and because of the sauce marinated on the meats, everything tasted the same, didn't matter which animal you were eating, just that you had to cook it.. and cook it right before you were eating charcoal style meat from the burning that would happen. The cooked food initially ok was also a letdown, from the order of smelt, they would have been better off giving this to us raw, for us to cook, instead of heavy battering this to the point you couldn't even recognize that it was fish, as every bite was pure batter. The fried tofu wasn't all that bad, but anything that was deep fried was also in a similiar batter, and as I said, it gets tired real fast.\\n\\nSome may think it cheap, but when you total it all up it comes to about $30'ish a head, and if I was going to do AYCE I would rather run over to the River Rock and eat their buffet, at least there is more variety if not some greens to balance. Even ice cream, we had to add money, as it was not included in the meal, they had some coffee jello, and we were treated to some pretty fresh slices of oranges as a saving grace, and luckily the mood of the crowd I was with was festive, but beyond that I would not think of coming here again, it's not worth it even if you are not paying.\\n\\nIt's sad that this place use to me my 'go-to' but now... I steer clear, way clear. Probably lucky they are in downtown, as it was a pretty packed night but even if you are one for quantity over quality, be warned...... this meal is not worth stomaching."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Absolutely one of the most horrible customer service I've ever experienced.

I had never had pho or banh mi so early before and now I believe that eating them first thing in the morning is the best way to do it.\\n\\nI tried the iced coffee, pork and shrimp spring rolls, and pho and bbq pork banh mi. Everything I tasted was absolutely incredible, minus the pork and shrimp spring rolls. The spring rolls weren't bad, they were just okay or average for what you usually get. Lee's Bakery hit it out of the park with their iced coffee, the pho, and the banh mi.\\n\\nLee's Bakery is very popular for its banh mi and I can see why. First, it's all about the baguette. The baguette here is perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It's perfect. The bbq pork is flavorful. Surprisingly, the pickled veggies were my second favorite part. They complimented the baguette perfectly. I wouldn't mind eating just the baguette and pickled veggies.\\n\\nThe pho was solid. It didn't slap you in the face with flavor, but it was clean and light. I loved having it for breakfast. The brisket and steak were incredibly soft and tender. The steak would fall apart in between my chopsticks. \\n\\nThe iced coffee was the best wake up call anyone could get. It was very strong and flavorful, but it didn't coat my tongue with sugar due to the milk. Usually, Vietnamese coffees are too sweet for me and I can taste the condensed milk sitting on my tongue. Whatever condensed milk they use at Lee's Bakery is just right. It tasted like it was added just to dilute the intensity of the coffee.\\n\\nOverall, I LOVE Lee's Bakery. I will make a priority to visit whenever I'm in Atlanta. I love the details at Lee's Bakery from the food to the restaurant itself. Your essentials like sriracha, hoisin, spoons, straws, and chopsticks are available at your table. There was no need to ask for anything else.

I think a half order would be fine next time, but I was hungry so I still polished off the full order. \\n\\nI tried a bit of the salmon hash and it was decent. Not too memorable imo. Still yummy though! Brought some variety of texture to my otherwise biscuits and gravy meal. \\n\\nThe French Toast was my least favorite. I'm not big on crunchy toasts, and my fave aspect of traditional French Toast is the soft texture so I didn't know what to expect. The toast was just covered in the corn flake crust, and didn't have much flavor otherwise. \\n\\nThe drinks were both yummy! I love a good Bloody Mary, and this one had a great level of spice. The mango spice was also quite tasty, but the winner is the Bloody Mary for me. Can't beat a $10 price tag though! ($8 during happy hour!). \\n\\nSo happy I was able to stop by here during my trip.

This used to some Korean soup place, a traditional Korean restaurant, a tofu stew house, etc. I am not sure if the owners are changing constantly, but the servers, at least many of them, remain the same. My concern in the past with the restaurants (what they were) it did not have the \\"it\\" factor to draw in many people. It was just like any other Korean restaurant trying to survive around Doraville. \\n\\nI am glad that it is a Korean fried chicken place now because they don't have a competition. I believe, in the past, the restaurant was struggling because it had so many competition. Now a Korean fried chicken place, I think it may pull it off this time. \\n\\nThe prices are pretty standard. For a chicken set, you pay about 20 dollars. This gets you a lot of fried chicken or combination flavor, enough to feed 3 people or so. Plus, they add in the potato wedges, which are covered in the sauce you pick for the fried chicken. I had the \\"Korean spicy fried chicken\\" and the soy garlic chicken. Out of the two, I preferred the \\"Korean spicy fried chicken.\\" The soy garlic was fine, but I felt it was overwhelming with honey (sweet). Yes, there is the flavor of soy sauce, but I could not overpass the honey part. It was garlic flavor for sure, but there was a battle between honey and soy continuously. The spicy Korean chicken was good. It is not spicy as you would think, and it lacks that kick that Korean look for. I think the general American population can handle it. It was sweet and savory at the same time. I felt it could be better, but it was good enough to basically be ok around Doraville. \\n\\nI was happy to many people in the restaurant, especially a diverse crowd. Previous restaurants in the past was not so diverse. \\n\\nOverall, this is a great place to chill, drink, and eat Korean fried chicken without having to drive 20 miles to Duluth. It is within the OTP area, and it is a great stop.

I told her this wasn't what I asked for, and she has the nerve to raise her voice and get mad at me. I told her, in the same steely, dismissive tone, that her business got it wrong, and I specifically asked for one mixed item.\\n\\nLittle Miss Princess huffed and made a scene and had me wait 15 min to remake the simple order. Then she just threw it on the counter (instead of handing it to me) and said \\"there you go\\".  Maybe if they hired some staff that could understand basic customer service skills (not to mention understand their CUSTOMERS, and, oh, I don't know, ENGLISH!), they would have got a better review. \\n\\nAs it is, they're super arrogant (which makes no sense if you look at the staff there), and undeserving of of the privilege of my business."},{"name":"Muzzarella Pizza & Italian Kitchen","address":"7780 Lake Underhill Rd, Ste 108","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Food was fresh and served hot.

So many dessert options! This is a dessert enthusiast's heaven. I like that this place has the option for dine-in (table service). That is something that Mike's Pastry doesn't offer. Also, they have a larger area inside for dining in (more tables). There is no outdoor dining option. This is a cash only establishment (same with Mike's). They offer more dessert options outside cannolis than Mike's does. I tried their chocolate rum cake and plain ricotta cannoli (the original filling) with pistachios. I liked that the cream was cold and that you could customize your cannoli. You choose the shell, filling, and then the outside topping. They have a ton of dessert options here that include things like lemon bars, tiramisu, coffee, pie, creme brulee, macarons, rum cake, and so much more. I seriously do not know how they are able to maintain that many dessert options at all times. I like that their cannolis are smaller than Mike's because it made it easier to eat. They even offer mini cannolis. These would be great for a catered event or potluck. Everything was very fresh. I didn't care for the rum cake as much because the cream was very thick and the cherry on top was too sweet but my fiance devoured it. The cannolis here were much better than the one I tried in Venice, Italy and the one I had in Syracuse."},{"name":"Common Ground","address":"319 Broadway","city":"Arlington","stars":"3","text":"Horrible experience, service sucked.
