I wouldn't say it's worth the wait, because in my opinion, nothing is worth the wait, but it's definitely worth getting up early for and heading over before there's a line. The egg/omelette dishes are all fantastic. You can taste the quality of the ingredients, everything is flavorful, and made fresh to order. The portions are generous, not ridiculously huge like Gravy, but much larger than some of these newer, hip but unfulfilling spots.

The three (pictured here: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/X0z6FAw48MIXuo6uhuwJQw?select=XDPY_f2bnbVfI5SzlIeD9A#P5LGSTX4KBqZoTpTgjHkcQ) were as follows:\\n\\n- Raspberry parfait, lemon curd, coconut (not detected, and thankfully). This was a contender for favourite and the combination was just deadly. I would love to eat such a dessert every day till the end of time.\\n- Milk chocolate ganache, rum infused bananas, walnut. I love desserts with a hard topping and creamy insides, and this one delivered. Cutting through the ganache was like getting through an icy surface, and beneath it was a slurry of boozy bananas. Delicious!\\n- Strawberry and rhubarb cobbler with vanilla ice cream. Also very good, and served warm, but unfortunately even two appetites like ours weren't able to finish it.

The egg was super delicious! I tasted my mom's Mi-So-Hot/Mi-So-Not and it was salty, which is saying something because I love salt. Overall, not bad, but probably not worth the hour wait.\\n\\nMy biggest issue was the service once we got inside. You order at a counter, and then go to your assigned seat, kind of like Hopdoddy. Food came pretty fast, which is great, but god help you if you want to linger over your noodles or even want a second tiny glass of water while you wait for everyone else to finish eating. Pretty much the second you look done, servers are rushing over to ask if they can take your bowl. My mom is a slow eater, so we all were just waiting for her to finish. The servers took all our glasses, bowls and plates so by the time she was done the table was practically cleared and we were all thirsty. \\n\\nI totally get not wanting people to linger too long, especially when there is a line out the door and wrapping around the building but there's a balance to be struck there. Definitely felt like you were being kicked out the door the second you sat down."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

A couple people ordered margaritas and we all ordered some variety of enchiladas, burros, tacos, and fajitas. I ordered a pulled beef soft taco and cheese enchilada with beans & rice and a diet coke. The diet coke also came in a gigantic glass and came with free refills (I literally think I drank 2 liters worth of soda...)! The taco was REALLY good, and I was so happy that it was able to stand up to T-Bell. The enchilada was pretty good, basically a pile of cheese. The beans and rice were also good - but the spiciness levels across the table seemed to be a little inconsistent. Some of my friends could barely eat their meals because they were so spicy, meanwhile I was dowsing mine in hot sauce.\\n\\nOverall, the place was fun and the food is cheap and filling.

And looking at the dinner menu online, I saw plenty of odd combinations - beets, ch√®vre, white chocolate, jalapeno and pistachio, for example. Glad we went!\\n\\nOur party of 4 shared the beet plate noted above and the mussels (in a light red curry sauce). Both great.  Two of us got the sea scallop dish that was on special that evening - we were expecting the typical seared scallop over a red pepper coulis (yawn), but instead got these amazing melt-in-your-mouth raw scallops served over something that tasted like a mixture of red pepper soup and gazpacho, with some shavings of grapefruit granita over the top and some crispy something that added texture. Light, full of flavor, and cold... perfect for a summer evening. We also ordered the Chinese broccoli side in a miso sauce.  I'm seriously going to figure out how to make that one at home; it could have been my dinner. My other two friends got the fried chicken over a deconstructed potato salad with kimchi, and the quail special. Both were fabulous. Two of us got dessert. I got the rose sorbet over a cucumber gelee with a splash of cream. Oh.My.God. Who knew you could pack so much flavor into such a small dish?! The other dessert was a deconstructed birch beer float. Can't even explain it. So much happening in one small dish. But birch beer float, it definitely was.\\n\\nThe service was great and the servers themselves all friendly. We liked the vibe. The layout of the restaurant is L-shaped and wherever you are sitting, you only see about 1/3 of the restaurant. I appreciated that; gives it a more intimate feel and probably cuts down on the noise a bit. One note about the noise: If you are going with anyone who has difficulty hearing, plan to sit outside.

There's a few small tables in the front with a small bar. I wasn't quite certain whether you sit down or go to the bar.....\\n\\nAs it turns out, you go to the bar first and place your order. Once you place your order, a waiter will find you a seat (there's also an adjacent front room with larger tables) and bring it out to you. There's actually several other areas to Stubbs: an outdoor patio, a downstairs room with a stage (that was setting up for a wedding reception when I was there) as well as a room with pool tables. This seems like a nice venue to catch live music.\\n\\nBut I was here for lunch, so this is about the food. I wandered into Stubbs in search of brisket and left delighted. It's possible that I'm over-grading here; where I come from in Seattle brisket is usually confused with a McRib sandwich. Regardless, I found the brisket tasty. Stubbs is the smokey kind with a fairly mild spicy sauce. It was tender, easily fell off the bone and almost melted in your mouth.\\n\\nThe main meal also came with two sides. I had the mashed potatoes which were well seasoned and the sweet potato salad (one can never have too much starch). There's a decent choice of beers but I just went with the Austin Amber which was fine. \\n\\nAll in all, a pretty nice lunch time stop which is probably even better as a concert venue."},{"name":"Fuji At WoC","address":"1420 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite Fuji in the chain... the service is great, decor is fantastic and the Sushi is VERY fresh..

I have been to Dixie Stampede, Medieval Times, Sleuths Mystery Dinner Show, and more but I have to say that I was not treated rudely.  I went to this table and found out it was for NASE so I was directed to inside where a greeter asked if I was waiting for someone and that everyone was waiting in this room.  On the website they say there is complimentary appetizers were provided so this being my first time I was getting a plate with meatballs and some other items from a table in the room I was told to go. This heavy set woman from NASE came and asked if was with the company and I told her no she asked me to put the food down and that was for NASE only.  I do understand that but she could have had a better attitude.  Then on top of this a butch looking woman who is employed by the dinner theater was not the nicest when she walked me and my friend out.  We than went over to the ticket booth and got our tickets finally and then we get directed into another room where music and lights were and some people standing and sitting everywhere in this room.  finally after standing for a long time we seen people with trays of food appetizers that was included we got one piece a quesadilla I let that go then you get a cheesy pre show where with everyone standing up you can barely see. and than finally they get us into the theater to be seated for the show.  so everything starts and then they come ask if you want a soup or salad where the portions are very small and I think you need to eat at home before coming to this show,  the chicken was small pieces and the mashed potatoes, and green beans were a small amount too.  the food was really had a good flavor if you were lucky to get enough to eat. I thought the dinner was more the appetizers that you were promised from the pre show. the show was ok kinda loud, and blasting where you heard some things and some sounded muffled ..  If you never seen the show go when there is no special event going on the same time, and be aware you may not get filled, and I was very disapointed that only two cups of soda you go and not even filled to the top. and the desert was ok I just think they need to get more on the go one really like the other dinner shows that take more hospitality to another level.

(It just dawned on me that it would be awesome if you could buy a little side of marinara for that crust.)\\n\\nThe ingredients on my verdura pizza were fresh and plentiful - I especially enjoyed the really generous amount of fresh cherry tomatoes.  They don't skimp on cheese or toppings, and vegetarians and meat-eaters alike will be happy here!

It was a Thursday, and I got there about 11:40am. The line was over an hour long, and I was finally seated at about 12:45pm. I got moist brisket and pork ribs. I skipped the sides. \\n\\nThe brisket was very moist, and had a rather large fat-cap, larger than I expected. It was very tender, and had a pretty good bark on the outside. It was salted nicely, but it didn't have as much pepper as I expected/like. It still might be the best brisket in Austin currently.\\n\\nThe ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender. Whether that is good or not is up too you. I've had ribs over-cooked before that fell off the bone, but they weren't as moist and flavorful as these. The ribs had an outstanding flavor, and obviously they were super tender, since they can't even stay on the bone. For me, I liked them better than the brisket, but I liked them both very well.\\n\\nThe meat deserved a 5 star rating, but the line for a lunch break is horrible. I don't see an easy solution to the problem. His tables are pretty full the whole time, so if he serves faster, seating will not be available for everyone. It would take more SQ-FT to handle more tables, and therefore more customers, and often times making a move to larger/fancier digs will hurt places as much as it helps them.\\n\\nOverall, the place has some of the best BBQ going right now.

I generally try to avoid meat, only eating it on special occasions, and since I had a friend in town and I was at THE Ramen Tatsu-Ya, I decided to go ahead and go for the shoyu. I did. not. regret. it.\\n\\nI know that ramen is greasy and fatty, and I know it probably has roughly 8000 mg of sodium per bowl, but MAN was it worth it. I got the corn bomb to go with it, per recommendations in reviews I read and it definitely added even more richness to the soup. I gave my friend my giant hunk of pork belly, and found that I didn't miss it - the flavor it imparted onto the broth was more than enough for me. My favorite part, as always, were the noodles. They were delicious, cooked to perfection, and had that perfectly chewy but still firm consistency. As with most ramen places, you can order extra noodles either right at the start, or if you find  you have extra broth at the end. \\n\\nThis is definitely the best bowl of ramen I've had in a while, but it's hard for me to compare Tatsu-Ya to Michi, as I've only done veggie at Michi. While I really enjoyed the Tatsu-Ya experience, I know I'll never stray from my regular bowl of veg at Michi.\\n\\nAs I said, we went near lunch closing time (3pm) on a Saturday and had virtually no wait and got a seat easily. It is a small place, and I'm not sure I'd be willing to wait in the epic lines I've heard tell of. Not to say it's not worth it, but I rarely ever opt to wait in line for food. If you're like me, perhaps it's better to aim to visit this place during non-peak hours. \\n\\nThey have lots of unique drinks and candy and stuff for sale near the registers, even Tatsu-Ya swag, like t-shirts.

The batter was also pretty tasty though they could do with a bit less salt and pepper since you have the cheese going for you. \\n\\nI've also ordered the bacon egg and cheese from here which was pretty tasty and overall a well crafted and put together breakfast sandwich.

The brisket was especially delicious, but at a whopping $20/lb it was pretty expensive. I also tried the ribs, turkey, and sausage, but they weren't necessarily better than what you could find at other bbq places in Lockhart. Overall the place is great, and worth giving a try.

It was great to help me lose some of the body fat I was trying to get rid. \\n\\nThe tuna sushi is okay. Conventional tuna sushi, Nothing special.\\n\\nOverall, this is one of those sushi places that I would recommend people to go to because of the fact they do provide the right type of food needed to recover after a hard workout.

You expect me to finish an entire bowl of tasteless lard? You call this tonkotsu?\\n-Musashino? bleh. flabby tasteless pork, unevenly cooked noodles, and tasteless broth\\n-Kome? LOL\\n\\nI'm writing this just after going for my first time, but in my honest opinion Tatsuya is on par with the best ramen in America(Ippudo/Totto in NY, and Monta in Las Vegas).\\n\\nBefore arriving I was debating between the tonkotsu and miso ramen. I ended up ordering a salad, the original tonkotsu, with an extra egg, and something they call a \\"corn bomber\\" which is basically a nub of butter with corn in it.\\n\\n-Speed\\n\\nThe dishes come out amazingly fast. I would say it only took 10-15 minutes before our dishes started to come out.\\n\\n-Taste / mouth feel\\n\\nThe salad is a great mix of shredded carrot, dikon, and red cabbage with a nice vinaigrette. Perfect for getting your tastebuds going.\\n\\nThe ramen itself... hmm where do we start.\\n\\nThe first thing I check out is if the temperature of the dish is right. What do I mean by that? Well you know when you cook instant ramen at home.. and you eat it piping hot right off the stove and you end up burning your mouth? That's way too hot. Ramen should be of a comfortable warmth, but not hot. \\n\\n**Actually the real first thing is...\\n\\nIs your egg soft boiled and cold in the middle? If not, you're at the wrong place.**\\n\\nThere should be a distinct difference in between the temperature of the broth, the temperature of the noodles, the middle of the egg, and the butter if you have it in your ramen. In my limited experience, the noodles should be the most warm, with the broth relatively luke warm. Then the egg and the butter should be slightly cold, offering you a mix of temperatures when you eat it. Literally stick your tongue into the yolk of the egg after getting a portion of noodles/broth in your mouth... it's quite the experience. Also notice how the coolness of the butter(called bombs at this place) plays with the warmth of the broth, it's pretty good too.\\n\\nPork belly is so overdone now days. Every new place has some sort of new pork belly slider or what not. They think they can just broil it and throw it out and people will think it's delicious cause it's fat. Go to Musashino and try their tonkotsu ramen, it's disgusting how they throw 2 whopping pieces of  tasteless pork slab in your bowl. Or how bout Kome where it's so dry that you mistake the tonkotsu for turkey. Luckily Tatsuya's pork is delicious. The fat melts in your mouth with a particular tinge of saltiness and flavor in the back. Sort of like the fat from really good moist brisket.\\n\\nThe noodles should be slightly bouncy, and may require a pull upwards (raising your chopsticks above the bowl) which does a few things. It makes a perfect bite sized portion, makes the noodles of a comfortable temperature, and gets the noodles in perfect order to *slurp* up, which should be emphasized.\\n\\nAm I going overboard? No, since ramen is probably the greatest thing on Earth if done right. And these guys do a great job. Think of a bowl of ramen like any other dish in the world of gastronomy... there should be interesting things, interplay between flavors and temperatures... and most importantly - umami. You need to go \\"Ahh...\\" after you eat it.\\n\\n-One thing though.\\n\\nCashier girl? Great. Asian dude? Cool. Our server? REALLY BAD. He had no idea what was going on. I ordered a kae-dama, extra noodles and he put in a whole order for a tsukumen ramen. If they want to create a legitimate ramen experience, they need to foster an environment full of \\"Irahsai!!\\" and \\"SUMIMASEN KAE DAMA ONEGAISHIMASU.\\" You have to make us ABC teenyboppers feel uncomfortable, like we have something we need to learn about traditional culture when we go to your place.\\n\\nIn Texas we have a saying that goes \\"Well that's all we have here...\\" when it comes to a lot of Asian food. But this place isn't a compromise... it's really darn good. \\n\\nOn the way back the first thought in my head was, \\"When will I be hungry next? I want to try x, x, and x on their menu...\\" Also.. I just wanted to yell out my window at random people to tell them about this place. \\"HEY YOU LADY AT THE BUS STOP. WE FINALLY HAVE A RAMEN PLACE HERE IN AUSTIN!\\"\\n\\n//A lot of people have been complaining about the time. But keep in mind the wait for the other great Ramen places in America, no matter what city you're in (NY/SF...) will be just as long as Tatsuya's."},{"name":"Paul's Omelettery Restaurant","address":"2211 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We were going to hike up the Chief and on our way we realized that we hadn't eaten breakfast.

I love this place because the staff is very friendly, the tacos are great, and the best part is their choice of eggs and products! They use local, cage-free, grass fed, organic eggs from Vital Farms.

Not in the mood for a taco? Their migas royal plate is excellent, and their queso is awesome. It's unlike other quesos in town, so it's worth ordering just to try something different. *They give out too many chips though, and since I'm not a \\"stuff all the chips in my mouth before eating tacos\\" type of lady, I just ask for less chips when I'm placing my order.

They also had a white sauce but that isn't going anywhere near my ribs or my brisket.\\n\\nThe decor of this place has the garage, roadhouse vibe, which is OK. It was fun, but I like my rib shacks to be gritty! Also, the pace here was a bit fast. I like my rib shacks to be a bit slower and steady.  I realize turnover is key, but this place was humming like a well oiled machine - quite polished and refined for a rib house. But decor is secondary to the cause. And the ribs here are top notch.\\n\\nThis place gets 4 judo chops of smokey BBQ goodness.

She obliged but I thought it was odd nobody had come by the whole time. The food menu was also just slightly off in that everything sounded good but nothing great. I went for the burger of the month and my date got the steak frites. The burger was perfect, the fries great and I gobbled it all up. The steak was next level but it was the smallest serving of hangar steak I've ever seen! It was literally the size of a burger or filet but the thickness of a chicken cutlet. So needless to say my date was left dry hungry and overall disappointed to spend $26 on what seemed to be a light meal. The quality of the food was unbelievable and I would highly recommend the drinks. The desserts were also delicious!

I've never eaten a burrito here cause I couldn't for the life of me understand why someone would go to a Mexican sit down restaurant to eat what is basically American fast food. I also hope that this place survives it's location. The Our House crowd is still definitely frequenting the bar with all their sketchiness in tow so they're probably making a decent amount of money on booze but I'm afraid the lack of sophisticated palates in the area might do this place in.

I also overheard another server say to someone who had waited in line for some time that , \\"Well, it is Screen Door, after all!\\" Wow - hubris destroyed the Roman Empire - I suggest that the staff at Screen Door take a course in humility and customer service and get over their self-important selves.

I'll state up front the brisket was good and flavorful. It snapped apart the way it is supposed to (so I read). The more of it I ate, the drier I found it. I can only surmise that I should have ordered the fattier cut as it could have had more moisture. The brisket plate comes with 4 slices of brisket. I only ate two as it was just too dry.

I attempted the Fire Eater Challenge here on 3/6/12, merely wanting the thrill of taking down a previously unconquered spicy undertaking.\\n\\nEllis had mentioned a couple months back that he would revamp the menu with a spicy challenge and a large burger. He came through on both promises -- with a few other tasty morsels to boot.\\n\\nThe Fire Eater Challenge is $9.95 and involves taking down 12 wings, coated in his insane heat sauce, in 15 minutes or less. I had all smallish drumsticks on my attempt, making the challenge much easier. You're allowed about eight minutes for the wings to cool down, so you don't struggle with both temperature heat and spicy nukage. Winners get their picture on the business website -- on the Wall of Fire Eaters -- and a $5 coupon for your next meal.\\n\\nThe insane heat sauce has ghost peppers, capsaicin, and probably some other fiery goodies. Going into this latest visit, five people had attempted it and zero succeeded. Gee, those are great odds!\\n\\nHaving previously tried the \\"Bro, that's stupid hot\\" chicken burger (which also uses the insane heat sauce), I had an inkling of what type of heat to expect.\\n\\nEllis started the timer. Biting into the first wing, I could gauge right then that the challenge wouldn't be very difficult. When the heat didn't get overwhelming by the fourth and fifth wings, it was only a matter of time. The wings had a crunchy exterior from the frying process, yet the meat retained some juiciness. Honestly, the wings could have been pulled from the fryer some five minutes earlier. Not the best wings I've ever had, but I've had worse.\\n\\nLooking back, I coulda easily cleaned the wings up better, but Ellis counted it anyway. The official time was 2:51. Way to christen the Fire Eater Challenge, eh? Ellis admitted that he \\"held back\\" on this batch of insane heat sauce. Now he knows there are people out there that can take these volcanic gutbombs!\\n\\nOh! I forgot to sign the waiver before the challenge started! Oops. Didn't matter anyway.\\n\\nYes, I have it all on video. Ellis' commentary is amusing...\\n\\nAs a bonus to my small, stunned audience, I took a sampler cup of insane heat sauce and chugged it, cleaning the remnants with a spoon. Consuming it like applesauce! Yeah!\\n\\nOnly when I took the sauce straight did I discover its potential power. Over the next few minutes, my throat burned and my stomach threatened mutiny. As time passed, the irritability subsided, with no horrid aftereffects. (I was fine that night and the next morning)\\n\\nI challenged Ellis to make the sauce hotter, one of massive spicochistic proportions. You know, he should name a sauce after me. I think \\"spicochist\\" has that appropriate evil ring to it. For the record, I had previously challenged another chef to up the heat twice for his spicy sauce, so there's precedent here. You may thank me or curse at me later.\\n\\nSo basically, the wing frying was merely OK. The sauce was enjoyable.\\n__________________\\n\\nEllis has a seriously huge menu. For a \\"normal\\" meal, I'd consider such items like his stuffed wings (he has four types) or his Wednesday chicken and waffles special. Fridays and Saturdays feature pork spare ribs.\\n\\nAre you one for quantity? The \\"B.F.D. Burger\\" is a four-pound mass of humanity. It's normally $20, but $15 as a Tuesday special. I've seen a photo, and the bun appears thicker than the meat patties. Damn.\\n\\nOne of the most popular burgers is the \\"420friendsonline Burger\\" ($8). bacon, two beef patties, one egg, mild poblano remoulade, Tillamook cheddar, sweet pickled red onions, lettuce, and fried pickles between...two grilled cheese sandwiches!\\n\\nEllis also pitched the Rick Bear Burger ($10): two 7 oz. patties, one hot link, one egg, two slices of bacon, mild chipotle mayo, American and provolone cheese, sweet grilled onions, lettuce, and fried pickles between...wait for it...two grilled cheese sandwiches! I think there's a recurring theme here with the grilled cheese sandwich.\\n\\nHow the hell can I forget dessert? Deep-fried oreos and Twinkies. A Cherry Bomb (\\"spicy\\") milkshake. Even a bacon caramel milkshake. WTF. This is torturous food porn material. And to think, I write this stuff all the time. Argh.\\n__________________\\n\\nHead to Grass Roots Cafe to take the Fire Eater Challenge, destroy a huge burger, or get sinful with some other awesome dishes. \\n\\nI'll return in the future to redeem my $5 coupon and get a \\"normal\\" meal here. And judged by the great pictures people have uploaded here, I've got a lot of thinking to do...."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"We ordered the fried green tomatoes with goat cheese, chicken liver, northern georgia trout, booyabase!, crab cake hash, pecan pie, and white chocolate cheesecake bread pudding with blueberry ganache and it was all incredible.

I only ate the tomatoes and top lettuce leaves as they were the only items in the salad not totally wilted from the balsamic vinegar bath.  When I mentioned to our overly friendly waiter that the salad had simply too much dressing (I usually ask for the dressing on the side but had forgotten to ask this time, stupid me) he said \\"there is a new boy doing the salads.

The food and service were both pretty good (3-4 stars), but the atmosphere was way too obnoxious for me (1-2 stars).  The music was blasting like a dance club at 7:30pm on a Wednesday night and the dim lighting made me feel like I was in a cheesy Vegas or Miami sushi joint.  It just felt so not Austin and so not sushi-driven.  It was like pretending to be classy and modern, but trying way too hard.  This was a chilly night, so the outdoor patio was not an option (wonder if they pipe the obnoxious stuff out there too?). \\nOn the up side, I liked most of the food, and the value was above average, especially for downtown.  They have a good deal all night on Wednesdays where you can pick 4 items from a select menu for $25.  We did that and added some nigiri and and appetizer.  I liked the Zonie roll and the Crispy Spicy Salmon (not sushi more of an appetizer), and I'd order both again.  The other two, the crab Rangoon-ish starter and the calamari strip starter were ok, but nothing special.  The sake nigiri itself was good, nice portion size and fish tasted fresh.  The sesame teriyaki chicken wing appetizer was fine, but not very flavorful.  \\nThe wait staff and manager were very attentive to us and really tried to ensure we had a good experience despite a few food delays, so I give them props for that. \\nI am not dying to return, but I am also not sad this place is here.  With some tweaking of the branding/atmosphere, this place could really shine (unless that is just the signature of the chain itself, in which case, I guess it's not a chain for me)."},{"name":"Mi Tradicion","address":"801 E William Cannon Dr, Ste 125","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The sweetness of the beard will hit ur taste buds when you walk in.

Chorizo is one of my favorite dishes and their house take is nothing short of disgusting. It tastes exactly like bad skyline chili, something I had confirmed by several friends. It was a soupy brown mix that hits you in the mouth with sweetness and cinnamon. I know I'm dwelling but it really is that bad, I paid for two and stopped after two bites and just went home hungry.

(SIDE NOTE: You should always order corn tortillas, people. Flour tortillas are inauthentic, unappetizing and unhealthy. A lot of authentic taco places won't even give you flour as a choice, which is good. End of lecture.) The Otto was the clear winner, a symphony of complementary flavors and textures: unctuous refried black beans with crispy, smoky bacon, fresh avocado slices and shredded jack cheese. The El Popeye (with eggs, spinach and queso fresco) paled in comparison to the giant flavor-punch of The Otto, but it was not bad by any means. Just more subtle. The house-made salsas and hot sauces were delicious. I especially liked the salsa verde and the yellow-green hot sauce.

When I tasted the ice cream flavors (I sampled Vanilla Bean and Chocolate Caramel Cashew) I found them way too sweet for my palate, and far too sweet for what I typically associate with high quality ice cream. For me, ice cream has to have the right balance of richness and sweetness.  The two flavors I tried were sickeningly sweet, with a sugar content that I tend to associate with low quality store bought brands.  Thinking that maybe my taste was a little bit off since I had not had dessert in a while, I went ahead and ordered the Rocky Road Cookie with 1/2 vanilla bean and 1/2 chocolate caramel cashew.  \\n\\nThe cookie was actually surprisingly good.  It had the right amount of sturdiness for an ice cream sandwich (not too crunchy or hard, but not too soft and doughy).  The ice cream however, overpowered the cookie, was just way too sweet and sadly tasted beneath the quality of the cookie.  I forced myself to finish it. Honestly, the sandwich as a whole  reminded me of something store bought or something you'd have at a kid's birthday party, sugar substituting for flavor.  I do not know if other flavors were less sweet but I found the otherwise richness of the cookie unrecognizable due to the overwhelming sweetness of the ice cream.  \\n\\nI will try Moojo again because I love the homemade ice cream sandwich craze.  Perhaps I need to pick a different combination of flavors, or something was just off about my tastebuds today.  However, if I had one suggestion to the owners I would rethink the sourcing of the ice cream. Given the cookie, the ice cream should be richer and more subtle in flavor to have the right amount of balance to the ice cream sandwich."},{"name":"Milestone 229","address":"229 Civic Center Dr","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Had Christmas party there!

While the restaurant is fairly small and you'll probably be waiting at least 30 minutes in a line that goes out the door, it is absolutely worth your time. After you order, a steaming bowl of ramen is brought out within minutes with the ingredients neatly arranged on the surface. The egg and pork are cooked to perfection. If you thought you were getting something akin to Top Ramen, then you have been woefully misinformed. What follows is the consumption of an ungodly high percent of your recommended sodium intake for several days. At the risk of inducing an acute hypertensive crisis, you'll probably ravenously consume the entire dish: broth, noodles, pork, and egg; and then frantically start chugging water. But it was totally worth it because it was fantastic. \\n\\nThe assigned seating can be a little weird if you are forced opposite a completely random group of people.

I hope that somebody screwed up and that Stubbs doesn't normally taste like that because it doesn't even come close to the experience I had at the Salt Lick."},{"name":"Clover Food Lab","address":"5 Cambridge Ctr","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I am mixed on how to review this.  The food is really, really good.  The atmosphere is quite good.  However, the business model where each individual food item comes out separately and no one is helping expedite is a really, really, really poor model.\\n\\nWhat happens is--you order 3 items and each item comes out 10-30 minutes later.  Even if it is something simple like tomato cucumber salad which should only take scooping.  All the meals are so similar it is perplexing at why this assembly is so difficult to do.  The fact that each line cook assembles and hands it directly to the person also invariably slows down everything.  \\n\\nAs I said, the food is quite taste-y, but it it is irritating that this is so poorly run.

Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"No Mas! is great for special occasions, a girls-night-out, or if you're craving hot chips with tons of queso. It's not great if you're looking for a casual dinner, cheap mexican food, or an intimate atmosphere. \\n\\nThis restaurant dabbles in the realm of fine-dining mexican. My dish, the Camar√≥nes Alambres, surprised me with complex flavors. It was 6 shrimp on sugar-cane skewers; I loved the mixed taste of the sugar and the smokey grill. I really enjoyed the accompanying sides of plaintains and a corn cake of forms. The dish tasted like mexican food, but I didn't have the stomach-ache side effects that typical mexican fare will bring.\\n\\nThe prices can give you some sticker shock. My delicious and gorgeous-looking entree made my wallet $18 lighter. Our order of queso set us back $7 - although I have to point out that the cheesy white stuff arrived in a humongous bowl instead of a tiny cup like most restaurants give you. The margaritas we had- I think the No Mas! Margarita- seemed reasonable at $8 a drink, mostly because I found them to be quite strong. One and a half of those and I was b-u-z-z-e-d. \\n\\nOur service was kind of odd. We had two servers throughout the night and we really didn't understand why that was necessary for a table of 2. The server that first came to our table informed us that there would be a second one, but did not indicate why (is one server still in training?). I gathered that maybe since it was so dead- it was a Monday- that servers were actually sharing tables to split the tips. It made for a really awkward meal. \\n\\nWe also felt like the food came out way too quickly. Minutes after our queso arrived, the entrees arrived. I felt like the servers should have had the foresight to wait on entering in the entrees for 20-30 minutes if they know we're the only ones ordering food at the moment. Had they done that, we probably would have been inclined to order another round of margaritas.\\n\\nThe place was empty on Monday night, and my friend and I actually really enjoyed the very light buzz of the music (not too cheesy), other patrons, and TVs on near the bar. But I've been here before on the weekends, and it is CRAZY with every table full and margarita pitchers abundant- it's certain that you'll have to deal with 2-3 drunk tables, hopefully none nearby. So if you're not ready to scream your funny story to your tablemates, I'd avoid No Mas! on Friday or Saturday.\\n\\nOverall I really like No Mas Cantina. Their food is generally on-point and ambiance during the week is perfect. But it costs a few more pretty pennies than I'm willing to spend on a regular basis; our table for two ran up a bill of $75 (!). I would love to see them have more specials, happy hours, etc."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I don't understand the low reviews?

It is only a few minutes from our house, so we were really hoping it would be good.  We were NOT DISAPPOINTED!  We went at 10:15a on a Saturday.  Most dim sum places that are good would be getting busy by that time.  Wong's King was not very busy, so we got a table right away.  The decor is very nice, almost too nice for a Chinese/dim sum place, but very pleasing to the eye and very clean appearance as well.  The staff were all friendly (not always the case in dim sum places), abundant in number, and quick to fill requests for extra items like mustard or a fork for my MIL.  My family is Chinese and so we go out to eat dim sum at least 6 times a year and the best we've had in the NW was probably at Top Gun in Bellevue, followed by Wong's King on 82nd.  We've also eaten lots of dim sum in Hawaii and Canada.  So we have many places to compare.  At Wong's King West we ate a variety of items and they were all good.  The standouts were the pork shrimp shiu mai, fried shrimp balls, char siu bau (steamed and baked), and seaweed seafood roll.  The sticky rice was tasty, but fell apart more than most we've had.  There were not very many carts going around, but they had an adequate amount of food to choose from and all tasted hot and fresh.  The place was not very busy, so probably would not support multiple carts going around at that time.  You can order additional items from the menu and they had a very nice labeled menu with items, pictures, and prices for their dim sum.  I've never seen that anywhere else, so that is a nice option.  We did not order from the menu though as we were satisfied with what we got off the carts.  Some reviewers complained about paying for tea, I agree that is odd for an asian restaurant.  The menu does list tea as a $1.00 charge, but we were not charged for it on our bill and we got to pick what kind of tea we wanted which is also not common.  They also refilled our teapot at least once.  Overall price seems comparable or maybe a little less than what we usually pay for dim sum in Seattle (might be the difference of 10% tax though!).  We paid $37 for \\"2 small, 4 medium, and 4 large\\" plates which fed 3 women and 1 man.  We all felt full by the end of our meal.  Service was excellent with lots of staff to fill water and clear the table.  The carts could have come around a little more often, but the manager checked on us twice and happily addressed any questions or concerns we brought up to him immediately.  I hope more people will check this place out and start dining there more often because I'm afraid they won't be able to stay open if they do not get busier soon.

We went back last night and had a horrible experience. Our waiter spoke very limited English and when I asked him about ingredients due to a food allergy in one of my nephews he said \\"it is fine\\". When I clarified it was a food allergy I was asking about he said \\"it is ok if he shares with his brothers, we understand\\" so at that point I realized there was no way my nephew could eat anything because there was no ability to communicate about food allergies. We ordered the burrata and prosciutto appetizer and caesar salad to start and both were very good. We then ordered the chicken milanese and three pizzas (prosciutto crudo and two margheritas). When the pizzas arrived all three were wrong. One was the prosciutto and fungi and two were marinara pizzas (no cheese). When we ordered he seemed to be having trouble understanding my kids so I repeated two pizzas with just marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese. The chicken milanese was a large portion and pounded nice and thin but tasted a bit fried. Ok but not great. When the pizza with mushrooms was put down I said this isn't what we ordered. He started arguing with us and when we didn't back down he actually said \\"whatever\\" and walked away. I was speechless. At that point I didn't bother to complain about the kids cheese-less pizzas and told them to eat them. Eventually he took the prosciutto/mushroom pizza away with a small apology and brought the ordered pizza. After that he refused to look at us and we had to ask another member of the wait staff to bring crushed red pepper for my son. Incredibly disappointing as I had planned to have my mothers 80th birthday party there in March because of the great experience we had the first time.

The winner though was the 'rum' baked beans which really was unique in taste and accompanied the ribs rather magnificently (pause review writing to deal with watering mouth). Both were served with slices of white bread. I've been back a few more times since and have tried the mac and cheese and the 'slaw - both good, but not outstanding. The sweet tea (and I love my sweet tea) during all my trips was for lack of a better adjective, insipid. It lacked the zip and freshness that memorable sweet teas possess.

The chicken is seasoned so perfectly, and the skin is crisp, thick, and hot. The sweet potato waffle is a great complement to the chicken, and the syrup really ties it all together.\\n\\nFor vegetarians, get anything with the cheddar grits.

Very disappointed. The place itself is amazing... gorgeous view of the city, really neat. \\nI'm going to preface my next comment by saying that we'd had terrible weather leading up to our visit. Temps were over 100 that day and the previous weekend most of Columbus was without power for several days *with the exception of downtown*. So... we arrive and learn that the AC is only working at 50%. The inside of the restaurant is very small - tight. So it was very uncomfortable to eat there. \\nNow...the food... had the pretzels for an app - pretty good with course mustard seed butter. My hubby got the scallops - they were cooked ok but they were very small (quarter sized) and I got the margarita pizza which was horrible. The middle of the crust was totally undercooked so when i took a piece out, all the toppings slid off. Yuck. Crust was bland (add some sea salt, chef!!). Just plain boring... then we ordered the Chocolate Cake with \\"jug\\" of ice cold milk...the cake was amazing - but the 'jug' was a very small glass of ROOM TEMP milk. I get that it was hot in there, trust me, but why was my milk warm?? \\nService was fine - our bill was $99.00... (that included four drinks). \\nAnd .... the view of the park with the water fountain next door is really neat -- until you focus on all the random people in various stages of dress (or undress) running around in the water. Not very appetizing to watch 300 lb women running around in bikini's while you are trying to eat an expensive meal. I know that sounds mean...but it's true. \\nThere are too many other places in town that serve much better food for better prices. Won't be back unless it's just for a drink on the patio.

It's gone down hill. The last time we dined here was probably over a year ago. I recall it was pretty decent back then, but it was much different today. Even though it was not overly crowded on Saturday morning, our service was bad and attention was minimal. The food was not very good either. I ordered two eggs scrambled with a side of sausage, and a short stack of pancakes. The scrambled eggs were plated as one solid piece of yellow matter shaped like a sardine can. It looked like playdough, not eggs. The sausage was under cooked, pink in the middle. My dining companion received toast with his order, but mine was forgotten until I caught the waitress and inquired. Both orders of toast were smashed thinner than a cracker with a blob of butter stamped in the middle. The inattentive waitress forgot my pancakes, and we never had our coffee refreshed. She brought the check before ever checking on us. The bill charged my meal as a \\"Breakfast Special\\" costing $5.00 more than what I received (I assume the special was a combination of what I ordered plus the pancakes that she never brought). I had the bill corrected as we were leaving. The only reason we went out for breakfast this morning was to save the trouble of preparing pancakes at home--and still no pancakes (boo!). The only bright spot was the very young woman at the register who made cheerful conversation about it being her birthday while we were waiting for our bill to be corrected.

The first time, I had the #2 (Tonkotsu Sho-Yu) with the egg on the side (gave it to my wife), with a corn bomb (corn, garlic, butter and spices). The pork belly is legit and the broth is rich. This isn't your college dorm ramen. The only analogy I have is likening eating TV dinners all your life and then going out to a steak house for the first time. The broth is miso-based and cooked with really rich meat-stock. It's basically the number 1 with the addition of a blend o special soy sauce, pork belly, marinated egg, bamboo, crushed peppercorns, scallions and toasted seaweed. To. Die. For. \\n\\nMy wife had the #1 (Tonkotsu Original) the first time, which has wood ear mushrooms in place of the bamboo and peppercorns. \\n\\nThis last time I had the #3 \\"Mi-So-Hot\\", which has ground pork, napa cabbage, bean sprouts, and marinated egg (on the side again).

I wished they would of had a veggie sushi roll (I'm allergic to seafood so I was bummed about missing out on sushi). Everything else that we had (asparagus, white rice, mashed potatoes, pork and black beans, bread, soup of the day-lobster bisque, corn on the cop, Greek pasta salad, salad) were all amazing. And their complementary apps of cheese bread, fried bananas, and yuca were to die for. The drinks were really strong so drink responsible! ( we had the Bossa Nova and Samba Lagoon). The price was about what you would spend going out to a average steak house so save your appetite and treat yourself to this amazing adventure. Pace yourself and take little sampling from the buffet part and don't be afraid to turn down one of the meat options- they will be back as long as you are there.

We were celebrating a friend's birthday and had a 9pm reservation for 12 people.\\n\\nOur entire party had arrived by 9:00 but we had to wait until around 9:40 for our table. Once seated it took about 20 minutes and 3 waitresses to get a drink order and another 30 to have the drinks delivered. The rest of the evening was much the same for appetizers, dinner, and dessert. We did not get out of there until 12:30 - and believe me we left as soon as we were finished and paid. On top of timing, there were some mishaps with the order - one person in the party received the wrong meal, another did not get hers at all, and there was a problem with the bill when it arrived although by this time I was so tired I decided to stay out of the matter.\\n\\nOn a much brighter note:\\nThe food and drinks were delicious.

First thing you notice is the atmosphere and decor - comfortable, homey, welcoming and pleasing.  The fireplace in the back makes you feel like you're in a ski lodge, or maybe your grandparents' living room.  It's a warm feeling, and not just from the fire.  The walls are decorated with very cool paintings, all available for purchase, from local artists.  It's just got a great feel to it. \\n\\nWe were seated right away, and perused the bill of fare.  As soon as you look at the menu, you know you're in for something different.  They have a great selection of vegetarian and seafood-only dishes, and an equally diverse selection of things for us carnosaurs.  \\n\\nThe beer and wine selection is also fantastic - beers especially are plentiful, fresh and many very local - I had a Cambridge Brewing Company pumpkin ale, for I am powerless to resist anything pumpkin, and lo, it was good.  They have a nice Cotes-du-Rhone by the glass as well, and we're both feeling pretty happy at this point\\n\\nWe ordered buffalo tofu as an appetizer/experiment, and I had to try the Colombian Chicken Stew, since it's billed as the Chef's grandmother's recipe, while Steph went for the vegetarian burrito.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, our entrees arrived with no trace of the wild soy app we ordered, which brought frowny-face, but it was quickly dispelled when we spoke to the server, who immediately apologized, and told us that if we still wanted it, it would be removed from the bill.  What the hey, I still want to see deep-fried tofu in buffalo sauce.\\n\\nThe stew was very good.  Carrots, potatoes, rice, and whole pieces of chicken in a rich broth - super flavorful peasant food, just the thing for a raw, rainy November night by the fire. The bureet was huge, fulla veg and well-made, very satisfying, according to Steph. \\n\\nThe value here cannot be beat, either. The price points, for the quality of food they are serving, are amazing - you literally cannot do better, anywhere. \\n\\n***PREACHY FOOD ALERT***\\nOther than the app glitch, the only other minor point is that they advertise on their burger section \\"100% Natural Hamilton Beef\\".  When I asked what that meant, the server gave me a blank look.  I asked \\"are we talking free range, hormone-free, grass-fed, no antibiotics?\\" (\\"100% Natural\\" can be a very misleading term.)\\n\\nShe returned and informed me that their beef is hormone-free, and free range, but not grass fed.  Which means they source their beef from feedlot cattle farms which cram their cows full of surplus corn, allow them to walk a minimal amount, but do not pasture them and still have to pump them full of antibiotics. Le sigh. \\n\\nOn the whole, I count this restaurant as a top-ten go-to spot in Boston, and would return here any time for a meal, a drink, a snack, or a game.  It's that good."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Another awesome tasting BBQ lunch at Stubb's!

Immediately, it came to my attention that they were short staffed.\\n\\n I was deeply disappointed at their buffet line. It was an isolated and secluded area which had a limited amount of food.

Obviously, part of the experience to Gino's is that wait, so do not go expecting some quick carbs to sop up your 6th Street mistakes. The service there has been pretty spotty there each time I've gone, whether that is due to understaffing or sheer exhaustion on their part having to explain to hangry people their pizza *still* isn't ready.

The cuts of pork were the best thing there -- tender, just the right amount of fat, and so flavorful -- but it was just one small slice.  The noodles, on the other hand, tasted fine.  Just fine.  They are thinner than ramen at other places, and they almost seemed undercooked.  I prefer thicker noodles with a slight chewiness, so the texture here was so-so.  But everything else in the ramen, like the extra brussel sprouts or miso shoyu broth, really do taste good and rich.\\n\\nUnfortunately the wait kills the rating from 4 stars down to 3 stars.

Worst Applebee's I have ever been to. After moving to Atlanta we have given this Applebees quite a few chances but it never fails to disappoint. First few times the servers were always forgetting items or adding extra food items onto our bill which we would have to get removed. This last time we had a very late dinner after a night at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre and ordered only half price apps. Because we ordered 9 apps amongst 3 people instead of food we were charged for 5 sodas despite only 2 of us getting drinks. One of the people in our party had a water and at no point did the waiter say to us \\"hey you know you're going to be charged for 5 sodas you may as well have one\\". Instead we were embarrassed by having them run after us while walking out the door to make us come back and pay for the extra drinks. Apparently ever set of 2 appetizers means you need to pay for a new soda, which is seemingly different than the last 3000 times I have had half price apps at other Applebees.

And yes, this review is pretty long but it needs to be......A couple weeks ago, the man & I had an early dinner here on a very quiet Sunday.  I was brought up by a northern Italian mom & a Sicilian dad & this food was a big WOW!!!!  I had the rigatoni in a classic bolognese ( yes, sometimes I just NEED a dish of macaroni) he had the chicken milanese.... \\n\\nFood: his 5. Mine 4 only because it was a little too salty, but I would definitely order this again.  He started with the fried calamari along with a side of plain \\"gravy\\" which was NOT  salty..... I do not like calamari, but I ate the rest of his gravy with a spoon.... Classy, I know, but it was that good !!!  I had the white bean soup which was so good I burned my mouth on it because I couldn't wait for it to cool down...For dessert we split the tiramisu. I should have gotten another to go.... It was wicked good.\\n\\nService: 5. Crystal was running the bar (beer & wine only - boo!!!) & serving the other 2 or 3 tables as well. She was attentive, not overbearing and we chatted about the restaurant, the owners, the fresh ingredients they use & the menu which, by the way, is not extensive, but having said that, IMHO it is a sign of dishes that are pretty much guaranteed to be very well prepared and special. I dislike chain restaurants and pretty much any restaurant with a million things to choose from. Marco's menu = quality.  I know from experience that an italian menu which is well thought out like this one also indicates that the chef will be able to prepare a dish by request that is not listed providing that request is not completely off the wall..... Crystal mentioned this in conversation as well.  She really was a nice, friendly part of their team :)\\n\\nAmbience: the lighting was dim but not dark, which I appreciate.  Design was clean lines, casual yet stylish.  It is not a huge place, but the bar will seat appx 10 which is where we prefer to eat. 2 flat sceen tv's which DID NOT detract from the interior design.  Low music played on at just the right volume. The bathroom -single- was clean. As a matter of fact, the entire place was spotless and boasted an open kitchen!! Love that!! \\n\\nPrice: maybe slightly pricey for some I guess,  & some will also bitch that the location & price don't match up, but what the hell difference does that make when you enjoy your meal???? I don't mind paying \\"Boston prices\\" for a Rte. 1 establishment as long as I like the food, which I did....Very much.....plus I don't have to drive into the north end & get annoyed by the crappy parking situation..... So yes, I will happily pay up!\\n\\nAnyway, congratulations and good luck in your journey....... I intend on being a regular here so please Marco's, stay in business. Please succeed........"},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I went to this location on friday. I went to the host stand with my friend.

Don't get me wrong the drinks are wild and crazy and the food is delicious, but their birthday celebrations are something I've never seen before. \\n\\nI would 100% recommend to reserve a table if you're going in the evening. It was packed when I went. Getting back to the atmosphere, basically whenever it's your birthday they'll come out with a humongous dessert platter with a firecracker. They turn on a unique song for everyone (Gucci Mane, Britney Spears you name it). All the waiters and waitresses come around  and start dancing and it's just one big party for 30 seconds. The entire restaurant gets into it too! It wasn't my birthday, but I'll definitely be going back with a big group! They're very accommodating for big or small groups FYI.\\n\\nNow for the drinks! My boyfriend and I shared a Mai Tai goblet and it was SO good. I would say it at least had 4-5 drinks in it. The goblets and desserts are what they're known for. Anyways the waiter will bring over the goblet and pour the drink into it - this is the cool part. There's dry ice so the drink starts smoking. We ended up getting another because they were just that good. The goblets will definitely cost you. $32 bucks a pop. But to be honest, go big or go home because you're not going to be going there all the time. \\n\\n\\nAs for the food I had a turkey burger, and my boyfriend had the chicken wings with a piece of their red velvet cake.

Nice concept and it made me think of some fun ideas for my next batch of burgers on the bbq at home.

We were there an hour before close so it probably had been but it was still a disappointment.  I tried one of their whiskey sours and it was a little too dressed up for a burger bar.  I also agree with other yelpers that a few more options on the menu would be nice, even if it was just more toppings for the burger or add a chicken or turkey burger that doesn't have the bacon in it (see remarks above).  \\n\\nOverall, I will probably go back because my husband really enjoyed his burger but I may not.

Many *good* ramen places. After moving to Austin a few years ago, one of my few regrets was that  Austin was lacking a quality ramen restaurant since ramen is one of my favorite comfort foods. But there is some hope--  Ramen Tatsu-ya may help fill in the void that Shinsengumi and Daikokuya left when I moved to central Texas.\\n\\nMy husband and I went for the grand opening and arrived a little after 6pm. Already there was a line out the door that stretched the side of the building. After about a 40 minute wait (and if you've been to Shinsengumi, you know that's not a bad wait for some quality ramen) we finally got to the front of the line. You order at the counter, get a number, and the ramen and appetizers are brought out to you.\\n\\nWe were fortunate enough to be seated at the counter, so ordering more beer was not a problem for us. But most of the seating is communal-table style, and there aren't many people around who can help you if you want more water or another drink.  But the ramen itself was tasty. I ordered extra garlic, which you press into your bowl yourself, and I'm glad I did because I think the broth may have been a little on the bland side without it (I ordered the original tonkotsu broth). The noodles, on the other hand were excellent. We were seated next to the restaurant's interior designer, and learned that the chefs worked with a noodle distributor in Los Angeles to develop the perfect ramen noodle for their recipe.  Can't get noodles like this anywhere else, folks. And the pork belly char siu inside the soup was excellent.\\n\\nCheck out the bathrooms while you're there. The designer was inspired by some Austin street art he saw while taking a smoke break, and was able to track down the original artist. He was able to get some of the artists from the collective Blue Dozen to paint murals in the bathroom, using red, black, and white paint. They are amazing.\\n\\nMinus one star for the AC (it's not broken, but can't quite handle the number of burners they have going in the kitchen). They swear they're going to get it replaced in a few months. Also, it would be nice if they had someone seating people after they ordered at the counter, and someone who would come by to refill drinks/allow you to order more drinks or dessert. But Ramen Tatsu-ya definitely satisfies. BTW, they don't do take-out and don't have anything with which to pack up leftovers. But you can order extra noodles for $1.50 if you have leftover broth, so you won't leave hungry."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"April 19, 2013\\n\\nBBQ Symposium\\n\\n My cell phone rang inconveniently as I neared Franklin's, I tried to answer unsuccessfully using the Bluetooth link. I knew it was Raybourn who I was meeting along with Paul to begin the BBQ quest. I moved my eyes towards the beginning line at Franklin's BBQ unable to miss my long time (since third grade) buddy and his good friend Paul who were waiting underneath the ominous, squally Austin firmament. Honking I alerted them that I too was early.\\n Several weeks earlier during a visit with Ann to Dallas, Raybourn had dragged out the article from the Dallas Morning News of March 10th, \\"Texas BBQ Posse rounds up its favorites\\". \\"Cress, put together a trip for us to check out these places\\". I did. Paul, whom I had met and fished the Snake River with this year, joined along with Aspen dog.\\n\\nThe plan was simple. Start with the Posse's #1 pick, Franklin's Austin, adjourn to the River House at Wimberley to eat, unpack, relax then on to Lockhart. #4 Kruez Market was on the Posse list, we could not pass up the equally renowned, and legendary just for the length of being in business, Blacks and Smitty's Market. Return to the River House and join Ann for a symposium on the day's outcome. Day two would start fly fishing the Blanco River, then driving the hour north to Opie's in Spicewood for early dinner. Opie's is a personal favorite of many Austinites in the know, including me. Thursday would finish with a trip to the Posse's #5, Louis Mueller in Taylor, thirty minutes north of Austin.\\n\\nIt was 10:10 AM when I patted Aspen and began assuring my compadres that all was in order. It was indeed. I had emailed Franklins several days earlier, after several personal and informative exchanges, deciding on 2.5 lbs. of brisket and equal weight of pork ribs- the minimum take out. Following another early orderer in through a side door 20 feet from where the line, now 50 or more, waited at the main entrance, we could not have been treated better. As a take out, and getting our food 45 minutes before opening, we could not eat inside as we knew, but we were offered free soda's, sides of which we ordered two and two different sauces in cup size to go containers. Then the guy in charge, maybe even Franklin, sealed the deal. Three fifty cent size chunks of brisket bark were placed on napkins for us. Raybourn and I are 67, Paul slightly older, we eat, especially meat. At 6'1\\" and 195 pounds, I am several inches, and 50 pounds or more lighter than each of my buddies. Paul played defensive end for the Minnesota Vikings before becoming a surgeon, Raybourn retired as a senior captain for American Airlines. We are no rookies as to food, pleasure, and BBQ. The samples acclaimed as the single best bite of BBQ we recall. I gathered all the food into my car for the trip to Wimberley. Ahh the smells!!\\n\\nSitting down to a lunch of Franklin's overlooking the Blanco River in Wimberley was as hoped. The spicier, astringent sauce was hands down the unanimous choice of the two. I experienced a first with the brisket. The butcher paper when unwrapped still kept warmth in the meat, as well as the grease. Large rows of fat were part of the brisket. Using my fingers, I peeled out a chunk of meat. It had no sauce, and that's how I ate it. This heresy was delivered to Raybourn, \\"Now I know why some say good brisket doesn't need sauce.\\" We did save some for Ann. Off to Lockhart.\\n\\nThe Greek Symposium was a key Hellenic institution, a gathering of persons of good family to discuss anything from philosophy to tawdriness, accompanied by wine and food. Our BBQ symposium began at the River House when Ann joined us at cocktail hour for Margaritas. Raybourn, profoundly knowledgeable of BBQ, suggested at the appropriate time that all the various meats be wrapped in tin foil and allowed to refresh in a pre-heated oven for a half hour. I promised not to disclose the temperature. \\nWe were in accord that Franklin's earned the number 1 rating as the best BBQ in Texas, QED the World. Black's beef rib was an astonishing surprise hit. Kreuz sausage was as rated, #1. Every place we ordered brisket was special, led by Franklins and Mueller. Franklins' spicy and astringent sauce was top rated."},{"name":"U & Me Restaurant","address":"4646 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"My first time here and it was great.

Paid parking is conveniently located across the street, so you won't have to worry about scrambling around looking for a place to park. \\n\\nThe front of the establishment looks like it could have been an old vinyl records shop at one point back in the day, but the interior looks amazing and it gives you a nice cozy feeling. The hostess staff and server was very polite and accommodating. \\n\\nI know this is a staple dish for some, but I got the Fried Chicken and Waffles. It was SO delicious!! It comes with 2 breast piece portions and a whole belgium waffle cut into fours. Let me tell you. That chicken was some of the best fried chicken I've ever tasted. The outside was crispy, the batter was well seasoned, and the meat was plump and juicy. It doesn't get any better than that. The waffles were crisp, warm, and when drizzled with that maple syrup they serve on the side, it will literally ignite your taste buds making you crave for more if you have a big appetite. \\n\\nBefore I got my main dish, I tried the crab bisque as an appetizer. Coming from Maryland, we know everything about crab inspired dishes and this place had some pretty good crab bisque. We're used to either a tomato based crab soup or a cream of crab soup which is a bit thicker in texture, but their bisque was right on point.

The burrito was tasty but a little dry so I asked for more sauce, which made it better, but essentially it was the only thing in the dish aside from a little cut corn. The soup was tasty but it was basically chicken rice soup with raw pico di gallo added.  So that was ok but nothing to scream about and neither one of us liked the fish taco because it tasted like frozen cod with that heavy fishy flavor that is not very pleasant.

The waitress's name was Amanda F. The food and margaritas were good. Everybody else in the restaurant were very kind and welcoming besides our waitress. When we sat down she asked us if we were getting food and we said just some appetizers and margaritas and she answered with \\"well don't unroll the silverware then because it's really hard to roll up\\" and walked away. The next time she came back she took our silverware away. Every time we ordered a new drink she seemed pissed off. There was one time when we were waiting to order another round and she took so long to come over that two people from our party went to the bar to order. When they told the bar that our waitress isn't coming over they just laughed like they expected it and said that they would have her bring the drinks over.

So, I took my mom here for her birthday dinner before the Lady Antebellum concert. It was quite crowded around the bar which is not separate from the tables, so it was extremely loud. We had to basically yell at each other from across the table in order to hear one another. That's fine, I get the vibe they're going for, so we went with it.  The tables aren't too squished together like you commonly see in smaller restaurants, so that was really great.  \\n\\nOur waiter was pretty good, he was attentive, but didn't offer the specials off the bat - we had to inquire about them, somewhat odd.

I ordered the cod bouillabaisse, which came with more than I had expected. The bouillabaisse was my favorite part, though it was extremely salty. I think I woofed down 4 glasses of water just while getting through the dish!  The cod was pretty good, but I didn't not like how the bread that was served in the bowl was smothered in some orange spread . It was overwhelming and I couldn't enjoy any other flavor besides whatever that spread was.

We were seated right away and greeted by our server to take our drink order. The prices were really high, especially since there are numerous burger places within the 1 mile area. Once we placed our order, things took a huge dive! It took about 20 minutes to receive our salads and soup, after the server told us twice it was \\"coming right out.\\" It was not until our salads came out that our server noticed our drinks were empty (they had been empty for probably 10 minutes). When it did come, I asked the server to bring an extra plate so i could split my salad (which we told her we were doing when we ordered) and she brought me back a soup bowl! She returned with a salad plate and we just started eating our salad when our meal came! We sent them back, and asked them to bring them when we had finished our salads/soup. When we notified the manager, she seemed apologetic and offered to take off \\"a portion\\" of our salads. When they brought back out our food, it was obvious that it had been just placed under a light because the food was cold and the burgers were all over cooked. My \\"medium rare\\" burger was easily medium well, my husband's medium was well-done. The meat was dry and had very little flavor. For $13, I would have expected a phenomenal burger! At one point, I felt like I was chewing on sand...you know that gritty feeling if you get sand in your mouth? After reading other reviews, I think it may have been that salt in the burger. The \\"goat cheese\\" that I paid an extra $1.50 for was chewy and had no taste...obviously this was not goat cheese! My kids ordered chicken fingers, which, for $8 per kid's meal, I would have expected more than 3 chicken strips per plate. When my 9 year old asked for honey mustard and ranch for her chicken fingers, the server informed me there would be a $0.75 upcharge for a second sauce! We had to ask the server to bring out condiments, and she returned with ketchup and mustard in plastic picnic bottle! I would think a burger joint would have stock bottles at least. The kids were suppose to receive a scoop of ice cream with their meals, but this was omitted completely. When the bill came, we saw that the manager had taken off $0.75 per $4.99 side salad! Wow!

Or maybe I spent a bit too long glancing at said videos.\\n\\nAs for my Fire Pork wrap? It was done well. A great balance of meat, rice and crisp veggies with a good sauce. Kimchi, red onions, pickled radish, lettuce and other goodies all wrapped up in a spinach tortilla and this was not small. It was in the range of a Chipotle sized burrito.

If you like more attention from your waiters and/or a quieter restaurant, then I suggest going early.  We also got the first cut of everything for the night, so super fresh!  There is a vegetarian option, at a lower price, so they do cater to different needs and preferences.  Find a favorite meat? Just ask for it, and they will bring it!  Just remember to go very hungry and ready to be stuffed after!

We tried 4 kinds (yellow with chocolate frosting; strawberry with strawberry frosting, chocolate with butter cream frosting, and red velvet). We liked the cream cheese frosting on the red velvet cupcake (very light, not too cream cheesy), and the yellow cake and butter cream frosting were decent, so we actually were just picking apart the good frostings and the yellow cake and trying to salvage the cupcakes that way. We still ended up throwing all but a few bites away. The chocolate/red velvet cakes were dry and had no flavor, the chocolate frosting tasted like it was from a can, and the strawberry cupcake just tasted like an average muffin. I really think anyone who makes or has eaten homemade cupcakes with homemade frosting will not like this place. Homemade cupcakes are not hard to make and taste so much better."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

We had our food delivered during lunch time. We ordered two combination plates and a vegetarian entree and a couple soups. We got some sweet n sour chicken, vegetarian egg roll, crab rangoon, meatless Hot and Sour Soup, steamed rice, fried rice, boneless pork, house wonton soup and string beans in garlic sauce. \\n\\nThe chicken was very very greasy. But such is always the way with sweet n sour chicken or chicken fingers. We always wrap them in paper towels and squeeze it off. More importantly, the chicken tasted fresh and there was a decent portion.\\n\\nThe vegetarian eggroll was also very greasy, again with the paper towels! The filling was a minced broccoli? cabbage? mushroom and carrot kinda squishy thing. I wasn't a huge fan of it, but it was edible and the eggroll wrapper was fairly light and crispy rather than lots of half raw layers as I frequently find on the east coast.\\n\\nThe crab rangoons were exceptionally greasy, and had no obvious signs of imitation or real crab. Just sweetened cream cheese. I'm unsure if I'd order these again. I'm a fan of the less fishy crab rangoons, but these were not well drained and that was really off putting.\\n\\nThe non-meat Hot and Sour Soup was the highlight of the meal. Lots of bamboo, tofu and an additional depth of flavor, sort of smokey. Very dark and soy saucy. (I've noticed some hot and sour soups in China town are much lighter and have some kind of white sweet stringy plant in them and those soups are much sweeter. I'd say this was NOT that kind, so if you prefer that kind you probably won't enjoy this soup. But if you are like me and prefer the more soury version  you'll be in bliss. It was truly the highlight of my meal)\\n\\nSteamed rice: totally average, maybe a bit dryer and bland than usual.\\n\\nFried rice: awful. Brown dry kernals of rice, strewn with slimey onions. Little flavor at all and was kinda greasy and dry at the same time. (For fried rice I LOVE Island Hopper on Mass Ave, random but--- the best)\\n\\nThe boneless pork had a lot of meat and fat as usual to boneless pork, but the meat tasted pretty fresh and there was a really generous portion in the combo.\\n\\nHouse wonton soup was huge, filled with seafood and veggies. Had a good flavor if you enjoy seafood. Unfortunately the guy who took our order had no idea what crispy soup noodles are. No clue if thats average or not.\\n\\nThe string beans in garlic sauce looked great when I first opened the box. However despite it being loaded with huge amounts of visible minced garlic it had little flavor. The sauce was deep brown and rich looking, but again no flavor. I'd ask for \\"light\\" or no oil added to this next time. And since it was supposed to be spicey but was instead incredibly mild--- I'd ask for it to be extra spicy. \\n\\nSo, was this all in all typical of chinese... and yet, for what it was, it was one of the better places I've sampled in Boston. Honestly that's more due to my quirky preferences. I'd be happier if they worked harder on more potent and rich flavors, but hey, it was still pretty yummy and it arrived absurdly fast. Also they have free cans of soda w/ orders over $15. They were out of Pepsi, and instead of saying they were out, and offering something else, they nicely gave us a 2L bottle of it instead.

Looked a few from the Atlanta Magazine, and picked Aria.  Let's just start with this:  I highly recommend this restaurant.\\n\\nTheir menu changes everyday, so the one of their website is a variation of what they usually have.  They also have a tasting menu.  Not knowing that they have a tasting menu, I went with a lot of questions on my mind since everything look good.  The price was also VERY reasonable.  For 6 courses, it was only $56 (give and take).  I also ordered the Foie Gras starter, and George, our server, was wonderful enough to suggest a good place to insert this plate into the meal order. Now on to the food.\\n\\nBefore even starting on the first course, the bread was great.  They don't provide butter, but that's because you don't need any.  It had a sprinkle of salt, and the bread was soft, moist and buttered (or at least it tasted like it).  \\n\\nFirst course was a Salmon Tartare.  It was delightful.  The sauce that came with it was citrusy and refreshing.  The toasted bread that came with it was alright, can do without.  I ended up using the soft bread to sop up the sauce, because it was so good.\\n\\nSecond course was the Pea Soup with a Goat Cheese Fritter.  Let just say this:  I've never had pea soup, especially after watching the Exorcist, and I hate Goat Cheese.  This was actually very good.  The Goat Cheese was not overwhelming like I'm used to, and it complemented the pea soup very well.  Still not a fan of pea soup, but this was a very good attempt at converting me.\\n\\nThird course was the Seared Scallop with arugula, pink grapefruit, avocado, radish and heart of palm.  This was AMAZING.  The scallops were cooked to perfection.  I'm not a fan of arugula, but the combination of all these ingredients cut the bitter and slight spiciness.  Also loved the different textures in this dish.  I would eat several plates of this.\\n\\nFourth course was the Foie Gras, which I added to the tasting menu.  This came with arugula and a light strawberry sauce with diced up strawberries.  If you like foie gras, you would LOVE this.  Again, the strawberry cuts the pungent taste of the arugula, but some may think the sauce is a little too sweet.  The three ingredients harmonize in your mouth.\\n\\nFifth course was the Gnocchi with lamb and mushroom ragout.  The gnocchi is made very well, and the sauce has a great bold flavor.  The lamb is not gamey at all, and this was a very solid dish.\\n\\nSixth Course was a Short Ribs and a Petite Filet Mignon with mushroom, carrots, brussels sprouts, and farro.  The farro was a tad harder than I had imagined but it was good.  The Filet Mignon was cooked perfectly (medium rare), but I thought it was a bit bland.  The Short Ribs on the other hand was absolutely marvelous.  It tore apart easily and was full of flavor.  If you are getting dinner a la carte and are stuck between the two, get the short ribs and skip the filet mignon.\\n\\nIf I were to order these 6 dishes with the best first, it would be a tie between the Scallop and Foie Gras, then the Gnocchi, follow VERY closely by the Short Ribs/Filet Mignon, Salmon Tartare and finally the Pea Soup.\\n\\nWe finished with the last dish, the Caramel Nut Cake.  The cake was scrumptious.  It was covered with a thick caramel sauce (almost molasses like) with lots of pecans topped with a spoon scoop of vanilla ice cream.  This was a very nice ending to a fantastic meal.\\n\\nThanks again George for being a great server!"},{"name":"DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana","address":"8000 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"A coworker introduced me to this place a couple of weeks ago when she picked up an order.

My friend stuck with a classic Indian dish, Chicken Tikka Masala. It wasn't bad, but seemed to lack some of the spice and flavor you expect from Indian food. A little too much cream and not enough tomato and spices for my taste, and like my lamb dish, the portion size seemed a little small. \\n\\nOverall a decent dining experience, but I've found that Indian food in Austin is continuously expanding and improving.

Until you try Puff the Magic Popper-bacon, jalapenos, and cheddar cream cheese.\\n\\nThe full menu is huge, and most dogs are $3.00 a pop. Same with the sides-really have to recommend the tater tots, really crispy-so you can put together a dog, a side, and a drink for under 10 bucks. The bar is well stocked, with some old favorites and some new twists. Desert is great too, as they have switched out funnel cakes for funnel cake fries. Easier to share.\\n\\nIf there is one complaint it is that it can get pretty packed at night, but isn't that the point of a great restaurant? Inexpensive, delicious, and fun to eat at."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Jake's was recommended by the hotel concierge, which I usually take with a grain of salt, but the advice was on point in this case. \\n\\nThe wine and beer list is extensive, and that's always a good starting point. I went with the Full Sail Amber, which is a great beer for shoving huge amounts of delicious seafood into your face. \\n\\nWe started with the calamari appetizer. I usually groan when someone at the table suggests calamari, because it's usually a frozen joke, but it was a good call in this case. The calamari was fresh, not overly breaded, and served with three homemade dipping sauces (horseradish remoulade, traditional cocktail sauce, and a rich sherry sauce...all delicious). \\n\\nMy next course was an oyster stew. Being a west coast transplant originally from the south, I am immediately skeptical about certain dishes that we have perfected on the east coast. Oyster stew is definitely one of those. Jake's did not disappoint. The stew was milky, not too rich, and featured fresh, plump oysters. I was impressed, and would consider the oyster stew for a meal in itself. \\n\\nMy main was the Dungeness crab tortellini. It came with a generous portion of Dungeness crab (my favorite crab by the way), piled high on the tortellini, but also mixed within the dish. It was tasty, but very rich. Maybe a little too rich, but that's probably what you should expect with crab, tortellini, and cheese in a cream sauce. I had to call mercy in the end because it was just too much. \\n\\nJake's has been around for a while, and has a great reputation in the Portland area (to the point that our Uber driver was excited that we were going there). Most locals have likely tried it (if not, shame on you), and visitors would do well to give Jake's a shot."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The man and I went here for lunch.

This is probably the best red curry I've had. I ordered the roasted duck red curry, kaul gai and stuffed chicken wings.\\nExtra hot on the curry means you actually get some spice to it. It was a creamy, sweet and tangy all together. The lychee, grapes and tomatoes add interesting textures and marry with the chili spices really nicely. I'm glad the spiciness only needed a bit more chili flakes and hot fish sauce. Other than that it was just perfect. It was hot enough to burn the others at the table!\\nThe kaul gai (wide noodles with shrimp and vegetables) was lightly seasoned with dried shrimp, pickled vegetables and a sweet fish sauce. The \\"jumbo\\" shrimp were chinese white shrimp, pretty tasteless and almost not worth ordering. I suggest the squid or the tofu, which probably taste a lot better with the noodles and sauce. The veggies were light and crunchy, oddly enough the cucumbers that were cooked in were good. I've never really thought that cucumbers were good in stir fry, but they were a nice fresh addition.\\nI've had better stuffed chicken wings. They are a lot of work to make and most restaurants won't make them because of that. They were cooked well, a nice golden brown and stuffed with the standard glass noodles, pork and vegetables. Just imagine a nice pot-sticker filling crammed into a deboned chicken wing and deep fried in butter-oil. I probably won't order this from here again, but it was tasty (I have to drive to Salem to get my favorites)... \\nAnyway, I think this is now my favorite Thai restaurant in Portland.

The quality of the food was comparable to Mayflower's, a popular dim sum restaurant chain in California.  The service was lacking a little, most likely due to the fact we were seated in the far corner, giving us a slight disadvantage in terms of exposure, so it took a while before the plates started to accumulate on our table.  Timing your visit will essentially influence two factors: the later you arrive, the less time you will have to wait to be seated, but the selection of food declines as well.  The decor fits your typical dim sum restaurant - a wide open space with large tables dispersed throughout.  The pricing is quite affordable ($20 for two).

With the help of good company and smartphones, 2 and a half hours went by in a flash and the doors finally opened. \\n\\nWe weren't playing games - we ordered everything and we ordered a lot of it ($110 for 3 people).\\n\\nPulled pork was great, but the brisket, ribs, and hot links were on another level. The simple seasoning let the meat and smoke shine, but what really took me by surprise was how moist and tender they all were. The links explode with juice upon first bite and the ribs are barely clinging to the bone. The brisket moves and feels different from any other piece of meat I've had. Every ounce of fat and collagen that could be rendered has been. It is a testament to their expert timing and temperature control. This is the reason to come to Franklin. \\n\\nThe meats are the stars of the show, but the experience is completed with a myriad of sauces to try, some great sides (get the potato salad), and all the white bread one could wish for.\\n\\nYes you have to wait.

Always wondered what the hoopla was about, but didn't believe it was worth the 4 hour wait outside in the cold. Probably still wouldn't do that as I'm almost 50 but it seems that's half the fun for the 19-30 yo crowd that brings their lawn chairs and beer or hot chocolate to socialize at 8am in line and take selfies while they wait. :) But last December I ordered a large amount by email 6 weeks before pickup for my sons UT graduation, and it was easy to walk past the line at 10am to pick up my food hot and fresh. Be forewarned, it isn't cheap even by my CA standards, but it is worth it. Tender juicy very flavorful brisket with a nice black char crust (hubby's favorite part) and the best BBQ sauce I've had. Barely sweet, tangy and lots of black pepper.  I think I detect Worcestershire in there too. And this week, I emailed a week in advance to pick up a sealed and chilled brisket to reheat myself while visiting my son, and again, pickup was easy, reheat was easy and it was just as good. Runs about $19/lb.  So I haven't stood in line for it, but that looks fun as long as it isn't rainy or cold (hey, I'm from southern CA) but well worth the money if you order 6 weeks in advance or two weeks to pick up a heat-your-own one. Now I just wish we had one in SoCal.  Would be so much easier to sit in line for 4 hours in a beach chair with an umbrella in our year-round 70 degree average with 50% humidity.

The bar area is small with only about five tables in addition to seating along the bar. Past the bar and to the left is a great lounge room filled with overstuffed chairs and couches. Just be aware that you could be sitting on a sofa across for amorous couples on other couches. It can be quite the people watching location for voyeurs!\\n\\nMy fave drink at Apres is the Grape Ape, though they've recently changed the name to the Concord Martini. This drink tastes exactly like a grape jolly rancher. Ahh, memories of childhood, complete with drunken stupor.\\n\\nWe ordered a mixture of appetizers--tomato montrachet, brie and baguette, and hummus. The apps are minimalist, but tasty. As we were just socializing, we weren't in need of any entrees. \\n\\nThe service was okay. It seems like the servers have a little bit of an attitude and a little pushy. For instance, when we arrived, the DJ of the evening offered us a round of free drinks. We collected them from the bar and sat down. When the server initially approached, her first comment was: Oh, I guess I wasn't fast enough for you guys. And she wasn't laughing. I'm not gonna deal with that, so I told her not to be mistaken, these drinks were given to us. She then said to us: \\"From now on, order from me and don't go to the bar.\\" It almost seemed territorial and rude. That's not my first experience with less than stellar wait service at Apres. But I keep returning for the atmosphere and the awesome bartenders.\\n\\nBy the way, if you get there just a few minutes before 10 p.m., you can usually get a pretty good spot in the bar or lounge.

The fact is, I've ignored Fat Matt's in real life too. For some reason, it never took with me despite my many visits in my first few years of residence in Atlanta. Maybe it was the never-ending line or the parking chaos. Maybe it was because I found other, more tourist-averse places. Whatever the reason, it's been a very, very long time since I've visited Matt and I returned only because an old friend who was visiting from out of town had chosen to eat here.\\n\\nLuckily for us, we chose to eat at 5pm which immediately eliminated my two biggest issues: the line and the parking. I got rock star parking AND the line was only three deep. As a result, this review is going to be much kinder than what I'd usually give.\\n\\nIt's a rib shack. The menu isn't that diverse. They serve ribs and chicken and pulled pork and baked beans and collards and, hell, they have their menu painted on the side of the wall. So no, not too diverse. And as far as I can tell, the ribs seem, for the most part, grilled. For BBQ purists, that's a big no-no. But for once, let me step away from BBQ douchebaggery and admit that I actually enjoyed my half rack. Oh, maybe because I haven't had ribs in a long time, but it was tasty. The sauce wasn't cloying sweet, the vinegar adding enough acidity to take care of that. The rib meat was tender, but still had enough structure to withstand a man-sized bite without falling apart into mush.\\n\\nThe beer was mercifully cheap. Merciful because, as an unemployment statistic, I shouldn't be spending my afternoons drinking beer and eating ribs.

The Brunch Fiesta menu is selected items from the menu so you won't have full access to the entire menu for your course choices but there are solid dishes on there so its not really an issue. My go to is the caramelized banana empanada for the first course followed by the sante fe eggs benedict. The green chile hollandaise sauce is seriously fire. You also can't go wrong with the beverages here, the margs are delish and they have a really interesting selection of other refreshing tequila beverages.

The parking lot behind / to the side is small but not prohibitively so.\\n\\nI walked in and the place was busy / crowded enough to prompt me to have a seat at the bar (rather than take up space at a four person / 4 seat table). Right off the bat I wished this place had more single-person or (at least two-person) seating arrangements.\\n\\nThe bar itself is smallish but has about 7 to ten spaces for those flying solo. Another thing I noticed right off the bat is the service (or lack thereof). The bartender ignored me for too long before finally going about the business of taking my order. The service vibe / attitude is a little bit of a cross between \\"I am too cool to be bothered\\" and \\"I will attend to you when I am good and ready.\\"  \\n\\nNot exactly unpleasant, but perhaps there is a no rush / no special treatment sort of manner given to the overall attitude of such a unique environment. I do like the concept and the uniqueness of the place; however, I also prefer servers to be more friendly / accommodating / attentive to the customer. On to the food:\\n\\nWith respect to the menu ( love the concept) my expectations fell far short. I had a quarter pound pork burger (with feta cheese, tomato, lettuce and griddled onions on an egg bun) along with a small side of \\"poutined\\" fries (fries smothered with onion gravy and fresh cheese curds [like the the provincial specialty dish called Poutine that you typically can order any most places in Quebec or at least several spots in Montreal, Canada]). \\n\\nI suppose can say that I liked my pork burger and fries well enough but I cannot say I loved them. I drank one Genesee Cream Ale (The PBR of update NY) with my meal. I have never eaten poutine before, so that was pretty cool. I know I enjoyed my \\"poutined\\" fries more than my pork burger; however, I would not rush back here again to get them. Bottom Line: It was an okay meal but at $19.79 (tax / tip included) way..WAY too pricey. Firmly in the $$ category and can quickly escalate into the $$$ range if one were to splurge.\\n\\nTo Quote Sara M, \\"....We split a pork burger, which was...fine, I guess? We got the smallest one, the 1/4 pound. It was probably the most unremarkable thing I've eaten all week. Not to say it was bad. Just...boring. \\"\\n\\nTo Quote Emily K, \\"...Overall, nothing really blew me away. It was a solid meal in a place with a very specific style. Points for creating a true brand. I (might be) back to try other items on the menu, but given the location and the price point, I (very much) doubt it will be part of the regular rotation.\\"\\n\\nPerhaps really deserves 2.5 stars but because I find the concept so endearing / enticing, I will go with 3 stars."},{"name":"Subway","address":"3730 Carmia Dr, Ste 140","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This location is 4 doors down from Publix at Camp Creek Marketplace (just west of the ATL airport).

You can make a half day event out if it and just have fun with it. I did end up arriving here at 7am on a Friday morning and in my surprise I was the 8th person in line. I thought there would have for sure been at least 40 people in line already. As the time went by, at around 8am there was probably a good 40 people in line and it just kept getting crazier from there. I'm not really sure when the run out of brisket but I would assume that if you show up after 9:00-9:30 you probably don't have that good of a chance of getting brisket. Speaking of brisket, it was amazing. Super fatty, beefy, and delicious. Ribs are also incredible. Best ribs I've ever had. Wasn't a big fan of the turkey or pulled pork but everything else was on point. Also make sure to get a lemon chess pie....so incredible!

This place is horrible."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Where to begin, I will start this review with an admission - I didn't actually make it to the point where I was eating food at Screen Door, this was the first restaurant I have ever left after ordering something to drink.  And the wife and I left quickly.\\n\\nWe went for dinner, I was looking forward to some good southern food - we moved here from GA, I grew up on a farm eating what people call \\"soul food\\", and it was my birthday - I was looking for comfort food.\\n\\nWe arrived and were seated quickly and the waiter came promptly to take our drink order.  My wife ordered sweet tea, I ordered water as I was skeptical of what may come out as \\"sweet tea.\\"  He brought the tea back quickly and then the strikes began to mount against Screen Door.  The 'sweet' tea was not sweet, was lemon flavored, and tasted instant.  If you have ever had true sweet tea traditionally it is very sweet, served with lemons (if you want lemon you can add it), and is ALWAYS brewed.  I have never even seen instant tea in the south, but from my time spent in the northeast, recognized the terrible flavor.  Strike one.\\n\\nNext, we watched as the diner's next to us had their meals come out - veggie plate and shrimp and grits.  Shrimp and grits is a comfort food to me, but after reading about the \\"herb and garlic butter\\" knew that it wasn't going to be served like the shrimp and grits I grew up (creamy grits and a spicy butter sauce) - what arrived at the table next to us looked like what I expected - kinda bland.  The veggie plate was the second strike against screen door.  The mac and cheese looked atrocious.  I understand that creamy velveeta may be the standard mac and cheese elsewhere, but not in the south.  Mac and cheese in the south is as far from velveeta/easy mac creaminess as you can get typically much more solid.  Strike two.  I don't do mac and cheese soup.\\n\\nThen, I asked the waiter about the fried chicken.  Fried chicken is cooked skin on, bone in and traditionally pan fried.  So I asked if the chicken was bone-in skin-on, he said no.  We have de-boned de-skinned chicken in the south....we call them chicken fingers.  No southerner in their right mind is paying $15 for chicken fingers.  Sorry, strike three.\\n\\nThis is the point where we make our exit.  \\n\\nIf I am ever in the mood for trendy food masquerading as southern cuisine, this would be on the top of my list of places to go.  But, I will never be in that mood, so I seriously doubt I will ever go back to Screen Door.\\n\\nEdit:  My wife reminded me of my biggest complaint after leaving Screen Door which I forgot - they mispronounced \\"Vidalia.\\"  Its a little city/area in Georgia that is famous for their sweet onions.  Apparently Screen Door shipped some of their onions in, but forgot to tell their waiters how to pronounce it - and our guy slaughtered it."},{"name":"JuiceLand","address":"6301 West Parmer Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"JuiceLand is hands down my favorite smoothie/juice bar.

We used to go to the Paparazzi quite often. This time though it was a big disappointment. The menu is a one-sided sheet of paper with a far fewer dishes than it was before. For a party of 4 people, they brought 2 pieces of focaccia bread and 3 thin breadsticks. No butter. No plates to land your bread on. We ordered a Caesar salad with anchovies on a side. The salad came without the anchovies. When asked, they were to come right away separately (?). They did appear approximately 20 min. later. Pollo Alla Valdostana, which I ordered came with roasted potatoes and 2 large shrubs of broccoli. Neither chicken nor broccoli was impossible to cut with a regular knife. The chicken especially was very stiff. Both chicken and broccoli were cold. Only roasted potatoes were eatable. The same story was with my friend's choice of the Pollo Picatta, i.e. cold and stiff. We asked for steaks' knives. It was hard to cut chicken even with those. Cappuccino coffee came in small cups without saucers. They were not mugs, but small (demitasse) cups that are usually served with a saucer. Some of us ordered the second cup of cappuccino - same size cups appeared but this time with saucers. This tells me about absence of standards and a worked out procedures of service.    \\n\\nThe service itself was pleasant on the sides of smiles, but there was no anticipation of clients' needs or attention to details. I know that Paparazzi is not a fancy restaurant, but here in Concord, we are used to a certain level of food and service in this restaurant. Not anymore. I was so surprised that on our way out, Is topped at the hostess station to inquire if the restaurant changed hands or acquired a new management. Yes, they did changed hands. Do not belong to a company in RI but to someone else. They named the company that bought them but I do not remember who and where from. The main thing - we will be looking ofr some place else.

A great mix of a little savory and sweet. The tea was simply a lipton tea that comes with a side of cream, nothing special there; then the blue and yellow cornbread that comes with a side of apricot marmalade, some type of maple butter, and some kind of jam. Then the eggs benny with a side of homefries; nice and runny eggs and hollandaise sauce, although the southwestern biscuit was a little more dense than I expected - still good though. \\nOf course, I couldn't eat brunch without a side of meat, so I split a side of smoked bacon with my friend.

For $12, this is more than most people can eat in two sittings!  The dish has spiced chicken(not too spicy), potato and a few other things and is delicious.  The roti is light enough not to notice.  Usually they bring out johnnycakes with some butter as a complimentary starter.  It used to come out sprinkled with sugar but the last few times has not had any - change in recipe perhaps?  I much prefer them sweet rather than savoury.   As for the plantain fries, they are usually to die for.

We once visited on a weeknight evening when the restaurant was nearly empty, only to be ignored by the male server who was hitting on some women at another table.  He only took notice when we walked out.  Usually the female servers are efficient, if a little brisk.  The restaurant does tend to get noisy as the music is louder than it needs to be - and so people tend to shout at each other to make themselves heard.  I wish they wouldn't turn the lights out at night and light the candles - it doesn't seem to me to be a good date-night venue.\\n\\nOverall, The Reef isn't perfect, but it gets the job done.

Next up was the turkey breast, something that you don't see very often at bbq places. this was as equally as well spiced by the rub and very tender and moist. They must have brined it before smoking it to get it that moist, delicious! The hot link wasn't really hot but it was also very good and had a rich spicy flavor to it. My sweetie's brisket was a perfect specimen of what good brisket should be: good bark on the outside, a nice smoke ring just past the bark and wonderflully smookey flavored beef. The sides were also delicious. The cole slaw had juilienned carrots atop it that mixed in well and the potato salad had a touch of spicy mustard added to the mix. We brought our little man with us who will turn 1 next month. We gave him little tastes of our BBQ and he loved it! That's my boy! He mayhave been born in CA but he's a Texan now! The desserts sounded really good, but I'll have to order just a sandwich next time so that I'll have room to try one.

It was a corner table and we were supposed to sit next to each other. We asked to move to one of 10 free tables in this section to be able to face each other for this special night. They told us they were reserved and it was impossible for us to move. This was very surprising to us since we also had a reservation and they gave a us a table with 20mins delay. When we insisted we want to sit on a regular table for two people, they allowed us to the next table. Just to emphasize this happened when we had a reservation for two for a birthday!

We were 16-18th in line. The position was great because the awning and fan helped provide relief from the 100 degree heat. About 40-45 people can find protection from the sun, but after that it's a wait on the sidewalk and in the parking lot. We noticed that the restaurant passed out umbrellas and served waters, beer, and koozies (for a price). Around 8, the restaurant doors were opened for access to the bathrooms. \\n\\nAround 10:30 we packed up the chairs and put away our stuff. The doors opened for business at 11. We were the last to get into the air conditioning of the first group. We got to the counter and ordered at 11:30 and were leaving stuffed with delicious food at 12:15. \\n\\nIf you're going to go, go early. The wait before 11 is really easy in the shade and seated. The wait after 11 is much harder. It's all standing and the line is deceivingly shorter than reality.

Pirates was running a $19 special in honor of Talk Like a Pirate Day, and to be honest--that's what hooked me (no pun intended). $94 off the cost of two tickets for a date night? I'm game! \\n\\nSo the night starts off by pulling into the parking lot, which costs $5 (not too bad considering they give you a $5 off a $10 purchase in the gift store). We waited in a long and dark line outside (they didn't turn the lights on until 8pm, so we waited in the darkness for almost 20 minutes). Once we got our tickets, we were ushered into this jam-packed room of fellow diners and were forced to listen to pirates that were on microphones that were turned up far too loud.\\n\\nThe worst part about this room was how hot and stuffy it was. Every single person that has bought a ticket for the dinner show was stuck in this room with little to no space to even turn around (God forbid you needed to make your way to the restroom!). When it was finally time to enter the dinner area, we were actually told to push our way in! We were literally pushed by fellow diners into this \\"pirate ship\\" area that we were to eat in, and were encouraged to do so!\\n\\nAt this point, I already had a headache due to the sheer volume of the pre-show pirates, but I figure, what the heck? Let's continue with the experience!\\n\\nWe continued into the red portion of the pirate ship (as our tickets instructed us to do) and we were continually pushed and shoved by fellow diners--but honestly, could we blame them? Our pirate leader has literally told us to do this.\\n\\nOnce seated, we were in the middle of a row where the only way out would be to ask 5-6 people in either direction to exit the row so that we may leave to use the bathroom, etc.; not exactly the style I was hoping to eat in. Can we say fire hazard?\\n\\nThe show began, and it was even louder than the pre-show. I swear that female pirate's microphone must have been set to 'ear piercing.' It seems that we were to cheer for our specific pirate, and this is pretty much all we did for the remainder of the evening. \\n\\nA (rather bland) communal salad was passed around, and honestly, it was the highlight of the meal. We were given one glass of Budweiser beer, and when we asked for a refill were told we couldn't have any (although we watched other servers in different areas refilling their customer's glasses), and were handed a coke.\\n\\nWe did our best to watch and follow the show, but it wasn't very well written. A dinosaur egg? A captured princess? A children's boat race? Women from the audience treasure hunting? And singing. Lots and lots (of LOUD!) singing. Nothing seemed to blend or make sense.\\n\\nOur dinner was served, and it was meat on a stick, which we were looking forward to! However, my boyfriend's meat on a stick was all cartilage and fat! Throw that together with trying to eat in the dark (there was honestly no light at all in the back row) and this just led to him spitting it out and going hungry and unsatisfied. My meat wasn't as fatty, so the two of us ended up sharing one meal.\\n\\nEventually we asked our waitress if she could get us a beer (since we already knew it \\"wasn't included\\") and that we would pay for it, and she actually told us no! So I asked the 5 people to my right to get up, and they shimmied out of the row, and I shuffled through the red and yellow 'crews' back out to the bar. There I was told that they only had Bud Light left, and it was $8 for a refill (I neglected to mention we had purchased $14 souvenir drinks during the loud and obnoxious pre-show). I kindly thanked the bartender and walked back in to the very noisyyyyyyy show, where now the pirates were doing backflips, somersaults, and... jumping rope?! Who knew pirates did double dutch in their spare time?!\\n\\nDinner was just being picked up, and I'd like to tell you how dessert was, but alas, I can not. We decided to leave as our headaches were not worth the combined $38 we spent on the experience (not counting the $5 parking and $28 drinks in souvenir glasses).\\n\\nI don't know who I would ever tell to head over to Pirate's Dinner Adventure...

It doesn't look any busier but something's affecting the speed.\\n\\nMy co-worker was quite upset yesterday about how small and expensive her lunch was.

Lord forgive me for my Neanderthal ways...)\\n\\n-The Kim Crawford Sauvingnon Blanc was ambitious but had no body to back it up with.  I followed it with the Whitehaven Sauvingnon Blanc which was pitch-perfect for the pairing.  All in all, I would have to say that the wine list was good, given the selection and imagination it gave ground for.\\n\\n-So, I had the Cannelloni with squash as my entr√©e.  Now this is the quintessential head chef fail: there is nothing that the cooks on duty could have done to make this abomination serviceable as a meal, nor was it anything they had done to sabotage it.  It was a limp cannelloni pasta, filled with mashed squash, with a simmering pool of cheese and wilted spinach on top.  In terms of texture, it was total mush.  In terms of flavor, it really brought nothing to the table other than fat.  Basically, no right-thinking chef should have allowed this creation to disgrace their menu.  But after a good helping of salt and pepper, aforementioned wine pairing, and below mentioned comp loveliness, it filled my belly.\\n\\n-It seemed to be a well-run operation in terms of bar and food service.  But I was very surprised to see a cockroach scamper from under my plate after I had finished.  I mean VERY surprised.  I've eaten from Shanghai to Hermosillo and I've never seen the infamous cockroach in the kitchen before.  I didn't make a big deal about it, because that wouldn't have UNscampered the roach, but there it was.  This place was all set to lose the prerequisite star for insect presence when...\\n\\n-Admittedly, I sat at the bar and therefore probably would have no reason to comment on the service.  With that said...the bartendress who brought my first drink and rang my check was totally devoid of anything more than fake breasts and a nice smile.  She failed.  The other bartendress who tended me throughout my meal was GREAT.  She was attentive, well informed about the menu, and, after I was less than enthusiastic about my entr√©e, voided it from my tab.  This place was totally headed for two star infamy, but she saved it.  If only I had caught her name...\\n\\nSo there you go Sonsie, three stars and be happy you got them.

The presentation was utterly traditional and uninspired.  The salmon crusted with horseradish was a good flavor combination, but the salmon overcooked and the accompanying beans and carrots were unimaginabley boiled and served totally bland.  green beans and the like, in my opinion, need to be cooked in a way that takes the water out of them, much like brussel sprouts.

However, I think that I would have been happier had I ordered the mahi mahi.\\n\\nThe good. Given the price and hype I don't think there is much good to say about this place aside from the fact that overall it was an OK meal. It was enjoyable, but nothing stood out. It is important to note that I was told that they usually are much better than they were tonight. \\n\\nThe bad. First, they rushed us. I know they were only serving 9 or so dishes, but how about some pacing? I don't think we had more than 2 minutes between any course. I think we were out of there in about 45 minutes. Second, the service itself could have been better. I personally do not like to be asked to help the waiters do their job (they didn't ask me, but a friend at the table). \\n\\nThird, the food. The tuna in the appetizer seemed fresh, but was a poor cut. The pastry was somewhat doughy and tasted as if it had been prepared far in advance. The steak frites were ok, but they ended up giving me steak that was medium-well as opposed to medium-rare (I even specifically requested that it be on the rare side). The other people's looked right, but mine wasn't... harumph. The fries that came with the steak also tasted as if they had been pre-made earlier (soggy, etc.). The sorbet was fine. I liked the raspberry as they must have added just the right amount of sugar (very little).  \\n\\nI said it was an OK meal. I don't pay those prices for an OK meal and I certainly don't go back to places that serve OK meals... The price was outrageous given the quality/quantity of food. I actually went home hungry... that's NEVER happened to me. If this were Zagats I'd expect a 20-21 on the food if they rated it based on what they served me tonight.

It's nothing like his restaurant in Old Fourth Ward except for the name.  The concession sells only one food item: $15 steak sandwiches.  That's pricey for a sandwich.  Then again, you *are* in a ballpark and you're paying for premium cuts of beef.\\n\\nThe steak sandwich is made out of New York strip.  The stand is set up so you can see the entire meal preparation from the meat butcher slicing up giant hunks of meat to the chef assembling each sandwich.  I didn't ask, but I'm guessing the sirloin is cooked medium well to well done.  It's sliced into several small pieces and served between two soft buns that have been dressed on the inside with a bit of au jus.  A small plastic container of horseradish and a side of chips is included with the sandwich.  Everything is served on a paper food tray.\\n\\nI tried one of these sandwiches at the Braves vs. Miami Marlins game last night and it was OK.  The meat was mostly tender and a little bit fatty.  The au jus made the buns soggy.  Toasting the buns might be a good idea.  The thick horseradish sauce was good.  Perhaps they could add more condiment options like mayo or steak sauce.  There were salt and pepper shakers, but they were located before checkout, so I doubt anybody used them.  They'd have to walk back through the line, against traffic, to get to them.  A small condiment stand after checkout would be nice.\\n\\nThere was a generous amount of potato chips.  The chips were similar to Kettle chips in that they were extra crunchy.\\n\\nI'm not sure if the sandwich is worth $15, but luckily, I had a season ticket which meant the sandwich was only $10.  All food stands are 33% off if you purchase a Braves season ticket package over 20 games.  The cashier scanned my ticket at the register to apply the discount.\\n\\nKevin Rathbun Steak is a nice local addition to Turner Field.  The stand always seemed busy with a short line of people waiting.  The staff did a good job of processing orders and keeping traffic moving."},{"name":"The Oakwood Canadian Bistro","address":"2741 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Amazing meal!

If this is any indication of the general food scene in Portland, I may need to make a few more trips south on I-5. We had an inkling from Yelp as to what the crowd would look like. We planned accordingly and arrived about 25 minutes before opening. There was still a line out the door of about 20 people ahead of us. No sweat. To me it just made me that much more excited to eat knowing this many people were this eager to eat here. It bugs me a little bit when people complain about the wait at places like this. It's a small restaurant that's extremely popular... seems only natural you would have to wait. Nothing they can do about it.\\n\\nThey were efficient about getting everyone in to the restaurant right off the bat. Understandably, with each server having to greet all of their tables and put in all of their orders roughly at the same time, and with the kitchen having to handle one large influx of orders, I would've expected a bit of a disruption in service or a longer wait to eat (as a former restaurant employee, this is the worst possible situation to be in). While there may have been a small delay in the food coming out, overall the service was excellent and timely and everything seemed to be running very smoothly. \\n\\nI did look at the menu, but it was more of a formality. I knew from the pictures that there was only one dish for me. The chicken and waffles are absolutely incredible. First of all, this is about a 1.5x size dinner entree portion of chicken. Kudos to anyone comfortably taking all that down... I'm always a fan of chicken and waffles, and the quality of the dish inevitably varies with the quality of the chicken. Here I can say that Screen Door does a fantastic job with their chicken. Not surprising considering this is their signature dish (I assume).

I was actually hoping that it would just be good BBQ so I could debunk the myth.  With really good BBQ around like Salt Lick, Stubbs, Cooper's, etc., etc. (without the lines), there was no way Franklin was going to be worth the wait! Nothing could justify those lines!  That said, as impossible as it sounds, it was even better than the rave reviews suggested!!  There's a reason Franklin is number 1 on most every list of best BBQ!!  It is the best BBQ EVER!!!!!!  Almost otherworldly!!  I don't know Aaron Franklin, but while eating the amazing brisket, I was actually reminded of the Robert Johnson myth.  Who knows?!?

Throughout the wait, my friends and i slowly munched away on cuties and chocolate croissants but by the time 12 rolled around, we were hungry. But i thought, \\"its okay, just another hour or so, it'll  be fine!\\". We finally make it through the door at 1:20, but you're  not home free, you still got an hour wait... \\n\\nThe torcherous part is that hour wait you are inside. As you watch customers happily munch on the bbq, something stirs inside of you. A monster you never knew you had! During the wait, an employee had taken our estimated orders, and of course 2 groups in front of us, was guaranteed ribs. We were told that there was a decent  chance they would be gone by thr tome we got up there. We prayed to the bbq gods the entire time in line, but it was awful seeing other customers with half a rack of ribs that they were going to be taking home. \\n\\nWhen we finally got to the counter, the butcher cut up a small end piece for us to sample, i never shoved food in my mouth as fast as i did at that moment. And of course, the man in front of us had gotten the last of the ribs. :( \\n\\nWe ordered (for 3 ppl) 1lb of brisket(half fatty and half lean), 1/2 lb of sausage, 1/4 turkey, 1/4 pulled pork. \\n\\nLots of ppl come just  for the brisket but honestly if its your first time, id recommend a little of everything. \\n\\nThe turkey and pulled pork was GOOD but they weren't  \\"omg I'd wait 5.5 hrs for this\\" good.

I can honestly say, i think there is better out there but  the brisket is hands down, \\"yes, i would wait in this God forsaken line again\\" good! I liked the fatty pieces more than the lean but either way the tenderness and flavor is the best brisket bbq I've had and ever will have. \\n\\nBut i can say, I'm  not 100% sure if it was worth the wait, i would wait about 3.5 hrs but 5.5 almost 6 is pushing it.... \\n\\nIf i ever do this again, I'll be there at 6am, i m gonna eat at 11!!!"},{"name":"Tokyo Japanese Steak House","address":"250 Granite St","city":"Braintree","stars":"3","text":"The decor here is beautiful, I was hesitant to give it the full 5 stars but figured people in the area should really give it a shot.

Brisket good. Ribs good. Sausage good. Sauce good. Sides good. So I'll just offer out some tips that some of you may or may not already know about:\\n\\nExpect a line. Duh. But have fun out there. Start at like 7 or 8 AM and get some chairs and an umbrella (or support your local economy and rent a chair from the Franklin's chair guy - 5 bucks I think?). Have some drinks, read a book, or do your taxes...whatever. You'll be spending some time here. Also, check out the Franklin's cam: https://twitter.com/FranklinBBQline\\n\\nIf you don't want to wait in line, just pre-order your barbecue. Franklin's will accept email orders once a month and you can bypass the line when you schedule your pickup if you're one of the first ones to get your orders in. There are some minimums you have to meet (no pun intended), but just order a whole lot of barbecue and have a party (or hoard it in the freezer like we do!).\\n\\nI haven't done this. But what are people's thoughts on the guy on craigslist that you can pay to stay in line for you? Is he even still around?\\n\\nThe last alternative is to be Barack Obama. All you have to do is get nominated and voted into office, and you can cut the line no problem. Oh yeah, also pay for the guy you are cutting in front of.\\n\\nThis dude is famous and the hype makes it so hard to get some barbecue.

I do think they wanted the food to be good. But everything tried too hard. All the creativity of the menu resulted in perhaps a bit too much creativity - all the flavors struggled with each other instead of complimenting each other and the goodness of the actual ingredients were completely buried in the flavors. \\n\\nBut, the concept of the pop-up restaurant is good. Because I like the setting so much, I may be be willing to try the next food concept that shows up.  I do hope it is not equally interesting just for the sake of being interesting.

It is also testament to the fact that sleaze can come in all forms: from well-spoken, dressed, and slightly buzzed business women/men to Dorchester-bred bachelorettes fresh off the Party Bus. \\n\\nAll in all, Sonsie is what you make of it.

Drinks were given quickly, took a good 15/20 minutes for the burgers to arrive. But my god, when they arrived I have never seen such magnificence! I sat there for a few minutes debating on how the hell I was going to actually eat this thing! It was hands down, one of the best burgers I've put in my mouth. It's sits close to as excellent as Guy Ferraris burgers that I've had on a recent carnival cruise ship! The truffle fries were good but the regular fries I liked better. Truffle oil is very strong and a little goes a long way. Just not the biggest fan of the taste but the fries were delicious. All in all, it's a great little local burger joint.

It is such a great space ( a really cute little house with an amazing veranda) so it does have a lot of potential.  I also really appreciate the home-y vibes they were getting at with family pictures, etc...   My one real issue was that it seemed kind half-hearted.  The tables were cheap-looking, catering quality types with no tablecloths and lame rental-style chairs.

It's pretty much a Chipotle style pizza bar where you build your own pizza. You can choose from one of their preset pizzas (and add on if desired) or just start from scratch. After placing my order and paying, it took about 5-10 minutes for my pizza to come out. It was reminiscent of a New York pizza but less doughy. The crust was thin and crispy. The pizza was filling and light. I had the \\"bacon and shroom\\" pizza with artichoke, spinach, and tomato added on. It was absolutely delicious and heavenly.

I was just kind of caught off-guard by her response.\\n\\nThe place is tiny, you can basically watch them make your food right behind the register as you wait.

This was news to me (there has always been the policy of two or more people in the booths) and this certainly makes sense for weekend brunch--peak times--when there are waiting lists and often many customers standing outside.  The restaurant was about half full (many of the center tables empty)--but ok--I went outside to sit on the bench to wait for my friends and almost immediately one of them arrived.  We went inside to see if we could be seated--the host hesitated and then directed us to a table for two people -- rudely threw the menus on the table and walked away (knowing full well we were expecting one other person).  My friend and I decided to call our other friend to see where she was--at which point she walked in the door and so we needed to ask for a larger table... all this would not have really been a problem if the host had not been so unpleasant and rude...and was such a turn off.   As I mentioned, had it been a busy weekend with a waiting list --perfectly understandable policy--but for a half-empty restaurant on a weekday?!!   \\n\\nSorry Arlington Diner....the young host may have made a questionable judgment call (perhaps they were expecting a mid-morning sudden rush?) but there was no need for being treated so rudely and that is where I draw the line--you just lost a long-standing customer."},{"name":"Zucca Italian Ristorante","address":"808 Main St","city":"Louisville","stars":"4","text":"We always have a nice time at Zucca.

Parking can be tricky, so unless you live close enough to walk, be careful where you park around Lake Davis b/c your car might get towed. The building structure seems to have been neglected over the years, nothing fancy here. The falafel and lake emerald are okay vegetarian options on the menu. Based on previous experiences, which were always pleasant, I decided to order breakfast here one morning.\\n\\nAnd I will never make that mistake again. I once thought it was impossible to ruin breakfast, but 903 seemed to have a run-in with Murphy's Law. The cubed eggs were absolutely atrocious and slightly sour. The fruit smelled like mildew.

I was only a wee lass who was very excited that we were talking to a big scary clown and asking him for burgers with extra \\"secret sauce\\" from the seats of my sister's cool 67 Ford Falcon.  I shall cherish that memory.\\n\\nThen came my teen-age years, where a super taco and a hot lemon turnover was pretty much the perfect munchie food for the wee hours of the night, where you really didn't know where the hell you were, but you were REALLY hungry and Jack was a familiar face with whom  you wanted to spend some time discussing a few important matters concerning the nature of the universe and perpetual motion. \\n\\nThen came college and grad school, where your two tacos for .99 became life savers.  This is, apparently, what the financial aid people think you should live on, along with top ramen.  Oh Jack, thank you for those 99 cent tacos and keeping me alive.\\n\\nThen came my adult years of realizing I needed to be healthy.  I realized I could still go through the drive-thru after going to the gym and get a chicken fajita pita, without cheese and a diet coke --ALL for under 250 calories!!\\n\\nJust for old times sake, I stopped in for those 99 cent tacos the other day.  They were wonderful.  Same scary mystery meat, same weirdly appealing taco sauce, lots less cheese food.  Still tasty.   Still filling.  Still 99 cents.  Can't beat that.\\n\\n\\npostscript -- I forgot to add that I read about Jack in Fast Food Nation.  They once had an \\"unfortunate e coli incident\\".

The team was incredibly welcoming of my daughter, so I'd definitely say this place was child friendly. The pacing of food was impeccable for a fully booked/packed restaurant as well. I was impressed. Additionally, they are dedicated to service. Even with the boil water advisory for Decatur that closed many restaurants, the peeps at Revival were so dedicated, they purchased TONS of bottled water for their patrons and explained how everything was still safe.\\n\\nSurprisingly, for a southern food restaurant, they also did a great job with options for my vegetarian father. No vegetarian entree at the moment and several of the seemingly vegetarian sides (cornbread, creamed potatoes, creamed corn) were NOT vegetarian, as they make use of pig backfat (which seriously made things taste freaking incredible). Not surprisingly for a southern restaurant, I would not go here while you're on a diet. Yoda says: calorie-laden the food here is.\\n\\nAs far as the food, everything was AMAZING! We went family style. The hot ham sandwiches were phenomenal, and everyone loved the pickled green tomatoes that came with them. As silly as it sounds, the local kale salad was INCREDIBLE! I could have seriously eaten a whole plate of that for dinner. Crap, now I'm craving it. The kale is so tender because they massage it for 15 to 20 minutes in grapeseed oil. And the dressing - phenomenal! We also got the fried chicken and IT. IS. THE. BEST. FRIED. CHICKEN. EVER!!!! Perfectly crispy, thick skin with incredibly moist meat inside. It was heaven. As mentioned, the corn bread was also divine. Slightly salty with a delightfully crispy crust paired with sweet butter. The sides were also fabulous. My (and my toddler's favorite) was the creamed potatoes. The creamed corn, local greens, and zucchini-squash pancake were also great. My parents loved the peas and snaps dish and my father raved about the large serving of the pan roasted mushrooms he got as an entree. We were stuffed, so we didn't try all of our desserts. We did share the butterscotch trifle, and it was so amazing. It had a fabulous combination of textures and flavors.\\n\\nIt was pricey. Family style was $42/person.

The place wasn't even packed, and we have been there packed nights. \\n\\nLIn my experience, which is 8 years working in hospitality in a range of roles, including management, a persons place within capacity limits should only be saved for a 'smoke break' if a cover is paid. Also, if it's not 11pm yet and 7 people leave the bar- let 7 people in!! Don't just have paying customers stand outside while the bouncer checks his Facebook. Honestly, not welcoming paying customers in when capacity is available is poor business practice. If you're the manager reading this, please confront the bouncer working tonight (Saturday) and teach him how to count guests. 7 people waiting while 7 people just left... Don't make us wait another 10 minutes. We left the line after waiting. Won't be returning. They don't even have proper mule mugs for their mules and this is supposed to be a proper old school bar.

We walked around the neighborhood and eventually ended up getting a snack from the Cheese & Crack Snack Shop (no regret). \\n\\nAfter an hour we finally got seated in their dining area outside. It was a cold and chilly day in December but they had outdoor heating coming from the ceiling lamps so that was pretty considerate! We came into the restaurant with our carry-on luggage since we were going to catch a flight after brunch and the staff was very considerate, they kept our luggage in their office so it wouldn't get in our or anyone else's way (thanks!). \\n\\nIt was already 1:30 PM when we sat down (they close weekend brunch at 2:30 PM) but the restaurant itself was still packed from wall to wall. Clearly, this place is poppin'. After seeing stacks of chicken and waffles served to tables all around us, we ordered their two most popular dishes.\\n\\n* Praline Bacon *\\nThis is dangerous. Slightly sweet, slightly salty, slightly savory, plenty fatty. I was expecting the bacon to be more crispy but this bacon is served quite soft. It was delicious but anymore than a couple bites felt too heavy, on my body and my soul. Perfect to share!\\n\\n* Fried Chicken & Waffles *\\nPancake stacks are so yesterday; it's all about a stack of fried chicken atop a thick and fluffy waffle now. The batter is very flavorful, with flakes of black peppercorn all over it. The chicken is moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. The sweet potato waffle was soft and airy, almost like a sponge (delicious). You can actually taste the sweet potato flavor! We got one order of this to share and it was more than enough food.

Me and my wife had been looking for a high end place to enjoy southern inspired cuisine since the Watershed relocated to Buckhead.  Unfortunately South City Kitchen did not deliver as advertised.\\n\\nWas the food horrible?  No it wasn't, but it was nothing special either and when you charge in excess of 20 dollars for an entree you can't afford to offer mediocrity.  There are too many good restaurants now in Atlanta that will offer great food at similar prices.\\n\\nFor those that care about the details here is a run down of the meal I just had and why I feel the way I do.  I went there this past Saturday with my wife at 5:30 PM.  The restaurant was relatively empty since dinner peak times hadn't yet started.  We split 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 1 dessert.\\n\\nFried green tomatoes: This item is described on the menu as being served with a red pepper coulis.  The sauce the dish came in had nothing to do with a coulis or red peppers.  It looked and tested like a simple marinara pizza sauce.  It didn't taste bad, but it completely overpowered the flavor of the tomatoes and the goat cheese they were stuffed with.\\n\\nPork belly.  Advertised as melt in your mouth tender by other reviewers.  Well sure.  it was tender like any meat that has been smoked for a long time, but where was the crispy skin?  That is what makes pork belly, without the crispy crackling is nothing more than a bad piece of smoked ribs.  The piece we got was particularly fat and felt like eating a gross piece jello.\\n\\nShrimps and grits: advertised as their signature dish.  i am still scratching my head as to what was signature about this dish.  What we got tasted like plain simple grits, like you can get at any decent breakfast joint in Atlanta and some medium size shrimps.  Were the shrimps properly cooked?  Sure, but come on this is your signature dish.  How about elevate it in some way. \\n\\nVegetable plate: this dish was plain out horrible.  It was advertised on the menu as a collection of spring vegetables with gnocchi like dumplings.  It was nothing more than a giant plate of black peas with a small terrine of little dumplings that were so lemony to the point of being uneatable.  The whole dish was just a disaster.\\n\\nPecan Pie: again advertised as their signature dessert.  The flavor of a pecan pie is all in the combination of the custard and pecan mixture.  When you serve it as a mini tart you have to make sure that the balance is preserved.  The whole thing was a gigantic piece of pie crust with a handful of whole pecans cooked on top.  The custard was practically non existent and the only thing that was easy to discern was the bitterness of the raw pecans.  The vanilla ice cream it was topped with was the only thing worth eating and sadly enough the best thing I tasted all night. \\n\\nThe 2 starts are for decent, attentive and well accommodating wait staff."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Attended the opening night craziness as well.\\n\\nThe food was great.

While the bucatini was perfectly-sized for a hungry diner, the chicken parm was large enough for three people. The only way that I can describe how good this food was is to talk about chili or soup. Do you know how much better chili and soup taste the day after you make them? How all of the flavors combine in this perfect marriage of their ingredients? That was the way I can describe the sauce used for my bucatini; perfectly balanced, rich and delicious. The bucatini in my dish and the fusilli in the parm dish were both cooked to perfection.

The bleu cheese croquette appetizer was also tasty and paired well with our wine and beer, and the mussels too. Fries had good texture and were salted just right.\\n\\nWhat could be better:\\n1) It was so dark inside (7 pm in November) that we had to use the light of our iPhones to read the menu.  We're both over 50 and our eyes need more light, granted, but we're customers and the low light detracted from our dining experience.  You also couldn't see what you were eating, which could have been dangerous as I almost bit down on a mussel shell that was hard to distinguish from a bacon bit.\\n2) As a Francophile and francophone, I find it very annoying when restaurants try to be 'authentic' or cute and end up mangling the language.  The bar menu strung a few French words together, including \\"recommende', as in \\"Drinks we recommend\\".  That's not how you'd say it in French.  Find a native speaker to translate things or just forget it.   \\n3) The mussels 'Normandy' style included cider, cream, mustard and bacon. Cider and cream are traditional Norman flavorings, mustard and bacon are more in the style of Lyon. I wouldn't quibble except for the fact that the taste of the dish wasn't as appealing as it could be due to the mishmash of flavor styles.\\n4) At the end of the meal we had to ask to get a hand wipe to clean our fingers.  The server brought a warm moist towel with lemon, which was perfect.  But we shouldn't have to ask.  Come on, you're a mussel restaurant and mussels are best eaten with one's fingers; hand wipes should be standard issue.\\n5) The music veered towards heavy metal/rock and was rather loud.  Didn't seem to fit the ambiance.\\n6) The food took about 20 minutes.  It does say on the menu to expect up to a 30 minute wait during peak times, though I'm not sure why that would be since mussels take about 5 minutes to cook.\\n\\nOverall, not bad but don't know if I'll go back anytime soon.  IMO La Moule is in the same league as many other Portland restaurants in that their heart is in the right place and the food is decent, but details that would make for a really good dining experience are missing."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"When I first found this place online, I thought I had found a Pink's hot dog equivalent.

NO SMOKING inside since it is Fla. law \\nI read another reviewer say the Sweet Tea was really good and she's right I had it for the 1st time today and another young lady that works at another business in the same strip plaza came in and ordered a Sweet Tea to go and commented it on being the best she ever had as well. So that's about it! When your in the mood for a great NON CHAIN Home Cooking place for breakfast where they care about the quality and quantity of the food, you won't find too many better places here in O-town."},{"name":"D√∂ner Kebab","address":"515 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The sign outside says \\"German food\\", and doner kebab certainly qualifies, despite its origins - it has become one of the most popular take-out dishes in Germany.   The words \\"doner kebab\\" literally mean \\"rotating meat\\", and you might be familiar with the concept from other cultures - being similar to a gyro, or shawarma.\\n\\nI'd never noticed this little place at 515 SW 4th in downtown Portland, largely because the sign, store front, really don't leap out at you.  And for some reason, I discovered, I am more likely to walk on the other side of the street in this neighborhood.\\n\\nBut \\"discover it\\", I did, yesterday, and was surprised, when I inquired, to find out they have been open over two years.\\n\\nIn addition to the rotating meat sandwiches and plates, you'll find a wide variety of typical German sausages, including garlic, bier, brat, or weisswursts (the latter made from minced veal and bacon), as well as schnitzels, rouladen, and sauerbraten.\\n\\nDoner Kebab has some vegetarian options, and salads as well.   My first inclination was to go with wienerschnitzel on  a bun, however they only offer the veal on a plate - if you want a schnitzel sandwich, chicken is your choice.    I would have liked a little more flexibility from the kitchen to accommodate my request, but it was strictly \\"verbotten.\\"\\n\\nSo I went with the garlic sausage on a bun, akin to a polish sausage in texture and taste, and the bun is more like the traditional flat bread used for the gyro-like sandwiches,  but no complaint from me on that.  It was stuffed full of a delicious kraut, with was generously flavored with bacon pieces, a nice surprise.\\n\\nThey'll bring you a nice tray of mustards, 7 or 8 varieties, which I thought was a nice touch, and although I am usually not adventurous in this category, I really like the wasabi-lime mustard.   Their specialty mustards are furnished by Terrapin Ridge, a northern Illinois company.   I hadn't heard of this company before, unusual, having lived in that area.  It's a nice change to see these, in a town where usually 'adventurous' mustards are usually provided by local producer, Beaverton Foods. (which is a very good product, as well). \\n\\nThe restaurant touts their 'home-made' fries, which were kind of unusual.  They have a slight breading, and almost the texture of an extruded potato product, but with bits of potato skin which would lead you to believe they are cut potatoes.  The result is a very light french fry, fried in, I believe, one of the 'healthier' oils, giving a tasty and not so oily experience.\\n\\nTable condiments are completed by having salt and pepper grinders ringside.\\n\\nThis place reminds me of a typical casual food shop in Europe, and certainly that's their goal - and they succeed, right down to the bathroom style and fixtures.\\n\\nThe help is perfunctorily courteous, the food hot and fresh,  This is definitely a new lunch stop for me, as perhaps a new take-out dinner choice (open til 8PM), and - for some reason, open 1A-4A on weekends for the bar crowd.\\n\\nBeverage choices range from Pepsi products to a dozen well-known German beers, little emphasis on local craft brewing here, and that's absolutely fine.\\n\\nThere are more than a couple places to get your schnitzel on in Portland these days, but these guys really do it right.\\n\\nMenus and descriptions can be found online."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"when you think you know about BBQ and then you go to Texas and it slaps you in the face...

I haven't found a place in NYC or LA that has the onion chutney available yet.  The sweet brown one and the green mint is ubiquitous on both coasts, but the onion chutney has been sorely missed.  The Chat was fantastic, mixed with the perfect balance of sweet and sour sauce.  The Chicken Makhni was creamy and went perfectly with the naan.

I still don't get how there can be so much variance and opinion, I mean smoke some meat and have a good sauce and you're set.  It's not like spare ribs, pork shoulder, or brisket are the highest quality cuts of meat in the world, so BBQ snobbery is a bit played out if you ask me.  BBQ really has become a mythical beast and clearly there is no definitive standard as you'll see people reciting their credentials and saying it's the best in the area right next to someone else reciting their credentials and bashing a place.  Well, my credentials are that I like smoked meat that isn't fatty and slimy or dry and tough.\\n\\nEnter Fat Matt's.  I was drawn in by the great atmosphere.  It's in the midst of a string of crowded parking lots but feels like a nice casual BBQ shack, complete with outdoor dining, and an acoustic guitar playing chubby guy (could it have been Fat Matt??)  The menu is pretty minimal, but really you should just take the hint and order the namesake, i.e. ribs.  If I recall correctly all they have are chopped pork, ribs, and sides.\\n\\nThese ribs redefined \\"falling off the bone\\", and were actually almost too tender.  When I picked up my first rib, the bone actually came right out of the meat, squeaky clean.  I was freaked out and didn't realize ribs could do that!  Regardless, smokiness, tanginess, sweetness, and deliciousness were divine.  One of the best TASTING ribs I've had.  I would've liked some more structure to it though, as each one was essentially falling apart into a big soggy mess.  Still, the flavor was excellent.  The sides were pretty good too.\\n\\nI cannot make any claim about how these compare to other BBQ in the area.  I loved the feel of the place, and loved the taste of the ribs, and that was good enough for me to become a fan of Fat Matt's."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"best dimsum in chinatown.  try shrimp dumplings, shrimp in a blanket, or most dumplings."},{"name":"Pok-e-Jo's Smokehouse","address":"2121 Parmer Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great Food and even better service, you will not find better BBQ in Central TX then add in their amazing choice of sides.

The standout for him was the the mac & cheese.  I had a couple of bites and I have to agree that it was yummy. If you were to order the mac & cheese by itself it would only cost $4.50 which I think is a steal for this tasty goodness.\\n\\nConsidering how busy it was when I dined there, the customer service was great.
