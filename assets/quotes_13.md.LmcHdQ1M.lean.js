So we went in and all, but we waited 40 minutes to order our drinks and food but no one ever came to our table.

My first and only experience at this bar was beyond exhaustive. Quality customer service would make it a mission to inform guests that their wait time on all food is at least 2 hours and 45 minutes. I have never been to a restaurant with this long wait time, but was willing to compromise because our expectations for a quality meal were rather hopeful. The food however, never came. There was karaoke to go on for days it seemed, but a lack of customer service skills from the entire staff -- from the waitress to the manager. We were told that the burger we ordered would take the longest to cook due to the thickness of the meat. This was mostly understood, as we like our meat well done. We also ordered small bites like wings, which we asked to come out as an appetizer. The wings did not come out first, not even within an hour and thirty minutes. When we finally demanded that our wings (which should have only taken 20 min max) come out, they brought 8 hard, tight wings that had not been cooked properly. Both waitresses that interacted with us had bad attitudes, and to top it off, the manager was trying to convince us that this restaurant is \\"Not the Cheesecake Factory\\". The third item ordered was a chilly dog, which apparently took the full 2 hours and 45 min to cook as well. We never even saw the chilly dog. We finally asked for a refund and was told by the manager that they do not issue refunds on food. Terrible bar. Terrible service."},{"name":"Hachiro Ramen","address":"140 16th Street W","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"The ramen I had here was, unfortunately, the worst ramen I've ever had in my life.

My friend were sweating and dying but surprisingly it was perfect for me. Perhaps it was my strategy of alternating between chicken and cole slaw and mac and cheese and a generous chugging of their free sweeeeet tea that pulled me through.  Chicken was deliciously moist and that skin was crack (as in physically and psychologically)--wonderfully spiced and seasoned! I loved that they had some bread underneath it that soaks up the extra oils and juices and give you more to eat! Coleslaw was wonderfully tangy and just right to cut the heaviness of the rest of the dish. \\n\\nIt was 11.50-13.50 for a meal (your choice of white, dark, wings). Honestly I would find two other friends and split the whole chicken option of 28 bucks and then make a mad dash to the nearest ice cream shop to soothe our palates. \\n\\nI would say one of my favorite things was the community tables.

The service is always on point and the food is delicious.  We started with a cold seafood tower which included a crazy amount of shrimp cocktail, lump crab meat, lobster, oysters on the half shell, and crab legs.  I had everything but the oysters (allergic) and it was such a treat!  We also ordered the goat cheese pimiento fritters which are always amazing. I especially love the pepper jelly that the fritters come served over in the dish.  For my entree, I ordered the Salmon Oscar style with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. For the table, we also ordered a side of lobster mac and cheese (which is not on the lunch menu but can always be requested, nonetheless). However, my favorite part of the meal was dessert.  That butter cake is to die for!! It was a hint of lemon in the cake and topped with blueberry compote and vanilla ice cream.  This is easily my favorite dessert option on their menu.  If you really want to go into a seafood \\"coma\\", come on the weekends for their brunch.  The options are endless and you get to try a little bit of everything.

I'm not thrilled with the new location it's very large and so It has lost the warmth that a small place can offer to people and make them feel right at home. I think customers will get used to the bigger size eventually. The main reason that I posted this however, is that I have a medical disorder and  it makes eating and drinking extremely difficult. When I try eating or drinking, unfortunately (and quite frequently ) I am unable to keep things down, and it causes me to go to the hospital once or twice a month because I need fluids and nutrients to try and counteract my inability to keep food down. The old location was wonderful and once I explained my situation they were so kind and allowed me to order off the children's menu. I can only eat between a quarter or a half of the serving from the children's menu and even with that small amount I often can't keep it down. I've been to the new location once, and they would not allow me to use the children's menu so I had to order off the regular menu but was only able to eat three bites. The waitress just refused to budge even after I told her what was going on with my health. My sister and niece went in today to speak with the manager in hopes that with a group of five people for tomorrow that we would be able to go there and that I would be allowed to order from the children's menu. The manager Melissa was initially adamant about refusing to let me order from the children's menu, because she felt that it would encourage other customers(adults ) to want to also order from the kids menu. Eventually, she said that she would allow me to use the kids menu but she did so reluctantly and my sister and niece were upset that they had to have such a lengthy discussion with her and that they had to work hard to explain to her that I'm only able to eat about three or four bites of anything and sometimes even  that much is too much. They felt intimidated and uncomfortable that they had to divulge so much of my condition before she was willing to work with them. On the rare occasions that I do go out to eat I will often not order anything at all and just have a couple of bites of whatever my friends and family order. I order from a children's menu if the food choices my friends make are for foods that I can no longer eat. This is the first time since I've been sick with this disorder that any restaurant has been reluctant to accommodate my limitations. Makes me feel like I'm being discriminated against. I always like to try and support local and small businesses in my community whenever I can and as a Weymouth resident I wanted to give them my business. I am frustrated that I wasn't allowed to order as I needed to on my first visit to their new location and I'm disappointed that the manager seemed so put out when she was asked to accommodate my needs. As a result, we've decided to go to Percy's in Kingston. They have great food and they are always happy and willing to accommodate any special considerations or limitations that a customer may have. I would have given the Mad Hatter zero stars as a rating but unfortunately that wasn't an option. It's nice to know that there are many restaurants that will work with you to ensure that you have a nice meal and that in turn makes you a happy and satisfied customer that will continue to do business with them on a regular basis. Percy's has terrific food and an extensive  menu and is always worth the trip. Too bad that the Mad Hatter is so rigid and so unwilling to work with, and accommodate customers with special circumstances that even when she finally decided to allow the use of the children's menu we realized we wouldn't feel comfortable eating there, and then they end up losing business. I saw that a new restaurant has opened at the old location and I look forward to trying it. I have a feeling that they will work with me.

If going during peak dinner hours I would definitely recommend getting a reservation, as it was very crowded.  We reserved our table about 2 weeks in advance, and the timeslot options were already pretty limited at that time.\\n\\nI loved the open layout of the place, with the bar, dining room, and kitchen all sharing the large space, with high ceilings, open windows, etc.  Despite this, the main dining area did feel overcrowded with small tables packed in tightly together.  Our party of three was seated at a corner table that would have been better for two people, and the other diners were close enough that their conversations were distracting, and there was very little room to move between tables.  When addressing the table next to us the waitress had to stand right up against our table.  So I do wish we could have felt more comfortable to linger longer over our food and drinks... That would be my one main complaint.\\n\\nAs for the food itself, it did not disappoint.  We started with the cucumber salad, which consisted of thinly sliced cukes attractively rolled around feta, peppers, and other bits and pieces, with lots of garnish and two delicious sauces.  This was actually my favorite dish of the evening!  We then had the nachos special, which featured a soft pork meat (I forget what kind), some interesting cheese sauces, pickled jalapenos, fresh veg and a dusting of I believe cayenne.  Then we had the farro kimchi-fried rice, which we all agreed was too salty and was our least favorite.  I could not detect much kimchi in there either.  Finally we had the Jamaican jerk chicken with charred pineapple, my second favorite dish of the night.  It could have been spicier for me, but I like things ridiculously spicy, and it had a really great flavor - heavy on the cinnamon, which I love.  Except for the kimchi fried rice, we liked everything and would be very keen to go back and try some of the rest of the menu."},{"name":"Santo","address":"1265 Alpine Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I have been vegetarian my whole life and ordered something making it very clear that I don't want to meat in it.

You can even make your way to Eataly without ever having to step outside. I had a king corner room, which was great since it was slightly bigger than the standard room. The TV in the room is also pretty decently sized. Wifi is free if you're a Marriott Bonvoy member. Seems like a lot of hotels are doing that now to up their loyalty membership so I can't really fault them.\\n\\nThe main complaint I have about this hotel is their elevators. Although they have a high-tech elevator system which assigns you a specific elevator when you choose the floor you're trying to reach, their elevators are super slow, particularly on the way down. I've found myself waiting 5-10 minutes for an elevator a few times, which is much too long. Other than this, I enjoyed my stay overall.

The only thing that was worth eating out of my entire order was the gf/vegan decadent peanut butter chocolate bar, but overall I feel like I wasted time/money here... if I could give any advice to this business, it would be to either store the items better so that they don't go bad so quickly, or to throw them out and make more fresh before selling them to customers.

We also ordered two sides: a chicken noodle soup and a Caesar salad. It took about 20-25 minutes to get our food, and when we did get it, it was cold and we did not receive our sides. \\n\\nI asked the manager if he could just heat up our plates for us, and he was amazing with regards to customer service! He brought us completely new plates, gave us two FREE MEAL VOUCHERS, and gave us a free dessert. Then, the big boss came over and apologized personally for the cold food and said they were having a rough shift. Completely understandable, we are all humans after all. Also, the warm plates and sides when we got them were great! The food itself is so fresh and you can personalize as well; for example I was able to get gluten-free pasta! You can add any kind of meat to your pasta bowl as well (they even have tofu) although it costs around $3 extra.\\n\\nAs for the restaurant itself, the menu is huge and plastered on the side wall so it is very easy to read. I wear glasses and sometimes ordering at a counter can be difficult when there is a line behind me and I can't read the small print. No worries here! Very large and legible wall-sized menu right to your left when you walk in. All of the pasta bowls also come with calorie information and don't let a diet discourage you! I got a small bowl of Bangkok Curry another time I went there and it had 270 calories and was full of fresh veggies.\\n\\nAlso, there are two sizes: small and regular. There is only a few dollar difference between the two sizes so it might be a good idea to buy the regular (around $7) and bring the extra home. They also have kid's meals for $5, and fountain drinks with free refills. There is plenty of parking and seating inside the restaurant. I would definitely recommend. Two people get 2 bowls of pasta, 2 sides, and 2 drinks for $20. Can't go wrong.\\n\\nHonestly, at first I was reluctant to shell out money for pasta when a box of pasta costs less than a dollar at the supermarket.

Interestingly, their chai's are more like fancy renditions on milk tea since they use a variety of tea blends and ingredients.\\n\\n(+++) Smoky Robinson (rich and smoky with vanilla, cinnamon, clove, Assam and Lapsang Souchong teas) - My favorite! The black tea blend is bold, and the smokey vanilla infusion is tantalizing. Hints of campfire-roasted marshmallows.\\n\\n(+++) Heart of gold (rich, toasty coconut, golden tumeric, clove, cardamom, with Assam and Genmaicha teas) - The sweet coconut complements the aromatic classic chai spices for a fascinating, multifaceted flavor profile.\\n\\n(++) Ginger Rodgers (intense ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, molasses, Thai chile, Assam black tea) - The ginger gives a strong kick, yet it all blends together so seamlessly that you paradoxically don't immediate notice the gingery-ness--it just tastes like a deliciously spicy chai. \\n\\n(++) Emmylou (lavender, chrysanthemum, chamomile, raw honey) - Magically soothing, reminiscent of the simple goodness of a warm glass of milk, only rendered sophisticated and for grown-ups.\\n\\n(+/-) King and I (woodsy, fragrant black Thai tea, cardamom, clove, anise) - I was most excited for this since I'm a fan of Thai tea, but surprisingly I liked the others much more. I think I was expecting more of the sweet condensed milk taste of Thai tea, so to me this seemed tenuous and not quite there.\\n\\n[PART II - THE DONUTS] ($4.25/6 or $6.25/12)\\n\\nMy theory for their phenomenal donuts is the freshness and the shape. You can see them pop out made-to-order from an adorable little machine. Also, the mini donuts allow for maximal crispy texture because you eat the whole thing. Add the donut hole (to the already bite-sized donuts), and you get extra surface area so it's crunchier than spherical donut holes.\\n\\n(++) Cinnamon sugar - Yup, just like cinnamon toast crunch, in epic donut form.\\n\\n(+/-) Raw honey and sea salt - A bit plain in comparison to the others; I would suggest eating this first. Also, the honey can be a bit messy.\\n\\n(++) Nutella and sea salt - Extremely satisfying like salted caramel. They add a large scoop of Nutella to the center. \\n\\n(+++) Candied bacon maple - My favorite donut! The sweet and savory synergized extremely well and added a whole new dimension to the donut.\\n\\n(++) Dirty wu (cinnamon sugar with Nutella and honey) - Million dollar question: Should they add bacon to this?! Enticing though the everything donut sounds, this popular sundae of a donut is quite satisfying with its various forms of sugar.\\n\\n(+++) Banana custard (seasonal) - The lightly sweet and fruity dollop of custard in the center reminded me of the amazingly delicious invention of filled donuts. It really tasted like fresh bananas; like all the donuts and chai here, you have no doubt that it was house-made from scratch. \\n\\nPro tips:\\n*Come with at least one other person, so that you can try literally all their donuts and chai\\n*Parking in the neighborhood isn't too bad\\n*You can try to be strategic and eat it in a certain order like you do with chocolate tastings--I recommend starting with the most plain and least sweet items\\n*They generously give one dozen free donuts within 7 days of your birthday! \\n\\nWith the tagline \\"community not competition\\", Pip's is indeed the perfect (and perfectly delicious) cozy place to hang out. The ambiance is hipster and aesthetic, with beautiful wooden tables that match the chai flight boards. Service is always efficient, friendly, and with a cheery positive attitude. \\n\\nTL;DR - A MUST-GO WHEN IN PORTLAND! Nothing like a balanced lifestyle of waterfall hikes followed by warm chai and donuts at Pip's."},{"name":"Superica","address":"99 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We found this spot by accident while riding a Lime scooter down the Beltline .

My grandfather owned and operated Margulies Fine Furnishings out of that location for many years.  I've heard stories of my mom and her 4 siblings posing in the front windows, the safe (which is still there!), all the miscellaneous contents of the basement, and my grandfather's philanthropy in helping immigrants and the underserved get their lives started.  So, needless to say, walking into a building that he had left due to increased crime, which was later turned into a video rental store, which is now beautiful, flourishing, safe, and inviting gives me a feeling of excitement and comfort.\\n\\nBut enough about me.  The Kitchen really is a great place regardless of the space it's in, but I think even without a bias the deep slate-colored paint on the original punched tin ceilings and walls, original gorgeous floors, and exposed brick are certainly notable.  Bring in some updated lighting and you've got one sweet restaurant space! \\n\\nThey do some interesting things at The Kitchen.  Tables are set up community-style and the water is self-serve from a water station. Also, it sometimes operates as a restaurant, where guests order at a counter, retrieve drinks and a number, and wait comfortably at your table while you wait for food to be delivered (much like Northstar if you've been there.)  If you feel like checking out the action in the kitchen, it's wide open.  At other times, there are cooking classes for groups. I have not been to any of these, but I have heard of company outings and girls' night etc where participants gather around for a lesson cooking a meal.  They also offer events such as yoga and cold pressed juices. I have GOT to make it to those one of these days!\\n\\nBut what I want to talk about today is this: Taco Tuesdays!  Every Tuesday, The Kitchen staff flex their creativity and bust out a clever, delicious, and innovative taco menu set to a theme.  Follow them on Facebook for a weekly laugh, even if you're busy on Tuesdays. Reading their chalkboard will make you laugh!  This week, it was an 80s mixtape.  Each taco on \\"side A\\" had a band/song name assigned to their corresponding taco.  They're clever too!  I'd never think fried tofu and broccoli stir fried would taste good in a taco shell. But yes!  I never suspected risotto would work in a tortilla. But yes!  And if you never thought fish and cooked carrots belonged in a taco, you'd be wrong.  \\n\\nI also appreciate, partially because  of the memories my mom has shared of herself in that same store, the approach they have toward families.  The place was packed with kids! There's enough of a din that my daughter's louder moments, shall we say, went unnoticed.  They had a darling old-fashioned high chair for her.  Some kids were hanging out in the waiting area playing trucks on the floor and nobody turned a head.  It just felt like, well, spending Tuesday having dinner in the family kitchen.

I had high hopes for this restaurant that left my husband and I very disappointed.\\n\\nI decided to celebrate my grad school graduation party here mostly because it was able to accommodate a large party of 50-70 guests. I had previously celebrated my undergrad graduation here in 2014 and had a positive experience that made me willing to go back. My husband and I walked into the restaurant to make the reservation and choose the dishes about one month prior to the celebration date. \\n\\nAfter asking if the restaurant was available on the specific date, the lady at the register said \\"oh, you're lucky because a previous party had that date reserved but they switched it to another date.\\" I was so happy to hear this news and was under the impression that my party would be reserved in the inner part of the restaurant (furthest away from the entrance). While the rest of the restaurant would be open to the general public for dinner dining. \\n\\nThe initial reservation was made for 5 tables of 10 people. And was assured that adding additional tables later would be no problem. I wish they would have told me to reserve the absolute minimum amount of guests prior to the event and if needed, on the day of they can add a table on the fly (with a modified menu). \\n\\nWe chose nine dishes: Fish ma soup, Crab, Honey walnut shrimp, Snow pea leaf, Salt and pepper squid, Fish fried rice, Bird nest seafood, Clams, Bo luc lac. \\n\\nAfter choosing our dishes, we asked the lady if she thought this would be good enough. Her response was, \\"This is about $325/table and the other party had about $500/table. I think it should be good.\\"  It would have been helpful if the restaurant recommended their current popular dishes. \\n\\nMy husband and I put down a deposit and left the restaurant. But we kept wondering if we should have ordered more food/different dishes because of the lady's response. But after asking my mother in law, she thought this was a sufficient menu for our guests and we decided to make no further changes. \\n\\nThree days prior to the event, my husband received a call from the restaurant. They were asking if it would be possible to move our party earlier in the day because they will be having another party coming in at 8pm. Also, if it would be alright that our party is moved towards the entrance of the restaurant. \\n\\nThis made me upset because (1) we made our reservation a month prior to, (2) we had already invited everyone with a set time and (3) we were promised the area away from the entrance of the restaurant. Out of frustration, I made another trip to the restaurant to sort things out. THIS RESTAURANT LACKS PROFESSIONALISM. And in the end I was ready to completely cancel the reservation. \\n\\nAlthough after further consideration and unwillingness to make it a bigger inconvenience for myself, family, friends and another restaurant - I decided to put my feelings aside and keep the reservation at Gold Garden. After all, they were willing to add two more tables to my party on very short notice. I wish they would have prioritized my reservation in a first come, first serve basis but instead it felt otherwise. \\n\\nWhat ultimately motivated me to write this negative review is what happened after the entire celebration. \\n\\nThe final reservation was made for 7 tables of 10 people and less than 60 guests arrived. Although this was an unforeseen event, we were still charged for ALL 7 tables. We wished that we could have not been forced to pay and take the 7th table's food to-go but rather get restaurant credit. \\n\\nI believe that the most fair situation would be for us to pay for the excess speciality dishes such as the crab, clams, etc. Although there were several other dishes that was not made yet, that could have saved us a little extra money. We ended up having to pay for the full UNOCCUPIED 7th table of food PLUS 15% gratuity (even though we didn't use/need it). \\n\\nAdditionally, we were expecting to pay about $2400 with alcohol drinks included. And they ended up over charging us by $300. Instead of planning costs around $ amount per table, it would have been helpful if a TOTAL estimated cost (+alcohol drinks, gratuity) was provided while we made the deposit during planning for the reservation. \\n\\nIn general the quality and taste of the food was on the lower end of mediocre. It is clear that this restaurant does not focus on the quality of the dishes they serve. Their overall standards have gone down tremendously since my last experience here.\\n\\nIn the end, my husband and I were very disappointed. Clear communication was lacking in this situation. Additionally, my guests also felt like the food was not up to par. I was embarrassed in choosing the Gold Garden restaurant. We will sadly never come back to the Gold Garden restaurant and strongly advise others to think twice before trying it for themselves."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We were served by Alexia and she was a delight!

My first po boy sandwich came in Vegas actually. It was a heaping good mess of catfish stuffed into a soft but crusty roll. It was the one comfort I had after eking out win particularly brutal bout of fisticuffs and getting shafted on the prize money. So the sentimentalist in me has a soft spot for po boy sandwiches. \\n\\nNow, I love living in Boston, but among the things I am not able to pick up on a whim are southern fried chicken and po boy sandwiches. Still looking for the former...but hey I'm pretty stoked about Po Boy after managing to sneak out of work early and snag a sandwich. \\n\\nThe place is just tucked away off Washington Street. It's tiny and parking is probably going to be a bit of a pain, but I'm rooting for Eric (the owner) to break out like gangbusters. After listening to him talk about his plans for Po Boy while I waited for my order, it's clear he's excited about the business and that's infectious. Oh yeah, and the sandwiches are really good.\\n\\nI ended up snagging two po boys, an oyster one for me and catfish po boy for the GF. The sandwich isn't a gigantic belly-busting monster that the Phantom Gourmet goes ga-ga over, but that suits me just fine. The batter used to fry up both of these staples had flavor and didn't outbalance the oyster or the catfish. Both sandwiches were prepped neatly and held together well enough for the GF to dive into while we commuted home. The mayo's got a nice solid bite to it that gives the sandwich character and thankfully, didn't drown any of the other sandwich parts. I'm not terribly big on ciabatta bread usually because around here, it tends to get too dough-y for me, but Po Boy's had the right amount of crunch for me.\\n\\nI gotta compliment the customer service. The guy who came in behind me asked if he could get an oyster *and* shrimp combined into one Po Boy, Eric happily filled the request without batting an eye. It left me with a bit of sandwich envy. Coming up on Po Boy's menu in the near future are muffalettas, which if you can't tell from the GF's squeals of excitement in the background, are her favorite sandwiches *ever*. \\n\\nNeedless to say, we'll be back."},{"name":"Lox, Box & Barrel","address":"9521 US Hwy 290 W, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!

A brunch spot in Portland that was worth the time and money. After eating a plethora of decent and average meals, we finally ended up dining at a restaurant that everybody really enjoyed. With all the above average reviews, Mother's Bistro and Bar was highly anticipated as we made our drive over. \\n\\nParking is once again street parking. The restaurant doesn't look big when you walk in, but there's actually other rooms besides their main dining room. Very sophisticated, classy, and whimsical feel that definitely makes you feel right at home. We had to wait for about 10-15 minutes before we were seated (for brunch on a weekday), but that was no problem at all. I felt that the tables in the main dining room seemed very close to one another and quite cramped, so I was relieved when we were seated in the next room - more spacious and breathable. \\n\\nMenu serves a variety of breakfast items - breakfast is only offered from 7 to 2:30 on Tuesdays thru Fridays and from 8 to 2:30 on the weekends. \\n\\nI ended up going simple and ordering a Belgian waffle for $7.95. This came with whipped butter and syrup on the side. Waffle was about the size of one's head, with powdered sugar dusted on top. Really enjoyed this for the decent price. Slightly crisp on the outside, but oh so fluffy and soft on the inside. Eating it with butter and syrup allowed it to have an extra kick of sweetness that I really enjoyed. I wouldn't say it's the best waffle I've had, but it's up there. \\n\\nMy sister ordered the simple two eggs, any style, where for $11.95, she got two eggs, honey-cured bacon, and pork-apple sausage or ham. While this dish was simple, it met all of my sister's expectations. This dish also came with wheat toast and potatoes, which ended up being an overall fulfilling meal. Eggs were made perfect to order - over medium with the sides slightly burnt, but she definitely enjoyed the bacon the most. The bacon that came with the dish isn't the typical bacon you'd buy at the grocery store and fry yourself. This bacon was thick and flavorful with a sweetness to the char that really shined through. Loved the crunch in each bite. We also chose the pork-apple sausage, which came separately on its own plate. Three tiny plump sausages mildly burnt, but super juicy and rich when biting into it. Explosion of flavor in each bite, really. The toast and potatoes were good, but the star of the dish were the bacon and sausage. \\n\\nWe also got Mike's Special Scramble - $11.95 for eggs scrambled with prosciutto, roasted garlic, tomatoes, basil, and provolone cheese. None of us are big scrambled eggs fans, but this was highly recommended and I can honestly see why. Lots of taste in each bite, and the little bits of prosciutto added a kick of flavor whenever you bite into it. Eggs were fluffy and not salty at all. This also came with potatoes and toast. \\n\\nWe all were big fans of the butter that came with the meal. We ended up asking the worker about how they make the butter, but I don't remember what he said. Workers were friendly and came by to help us with anything we needed. \\n\\ntl;dr - Truly a spectacular spot to try for brunch if you're in Portland. If you've had enough of the fried foods and want to get really good breakfast foods, I highly recommend Mother's. Everything we ordered was good and the price was not too bad either. Probably one of my more favorite joints that I tried while in Portland."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The best chai in the universe.

I had the lamb and it was scrumptious! The mustard seed glace was a perfect rub for the lamb. Daniel suggested a wonderful Pinot Noir that complimented both of our meals that we very much enjoyed.\\n\\nFor dessert, he had the chocolate symphony bar that had a beautiful mirror glaze and the sorbet was so refreshing!  I had the orange creme brulee. It had the perfect amount of zest and the texture was smooth and light. \\n\\nWe finished with a wonderful cappuccino and an espresso. My partner loved the cappuccino!\\n\\nThe attention to detail was spot on! It was one of the many reasons we wanted to go in the first place.

This place may be Tex-Mex but they're more authentically Mexican than some places that bill themselves as Mexican. \\n\\nI've been here both for lunch and dinner. Everything I've tried is delicious. But the main reason I'm writing this review is for the carnitas. \\n\\nOver the years, I've been threatening to tell the story of Carnitas Uruapan and the Best Carnitas I've Ever Had. Well, long story short - it's a Mexican restaurant in Tijuana that had amazing carnitas. Delicious chunks of pork, braised and then fried in lard, that were tender on the inside and insanely crispy on the outside. I haven't been since I was 13 or 14 and still I miss that place. \\n\\nSO. Several years go by and I try carnitas at oh-so-many places and am disappointed every time. Nowhere comes even close to Caranitas Uruapan. Some places use the term cavalierly and dare I say, irresponsibly, to refer to any old slow-cooked pork. I've even made them myself and while they're good, they're still no Carnitas Uruapan. \\n\\nCut to one Friday night in October. I finally get around to introducing my SO to Superica. I'm already a fan of their enchiladas and refried beans & rice. As I peruse the menu, I decide on the carnitas tacos. I'm never too hopeful as I've had my heart broken so many times in the past. But this time?\\n\\nAngels sang. The earth shook. One tiny, dignified tear left my eye.\\n\\nNow, Superica uses pork belly for their carnitas, whereas the traditional cut to use is pork shoulder. Pork belly is fattier, lending itself more easily to the crispiness that is a requirement for carnitas. Is that cheating? Maybe. Do I care? Hmm...not really. Our server was nice enough to check with the kitchen to make sure that the pork is indeed double cooked in lard. She confirmed that it was, first seasoned overnight, then braised, then fried. \\n\\nThe meat is generously portioned onto the tortillas so I ate an obscene amount of food. But it was totally worth it. These are definitely the best carnitas I've had in the US. So far. But given my past experiences, I don't see them being surpassed anytime soon.\\n\\nFood aside, I've always had good service here. I try to come here before the dinner rush so I don't experience the crazy wait times people talk about. \\n\\nIn my opinion, Superica is totally worth the hype."},{"name":"Old Thousand","address":"1000 E 11th St, Ste 150","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"For a restaurant that's only been open nine days, Old Thousand has got their proverbial poop together. We stopped in here on a Thursday night before the show, anxiously anticipating some of the dishes I've seen popping up here and on social media. I was glad to see the converted Mijo's space looking really good. Also, lots of parking is always a bonus.\\n\\nFirst, a drink! Their wine and cocktail selection is well thought out and reasonably priced (though you know I always prefer a happy hour.) Our server, Gerardo, was helpful in guiding us through the menu and we settled on entirely too many things. The crispy wontons, kung pao cauliflower, the cucumber salad, the dan dan noodles and the hot pot. Of all of those, only the cucumber salad was a miss (for us.) \\n\\nThough the crispy wontons were good, the spicy sweet sauce they're served with saves it from being boring. I loved the kung pao cauliflower - again, the sauce was complex and made the dish. Our dan dan noodles were different than what I've had in the past. A creamy sauce and an egg broken and stirred in to make it extra rich. It does come with a side of what I've termed \\"crack chile peppers\\" because holy bazoombas it was good. I was (much to my personal dismay) unable to keep myself from taking little pinches of the delightful stuff right out of the bowl. Our hot pot consisted of chinese sweet sausage, duck confit, some mushroom I couldn't identify and pork belly. And an egg, natch. You mix that whole mess together and just close your eyes and eat. \\n\\nWe got out of there with five dishes (two doggie bags) and two drinks for $75 (sans tip.) So this isn't going to be a wallet emptying night but neither will it be dirt cheap. They're doing something remarkably different and where I haven't found myself loving Wu Chow, I would definitely come back to Old Thousand."},{"name":"Zeta Bar & Sushi Lounge","address":"14100 Bonnet Creek Resort Ln","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"We were staying at the Waldorf Astoria with its staid (non-ethnic) pricey eateries, so Zeta Sushi Lounge in the adjoining Hilton was a very welcome discovery.\\n\\nCasual luxe vibe with a large bar surrounded by modern white tables.

Next up was a large red lacquer box containing jalapeno sashimi, dumplings, a large roll (we chose bonsai comprised of spicy tuna, tempura crunch and eel), seaweed salad and other goodies. When we told our friendly server Larry that we liked to try new sakes, he recommended a bottle of the Yuri Masamune \\"Beautiful Lily\\". This mellow hand crafted sake is sourced from Akita, Japan and is not widely seen in the USA. It was reasonably priced and absolutely delicious!

Note: I've had their sandwich before when my boyfriend picked these up, but it's not as fresh in my mind as it is now. We do the same buy 5, get 1 free sandwich but with the Lee's special (combination of everything). So here's the verdict:\\n\\nThe bread tastes fresher as in it's springy and the bread's exterior doesn't crumble. I mean, you could even say there's this fresh taste to the pickled carrots. Ordinarily, I'd just eat the sandwich without even slicing it in half. Since we brought it home, we sliced it ourselves and I was surprised at how pretty it looked with the layering - like the layers of meat were like a Publix sub (which are also awesome, but hey, we're talking about Asian sandwiches here). I'd also say there's less butter or grease. However, I'm also convinced that banh mi tastes better the next day after marinating in the fridge.\\n\\nI like Lee's Bakery, but I'm just too loyal to Quoc Huong. I don't care if the bread's a little older  or that it's greasier. To me, banh mi should be a dirty sandwich that tastes even better after a few days in the fridge and I'll still eat it cold. Plus, I like how Quoc Huong is much closer to the 285 exit. Call me impatient, but I just don't have the extra time to drive down miles further. But sure, if you want to pick up some Lee's banh mi, I'll still eat it."},{"name":"KFC","address":"8131 SE Powell Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"Wanted sooooo to give a good review.

This is it.  This is legit.  This is the real deal.   I've probably been to at least 100 different ramen shops.   Most in Tokyo.  This is the first to emulate the true modern Japanese style.   Jinya and Umaido does to an extent, but Okiboru isn't even in the same league.   There is no one that can touch them right now!  (I've been to every ramen shop in Atlanta and most are downright horrible and offensive). If you are a true ramen head, then this is where you want to be.   I ordered the whole menu with 2 friends (except for the vegetarian ramen and the 3 vegetarian pickled vegetable dishes) and nothing was bad!  Naoki, thanks so much for the experience!   They do a double soup here and it's masterfully blended.   Gyokai broths sometimes have the tendency to be a little too fishy, especially for western tastes.   However, theirs is a perfect blend where neither the fish, pork, or chicken isn't too strong or over powers the other flavors. Their Yuzu tsukemen reminds me of Afuri in Japan.  Their Buta Paitan tsukemen reminds me of either Michi in Tokyo or Fishtons in Osaka.  Their Tonkotsu reminds me of a lighter version of Yoshiharu in Kyoto.  My top 3 in order was the Truffle ramen, the Yuzu Chintan Tsukemen,  and the Buta Paitan tsukemen.   It wasn't easy to put them in order and I'm sure you will love anything you order there.   I hope they can keep up this quality of service and product for years to come!  If you put a gun to my head and asked for one criticism, I would have to say work on the menma.  I like mine crunchier and am a big fan of the long strands of hosaki menma. I also think the egg good be cooked for maybe 20 seconds longer.   I like them runny, but they should be at the point where they start to thicken and congeal slightly, just to give them a little more body.   Of course these are my personal preferences and not in some sort of ramen rule book, lol.  Despite that, they in no way take away from the experience!  If you are still sitting here reading this then you are doing yourself a disservice by not jumping in your car and heading on over.  Naoki, if you are reading this please consider expanding soon!\\n\\nUpdate:  I tried the 3 vegan dishes I hadn't tried earlier.   The veggie ramen is incredible.   I had to ask the waiter several times if he was sure there was no meat because the broth had so much umami.  The pickled daikon was light and refreshing.  It seems it would be great for summer.   The pickled cabbage was basically kimchee, but a little different than Korean style.   Much lighter and much sweeter."},{"name":"International Roti House","address":"3703 Covington Hwy","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"Best trini food ever I always order the buss up shot with a side of meat and pumpkin all the meats are good only thing I think they need to have is pumpkin everyday all day they usually make a few times a week and when it runs out that's"},{"name":"Le Cellier Steakhouse","address":"1510 N Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"After a week in Disney and eating in various high end restaurants.

Can't seem to stay away. Our last meal was phenomenal. We ordered the porchetta special, which included two thin slices of pork accompanied by asparagus, roasted peppers, and fried potatoes. Sheer perfection. Can't even describe quite why, because the meal was simply simple ingredients that were cooked perfectly. Luscious, real Italian food. The kind of meal I've had many times in Rome, Sienna, Florence, etc. Could eat that dish of food every single day.\\n\\nMy original review, below, explains more of why we love Parma. Five stars, no equivocation. I am going to take a moment, however, to suggest a few improvements, things that we've experienced during our dozens of visits. \\n\\n1) The flatware. For the love of all that is holy, please acquire some decent utensils. Everything else about the experience is very nice, fine dining, but the flatware is abominable. Like bad elementary school forks, knives, and spoons that have been beat to heck for a decade. (Without exaggeration, every time we've visited, at least one fork has a tine so badly bent that we have to ask for another.)\\n\\n2) The two-tops around the fireplace are way too small. We've had to put plates on the hearth, seriously. And the server seems to have no concern whatsoever about that.\\n\\n3) Don't put your bussing tubs at the front of the dining room, in full view of everyone. Kinda self-explanatory.\\n\\n4) If someone is paying $20+ for an entr√©e, don't charge extra if he wants a little extra cup of sauce.\\n\\n5) Please don't start reducing portion size. Doing so may seem economical at the moment, but will cost you in the long run. (For example, the shrimp scampi appetizer has been reduced from 5 to 4 shrimp. Might cause people not to order it anymore.)\\n\\nOriginal Review:\\nWe love this place. It has become our favorite restaurant in the greater Boulder area. Every time we go, the food, the service, and the experience are excellent. First, a few examples of the food, as follows:\\n\\nBread w/ Pesto Oil: Among the best bread we've ever had in a restaurant. So good, it could be a meal of its very own. A few slices with a glass of red wine? Perfection. And the accompanying pesto oil is fantastic.\\n\\nVongole: The sweetest little clams, in a white wine and garlic broth. Can't get enough of them.\\n\\nScampi: Excellent. Big, meaty, flavorful shrimp. So many places add too much garlic, such that the garlic overwhelms, but the Parma version allows the shrimp to shine, with only a hint of fresh garlic nicely accenting. And the olive oil-garlic sauce itself is so good that we always consume nearly every last drop (finishing it with the wonderful bread).\\n\\nPolpette: Best meatballs in Colorado. Perfect texture, perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked. And the accompanying sugo is delicious.\\n\\nPolenta w/ Gorgonzola Cream Sauce: Very good. The cream sauce has a wonderfully subtle flavor. My only quibble is that the polenta (which is good) is a bit lost under the ridiculously good richness of the sauce. (Suggestion? Twice the polenta, half the sauce.) But we will order this again, gladly.\\n\\nCalamari: Excellent. Only very slightly breaded, cooked perfectly so that it is perfectly tender, and served piping hot. Best fried calamari we've had in quite a while.\\n\\nPanzarotti: The best fried ravioli we've ever had. Stuffed with excellent mozzarella. But, oddly, we probably wouldn't order it again, only because it seems a bit unrefined and jarring compared to the simple elegance of the other food. (Unrefined by its nature, through no fault of Parma's.)\\n\\nAs for other aspects of the place. The wine list is nice, with a surprisingly wide range of offerings for only $7 and $8 per glass. One in particular, a Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, seems perfectly suited to much of Parma's menu. (I'm using the word perfect a lot, aren't I?) Service is always good, and sometimes excellent. No disgruntled millenials, not that we've come across (unlike most places in the general area). The atmosphere is pleasant, the place smells decadently good. And there is always a nice energy, probably because patrons are so happy to be there.\\n\\nWe are always pleased to see the place packed with people, because hopefully that means Parma will be around for a very long time."},{"name":"Yaletown Brewing Company","address":"1111 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"A lovely spot in Yaletown as they also have the patio in the summer but they serve food at Yaletown prices which taste way below par. \\n\\nBBQ chicken pizza was average and service was a bit lacklustre.

Meaning, I like the restaurant. And there's a bar too - nice (not many Chinese places can claim to have a bar in town).\\n\\nBut the food... geez, beware of the spiciness of the food. If I was rating the food base on the appropriate spiciness level, this would easily be a one star review. But I'm giving it four stars anyways because the quality of the food is really great - I'm just needing to remind them to make it extremely mild if the standard is fire-hot. I'm just suspecting that someone who is at the helm of the kitchen had his tongue burnt from eating too spicy food for far too long, unfortunately.\\n\\nI'd give this place another try. Also, a good and fun find for those vegans - first Tuesdays every month is their special vegan prix-fixe menu.

Billed as a rooftop bar it's technically not rooftop although it is pretty cool. Artificial turf, yard games, open air and indoor seating available. Nice Square size bar in the middle with service on any side. There's also table service although at happy hour on a Friday it seemed like it was a better option to order from the bar. Cool snacks available and we were able to get the fried flour tortilla chips along with a creamy bean dip that really hit the spot. Great white Sangria was quite tasty on a humid hot evening. Good prices on the tall boy beers at $5. Mostly very good service except for one Sourpuss server who seemed very unhappy to be working there. I even spotted her telling a customer to move her chair out of the aisle because she was in her way. She never smiled and really strutted around acting pissed off about the world.

My (Spanish) friend and I came in at around 8pm and it was busy as usual.  The less than friendly hostess (a short girl with blonde ponytail) told us that it would be a 45-minute wait.  Now, one of the cool things about PB is that they have communal seating in the larger tables and sure enough, the large horizontal table by the front window had a family but the last 3 seats of the long table by the door were empty.   I asked the hostess if we could sit down in two of those 3 empty seats and she said No because she didn't want to \\"crowd the family already there\\" Keep in mind that we have been seated at this very table with a mixed group of people on numerous occasions in the past, so I gently questioned her about this strange (to me) statement.   The hostess replied that she had gotten in trouble in the past by seating strangers in the same table and so she would not do it.   She told us to go stand by the bar and we could wait for 2 seats at the bar to open up.   We proceeded to do just that, however, 5 minutes later two blond drunk girls came stumbling over to the empty seats at the long table asked the family that was eating if they could sit down and of course they said yes, so they sat.  This all happened right in front of us as we were still standing over in a corner as we had been told to do.        When the hostess walked by I pointed to the girls at the table and asked her why they were allowed to sit there and we weren't?  She rolled her eyes at me huffed a few times and went storming into the back where I saw her talking to the owner (Tall guy with a beard).    The guy proceeds to charge over to where I'm standing just a few feet away, still by the bar, and immediately gets in my face angrily and accuses me of \\"trying to hustle his clients away from their table\\" *this is an exact quote by the way.   I try to tell him that he must not understand what just happened and please let me tell him, and he interrupts me again and tells me he doesn't need this....at this point, I am angry, confused and frankly hurt that he didn't even allow me to tell him what really had happened. So my reply was that his food was good, but not worth all this rudeness especially when I have been a frequent customer of his since he opened up.   I left and took my brown Hispanic friend with me.   Moral of this story is IF you're going to Pizza Bruno's bring a white friend because this was so obviously a racist incident.   There was NO reason why WE were denied being allowed to site at a communal table but two drunk white girls were.   I can only believe that the hostess told the owner WE were being the problem and instead of asking like a professional, he took his employees word and immediately attacked us.   Here is the thing, after I calmed down I started estimating how much $$ I and all the people that I have introduced to PB in the last 6 months alone brought into this restaurant on a weekly basis.  6-8 people eating there at least 1 a week averages at least $200 a week x 4 wks in a month =$800 a month since they opened.    I have systematically called everyone that I know over the weekend and told them what happened.  I have asked them not to frequent this RACIST & RUDE establishment especially when there are so many other restaurants nearby who want our money.   I will copy and paste this warning on EVERY social media site that I had previously left a positive review on.   I think it's only fair that the public is warned that if you are anything less than blonde you probably should NOT go to Pizza Brunos as you won't be treated very well...:("},{"name":"Euphoria","address":"8000 Fins Up Cir","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"The atmosphere was nice but the meal was disappointing.

It was easy to convince me to try a new place...mediocre sushi in Vancouver is the equivalent of really good sushi in Seattle...so it's hard to go wrong here.\\n\\nHOWEVER - having the privilege of spending more time in Vancouver has spoiled me.  Where OK Van sushi would have kicked butt before, I now have higher expectations.\\n\\nWhich finally brings us to Kitaya, whose claim to fame is 19 pieces of sushi for $5.95.  That's a good deal if you're into the maki it features - California roll, Spider roll, etc.  But the ratio of rice to fish is pretty high (understandably) on this budget maki.\\n\\nI would rather spend a little more and get a more substantial chirashi zushi than I received here.  The cuts of fish were of decent quality...but very thin.  Those at our table that got tekka don also found their dishes \\"adequate\\" but not great.  Often tekka don will be chopped tuna with negima (green onion) sprinkled on top.  Kitaya's is slices of sashimi on regular rice, not sumeshi (sushi rice).  This may suit you, but our family prefers the former.\\n\\nMy son liked his salmon/tuna sushi/maki combo.  But - he would be able to find this many places  in Vancouver at about the same price point and quality, if not better.\\n\\nIf you're constrained to the Robson/Denman/Davie area - this is ok.

This review is about how one restaurant gracefully and professionally gained a patron for life.\\n\\nIt was my first visit to Ray's.  The vibe reminds me of a few restaurants in San Diego like The Marine Room, The Chart House in Cardiff-by-the-Sea, and a few other ocean front places....  nice, open, great views, etc.  but the view is that of the Chattahoochee River.  As the sun set through the trees I was compelled to snap a few photos.  The Canadian goose was feeding on the lawn next to the flowing water and the trees were mostly bare with a few signs that Spring is on its way.  \\n\\nAhhhhh, I was ready for some wine and good seafood.  We ordered the Argentinian Malbec and a wedge salad and decided to chat for a while.  I attempted to pull up my chair by grabbing the bottom and scooting up.  When I did that, it felt as if a tiny piranha stabbed my middle finger with his 2 inch filet knife-like teeth.  It hurt so bad I wanted to scream all the nasty four letter words I knew and try to hit that goose by launching the chair through the glass window.  But, being from and in the South, I simply said, \\"Ouch, that really hurt\\" in a quiet tone.  \\n\\nBlood dripped down my hand and it was gonna need a band-aid.  Our server was close by and we summoned her for some assistance.  This is where I want you to pay attention.  She did EVERYTHING RIGHT.  \\n\\nShe said, \\"Oh I'm so sorry that happened, are you ok?\\"  \\nShe then said, \\"Let me get you a band-aid.  Do you need anything else?\\"\\nShe then said, \\"I will also get my manager to come over right away.\\"\\nShe then said, \\"We will remove this chair and get you another.\\"\\n\\nSo within one minute of this happening, I felt cared for and I felt like they took this seriously.  Now some of you cynics are gonna say, \\"Yea but they just don't want to get sued\\" however, I disagree.  My feeling was that they had a procedure and they executed it but more importantly, they cared. \\n\\nHand washed, band-aids applied,  the manager visited the table.  He asked if I was ok, offered the most sincere apology, told me he saw a staple on the bottom of the chair and would be taking that one out of service.  He also asked me if he could give us dessert because after all, what dessert doesn't fix, I don't know what could. Again, he did EVERYTHING RIGHT.  \\n\\nSo, feeling not too great, but great, we drank our delicious wine, ate our wasabi encrusted black grouper, salmon oscar, brussel sprouts, wedge salad and tried to consume our creme brulee and warm brownie with vanilla ice cream.  The food, by the way, is spectacular!  \\n\\nI will be back again and again not only for the food, but because this is a place I know I will be taken care of.  In this day of crappy customer service, I vow to only give my hard earned cash to places that care to have it.  :)"},{"name":"Buckeye Pho","address":"761 Bethel Rd, Ste E195","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"With my new Pho addiction, I decided to try out this place on the recommendation of a friend. \\n\\nI liked the feel of the place.

There is a direct entrance from the outside as well.\\n\\nOn a whim on a weekend, a table for 2 didn't take too long.  Though it may have been because it was Sunday... Superica starts you off with complimentary chips and salsas (2 types).  One was green and refreshing while the other salsa had more of a smoky tomato type of salsa.  Both were pretty appetizing and tasted fresh to make up for the chips that were a bit bland.  Though it wasn't to the degree that I had to pour a whole canister of salt on it, which I saw someone do, and couldn't help myself to smile =)\\n\\nFor our entrees, we chose the highlighted dishes that was recommended on Yelp.  I ordered the chile relleno and my friend ordered the Al pastor, pork belly tacos.  I actually liked the ingridents and flavor of the tacos, but the tortilla was dry and not good.  My chili relleno was a bit lacking as well.  Anything smothered in cheese is great and the pepper and filling tasted good, except the corn.  I love corn, but in this dish, it felt like an after thought and they just added it in as fillers.  If it was cooked first and added, I think it would enhance the dish by 100%.  Otherwise, I felt like I was eating corn from the can.  Oh, and they also bring you Spanish rice and beans as complimentary with your dishes, which weren't too bad as well.\\n\\n\\nOverall, thought the dishes on their menu were overpriced for what they had to offer.  \\n\\nOh, so on Yelp, there was many reviews to check out the bathroom.

AYCE Korean BBQ, Sushi, And other Japanese and Korean delectables. No time limit( this is all for dinner) and for $31CAD( about $23.5 USD) this place was amazing! \\n\\nThe decor is absolutely adorable, with some larger tables are actual boats along with regular seating. All tables of course have a grill, theirs is gas and not charcoal if that matters to you, I don't mind/ care haha. Been twice now and the staff seems to be hit or miss. One night everyone was friendly and efficient, next day cold and kinda rude so that's the only iffy thing.Now the food... Wow.\\n\\nFor an AYCE place I usually expect meh food but this was delicious. I 1000% recommended all the BBQ meats, they were awesome. The most tender  or highest quanah, but delicious you bet! There is a learning curve as you cook everything yourself with no demo which can be slightly challenging to first timers but you cook everything to your  own personal doneness which is the best! My recommendations\\nSpicy Pork\\nBeef short rib\\nLamb something haha\\nChicken\\nBasically any barbecue meat\\nKarate style chicken wings\\nSpicy fried Gyoza\\nChicken Teriyaki \\nSpicy shrimp cone\\nSpicy Tuna roll\\nTempura Potato \\nWe're all absolutely phenomenal! Our other food was delicious as well but those are must tries in my opinion. The only thing I would say skip is spring rolls and I believe beef teriyaki, not that great or bland.

Each bite was packed with sweet flavor. I have a huge sweet tooth so the sweetness was totally fine for me but I can see how it can be a lot for others. \\n\\nIf you're not feeling a cannoli they also have mixtures of large brownies, boston cream pie, tiramisu, etc for purchase ranging between $3.50 a slice or more. \\n\\nThere's not really a line system so you kind of line up in front of a person behind the counter and see if they call you.

The second, recent, visit was preceded by a phone call I made to see what pies would be available if I got there late in the day on a weekday. The male staff member was very nice and gave me a straight forward answer (which was: if you need something specific, order it 48 hours in advance. however, popular pies will likely still be available, like the cherry, but probably only in large sizes). \\n\\nI was looking for the cherry crumb pie so I was relieved to see there were two large cherry pies available at 5:30 pm on a Tuesday. The girl who helped me was very patient and kind to answer my question, realistically, about how many people it would feed. I believe their website says that a large pie feeds 6-8 people, but that is with a generous slice. I was able to feed about 10 people with the pie, but they were not massive pieces. I chose to by a small mixed berry pie, just in case there wasn't enough. Needless to say, we killed the pie. The cherry pie was amazing. \\n\\nIt's expensive (approx $25) for a large pie but it's worth the random splurge. While I was there, I also picked up a Mixed Berry Cutie Pie for my husband and some kind of chocolate fudge macaroon with coconut and nuts. mmmm oh my god. very yummy.

Although my friend and I came here at an awkward time between their lunch and dinner services so the dishes available were limited to only sandwiches, salads, and happy hour menus, we were very satisfied with our late late lunch.\\n\\nStarting at 3pm, we ordered a couple of the happy hour menus, namely the Roasted Pork Quesadilla, the Salmon Rillette, and the Fried Ricotta Ravioli. All three dishes were delectable!\\n\\nMy favorite dish out of the three dishes was the Salmon Rillette. Have not had a \\"rillette\\" before I was pleasantly surprised by what we got. The buttery butterfly crackers went super well with the salmon rillette that was made refreshing with dill and mayo. I highly reccommended this dish.\\n\\nThe Roasted Pork Quesadilla was warm and hearty. The pork was melt-in-the-mouth tender and well-seasoned. I thought the dish was a really cool idea and nicely executed. The soft meat paired well with the crispy tortillas and melty cheese! Although some salsa could have accompanied the dish, adding the missing acidity that would match well with the saltiness of the dish.\\n\\nIn contrast to the two dishes above, the Fried Ricotta Ravioli was a little bit of a let down. The name certainly made my mouth watered, but the dish made did not do it for me. Although fried, the ravioli were not crispy. In fact, they were doughy and cold. The cajun spieces didn't stand out and there was barely any riocotta fillings in them. The flavor profile was also rather lackluster.\\n\\nWith our food, we also split a Ruby Cocktail that tasted mainly of grapefruit and other citrus fruits. It was a very nice, refreshing addition to our meal! We also got two complementary cookies from the bakery that were very delicious and rounded off our meal on a sweet note.\\n\\nIn addition to the food, the service here was also amazing.

I came on a Thursday evening with two of my girlfriends for dinner. It's not small, it's dim and sexy, and it's \\"buzzing\\" with people at the bar and dining areas.

I personally that is the best. I want to enjoy my dinner and company and don't like being rushed. \\n\\nTHE FOOD\\nThe 3 of us were advised to order 2-3 dishes per person.

Anyway, the place is setup as a sort of basement restaurant, with archways in the stonework. You know, like a cellar.

I went with the rib-eye steak, but was saddened that the PEI mussels were not on the menu at the time... I understand that it is a seasonal item on the menu. Ah well. \\n\\nThe first thing to come out was a bread platter, which I knew would come with a description of where the bread comes from and its history. It is really nice to hear things about the food that you are about to eat and where they come from... it gives the food more aura. \\n\\nWe also had a couple of appetizers, including both poutines and a bowl of the cheddar cheese soup. All of those were excellent, and I would go for both without issue.\\n\\nThen came the main courses.

So there are no gluten free options at this establishment other than a salad which is a big concern to me in this day and age. The waiter in particular was not only unhelpful, he almost poisoned my grandmother. My grandmother has Celiac's disease meaning its utter chaos in her body if she eats gluten. When asking if there were gluten free options the waitor pointed to the meatball, which is in fact NOT GLUTEN FREE because they use breadcrumbs to keep the ball together (which one would know if they have made meatballs but they may forget) I had to inform him of this and have him ask the chef if there are indeed bread crumbs (yes there are). My point here is: no it is definitely not his fault that the only option was salad, but that he should not recommend an item without knowing 100% that it is free of the allergen. Had it been something that causes anaphylaxis and it was not caught that would not fly homeboy.

However, I have never seen any customer ordering from the a la carte menu.  Further, I strongly urge you to order the Chef's Tasting Menu because it is simply out of this world! The Chef's Tasting Menu is a 9-course meal that starts from Russian traditional finger foods to some dessert. The menu changes often due to their accommodation with seasonal items. Sadly, the price of luxury doesn't come cheap. The Chef's Tasting Menu costs nearly $100, if you don't pair it with wine.

Once we got there, I asked if I could have my order (spicy salmon sashimi and salmon maki roll) for dine-in instead. Now there were plenty of empty tables since we had taken a later lunch. I understand that the restaurant is usually busy as I have waited up to 30 minutes for a table in the past. This specific day, however, it was not as busy. The woman helping us said we could not dine-in. We were annoyed so my coworker just ordered her lunch for take out. \\n\\nAfter waiting 20 minutes for one additional roll, we decided to eat in the car since we were so hungry.

I told her I had dined there the day before and many other times and my order always consisted of spicy salmon sashimi, not regular sashimi! I asked if I could just get the spicy sauce on the side. She called over an older woman who looked at me with an apologetic look on her face and said \\"sorry, you ordered regular sashimi.\\" That's when I told her I didn't want it and she could just refund my money instead. Obviously not wanting to do that, she told me she would get me spicy salmon sashimi instead. She took it to the back (not the sushi bar) and I could see the chefs looking over at her and laughing and then looking over at me. Now this was 3 different chefs that did this. I was convinced she was not doing something right and I was getting uncomfortable with the situation. When she walked out, the chefs were saying something to her in Korean (fyi, this is not authentic Japanese sushi). She handed me my order without apologizing and I left vowing to never return here again. \\n\\nWhen we got back to the office and shared what had just happened with our coworkers, we were instantly bombarded with stories of bad service and were recommended other sushi restaurants in the area, which I will check out soon.

(This included green chiles in the obvious - enchiladas - and in chilaquiles, pizza, mashed potatoes, cornbread, and more.\\n\\nThat said, we had high hopes for Santo and we were disappointed by the lack of green chile flavor.\\n\\nThe best deal here are the happy hour specials that end at 6. Sometimes those have been our favorite dishes. Our first visit we had the tortilla espanola with asparagus. I thought it was good but bland. The husband liked it. The server asked if we wanted a sampler of all three salsas when we hesitated on what salsa to order for the chips and salsa. I was surprised at the portion size of chips and large portions of each salsa. The bill came and I saw we were charged for each salsa. (I thought he was bringing some of each salsa in lieu of one whole salsa.) At least it was $1.30 each during happy hour so I can complain too much.\\n\\nThat visit we also ordered the duck sopes with duck confit, watermelon radish, and black beans. It had good duck flavor. We had great expectations for the blue corn enchiladas but there was very little green chile. It actually reminded me a little of pizza - or maybe it was the melted cheese appearance. The cilantro rice was nothing special, but I did like the smokiness of the black beans on the side.\\n\\nWe ended our meal with the sopaipillas and found them on par with Green Chile Kitchen. I liked that they used wildflower honey.\\n\\nOn our second visit we forgot about happy hour, but happily we arrived before it ended. Again we ordered the chips and salsa, remembering this time to only get one salsa. Unfortunately we ordered badly and got the pineapple one. We didn't realize it wouldn't have a tomato base and that's really what we wanted. The big winner was the $3 chicken adovada tacos. They were flavorful and overful with meat. Really good.\\n\\nWe liked our red chile pozole which tasted authentic and had good flavors. It was spicy so I wished there was more starch to go with it than just one small tortilla. (And let's discuss the tortilla. Flour? Really?)\\n\\nAnd then there was the short rib. I suspect that this is a place where you do better (food-wise and price-wise) by sticking to the appetizers and smaller dishes. I know there were blue corn grits but I really didn't taste any New Mexican flavors in this dish. The beef was tender but reminded me of my mom's Middle America pot roast. It wasn't worth the price. I came here for New Mexican food.\\n\\nI wish we'd gotten the warm cookie topped with ice cream recommended by our awesome and personable server, Ethan. Instead, I let the husband choose the apple green chile crisp. The flavors were odd together and we couldn't decide if we liked it. (And yes, I have seen these flavors together before, but just hadn't tried them.) Clearly if you have to debate if you like a dessert you should have ordered something else.\\n\\n(For the person in the Yelp reviews who suggested Zolo Grill, I just want to say that we checked it out a few years ago and my notes say that the green salsa there was disappointing.)\\n\\nI say 4, husband says 3 stars"},{"name":"Disney Springs","address":"1486 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Not exactly baby friendly.

Hush puppies were 4 to an order at $1.25 and had no dipping sauce, but I just dunked them in the leftover spicy sauce from the crawfish pot.  The crawfish themselves were fresh, juicy, well cooked and nicely spiced.  Most of them were pretty good sized, and a few were even worth bothering with the claw meat for.  The corn was tasty as were the potatoes, mushrooms and sausage as well.  Some of the best crawfish I've had, and I'd definitely come back for more.  Not sure how the price compares, as most other times I've eaten crawfish other than Sam's Boat, it was at an event or backyard setting.  I paid $20 for my 2lb pot with an order of hush puppies and just water to drink.  \\n\\nThe only thing keeping it from a 5 star review, was that the place just felt grimy from before we walked in, to the dining area, and when I went to wash my hands in the bathroom.

Once our dessert came I took a photo of it and placed my phone on the table. I got up to go to the bathroom and my family left the table. We must of been gone from the table no more than 5 minutes when I realized none of them had retrieved my phone from the table. When we returned the table was missing the dessert plate, my phone and the bill. We asked the busboys that were present (2 of them) if they had seen the phone. According to them neither of them had seen it and neither did the waitress. She nervously began to look through the menus for the phone, which made no sense since we did not have the menu on our table by the time the dessert had arrived. No one at the restaurant could help us with this issue instead they referred us to the Guest Services of City Walk, stating that all missing items get reported there, mind you it had only been no more than 10 minutes at this time. My \\"find my phone\\" application detected my phone being at the location of the Toothsome Chocolate Factory Restaurant. Even after telling them that someone had stolen my phone from the table, no management showed up even after asking to speak to them. I had to leave my husband and son at the location while I walked to Guest Services. Security returned with me to the location, no one was questioned, neither the busboys or the waitress. Mind you the napkins and the cups were still at the table but the dessert plate, bill and phone were removed. Everyone kept treating us as I didn't know where I had left the phone. Unbelievable!!! \\n\\nMind you no one could look at the cameras, according to Toothsome they do not have access and according to Guest Services, Toothsome does have access because they are a private company. Then after making a big fuss to the Security he claimed that they could access the cameras but only after everyone leaves the premises.  My \\"find my phone\\" app the next morning still showed my phone at the premises. I went back the next morning in hopes that the crooked employee that stole my phone would had returned it but instead I was greeted by another employee that apparently rehearsed the SAME story telling me that there was no phone and everything would be at Guest Services but the employee did not even bother to look for it at the location. Again I walked to Guest Services and nothing!!! I should of called the police to have them do an investigation since it is apparent that neither Toothsome or Guest Services could deal with this situation and they could not question their criminal employees! This has been my WORST experience EVER! Unbelievable that no management was present that would of been able to deal with this or even acknowledge what was going on! This was not a matter of a lost item but a stolen one and everyone would just turn their face and continue upon their business. Until my phone died at 3pm yesterday my \\"find my phone\\" app still showed my phone at the Toothsome location!!\\n\\n No one took the time or care to assist me in locating my phone and everyone brushed it off as if it was not important. Until today I'm not even sure if there was a manager in the location because after asking several people to speak to a manager no one came forward to deal with this.

My husband felt put to shame by his ease of being able to play so wonderfully and hold the conversation he was having with a nearby table.\\nTo the other side of us was a grand fireplace, and an amazing seating area next to it that was set into the ground with a luxurious looking black leather sofa. We were impressed.\\n\\nThe menu choices were simple, and my husband settled on the $10 burger and fries, while the $15 Grilled Chicken Penne caught my eye. I'm still not sure whether it was the description of the food or the high price that did the catching, though.\\n\\nEither way, we were both excited to try their food. The waiter was friendly and attentive, and soon brought me a blackberry cream soda that I was insanely eager to drink down. After one sip of this hand made drink creation, I quickly slid the glass to the very far end of the table, getting it away from me as quickly as I could. The pink coloring of the drink fooled me... it tasted like pure soda water with whip cream on top. I couldn't get myself to drink the rest of it, which I felt terrible about. I always have a hard time letting waiters know if I don't like something, and I feel even worse asking them to take it back. But after my husband's attempt at the drink, he spit it back out and the words that spilled out of his mouth reassured me that I direly needed to exchange it for a Coke instead.\\n\\nOur dinner arrived and it looked incredible! This, again, fooled us. My penne noodles tasted overly tart and vinegary and was incredibly dry (emphasis on the DRY), and the chicken was VERY much tasteless. I was crushed. I knew I should have gone with the $4 chicken pot pie on the happy hour menu. Oh well.\\nMy husband's burger was just a burger on a bun. No seasonings or spices to flair your senses, and the grease that literally poured down in chunks onto the plate didn't serve our appetites well. Disgusting. The fries, however, were really tasty!\\n\\nI can't say that we won't go back to try other items from the menu in hopes that the taste-experience will be better, but that's a pretty long shot away. We were both incredibly disappointed in that department. Especially after we got the hefty bill to cover the food we hated.\\n\\nIn the mean-time, we'll be sticking to our superb movie-going experiences there!!"},{"name":"Timbertrain Coffee Roasters","address":"311 W Cordova Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Holy s**t, a single cup of coffee that takes 45 minutes from when you order it to when it's served.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, it's good coffee, but I don't know if ANY coffee is worth that kind of wait.\\n\\nWith that said, it was fascinating to watch people who are THAT into their craft do their thing.

Each time I am there, the employees will ask me if I need help...they can pick up when I am unsure about a choice.  The check out crew will suggest discounts or coupons I may have missed.

I could literally eat this every meal as long as it's injected with plenty of Sriracha and I have my handy plastic ladle spoon & chopsticks. In moving to Ohio last summer, one of my biggest concerns was where I would get my Vietnamese soup fix. Of course, that was high on the agenda for consulting Yelp upon arrival and I had several local options to try. And I've tried about 4 or 5 different spots, and I keep going back to Buckeye.\\nHonestly, my first impressions of Columbus--everything was Buckeye something or rather--riding on the coattails of the University's fandom. Should I even try this spot--it doesn't sound authentic?!  I found myself close to Bethel Road with a craving, so on my tour of Columbus pho, I stopped in. \\nI'm very simple in my pho order. Big bowl'o pho tai. And sometime an aside of shrimp or tofu summer rolls. The herbs and sprouts are fresh and fragrant and the broth is yummy goodness. The steak is shaved thin and not fatty or gristly. (And when you get take out--it's on the side so it's not well-done and rubbery when you arrive home!) They aren't skimpy on anything--good portion of meat, veggies & rice noodles.\\nTo me, pho always makes everything better.

This restaurant is nicely tucked into the street and surrounded by a quaint little forest, making it stand out a little bit if you're just walking by the streets. It's actually quite the nice little place and the exterior decor is fairly cute. Inside is well lit and actually quite spacious as well. They seem to be quite accommodating to large parties, so thats a plus for them. However, that is sort of where I may need to cut the compliments. Food wise, they are alright. I don't think there is much to say about BBQ'ing your own meat that you wouldn't expect. raw meet is raw meat. As for some of the other dishes I tried, they don't necessarily stand out for the costs of the plates. What did get to me a little was the knowledge of their servers. They weren't bad, but it was always difficult to way over a server and even after we did, it took 3 more of them to really figure out what was written in Korean about their combos and how we could have split them between 2 grills cause we had a large party. \\nSolid 2.5"},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great place to go for dessert.

The mussels in cumin sauce were some of the best mussels that we've had.  The sauce was delicious.  My husband ended up scooping up the sauce with a spoon and eating it like soup after the mussels were all gone.  The lobster tail in garlic butter and peppercorn sauce.  This is the one dish that seemed to be a regular size serving.  With and 11 course menu most of the items are tapas size.  The lobster tail was so tender and tasty.  We licked the shells and there was so much flavour.  The  carmelized ginger seabass was amazing.  The skin was so nice and crisp but the fish itself was so smooth and flakey.  It was melt in your mouth tender and not overcooked. The dessert of deep fried banana with ice cream was a great way to end a wonderful meal.

We were very excited to eat here after several universal employees recommended this restaurant. \\nTo begin, we waited an hour and a half to be seated then additional hour to get our food. Our waiter was very nice and accommodating considering the mounting frustration of what was to come. We came as a group of seven. Two of us ordered the braised short rib. Let's begin with that debacle. The short rib was ice cold and the portion was the size of a child's palm. My hb tasted it and it was over cooked and dry. That was sent back. Then my sister ordered the Mac and cheese. The dish was cold and gross. That was sent back. I ordered brunch all day which was crepes with berries. The four crepes were the size of a dollar bill. The smallest portion size I've ever seen. \\nSo now we are so annoyed, hungry and upset. A women comes to the table claiming to be a manager and pretends to care that we are upset. The truth is she was not a manager and she wouldn't speak to us after we decided to put for the food we ate. We only ate a salad and a soup. The so called manager was only a captain and in good faith you think we would have received at least a comped drink. Nope. And she has the nerve to charge the 18% gratuity on the original bill. \\nAt least we were not alone as we heard multiple surrounding tables complaining. \\nThanks for allowing us to vent.

The last time I went was two years ago when I experienced their Sunday brunch buffet, which I thought was excellent. Last evening, four of my buds and I decided we would stop by for happy hour. We sat in the bar area which is kinda small and was half empty. So Ray's has a happy hour menu with about five half-priced appetizers on it. They were all $5. Why I can't remember all five items is beyond me, but fried green tomatoes, calamari, and bbq shrimp were three of the options. Anyway, they also had five or six $5 martinis available as well. \\n\\nI ordered a house salad, the calamari and crab bisque. The house salad was $7 and on the main menu (in the app section, I believe) and was a delicious blend of spring mix, arugula, bleu cheese, dried cranberries, and pecans with a balsamic vinegarette. DELISH! and sizable. It really could have been shared between two people. The calamari was just okay. Years ago, I had crowned Ray's the winner of the Best Calamari award. But, no, no, not anymore. I seem to remember that in days past, they served the calamari with something other than fried hot peppers and with a sauce that was kinda mustardy. Last night, it was just the standard old marinara. Uh uh. \\n\\nOh but, the bisque! The crab bisque was freakin delightful. There is no classy, ladylike way to to sop something up, but let me tell you, I racked my brain for one last night. The cup (my mind said ramekin) in which the bisque was served was super small, but the the chunks of crab in the bisque were divine. A good choice if you go here. I did taste the bbq shrimp too. It was served over a grit patty...interesting (btw, when someone says something is interesting, it could be good OR bad) and in some sauce that didn't taste like bbq, but made me think of curry for some reason. Whatever. Nothing I would order for myself. \\n\\nGoing to Ray's on the River reminded me that I need to partake in dinner with them again and enjoy the Sunday brunch again. The restaurant is a beauty and the river sparkled. It has a romantic feel to it. Oh and you'd better be dressed appropriately (business casual) as I heard them refuse to seat a man in the main dining area because he had on a rinky dink, old t-shirt. \\n\\nService was awesome. Our server was attentive and courteous throughout our visit.  \\n\\nI think I want to enjoy happy hour in a more upbeat, outrageous setting when I'm with my girls.

It's a highly popular bakery along Hanover St. whose reputation precedes itself and because of that, tourists and out-of-towners will continue to flock to this iconic establishment with lines out the door most summer and weekend nights. Unfortunately, this means that they will be able to charge whatever amount they wish for their goods and people will pay those high inflated prices.\\n\\nAs a 5+ year resident of the North End, I've seen my favorite item from them (Berry Tart) go up in price from $4 and change to $6.75: the price I just paid tonight! Yikes, that is quite the spike!\\n\\n$7 for one individual sized-pastry is pretty ridiculous. Again, when you're a tourist trap, you can get away with these exorbitant prices. \\n\\nAs a local, I think I'll stick to the other pastry shop in the neighborhood that the locals frequent (and doesn't charge a premium for their baked goods). See my review of them in my North End establishment list.\\n\\nBe ready to pony up the cash (make sure you have cash, they don't take card) when you come here. Are the desserts here good? Absolutely! Standouts for me here are the Berry Tart, pistachio macaroons, and truffles. Unlike most, I am not a fan of their cannoli but don't take my word for it. I seem to be in the minority with that opinion. \\n\\nIf you have time, I do recommend sitting in cafe for sit-down service.

Recognized numerous times as one of the best restaurants in Portland, for me, Mother's is all about brunch (oh, and lunch and dinner too!).  Lisa makes divine food.  The service is always above par.  The wait is oppressive, and if you get rude about it, you'll pay dearly by waiting even longer.  \\n\\nWhy have I been going here for so many years on a regular basis? Well, the food is just that good.  The eggs are rich and creamy. The quality and flavor are consistent.  The ingredients are sinful. The food is comfort.\\n\\nAmazing Migas, great frittatas, excellent gourmet pancakes and waffles, fantastic matzoh ball soup, great mac n cheese (the saucy kind, not the baked kind), meatloaf to die for, biscuits and gravy that will make you smile even as your heart stops, french toast dipped in corn-flakes and fried crispy... I could go on gushing over the food at this place.  \\n\\nEven though I may be colored by the fact that I am treated by family here, I had to work up to it.  My wife and I spent many, many hours waiting here for brunch before we got \\"in\\" with the staff.  We did it simply because the food is so damn good. Their philosophy is to treat family like family, because it's family that matters most.  I appreciate that.

No, I'm not a golfer. The great thing about Topgolf though is that you don't have to be one to have a memorable experience. \\n\\nThe space is truly something else. A marvel in size, scope and design. It's more like a golf-resort-sports-bar-restaurant-entertainment-club on steroids. Let's just say you can hit your daily step goal here.\\n\\nI suggest making a reservation if you plan to utilize the driving range. We made one for 7:30pm on a Friday night and were pushed back nearly an hour and a half. The only reason why we weren't super upset was because we were able to land a table for 7 near the bar almost instantaneously, and we were extremely hungry.\\n\\nTo be honest, my expectations were low when it came to the food options. Contrary to my initial thoughts, Topgolf has elevated the food and beverage program in comparison to the stereotypical sports bar. Mostly everything we had was solid, including the wings, bacon mac rolls, and the 40 oz. burger.\\n\\nThe 40 oz. burger was a sight for sore eyes. At $29 it's a total steal. It was my friend's bachelor weekend, so everything in excess was had. Shockingly, the burger remained juicy throughout. It also comes with two pounds of fries and a bunch of pickles. Hot damn!\\n\\nPart of the reason our reservation was pushed back was due to a private party on the 3rd floor. Once it ended, we made our way up there. At each \\"lane\\" you are provided with a server, who will take your food and drink orders. There are couches and TV's, what else do you need?\\n\\nGolf-wise, it was a lot of fun.

The customer service was fantastic during our short stay. When we arrived to check in at 4 pm, our room wasn't ready yet, which was not ok. The front desk assured me it will be ready soon (it took 30 minutes), and that she would offer us complimentary breakfast buffet vouchers for the inconvenience. Score! I love breakfast. She was also going to give us drink vouchers, since I asked if we could wait in the lobby until our room was ready. I declined this offer, since we don't drink very much. But, hey, it's the fact that they offered something else to make it comfortable for us while we waited that mattered. \\n\\nOur room was located on the 6th floor facing the parking garage. This room wasn't very high up, so I was worried about the noise level because I'm a light sleeper. But, I slept like a baby because it was so quiet. The beds here were amazingly comfortable. We had 2 queen beds. I had one all to myself. Heaven. The temperature was pleasantly cool as well. \\n\\nWater and coffee/tea in the room were complimentary. Their bathroom didn't have that many complimentary toiletry items. But, you can ask for them (see attached card of all items you can ask the staff for free). So, that was great, especially if you forgot to bring some items from home. The decor in this hotel was nice and was accented here and there with Austin's art. Even our room had a nice picture of Austin's love for music. \\n\\nThe hotel was connected to the parking garage on the second floor, which was nice so we could take the covered air conditioned pathway to get to our car. You can then take the garage elevators to the 3rd floor and up, since parking for patrons starts on that floor. By the way, it costs $26 per day for all day parking with in and out privileges. Just use your hotel key and scan yourself in and out of the garage. This price seems steep, but it was more affordable than the other hotels in downtown Austin charging $30 and up for all day parking. \\n\\nNow, the breakfast buffet was bomb! My favorite was of course the omelette station. Can I get a what, what! The staff member who made our omelettes was amazing. Our omelettes were seasoned well and perfectly cooked. I loved the mushrooms, spinach, ham, onions, and cheese that were evenly interspersed throughout our omelette. If we didn't have to eat brunch later in the day, we we would've eaten two omelettes. We also loved the unlimited fruit, coffee, and orange juice we could order. The fruit was fresh and offered balance for all the unhealthy food we were eating. Definitely got more than one cup of coffee as well. The service was impeccable. Our waiter knew when to top off our coffee when we were running low. Safe to say, we enjoyed our complimentary breakfast buffet very much. \\n\\nWe knew our check out time was at 11 A.M.  the next day. But, I asked if we could check out at noon instead without incurring a penalty. The staff was very accommodating with this. You would think it's just one hour extra, right? Well, that one hour makes a difference as far as freshening up and packing last minute items are concerned. We'll take it. \\n\\nOverall, for the reasonable price, Hyatt Regency Austin did a great job in making our stay memorable. We will be back when we do visit Austin again."},{"name":"New Ginza","address":"63-65 Galen St","city":"Watertown","stars":"3.5","text":"Until recently, I've been a frequent diner at New Ginza ever since it opened during my senior year of college, about 5 years ago.

I enjoyed the place immensely and got to know the manager and the waitresses fairly well.  To be brutally honest, however, it's gone downhill over the past two years or so.  Service during the last three times I dined there was slow and unfriendly, so for the past year or so, I will only order takeout.  What's worse however, is that the prices have increased over time, which has been a bummer because now New Ginza is just as expensive as a places like Fugyaku and Oiishi,  but has a less creative menu and on some nights, poorer quality.  The final straw though is the frequency of missing items from my takeout orders.  Oh well.

I wish I could remember her name she was excellent. The food however is prepared more in the vein of a vietnamese cajun style which means that spice's are added after the boil which has a tendency to make it a little more oily than a straight boil.

This restaurant didn't do it for me, but they have rave reviews for those who live that lifestyle. This place reminds me of a restaurant that would flourish in like San Francisco or in Cali. If you're trying to live a keto lifestyle, stay far far away from this spot. The prices here are a little bit on the high side for what you get, and to be honest there are a lot of better options elsewhere. Clover BUR purely caters to a specific type of people, but yeah.\\n\\nSo what do you substitute when you don't use meat in your ingredients? Carbs. Yes, and lots of carbs. Veggies are also intertwined in the mix using mushrooms and other types of greens. However, carbs and starches are big because it fills you up and is supposed to be \\"healthy.\\" The menu here changes a lot and I believe what I saw when I visited will be different if you want this place. However, when I came here I got the only thing that had the most amount of fat and was the closest thing I could have that followed my lifestyle. \\n\\nI got the impossible meatball sub. It's basically the meat that they used for the impossible burger but formed into meatballs and served in a sandwich with marinara sauce. It was alright, I've definitely had better and for what I paid for it I felt like I could've gotten a better deal. In my opinion, it's nothing to die for but I can see the appeal if you're a vegan or vegetarian because of the limited options for eating out.\\n\\nI'm biased, but I feel like the amount of food you get and what you pay for you could get wider options elsewhere. However, on the other side everything is fresh because it's all veggies and it's not really easy to store all of those things.

Really good stuff and a great atmosphere with food that competes regardless of the time of day. \\n\\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\\n\\nMy expectations for restaurants that share a building with a major chain hotel could literally not be lower, but make no mistake this is no Embassy Suites restaurant. The staff were amazing and so accommodating especially since I was dining both times with a nine month old. From there, while a bit sluggish at times our servers were excellent. Star.      \\n\\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\\n\\nMother's is fairly priced especially given what they could charge. Sure, my Chicken Fried Chicken for dinner was $20.00, but that came with a full spread of two sides and the additional half order of mac and cheese was only $8.00. For breakfast, a very generous portion of Challah French Toast came to $9.00, which was reasonable. Star.     \\n\\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\\n\\nAll of my dishes at Mother's were good with the sole exception of the Mac and Cheese, which honestly I thought was pretty weak on account of the flavors and more soupy consistency. From there the French Toast was good, but not as good as I've had elsewhere and the 'crunchy' texture didn't really make it incrementally better over standard French toast.

We enjoyed it very much!  \\n\\nOur friend ordered nearly all of the appetizers: the special French fries with sauce, the sishito peppers,  the dumplings/potstickers, the pork bao, and both the soy garlic and the spicy chili wings. \\n\\nThe wings were very crispy and the sauces were good. I enjoyed them a lot except the chili ones were cold. Not room temp, but cold throughout. If the sauce is what made them cold then they wouldn't be cold by the bone - they were. We enjoyed them so much we didn't care that they weren't hot but I'm still perplexed at how they were crispy (fresh) yet cold. The soy ones were not cold. They were perfect. \\n\\nThe sishito peppers were bitter and not quite crispy the way I like them. They were my least favorite bite of the day. They are topped with bonito (which I don't like) *suggestion to the owners, make the descriptions on the menu a little more detailed please. I would have asked for no bonito had I known it was part of it. \\n\\nThe kids enjoyed the potstickers/dumplings very much. I didn't get a chance to try the fries or bao because I eat Keto and I splurged on the wings but the table seemed to enjoy them. \\n\\nFor 2 of the kids we ordered chicken and beef bulgogi. Though they were the very first orders put in, they were the very last items to come out. Had we not had appetizers the kids would have gone crazy. We were done with our poke bowls (more on that below) before their food came out. When it did, it was hot, plentiful and they really enjoyed it. \\n\\nI really enjoyed the poke. It was fresh and tasty. But, I haven't experienced a poke place that charges so much for additions. You only get 2 or 3 things from each category and you have to pay $1+ for extra stuff. The last place we went had just as many choices but no charge for anything once you buy the bowl. I didn't like that. I didn't want to add a bunch of stuff because our friends were treating us and I felt like it was unnecessary. My bowl was delicious and fresh as I said. \\n\\nSo, consensus is we really liked it. I would have given 4 stars if the kids food hadn't taken so long, the peppers weren't bitter, the wings being on the cold side and them allowing a few more topping options without charging more (ie: I don't want to pay $1 each for a sprinkling of cilantro and green onion). \\n\\nI'm looking forward to going again at some point."},{"name":"Yaletown Brewing Company","address":"1111 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I can't speak to the quality of the restaurant itself but I can speak to the crap service of the guy bouncing the door this past Saturday.

Am I proud of my self? Yes. Were they delicious? Yes. Would I do it again? Maybe, because that means extra minutes on the treadmill. Wait... I'm changing my answer to another YES. OK.\\n*****\\n\\nI. FOOD & DRINK\\nWord on the (Yelp) streetz is that Lee's has the best Vietnamese baguettes (Viet's use rice flour) in the city and they supply them to other restaurants in the area. Thus, I visited and ordered two days worth of this deliciousness because I don't want to cook this week. My banh mi harvest comprised of three thit nuong (Vietnamese grilled pork) and three gio thu (Vietnamese head cheese). I also had their caf√© sua da (Vietnamese coffee) and sipped on it while I waited. Note: If you're reading this review and can tell me how many times I dropped the word \\"Vietnamese,\\" I may give you a prize.\\n\\nNote #2: All of their to-go banh mis have the pickled carrot and daikon, cilantro, cucumber, and jalape√±os in separate bags. One must order a minimum of three banh mis, too. (Maybe because of a credit card minimum of $10?)\\n\\n*Banh Mi Thit Nuong: Good God! That is some ridiculously tasty marinade they got, and the mayo and pate were perfect. However, I think their pickled and julienned daikon and carrot slices could've been a bit more tangy, and the bread -- although pillow-y -- could have been more crunchy. That's right, I roll with #teamcrunchy. Ugh. But hey, I'm being super picky. This was excellent.\\n\\n*Banh Mi Gio Thu: When I was nine, I had my first banh mi gio thu in South Vietnam. And no joke, my first bite of this brought me back to me sitting in some hot-as-hell living/ dining room with a noisy AC trying to blow out some weak-ass cold air while eating with the extended fam. I devoured an entire one in about two minutes, and it was like very sloppy make-out sesh. (Not pretty.) Moral of the story? I highly recommend this.\\n\\n**Caf√© Sua Da: Hulk strong, which overpowers the sweetness from the condensed milk. I like.\\n\\nII. SERVICE\\nI went during lunch hour, so I did expect a wait; however, I didn't expect a 15+ minute wait.  Even people that put in orders ahead of time and got there late had to wait, but it was definitely worth it. I wouldn't come here if you're in a rush.\\n\\nIII. ATMOSPHERE/ D√âCOR\\nWell, it's definitely not like a first-date kind of place. It's more like if-you've-been-dating-for-a-hot-minute-come-here-to-see-if-she's-down kind of place. That's coded for \\"it needs a few updates.\\" But hey, it doesn't really matter all too much to me. This isn't a high-end steakhouse, there's no putrid smell, and it looks clean enough. Personally I'm more than willing to sit on a plastic chair in some dank alley, for a good meal. I've done it many times, too.\\n\\nIV. PRICES\\n$3 for a banh mi. It's not the cheapest, but it's of considerably higher quality than others I've had. Worthy of the price, PHO SHO.\\n\\nV. OVERALL\\nI'm not sure how their non-banh mi foods taste, but if I ate them they would not factor into my overall rating. A person eats at or gets takeout from Lee's for banh mi. It's like if you checked out El Farolito in San Francisco -- one of the most famous burrito places in the US -- and ordered tamales. WHY?! Ya just don't do it. \\n\\nAnd for me, I don't factor in service all too much. Did I get my food within a reasonable time? Yes...

I have never experienced such an unwelcoming treatment until I went to this bar.

I seriously ate my food as fast as I can & skip drinks so that I can't gtfo out of the place as fast as I can. \\n\\nWhen I first walked in there, there was nobody there at all but the bartender but he immediately made me feel so uncomfortable that I started questioning if he is judging me because I am too gay looking or maybe under dressed. I was wearing my short shorts bathing suit & T-shirt  (was supposed to go to the pool but it started raining). He has this look of disgust when he saw me walked in so I immediately thought he's homophobic even though I haven't had even just one interaction with him. I sat at the edge of the bar closer to the kitchen. I asked small question such as what's good to eat etc. He said all are good etc. Etc. So I ordered chicken wings & pot roast. \\n\\nWhile I was waiting he started doing his side works such as polishing utensils in front of me. No biggie, then he started slamming the utensils in front of me that it was driving me nuts. I never asked him to stop because that is his job instead I moved to the other side of the bar. \\n\\nFood arrived I ate pot roast and tried the wings, both are good. This guy never ask if the food is ok etc. He just kept leaving the bar to go to the back and totally just disappear the whole time. \\n\\nUnfortunately the pot roast wasn't ok because there was a curly black hair attached to it. I lost my interest in it so I went for the wings instead. When he finally arrived I told him about the hair. He then asked me \\"oh ok should I bring you more of this?\\" I said \\"no\\" he then left with the roast with not a single apology regarding the food. \\n\\nI ate the wings, asked for my check, paid it then left without a word and my first time ever not giving a tip.

This fell heavily short. \\n\\nLobby:\\nThis is the only area that shines. It's very clean, modern, smells pleasant, worthy of its 4-star rating. But it appears that's the only place they put their money into. \\n\\nRestaurant: \\nNo exciting specialty drinks, only 4 taps, hardly any local beers, and a lackluster menu. A standard mixed drink was $13...nothing fancy, just a quick couple pours. A little strap for something basic, but it is a hotel. While the room certainly looks appealing, the food is not. I ordered a sampler platter of calamari, ribs, and wings. The calamari was the most bland and rubbery substance I've ever ingested. The wings had no flavor other than being doused in a hot sauce. The ribs were well cooked but again, a gallon of sauce on them. \\n\\nPool/Gym: \\nthe gym area meets standard expectations. Nothing to complain or boast about here. The pool and sauna tub have a fairly private feeling despite being surrounded by a parking lot. A nice place to relax overall. Not a resort, but a great ancillary and necessary addition. \\n\\nThe room: \\nMaybe the biggest disappointment of them all. The furnishings are dated in style and don't hold up to other 4 star offerings. The bed is easily on par with a Red Roof Inn...you can feel the springs and instantly touch the bottom when sitting on it. I'm truly amazed at how a 4-star hotel can get away with such a poor quality mattress. Carpet had a few stains as did the chaise. Linens were clean and from a glance at the housekeeping carts the duvet covers are cleaned regularly as well; a huge plus. The bathroom is large, but disappointing. Standard finishes. Very basic tile, dirty grout, dirty shower head, nothing stated luxury by any stretch of the imagination (unless you count Aveda toiletries...). Generic brand coffee and teas in room as well as a molded iron add to the dismay, not to mention a large gap under the door which transfers a lot of hallway sound. \\n\\nFinal thoughts: \\nThis may sound like a lot of complaining but I hold a 4-star hotel to higher standards. This hotel is not worthy of a Renaissance Marquee. I have stayed at cleaner Motel 6's, more updates Courtyard's, and Sheratons with far better restaurants. While the proximity to the airport is favorable, do yourself a favor and seek other accommodations.

The chili comes in prepacked containers to take home cold (They have 4 pots of their heated chili for free sampling, though).\\n\\nThis is GREAT chili, and worth the visit. I will tell you why:\\n\\n1) The food. They have 4 styles and some baked goods (different cornbreads, cookies, etc.) All 4 styles were really good, but the I was especially impressed with the classic beef chili. The beef is not ground meat like most chili, but instead cubes of really tender steak. I've heard that this makes chili less fatty, but also not as tasty. In this case it was DEFINITELY full flavor and I loved it. I wish I could put this on a sandwich it was so good. The Coney sauce (no, they don't have hot dogs yet) was my favorite and it was thicker/less greasy than the types I've had before. Chicken and Vegan were also very well flavored, with the Vegan tasting a bit tangier/sweeter than the others.\\n\\n2) The philosophy. They aren't part of the \\"farm to table\\" movement and they probably have some room to improve how they communicate their healthy angle, but they CLEARLY believe in transparency as evidenced by their prominent display of all the nutritional facts and ingredients in large letters on their menu. The gentleman at the counter also talked to me for a while about their recipes, and while I'm not Food Babe it sure seemed to me like they were using the healthiest sources available for their ingredients. When we were talking about the steak cubes and Vegan soy crumbles, it was also obvious to me that making the chili as low-cal as possible while still achieving great flavors was very important to them.\\n\\n3) They're friendly. I'm sure people will not go to a take-out-only chili place for the great service, but it's still appreciated when you feel welcome and encouraged to try as much of their food as you want. The owner talked to me for close to 10 minutes and was completely transparent about everything they do to their food.

Mine...mine didn't come out even after 45 min. I asked the waiter (Sally? Sandra?) who took my order to check. She never got back to me. When it hit the 50 minute mark, I asked another waiter to cancel my order. He came back telling me that it'll take 5 to 10 minutes more, asking me whether I really wanted to cancel my order. \\n\\nREALLY???? after 50 minutes of waiting and being on an hour lunch break, do I want to wait another  5 to 10 minutes?

While all of those locations were solid, the Orlando location is one of the best ones around. Located on Universal near Pointe Orlando and the new Andretti's location, Topgolf can best be described as combining a driving range, restaurant and club all into one location.\\n\\nMy friends and I decided to head over to Topgolf around 8pm last Saturday night. While we were concerned about being able to get a bay (aka the area where you sit and hit golf balls) due to the place being so busy (they even offer valet parking because it gets so packed!), our wait was only about 30-40 minutes. While such a long wait might be difficult to endure for other activities, the time flew buy due to the bar/restaurants located on each level. We went down to the beautiful lower level bar and grabbed some seats while watching college football on various\\n large television screens. Honestly, you could just come hang out here and watch football and people hitting balls and still have a good time. \\n\\nWhile waiting for a bay, we decided to put in an order for food. I ordered the GOAT (a fun egg and chicken appetizer on french toast with a captain crunch coating) while my wife and friend ordered other various food. My food came out pretty quickly, while their food came out right around when we were texted to go to our bay. The bar transferred us over to the waiter at our bay and we continued eating (and proceeded to order a couple buckets of beer). While the prices were typical I-Drive prices, the food and drink was good and made the experience that much better.\\n\\nOnce we arrived at the bay, we checked-in (you have to buy a one time membership for $10, but it works at all locations) and looked over the games. The way this activity is structured is that you hit golf balls (which you access by waiving a club at a censor) out at various targets of various colors and distances ranging from 50 yards to 250 yards. Clubs of all types and sizes (both men and women) are provides, and the games on a computer monitor dictate where you should hit the ball and the amount of points you get for hitting the ball. Hitting all the way to the back net on scoring games gets you 50 points, while hitting one of the various targets scores you between 2 to 40 points. Since the score is determined by the final destination of your ball, many people can score lots of points with subpar shots that roll (meaning anyone can play!).\\n\\nSince each hour cost $50 per bay during that time of day (which came out to $15 a person for us), we were able to play 2 games. Each game gives each person 20 shots apiece, and the standard structure is to hit 5 balls and switch over to the next person (be sure to tap the screen or you'll take someone else's ball!). While hitting your balls, televisions and music are playing in the background and the target zones occasionally flash their colors in unison with the music! This little feature, along with the golf ball collector going out every so often and giving everyone another target to try to hit, makes for quite the entertaining evening to go along with your food and drink.\\n\\nOverall, the Orlando Topgolf is a fantastic I-Drive venue that provides a beautiful location, great food and drink, and a fun atmosphere for an extremely fun activity. If you are trying to decide on an I-Drive activity, you should definitely give this place a look."},{"name":"Hachiro Ramen","address":"140 16th Street W","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Grand opening of the first and sole ramen joint in the north van neighbourhood.

Anytime I travel somewhere, I make it a point to sample something local that's popular with the natives. I happened to stumble upon this place as I was exploring the North Market. I love fried chicken, and if you live anywhere outside of the South it's difficult to get truly great fried chicken that isn't from a fast food chain. The best fried chicken I ever had was in New Orleans, but this was a very close second. When I got there, there was no line. As soon as I placed my order, had my name called, then got seated, the line was at least 30 people long. The menu is small, but they more than make up for it with quality. You're sitting with a bunch of people you don't know and it feels like a family picnic, enjoying really good and spicy fried chicken. The spice was absolutely perfect and I got the hottest level. The skin was crispy, the flesh was juicy, and the sides added the perfect balance and acidity needed to cut the richness of the thighs I ate, which followed by a gulp of cold sweet tea. But what I think made the experience that much more special was when the cook came out and asked me individually how my food was tasting. I was so happy to tell him it was one of the best fried chicken's I ever ate, and it meant a lot to him that I said that. When you eat delicious food made by people who aim to please you, you have a place that's not just a restaurant, but a home.

Some ten years ago I had a very different experience than the one I'll offer as a review and suffice it to say if today was that day I'd be surprised if I could muster anything more than 1 star. But that was then and this is now. \\n\\nThe bakery has changed. A LOT. You used to be able to sit down and enjoy your cake and eat it, too. But no longer. It's more of a cross between a garage sale and a bakery than anything else. It's very eclectic and chaotic. The space between the door/wall and the case can suffice for about six people - today while I was in there were 5 of us. And it was an awkward \\"Excuse me\\" opportunity. The thing that surprised me was the owner, Marilyn DeVault, whom was busy meeting the needs of two women obviously making plans for a party was asked by the employee to help me. That employee should have jumped to the task but she was busy icing a cake. Perhaps she was on deadline but still doesn't excuse her putting the boss on the spot to assist customers. Marilyn was wacky, and real. Just like her bakery. And the cake speaks for itself - moist, delicious, brilliant. At first I thought $5.95 was steep but once I got home and that cake (The Chantilly - chocolate with cream cheese icing) just melt in my mouth I knew I was in heaven. The price was spot on. So what if I couldn't eat there at the shop - what matters is the customer service was good, the cake was amazing and my mood improved 150%. In fact I forgot all about that wacko driver and simply fell into a delightful sugar induced relaxation mode.\\n\\nYou can say what you want about this bakery, and most do, but keep in mind that owners of businesses don't have to conform to some restrictive template when designing their companies. They create their space as weird as they want if you go in with a closed mind you're better off picking up a 10 year old Twinkie from a Hostess Store (if you can still find one). This bakery is perfect the way it is and to suggest they change it is just plain dumb. Portland is a town of originals and Piece of Cake Bakery is VERY original. So when you're in the mood for all things cake, gluten or not, head on over to SE 17th & SE Umatilla - keep your eyes, mind and mouth open and willing to experience crazy, wacky and oh so delicious."},{"name":"Donair Affair","address":"2540 Mary Hill Road, Suite 105","city":"Port Coquitlam","stars":"3","text":"This owners are horrible.

Hello Chicken is located on Buford Highway next to Mozart Bakery and Sinaloense Pollo Asados, across from Vivi Bubble Tea, Yen Jing, and Tea House Formosa.  The small parking lot was empty when I went, but if all the restaurants are at full capacity I can imagine the lot filled up.  The light on the open sign wasn't on when I went, but the restaurant was open - so go by the hours on the window and not by the sign.  Inside of the restaurant is very plain looking, but the layout is spacious.  You'll be served at tables that seat 4-6 people and are in separate nooks.  There's a good distance in the aisle between you and the next table.  It wouldn't hurt for the restaurant to be spruced up a bit, but the place is clean so just don't expect anything trendy or fancy if you dine in.  Service is good - I ordered takeout at the counter in the back and the owner offered me water while I was waiting.\\n\\nOn the Menu: In addition to the expected fried chicken, Hello Chicken also serves bibimbap, lunch boxes, rice and noodles, and other assorted street food items.   Bibimbop is done Chipotle style - pick rice or salad, add a grill(ed protein), pick vegetables, then pick sauce.  Meat choices include beef bulgogi, chicken teriyaki, and spicy squid.  The lunch boxes have some similar and some different grill choices, such as fried fish, Korean chicken, and hamburger steak.  With the lunchbox, you will get fried rice, a dumpling, salad, and toppoki (spicy Korean rice cakes).  The \\"lunch boxes\\" can also purchased at dinnertime for a slightly higher price.  Chicken can be purchased in one of the following varieties - fried, sweet and spicy, soy garlic, spicy, or half and half of two different varieties.   Street food options include Korean tacos, bulgogi quesadillas (yummy sounding), fried dumplings, and Kimchi cheese French fries.\\n\\nWhat I Tried:\\nChicken Teriyaki Lunch Box ($9.99) - My lunch box came with a medium sized portion of chicken teriyaki strips, a small portion of fried rice, a single fried dumpling, a small portion of salad, several rice cakes in red spicy sauce, and a cup of soup on the side.  The chicken teriyaki doesn't come with a lot of sauce, but the flavor is still good.  Meat isn't super juicy, but still tender.  The fried rice had a nice mixture of saut√©ed diced onion, egg, and carrots.  Salad was very fresh and the dressing was light, flavorful, and tasty.  The sauce in the toppoki was thick for my taste and the texture of the rice cakes could have been a little better.  Also, I would have liked the sauce more if it were a bit more spicier.  I liked how the fried dumpling wasn't skimpy with filling.  Good deal overall for lunch at $9.99.  The soup on the side is simple and a good palate cleanser.  I liked how they tightly wrapped my soup container in plastic wrap so it wouldn't spill all over my car.\\n\\nVerdict: I rate the taste and value of the food at four stars.  The menu has a lot of choices and orders are easy to customize. Inside the restaurant isn't super flashy, but for those of you who don't care about ambiance you'll get a good meal at a good price."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I normally do NOT like donuts, but Pip's is an exception--made time to get a dozen mini donuts during our holiday trip to Portland.

I have been here before a few times, the other times were about 5-10 years ago. The restaurant used to be fantastic, but now it seems like they cannot figure out or accommodate the ridiculous volume of people that visit each night. \\n\\nI had my bachelorette party in Austin this past weekend and we thought it would be a good idea to eat at the oasis, because I remembered how beautiful and fun it was from my previous visits years ago. My sister tried to book a reservation ahead of time, but spoiler alert-- they don't do reservations. No problem right? It's a big restaurant and we would have been fine with waiting up to an hour for a table while we sip on some margaritas. We got to the parking lot about 6:45 and it probably took almost 30 minutes just to find a parking spot. No luck on the surface lot, so we tried the parking garage. The parking garage was bumper to bumper literally from the entrance to the top. You're really trapped once you're in there because there are no spots and it's just everyone driving to the top then back down once they realize there aren't any. The parking garage is so narrow that it's impossible for trucks to make turns or back out making it even harder for you to get anywhere (You'd think being in Texas they would have anticipated that being an issue). My sister ended up having to drop us off at the front, make another round through the parking garage then finally had to just use valet parking for $7 plus tip. \\n\\nSo then we finally get to the hostess stand where they inform us the wait time is 2.5 to 3 hours. We wouldn't have been able to sit down to order until 10. We tried their very casual counter service restaurant upstairs but quickly realized we would not be able to find a table. We decided we needed to go to another restaurant entirely since it clearly wasn't working out, which meant we had to go back to the valet and wait for him to get our car (it hadn't been parked very long) and my cousin had to get her car out of that god-awful parking garage. \\n\\nTo sum it up, just trying to eat there wasted an hour of my life and $10 for parking. I wanted an average restaurant experience with a pretty view, instead I was held hostage by a parking garage."},{"name":"Rockmill Tavern","address":"503 S Front St, Ste 100","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I decided to go to Rockmill for Friday night dinner.

I needed to get a cake for my son's 19th birthday party. We'd changed the date for his party due to a family health issue and I didn't have time to order a cake. No problem -- I've always managed to find a great cake in a pinch from New Seasons or Whole Foods for about $28-30, which was where I was headed when I drove past Piece of Cake and thought they might have something delightful. \\n\\nThe first thing I noticed when walking in is that there was a lot of junk piled around, like an open storage area or something off to one side. It was very cluttered, but I thought maybe this was just their thing? There was only one person behind the counter who didn't acknowledge me for more than 5 minutes -- I had to ask for help. \\n\\nAll of that would have been forgivable if the cake was delicious, but it wasn't. I chose the Chantilly cake, and was told it was \\"rich, dark chocolate with cream cheese frosting\\". It was simple and \\"homely\\" looking -- the frosting decorations piped around the sides was uneven and amateurish - but I was in a hurry and pressed on. I got quite the sticker shock when I learned the cake would be $60, which should probably have been a clue that something was amiss, but then I felt I'd already wasted enough time so I chalked it up to a lesson learned, bought the cake and went on my way. \\n\\nSo here we are at the party and it's time to light the candles and cut the cake. The next sign of something amiss was when the \\"frosting\\" *crunched* when we put the candles in. The piped icing around the sides cracked/broke and fell off in chunks during serving. The cake tasted awful -- it was dry and stale, overly sweet, but oddly didn't taste like chocolate. In fact, it didn't have any discernible flavor except for the sweetness. And the frosting? It wasn't a nice cream cheese buttercream. In fact, it didn't taste like cream cheese at all. It was more akin to a sweet flavorless icing, thin and crunchy. I couldn't have been more humiliated; a Betty Crocker box cake and canned frosting would have tasted better. Nobody finished their slice of cake and the whole thing ended up in the trash.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I'm truly puzzled by all the 4 and 5 star reviews: my single star is overly generous.

Most people have no idea it's even here. I was suprised myself when I first came. It has like a little local bar vibe. One of the things you notice when you see it, is how small it is. From the outside it looks like there will be like 5 tables. But when you walk in you can see that it goes back further than it looks from the outside. There is actually quite a bit of room inside. Also it has a pretty decent sized bar in there as well. Another big difference between this location and the rest is that it's quite a bit quieter. Without a bunch of people running around and more things going on, it's more relaxed. But just like other Rooster's it still has a good amount of TVs for sports viewing, and the same great menu that has given Roosters its great reputation for top notch wings and appetizers. In my opinion, Rooster's has the best wings in Columbus. Their sauces are on point and there wings are big and meaty. You will never eat a dry or cold wing here.\\n\\nThe servers are pretty good. They are very attentive and make sure you have what you need. That could attribute to the fact that this is about half the size of a regular Rooster's.\\n\\nBesides the fact that is close to my home, this is my fav Roosters because of how laid back it is, while still offering everything great, that all the other Rooster's locations offer.

Hubby ordered blueberry pancakes special with pork apple sausage with OJ and I ordered side of 2 eggs, Belgium waffle, bacon, and Mother's blend of coffee. The OJ was freshly squeezed but sour, not sweet. My coffee was ok, not as smooth as I like. I love Belgium waffles and was very looking forward to theirs. But I was disappointed since it was advertised as crunchy yet soft. I had better waffles elsewhere and was expecting a light airy waffle which it was not. IMO, it tasted as if it's the same mix as the pancake and nothing special. The gas and bacon was good, nothing spectacular. Hubby thought blueberry pancakes were ok.

The crumb topping on the pudding was the perfect mix and sweet and salty. I wanted to eat the entire portion and I wasn't even the one who wanted dessert.

The place was not busy, and by 8pm, they were out of most offerings at the buffet.\\nMy biggest complain though is about the chicken.  Whether a la carte or at the buffet both taste exactly the same, which is expected, but I don't think I'd want to pay that price again for such poor quality (my son had the chicken Tikka Masala a la carte).  The meat was tough, as if it had been added at the end, in cubes (maybe kept frozen) in the sauce (which by itself was tasty.)\\nUsually, the meat(beef, lamb or chicken) is simmered in the sauce and melts in your mouth. At Tibet's, the meat is tough and not the least infused with the spices. \\nThe rice pudding was fairly good, but I would have the same comment, it feels like is should have cooked longer, so that flavors really become part of the grain.\\nSo, a fairly good deal if you want to have dinner on a budget, but for average food (and less than average for the chicken dishes.)"},{"name":"Little Donkey","address":"505 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Ok, so I went back because I had this nagging feeling that Little Donkey could be great... and it WAS!

Moreover, there are only single donuts of each kind in the viewing case; when you choose the types of donuts you want, the person behind the counter reaches into a drawer and pulls them out, one by one, almost as if they have just materialized in these magic drawers.

However, the St. Regis founder of afternoon tea is St. Regis founders mother Caroline Astor in the late 19th century. Afternoon Tea at the St. Regis is a traditional past time ever since. At the Atlanta location, one can enjoy this experience at the Astor Court located on the beautiful second level which overlooks the open lobby. \\n\\nAstor court is furnished and designed with bespoke pieces providing contemporary touch while maintaining the elegance of the hotels rich legendary heritage. \\n\\nThe dress code is smart and sophisticated casual. \\n\\nValet at the front like at any hotel (its free + tip). Funny story, the valet boy assisting us did not know it was free and charged us for it until his manager promptly corrected him in front of us quiet bluntly. It provided quiet a entertaining \\"bro moment\\" to observe. I got a good laugh out of the it while waiting for our car. Its nice to have fun, realistic moments at a place like the St. Regis where things can be a bit too posh and uptight at times. \\n\\nReservations are required. \\n\\nHours are Friday - Sunday 2:30-4:30 pm. \\n\\nPrice is $40 per person and $22 for children under 12. \\n\\nService- Wonderful and detailed. I love how they take the time to introduce, explain, and answer the history and selection of tea selection. I noticed many people saying service is slow. But one must understand the speed of how the upper class moves. One could call it slow, others call it being graceful. Patience is a show of elegance and class (or so they said in etiquette class)  \\n\\nMenu we experienced consisted:\\n\\n1. Scones- Traditional Golden Raisin and Vanilla Almond. Served fresh and warm in a basket as an \\"appetizer\\" before receiving the remaining items. \\n\\n2. Sweets- Lemon Drop cookies, Caramel Almond Candy Bar, Mini Cheesecake, Orange and Honey Torte , and Strawberry Decadence \\n\\n3. Sandwiches - \\nSmoked salmon, whipped chive cr√®me fra√Æche, marble rye\\nSouthern-style egg salad, tarragon aioli, Vienna loaf\\nEnglish cucumber, chive cream, sourdough bread\\nRoast turkey breast, gouda cheese, sundried tomato aioli, whole wheat bread\\nTomato and basil, garlic aioli, challah loaf (this one was my favorite if I had to choose 1)\\n\\nTea: \\nThe selection is the same I believe with all the St. Regis afternoon tea however this place does offer its own location blend which is quiet refreshing. The selections we sampled was the mad hatter and green tea. Both excellent. I was not fond though of the chipped tea pot spout. It would not be fun to drink a few pieces of chipped china in my tea. I was a consistent concern which did affect my experience slightly. \\n\\nReview: \\nThe experience is wonderful. From the very entertaining valet boys, to the friendly lobby staff, to the customer service and experience at Astor Court. It is everything you would expect at a St. Regis. However, the food is mediocre at this location in regards to the afternoon tea. In addition I was a bit bothered due to the fact that the food tower is carried just inches off the floor which is a bit unsanitary. Due to the wonderful natural light that radiants through the large windows I managed to see dust particles kick up from the carpet onto our food before it reached out table. Probably would have been the perfect time and excuse for some champagne. The tea a step up from the food. I will just make sure next time to ask for a non chipped teapot.

We also tried the Youpon Gin Margarita $8 a little larger than a Dixie cup. It was a nice cool frozen drink on a very humid day.Taste wise not a fan too much of a floral note. My husband finished it for me he enjoyed it. The open air bar outside was hotter than the venue outside. I love the fact that the Farmers Market came in later on that Saturday at about 330 ish.

He could barely figure out what to order and I ended up going with the Steak and Frites. My steak may have been one of the worst steaks i have ever had. The steak was filled with fat. I had to cut an entire portion of it off just because it was all fat. The steak came with yuca fries and they were so salty that they were inedible. I love yuca fries generally but i have never seen them literally covered in salt. What a total bust for a plate that costs nearly $60. I left most of it on my plate. We ordered Mac and cheese as a side. A server brought us mashed potatoes instead. No biggie. We let our server know there was a mistake and an order of Mac and Cheese came shortly after. The Mac and cheese was bland. No taste at all. I honestly was just so hungry at this point that i forced myself to eat it.

We love their salsa, service has always been good, and the food is good for restaurant Mexican food.\\n\\nThat being said, the service has really gone downhill as of recently. The last 2 times we've gone, we've had horrendous service and the food has left much to be desired (except for this last visit.. more on that in a bit)...  \\n\\nWe've noticed a lot of new faces in the wait staff, and I get that sometimes training takes more time with others. We try to be patient, but with 3 kids, sometimes that's hard. The time before last, it took forever to get our food and it was barely warm when we received it. The restaurant was packed that night, with one large table that circled around the main dining area. Unfortunately, this night, we had to share our server with that large party. It's ok, I get it. It's difficult to staff sometimes. We went home with an attitude that we would be back, of course, as always, and chalked it up to an off night.\\n\\nWe went back last night after a school function for one of our children. There were 6 of us in our party. Because we were there late (for us), we ordered our soft drinks, appetizer, and our meals when the server came to get our drink order. There was another large party in the main dining room (not as big as the last one), but the restaurant was relatively empty (compared to usual). We sat in one of the large booths in the section farthest away from the door. There was a 4 top booth that arrived about the same time we did (a little before), and another 6 top that arrived just after us. That was all that was in this section. Again, we shared our server with the large party (not sure why), but he promptly brought us our drinks and queso so we thought it would be alright. We sat and ate chips, queso, and salsa as we chatted with our children. A while passed, and we noticed that the 2 tables in our section who arrived at the same time we did (pretty much) received their food and FINISHED eating. We still had not gotten our food. Our server came out to bring us our bill, and we asked him where our food was. He quickly scrambled away. We waited about another 5 minutes, he came back to the other two tables and did not acknowledge us. We decided we would leave, I got the children out of the booth and my husband asked him for the check for our 2 soft drinks and queso dip. He said don't worry about it. On my way out, I passed the server (without knowing he spoke with my husband) and asked him how much we owed. I told him this was ridiculous--we waited over an hour for food that never came! He told me the kitchen ran out of rice, and that was way we had not gotten our meal. We had some dishes that didn't even have rice in it, and anyway, we waited OVER AN HOUR (an hour and 25 minutes to be exact)! This is beyond absurd!\\n\\nI'm sorry to say that we will not be returning to Los Bravos. It's really sad, because prior to this it has been our go-to Mexican restaurant. Seriously, we probably eat there 8-10 times a month (yep, more than once a week). \\n\\nI hope you work out whatever issues you are having, Los Bravos.

The updates are nice and I think it's slowly getting better. \\n\\nThe only complaint I have is that the bed sheets were not changed when I got there, and it still looked dirty with woman's hairs on it. I had to get new sheets to cover it. When I asked for my bedsheets to be changed the next day, they just simply took the new clean sheets that I had gotten the night before and left the old sheets there again. I know it's the same sheets because there was a black mark on the same place where I had seen it the night before. Pretty darn digusting, but luckily they gave me a new room. If it wasn't for the amazingly helpful guys at the front desk (Benny, John, and my asian brotha 10/7 nightshift), this would have been a 2 star review.

A restaurant with such a hefty line must be out of this world, I thought. The next day, we were thinking about a place to brunch before the wedding and Mother's came to mind. Yes, we saw the line the day before. We should have known better. But we read the Yelp reviews and it sounded so tasty that we decided to give it a try and ask what the wait was. If it was going to be too long, we'd continue somewhere else. I think they know this trick...\\n\\nWhen we arrived, the hostess said that wait was 45 minutes. We looked at each other and thought, 45 minutes is long but feasible so let's do it and go next door to Stumptown's for an iced coffee while we wait. The line for coffee ended up taking longer than we thought it would, so when we came back 40 minutes later, we figured that our table must be close to ready. We walked up to the hostess and asked and she said that we just had a couple people ahead of us. So we continued to wait and wait...and wait. When it hit an hour, we walked up to her again and asked what the status was. She proceeded to rudely snap back that the wait was 45 minutes to an hour (which is not what she told us when we first arrived) and that our table would be ready soon. I understand that she's stressed and there are a lot of people here, but customer service 101 teaches us that no matter what the level of stress is, you remain polite to your paying guests. I could go on, but in summary, we ended up getting seated after an hour and a half wait. Had we known from the start that the wait was an hour and a half and not 45 minutes, we wouldn't have stayed. I also noticed that they told everyone who came in the wait was 45 minutes. It made me wonder if that's the time they just decided give to everyone and figured it was a rough estimate or actually have rime and reason to the time they allot. So after such a long wait, and rude treatment from the staff while we waited, the meal was already off on a bad foot when we sat down. \\n\\nWith a wait this long, I expected the food to be phenomenal with items you don't experience anywhere else. Was it? No. It was your average breakfast that I could have most likely gotten at my hotel and without the hour and a half wait. They were featuring pecan Cinnamon rolls on the specials list, so we decided to start with one. That was the best and most unique part of the meal. It was moist and scrumptious. I went for the Eggs Benedict as my meal. It was average. The potatoes that accompanied it were on the hard side and lacked a ton of flavor. The Eggs Benedict was good but it tasted like every other Eggs Benedict I've tasted. I tried a bite of my friend's Mike's Special Scramble\\nwith prosciutto ham, roasted garlic, fresh tomatoes, basil & provolone cheese. That was quite tasty and I wish I got that instead of my meal. \\n\\nThe ambiance was cute but it was so incredibly crowded that it took away from the experience. The service was pretty slow on top of it, so three hours later we left the restaurant... not exactly what I wanted to do on my trip to Portland and especially since we then were so behind we had to rush to get ready for the wedding. \\n\\nIn summary, my review might have been different if the experience didn't begin with an hour and a half wait and rude service, but sadly I won't be back to Mother's the next time I'm in Portland to try it again."},{"name":"Buckeye Pho","address":"761 Bethel Rd, Ste E195","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Definitely the best pho in town and such a great staff.

In case you were wondering this place is a casual walk in, always a spot open for you type place. I got the pork chop with pasta and mushrooms. I have to say, the sauce that they put at the bottom was delicious. The pasta was good too. You just have to cut in and dip in the sauce which is what I'm guessing your supposed to do because there is no sauce on the pasta. The mushrooms are very good, not much of them though. One of my kids got the salmon which was great, and perfectly cooked with nice miso flavor. My other child got the beef skewers which is a wood skew that goes beef, green bell pepper, beef, onion, beef, yellow bell pepper, and finally more beef. In addition there is a small cup on the plate as well which I think was bbq. You dip the beef on the sauce and it tastes really good. Under the skewer was \\"stickey rice\\" as they call it. But trust me it is something special. In order to make the rice taste extremely good. You should drizzle some of the sauce over it and it's a party (Trust me I've tried it). For desert on the kids menu my younger one got dirt and worms which is is brownie over pudding over Oreo and on top crawling through all of that is goofy gummy worms. When our waiter described it I couldn't help wanting to try it. Surprisingly it tasted really good. It was so good I ate the whole thing.

The skin was on the thick side too. \\n\\nThe beef stew with tofu was good, but most of the taste came from the jalapeno pepper.

This is the second time we've ordered them because we just love them so much. When I got the text message that our bay was ready for us to play, we got there and an employee was already waiting there for us to get started to play. Someone was by very quickly after that to take our drink and food order. We have never had a problem with the service or food here.

My son wanted to take us to one of his favorite spots in Atlanta and I was glad we went.  I was pleasantly surprised at how nice and comfortable the interior was when we arrived and were seated in the balcony dining area.  We had a nice view of the brew processing area which is prominently placed in the lower dining area.  My son made a some recommendations for some of their beers as we checked out a menu that has a large selection of their in house brews along with draft guest breweries and bottled beers.  They also have mixed drinks and wine to satisfy everyone in your group (like my wife, Jo who doesn't share my son and my fondness for craft beer , yeah I don't get it either).  Well this is place to satisfy everyone in the beverage department as they have it all (a short fall of a lot of breweries).  We ordered some appetizers with the pretzel being a have to have (a standard for my better half) and we tried the Tempura avocado with cilantro chili sauce.  Both  we're very good, the tempura ha da light batter and the chili sauce a great accompaniment to the fried avocado.  My wife wanted a pizza and I lost out (again) wanting the Charcuterie pizza (how could that not be good?) and we ordered the Shroom pizza. This ended up being a good choice as the pizza had a lot of flavor with a good tasting crust and a taste basil sauce with arugula on top (a nice departure from a tomato based pie).  My son ordered the T.H.C. Sandwich, which is their buffalo chicken sandwich with slaw, pickles and mayo.   He usually has the burgers here on the Monday a $10 burger, fries with a brew special  (raves about it) and was happy with his change of pace.  \\nFood & Beverages 4.5 Good Craft beer and way above typical pub fare food.

This time is no different, I tried Vietnamese-style iced phin coffee. I was surprised, when the owner served me a brewing metal drip filter on top of a small ceramic mug, and a cup of ice. He said let the coffee sit in the cup for about five minutes. Then, take the cover up and make sure all the coffee done dripping. After that, stir well to mix the coffee and sweetened condensed milk. Once that done, pour the coffee over the cup of ice and stir. This is a pretty interesting experience to me, since I got to brew and make myself a Vietnamese coffee. I really like the combination between coffee and condensed milk. As you sip in the coffee, you get a favor of condensed milk, along with a strong aftertaste of the coffee.\\n\\nHere is the spring roll with pork patty. The pork patty gives a rich grill favor to the spring roll. Along with the lettuce and basil, it balances out the oiliness from the pork patty.

I do think fish sauce differentiated the rolls from other restaurants.\\n\\nPho is my must have item for Vietnamese restaurants. Each restaurant have their own recipe for pho, and I would say this is one of my favorite pho by far. The broth is very savory and the ingredients are undoubtedly fresh.

Usually servers at Disney will go out of their way to make me feel a little special when dining alone which I appreciate. Even if it is just a little extra conversation. This server gave the impression that he felt uncomfortable that I was dining solo, which then made me feel uncomfortable dining solo- a feeling I let go of a long time ago.

The food was delicious, so we end up spending a grip but definitely worth every dollar. Our waitress was fantastic and very accommodating. She was also very knowledgeable of all menu items. We order the queso with fresh chips. The chips were a little thick for my husband's liking but I enjoyed them. The queso was absolutely delicious and I could tell the queso was made from scratch. In addition, I ordered the snapper with rice, which was stewed with tomatoes and other herbs, it also had lump crab meat. Absolutely delicious. My husband ordered a crusted ribeye, which he stated was the best ribeye he's ever had. And trust me he has had his share ribeyes. My son ordered the side of okra as well as the collards. The collards are  cooked with pork but I did taste a little bit and it was pretty tasty. The fried okra was really good as w.ell. I think it tastes better without the aioli that came with it. My son ordered the ribs and he said they were some of the best ribs he's had. It tasted okay to me but I only  taste a teeny tiny piece. I did enjoy the barbecue sauce that they provided with the ribs. The jazz music was absolutely fantastic. Definitely would love to eat here again when they have live music.

I explained to them I was tired of waiting and didn't appreciate how they kept extending the wait time (I mean really, who goes to a restaurant and stays at their table for 2 hours??). Here's where I really got upset. I saw people getting seated that arrived AFTER US. Which means, they literally forgot about us. I went back to the hostess and explained the situation. Just out of the blue, they said to a water \\"hey can you go bring them to table 10\\" or whatever the number was. And also, the table was in a TERRIBLE spot. It was literally pushed out in the corner and we had to squeeze through other tables to get there. Also, the waiter looked like he hated working there.

I always orders the fries, because they're delicious. Then I mix up whatever else I get for my order. For you meatitarians, I highly recommend the meatballs or the meatball sandwich. Is it actual meat? No. Can you tell the difference? Also no. I brought a coworker here who is ANTI vegetable and she LOVED the meatball pita sandwich. So, just try it. I'm also a big fan of the falafel. I typically get the falafel plate with a warm pita. I also always always order their ginger soda. They make it fresh in store! Hello get in my belly. \\n\\nThe only potential draw back is, it can get pricey if you're ordering a meal, a side of fries, and a soda (like I do).

The best part for me and what drew me in was the price! Their prices are about half that of any one of the recognizable touristy Austin BBQ joints.

The food was tasty, but the service was seriously lacking. I've had amazing experiences at St. Regis properties and events in the Pacific and in Europe. I've been conditioned to expect a very high level of service. I've had better service at Cracker Barrel than at the St. Regis Atlanta. That's a problem.\\n\\nI made our reservation through the St. Regis \\"holiday butler\\" office, which was very prompt in responding to my phone message and e-mails completing the reservation. They even asked if we needed high chairs or booster seats, which we did, and added the request to our reservation. I'll add here that our requested high-chair and booster seats were not passed on to the restaurant. Why did the butler even ask if the restaurant is just going to ask again? They need better communication.\\n\\nSurprisingly for the reputation this apparently has as one of the best brunch spots in Atlanta, it wasn't very crowded. We were promptly seated and our waiter, a friendly middle-aged Asian man, introduced himself and brought us some drinks. However, that was our last interaction with him.  It's not quite clear what happened, but I think one of the bussers decided to take it upon herself to be our server. Many thanks to her for doing so, though her lack of experience and training was showed, and she was very shy, she eventually relaxed a little bit. It's not fair of our original waiter to abandon us and put the responsibility on her, for the St. Regis for perhaps understaffing brunch, or for not fully training its staff.\\n\\nAs for the food, the New Year's Day brunch, featuring a buffet focused on southern New Year's Day good luck foods like black-eyed peas, was decent. The black-eyed peas were perhaps the best I've ever had. They also offered shrimp and grits, sawmill gravy and biscuits, and other southern classics. The shrimp and grits was lacking in flavor and southern 'kick' compared to what I've had elsewhere in the South. My wife said the Hoppin' John was also a bit bland. The gravy was excellent, though! The brunch price included an open bar of Bloody Marys and champagne/mimosas, which made the whole thing a pretty decent value. \\n\\nI would give it another chance, but this experience was certainly not to the high standard I've come to expect of the St. Regis."},{"name":"Antonis Restaurant Diner","address":"10765 SW Canyon Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"Love the food.

It was loud in there, and my son was the only person under the age of 21 in the place. He didn't care. \\n\\nWhen we went to ask for a table, we were told it was an hour wait. But, at the bar it's first come - first serve, and a couple was just leaving. We jumped at their seats! \\n\\nMy son ordered the half bird. It was cooked to perfection and the bartender suggested some of their house mustard which was a little bit spicy but perfect with the chicken my son ordered. My son agreed and gobbled up every bit he could. I had the pulled pork and I have never had anything so moist and tender in my life. It was soaked in their bbq sauce, but it was not overwhelmingly present. There IS a bit of spice to their sauce, much more than expected, but well worth it for the taste. \\n\\nFor the sides, we had brussel sprouts covered in bacon. That was some darn good veggies. Also, the Mac and 3 cheese. It came out looking like a microwaved cheese bowl with burnt crust on top...but it was mouthwateringly delicious. \\n\\nHighly recommended.

I was so excited to finally convince my hubby to take me. He had balked because of the price. I have been waiting for years to go. We arrived around 7pm and it was packed. We had to wait for a table to be cleaned before we could be seated. I couldn't wait to hit the food. We were given 4 shell bowls and silverware. The plates were located by the food bars and you help yourself. I ordered a drink and got to keep the glass, which was $5 extra. There were no napkins or paper towels on the table except the one the silverware came wrapped in so we had to ask for some. My husband had to go to the bathroom to wash his hands and he said the floor was so wet it was like an ice rink in the men's bathroom.\\n\\nAbout the food... The lobsters were small and old. I've never seen such \\"flaky\\" lobster. No matter where it came from.. Tail, claw, whatever, you could not pull it or get at it without it breaking into dry crumbs. The smaller pieces were so stuck to the shells I didnt even try to eat the smaller legs after the first 2. I tried a second lobster since they brought out a full pan of new ones after my first one. There was no improvement. There were none with 2 claws only small single claws and you were not allowed to take more than 1 at a time, so I don't know how everyone has photos of plate fulls of them.\\n\\nThe snow crab legs and clusters were all broken apart, (seconds?). There wasn't a single \\"cluster\\" in the entire pot. They were small and so old you couldn't even crack them. They would bend like rubber and never crack. They weren't much better. There was no king crab as the ad stated. There was no lobster bisque soup, nor were there any blue crabs. So, the main thing we went for were completely disappointing. The good reviews they received are very surprising to me. We must have really gone on a bad day is all I can think. What they served us looked nothing like some of the photos on here. Is this place under new management?\\n\\nTo their credit, the other items on the food bars was yummy. I was excited to see Ipswich clams on the bar. They were pretty good, though about twice the size I'm used to. They were in rough shape too, with the shells all broken up and most of the clams shredded and hanging out of their shells and about a third of them completely detached. I wonder about the person complaining of them being sandy and full of seaweed. I can't help but think they don't know how to eat this type of clam. The neck was still on their photo, which will be very sandy if not removed and all the clams still seemed to have their beards still attached and hanging, but that comes off with the neck sheath if eaten properly. They were large and rather tough, and all broken up, but still tasted good and were not sandy tonight at all.\\n\\nThe salads were all very good. They also had various types of mussels and shrimp. There were a couple types of salmon, some mahi, some fried fish, shrimp, pups and mushrooms, rice and mashed potatoes and gravy. There wasn't any asparagus at all, so that was disappointing.\\n\\nThe desserts were typical buffet fare, but they were scarce and well picked through. We didn't visit the ice cream area. See photos.\\n\\nFor the quality and flavor of the food, I would think they would charge at least $10.00 less per person. The quality just wasn't there for the price. We won't be going back. The salads and some items were very good, but not worth over $100 for just 2 people. I was really looking forward to some good lobster eating, but it's just not there. Red lobster has them beat by a mile and for less money. I am very, very disappointed. It was a real let down for both me and my hubby. It was a very expensive and non-satisfying \\"date night\\" for us. Sadly, I would not really recommend them.\\n\\nOne of many disapointed customers, I'm afraid.

And the feelings I had when she uttered where she wanted to go was the feeling I had when I attempted to summon the gumption to write this review: Ambivalence leaning towards blaaaaaah.\\n\\nApparently this place rocks the house when it comes to happy hour, but I've never found the occasion to be here during happy hour nor the inclination to go within 100 yards of this place if I can avoid it. (although I've driven past and saw it visible from Mopac and resisted the urge to flip it the bird.)\\n\\nFirstly, the time's I've been seem to coincide with a rainstorm because the place normally smells slightly mildewy. To be honest it smelled very similar to how the old broken down casinos do Las Vegas. Stale air mixed with vague odors of food and..the mildew smell. Perhaps this was a temporary thing, and maybe they've fixed it since, but the impression was made.\\n\\nThe food tasted reheated and bland, and was extremely overpriced.\\n\\nThe drinks, which were the primary reason we even agreed to go, were somewhat good. Fruity tropical island type mixtures that seemed to try to call to mind Hawaii as the name does. The only thing that truly called to mind hawaii was the price, which for a single drink was more than you'd pay for an entree at a reasonable establishment, and not quite that tasty.\\n\\nBut here's the thing, in regards to both the food and drinks...I don't know if you noticed, but Austin isn't Hawaii. I know you really want it to be - hell, I do, too - but prices you might charge in Hawaii don't really apply to the middle of Texas. I realize why the costs are higher in Hawaii - it's a frickin' island and getting bottles of booze must be slightly more difficult than calling Earl at the distributor and having him ship a freakin' 18-wheeler full to the Domain. Same goes for the food. We're in Texas and the beef dish I had tasted frozen and reheated - this being a chain, I suppose that was probably the case for \\"consistency\\". But if \\"consistency\\" means terrible, then I'm not certain how they manage any reviews over two stars.\\n\\nEDIT:\\nUpdate - not Hawaiian food. Didn't mean to indicate that it was.

I stopped going personally several years ago. But my boss likes the place, so we still have group events there. Ten months ago, someone gave me a small gift card for the restaurant so we finally went last night. \\n\\nThroughout the years, Ray's has been consistent in three areas:\\n- Food: Excellent\\n- Service: Average\\n- Customer Service: Poor\\n\\nI thought last night was going to break the streak. We had a wonderful meal. As usual, the food was awesome and the service was average. We had no difficulties with the evening, so we had no need to interact with their customer service. \\n\\nThen it came time for the check. My gift card expired three weeks earlier. I didn't even think about the possibility that it would expire within the first year. They wouldn't honor it. The server asked management, and as usual... lousy customer service. The answer was an emphatic no. \\n\\nHaving planned group events at Ray's, I've been able to see behind their curtain. Here's my feeling of the place. Management (probably Ray himself) is difficult to work with. That's why the food is consistently great. They're incredibly picky. But the wait staff has a higher than normal turnover for an upscale restaurant, and they don't act like they enjoy their work. They do their job, but don't go the extra mile. They're afraid to bend even the smallest rule because management will chew them out. Follow the rules. No exceptions. That's the Ray's motto. \\n\\nRay's is AWFUL with groups, if you like great customer service. They're arrogant. They act like they're \\"Ray's, an Atlanta establishment.\\" And they do NOTHING to bend over backwards for you. \\n\\nBecause of these factors, the place lacks the energy and passion you find at Chama Gaucha, Chops, Anis Cafe, Houston's, etc. At Ray's, you find a staff that is very good at following rules. Nothing more. Nothing less. \\n\\nIf that's your thing, you'll LOVE Ray's. But if you want to experience fine dining in the ATL at its best, go to one of the restaurants I mentioned earlier. Go to a place that treats its guests and staff well. You'll not only eat amazing food, but you'll experience an atmosphere where everyone - including the staff - enjoys the evening. \\n\\nBTW... the gift card I mentioned?  It was for TWENTY dollars. They ended the evening on a sour note over a twenty dollar gift card.

I ordered the polenta with mushrooms and gorgonzola sauce. It was excellent!  The sauce was not heavy.  Heavenly.  My husband had the Rigatonni with sausage.  Amazing!

We've been here twice -- first when it just opened, and mostly recently, just last night. Can't say that the experience improves over time. Actually, it's the opposite.\\n\\nThis time, our evening began with a head-to-head battle. We wanted the Navajo fry bread, Blue corn enchiladas, and Crispy folded tacos. And just a beer. No cocktails, please. Simple, no? But then our waitress countered with a rapid machine gun fire of upselling. Really, no cocktails? What about our Pork special? Salad to go with? Avocado on your tacos? Avocado on the enchiladas? Extra enchilada? Extra mushrooms on the enchilada? Good god. Have you ever gone to battle with the waitstaff? Thoroughly offputting. Felt like we had to defend our choices. And while you will most likely win, you will feel bludgeoned and shamed for wanting what you want. \\n\\nNote: Menu entrees range in price from $16 (crispy folded tacos) to $35 (lamb neck). Seemed like they were trying to push their more expensive menu items. But what if you just want the $16 taco plate (which was tasty)? Or the $18 enchilada plate (which was most definitely not)? \\n\\nOn that note, about the food: It's mostly decent. I highly recommend the Navajo fry bread in its latest incarnation. On a previous visit, we liked the half chicken and king salmon (though you can get a better version of these at Oak at Fourteenth, shrug). The crispy tacos (with pork and/or veggies) are great. Some may like the beef tongue (codename: bison lengua), but it was not for me. Too gamey and chewy. Like you're chewing on a... tongue. Enchiladas were a semi-organized but crowded mass (or mess?) of food on a plate. Missing key flavors and very unmemorable. Gotta be honest, it made us miss the simple, low-key enchiladas at Oskar Blues. \\n\\nAnd the dessert: Really hit or miss. Apple and green chile pie? Solid miss. It was much too soft and more like a cobbler. The surface of the pie was oatmeal-like. Would have much preferred a well-executed slice of regular good ol' apple pie with their Fantastic green chile cheesecake ice cream on the side. Tip: Stick with their ice cream.\\n\\nPleasant atmosphere. Bonus points for opening up an outdoor patio.

And my friend and I were looking for something unique and sweet to eat.  I had never been to Toothsome Chocolate Emporium, but felt like a splurge.  \\n\\nSince it was so stormy out, I wanted to know if there was a long wait because if there was, we would be waiting in the rain for a while.  So I called the number listed on their page and got CityWalk guest services.  I asked what the seating was like there, and the lady said that they don't do reservations so there is no way of knowing.  Huh?  I asked if she could call them to see how busy they are so we'd know if we were going to be waiting in the rain or not.  She said sorry, can't do it.  Sigh. Every other restaurant in the country you can call to find out wait times, but not at Universal.  \\n\\nSo we took our chances and headed out in the rain to the Emporium.  Fortunately, they weren't busy and we were seated right away, on the second floor by the window with a view no less!  Cool!  The steam punk theming is really cool, and everything from the menu to the restrooms is themed. Kristal was our server and she did a great job of making recommendations and explaining the menu. I ordered the French onion soup ($6.95) and confetti milkshake ($14.50).  My friend ordered the broccoli and cheddar soup ($6.95) and the red velvet milkshake ($13.50) and a Too Chocolate Stout ($9.50).  \\n\\nThe stout was amazing!  So chocolatey and good.  The soups were delicious too.  So warm and savory, perfect for a rainy night!  \\n\\nThe milkshakes were perfect in presentation.  So fun to look at! I particularly enjoyed the sprinkles pasted on the side with buttercream. The taste though was not as great.  Mine tasted like they took a piece of birthday cake and stirred it in some melted ice cream.  Which actually was what it was!  Not a terrible combination, but it had a very odd mouth feel.  The whipped cream was wonderful. The piece of confetti cake on top was dense, slightly dry, and the buttercream had an off flavor like it was a little stale.  My friend said the cupcake on his was also dry and dense.  Neither of us finished the milkshakes. For that price, I really expected a much higher quality confection.  \\n\\nWe were excited when we saw Doctor Penelope Tibeaux-Tinker Toothsome checking in on tables and adding her flair to the experience, but strangely she didn't stop at every table and passed us by.  It wasn't a particularly busy night, and we were disappointed not to have interacted with her.  \\n\\nIn all I really liked the atmosphere.

The Blackbelly Butchery's lunch, Blackbelly Restaurant's dinner, the breakfast burritos in the mornings, the attention to detail. Oh and the level of service at his restaurants is always perfection. That's why this is so difficult.\\n\\nFirst let's start at the most disappointing bit, the cocktails. My wife got the Taose√±o. Could hardly taste the bourbon, rye, and cognac, it was obviously over dilluted, and the only thing that stood out was the anaheim pepper which almost overpowered the entire drink. First drink I had was the ZIA. Also over dilluted, and couldn't taste anything except the pompelmousse. At the end of dinner I decided to give the Nitro Mezcal Manhattan a try. Now THAT is a cocktail! Only problem, it was served under chilled. I could tell they don't chill the glasses, and they didn't do the proper amount of stirring to achieve chilling equilibrium.\\n\\nOnto the food. We started with the Wood Oven Queso as our appetizer, added chorizo. I thought it was decent, but it was almost insultingly chincy considering that was 14 dollars. The chorizo had a really nice flavor, it was of the smokier and sweeter kind, nice pick for this application. On the menu it said it came with \\"fresh tortillas\\". The tortilla (singular) came almost cold, so there was nothing \\"fresh\\" or \\"tortillaS\\" about it. Couldn't taste the red pepper jelly, so something was definitely off with execution. But again, the cheese in this was really good, the chorizo was good, just some execution issues along the way. Nothing that can't be fixed.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the Navajo Fry Bread. It was advertised as having pork adovada. That was not adovada. It was like sweet southern BBQ pork. The fry bread was excellent, the 4 handfuls of slaw on top was not. You could barely taste the combination of flavors because it was drowned in mounds of slaw. Balance is everything, and lack of it seems to be the recurring theme at Santo so far.\\n\\nI asked for the Smashed Green Chile Cheeseburger, medium rare. Was cooked perfectly. I did this because I knew it would be similar to the burger at Blackbelly, and wanted to see how they made it stand apart. That chile aioli was perfect, excellent recipe on that. The tots were very nice, and I loved the creative shape and presentation. Burger was cooked perfectly. House ketchup is great. The only downside with this was the bun was underdone and came out floppy and no crunch on it. Minor issue.\\n\\nFor dessert we tried the Green Chile Ice Cream. Holy hell, what an awesome idea, tasted super good, and kinda blew my mind. I love new ideas in desserts since it's usually the most boring dish to me at dinner, and I rarely get it at restaurants as a result.\\n\\nTo sum up there needs to be some pretty major improvements here, and Chef Rosenberg is no stranger to making big improvements at his released restaurants (Blackbelly had a rocky start as well), so I have complete confidence he will quickly nip these issues in the bud. I don't see any pricing difference between this and Blackbelly and yet I felt like it was either chincy portions, cheap execution, and disappointing by comparison. Dramatically disappointing.\\n\\nI love the concept and the vision, the decor, and of course the service was absolutely perfect. My wife commented that it reminded her of Machete (a great modern take on Mexican food) in Denver, one of our favorite places, in a New Mexican concept but not execution to the same standards.\\n\\nMy advice: Balance and execution across the board need to step up significantly. Don't slam so much slaw onto the fry bread and actually make the pork taste like pork adovada. Execute that burger bun on point every time, because that is crucial to a good burger eating experience. The queso needs to be made \\"less sad\\", because getting one cold tortilla doesn't scream \\"fresh tortillas\\", and the portions for a queso were insultingly chincy for a 14 dollar appetizer. Your bartenders need to read Dave Arnold's research on ice, chilling, and dillution ratios. Google \\"Cocktail Science in General: Part 1 of 2\\" by Dave Arnold, and go from there. This is much more important than people think. The drinks also suffered from my own trademarked (not really) phrase \\"Big Container Syndrome\\". You make a huge container your vessel, and any attempt to fill it means you have to do one of two things... Overserve, or fill with juice/water/soda/syrups/etc... aka not booze. What happens is, the drinks look right in the glass, but they turn out an unbalanced mess unless you bring your pour from 1.5 oz to 3 or 4 oz of liquor, which isn't responsible. I get the feeling that they didn't have quite a Ben Foote-level bartender in charge of designing this cocktail menu the way they did at Blackbelly. Time to go back to the drawing board. But keep the Nitro Mezcal Manhattan. Please. Also... A draft margarita really shouldn't be priced that high. I expect to pay that much for a fresh margarita."},{"name":"China Jade","address":"6104 Boardwalk St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"My boyfriend and I were on our way home and in an old part of town where we used to live.

It didn't even taste like orange chicken. It just looks like it is swimming in some dark brown salty sauce. Not even spicy like orange chicken is supposed to be. Not an ounce of spice. It was blah. I choose orange chicken for the crispy, the sweet and the spice and I got soggy, mushy salty yuck. I could only stomach a few bites and the same with my boyfriend. We both were not impressed. I nibbled on the egg roll because I was so hungry I was shaky and wanted some food. The egg roll wasn't even good and I couldn't even finish that.

The food was tasty and fresh, particularly liked the Bad Dog Bread (another great local shop) and the tomato jam on the eggs. Our table was in between the bathroom and the front door and as people started coming in and lining up it felt like we had people standing on top of us. While I have no issues with lining up, it would be a better experience for those at that one particular table to not feel crowded. The recommendation is that people be asked to wait closer to the door or outside. (Fine in the summer less so when it rains of course).

I have not been to Lamberts in a while so was excited to return and did remember it was very good.  I parked at the City Hall Garage which is next to Lamberts where It has no parking. The building itself is very historic and had huge heavy doors as an entrance. We went inside to find a lot of people eating but luckily we got a table. That place definitely has character.\\n\\nWe were given menus and small biscuits as an appetizer which were so soft, warm, and good. Drinks listed on one side and food options on the other. Besides barbecue brunch was available to. I ordered the Lamberts Old School Bacon Benedict along with a Mimosa. The place was not too loud but felt very comfortable. One thing I noticed was the whole place smelled like smoke and was stuck with you all day. I explored a bit where I found a second story with another bar and a small stage.\\n\\nThe food arrived and it looked very good. I tasted my Benedict and it was farm fresh.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and nice a salad was part of it.  It was truly and amazing meal and my Mimosa was not bad either. My brother had the slow cooked barbecue chicken and my wife had brisket, and I tried both and it was excellent with nice smoked taste. I had some of my wife's sides where the Herbed Waffle Fries and Baked Mac & Cheese was also delicious.  With the staff coming around refilling drinks you had that fine dining experience which stood above the rest in the barbecue places in Austin. \\n\\nOverall this place was once again a top choice and everyone in my party was completely satisfied.

I bought a living social deal for this place for 5 passes and I will NOT be returning to use the rest.

Upon arrival, I found an empty 40oz beer bottle just sitting on the ground in the outdoor play area. \\n2. The fence there is inadequate. There is a large gap between the fence in the building which would allow a child to get out and immediately be next to a busy street. \\n3. There are exposed electrical outlets all over the outside of the building. I don't mean that they're missing the \\"toddler plugs\\" in the holes - you could literally stick your finger behind the plug faces on one of them and probably touch wires.\\n4. There were barberry bushes all over the place in the outdoor play space, which have thorns and seem like an odd choice for landscaping for a children's play area. \\n5. Toys were filthy as if they hadn't been rinsed off in years. I understand that outdoor playtoys must get very dirty, but this was ridiculous. I didn't even want my kids to touch over half of what was there. Could have easily been fixed by hosing them down!\\n6. Many of the outdoor playhouse structures we so broken down that I found them to be dangerous. One of the wooden playhouse structures had the remnants of what once was a plastic casing around the windows. It was broken and jagged and there were plastic shards sticking out at eye level. I broke most of them off and threw them out myself. \\n\\nThe menu looked nice and I really wanted to like this place.

We where given a pot of (semi cold ) green tea to fill our own drinks and our own pitcher of water.

Confused, we just agreed (we where full anyways but I did want to eat the chicken and not waste it) he never gave us the written bill, just said the total ($70) I was confused since this was way priced then last time.

Typically, I can scrounge up one other human that will enjoy the pleasure of my company between the hours of 5-7, but today, no such luck.  I was so hungry and had been craving the $8 hanger steak that Lambert's has during happy hour for what seemed like an eternity.  \\n\\nIt was \\"get-over-yourself\\" time, time to go to happy hour and order a steak and sit by yourself.  See most people who go to happy hour at Lambert's go with someone else, or a few other people and trying to socialize with them is seemingly impossible.  Weird, right?  Maybe it's because people are more uptight, less friendly in the second street district?  I don't know.  That is what I've found. Your mileage may vary.\\n\\nAnyway, back to the steak.  So I was able to snag the absolute last chair in the bar area, ordered an Imperial Pint of beer and the hanger steak, medium rare.  I had barely drunk a quarter of my beer before the steak was delivered.  I've got three words for this dish: \\"holy shit balls.\\"  Seriously, it's slap your-momma-good.  It was good I was sitting.  And actually, it was not the steak that gave me the first-bite-weak-in-the-knees-glad-I'm-sitting-down-swoon, it was the combo bite of avocado and the fried egg in the hole.  Everything about that bite was perfection: even though the egg looked slightly undercooked, it was perfect, the toast, perfectly toasted, the avocado, the best avocado ever, and the synergy of the three was divine.  \\n\\nThe steak was good, but was more on the medium side (next time I'll order it straight up rare) and it was a little thinner than typical hanger steak, and slightly less flavorful.  Maybe just a less than perfect cut, overcooked for my taste.  I will still always order this now as much for the avocado and egg-in-hole as for the steak.  And it is a generous portion, really, the steak could be two thirds as big and this would still be a phenomenal deal.  \\n\\nIt was good that I was sitting alone, in a corner, because I joined the clean plate club in under 15 minutes.  No one needed to see me demolish that plate.  To give you a sense of scale, it took me another 30 minutes after finishing the steak to finish my beer.  \\n\\nAnd what did I do for 30 minutes nursing a beer by myself at Lambert's?  Contemplate the universe, read the Onion, and people-watch, of course.  One thing I have been contemplating is how to validate psuedoscientific claims such as this one: is there a Brotherhood of the Hot Levi's going on at Lambert's?

From that time on, the bartender NEVER came back to check on us. Thirty minutes later, my husband flagged HIM down and it still took him an additional 5 minutes before he finally came over.

His answer was curt ... \\"NO.\\" He could have said, \\"I typically don't make mocktails but if you had something in mind, I can try to make that.\\" He was rude to say the least.

Unlike most bad habits, I don't think I should break this one.  LIKE most bad habits, I have no *desire* to break this one.\\n\\nLast day of Austin Restaurant Week this week, so I decided last night that I would try out Kona for lunch today.  I've been invited to Kona many times, but have never gone, and I'm such a sucker for ARW, so...  I made the reservation via Open Table for one because it was, like, 3am when I made it so it was too late to see if anybody else wanted to join me.  I'm sure a reservation for one at 1:30 wasn't necessary, but you never know with ARW.  Next morning I convinced Errol to tag along.\\n\\nSo we get there, and I explain to the hostess that I've got a reservation for one at 1:30, but asked if it would be possible to seat two instead.\\n\\nHOSTESS:  No, not possible.\\nME:  Really?\\nHOSTESS:  It's just too busy in here.\\nME:  [looking around at the vacant restaurant, confused, then finally realizing she was kidding]  Aw, gee, I guess we'll have to go elsewhere, then.\\n\\nShe got me good, I admit it.\\n\\nOur waitress was Mandy, and I have to say that she's probably the bestest, most awesomest waitress ever born.  She was welcoming, friendly, outgoing, easy to talk to, chipper, on-the-ball, etc, etc, etc.  She came around to check on us just often enough, but not too often.  That's the mark of a good server.\\n\\nOkay, so... I got caesar salad, the Bama roll (crab mix, cream cheese, jalapeno in soy paper, topped with tuna, fish roe, and spicy mayo), and the passion fruit creme brulee.  Luckily, Mandy let me know that avocado came on the roll (why the hell is that not listed in the description?!), so I was able to put a halt to that possible allergic madness.  She talked me into keeping the jalapeno.  I'm not going to bother telling you peeps what Errol ordered because, chances are, he'll crank out his finished review before I'm even halfway done with mine.\\n\\nCaesar salad was decent, but I didn't have a chance to eat much of it before the entrees arrived.  Mandy admitted they came out too soon, so props to her for realizing.  No matter, I was done with the salad anyway.  The roll was quite good, and I don't even like crab.  I picked out the jalapeno, yet the roll was still spicy, which I lurved.  I'm not sure what else in the roll gave it a kick (as the spicy mayo was on the side), but whatever it was, I loved it.  Ate every bite... with a fork.  Before you accuse me of being some idiot American wimp who can't use chopsticks, please allow me to explain how wide this roll was.  I realized I wouldn't be able to fit each piece adequately in my mouth as a whole without looking like some jungle-raised white-trash fool, so I did Errol and everyone else in the restaurant a favor and cut the roll into manageable pieces.  You're welcome.\\n\\nMost of our conversation was about older pop culture.  I'm normally the go-to person on that subject, but Errol successfully made me feel like a yesteryear-pop culture noob.\\n\\nERROL:  Have you ever seen that movie about a band that was modeled after Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band?\\nME:  I don't think so.\\nERROL:  The band name was, like, John Beaver and the Buttheads, or something.\\nME:  Beavis and Butthead??\\nERROL:  Not that recent.\\nME:  I figured, but I can't think of any band that sounds like what you're spewing out.\\n\\nOnce we got outside (because reception sucks inside Kona), Errol looked it up.  Turns out it was John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band, from the 1983 movie Eddie and the Cruisers.  Sure, I've heard of it, but I've never seen it.  But how Errol got John Beaver and the Buttheads from John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band, I'll never figure out.\\n\\nSecond Catherine-noob moment:\\n\\nERROL:  [still trying to think of Eddie and the Cruisers] That one actor from The Big Chill was in it.  He played an actor in the movie.\\nME:  Uhhh... I've only seen The Big Chill twice, but... Jeff Goldblum?  William Hurt?  Kevin Kline?  Glen Close??  JoBeth Williams???\\nERROL:  You've got, like, six of the seven.\\nME:  Figures.\\n\\nIt was Tom Berenger.  I did so much better at the pop-culture tourney last week at Jim's.\\n\\nAnyway, the passion fruit creme brulee was too sweet.  The hostess warned it would be.  I figured the brownie sundae thing would be way too calorific and carby, so I shied away from it.  Sickly sweet didn't keep me from eating every speck of creme brulee, but I was a bit disappointed with it.\\n\\nAll the food I had was slightly above average, but not quite there.  The reason Kona gets four stars is because Mandy was so awesome-sauce.\\n\\nP.S.  Errol donated money to some feed-the-children cause at Kona  and got some coupon for a free flatbread, or some such.  One lucky girl at the Yelp party tomorrow is going to get it.  But don't mow Errol over with your enthusiasm and saccharine faux love, because he's already decided who's getting it.

That was a sweet little addition. \\nSecond, I thought the ambiance and decor was lovely. It was very rustic but classy, so it felt upscale and homey at the same time. \\nLastly, I remember the wine was outstanding. It was a Moscato white wine (can't remember the name, sorry!) and it was absolutely amazing. My boyfriend doesn't like wine at all but he drank the entire glass and we got the rest of the bottle because it was just that good. \\n\\nHere is the main reason why I give it three stars. \\nSo, it's obvious that this restaurant serves food that is more pricey and upscale. Every entree is at least $20, and the sides are not included. Also, our food took at least 30 minutes to come out. We were starving and had been waiting all day for this meal. The server seemed displeased when I asked about the status of our food. That was annoying. I didn't like his attitude about that. Also, my boyfriend's steak was not cooked the way he wanted. He asked for medium rare and it was basically well done. We told our server about it and again, he seemed annoyed and gave us attitude when we asked for it to be cooked correctly. Following that, my boyfriend waited another 20-25 minutes for his new steak to come out. By this time, I had already finished my meal. It was just a downer on this special higher we had planned. \\n\\nOverall, I'd say the restaurant itself is beautiful and exquisite.

Perhaps the \\"spread\\" was made of eggplant, and sun dried tomatoes? But that's not what I expected, based on the wording in the menu.

That being said, my girlfriend and I had a number of minor reservations about yesterday's meal at Moshi. \\n\\nIt was a warm day, so we decided to sit outside on their patio. We were the only ones out there to start, and I get the distinct impression that the servers forgot about us occasionally. We had the menu for about ten minutes and had questions about it before we could order. We ordered a drink (a lychee mojito, which was delicious) and were left to select our four rolls after our questions were answered. Another ten minutes passed before our drink came and our order was taken...and then the *real* wait was on. We wound up waiting at least twenty-five minutes before our order came out, and if the rolls were of a decent size, we would have been okay with it...but these were seriously among the smallest rolls I've seen at a sushi restaurant. My girlfriend's tuna rolls were about the diameter of a quarter, and my futomaki and shrimp tempura rolls -- \\"big\\" rolls at most restaurants -- weren't much larger. Given the cost of the rolls, were were certainly quite disappointed, not to mention still rather hungry. The bill for four rolls and a drink was $50, and combined with the long wait, we really can't justify returning or recommending Moshi, even though the quality was pretty good and the servers were nice.\\n\\nOn the plus side, there's a Jeni's next door, so if you *do* decide to try Moshi, you'll have a Plan B for dessert."},{"name":"Massimino's","address":"207 Endicott St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Absolutely the most delicious Seafood Fra'Diavlo!! \\nThe seafood was incredibly fresh & the sauce was delicious.

Typically, the food is very good, and though the service varies, it is generally reasonable to good.\\nWe went there today, and while it wasn't terrible, it could have been a lot better.  Funny - my complaints from 4 years ago are still valid.\\nI ordered a Gyro Deluxe with Greek Salad, no customizations.  It arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  The portion size was pretty good - I would have had leftovers if I hadn't been so hungry.  The taste was excellent.\\nMy son (now 10) was thrilled to see the \\"Hungry Man Burger\\" (a double bacon cheeseburger) return to the menu after an absence.  He placed his order with many customizations.  Once again, our waitress did NOT write the order down!  Even my son noticed this and commented to me.  And once again, they got his order wrong.  They remembered lettuce-wrap and no onions, but did not remember to substitute Swiss cheese for American.  Fortunately, my son was ok with the American.  The waitress apologized and offered to bring a different patty... we declined.  It was a nice gesture, but one that would have been totally unnecessary if she had just WRITTEN DOWN our order when we placed it.\\nMy son's food was undercooked.  There was pink inside the burger... pink might be nice for a steak, but hamburgers should be cooked well-done for safety (unless requested otherwise).  Also, his bacon was very chewy, and he decided not to eat it.  We will request crispy bacon next time.\\nAfter I placed my order, I showed the waitress my coupon, which she took at that time.  When we received our check, she had forgotten to apply it.  I pointed that out; she apologized, and quickly returned with a corrected check.\\nAgain, the glasses for water were small, and the waitress only came by once during the entire meal to refill our drinks.  It was not pleasant for me to have to eat so much of my meal with nothing to drink.\\nFinally, once we were finished, we had to wait a long time to get our check and take-away boxes.  Once the waitress came by, she cleared our dishes and went to get the check.  But she was surrounded by other customers (friends?) at the counter, and it took a long time for her to return.  Once she returned with our (corrected) check, I put my credit card in the tray and waited... and waited.  She didn't say that we needed to bring it to the counter... I had assumed that she would return to our table.  After waiting for a while, I just got up and brought it to the counter.  Not a big deal, but I wish she would have told me this was necessary, so I wouldn't have waited for her to return.\\nAnd just like in my previous review, despite there being a child at the table, we were only offered one napkin per person.  My son is a bit messy, and could have used an extra napkin sooner.  I used my napkin to kill about half a dozen flies at the table, and so I needed a new napkin too.\\n\\nWe will probably return.  We will ask for well-done burgers and crispy bacon.  We might insist that the server WRITES DOWN our order to get it right the first time.  I will probably mention that I drink a lot of water, and ask for a pitcher (or more frequent service).  Their gyros and greek salads are very tasty.

Two types of salsa in plastic squeeze bottles appear on the table after you sit down,  so it's safe to assume large amounts of salsa hang out at room temperature in the course of a day.  The food comes out with the cook, or the dishwasher, not sure which, but that's probably to help cut down on waitstaff to keep the food prices high.  Oh, wait...

She was patient, caring, sincere, and above all amazingly detailed. From the moment we toured the ballroom with her, we knew this was our venue. The Texas Ballroom was everything we wanted; luxury, style, and EXTREMELY spacious for our expected 200 guests. The combination of Elizabeth's customer service and the amazing ballroom was absolutely perfect! As we continued to work with Mrs. Cohn, we met other employees at The Hyatt who ALL seemed so pleased to help us each time. Even valet parking our vehicles when we stopped by (without notice!) to ask more questions or drop off a payment - for free. The tasting was our FAVORITE part - maybe even topping our wedding day... almost. The food from Chef (I forgot his name! help!) was absolutely delicious - everything we chose from the menu seemed to be the perfect fit for our wedding. We even had the chance to taste the H'orderves and midnight snacks. With the help of our wonderful coordinator and the chef, we picked out the perfect menu. Now, not all weddings are perfect, so when our coordinator Elizabeth called to say she was moving away, I became very afraid that our great experience and planning had JUST ended with her leaving. After all, she was a HUGE part of us choosing The Hyatt Regency. As we became more frightened about our event, I called numerous times to check on different items for our wedding and Justin - the most incredible assistant coordinator - calmed me down each time and reassured us that the coordinator taking over our event would be just as great. And he was right - Elizabeth passed the torch to coordinator Ms. Brandi Bailey and our great experience ...well... only got BETTER. She was AMAZING! I was thrilled to have all the details in place and on the day of, have a trustworthy and super sweet lady like Brandi there to run things. The day of our wedding had its down sides (because of other terrible vendors, but don't get me started on them!) but The Hyatt Regency NEVER failed us.

From the cold cuts that I ate from, the sandwich was simply ok-- a nice blend of hots, pickles, onions, salt and pepper but otherwise lacked something. And I couldn't put my finger on it then and still can;t put my finger on it now.\\n\\nThe marinated steak tip sandwich was ATROCIOUS and brought this review down to 2 stars from 3 stars. The steak was not moist and extremely tough. The provolone cheese that I ordered to accompany the sandwich was almost burned into the sub bread--just not the way that the cheese should be served. Worst off, the marinade was a SUPER SWEET barbeque and pineapple sauce mix. It couldn't finish the sandwich because it tasted so bad. What a terrible item and mix of flavors. \\n\\nJust avoid.

Not a good sign. I would assume, especially with the hospital across the street, that they would have a brisk business.\\n\\nSo I ordered a slice of pizza to go. One thing I noted right away was that the pizza behind the glass that were available by the slice was not the most appetizing looking, but the true test would be in the taste.\\n\\nOn a positive note, the pizza was better than it looked. On a negative note, it was still a pretty poor example of pizza. While it was a nice thinness, the sauce was bland and it was a bit scant on the cheese. It was a bit too greasy, as well. While a great pizza should be greasy, this slice was not greasy in a good way.\\n\\nI guess that if I had to choose this pizza over hospital food, I would go with the pizza.

We got drinks within minutes and we're also escorted to the end of the bar where there was additional bar seating we didn't see at first. Margaritas were outstanding!! We tried the house margs on the rocks and then had the superior, which is served straight up with an olive--Austin style. The complimentary chips and salsas (smokey red and bright cilantro green) were tasty. We shared the ceviche appetizer, which is big enough to have as an entree, and followed that by sharing the camerones brochetas. All was excellent!!

My friends and I immediately went upstairs to grab wine and a seat to await the view & obligatory sunset pic. The line to order our drinks was a little long, but pretty normal for Austin.

Everyone is polite and provides suggestions and service when approached.\\n\\nFood and drink: Classy. Flavorful. Well-presented. Since the restaurant doesn't exactly have a focus for type of food, everything came with a bit of an American touch. I did appreciate the care in building the sushi to give it a great mix of flavors and a strong plating. Nothing here is overly pretentious but you definitely feel taken care of.\\nThe prickly pear margarita was a great pick, just a tad on the sweet side. Great color and pretty good prickly pear flavor for being in the US where the actual fruit does not really exist.\\n\\nBar: We were seated here while waiting for a table. The drinks were average and we didn't get any particularly special attention from the bartender, but he did attend to all our requests - water, napkins, menu, etc.\\n\\nParking: The waiters were awesome about validating parking in the deck.\\n\\nI'm not sure the story behind BrickTops closing - maybe the awkward location in that huge building - but it had my approval.

The staff are incredibly kind and friendly, but not the disingenuous friendliness that you sometimes see at other establishments.  My sister and I stopped here on our road trip from Washington to Southern California, and the sugar pick-me-up hit the spot perfectly.  I can't wait to order more the next time I'm passing through Portland!"},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I was pretty impressed with all the flavors they had to offer. Their doughnuts are also made fresh so I was amaze by how crispy they were! My favorite has to be the maple bacon."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"This place is avg for food and service, domestic beer is reasonably priced although like most establishments these days they charge an arm and a leg for a margarita that costs the them the same but for the most part is less. It's all about the view here and if you want to get a good seat by the rail for the view before the umbrellas come down you need to wait. Started with a giant bowl of Taco soup that was really chili soup and a dinner in itself. My Fajitas combo of chicken and steak came without the steak and they delivered it as a side dish. Both were extremely tender but lacked flavor.  Quantity was ample so no complaints although they could provide more condiments e.g. sour cream and guacamole.  Endless chips and salsa."},{"name":"Masala Dhaba","address":"75 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent food and great service!!
