I didn't get her name but she was a beautiful woman, Black with red hair in like 2 French braids... she had a wonderful attitude and was chatting up guests and seemed to be genuinely trying to make sure everyone was having a wonderful experience.  \\n\\nSo I was in a rush, so I took my food as a to-go order (though I REALLY wanted to dine in).   I ordered the eggs, grits, and the potatoes, all from the A La Carte menu.  The cashier was fairly out of it: he didn't pay attention to my order when I told it to him, kept having to repeat it, had to wait a fairly lengthy amount of time to even have him come up and take my order, and then when my food was finally finished, he didn't attempt to let me know or anything.  I just happened to wonder if the large bag sitting there was mine, wandered up, and asked him and he wasn't even very helpful then.  He didn't give me a fork/knife, even though none of my food was finger food.  Like seriously, how am I supposed to eat grits without a fork or spoon?! Or eggs?!  When I pointed his out to him and asked for plastic utensils, he said \\"Oh there should be one in there.\\"  I checked the bag and NOPE. So then he finally went to get some.  No sense of urgency or anything.  Just out of it.  He shouldn't be taking/preparing orders if he can't get it together.\\n\\nFood wise, the grits were some of the best I've had at a restaurant.  Great consistency, not too runny and not too thick.  The potatoes were amazing, I actually wished I had ordered a double portion, and ate them super quickly.  The eggs were absolute garbage, I threw them in the trash without even tasting them when I opened the container and saw that they looked like a melted yellow crayon.  Disgusting.  I ordered them scrambled so they shouldn't have been runny/liquidy.  \\n\\nAmbience-wise, the interior was nice enough and seemed like a pleasant place to have a weekday brunch.

The scallion pancakes $4 (either 6 or 8 pieces... I forget) were crispy chewy... in fact, if they were only a bit thicker, they could have potentially rivaled my favorite and first experience, which was homemade, layery, crispy, chewy goodness from one of the take-out counters located in what was once the food court on a 2nd floor of Chinatown (RIP).\\n\\nThe Unagi Kabyaki $7.25 came with an amount of eel that I wouldn't exactly call skimpy, but totally was not enough to outlast the rice provided.\\n\\n3 stars\\n\\n*** 2nd visit within a month ***\\n\\nThis time I decided to go with the new eel sushi combo for $14 that came with my choice of teas, and to add an order of the sweet potato fries appetizer $3.25.\\n\\nMy milk tea came out first and was delivered to me as I waited for the rest of my take-out order.

No good.\\n\\nI took it back to the counter and commented that I've had milk tea before and it tasted nothing like this - this one tasted strange to me.  Another fella who was neither the one who had both taken my order and delivered my drink volunteered to make me a new one.\\n\\nThis new one was much better, much more like what I had been expecting.  This 2nd guy told me that he had used the same tea, but this time had given it a good mixing with a spoon.  I guess they don't always mix their drinks well before serving it.  Not good practice, I think, but I did appreciate that he had taken my displeasure with my drink seriously.\\n\\nThe fries consisted of 10 long planks of sweet potato fried in a puffy tempura batter and served with a spicy sauce.  The tempura lent just a touch of crispness to each bite.\\n\\nThe selection of maki rolls that came in my order were 6 pieces each of eel & avocado and eel & cucumber, and 4 pieces of tempura eel.  All were tasty, but the smaller rolls were not very well wrapped.  And I had no idea what I would be getting with the third choice seeing as I couldn't locate it on the menu, but from my look at the cross-section of it, it seems it is eel that has been tempura fried all on its own, plus avocado, cucumber, and tobiko.\\n\\n4 stars."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The ambiance is great.

You know... one of the signature Items.... well the portion size first of all was an absolute joke. It was delivered in a paper cone, and then tipped onto the plate and I just thought \\"ok so where is the rest?\\". As you can see from the picture, the fish was an insult to fish around the world. It was very soft, breaded (kinda like a chick fil a sandwich that's been sat in the foil bag for too long), square shaped.

Everything else is very much southern (think po' boys, fritters, hush puppies, etc) \\n\\nThis place is very oddly lit. Is it dark with really bright lights in the parking lot? Are there just bad fixtures? Seemed clean enough except for the floors being disturbingly sticky. Noticed this while waiting forever to place our order.

Instead of light and fluffy, they were too dense and greasy inside with a slightly overdone outside. Jumbo shrimp themselves were excellent. \\n\\nI had a pound of shrimp, saut√©ed.

I recommend asking for extra crispy, since the tomato goodness and grease of the meats can make the center a little soft.

We weren't asked if we wanted anything else to drink, but their is a display case of bottled sodas.  Tea is in the back of the restaurant and is self serve.  The tea has a strong cardamom flavor with a familiarity I couldn't pin down.  After a few minutes I realized I was tasting the same cardamom flavor of Pan Parag Pan Masala (type of betel nut)!  It was hot but refreshing at the same time.\\n\\nWe started off with three appetizers: baba ganoush , something called kadh o bademjoon, and hummus.  The hummus was my favorite.  It was very smooth and creamy; very different than other versions out there.  The baba ganoush had an almost burnt flavor.  I liked it, but probably the least.  The kadh o wasn't the prettiest dish, but it had a nice tart flavor from the eggplant skins.  these were all served with a basket of toasted pita bread.  The pita bread was dense and a little hard, but that was a good contrast to the three smoothly pureed starters.\\n\\nMy entree was the lamb shank accompanied by rice and a salad ($13.99).  The salad itself was just a basic lettuce, onion, and tomato with Italian dressing, but it was a nice accent to the other meal components.  The rice had a buttery flavor and they give you an extra pat of butter to add.  The shank was fall off the bone tender accompanied by a rich broth.  I dusted everything with the sumac powder and had one of the better lunches I can recall in quite sometime.  I had a bite of both the ground chicken and beef kabobs and realized its hard to go wrong with anything you order here.

Luckily, he obliges me when I say I prefer Flour over Sweetgreen. \\n\\nSince I hadn't done vegetarian all week, I opted for the grilled cauliflower melt. My friend tried the chicken and broccoli-rabe panini. We split the tophat cupcake which I had been eyeing for weeks. We were both surprised at the texture of the frosting.

There is not much selection on the menu. There are a selection of small appetizer dishes and only one entr√©e - Chinese Sauerkraut Fish. If you cannot handle spicy, more specifically the numbing spice, and don't like sour foods, this spot will not be for you. Also, don't let the pictures fool you on the spice levels. Just because the colour of sauerkraut fish broth isn't a flaming red doesn't mean it will be milder than the average Sichuan spice. I would say it is at least 5 times spicier than your regular Sichuan boiled fish dish. \\n\\nI went on a weeknight for my first visit, after they had only been open for about a month. It was crazy how packed the place was on Wednesday night. We had made a reservation, but since we were running 10 minutes late, we ended up having to wait about 10 minutes for the next available table as they were not able to hold our original table. We also realized we had made a mistake coming in a large group of 7 because the largest table barely fit 6 people. After my initial experience with this spot, I just learned to avoid the dinner rush and only go in smaller groups. Also, I think now that they have been around for a while, they are not as packed as they were when they first opened. \\n\\nThis place is quite pricey, but honestly not by much compared to other spicy boiled fish dishes in the area, especially considering they are not using cheap cod or basa fillets. The whole fish is completely deboned and sliced thinly with the skin on. The head and tail of the fish is deep fried and served in the broth as well. I have had an occasion where I ordered the largest size (\\"boss\\" size), which is supposed to have 3 whole fish's worth of meat, but the heads and tails were not served. This made me question if there is actually 3 whole fish in the dish. \\n\\nThe sauerkraut is made in-house, which I think really makes a difference. I am not usually a big fan of sauerkraut, but I found their sauerkraut a very refreshing in the broth and deepens the flavour of the other spices in the broth. It also lightens up the dish too, not making you feel too bloated after you're done. \\n\\nYou can get add-ins for the broth as well, such as noodles, mushrooms, tofu etc. Note that these add-ins cost extra for the two smaller sizes, but 2 add-ins come free with the largest size. Quite frankly, if not included, I would skip the add-ons because the portions are quite small and price tag is high. My suggestion instead would be to order a bowl of rice to have on the side. The rice paired with the sauerkraut fish make for a perfect match, and helps cut the spice. \\n\\nThe side dishes are worth a try, but a little pricey in my opinion. I have tried the chicken wings, the sliced beef in chili oil, and the sweet rice cakes. Based on the side dishes I have tried, I would say you can forgo the wings and the beef, but the rice cakes are a must try. The others were good, but nothing special. Focus on the sauerkraut fish. \\n\\nThe staff, like at most Richmond restaurants, are very no-frills, so there is not much to comment on in terms of service. The restaurant atmosphere is hip and young. My relatives from China told me that the franchise locations in China will not let you pack leftovers to go and have a strict 4 person/table limit, so they quite appreciate the flexibility/courtesy of this overseas location. However, taste-wise they still prefer the locations in China, though the Richmond branch is close enough to satisfy the cravings."},{"name":"Another Broken Egg Cafe","address":"4745 B Ashford Dunwoody Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent!

However, I'd heard a lot about this new place and decided to check it out myself. I am not sure what I've missed but I simply don't understand all of the hype. I really don't understand why this place is as crowded as it is. Is the food \\"good?\\" Well yes, but it isn't spectacular. I'd want spectacular food, superb service and an over the top dining experience in order for it to be acceptable to wait for 2 hours on a weekend morning/afternoon for brunch. Atlanta Breakfast Club does not offer that. \\n\\nThe cafe style is nice, somewhat upscale and obviously new. There is loud music playing overhead. I did enjoy the songs being played but it should be noted that this isn't a quiet place so it may not be the easiest to have a simple table conversation amongst family and friends.\\n\\nI ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was seasoned well and the waffle was ok but I've had much better chicken and waffles. There was just nothing that stood out about the dish; yet it was recommended as one of the most popular. I didn't like that the menu was small and limited. I don't eat pork and I felt like I struggled to find something that I wanted that wouldn't be a basic\\" grits, eggs and meat\\" type breakfast.\\n\\nThe service was \\"ok.\\" With the volume that this restaurant carries it seems almost impossible to have really great service but that is important (or should be) to anyone's dining experience. \\n\\nPROS: Pretty good food, nice decor.\\nCONS: Long waits, limited parking, small menu, mediocre service, loud environment, not good for large groups.\\nTIP: Place yourself on the waiting list through Yelp. Plan to circle to block for 30 min or more to find parking. \\n\\nI hardly feel steered wrong when I read good reviews on Yelp but I'll have to say I was really disappointed.

It's a relic of a Portland that has long since disappeared amidst swarms of transplants from the midwest, rampant development as unchained as Django and tech moving into Portland. Nestled between Powell's and Vaseline Alley, it's both a refuge from the city and a gateway to adventure. Don't wan't to leave the building and feel the need for a whiskey on the rocks at 8am? They have you covered with multiple bars on property and a charming soaking pool for overnight guests only. Because of this, there is an element of exclusivity in that it keeps the commoners out. I digress, if you can't be bothered to leave the building you can also get a mid day buzz on at the pool provided you use a plastic cup, that they are happy to provide you with. Need tater tots at nearly any hour? They have you covered with multiple restaurants. \\nThe rooms provide a window into the brothers McMenimans and who they are. Each room has lyrics and themes that gives them a unique perrsonality, one you would like to get to know. The room I was provided with had a fantastic view of the city. Included in that view was Spartacus and the Georgia Hotel. This provided endless entertainment, watching couples sheepishly look around before walking into Spartacus, or watching them timidly browse the window displays. The Georgia hotel is a grim reminder of what could have been had you decided browsed expedia and said, \\"Oh, $12 a night for a downtown hotel room. This is too good to be true!\\" and blindly booked a room there. Or if you are the subject of a really depressing country song, the Georgia Hotel across the street may be a better fit. \\nAgain, I digress. The service was fantastic. The staff was more than willing to assist me in tracking down large shopping bags so I could carry voodoo donuts on the plan free of harassment upon seeing the large pink boxes. Each time I came and went they greeted me, they made enough conversation where I liked it, but not too much where I dreaded entering the smaller confines of the lobby. The elevator has a strange charm, in that it really only allows two normal sized humans comfortably or two midwesterners uncomfortably.\\nIn conclusion, if you are visiting Portland sure you can stay in Gresham, or out by the airport for a similar amount of money at a major hotel chain. But do they have a theme to the room? No, the theme of their rooms is the same as that of a Hillsboro suburb, uniformity. With McMenimans their properties are all so wildly unique down to the level of each room is unique. No two are alike. But each of their resort has a level of familiarity where no matter where you are in the northwest, you feel like you're coming home hungover for Thanksgiving after a big night out. 10/10 would return."},{"name":"King Bao","address":"710 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"A wonderful little piece of heaven right here on earth.

That can easily feed 3 or more people with appetizers.  Sometimes, I'll just go and get that for dinner.\\n\\nOut of all the curries they make, the Red Curry (Kang Ped) is the best.  It is better than Khow Thai, and I frequent Khow Thai all the time as well.  The Red Curry here is far thicker, and filled with more vegetables than most places.  And, if you order it 5 star, it will be 5 star spicy.  I garontee!\\n\\nTheir Buddha Thai Noodles are okay, but they tend to be a bit over-greasy.

A valet greeted us (complimentary) and we were on our way inside.  We were seated quickly and within 5 -10 minutes, our drink and food orders were taken.  Yelp had a BOGO free promotion for sushi rolls so we took advantage of that before our meal.  The best part about this menu (for me) was that there are several options for every food preference, including tofu.   The standard hibachi menu comes with a protein (or 2 proteins, if you'd like), 2 appetizer shrimp, miso soup, ginger salad, steamed white rice (fried rice costs extra) and veggies.

That's how crazy this place gets.\\n\\nSince then, we've learned to come here on slightly less chaotic occasions (weekdays, and dine either really early or really late).\\n\\nI had the best risotto I've ever had here. It was a seafood risotto - white, creamy, with chunks of scallop, and a heavy accent of dry white wine, for $25. It was on their seasonal menu, and I never saw it again :(\\n\\nI love the texture of their linguini - I don't know how restaurants do it, but they always get the perfect al dente bite, and this place is no exception. Somehow, they are able to make their linguini so that you don't get sick from eating massive amounts of carbs - that is truly the mark of an excellent Italian restaurant when you can gorge yourself without feeling sick at all (compare to Olive Garden, hahaha).\\n\\nI like their red sauce, and their red+spicy sauce (don't remember the actual names) - try their big seafood pasta that has everything in it once (it's enough to feed 2 people), and then in following visits pick and choose the type of seafood you want (shrimp only, shrimp+mussels...etc.). I've always thought their mussels are subpar, but that may be just me. I've consistently thought their pesto sauce is the worst sauce they have there.\\n\\nTheir CALAMARI is fantastic - the tomato sauce that comes with it goes extremely well with the fried calamari, and the peppers are the kicker that pushes the dish over from excellent to mind-blowingly excellent. We've continually ordered a serving per 2 people, because one for 4 is simply not enough - everything is going to be gone in less than 10 minutes -_____-\\n\\nI've tried their butternut squash ravioli, but found it to be too sweet for my taste. It almost felt like eating dessert...imo.\\n\\nFunny story: Once we were waiting in line here and a couple left the restaurant. About 30 seconds later, the manager came out of the restaurant and yelled after the couple, \\"THANKS FOR BEING SO GENEROUS!\\" The couple came back to the restaurant, threw $5 at the manager, and left again. Waiting in line that day wasn't so boring that day due to the unscheduled excitement, hahaha.\\n\\nThis restaurant is really 5/5, but one star off for the extremely longggg wait all the time. I must say though, it's a pretty good way to meet people - during the times I've waited in line, I've spoken to tourists from Greece, law students from Harvard Law, bankers from the Financial District, and an elderly couple celebrating their 45th anniversary.

Made the mistake of ordering Cappelletti di Zucca (butternut squash filled raviolis, almonds, brown butter, sage.) Not because it wasn't good, it was delicious! I was upset that a large order was about 10/11 small raviolis and I could have easily eaten another plate full.

They have some items that are already prepared and kept warm on a buffet type cart to the right of the register counter near the refrigerator.  You can simply ask the waiter and point to the items you want to purchase.  This is ideal for a quick run to get some take outs.  But if you have a chance to sit down, the Pho is decent and comparable to any other Pho places around town.  And if you know some Viet dishes that aren't on the menu, you can always ask and they will make it for you.\\n\\nIf you are among those that love the Bo Luc Lac (aka \\"shaking beef\\"), they have some of the best I have ever had in ATL.

The flavors on all the dishes were high-end farm-to-table, and all of the dishes were played artistically.\\n\\nOverall we had a great experience at the restaurant.

They are now on Curry Ford where the Beef O Brady's used to be. It is a huge upgrade because they ample space now. I only come on Sunday for the breakfast buffet. Let me tell you, there isn't a better deal for breakfast than the buffet here. They offer almost every breakfast item you can imagine in buffet style (eggs, pancakes, fruit, biscuits and gravy, bacon, hasbrowns, grits, and some others I'm forgetting at the moment). The atmosphere is terrific and it is truly one of those \\"it feels like home\\" type of establishments. As others have stated, the food itself isn't going to blow your mind, but for the price you can get an endless amount of breakfast combinations and leave full. The one thing I absolutely love about this place is that the owner works everyday in the kitchen and takes time in-between filling the buffet to come out and talk to all his customers and make sure their dining experience is the best it can be. This is a rarity now a days and i can really appreciate an owner that truly cares about his place, and more importantly, his customers. If you're looking for a full, home-cooked breakfast, make sure you try the buffet at least once.

And this is only my VERY HUMBLE opinion. The food here is not the best thing about the Salt Lick.  Now I know that there might be some individual's thinking I might be crazy, but after having some other BBQ places in and around Austin I can say that the food might not be what it's hyped up to be. \\n\\nI like that it's in the middle of Nowheresville.  Parking lot is huge and it's BYOB!  On a Sunday night about 7pm it was a 45 min wait.  If you didn't BYOB, luckily there is the Salt Lick Cellar's where you can purchase Beer and wine.  If you have a card, which most of us do, you can go to the in-house ATM where you can draw out cold hard cash because this is a CASH ONLY establishment.  \\n\\nI like the service. It's fast and to the point.  Look at the menu, order what you like food comes out.  Since the Salt Lick has been on so many cooking channels and shows I expected it to be heavenly. Instead I go \\"oh, ok\\". Not that it wasn't good, but just didn't have the same, \\"OH, WOW! THIS IS WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE\\" feel to it.\\n\\nMy wife and I ordered the brisket and beef rib combo with slaw and potato salad ($25) with a 1/2 order of chicken ($9).  I know everyone has their philosophy of BBQ, I like fall off the bone beef ribs, some people don't. This didn't have the fall off the bone meat.  I prefer brisket with a crustier outside, other's don't.  The chicken, I do have to say, was definitely moist and tender.  It was on point.  Made out with a dinner for 2 for about $50.\\n\\nAmbiance is stupendous with plenty of outdoor, indoor seating, live music, great for the family style atmosphere.

Was not the only one using it as I saw someone else with Yelp on their phone when I walked in.  The entrance is a little confusing.  People standing inside and out, you are really not sure who is waiting, who is leaving, or what really.  There was one person at the front and even though my Yelp waitlist said there were three parties before me it also said to arrive by 10:22 and it was 10:24 at the time I came in.  Once I was able to make eye contact with the hostess I asked her what to do just to be on the safe side.  She could tell it was the first time I was using the Yelp waitlist and was kind enough to tell me that I would get a notification when the table was ready.  Once our table was ready I did get s notification via text which I thought was really cool, however, as a tip to you, please make sure everyone in your party is ready to be seated when your table is available.  I had to stand there awkwardly for about 5 minutes as I waited for someone who was parking the car.  The person who was seating though was kind enough to explain that was their policy and even reiterated that to another party that was waiting for someone.  As for the inside I loved the set up.  Regardless of how many people were in there if you are seated at a table you will have plenty of room!  Now for the food.  A little on the higher priced side.  A  pancake, though it was huge, cost $5.  The server was very nice and friendly.  I saw something come out on a plate and immediately asked our server what it was.  It is, and I apologize if I call it something incorrectly, a southern chicken sandwich biscuit with egg (or cheese) and gravy.  It is part of their secret menu.  Now why it is part of their secret menu is beyond me because during the 30-45 minutes we were in there I easily saw at least 7 plates with the same exact thing come out.  If it is that popular you might as well just put it on the menu!  Lol, but nothing wrong with keeping it on the secret menu.  What I did not know is that you get two biscuits.  With one and the pancake I tapped out.  Really appreciated our server!  She brought warm pancake syrup, checked the label of the chocolate milk bottle she gave me, and double checked my manager's vegan order.  She also came by at least twice to make sure we were taken care of.  Now I must admit my food was cold, and she did offer to heat it up, but by that time I was so hungry from having done a 5K on a sacrificial fast for my church that I had already eaten one of the biscuits.  The biscuit and even the pancake where on point though.  I was looking at other people's plates as they came by too.  Not because my food was bad, but because my greedy a** wanted to try this that and everything else in-between.  I do not say this about a lot of places but I will be back.  Have to go back!

The service was a bit slow here, but our server was very nice, as were the hostesses. I can't believe how large this place is. The main dining room is fairly big, but then there's another room that's almost the same size plus some rooms off to the back for much larger parties. I can't imagine them filling the place, but we were there on off hours, so I could be wrong.\\n\\nWe ordered some wontons in hot oil and Dan Dan noodles to start off, but I'm pretty sure we got dumplings instead. There was definitely hot oil though, because they were literally floating in it! Not how I like my wontons (dumplings). They didn't taste that great either. The Dan Dan noodles were also submerged in the sesame heavy sauce they came in. The flavor was okay, but there was just so much sauce that I really couldn't fully enjoy them. Not to mention trying to serve these onto our place made quite a mess. Hot oil will splash, so you better not wear anything you really like..\\n\\nLuckily, my entree of Cumin Beef made up for the lackluster appetizers. They give you a nice heaping portion of beef, and the cumin flavor shines through without overpowering everything. I'd highly recommend any of their Cumin dishes if they're anything like this.\\n\\nOn the other hand, my girlfriend's beef brisket hot pot was essentially a pot roast except with chunks of beef that still had tough fat on them that hadn't rendered down. It made some of the pieces unedible. The flavor was pretty much reminiscent of a beef stew and even came with potatoes and carrots. I wasn't a fan.\\n\\nOverall, I'm not sure when or if I'll be back, since it's so far out of the way for me, and I seemed to have found a few places closer that are doing Sichuan food very well. There's also a lot of Asian options up this way, so I'd have to really be craving it.

This place oozes with perfection in it's food!  Everyone - from the baristas to the bartenders to the hostesses to the doormen to the waiters - serves you with CLASS!\\n\\nThe bar here is absoltely OUTSTANDING!  No wonder it was rated as one of Food & Wine's Top 100 in the US list!  As for the bartender, Anna.  This lady knows her drinks!  She suggested two drinks, and gave me a sampler of her original creation (OMG!).  [Note: I'm a 1/2 drink wonder (i.e., cheap date), where I don't normally drink alcohol.  But I left this place after drinking 3 drinks and skipping back to the hotel!]:\\n\\nThe first drink was a red wine, called, \\"Chateau De Hureau\\".  http://domaine-hureau.fr/en    It's a French wine with heavy fruit tastes that are overwhelmed by spicy peppercorn flavors.  The fruit tastes hit the back of the tongue and the spicyness awakens the palate!  $12.  Grade:  B+.\\n\\nThe second drink was a special / original drink created by the bartender Anna.  It was a combination of  Szechuan Peppercorn infused gin (bartenders infuses gin with Szechuan Peppercorns & citrus and \\"cook\\" it in a bag at 7F degrees for 1 hour), Cocchi Apertivo Americano, Citrus juice, and a few drops of orange-infused drops.  This drink went particularly well with  the Asian-infused food here, especially the pork.  It cuts the fat and clears the pallate.  $11.  Grade:  A.\\n\\nThe third drink was a special drink created by the bartender Anna.  It was an apple-infused rum then infused with BACON!   She mixes this special liquor with pineapple infused rum.    It was a bit thick in texture (looks like chilled white grape juice) and tasted likeyou were biting into a bacom sandwich with apples.  This drink was gratis and sooo appreciated.  BRAVO!  Gratis!  Grade:  A+.\\n \\nThe food here is even more oustanding!  I had one appetizer and one main meal (for two):\\n\\nFor the Appetizer, I had the Crispy-Fried Pig's Tails.  It was pig tails deep fried in some kind of hoisin / five spice mixture.  It is served with pickeled peanuts, nuc cham, cilantro.   The pig's tails are fried to perfection - there is a delicate balance of fat and meat, melting off the bones!   $17.  Grade:  A-.\\n\\nFor the main meal, I had the Confit and Roasted Milk-Fed Pig's Head (for two).  It was a 1/2 roasted pig's head served with Peiking pancakes, spicy pumpkin samgal, boudin noir-hoisin sauce.  One of the great things about this dish is that they cut the pig skin in pieces so you can tear away nice bite-sized pieces.  The cheek meat was absolutely DELISH.  Under the jaw area and outside the eye socket meat was my favorite pieces of meat.   The flavor was smokey roasted and it had a sweet / salty flavor to it.  The pig was served with rock salt - which gave it a nice kick.  The pig head was very greasy, but that made it more savory on the pallate.   $60 (serves two).  Grade:  A+.\\n\\nNote:  There are only 4-6 orders of this Pig's Head per night.  Make an early dinner reservation so you can be sure to get one of these dishes.  Order it right when you get to your seat!  Be sure to give it at least an hour for this dish to come out.  It's a great opportunity to try their drinks or engage in their awesome appetizers!\\n\\nChef Tony Maws - BRAVO!    You not only deserved to be nominated for the James Beard Best Chef Award - you should have WON IT hand's down!  You have one super-fan in me!\\n\\nBartender Anna -  BRAVO!  Your creativity in drinks (Szechuan Pepper & bacon infused rum?!  YUM!) and your patience with the customers made this a wonderful experience.   You are perhaps the best bartender that I have met! \\n\\nRecommendation:  Crispy-Fried Pig's Tails for an appetizer, Confit & Roasted Milk-Fed Pig's Head for a main meal!\\n\\nBe sure to tip your wait staff and bartenders well - they work hard and deserve a fat tip!"},{"name":"Sixth and Waller","address":"1108 East Sixth St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Subpar, overpriced food, napkins were dirty, service was rude.

I feel like this is a tough one because although the pizza is VERY good, i'm not entirely sure i'd go back? When I go places to eat i'm not only looking at \\"is it good\\", i'm looking at the overall experience! Was the food good, was the staff friendly, was the inside inviting and a fun place to eat, does it have stress-free parking? The little things that add to an amazing experience in my book. My wife and I ordered the LARGE LASAGNA PIZZA which comes with meatballs, ricotta and romano which cost me $21. The pizza is HUGE and has a decent amount of cheese and meatballs. The crust is nice and chewy but with a crusty side while the slice is on the thinner side, so it will flop if you grab a slice and not hold it up with 2 hands. I wish the sauce had a bit more flavor, but that's just how I like my pizza, with a bit more kick! Parking is so-so... small 4-5 car parking on the front with slightly larger parking on the other side. It is adjacent to a street where you can park for free. There is also an ice cream place across the street where you can park but all of these spaces get busy quick if you come during busy hours. The inside is spacious but it gets very very busy, so seating may either not be available or you may have to wait for a bit. The pizza does come out extremely fast though, so whether they are busy or not, you'll get your pizza fast. The atmosphere may be a bit too fast paced for me at the end of the day. No table was available for us to sit at so we ended up on a side window looking counter near the door with people coming in and out and waiting on tables. It got HOT really quick with the sun right on us through the window, so when I ran out of my bottled drink I was a bit sad. The good news is there is an ice cream place right across the street that Anticos has signs inside pointing towards to telling the crowd to go there next, it's called Illy. Good gelato inside an air conditioned place, perfect timing! Maybe Antico would be better if I lived closer or if I found a time they were not so busy? it would be nice to relax and enjoy your slice as you had a conversation with friends and family... but it's too loud in there and too crowded.

The chips had a chili seasoning, which was different and didn't go well with all the salsas, but were still thin and crispy. The salsa roja (spicy) was really good, but the salsa verde was pretty thick and gloopy and not flavorful. The house salsa was good, but for $5 I expected to get more, there was a big bag of chips and definitely not enough salsa to finish them. Ordered 4 tacos, 2 pollo and 2 carne molida, and both were good, but not great. Also got a half order of nachos, definitely a big size for a half order, but absolutely drenched in sour cream in a big blob on top. Had to scoop it off to eat because no one would ever want to eat that much. The ground beef on the nachos was mildly spicy and very flavorful. Good food, but pretty average.

On my IG:  Place look shinny and new, food looked good and high tea looked amazing.  I booked marked it right away.   High tea is offered only on Fridays & Saturdays from 1-4.  I made reservation (highly recommend small place).  Came with a friend who was also excited to try their high tea.  We arrived a little early, was sat several minutes after.  First impression pretty restaurant.  And Has a gallery but just took a peek.  \\nThe restaurant was pretty busy, looked like everyone was there for high tea.  \\n\\nFor $45 you had an option of tea or coffee, also if you wanted specialty coffee or drinks for an up charge.\\nI ordered ginger tea and received English Breakfast.  I didn't complain.  When our tier high tea came it was very impressive.  We started with 4 savory bites.  First the quiche lorraine, it was ok.  Pastry was good.  Sandwiches were also ok.  Nothing special.  The seared duck breast with jam was the tastiest from all the savory.  The scones didn't look too appetizing, it looked a little well done. But to our surprise it tasted really good.  Buttery and jam & cream went well with it.  And for the sweets.  I've been eyeing the flan since the tier had arrived.  And it was divine.  Creamy and smooth.  Prefect amount of sweetness.  My favourite out of the whole high tea hands down!  I want a whole pie of just the flan, if possible! \\nOk where was I, Eclair was also really good.  The pastry was not as soft as I had expected but still very nice.  Financier was moist, and tasty Im always afraid that they will be dry but it wasn't!  Macaron was good. And some let downs Roll cake was nothing special.  And the lemon tart was meh! I usually don't like lemon dessert in general but I like to try just in case it proves me wrong.  I took the meringue top off and that tasted good.  The lemon casted part was a different story, I did not like it.  \\n\\nService, was up and down.  We mentioned to our server that my friend had a nut allergy.  So they doubled a dessert that didn't have nuts, but did not inform us of another dessert on the tier also had nuts until it was served to us.  So she couldn't have that one.  Also getting my tea wrong, which was fine.  But when I finished my tea and no one gave me a hot water refill till we were done.  They had a lot of staff working while we were there.  When we asked for the bill our server never came back, we needed to flag someone down.  Overall, this place has good potential it needs to iron out its kinks with better consistent in service.

I tell people who visit Boston to eat there because it's famous & hyped, but I'm not sure if it's deserving of it. Don't get me wrong, I gave it 4 stars because I liked what I ate, a lot \\"& I'm a fan,\\" but it's not 5 stars \\"as good as it gets\\" good.\\n\\nService:\\nWe had a really lovely, helpful, & accommodating waitress. I've been told others have had bad experiences with her, but I liked her just fine. She chose a nice wine for us to enjoy with your pastas & it paired well.\\n\\nPrices:\\nReasonable. Not too shabby!\\n\\nFood:\\nI wanted to order the calamari, but decided against being a complete lard-o, so I stuck with a custom pasta of clams with far diavolo sauce. It was really good, but at the same time, I felt like it needed more salt. I really liked the pasta, but I felt as though it's not that much better than what I can make in my own home. I just didn't understand the hype. It was certainly delicious, but not \\"wait in the cold for 1-2 hours\\" worthy. The clams were really large & fresh too. Do Bostonians just hype up restaurants because they don't know better or ... what? I know y'all don't have a Michelin star rated restaurant yet, sooo......what's the deal here? \\n\\nSo anyway, to break it down: the pasta was al dente (A+ for that), but it wasn't the best pasta I've ever had in my life. Yes, I've been to Italy & even the most Americanized mediocre pasta in Rome trumps this pasta. The sauce needed an extra kick of salt or fish sauce or something because it was a bit bland. Once I added a bit of extra pepper & salt (it's so rare that I ever add extra salt to my food in restaurants), it really shined. \\n\\nLots of vegetarian options, so take your vege-friends without fear!\\n\\nEnvironment:\\nSmall restaurant with good amounts of tables, but just not enough because the line is so long. Great place for a date too or to bring your family, but again, have fun waiting for the place in the cold. Get there early!\\n\\nI want to come back, probably to the South End one because it's closer & less crowded, but I don't think this place is mind-blowing & orgasmic the way others have hyped it up. I love me some Italian food, but it's so rare to find a place that even comes close to the real deal in Italy. There was just something missing in my dish, an extra kick of umami or something, but I'll be back.

I really enjoyed the specials and thought everything was very well balanced and curated. The hogzilla was tender and delicious, but be warned that it really is thick and fatty pork belly, and not the more westernized pork belly you might be used to. The Cuban was delicious and more westernized pork. The hot fried chicken was spicy, crispy, and insanely delicious. My boyfriend said that the inner harbor was surprisingly fresh and delicious (and he worked in Baltimore for a time). \\n\\nDefinitely check this place out! Cheap, delicious and innovative eats. Definitely grab a fork  because everything will inevitably fall out and you'll want to savor every last bite. We were stuffed with two bao + a dessert bao + half of the tatchos each.

When we checked the app to see how much longer we had to wait, we noticed that they took us off the list. When we approached the hostess about it, she said they called us but they DID NOT. We even checked our recent calls and NOTHING. So we had to be put on the list again. This time around, we decided to find some room to wait inside and we noticed that every time they called someone's name off the waiting list they said it softly and they DID NOT go outside to check if the person could have been waiting outside. It is absolutely impossible to have everyone wait inside, so there's a good chance that the person could be standing outside but they don't feel the need to check, so they'll just remove your name and move on. Very terrible system they have going on! The prices are also ridiculous and not worth it. I got 2 salmon croquettes and grits for $13.95.

But who wouldn't? Their exemplary zas can make grumpy old men moan with happiness, and grown folks like me giggle like a little child watching that show with those walking, talking creepy-as-f*** vegetables.\\n\\nSeriously, though, my lady and I devour an entire pie about every other week or so, and Antico's pizzas make our lives that much better.\\n*****\\nI. FOOD & DRINK\\nCan't really go wrong with any of the pies here. Why? Well, they consistently make amazing dough that comes out wonderfully soft and beautifully airy. And the sauce? It has a great balance of sugar, salt, and spice. Whatever else you put on it, it's bound to be great. Oh, and the cheeses they use are fantastic as well. Pizzas I've destroyed:\\n\\n*Capriciossa: with mushroom, artichoke, prosciutto cotto, and bufala, it's easily one of my favorites. Earthy, savory, cheesy, and fleshy - it has it all. \\n\\n*Diavola: spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala - spicy, meaty pizza is always good. A favorite as well. \\n\\n*San Gennaro: with salsiccia, sweet red pepper, bufala, and cippoline, this baby also rocks. \\n\\nRegarding drinks, they have your basic Coke products, as well as different flavored San Pellegrino's. But the real kick-a***ness is that patrons are allowed to BYOB. So, you'll see people bring in some nice bottles of reds - even with their own glasses sometimes - and get down.\\n\\nBTW, across the street, they have this gorgeous, quaint pasticceria ideal for fun dates with a loved one during the Spring, Summer or Fall. Shoot, I sort of like this building more than the pizza joint. Things to know: they have some bomb as hell coffee, as well as marvelous cannolis. Can't go wrong with the gelato either. Oh, and definitely take advantage of the scooter they have outside. A chubby dude like me looks ridiculous on one of those things.\\n\\nII. SERVICE\\nFor whatever reason, the service... well, is poor. During the handful of times I've waited in line - either during the weekday or weekend - there always seems to be an issue. It's either one of the following: \\n\\n1) The cashiers enter the incorrect order, and we have to accept a pizza that was not the one you wanted because when you complain about it they say they can't do anything; \\n\\n2) Your pizzas are taken by other people that claim to have the same name. \\n\\n3) The cashiers exude snarky, eye-rolling rudeness (which I usually don't mind). If the service was fast or even consistent, I would let a lot of things slide. But it's not.\\n\\nI do admit, though, three of the eight or so times I've been there no problems have occurred. They seem to be rare, though.\\n\\nIII. ATMOSPHERE/ D√âCOR\\nIt's Hunger Games-like when that line forms, and the steaming inside seating area is scarce. Opt to take the pizzas to go, unless you visit during non-peak hours.\\n\\nIV. PRICES\\nPizzas run around $20 or north of it. The deliciousness is definitely worth your hard earned cash, though.\\n\\nV. OVERALL\\nAbsolutely stunning flavas, but the chaos and rudeness are ridiculous. So, my lady and I use Favor to have someone get the pizzas for us. That runs us about $10+, for someone to do that. And we think that it's worth it."},{"name":"Pizzeria La Sorrentina","address":"3000 SE 164th Ave, Ste 107","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing authentic Italian wood-fire pizza!

The Jax in Lake Mary has some very intriguing menu items, but my friend and I decided to order 20 wings, half BBQ and half mild.  When the server brought the wings to the table, they didn't have any sauce on them at all, instead a small container of BBQ sauce and mild sauce were propped in the basket.  The waitress explained that the cook refused to split the order with two different kinds of sauce, so she had him put the sauces on the side.  Outraged, my friend and I wondered why the waitress didn't ask our preference before she brought out the food, or why the cook refused to split the order.  When we sent the food back to the kitchen, the manager then explained that, when they are busy, it's just too time consuming for the line cook to split wing orders so their restaurant doesn't do it.  I think I may possibly have understood that reasoning if there had been more than 10 people in the entire restaurant.  But even then, if we had ordered 10 mild wings and another order of 10 BBQ wings, it would have taken the same amount of time.  Because we were afraid that the cook would spit in our food, we refused to order something else.  At that point, the shift manager called the general manager on his day off to get special permission to make our wings the way we wanted them, and when the food was delivered the shift manager gave us a stern warning that this was a special exception and we would not be able to get a split order of wings in the future.  I give Jax props for wanting to make us happy, but seriously, what is wrong with that place?  They made a rule that in no way improves the efficiency in the kitchen and they have to get special permission from a GM to make the cook do his job and make the customer happy.  Seriously?

Everyone walking by is stopping and taking pics.  We sat down and ordered our food.  It took a while for our food to come to the table but as we waited I did notice a lot of people coming in with beer and even ice chests full of beer!!! It's very cool!  I had the all you can eat brisket, ribs and sausage.  The brisket was so good I had fatty with burnt ends.  It just fell apart with most tender meat and the bark on the burnt ends was delicious.  The sausage was full of flavor and had a good snap to it.  The ribs were also very tender juicy and moist.  We also ordered a pulls pork sandwich.  We were not too impressed with the flavor of the pulled pork.  It tasted more like carnitas that bbq pulled pork.

I'm always game for Szechuan so we decided to give them a try when we were in Richmond. They specialize in one dish; you guessed it, fish sauerkraut.\\n\\nWe dropped in on a Sunday evening (around 6:30pm) and were shocked to find it completely packed. We put our names down and waited for about 45 minutes for a table to open up. The inside is spacious and is split into two seating areas. The table booths that they have are comfortable and luxurious. Service is typical but lacking; they forgot to bring out one of our sides and didn't refill our tea cups.\\n\\nThe menu is small; literally, the only thing you're ordering here is their speciality (small, large and the feaster option) but there's also starters, sides, vegetables, rice & noodles and drinks.\\n\\n- Fish belly ($7.99) - it's smoked fish jerky. We'd actually ate something similar the weekend before at a Shanghainese spot. This one was bonier so it wasn't as enjoyable to eat. Skip it.\\n- Chinese sauerkraut fish ($39.99 small) - this easily fed the three of us. We also added wide starch noodles ($3.99) which were flat glassy noodles. Good bite but you don't get much. Broth was tantalizing as you get sour and spicy with a touch of numbness. The heat comes from the Sichuan green peppercorns and dried red chili peppers while sour tones are from the pickled mustard greens. Fish was flaky, soft and tender.\\n- Rice ($2.25) - the rice goes well with the soup but it's the dinkiest portion I've seen for the price.\\n- Plain noodle ($1.99) - if we were to come back, we'd stick with adding 2-3 bowls of noodles. Does the trick.\\n- Chinese donuts ($4.99) - these are a must! I normally don't love the donuts but it went perfectly with the soup. They soak up the flavour brilliantly but still retain their crunchy bite.\\n\\nCSF is worth a try if you want try something completely different. 3.5 stars."},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"$4 for a cup of DRIP coffee WITH OUR OWN TO-GO MUG.

The sauce is super creamy, the insides are slightly sweet, and the asparagus really balances it out. Most of their seafood pasta dishes come with seafood of your choice (the one we ordered had shrimp/scallops/calamari/clams/mussels) on linguini, with a sauce of your choice.

The lettuce on the bar was large pale pieces of iceberg, nothing special. \\n\\nWhen they called my number, I decided on the pico de gallo for my topping. The burger was super greasy, not necessarily a bad thing, but something was also super salty. I assume it was the meat, but it could be the pico. I ate my burger, but my mouth was stinging from the salt afterwards. The fries are what I assume to be pre-made coated ones, not terrible, but not great. \\n\\nWould I come back?

It's kind of hard to compare the portions to other poke places because they generally use bowls but they serve a pretty decent portion size here. My only qualm is that with the regular bowl you can split the bases like at other places. I also think that the sauce wasn't mixed very well with my proteins as I couldn't really taste it (or maybe I chose the wrong sauce).

The cabbage was decent, but the beets were just simple with very little flavor. The empanadas were pretty good, but the jamon croquetas weren't very satisfying with it's mushy tuna-like filling. \\n\\nFor entrees, I was very disappointed that they didn't have my favorite dish, lechon asado, so I opted for my second choice, ropa vieja with black beans and my husband ordered vaca frita with red beans. When they first arrived, we were also surprised to see how soupy the beans were.  Odd, but the main focus was the meat. The vaca frita was well cooked with cripsy bits and came with a sour mystery sauce which is good because it had no flavor. The ropa vieja was even worse. I found it odd that it came with a pile of unincorporated and unflavored peas on top, but it got worse with my first bite--no seasoning or flavor at all. It simply tasted like boiled meat. Thank god they put salsas on the table, because without them, the whole meal would have been inedible.\\n\\nI still can't believe how crowded the place was on a Sunday afternoon and that people keep raving about the flavorful food.

We told her it had literally just gone off, and the extremely unfriendly hostess told us people weren't moving fast enough.. not the kind of costumer service salt lick is known for, and I can personally attest to that as I have been that hostess! Super disappointed to see that they only had the new side open for lunch service.. I know the old side is small. But people drive from all over the state/country (my family included) to come eat here, only to be sat in the new side. It's not bad, but it's certainly lacking the charm of the old side. I understand with a crowd they need to open the new side, but why not have both open or open old side first? Then at least you have half a chance of getting the full salt lick experience. Waitress was also unfriendly, drinks hardly had ice, and the brisket seems to have been changed to keep up with newer popular places. I hold this place near and dear, hoping next time I have the chance to spend an afternoon out here it's worth the time and money spent.

It seems their focus is more on the pizza and sandwiches. They had about a half dozen pastas on their menu, all very reasonably priced, as well as the option to build your own pasta dish. Giorgio also mentioned that they can make \\"pretty much anything\\" so when I did not see my beloved white clam linguine on the menu, we asked if they could whip it up.

The happy hour is pretty limited, the prices aren't anything to rave about, AND there are restrictions for being eligible for happy hour prices. In order for you to get happy hour menu \\"access\\" your entire table needs to order some sort of drink (doesn't have to be alcoholic). That is absurd to me -- this is the first time I've ever seen such a restriction to have happy hour menu. Next, we weren't given a happy hour menu as we were seated, and that makes me wonder: did they have a pre-conceived opinion that we weren't gonna order drinks and be eligible to order happy hour items? These right off the bat gave me a pretty sour initial impression of the place. \\n\\nAfter the fact, reviewing their regular menu, they didn't have any eel sushi roll options, which was slightly disappointing. Bamboo in my perspective had the reputation as the best sushi place in Portland, and it didn't live close to the reputation. To be the best, I'd imagine a wide menu with numerous options for sushi (in addition to top quality sushi) with competitive prices, but that wasn't the case. But, to bring me to the positives, you're probably wondering why I gave it a 3 instead of a 2. Well, that's because the quality of the sushi was actually really good. Above the taste of the sushi, the rice to fish ratio was excellent, probably one of the best I've had. Very thin layer of rice to the sushi, yet the rolls still held firm and didn't fall apart. Just because the proportions were how I'd like it, I bumped it up a star. I was able to really taste the fish (spicy tuna in my case) and have my taste buds ring as the tuna melted on my tounge. The quality of fish was fine. Just as your reference for cost considerations, I ordered the Sunset roll (non-happy hour item) for $12 and there were 8 quality pieces per order. To be honest, I'm not sure I'd be back even if I had cravings. I just don't think there's anything to rave about for the sushi and the prices they're demanding. Good sushi, IMO, but there are better dining options in Portland."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite breakfast spot in Atlanta!

This is my reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  She got a manager to speak to me but I think that waitstaff should be more informed about their menus, food allergies, and ingredients because not everybody can eat whatever they want and gluten makes me very sick.  \\n\\n  Our food did take awhile to come out but I was okay with that because they were busy and once the sushi arrived it was delicious.

I would totally order this again over the wings!\\n\\nThe service was timely and super friendly. Street parking was pretty easy to find.

The rotisserie chicken was so good. It was slightly burnt at the wing but honestly I like it like that. The beans aren't lik Mexican beans that are super thick. These were more like whole beans in a watery soup. I liked it because the chicken and maduros were heavy. The only thing I didn't love was the rice.

He never told us about any specials so we just ordered.\\n\\nOur arancini balls arrived promptly and the flavor was really good.  Sadly there were only 2 in the order and for $12 it was not worth it.  \\n\\nI ordered the rigatoni while my boyfriend got the gnocchi.

The food portion is definitely large..but that sort of balanced out by a relatively pricier side of their vegetarian dishes anyways.

The waiter who waited my table just couldn't care about me dining there. We barely interacted throughout the duration of the meal. Not once did he check on me about my meals or if I might want anything. I asked about the desserts, and he just abruptly said to look at the board..and didn't seem to want to explain or recommend anything. Only once I decided to order a raspberry cheesecake when he said they just sold the last piece (would have appreciated if he mentioned the fact that a piece would run out soon when I askes about desserrs even before I ordered my main courses). He also didn't care to trt to recommend anything else...so I asked for my check instead. The guy just left and asked another lady to drop and take care of my bill instead. Couldn't care or give a dann I guess.

Instead of essentially facing a glass case full of fish, at Bamboo Sushi the chefs are in a sunken kitchen so that you can better witness them practice their craft.

They said that it had just came in that day but was not ready to be served. We were a tad disappointed but understanding and moved on.

While it's on the pricer end than going to another theme park, you definitely have to be in the mood for it. This park allows things that most others do not such as selfie sticks, smoking, and wagons to tote your kid around in (which results into getting run over a lot).

We decided to order the majority of the menu to share. Standouts included the falafel appetizer, rice cakes, and the crab/seaweed noodle. Everyone at the table also loved the much heralded fried chicken, which I found a bit too sweet and over sauced, but that may have just been a matter of preference.  \\n\\nThe pancakes worked less well. The kimchi version was the best of the three, mainly because of the delicious pork belly on top. The cioppino pancake was rather bland, and unfortunately was undercooked in the center.  The only dish that went unfinished was the jackfruit pancake that lacked any taste of the coconut and lemongrass promised on the menu. \\n\\nThe short rib rice bowl was a great vehicle for the four sauces that grace every table. I found the dan dan noodle disappointing mainly because it didn't taste like any dan dan noodle I had had in the past. Instead this version was made with a fresh flat pasta and tasted overwhelmingly of Chinese five spice. \\n\\nThe desserts were great, particularly the brownie with marshmallow.

They also have a bar when you walk in.\\n\\nCustomer service is decent.  I want to say they did do their part.  But was it out of the ordinary, no.  Absolutely not.  The waiter who took our order was kind of helpful, suggestions and all... But he actually provided better service to the table next to us.  Then, when the server actually brings us our food, he completely messes up the order, but I think he was new - so I'm not gonna say much about that. \\n\\nFood wise... Ok the cost overall is kind of pricy.  Not pricy as in like oh you know Michelin restaurant pricy, but the serving size and the price itself... No bueno... Not for me anyways, and I'm from California.  Just contemplate on that for a minute.\\n\\n1.  Edamame:  Edamame is edamame.. What else can I say...\\n\\n2.  Fresh Wasabi:  Freshly grated, but for $5 guess what you get... Less than a nickel sized serving...  I've had fresh wasabi before, that's just ridiculous.  \\n\\n3. Sushi Rolls: Chasing the Dragon, Full Circle, and Kimono - These rolls were definitely not the best.  And the fact that it's a signature roll is kinda like you expected more.  Honestly everything they had put inside these rolls, were completely Americanized.  Does not have a Japanese touch to it.  \\n\\n4. Toro Salmon:  Toro Salmon was one of the things that is not on the menu, but it was the fish of the day in a way since that's the fish they had specifically for toro.  For $25 dollars, you get 5 piece of nigiri.  But let me just emphasize how big each piece was, literally, less than an inch wide. \\n\\nIf you want to talk about quality, it's fresh.  If you want to talk about taste, it's not that good.  After my experience here, my stomach hurt for the next day and a half.  I was highly disappointed.  I wouldn't want to come back - and this would be one of the restaurants I felt like I should've went with my gut because I already had a feeling I wasn't going to like it..."},{"name":"Another Broken Egg Cafe","address":"4745 B Ashford Dunwoody Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This was our second time visiting the restaurant.

The grounds and restaurant have a modern farmhouse feel, and the service is brisk, though not necessarily attentive. Glasses and plates sat on our table for way too long. The beer is not bad, but there are many better breweries in Austin. \\n\\nWhy one star? For a farm to table restaurant, the chef here didn't take advantage of his bounty. I expected everything to be fresher, more flavorful. Instead, they cooked all the life and flavor out of the meat. And the vegetables were mishandled, undercooked, or underwhelming. Some dishes were oversalted, some undersalted. Some elements were overcooked, some undercooked. This was perhaps the worst meal I've had in the past year. Here's what we ordered: \\n\\nBeer Steamed Mussels  (vor ort, smoked tomato broth, African spice chorizo, fried potatoes) - This sounded so good on the menu, especially the smoked tomato broth. But it had no flavor at all. There was not a hint of beer, tomato, or smokiness. The mussels were teeny tiny. The chorizo was overcooked, dry, and flavorless, like eating overcooked ground beef. And the fried potatoes were limp on the outside and undercooked on the inside. \\n\\nRoasted Sweet Potato Dip (sunflower tahini, candied seeds, pickled chili, north african spices) - Mashed sweet potatoes holding a pool of 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil. The tahini added a nice savoriness. But only three pieces of bread and slices of broccoli. Nothing to write home about.\\n\\nSmoked Pork Ribs (beer glaze, garden dry rub, yeast pickles) - The worst ribs I have ever had in my entire life. It was dry on the bone with a mealy, grainy texture. We could not taste the beer glaze. The pickled vegetables were covered with raw clove, an odd and unappealing combination. This was inedible.\\n\\nThe only dish that was edible was a ceviche of sorts bathed in a limey coconut sauce. I think it was supposed to be Thai-inspired.

When you ask the servers for recommendations they will tell you to try the turtle soup, meatloaf, bratwurst sandwich, potato cakes or even the infamous Mother Mohawk sandwich, which is a curious pairing of cold chicken salad and grilled roast beef served on marbled rye.  They say it's very good.  I haven't had it so I'll just trust them on that.

I was introduced to this restaurant recently and cannot believe I had never heard of it earlier- it is truly a hidden gem (at least hidden from me for the past few years) located conveniently right across the street from the Back Bay T Station. \\n\\nTonight was my third dinner here in the past two months and my entire party of four all couldn't stop raving about the food, even after we'd left. We each started off the meal with a create-your-own charcuterie board. I personally love the prosciutto and the chicken liver mousse, which are probably two of the less adventurous offerings but they are just such staples of charcuterie and so delicious.The board also comes with a side of sweet pickles, a schmear of mustard, and buttery, rustic crostini (that you can ask for more of). \\n\\nI have also enjoyed their mushroom pizza on several occasions- the mushrooms are flavorful and fresh. However, today I felt that the pizza was more creamy than I remembered. In the past, I have also tried the salty pig pizza, which, true to its name, is a little too salty. I'll pass on the pizzas in the future. \\n\\nOn the other hand, I tried their homemade pasta for the first time tonight and was blown away, especially by the tagliatelle with wild boar ragu. The wild boar ragu is tender and flavorful, the texture of the pasta is unique and the fact that it's freshly made in-house really comes through. And although I am not partial to lamb, my boyfriend was a big fan of his campanelle with lamb neck sugo. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is energetic and trendy and definitely busy but not in a way that detracts from the service or the experience. The waiters are knowledgable and helpful and even in the little things, such as the fact that our water glasses were regularly refilled and never stayed empty, I was more than satisfied with the service.\\n\\n--\\n\\n[Update: 1/10/14 - Menu Changes]\\n\\nGuilty as charged- I'm here for the second night in a row and I think I have officially finalized my Salty Pig \\"usual\\": create-your-own charcuterie board with chicken liver mousse, prosciutto, and stravecchio cheese followed by a small tagliatelle with wild boar ragu.\\n\\nThe menu does change regularly and although our return for the second night in a row was inspired by the boyfriend's craving for the campanelle with lamb neck sugo, we discovered that it had been replaced by a spaghetti in a flavorful tomato sauce with pancetta. The house-made spaghetti is uniquely dense and chewy, putting a spin on a classic spaghetti in tomato sauce. There was also a new cheese on the block: stravecchio. Prior to this cheese, I had enjoyed the other cheeses but didn't have a favorite, but this was my type of cheese- aged 12 months, sweet and nutty, yum. And in terms of service, we experienced the same friendly attentiveness as prior visits."},{"name":"McCoy's Bar & Grill","address":"9300 Jeff Fuqua Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"From the start this place was not what we expected. From the start there was a 10 minute wait, which is usually no problem, except more than half the restaurant was empty with plenty of staff. After we were seated and given water it took our waiter over 15 minutes to come to our table for us to order drinks. Then the starters were over priced for the small portion you get, but this was the best part of the meal. We got the trio for $19.99- we got the mushrooms, Thai chicken tenders, and quesadillas. They were delicious, but again in my opinion overpriced for such small portions. My husband got the international roll- which he said was decent but overpriced. He also got the small portion of crawfish chowder which was AMAZING and definitely the best thing of the night-this is why I gave 2 stars instead of one. I got the signature McCoy's burger which was over cooked and less than decent to the point I didn't even want to eat it, which says a lot because I was starving. Also my fries were cold and tasted old. Then it took over 20 minutes for us to get our waiter to take our plates and bring us our check. At this point another waitress came over took our plates and brought us our check. I have no idea where our waiter went but this place was not busy on a Thursday night by any means.

The slaw that came with it was delicious and not infused with vinegar. \\nThe bucatini mussels pasta sauce was flavorful and pasta was perfectly al dente.. if you're in mood pasta definitely recommend getting this. \\n\\nThe row34 duxbury oysters were super gamy, so be warned and maybe stay away from those oysters. Aunt ditty's oysters are spectacular, sweet and clean so I recommend getting his. \\n\\nThe scallop ceviche was delicious but the quantity of scallops were lacking so I don't know if I would recommend ordering this."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Hands down the best restaurant in fort point and potentially in all of boson if you're a seafood lover.

The restaurant name is eponymous: the focus is on Chinese Sauerkraut Fish. You can place a small order (1 fish), a medium order (2 fish), or a feast (3 fish). My wife and I placed a small order. \\n\\nNot only was 1 fish more than enough for us, but we enjoyed the multiple dimensions of flavor. The spice mainly comes from dried red arbol chili peppers and smaller Thai chili peppers, with a nice, mouth-buzzing feeling from Sichuan green peppercorns. The sour mainly comes from the pickled mustard cabbage and daikon radish. If you don't like extremes of either spice or sour, then this place will NOT be for you. \\n\\nWe added several components: bean curd (hujook skin), spongy tofu, and enoki mushrooms. These were clearly labeled on the menu as being $3.99 each, and for two hungry people, we got more than enough of them. \\n\\nThe cauliflower side dish was also very good, and provided a nice (non-spicy) complement to the soup. \\n\\nI've had suan cai yu in several Chengdu and Sichuan cuisine restaurants, and overall, this restaurant does a great job.

This is a similar approach. \\n\\nWe were done in about an hour, from seating to finish. We were stuffed and could've been rolled out in wheelbarrows. The bill, with tax and tip, came to about $60 CAD--very reasonable. The naysayers who complain about the price have the wrong expectations for what this place is. \\n\\nLastly, a word about the service. It is totally fine. This isn't ultra fine dining, folks. It is very typical for Mainland Chinese, and if you look around, the majority of customers will also be Mainland Chinese. They have a different culture around service than Westerners do, and if you're understanding of that, you won't grumble about the service being \\"sub par.\\""},{"name":"Arden's Garden","address":"985 Monroe Dr NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This place can never go wrong.

The grounds are beautiful and full of flowers in bloom. My fianc√© and I decided to ride the motorcycle through hill country with the Salt Lick as our destination.

We were already drooling passing by the huge open pit with all the delicious meats hanging and cooking.\\n\\nWe both decided on the 3 meat plate (Thurman's Choice) with brisket, sausage, and ribs. Cole slaw, potato salad, and beans are the sides that accompany the meat. The ribs were great. Juicy, flavorful, and meaty. The brisket was just so-so, however. It was on the dry side even though we ordered moist. The flavor just wasn't there either. Sausage was good, not great, but good. The sides were ho hum as well. Mostly flavorless beans, cole slaw, and potato salad. \\n\\nWe were hoping dessert would be redeeming and ordered a slice of the pecan pie and the blackberry cobbler.

Been meaning to check this place out when I was in the Austin area, it's about a 45 minute drive from Austin. My friends and I came on a Saturday for lunch around 1 (They prepared me and told me not to eat breakfast) and there was NO WAIT! My friends who live in Austin for 8 years have NEVER experienced this EVER! So all my friends who have been to Salt Lick in the past ordered BBQ plates and because it was my first experience, they told me to do the Family Style (all-you-can-eat brisket, pork ribs and sausage). First thing, I was impressed by the open pit when walking in, I've always seen the open pit in travel and food shows on TV but I got to see this firsthand, it was amazing! and so much meat on the pit (brisket, pork ribs, beef ribs chicken, no turkey because of avian flu) and sausage hanging from the top of the pit! So my first plate considered of slices lean brisket, 3 pork ribs and thick slices of sausage, the brisket was really thin, but still moist and flavorful, the sausage was good but the pork ribs were the best out of the three. The meat by itself was delicious already but even with Salt Lick's original BBQ and habanero BBQ sauce it was good, I personally enjoyed the original sauce. Round 2 and 3 consisted of thick slices moist marbles fatty brisket, burnt ends and ribs, the brisket was so tender and moist with the fat in between, and the burnt ends were so delicious. Perfectly seasoned with tons of smoke, the smoke ring and bark were really nice, my last plate was thick slices thin brisket, burnt ends and pork ribs and I basically asked for a box after to take it home. My throat was super dried out  the end, maybe it was the sodium because no matter how much water I drank it didn't help. Also, it's BYOB (being your own beer) so you'll see a lot of people being ice chests and coolers full of beer and just hangout drinking while waiting in line or during the meal. Very awesome first experience, not too far from Austin, so next time I'm back I will definitely re-visit, maybe I'll try the beef rib plate next time.

I know it might seem harsh, but cold over-cooked eggs with bland hash and oily potato strings is not a good breakfast by any measure.\\n\\nLet's start with \\"Phantom Gourmet\\", the television show that I can only surmise takes bribes to write reviews.  I have gone to nearly a dozen restaurants over the past four years based on Phantom reviews and I can assure you they have no relation to the actual quality of the food or service.  This place is rated as the best brunch in Cambridge by the Phantom, but I would contend you would be better off eating donuts from 7-11 than going here, or maybe just skipping the meal all together.\\n\\nOkay, so that was a bit strong.  The food is made for Facebook/Instagram folks.  It's very pretty and the plating was nice.  For the 15 seconds I saw the food coming to the table I was very pleased.  That was the highest point of the experience.  The coffee was okay but oily, like it had sat out and been re-heated (this needs to be said as that is a key part to any brunch in my eyes).  I know someone out there is going to argue \\"You just don't know good coffee!\\"  Well, maybe.  I've been at MIT for 4 years killing myself with the stuff and I know what I like.  I drink coffee everyday, 3-6 cups of it, and I drink it from almost anywhere I can buy it, and never have I had such a gross cup of the stuff, that is except for when I make the mistake of re-heating it in a microwave, and surprisingly that is exactly what this tasted like... \\n\\nI ordered the hash, thinking it would be a nice simple meal.  I need to state that I have a deep love for diner corned beef hash, it is to me simply the best hangover/drinking food known to man.  What came to my table was a concept of hash (meat+potatoes) redesigned by an art school freshman thinking that piling things on  top of each other made them better tasting.  Served in a pristine white bowl with ~1/2 the total food volume consisting of deep-fried shoestring onions.  These \\"onion rings\\" were incredibly chewy and greasy, I had to use a knife to cut through them so that I didn't end up dragging the whole woven mess onto my shirt (which was pretty difficult due to the bowl they were all piled in).\\n\\nThe egg was stark white, the yolk was a hard yellow disk of jelly.  It was prepared over easy I guess (until that point I hadn't realized that they did not ask me how I wanted it, I would have said over easy, but still).  It's pretty easy to cook eggs so they're hot when they reach the table, so it was a real surprise to bite into a cold egg, especially one so over-cooked as to have a solid yolk.\\n\\nIt ended up a good thing that the yolk was so hard though, as the \\"toast\\" they put in front of me was the hardest, most stale and oil soaked brick of bread I have ever touched.  This toast would have made great breadcrumbs.  I however made the mistake of biting into it only to find it wedged around my teeth gouging the roof of my mouth.  With greasy oil dripping from my hand I had to rip the bread out of my face (weird phrasing, but this bread was epic bad!).  As an aside here, they didn't ask me what type of toast either.  I usually go for wheat or rye.  This was an italian bread, very airy with an incredibly tough crust.  Not really appropriate for breakfast foods.\\n\\nNow for the hash!  Is it hash if home fries touch steak?  Is it hash if french fries rub up to ham?  No.  Hash is a delicate mix of meat and potato and spice that makes a man's mouth water and is belly rejoice.  What they made was a mix of fancy sounding meat (tongue and cheek, literally those parts) with skillet fried potato cubes.  That was it.  No co-mingling or mashing or flavor swapping.  Just a stack of small fried cubed potato with some flecks of fancy meat.  The meat was basic in flavor.  Cheek is supposed to be very tender, but the way they had prepared it made it dry and flaky.  The tongue was chewy with some serious browning on the edges.  The size and shape of the meat and potato medley made it such that I had to skewer a few pieces at a time by fork to eat them.  2 pieces of potato, 1 piece meat, chew, swallow, repeat.\\n\\nI tried to work in the egg, that was like wrangling a rubber tire with a pitchfork.  Oh, and those damned onion rings.  They didn't go with anything.  By the time I was half way through with them I was having to chug the dank coffee to get the greasy feeling down my throat.  I ended the meal about half way through the food, which is really impressive when you consider the whole lot of it was probably the size of my fist, making it the smallest brunch I have ever been served.  \\n\\nI paid my bill (~$29 after $5 tip, that's for only 1 person too) and walked out.\\n\\nIn summary, this was the single worst brunch I can recall having.\\n\\nTL;DR  -  Bad hash, bad coffee, not worth it.\\n\\nOriginal posted 9/11/2014."},{"name":"Tiki Rock","address":"2 Broad St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here tonight to celebrate my boyfriends birthday, despite the reviews.

This is such a cute place and it's great to have a new restaurant on the west side.

I'm assuming they want it to be family style with sitting there but I don't love that. There's 4 person tables as well! A fire pit was going outside and you have 2 different outdoor seating areas to choose from, one on the Beltline and one on the parking lot side. Great cocktail and beer selection. Wine selection was a bit sparse. I loved my cocktail I got.\\nThe food needs a little work though. I've been twice, the second time with a group of 6, and neither time has anyone been very enthusiastic about their dish. I got a cheese board and while the cheeses were delish the pairings were a bit odd and it seemed they just do the same pairings for all of the cheeses - pickled vegetables and olive tapenade (that looked horrible but also I don't like olives). Neither of those things really go with cheese. I asked for jelly and they had some good jelly. My husband got a burger and liked it. The trio of salsa, guacamole, and queso was just mediocre and I didn't like the chips themselves, they were pretty thick and flavorless.\\n\\nThe service has been really good and friendly. When my mom complained that her oysters were too salty the server apologized and took it and my dads meal off the check which I appreciate a lot. My dad said his chicken sandwich was just odd and instead of being one breast it was two small bone-in pieces of fried chicken.\\n\\nI know it's a new business and I'm excited for menu developments in the future!"},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"We went to Craigie on 6/14/13.

I had about 3 bites of my California Burrito when I went to share a bite with my wife.. she pulled a 3 inch hair off of the bite she took and handed to me. I was grossed out and figured maybe it was an accident of some sort. We noticed another piece intertwined with a piece of the steak from my Burrito. We went to pick the piece of hair up and the whole piece of steak came with it. We told the waiter and he just stared at my wife like we planted the hair in order to get a free meal.

We started with coffee while we waited for Zack and Rachel to arrive... usually, we're the late ones.  It's Dancing Goats coffee, not that I drink enough these days to be a connoisseur.  Being there before 9 on a Saturday meant that there were only a few other groups in the place, so the servers kept taking care of our cups and trying to take our order.\\n\\nI love huevos rancheros, so after reading from Tamara S that the vegos rancheros were so tasty, that was my obvious choice, only without the sour cream.  Jimmy and I split a short stack of pancakes, add blueberries.  \\n\\nThe food came pretty quickly (another reason to grab the young child who wakes you up by 6:30am on a Saturday anyway and just head for breakfast) on heavy stoneware plates with festive decoration.  My huevos came with the sour cream anyway, but at least it was more of a Mexican crema in thin lines over the top than the usually dollop of glop on the side.  They were pretty good, though the eggs, beans, and sauce weren't hot enough to make up for the very cold salsa fresca, and the whole thing was lacking in spice.  I kicked it up a notch with the habanero hot sauce from Belize that was on the table.   The pancakes were good, not too greasy, good fluffy texture.  The fruit cup, consisting of pineapple, kiwi, and purple grapes, was fresh.\\n\\nI'd printed the $2 off a $10 bill coupon.  I'm glad I did.  I'm not enough of a coffee drinker to realize that coffee these days is $2.25!  I understand that it's nice coffee and that it's unlimited, and that they're providing actual cream for it, but coffee is primarily water, so the frugal side of me has a hard time with one cup costing $2.25, particularly since I rarely take the servers up on the offers of a refill.\\n\\nThe service was good, though not particularly friendly, as if it was too early in the morning for them to really be ready to interact with customers.  It's a cute little place with friendly people, bright colors, lots of options to choose from, and I would go again if I lived in the area, but I don't think it's worth the drive from Sandy Springs.\\n\\n#Yelp365 - 100/365"},{"name":"Siros Restaurant","address":"307 Victory Rd","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here with a group for a dinner for Work.

We started with the basket of tots. $9 worth of plain tots is kind of a joke to me and seemed more of a backhanded slap in the face to the old menu fans, basically just to shut them up. Not to mention, Poe's (chef and owner) extremely pompous facebook and istagram post stating \\"heres your blanking tots... now sit down and eat some tacos\\" with a photo of a new tot inspired chimichanga. Way to draw back The Lower Depths loyal customers... I understand that there was a lot of backlash about the menu change, but as a business owner, thats not really a way to get the attention of your previous customers. I apprechiate your effort but, if you're not going to do it right, dont do it at all. This statement also speaks towards your new menus tacos...\\n\\nI ordered the Buffalo Brussels Tacos because, well, brussel sprouts are the best. If you love doucing your food in hot sauce and buffalo sauce and not being able to even taste what youre eating, then this is the taco for you (sarcasm)!! I myself, want to taste what I am munching on, especially if it involves brussels. Basically, they're over priced tacos that are trying to be hip but just arent cutting it. Also, my friends reactions to their tacos were that they are \\"nothing to write home about\\". Do I dare even mention the \\"sides\\" of rice and beans?! You can eat both in two bites, as they come in tiny plastic condiment containers. You could probably get more product out of a FREE mayo packet than you receive here in rice or beans. We also got a basket of the nachos which were honestly, subpar at best. I would even go as far as to say that the old menus pulled pork nachos were better. I guess I am just confused as to why you would change a menu that was so popular, to a menu that is just so mediocre \\n\\nLastly, something has changed with the staff. They were rude, slow, and just didn't seem to be \\"into it\\" anymore like the numerous other times I have come here and have been greeted with attentive and smiling staff. Has the disapointing change in menu rubbed off on them too?! Methinksso.\\n\\nOver all, I wont be returning unless I have no other option. There are a million places that serve WAY BETTER tacos in the Boston I'm /Fenway area. This used to be a place I would reccomend all the time to out of towners or anyone who has never heard of it. Now, The Lower Depths has turned into a \\"the food sucks, but the beer is great!\\" type of place. You guys went from being voted as \\"best hot dogs in Massachusetts\\" to a super mediocore taco joint. Yikes.

The BBQ, in my opinion and preference, ranges from zero to hero, hence the three stars:\\n\\nBrisket - The brisket was not too flavorful, with little smokiness.  I felt I could do better in my home oven.  I tried both lean and moist, and it almost had the texture and flavor of being boiled and baked.\\n\\nSausage - The sausage also tasted like it was straight out of a package that I could buy at HEB.  No real crunch to the skin and the stuffing was overly dense and salty.\\n\\nRibs - The ribs, however, would rate 5 stars on its own.  The only reason I would come back is for the ribs.  The pork spare ribs were done perfectly, falling off the bone.  The seasoning was amazing, with the perfect balance of salty sweetness.  I'm not sure about best BBQ in Texas, but I could easily say best Ribs around.\\n\\nSauce - The Salt Lick BBQ sauce is also a favorite of mine.

Chicken is Very flavorful, tender, not dry, and tastes fresh vs processed like that grilled chicken you get from a fast food place. Staff is pretty friendly too. Only issue is that sometimes it can take what seems like a long time to get the food. (20 min) I've found that the chicken and the lamb take the longest. I've seen a group of people get their meals while 1 person in the group who ordered the lamb waits another 10-15 minutes for theirs.

Beware of miscalculations because Nakato does add an extra $3.75 to their menu listed prices for friend rice instead of steamed rice.\\n\\nI typically always go with Teryaki Chicken which never fails me.

With its blue-ish hue, long bar, and throwback 90's music, the atmosphere is casual and fun. Don't expect an authentic Polynesian experience or inexpensive bill, and you'll be just fine. \\n\\nThe menu of tiki drinks is definitely a highlight, although I was disappointed that when my ScRumpdidliRumptious arrived, it wasn't in the tiki cup that was pictured. It still tasted great! BF got the Calamity Jane which was pretty much the same drink but without alcohol. Both pink drinks came adorned with flowers, which was a nice, tropical touch.\\n\\nWe were going to order a variety of apps and then realized that the Pu Pu Platter ($45) pretty much covers everything we wanted. Plus it comes with FIRE. We nomed on veggie dumplings, coconut shrimp, crab rangoons, mango chicken skewers & beef skewers (which sizzled satisfyingly when you placed them over the flame). This ended up being too much food for the 2 of us, so I would recommend sharing the platter between 3-4 people. At the end of the meal, the check comes in a little treasure chest, which is cute, until you open it and realize how much you have to pay.

I ordered Chicken Xiacuiti with the spicyness level at mild. I also ordered the buttered naan. I put the Chicken Xiacuiti on the buttered naan and it was delicious. The person that I was with ordered the Tandoor Chicken. This was very moist and tasted like an Indian version of fried chicken without being fried.

Well at Fufu Pancake they sure don't mess around. This new pancake shop is a new addition to the food scene catering to the growing Japanese trend. But here's the catch: if you have never had souffle pancake, prepare yourself! Not your typical pancake (as the name suggests), the pancakes are supper fluffy and cute which really makes you feel like you're eating a piece of cloud. Unlike cotton candy, the pancake still retains some structure and good old eggy-ness flavour.  The decor is nice with friendly staff, but the pancakes, although a star when you first see and taste, becomes flat right after that. The serving is not large and with the fluffiness there's actually a lot of air inside - you can actually eat the entire piece of pancake in one bite!

I've heard of the restaurant before and I even checked Yelp reviews before visiting the restaurant so I had high expectations of it. The lighting in the establishment is sort of dim. Everything is moderately priced, however, for the amount of food you get, it's not worth it.  I ordered Pad Thai and the noodles, I believe, were overcooked. The amount of noodles I got were half of the plate. At other Thai restaurants that I've visited, it's usually way more than that. I look around the table, and I guess normally that's how their portions are at Bangkok Thai. I also noticed that they only put like three shrimps in some of the dishes that are shrimp dishes. Some of my friends said that they that liked the dishes they ordered. \\n\\nThe management and staff are really nice. Mama Chai came out to speak to us about the history and even remembered the birthday girl's name. She told us that she cooked all of our dishes.\\n\\nOverall, I believe that if I try other dishes here, such as their curry, I might grow to like the establishment.

We made a reservation and arrived about 5/10 minutes early and were told they were too busy, which was totally fine so we went to wait at the bar. \\n\\nFirst thing we noticed was the restaurant was packed and only one or two tables had any food. It took 15 minutes before we could even flag the hostess down to ask about getting drinks as the bartender was MIA (she also said we would never be sat because we had no reservation and they were just too busy. We reminded her we DID have a reservation and had already confirmed this with her). \\n\\nThere was one waitress for a full restaurant on a Saturday with a show scheduled at the theater that night. When we finally were served drinks the beer was 2/3 Stella foam. The cosmos, aka the most basic drink on earth, were essentially glasses of cranberry and Cointreau with a splash of vodka and so we paid way too much for overpriced poison. Couldn't say anything because obviously the bartender immediately went to hide somewhere. \\n\\nVery little food was being brought out to anyone seated. We saw maybe two or three pizzas come out the entire time we were there and that is probably because the pizza chef (who is behind an open counter when you walk up the stairs to get to the bar and dining room) kept leaving the pizza station to be behind the bar (not to serve drinks or help, just to yell in Italian at the hostess and look around in a confused manner). I've never seen a cook of any sort take so many breaks when a restaurant was so busy or even NOT busy. He was behind the bar more than the bartender. \\n\\nWhen a couple seats opened we decided to take those instead of waiting for a table, but a group behind us said they had been seated for 45 minutes and nobody had come over to the table once. We decided to bail. \\n\\nUpon leaving we found out this restaurant has been operating somehow for FIVE YEARS. I have never seen a place so mismanaged- probably because there was no manager of any sort. The hostess was doing her best and said one server called out which caused the mayhem. Honey, no. The only excuse for that disaster would be if a minimum of 4 servers had called out and the pizza chef had never made pizza before in his life. \\n\\nOther reviews mentioned problems such as these and we should have listened. Hate to leave a review without having eaten the food, but we wouldn't go back even if we were the only people in the place. The only reason they are getting away with this is because of the lack of \\"fine\\" dining options in this area, specifically pizza/Italian."},{"name":"Totto Ramen","address":"169 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"3","text":"I tried their popular, Mega Ramen ($16). It's a big bowl but I thought the ratio of broth to noodles were off. Would've been nice to see more noodles in the bowl, especially if I'm paying this much. In fact, I believe this is the most expensive bowl of ramen in the city. Yume Wo Katare charges $15 for their biggest bowl, which compared to all other ramen shops, they sell the biggest bowl with the most amount of food in the bowl. But I feel like Totto misses the mark on this one for charging so much more for less food. Also, I thought the chicken-based broth was just okay. It wasn't salty, it wasn't super flavorful, but it was just, okay. I kept adding the hot seasoning flakes to give it some kick. I did love their char-su pork though. Probably my favorite next to the pork I get from Yume Wo Katare. The noodles were on par with places like Pikachi or Snappy Ramen -- firm, yellow, and thin. I personally prefer the noodles from Yume Wo Katare or Santouka Hokkaido. \\n\\nThe service was super fast. I went in around noon on a Friday and it was pretty empty. My bowl came out within minutes of ordering. \\n\\nIt's cash only here. I learned that the hard way... \\n\\nOverall, it's just alright for me.

I used to work in the industry. But the restaurant was still pretty full and it was an hour and a half before the restaurant closed.

We got a couple of drinks as well, but were never provided with waters despite the fact that we were clearly there for dinner and not just cocktails. I even asked at one point and still never got one. Still, the bartender was fairly nice and wanted to be sure we enjoyed our food.\\n\\nOn our most recent visit, we went earlier, again grabbed spots at the bar, and quickly ordered our drinks. We were asked if we wanted chips and salsa by two people and were promptly given a batch of chips. Great start. Well, service went downhill. Fast. When I asked for a few more minutes to decide on my dinner, the bartender said no problem. He returned a couple minutes later and took our menus away without saying a word. Luckily I had already decided on my order, but what? \\n\\nOnce we were finally able to flag him down to order, he basically disappeared for the duration of the meal. Our food sat in the service window behind us for a solid 5 minutes despite the bartender making at least 3 trips there for other items.

All I had heard were great things about this place so my expectations were already set pretty high before even stepping inside. When we got there we were seated immediately and the server was incredibly friendly and nice. We ended up ordering the family style meal for $24.95 per person and it was worth every penny. This meal came with unlimited sausage, pork ribs, brisket, potato salad, beans and coleslaw. We also requested bread, pickles and onions which were all free of charge and a jalape√±o which was $0.25.\\n\\nEverything was excellent. When you order you are able to request the type of brisket you'd like: lean, fatty or burnt. We didn't really know what we wanted so we were able to request a little of everything. We also knew we wanted some brisket tips and they were happy to throw a few of those in our plate as well. The rib meat was falling off the bone and the sausage was smoked to perfection with the right amount of crunch on the outside. At the table they provide 2 types of bbq sauce: sweet and spicy. The spicy did have some kick but was overall mild. Both types had their own unique flavor and went well with the meat (if you even chose to put it in your meat).\\n\\nThe coleslaw and potato salad were mediocre, nothing special there. The beans were our favorite side and went really well with the bbq. The pickles were super crunchy and fresh. We didn't know what to expect when we ordered the side of jalape√±o. It ended up coming 1 large whole jalape√±o and had a great, spicy flavor. It was worth the extra small charge.\\n\\nAfter finishing the first plate of meat we ordered another (remember unlimited on everything is included). We picked some at this plate but ended up taking a majority of the second plate home. I recommend getting a second plate regardless of whether or not you'll be eating it simply for the fact that you'll have more leftovers to take home.\\n\\nTo top it all off we ordered the half blackberry, half peach cobbler with ice cream for something sweet. Both cobblers were great but the peach cobbler really outshined the blackberry. Next time I'll just be getting a bowl of peach.\\n\\nI will definitely be coming back and hope to bring the family here for a great meal. Great food and great service that's hard to beat.

This is my ultimate go to and is a steal for only $13 bucks before tax. You can sub the protein, but salmon is my favorite. Beef is good too.\\n\\n2) Sake don. SAKE DON! You get 8, I repeat, 8 fat pieces of salmon sashimi PLUS 3 pieces of cucumber + mango wrapped in salmon sashimi for a total of 11 pieces of salmon. All of this, on top of rice with a side of tempura bits drenched in spicy mayo and a side of ikura. This is my go to for dinner, since the Bento Deluxe is only during lunch.\\n\\n3) I tried the ramen/udon here and it's not that good. Wouldn't get.\\n\\nNot only is the food amazing for the price point but their boba is SO GOOD. I usually either get the avocado shake with boba (sososo good) or their lychee watermelon with boba (genius).\\n\\nHonestly, you can't go wrong ordering anything here. I travel all the way from Boston to Quincy just to eat here. Totally worth the trek!"},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Sooo...the food was really very good! I am from NYC so I'm comparing it to some of the best Italian on the planet. The homemade pasta was delicious. Their sauces are great. Their calamari wasn't anything spectacular. Their burrata appetizer was outrageous! The only downside is there is a very long wait. It is first come first serve. You wait outside in a line and they come out and take you based on the number of people in your party. The place is very small and they really pack you in. We went during the heat wave and the AC was on but barely felt. I asked if it's always like this and was told yes. It was like an oven which only made me want to rush to eat and leave.

I had a great experience. However, my friend didn't like her choice of food. Our server was aloof in the beginning, but was friendlier later on.\\n\\nMy first dish was the foie gras with two slices of french toast. The portion of foie gras was generous, and the taste was very good (not a big fan of peppers). However, with only 2 slices of toast, it was hard to finish the foie gras portion, so I ordered more. Usually, I didn't expect bread to be charged, so when they brought out 2 more, I happily continue finishing my foie gras w toast. Little did I know, they charge $4 for 2 mediocre slices of toast!  I've learnt my lesson and will double check if bread are free in the future. \\n\\nMy main course was the congolaise mussles. The sauce was very appetizing, loving the coconut and tomato blend sauce with herbal flavors. The portion was huge. There were at least 20 mussels in there. The fries were a bit too salty, but it was a side so I didn't really mind. However, some of the mussels were not fresh! Although most were, some still had sand residue (as it's not cleaned properly) and a sour taste with an unpleasant smell (after bitten). \\n\\nLast but not least, my dessert was the chocolate cake. It came out frozen, like a popsicle. I asked the waitress if they could change mine to a less frozen one, they complied but explain to me that it was supposed to be frozen...?

Salted fish board was stacked high with generous amounts of scallop, salmon, bluefish pate, and pickled muscles, plus bread and pickles. Roasted striped bass was decadent with crispy skin and some of the best ratatouille I've ever had. Crispy calamari was good and deconstructed Mexican corn was just a tad on the fatty side. Deep beer list, and dessert of cheesecake was fluffy -- I suspect they use tapioca powder or gelatin to give it a lighter texture.\\n\\nService was a little weird. For a fancy restaurant, no one at the hostess table offered to take me to my table -- they just said \\"feel free to look around for your friend.\\" No big deal, might've been faster for me to strike out on my own anyway.

For $40, it was nice to be pampered with local farm to table ingredients and food that are healthy and don't make you feel so bloated or too full afterwards.\\n\\nThe only thing I felt though was that the wait between the courses were a bit too long and that the ingredients lacked greens/veggies (more along roots/mushroom side).

Contrary to most people who come here, we did not get a charcuterie board so if you want to learn more about that, read another review. I did like how you could customize it any way you want in terms of meats, cheeses, nuts, spreads etc. I would definitely come back another time for that.\\n\\nSERVICE: I often don't comment on service but the service here was very attentive.\\n\\nFOOD: We started with the chopped salad with an amazing honey-lemon vinaigrette and then we ordered the Leoncavallo which had spicy Italian sausage and grilled fennel with big pieces of parmesan. The salad was good, not great (nothing to write home about) but my pizza fan of a dad rated the pizza well and I would agree.

I went with that, which was almost basically an order of chicken and waffles, just with one less piece of meat. In any case, the best piece of food I had was the chicken. I don't normally like meat, and I usually don't eat fried meat, but this was light and juicy and simply delicious. The breading was thin and flavorful, and the chicken was juicy. I loved that piece of chicken. The waffle was too soft but it paired well with the chicken. The French toast was way too sweet, and it had canned peaches. The bread for it was quite normal too; I wasn't too happy with it. It was a lot of food, and it came out to be around $15 post-tax which is actually quite reasonable for the amount of food I had.

This provides a nice overall ambiance to the place.\\n\\nMy party of four came with no reservations on Saturday night (~8:30 pm) and waited for 10 minutes. Within that 10 minutes, we got some beer at the outside bar next door since they initially told us 20-30 minutes wait time. I enjoyed my draft Raglan IPA, even though it was on the pricey side (~$9).\\n\\nMy party was able to sit near the front where the live music was playing. At first, I thought this was great since it would to be so close to the live band, but in retrospect, it was a tad too loud and hard to have a conversation. Next time, I would probably sit further away from the live music and speakers.\\n\\nMy group ordered the combination appetizer platter (Appetizer D'Lirrah), which comes with sausage, scallops, wings, and ribs. All the items were tasty and I probably enjoyed the ribs/wings the most out of all the items. I might get the ribs and wings by themselves next time.\\n\\nThe complementary brown bread was okay, but the olive oil and guinness reduction sauce made it much better. It was surprisingly sweet and went well with the bread. I enjoyed the combination. \\n\\nFor entrees, we got Braised Be Beef and the Shepherd's Pie.\\n\\nThe braised beef came with horseradish mashed potatoes, roasted carrots, and parsnips. The sides were tasty, but nothing amazing. I liked the tenderness of the beef as expected with a braised dish. The taste was also to my liking. Overall, a decent dish with nothing really over the top or amazing about it. I got to try some of the shepherd's pie and much like the braised beef dish, a decent dish with nothing too amazing about it.\\n\\nA good place to go for the ambiance and pub environment, and one of the better dining institutions in DTD.

The pumpkin curry is fantastic, but I almost always resorted to the pa-kee mow (Spelling???)

I will just say that the fish is fresh and delicious (and sustainable, to boot) and the atmosphere was fun. Definitely make a reservation, if possible, as we arrived around 7:15 on a Friday and didn't get a table until 8:30 or 9. But the staff was really friendly and knowledgeable and of course the food was all expertly prepared. I appreciate that they offer accompaniments to the various fish, or you can just order neat as nigiri. I would also recommend mentioning if there are any special fish or cuts that you like, as they may have things that aren't on the menu--on our visit I starting talking salmon belly and our waiter told us they had that and trout belly available. They were quite reasonably priced as well. The sushi rolls were also delicious and really clean, not full of cream cheese and other weird things, just fresh and flavorful. This is the only sushi I have tried in Portland so far and I will definitely be back. I bet it is super-fun to sit at the sushi bar and I can't wait to try the other locations as well."},{"name":"The Avalon","address":"205 N 5th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"Not a fan of Avalon at all.

The problem is the BBQ is average. The atmosphere here is great its lots fun. Its BYOB but their are lots of cops everywhere, you have to park somewhat far away in a dirt lot. Lots of people would say that adds to the aesthetic of the place. I however find it very uncomfortable. Now the highlight here is the Lauren's Spicy Recipe BBQ Sauce, it's a spicy Habanero BBQ sauce with more bang and flavor than almost any sauce I've ever had! Unfortunately I cant rate a BBQ restaurant solely on the quality of its sauce. The meat itself doesn't taste like its been smoked enough. I love BBQ that tastes like its been smoked all day and salt licks BBQ while it does have  more smoked flavor than some place like Rudy's still doesn't have enough for me! Another flaw, is that I went here in the afternoon, when we sat down and started ordering it seemed like they ran out of almost everything.

The last time, I enjoyed the different beers they had, and the grouper on a big bed of spinach was delectable for a very reasonable price.  I ventured back tonight with a group, and was disappointed to see my grouper dish no longer on the menu (at least I didn't see it).  I noted how good the beer choices are, but how limiting their food menu was - not so much in terms of variety, but the level or quantity of food you might be looking for out of a dinner menu.  I mean, it's great for lunch, but dinner should not be just wraps and sandwiches and salads.  I settled on the salmon and caviar pizza.  At $7, it was very reasonable, but the pizza is pretty tiny, and not what you might call a hungry-man's-dinner size.  That's OK for the price, but it really should be billed more as an appetizer so that there are no false expectations that turn into disappointment.  It tasted alright, but MAN, was it chock-ful of sodium.  Perhaps the smoked salmon (salty) and caviar (VERY salty) pairing was not such a hot idea for anyone a heartbeat away from cardiac arrest (that'd be about 35% of the population).  An idea might be to put a little more cheese (it had VERY little cheese) and a little less of caviar and salmon.  Two other things were somewhat disappointing.  One, the topsy-turvy kitchen.  I arrived at least 10 min. after everyone at the big table of a dozen people had ordered, and I got my food a full 15 min. ahead of the next \\"flight\\" of meals that came out (which INCLUDED pizzas like my order), and another 10 min. ahead of the third and final flight.  I felt bad, but it's really not in my control.  Second, they seemed a bit understaffed.  Here we are, first game of the World Series and the Magic's season-opening game (both on TV of course); while they're not full at 7:45 when I left, they were not staffed to handle the crowd.  How many times did I have to flag down the wait staff for another beer?  It's not THEIR fault, as the wait staff seemed pretty sharp in terms of keeping track of who's having what, food and drink.

The upstairs was reserved for a private event and the lower level was closed.  I asked about sitting at some high tables around the bar but were told they were reserved.  I therefore had to get a seat in the main dining area (not around the bar).\\n\\nThere were several screens around.  One near me was playing a basketball game, but it switched to local news shortly after.  I thought this was a sports bar.  I think the channel was just set to the local CBS affiliate and they didn't change it when the news came on.  The other screens were all playing the same game, except for one that had a hockey game.  For a diner in the main restaurant, therefore, there is not much variety of viewing experiences.  There was no audio playing from any game.\\n\\nI didn't see that the food or drink redeemed the restaurant much.  I had the dirty bird sandwich, which I have no complaints about, but there was nothing exceptional about it compared to other similar chicken sandwiches I have had elsewhere.  It had a fairly large deep fried chicken breast with a very crunchy breading on it.  For a side, there are a few choices other than fries, and I asked for the orzo salad, which is a cold type of rice salad that was a little on the creamy side.\\n\\nA big disappointment, though, was the beer selection.  There weren't any craft beers of note in their menu. The highlights were Terrapin Hopsecutioner, Goose Island IPA, and Sweetwater 420.  The remainder of the draft beer options were standard beers like Bud Light.  There were not any unusual or out of the ordinary craft beers as I have ordered at many other sports bars (or if there were, they were not posted on the menu or disclosed by the server).  They advertise taps at the table, but I didn't see many tables with this option.  I noticed that the table near me with taps had a bud light tap and a shock top tap, neither of which is a beer I would want.

Nobody else in town (that I know of) does gf fried chicken, and can I tell you how amazing that crunchy, greasy deliciousness was?! It'll take a little longer than normal, but I promise it's well worth the wait. They fry it in a dedicated cooker (brownie points), and the chicken turns out flavorful, juicy, and perfect. \\n\\nAnd that bucket of mimosas? It cost $24, and 4 of us split it with each getting two glasses. I think that's a fantastic deal!\\n\\nSo why have I been wishy washy on my rating until now? Double Comfort isn't perfect. You can read some of the reviews that talk about this. I've never had a bad experience, but I've definitely had some things go awry.\\n\\nBut they have tons of heart. Loads of it. They're a social enterprise that aims to feed the hungry (not just the hungry customers). They're also incredibly lovely people. I have never met anyone working there who was less than stellar. The people take feedback like pros, and they are genuinely concerned about your experience. Just today, the chef came out to personally bring my freshly-fried chicken and to let me know to wait a few minutes before digging in. He noticed my breakfast potatoes were a tad too overcooked, and he voluntarily brought me new ones!\\n\\nIMO, Double Comfort shines with traditional Southern staples: fried chicken, greens, etc. It's when they step outside of that Southern comfort zone that things can go south (and not in a good way).

When I asked about the veg. option, the waiter seemed to really be surprised and said he was sure they would cook something up, but he had no idea what, and when pressed, still had no idea (and wouldn't check for me).  The first 2 things they came up with were nice little snacks (2-3 bites total, each), but the \\"main\\" thing was a small dish of broth with a few root vegetable slices and a spoonful of rice (and a shave of truffle, which was totally lost in the broth - a real waste).  Amazing to leave a $550 meal (for 2, with prix-fixe wine, TIP) and be literally HUNGRY.  To top it off, after being tipped by my husband, the Valet actually accused us of not being tipped (though he HAD been tipped, since when is a tip something you are yelled at for not giving?!)...when I explained that my husband had just tipped, he STILL insisted and it wasn't until the manager came over that he backed off. Unbelievably rude - I've never seen anything like it.  All in all, a crappy meal:  WAY overpriced;  hardly refined or special food, silly small portions, bizarre service (we just surprise the vegetarians!) and terrible an amazingly unpleasant parking debacle at the end to top it off.

She assured me there would be options that I could enjoy, too.\\n\\nOn my Honey's birthday, they added tasteful confetti to our table, which added to the ambiance.  \\n\\nMy food was very good, and he also really enjoyed his birthday meal.  \\n\\nAnd after dinner, they came over with a beautifully-decorated dessert just for him, with a candle and the words \\"Happy Birthday\\" written in chocolate on the plate.\\n\\nThey helped make it a special evening for my guy's birthday. |\\n\\n[[[The one thing I really wish they'd change (besides the prices, since it was a ding to my budget) is the meat.  I was hoping such a place would be proud to say they use meat from humane farms, free of antibiotics/hormones, cruelty, and fillers.  It would make me feel more comfortable going back there, and would be a boon for animals.  I was sad to hear them tell me there was veal stock in the mushrooms, since baby calves are some of the 'poster-children' for animal cruelty.]]]"},{"name":"Island Fin Pok√© Company","address":"7004 Tavistock Lakes Blvd, Ste 148","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious, fresh, great selection and fast service.

Try the Sunday Brunch or Sunday night meal chef's whim meal options for a cheaper, but likely equally tasty, meal.\\n\\nFor those griping about the lack of fanfare for a birthday, what do you want?

They do have Hibachi tables but I only like to sit at those tables when I come with a party 4 or more.  Reservations are a must because this place gets PACKED!

Forgotten, again, I got up after twenty minutes and asked her to come take our food orders including appetizers. Appetizers were delivered in a timely manner and they were very good but from there the meal took a steep downhill slant. We waited at least another forty-five minutes for our main course orders and, at that, my wife had to get up and ask the waitperson about it. One dish finally came to our table and it was lukewarm. Then the waitperson brought out four bowls of tepid brown rice. The remaining two dishes of our order took another fifteen minutes and, at that, it was only because yet another person in our party actually took up a position outside the kitchen door. \\n\\nThe food was tasty albeit not served hot. Given the apparent myriad of other small restaurants in that immediate area of Arlington, I certainly will not be going back here anytime soon.

It came as a tender 4 oz. filet, a crabcake held together with little filler, and a crispy, moist piece of chicken.  A pretty broiled half tomato brightened up the plate, and my taste buds.\\n\\nThe only negatives of the meal was that the filet arrived a medium pink when I had requested medium rare, and I couldn't seem to find the herb stuffing in the chicken (but perhaps I had subconsciously read that into the menu description...).  Also, the side of spinach au gratin $9.50 arrived looking very much (and tasting very much) like creamed spinach with cheese melted on top.  However, everything tasted good, so I didn't bother saying anything when the waiter came back to check on us.\\n\\nService was pleasant; we were warned against touching hot plates, our water glasses were bottomless, and refills of lemonade were offered.  Black napkins were provided for those wearing black slacks or skirts.  My lunch remains were neatly packed in foil and styrofoam clamshell containers for my future consumption (great for not mixing foods, but terrible for the environment) and bundled into a neat little red/black plastic tote.\\n\\nThe lunch crowd seemed pretty sparse that day, so we had no trouble arriving without a reservation.\\n\\nI may be shooting myself in the foot, but I highly recommend this place for Restaurant Week lunch ($20 and odd cents plus tip/tax), which is normally the only time you would find me treating myself to a meal at Ruth's Chris.  It is a bit pricey to be a regular luncheon haunt after all.  (A pretty yummy looking luncheon sandwich with fries was priced at $16.)  The dessert course is usually this really tasty chocolate mousse which comes on a chocolate crumb crust.  And entree choices typically include both a ribeye and a filet, in all their buttered glory.\\n\\n** RW 3/2010 **\\n\\nI miss the chocolate mousse dessert, but the bread pudding was pretty good.  Crab & corn chowder was thick, but not the normal white creamy potato chunky type of chowder, it was more of a thick broth based, I think, with shreds of crab throughout and sweet corn kernels dispursed within.  Sizzling plate of butter - be careful!  Filet, small, but cooked medium rare as requested - all the better to cook on the hot plate with, my dear.  Crab cakes (2) were basically mounds of crab meat... what filler?

As he worked, he would glance at me periodically. Then, in a large room full of empty tables and booths, he chose to sit at the one table that was directly behind me, and was seated so that he was facing me. This may sound like a harmless behavior, but the effect was unnerving. After ten or fifteen minutes of increasing discomfort, finally I got up to leave. As soon as I stood up to get my coat, he stood up too. \\"You can stay,\\" he told me. This stumped me for a moment. It was as if a) he thought I needed his approval to do anything b) he knew that he'd been making me uncomfortable and c) that he was suggesting I stay anyway. I told him  that I was leaving. He didn't say anything, just went and fiddled with some dishes. I heard him make a little whistle as I walked by him out of the room.\\n\\nAs I left the store, I was bothered by this encounter, but tried to put it out of my mind. What did he really do? I asked myself. He hadn't acted in any overtly sexual or aggressive way. Was I over-reading this? If the server truly hadn't intended anything off-base, then by reporting his behavior, I'd be needlessly getting him in trouble. And even if I did report it, would I be listened to, or just dismissed? Again, I tried to put it out of my mind, but as I I made my way home, my thoughts kept returning to this interchange, and the likelihood that some version of it had happened before with this server, and would happen again. At home, I gave it some more thought, then decided to contact the bookstore. I wasn't up for going all the way back there, on a cold winter night, just to tell them: so I called them up. \\n\\nAs soon as I got on the phone with the manager - I can't remember if his name was Mike, or Matt - right away I got the sense that I was being rushed through something. There was a dismissive, clipped tone to everything this manager said to me. Immediately after I finished relating this story, he said that he knew which server I was talking about - which struck me as unlikely, as I hadn't described the server at all, or given him a name - then told me that the server just wanted to make sure I knew that I could 'hang out' in the restaurant even though it's late (never mind that I had paid to work in their restaurant at around 9:00 PM, and Trident closes at midnight), and that I should \\"feel free to sit anywhere I like\\", as if this weren't a basic privilege granted to any customer. He said he really wished I'd shared my concerns with the front desk. As if I weren't sharing my concerns with him right then and there; as if talking on the phone represented an inadequate form of truth-telling. I hung up, feeling demoralized and weirdly shamed by this man. \\n\\nI have never written a Yelp review. I have enjoyed Trident's bookstore an restaurant in the past. But this whole encounter has soured me on the place. I won't be going back."},{"name":"Little Bangkok","address":"2225 Cheshire Bridge Rd Ne","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place was awesome.

Let me start by saying that I'm from a large Italian family. They literally lived in upstate NY (go Orange) and call handbags \\"pocketbooks\\" and only speak with Italian accents when referencing Italian foods (you get it if you get it) and they're probably too proud of their cooking skills tbh but not once has one of them made a pizza as good as the pizza at Antico. This place is just superb on all levels. The atmosphere is cozy and relaxed, and the BYO drink situation lets us pack our own wine or beer depending on the pizza we're ordering. Now the pie. Oh boy. The crust is delightfully chewy and perfectly cooked, seasoned to perfection every time and never burned on the bottom. The toppings are fresh and full of vibrant flavors. The additional topping station is the most authentic Italian experience -- freshly grated parmigiana, hot red pepper oil, whole spicy peppers, minced garlic, and the boldest and most flavorful olive oil, all available to take back to your table in virtually unlimited quantities. My favorite pie is 100% the Margherita + Pepperoni -- hits the spot every time (doused in oil and peppers of course). Every time I come, no matter how busy it is, I get a seat somewhere, which is worth noting. It's a seat-yourself eatery, but the vibe is so familial that people make room. 10/10 experience every time. Can't wait to go back!

Not really having done much research on the restaurant, I didn't really know what to expect, except for the fact that the BBQ pit was the most famous thing about them. First off, the restaurant was really off the beaten path. It was a few miles off the highway and pretty much like an isolated ranch with not much else around. Once we rolled in, there was plenty of makeshift parking all around. Basically, feel free to make your own parking spot in the lot.\\n\\nLike the parking lot, the restaurant was also huge. In fact, it's probably one of the biggest restaurants I had been to in a long time. It's hard for me to imagine this restaurant ever filling up to capacity with the amount of picnic tables and seats, but I'm guessing it gets crazy on weekend evenings. The menu consisted of the usual by the pound option of the meats, sandwiches and plates/combos. What I loved most about the menu were the myriad of options in the plates section, which came with 1 or 2 meats and beans, potato salad and cole slaw. Not only were we pretty much starving, but we wanted to try as much as possible despite us being just 2 people, so we both ordered plates asap! I ordered the Pulled Pork & Brisket, while my wife ordered the Brisket & Sausage. While my brisket was 100% fatty, which I requested, her brisket was  1/2 lean and  1/2 fatty because she wanted to try both.\\n\\nTo sum it up, it was all really, really good. It was only our 2nd visited BBQ restaurant in Texas (the 1st being Pecan Lodge in Dallas), but it was already up there with some of the best BBQ food we had tried anywhere. The fatty brisket was moist, juicy and very flavorful. It didn't hurt that   their signature BBQ sauce was on it already. The pulled pork was also full of juices as well and tasty. The sides were excellent too. I ate up everything and didn't leave a speck on my plate. As for the sausage from my wife's plate, it was sliced up and had a very good kick to it, which I loved. We both agreed, this was definitely one of the better BBQ restaurants we had been to in a while.\\n\\nBesides the food, the restaurant sells plenty of their own merchandise, including t-shirts, hats and their own BBQ sauce. And, of course, don't forget to take that picture with the famed BBQ pit, which is right by the entrance!"},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"They don't take credit cards, it's cash only.

It was flavorful, juicy and satisfying.\\n\\nThe chimoo was also quite tasty. The \\"chi\\" cken was well seasoned and moist but the \\"moo\\" skirt steak was the stand out here - tender, marinated yumminess.

(Usually I also crave chicken noodle soup to accompany my grilled cheese, but Burger Tex does not have that. They do have the next best thing, which is chili.)\\n\\nFor less than $7, I got a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of chili. Wow. And the guys behind the counter were super friendly. Awesome. Then I drove back to work and found a nice surprise in my to-go box - did they give me two sandwiches? For $3.29, am I really getting what looks like two sandwiches? WOW. I'm assuming this is standard practice and I approve 100%. I had dinner AND lunch for today... for only $3.29. \\n\\nThe bread for the sandwiches appeared to be their burger buns flipped inside out. You have a choice of white or wheat and the bread was pretty good. (This coming from a person who doesn't like bread pretty much ever.) There was plenty of warm, gooey cheese and the sandwich wasn't too greasy. (Lots of grease = one sad Courtney.) \\n\\nThe chili was great at the beginning, but, as I tried to finish my bowl, I found myself unable to do so. The chili was a little bit too salty, even for my tastes. (I seriously love salt, y'all.) I don't know if this is an everyday thing or just a one-time thing, but I am definitely willing to eat their chili again. Most important part of their chili? NO BEANS. (You guys remember how this goes - I love beans, but not in my chili.) They also give you a few packets of saltine crackers and some cheese to add on top. Yay!\\n\\nOverall, even with salty chili, I would come here again. The chili was still good, my sandwich fed me for two days, and it was really cheap.

The wait staff was friendly as we entered the door, and Kim greeted us and told us to sit wherever. We seemed to have chosen Willa's section. We placed our order and had a pleasant conversation with her but this is where things take a turn. At the 30 minute mark food started being brought out to other tables and Willa was definitely keeping our glasses full as we all waited patiently joking around with each other. At about an hour in Kim came by and apologized for the slow speed, and that the kitchen was understaffed. At 1hr and 20min Willa came back and apologized genuinely about our order not having been put in yet. She promptly entered it and brought us our appetizer almost immediately. Once our food showed up we were still missing things on the ticket (an entire TX 2 Step).\\n\\nThe reason I'm writing this review is not to say anything dissatisfactory about Willa, but to talk about the management tonight!

No smiles and after we went to go talk about the ticket wich only included a free pair of eggs despite the missing 2 step. She glowered the whole time and when we left she immediately and obviously chewed out Willa right in front of customers. \\n\\nWe saw her get chewed out at the register from the car (4:07 AM) and were immediately enraged.

Definitely huge whopping portions of Peruvian + Columbian food!! Came here after a 10-hour day at Universal, and I could not have been more excited to sit down and dig into some food. I was looking for variety different from your typical theme park hot dogs and turkey legs, and this broad menu of latin foods (and high yelp reviews) showed promise. \\n\\nThe decor here is clean and simple, reflective of the efficiency of the staff and quality of service. However, my partner and I were confused when no greeter was available for over 5 minutes to direct or seat us. Eventually, we were seated and plunged into a medley of sumptuous aromas - sweet plantains, seared fish, fruit juices, and tart limes tempted us to order everything on the menu!! Lots of families laughing and relaxing around us. Expect a busy loud atmosphere with lots of kids!\\n\\nWe ordered a plate of 2 beef empanadas and a lulo fruit juice to start. They have a great selection of tropical juices (some flavors are hard to come by!) which can be blended to be water or fruit-based. Loved the juice! Try the lulo, guanabana, or passionfruit if you're feeling adventurous. The empanadas weren't anything to write home about. Wanting a lighter meal, I ordered the soup of the day, which came with fried sweet plantains, avocado, and rice. Exactly what I was looking for! The soup had good flavor and reminded me of soups my mom has made for me (we're Peruvian). The fried plantains were everything that I wanted and more. My boyfriend got the Bandeja Paisa, which is THE Colombian staple (he's Colombian). He really enjoyed the crispy chicharron, but described the steak, chorizo, and rice as bland and lacking salt/ a punch of flavor. This was disappointing since the dish was a bit more expensive than it usually is in the US. However, admittedly we did not try other Peruvian/Colombian staples and we barely scratched the surface on the menu. Our server was attentive, kind, and efficient.\\n\\nIn my opinion, this place's yelp ratings/reviews are inflated. |I still think this is a great option if you have a large party due to ample seating and a wide menu ready to accommodate your friends/family's appetite. They have paper tablecloths, so it's ok for kids to get messy here! Although the some of the dishes I tried didn't reach my desired flavor level, I saw a seared fish come out of the kitchen that looked to die for. I would come back to try this and some margs/more fruit juices! If you're looking for more fancy, refined Peruvian food, look elsewhere.\\n\\ntl;dr - boyfriend and I are Peruvian/Colombian and familiar with these cuisines. Loved the refreshing lulo juice, plantains, and soup of the day but were not impressed with bland flavors of other dishes. Would return for relaxing family time (esp large parties) seeking large portions of latin food after spending all day at a theme park!\\n\\nLulo fruit juice - 5/5\\nBeef empanadas - 2/5\\nSoup of the Day meal - 4/5\\nBandeja Paisa - 3/5"},{"name":"Aki Restaurant","address":"7460 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This place sucks.

I've had Dosas in India and these were better!\\n\\nFor those that have never had a dosa, it is similar to a French crepe but much larger and they are cooked longer so the crepe itself gets browned and crisp. \\n\\nThere are several fillings to choose from (including vegetarian options) and the filling gets spread on top of the crepe as it's cooking. Then the entire crepe is folded over in thirds and cut in half so you can eat it with your hands. \\n\\nMy go-tos are the lamb kheema (favorite!) which has just the right blend of sweet and spice mixed in with the ground lamb; and the chicken masala with that signature tomato butter sauce.

You must eat there all the time!\\" Truth is I rarely eat there as I think it's good for what it is but when you have lived in the thriving metropolis of 78619 all your life....it gets old...fast.\\n\\nI did venture over there today for a quick to go order. I drove my brisket and pork rib plate back to the ranch and the food was on point with my previous visits. The 2 ribs as usual were a perfect fall off the bone tender with just the right amount of crisp to the exterior. I made it known when I ordered that I wanted fatty brisket and the request was carried out without hesitation. Three nice slices with ample \\"bark\\" made this the brisket I've had from the Salt Lick in a long time.\\n\\nThe sides were their usual and my only complaint is that I would have rather had the tater salad and the slaw in a separate container. Both sides were warmed by the meat in the same container. I'll ask for a second container next time to preserve the temperature of the cold sides. With that said, Salt Lick still continues to impress folks from all over the world and yes....sometimes local bumpkins as well"},{"name":"Kal√©","address":"50 SW Pine St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great spot.

The service was very good and the atmosphere was nice. \\n\\nBegan with a bottle of wine and a basket of fresh bread. Instead of an infused olive oil the bread was served with some kind of bean/cheese dip(I think?). It wasn't very flavorful and I didn't like the consistency for bread dipping so I asked the waiter if he could bring olive oil instead and he brought it right out. Problem solved. \\n\\nAppetizer was fried calamari. Perfectly prepared. It was lightly breaded, not greasy at all and lightly drizzled with something magical. Cooked to perfection, not too chewy like calamari can be. Possibly the best calamari I've ever eaten. \\n\\nI chose the risotto for my main course. Once again, prepared perfectly. The asparagus was still a little crispy, just the right amount of pancetta to add savory flavor, tasty mushrooms, and it held together exactly as it should on the fork. Warm on the outside and hot on the inside. Absolutely top notch. \\n\\nMy wife ordered the Fettuccini Positano. She loved it. I only had a bite but I can say that the sauce was tangy and delicious, the pasta was fresh and the seafood was delicious.\\n\\nOur waiter was very nice and attentive. There was a hovering busboy at one point which we weren't thrilled about but not a big deal.

I started off with their beef empanada and was quite amazed at how crisp and delicious they are. Never tried an empanada with rice in it which is more of a Columbian variant. Wished I ordered more than one since I wanted to try so much from the menu. The ceviche mixto was a good portion. Tortilla chips or plantain chips would have took it up a notch. The skirt steak was decent but the fried plantains stole the show for my kids. They went bonkers for it. The rotisserie chicken didn't disappoint at all. Crispy skin and juicy meat.

But there's no meat in this dish. I wasn't sure what was making up the smell. My sister made a comment about the smell too. \\n\\nNow the taste. Overall, the individually ingredients tasted fine. Together, it was a mix of too many things.

I went with my friend, and my 2 years old. I had the Crispy Brussel Sprouts and Cowboy Queso for me, and the kids quesadilla and fruit for my kiddo. My friend ordered the special of Salmon Benedict. The server seemed like he was in a rush although there wasn't a lot of people in the restaurant, but no worries. I was just there enjoying my time with my friend, and kiddo. \\n\\nWe get the food and it's always really irritating with the servers hold the food over kids head. I've served for years, I know to hold it on the side away from the toddlers, but still didn't make a big deal at all. All of the food was lukewarm but we didn't care. \\n\\nWhen my friend got her meal, it was put together really strangely. We kinda looked at the menu and compared. We noticed there was no hollandaise, and the egg wasn't poached it was literally a hard boiled egg when chunks of salmon and some steamed onions.  STILL we were like \\"Oh well, guess you shouldn't have taken a chance\\" and laughed it off. Not even 5 minutes later the manager came over and was like \\"So, you guys have a problem with your dish\\" she was being very nice, but we were all super confused because we didn't say anything to the server, it was so strange. It's like the server knew that dish was terrible and tried to do damage control instead of just asking us himself. So, after we established there was nothing wrong (she was just going to eat it anyway) we can hear the server talking super loud about us. It was just a really odd vibe from the start.  He never checked on the table, we always had to get his attention ,which I hate doing in fear of looking rude. He didn't split our checks, or and if we wanted anything else (I wanted to order another drink). He just seemed like he wanted us to leave. When we were leaving he was saying \\"Bye\\" at the front, when he saw us coming he just walked away.

In 2018, the age of debit cards and apple pay, I don't see why any restaurant would think cash only is a reasonable expectation, especially without immediately nearby (there is a BOA atm across the street but no one likes stressful runs or atm fees).

I've been here four times now, and aside from their extremely impressive beer menu, I always leave feeling like \\"well that was mediocre\\". \\n\\nFirst, it's super loud and claustrophobic. As a bar, that's fine... as a restaurant, not my favorite. Tonight while leaving, I accidentally hit a woman with my derriere while trying to squeeze between two occupied chairs (the only way to exit). I have a large booty, but that's a first for me. \\n\\n The cellar room is a pretty cool private room and our sever (who was a manager) was nice, albeit a little odd in how she handled my husband asking for no cucumbers. Rather than obliging like she should have, she told him \\"it's like a salad and you can just push it off to the side\\". My husband isn't real confrontational, so he said \\"Oh ok. That's fine.\\" But it wasn't fine...it was on top of his steak, which then made the steak have the flavor of cucumbers (which he hates). He was pretty unhappy about it.\\n\\nMy rating of 3 stars is based on the meh food experiences I continually have here, not the service nor the beer menu. Tonight we ordered the goat cheese, flank steak, and fish and chips... If I am being honest, the menu is small, and I couldn't really find anything that got me excited. \\n\\nGoat cheese: battered in coarse cornmeal and sitting in a pool of honey. The cornmeal wasn't crispy and was honestly just a really weird texture. I'm a goat cheese fanatic, and there were two left on the plate even after we offered them to other people at our table. Not good. \\n\\nFish and chips: Perfectly cooked fish with a beautiful fry... in SUPER salty breading on top of a bed of soggy, limp, cold fries. This was my meal, which ended up being eaten mostly by a friend of mine who is a chainsmoker and doesn't mind loads of salt. The fries went untouched. \\n\\nFlank Steak- Cooked well and tender, flavor was great (I like cucumbers), fries were sad and limp as well. \\n\\nSide of Mac and cheese- This was the best item of the night (and also what I remember liking from previous visits). Chewy noodles, cheesy, and delicious. \\n\\nOverall, I honestly don't see how this place gets repeat 5 star reviews for anything other than the beer menu."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Let's keep this short and just agree that you should go already...\\n\\nRow 34 is Boston's BEST seafood restaurant (there is also a second location in Portsmouth NH), with fantastic oysters (they are part of the restaurant group that is associated with Island Creek Oyster Farm in Duxbury MA, which raises the best oysters in the US), Boston's best lobster roll (both cold and hot versions), great beers and wines, and excellent, passionate, relaxed service.\\n\\nYou will often find Island Creek Oysters and \\"Row 34\\" oysters on the menu, both of which are raised by Island Creek, which makes a fun comparison.

So when I finally decided to man-up and make my way through the countryside to Driftwood, you could say I was nervous. And even when I walked in and saw the rare open pit that I had seen on TV, that doubt still lingered in the back of my mind. \\"Yes, it does look as good as it did on TV. But does it actually taste THAT good? Is it really possible?\\"\\n \\nThe answer, my dear friends, is yes. Yes it does. I reached for a rib first because, well, I love ribs. The flavor and texture of that rib was incredible. Then I added some of the habanero sauce (which is a little sweet and a little spicy) and I couldn't have wanted anything else. But of course I did have something else. I reached for the brisket. Now I wasn't as excited about this as I was about the ribs because I usually don't order brisket. Why? Because it tends to be dry. Not so with this bad boy. You can squeeze the brisket and see the juices flowing out of it. And per Yelpers' recommendations, we requested the burnt ends. Now this does not mean they're actually burnt - they're just caramelized in all of its goodness. And what did it taste like? Oddly enough, it tasted like candy. It tasted like heaven. It tasted like all-that-is-good-and-great-in-this-world. If given the opportunity, I'd request this as my final meal. It is phenomenal. I wish they could deliver all of the burnt ends they ever make to me.\\n \\nThe sausages, while good, pale in comparison to the ribs and brisket.

I know that Copper River Sockeye Salmon from Alaska is in season now, and that was being touted on their chalkboard near the front entrance.  So, of course, I ordered the wood-fired Sockeye Salmon since it was a seasonal special.  It was very good.  I liked the charred surface of the piece of fish, but it was still moist and flaky on the inside.  The simple preparation was good too, allowing the flavor of the salmon to come through without being covered up with any heavy sauce.  There was a wedge of lemon and a small scoop of herb butter, and that was all I needed.  Our waitress was very friendly and efficient, and that made dinner all the more pleasant.

Well, look - I wouldn't mind the expense if the toppings were more plentiful.  The only time I have a problem paying $23 for a sausage pizza is when there are EIGHT pieces of sausage on the entire pizza.  Eight.  That's it, I counted them.  When I order a $25 pizza from my other favourite joint the toppings are plentiful.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\n- the pizza is cooked in an oven of insane hotness.  What this means is that this place is designed for quick turnover of customers.  You get in, order your pizza and you're out within ten minutes.  I can stop by Antico after leaving work, pick up a pie and head home.  Can't think of any other pizza joint where I could do this.  Even the crap pizza from Papa Johns takes 20 minutes.\\n\\n- the taste is unbelievable.  It's just the perfect combination of spices, sauce and crust.  \\n\\nSummary: The taste keeps this place at four stars.  If it weren't for the quality of the goods, the sparsity of the toppings and the price of the pie would downgrade this to a three star review.  But, wow.  The taste is the best.

Next, we ordered the spicy fish fillet broth, which we always order at any Sichuan restaurant. They put a lot more fish in this dish than any other restaurant I've been to. The taste of the fish is not over-powered by the spices like it is at Fortune. This isn't a good or bad thing. Just a simple observation.\\n\\nI can't wait to come here again.

It was Valentine's Day and I wanted to go out and do something but there was no way we wanted to make reservations, run with the crowds and pay too much for a meal and booze. I made my husband's favorite for lunch that day and Mozart's popped in my head. I figured we could go for afternoon coffee and dessert, perhaps we'll catch the sunset while we are out there. My plan was working out great. Off we went for a Valentine's outing. We even took Samuel our dog because I saw that it was dog friend out on the patio. Parking is always tricky when you go to this area because there's Mozart's and then two other restaurants. We got lucky and were able to park across the street with no problems.\\n\\nWe walked onto the patio and there wasn't very many people there. Eric and Samuel found a spot and I went inside to order drinks and a treat. As I walked to the counter I noticed there were two places to order. There was a lady that was already be helped so I stood behind her at a bit of a distance so that it didn't feel like I was crowded her. As I was standing there I did notice that only one of the stations had a cash register. I patiently waited....waited....a group of 4 girls came in and they were oogling over all the cases and one was standing kind of next to me but more to the side of the lady that was finishing up her order. I swear I was standing there for like 5 minutes but it's ok the lady had questions about all the desserts and she seemed like she was making a thoughtful decision about her drink choice. I'm not mad at her for that...what I was mad at was when the guy behind the counter was finally done he immediately started helping the other girl who walked in after. I gave it a second to see if the guy would notice but clearly I was invisible to him. I was getting pretty pissed off because so I had to speak up \\"So where exactly are we suppose to place our orders here (pointing to one side) or here (pointing to the other).\\" This girl gave me this crazy look and continued talking and the guy finally asked who was next. \\"I've been standing here for awhile waiting to place and order. But no that's ok go ahead and take her order I'll be here waiting.\\" The girl that basically cut in front of me looked at me and said \\"Oh were you in line waiting?\\" Are you freaking kidding me?! No I'm just standing her for fun because I have nothing better to do. \\n\\nME \\"No that's fine. go ahead and finish your order. I'll be here waiting my turn.\\"\\nGirl \\"No you go ahead. My order might take awhile.\\"\\n\\nI waited to see what the guy would do and he invited me up to the counter to go ahead and order. My blood was boiling and I was really pissed off. Service is such a big deal for me and it's very near and dear to me. If you're working in the service industry you have to be aware of your surroundings and make mental notes of people as they walk in and when. As I was placing my order for small Chai Latte, small Latte and a cheesecake he began to ask me when I came in, how long was I standing there because he didn't see me. Oh my gosh! I told him I walked up shortly after the lady he was helping ordered. I had been standing there waiting looking at the drink menu and the case. He just kept telling me oh I didn't see you. I think he said sorry once but I was pretty pissed off. All I wanted was to come in, enjoy some treats and enjoy the view with my Valentine's. \\n\\nOur drinks were hot and tasty, the cheese cake was delicious. The fruit on top was the best and I loved how you can taste a little bit of sugar crystals in the graham crust. Food and drinks were great. It would be 4 stars but I can't look past the service which is why this is a 3 star review. \\n\\nI remember coming here back in the day when it was slow and there were times that it was super busy and they were always on their \\"A\\" game. I never had any service problems. I guess fast forward decade and the people have changed and I guess service has gone by the way side. I will go again because I love the ambiance but my service better be spot on. I'm getting older and I don't need a stupid service issue to make my blood pressure go up. I thought I was coming her to relax and enjoy the view not get stressed out with high blood pressure.

The first time in 2014 and recently on a family trip in October of 2018. The food was good enough the first time when I had been solo on a business trip to convince my family to abandon Disney World to get some good off-site food. I was worried that my 4-year memory of the Chaufa Mixed Rice might have been overblown or nostalgic. It wasn't--it was just as delicious on our recent visit. My husband ordered the skirt steak, which was also very tasty--though we both agreed that the Chaufa stole the show. We also love both of the sauces (green and white) that are provided with the food.

The space is small. Each cook kind of comes up with their own dish and thus the spread of food you will eat is each unique yet brilliant. Some dishes were strong in flavor with saltines and spices. Others were more traditional Asian with lighter flavors to the palate.\\n\\nIt is such a fun experience to try the 16 course.\\n\\nSome tips:\\n\\n1. Getting reservations suck. Off hand you can try 3 months ahead of time for a party of 2-4. Good luck trying to get a bigger party. The space itself is tiny. I heard if you are a single person trying to get it, it's actually quite easy and you can go monthly.\\n\\n2. If you are flexible and you know you want to eat at Langbaan in a certain month, go ahead and blanket try that month. Even if the tickets are sold out, you have the option of going on a wait list. Out of the 15 wait list I tried, I got texted the day off that a spot opened up maybe 6 times. Obviously this requires insane flexibility, but it will get you in faster.\\n\\n3. If you have any food allergies you need to let them know ahead of time.

Not only that, 2,500+ reviews with a solid 4-star average Yelp rating? That certainly grabbed my attention.

The menu is very simple with 10 pre-customized pizzas (5 Rosso [tomato sauce] and 5 Bianca [no tomato sauce - slightly sprinkled with salt and olive oil]) to choose from. The one I wanted to order is Margherita D.O.P., but I couldn't remember what I wanted to order and just let my friend ordered the meatiest pizza - San Gennaro.

The tasting menu looked exciting and had a good use of authentic ingredients. \\n\\nThe appetizers were delicious, then the 3rd plate to the desserts, they were OVERWHELMINGLY SALTY. The saltness was too overwhelming to taste other ingredients.\\n\\nThere was no mouth-clearing plate till the desserts. (The rice with egg was the least salty) Each menu may have tasted okay with one bite but the entire course was awfully salty!!! \\n\\nIt was embarrassing for me to have only one bite per each plate to my friend who booked the table.

It was delicious! Though the beef patty was thin (as it's their usual thing they do), the brisket atop was mouth-watering. Coupled with goat cheese, bacon, and strawberry jam (strange but good), this was a superb burger. Too bad it's not on their regular menu.\\n\\nThe brisket was on point, and the bacon they used was thick and juicy, not at all like those super crispy bacon @ brunch places. So it may seem that The Albert uses quality ingredients.\\n\\nThe hubs wanted a beer, and our server was quick to provide specials. He ended up with an IPA beer with a shot of whiskey for $6. :)\\n\\nThey also have specials toward the end of the menu so check those out.\\n\\nIf we're ever in the area again, I think we'd def stop by this spot."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The best combination of cost, food quality and atmosphere.

Why bother when the barbecue is so good and so reasonably priced?\\n\\nIn my opinion, this place is a gem. It's a small, family run restaurant (the owner's wife runs the register).

The space was nice and I sat outside in their dog friendly patio area. I was so excited because their menu options looked amazing. Then it went downhill from there. I waited for around 10 minutes and no one greeted us. The servers for the other tables flew past without asking if we have been helped...by anybody. I walked to the hostess stand and alerted them of our problem and we finally had a server. The server was super nice but provided the worst service. She completely forgot my soy milk for my coffee and I literally had to raise my hand to get her attention. By that time, I had already finished my first cup and sitting on an empty cup. She seemed to be more interested in cooing at the dogs. Our food arrived and it was pretty decent. I got the seasonal benedict and my bf got the pumpkin french toast. We finished our meals and waited for service. Again, it turned out to be a waiting game. Our server tended to the nearby tables and completely avoided eye contact with us. I had to embarrassingly wave her down again to give her my card. When she came back with the receipt, she forgot a pen and said she would look for one. I waited for another 15 minutes and she never came back with a pen. I ended up making the decision to just leave.

At 530, when they opened there were about 10-15 people in line so I would definitely recommend getting there early to secure a burger.\\nFrom the moment we sat down service was great! The waiter immediately put 2 burgers on hold for us while letting us look over the menu for drinks. Originally I didn't plan on getting a drink but the cocktails looked too good to pass up. I got an Apple of Mai Tai and it was amazing! We were also served complimentary Bread&butter and pumpkin pomegranate hummus. Sooo yummy- but I definitely tried to hold back on eating too much because I knew the burger would be coming soon.\\nWow! The burger was delicious. Juicy and medium rare perfection. A little messy due to the size and juiciness but couldn't possibly complain about that. It is served with a large portion of steak fries as well that were delicious (didn't even need salt- and this is coming from a sea salt lover!) we were also give two small cookies with the check. \\nThis is a great date spot if you are looking to splurge on a burger because they are quite expensive ($26).

I encourage everyone to try when the serve brunch, the shrimp and grits were awesome. I enjoy the hanger steak too, delicious but not enough. In total it was about 3 bits worth. I had a couple other things but those were the most notable.  My friend is on a plant based diet and had very few options.  The peppers were scrumptious, and she enjoyed her salad.  The problem was some of the preparation of the plant base/vegan options were done with meat/poultry which drastically diminished the number of choices.  Our waiters we great. One was fairly new and went to Northwestern and the other was in the acting industry as well, he left during the middle of visit b/c his shift was over.  I am giving this visit 3 /12 4 stars, mainly because we had to keep sending back cups and utensils because they were dirty.  My water came out in the improper glass with substances floating in it. They are strawless, but when you bring stuff out dirty I most certainly do not want to drink from the side of the cup. They need to invest in paper straws. The other reason they aren't getting 5 stars is the lack options for plant based eaters which being a tapas restaurant would be easy to address.

One look at the hand-painted drawing which spanned the entire wall of the restaurant and you feel that you're right on a beach surrounded by palm trees again.\\n\\nThe menu was quite extensive despite focusing mainly on vermicelli and rice dishes. I finally settled with the Bun Rieu, aka Grinded Crab Meat and Shrimp with Vermicelli, only to be told that he (the server) had to check the availability of the crab meat. It must have been my lucky day since they were serving it. I wish I had known ahead of time that by crab meat, they meant the egg mass carried by female blue crabs and by shrimp, they meant dried shrimp. Honestly, those two weren't as surprising as my finding a pig foot and pig blood in my vermicelli soup. Nowhere on the menu did it say that they were included in my soup! (The only reason I knew was because I had asked my mom as I was digging out bits and pieces of who knows what.) A huge plate of veggies and basil came alongside the soup, which ended up tasting quite good.\\n\\nMy mom's Com Suong Bi, aka Porkchop and Shreaded Pork with Broken Steamed Rice, was on the bland side. I think the pork chop lacked certain spices and the sauce that accompanied the dish simply could not make up for the lack of flavoring. The dessert menu consisted mostly of drinks and smoothies, as well as different beans mixed in with coconut milk. A modest selection, but one that would not have satisfied my sweet palate.\\n\\nPrice-wise, it was decent for the amount of food that you get; dishes mainly range from $7-$9.

My low star rating is because not only were we mistreated at the restaurant, but then I sent a letter to the manager 5 days ago and still have heard nothing back.  I was going to give the restaurant a chance to apologize before blasting them here, but since it's been nearly a week since my email, yelp is now fair game:\\n\\n\\"To the Red Lentil Manager~\\n\\nI wanted to tell you about our experience today at your restaurant, because today I had the worst experience waiting to be seated that I have ever endured.  This was not an issue with a slow wait time at a popular restaurant - it was an issue with the neglect of your hostess, Christine, to catch my party of three's name as we were getting our 90-year-old aunt settled (she moves with a walker very slowly).  I had already been annoyed by the rudeness of another patron who squeezed his way into the door in front of us as I was helping our aunt up the curb-cut outside, and when we got in and got seated in the waiting area, I was at least relieved we'd have a spot for our aunt to sit down while waiting, so we decided to stay.  I was never asked for our name, only told that the wait would be 30-45.  The people who came before us were seated within 20 minutes, and we started to get excited that the 4-top they were setting up was going to be soon ours.  Then I saw Christine telling the people who came after us that they were next, and I went up to speak with her, telling her it occurred to me that she never asked for our information - we'd just sat down.  She did not believe me that we'd come when we'd come, and told me that we'd come several people later, as she'd logged us in her book as a 3-person group with no name.  Perhaps that's when it occurred to her to list us, or perhaps that was assigned to another group entirely, but because we'd been so rudely cut off on the way into the restaurant by someone specific, I knew exactly where we fell in the queue, and since the people who came after us were quite distinctively chatty, I also knew clearly that they came after us.  I told her precisely where we came in and in what order, and was told by Christine that, no, we didn't.\\n\\nI can handle a lot at a restaurant - long wait times, mediocre food - I have never before written a letter to a restaurant about their service, but after today's I am compelled to ensure a manager is informed about the experience of a ridiculously agreeable patron.  We sat with a 90-year old woman for 55 minutes while we watched 2 tables of people who came after us get seated, and get their food, and finish their food, and pay, before we were seated.  There was another elderly couple of ladies, one came with a walker, who protested when they were offered to be seated before us, because they knew we'd been waiting for a half hour.  Christine just told them blankly that they only had 2 seats available, not 3.  They apologized to us as they were escorted to their table, which is more than we received from your staff.\\n\\nI understand that mistakes happen, and I give Christine the benefit of the doubt that she truly believed that she captured us at the proper time.  My issue is that there was no professionalism displayed, and no empathy for our situation.  She offered no apology, there was no comp on our bill for the misunderstanding - we were only told that it would be just a couple more minutes, and it wound up being an additional half hour.\\n\\nYour food was good, your service was good, and I've had good experiences at your restaurant before, but I have never felt so disrespected by such a complacent hostess, and your quality of food and service does not outweigh the awful experience that we had this morning.  I hope that this might foster a discussion amongst your staff of professionalism and benefit of the doubt given to patrons, especially when they have someone they are trying to care for in tow.  An apology would have gone a long way.  A free drink or app would have gone a long way.  Instead, heels were dug in without attempt for recompense, and now you've lost a customer as a result.\\n\\nHabitual non-complainer and frequent diner-outer,\\n\\n~Dorise\\""},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This place had the best I grits ever!

Of course, I wasn't expecting that level of quality from this restaurant as its Watertown branch wasn't generating that level of buzz, but I didn't expect to have a bad meal, which is what I got.\\n\\nI had dinner at this restaurant with my mother at 6pm on a Saturday. I ordered the [D4] Hot Oil Hand-pulled Noodles and a drink, and my mother ordered the [D1] Cumin Lamb Hand-pulled Noodles, we also ordered a [C1] Pan Fried Pork Dumplings for the table. I tried to order two Lamb Teriyakis, but they were out (this item doesn't appear on the online menu but is listed on the restaurant menu for $1.49 each). You're gonna want to remember that last part.\\n\\nThe restaurant was pretty busy, we personally didn't have to wait in line but people that came in after us did, although the line wasn't big. This restaurant seems to do a lot of take out business on Saturday nights. We were seated at the front at the window and the service was quite bad. It took frustratingly long for our order to be taken, I also never received my drink so I had to go up to the front desk and ask for it. My mother also asked for a fork which never came so she had to get it herself.\\n\\nThe dumplings were not regular dumplings, they were Peking Ravioli, I like Peking Ravioli, but my mother does not, so it was weird that they weren't just called that on the menu. For those of you who don't know the difference, Peking Ravioli has a really thick wrapping making it a very heavy appetizer. As Peking Ravioli goes, these were some of the best I've had, and for me personally, were the only highlight of the meal. But again, they aren't called that on the menu, which I consider a pretty big problem.\\n\\nThe quality of the hand-pulled noodles themselves are good, they are thick and flavorful, which is what I expect. I wasn't blown away by them, but they were pretty good. As for what they put on those noodles, however, is an entirely different story.\\n\\nThe [D4] Hot Oil Hand-pulled Noodles were pretty bad, simply a matter of using way too much Szechuan chili oil. Generally when chili oil is used as an ingredient in a dish, it is used sparingly as to not overpower the taste buds with the somewhat sweet and tangy oil taste. For some, an excess of chili oil can lead a dish to be too spicy, although I personally don't find chili oil to be all that spicy, really. Because there really isn't much else in the dish other than chili oil, the noodles taste of it strongly, and considering the huge portion size, it's really hard to get through. I would like to mention that I didn't find this to be disgusting, just very unpleasant, it's certainly edible.\\n\\nHere is where it gets nuts:\\n\\nThe [D1] Cumin Lamb Hand-pulled Noodles which my mother ordered was the strangest dish I have ever encountered at a Chinese restaurant in my entire life. The dish smelled and tasted as if it were full of taco meat, I kid you not. Me and my mother were astonished at how much this noodle dish tasted like tacos. I've had a few Chinese cumin lamb and beef dishes in the past and none of them even remotely tasted like this. Now, if you are the sort of person that wants taco flavored noodles, this would certainly be the dish for you, as it is literally just that, and it didn't taste terrible, but that isn't what the dish is supposed to be, and this was certainly not a cumin lamb dish.\\n\\nTin foil hat time:\\n\\nRemember when I said that they were out of teriyaki lamb? Isn't it interesting that they were out of chopped lamb for one dish but had it for another? My mother told me that she didn't think the \\"lamb\\" in her cumin lamb tasted at all like lamb, she thinks it tasted more like beef. So here's our theory; we think that they had at some point ran out of lamb and for one reason or another, couldn't get any more. Instead of dealing with that problem by not serving the cumin lamb noodles (which seems to be one of their more popular offerings in Watertown) they decided to substitute the lamb for beef. We think at that point they were unsatisfied with how the normal cumin seasoning tasted with the beef substitute and therefore further substituted the cumin for pre-packaged taco meat seasoning (which contains cumin). I think the chaos of a busy grand opening may have made them feel pressured to make this dish work with whatever they could.\\n\\nThat's the only reasonable explanation I can come up with for why that dish tasted like it did, because no one else on Yelp seems to have had this really obvious problem. I don't throw around this sort of accusation lightly, but it's either that, or this CHINESE dish just naturally tastes EXACTLY like tacos and NO ONE has ever mentioned it online!\\n\\nAll in all, the food quality was at about a 3, but considering everything, I won't be dining here again."},{"name":"Kal√©","address":"50 SW Pine St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Êó•Êú¨„ÅÆ„Åì„Å†„Çè„Å£„Åü„Ç´„É¨„Éº„ÅåÈ£ü„Åπ„Çå„Çã„ÅäÂ∫óÔøΩ?ÂÆ∂Â∫≠„ÅÆ„Ç´„É¨„Éº„Åß„ÅØ„Å™„Åè„ÄÅ„É¨„Çπ„Éà„É©„É≥„ÅÆ„Ç´„É¨„Éº„Å´Ëøë„ÅÑÔøΩ?Â∫óÂÜÖ„ÇÇÊ∏ÖÊΩîÊÑü„Åå„ÅÇ„Å£„Å¶ËâØ„ÅÑÔøΩ?Â∫óÈï∑„Åï„Çì„ÇÇÊó•Êú¨„ÅÆÊñπ„Åß„ÄÅ„ÉÜ„Ç≠„Éë„Ç≠„Åó„Å¶„ÅÑ„Å¶ÊÑü„Åò„ÇÇ„Çà„Åè„ÄÅÊñôÁêÜ„ÅÆÊèê‰æõ„ÇÇÊó©„ÅÑÔøΩ?„Ç´„É¨„Éº„ÅÆ„Éê„É™„Ç®„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥„ÇÇÂ§ö„Åè„ÄÅÊ©ü‰ºö„Åå„ÅÇ„Çå„Å∞„Åæ„ÅüÈ£ü„Åπ„Åü„ÅÑÂë≥ÔøΩ?ÁÑ°Êñô„ÅßÈ∫¶Ëå∂„Åå„ÅÇ„Çã„ÅÆ„ÇÇÊó•Êú¨„Çâ„Åó„Åè„Å¶Â¨â„Åó„ÅÑ„Çµ„Éº„Ç∏„Çπ„Å†„Å®ÊÄù„ÅÜÔøΩ?,2019-08-12 00:30:25\\n2u_w3rthRzR2uEihW5BC4A,Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston,355 Hanover St,MA,Boston,02113,42.364591299999994,-71.053358,4.0,3520,1,Nightlife"},{"name":"Memories of Peru Pollos a La Brasa","address":"8204 Crystal Clear Ln, Ste 1600","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here with my boyfriend for dinner.

The spuds and scrams are just loaded potatoes and are a delight for any potato lover. Speaking of potatoes, the biggest and only downfall here are the potatoes. I love eating potatoes for any and every meal and am not very picky with how it's made. However, the potatoes here are just sad and bland. They are soft and mushy and lack flavor. The only reason I like the spuds and scrams (noted above) is because it is overloaded with cheese and meat to outweigh the bland and soft potatoes.

Our waitress promptly greeted us, she was very sweet as were all the other employees we encountered. Their BBQ is a little bit more on the pricey end than other places we have tried, but honestly, it was some of the best we have had. We both got the Thurman's Choice plates so we could try a little bit of everything. Their sauces were the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. Their ribs were incredible. I am usually not a fan of dry rub ribs but my mouth is watering just thinking about theirs. I wasn't the biggest fan of their sides, but it really seemed like good homecooked food, which I liked. If I had to choose just one side, I think I would choose the potato salad, which I think had some of their BBQ sauce in it which gave it a yummy, but unique flavor. We took a peach and blackberry cobbler to go, both of which were really yummy. By the time we left, which was at about 1:15, there was quite the line and crowd of people out front.

They were acceptable but nothing to write home about.\\n\\nThe large crowds that are accommodated at Salt Lick cause the experience to be less \\"old school\\" barbecue than other places that are just as well known that we visited, but Salt Lick manages the crowds well.  I was not crazy about the sauce and one of the plates brought out had the sauce already on the meat, which was likely to hide the fact that the meat on that plate was a little dry.   \\n\\nOut of the four different barbecue places we visited over four days, the staff was by far the least personable and friendly.  \\n\\nThe only thing \\"old school\\" left are the cash only policy and byob policy.  Both of which are not ideal for a place that is trying to accommodate the masses.  \\n\\nOf the four famous barbecue places we visited, Salt Lick is the place to which we are the least likely to return."},{"name":"Daawat","address":"500 W Canyon Ridge Dr, Ste L-275","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"My original plan was to stop at Verts to get a pita but the strong smell of curry drew me in from the parking lot. I noticed they had a lunch buffet so I decided to give it a try. The buffet was halfway decent but the service was abysmal. Perhaps there was a language barrier but there was no communication from the waitstaff. I sat at an open table, a waiter brought me a lukewarm cup of water, said \\"buffet?\\" To which I said \\"yes\\" and that was it. The restaurant was warm and loud inside. I'm not sure if their A/C was functional. By the time I was finished with my meal, I couldn't  tell if someone was going to bring me a check or if I was to pay at the counter. I tracked down my waiter, showed him my credit card and he pointed to the counter. I went to the counter and stood there for about 5 minutes before someone showed up. There was no \\"how was your meal?\\", \\"how is your day going?\\"...nothing. He held out his hand to get my credit card without telling me how much to pay or anything else for that matter. I paid my $11 for the buffet and left.\\nTo sum it up...a tad bit overpriced and \\"ok\\" Indian food. Miserable service, warm and noisy restaurant.

It opened only last year, and it has already become a total hit! I've had a couple of food items here, and all of them have been pleasant. Nevertheless, I do play favorites.\\n\\nOkay, let's get right into it from order of favs:\\n\\n1. The gyro plate comes 'open face' with delicious meat - the term 'open face', I was informed, means that it comes by itself, not wrapped in anything-, extremely good and well seasoned pitas, tomatoes, onions, and a mouth watering white sauce called tzaziki for $8.95. There was a period where I would only want to eat this for lunch. I was officially addicted to it, and I had to attend gyro anonymous meetings to cope and everything. But, I'm all good now. \\n\\n2. The gyro sandwich comes in a generous size, and it is very scrumptious. The spiced meat, salad, condiments, and tzaziki sauce will take you out of this world. It is all rolled up perfectly in a tasty pita. Make your taste buds and tummy happy with $7.95. \\n\\n3. The Europa combo comes with delicious gyro, chicken souvlaki (Well seasoned chicken pieces on a stick), tomatoes, onions, tzaziki sauce, and pita. Bring it home for $9.25. \\n\\n4. While the chicken pesto panini is good too, I would consider it my least favorite from them all. It has grilled chicken, roasted peppers, provolone, and pesto on a ciabatta square. It will do a damage of $7.95 to your pocket. The other items are just very delectable, so this one is certainly overshadowed.\\n\\nHave any of these with either a side of fries or Greek salad. However, I would advise on getting the salad because greek salad is just sooo good. Period. The right amount of tangy flavor and cheese. \\n\\nThey offer many other food items that I have yet to try. For instance, you can make your own salad with the varying condiments they have. If you're overwhelmed by the options, you can try one of their signature salads instead. They have many other hot and cold paninis to satisfy everyone's likes. Finally, you can also order from their rotisserie and daily menus."},{"name":"MADdogs Gourmet Hot Dogs","address":"1900 NE 162nd Ave, Ste D114","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Staff was very strange.

Go stand over in this corner\\". Not so long after that, a man walks out and brings one of the orders so I ask the man at the counter, who now I have presumed is the manager, \\"excuse me, so I'm guessing this is where they'll bring the To-Go orders?\\" He replied VERY rudely \\"YES but you're waiting on two orders correct? Okay then so continue to wait. I don't know why they have you picking up two orders anyways. That doesn't make sense\\".

This is one of my sister's favorite restaurants in Cambridge and she had given me a gift certificate to try it.  I made a reservation in advance via opentable and then was called in follow-up. I appreciated the call and liked that they clarified whether we had any special diet requests. I'm gluten intolerant (celiac) and dairy free.  They seemed to immediately understand my request, which I figured would simplify a lengthy explanation at the restaurant.  That was not the case. At the restaurant, 2 waiters confirmed my food preference as gluten free. The waitress wanted to know if I was okay with \\"prepared stocks.\\" I explained that I was if they were gluten free. This then involved a lengthy conversation about soy sauce in stocks and the fact that they use gluten-containing soy sauce, and she wanted to know if that was okay. I had to emphasize that it wasn't. Later they promised my fiance bread, but then they didn't bring it because I was gluten free (he's not, which we had made clear from the get-go). Within 5 minutes of putting in my order, we could hear the head chef quizzing the kitchen on what celiac is.  After our meal, the waitress then wanted to know all about my medical history, why I had celiac disease, what symptoms I had, how I was diagnosed and how I felt after going gluten free. She reportedly was very interested because she thinks a friend of hers has celiac (I'm not sure why this friend just doesn't go see a doctor and not seek advice from a waitress). I'm happy to educate people, because I'm an MD so I shifted into work-mode, but to be honest, when I go to a restaurant and I pay $70+ per person for a meal, I expect both good food and good service. Craigie on Main provided good food, but not good service. Celiac disease should not be the theme of my meal and my conversation when I go out to eat.  I wrote Craigie to express my concerns and they never responded.
