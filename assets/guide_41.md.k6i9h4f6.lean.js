People actually like this place?  It was our first time there and we definitely won't be returning.  The menu screamed desperation to be different and trendy - food pairings that seemed to make no sense and obscure (but trendy, I'm sure) ingredients.  It was not busy and we sat at the bar.  There were only 2 other people seated at the bar and it was not exactly hopping in the dining room, so why it took so long for someone to acknowledge us and take drink orders, I don't know.\\n\\nThe food was OK, not outstanding by any means.  The lobster bisque had a good amount of lobster in it, but seemed a bit bland.  My entree was the lobster roe noodles, which sounded interesting, but really just puzzled me.  Why braised short ribs and lobster together?  I felt like I was eating two different dishes thrown together.  My husband also had the lobster bisque, shrimp cocktail (the shrimp were huge) and a burger and fries.  The fries were so greasy as to be inedible.  \\n\\nThe service was nearly non-existent.  It took much too long to get drinks, considering there were at least two servers behind the bar and only two other customers seated at the bar when we sat down.  Our end of the bar appeared to be the \\"watercooler\\" of the employee breakroom.  There were usually 4-5 servers gathered around, chatting about their personal lives, eating (on break?) and sharing samples of some bartender creation.  Two of the servers were clearly conducting a bit of a handsy flirtation behind the bar (we saw them put on a little more demonstrative session outside as we left).  Our overall impression was that they considered themselves too good to have to try and customers were a mere annoyance to spoil their workday socializing.  Only one guy bothered to inquire about our meals and he appeared to be the low guy on the totem pole, judging by how the others ordered him around.  \\n\\nNext time we'll go somewhere where they don't try to fool you into thinking the food is good just because it's expensive and where the wait staff actually understands what job they are being paid to do. \\n\\nI've read Yelp reviews for years when looking for a restaurant to try but I've never submitted my own.

They have wonderful employees (that word sounds terrible, they're \\"friends\\"), good beer, good food, no smoking, mellow lighting, no TV, and live music all the time.

I have never been wowed by this place, but I have enjoyed the atmosphere and food enough to return numerous times. That being said, I will never be back.\\n\\nMy roommate and I went for BBQ tonight, trying to support local and trying to avoid the always packed Fox Brothers.  We entered to see that all but a couple of the tables were occupied. We grabbed a two top table in the corner and waited...and waited...and waited. After about 20-25 minutes, a waitress finally came over with a menu and took our drink order. Annoying, but not too upsetting. I work in the customer service industry and have in the past worked in the restaurant business, so my patience and tolerance level for busy times is higher than normal. After we placed our drink order, which was simply a draught beer and two waters, it took another 10-15 minutes to receive those items.\\n\\nWe placed our order, were informed that they were out of 3 of the 5 things we ordered, and played the waiting game yet again. This time, an hour passed before I decided I had enough. Neither of the two waitresses seemed to have any concern for the long wait that everybody in the restaurant was having, and on top of that, the food was coming out of the kitchen at a snail's pace.  So, taking matters into my own hands, I asked to speak to the manager for an explanation and perhaps an apology for my already 1.5 hour wait for a plate of BBQ.  When he emerged from the kitchen, I explained to him that my roommate and I had been waiting for well over an hour for our dinner. Very gruffly and defensively, he replied that the kitchen was slammed and that there was a full dining room to attend to. Following up with a very hostile, \\" I don't know what you expect me to do about it.\\"   I simply asked him again for an explanation for the wait and the lack of service to which he repeated his answer with a more stern and defensive tone. Never did he offer an apology or any sort of compensation for my almost 2 hour wait for food.  I stated very simply that we would not be paying for the drinks that we ordered and that we would be leaving his establishment immediately.  I have never been spoken to so rudely before by a manager in my life.\\n\\nOH. And just to add insult to injury, the Mac and Cheese that I was told was \\"out\\" was coming out on plates as I sat there waiting for my food.\\n\\nOn the way out, my roommate decided to talk to the manager again to express his unhappiness with how I was treated by the manager. Come to find out, the manager was actually the owner. And, this supposed owner ended up yelling at us and still not providing any sort of explanation as to why our food was never received. On top if that, he lied to my roommate's face by saying he did apologize to me. Bold faced lie. Then, he looked at me and said, \\"I am sorry you didn't hear your apology earlier.\\" Basically, he blamed me for \\"not hearing my apology.\\"\\n\\nI would have been satisfied with a \\"Thank you for your patience. Your food will be out as soon as we can get it out\\" answer. But what I received from the owner of Burnt Fork was a rude, inexcusable response. For a restaurant with about 20 tables and an establishment that serves BBQ, no meal should ever take almost 2 hours to be brought to the table. I am absolutely appalled with this restaurant, and I encourage you all to drive a couple of minutes down the street to Community BBQ. It's quick, the service is great, and the BBQ is heaps better. Eat locally but not here. I simply can't believe that an owner of a restaurant would be satisfied with the way that the place was being run tonight. And, I simply can't believe he would get in a screaming match with a customer. This place has lost my business and my respect.

My husband, by contrast had the veggie ruben, a normally sized meal with sufficient protein and good flavor. The server made an issue of offering fries to supplement my so-called 'entree' I guess because he realized it was meager ( and another server later insisted they didn't come with the entree). The first server won, and it was nice of him but the meal still lacked protein.  If the owners/staff are truly serious about creating a high-quality, varied, nutrient-rich vegetarian experience, I suggest that the chef design better, more substantial and interesting vegan/veggie entrees, hot more than cold please, rather than rely so heavily on bread and tempeh or seitan, sandwiches, for protein."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"There is almost always a line here, but it is definitely somewhere that everyone should try.

You get a lot of meat and the pasta is homemade and anyone using salt on this would be insane.  But for $11 (lunch price) I want lasagne that I'm going to remember.  Also, this is College Park.  I can find half a dozen other entrees for less in that area and I'm pretty sure they'd stand out more.  One last thing - I don't know what they were doing in that kitchen but for about 10 minutes straight all I could hear was a loud banging.

It's pretty much cucumbers cut into pieces covered with sesame oil and maybe soy sauce.\\n\\nTan Tan - whoa. Broth has a very deep taste which I really enjoyed. However, I think you might get sick of the taste by the end of your bowl. Broth is definitely delicious, but it doesn't have any other special kick to it. If you go with the Tan Tan, I highly recommend adding spicy garlic oil to give that extra kick.\\n\\nSpecial - I forget the name of the Ramen but its one of their special ramen options.

You can put your name in to wait for a table and they will text or call you when your table is almost ready. In fact, they encourage you to get a drink or wander the city and they will contact you when it's time to head back for your table. Awesome awesome awesome service from the hostess staff.\\n\\n- Ask for the little room upstairs! It has a romantic, intimate vibe that is slightly less noisy than the main dining room downstairs but still has live music. On this night it was a solo guitarist (upbeat vibe though that made me want to dance). Perfect amount of live music with room for conversation.\\n\\n- $20/bottle wine cork fee. Not bad and they didn't care that we had brought our own special bottle from home.\\n\\n- Menu is one side of tapas style small/medium/large portion sizes and the other side is entrees. We decided on \\"tapas roulette\\" as I called it. Each person at our table took turns pointing out 2 small tapas to our server. As soon as their selections arrived, the next person would point out their 2. It kept the food flowing in small portions, was a lot of fun because we were continually surprised, but we did not overeat and were able to sample small bites of many incredible dishes. \\n\\n- All the dishes were cooked to perfection and the flavors were mouth watering, different, and succulent with each new dish. A few tapas items that changed our lives:\\n\\n        - CONCHAS A LA PARRILLA: grilled diver scallops with a tamari-brown sugar butter sauce and crispy onions\\n\\n         - CONCHAS A LA PARMESANA: bay scallops baked with Grana Padano cheese and lime butter\\n\\n         - CHICHARRONES DE LANGOSTINOS: crispy golden prawns studded with quinoa, served with salsa agridulce\\n\\n         - ANTICUCHO DE PULPO (octopus?! you might say?

Even my sister, who has been a vegetarian for 10 years, had a bite of the lamb. She said that because everything else had been a 10 star in her book, she had to try this too.\\n\\n- Service was excellent.

The chicken ($21) was actually no tastier than a $5.99 Kroger rotisserie special.

I'm no fan of Donald Trump, but the best way to make America great again is to ensure that there's an establishment like Bouldin Creek in every town across the country. Every trip here is glorious: the relaxed atmosphere, the friendly staff, and most importantly the incredible food. If you asked me to name my top five spots to eat in Austin, this is a shoo-in.\\n\\nI'm a dirty carnivore, but the absence of meat here is no obstacle to my thorough enjoyment of every meal. Austin is super friendly to vegetarian & vegan cuisine, so those of you falling into this camp have many options; but Bouldin Creek represents the city's vegetarian fare at its best. Hell, I'd become a vegetarian if I planned to eat every meal here for the rest of my life. Take heed, fellow carnivores: you won't even notice the meat is missing, everything on the menu is otherworldly here. Quality, freshness, taste, and a local, sustainable, healthier approach to food - they do it all here. You'll feel better about yourself and still walk out of the cafe saying, \\"Holy crap, that was delicious!\\"\\n\\nSo what's good here? I haven't gone wrong. Breakfast is king at Bouldin, and it's served all day. (They're open till midnight, making them an excellent destination for those who stayed up late but forgot to eat dinner.) They serve the best omelets in town, maybe anywhere - is that too strong an endorsement? Try the house omelet first, loaded with spinach (which gives it a green appearance), mushrooms, gooey melted cheddar, and garlic for a flavor that grabs you and doesn't let go. It's my favorite. Or try the potato leek omelet with gruyere, which was once served to me by Bob Loblaw, or his impostor anyway. This is why ordering breakfast for dinner is just fine here; I highly encourage it. I've also tried their zucchini migas, which were awesome. The zucchini, perfectly cooked eggs, and heavenly taste of oregano make it a refreshing take on a dish that can get old in Texas. After a long, harrowing flight back to ATX, it was just what I needed. And tonight, I tried the most pleasantly surprising thing so far: their humongous chik'n salad sandwich, made with chickpeas instead of chicken. It came with a heaping portion of chips and their kick-butt salsa. The chik'n salad looked like the real deal, and the taste put the real deal to shame. The bread - locally supplied - was a-mazing. Real chicken salad, I have no more use for you. This sandwich should be eaten on a throne. \\n\\nThe sides here are equally outstanding, from the grilled blueberry cornbread (rich and buttery) to the potato hash cake (peppery, crispy, just right). Everything is wholesome and so satisfying. I have many more things to try on the menu, and there will be many more visits. \\n\\nNo review should leave out how cool this place is. It's essentially a high-end restaurant disguised as an ultra-hip coffeehouse that may possibly have been a mechanics' garage in a past life. The prices are very reasonable, especially considering how high-quality the food is. Bouldin's got the most chill vibes imaginable, though an imposing portrait of Walter White in chef's garb commands you wait to be seated. And it does get absolutely packed, especially at midday and on the weekends; so be prepared to wait up to an hour. (Unless you're crunched for time, it's worth it.) Or go at night like I do now, when there is no wait. The popularity of this place is the biggest indicator that it is in the elite of Austin eateries. So if you haven't been here yet, and you give a crap about good food, you need to get here pronto. You'll pat yourself on the back later."},{"name":"McMenamins Kennedy School","address":"5736 NE 33rd Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Been here many times.

The lunch menu features items like the Tuna Burger, Cuban Panini and a Saut√©ed Steak & Cheese.  Dinner menu includes Atlantic Salmon, a Vegetable Risotto and the ever present Chicken Parmigiana.  They also serve some creative salads, burgers and pizzas.  They also serve breakfast before 11:00am, although I can't claim to have tried it.\\n\\nThey also have a great wine selection, compliments (I believe) of Second Glass.\\n\\nPrices are very fair, which lunch items all in the $7-$8 range and dinners $15-$18.\\n\\nI am consistently impressed with the food.

From a bottle of wine to what each cheese was like to their appetizers to how much food would be enough for the two of us... she was excellent!\\n\\nI highly recommend their meat and cheese platter.

So when I came to Home Slice for the first time over the weekend, I ordered just a slice of cheese and a Coke.  The pizza crust is very thin and crispy but not hard enough to cut up the roof of my mouth (as most crunchy breads do).  The crust, IMO, is superior to Pink's pizza crust in houston, but I'm inclined to say Pink's has superior cheese and sauce.  Regardless, Home Slice still makes a very good slice of NY-style pizza.  I would definitely come back to try other toppings.  We came on Saturday at 11:30 AM during ACL weekend, and there was no wait.  Wahoo!  Waitress was friendly and attentive.

Now I wanted to try this place because they were on Food & Wine's list for best pizza in the US. I think my issue with their pizza is the lack of cheese. I am a huge cheese lover and enjoy my pizza covered in cheese. The pizzas here maybe a one lump of cheese per slice. Not saying the pizza wasn't well made... but i REALLY missed the cheese. Sad to say bc i think everything else exceeded my expectations... even the dessert. We got the salted caramel panna cotta. It was so good we wanted to lick the rest out of the mason jar. The ambience is great too in the restaurant. Very small and cozy. Great place to go for a date.

I hope the dollar tip and convenience of not having to exchange a  few dimes for quarters was worth losing $300 or so a month in sales and $60 plus a month in tips. It is too bad because there are some good bartenders and waitresses in there but those two I encountered are working 2-3 of the weekdays when I would want to grab a couple of beers.

I was drawn to the picture of their giant Triple Triple (9 burger patties, 9 slices of cheese) so my family and I decided to give it a try. I had their Cheeeesy Burger combo, my wife and daughter both had their basic cheeseburgers, and we shared an order of Beer Battered Onion Rings. These burgers and fries put other similar cooked to order burger joints to shame...my burger had a buttery grilled bun that mixed nicely with the cheese and beef, it was one of the tastiest I've ever had. The fries were fantastic, as were the rings. My wife and daughter both loved their burgers. After we were done we decided to give the shakes a try...we were NOT disappointed! My wife and I shared a pumpkin pie and our daughter had a chocolate banana. We needed to be rolled out of the food court afterwards. We will definitely be back to try more of their menu, since everything is cooked to order, the wait for the food was a bit long but worth it!!"},{"name":"Cadillac Cafe","address":"1801 NE Broadway St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"DANCE 10, LOOKS 3!\\n\\nFood is delicious.

Potatoes with bacon, green onion, mushrooms, covered with cheese. There was crusty cheese on the edge of the plate, which I love. I ordered eggs over medium, which almost no restaurant gets right. Not only were they cooked right, they were sitting on top of the mound of potato goodness and the yolk drizzled perfectly when I broke it. Note: the portion was HUGE. I ate until I was full and put the rest in a to go box. It filled the whole box. \\n\\nMy sister got the special - Peach Melba Breakfast (french toast). The custard french toast was delicious (on the regular menu). Peach Melba was good too, but peaches aren't really in season right now. It came with a side of eggs scrambled with ham and green onion. She doesn't really like eggs and ate it all. \\n\\nThe decor is so strange. It looks straight out of 1988, but it had clearly been updated. I'm not explaining this very well, but it's weird.

Talk City bikes.\\n\\nGot hungry. \\n\\nI wanted to see if there was a good burrito nearby (the quest for a \\"as good as the bay area\\" burrito continues...), they recommended Robo Taco on Morrison, gave me some quick directions, and I noodled my bike that direction. \\n\\nAt the corner of my eye,  I see \\"Taqueria\\" in what appeared to be a strip mall. Was this the place? Nope. \\n\\nBut I was intrigued. There was Mexican TV, chips under a warm light, tons of signs around me that said: \\"Try this.. \\"\\n\\nI went for my staple. Plain veggie burrito. Refried beans, lettuce, tomato, salsa. \\n\\nThe nice lady hands me over CHIPS. Ahh Jeah...that's the way I remember it.  A salsa, it has cilantro swimming in it, this is looking good!\\n\\nThe chips were warm, not the best I have had, but heck. they were free, and good enough. The Salsa? VERY good. \\n\\nThe burrito. Good size. The ingredients is spread evenly. The lettuce is fresh. The lightly spread sour cream, a nice light avocado sauce, good flavor and texture of the rice.. Yeah, this is CA average. That is a great bar to reach! \\n\\nGood burrito, excellent salsa, good chips included and under $5. I felt like I was visiting  my home town of San Jose. This place reminds me of San Jose's \\"Burrito Factory\\", but $1 more.  Will come back! \\n\\nOh, yeah, I wanted to see where this Robo Taco place was so I biked a little further. My belly was reasonably full, but I wanted to know what made people think it stood out (just had a good experience, needed to try the same thing.. just so I knew, this is important stuff!). \\n\\nI duplicated my order. A rice and bean with added pico was as close as I could reach. \\n\\nIt was a $1 more than Taqueria Portland. It did not include chips. The salsas were only that runnier stuff in bottles you squeeze. I did find the cucumber salsa interesting, it tastes okay. The burrito was still better than almost all the places I have tried in PDX, with exception of the truck on Division and 50th, so it was totally worth it, but I do have to admit... liked Taqueria Portland better.\\n\\nIf you \\"want\\" soy curls or a vegan version of pork, it is $2 more at Roco Taco..

The ambiance is great, very rustic Italian caf√© style, and they highly emphasize the \\"brick oven brought over straight from Italy\\", which, being from Seattle where there are a ton of amazing hole-in-the-wall brick oven shops that are awesome, was not a novelty, but they did do a great job with the set up.  The place is small and other patrons who spoke of making reservations or having to wait forever were not mistaken.  We happened in without one and were lucky enough to grab a seat in-between reservations (however we were warned we only had 45 minutes till we had to leave).  About 10 minutes after we sat down, there were people lined up who stayed, wallflower style for the whole duration of our meal.  My friend ordered the beet salad which was pretty good.  We got a bottle of wine, which was reasonably priced, they do have an a-ok wine list, although a limited wine by the glass menu.  The food took FOREVER, and unfortunately they ripped my pizza, so they had to re-make it, so it took about an hour for me to get my artesian fennel sausage and red-pepper pizza (from a brick oven that takes approximately 90 seconds to cook a pizza fully) so by the time my food got there everyone else was finished, which was extremely lame.  There is no other way to describe the pizza besides over sauced, undercheesed, and totally lacking in flavor, it was very bland and weirdly garlicky with no balancing herbs or spices.  My friend's pizza was very under sauced, but equally bland.  We did get my pizza for 50% off (which was still overpaying in my opinion) but I would not go back here, there are way too many other places with a much fuller flavor palate than backspace.

They have an expansive collection of modern art in all the public spaces.\\nThe bar is spacious with a open floor plan, and two flat screen TV's for the sports fans.   It is rather noisy due to all the hard surfaces.\\nThe hosteses were attentive and seated us promptly, they offered us a choice of tables which was nice.\\nOur waiter was Jose, and this is where the restaurant starts to go downhill.  He was slightly fawning and unctious, and he went blasting through the specials as quickly as possible.  We felt rushed when ordering, and he pressured us to make a decision without taking time to advise us and let us make a considered decision. At least he didn't refer to our party as \\"You guys\\" which so many servers do nowadays, so he gets thumbs up for that.\\nThe restaurant has a identity problem in that they are trying to be very high end, fine dining, yet casual, however, fine dining to us means a tablecloth.  Instead we had our silverware wrapped in a napkin and we had to put our silverware out on the bare table.  That isn't what we consider fine dining.  \\n\\nOur drinks arrived a bit slowly but it was acceptable as we were not in a big hurry.  The bread was adequate some light and some dark, but there was not enough dark bread for everyone in our party, and our party was mixed in reaction to the house special \\"bacon butter\\" that came with the bread, some liked it, some didn't.   Later in the meal one of our party wanted some more of the brown bread, we asked for some more bread, and after a long delay they brought out some bread which was totally different from the first batch, some sort of Italian bread.  Very disappointing as the reason we asked for more bread in the first place is that one of our party hadn't gotten to try the brown bread the first go round and the second go round she was denied again.\\nThey also forgot to bring more butter with the second batch of bread.\\n\\nEntrees were very good and speed and temperature were fine.  However we felt the pricing was too expensive.  There wasn't a good range of pricing, so if you wanted to order an inexpensive entree, you were out of luck. We didn't order appetizers but the one odd thing is that the only sort of salad was kale salad, and the only side vegetable appeared to be broccollini.  Seems like a fine dining restaurant would want to offer more options.\\n\\nThe server removed my plate before the rest of the people at the table had finished eating.  Although this is very commonplace it is not correct as it makes the remaining diners feel rushed.  Hopefully restaurants can retrain their servers to remove all empty plates at the same time.\\n\\nFor desert I had the MacAllen Butterscotch Pudding, with a chunk of sea salt toffee, which was very good.  The only odd thing is that the pudding cup was served without a saucer underneath it, so you didn't have any place to put your spoon down in between bites.   And the mint spring garnish also had to be held in your hand until finishing the rest of the pudding.  Very strange.   The toffee was outstanding, even better than the pudding.\\n\\nWe also had an error on our bill, although warned to inspect the bill by the waiter, that still doesn't absolve him of his responsibility to not mix up the wine when he was informed beforehand that we would be doing separate checks.  Not a big deal, and we want this restaurant to succeed and thrive, but it just goes to show that the Hamilton Kitchen still has a way to go to iron out all the small details that change an adequate dining experience into an unforgettable dining experience.\\n\\nThree of five stars, they lose one for minor service flaws and one for being overpriced."},{"name":"NaraDeva Thai Restaurant","address":"4696 Millenia Plz Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We decided to try to have dinner here without any luck!!

If this is the case, then Victoria Seafood Restaurant gets five stars because it is always full of Asian diners and the occasional spattering of non-Asians dining with their Asian friends. This is a good omen when taking into account that they are located outside of Chinatown.\\n\\nOne of our usual haunts, we come here specifically for the heaping mounds of salty and spicy squid (YUM!) and watercress with garlic. Their salty and spicy squid is among the best I've had (even better than East Ocean City in Chinatown). Freshly fried hot tender squid is served on a bed of crispy iceberg lettuce and a generous sprinkling of sea salt, chopped green onions and spicy peppers. I normally despise iceberg lettuce, but the somehow the bland crunchy lettuce compliments the dish to offset the salty and spiciness of the dish. Typical of many Chinese restaurants, their portions are made for family style eating. \\n\\nThe menu offers much of the typical recognizable Chinese fare, including rice plates (for individual servings), chow foon, and others. In the tradition of many Chinatown restaurants specializing in seafood, there are a few (sad-looking) tanks with some of their fresh fare.\\n\\nThe decor is meh and the service is efficient (some may consider it unfriendly). But who cares? People come here for the food. Also, large portions and low prices give you lots of bang for the buck.\\n\\nUpdate: This is the type of place in which you need to order the right dish. I considered dropping their rating, but my SO and I always order our standard fare with some variations and their salty spicy squid is still the best. I would recommend sticking with the seafood dishes."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Was so excited after all we have heard about Voodoo and couldn't wait to binge on doughnuts during our trip to OR.

I really expected to be back in line for a dozen more, fidgeting in a sugar induced craze, but instead I sat outside at those intensely purple picnic tables sad and well, disappointed.  Overall, the doughnuts alone would be 3 stars. The texture wasn't soft and fresh, but borderline stale and it was only about 3pm.  Poor customer service really underscored my dislike for this location and disappointment in Voodoo. Sad to see that other Yelpers have had the pleasure of experiencing this kind of treatment too.

This appears to be a tourist trap that is fun, quirky, and in a convenient location. The homeless appear to know this and were practically camped outside of the place, bluntly asking for a donut or a $5. \\nWe waited about 30-45 minutes to get inside the place. \\nThe interior is equally fun, making the wait worth it as you have to read all the interesting descriptions for their donuts. If you like the famous: maple bacon or The Homer Simpson. The stranger ones that looked like they had fruit loops attached to the top of them. I'm a fan of classic chocolate glazed and really did enjoy it. Our overall impression of the actual taste of the donuts was mediocre/good. I don't even remember how they tasted, but this place was memorable because of the niche they built in Chinatown, Portland. \\nMy advice: if you're up for touristy, go for it. The donuts are all right and its a fun location. Skip Blue Star. If you're a serious fan of donuts go to Annie's Donuts.

They have so many funky donut flavours that I never imagined would go together, yet they make it look it look so good! Good thing there was a line as I needed that time to look through their menu and decide on what I wanted. The rotating donut display in the store really helped with picking the flavours. If you're one who does not like fillings in their donut (eg cream) then make sure to go on their website to look through the donut descriptions carefully, as some have fillings in the centre. I decided to be conservative and opted for the powdered sugar donut. It was delicious - the outside was crisp which blended well with the sweet flavour of powdered sugar. They have a limited selection of beverages, however (e.g. StumpTown coffee roaster coffee, hot chocolate and soda). If you're hoping for a place to sit, they have benches and tables outside the store. Another thing to remember about this place is that they are cash only. I am already looking forward to my next donut trip here, hopefully then, I will be more adventurous and trial more exciting flavours!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Definitely worth the wait!

Never heard of this place but after a friendly get together, we decided to swing by here on the way back to Dallas. One of my friends works down the street from here and said it was good so decided to give it a try.\\n\\nOverwhelmed is the first word that came to mind when I bit into my quarter chicken. The meat is extremely tender, succulent, moist, juicy; it's been a long time since I've had proper chicken. The spices work great with the meat and provide flavor bombs with each bite. To further accentuate the taste are two sauces: a green spicy sauce that hits you up front but really takes the chicken to another level and a milder, sweeter sauce for those who like it that way. Either way you can't go wrong. You can grab some corn tortillas if you like to wrap the chicken and while they're warm and help make eating it easier, I think you can do without it.\\n\\nAs for the sides, they let you sample everything before you pick so you know what you're getting ahead of time. If you could only pick one though, I recommend the yucca fries: starchier than its potato steak fry cousin, but it absorbs the ketchup well, is ultra crisp while puffy and tender within and is the perfect mobile to try some of that green sauce. A close second is the fried plantains, which are not as sweet as I'm used too, but well caramelized. Mashed potatoes and mac and cheese are good too, but it's the yucca fries and plantains that steal this show.\\n\\nYou also get a free ice cream cone if you check in on yelp. \\n\\nThis place also had some of the best service I've been to in a long time too. The guys at the counter are quick in carving up chicken, offering suggestions, being friendly in general. Heck, if you get the ice cream cone, they hand deliver it to the table. The owner/manager also comes by and checks up on each patron individually to see how their meal is. I sometimes don't even get that attention when I'm at a $$$ place.\\n\\nIt feels strange to find this as almost fast foodish feel when the food is clearly clearly much better than that.

It's a mix between a French inspired, cozy cafe and a house you'd think was really cute if you were walking by. It has an outdoor patio for those omg-today-is-beautiful-I-just-have-eat-outside-type of moods and is just what you are looking for if you feel bored of hamburgers and the typical breakfast joints like Kerbey Lane or Magnolia. Also, the neighborhood is really unique and there's other random mom-and-pop type stores around that might capture your interest during a casual stroll.\\n\\nIdeal social group: Perfect for a couple's day date, lunch with your mom, meet up with the girl friends, catching up with old friend over coffee, sitting outside and enjoying good food with your dog.\\n\\nFood: I ordered the Smoked salmon and cream cheese tartine, which is basically triangular flat  bread with smoked salmon on top. It was pretty darn awesome in terms of smoked salmon. What pleasantly surprised me, though, was the awesome slab of stone it was served on! \\n\\nMy bf ordered Hummus, Taboule, Mesclun Greens, Olive Platter and I'd say this wasn't as good as my dish. It seemed to be a deconstructed version of hummus and  didn't leave you with that satisfied feeling of completeness that comes from a good meal, so complained my bf. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the sausage and cheese Frittata and apparently this menu option changes daily. A frittata is essentially what would happen if an omelette and quiche had baby. I sampled this and it didn't taste much better than Denny's in my opinion.\\n\\n+ sides: $2 Mimosas! (decent amount of champagne) And breakfast is served all day for all those breakfast lovers out there! \\n\\nService: It wasn't as busy as you'd expect during Saturday brunch time. We were seated promptly, but had to battle out thumb wars style for outdoor seating since it was such a pretty day. \\n\\nAll in all, I'm really giving it 4 stars for the ambiance and character of the place. The food is mildly cheap for such a seemingly fancy menu and the plating of their food is beautiful. You can probably eat similar food at La Madeline, but you'd be missing out on the cool, artsy, southern neighborhood feel the 11th st. restaurant provides.

The stove area is also not divided or partitioned for WHAT is being cooked.\\n\\nThe payment process was pretty fast. Drinks were delivered to our table after we were seated.

I choose the restaurant because it got no reviews on almost every food review website. It had a very romantic but relaxed ambiance and I knew that I wanted a very special restaurant because if things went as planned, I would be celebrating my first meal as an engaged couple with my soon-to-be fiancee. \\n\\n We started off with two appetizers and from the moment it arrived onto the table I knew that we were in for one hell of a meal! We ordered the Sausage, Egg and Cheese Biscuit and the Cheese N' Eggs w/ Raisin Toast and Apple Butter. First, I have never seen such a huge Sausage, Egg and Cheese Biscuit before in my life. This thing had to be at least and 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick. And not because of the biscuit either. It was completely filled with sausage. Plus, the sausage was piled on top of a scrambled egg and American cheese. When I got all of the components into one bite it completely blew me away. All the flavors blended and complimented each other perfectly. This was one of the best appetizers that I have ever eaten, EVER! The Cheese n' Eggs were simply amazing as well. They give you two large flavor packed Eggs that by themselves were fried to perfection; very slightly crispy on the outside but runny in the middle. Then you add the cheese....OMG!! The American Cheese added a slightly different shade of yellow to the eggs that kept the plate's color theme consistent.\\n\\nNow for the main attraction, the entr√©e!!! First of all, this was an incredibly difficult decision to make because everything on the menu sounded fantastic!! But I decided to go with something that I thought I could not get anywhere else, something unique to Waffle House.  \\nI decided to go with the waffle. Topped with butter and syrup. What I was the most amazed with was the syrup and how it brought the entire meal together. The waffle was incredibly tender and the butter was an interesting but great compliment. So when you get the waffle, butter and syrup together with, I should add, Hashbrowns smothered, covered, diced and capped, not only is it visually appealing but it has an outstanding sweet and tangy flavor that you will only find at Waffle House. This was the unique meal that I was looking for.\\n\\nAlthough we were completely stuffed at this point during the meal, we felt inclined to splurge a little and get a dessert. I mean hopefully your engagement night is a once in a lifetime event, so why not! So the waiter recommended the Sarah Lee Aunt Maggie's Southern Pecan Pie. I have had some great Sarah Lee pies and this one definitely ranks close to the top. The pie is perfectly soft and mushy. Not that gross mushy but instead that classy mushy that good pie often is. You definitely taste the pecans, which give it a sweet and tangy flavor. Then when paired with the refrigerated pie stuff you get the sweet warm and cold sensation in your mouth that come to make the perfect storm of delicious goodness.\\n\\nSo to conclude, I must say thank you. Thank you Waffle House and their gracious, awesome staff for making my engagement night absolutely perfect! Although we were the last to be seated for the night and me changing our reservation 3 times, your service, ambiance, and food were second to none. I have no regrets about choosing Waffle House as my first meal with my now fiancee and the fact that the night was perfect for her, means everything to me.

It was delicious, the broth was thick and flavorful, and the ramen was cooked wonderfully. It also came with a soft boiled egg which was also cooked perfectly. Only complaint was that my wife was missing her half boiled egg in her ramen. She kept digging through the thick broth but could not find it.\\n\\nThe server was attentive and friendly, and our food came out in a very timely manner. The restaurant itself is quite small, basically a bar, a row of about 6 tables and an outdoor patio. A nice selection of craft beers is also available. They don't accept reservations, and when we got their on a friday night at 8 pm there was a 45 min wait, we went to a pub around the corner to get our drank on while we waited."},{"name":"Pizzeria Locale","address":"1730 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I love their focaccia and their plate of prosciutti miste.

Large pieces of sweet lobster meat are cradled in a crusty, yet soft hoagie roll - the perfect backdrop for the lobster. The clam chowder was creamy and rich, with it's own sourdough bowl. Unless you are extremely hungry, I'd recommend getting the chowder on it's own. I ended up just wasting the lovely bread bowl because I chose to fill up on lovely clams. Oh, the clams .... sigh ....  were amazingly sweet and briny ... wonderfully delish. I'd fly back to Boston any day for a taste of those cherrystone clams.

The first morning I went there after a night out and needed some enchiladas ...badly. I ordered their beef enchiladas but was surprised by the pre-cooked beef cut into fajita taco style cubes and barely meshed in with the oven 'cooked' cheses and corn tortilla surrounding it in an enchilada shape. Then the sauce was roja and I wasnt expecting that, although it does say that on the menu, I just didnt catch that detail. The rice is very large grain and crumbly, I think it was overcooked. I dont normally add salt to prepared food but the rice and black beans were fairly tasteless. I got an order of the chicken enchilada soup to-go, for later. It had 2 slices of avacado in it and it was VERY salty which I wasnt expecting. But the soup was good. I think I was dehydrated from the night out.\\nLater On my second visit, I went back for the chili-lime chicken salad because of a great picture I saw of the salad. It was good, very fresh, chicken was well seasoned. The chili-lime dressing could have used more LIME taste (it tasted like watery ranch dressing) but on super fresh veggies, it passed.\\nThe salsa bar has 8 choices. Some are very chunky.

There's a nice combination of sweet and savory options to choose from, a must-have at a good brunch place.  \\n\\nThe prices were perfectly reasonable, and the serving sizes were just right.

The views were decent but not as spectacular as I was lead to believe I took my dad here for dinner because his favorite place in Vegas is the stratosphere. First our waiter was nonexistent I ordered a martini that took 30 minutes and 3 excuses from the waiter who was nice but after over hearing my dad and I discussing expensive restaurants we'd been to in other places and how the prices here weren't bad he mentioned prices on everything and seemed slightly condescending thinking we had no money for a place like this meanwhile my dad was seriously debating on whether or not to get a $1600 bottle of wine which he decided against after the wait on my drink and the condescension.  We also ordered the lobster cake appetizer which he got 2 pieces of shell in and which took another 20 minutes after I got my martini, to come out when we ordered both at the same time (50 minutes in now). 30 minutes after finishing the appetizer our food finally came out. I had the lamb shank and opted for gnocchi instead of mashed potatoes after the waiter inquired whether a couple dollar price difference was an issue or not but the food was delicious and the lamb just fell off the bone. My dad ordered the pork chop which had good flavor but was on the verge of being dry and his potatoes were cold. We wanted to end with coffee for him and a cappuccino for myself, which was the most timely of services we received but not the best in flavor. We walked out full but not impressed and left $15 on a $120 bill 2 hours after sitting down.

I really liked the croissant, as the texture and taste was just great. The tea was a great complement and tasted much better than your average tea bag as it was steeped.

I hope they come out with coupons via their daily email because I don't plan on going back anytime soon after this.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\n\\nI have gone here a few more times since, the service has been good, the food is solid, sandwichs suck, but the salads are really good.

Aside from the spot on service and the shiny pink Cadillac on display, this is not the same restaurant I knew and loved for years. They say if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  I understand when new owners take over, things are bound to change, but I was really hoping that wouldn't be the case with this restaurant. I have gone three times since the changing of hands, and all three visits were disappointing. I always ordered the Albert's Eggless. This dish is now called a hash and is no longer eggless. I know I could order it without but I wanted to give the revised dish a chance. It also comes with sausage, bacon and ham instead of choosing one.  None of the meat on any of my three recent visits was done right. It's like when you go to Wendy's and get the chili, you know it's leftover hamburgers. That's what the meat seems like now, and though I know it's not true, it's just not cooked with the same care as before. It is also hard to find the ham. The third issue is the lack of other veggies. Before, it was loaded with veggies and cheese; now you may find a few mushrooms and tiny tomato pieces with a cheese sprinkle and that's it. I do like the coulis, which is new, but it becomes  the dominant feature of the dish. The only piece that is the same are the potatoes.  Another thing that bugs me is having to get ketchup in a ramekin. Can I just have the bottle of Portland ketchup please? The prices have also increased, but I think this is because they received a lot of backlash for adding an additional employee health care charge to the bill, and have now incorporated that into the prices. I know it's not fair to judge a restaurant on one dish, but that was my tradition, and now it's gone. The pancakes look great, and I like how they have made the menu easier to order for kids (simpler breakfast dishes), and the service is ALWAYS impeccable. If you are an out of towner or new to Portland, you will most likely be very satisfied with Cadillac. I encourage you to try it and tell me what you think. I, however, will be moving on."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Home Slice is such a great place to get real NY pizza in Texas!

I've had most selections on the menu at some point, both delivery and in house and I don't have any complaints. The food has been amazing every time and the serving size is quite a lot - you will have lunch for the next day. Some of my favorites: 1. The salads don't mess around, they are quite impressive. My gf got them every time and she always had lunch for the next two days. 2. Buffalo chicken quesadilla. Amazing. 3. Chicken alfredo (or any of the pasta dishes). Amazing. I will actually be getting that tomorrow when I go back. The mac and cheese bites (if they still have them) are very good. The BLT a friend of mine got, huge sandwich, real good bacon. Very much worth it. Pizza's are good too, I usually get Domino's but that's just me. Those just off the top of my head. \\n\\nI've never had a problem with service or delivery, but I love eating there.\\n\\nAnd I honestly have no idea what anyone else has to complain about. If your wrap falls apart or you don't like what the pizza/cheese fries look like (based on recent reviews that I see), just ask the owner to fix it.

We told her it was our first time coming to their restaurant and she said she could bring rice and some sort of crepe-ish thing which comes with the meal--I think the crepes are an alternative to noodles--but by the time we were back at the table we had already picked noodles so the crepes were mostly useless to us. \\n\\nOne thing I liked about this place vs Yummy's was the decor and layout.

I stayed here last summer while traveling with my parents, and my mom and I were all set for a movie night when...\\n\\"Wait, is she 21?\\" we get stopped by the bartender just was we were about to enter.\\n\\"Not yet,\\" said my mom, a little wary.\\n\\"Sorry, she can't go in.\\"\\n\\"Why not?\\"\\n\\"Oregon state law.\\" (apparently Oregonian alcohol has signed a restraining order against me).\\nMy mom and I just stood there, not sure of what to do.  I was dumbfounded.\\n\\"But...I'm with her...I'm her mom...I won't let her drink...I'm not even drinking...\\"\\n\\"Sorry, ma'am.  All we can do is refund you your money.\\"\\nI was not happy.  We said our goodbyes and I stomped out of there.  The staff didn't even seem remotely sympathetic.\\nWhile we waited for my mom to come out of the theater, my dad and I hit the soaking pool.  Good enough, except that it was, as most Portland nights are, chilly, and the top half of me was freezing and the bottom pleasantly warm.  I couldn't remedy that, because it's all of about four feet deep and four feet across, and the only thing there's space enough to do is sit and wait for your fingers to wrinkle up.  It was also one very awkward experience, as I felt like we had waded into a singles gathering.  The pool was populated with lovely young couples, one set getting to second base in the far-off corner.  Thank God I took my glasses off before I got in the water so I didn't have to see it in hi-def.  It didn't take long before my dad and I concluded that this was way too weird.  The restaurant was closed, and we had already eaten anyway, so we headed back to the room.\\nThank god I had my laptop with me, because the rooms were all TV-less.  Though I do admire the effort, I would have appreciated their boob-tube ban much more had I had something to do in that place other than watch TV.  But since there was no TV, I ended up on Myspace all night.  Even worse, there was no place to plug in my cable, and the only place I could get a wireless signal was in a very dark corner in the entry hall.  Eventually, after some acrobatics, I found I could stretch the signal far enough to the very tip of the rollaway cot they had brought in for me. \\nMy mom came back shortly after, unimpressed by the movie (American Dreamz), and too pissed at the staff to concentrate, anyway.  We sat in silence for a few hours, my parents perusing travel books, and me clicking away on that uncomfortable metal corner of the cot, until it was late enough to go to bed.\\nWhen I say I was on Myspace all night, I do mean all night.  The place creeped me the hell out after all the bar hoppers had left for the night.  But that is not the fault of the establishment, it is just my own personal fear and trauma.  I can't fault them for that.\\nThe only saving grace of this place that I can attest to came the next morning. I took my sleep-deprived self to breakfast (obeying the signs to stay far, far away from the bar) and very quickly ordered a cup of coffee and a tofu scramble.\\nThe coffee was, to this day, the best I've ever had, and the breakfast wasn't so bad, either.  Though this was largely a two-star review, McMenamin's ranks high because of character, charm, and coffee.  I love the place during the day, before it gets creepy, and before everyone throws me out.\\nAnd you can bet I filled out that suggestion card, asking if they're not going to put TVs in the room, to at least open up a teen lounge or something.  It might not be as much fun as drinking in a movie theater, but at least it would be better than dragging a chair all over the room trying to find a wi-fi signal."},{"name":"Lincoln's Landing","address":"156 Humphrey St","city":"Swampscott","stars":"4","text":"Good food, good service.

Even the time my grandpa told a server he didn't care about her damn day, he just wanted his coffee, was somehow more successful than our time at 950.\\n\\n6:24 pm\\nWe arrived at the restaurant and we were seated immediately.   We sat for about 10 minutes and our server came by to drop off menus and see if we wanted anything to drink. We ordered 8 waters, 1 Sprite, 1 old fashioned and 1 lemonade. 10 more minutes went by and she came back with 5 waters and a Sprite and lemonade. 5 more minutes went by she came back with straws and not more waters. I wish I could give a better play by play of how clueless she was from the moment we sat down. \\n\\nAround 6:50 pm we start to order. Two of us place our order and she says \\"hold on your drink is up\\" and walks away from our table to go and get the drink and then stops at another table on her way back to us?? She finishes with the last person in our group and then reads back what everyone ordered ... Not something I'm used to but she's making sure she didn't mess anything up so I went with it.\\n\\nAround 7:15 pm my house salad came out. And thank the lord it did! I'm 19 weeks pregnant and was starving!! It was really good. We all loved the balsamic vinaigrette.\\n\\nAround 7:55 pm one member of our party went up to a manager and explained it was our grandmas birthday and it was now almost 90 minutes since we sat down and it's getting ridiculous ( it was not busy yet in the restaurant and our server only had 3 tables). The manager apologized and offered free drinks and dessert for the table. Only 2 people were drinking so they got another. At this point we'll take any acknowledgement that service has been poor.\\n\\nOur food came out shortly after we complained to the manager about the wait. The server asked if we needed anything else...  and that was the last time we would see her for a very long time.  Waters and sodas were never refilled. The food was good. Not worth the wait by but it filled the hunger so everyone is a little bit happier now.\\n\\nIt's now about 8:25 pm and our plates are finally cleared. We ask about the free dessert and the server says, oh you get one dessert. Hmmm the manager made it seem like we would all get a dessert. She offered us two so we ordered 2 pieces of pie and asked for the bill at 8:37 pm (this is when I started paying close attention to the exact time). \\n\\nIt's now 8:45 pm and grandma and her daughter leave because she is 76 and is falling asleep at the table after an almost 3 hour dinner at this point. (3 hours for just 1 salad, 3 drinks and 8 entrees).  Right after they left, the manager comes by to make sure we're doing ok now. Nope! We're not. We've been waiting for 20 minutes for our bill. He says ok I'll get back there and take care of it for you. For the next 15 minutes we don't see our server or the manager. And this was JUST TO GET OUR BILL!! We didn't even give our card yet.  She comes back with our bill at 9:08 pm.  We can't believe that they kept an 18% gratuity on the bill. This girl deserved no tip. I always give at least 20%.  I was a server for over 10 years of my life and I have never given a $0 tip but this would have been the time to do so, but the lucky lady was saved by the guaranteed party gratuity.  So we give her the payment and after chatting with her friend at the bar for a good 5 minutes she comes back to drop off the cards. It is now 9:16 pm and we finally get up to leave.\\n\\nIt's been 2 days and my blood pressure is rising right now just thinking of the experience. The server was awful; there is no denying that, but the folks most to blame here are the managers. We barely got one apology from the male manager after we complained about the ridiculous wait time for the food and he never helped out his server or any of his servers for that matter. If you see your server in the weeds, run some drinks, run some food! Help them out!! Don't stand at the bar looking like you're too good to help your team out.  Yes we saw you standing there doing nothing most of the evening.  And your female counterpart continually surveying the room but helping NO ONE. This is the most poorly run restaurant I've ever walked into. And we eat out a lot in Chicago. I suggest the owners (TI and whomever else owns this restaurant) clean house and start over.  This is a restaurant with pretty good food, a nice atmosphere and a big name drawing people in, but that isn't going to keep people walking through the door much longer and it definitely won't bring people back.

If you live in Portland but aren't familiar with Peruvian food, this is the place to start because it is owned and run by some really beautiful souls who share a serious passion for Peruvian food and culture. We had the pleasure of meeting one of the owners, Doris, and she is such a lovely woman. She obviously cares very much about not only her clients and the high quality food and drinks they serve, but also for all the people who work there.  There is something quite special about restauranteurs who put their hearts into all aspects of their business. \\n\\nChef Oscar Martin, a Peruvian born chef who came to Portland by way of San Francisco, was a true standout in the restaurant last night. His cebiche mixto was truly on point. For those of you who love cebiche I can promise you he does not disappoint. He brings the freshest ingredients, a delicate balance, and an artful eye for composition to his plates. Also note the fresh oysters if that's your thing - they are worth your attention.  We also split the causa with chicken, diver scallop, and grilled octopus small tapas plates which were outstanding.  Chef Martin also treated us to a small tasting of Kobe beef skirt steak served on a paste of aji panca (specialty Peruvian peppers). The beef was fresh, tender, and cooked and seasoned to perfection.  For our entr√©e we split the rack of lamb, prepared medium rare, with a side of green beans and potatoes. It was some of the best lamb I have had in a long time.  We drank Pisco sours to round out this authentic meal, and they did not disappoint.   Each round was consistently mixed. Kudos and thanks to the bartender(s) for that.  \\n\\nHonestly, Andina is not just the best Peruvian restaurant in Portland (which, by far and away, it is) but it very well might also be one of the best restaurants in Portland full stop. Artful platings, well balanced and thoughtful options, and a robust menu place Andina above. I can't give enough stars.  More importantly I can't wait to go back again."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I tried their oysters from different states and some bass with grapefruit.

Since they are, ya know, the main draw.\\n\\nThe wings are first and foremost full wings. Drumstick and leg all in one. They come 6 to a plate, so you get the same as you would if you ordered a dozen wings elsewhere. The wings are clearly smoked, doused in sauce, grilled real quick, then plated. The smoking is nice, you don't find well smoked wings around here. Usually they are fried and grilled, or just fried. The rub or spicing they use as a base is tasty, and I really enjoyed the wing itself as a piece of flavored food.\\n\\nThere ends the good parts. Now, for me bitching.\\n\\nI ordered the FIre Wings, or whatever nonsense they called it. I specifically remember seeing \\"(crazily hot)\\" on the menu.\\n\\nThey were not. I was very disappointed. I was more disappointed when I asked for more heat, and was handed some habanero tabasco sauce.\\n\\nNow, I'll say that I am a stupid crazy chili head, but I am also able to objectively rate spice levels regardless if they peaked my interest. These wings were not crazily spicy. They were tasty. They were subtle. They were effing delicious.\\n\\nThey were not spicy. \\n\\nSo, long story short, go here for the taste, don't expect anything resembling heat, and enjoy the hell out of it. It's really a great bbq/beer joint."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"4.5 stars but rounding up due to great service.\\nThe food overall was good, the Suspension cake especially was a standout, Red Velvet Cake with a mascarpone cream and strawberry filling.  Do yourself a favor and leave room for dessert.\\n\\nEntree's were also great.  Crispy beef had crispy strips of fried beef in a slightly sweet sauce, veggies and rice.  Seafood melange had large beautifully cooked scallops and prawns with a squid ink pasta.  We also got the fried lobster fried rice which was well seasoned but not sure if it was worth the price.\\n\\nWhere I didn't find as much value for the buck were the small plates.  We got the lobster wontons and lobster Mac and cheese.  They each tasted good I just hardly tasted much lobster, and for the price they charge I guess I was expecting big chunks of lobster meat.  The other small bite we ordered for the table was the deviled eggs.  This was 4 halves of hard boiled egg, deep fried and topped Korean bbq, caviar and sauce.

These were not plated on a bed of ice, though I will say the plate came heavily laden with lemon, horseradish, and cocktail sauce - no crackers.

One was a bacon maple bar for me to try, and the rest (an assortment of their most popular items) were to bring home to my girlfriend in NYC. Voodoo Doughnuts come in a huge pink box which you can't miss because it's large, pink, and has \\"VOODOO DOUGHNUT\\" written all over it.

I mean unimpressive like I ate half of it and ended up tossing away the other half. I've had bacon doughnuts before, and I just didn't think the one from Voodoo Doughnut was good. As for the box I had brought home, the doughnuts in there weren't impressive either.

I liked my sausage medium-rare here, but I do not know if that is kosher (not in a religious sense).\\n\\nAfter a two year break from Frank and its house-made sausages, I felt it appropriate to give Frank a second chance. I enjoy a nice gastropub, an establishment that specializes in craft booze and a good hodgepodge of comfort and bar food. Furthermore, who does not appreciate swine ground up with some assorted ingredients, pushed into a casing, and cooked alongside other assorted gut-filling grub?\\n\\nMy last experience gave me a few bad takeaways: high costs, unsuccessful combinations, and poor preparation. I returned for a sit-down meal, and I had quite an enjoyable experience. Plus, it was cheaper, as I stuck with some real nitty gritty fare.\\n\\nFrank is a true Austin dining establishment. This joint provides you with a communal feel without having too much sloppiness. The dining area is tight, but you still feel like you have enough room to breathe as you indulge in the various preparation of the aforementioned \\"greasy spoon items.\\"\\n\\nThe most unique item we had was the curried sweet potato soup. Though slightly bland and overly curried, it provided a nice rich consistency. The simplest selection was the Currywurst. Slices of Hudson's house in a zippy curry sauce were topped with 4 nice slices of buttery toast.\\n\\nBetween the straightforward pub grub exists some nice choices that range from waffle fries with assorted toppings or unique combinations of sausage and the like. So, we went with poutine. This Canadian staple of waffle fries, rich gravy, and cheese curds sat quite heavy, but it was mighty good. Texturally, the dish was perfect: soggy, gravy-soaked fries on the bottom; crispy, cheesy fries on top! We went with the weekly special Soul Dog. Collard greens, turnip and turnip green sausage, sweet potato fries, black eyed peas, cornbread. This was actually quite disappointing. The fries and peas were bland, the cornbread was dry; the sausage was the saving grace; juicy and not cooked all the way through.\\n\\nMy advice here is to stick to something more diverse than just processed pork-based items. The poutine was good, the soup was acceptable, and the sliced sausage with bread was quite tasty.

Each entre came with two sides and it was a hard choice but I chose the sweet potato souffle and the cheese grits. NAS-TAY!!! The cheese grits was like cheese soup/queso... I needed some tortilla chips to scoop it up with or maybe bread for a cheese fondue? It was really gross. I was imagining something different and more appetizing. The sweet potatoes souffle was a flavorless disappointment as well. The other people in my group were also very disappointed with the sides they ordered, but they were happy with the entre.

GF executes competently the other staples of the artisan burger joint: crisp fries coated in parmesan and truffle oil, soft cookout buns, fresh toppings, and milkshakes. However, the meat itself, rather than being tender, beefy and crumbly, is a dense, solid hockey puck that I could barely choke down.\\n\\nThanks to Kenji Lopez-Alt, I have a pretty good idea of what causes such burger fail: proteins in the beef fusing with one another to create a tight and rubbery structure. This often is caused by working salt through the meat, which encourages the proteins to get too cozy with each other (somewhat counterintuitively, you should only salt burgers on their exterior, and just before cooking).

Considering how chaotic it was, being a very busy Friday night, the service still didn't lack. And I have never, ever had subpar food here.

We arrived at the host booth 5 minutes prior to our reservation time to checked-in with the host.

We completely understood that because there is a dress code; however, he did not inquire as to why we BOTH had our outside wear on. Nor did he offer to move us. Fine. We tried to enjoy the rest of our night but it only went down hill from there. Our food took longer than normal to be served.

We are paying decent money for a meal and it's cold. The food was mediocre at best. And to add insult to injury, the maitre d' returned to our table to ask us what the name of the reservation was... That was my tipping point. Experience is such a major part of our dating life and a major factor for our restaurant choices.

Aren't they more like sugar-laden and diabetes-inducing fried calories, ready to prompt a massive heart attack after ingestion? Perhaps I'm being over-dramatic. I mean, Voodoo's toppings only consist of bacon, various cereals from my childhood, bubble gum, candy bars, and good ol' chocolate frosting. What is SO bad about that? \\n\\nAny tourist visiting Portland will have to make a trip to Voodoo Doughnut. It's almost sacrilegious if you don't. Like people will stare and judge you. Are Voodoo's doughnuts really that remarkable? Considering the ridiculous lines, you'd think so. I waited roughly 30 minutes and it was late afternoon...not really prime doughnut consumption time. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I decided to try three of their sugary creations. None of them were memorable-- in a positive way. They were all extremely sweet. I was disappointed that the doughnuts were not warm. I'm assuming with the millions of people who visit daily, their stuff is all fresh. \\n\\nMaple Blazer Blunt Doughnut - raised yeast doughnut dusted with cinnamon sugar. The tip is dipped in maple frosting and red sprinkles. This doughnut is supposed to resemble a blunt (how Portland), and is a nod to their basketball team, the Trailblazers. I love maple frosting and cinnamon so I thought this doughnut would be perfect for me. Yet, the sugar + cinnamon + sprinkles + maple frosting were too sweet for me. \\n\\nMcMinnville Cream Doughnut - raised yeast doughnut filled with Bavarian cream with maple frosting. Two eyeballs and a swirly mustache are drawn on the top. The Bavarian cream was thick and rich. I would have liked this without the cream so I should have gone with the plain maple bar doughnut.\\n\\nOld Dirty Bastard Doughnut - raised yeast doughnut with chocolate frosting, Oreos, and peanut butter. Sweet Jesus. This was TOO much. My boyfriend and I ended up throwing it away, half-eaten. I can appreciate Voodoo's creative and wacky flair but dang. I might as well have been shoving sugar straight into my mouth. The first bite was fine; however, every bite after that was arduous and the flavors just started meshing into one chocolaty mess. \\n\\nThe doughnuts here aren't that decadent or to-die-for. I understand the concept of hipster doughnuts with crazy flavors, but they're average doughnuts that are just sugar bombs. Voodoo's infamous pink boxes are emblems of this sweet shop's prominent rise. However, you're not missing out on too much if you skip this \\"top\\" culinary destination.\\n\\nIt's worth mentioning that Voodoo Doughnut's neighbor is Paris Theatre, an adult movie theater.

The food is quite good, at least as far as breakfast goes, but the service is another matter. It's SLOOOOOOOW. Super slow. Mind you, this is a restaurant with maybe 8 tables, plus a counter, that seats maybe 20-25 people. We arrived shortly after they opened at 9:00 a.m., so there were a few customers already there; as there were a couple of empty tables, we were promptly seated. And then the waiting game ensued...\\n\\nA few minutes later, a waiter came by to deliver menus and take drink orders (coffee, OJ, etc.), and although this happened in a totally reasonable time frame, what happened next was an indication of what was to follow: the coffee arrived about 10 minutes later. This seemed a bit anomalous, but the waiter did go ahead and take our food order right about then. By this time, the restaurant was nearly full, but not particularly busy, and certainly not \\"slammed,\\" i.e. with a line of customers going out the door and so forth. It did not seem a good omen to me that the people at the next table, who were seated just before we arrived, got their food at least 20 minutes after placing their order. In our case, It took a full 30 minutes for the food to hit the table. By this time, the coffee had grown cold, and it took a bit of doing to get a refill. \\n\\nYes, the food was good, and yes, the wait staff were perfectly courteous. It just seems a bit odd to me that they would have apparently only one line cook on duty... although, with that said, I've seen solo short order cooks at other breakfast joints slam out dishes, one after another, without getting unreasonably behind. At Broder, it appeared that the cook was making one order at a time, and maybe part of a second. This was our second visit, and I witnessed the same thing on our first, although the restaurant was less busy that time so the wait wasn't as long. \\n\\nWould I recommend this place to others? Yes, but with reservations. First, you cannot be in a hurry whatsoever. If we had had some sort of time-sensitive commitment, I would have put down $5 for the coffee, canceled the order, and left. Second, it helps if you are enamored with Scandinavian paraphernalia and decor, in which case you can admire your surroundings while waiting for the food to arrive. I mean no sarcasm here -- if you like what you see in the pictures above, you may very well adore this place from the standpoint of decor alone, for it has real charm. And third, do not come on a blustery winter/spring/fall day if you can help it, since the front door doesn't close properly and it gets pretty drafty near the front of the restaurant. (Question to Portland restauranteurs: would it kill your bottom line to fix the door frame if you're keeping shop in a \\"vintage\\" location? I mean, this is not the first place that I've been to with this problem.)\\n\\nBut, with all that said, I'd give it better-than-average odds that we'll be back again some day."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The maple bacon bar literally brings tears to my eyes.

Love 'em.  Anywhere from the Dirty Water dogs of NYC to the all beef kind in a fresh baguette (French style) off the streets of Copenhagen.  So I got kinda excited when I saw Frank on Yelp. \\n\\nFirst time we tried to go to Frank it was on a Sunday.   Denied.  Frank was a big, fat bucket of Closed.    \\n\\nSo made alternate plans and hit up Frank a few Saturdays later.    Since my intention was to get dogs to-go (I was by myself), I ordered at the bar, which was filled with people going to the big game.   I sat down and had a drink while my food was being prepared.  Very relaxed casual atmosphere - but then again what would you expect from a hot-dog place?  Very friendly service, albiet a bit slow.  Not an issue as I wasn't in a huge rush. \\n\\nWhile waiting for my food, the couple next to me had ordered the jalapeno cheese dog in a flap jacket and declared it the \\"best damn hot dog evah\\" which made me wish I had ordered it.    Next time!!! \\n\\nSince I did want to try a few of their items, I decided to order two different dogs and have half of each. Ended up with  the Jackalope and the Chicago dog, along with waffle fries and a few dipping sauces.   Jackalope was very tasty with the unique combination of huckleberry compote and cheddar.   I *liked* the Chicago dog but it didn't really stand out in the Chicago dog playing field. The toppings were slightly overloaded in my opinion.   In this case, less is more.  Dialing back the toppings would have created a far superior dog. \\n\\nWaffle fries were very good!  Loved the selection of dipping sauces (good) but found them to be a bit thin (Buffalo Bleu and Horseradish would have been far superior if a bit thicker). \\n\\nA side note - next time I will eat in-house as the fries (and to be fair - it was a bit of time) got a bit limp when I arrived home.   Buns got a tad soggy as well.  Not a knock on Frank - I waited too long to eat the food. \\n\\nI'm really looking forward to trying the jalapeno cheddar dog in a flap jacket - soon! Very soon! \\n\\nIn closing, I love you, Frank.  And I would love you even more if you were open on Sundays (coming soon, yes?) because inexplicably, that is when I most crave hot dogs.

On the side, I got the fried grean tomatoes and the sweet potato souffle. Both were delicious. If you want to keep sugar intake down, maybe avoid the sweet potato souffle because it was very sweet. The table is given a bread basket with great cornbread and amazing cinnamon rolls. For dessert,  I had peach cobbler.

There is nothing written here that I do not agree with:\\n\\n\\"One must start with a positive comment; so here it is:  The three of us really liked the olive oil with roasted garlic and herbs that accompanied the rolls.\\n\\nWe were taken to our table by a server who dropped the menus on the floor; a good foot or two shy of the table.  He quickly picked them up and placed them on the table as we sat down.  After he announced the names of the two servers who were taking care of the dining room, we did not see a server or have water service for another 10 minutes.  \\n\\nWhen she did arrive, water glasses were delivered by the server leaning across my hostess to place my host's water glass in front of him.    Ascertaining that a cocktail menu had not been provided, she retrieved one for the table.  We took turns reading it, as they must have been at a premium in the nearly empty dining room.\\n\\nOnce drink orders were placed, the evening specials were professionally communicated.  Our server returned 10 minutes later to take our dinner order.  I informed the server that we had theatre tickets and needed to exit by 7:40.  Our server glanced at her arms and announced she did not have a watch but would be mindful of the timing.  With an hour and 20 minutes to spare, we thought this would be manageable.  \\n\\nOur drinks arrive a full 20 minutes after being ordered.  Leaning over my hostess rather than walking around the well-spaced table happened again.  My double vodka martini on the rocks with a lemon arrived in a very small, slim elegant stemmed glass (up).  The server informed me that there was no more vermouth as they were just slammed a few days earlier.  I reiterated my order, and assured her it was OK; I just needed an ice filled rocks glass.  She returned 5 minutes later with a large water glass filled with ice cubes and walked away.  \\n\\nThe two house salads that were placed on the table (leaning over my hostess yet again) arrived were well executed; my Caesar salad appeared to be missing the salad dressing.  This was quickly corrected with a sufficient quantity of Caesar salad dressing.  Rolls and the olive oil mentioned before were outstanding.  \\n\\nMy hostess' dinner of the Duck Gnocchi was acceptable; my host's scallop risotto was the best entr√©e on the table.  A different server delivered our meals; following classic service protocol with service of each guest's entr√©e from the left.  A solace.  My entr√©e, what appears to be the house specialty of lamb shank was a standout failure.  Water-logged whipped potatoes with herbs; mushy and cold saut√©ed seasonal vegetables; a dry room temperature lamb shank.  The reduction sauce so cleverly written up on the menu not present on the plate.  \\n\\nA dining room manager and perhaps a sous chef approached the table to inquire as to our evening.  I quietly pointed out the absent sauce for the lamb shank and was informed that they would immediately return to the kitchen to reduce some.  A half full stainless butter cup of a thin liquid arrived 5 minutes later.  A second round of drinks was ordered; I requested mine to be served in an actual rocks glass this time.  \\n\\nThis round of drinks arrived 25 minutes later; after we had finished our entrees.  At 7:45 I left the table to find the server for the check.  I paid the check, tipping a full 25% announcing that the time- piece deprived server would need all that money to aid in her search for 3 things:\\n\\nA new place of employment where the barkeep is not phoning it in; a new place of employment where there is a kitchen staff that understands rudimentary techniques that match a cleverly written menu; AND a simple tutorial on primary service etiquette.\\n\\nMajor and frequent disconnects in bar service; dining room service; and a lackluster kitchen will prohibit our returning.  \\n\\nLovely olive oil with the perfectly executed rolls.\\""},{"name":"Cadillac Cafe","address":"1801 NE Broadway St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Had the Caesar salad with salmon and it was wonderful!

The dining room has a distinctive upscale feel and is decorated with Peruvian portraits which really instill an ethnic vibe and prepare you for the meal to come.  Like so many 'tapas' restaurants, the menu features several interesting entrees selections but I recommend sticking with the tapas menu and ordering several small plates to share.  The following is a recounting of some of the items I ordered and my opinion of them:\\n\\nBread: \\nThe bread served at every table (complimentary) was soft, warm, and studded with quinoa (much like many of the items on their menu).  It arrived with a trio of sauces, a mild peanut-based sauce, a medium mango-based sauce, and a spicier jalape√±o-based sauce.  I didn't find any of them to be overpowering, but found myself returning to the peanut-y sauce more often than the others.  9/10\\nImage: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/andina-portland?select=HnEdnfCzWx5MrU_v8QlxQg#HnEdnfCzWx5MrU_v8QlxQg\\n\\nDrink:\\nBased on the seasonal availability of fresh cider, I decided to try their \\"Margarita de Manzanita\\" (Apple Margarita).  I found the flavor and balance of the beverage to be quite good, although I would've liked more of a tequila kick.  8.5/10\\nImage: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/andina-portland?select=w3upZBkZCgBG3G-hucsjgg#w3upZBkZCgBG3G-hucsjgg\\n\\nSeafood sebiche (sic):\\nI got a hot tip to definitely order a ceviche here and was not disappointed.  Made with fresh fish (I don't recall the type), octopus, and shrimp this was a wonderful dish.  It was obvious great care was taken to make sure the protein didn't over-soak as the cubes of fish were 'cooked' just ever so slightly on the edges, but left raw and jewel-colored at the core.  The octopus was tender and tasty as well.  A beautifully executed example of ceviche. I thought the portion was lacking for the $15 price tag though.  9/10\\n\\nSea scallop with crispy onions:\\nPerhaps my favorite dish of the evening, the generous U-12 scallop (by my estimation),  nestled into a dish and topped with fried sweet onion straws.  The chef's really onto something here, as this simple dish just worked for me.  Sweet scallop.  Sweet onions.  Salty brine.  Simply a pleasure to eat.  9.5/10\\n\\nBeef, golden raisin, and olive empanadas:\\nI found these highly recommended morsels to be quite good, but not perfect.  The beef mix within was soft and very well seasoned, and paired very nicely with the sweet golden raisins (whole) and olives, which were dark red and kalamata-style with a sharp salty flavor (also whole).  Each is served with a key lime \\"cheek\\" to squeeze into your mouth as you eat, which served to brighten up the flavors of the filling wonderfully.  Overall, a successful dish although not as good as I was expecting. 7.5/10\\nImage of both: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/andina-portland?select=3-_9k1jlOeqK2IzArrd8aA#3-_9k1jlOeqK2IzArrd8aA\\n\\nBeef heart skewers:\\nTender and very much like a filet satay, this dish was interesting.  If they didn't specifically specify the fact that the protein was offal I might never have known, save for the slight gamey flavor.  7/10\\n\\nJam√≥n Serrano:\\nWe decided to order some Serrano ham as a light finale to the meal.  Pleasantly salty and quite lean, one of the better quality Serranos I've had. 9/10 \\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/andina-portland?select=leLesVGtH99-1U5sKNEuDw#leLesVGtH99-1U5sKNEuDw\\n\\nDessert-\\nTrio of crab apples (special):\\nOf all the deserts they offered, the weekly special sounded the most interesting.  A trio of baby (crab) apples, each prepared differently.  One candied and stuffed with a smooth filling, one sliced atop a small pastry filled with house-made farmer's cheese, and one stuffed with a crema and baked with puffed pastry.  I thought all three were tasty, although the candied apple's coating was a bit brittle and hard for my taste.  7/10\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/andina-portland?select=7tpzZaLyAenrWkQmCEXYMQ#7tpzZaLyAenrWkQmCEXYMQ\\n\\nOverall, I had a very enjoyable experience at Andina and plan to return on a future visit to delve more deeply into their extensive list of small plates, having only scratched the surface on this visit."},{"name":"Bison County BBQ Bar & Grille","address":"275 Moody St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was awesome!

The atmosphere was nice with the bistro feel out front. It was a nice sunday afternoon and everywhere was sitting outside.  The other clientele was maybe a little too hipster but it's the east side so I was embracing my new lifestyle head on.  There was also a group of uber yuppie girls leaving who had just had some sort of sorority reunion/baby shower.   All that aside I figured well my roommate was raving so let's check this out.  I look at the menu and am immediately just like none of this really even sounds great and almost all of it was COLD or well I realized after I ordered.  I ordered a ham & smoked provolone expecting something maybe at least warm. I guess maybe I was excepting more of a panni style sandwich or something.  I figured it was simple they couldn't really screw up a staple like that and I was definitely not in the mood to take a risk on some random group of ingredients.  Wellllll...I was not in the least bit impressed. It was a cold and if I remember correctly open faced sandwich. The cold and slightly stale or hard bread was buttered and then they had placed a small slice of ham and cheese on each of the I think 4 small slices.  And some sort of mini sweet pickle half. (And I don't at all like sweet pickles.)  So here I am with this cold tiny ham sandwich that doesn't even look tasty. There was also some sort of \\"salad\\" a tiny mix of greens on a plate does not constitute a salad to me. Garnish sure salad not so much.  They had some sort of vinegar or oil mixture on the table that looked completely unappealing so I didn't even bother with it.  I finally take a bite and it's just not good. The ham was salty, the cheese blah...The butter on the bread was too much though I suppose helped with the hard bread.  And I think there was dijon but obviously I barely remember. Ultimately I sort of picked the meat and cheese of the bread and nibbled it. Starving by the time we were done eating.  I don't remember exactly what we paid but it was WAYYYY too much for what little I got and even smaller amount I actually ate.  I kept saying I'd give it another shot maybe trying something else but just never really wanted to.  I even had a $10 gift card from some welcome wagon coupon book we got in the mail.

They have an interesting concept: no saving seats. By the time you order, pay and are ready to sit down there should be a table available. Which was true, so good on them for making that work!\\n\\nWe went for lunch initially, but once inside the smell of breakfast made it impossible to order anything else. My veggie omelet was good, definitely on par with any other respected breakfast place around, I did enjoy that I had very large chunks of broccoli and mushrooms which made the whole thing very filling. \\n\\nMy main 'complaint' with this place is the initial set up. I get there's a line because it's very popular and people are willing to wait, but the fact that the line goes right through the middle of the restaurant is really inconvenient. While in line I was constantly in the way of servers and other seated customers who were trying to either get to the bathroom, sit down or leave. There was no good place to stand so the full 30 minutes we waited for our food and table we were constantly shuffling around to allow others to pass by. It was honestly just a very awkward experience that I'm not sure is worth repeating.\\n\\nOverall, The Paramount was a generally good experience.

But they do specials throughout the week; Wednesday's they have a $4 whiskey. \\n\\nFood: I came in having just eaten but I was tempted by their menu. We shared the mini corn dogs, pretzel, and fried green tomatoes (one of their weekly specials). The food was cheaper than their drinks and was absolutely delicious! Also, don't shun me for not having a hot dog at Frank. The pretzel was my favorite part and it was big enough for all of us to share.

We still ate all of it and washed it down with other food and their fab cocktails.   \\nRoasted Cauliflower-in the land of brussel sprouts on every menu (it's on this one too!) this unexpected delight was a crowd pleaser both times.  \\nPei Mussels-If you like mussels, order these!  \\nBrick Chicken-when the server recommended this dish, we were doubtful.

I loved the old New England feel of the restaurant but it was clear that the place was a big tourist spot. The hostesses treated us like we were waiting to go on a ride at Disney World and barely even made eye contact before shooing us upstairs. They also were keeping the restaurant week deal pretty under wraps and it didn't seem like anyone around us even had the RW menus. We had called in advance to make sure that they were serving the RW lunch on Sunday and no one really seemed to even know what we were talking about.\\n\\nIf i could rate the restaurant solely on the amount of food received for the $20.10 price tag, I would easily give it 5 stars. We started off with a piece of cornbread each, then chose between clam chowder and mussels for appetizers. My friends seemed to love their chowder and I was shocked when a huge bowl of mussels was placed in front of me with 2 pieces of garlic bread. I expected that I would get a pretty small bowl for the RW deal. The mussels were delicious and the sauce they were in was really wonderful. For entrees, we chose between fried oysters with french fries or salmon with potatoes. I've never had oysters before so I decided to take a chance. The plate was filled with oysters and fries and was a pretty huge portion. I wasn't too crazy about the oysters - not sure if that's my own personal taste or the way they were made. I also wasn't thrilled with the two dessert choices we had because I don't like apple crisp and had never heard of Indian pudding. I went with the pudding and barely touched it - again this might just be my own taste. Even with the dessert, I think the RW menu was a really good deal, I'm  just not sure I'd go back and pay full price here.\\n\\nAs for our server, she was a little crazy but nice. She contributed to the \\"Am I on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride?\\" feeling I had but gave my friends and I a pretty good laugh in the end.\\n\\nI do have one complaint to add: I HATE when you order sodas/drinks at restaurants and they basically give you a shot glass worth of soda filled to the brim with ice. I had a feeling that the touristy spot would be serving these types of drinks but tried anyway. I ordered a diet coke and think I was given a shot glass full of flat Dr. Pepper , then got charged $2 for it. This isn't the biggest deal but it's just a personal pet peeve. If I'm paying for a drink, I don't want to finish it in 1 sip. :)"},{"name":"Full Moon","address":"344 Huron Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"If you have kids, full moon is a great place to bring them.

The she crab soup had 3 pieces of crab meat in it. While the soup was tasty it was very thin. Towards the end the soup got pretty salty. I think this soup would be better as a chowder. My boyfriend thought the peel and eat shrimp was just ok . There were 6-7 pieces per order. The lobster roll was tiny! I was disappointed with the dish because it was so small. The roll was soft and buttery, the lobster and filling tasted good. The chips on the plate were there for decoration. They were thin and salty with no real flavor. The fish and chips dish was unconventional. My boyfriend though the potatoes were ok but he didn't finish them so I don't think he really liked them. He did like the fish.

Second, if you're going to have a BBQ restaurant, it needs to be damn good. Nobody wants mediocre BBQ. With that in mind, this is what I experienced on a Tuesday night: 1.) lipstick all over the wine glass that was delivered to me; 2.) a hard, dry mass of macaroni and cheese that my kids refused to eat (what kid wants baked macaroni?); 3.) dark-colored, soggy fries; 4.) a cup of refridgerated sauce (when I asked if I could have a bit more Memphis sauce for my chicken); 5.) aforementioned extra sauce arriving about 10 minutes after I requested it; 6.) very pleasant, but entirely clueless, staff. Seriously, restaurant owners, are you really this disinterested in making a go of it in Needham? As a working parent, I eat out at least twice a week.

It is a great spot to head to if you work downtown and want to kill time while traffic dies down. Not only  can you have a satisfying meal without feeling like you ate 5o gallons of fat  but the atmosphere is cozy and calm.\\n\\nNow, if you haven't been there before, you can be very surprised by how much food they put on your plate.  The tartines are open faced sandwiches, ours had a slice of brie, a spoon of apricot preserves and walnuts sprinkled on top.  Under and around our tartines were perfect leaves of spring mix lettuces.  The hummus plate was GLORIOUS.  The whole plate had a layer of the brightly colored lettuces, a big scoop of hummus, a big scoop of wonderfully aromatic tabbouleh, sun dried tomatoes, kalamata olives and six slices of fantastic freshly made bread.  So, this is a shit ton of food right?  We demolish it, but I do save two pieces of the walnut fruit bread for breakfast the next day.  \\n\\nThe flavors are wonderful, the food is light and the bread is so awesome.   The hummus was smooth and not too garlicky, the tabbouleh was so flavorful and the tartines were perfectly balanced.  Imagine my awesome surprise when we got the check.  Whole feast: $16 and some change.  No shit.\\n\\nWe pay, add a hefty tip, and I head over to get pastries.  A gigantic espresso brownie, a honey madeleine, and a chocolate croissant all went into a bag.

The omelette's are very good, not spectacular. Nor are there very many options, mostly standard (western, bacon&cheese, etc). The breakfast sandwiches are just OK. They make the sausage breakfast sandwiches with links (cut lengthwise) instead of patties. This is a big pet peeve of mine. The bacon is also too thin, not flavorful and overcooked. The home fries are also a little undercooked in general. \\n\\nLunch, B \\nThey serve breakfast during lunchtime, which is a major Win. The burgers are OK, nothing special. The melts are good but they skimp on the fillings. That is, not enough tuna in the melt etc. The fries are great! \\n\\nDinner, C+ \\nJust not memorable.

My boyfriend says that it's places like these that make you wonder why you ever go out to eat at fancy restaurants. We had an AMAZING meal for two for under $30. \\n\\nSo the things I have tried so far...\\n\\nBrie, walnut, apricot preserves tartine. Goddddddddddddd. I want to die sleeping on this bread tucked underneath a blanket of brie. The tartines are served on a rustic rock platter with a simple salad and a bunch of deep purple grapes. If you're a big Diane Lane fan and have watched Under the Tuscan Sun over 15 times, \\"they even taste purple\\". This dish was flawless, the bread soft and slightly sweet, the brie soft and creamy, the walnuts nicely toasted, the apricot jelly a perfectly sweet compliment to the brie. \\n\\nThe ham and gruyere tartine is also delicious but I didn't enjoy it quite as much because it didn't have any sweetness to undercut the salty ham, salty gruyere, salty gherkins, and bitter mustard. But I guess that's what the grapes are for. \\n\\nThe soup of the day was tomato gazpacho which was everything I imagined it to be! I feel like I've been wanting to order gazpacho for years and years and never pull the trigger. So I have this image in my mind of what my first gazpacho experience should be like. And they hit the nail on the head. When I think about it, there's not a whole lot that distinguishes gazpacho from eating a large bowl of salsa. Whatever the subtle difference is, Blue Dahlia achieved it and I can say that it was much more appealing than eating a bowl of salsa. The veggies were fresh, it was perfectly salted, and it was nice and chunky. \\n\\nThe special frittata of the day was a southwestern frittata with blue cheese, corn, onions, and bellpeppers (yellow and red). I don't know what inspired them to add blue cheese to this otherwise very traditionally southwestern combination, but it was truly inspired. The blue cheese was definitely present, but somehow it brought the flavors together rather than cut through them. How? I don't know.\\n\\nLastly, but definitely not leastly, the carrot cake. For heavens sake. For one, it was GINORMOUS. A slab of cake served on a slab of rock. The cake was very chunky with a generous serving of carrot shreds, walnuts, and raisins. And not too sweet at all! The icing was what did it for though and unfortunately I have not way to describe it. There are no words. Topped off with a generous flurry of shredded coconut, this was one of the finest desserts that has ever entered my mouth. How could I live in Austin for 4 years and finally discover it when I'm about to leave?

The portion of the fries are small, but they do have complimentary fried pita chips to nibble on while you wait. I do like the Shawarma, it's really flavorful but very messy.

While liquor and milk have always been a bad combo in my eyes, those that ordered them seemed to really enjoy them. The beer list is okay: they definitely branch out of the basics but it'd be great to see some more seasonal rotations factored in or some more options that paired better with a burger: I found them all to be pretty heavy. \\n\\nThe burgers are available in two sizes and I'm always in between.

The mac and cheese? more like a cold souffl√© with warm cheese on top. Tasteless collard greens, and the chicken was barely warm. To me this was along the quality of Luby's. My partner had the turkey with dressing and fried green tomatos. Turkey was VERY dry and tasted old, the fried tomatos were cold and soggy, so we sent that back. And they still wanted to charge us for it. After questioning the charge We got a $4 credit. They still wanted us to pay the remaining $8 on the plate.

I had the endive salad and the steak frites (sadly, they ran out of the mussels right before my order went in) topped with their peppercorn sauce.   Juicy steak cooked exactly to order, good fries, rich sauce.  Stole a spoonful (or three) of the wife's french onion soup and loved its richness. The roast chicken at the table next to ours looked amazing.\\n\\nBy the way, they don't take reservations and the place only has about 12 tables in it, so go early or expect to wait a while at the very crowded little bar (or out front).

There were a couple two-seater tables outside and a counter with barstools inside, but no cozy tables or anything of that nature.\\n\\n2. The serving size was so big that there was no way I could walk home afterward. MAJOR. FOOD. COMA. (in a wonderfully satisfying way.)\\n\\nDespite those two minor issues, I was a BIG fan of the place.

Papa Gino's has no problem with adding a couple of ravioli to your order.\\n\\nWhen my order came up he called to me and said \\"here is your chicken parm with linguini\\" (nope that's not spaghetti).  I had little time to spare so I took it and left.  \\n\\nI got home with a bag with a growing stain on it's bottom. I took out the order which was wrapped in saran wrap to find it leaking red sauce.  Taking the saran wrap off released a deluge of sauce all over the floor and table.  Opening the overfilled container released more sauce all over the table and floor.

It's not that they are being generous with the food, they are being stingy with the containers.  \\n\\nOf course as I suspected even after asking I got chicken parm with linguini, not spaghetti as I had requested.

Anyone who works in the restaurant industry needs to have this place investigated for how they cook their food and treat their cusomters, or be on the look out to stay away. The huge problem of course is dealing with making people tip. This is not something they understand very well because there is no law that requires tipping, but they seem to think that. The service with their attitude is horrible as well. \\n\\nI ate there a few times and always ordered the same dish, well as time went on they kept changing what went in the dish and when I would ask for the original items in the dish, they would deny ever having put them in there. I was surprised by that reaction. It was that only dish that kept me going back because it was so good, but it was the waitresses and owner that has kept me away, because they would always push about not tipping. The first times I did, but after they got sloppy on their service and food, I stopped, which turned into a shouting match of explaining that I don't have to tip. The lady kept hounding me about it and threated to add on a service charge of 15% for not tipping. I warned her if that if I saw it on my statement, she would be looking at a fine and that I would report them to the Texas Restaurant association, At which point the lady stopped talking and didn't say another word. If they give you hassle about removing a charge or reducing a price and ask for any personal IDs you should tell them no and that they should not be asking for that information in the first place. If you use a credit card, watch what amount they actually charge you because they like to add on little fees if they think you were a bad customer.\\n\\nI truely believe this place needs to be investigated for their business practices. They are very rude and do not provide proper service, food, and cleanliness. If anything, get rid of the owners and bring in new people. I know that is not realistic but the food is good just not the people who run it. If there is rich business man out there who reads this, please buy up this place, get rid of the owners, shut it down, renovate the place, fix it up and then re-open so people can enjoy this place in peace, and not worrying about getting fined or taxed for asking for too much or looking at them wrong.\\n\\nIf nothing is done to stop how they run their place, then sooner or later it will turn into the soup naiz's place, where the owner can ban anyone at will and you can only order certain things and if you complain, you're kicked out, just like they sorta do now.\\n\\nThis place really needs to change. and as some people have already stated, this place doesn't even deservce one star.

This used to be the old 'Cru' restaurant on Broadway.  \\n\\nWent here with a friend and we both liked it alot.   The coconut rice was really good, my friend said it was the best she's had and she's usually a little pickier.  The service was great, I believe it was the owner going around serving us.  We went on a Friday and every table was reserved except for 1, which we luckily got.  \\n\\nWe ordered their Golden Angel Wings (stuffed chicken) to start. This was so delicious, my friend and I would have ordered another but we had two more dishes coming and rice.  The way they stuffed it and the ingredients used gave it a real delicate taste.    Next we got Gaeng Kiew-Wan ( green curry with chicken ).  It had the right amount of heat, coconut milk, was very fragrant from the ingredients and great with the rice.\\n\\nLast we got Jitlada Aroy-D Beef: beef with spices on top of spinach.  I thought the spinach would have been soggy since it was under the beef and sauce but surprisingly, the spinach wasn't limp or overcooked.  I for sure thought the heat from the sauce and beef would continue to cook the spinach but it didn't.  They cooked the spinach just enough so that when we got it and started to eat, it was just right.\\n\\nOne thing you should keep in mind is that this is place is a bit fancier than other Thai places so the price reflects that.  The dishes were fabulous but the size is smaller than other Thai places.

Being a foodie, she had read about The Paramount was interested in trying it before she moves across the country in 2 weeks.  Our first impression was that the line was too long (out the door) and that we weren't THAT interested in giving it a shot.  However, after checking a few other places around the area, we ended up back there to wait in line.  Boy, we were not prepared for the wait.  My friend's husband ended up going outside to find a place to sit due to lack of space both for seating and for the line.  Space is pretty limited inside.  There's tables on your left when you walk in and more tables across from the ordering counter.  But on a day like today, the tables across from the counter are less than ideal.  Unless you want random strangers who are waiting in line leaning over your table as they get out of the way for the busboy wheeling a cart of dirty dishes to the back.  Then it would be perfect for you.  As we got closer to the order counter, I spied the ladies room.  Since it looked like we were going to be in line for another decade, I pushed my way thru people waiting in line only to find that I couldn't open the door because there were too many people squeezed in front of it.  After a little maneuvering by myself and the people crowding the door, I was finally able to open the door wide enough for a 5 year old but barely enough for grown, adult me.  Opening the door to get out was another terrifying experience since I didn't want to knock anyone unconscious when they were so close to the finish line.  Managed to tap the nice gentleman who had graciously moved earlier to let me in.  My advice...hold it in.\\n\\nWe finally made it up to the counter to place our order.  Feeling a bit pressured about knowing the 'right' way to order, since there was still a long line of people behind us, we practiced our orders a few times to ensure no disruption to the process.  Out of about 4 people manning the cooking stations, there was one guy in charge of taking the orders while the others listened in.  It seems that using this method, they are bound to get an order wrong at some point.  Out of our 3 meals, 1 didn't come out right.  My friend and I both ordered the BLT.  Both asked for no mayo.  They got my order right.  Fruit salad plates are custom made.  Allergic to melons, I had to request which fruits I wanted.  We had been making googly eyes at everyone's fruit plates while we were in line, so I knew I wanted strawberries and blueberries.  However, he suggested adding a fresh banana which I was a bit hesitant, but when I saw that they used fresh bananas I caved and told him to throw one on.  \\n\\nWait time at the counter was about 10 minutes since not only did we have to wait for them to make our food, we had to wait for them to finish making the food of the group before us.  We then had to wait for the group in front of us to finish questioning the cashier on why their meal was so expensive.  Boy, were we happy to finally get out of there!  Unfortunately, since my friend's husband had ordered a burger, we had to wait for them to bring it out to us since it took longer to cook.  Thankfully, it was only another 5 minutes.  In total, it took about 45 minutes for us to get our food, which definitely was not ideal.\\n\\nThe food on the other hand was fresh and tasty.  The bacon was thick and crisp.  Tomatoes big and juicy.  Bread perfectly toasted.  The fries were delicious, which I believe is due to being soaked in oil and not terribly crispy.  All the fruits in the salad plate were fresh.  Their are very generous in their portions.  I had the fun of watching one of the cooks create a buffalo chicken wrap.  The wrap was bulging when it was all said and done.  I had more than enough after devouring my BLT and fries that I brought most of my fruit plate home and have just finished while writing this review.  Delicious!\\n\\nWould I go back?  I'm not sure the food was entirely worth the long wait, but I would not be opposed to ordering ahead.  I would not chance just 'swinging by' unless I was with someone I wanted to stand very closely to for a long period of time."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Very unexpected in a good way.

I didn't bite into any chunks of tendon or nastiness.

The seafood gumbo excellent.   We had seven there for dinner this past Saturday night.   The scallops were excellent, the trout excellent.   The fish and seafood entrees were all terrific.   Service though, was weird.   Our waitress was really very nice, extremely articulate and friendly.  We really liked her, but she made some garish errors.  For example, my friend only ate a few bites of her fish, but the waitress didn't offer to box it up.  Instead she put a dirty plate on top of it and took it away.  When we pointed out her mistake, she got defensive, but did have a fresh one made to take home (only after some gentle prodding).   Then, there were over $40 in desserts on the bill even though no one ordered desert.   She said the prior party at the same table had ordered desert, but none of us understood this excuse.   She took the deserts we didn't order off the bill.  Overall we liked her a lot, and said nothing to the manager, but it was bizarre.    Back to the food.   Better than The Fish Market.   Oceanaire has better portions, but I'd say the food was better at Optomist.

We got there and had to stand in a line for about and hour waiting to order. Then once your food is ready you take a seat. It is a good idea because it eliminates people having to wait to get a table and I did like how I got to see the chefs cook my food.

After our delayed arrival into PDX, we went straight into a 2+ hour parents meeting, and then in a borrowed car did a poor job of navigating Portland traffic and finding our Downtown hotel. And with a minimal breakfast and no lunch, we were a pretty hungry and crabby pair. \\n\\nAfter we checked into our hotel, the person at the front desk highly recommended Andina. It was a little bit of a hike to the Streetcar, followed by a moderate ride to the Glison stop and then a few blocks walk to the restaurant.. I'm proud that we both decided to \\"suck it up\\" and make the journey to what turned out to be a stellar dining experience. \\n\\nGayle and I arrived to find that the main dining room was full. Yet, our hosts were very attentive and accommodating and walked us over to check out the bar area and then pointed out the available seating in the patio below. That turned out to be a great choice since we had a nice degree of privacy and the live music playing in the bar area filtered in nicely downstairs. \\n\\nBoth Gayle and I appreciated our waiters attention, knowledge and service. And he appears to be held to high standards! Very soon after we sat down, I think it was Doris Platt Rodriguez herself who stopped by, welcomed us and instructed the waiter to make sure we were taken care of. \\n\\nWe started (and pretty much gobbled up) fresh bread served with 3 Peruvian sauces (hot chile verde, a sweet middle one and peanuty third). Our initial wine by the glass orders of Loimer Rose and Luna Benegas (red) were OK, but not remarkable. After that, Gayle switched to a much more complex red Amancaya and I opted for the red Sangria. Both were much better choice and the Sangria (including the soaked fruit) was the best I've had in a very long time. \\n\\nFor the main courses (we skipped the small plates menu), Gayle ordered the Arroz Con Pato (pan-seared duck breast and crispy duck confit served over cilantro-infused rice with red bell peppers, peas and carrots ) and I opted for the Seco a la Nortena (lamb shank slow-cooked with cilantro, black beer, aj√≠ Amarillo, onions and garlic; served with a bean stew and salsa criolla). Both dishes were cooked perfectly. My lamb practically melted off the bone and the taste of the duck with the Peruvian risotto offered the perfect combination of texture and flavour.  And even at the end, when Gayle was full, but there was still food on the plate, the flavours in her mouth kept urging her on.\\n\\nBut alas, even those amazing flavours couldn't convince us to try something off the very tempting desert menu.

The scallops with oxtail marmalade were another huge hit at the table.  The oxtail was prepared perfectly and was not too heavy to cover the delicate flavor of the scallops.

The second time I went with my parents and my sister for a little birthday dinner for my mom.  It was disappointing... Waitress recommended the specials: pan-seared fish and octopus something... and we got a couple of other things and an appetizer to start.  The first thing to come after the appetizer was the octopus for my dad, and nothing else followed for the next 10 minutes, during which time we discovered a long curly hair tangled up in all that octopus.  Dad's not the one to make a big deal of things, so we just quietly told the waiter and along with apologies we were told that a new one was going to be made for him as soon as possible,  The next one was that fish special... they didn't really mention that it was going to be JUST one piece of fish and that's it, not even a mint leaf or anything just to make it look less lonely.  We would have ordered something else if we knew it wasn't really going to be a meal, but whatever, we just roll with it.  Every dish was coming in at such long intervals from each other, that by the time something else came the previous was already finished.  We were all hungry and kept sharing things the best we could.  Finally the octopus came for the second time, by then we'd all finished everything else we had and just sat there waiting for my dad to eat it.  It was an okay experience because we were all in a good mood and didn't want anything to ruin it, but it was still a horrible dining experience.

While it's true that The Kennedy School is an original (if kitschy) concept and the facilities have been beautifully renovated, the overall experience leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\nThe first problem with The Kennedy School is that the beer is very poor.  This is particularly ironic in light of the fact that the McMeniman organization made its fortune through brewing.  There were only a few types of microbrews on tap at The Kennedy School, and all of them were either too thick, too watery, or too flavorless.  Portland is a city with tons of great microbreweries.  Serious beer enthusiasts should avoid the tepid fare at The Kennedy School and spend their drinking time at a pub which produces a high-quality product.\\n\\nThe second problem with The Kennedy School is the \\"Soaking Pool.\\"  At the risk of sounding mean-spirited, this tub doesn't cast the denizens of Portland or the guests of The Kennedy School in the most flattering light (pun intended).  The soaking pool, which is essentially a large heated bathtub, is located in front of a large bank of windows in an outside courtyard of the school.  The pool is lit from the bottom, and this makes everyone sitting in it look obese if they are viewed from the bank of windows.  \\n\\nWhile the mediocre beer and the soaking pool eyesore were problems at The Kennedy School, the worst aspect of the place was the service.  All of the employees had a wannabe-Bohemian-look-at-how-hip-I-am attitude.  They gave me the wrong directions to the Portland airport (which is only a few miles from the hotel), they didn't know anything about car rental locations in Portland, they got ALL of our restaurant orders wrong, and they couldn't even provide basic advice about the beers which were being brewed at their own establishment.  The net effect of this is that the employees came across like a bunch of maladjusted and poorly mannered high school dropouts.  The McMeniman organization should stop hiring wannabe artists and should start hiring people with a modicum of customer service skills.  I don't expect an army of Stanford MBAs to wait on me at a hotel.  Nevertheless, I do expect $130-a-night-hotel employees (not to mention waiters and waitresses) to have basic manners. \\n\\nIf you like great beer, great food, and/or great service at a hotel, avoid The Kennedy School like the plague.  For a comparable price, one can get a great room at the downtown Marriott (which has better beer in its bar and excellent service).  The rooms at The Kennedy School are okay, but after you're done dealing with the incompetent employees, your entire experience at The Kennedy School will be tainted.  I will never stay at this hotel or any other McMeniman location again, and I would encourage discerning travelers to heed my warning: The Kennedy School is the ninth circle of bad-hotel-service hell."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Most importantly... the doughnuts are incredible.

Everyone was eating tartine's around us and they looked amazing. She specifically got the Ham with gruyere cheese & Dijon mustard. The bread was extremely thick, flavorless, crumbley and dried out. The gruyere cheese, wasn't melted...which I found odd. It would have been so delicious warmed up! \\n\\nWe decided to go for dessert because we were still hungry. Mom ordered bread pudding. Sadly it wasn't all the rage, either.\\n\\nAlthough we are disappointed, we concluded that Blue Dahlia definitely deserved a second shot. Maybe we ordered the least-favorite dishes? Maybe it was an off day?"},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Only came to this place to have drinks.

Since moving to Austin from NY, I was in search of a good Italian Restaurant. I tried an upscale one at the Domain and was very disappointed. I thought, if this is what Texans think Italian food is, I am in trouble. That was NOT Italian. \\nMy boss told me of Reale's. She told me it looks a bit rough around the edges, but she felt the food was good. She didn't know what my standards were in terms of taste.....but she suggested it none the less. \\n\\nUpon entering, the person greeting us was a friendly older gentleman. He took us to a seat where apparently the performer typically sets up- the stage. My boss was not kidding about the decoration. I looked at my husband and we both thought, wow. We are in trouble! It looks like my grandma decorated it with what she thought was a trendy, romantic, Italian flair. On the wall of our booth was this face that was supposed to look like a statue face. It was made of styrefome. The mouth was wide open making an 'o' face. HA. I still don't understand that. The ceiling has a fake cathedral stain glass dome- carpet very worn, paint could use lightening. The lay out was fine though. Space is great. Apparently on Wednesday nights, a Frank Sinatra impersonator sings. We were able to enjoy him a little bit. I have to admit, the guy is very good!\\n\\nOur Server was very nice, in fact everyone seemed very nice. My husband and I ordered drinks and the server, God bless her, asked for my ID. I am 40- and was smiling.\\nWe ordered a combo appetizer as we typically enjoy fried calamari , bruschetta and stuffed mushrooms. \\n\\nThe appetizer was delicious. We did not know they brought bread sticks too. They are awesome. Perfect texture, doughy, warm, melted butter on top....We love the bread sticks.\\nThe bruschetta is one of my husband's favorites- the calamari was good. \\n\\nMy husband ordered the Meat Lasagna and I ordered eggplant Parmigiana. \\nThe food came out in abundance. Large servings. The Lasagna smelled wonderful and was a big thick square chunk. The eggplant is shaved thin and breaded perfectly. I was very pleased with the taste of both dishes. The food is what I was hoping for. The ceasar salad was delicious as well. I was excited to have finally found the Italian food I am accustomed to. We have gone back several times and in fact, am thinking of going there tonight because I am now craving eggplant. \\n\\nI introduced this place to some friends as well. I gave them the same warning of the decoration- the food is fabulous enough that no one cares about the decoration! I will post pics. The reason I did not give 5 stars is because of the decorations being very very outdated- perhaps extinct."},{"name":"Ganko Ittetsu Ramen","address":"318 Harvard St, Unit 3","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Wasn't bad, but my wife and I thought it was ridiculously overpriced for ramen.

The cheese board was $10 during HH and $19 other times. Pricey, but insanely good and the portions were awesome. They've since cut down on portion sizes for the cheese boards, as well as the order of mussels. I've been here and seen an order of mussels reach even 30 mussels per order. They were always delicious. \\nThis evening we came and ordered the cheese board and the mussels (along with two bottles of wine) and the cheeses were much smaller portions (still delicious). And the mussels were about 12-15 mussels that tasted awfully fishy. Incredibly disappointed. Not only was the quantity and the taste suffering, but they raised the price by about $3.00. Acceptable if the taste and quantity were still good, but everything suffered from the recent changes at Blue Dahlia. \\nThis used to be our favorite date spot, now we probably won't come back for a while.

On one of my last visits, I ordered the eggplant Parmigiana and the server told me it was just delivered and it was \\"still frozen\\". The same thing happened previously when I ordered the lasagna. Are they buying pre-made food from someplace like Sysco and selling it as homemade?? Obviously, they are. I agree with some of the other reviews that the garlic knots are great and the pizza is decent but the rest of the food has taken a nosedive in terms of freshness and quality. Service has also declined as well. Seems everytime I come they have a bunch of new servers who don't even know the menu.

However, I had their CHA CHA CHA ramen and their Takoyaki (my favorite street food from home). Everything tastes just like it did in Tokyo give or take a few. The broth was much more seasoned and dense than I'm used to, and they could tone down on the toppings a little because it does slightly take away from the amazingness of the ramen noodles.

When we were called for our table, the waitress did not address us with words, rather beckon us with a decidedly rude gesture. Perhaps this was because we were younger (juniors in college) compared to other patrons, but regardless, the uncharismatic and uninteresting wait staff, unprofessional serving and horribly disappointing food solidifies any opinion one could make of this restaurant.

My boyfriend and I each had the smoked tofu plate with kale and black beans with rice. \\n\\nFor those of you who aren't even considering reading the rest of my review because I went to a BBQ restaurant and ordered TOFU, please understand - the tofu actually rules. It will change your mind about tofu completely. I take non-vegetarian friends (sometimes large parties of 'em) to Burnt Fork frequently and they *always* forgo the meat options for tofu. Seriously. Meat-eaters choose the tofu. It is just that good. /respect\\n\\nOk, back to the review.\\n\\nThe tofu is organic, locally made, and marinated in the thick sweet memphis sauce. It's lightly smoked (in a real smoker!), marinated, and distinctively chewy - great for those who feel they need to \\"tear into\\" something. The kale is local, served in a sweet-savory potlikker, and topped with pecans. The black beans were super flavorful and served with a little bit of rice. The plate is served with housemade bread. We both drank iced tea and it's always so good because they use a decent brand. They have fresh lemonade and make Arnold Palmers if you're into that.\\n\\nBurnt Fork's ownership has a serious (not just lip-service) commitment to local and organic sourcing that I have a lot of respect for. \\n\\nI'm not much one for condiments, but all of their housemade sauces are terrific. I like to put the mustardy sauce on the kale. Sometimes I have to add a little extra sweet memphis sauce to the tofu, but tonight it was thoroughly covered, thick and rich. \\n\\nEverything was perfectly seasoned, hot and delicious. I have perhaps excessively high standards for dining out (I've worked in a lot of restaurants and owned my own food-based business) but nothing left me wanting.\\n\\nTo address those who have mentioned service issues: I too have experienced those issues. We're talkin' unusually long waits for food and drink, harried servers, being \\"out\\" of an item, one person working a huge room alone, etc. I had been going to Burnt Fork for months before the service suddenly went south for a few weeks. I actually stopped going there for a minute! \\n\\nI'm so glad I came back. I am reminded that any good restaurant goes through phases where they're short on help, a cook quits unexpectedly, there's a death in the family or serious illness, etc. Things like that can really throw a restaurant for a loop. If you happen to go on a night when the restaurant is going through something like that, well of course they're not going to be as on their game as they should be. It's frustrating for all parties involved.\\n\\nBut it's temporary. This too shall pass, right? I don't write a lot of reviews on Yelp because I feel like, to be fair to an establishment, I need to go several times to formulate an educated and fair judgment. Burnt Fork was going through a phase. They're out of it now. Service is back to being oustanding. The gal who waited on us tonight was attentive, smart, friendly, and quick. \\n\\nHowever, food is cooked to order, so there may still be a wait. Tonight we placed and order and waited about 25 minutes. When it came, it was absolutely worth it. If you are terribly impatient, in a hurry, or very very hungry, you might get flustered. But if you're not you'll be fine. Just leisurely enjoy that iced tea or beer and get in some family gossip. Remember, food cooked to order takes time.\\n\\nFinally! Best part of the night! FRIED PIES! Yep, let me be the first to tell the Yelp Community that Burnt Fork is now serving fried apple pies, and they are incredible! I couldn't believe the perfect flaky pastry and tender stove-top cooked apple filling. I just had some Whiffies pies in Portland OR and I thought they were the pinacle of fried handpie-dom, but Burnt Fork's apple is my new fave. Better still, they're vegan! (Most fried fruit pies are - yep, even Krispy Kreme fried pies are vegan - check the label, I swear. Weird, right?!) Thank you Burnt Fork for these little fried pieces of heaven!!

We were promptly shown to our table and there were just one other table of patrons there besides us. Our server told us about the tropical juices and we had a Mora (blackberry) juice, Morchata (passion fruit) juice and a Sprite. The tropical juices were good ($2.50) but there were no free refills. The soft drinks were a little less at $2. I wanted the Mango juice but they did not have it. I settled for the Morchata juice.\\n\\nFor the entrees, my friend had La Pasita which our server said it's served mainly on weekends. You will not find it on the regular menu unless you request for it. It had chunks of steaks, pork rinds, 2 corn cakes and slices of avocados over a bed of rice. It also comes with a bowl of red beans.

The salad came with regular clear lettuces, dried cranberries, tomatoes, avocados and some guarcomole on the side. Ranch dressing came with it too but it looked rather skimpy. The meal was $7.45 with / without the chicken. \\n\\nThe other friend had the Toston Steak which had chucks of steaks over some plantains covered with cheese and some Sofrito. The steaks were well seasoned and the guys enjoyed their meals. This came to $5.95. We ordered a side of Yuca fries to share ($3.25) as I was still hungry after eating my salad.  \\n\\nThe menu was quite an eyeful for me. There are Tostones with various kinds of meat to pick from. Then there are the Arepas-Corncakes with various kinds of meat too. You can get steak, chicken, beef, sausage or shrimp as any of your choice of meat. For the sides, you can have french fries, yuca fries, bowl of rice, black beans or maduras (plantains). The other items are Salchipapas which are beef franks with french fries. The Pinchos-Kabobs come either with steaks or grilled chicken plus corn cakes with them. There are 3 kinds of hot dogs, namely Super dog, Pit Bull dog and Lomi dog. These are unique because some of them come with quail eggs. If these are too bizarre, then there are hamburgers with beef or chicken. There are also various kinds of Burrito bowls with different kinds of meat that you like. There are Tortas which has different kinds of meat of your choice in a fluffy bread. Cuban sandwiches are also an option and tacos with various meats of your choice. Gosh, the list goes on and on with Maicitos-Corn and Quesadillas. Looks like there's something for everyone here. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was nice and inviting. Tables and chairs were clean as well. There were some flat screens showing the Falcon game going on at that time. I was cheering for the Falcons and biting my nails at the same time whenever the defense was wavering. The server came back a little later with different bottles of sauces but we were almost finished with our meals. I wished he had brought it out sooner because my salad dressing was skimpy to begin with. The four sauces were Pineapple sauce, Tostones sauce, Chipotle sauce and Pink sauce (mayo plus ketchup base). I enjoyed the Tostones and Pink sauce the most with the Yuca fries. The staff spoke good English and were friendly to everyone. We will most likely come back to visit to try the other items on the menu.

The big downside to this place is that the coffee (I think) is Kobos, and it's that not very good plus gives you that really agitated feeling kind of coffee. Still, the Cadillac is one of my top five brunch places of all time."},{"name":"Caf√© 47","address":"47 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Just off  fashionable and trendy Newberry Street, Cafe' 47  is a small bistro with a contemporary cozy vibe. We walked there in hopes of finding some of that warm comfort food that is so appealing on a  foggy, rainy evening.  Cafe' 47 is a causal dining spot and perfect for a simple meal that is reasonably priced.  Not \\"Yeping\\" where I was going, I didn't know that they are known for their pizzas, but I had heard from a local that the risotto was worthy of a visit. The words 'a good risotto\\" sounds particularly wonderful on such a dreary night, so off we went.\\n\\nWe were seated towards the back in a small booth. Behind our table were a few taller tables that defined the bar area. Here were some lively souls downing a few beers and  \\"black out in a can\\" concoctions , giving us some entertainment as we waited for our food. We were lucky to have grabbed the last open table. \\n\\nOur meal began with an order of mozzarella sticks. I expected the usual, accompanied by marinara, but was surprised when a plate of gigantic tubes oozing with melted cheese was placed before us.  A meal unto itself and definitely rainy weather fare. \\n\\nThe vegetable risotto was creamy with a nice balance of vegetables to rice. Among the veggies were mushrooms, red peppers, spinach and onions.  It was filling, respectfully healthy and very satisfying. The special that night was a lobster ravioli which also received high marks from our group. I would say that Cafe' 47 is somewhere between a 3 star and 4 star rating.\\n\\nOn the dessert menu was a trio of cupcakes which was ordered in spite of satiation being reached 20 minutes before seeing a dessert menu.  The trio of  red velvet, vanilla and chocolate mini cupcakes and coffees completed this meal. \\n\\nNot bad for a reasonably priced meal. The risotto was $14, the trio of mini cupcakes $6. Warmed by our delicious meal in a cozy and friendly bistro, we headed back into the foggy night air, content and ready to call it a day."},{"name":"Scales 925","address":"30 Ivan Allen Blvd, Ste 125","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Ambience-great\\nMusic - awesome\\nFood - ???\\nI will return for the appetizers but the collard greens were warm, Short Ribs were fatty BBQ shrimp were awesome as was the Fried Green tomatoes.

I highly recommend the Jolly Roger.) and perused at our leisure.\\n\\nFor apps we got the frothy she-crab soup and the salmon \\"opportunity.\\" The soup wasn't made with actual crab meat - just crab roe. It was very frothy as the name implied but it had the viscosity of water. The flavor was good and I could have drank the whole thing in two minutes. That being said it was described as a bisque to me and I really prefer them to be thicker than the dish we got. The shrimp toast with it was very tasty but super greasy. You could see the oil spreading all over the napkin it was placed on top of. \\n\\nThe salmon opportunity was four bites of raw salmon with peaches, oil, and marcona almonds on top. It was just an alright bite. I don't think it was worth the $10 price tag since the oil really overpowered the fish. \\n\\nFor entrees we got the monkfish and the skirt steak. The steak was incredibly tasty with a lovely demi-glaze on top. It had roasted zucchini and squash underneath which really soaked up the flavor. The monkfish was in a creamy tomato broth that paired nicely with the dish. Both of these were solid and I would order them again. The plates were small but well presented. We didn't order dessert because almost all of the choices were already sold out. Our waiter was nice enough to at least attempt to cajole us, but we were ready to go since it was getting pretty late.\\n\\nThe Optimist was a solid three stars.

I like salt but these fries were so salty they actually hurt my tongue. \\n\\nMoral of the story: either the kitchen does not know how to read or the people at the register don't know how to ring in orders.  \\n\\nOh and ordering over the phone is extremely annoying.  I called last week and ordered and the girl literally did not speak in sentences.  This is how it went: Name? Address? Order? Cash or Credit? Thanks.  This girl was beyond rude.  If my meal is going to come to $21 I'm going to need you to be nice to me and get my order correct.  Additionally, every time I call the phone is busy and goes to voicemail except the voicemail is full so you get this annoying message.

This isn't your standard chain bar where it's really just a nicer part of the restaurant.  No, this bar made the rest of this dive of a restaurant look like a five-star establishment.  There were just a couple tables open.  One was shoved in too tight to sit at, another didn't have enough chairs, and the one we picked was awkwardly put in the middle of this small room.

The service was great sans the chatter from our server who after making his introduction decided to tell us that this was the best restaurant in town and that they served 1000's of people. In all honesty the proof is in the eating the meal and McDonald's serves billions of people...number served to me does not equal great dining.  The food was excellent! - the salmon chips(which folks rave about) were indeed delicious but not my favorite. I recommend the Brisket Empanadas- quite delicious and savory to the last bite. Main course- we ordered three plates: the Bistro steak, Pork Shank and the Bronzed Scallops. All three were cooked to perfection. My favorite was the Bronzed Scallops - served with grits and a tomato sauce. It had a bit of a spicy kick but was perfectly blended to the dish. Dessert was a Popcorn Sundae with caramel and sea salt. It seems like every where you go you will find caramel and sea salt however I can truly say mixed with their homemade Popcorn ice cream - your taste buds will be ecstatic. The only downside to our experience was walking out and smelling like we were sitting in a barbecue pit. The ventilation is non-existent. As a result your clothing is saturated and unfit for wearing after exiting this establishment. My colleagues complained of this too, as well as another friend who went the previous night. We were traveling for work so having to have your suit laundered is an inconvenience.

The towing sign is somewhat misleading - it makes you think that you cannot park in the lot and then leave to go another establishment. After spending $200 to get my car out, in addition to the $150 we spent at the establishment, we will never return to Hooter's. The management was not cooperative.

However, it was still summertime and the thought of hot noodle soup was not ideal. However nowwww it is December and the perfect time for ramen! We decided to head over there on a Sunday around noon. There were a few people waiting for a table, but not too many. The space around the hostess station is very tight, and I can see it getting very awkward if there are a bunch of people waiting on a table. Not to mention I felt bad for the poor girls at the hostess station because they were constantly getting cold air from the opening doors. My husband and I had to wait a grand total of 4 minutes since we opted to sit at the bar. \\n\\nHe got the tonkotsu ramen, tried to order the ebi (shrimp), but they were out.  Those were the two specials that day, not sure how often they change. I opted for the spicy chicken ramen (medium spicy). We also shared the spicy creamy shrimp tempura. \\n\\nLuckily, we didn't have to wait long for the food, either. The shrimp tempura came out, which we devoured. It is basically like \\"firecracker shrimp\\" if you have ever had it. I think the sauce is made from sriracha and mayo. Not very spicy, in my opinion. I think it would be really nice served with some thinly julienned daikon radish. The creaminess of the sauce got a tad overwhelming and I craved veggies to go with it. \\n\\nFor my ramen, I asked for thick noodles (it came with thin). My husband asked for the same. His ramen came with the thick noodles, but mine came with the thin. It was OK though, because then we got to try both kinds. The thin noodles were obviously a lot lighter and went well with the chicken ramen. The thick noodles are more substantial and hold up better in a rich tonkotsu broth. I enjoyed the chewiness of the thick noodles and would choose those over the thin if I had make a choice. Oh, I did not find the spicy chicken ramen spicy at all -- you definitely have to add your own heat or really specify if you want a big kick.\\n\\nWe finished our meals quickly, and it's a good thing, because our seats were waiting for the next patrons."},{"name":"Hair of the Dog Brewery and Tasting Room","address":"61 SE Yamhill St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"First..the good.. the very, very good!\\n\\nOf our trip to the Portland area, Hair of the Dog had the best beer we had.

There is a small lot right next to the restaurant that appears to be private and did not have any signs (at least i didn't see any at night) that says it's for poor calvins. Once we saw a few people walk out of the restaurant and get into their cars, we took their spot and assumed it'd be fine. There are also some parallel street parking (it's a one way road) you can do but watch out for No Parking areas.\\n\\nInterior: The interior is very unique. It is not your typical 1 level, high ceiling, fancy restaurant. Back story is - Calvin purchased an abandon building and patched it up to make it his restaurant. You have an outdoor / porch area where if weather is nice, big windows/doors open up to the streets. You have your interior parts but it feels like an underground bar. It's layout can be confusing - they keep it dim inside for evening service. There is a bar area in the front when you walk in. Walk past them and you will turn to other \\"rooms\\" for dining tables. When busy, you will walk through a bunch of people near the entrance with a drink as they wait for their tables. So if you don't mind doing that, go ahead and come. Otherwise, MAKE RESERVATIONS!\\n\\nFood: Absolutely delicious. Menu items all fit on one large page. Sectioned off by appetizers, main entrees, land/sea items. Too many to try so we tapa styled it and ordered a bunch of items to share. Some of my favorites:\\n- Mac and Cheese\\n- Rack of Lamb\\n- Pineapple Fried Rice\\nBut the highlight of the night was definitely the desserts. PLEASE make room for dessert and you have to try their Chocolate covered fuji apple. I'm doing a horrible job repeating the actual item but it is AMAZING. I'm drooling now thinking about it. We tried some of their cake slices which were amazing too - none of them were too overpoweringly sweet. Unique flavors. But yes. Ask for the chocolate covered fuji apple. Don't worry. In the displays, it'll have the whole apple. But when they bring it out, they slice it up for you to easily share among your table. It's a tasty dessert where you don't feel guilty eating it. It tastes fresh and healthy so you just want to keep eating it.\\n\\nService: Bravo! On our first time, we were met with prompt friendly service from multiple servers. We were treated to a complimentary basil roll appetizer as we wait and ended the night with a shot of rum for the table! Talk about knowing how to treat your customers. Definitely kicked it up a notch on having an enjoyable experience and will definitely come back. Ask the servers to point out who Calvin is.

On the \\"main\\" wall of the dining room, there is a gigantic painting of a girl surrounded by a pack of wild animals; the other enormous walls feature rows and rows of flickering lanterns.  Even with all the accent lighting, however, the space as a whole is fairly dark and the tables necessitate individual candles in order to illuminate the menus.  Also, because of the setup, it is quite noisy, particularly in the center of the restaurant.  In the bar, a live blues band was playing, as it does every Tuesday through Saturday night.

For appetizers, we shared the oxtail empanadas with roasted garlic aioli ($10) and the sweet and spicy calamari with basil and cilantro ($10).  The empanadas had a very healthy helping of queso on top, which, when combined with the aioli, greatly overpowered the dish.  However, when I scraped off the excess toppings and got a bite of just oxtail and pastry, the flavors really sang-the meat was insanely tender from braising and incredibly well-seasoned.  The calamari was fried perfectly-not chewy, not greasy, just crispy and tender-and the chili glaze delivered the as-promised one-two punch of sweet and spicy.  I could have used a little more cilantro to cool things down, but overall, I thought it was delicious.\\n\\nEntree-wise, BF opted for the bronzed scallops with gouda grits and smoked tomato broth ($20).  He said they were quite possibly the best scallops he's ever had-very high praise!  I'm not sure I agree that they were superlative, but they were nicely cooked (bordering on underdone, which is how I like them) and subtly seasoned.  The accompanying grits and broth were very tasty as well.  I opted for the braised pork with baked cheddar macaroni and pork jus ($19).  Let me just get this out of the way: that macaroni and cheese may have been the best I've ever had.  Ever.  Served in a mini cast-iron pot, the cheddar cheese on top was perfectly browned and just a tad crunchy, and the macaroni underneath was rich, creamy, tangy deliciousness.  The waiter said that the secret was bechamel sauce.  Drooooooool.  The pork was a HUGE portion, and it was definitely well-braised (it fell off the bone), but it was waaaaaay too heavy on the fennel, which surprised me all the more because the menu didn't mention it as a component of the dish.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered port, coffee, and the chocolate mousse rice crispy treat with chocolate malt ice cream ($7).  The mousse was light in both flavor and texture, and the \\"rice crispy treat\\" bottom was delicately crunchy.  I didn't get a lot of malt flavor from the ice cream, but BF really liked it.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, in addition to our bill (which came out to $187, without tip), we were presented with a $25 gift certificate to Trois and STATS.  I thought it was a nice gesture, and VERY smart-in this economy, even popular restaurants need to make extra efforts to encourage diners to eat out.  Service was very good, and the experience as a whole went much more smoothly than I was expecting (since it's such a \\"see and be seen\\" place, I anticipated more waiting and certainly more aloofness).\\n\\nIn sum, though the kitchen could use a lighter hand with certain seasonings, and though the atmosphere is more clubhound than chowhound, I am thrilled to have TWO urban licks right in my backyard."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite pizza place ever!

On the night of my dine, they'd been open exactly a month, but really have a good thing going already.  I ordered the calamari appetizer, which had great texture and was not too heavy.
