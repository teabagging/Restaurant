Don't care about the hype, it's about the food.  I will certainly give this place a 2nd try but my first experience was a total Meh!  Generally when I walk into a Q joint the first clue that tells you you're there is the smell of smoke and/or odor of smoking meats.  There was none, not a whiff.  4:45pm, just at pre-rush on a Saturday afternoon.  Strange.  I looked behind the counter to see that the kitchen you do see is for finishing/building your plates.  The real cooking/smoking must take place behind that.  I did see a smoker out back that was completely disconnected from the building.  Too bad.  I like spice/heat so I ordered the Crisp Pork Belly Banh Mi which shows a \\"fire\\" image next to the name indicating it's hot/spicy?  It was neither unless you count the 3 slices of japaleno like \\"fresno\\" on top as the heat/spice ingredient that are actually the milder version of the jalapeno look alike pepper. The lucky dragon sauce did not live up to the name.  The belly wasn't crispy.  Also had the Korean Kimcheeze Taco which had chunks of chicken melted in a blob of pepper jack.  Spicy kimchi and pickled onions both missed the flavor bus and had zero heat and marginal flavor of any kind.  The table we sat at (and actually all tables I noticed) were devoid of any sauces or even salt and pepper to customize/perk up the flavor.   My two dining companions ordered the half chicken and the other the 1/2 rack of ribs.  Didn't taste the chicken.  The ribs were cooked just right and had a little pull left on the bone but was strangely devoid of any smoky flavor.  Tasted like oven baked to me.  Sauce was good but nothing special/memorable.  \\nFor me, the \\"Barbakoa\\" latin style cooking was a miss for the dishes I tried.  The adventuresome and creative dishes described on the menu got me there to try it, but for me, the flavors fell short. My 2nd and (maybe) last trip I'll hope for the best and just stick to traditional Plane Jane Barbakoa basics and hope for some good smoky barbeque pulled pork and brisket...and maybe a Butter Chicken Taco; my last gasp grasp for some spicy inspiration."},{"name":"Mr Everything Cafe","address":"899 Martin Luther King Jr Dr","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Enjoyed the food!

If you ask to have it cooked differently (in my case, medium), they'll gladly put that in the order, but it will come out 1/2 the time cooked medium, and 1/2 the time very well done.    When the burgers are not burnt, they are pretty good.  The bread is excellent, as are the sweet potato fries.  We typically eat here, then Amy's next door, then let our kid play in the playground.

Sometimes there is live music. \\n - GREAT wine selection. Often nice wines to try that are open on the pour list. Wonderful pours that won't break the bank.  \\n - Nice selection of nosh-ables.

It adds up in this place if you are looking at multiple items like Appetizer, Main, some rice and vegetables. Two people: 2 beverages, 2 mains (main is ~18$). Shared appetizer and veggies.

Which is strange because it is not my favorite place to go for Chinese... I AM more of a House of Chang or Changsho... Or a late drunk night at Hong Kong or P.F. Changs at it's best...\\n\\nBut let me tell you about Red House... \\n\\nMy family and I have been coming here, literally since they opened... We have seen all of their transitions from good to bad...\\n\\nIt was an every Friday night affair as we watched Dallas (the Original).\\n\\nAwesome points:\\n\\nOpen kitchen:  As a young girl I was mesmerized at how fast they would chop the pork strips and spareribs and bag everything up... If you have time go and watch, it's so fun! Even now as an adult, I get nostalgic!\\n\\nThe food is ALWAYS fresh!!!\\n\\nIf you are looking for gourmet dishes with layers of bursting flavor, don't come here...\\n\\nIf you are looking for something decent to quench your Chinese food craving... You are safe here!\\n\\nI AM a crab Rangoon fanatic and have a love hate relationship with theirs... The inside is fresh and creamy though it's lacking real crab meat or stellar additions like little scallions for texture and flavor... But it is passable and even addictive especially when drunk or really, really hungry... \\n\\nBut here is where I lose respect for the crab rangoon:  The crust!  The texture surrounding the filling is fine... But it's the part where it is nothing but dough... It's way to crispy and not the kind of crispy that melts in your mouth and makes you say \\"ahhh\\", it's the kind of crispy that has you chewing for awhile, leaving you curious why they chose to use that particular wonton... And if they would change it if you mentioned it to them...Hmm... So eat it while it's hot and fresh!!!  The filling is good cold the next day...\\n\\nOk... I think that is my biggest pet peeve about this place...\\n\\nBoneless spareribs are on point... Just enough bbq char and fatty grissel to be good with just enough of the pink stuff to add a slight aso flavor and color.\\n\\nFried rice is decent... I like the shrimp fried rice because it has bean sprouts, onions and a slightly darker sauce - shrimps are cooked fresh and not dried out.\\n\\nChicken wings are not the best, but if you get them cooked extra crispy they taste better.\\n\\nEgg roll is plump, with lots of delicious egg roll filling... It's perfect for dipping in duck sauce!\\n\\nEgg foo young is really fresh and when hot it's great even without the gravy!\\n\\nFried shrimp is fresh and butterflied I think... It's good even if you don't like a lot of dough, you can take that part off but it is tasty...\\n\\nLo mein, beef and broccoli, chow mein, chop suey, scallion pancakes are all yes's... Anything else, I cannot approve... Only because I haven't tried it and not sure I would.  \\n\\nStuff like general gao's or orange chicken? Well, I would save that for a gourmet place!\\n\\nNow what gives them the 4 stars???\\n\\nCustomer Service!!!\\n\\nThey know my mother's order and her name! They always provide fast delivery, never more than an hour on a busy night...\\n\\nAnd they always give us something for free, a crab Rangoon, a fried shrimp, a fried rice, etc.\\n\\nTalk bad all you want, but if you are loyal to them... They honor you and it is for THAT reason alone that I bothered to write this review.\\n\\nIt is not too often that companies go out of their way for you anymore and when they do, they should be recognized and defended against the crowd of negativity.\\n\\nRed House is definitely NOT the BEST chinese food out there.\\n\\nIt's not my first Choice or even my second... (sorry guys, I still love you!!!)\\n\\nBut they do have good, ALWAYS FRESH food and GOOD people!  If they seem blah, it's probably because they don't know if you are another d*ckwad that will give them the 2 star attitude... So they may have thick skin...\\n\\nBut if on the rare occasion something misfires... They will make it right!!!\\n\\nBut be nice!!!  Just because I said so!

You will thank me if you do this, because I can almost guarantee that on any given weekend you'll be waiting a good while for a table if you arrive any time later than that.\\n\\nOnce seated in the casual, open dining space, you will be graciously greeted with hot Stumptown coffee. This will more than make up for your early start to the day. The waitstaff suggests that your table order several small and large plates to share, as it is somewhat a \\"tapas-style\\" breakfast. This would work if everyone at your table had similar tastes and dietary preferences, but if that isn't the case it is just fine to order your own plates.\\n\\nI relished everything I tried, including a chocolate doughnut hole, a plate of steamed spinach with eggs over-easy, the biscuits with blueberries and whipped cream and the potatoes bravas, which is a breakfast skillet. It was all good, although an itty-bitty caveat would simply be that I would've preferred the biscuits to be bigger and fluffier instead of the tiny discs that arrived on my plate.\\n\\nI don't know if Tasy n Sons will be on my regular rotation of favorite breakfast restaurants, simply because of the prices (which aren't bad, just not exactly cheap) and the limitation of vegetarian plates.

First of all, our dishes came out cold and missing key ingredients (notably, cranberry sauce). I hate sending food back. Usually I just let minor issues/mistakes slide, but in this instance, the initial bites of cold food tasted really terrible - I simply couldn't eat any more of it. I asked the server, were the turkey and mashed potatoes actually supposed to be cold? Our server was apologetic - he said no, definitely not! He promised to bring us new plates of hot food. \\n\\nThe plates that came back soon after were hot, but clearly not new - messy mashed potatoes (originally: in a scooped ball) & overcooked veggies (simply reheated, I guess). I felt so bad to bother our kind server again, but we definitely didn't want to eat overcooked reheated food! At this point, our server was feeling very sorry for all the kitchen faux pas, so he actually waited there and made sure to grab 2 freshly prepared turkey dinner plates for us. \\n\\nThe food that arrived the 3rd and final time was hot and palatable. \\n\\nTaste-wise, the turkey meat was rough and the veggies were bland. The mashed potatoes were decent though. The French Onion soup appetizer we had at the beginning was reasonably tasty. \\n\\nI wanted to give this place a 1-star, but the good service deserves an additional star.

In the interest of disclosure, I got a nice email from Kings management about the problems with their pinsetters.  The person said it may have been related to the new pins that they had recently received.  I appreciated the note, as it shows that they aware of the problem.\\n\\nHowever, and it pains me to say this, the machines just don't work.  I don't think it has to do with new pins this time.  Common problems include:\\n\\n1.  Bowling balls not returning once rolled.  They usually get jammed in the pit behind the pins.\\n\\n2.  Pins falling over on a reset.  This happens pretty frequently, and something must be loose to cause this to happen.\\n\\n3.  Pins missing on a full rack reset.  This usually means that the pin distributor missed a spot.\\n\\nThe bottom line is, I don't know what, if any, preventive maintenance is being done.  It seems like the problems have become more frequent over the past couple of years.  Since the pinspotters are pretty much the most important piece of capital equipment in a bowling center, it goes without saying that keeping them going is the most important thing one can do.  Yes, it's expensive, but it's less expensive than not turning lanes over quickly when bowlers spend more time than necessary bowling because of machine problems.  \\n\\nA common thread in these reviews is \\"long waits for lanes\\" and \\"machine problems\\".  These problems are directly related to each other.  If they haven't already, I would recommend that Kings either a) bring in someone who can lay out a consistent preventive maintenance program or b) replace the machines altogether with something more reliable.  Perhaps if they can turn the lanes over more quickly, they won't have such long waits on weekend nights.\\n\\nOther than that, I still give Kings three stars because they have a lot of other good things going for them.  They have Photo Hunt in the bar, plenty of pool tables, some fun video games (including Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga), and pretty good food.  I recommend the pulled pork sliders and the buffalo shrimp appetizer.  And, their beer selection and prices are reasonable, too.\\n\\nJudging by how many people flood this place most nights, there's clearly a demand for this kind of entertainment.  I think that if Kings can work out the problems it has with its machines, then it will satisfy more customers and bring in even more business than it already has."},{"name":"The Manchester Arms","address":"1705 Virginia Ave","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"This will forever be my favorite place in Atlanta.

I recommend the bean benedict, which is pretty delicious.\\n\\nHonestly though, the best part of coming here was our very expressive and charming server,  Lee? Leigh?, explaining all about the different tequilas and being generally sweet and helpful. She provided quick service and great tips, even pointing out where certain menu items needed \\"tweaking\\" but steering us towards better or more popular choices. That's really kind of going above and beyond, I think... She's been our server a few times and it's definitely a better experience when she comes by.

I had such high hopes for its hidden paradise potential.  Sadly, though, the restaurant let me down in nearly all aspects.\\n\\nAt 7 PM (on a Sunday night), we were only the second table in the place.  That's a BAD sign.  We ordered calamari to start, which is usually a pretty safe bet.  Unfortunately, while the flavor was okay, this squid was the most rubbery I've had in a long time.  For entrees, my BF opted for the gnocchi (with sun-dried tomatoes and other veggies I can't recall) and I chose the mushroom ravioli.  The gnocchi was actually decent--not the lightest and fluffiest I've ever tasted, but tender and with a pretty good balance of flavors.  My ravioli, on the other hand, was atrocious.  The homemade pasta that was touted on the menu was flavorless and tough, and the mushroom (I presume) filling was bland and under salted.  There were a lot of mushrooms on top of the pasta, but I could not taste them because the entire dish was DROWNING in olive oil and LOADED with garlic.  Don't get me wrong, I like olive oil and garlic.  I like them in significant quantities.  But if you're going to advertise mushroom ravioli, you should deliver at least a little bit of a mushroom flavor.  I was starving, so I ate about half the dish, but then I just couldn't take any more.\\n\\nNormally, after such a disappointing entree, I would have skipped dessert and stopped for ice cream on the way home.  Since we were with guests, though, and I was still hungry, I decided to check out the sweet side of the menu and see if the evening could be saved.  I ordered cannoli, and someone else at the table opted for tiramisu.  I tasted the latter, and it was actually okay (though a bit heavy on the coffee flavor).  The cannoli shell was a touch stale (or overcooked, one), but it was fairly respectable.  The filling (I can't remember whether it was ricotta or mascarpone, but my bet is on mascarpone) was actually very sweet and creamy.  My big complaint was that it was SWIMMING in what tasted like Hershey's syrup.  I tried to avoid the chocolate as much as possible, but it was covering a large portion of the cannoli-to the cannoli's detriment.\\n\\nService was...interesting, at best.  The waiter started out merely being attentive, but since the restaurant was so darn empty, his attentiveness turned into hovering, and his hovering included butting into conversations and telling cheesy and/or inappropriate jokes.  Our bill for four came to about $120, which seemed exorbitant for what we received (even though, to be fair, it included a couple of glasses of wine).

Even though the food took time especially for others sitting near me, it was well worth the wait. Unfortunately, I wasn't very hungry so I went to my go to item, Cobb Salad. Their rendition of this classic dish was like a Cobb Caesar. Romaine lettuce, Creamy dressing, light blue, tomato, onion, olive and two strips of bacon. I really liked how they stood different from the ordinary and salad was very nice. I also had their potato doughnut hole with white sauce. For only $1.50 I had dos. Really nice and fine ending to my lunch. \\n\\nI believe what gets people excited about this place is their atmosphere and decor. It seems rustic but not old.

The flavours are so interesting and the texture is smooth and creamy. I'm a huge chocolate gal, so the unique flavour combinations here are one of few things that can get me to stray from my normal chocolate obsession. On a prior trip here I had the pear with blue cheese. It was good and I liked it of course, but the pear was a little milder than I had expected. \\n\\nHowever, this trip I hit the jackpot with honey lavender! I had a few that I had planned to sample, including the olive oil, but as soon as I tried the small spoonful of honey lavender that was it for me. It was AMAZING and yes, that deserves to be written in all caps. I love the way lavender smells and it tastes exactly the same, which is a little weird and cool to be able to taste something that you're used to just smelling. It was the perfect balance with the sweetness of the honey and neither was too over powering. Try the honey lavender, you will not regret it. The only problem with tasting something so awesome for me is that it will be hard to not continue getting it every time that I go back and try something new instead.

My girlfriend (who is gluten free) and I, literally just received our food from this restaurant and I deemed it necessary to immediately write a review. \\n\\nSince my girlfriend is gluten free we are constantly looking for places that have gluten free options, so when we saw this restaurant it seemed fantastic. \\n\\nLong story short, the experience was less than satisfying. We place our order with a woman who works there and she was quite friendly. I had to explain to her where Allston St. was, sure, but so far so good. \\n\\nAfter about an hour and fifteen minutes passed and we still didn't have our food we decided that it would be a good idea to call to make sure nothing had gone wrong. \\n\\nWe called and the woman explained that the delivery person had tried to call several times, but claimed that it kept going to voice mail. I then called my girlfriend's phone to see if this was indeed the case. It was not. They did not copy down my girlfriend's number correctly. When we called a third time, to ensure that they had the right number (which they did not), the woman became defensive saying that they had tried to call several times. We were not being aggressive (which perhaps we should have been given that we ordered our food over 2 hours ago) and therefore was no need to be defensive we, just wanted to ensure that they had the correct number, which as previously established they did not. \\n\\nWhen the food finally did arrive here, it was ice cold, which was expected at some degree, but disappointing none the less. The food was mediocre, and certainly not worth the hassle we went through. \\n\\nNo discount was offered, or no action was taken to make the situation right. \\n\\nI would not recommend this place to a single soul.

I always go to this area to go to sapporo but after seeing the signs that it was under new management and specializing in udon noodles, it peaked my curiosity and made me want to try it.\\n\\nSo I got the regular udon, I got tempura flakes and tempura shrimp in it.  Broth was flavorful and came out nice and hot.  The noodles themselves were a good size and chewy.  The portion was really good and I was pretty stuffed.  Quite honestly, exactly what you'd expect when you get a good bowl of udon noodle soup.  Maybe it was the combination of the freezing day that made me especially like this.  \\n\\nMy friend got the curry udon and I wish I had gotten her bowl.  The broth is a little thicker but has a nice Japanese curry flavor to it.   Came with carrots in the broth and pieces of chicken.  The chicken was cooked really well and complimented the dish nicely.  \\n\\nWith a lot of Japanese restaurants, when you get the udon you can tell that it's some preserved brick that they cook and just add veggies and broth to it.  Definitely not the case here.  For the price and portion that they give you, I'd say this is a good place to go if you want a break from ramen.

The portions were not large, but they were large on flavor. \\n\\nBurmese Red Pork Stew ($15) - comes on top of a bed of rice with two types of eggs, a diced picked egg, and one egg sunny side up. This is delicious Asian comfort food with great flavor in the red pork stew. \\n\\nChicken Fried Pork Cutlets ($14) - southern deliciousness! The pork cutlets are served with a tasty biscuit, venison gravy, and over easy egg. The fried pork cutlets were crispy and flavorful, and was perfect with the gravy, biscuit, and soft egg. This dish is hearty and delicious! \\n\\nTasty Steak and Cheddar Eggs ($16) - perfectly tender and tasty steak with scrambled eggs topped with cheddar cheese. What makes this dish extra delicious is the cornmeal pancake with jalape√±o butter. Great combination of flavor making this an excellent order. \\n\\nErin's Sweet Biscuits ($6) - these biscuits were perfect in flavor, fluffiness, and texture. They are mini-sized, yet a great compliment to the meal. These sweet biscuits are served with farm fresh jam and whipped cream.

And a great precursor to the rest of my meal. The North African Sausage an egg on top with couscous & cauliflower is what I ordered. I had to slow down eating it, it tasted so good. My fat-and-meat-free friend ordered the Cast Iron Frittata with fava beans, olives, confit green beans, caramelized onions & feta, except she got it with egg whites and no cheese (I know, who would do that?!). There was a bit of a fight with the chef, who didn't want to ruin is masterpiece with egg whites. It a frittata, for christ's sake, you need the yolks!! But they accommodated and she LOVED it.

It's lukewarm - is it supposed to be served warm normally? \\"How is it?\\" my boyfriend asks. \\"It would be better if I had a plate to eat it on,\\" I respond, gesturing to the empty table. \\n7:55 PM: My boyfriend finishes his beer. Waitress brings a new one. It's not the right beer. \\n8:05 PM: We begin wondering where our appetizer is. Or where our waitress is, for that matter. It's busy tonight, maybe the kitchen is backed up. It would be nice if she would just come over and let us know about something like that. \\n8:10 PM: We are both starving, and there are a ton of restaurants in the area. We debate whether we should leave or not...\\n\\n...which leads to the final five minutes of our visit, which killed the entire evening for us. \\n\\nAround 8:10, my boyfriend gets up and goes to the host, who turns out to be a manager. My boyfriend explains that we had been here for nearly an hour and nothing was coming out of the kitchen, nor was the waitress giving us any update. The manager apologizes and says he will fix this for us. We both feel satisfied with this, but then suddenly, like a minute later, our waitress comes to our table, and these are literally the first words out of her mouth:\\n\\n\\"My manager said you were upset with me.\\" \\n\\nNow the environment has turned from one of apathy to one of hostility. No apology, no explanation, just someone who was pissed. There was no way we were going to enjoy the evening from here on. The manager showed up with our crabcakes, but I felt horrible inside and this was not how I wanted to spend our anniversary. I said that I wanted to leave, and I was willing to pay for the drinks, but we weren't staying here. I asked for the check, and the waitress got very angry and snapped at me: \\"I already put your order in!!\\" I said again that we weren't going to eat here, and she turned to her manager and repeated, \\"What am I supposed do? I already put their order in!!\\" The manager said, \\"I know,\\" and processed our check for drinks only (the manager was fine, I have no complaints with him), my boyfriend paid promptly and then we were out of there, never to return.

We also had the eggs benedict, with a delicious roasted tomato hollandaise and crabmeat, served with homefries in a small cast iron skillet, that were somewhat reminiscent of tomatoes obrien, as there were small diced red peppers and onion. Delightful in preparation, all the flavors were great, and the richness made it more than filling. We also ordered the evoo omelette, which for the pix fixe course seemed mundane, but it was not. The tomato bacon jam that acccompanied the spinach gruyere omelette burst with tangy sweet smoky flavor that made the dish...The desert we shared and was memorable and highly recommended, the chocolate salted ganache cake, amazingly creamy, carmel like interior, served with whip cream, pomegranate seeds, and a blood orange sauce, perfect contrast off sweet, sour, salty.Rarely have had a better flavored or executed desert...The prix fixe brunch was $33 for 2 course, $39 for 3 course, yes pricey, but a great mood lifter for any friend or family member in need of a special meal or attention, and combined with a visit to the MFA beforehand, it is a perfect weekend or weekday outing.

I think my husband is about ready to jam my phone with above-said Yelp app. down my throat.  But I digress . . .\\n\\nHaving the Yelp app. means that I Yelp everywhere, even in suburbs of Boston where restaurants, I have come to realise, seem to be held to less of a standard than places in the city.  My general rule is no eating at locations with less than 3 stars so I was tickled to find a breakfast place with three-plus stars in Reading.\\n\\nWe arrived immediately upon opening.  The inside was clean and the server was very friendly - hence the 2 stars.  I think they must have been having a \\"Bald Father's w/ Hoodies take your Daughters to Breakfast Convention that day.\\"  I swear, every other table had a bald guy with a hooded sweatshirt and a little girl.  This is neither good nor bad but slightly odd in a Twilight Zone episode kind-of-way.  I know, I know . . . I'm digressing again . . . \\n\\nI was delighted to see that they had Potato Pancakes on the menu - one of my all-time favorites!  My husband ordered his usual, Eggs Benedict and we both ordered coffee. God was the coffee awful.  I mean really awful.  The kind of awful that you think one couldn't really achieve unless they were trying for awful!! After one sip I should have known things couldn't turn out well.  Starting out breakfast with a bad cup of coffee spells doom for the meal the way an awful kiss might doom a one-night-stand.  No, I am not speaking from experience, I'm just saying . . .\\n\\nThen the meal comes.  Now I don't really know where to start.  Hell, let's just go for the obvious first.  Eggs Benedict is not a dish to be entered into lightly.  If an establishment  hopes to succeed with this dish they must have 1) someone who knows how to poach an egg and 2) SOMEONE IN THE KITCHEN NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT CONSTITUTES HOLLANDAISE SAUCE!!!!  Here are a few tips to help people identify a real hollandaise sauce versus the shameless imposters.  \\n\\n1) Hollandaise sauce was originally created by French chefs - therefore it should never be created from a packet, a jar, a bottle, etc.  \\n\\n2) Hollandaise sauces is an emulsion, which means that the egg yolk and butter should be combined seamlessly.  Chunky, seperated slop is not allowed.\\n\\n3) Hollandaise sauce is made from butter and egg yolks and should be thick and creamy.  It should never be, as was the case in this establishment, translucent.  Egg yolks and butter clog your ateries because they are dense and thick and rich not watery and translucent!\\n\\nThe Eggs Benedict was a sad, sad state of affairs.  But wait, let us not forget my potato pancakes.  When the waitress placed the dish on the table I could hear generations of long-passed Jewish grandmothers sobbing.  These were not potato pancakes, they were frozen, bite-sized, breaded potato-esque squares, deep fried a la McDonalds Hash Browns, which are actually better because at least they have little flakes in them that bring to mind real potatoes.   And to add insult to injury, they served my side of sour cream in a little plastic to-go container with a lid on it.  Maybe I'm neurotic, but I happen to think that to-go containers should be restricted to orders that are to-go.  I'm a purist that way.\\n\\nSo to summarize, was Christopher's worthy of their 3+ star rating on Yelp??  Not unless you came just to chat with a personable waitress or if you're a bald-guy with a hoodie and little girl."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great outdoor beer garden vibe.

The grounds are awesome.  They have spent a lot of time and effort trying to become a traditional farmhouse brewery and also make \\"sour\\" and \\"funky\\" beers in the likes of Cantillon or 3F.  For the brewery itself, they have the location and feel right.  A gorgeous spot in Texas hill country.  Driving up the road, you are pretty much driving through a cow pasture.  Now there is a little pizza place near by that can sell their beers to go.  That is one way to get around TABC.\\n\\nAnyway, $10 entry fee for the tour and tasting.  They will give you a taste of each offering they have at the time.  All fine and good, though why only three stars?  Well, their beers never lives up to my expectations.  For one, their three original beers Commercial Suicide, Wytchmaker, and Black Metal were great when first released.  Though once they decided to change everything to a \\"farmhouse\\" yeast strain, all of those sucked.  The good English yeast strain used for all those three was perfect for the type of beer.  Farmhouse Commercial Suicide I think is one of the worst beers anywhere (Farmhous yeast and English mild, no thanks, just a mess).  Then their newer stuff, which is a never ending list of different funky saisons or other slightly more sour offerings.  Which are styles I love, they just always fall short for me.  Most of their offerings are so incredibly thin as well, Buddha's Brew, Drink'in The Sunbelt, Bonnie the Rare are all paper thin in body.  The last is a sorry attempt at a Berliner Weissbier, which is one of my favorite styles, and hardly anybody makes this in the States (Einhorn from Austin Beer Works puts this one to shame).  They will also have special guest taps often, and sometimes those are very impressive.  \\n\\nAnyway, not to put to fine a point here.  I like the grounds, a great place for a relaxing Saturday.  When they do special events this place gets packed.  They will have food trucks during events as well.

I originally planned to just get a take-out order, but Tasty 'n Sons does not do such orders (you'll have to dine in first, then you could take food to go after that). Luckily, because I dined alone, I managed to get a seat at the counter.\\n\\nThe place is set up so that you can see the line cooks hard at work filling every order. They make great use of their space, with a row of tables lined deep into the cavernous restaurant.\\n\\nThe menu touches on cuisines from all over the world, and I wanted to try something new today. I ordered their Polenta and Sausage Ragu ($8): a creamy blend of polenta and sausage ragu gets topped with a melted slice of mozzarella cheese and a fried, overeasy egg.\\n\\nCutting into that egg released the silky yolk on the polenta, ragu, and gooey cheese. I then embarked on a life-or-death struggle with the cheese for the next seven minutes. I loved the creaminess of the polenta and the savory sausage. If I had an Italian grandmother, this is probably what I would want her to cook multiple times a week. Such a simple meal, but amazing flavor. Despite being a \\"bigger plate\\" item, the portion was still very small for $8, basically a large appetizer for me.\\n\\nWhile the flavors were unforgettable, I would have liked more textural contrast in the dish. More sausage, something crunchy, anything to break up the smooth sensations in my mouth. Perhaps the dish's strength of simplicity was also its weakness. I also wish I could get take-out orders and larger portions from Tasty 'n Sons. All in all, it was a very positive first experience, and I look forward to coming back."},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've only been to Swifts for brunch and I do enjoy their eggs Benedict.

They have the tour, which includes a visit to the hallowed ground that is their barrel room, where beer is introduced to various yeast and bacteria strains to become extraordinary and delicious.  And it also (duh) includes the beer - 3 samples, which can be full pints if you pay for a pint glass.  They usually have robust lineup of their beer on offer, generally have a cask or gravity keg on hand, AND usually have a \\"guest\\" beer that is not available anywhere else in town.

The dressing with the cheese was extremely bitter and made it hard for me to finish to the salad. If you're a fan of bitter cheeses maybe it'll be fine.

As she placed a large bowl of it on the table, she said we are all good, since we were ordering drinks during happy hour it would be free--but otherwise we would have to get it from the nacho car in the bar area. We thanked her and understood that the queso was at no cost.\\n\\nWe continued to enjoy the chips and dips along with our beverages, and Mimi checked in with us periodically to see if there was anything else we needed. As we continued to order beverages and gorge on the chips, Mimi began to question our sobriety. We joked with her and said we were fine, as we downed our water at the same time we consumed our margaritas and beer.\\n\\nWhen it came time to order the food, she asked how our checks would be separated and asked who would cover the cost of the queso. We looked at her blankly and reminded her of our conversation we had earlier. Mimi then told us that it was only if we got it ourselves from the nacho car. We explained how we understood it in our conversation earlier, and she simply shrugged and said she had ordered it so it would be on the tab.\\n\\nOur food was delicious, but when it came time to prepare the checks, Mimi was confused as to who had what drinks. We very clearly explained this to her and she brought out the checks. When she did, the queso was charged, and we were also charged for an additional margarita that had not been ordered, brought to the table, or consumed. When we told her that amongst our group of four we had consumed only 5 margaritas and not six, she again simply shrugged her shoulders, told us she had ordered it, and it had been brought to the table. We again explained the number of drinks that each person had ordered, and she said she had to get her manager.\\n\\nWe waited more than five minutes and her manager came out and asked what's going on. We explained the misunderstanding with the extra margarita and the manager immediately became defensive. She claimed that if the item was on the tab, it had been ordered and made its way to the table. Otherwise, she said, it would not be on the tab. We then explained the queso situation to her to further explain the confusions, which she ignored. She then continued to say that there's really no way for her to remove the amount without having to charge the credit card a separate time and void the additional charge. She said she would make this a one time accommodation but that would be it. She was extremely patronizing, and not once did she apologize for the miscommunication or inconvenience, nor did she provide her name.\\n\\nAnother 5 minutes past and she brought the updated check--again did not apologize but instead repeated that she didn't understand how this happened when a drink is only placed on a check if it is ordered and brought to the table. I asked her to end re conversation as she continued to berate and insult us.\\n\\nHorrendous customer service--a great reason to not visit this location again."},{"name":"Phil's Icehouse","address":"13265 US Hwy 183 N","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is a new favorite for us in Austin.

After picking it up and then getting back home, I discovered that they took my order to signify \\"a veggie burger without cheese... with nothing else on the burger either\\" despite the fact that the menu specifically indicates that veggie burgers come with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles. I figured I'd let it slide that one time-- maybe it was just a miscommunication due to the nature of the phone call.\\n\\nThe second time, however, was even worse. I placed my order in person for the same veggie burger without cheese. The girl at the counter quickly noted that veggie burgers never come with cheese, so I politely pointed to the menu behind her, which does in fact include cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles. She acknowledged her mistake and processed my order. Once I got back to the office to eat my lunch, I discovered that once again my order was messed up. I don't know who pays $6 for a veggie burger expecting a plain patty on a bun, but I certainly do not. You would think that order would've sounded strange to her, and that she would've asked if I truly wanted zero toppings on my burger. It was not worth the long walk back to Lee's to show them the mistake, so I ate my pathetic bun, patty, and ketchup anyway.\\n\\nDear Lee's: if your menu specifies a list of included toppings on an item, please don't omit every single topping if a customer requests that just one of them be left off. Or, please don't assume that people don't want any toppings unless they explicitly list them; if the menu literally says, \\"with [x], [y], and [z]\\" under an item, I want (and expect) x, y, and z on my burger.

Crust is both chewy and crisp. A nice in-between re Neapolitan and true NYC. Ingredients are fresh and flavorful.  Parking is easy for those who drive; easy to access the garage and free for two hours.  The space is light and inviting. Now, the downside:  the service concept needs serious attention.  On entering one waits to order in line as most folks undergo a first-timers orientation.  Takes too long.  Then, no server is really assigned to your table; at least not discernibly so.  Ordered a pizza and two beers as we walked in.  Took 15 minutes before the beers showed up.  Pizza took 45 minutes.  No one visited our table or asked how we were doing or if we needed anything.  Many in the restaurant were observed up and wandering for somebody to get them something or provide them some update on their order.  Felt stranded.  We have no problem flagging down a server as needed most of the time, but flagging down seemed the only way to get any attention from the staff.  Overheard at least three conversations where wait staff was apologizing to diners over something.  Been twice.

Holy Taco's name gives so much promise, and I think that fish tacos are divine -- and the drinks help to bridge the gaps for the rest.\\n\\nThe temperature, sunny in the 70s, was made for Holy Taco's patio. It is one of the best in the City. The only drawback, and it's small, is that it fronts Glenwood Avenue. While that does make for some cool people watching, tattoos and piercings are the norm not the exception, the car traffic can be a little loud. (Although in fairness, the loudest was a patron leaving on his motorcycle.)\\n\\nWe had a caprininha and margarita. Both were pretty good. The caipriniha could do with whatever other places serve, but I thought it was good nonetheless. I really like the freshness of the organic margarita.\\n\\nAgain, I try my \\"holy\\" trinity of tacos to compare: Carne Asada, Lengua and Fish. There was no carne asada here, but they had ground beef. It was horrific. The acidity of the tomato base combined with the ground beef was much, much too sour. I'd recommend folks avoid that one. The fish taco was excellent. It's not what you'd expect. It has a lot of very fruity, for lack of a better word, peppers inside. Nice crunch and a good taste. \\n\\nOddly enough, the lengua taco -- simply called tongue --  is the most like you've probably had somewhere else. I thought the lengua was decent and the toppings pretty good.  \\n\\nAs for the corn tortillas, I've determined that apparently there is no place in Atlanta that has good access to the ones in SoCal. Holy Taco wraps their tacos in two corn tortillas -- although you have the option for flour -- and they are a little gummy.\\n\\nWhat is fairly impressive is the service. The folks are nice and I felt fairly responsive -- removing the ground beef taco without issue.\\n\\nSo if you're looking for a great patio, or a fairly decent offering of tacos and good drinks, East Atlanta's Holy Taco may be heaven sent.\\n\\nOverall, a pretty decent meal."},{"name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","address":"9810 NE Cascades Pkwy","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"Restaurants that do not have an updated Yelp profile should always get a one star.\\n\\nIf you are closed at 10:30 pm on Sundays, please for the love of God write that in.\\n\\nYou are an eatery next to an Airport, surrounded by hotels.

With that said, I was able to try some of their new menu items and found them to be really good.  The Singapore style stir-fry noodle and the salt/pepper squid was to die for.

As expected we were seated in the basement.  Upon arrival nice Mexican music was playing.  By 7:30 the remainder of the basement filled up with a large party of 40 and we noticed that the music had changed to club music,  It was so loud we were literally yelling at one another in our attempt to have conversation across the table.  We asked our waitress if it could be turned down.  It never was.  My party were 50+ years of age.  We were not impressed with how the music had changed and asked the waitress what happened to the nice Mexican music that was playing.  It was impossible to converse with anyone other than the person beside you or across the table.\\n\\nIt was as hot as the Sahara down there.  There was zero air conditioning and zero air movement.  At some point in the evening, a large fan was pointed in the direction of our table and we were thrilled to finally have some air movement.  However, it was short lived as the party of 40 took over the fan and pointed it towards their table.  We asked a man who appeared to be in charge of the basement (the manager perhaps?) how come the other table had a fan and we didn't.  His reply \\"they asked for it first\\".  What?  Had we known fans were an option of course we would've asked for one.  We only even knew they had a fan because obviously someone in that party of 40 was tired of it blowing on them and turned it in the direction of our table.\\n\\nThe dinners were served ... all except one dinner.  After most everyone was served we asked the waitress about the missing meal (the first person whose order was taken).  The waitress said it would be out in a couple of minutes.  15 minutes later and still no meal and the rest of the table was finished eating already.  When the meal was delivered the waitress said \\"I'll take care of it for you\\" which we inferred to mean the meal would be comped.  Well a while later the man in charge came by and said to the person whose meal came late that he wasn't allowed to comp a meal but he could give her a complimentary margarita.  My friend hadn't even planned to have a drink but felt that if she didn't take the drink, she would have to pay for her meal anyways so might as well get something to make up for the long awaited meal.\\n\\nLa Casita's website says that the birthday person eats for free.  We had two birthday cakes at our table so there should have been no mistaking that the occasion was to mark someones birthday (they do charge $1.50 per person plate charge).  When the bill came, the birthday person was charged for her meal.  By that point, it was 10:00 PM, the music was still blaring (despite the fact the entire group of 40 had already left the establishment), and we were dying of heat stroke so we just said to heck with making an issue about being charged for the birthday meal and the meal was paid for.\\n\\nEveryone at our table agreed the food was delicious, reasonably priced and tasty.  However, everyone also stated that it was way too hot down in the basement AND the club music was grossly inappropriate considering we arrived around 6:00 PM to enjoy a group dinner.  Being  we were dining over dinner we would never ever expect club music to be blaring.  It wasn't just loud, it was really inappropriate.\\n\\nFrom all my very many visits to La Casita and introducing many friends to the tasty Mexican food I was left extremely disappointed by the entire ambiance of the evening - what should have been a very pleasurable birthday celebration with engaging conversation was a letdown.\\n\\nI wrote an email of complaint to the manager.  I explained the entire evening as described above.  He said that if you reserve the entire basement you can play whatever music you choose and the fact the basement was split between two parties, the usual music selection should have been playing rather than the other group's selection (we had no clue that the club music was brought in by the group, not that it matters - it was inappropriate for the dinner hour).  He said that he had since gone out and bought many fans as it was unaffordable to install AC in a rental building (I agree).  The one answer I wasn't happy about was he said the birthday person must request their meal be complimentary.  What?  It doesn't say that on the La Casita website.  If it's obviously a birthday being celebrated do the right thing, keep your word as per your advertising, and comp the birthday person!    \\n\\nAll-in-all I was comped a $50 gift certificate for complaining so La Casita has redeemed themselves somewhat.  Still taking 2 stars away because the events made for a memorable 50th birthday celebration for all the wrong reasons."},{"name":"Chevys Fresh Mex","address":"12547 State Rd 535","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm a big fan of Chevy's and it has been my favorite for a decade and I've watched sadly as each location has shut it's doors.

Chili powder?  Chili oil?  Hot chili oil?  Curry sauce?  Curry powder?  Yeah - they got that.\\n\\nThere's also an entire section of shelving dedicated to instant noodles!  Conventional flavors like beef, chicken and shrimp meet more exotic variants such as satay and miso flavors.

The manager came over and we showed her the bloody red burger and she replied, \\"no that's defiantly medium rare, do you want it cooked more? We can certainly cook it more for you, perhaps you want medium?\\" as if we were the ones in the wrong!  Listen, I've worked in restaurants for 10 years and that burger was rare.

For the entr√©es, both the central burger and beef bourguignon were acceptable but disappointing, and needed some vigorous shaking of salt and pepper.

The baked alaska served as a nice dessert option that can be easily shared with 1-2 other diners.\\n\\nAside from the presentation and portion sizes, the prices of the dishes are better than expected, given the atmosphere.

They are good, just a little unexpected. One of our friends was not a fan, but the rest of us really enjoyed it. Crispy, puffy pork rinds with a dip of grits, black beans, tomatoes, pork and corn to put on top of the puff.

There is a $10 door fee and I also bought a coffee and a bakery item that I saved for later. Both tasted good, but this place really isn't about the refreshments. They give you a timer to alert you when your hour is up. Inside they have between 10 & 15 cats roaming around in what looks like cat paradise. A few are 'cafe cats' that take up residence there and the rest are up for adoption. Their collars are marked with green or yellow tags that tell you how friendly they are with the green cats coming right up to you for attention and the yellow cats taking time to warm up to an ear scratch. They have treats you can give them and a ton of toys and lasers to interact with them. There are plenty of tables and chairs and even a living room area with couches. They have supplies for coloring. They even have a fish tank and a large exercise wheel for the cats to enjoy along with plenty of scratching posts and climbing areas. It was a great relaxing hour spent and it was hard to leave without a cat even though I have three pets at home already.

I actually took a picture of the cocktail menu so I can recreate some of their drinks.\\n\\nOn this last visit, we had:\\n-Grilled peaches with cr√®me fraiche, thyme, and honey. This was delicious and really different from anything I'd ever had.

I could've eaten three of these. \\n-Grilled cauliflower- very tasty, spiced well, and cooked perfectly. And I don't even like cauliflower. \\n-Quail with curry cream sauce. Very yummy. I was glad that this was on the menu because it was most like the curry cream chicken they used to serve, which really hooked us on this restaurant.\\n-Korean BBQ flank steak with kimchi jumeok bap cake and sweet galbi sauce. This was my favorite. The bap cakes were starchy, sweet fried goodness. The meat was served very rare and was good in the galbi sauce, although it would've been nice to have a better quality cut of meat than flank.\\n-Popcorn and a movie dessert- butter popcorn ice cream, homemade peanut butter and chocolate candy bar, caramel corn, root beer gel. The butter popcorn was surprisingly delicious.

Meh.\\n\\nAll started well....nice atmosphere, cool spot on the east side, nice waiter, good salad (spinach), great drinks (try the margarita) and then the main dishes arrived. \\n\\nWhat we had:\\nthe gnocchi:\\nOK, I know gnocchi is made from potato but it shouldn't look like an actual potato. My gnocchi looked more like the fried potatoes you can get at any Austin breakfast joint. While they were prepared well, they were over-seasoned and resting upon a layer of sweet corn, crispy onion and barely there porcine mushrooms in a buttery oil.  Not to sound snobby, but when you've dined in Italy, it is really really hard to enjoy American Italian food. I feel like this is what it would taste like if you got this dish at Chili's - a bit too awesome blossom for me (the onions). \\n\\nthe chicken parm w/ sausage and spaghetti:\\nProbably the worst Chicken Parmesan I've ever tasted. I take that back, Lean Cuisine is worse. The chicken was so overcooked that it looked  blackened resting a top spaghetti with a side of sausage link (ridiculously spicy)  all sitting in a pool of oil. \\n\\nThe bread is good though :) -- a strange flat bread with a spicy flavor - they love to spice it up at Primizie.\\n\\nBoth main dishes (& dessert) were served super hot - like microwave hot. I like my food hot but this was a crazy heat that never went away. Oddly, though my cappuccino was served warm at best. The espresso was nice and steamy - very good. \\n\\nThe dessert - we were advised to try the chocolate torte thing - again, meh. I usually love this dessert at restaurants - you know this is the one they tell you takes a while to prepare due to the cooking time. Well, clearly they just toss theirs in the micro because it was out within minutes of ordering. Again - too freaking hot - microwave hot and my husband and I both agreed that there is a difference in microwave hot and oven hot.\\n\\nSo....I would give it one more shot. Maybe we just had the wrong dishes. Like I said, it's a nice place and the service was good. There were lots of people in the restaurant who seemed to be enjoying their meals.

Last Wednesday, my mother was in town so we decided to take her there to show off a bit of the Portland foodie scene. Our table of four had an incredible meal and left the place stuffed and satisfied. \\n\\nA few hours later, things went drastically downhill. My mother and I were the only two at the table to consume the shellfish in the Bouillabaisse (which also included prawns & fish). We became violently ill for the next 24 hours, and as anyone who has suffered from food poisoning knows, it wasn't pretty.  Add in to the mix that this miserable experience ruined the next day (aka Thanksgiving), and you've got yourself a downright unfortunate situation.\\n\\nThe reason I'm really posting today, however, is to share with you how the Tasty N Sons staff handled this event. On Friday morning, once I was ambulatory again, I emailed them a very cordial note about what had happened. The floor manager responded late Saturday evening with a sanctimonious reply 'assuring me of the quality of [their] product' and that 'nothing stays on [their] shelves very long.' Nowhere in the reply did she even give me the courtesy of a 'we're sorry you got sick,' and the email's tone essentially denies that their restaurant could EVER be the cause of such a thing. I'm not usually one to make a lot of waves, and once again was coming from a place of really respecting their establishment (or so I thought).  I must say I am appalled by their lack of customer service skills. Am I to think that our simultaneous & dramatic reaction to the meal was a mere coincidence, because the ever-exalted Tasty N Sons simply doesn't make mistakes?  Do they not value my patronage enough to at the very least offer my money back and/or issue me a gift certificate?\\n\\nI felt that an in-person visit was necessary.  I went down this afternoon and had a sit-down with the same manager.  Granted, she took the time to have the conversation with me despite how busy they were. She apologized up & down after I let her know how dismissive her email had seemed to me. Still, she would not budge on the fact that all the dates had been checked on their seafood, ergo they had done nothing wrong on their end.  I assured her that it was her restaurant that made us ill--it's the only meal my mother and I ate together all day, and the only item not shared by all four of us at the table. This is not rocket science--it's bad shellfish.  She rerouted to placing blame on the purveyor of the mussels. I reiterated that they still served me the bad product and as a result they should be doing everything they can to keep me as a customer. In the end, I pressed her for a refund and got it. I am frustrated that I had to bring it up myself and the charade of her leaving to 'call her supervisor' to get approval. Why a floor manager is not endowed with the latitude to issue refunds in instances like these, I don't know.\\n\\nUltimately, the conversation was a good one--she was polite and eventually gave me what I wanted, which was to erase the $125 we spent from the record. However, I remain deeply disappointed that this restaurant didn't respect me enough to do the right thing in the first place.\\n\\nSo...mussels are mussels. You're probably safe eating most things here, and I guarantee you it will be delicious.

We asked for all dark meat chicken and they were happy to oblige.  The ribs were just as I remembered from our first trip. The sweet baby cakes left a little to be desired. They were very mushy, mostly sweet potato in a lump, and baked.

I thought the burnt ends were good and flavorful. Plus I liked that there was two kinds of meat. I didn't like the pulled pork it just looked like a greasy unidentifiable mess to me. The potato salad seemed to liquidy to me. Baked beans and sweet potato casserole were good but nothing I haven't had before. The fried pickles were awful way to much batter. The bread pudding was good. It's really kind of a desert item. The grits are solid more like a soft bread rather then grits and aren't a bad option.

The women asked for my number and told me she would call me when my table was ready.  I did not mind as the weather was so bad in Boston with the rain yesterday that we were stuck in traffic and did not think I could get there within the hour.  At 6:45 I pulled up in front of the place and THERE IS NO PARKING ANYWHERE!!  GOOD LUCK FINDING A SPOT ON THE STREET.  Sorry for screaming.  We live in PST so eating later was not going to be a problem.  At about 7:00 I called the place again and the women was nice, not too nice but certainly not rude.  I explained to her that my son was asleep in the backseat and I did not care waiting but wanted an estimate on how much longer.  She told me another 1 1/2 hours.  Mind you this started at 5:45.  I decided I would wait for her call and we went back to the hotel at the airport.  10 min away.  At 8 my son was getting hungry and we decided to go elsewhere.

I politely explained my son had gotten hungry and she was nice and we hung up.  \\n\\nOk so I was trying to decide if I should go back today and I am so glad I did.  I ate a very light breakfast and a protein bar for lunch and decided to try Rino's at about 4:15 figuring it would be slow.

My server was Kim and she was wonderful.  I got some bread which was great and I ordered 1/2 order of the lobster ravioli for appetizer and a Rino special for my entree.  For 1 person it is tough you want to try everything.  Food was fantastic.  I ate half each and they wrapped the rest for the plane ride back.

The fried chicken was really good (no KFC or Popeyes) but the outside was very crispy and the inside was tender. The 1/2 rack of ribs were mediocre. The meat fell right off the bones, but I wish they were bigger and more flavorful. And the biscuits were over-hyped in my opinion. The maple butter definitely added a great touch, but I wish the biscuits were hotter. \\n\\nWhat bumped up my rating were the drinks and service. I got an old-fashion which had a nice spicy kick to it. Was not expecting it, but it was one of the better Old Fashions I've had recently.

Even when it was busy, parking was no issue. \\n\\nLocation: next to shopping and other restaurants. If you decide to skip the Domain, you can get anything to want nearby. Right off the highway, this place is easy to get to. \\n\\nAtmosphere: there is a bar area with live music and then the main dining area which is separated by the foyer and hostess stand. Both are upscale and there is a dress code, although it is not too prohibitive. Come decently dressed and you'll be fine. \\n\\nService: top notch. The staff seems to know the best times to come to the table. On one occasion when a drink I ordered didn't taste how I remembered it from the previous time, they took it away immediately and asked me what tastes I was looking for, then made me something with that in mind. The servers I've had were exceptionally nice and worth every bit of the tip. Every time I've been there, the manager has come to the table to make sure everything is ok. \\n\\nFood: I would say this place has the best amount of amazing food to cost I have ever seen. For the money, you get generous portions. It's not cheap, but worth every penny. I get the crab cake every time I go. It's big and full of lump crab. No filler, just pure goodness. I've had the scallops which were fresh, large, and plentiful. Perfectly cooked. I've also had the steak with crab and hollandaise and oh my was it tasty. The vegetables were crisp and fresh and not drenched in butter like some places seem to do. My favorite side is the roasted mushrooms. You get a ton and they are sooooo good. I never take home leftovers from anywhere but I make an exception for these. For dessert, if you have room, the baked Alaska is wonderful. With a crisp cookie bottom and enrobed in perfect meringue, this dessert is large and ever so tasty. With chocolate, coffee, and vanilla ice cream on the inside, you'll have to be rolled out of the building if you can finish it.  Hint: the baked Alaska is complimentary on your birthday. \\n\\nPrice: on the high end, but you get so much great food for the price I feel the cost per portion is actually pretty good.

At a restaurant where food quality isn't that fantastic, this kind of information is invaluable. Plus he's just a really nice guy. Michael at the front desk is also fantastic and has made good suggestions for alternate servers when I've come in when Eric is off. \\n\\nAs for food, the roasted chicken is usually tasty and I like their waffle with strawberries for Sunday brunch.

And the best part is that its close to where the fiance lives, so no need to drive up to winter park anymore!

Every time I took a bite from my sandwich I douse the bite area with more sauce...just by writing I'm salivating already :3!  From the looks of it, the meal looks pretty small..but once you eat, you will become stuffed. I didn't get a chance to finish off my fried okra so I took it home! The baked beans were awesome, while the fried okra was very light and wasn't heavy. Very good.\\n\\nTo end of the meal, I got two cupcakes from their bake shop: Chocolate Birthday and Grasshopper. The total of just two cupcakes came out around ~$7...and thats hella pricey; the quality is comparable to the publix bakery, so its best to use the $7 for cupcakes at publix..you can get more than two there! However, the chocolate cake was very moist even after eating it a day or two old. There is alot of frosting, so be prepared to cut the cupcake in half and make it into a sandwich so you can distribute the frosting.

So when you get it, the chips are at the bottom and bunch of stuff piled on,  and the chips are soggy and everything is just a big hot mess. This restaurant does it differently. They actually bake it. The toppings are piled on evenly over the chips, the cheese is the perfect consistency of melted. Then they add the toppings, the lettuce and sour cream at the very end. So every chip that you bite into is crisp and the toppings are evenly spread out to the chips. This is the only place that I have found that have gotten it right.

I told him I would absolutely come in. Last night was the first Saturday to feature dinner and I brought my Mom. We were the first to arrive and the usual wooden tables were covered with white table cloths and had candles on them. Very nice. The menu is a Prix Fixe, three course dinner for $25 consisting of a salad or soup course, entree and dessert. Really nice choices in each category. I had the corn chowder, the pork loin and strawberry shortcake. Mom had tomato salad, pan seared salmon and the cannoli. It's amazing to have such a quality, fine dining experience in our little neighborhood cafe, but we did. Everything was beyond expectation, expertly prepared with quality ingredients. We could have easily paid double up the street in Chestnut Hill in one of the larger restaurants and not have had nearly as good a meal or experience. I should also mention that after we were seated all the other tables quickly filled up as well. The neighborhood is really ready to support Rita's and it's so nice to see. Chef Joe and crew really know what they are doing in a cozy, unpretentious and unhurried atmosphere. It's BYOB if you care for a drink or some wine with dinner and there is a liquor store right next door if you forget to bring something from home. My Mom said she can't wait to tell all her friends about this great find and come back again. I feel the same way. Please support locally owned and operated when you can.

Pescatarians, vegetarians and vegans would find it a challenge to enjoy our six-course dinners....\\" that really sold me. god bless them for sticking to their principals. the quote written on the chaulkboard wall saying something to the effect \\"if we aren't supposed to eat animals, why are they made of meat?\\" sealed the deal.\\n\\nwe went on 9/5/12, second seating, and ordered the wine pairing. the menu was:\\n- FRESH CORN CHOWDER, NASTURTIUM SAUCE VERTE & FRIED OKRA: the soup was basically corn flavored heavy cream with whatever TF \\"nasturtium sauce\\" is, and it was basically the best soup i have ever eaten in my life. the okra was also the best fried okra i've ever eaten...no idea how they avoided the mushiness that has been fundamental to every other serving of fried okra i've ever had. insane. as for the beaujolais blanc wine pairing, i could have drank a bottle. in my opinion the best white of the evening.\\n- CHARCUTERIE PLATE: \\nFOIE-GRAS BON-BON, SAUTERNES GEL√âE\\nCHICKEN LIVER MOUSSE, LEAF LARD CRACKER\\nSTEAK TARTARE, QUAIL EGG TOAST\\nPORK & PISTACHIO PATE\\nDUCK RILLETTES & TETE DE COCHON\\neverything on this plate was just stupidly good. and if you were wondering, like i was, i can confirm that indeed \\"sauternes gelee\\" is basically jello made with badass french white wine. as many others have reported, the fois gras bon bon and the tartare/quail egg toast are the standouts here, but i could have eaten an entire dinner consisting of a half pound of everything on this plate.\\n- SONOMA FARMS SEARED DUCK BREAST\\nGREEN ROMANO BEANS, WARM POTATO & FENNEL SALAD\\nREDUCED DUCK JUS\\nthis was one of the three minor disappointments of the evening. i love duck but don't eat it often so it could be that i'm overreacting. the breast was tough. really tough. tasted great but very chewy. again this could be just the way it is, i don't eat duck often enough to judge. it tasted great and was well accompanied, well presented, and the portion was reasonable. the wine, GUILLEMOT SAVIGNY-LES-BEAUNE 'LES PICOTIN' 2008, was the best red of the evening and an overall amazing burgundy.\\n- ATHERING TOGETHER FARMS ARUGULA\\nGRILLED 1/2 PEACH\\nCRISPY PROSCUITTO & GOAT CHEESE\\nGREEN ONION & SHERRY VINAIGRETTE\\ni am not a big fruit in my salad kind of guy. this was generally great but i did not think the peach added anything. the prosciutto, goat cheese--everything else really--was incredible. so chalk that up to personal taste.\\n- SELECTION OF CHEESES FROM STEVE AT CHEESE BAR\\nANGELINO PLUMS, CANDIED HAZELNUTS\\nANISE SHORTBREAD, WILD FLOWER HONEY\\nOMMFG. best cheeses i have ever had in the united states, hands down. they had some kind of raw milk english cheddar from manchester that was actually better than any cheese i'd ever had in britain, which is saying something. wish i knew what the other two were--one was italian and one i believe local. all amazing.\\n- WILD PLUM CLAFOUTIS\\nARMAGNAC VANILLA BEAN ICE CREAM\\ngood. not super memorable.\\n\\noverall, with the exception of the duck breast, the food was other worldly. my only other complaints, and what prevent a 5 star rating:\\n- the service was unenthusiastic. maybe because we were the second seating and the staff was getting tired. but they were a bit abrupt and just generally seemed like they wanted to get through with the whole ordeal so they could go home, which most of them managed to do once dinner was done, before our cab arrived to pick us up.\\n- the wine pours were pathetic. they are advertised as half a glass. i ordered an extra full glass of the aforementioned amazing burgundy and it was similarly pathetic. seems like they should either provide enough wine to get you through a course for the standard wine pairing menu, or offer an upgrade where you can get a \\"full glass\\" with each course (which, judging by my purchased full glass, would be about 4 oz).\\n\\nultimately, negatives aside, beast is one of my top 3 portland restaurants (with ox and andina) which easily makes it one of my top 10 worldwide, since i think portland is a foodie mecca and sets a very high bar. i will definitely go back if i ever get the chance again. and order a backup bottle of wine. :^)"},{"name":"Satu'li Canteen","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy, Ste E","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"The best place to eat at animal kingdom, I always get the sauces on the side and dip my food.

There are plenty of vendors making it fresh the old-fashioned way.  And with folks now realizing that sweet is one-note, pushing the flavor envelope by replicating food experiences or finding new combinations is more commonplace too.  But even as Salt & Straw sits where these trends converge, it is something special.\\n\\nGet past the local, hand-made, small-batch production to find a profusion of local ingredients, much of it sourced from Oregon; just check out the flavor descriptions for prolific name-dropping of farms and makers of chocolates, bourbon, coffees, cheeses, spices, salts, wines, and more.  While the ice cream isn't very sweet, as I prefer, it is often wonderfully dense, creamy, and very rich, although it varies by flavor.\\n\\nMore to the point, did you see those flavors?  I thought I've seen odd flavors.  I was humbled.  If their flavor combinations can't get an adventurous eater excited, said eater should just write off ice cream.  Perhaps it was a good thing Salt & Straw's line stretched well out their front door; we needed the time to absorb the kaleidoscope of choices, some that simply stun with their audacity.\\n\\nPart of the hold-up with ordering are the pre-purchase samplings.  But if frequent visits are not in your future, ease the choosing and spare your queue mates by taking the $9 tasting flight of four flavors, in little glass bowls set in a wooden paddle.\\n\\nAs interesting as they sound, the flavors do not all work, while others will vary by the taster.  The loveliest one I tried was the seasonal Oregon's Bounty (salted chocolate, whiskey-candied hazelnuts, cheese buttercream), a perfect mouthful of bliss.  Likewise, pairing pears with blue cheese worked very well, while Aquabeet left me the impression that aquavit and beets should stay far from each other.  Ch√®vre with Marionberry and Habanero Jam surprisingly harmonized, with no single flavor dominating; it was a far more subtle combination than it read.  I suppose I still need to work on lavender in food products, as their Honey Lavender reminded me of nothing so much as hand wash.  Almond Brittle with Salted Ganache and Honey Balsamic Strawberry with Cracked Black Pepper had more straightforward combinations, and tasted fine.\\n\\nTheir shop is certainly not large enough for the volume of business they do, but the many communal tables turn over quickly enough, and there are benches outside also.  The locals probably just pick up pints to go.  Waffle cones are made onsite, and smelled tempting.\\n\\nWith changing seasonal flavors on top of an already fascinating catalogue of flavors, I am truly impressed by the creativity, all on a canvas of plain good ice cream.  It won't be for most kids or tentative palates, but the curious and adventurous will be rewarded.  Just don't expect to like everything."},{"name":"Bangkok Pinto","address":"1041 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I have gotten take out here three times, fast delivery and the restaurant even called to confirm an order once when it didn't look right which I thought was really nice for delivery customer service.\\n\\nThings I've tried:\\nPinto wings: delicious, spicy with a hint of lime flavor, very unique\\nBangkok roll: your standard crispy thai roll, comes with 5 rolls\\nLarb: Good flavor and portion size\\nCrispy Chicken Basil and Spicy Crispy Duck: These dishes are very similar cooked in the same sauce but with different veggies, both were very good and both came with a ton of meat, my boyfriend and I had left overs for days.

I love the Momiji Island which is salmon wrapped around chopped scallop, lightly grilled, served with a sweet soy drizzle. This is delicious and I haven't seen this before. My son said the Yakisoba was delicious and it looked very appetizing. But every time we eat here we get served by the same waitress. She never acknowledges she knows us from adam and we always spend well and tip our habitual 15 percent. If there's a reason we don't go here more often it's because we don't like the service. There's no smile, no hospitality, no warmth.

Instead, it involved cocktails, beer, and many delicious food stuffs that made all my clothing feel tighter when I left.\\n\\nFirst of all, I love the look of this place.  It's got an industrial vibe to it that's warmly offset by the noble swallow portraits in the bar and the super friendly waitstaff, hostess, and owner/manager.  Since we were all newbs, the waitress helped me select the 1984 gin cocktail.  Maybe not as stimulating or I guess, sedating as Soma, but it was tart and tasty without being too sweet. Really great beer selection as well, though a little steep on price.  But I've come to realize that while good beer is easier to find in Austin, it still comes with a finder's fee included.\\n\\nFor food we had the calamari frites/fries/sticks, fried pickled green beans and okra, edamame served with salt and pop rocks, and  banh mini's.  Holy Bacon Bits, those were tasty!  All superior to Bacon Bits, too.  The calamari was cooked perfectly!  Crispy coating and delicious, tender squid inside.  A non-chewy calamari is a thing of beauty!  The fried pickled green beans blew my mind.  I love two things in this world: fried things and pickles.  This dish combined them with a dash of awesome sauce.  I'll admit, when I first saw it slide onto the table I was skeptical, but now I see the light...of the grease.  The edamame with pop rocks was quite a fun and yummy experience.  The pop rocks are a really cool touch, though they lose their pop soon.  Finally, the foie gras banh mini's were cute and had a great texture to them.  Really a bonus for someone who hates the melty-ness of how foie is traditionally served.  Mad props to CK, one of the owners and GM, who guided us (basically ordered for us)  on our late-night, snack feast.  \\n\\nPretty excited to learn that this place serves lunch, too.

Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Baked Beans...  with that said, 4Rivers has the most pathetic, flavorless, greasy, brisket of any restaurant I have ever had.  Once you finish removing the globs of fat from the small mound of greasy meat that is referred to as brisket, it lacks any real flavor besides slight traces of liquid smoke.  The pulled pork was better than the brisket, but severely lacked flavor and needed a lot of sauce to make it worth chewing on.  All was not lost though, I will admit that the baked beans were pretty freaking delicious as were all the sides I tasted.  The cheddar grits are a hidden treasure wrapped in aluminum foil and the bread pudding should not be overlooked as it may be a worthwhile bite away from entering into a sugar coma.  Overall, if you go here just for the sides you will be pleasantly surprised.  However, if you love great bar-b-que, than you would be better off driving quickly past this place and sparing your taste buds and wallet the disappointment.

The place was, once again, packed and loud. We asked the hostess to find us a table and were told to wait a bit. A short moment later, we were seated.\\n\\nNow I've been in cramped seats before at restaurants, but our situation was by far one of the worst I've seen. Our table was position between 2 other tables on each side, and yet they might has well have connected all three of them together. There was literally like an inch in between the tables. We had absolutely no privacy and could hear the people next to us talk as if they were talking to us. I didn't enjoy that at all and I found it very annoying... but, we were famished and proceeded to order a couple of beers and some food.\\n\\nWe decided to split the fried artichoke appetizer, which was pretty damn good. They didn't over-fry them and let it drain properly; it was full of flavor and not as heavy and one would think. A different perspective on the ingredient and very much enjoyable. \\n\\nThen I had the cubano sandwich with a side of fries. It wasn't very good and I only ate about half of it before calling it a night. The service was decent but far from great.

They were so rude that I was close to cancelling my birthday plans all together. As a regular customer, and one who chose to celebrate a big milestone event at Beat Hotel, I was floored by how unaccommodating they were to my needs. They basically implied I should just cancel my reservation instead of them making simple accommodations for me. I ended up keeping the reservation only because it was too last minute to find somewhere else to go, but I was frustrated all evening that they were getting the business of me and my many close friends. Luckily, the food and service was good so it made up for the horrible experience hours before my birthday dinner. It was supposed to be a happy occasion spent with close friends at a place I normally love, but the rudeness left the worst taste in my mouth.

The food was so good that I felt like I had paid not only for an excellent class but for one of the best meals I've had in a long time.\\n\\nOne thing I'd say (and I've seen this in other reviews too) is that you should be prepared for the fact that you cook for a few hours before eating so you definitely should eat a little something before your class. For example, in the class I took, we cooked from about 6pm - 10pm and finally sat down to eat at 10pm. A little rough when you come right from work not having eaten anything.

I continued to go there despite the across-the-board TERRIBLE service because the food is really good (the only thing that earned a star for this review).  \\n\\nI have been there several times and have had to go to the bar myself every single time for either our initial drinks because we waited 15+ minutes to be greeted by a waiter or for refills.\\n\\nWhether or not you'll actually get your appetizer is a complete roll of the dice.  I've ordered guacamole four different times there and have only actually received it once.  They are always baffled as to why it didn't come out, which is feeling more and more like an act every time I witness it.\\n\\nChips come out pretty quick, but you'll likely be sitting there for 15+ minutes before you can eat them because there are no drinks on the table - then when you are finally afforded the opportunity to order drinks, it takes another 15  minutes for them to come out... THEN the server has the audacity to bring them out and say, \\"I'll be right back\\" when you attempt to place your food order.  At this point you've had 30 uninterrupted minutes to contemplate your order - they shouldn't just assume you need even more time.  And good luck stopping them when they walk off, it's like their hearing goes out once their back is to the table.  \\n\\nI can't stress this part enough - this type of poor service happens whether or not it is busy, but actually more-so when it is nearly empty, which is completely frustrating.\\n\\nWe've walked out before placing an order once (20 minutes after being seated) because NO SERVER stopped to greet us.  We've had our entire meals refunded twice for extremely poor service and incorrect checks (both times we were offered a refund, we've never asked for one - we're not the type).  I'm beginning to wonder how this place makes any money.\\n\\nThe servers aren't just poorly trained - they're completely apathetic.  Every time I go to the bar to refill my drinks, there are three or four waiters sitting at the bar watching TV and laughing with one another.  They could be watching the tables, backing up the servers who are at least trying to do their jobs, or at the very least, wasting time where I don't have to see them when I'm doing my server's job for them.  Very poor form for a manager to allow servers to goof off in front of guests.\\n\\nI'm tired of giving them chances.  Cinco has lost my business.  They're terrible and they don't seem to care - if they did, I wouldn't be experiencing the same service problems time after time after time even after it's called to their attention.  \\n\\nYou'll get better service at Taco Bell.

One kid didn't get his food until after everybody got theirs. We asked to follow up TWICE and the waiter was snotty and did not even acknowledge the situation. He just kept pretending that nothing was wrong. He even dropped one of the plates in front of my friend. One of my friend's food came more than an hour late and she asked why it took so long. The waiter just left without even answering her. As we paid for the bill, the waiter also did not get the bills right. Although the manager was apologetic, the waiter wasn't. The manager should've gotten us a new server after that. I ended up paying $45 more because the waiter put my friend's food and wine on my bill. I didn't bother correcting them because I was just done and  wanted to get out of there. The food was great but what makes people come back to a restaurant is the service.

We also had the Prince Edward's Ass (which was very refreshing) and the Blackberry Bonded which was just fantastic all around! I also ordered their only armagnac (because it is a rarity to find one, let alone a decent one) to pair with one of their desserts (which I will get to later) and it was divine!\\n\\nFor the food portion, my gracious date and I started with an order of corn fritters (omg, that rum raisin butter though!?!) and pop rocks edamame. I had been looking forward to trying the edamame since I'd heard about it because, c'mon, Poprocks!!

When I got my order and sat down to eat it was a single cheeseburger. I had to leave the table, hope no one snagged it while I was up and had to wait for my real order.

But then two things happened: (1) a friend took me around to a few bakeries in San Francisco where we'd get a chicken bun here and some shumai there, and it was like a light went on: hey I can get dim sum without going to a big restaurant with carts, and (2) I read the reviews for Windsor. \\n\\nThe dim sum at Windsor was fresher than any I'd had in Boston's Chinatown, and more importantly, the flavor in every dish was just a lot better--like whoever was back there seasoning and preparing really cared about their work. I missed the carts a little bit because sometimes something comes around that you didn't even think you might want, but then you say to yourself hey that looks good let's get it.

The wait time was relatively short by North End standards--about 30 minutes--and we were deliriously hungry by the time we got in. We started with the Insalati di Spinaci, which was excellent. The parmesan peppercorn dressing was delicious and we gobbled everything up. The Linguine al Frutti di Mare was AMAZING. With a bit of kick and generous portion of seafood, we loved everything about the pasta. The Malloreddus alla Campidanese, on the other hand, is supposed to be the specialty, but the sauce tasted like a watered-down marina and there was nothing special about it. It did however, taste good with some of the sauce from the seafood pasta.\\n\\nMaurizios stayed busy all night and seemed pretty understaffed, which made for slow service and a general lack of water refills. But even our dehydration wasn't enough to temper our enthusiasm about getting into the restaurant with delicious food. Next time I'm in the North End, I'm skipping the three hour wait.\\n\\nPro Tip #1: Snag the Yelp deal and load it onto your phone before you go in since signal on the lower level is flaky.\\nPro Tip #2: They don't come by to offer you parmesan on your food, but if you ask for it, they'll bring a bowl over so don't be shy!"},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We actually wound up here by mistake as we thought we were trying the much advertised Elephant Room downstairs.

After a recommendation from a friend that this place had the absolute best Mexican food in Orlando we knew we had to give it a shot. \\n\\nOk, let's start from the beginning. We walk in on a Friday night, it's raining and the place is PACKED. Nothing spectacular to report on the decor, the same kind of dive-y, hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint I expected. We squeeze into a booth in the corner and were greeted immediately by a very friendly host (pretty sure he was the manager.) We order drinks, and get some chips and salsa. The Salsa = AHHMMAAZING. It had the perfect amount of heat, cilantro, onion and spices. You could tell it was made in house and not store bought. The chips were warm and fresh with the perfect amount of salt. \\n\\nI ordered a beef taco and a pork enchilada (covered in queso, seriously it's worth the extra .89) and my boyfriend got the steak something or other. The food came out in a timely fashion and it was all DELICIOUSSSS. The ground beef in my taco was seasoned perfectly and very delicious. The taco was topped with the most incredible Mexican cheese I've ever tasted in my LIFE. I can't get over it. It was rich, creamy and had great flavor. The enchilada tortilla was super fresh- you could taste it was homemade. The pork inside was absolutely mouthwatering and delicious; it tasted like they pan seared it right before putting it in the tortilla. And of course, I got mine smothered in that delicious cheese I mentioned before. Like, honestly the best freaking enchilada I've ever had in my entire life. \\n\\nOk, on to the rest of the meal. Both our meals were served with your typical rice and beans. Except there was NOTHING typical about the rice and beans! I've never in my life had Spanish rice as good what La Fiesta serves up. It's indescribable. Most Spanish rice is dry, boring, lacking any real flavor and put on your plate as a filler. This stuff is moist, full of flavor and truly an experience in itself. The re-fried beans were tasty and topped with that same delectable cheese mentioned above. My boyfriend got this DELICIOUS steak (no clue what the name was) that was covered in WHOLE roasted jalapeno peppers. It was spicy, flavorful and truly a delicious experience. \\n\\nWe talked to the manger toward the end of our meal to simply thank him for such a remarkable, delicious, small business dining experience. He told us that they get their cheeses imported from THREE different places across the country and it's delivered a few times a week! Their steaks marinate for hours and sometimes overnight and their pork is all homemade and roasted in house. I'm not only impressed, but a customer for life! It was so good, we ended up going back for lunch the next day!\\n\\nThis place is the real deal and totally worth your time and money."},{"name":"Whiskey Dicks","address":"50 E Central Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Came in for lunch to kill time before my flight back to Atlanta and it looked like a good spot to chill from my previous Orlando experience.

Portland tends to do that to places that are good at the core.\\n\\nMeat on a stick is usually good. Some here are easier to eat than others, but all are fun. While the price seems to add up quickly, I felt full after a few plates of various flavors. The baby octopus sticks were hard for some in our group to eat, as they are whole baby octopi. (Chicken on a stick doesn't look like chicken in a coop, so it's easier for people to stomach--it seems pretty American to separate the cute animal with the meat). The food doesn't feel greasy, and there are subtle flavors that come through, like pickled plum sauce and shiso leaf. I'd like to say that the options to order were limited, but that was because of the time of day that we showed up: only happy hour was available. The drinks were fun as well. \\n\\nI really have nothing bad to say. I guess my experience was slightly soured by another customer who made comments at us and wouldn't mind her own business, but that is not Ping's fault. Still, I wish she hadn't been there.

My sister was craving GOOD cheesecake, and she wanted to treat me, too!  =)  Since it was blazing hot that day, I drove the (incredibly) short distance from Maggiano's to park closer to this Cheesecake Factory.\\n\\nWe walked straight to the take out counter, which is on the right as soon as you enter the restaurant.  There was one customer in front of us, and since my sister and I pretty much knew what we wanted, we had made our decisions on which cheesecakes we wanted by the time the customer was done ordering.\\n\\nTo make a long story short, the employee taking orders at the cash register was busy taking orders over the phone and preparing take out meals.  We stood and waited at least five minutes before she finally took our cheesecake orders, and we specifically requested whipped cream to be included on the side (since I wasn't sure whether they always provided whipped cream).  After ordering and paying, we waited another ten minutes or so for our cheesecakes.  The employee was not friendly or apologetic about the delay.\\n\\nWhen we finally got our cheesecakes, we looked at both to ensure we got the right ones and that they had whipped cream.  Neither included whipped cream, and one order was incorrect.  My sister had ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, but she got the Oreo one instead.  WOW.  So we requested the whipped cream again, which they put in plastic containers.  And, of course, my sister notified them of the mistake they made.\\n\\nIf you've never ordered the Red Velvet cheesecake, you should know that it is a HUGE slice, so it's put in a plastic container that is larger than the standard cheesecake slice container.  The container is large enough to fit a huge salad.  However, instead of putting the large container in a plastic bag for her to carry, the employee simply handed it over to her.  Per my suggestion to request a bag, my sister got one because it would have been awkward to carry the large container, and of course there's a higher risk of dropping it on the way to my car without a bag.  \\n\\nOnce we got home, we didn't eat our cheesecakes right away since they were no longer cold.  We put them in the fridge for a few hours and let them chill so that we could enjoy them later.\\n\\n* Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake ($6.95) - Per the menu description, this is a \\"Silky Chocolate Cheesecake Topped with a Layer of Belgian Chocolate Mousse.\\"  Although I'm normally not a dessert person, I am a huge fan of chocolate mousse.  This cheesecake was as delicious as it sounds.  I just love the smooth texture of mousse, and it isn't overly rich like regular chocolate frosting.  You must put a bit of whipped cream on each bite!  Yuuuum...  =)\\n\\n* Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake ($7.95) - \\"Moist layers of Red Velvet Cake and our Original Cheesecake covered with our special Cheesecake Factory cream cheese frosting.\\"  It's HEAVENLY.  There isn't much else to say, but I really like that there isn't an overly cheesy/milky aftertaste as some red velvet cakes have.  I definitely want to get this one next time!\\n\\nOverall, The Cheesecake Factory (take out section ONLY) at Perimeter Mall gets 3.5 stars because the cheesecake is amazing, but service wasn't.  The cheesecake itself easily deserves 5 stars.  So good!  I know this will sound crazy, but their Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake is the best red velvet that I have ever tasted!  I can't believe I had never tried it until recently.  I highly recommend you try it if you haven't already!\\n\\n[Review 251 of 366]"},{"name":"Beat Brasserie","address":"13 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Great vibe, good food -- nice ambience, made even nicer by the attention of Christa Phaneuf, Restaurant Manager who not only knows her stuff (food, wine, etc.) but stops by to check in, make sure everything is \\"great\\" -- without being intrusive.

The place is SMALL - 30 seats, tops - so make sure you make a reservation. The table was cozy & sparse. \\n\\nThe drinks menu had several types of beer, red & white wines, & spirits. I tried to order a Caesar (my favourite drink, & arguably one of the yardsticks of a decent bartender), & was informed that \\"they don't have mix\\". No Clamato? No. No mix for any of the drinks? No. So be prepared to drink all your spirits straight. Really?\\n\\nI ordered a glass of house wine, the salmon terrine, & the mussels. The wine was inexpensive & very drinkable. The salmon terrine came as a slab on a plate with a little garnish, & no bread, crostini, etc. The terrine itself was very tasty, but also very heavy, & really could have used some crostini as an accompaniment (there is a reason it usually comes with some sort of bread). The mussels were cooked to perfection, but a little bland. There was no pepper on table to liven it up, so I spaced out the chorizo (the only tasty element in the bowl) to give the dish some flavour. \\n\\nThe dessert offerings included clafoutis, lava cake, & sticky toffee pudding which was not on the menu & in limited supply. This is a shame - we ordered the sticky toffee pudding & it was delicious. The maple accompaniment really enhanced the perfectly baked dessert. We also ordered the clafoutis, which was a disappointment. The consistency was good, & had hints of marzipan, but was otherwise somewhat bland.\\n\\nPrices were reasonable & service was okay. (The server, who is also the owner's SO, gave the birthday girl's wine to the new mom who wasn't drinking, & we had to go downstairs to ask about a dish which was ordered but never came. She also seemed unsure about the ingredients in the dishes, which seemed odd considering her husband is both the owner & chef.

[UPDATE: I recently returned and again it was delicious. The fried rice has changed mildly, but its still excellent and while mildly different its equally as good. This time I ordered the General's Chicken Lunch Special, with Miso soup and a spring roll. I also ordered a delicious young coconut juice (it even had slices of coconut in the glass) I asked for the general's chicken to be made with white meat. The waitress said it was. (Its not). I hesitantly went along with that, but shortly after she returned and said it wasn't, but popcorn chicken WAS and they could exchange it. So I went with that happily. \\n\\nIt arrived at my table looking kind of questionable--- but oh my. It was delicious. The chicken was small sort of stringy pieces of white meat chicken in a light tempora-y batter. It was a very thin batter. Not like the normal very thick dough-y general's chicken. The sauce was to die for. It lacked that 'cheap' almost chemically sweet/tart flavors of normal generals chicken. It took the standard sauce and uplifted it to a light, delicious, almost glaze. They sprinkled the top with sesame seeds, and that couldn't hurt anything. The miso was white, and superb. The tofu in the soup was so tender and \\"pure\\" tasting, if that makes any sense. The spring roll was average. The waitress was nice, but seemed new and not to know the products well. We didn't mind that at all though since she corrected her mistakes way before they could be an issue. ]\\n\\nThings I love and what keeps me coming back are their really high quality chicken fingers (Maybe called Golden fingers there?).

My boyfriend could get a great steak, I could fatten myself up with extravagant cheese, that kind of thing.  Perhaps if my expectations were closer (very, very close) to the ground I would've left satisfied.  \\n\\nWe visited The Butcher Shop early on a Saturday evening.  I liked the ambiance, and we were quickly seated.  Admittedly, the service was fantastic.  The waiter (I wish I knew his name!) knew so much about the different cheeses and wines on the menu, and took his time in explaining a bit about each.  The bread he brought us soon after was the highlight of the meal--the butter and honey combination was fantastic!  However, it really says something when the bread basket is better than your main course...  \\n\\nThe a la carte cheese cost $5 each, and while they are very tasty, the portions can aptly be described as \\"shavings.\\"  \\n\\nAs for entrees, my boyfriend paid $36 for a bone in rib eye which he ordered rare.  It wasn't rare.  Instead, he had a fatty piece of unevenly cooked meat on his plate for $36. No sides.  Our friend ordered a $44 strip, cooked medium (to his own fault--who orders medium!?).  However, his steak was ridiculously rare (and delicious!).  It seemed like a much better meal than the rib eye.  But, what does it say about the chef when he/she cannot properly cook a steak to order?\\n\\nIt was clear to the wait staff that we were ordering dinner, and it wasn't clear to me from the menu that the boudin blanc was not an entree.  The waiter described it to me and didn't hesitate to interject when I ordered it.  It was SO SMALL.  Seriously.  A three inch sausage, four prunes, an egg, and maybe a cubic inch of potatoes (which, by the way, tasted like diner potatoes).  Everything was presented in a deconstructed way, which made food look even more insubstantial.  I complained, and the manager generously gave me the hot dog a la maison.\\n\\nThe hot dog a la maison, despite costing less than the boudin blanc, was a much more substantial meal.  The sausage was tasty, and the cheddar had great flavor.  However, the rosemary chips were quite greasy and a bit flavorless.  \\n\\nMy wine, however, was fantastic.  \\n\\nOverall, this was such a disappointing experience for me.  When I go out to a nice place where I'll be spending more than should be spent on a single meal, I hope to leave satisfied.  Overall, a few shavings of delicious cheese and a great glass of wine don't overcome the mediocre entrees and spending almost $200 for three people.  If you have the money, go for it.

Generally, the food here is pretty good which is why we decided to try one of their prefix \\"farm to table\\" dinners last night.  I was so disappointed in both the food and the service.  Let me explain.  I am vegetarian and they specifically said in their ad for these dinners that vegetarian options were available.  Ok great, I thought!  When the first course came out - the regular meal was some kind of spring roll on a bed of greens and mine was...well the bed of greens - I was a little disappointed but I reserved judgment.  Second course - pork on top of veggies.  My meal - the veggies at the bottom of the pork - not protein, nothing - just the \\"side\\" of the main meal.  The main course was the most shocking.  And by now you can guess what is coming.  The regular offering was chicken on top of wild rice.  My \\"main course\\" was a small portion of wild rice.

You could really taste Latin flavors in the rub used for the chicken, and the BBQ sauces.  Our food also came with some flour tortillas on the side, which I loved.

Just keep that in mind when planning what kind of dinner you want.\\n\\nLike the other reviews say, it's pricey, but definitely worth it at least once. I went for Father's Day brunch and it was amazing. Caramelized bacon with a crepe, a sauteed duck breast, some cheese, and a great mimosa. \\n\\nThis is more of an experience than just a show up and order type place. As far as I know, it's always pre-fixe style. The coffee was amazing (french press local brew). \\n\\nI only give it 4 stars because the portion sizes were smaller than I expected, and I've been to my fair share of  \\"small portion, big price\\" type high-class restaurants; this was still on the smaller side. I understand it's so they can concentrate on quality and detail, but... i might be skewing this because it was brunch, and you expect that kind of thing out of dinner and not necessarily meals before noon.\\n\\nI'd recommend this for dinner if you want to have a fun, different kind of dinner night with a date or group of friends.

Dinner on the other hand, seems like they are way understaffed and service varies from server to server.

My takeaway is that \\"this is good, but not great,\\" and possibly a little overhyped for what it is. \\n\\nI'll start first with the cocktails. Artisanal, block cut ice is definitely a thing, and while this bar tries to make its cocktails interesting by using ice balls in its drinks, I was disappointed by the drinks. I asked the server and learned that the balls are actually made from Bed Bath and Beyond cartridges. Guys, this hurts my little \\"small is beautiful\\" and \\"support local business\\" heart; up y'all's GD GAME. The issue with using ice from that kind of a source is that the water soaks up all of the flavors and smells of whatever else is in the freezer, so your drink is less pure and can sometimes be funky. So if you're not doing artisanal ice, just please don't pretend you are. Added disappointment is that this place fills the ice with syrupy filler that take a fair amount of time to melt, which makes the cocktail helter skelter. \\"Delicious\\" and I sampled three: the Ice fashioned, an off menu Mint Julep, and the Randy Watson dessert drink. Basically, each one was boozy in the beginning and too saccharine in the end to stomach. If I went again, I'd break up the ice ball right away to properly mix the drink. And then I'd feel annoyed about paying top dollar to tip a mixologist who should be doing this himself. \\n\\nThe food was interesting. D. had been there before and had us get the edamame (red pepper, salt and pop rocks additions, creative) and pork cheek (damned delicious mustard with a fig jam on toast, great flavor profile), which he'd had previously with his work friends. We also tried the calamari (thick as cheese sticks, fried and tasty) and the tuna (easily the best thing we tried, the squid ink really complemented the dish). Overall, each portion was inventive and prettily plated, but small and expensive. Each small plate was around $15 and the cocktails cost $12. \\n\\nThe table service was acceptable, though again, not what I'd expect for a three digit dinner bill before tip. The name reason for my withholding that fourth star is the hostess experience. D and I'd called about moving our reservation up an hour and were told we could be accommodated, then waited 40 minutes in an incredibly packed staircase platform waiting for that accommodation. I wish we'd just been told no so that we would have shown up on time and not had to fight other patrons for space. As the restaurant matures, they'll hopefully improve.\\n\\nI'd say if you're interested in checking this place out, avoid a weekend and stick to your reservation."},{"name":"Chevys Fresh Mex","address":"12547 State Rd 535","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"As locals, this is honestly our favorite Mexican place in Orlando.

Seriously, don't come here expecting just good food.  Come here expecting food that is great - that makes you glad to be alive.  Food that will make you thank your taste buds.  Ahhh, the food.

From pasta/rice (Linguine ai Frutti di Mare) to meat (Filetto di Manzo) to fish (Cozze alla Marinara or Sogliola alla Parmigiana) - everything is perfect.  If you want to taste Maurizio's wheelhouse, though, try the fish - any fish.  After all, it is a Mediterranean restaurant.  Don't be afraid of fish - I know, fish hurt you at some restaurant back when you were a kid.  It's okay.  Time to grow up - Maurizio's fish is different.  Period.  It's delicious, flaky, flavorful, and it'll be nice to you.  I promise.  Oh, and if you're unsure - just get whatever the special is that evening.  You won't be let down.  Here, the word \\"special\\" actually means something, so order it...\\n\\nThat being said, the plain interior is small and modest - I like to say intimate.

We shared a giant pretzel and some Chex mix.  Love the ping-pong and the patio is quite nice.  \\n\\nThere was one major problem both nights: the beer wasn't cold.  Save me the explanations about how ice-cold beer doesn't allow you to fully appreciate the subtle flavor and masks the aromatics yada yada.  On a hot night I like my beer served cold.  This is Texas, trust me it will warm up soon enough and I will be able to savor the brew's nuances.  Instead it was a matter of minutes before we were swilling warm beer, which is not all that refreshing.  \\n\\nDespite this, Easy Tiger is a fun hangout and a nice addition to this part of Sixth."},{"name":"Shoal Creek Saloon","address":"909 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've lived in Austin for 2 years and have passed by this place so many times...each time reminding myself that I should check it out.

We ordered the ahi sashimi appetizer, which was delicious, as well as 1 1/2 lb lobster to share.  Neither my boyfriend nor I had ever had lobster before, and we admitted to our waitress that we didn't know how to break into it.  At that moment, the owner of the restaurant was walking by and had overheard us.

Big down side is that they don't take reservations for a small group and they're super popular. Parking is difficult as well. We had a 1-1/2 hour wait and did what everyone else does:  drinks and appetizers at their other place across the street.  Everything is excellent!  Appetizers of meatballs and shrimp scampi were so flavorful. Rino's lobster ravioli's pasta and sauce are the best I've tasted.  The entrees are super size, especially the chicken parmesan; it's 6\\" high!  The salad that comes with the entrees is average; nothing special.

It's inside the Verve Crowne Plaza hotel, FYI, but it's not the bustling bar off the lobby - it's the oddly brightly lit square space at the far end of the lobby. I cannot understand why it was so bright in there. I mean, it was a Friday night at 7 or so; why is it lit up like a mall store in the middle of the afternoon? That was our first clue that the place was off. The next was that no one came to greet us or seat us for at least 5 minutes. Eventually a harried looking waiter glanced at us and we sat. Ignored for many minutes. Ordered a vodka martini, extra dirty, and a beer. A very clean martini arrived. I flagged down the waiter - now setting up for a large party - and explained it was supposed to be a dirty martini, which meant olive brine.  He looked confused, so I just asked for some olive juice. He said sure...a few minutes later a different guy, very harried looking, came by with a glass of lemon juice. I explained that was not what I needed, and he slumped over the table, laughing sort of, in that oh my god my night is such a horror show kind of way, like I should be feeling for him...off he went, exhaustedly, in search of my olive juice. 2 minutes later a different guy comes by with it. Then 1 minute later, the first guy comes by with the large squeeze bottle labeled OLIVE BRINE from the bar. I told him I was good now, I had already gotten it, and he made a big \\"AGGGHHH! Are you kidding me!\\"kind of gesture...I squeezed some more brine into my martini just so he wouldn't kill himself. The \\"Confused Buffalo Wings\\" were pretty good, though not terribly confused; just swapped the buffalo sauce for a blue cheese sauce and th note sauce was on the side..The Scallops were really good, nicely cooked and the lardons (bacon) were perfect, the Brussels sprouts soft, the corn puree sweet. My spouse's Steak Frites were ok but the beef was not a hanger steak - more like the end of a random sirloin; much too thick and chewy. Good Frites though.

The critical reviews from my fellow yelpers regarding this establishment are wholly justified.    \\n\\nI was excited about this restaurant because of it's location near the North End. The idea of homemade pasta, fresh bread, and delicious Italian food enticed our group of friends to make a reservation on Friday evening. Of course, having a $50 gift card was a motive all in itself. Thankfully that helped with the bill, because this place was about as tasteful as the bank bailout in 2008.\\n\\nWe sensed an environment on the brink of desperation upon entrance. A retreat would have been warranted, but the gift card needed to be used. \\n\\nThe Decor had the ambiance of the Addam's Family Mansion.  The lone cook in the kitchen resembled Uncle Fester.  \\n\\nThe friendless of their service staff was similar to a 19th century bar saloon:  No recommendations, No specials, and No smile. Just order. \\n\\nHow about that fresh bread? For starters, where is it? It's always concerning when you need to hunt down the waiter for a basket of bread. The dipping oil was mediocre, but that summarized my experience so far, until the entrees came to the table. \\n\\nThe server \\"auctioned\\" off our entrees. I suppose the memorization of 5 dinners was too much to ask for the 19th century bar saloon mentality.  \\n\\nMy entree was without question the worst \\"Fruiti Di Mari\\" ever ordered for several reasons. First, the sole tasted like it was stored in the freezer for a hundred years. Second, the clams touted little flavor. Third, the shrimp was clearly frozen;  requiring a chainsaw to chomp through it. Forth, the tomato base broth was about as lifeless as a corpse, though I suppose it's fitting given the Addam's Family Decor. Finally, I specifically requested 'spicy', but the kick was flatter than an ironboard. The rest of my group expressed disappointment with their entrees. Frankly, it's amazing a trip to the ER was avoided. \\n\\nThe icing on the cake? Clearing individual entrees before everyone was finished! \\n\\nI just love the professionalism. \\n\\nI did mange to peak into the Kitchen to find out what Uncle Fester was doing. In the North End (i.e. Al Dentes, Carmens, etc); you normally hear chefs vocally issuing orders and moving quickly to push out entrees. What happened at Filippos? I witnessed a lone cook moving about as fast at Betty White using a stroller.\\n\\nOverall, this is a prime candidate for Kitchen Nightmares. I may send a personal note to Gordon Ramsey to please save this establishment, though it may  ultimately be best to close the doors permanently. \\n\\nMy dear friends rallied in spirit, had desert and wine elsewhere, and enjoyed the night regardless of this restaurant nightmare."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Excellent service from the manager to the waiter to the hostess.

Both were good but I would say that the steak was not to die for at the price point.  I've had better at other well known Boston steak houses.  The sausage was a more unique and tasty offering.  If I had to chose again I might chose the lamb chops.  Reasonable beer prices (didn't drink wine).  We decided to head to the South End Buttery for dessert instead of here so can't comment on that course.  \\n\\nAlthough small and a little cramped it was a nice atmosphere overall.

It went well with the extensive and tasty cheese platter we shared. But it did come at a hefty fee. You can tell these people are passionate about the finer things in life. Wine, cheese, fresh breads, oils, vegetables and of course...their vast array of cured and braised meats.  But, being a connoisseur of all things nice doesn't come cheap.  And me thinks, the suits and money bags that arrived wanting a table.....and having to stand and drink their Pinon Vouvray around the butchers block that centered the room....were a little pissed off.  Save your pennies up for this treat, and get their early or book a table.

The sauce from the lasagna should not be wasted. I had shrimp with angel hair pasta.

I overdo them myself from time to time.\\n\\nWe both decided on dessert and tried the two most popular house dishes, the vanilla bean creme br√ªl√©e and the tiramisu. My wife has lived in Italy, so she holds the latter to a very high standard. She didn't like it here, but she hasn't liked it anywhere we've tried it.

Imagine stuffing the whole thing in your mouth... feeling guilty yet? Here's where the magic of Haley House comes in.\\n\\nNow we know the cookies are made fresh daily, from scratch, sans preservatives of chemicals. But, what if they were made by ex-convicts getting back on their feet, traversing the road to righteousness via delicious baked goods? And what if the coffee you ordered with it was fair-trade and organic? Oh, and if it was all really, really affordable? And if there was free wi-fi so you could actually get some work done and make the trip worthwhile? That's what I thought. And that's just one cookie.\\n\\nHaley House also serves up a mighty impressive array of muffins (vegan banana has my vote), scones, bars, tarts, and other cookies, depending on the day. Their selection of loose leaf teas is virtually infinite, since you can combine any of the dozen flavors to make your own custom brew. Chef Mills's signature jerk chicken has a cult following, especially when in quesadilla form, and for the meat-less crowd, the veggie cutlet plate with collards packs one impressively spicy, vegan punch.\\n\\nThough Haley House is usually only open through lunchtime, you can grab dinner on Thursday nights when the kitchen is open until 8:30. HH hosts a weekly performance series then, called Art Is Life Itself, which starts around 7 (but let's be real... 7:30), and is followed by an open-mic night. Seriously, chowing down on a thai chicken salad or classic soul food plate while listening to interesting, passionate speakers with a community emphasis is no poor way to spend a Thursday night. Plus, if you're feeling thirsty (or are just shy about getting involved in the funny, often heated audience discussions) Haley House offers organic beer and wine all night.\\n\\nMore of a breakfast person? Haley House serves up a mean egg sandwich and an even meaner brioche french toast in the mornings. The side of home fries put everything over the top, and of course you can add bacon to anything for that extra oomph. Can't get your ass out of bed before noon? No problem, me neither! Brunch is served late on the weekends, so take your sweet time.

My personal favorite is the short rib gnocchi. I want to eat it all day every day and maybe bathe in it too. Is that weird? I tend to lean more towards the millions-of-apps route here. The buffalo brussels sprouts are amazing, and I'm not sure why no one ever thought of serving that before. Love me some ricotta fritters, stuffed mushrooms, and bluefish cakes.\\n\\n3. The drinks are also outstanding - surprisingly so for a slightly divey-looking joint. Personal fave is a bloodhound amended to be made with house tequila. The ingredients are clearly fresh and elevate the drink. All cocktails on the menu have this same quality.\\n\\n4. The cost-to-deliciousness ratio is unparallelled. I come here often for dinner and a few drinks. I usually leave feeling quite rotund, and have never spent more than $50. And I'm a dinner drinker for sure.\\n\\n5. The barstaff is really nice and attentive. Like the time I was having a bad day and the bartender coerced me into a chocolate pudding on the house.

I've never had chicken spiced so perfectly and with such a nice texture. With the addition of avocado, cilantro, and their signature aiolis and sauces, these wraps are to die for. And prices are very reasonable too. (Nothing is over 10 bucks) If you like it hot, there are options to make the food spicy and even add habanero infused tequila to the wraps.

The deep fried wontons though left something to be desired as although they were crispy and not too oily, they didn't taste like anything. The curry...oh boy that was DELICIOUS! I liken it to Japanese curry in terms of the sweetness it possessed, though I think it came from coconut milk.

PF Changs was my favorite restaurant when I was in college.  I was there basically every week so I was super excited when I heard about Pei Wei.  \\nThe great thing about Pei Wei is that you can get some of the things that you love from PF Changs such as lettuce wraps, dan dan noodles, spicy chicken, and Mongolian beef.  The bad news, at least for me, is that they alter the recipes a bit by adding surplus vegetables that I don't want.  What I always appreciated about PF Changs was that it was Chinese food where protein was the star.  What I get so frustrated about with take out Chinese is that you order beef with broccoli and there are 3 pieces of beef and the rest broccoli.  Unfortunately, there is a bit of that going on here.  They add mushrooms to the Mongolian beef.  They add peppers to the spicy chicken.  It's not the end of the world, and of course you can order without, but as a picky foodie I always appreciate when I can order and enjoy something exactly as it is.  While I can totally do that at Changs, it is not the case here.  \\nAdditionally, I feel like the food is a little milder here than at Changs.  We ordered the Thai Dynamite chicken the other day and it wasn't even remotely spicy.  It had a spicy symbol and has dynamite in the name.  That was kind of a disappointment.  \\nThis particular location was having issues with their freestyle machine.  I don't drink soda or caffeine so I was super excited that they had a freestyle.  I love Strawberry Light Lemonade.  However, both machines were out of lemonade and despite my going to tell them no one ever came out to fix it.  This was the whole reason for ordering a drink.  We ended up trying the Citrus Green Tea which wasn't so bad, but it was frustrating that no one ever fixed the machine.  \\nOverall, I would say it is above average Chinese takeout."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"Wonderful seafood entrees and appetizers.

Didn't bother me much, but would have preferred a more enthusiastic helper. \\n\\nI wanted to order 3 scoops on a cone, but was told that I can't and can only get three in a cup. I really wanted a cone, so I ordered two-the golden custard and cinnamon bun with cheese cake (by the way, this was a facebook customer created flavor). I noticed a major difference at this place compared to bella is that you try your flavors first, then pay and they'll scoop. Which is the other way around at bella, you pay, try and scoop. I like the process at amato better because this way I can see which flavors I like most and decide whether I want a double scoop or a single. Whereas at Bella, if I paid for two, I'd have to choose two flavors regardless. \\n\\nBoth flavors were awesome. Smooth and light, just like how gelato is suppose to be. What I love about their gelato is that it doesn't melt as fast as the ones from, for example, bella gelateria. I spent about.... 5 mins trying to take shots of my gelato and it wasn't even dripping.

Though you may have been to Salt & Straw before, each month has new flavors, so it's like experiencing the frozen treat for the first time. \\n\\nIn addition to the fun flavors, I love the service. Though the line can sometimes be long, you will never feel rushed while trying out a few flavors (or all of them; no judgements) to find just the right one to satisfy your sweet tooth.

I wasn't exactly sure what to expect based on the name. I thought maybe picnic tables, baskets, and cold food were in store. It turns out to have an old timey, sort of classy speakeasy feel in a large open space with lots of wooden features, cool wall decor, and 20's music playing. I really enjoyed the ambiance as it made my handlebar moustache feel right at home. \\n\\nThe lunch menu was mainly soups, salads, and sandwiches all of which had an intriguing flare. I went for the half sandwich and salad combo picking the chicken and bacon sandwich with the brown rice salad. It was a little pricey for lunch at $12 but turned out to be a lot of food. The half sandwich was easily sizable enough for me to consider it a full sandwich. The side salad wasn't too small either.  The flavor of both we're amazing. The sandwich was on a hard toasted bun which gave it a nice crunch. The creamy aioli dressing, salty bacon, and roasted chicken flavors combined deliciously.  I found myself going back and forth between bites of sandwich and salad without stopping until the plate was empty.  I was very impressed. If you have a large moustache that is still partially filling in be careful not to pull the lower hairs into your mouth when breaking into the bread. It gets messy. \\n\\nMy only suggestion would be to decrease the serving size slightly and reduce the price to $8 or so. That would make it much more manageable for frequent lunch visits and be just the right amount of food. Overall a job well done.

However the recurrent theme falling back on \\"family style\\" as an excuse for slow and incompetent service is tiresome. Better to be honest as I watched the flow of service, it was painfully obvious that an order was lost.\\n\\nSure it's busy on Saturdays and if you're an owner, who cares how you serve people as long as the line is a healthy 30 - 60 minutes? But attention to detail is a restaurateur's friend and when the staff smiles lackadaically and bullshits you that \\"slow\\" is the service ethos, you have bigger problems than a long wait!\\n\\nService recovery was excellent. Once the manager took control, they comped the entire meal, found the lost order and boxed it for us on our way out. Otherwise may have gotten a 4 star.

Small, dark, and a bit divey it was great to relax and enjoy a meal. \\n\\nThe bartender was very knowledgeable and we grabbed a couple of beers while waiting for our table (no reservations for less than 6 people). For reference we got there at 6:15 on a Sunday (Memorial Day weekend) and the wait was about 40 minutes. A big plus was the parking lot behind the building.\\n\\nI will say my girlfriend and I are not large humans, but may be headed down that path if we eat like we did at HK. We were intrigued by many things on the menu, so we decided to get everything we wanted. To share my girlfriend and I got 5 Pemaquid oysters, a scallop ceviche special, gnocchi w/ short rib ragout, and buffalo fried brussel sprouts. Then as our own dishes, she got the Cuban Reuben and I got the Highland Cheeseburger.\\n\\nThere were a few misses in terms of execution, but for the most part the meal (and service) was exceptional. It was also very reasonably priced. The oysters were excellent, and served with a cava mignonette. The ceviche special was delicious (although they ran out of the lobster that was supposed to be the other component). It was served with mango and black radish, and had just enough acidity to balance out the sweetness of the scallop. I wouldn't have minded a little bit of heat but it was still great.\\n\\nThe gnocchi with short rib was rich and flavorful; my girlfriend loved it. I thought the gnocchi were a bit too soft in texture but she thought they were just right. My revelation of the meal was the buffalo brussel sprouts. Brussels have become my favorite vegetable over the past year, and I've been cooking them once or twice a week. The combo with the buffalo sauce and bleu cheese was not one I would ever think of, but I was so surprised at how good it was that I'll be making my own rendition of these at home. I thought they could have been cooked a bit longer, but other than that they were perfect.\\n\\nBy the time our sandwiches came I was getting full, but still had enough left in the tank to put down the cheeseburger. Simple, and cooked a perfect medium-rare, the burger was great with the caramelized onions and the sweet house pickles. My girlfriend finished half of her sandwich and thoroughly enjoyed it as well. The service throughout the night was superb, and I left very happy.\\n\\nThere aren't too many places I go where I leave thinking that the combination of quality, service, and value was so great that I could see myself coming back again and again. I'm glad to say HK fulfilled that criteria, and I'll be glad to return."},{"name":"El Pueblo Mexican Restaurant","address":"7124 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"Absolutely wonderful food.

Heck, just look at how many reviews they have and just how many of them are 5 stars! \\n\\nIn fact, I am the first to admit that I can be particularly harsh on the restaurant industry. I have worked in, managed, and taken part in, the food and service industry since I was first able to work, and as a result (especially for Portland) I have very high expectations.\\n\\nThat having been said if you are here looking for a 1 star review that's honest you won't find it. I suspect, highly, that those who leave this establishment less than 4 stars are simply doing so because they either 1) want the attention that comes with it, or 2) are unfairly judging Tasty 'n Sons because of circumstances outside of their control (I'm sorry sir and/or madam, we cannot remove the stick from your rectum due to health concerns).\\n\\nMy experience here was perfect. I was seated promptly, at a beautiful bar seat that gave me a wonderful view of the street, as well as the majority of the restaurant. The staff was attentive, and everyone from a busser, to a waiter, or a bartender, was willing to chat with me about the food and take my order if needed. The decor is spot on for a brunch place, clean and well organized, the staff polite and skilled, and the fellow customers were a joy to be around.\\n\\nSo let's talk food, since that's why we're here. Would I wait for an hour to get a seat? Yes. Heck, I would wait two. The food is impeccable. When you order something home cooked it tastes home cooked. When you order something a bit more refined it has incredible layers of flavor. During my trip I had the french toast (absolutely divine, being sweet with over powering), the pork stew (beautiful layers of asian flavor, and hints of fresh herbs, with a delightfully sweet and savory pork), as well as the vanilla bean panna cotta. Everything paired excellently together, with the flavors dancing in my mouth. The coffee I sipped with it was that beautiful rustic coffee flavor, that did not over power any of the dishes, and the cream they provided was clearly fresh and had a silky mouth feel.\\n\\nThis establishment deserves every bit of it's 5 star notierity, and only the most deluded of foodies would say otherwise."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I have been to Southern Kin Cookhouse 3 times and the good news is that the food is excellent (drinks are good too with an extensive list)!

Hopefully you aren't too thirsty because you will be lucky if your waiter/waitress comes back to refill your water or provide you with another beer.  In the 3 times I have been here, I had to flag down an employee just to get more water.  I have never had a waiter/waitress come back to my table and ask how everything is.  \\n\\nFood comes out incredibly slow too, and the wait staff just makes it worse.  Even when the food is ready to be picked up it sits there for quite sometime before the employee grabs it from the kitchen.  Really strange.\\n\\nThe restaurant is overall just very poorly managed.

Yeah, I had curried noodles for breakfast, and they were still amazing. \\n\\nThey have a $10 minimum for CC's which kinda blows since I never carry cash nor do I want to lecture them on how it goes against most CC company policies.

Husband got a corned beef sandwich, and there was a ton of meat in there.  I wasn't that hungry, so I got noodle kugel and a side of kasha varnishkas.

I'm used to a \\"pareve\\" version that my folks made when I was a kid, so this was a bit of a shock to my system.  Still good, but took me 3-4 sittings to eat the whole thing (it was about the size of a brick, and very, very filling).  The kasha varnishkas were unforgivable.  There were two bowties in the whole side, and a ton of kasha (and carrots, never seen that in there before).  You can't call it kasha varnishkas without the varnishkas!!  Fail!!

Those are all very good!\\nThe reason I took a two stars off is the awkward, inefficient system they have for ordering and paying for food.  Upon entering Rize, you are greeted by someone at a large menu board in the entry way.  They offer to place your order for you but also give you the option of sitting down to order, which is kind of confusing in itself.  I feel that if you have to explain to every customer how to place an order, it's too complicated.\\nWe placed our order with the greeter then sat to wait for food.  Since you have no designated server, it felt like we had no one checking on us.  We waited a very long time for someone to swing by after our food arrived so we could ask for a missing balsamic drizzle. Then, when it was time to pay, it took an incredibly long time to pay our checks. The attendant took our cards one at a time, even though she was holding an iPad, to run them, and we weren't offered or provided any receipt. I wasn't sure whether to tip or not, given the low level of service provided. No one refilled our waters, no one offered another round of drinks, and no one offered dessert. There were more employees than patrons in the restaurant, so there was definitely no reason to leave any table unattended.\\nI think this restaurant would fare a lot better if they went with a traditional menu/server approach.  Ordering at the counter/via iPad degrades the ambiance and discourages patrons from ordering additional drinks (or desserts).  We were offered tastes of gelato when we entered, but nobody followed up on that when we were wrapping up the meal. Lots of upsell opportunities missed here and it creates an odd vibe."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"We were here for lunch on a Saturday.

I leave the details to the other reviews (which seem universally laudatory), but a few comments. \\n\\nFoie Gras Bon Bon = W.T.F.. Clearly a terrible idea, skillfully executed, but nevertheless, terrible. My throat felt slimed. The gelatin content on the thing must be close to 40%. I was advised by the wait staff to try it last but wish I had tried it not at all. The rest of the charcuterie plate was excellent.\\n\\nWine Pairing.  Wine and menu choices favored classic french (salad course came after the main dish). I particularly enjoyed the Ch√¢teauneuf Blanc (Domaine Texier) paired with the salad. The wine was well balanced, complex, electric and beautiful. And worked well with the acidity of the salad. The salad itself was carefully composed with \\"farmers greens(?)\\" -- bright hardy winter greens that stood up well to the vibrancy of the wine and the acidity of the blood and cara cara oranges. \\nThe only wine mis-pairing was the Lustau (Cuevo Jurado?) which is a pleasantly complex sweet dessert sherry with some bright green apple notes, that was unfortunately ill equipped to provide backing to a sumptuously rich, dense, apple, cinnamon, and calvados dessert. I would have preferred the obvious pairing of a calvados in this instance. Whoever is selecting wines is doing a great job. The pairings were otherwise flawless.\\n\\nNaomi Pomeroy and her staff did an excellent job and I look forward to an opportunity to return.

Owned by a lovely family who holds excellent customer service at its utmost importance! They offered us a sample of chicken shawarma (which was so deliciously juicy!) since we noticed their beef was sold out for the day, and they gave us the largest sample I'd ever received in any establishment! The sample was probably about 40g of shawarma! We could have left with our tummies satisfied, but since it was SO good, of course we ordered a Chicken Shawarma wrap and a Falafel wrap. I love how you can see your food being made, and the unlimited veggies/sauces options are awesome! Definitely get the pickled turnip, you can really taste how much flavour and kick it adds! Also, the creamy garlic sauce and tahini are a must! I personally preferred the Chicken Shawarma over the falafel, but both options are very tasty! Near the end of our meal, the son actually offered us a massive piece of Sweet Cheese Dessert! This had a nice light cottage cheese taste to it with pistachios as a layer on top. Definitely a very appreciated gesture and a great first impression made even more spectacular! We also had their bottled Mango drink which was very tasty! Nice and thick pur√©ed mango that was very refreshing, especially since the optional hot sauce we got with our wraps was actually spicy as the son had warned us it would be! Super affordable at $5.95 for the falafel wrap, $6.95 for the chicken shawarma wrap, and $1.65 for the mango drink. Upon leaving, the dad had a brief conversation with us about our travels to Orando and our life back in Canada.

I was thrilled anticipating the rebirth of Genoa and the introduction of Accanto. I imagined Accanto would be on par with many beloved, comfortable, quality SE restaurants - Navarre, Tabla, Cafe Castagna, Lauro's kitchen, Evoe to name a few. I want to love Accanto, I was ready to love Accanto, but the truth is Accanto is hugely disappointing. \\nAfter three openhearted and enthusiastic efforts to enjoy Accanto, here is my summary of the issues they must address if they wish to survive among this city's excellent restaurants: 1) Cocktails should be more than bits of fancy juice in pretty glasses. Alcohol must be added. Complexity and creativity at the bar is what brings people back. $8-10 for a cocktail should be a very good to excellent cocktail. Accanto bar manager, see Clyde Common and Beaker and Flask for some assistance in understanding 'very good to excellent cocktail.\\" And they charge you less than Accanto. 2) Tapas sized servings should be priced according to what is expected. In Portland, if a dish listed as an entree is priced at $14-16, one does not expect a tapas sized serving. 3) The food is mediocre. It's edible, but there is nothing standout or solid about any of the dishes. The only wonderful things on the menu are the desserts- and they are fantastic. So I suppose you could enjoy your experience at Accanto by avoiding dinner entirely and coming in late for a perfect tiramisu. I understand that Accanto is primarily a bar and may not have lots of space to work with, but check out the amazing quality of the food at little Evoe with staff working on hot plates. 4) Service was inconsistent. Friendly enough but not very skilled. There was an incredible delay between our appetizers and our entrees, and our waitress chose to deal with this by avoiding our table. \\nI hope Accanto decides to address these issues. They have a lovely space and lots of folks to draw from in the neighborhood to fill their seats. If they can improve, I will be happy to toast their success."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Love Tasty n Sons.

Amazing.  \\n\\nI usually skip the donut & bacon wrapped dates, yawn.  But I can't skip the decadent french toast, the Morrocan chicken hash, the Burmese Red Pork Stew, and my current obsession the breakfast board - simple - yogurt cheese, pate, apples, egg, jerky - but perfect.

Although I'm sure both parties were at fault (the server set it down dangerously close to the edge, and my slightly buzzed friend brushed past the platter when standing up to go the bathroom, they quickly moved to replace it free of charge, as it should be.

The batter on the chicken is okay but gets monotonous quickly; it was a bit soft but that isn't too bad - i'd rather have that than overly-crunchy batter.\\n\\nThe Mac & Cheese: it is way too oily for the level or flavor you get from it.  Maybe they used a mild cheddar?  It is probably baked, hence the amount of oil.  I love strong cheeses, like 3 year Gouda, Drunken Goat, etc., so these are just personal preferences.\\n\\nSome people might like this Mac & Cheese if they like milder cheese flavors.  Additionally, the oily style of this mac & cheese probably appeals to those that go to eat Fried Chicken, which is already deep fried.  However, if you like sides that contrast the main dish, skip the mac & cheese, or just order only the Mac & Cheese if you want something hearty (oily)  and mild flavored.\\n\\nNote: If you love Fried Chicken, add a star to the score above; I am reviewing this as a person that generally finds most fast food Fried Chicken too bland.  I grew up with Church's Chicken in the 80s and enjoyed it, but maybe my palate has changed.\\n\\nThere is a nice Southern-Fusion style restaurant in the midtown area that has a pretty good fried chicken i'd rate as a 3 for comparison purposes.  I've had some fried chicken i'd rate as a 4 - they were less oily; they were lightly-crispy instead of the normal crunchy texture; and they were slightly sweet and less salty."},{"name":"Kings Dining & Entertainment","address":"50 Dalton St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Wonderful dinner at King' s, Mac and Cheese bites, Ceasar salad, Bourbon Bay Scallops.

Other than that, this was a meal of abundance and flavor. I am especially happy to report that the food was not salty!! This is a pet peeve because it should always be the customer's preference to add additional salt but you certainly can't remove it if the chef oversalts the food. As far as the ambiance and comfort of the upstairs dining area where we were seated, it was bistro-like in that the space was tiny and perhaps too cramped. Our server (a true Bostonian gem!) actually had to stand in the stairwell of the spiral staircase in order to deliver some items to our table. He was obviously accustomed to doing this so no mishaps occurred. I also found the small wooden chairs getting increasingly uncomfy while we had our leisurely meal.

Fabulous on all accounts. Love the cozy Asian decor, service was friendly and informative, and the food was fabulous and reasonably priced, really tasty and unusual cocktails. For those who say the Happy Hour is limited I say REALLY? I don't even eat meat and I found enough to stuff myself. I had shrimp skewer - good but unremarkable, skewered taters - yum, skewered eggplant - honestly the BEST eggplant I have ever eaten, and roti and Dal - delicious and shared the cucumber relish. After all that and 2 cocktails (Cherry drinking vinegar with Vodka and a Scotch Sour) I craved more so I had another eggplant skewer and more roti and dal. All the food mentioned was $12.00 and I was happy as a clam. My husband and his Dad split a porkchop bun and had huge steaming bowls of Ramen and they were sated. The Ramen was $6 and the bun was $5 so they each had full tummies on $8.50 and they are both good eaters. So for those who complain about portions with these happy hour prices I am aghast. Ok so maybe you can get this stuff cheaper on the streets of Thailand and Vietnam but it's a helluva an expense getting over there. As to the Dal not being spicy enough - I thought it was subtle and delicious and with the addition of a few pickled Serrano peppers - perfect! Back to the Scotch sour - i am not a Scotch girl - I prefer white liquor but this is my new favorite drink.

Just in case you haven't gotten the point yet, let me put it this way: at $3.15 a pop, you can get a dish for less than a drink at Starbucks. \\n\\nUp until now, the only dim sum experience I've had has been the cart-type, which kind of freaked me out a little bit, especially since I never really knew what I was eating - not an ideal experience for a vegetarian.

Way less stress, way more deliciousness.\\n\\nI think we may have been a little too excited by all the desserts, because we ended up ordering three sweet dishes and three savory. Still, considering how good most of these were, there really is no shame in having dessert for dinner. Here's everything I tried, in order of how much I liked it:\\n\\n1. Custard buns - oh man, these were so good. If you only get one dessert (as I suppose most \\"normal\\" people do), this should be it. The custard was thicker than the pudding-type thing I usually associate with the word, but both the bun and the filling were so, so good. I wish more Chinese restaurants had these...\\n\\n2. Sesame balls with red bean paste - kind of like warm, fresh mochi. If you get two desserts, this should be the second!\\n\\n3. Steamed vegetable dumplings - With a thin paper-like shell, these were delicate and delicious. Perhaps a little too delicate, since they fell apart very easily...\\n\\n4. Scallion pancakes - these were really good for what they were, but they were also not super different from most Chinese restaurants' versions. \\n\\n5. Fried dough with vegetables - While I love pretty much everything fried, I found the shell on these to be a little too flaky. Of the two vegetable dishes we got, I preferred the dumplings.\\n\\n6. Sweet tofu - I'm not sure what I expected with this, but it was basically just a huge piece of super soft tofu drenched in syrup. Not bad by any means, but kind of unexciting. Also the only dish we didn't finish.\\n\\nI do wish they had a vegetarian congee option. Overall though, I'm really glad I finally got to check this place out!

I live in the neighborhood, don't hassle wait staff, and have the requisite amount of body art and \\"alternative\\" to my \\"lifestyle.\\"  Still it's like getting a bill passed through congress to get a drink order taken.

I understand that when you show up for brunch on a Sunday at 12:00 you aren't going to get the most attentive servers but ours forgot one of our drinks and the kitchen didn't put cheese on my omelette (considering it was one of three ingredients it was pretty noticeable) and it was lukewarm when it arrived.  \\n\\nSo all in all not very impressed.

It was the first place that my dad ever took my mom on a date, and I have been going here with my family since I was a little kid. We know the family who owns it and they have always treated us very well when we have gone here for dinner. Therefore, I will admit that my opinion might be biased.\\n\\nI really think that this is the best Italian food that you will find in Atlanta. Everything on the menu is a winner. They have always been good about using just the right amount of sauce and seasonings and cooking everything to perfection, which I think are the hardest things for a restaurant to get right.\\n\\nOne thing that I think separates Nino's from the other Italian restaurants that I have been to in Atlanta is their veal. It has always been tender enough to cut with a spoon. Veal should be prepared no other way, and Nino's is the only Italian restaurant that I have been to around here that gets it right. I love Alfredo's (an Italian restaurant that is right down the street from them and is almost as old), but not even their veal is as good (though I will admit that I like Alfredo's garlic bread better).\\n\\nI would be lying if I said that this place is cheap. It isn't. But they do bring you a pretty generous amount of bruschetta and bread and butter to start your meal.\\n\\nLast but certainly not least is the dessert cart. Over the years I have had probably everything on it: coconut cake, cheesecake, carrot cake, tiramisu, profiterole, flan, and a few others. They're all homemade and you can't go wrong with any of them.\\n\\nIf I have to say anything critical of Nino's it is that the portions are kind of small for the price. But then again, I am a big eater, so most people will probably still leave with a doggy bag.\\n\\nI still believe that this is the best Italian restaurant in Atlanta, so I recommend it for a date or a night out with friends and family.

The nachos consist of pork rinds instead of tortilla chips. It was crunchy and thick and salty and good. The dipping that came with it was pulled pork, beans, and cheese. It was not bad and probably the best part of the meal. The chicken and waffles was just a fail. The chicken was very dry. Not glistening like Chef Gordon Ramsey would like it. It was overly crispy- like a hard texture. My grandma would have had  a problem with chewing this. The waffles were soggy and had a mixture of a maple and a buttery taste but not in a good way.

It is an a quaint rapidly gentrifying area of Downtown Sanford which already has more charm in its fingernail than downtown Orlando has in its entire body. The location is a converted gas station and has tables inside and out and it smells fantastic.  I reached for the door eagerly, but much to my surprise at 12:30 on a Sunday I could not help but notice that there was not a single other guest online.

My lunch which consisted of two pulled pork sandwiches (the stuff is $1.49 a pound at Restaurant Depot) 3 sides and 2 drinks for $28. I don't necessarily have a problem with that but the sides are ridiculously tiny. There are also various other cost cutting measures that were apparent:  no lemons for the tea and no pickles or peppers available for the sandwich. The pulled pork was the best in Central Florida by a landslide. Johny Rivers would be embarrassed to put his really bad pulled pork in the same room with this.  Everything about it was perfect and they pull it as they prepare it.  The sides are literally served in thimbles other than the fries which are served in a big bag the same as Kansas City Joe's; however, the portion was literally 1/7 the amount. In fact, this was the most pathetic serving of fries I have ever been served in my entire life. The kicker was when I showed the bag to the completely clueless girl behind the counter and she looked at me like I had full blown aids. I would expect the serving to be part of a child's meal for children 5 and under. It now resonated loud and clear as to why a place with some of the best pulled pork I've ever had was completely empty. I hope and pray that the manager reads this and either fires himself or makes some necessary changes because it would be a pity to lose a place with this much potential.

Think of those Burger King crowns, but with paper feathers! Its true! Disposable paper headdresses & amazingly huge meals for a fair price all inside a classic theme diner from the 20s!

There are a couple of tables, but the place is mainly geared for take-out. Downsides so far are way too much batter on breaded entrees, resulting in an undercooked doughy flavor we'd rather pass by. Entrees are also accompanied by a deceptively large amount of fried rice, so you're not getting as generous a portion of entree as it first appears. Flavors of the entrees we chose were okay but not really very interesting. More spice can be requested, but I'm not sure if that will just make the dishes hotter. There's a full cooking staff here, so it appears they're prepared to make just about anything at any time. Our lunch specials took only 10 minutes from start to finish.\\n\\nMost credit cards are accepted and prices range from their lunch specials at $5.35, which includes a can of soda and fried rice with your choice of more than 30 entrees, to $4 and $5 pints and $7 to $9 quarts of individual entrees on the general menu, which is much more extensive. House specials range from about $9 to $13. Lots of appetizers and soups from which to choose, as well. There is also a small diet menu with steamed items, including a couple vegetarian. Everything's done New York style. Sorry, but I forgot to ask about whether they use MSG, but since the menu doesn't say, you might assume that they do. If so, perhaps it could be kept off your order upon request.\\n\\nOpen 7 days a week, starting at 11 a.m. M-S, noon on Sundays.\\n\\nOverall, they did a fairly good job for their first day.

I will also say that almost every appetizer selection contains seafood, so beware if you are non-fish eating vegetarians or just don't like seafood (me).\\n\\nFor dinner, my partner got the swordfish with lobster ravioli and bacon and I got the filet mignon. I really enjoyed my steak--it was juicy, well-seasoned, and generously sized--and the accompanying mashed potatoes were too buttery in the perfect way.

The swordfish did have this really nice citrus glaze, though.\\n\\nFor dessert, we split the nutella creme brulee with chocolate liquor whipped cream.

The chicken liver pate was beyond amazing. Came with a hard boiled egg (perfectly cooked), the liver, some bacon, some house made beef jerky, house made yogurt, pickled beets, fresh breads and some fresh Oregon berries. Perfect power breakfast. Also had to try the bacon wrapped date- so good although I'm usually not much of a date fan. The meaty almond in the middle and saltiness of the bacon really balanced the sweetness of the date. Hubby had the breakfast sandwich. Server recommended getting it with the Cajun meatloaf. Bomb.com. Served on a fresh, flaky biscuit. So satisfied. It will be a wait if you dont get their early but believe me, your taste buds are worth it."},{"name":"The North End at 4580","address":"4580 Broadway St, Ste D-1","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Great selection of gluten free options, and the food has been spot on every time.

Olentangy St. about 2 miles west of 315 and a mile east of the Columbus Zoo. It occupies the corner-area of a small strip of retail outlets. Parking is behind the building. Inside, LS is appointed with dark wood paneling - giving an authentic tavern feeling. There is a great patio on the north east corner of the building - one of my favorites in the area. The whole place is clean and comfortable. \\n\\nThe Food - My party shared a crab-dip and pita bread appetizer that was fantastic. I had the Royale with Cheese (a 1/2 lb. burger - and a great tip-of-the-hat to Pulp Fiction, my favorite movie) and fries, and those dining with me had the Hot Pastrami sandiwch and the Scallops Limoncello, respectively. They raved about their meals, and mine was quite good as well. The burger was well-cooked and well-seasoned. The fries reminded me of fair fries, and they were fantastic. Everything on the table tasted high quality, and I got the impression that the chef and cooks put a lot of thought and care into the menu and preparation of the offerings. \\n\\nI really like LS's menu. They've got a good selection of apps (calamari, small pizzas, hummus, shrimp, nachos, wings, bruschetta, etc.), soups and salads, sandwiches (tenderloin filets, turkey reuben, roast beef, walleye, salmon, etc.), entrees (ribs, chicken, fish and chips, paella, steak, and pasta dishes), and desserts (dessert martinis, after dinner drinks, a few cheesecakes, chocolate cake and carrot cake). They've also got a nice sized kids menu, and a host of choices for sides (fries, asparagus, slaw, roasted red potatoes, fruit, sweet corn risotto, green beans, cottage cheese, onion rings, potato hash, potato cakes, and chips and salsa). \\n\\nThe Drinks - LS has a GREAT drink list. They currently have 12 beers on tap (incl.: Bells Oberon, Dogfish 90 min. IPA, Kentucky Bourbon Ale and Saint Bernardus Wit Bier), 20 US bottles, 18 US Micro-brews, and 27 imports. For the math impaired, that's a 77-beer selection. They've got 20-or-so wines on the list, and a fair offering of mixed drinks/martinis and what they call \\"oddities,\\" (hard lemonade, Bacardi Raz, ciders, etc.). Overall, a FANTASTIC drink menu!\\n\\nThe Service - we were seated promptly, sat on the patio at our behest, and served promptly and effectively. No complaints. \\n\\nThe Price - sandwiches in the $7-10 range, entrees in the $10-19 range. Totally fair prices for the quality/quantity. \\n\\nOverall - I really have no choice but to give the Lost Shepherd 5 stars. The menu and food were fantastic, the drink menu was top-notch, the service was great, and the price was fair. I will return soon to see if they can keep up the awesome performance. I sensed a lot of thoughtfulness in the menu and service, and I expect they will remain a 5-star review in the future."},{"name":"Beast","address":"5425 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Simply the best that Portland has to offer for Sunday brunch."},{"name":"Proof and Cooper","address":"18710 Hamilton Pool Rd","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"We've been back to P&C twice since my last review..and have loved it both times.

My husband and I spent over $300 for a 4-course dinner for the two of us and the food and service didn't match the price.  \\n\\nThey ran out of a couple of the options, which was disappointing considering we had a reservation and this is such a tiny restaurant.  It doesn't seem like it would be that hard to estimate the amount of food they needed.  The $20 up-charge for the steak was a rip-off.  They didn't even ask how we wanted it cooked and it was chewy and had a lot of fat and gristle.  I had heard that this place had an \\"interesting\\" and \\"inventive\\" menu, but some of the flavor combinations were just off.  I had a gingerbread cake for dessert which came with an apple sorbet.  The icy texture of the sorbet just didn't work with the warm cake.  My main course was a risotto.  It was served in a tiny bowl and had virtually no flavor.  I was fine with the serving size, but the bowl itself made it look like a side dish and made it seem cheap.  \\n\\nIt took forever to get our food and our large group was not all served at the same time.  Some people were working on their main course while others were still eating their 2nd course.  My husband had finished his steak before my entree arrived.  \\n\\nWe also expected some sort of New Year's countdown, but there was nothing even though they advertised a New Year's celebration on their twitter account.  The final straw was them running out of champagne glasses and serving our champagne in cheap plastic champagne cups.  The whole thing just seemed like a joke.

I'd been wanting to try it for a while but every time I went to the Winter Park location, the line was out the door and I always ended up going somewhere else. So when I heard that the University location was opening, I was excited to give it a try. After all, with all the hype surrounding Four Rivers, how could it not be good?\\n\\nI'll tell you how.\\n\\nWhen my boyfriend and I got there, we were excited. It was spacious with a ton of seating and a whole wall of specialty sodas and artisan root beers. They're a little pricey, but were very tasty. Also, there was a very small line, but we did go around nine at night so that might have something to do with it. The people who were serving us were really exceptionally nice. They went out of their way to constantly bring us things and the service alone merited the two stars as opposed to the one almost gave. I ordered a pulled chicken sandwich and got fried okra and cornbread as my sides. \\n\\nFor the amount I paid, I expected a little better than to have my food placed on a lunch tray with a piece of paper that they also wrote on with crayon and permanent marker. I found this to be kind of gross and also found a hair on my tray, but since it wasn't touching my food, I disposed of it and tried to enjoy my meal. The sandwich itself was okay. The sauce is not nearly as good as everyone makes it out to be, but it is better than you'd get at Bubbalou's. The fried okra was awful. It tasted stale and over fried, like they had made the fried okra fresh a few days ago and then refried them today to try and pass them off. The cornbread was okay. It had jalape√±os baked into it and some kind of sugar glaze on top. It had a lot going on, but it was good.\\n\\nAfter we finished the food, we wanted to try some of their dessert, so we peeked at the bakery. They had a lot of cupcakes, which are simply not my thing (I can't get over the cake to icing ratio) so we opted for one of their dessert (mousse I want to say?) cups at the counter. We chose the peanut butter cup option. \\n\\nThis was simply disgusting. Do NOT get their dessert mousse things. The first bite I took I expected it to be whipped cream, but instead it was this whipped cream icing hybrid that was way too sugary. It also had these weird gelatinous pieces in it - think breast implant silicon gelatinous pieces. I thought it might just be the icing, and tried to just eat the mousse, but they were all over the dessert! It seriously grossed me out and I was done after two bites. My boyfriend took a few more bites and all of his had the gelatinous pieces as well and we ended up throwing away 3/4 of a dessert. It was a really awful ending to our dining experience.\\n\\nSo, all in all, it was okay. I still don't understand the hype surrounding this place, but it is better than its competitors.

Really dug the prices too - $3 for a single taco that's actually a decent size!\\n\\nI wound up feeling my way through the menu and stopped at the fish taco. I judge my taco joints by these delicious beauties, and luckily, Holy Taco came through for me. The tilapia was just crispy enough without feeling too fried, and the slaw really helped balance out the spicy sauce drizzled on top. Slaw is another thing you don't want to mess up in the south... you'll be happy to know that Holy Taco gets that right.\\n\\nOh, and those flour tortillas? Browned to perfection and so light and fluffy. Cloud 9? Yes please!\\n\\nI'd love to come back here and be a little more exotic in my choices (not to mention have an empty stomach), but it's nice to know it passed all the right tests with flying colors.

The service, the food, the seating is typically identical in each location.  With that said, I found this particular Panera to be less than satisfactory.\\n\\nFirst off, I don't like the seating.  While there may be a ton of tables, there are only about 4 booths in the entire place!  As someone who prefers booths to tables, I was not happy.  After getting my food, I saw an empty booth, and started to make a beeline for it when some girl practically assaulted me with her yoga mat trying to do the same (namaste?  no way.)\\n\\nThe staff was okay, at best.  The girl who checked me out was fine, although she was slow.  I told her my order, that I wanted it for here and that I wanted a small bag (I take the baguettes home to eat as a snack), and it took her about 5 minutes for what I said to register.  She also couldn't seem to figure out how to give me a bag.  Like, how hard is it?  Reach across to the freaking pastry area and get me a bag.  Apparently asking for a bag in Panera is equivalent to asking for a kidney in the real world.  I also wasn't to keen on the employee trying to solicite/hustle me over to the \\"new, electronic, do-it-yourself\\" machines rather than ordering at the counter.  I decide where I want to order, thank you very much.\\n\\nThen, to top it all off, what is with the portions in this place?  Forgiving the service and seating, I was given the smallest bowl of macaroni and cheese, and a BITE-SIZED baguette... and it was an end.\\n\\nAll in all, I was not happy at this Panera and will not be returning."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I went to college in a country town, Gainesville FL.

Street parking is there but you may need to walk 3 blocks. \\n\\nBottom line:\\nStill continues to be a go to for me. Food and service will keep you coming despite the wait.

The semi-recent expansion added seating space, but from what I've seen, the main event is still the main room or the patio.  Saints fans will find kindred spirits here during NFL season (just follow the bouncing ball to the gargantuan Saints helmet on the roof), and hardly would one would ever consider Shoal Creek to be anything but affordable, the service affable without waning twee.\\n\\nAnd maybe they are aiming for the Louisiana porch as opposed to the delectable trappings of the French Quarter.

They only gave her a box with the leftover white rice and the accompanying veggies.

Too bad for them and the idea of having tables outside during the summer.\\n\\nMore info according to our server.  The Picnic House has been around since last July.  Crazy.  Who knew?  Somebody did as there are a few reviews here.  He also told me that a bulk of their business is due to Yelp.  People (like us) doing Yelp searches and finding them that way.

Chimchurrie Beef skewers with pickled blueberries, arugula and avocado.  Nice sized platter for the price.  The beef had a ton of flavor and was cooked a nice medium.  I prefer medium rare, but I'm not going to be picky.  Due to a screw up by the kitchen we were also presented with a free stuffed Portobello Mushroom with roasted vegetables, caramelized onions and toasted polenta bread.  I don't know how it ended up at our table, but they told us if we didn't eat it it was just going to go in the garbage.  How does one turn that down.  This is an entree and it was quite large.  We took a good chunk of it home and had it for lunch the next day.
