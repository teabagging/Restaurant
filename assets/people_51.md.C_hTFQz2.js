Not only is it a full $2 more than the regular cannoli, but it is TINY. I'm talking the size and width of my pinkie finger tiny.\\n\\nAfter ordering my cannoli, the woman at the counter went back into the back to prepare it for me. I assume this is because of cross-contamination concerns with other cannoli shells. When she came back with what I can only describe as a \\"fun size\\" cannoli, I was dumbfounded. Was I supposed to actually pay $6.50 for this thing? If there had been 3 or 4 of them, I would've been satisfied, but ONE?! This was nuts. It tasted well enough, but Mike's is clearly the superior product.\\n\\nI'm glad more shops are including gluten-free options, but this one was an insult to my intelligence and frugality.

I also shared a blueberry pancake with my friend. She ordered the mushroom omelette. After a while our meals arrived and the presentation of mine made the meal appear to have been hastily prepared. There were four square biscuits drenched in sausage gravy and a couple eggs over medium (as requested) on the side. My first bite, and all of those that followed, made me think of salt. There was flavor to the dish, but it was mostly just salty. While I was very hungry and the portion was pretty big, I only finished about half of it. After a while the salt was just too overwhelming.\\n\\nThe blueberry pancake was sour and tough to cut through. I'm not sure where, if any, the taste of blueberry was. My friend found her mushroom omelette to be pretty lackluster as well and she did not enjoy her potatoes that it was served with though I can't remember why at the moment.\\n\\nNeedless to say, our experience here definitely felt short of my expectations. Perhaps it's due to the volume of people that come to Mother's, but all the food tasted as though it was made with haste and the ingredients did not seem of high quality.

The menu boasts an upscale gourmet Italian restaurant, but the ambience, wait staff, and ultimately food is really only slightly above average.\\n\\nAppetizer: Wood grilled tiger shrimp, topped with chevre, arugula edible garnish. + 1 glass sauvignon blanc \\"petit bourgeois\\"\\n\\nI ordered the Tiger Shrimp appetizer, as it was reviewed positively on Yelp by others.  I generally agree.  First, the basics: Cleaned and deveined well; cooked to proper temp and tenderness.  One shrimp looked brutally be-headed, rather than trimmed, but the rest looked pretty.  Presentation was simple - bed of arugula, 5 (U-8-10-ish sized) shrimp.  Second, the flavor: very lightly grilled, letting the natural salty and mildly sweet flavor of the shrimp come through.  Too little chevre topping - one shrimp was missing it - but since I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese in general, I didn't mind. \\n\\nVery good wine (sometimes I'm worried about ordering glasses of wine), but this one was fresh, crisp, and nicely complemented the shrimp app.\\n\\nMain Course: Lamb Loins; Bucatini\\nMy bf ordered the lamb loins - grabbed a  taste.  Cooked medium-well, flavored nicely.  Creamy Parmesean polenta was the favorite.  Smooth, cheesy, corny... yummy. \\n\\nBucatini was a bit too soft (would have liked it cooked a minute-30 less).  Creamy vodka sauce was ok, a bit too thin for my liking.  \\"Baked pancetta\\" was fabulous - crispy on the outside, browned just enough to caramelize the natural sugars of the pork, boasting great \\"bacon flavor sans the smokiness\\".  Spring onions were crunchy and tender, but the slicing was irregular and not uniform. \\n\\nTheir onion and parm bread was chewy and good.  Their olives were plump and almost \\"grapey\\".. pretty good.  \\n\\nI almost skipped the olives because the guy at the front who sat us, went to move our table first before seating us - grabbing the feet of the table with his hands, and then didn't wash his hands before handling the little dish to put the olives in them.  But I saw that he held the dish from the bottom, so I figured the olives would be safe to eat.  Next time, he really should make better use of the mini sink that is right next to the olive bowl, and keep things clean!\\n\\nOur server was courteous and enthusiastic, but perhaps over-selling the special (\\"beautiful looking fish - cod crusted in mashed potatoes\\"; \\"for dessert, I can't wait for this...(dramatic pause)... is passionfruit sorbet!\\").  I passed on these, but next time, I may try their \\"osso busco\\" made with a pinwheel short rib and creamy polenta. \\n\\nThe wait staff generally seemed enthusiastic and courteous -- a plus -- but their choice of jeans and their very casual hair sent me mixed signals.  I wasn't sure if I was there to order a burger, or to get some fine Italian dining. \\n\\nThe teeny tables are fine, but the chairs a bit uncomfortable, and the decor inside definitely needs to be updated to be more contemporary.\\n\\nOverall, this teeny restaurant tries to bring in the look and feel of an upscale Boston restaurant, but in trying to be more fitting for where it is, it results in an odd hybrid of trying to fit into Waltham."},{"name":"Sushi Garden","address":"4269 Lougheed Highway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"Food quality is good.\\n\\nStaff isn't very welcoming or engaging.\\n\\nBut this place is constantly busy and they do move the flow of food and people quite efficiently.\\n\\nIt's a great spot for sushi and we are returning for sure."},{"name":"Mad Hatter","address":"969 Washington St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4","text":"How many times have I been up and down this road and never once noticed this gem?

The restaurant itself is like Cheesecake Factory with a WAY cooler theme & decor, & more enticing desserts. \\n\\nThe Pros:\\n- Entree portion sizes are good, fair size for the reasonable price.\\n- Food quality is fine. Selection seems like they are catering to a basic theme park palate. A few standouts, but nothing out of this world.\\n- Cocktail menu is interesting. Aside from the dessert menu, it's really the stand-out of the menu. Have some unique concoctions. The chocolate whiskey is worth checking out. More like a liqueur. Only recommendation, ask for \\"light on the ice\\". They are generous with the ice, & if the place is packed & you have to wait for your drink, it'll be watered down.\\n- Brunch menu available all day.\\n- The retail store is fun. A little pricey, but ok. Have some interesting selections with the higher-end lollipops & cotton candy, Victorian-ish hats & decorations, & small bakery/dessert selections.\\n- The steampunk theme is original & thorough. Great idea. Perfect for a restaurant outside of a theme park. It's fun for both kids & adults. \\n\\n\\nThe Cons:\\n- The wait time is long, & it seems like they haven't figured out a way to manage the lines. The line to put your name in snakes right into the revolving door, & pushes up against the lines for shakes & the other line retail. It's offputting to walk three lines & a crowd of people trying to figure out where to go. Once they called us in, they asked us to wait again in a smaller crowded area. They have a good notification-via-text system, so we're not sure why they couldn't just text when the table is actually ready.\\n- They are missing an opportunity to really stretch the \\"cooking w chocolate\\" theme. The pork chops are made with a mole, & that seems like the height of the experimentation. The chocolate bread appetizer is worth it. But most of the menu is casual dining fare. I realize the more adventurous they get, they might lose people, but they do a good job of highlighting unique recipes with the cocktails. They would standout if they applied the same ingenuity to the entrees.\\n- There's an area where you can see staff preparing the decadent shakes. A good idea, except staff looks like they're still learning ( a lot standing around) & the clientele can see small flies of some kind flying around all the sweets. Probably harmless, but not appetizing.\\n- If you care about theme narrative, the \\"plot\\" doesn't make complete sense. I don't believe diners would even think about a plot if wasn't on the 1st page of the menu & highlighted by the waiter. I'm guessing they need a plot to justify the lady character who goes around. There's another character, a sort of robot, that works much better & doesn't need a storyline bc it fits the theme perfectly.

Walked in to a not-so-friendly hostess.  I asked about carry out and she dismissed me to the bar.  No problem, maybe she missed her homework assignment at UT.  Bartender gave me a menu and I grabbed a beer while I waited.  Ordered 2 meals, Smoked Chicken and hot links sausage.  A few sides - corn, beans and waffle fries.  Food came out fast and smelled great.  The only problem? $74.00 tab.  Yikes. Again, no problem, I'm sure it's pretty good for that price.  Got it home and the hot links were full size (non cut) sausages, and the smoked chicken was more like a rotisserie as it was still on the bone.  Beans and corn were ok, nothing special.  All in all, considering what I could have had for $74.00 elsewhere, I would rate Lamberts as an Austin original that gets away with the price due to past reputation.  Much like Amy's Ice Cream."},{"name":"Banana Leaf","address":"820 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I was really looking forward to having my first meal at Banana Leaf and am a huge fan of Malaysian Food.

The movie got out around 2:00 PM, and we were starved but wanted to find something beyond the chain restaurants in the immediate vicinity (Chili's, Macaroni Grill, Bertucci's).  A few miles and a couple of turns brought us to Wakefield on the steps of Duck Walk.  We all love Thai, so in we went.\\n\\nThe decor is fun with patio umbrellas on the inside and tiki-type decorations.  The dining room is spacious and only a few tables were taken so our party of 4 was seated right away.  It was a hot summer day, and when we first walked in the air conditioning felt good, but after a while it felt stuffy and I noticed our water glasses sweating.  Three of us got chicken and rice dishes and one friend ordered a noodle plate.  (Interestingly, they were out of DUCK!  At DUCK WALK!)  I ordered the cashew chicken with brown rice, which was sweet and savory, with pineapples, mushrooms, peapods, and onions.  I hate onions, and there were so many!  The taste was good but nothing to write home about; I like spicy Thai food, and I while I didn't order a particularly spicy dish I expected a bit something more.  Portions were a bit small - I ate mine up and wished there were more.  Service was quick and friendly; our dishes came out right away, our water glasses were always full, and our waiter was accommodating, bringing chopsticks and our check promptly when we were ready to go.\\n\\nI am never in this area and the food was a bit blah, so I probably won't come back.  However, if this place were in my neighborhood, I could see it being a good weekday takeout place.  I'd also feel comfortable recommending this to anyone looking for a good non-chain choice near the IMAX."},{"name":"Big City Burrito","address":"2426 Arapahoe Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"Authentic, tasty burritos with surprisingly good ranch dressing.

Here's a review from someone who lives in the neighborhood. Be sure to read to the end of this review where I'll give you some tips on what to order and how to survive the line at Mike's. I'll also throw in a few other North End tips. \\n\\nFirst, let me say that Mike's is not a tourist trap; it's the real deal. There's a reason why Mike's consistently has a line that's 10x as long as Modern's: it's better. With that being said, Modern's has a really good Cannoli, too. If I were stranded on an island, I would prefer Mike's, but Modern's would also make me really happy. The bottom line is that they're both really good, but different. Modern's has a filling that is not as thick, and their shell is more uniform, smaller, and has a texture that is sort of like a cookie. Mike's has a shell that is rough, huge, and sort of like a really good homemade pie crust with lots of textual inconsistencies. \\n\\nNow, I have bone to pick with a common complaint I hear about Mike's. Some say that Modern's is superior because they fill their cannoli shells upon order, whereas Mike's does not. Yes, typically a cannoli should be filled upon order. This keeps the shell from getting soggy. BUT, this point is completely IRRELEVANT to Mike's because Mike's moves their cannolis off the shelf so quickly that it's equivalent to filling them upon order! I've eaten Mike's more times than I can count, and I can tell you that I've never had a soft or soggy shell. Mike's thicker shell, and probably their thicker than usual filling, is also likely helpful in preventing the sogginess factor. \\n\\nModern's shell, in all honesty, reminds me of the pre-made shells that are used by many Italian bakeries who don't make their own shells. I do like their filling, however. It's soft, kind of gritty, and overall a pretty mellow filling with a nice, smooth taste of ricotta. I prefer Mike's filling, however, because of its thickness, its texture, its strong ricotta influence, and the slight lemon tang. My hunch is that fresh lemon juice is their secret ingredient. Next time you have one, see if you can taste the lemon (I'm comparing, by the way, the original or choc chip cannolis, both have the same filling; one simply has choc chips added to the filling on the ends). \\n\\nOk, I admit that a major problem with Mike's is that due to the crowds you usually can't see what's in the cases, and therefore you likely feel rushed when it comes time to order. If you're from out of town, here's a list of what you MUST order, followed by a list of recommended items:\\n\\nMUST ORDER\\n\\n1.) Traditional (plain) or chocolate chip cannoli (I prefer the chocolate chip). While the other flavors are good, they don't give you an authentic cannoli experience. If you're new to the cannoli world, you need to have the original or chocolate chip, so that you can compare all future cannoli experiences to it. If you order the other flavors, fine, just be sure to order at least one of the originals. I've heard New Yorkers in the line at Mike's say that Boston has them beat in the traditional cannoli department. \\n\\n2.) You must order a lobster tail. Just do it (It's a huge, lobster tail shaped cream puff pastry). \\n\\n3.) You must order a rum baba cream pastry. This rum-soaked pastry is divine. \\n\\n4.) You must order several pistachio macaroons. I often have a hard time deciding between a cannoli and a pistachio macaroon. The pistachio macaroon will send you straight to macaroon heaven. Mix in a few other macaroons just for fun. \\n\\nRECOMMENDED ORDER\\n\\n1.) Marzipan. I've never had it as good as I've had it at Mike's. \\n\\n2.) Slice of Boston cream pie. Amazing! \\n\\n3.) Slice of chocolate fudge cake. \\n\\n4.) Slice of carrot cake.\\n\\n5.) The cheesecake is really good, too. \\n\\nOTHER MIKE'S and NORTH END TIPS\\n\\n1.) There is NOT one line. There is a line for each person behind the counter. So, if you're brave enough, walk right in past the line, and fill in to the left of the store where people frequently do not line up. The workers get annoyed when people stand in a single line when there are multiple lines. \\n\\n2.) Don't get up to the counter and still not have any idea what to order. This will only frustrate you and the workers. \\n\\n3.) Engage in some friendly small talk with the person who helps you and there's a good chance she'll throw in a free macaroon or two. I've had this happen numerous times. Also, give a tip. These people, although super busy and sometimes seemingly unapproachable, are actually really nice. You'd be slow to be super friendly too if you had to deal with what can sometimes be annoying tourists all day long. \\n\\n4.) If the weather's nice, go eat your food in one of the many parks in the North End. My friends and I often hung out on the greenway in front of the the North End. Don't stand in front of Mike's and eat. It kind of takes away from the overall experience. Or, go to Thinking Cup cafe on Hanover, order an espresso drink, and eat there. \\n\\n5.) Maria's Pastry is really good as well."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"best cannoli ive ever had.  \\ni tried the peanut butter one and was thrilled.  the best is the florentine!\\nperfectly sweetened ricotta.\\ntook a dozen home with me to give to friends!"},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Had the crab cake sandwich for lunch, which was delicious and served with fries, cole slaw and a pickle.

Methinks NOT. Oh god. That odor.\\n\\nMy friend and I stopped by this place today, he wanted a fruit smoothie and I wanted some coffee. Upon entering, we were both hit in the face and gut with the most vomit inducing odor I have ever smelled. Much Worse than the open buckets used for human waste composting (they were outdoors, so the smell wasn't that bad), and slightly worse than the carpet at my partners old apartment that you were never able to get the smell of layers of cat urine out of no matter how many times you steam cleaned them. That bad. I instantly held my breath and waited in line, surveying my options, wondering two things:\\n\\n1) What the HELL could that smell be?\\n\\n2) Why the hell were my friend and I the only ones who were able to smell it?\\n\\nThere were people working, studying all around us. It wasn't packed, but it wasn't empty. The seating was comfortable, and the shop itself was very clean. While waiting forever for the person in front of me to finish deciding between sugar free, powdered mixes, cream, etc.,  I noticed that the barista behind the counter was the same guy whose face was on all the food items on display. The pizza. The brownies. The cookies. Chef something or other. Anyway, finally after holding my breath for a really long time, I get my iced coffee and jet out of there. I didn't want to breathe through my nose, though, because there is always that scent that you have to inhale from the last thing you smelled, and I really didn't want to have to smell that again, but I did it. I inhaled. And it was bad, but passed. Then I tried to drink the coffee, but realized that it tasted the way that the inside of Kick Butt Coffee smelled. So which came first, I wondered. Did the flavor of the iced toddy (black ice) left to brew for a long time absorb the scent of the coffee shop, or did the coffee make the shop smell like that as it brewed. While sitting outside in the heat, continuously swatting at bees, I decided to put the coffee to good use, since I wasn't able to drink it. I took the lid off and hoped the bees would want the coffee more than myself, but alas, twas not to be. My friends smoothie was syrup and ice. You could see the syrup still floating in the bottom of his cup. Purple flavored, apparently. He lamented about missing the smoothies he would order in Mexico, seven different kinds of fresh fruit and ice, right in front of you. Delicious. Sadly, the smoothie was a let down for him. We looked around for trash cans or recycling bins to dispose of the cups, but discovered that the only ones were inside Kick Butt Coffee. We couldn't bring ourselves to go back inside, so we just took the cups to my house and disposed of them there. \\n\\nI remember going to this place a few years back, and it didn't smell, and was pleasant and alright enough.

I wonder why... They advertised a 12 minute express lunch but we didn't order from that side of the menu so I can't comment.\\n\\nFood was really good; had the chicken and waffles and it was delicious! Most people loved their food, so the food is not an issue.\\n\\nWhat the issue was (and it's a big one), was the terrible lack of service! After the food was served, our server disappeared despite our request to bring out the cake we brought in! Also, there's a $25 cake fee which we thought was ridiculous for a small little restaurant. The manager was nice enough to waive it if we ordered some desserts. In total, it took the server 50 minutes to bring out our cake with candles on it because she disappeared and NO OTHER SERVERS would help us, not even the manager?!?! It's clear we are all waiting for something but nobody would approach us except tell us our server was coming (she was not). \\n\\nTerrible management. What kind of a restaurant manager doesn't get other servers to help out? I understand everyone gets tables but the restaurant wasn't full, it wasn't busy despite being prime lunch hour, and the manager didn't help us nor did any other servers. I don't place the blame solely on the server but I spread this lack of service to the entire way the restaurant is run; it must be a top down strategy that causes other servers not to lend our own server a hand. They need to change this. This is probably why despite the delicious food, the restaurant is empty. \\n\\nIt also took another 40 minutes for us to get our bill.  We all started putting on our jackets to show how impatient we were and even then our sever or the other servers and manager never came by!! Ridiculous. In total, I would come again but only if I have 2.5 hours to spare because that's HOW LONG LUNCH TOOK!!\\n\\nI would give zero stars for service but 5 stars for food, hence the averaged 3 stars in total. \\n\\nPreston's please change your restaurant management strategy.

It hasn't even reached its one-year anniversary yet, but it's safe to say that it has already made a strong impression on the clientele. The dishes on their menu sound very appetizing, but I still underestimated just how delicious the food would be.\\n\\nWhen I got there, I was seated immediately even though the others hadn't arrived yet. This was a move that I appreciated. The server appeared right away but let me take my time poring over the menu while waiting. Everything looked fantastic, but I decided on the Mister T - a sandwich starring wagyu sirloin, avocado aioli, greens, and bleu cheese sauce. The sandwich also includes french fries, stuffed inside with the other fixings, which only makes the whole thing better. The sandwich looked pretty small when it arrived, but believe me, it turned out to be filling. Pardon the lame obvious joke, but I pity the fool who doesn't try this sandwich at some point. The sirloin was juicy and tender, and for sliced steak in a sandwich it was one of the most rewarding I've had. The avocado aioli was delicious, of course, making every bite wonderful, and the bleu cheese brought that extra punch. The fries were a perfect add-in, with a pleasant roasted flavor that didn't distract from the main attraction. Even the artisan bread classed it up, and was crisp and tasty. This is one mean sandwich, appealing to the eyes, mouth, and stomach.   \\n\\nThere's almost as much to say about the restaurant's appearance and location as there is to say about its food. On a stretch of Airport Blvd that's now booming with diverse eateries, Sala & Betty has made itself stand out from the crowd. It starts with the large, appealing sign out front to announce its worthy presence, and continues with an aesthetically pleasing exterior that's a bit rustic and sports a patio that must be nice to enjoy on warm afternoons. Once you get inside, the aesthetics are even more inviting. It manages to be upscale and laid-back at the same time: Big open dining area, a hip bar that features a good deal of pristine wood paneling, stylish tables and lots of windows. It made for a seriously relaxed, quieter dinner atmosphere where you feel like you've moved up in the world, while still dining on a feasible budget.\\n\\nAlso, a shout-out to the excellent service. Our host and server were both very friendly and attentive, and made sure we were enjoying the meal without bothering us. Our server gave us a full rundown on her menu recommendations, and though I chose something different, I will definitely be back for their supposedly famed fried chicken and biscuits.

If you haven't tried it, you should, because you might be surprised to find that Columbus can actually be that cool. And it's something that's totally unique to this city.\\n\\nGallery Hop is essentially just arts galleries and bars and restaurants along High Street opening their doors so you can pass through if you wish - it's not really anything that you can't do any other night of the week. Sure, there's sometimes special events going on and CD101 is usually set up somewhere, but Gallery Hop is about getting out and enjoying what Columbus' local businesses have to offer. It was a great idea and a great way to help keep these small businesses alive, because people who might never otherwise check out any of these small art galleries or clothing stores now are.\\n\\nWhat I like about Gallery Hop is the people. It's pretty crowded, but I live right by the Short North, so it's great to see so many different kinds of people out there all enjoying themselves together. You'll find everything from homeless people out there having a good time, to the wealthy people who can actually afford to buy the art in the galleries. And somehow it all works.\\n\\nGallery Hop is really what you make it. You can personalize it to be the kind of experience you want it to be. You can just hit the art galleries, or just go bar hopping, go out to eat and hang out in one of the restaurants and watch the people walk by, or what I usually do is just walk the length of Gallery Hop and just see where it takes me.\\n\\nAnother cool thing is that street performers will play here and there and you wonder where all these people came from. All of the sudden, on the first Saturday of every month, Columbus comes alive with such a vast array of culture. It's really quite exciting.\\n\\nGallery Hop is free and it's something for couples, friends, families, or you could even go it alone. Just end up in the Short North on the first Saturday of the month and you're there. I'm lucky because I live so close that I can just walk, but driving around during the event isn't easy. There's a lot of traffic and parking is an issue. I think that most people have to end up parking on a side street and then walking to get to High St.\\n\\nIt's great in the summertime and warm weather because since it's so comfortable outside, you really feel like you can enjoy yourself. But unfortunately, everyone else has the same idea you do, so good luck getting a patio seat anywhere in the Short North during Gallery Hop. The wintertime can always be fun. Around Christmas there's all kinds of pretty lights and decorations and trees, but it gets so cold that the galleries and bars all get really crowded because people just want to get warm. But random people will start fires in big trash bins and I remember one time, while Gallery Hopping with some friends in December, we stopped to roast marshmallows with some friendly people in a (safe) contained fire they had started. Certainly not what I thought I'd be doing on a Saturday night, but that's the beauty of Gallery Hop: it's all randomness and spontaneity.\\n\\nGallery Hop happens every month, rain or shine. The galleries and shops all close around 10, but the restaurants and bars stay open much later, so you could make a whole night out of it if you wanted to. It's a really fun experience, but be prepared for a parking nightmare, lots of walking, and long waits and crowds.

We were told about the osso bucco. What we ordered I do not really remember (one of us probably ordered the osso buco), but what we did remember about this place was the amazing Caesar salad with its fantastic anchovies and fried parmesan cheese \\"cracker\\" on top, and the creme brulee.\\n\\nWe came back a few times over the years since (metro Boston has so much going for it food wise, it is hard to get back to anywhere often when you are trying to savor the local varieties, and Waltham certainly has its many contributors), and always ordered the Caesar and something delicious, but not particularly memorable, but solidly good. And end our dinner with a creme brulee.\\n\\nTonight we came back to honour our first date, and have to say, I am not sure if it is my memory of what I thought the place was, based on everything that went into my first experience, or if it really was that good then; because it really is not that good now. It is not terrible, but I had such great memories of what I thought it had been.\\n\\nTonight we started by ordering the Caesar, only to be told when we requested extra anchovies that they don't put anchovies on the salad, and when mentioned that we had anchovies last time, were told that they don't have anchovies to put on the salad (which begs the question...do they not make the dressing then? Anymore or did they ever?) I asked if they still did the fried parmesan cheese? No, not any more. We were heartbroken, but we remembered that all our other food had always been solidly good here.\\n\\nWe ordered instead two appetizers: Wood Grilled Calamari (with spicy tomato sauce and herbs) and their Shrimp and Corn Arancini (served with lemon basil aioli). Starting with the calamari, the name should have been Green salad with wood grilled calamari. It is a small side salad over a bed of stewed tomato (very mildly spiced) with a few bits of tasty calamari. It seemed obvious that cost was an issue, but not in the price at $9. Next came the interestingly named Arancini. I could not find or taste the shrimp. Actually you couldn't taste the corn or rice either. What you could taste was the fried-ness, bluntly tempered with aioli. Not sure I tasted lemon or basil in it, but they may have been busy fighting off the losing battle of fried-ness I was experiencing. Lest I remind you that you could see the corn kernels speckled in the rice ball the same way you often see corn kernels the next day...$9 for three of these small guys, so $3 each. So not worth it.\\n\\nFor our entree we ordered the Wood Grilled Lamb Steak (with Broccoli Rabe pesto and Garlic Roast Potatoes). Again, I go to what we remembered, which were generous portioned entrees, and we didn't remember ever taking anything home. Since we are trying to eat healthier (we eat out way more than we should) we shared our entree. We requested the steak be medium rare. They did plate for two without charging us a sharing fee as some places do, but the plating was awfully composed, and the portions tiny (again, cost kept coming to mind, not price) which was even more pronounced in the tinier half portions sitting on our respective plates. Each part of our meal, the lamb steak, the potatoes, the grilled tomato and the broccoli rabe pesto each sat in a separate corner of the square plate, as if they were afraid and didn't want to play with each other . The medium rare we requested was rare in the middle, but tough and chewy on the outside with allot of grisly fat. Not a great cut of meat, and flash fried too high a heat (what happened to wood grilled?) that over cooked the outside and under cooked the inside. The potatoes were also over cooked. The balsamic vinaigrette reduction was a nice add, and the pesto was good and complimentary to the meat. It too deserved a better piece of meat. The grilled tomato was flavourless and seemed lost on the palette, an unnessesary extra.\\n\\nAfter this, well I contemplated whether or not to get the creme brulee. I have a certain softness for creme brulee. I am lactose intolerant, and even with lactaide have to decide how much discomfort I am willing to endure for a food; but creme brulee I always succumb too. Here, as I had remebered in the past, they have not changed their mastery of the brulee. The creme part, not so much. The crust was hard, thick, crisp and carmelized to perfection. The creme part was just not there, in flavour. Kind of like the white stuff you get at a Dairy Queen; you think it is vanilla soft serve, but it is really just white embodiment. That is what the creme part does here, it is just a creme embodiment for the fabulous brulee. Still worth getting just for that though...mmmmmmmm.\\n\\nOur server was good.

It didn't have the creamy cheese sauce on it.  It reminded me of Indian biryani with chicken and vegetables mixed in with the rice, and the rice was yellow colored much like the saffron rice in biryani.

I'm a single burger kind of gal, but you need to order a double here to really have a meal. The first time I visited, I got a single with cheese and mushrooms and it seemed a wan thing--all bun, a little dry and just not much to sink your teeth into. I have subsequently ordered doubles with plenty of toppings and been satisfied. The hot dogs, both the regular beef and the Kobe--are excellent. Fries are really good and generously doled out.\\n\\nDrinks are too expensive. For two-seventy-something you get a plastic cup (I'm guessing 16 ounces) which you can fill with soda from Burger-Fi's Freestyle machine (dozens of different drinks emanate from one spout on a single machine). Fine, I suppose, if you're dining in and refill your cup a few times. But almost three bucks for a soda to go? Kudos for having wine and beer available.

I have found my pizza from there and I can't order anything else.  It's the Joe Boli pizza on their white sauce.  This pizza is like heaven.  The base is a white, garlic cream sauce (all though you can get the red sauce too) topped with their spinach mixture and then covered in cheese.  Their pizza dough is a flat crispy dough New York style.  But, what sells me on this pizza is the spinach mixture.  I don't know what they do to it, but it is amazing.  I think it pan fried with cheese, garlic, oil and probably some other seasonings.  But, it's off the chain!!!  I have ordered it with chicken before, but the chicken seems to be dry compared to the rest of the pizza and takes away from the spinach.  Honestly, this pizza does not need anything added to it -- I was just trying to get more protein.  I always order this pizza as is and it is a winner!  I get a large so I can have it for multiple days.  \\n\\nA friend of mine and I went and ordered the The Canarsie Killer pizza and added jalape√±os.  This was also a really good pizza.  It's a lot of meat for me and I did miss my spinach.  ;)  The jalape√±os were fresh (not pickled) and very hot!  Which I love hot stuff and she does too so that was fine with us.\\n\\nI have also ordered the Antipasto Chiarelli and this thing is huge.  You can easily feed 2, if not 3, people from this salad.  We had it with the creamy garlic dressing which was the best!  \\n\\nThe service is always great and they will make recommendations if they feel you are not heading in a good direction -- which I love and wish more places did that."},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I must confess...I have a dessert obsession.

From the outside the restaurant looks like nothing special, walked in to what seemed like a chaotic night for the people working there, almost as if they were operating over capacity. We were seating fairly quickly, which was nice, albeit the fact that it was very crowded. \\n\\nService:  We did not have one server assigned to us, rather, it was just grab the attention of whoever was walking by. Once we were seated, we ordered hot tea which came almost immediately. We then had to wait for the server to return to order food, which we were ready to order immediately. I also had to ask for water, which was surprising as all of the other tables had water pitchers so that patrons could help themselves. Any time we needed anything we would have to get the attention of the server which was quite annoying, they did not come over once to ask if everything was okay. I ordered an appetizer (soup) which did not come, and I had to order once again through another waitress. Not a great experience. \\n\\nAtmosphere:  The surrounds are nothing to rave on about, average, slightly dated furnishings and colors. I think this place is more about the food than the surroundings and service. I felt slightly uncomfortable sitting on a seat which was in the path of the servers as it was very cramped. There were consistently people standing in the doorway waiting to be seated, and the door was constantly being opened. I brought in a chill as well as the smell of smoke from outside which was unpleasant. \\n\\nFood:  I had Vegetable Hot & Sour Soup, Vegetarian Hakka Chow Mein and Chili Fish. The server asked me if we liked our food spicy (of course!) and I was not disappointed with the kick it had. The soup I had was not very good, for being a \\"Vegetarian\\" version of normal Hot & Sour soup, it was lacking in substance, mostly just shredded carrots and chestnuts or bamboo (? I'm not really sure what it was). Overly vinegary, I could feel my stomach burning with the acidity of it which was overwhelming, although this is nothing new, I have experienced this kind of vinegar soup before at other restaurants. The stars of the show were the Chow Mein as well as the Chili Fish, normally when I have Chinese food I find it very bland and lacking it spicy hotness. These main dishes were done perfectly, fish was tender and almost melted in my mouth and the Chow Mein was very flavorful. At the end we got fortune cookies which is always a nice touch to be presented with the bill. \\n\\nDrinks: Ordered hot Green Tea and water. The tea was standard loose leaf green tea served in a pot, tasted very authentic and was just the right temperature. Also, tap water in Vancouver is not bad at all, normally I do not like drinking tap water but it's good! I didn't have anything else but it appeared that they had a selection of Chinese as well as Indian Lagers. \\n\\nRestrooms:  Average, wasn't the cleanest of places I have been but at least there is a restroom, and there was a choice of bar soap or liquid soap.\\n\\nOverall:  Good, for my first experience with Indian Style Chinese food I was quite happy with the main courses that I ate, spiciness on point. The service is not the best, I guess when they say they have Indian-Style Chinese food they also have Indian-Style service (disclaimer: I am Indian). It was busy so I will give them the benefit of the doubt. \\n\\nTip: If I was to come back I would probably just order take-out and steer clear of the Vegetarian Hot & Sour soup."},{"name":"Donna's Cakes","address":"100 Spring St","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"4.5","text":"Finally had a cake from here after hearing all the great reviews.

It doesn't seem to be as hyped up as Mike's but if you walk around the North End, you'll see boxes from both places.\\n2. Cannoli - Smaller.  What my friends liked most about this was the shell because it was not flakey and didn't crumble everywhere.  It was still crisp but broke nicely with each bite.  The filling is on the creamier side and feels smooth to the touch.  I couldn't taste as much cheese.\\n\\nUltimately, it's up to your personal preference.

The pork and chicken fried were crisp and fresh, the jellyfish regular with sesame oil, and the beef heart was delicious with a bit of soy sauce. Best part of the dish: the BBQ pork was juicy, and well marinated.  All at the table agreed it was the best part.\\n\\nSecond course: Fried crab claw balls.  Pretty standard.\\n\\nThird course: Seafood in a bird's nest.  The birds nest.. not so much a taste of taro at all, just flour crisply fried.  Best part - the inside, where strips of squid, mushrooms, vegetables, shrimp, scallops, and alabone were delicately presented.  Excellent taste.\\n\\nFourth course: Shark fin soup.  A little bit shredded, but not bad.\\n\\nFifth course: Peking chicken with shrimp chips.  Tasty, although the white meat was a bit dry.\\n\\nSixth course: Lobster, broken up and sauteed with green onions.  Excellent taste of the sauce, although a tad bit overcooked with the lobster meat.\\n\\nSeventh course: Abalone, round mushroom, sea cucumber and fish stomach.  Excellent taste, and nice and thick, but not oily, sauce to top off on top of some sauteed cabbage.\\n\\nEighth course: Fish in soy sauce, ginger, and scallions.  Didn't catch the name (he mentioned it to someone) but was delicious - waiter removed all the meat for us and kept it neatly on the plate in whole pieces for us to devour.

When I started my tasting a few weeks ago, I made the crucial mistake of eating a huge lunch beforehand and found I could only eat one - the fantastic roll at Maria's. Today I returned to continue my brave task, knowing I had to head right into the belly of the beast: Mike's Pastry.\\n\\nAnd yes, of course, Mike's is an institution. When I tell people I'm from the Boston area, they always mention Mike's. Every third person in the city is carrying around one of their boxes, and it's pretty well known that tourists come from every corner of the Earth to try one of these. I'm not one to turn my nose up at tourists, but I still considered it a point of pride to tell people that I had never been in my 11 years of living here. No, I don't hate tourists or even dislike them - after all, I was one once too - but I also prefer not being in a crowded room full of them.\\n\\nBut today I figured that if I was going to finish this mission it was best to approach Mike's on a weekday before summer was in full swing - and I didn't have that much time left. So, today, I took a deep breath and walked in.\\n\\nMy plan worked to an extent, since the line really wasn't that long or crowded. I mean, I could extend both my arms fully and not hit anyone, which from what I've heard, is pretty rare for this place. I even managed to snag a table. \\n\\nThere were a lot of cannoli to choose from and I contemplated going with the traditional ricotta just to have an even playing field to judge, but then I figured I might as well get something I can't get anywhere else, so I went for the amaretto. The prices are definitely higher than their competitors' - mine set me back $4 and some of the others went up to $5. They are big, however, and, let's face it, they can charge $20 a roll and still have a line out the door. I really shouldn't be giving them ideas.\\n\\nI had high hopes for this cannolo seeing as \\nA) How can you go wrong with amaretto? \\nB) A new tray came in right as I was ordering and\\nC) All of the hype, obviously.\\nUnfortunately it just didn't live up to my expectations. I mean, right off the bat you can see these are pre-filled and thereby not fresh, but I've even had better pre-filled cannoli. The amaretto taste was very mild - I could taste it with the first few bites but then it seemed to fade away and just leave a bland, sugary cream that was too cold and thick and tasted nothing like ricotta. Still, the cream was passable, but the shell was seriously subpar. It was way too soft and completely flaky. Also, not sure if this was a dud or what, but there were only almonds on one side of the cream. The chocolate drizzle on top was a nice touch.\\n\\nI'd hate to say it, but the level was just about equal to the kind of cannoli you'd find in any old cafe, if not worse. I'm guessing the popularity has more to do with the variety of flavors and the size of each roll - a classic case of quantity over quality. It's a cannolo probably worthy of three stars, but with all the hype surrounding it that lead me to think this would be God's gift to baked goods, not to mention the prices and the crowds, I gotta knock it down to two.\\n\\nNow that I've crossed off three bakeries off on my cannoli-tasting mission, I can definitively say that Maria's and Modern are both way better, the former by a landslide. Seriously. Just go to Maria's - no line, no price inflation, no crowds and actually one of the best cannoli you'll ever eat."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food, great service, not as expensive as it looks like it might be (wonderful surprise)!

I've noticed a lot of new restos popping up that aim to have this \\"industrial\\" look, but don't really have the food & drinks to back it. But Little Donkey nailed this. Not only was the decor on point (with dark wood accents, grey exposed brick, bold hanging lights, and varying seat selection), the crafty beer selection, creative menu, and cool servers made it what every new restaurant should aim for - precision.\\n\\nAnd Little Donkey made this happen. We walked in and were told we'd have to wait up to 75 mins for 2 people, which was mega impressive for such a new spot. So of course we felt like we couldn't miss out. We got a drink at the bar and were immediately asked if we were interested in potentially eating at the bar. Our name was recorded, and about 15 minutes later, we were called and seated at the plenty-of-space for grub bar seats. We immediately put in for our Pickle Brine Fried Chicken Sandwich and Matzo Ball Ramen.\\n\\nThis was one of those places that left us speechless from the first bite of our chicken sandwich. The ramen also killed it, with its fresh to death ingredients. The matzo balls and hard boiled eggs complemented the softness of the ramen, while the burnt onion added the crispy texture I've never had in ramen before (and will never want to go without again.)\\n\\nWe then decided to go for the burger, which was a \\"must\\" according to our waitress. And we are SO glad we did. I almost felt sad that I've been living for 23 years without this burg in my life. It was THAT good.\\n\\nThe burg is described on the menu as dry aged beef, buffalo pickles, onion soup mayo, foie gras, and jalape√±o chips - the perfect combination of mouth wateriness. We agreed that the only way you can describe this burg in one word if \\"soft.\\" Sounds weird, I know. But the bun was actually the FRESHEST piece of carbohydrate I've ever laid my hands on (I'm talking like, moist with freshness), and the foie gras added an almost caramelized jammy aspect (along with the onion soup mayo - hayoooo mayo), with the crunch of the chips to match. \\n\\nWe both left there so incredibly pleased, I'm not sure we even spoke on the walk home.

A biscuit may not sound very exciting but they managed to capture the essence of the green chili with the perfect blend of cheese in this warm, flaky ball of delight.\\n\\nOur friend ordered the blue corn pancakes and they were also delicious.  I'm usually not a pancake gal but these were so good I would order them on my own.  \\n\\nI went with the potatoes bravas for my main.  The potatoes were seasoned perfectly which so many restaurants miss.  I did ask for my eggs over medium because I don't at all like the gooey white when it is undercooked.  Our server forgot my egg order, came back to clarify and I still got over easy eggs.  I'm also a fan of the classic New Mexico Christmas combination for chili and the green chili here is incredible.  I would have liked to have had my plate smothered in the chili versus on the side as it was served.\\n\\nThe chiliquilas my husband ordered were also really tasty and another dish I would re-order.  Our other friend ordered the breakfast burrito which was huge but she seemed to really enjoy it.\\n\\nThe other piece I loved was the smell of the wood fire; it brought back my trips to Santa Fe and it is a smell unique to New Mexico (and now I suppose Boulder)."},{"name":"Masala Dhaba","address":"75 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Places like this is why I don't really trust yelp for food reviews.

I've been wanting to go to this place for months but have been trying to find the best time to avoid the crowds. (Unfortunately, the place doesn't take reservations.  My husband tried to come here for lunch during the week with some coworkers and the wait was an hour and a half!  Our waitress told us the best time is Saturday afternoon, when the place is empty - I will definitely try this!)  I finally made it happen on a Tuesday night at 6:30 when my husband and I met some friends for dinner.  We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table for 4, which went by quickly having drinks at the bar.\\n\\nThe bar menu is really cool with lots of interesting (albeit pricey) cocktails (including 2-person fish bowls).  I'm not much of a cocktail girl myself, but had quite a good Riesling.  My friends had cocktails - two of the three were good, the third one my friend said was the most disgusting cocktail he ever had!  Perhaps a fluke, but still unfortunate.\\n\\nThe concept of this place is Asian tapas.  There are so many good looking items its really hard to choose!  We \\"solved\\" this conundrum by ordering everything that we thought looked good.  The plates are very small (the waiter was kind enough to warn us about this) - about 4 pieces each - but everything is absolutely delicious and worth trying.  Lots of spice and everything well-seasoned, many plates with their own unique dipping sauces.  The exceptions are the rice and noodle bowls, which are large and not that great.  Truth be told, our pad thai was our least favorite thing (usually one of my favorites) - it had a burnt, acrid taste and we barely touched it because there was so much else to stuff our faces with.  The highlight for me was the Zucchini with Barbeque Pulled Pork - what an idea!  Spicy sauteed zucchini with shreds of pulled pork.  I've got to try this at home!  (As if I could replicate the talents of Ming Tsai in my own kitchen... but hey, I'll give it a shot.)\\n\\nThe place is tight for Boston (reminds me more of NYC dining) and it gets loud.  I think its probably better for a night out with friends than a romantic date night.  The interior decor is trendy yet relaxed.\\n\\nAdmittedly I was scared to see the damage when our bill arrived, but was relieved when we came out at $50 a person (which didn't include our pre-dinner drinks, but was definitely worth it for the great food).  I would be back more often if I could make reservations, but I guess I get why they don't take them - its more of a drop-in bar spot than a destination dinner.

Lamberts seemed like the obvious choice, as it is a BBQ restaurant and is also upscale. I expected the menu to be limited and only have BBQ options, but it actually had a rather large selection of different dishes.\\n\\nI really loved the ambience of the restaurant; it's two stories with the dining area on the bottom and a bar and band location at the top. It's dimly lit and makes for a good date night location. It's definitely the perfect mix of a old school, southern eatery with the Austin weirdness mixed in.\\n\\nWe ordered the mexican martini and the ruby red mule upon arrival. I'm a huge fan of anything that include any Deep Eddy vodka, so I was fairly underwhelmed with the outcome of the drink. It lacked ginger and didn't really embrace the flavor of what makes a true moscow mule. The mexican martini was also too tart for my taste; it doesn't even compare to Trudy's (the OG mexican martini).\\n\\nFor the amount of appetizers we ordered, you would've thought we had a party of 15...nope. Just 7 of us. My family loves to eat. We got the spicy deviled eggs, green chili queso, the wild boar ribs, and the boudin fritters. Nothing was bad by any means, but nothing stood out to me either. The wild boar ribs were the better choice and were tender, but about 50% of the bones had little to no meat on them.\\n\\nAnd we still ate dinner and dessert. Gluttony at it's finest. I ordered the short rib and O.M.G. What was I thinking?! It was HUGE. By this time, I could barely eat anything else or even breathe for that matter, but I still dove in. It was phenomenal. The short rib was so incredibly moist and fell right off of the rib. This was one of the best choices on the menu by far, but I wouldn't recommend it for one person unless you're really hungry. \\n\\nOur table shared the following sides: mac and cheese, brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes and fried okra. I felt the same about the sides that I did about the appetizers: not bad, but not great. The only side I really loved were the mashed potatoes. They were loaded with butter, cheese and were very creamy.\\n\\nThe band upstairs started playing around 10:30pm and we didn't finished dinner until 11pm. Naturally, this meant that is was really loud inside the restaurant and hard to hear one another. I didn't find it as big of an issue since we were eating at a later time, but my stepdad was really turned off by this. I'd say that would be something to take into consideration when dining at a later time on the weekends."},{"name":"Vinotopia Restaurant & Winebar at Cinetopia Mill Plain","address":"11700 SE 7th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Atmosphere was great, as was the wine list and live piano player.

This is my second time coming here. It's almost customary to bring out of state visitors. It's a cool looking restaurant with a lot of fun things and decorations. The view of Lake Travis is stellar. It really is beautiful. Especially at dusk. But that's about it. The staff and the food is subpar. The first time we went was a horrible experience. The second time was better but still very lacking.  Both times we went were during the week after mealtime rushes. Not busy at all. Yet, the servers and wait staff are slow as molasses. Must be on island time.  The food is ok. Not completely horrible but not a place I'm likely to say \\"ohhhh I'm craving the Oasis\\".   Some of the items that are in the $20 range definitely aren't worth it.  Even my $12 burger wasn't anything to be excited over.  Asking for additional items is pointless because they have short term memory loss. We asked for ranch for 20 minutes. Hey, we like ranch with our fries. We asked a couple times. I also asked for some spread for my burger because the bun was dry. A \\"runner\\" came by with an extra cup for my 1 year old so I asked again if we could get some ranch and she said \\" You will have to ask your server because that's not something I do\\". I was very caught off guard by that. Even if you don't do that or it's not in your \\"job description\\", if she had good customer service skills she would have said something like \\" absolutely, no problem\\" left and told our server. Basically it felt like \\"hey, not my job\\". Needless to say by the time we were done with our meal the ranch came. But we sent it back because we obviously didn't need it. We thought that our first visit might have been a fluke but no, that's just how they operate. Maybe they feel like they can be below average because people will still come for the view?

In particular, I love layer cake. If I did not limit myself to one slice per week, I would be in serious trouble. That being said, I do, without fail, have a slice of cake every Sunday. I consider this my carbo-loading for a long week of work ahead. Piece of Cake Bakery satisfies every cake craving I could ever have. We've tried the carrot, Irish oatmeal, apple rum, marionberry poppyseed, and chantilly. If I had to choose the ultimate, it would be the Irish oatmeal, which is very similar to the carrot cake but is a little more interesting. We are getting married in about a year, and this place is definitely in the running for who might be our cake vendor. The woman who owns the bakery is quirky but lovely and very personable. We have seen her every time we've gone, which I love. It gives the place a nice, homey feel.

I don't eat oysters but mom and sister said they were the best oysters they ever had, and they came with more toppings than I've seen at other restaurants. I had the salmon Oscar, which was cooked to perfection - charred and crispy on top but moist on the inside, and topped with a sauce similar to hollandaise as well as fresh lump crab meat. The mashed potatoes that my salmon sat atop were rich, smooth and flavorful. I asked for the mac and cheese instead of the asparagus it was supposed to come with, and though I was too full to eat much of it, it was rich and gooey and topped with freshly saut√©ed onions. The rest of the meal besides the mac and cheese was exactly the right size so that I felt full without being uncomfortably stuffed. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the dessert menu. I'm sure the desserts are executed well but they were very basic, nothing unusual or inventive. I didn't feel I missed out by failing to save room for dessert.

I've heard of the restaurant and always thought the name was weird, \\"country\\" suggests there would be grits and gravy on the menu. Then I realized, that \\"3 Country\\" implied that the menu boasts dishes from Thailand, Korea and Japan.\\nStreet parking is limited on the busy intersection so we found a spot in the parking lot behind the plaza.\\n\\nThe restaurant is cozy with just a few tables in awkward locations tucked in nooks behind doors and curtains. We lucked out and snagged the last table.  There were also a few seats at the sushi bar where diners could watch the sushi chef whip up some maki rolls and sashimi.\\n\\nI got her into Thai tea, actually that is the reason why we visited. She was craving Thai Tea from the last time we had it at Cilantro next door over.  We both ordered a Thai Tea and still had some left to take back to the office in plastic cups.\\n\\nWe tend to over order and that's exactly what we did today. For appetizers, we started off with a couple of eel maki rolls and a spider roll. Complimentary miso soup was also provided with one of the dishes.\\n\\nWhen we walked into the restaurant, we saw a family eating spicy rice noodles. We were intrigued and wanted to order that and assumed it was called the \\"crazy\\" noodles based on the description on the menu.  We were wrong, it was wide rice noodles with basil and a light spicy sauce.  Nonetheless it was still tasty despite it not being what we thought we ordered.\\n\\nI was excited to see Korean staple offerings on the menu. I had to try the bibimbap.  It was perfect. The clay pot heated the rice on the bottom to a nice crisp.  There was ample beef bulgogi  and toppings. It's definitely a better deal at lunch as the same dish goes up two bucks for dinner.\\n\\nOverall, the restaurant was great. I could see myself being a regular there. Prices were great and service was extremely friendly. The lunch menu is definitely a better deal than dinner.  Parking is fine as long as you use the lot in the rear.

I ordered your BoGo special and got a Mediterranean pizza and a hamburger and pepperoni.  I also ordered BBQ wings and a split order of 4 rolls (2 pepperoni rolls and 2 torpedo rolls).  The total with delivery fee came up to $43.  I was going to order online, but with the special request of splitting the rolls I thought it would be easier if I called it in.  I gave the order taker my order and he repeated it back perfectly even offering bleu cheese for the wings and ranch and marinara for the rolls.  Everything was great, I thought.  45 minutes later, the delivery driver knocks on the door.  I skim the receipt and add his tip. While skimming, I noticed that I was charged $0.50 for a 3rd dipping sauce.  I thought that it seemed a bit chincy, since I just spent $40 on your product, but I let it slide.  The driver left and I opened up the delivery.  First thing I noticed was that there was buffalo sauce on my wings.  They were not BBQ wings at all.  I was going to call, but I decided to drop it.  I opened the box with the rolls.  It doesn't seem like they're as full of fillings as they used to be, but that's not even where I had an issue.  I was looking forward to trying your torpedo rolls, but instead I got 2 pepperoni rolls and 2 spinach and mushroom rolls...well, 2 rolls with a few pieces of spinach and a mushroom.  :\\\\  I'd even had a little chat with the order taker about the torpedo rolls.  I was disappointed.  On to the pizza, it was soggy.  It was cold.  The meat pizza looked like it'd been under a warmer with congealed cheese that wasn't at all stringy.  Yet, I still didn't say anything.  The final straw was the sheer laziness of the person who prepared my pizza.  I've worked at pizza places in the past.  Chain pizza places where I wouldn't expect their quality to be anywhere near as high as Austin's Pizza.  I've seen superiors chastise employees and have them completely remake pizzas for doing a poor cutting job.  Attached is a picture of the slack job one of your employees did to my pizza.   \\nSo, you may chalk this experience up to it being Saturday night.  It may be because people were having a bad night or weren't paying attention to what they were doing or whatever.  But, for the money I spent on this experience, I may have been better off going to a chain pizza place.  It was pretty much on par with one.\\"\\n\\nAlmost 3 weeks later and I didn't get a single reply.  Thanks for nothing Austin's Pizza.

If your kids like crowds (I think most teenagers would love it), noise and a lot of excitement and music it is definitely for you.

I was definitely curious, but was at first deterred by the long line outside the shop. However, my friend and I had some time to kill, so we decided to go for it.\\n\\nThe line was long, but moved very quickly. Once you were in the actual store, it is pure craziness; there are people everywhere, shouting across the room and such. But it's the kind of chaos that you should expect to find at local but very popular establishment. Even when you get into the store, there are cashiers pretty much all around the perimeters of the store, so I waited less than 5 minutes to place my order.\\n\\nI ordered two chocolate chip, a strawberry and a peanut butter cannoli. And every single one was amazing. \\n\\nHaving been recently diagnosed with lactose intolerance, I knew it would be a bad idea to eat any of these. But I had to try them; people raved about them too much for me to resist. So I had a tiny bite of the chocolate chip.\\n\\nAnd then another bite.\\n\\nAnd then another.\\n\\nBefore I knew it, I was halfway done with it. I stopped myself, but boy, did I want to finish that cannoli. I did not care that I would most likely be dying later that night... it was worth every single bite.\\n\\nLet it be known, these cannolis are divine. The filling is perfect: just the right amount of whatever flavor they claim to be (not overpowering any other flavors, but instead, blended in perfect harmony), not too rich, not too sweet... perfection. The shells were also crispy and delicious, as everything in the bakery itself is made fresh.  \\n\\nI ended up taking the rest of the cannolis back to New York. They survived the trip back, and although obviously the shells weren't as crisp and perfect as they were in Boston, they were still very good. I had small bites of the strawberry and peanut butter, and hate myself for not being able to finish them off. I might just take a bunch of lactaid pills later and do exactly that.\\n\\nIf you are in the Boston area, I highly recommend getting your hands on these bad boys. And eat them. \\n\\nTIP: The best way to eat the chocolate chip cannoli, is to bite into the chocolate chip end first, and munch your way halfway through the shell. Then, finish the other half by starting with the chocolate chip end again. The chocolate flavor sits in your mouth and gives the rest of the cannoli a subtle chocolatey-goodness taste while you enjoy the rest of your uhmazing treat."},{"name":"Boston Lobster Feast","address":"8731 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"The service was ok at best and the food in the buffet  was not tended to well at all by the staff the lobster  was not tender you can do sooo much better for the price at best this place should  charge 27.00 max for the lobester buffet  will not be going here again"},{"name":"Kona Grill","address":"11410 Century Oaks Ter","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place for office meetings!

I went out of my way to try this place out. I don't know if I just got unlucky this time around, but this was probably the most underwhelming KFC place I've been to. Please keep in mind that 2 stars just means I did not enjoy my experience overall and that I wouldn't recommend this place, not that it was awful or anything. However, I have some major gripes.\\n\\n1) the sweet and spicy chicken is almost insultingly NOT spicy. There isn't even a tiny kick to it. I detected no heat at all; the sauce was just sweet and savory. The soy garlic chicken is very boring and somewhat bland.\\n\\n2) they are understaffed. No one took our order for a while, and it took a long time just to get water. We went on a Friday night, and there were only two people working- the owner (I'm assuming) and someone else.\\n\\n3) the dressing on the salad tastes like Big Mac sauce or thousand island. That's fine, but because the chicken was not spicy at all, I would have much rather had the typical sriracha mayo as the dressing.\\n\\n4) the chicken is supposed to come with potato wedges (according to the menu), but that means you get two wedges per half order that are fried and sauced with the chicken.\\n\\n5) they don't serve any alcohol. What kind of KFC place doesn't at least serve beer???\\n\\nOne more minor complaint is that you pay via one of those transaction systems while the waiter is holding it. I find this way of paying rather awkward. The chicken was also room temp when it came out. \\n\\nNow, this place isn't awful. The chicken was fried well, the portion size and price are decent, and the restaurant itself is clean. The service is also okay, but they definitely need at least one more waiter.\\n\\nI might go back to try some of the other menu items. I noticed that most of the tables around me did not just get chicken.

The ambiance here is a perfect for a date night. \\n\\nWe ordered the BBQ calamari for an appetizer and the Korean BBQ platter family style for our main entree. \\n\\nBBQ calamari - interesting take on calamari. We both have never had calamari in BBQ sauce before. I think it also came with peanuts, some veggies and some green onion. Overall, okay for an appetizer and good portion. My boyfriend loved it but it was meh for me. I thought it tasted a little too heavy on the BBQ sauce but loved that it was crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. \\n\\nKorean BBQ platter - this was meant to be shared between three to four people. My boyfriend eats a lot so this was perfect for the two of us. This platter came with Kalbi ribs, bulgogi chicken thigh, spicy pork belly, pineapple tomatillo salsa, gochuchang, and lettuce. My favorites were the Kalbi ribs and gochuchang. The chicken thigh was okay and the spicy pork belly did not taste spicy at all. I think this dish was okay considering the fair price ($45), but I don't think the meat was comparable to what you would get at an actual Korean BBQ restaurant. Overall I think it was okay but I would probably order sushi or some seafood dish next time. \\n\\nThe service here was great. Our waiter was sweet and friendly. \\n\\nRandom but I really liked their bathroom.

This place is a gem.\\n\\nOne of our meal highlights in Portland. Once you open the menu, you quickly  realize the dedication this restaurant has to mothers. They had a 'featured mother' in the first few pages. It was a heart-warming read, but soon over-shadowed by the menu items. True, soul, comfort food is served here. I quickly closed the menu as soon as I read Pot Roast... slow cooked served on top of mashed potatoes. My wife quickly picked the chicken and dumplings. I wasn't sure whether to be excited for my dish or hers. \\n\\nAs expected, they both delivered. The pot roast melted off my fork with oozing juice and mashed potatoes all swirled together like a meaty mush. It was just bliss. My wife's chicken and dumplings were just as delicious. Though the dumplings were just a bit heavy for me.  It was home-cooking at it's best. Forgot to mention that we also ordered an appetizer sampler of french fries, stir fried cauliflower and mac and cheese with bacon. Yes, I know... we over-indulged. But so worth it. If there was any place to do so, it's definitely here. \\n\\nThe warm environment, the incredible food, and the great people of Portland all came to a head in this restaurant. Like with all my 5 stars... I really can't say much more other than go there and experience for yourself. \\n\\nBy the way, if the hostess asks you if you'd like to sit in the bar area, say \\"yes\\".

It was packed (Sat about 10am) and I had to wait about 15 minutes.  The waitress offered me coffee while I stood waiting which I thought was nice.  Ordered the corned beef hash with eggs over medium and a side of potatoes.  Potatoes were ok; I prefer them more crispy, but they had onions and peppers in them, and lots of paprika (which I like) so they tasted good.  I got them not knowing that the portion of hash I'd get would be so big!  Next time I'll pass on the potatoes.  Hash was outstanding.  When I first saw it the color reminded me of the canned stuff and I was a bit disappointed - until I tasted it!  It doesn't have huge chunks of corned beef; it's a much smoother consistency.  But you can see the strands of real corned beef, and better, it tastes like real corned beef.  Not overly seasoned at all.  Next time I'll probably ask for it extra well done so it has a crust, but this is great, great hash.  My first time here and I'm a fan.  The waitstaff was excellent, especially considering how busy and crowded it was.  No staff seemed annoyed or bothered by the crowd at all.  Very nice and pleasant, attentive, I was asked a couple times if everything was to my liking, and coffee top-offs were easy to get.

The gyokai is only available as tsukemen form, and since I didn't like the look of the noodles, the woman behind the counter recommended the sesame ramen.\\n\\nBroth is a vichyssoise mixed with sesame that really does remind one of a tantanmen, as Menya's (Japanese) menu points out.  It's creamy and decent, but the two flavors strangely don't taste fully combined; it felt like I was tasting both sesame AND vichyssoise.  Noodles are likely outsourced, but overcooked, probably limp to begin with, and forgettable.  Tofu swapped out for chashu free of charge--very kind of them--but maybe I should've kept the tofu as the chashu was thin and not interesting.  Boiled egg could be better; it's at best semi-gooey, but American eggs just aren't very good. Menma was pretty good, ginger was a nice touch, though probably more for looks than taste--I think mustard greens would work better.\\n\\nMenya does a lot of the little things right, things like yelling, \\"irasshaimase\\" to customers walking in, no tip, a partitioned counter, and excellent service.  Their willingness to experiment beyond tonkotsu and miso should be praised.  But the broth doesn't quite work, and the noodles, chashu, and egg were all disappointing to varying degrees, even if the fault may lay with their suppliers.\\n\\nWill do an update post when I try some other flavor next time, likely the gyokai tsukemen."},{"name":"India Palace","address":"23 Union Sq","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"I've found sometimes take-out or delivery isn't quite as good as when you eat in, but this is not the case for India Palace.

It's the antithesis of Austin, rather a bit of Dallas transplanted directly into our unassuming, beloved SoCo.\\n\\nPerhaps it's unfair to judge a place purely based on it's clientele.

Often times, we had to flag down a server multiple times to get our side dishes refilled. The music could definitely be toned down as we could barely have a decent conversation without succumbing to a shouting match.\\n\\nWhat really gave this restaurant 2 stars was the fact they kept trying to seat people next to us when half the restaurant was empty. Our table was joined together with another table and with the extra table real estate, the server would placed the food on the extra table. Everytime the server tried seating people on the table next to us, we would move our food back to our table. It was only when the customer had to forcefully request to be seat at another table where they don't have to share with other people did the server reluctantly move them.

It's been a tough go for the North Market and I do hope it can change its image--has recently become a less than appetizing food court (malls have better options) rather than an actual thriving market with vendors and not a mishmash of food stalls. North Market really needs to step it up in order to survive--there's way too much competition out there and many enjoy cooking at home. I'd much rather put the time and effort into a beautifully homemade meal than regretfully eat and pay for something that was egregiously, poorly executed.

The only reason I'm giving Lambert's four stars instead of five is because when you charge $40 prix fixe for brunch, you ought to include coffee and tea!  It's kind of disconcerting to get the bill and see those little charges for coffee and tea.

I got the vegetarian combo (chef's surprise of 2 curries + naan + rice) and a Diet Coke. Delivery came with a regular coke, driver said that was all the restaurant had. The two curries both had the same orange, runny, watery sauce with no flavor or texture. The \\"paneer\\" looked and tasted like tiny tofu chunks, and the veggie curry was 2 pieces of broccoli with some undercooked carrots that definitely were from a bag and not fresh. The naan was most disappointing of all - not light and crispy, it was like a heavy wheat bread, with no butter, cilantro, seasoning, or anything.

The chicken was actually simmered in a flavorful BBQ sauce and pulled, rather than basic breaded / grilled chicken pieces laid over the top of a BBQ sauce base.  \\n\\nHeathbar smoothie was awesome.  Several other smoothie options on the menu sound very good, but the Heathbar one was a great choice.  \\n\\nMaybe this place had some troubles when they first opened and have since figured out how to run a good restaurant.

The butter and warm chocolate bread went together perfectly.  We ordered one for four of us and man that was a mistake.  Should've been at least two. If we didn't order an app and entrees I would've got a whole order of bread for just me! A MUST get. \\nNext came the Roasted Brussel sprouts w/ jalape√±o mayo cheese and chili powder. I like sprouts and wasn't too sure how this would play out. Guess what? It worked out and was tasty and had a good depth of flavor with the smokiness and the compliment of the jalape√±o mayo and cheese to make it slightly creamy. The chili powder added a little pop and the end. Such a good dish. Would definitely order again. \\n I ordered the Chicken Bourguignon for my entree and it looked good and the sauce was good, but the chicken was a little dry.  The sauce saved the dish and made it good. After the bread and sprouts I was expecting a wow factor but fell short. \\nThe wife and mom shared the Brisket and wild mushroom meatloaf. I took a couple bites and it was a tasty meatloaf. The beefy brisket and mushroom made this an interesting meatloaf. It was good, but again a little on the dry side. Thank goodness for gravy!  \\nAfter all that we were pretty full, however, I was not leaving without a dessert. I ordered a key lime milkshake cause it was hot outside and I didn't want anything super thick or heavy. It was a good shake and not thick, so the drinkability was smooth and light. Refreshing if you will. The highlight of this dessert though was the slice of key lime pie on the top. Toothsome should sell this pie on its own. We also bought macrons and chocolate bars, both delicious. And I kept my souvenir cup. \\nAll in all you should absolutely make it here even to just experience the theming and have fun ordering dessert."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Cute place with friendly staff.\\nThe food was great (I think you can find the menu online), and I enjoyed eating outside!"},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We stumbled on this place Memorial Day weekend and was relieved to find a short line (not wrapped around the building like another Portlandia bakery we've come to know) and tried 2 dozen of the sweet and tiny doughnuts.

Within the last year, though, while the food has stayed good, the prices and service have become decidedly worse.  Prices are still lower than most sit down Indian dining elsewhere, but you'll now pay right around what it costs to eat at one of the stellar Indian lunch buffets in the area - making the appeal of Punjabi Dhaba much less.  Even worse is the increased wait time.  They seem to have decided to privilege take out orders over the dine-in crowd, since it has become typical for take out orders placed (significantly) later than dine in orders to be filled first.  The result is that going there for dinner has resulted in 30-50 minute waits for me over the last year.  I keep hoping that \\"next time will be better,\\" but I think it's fair now to give up hope.

Sadly, I was a little put off by the Hyatt Regency Austin -- things started going downhill from the second my wife and I walked in the door when the front desk clerk insisted that we booked a room with 2 double beds and they didn't have anything available with 1 king.  After I showed her the printout from Orbitz that clearly said \\"1 king bed,\\" she made noises about \\"oh, you bought through a third-party and not us, that's not guaranteed\\" but finally found us a room on the 4th floor with a king bed.\\n\\nOther fails from the weekend:  Two of the three elliptical machines in the gym were busted when I tried to exercise (and the third was being used), so I had to work out using other equipment.  The parking lot gate goes up when you put your room key in the card slot, but I never could get it to work, so every time we returned to the hotel, I kept trying to activate the gate for a few minutes with my hand out in the rain until I finally gave up and just took a regular ticket.  Plus it was the weekend of the AFC playoffs and the Golden Globes, but for some reason, reception of all of the local network TV channels was incredibly snowy to the point where we could barely see what was going on.  We had to sign up for some paid online streaming TV service after getting the front desk to agree to comp our WiFi for a night (since WiFi costs $9.99 a day through T-Mobile Hotspot) in order to watch the Golden Globes.  Unfortunately, the guy who agreed to comp our WiFi didn't put any notes on our account, so I had to convince them when we checked out that someone had offered to give us a free day of WiFi.  Also, last call at the hotel bar was at midnight on a Friday night...  not exactly what I expected from a city known for its nightlife.\\n\\nThe hotel is located on the south side of the Congress Street Bridge, with much easier access to the stretch of restaurants and stuff south of the city center.  If you're going to Austin to hit stuff downtown like 6th Street or the Convention Center or UT, it is not an easy walk from the Hyatt -- it's a half-mile just to get from the hotel over the bridge and another half-mile to 6th Street, so I would recommend staying somewhere on the other side of the Congress Street Bridge.\\n\\nOn the upside, the bed was comfortable, the room was well-appointed, and everything was very clean.  We initially feared the noise level from the atrium would spill into the rooms (since the hotel is triangular and all of the room doors face into the open air atrium, with sound from the ground floor easily carrying up the height of the interior of the hotel), but we were happy to find that despite the noise level on each open-air hallway, our room was quiet inside."},{"name":"Kona Grill","address":"11410 Century Oaks Ter","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Happy hour.

This is dreck. I've been there twice: the first time for a salad, which was approaching mediocre but couldn't quite make it; the second time for fish tacos, which were a complete abomination, and an insult to every foodstuff included, not to mention the intended victim--me. A week ago I had fish tacos for the first time in San Diego at Rubio's--a cheap fast-food joint that serves fish tacos. I liked them. So I tried them when I got back to Cambridge, and figured I'd try 'em at TCF--at 4 times the price, they should be at least decent, right? WRONG! The tortillas, which for some odd reason were doubled on each taco, tasted bland, there was WAY too much unseasoned cabbage (about 80% of the filling, by my estimate), and at the bottom was some oddly tasteless fish that had some kind of coloring that one would think might be seasoning. But one would be wrong. It has to just be food coloring. There was \\"pico de gallo\\" on the side, consisting of diced tomatoes and nothing else (God save us from anything like seasoning or spice!), along with a lump of what they consider guacamole--presumably a lump of old library paste that had green food coloring added and a couple of pencil erasers. This was one of the blandest meals I've ever had... oh, and another thing, there was a drop of special sauce in each of the tacos--I know, because that one drop that was supplied fell on my shirt, where I got a chance to taste it. It wasn't bad. But what's with the rationing? Are we having a national fish taco sauce shortage? Did I not have enough rationing stamps? The meal came with rice (yellow minute rice with bird's eye vegetable bits thrown in) and black beans (possibly the high point of the meal--not too much to screw up between the can and the plate).\\n\\nTo sum up, the food tastes awful, the service is unusually busy, and hence have no time for actual individual interaction with customers, and the prices are outlandish.

Not a great appetizer to split if you're seeking any kind of substance, especially at eight bucks a pop.\\n\\nSomeone else in my company tried the chicken fingers, which were laughably overcooked.  Deep fried rope, anyone?\\n\\nFor the entree, there were only a handful of dishes that weren't either burgers or sandwiches.  After that disappointment I settled on the cajun catfish tacos.  The catfish was cooked fairly well, but it was oversalted to a level that four glasses of water couldn't quench.  The rice that came with the tacos... I don't even know how to describe it beyond bland, bland, bland.  It was white rice tossed in red sauce with kidney beans and absolutely no seasoning whatsoever.

Yes I know their food is far more authentic and healthy than Taco Bell but I guess it's just the rebel in me but I still prefer Taco Bell to Chipotle.  I completely realize Taco Bell is \\"Americanized\\" fast foods version of Mexican food but to me it just usually tastes better.  Chipotle is good eating, don't get me wrong..but I think their limited selection is kind of a turn off for me.  I cannot get a tostada here for example, something I love to get at other places.  \\n\\nWhen you order I think the concept of ordering piece by piece is a good one in theory but poor in execution.  If there is any sort of line I feel a lot of pressure from the employees serving as to what food to pick and often just end up winging it and regretting some of my choices.  I don't have the same issue if no one is behind me however.  \\n\\nThe best thing about going to Chipotle is the guacamole.  Their sour cream is too runny in my opinion.  Their cheese is also sort of bland but passable, I prefer cheddar (I know, I know, cheddar isn't authentic and their white cheese is but I digress).  Usually I just end up getting a bowl, their burritos are too big and I usually feel bloated when I get one.  The bowls are tasty but like I said, I get bored rather quickly with the selection and would only really come here probably once every six months if not for my fiances love of this place.  \\n\\nAcceptable food but not very exciting to me.

Ray Ray (whoever you actually are or aren't) is a Real American doing some great things in the North-of-campus area.  \\n\\nFirst visit there and expectations were extremely high.  Yesterday it was about 25 degrees outside, windy and snow-covered.   THIS IN NO WAY STOPPED OR HINDERED PEOPLE FROM GETTING THEIR BBQ ON!!!  Its Sunday, which is brisket day and Super Bowl  (yea I said it) Sunday, so Ray Ray was putting out his extremely rare chicken wings.  As we pulled up in the snow and mud, there was a line of about 20 people standing in the frigid conditions.\\n\\nA few people would pull up, see that there were no more wings, and leave to cry their way home and try to just exist in their lonesome, sad lives.   The rest, including me, were looking for some smoked meats and were not leaving until we got some!  \\n\\nLuckily, as you stand in line in the cold, you can be swathed in smoke from the propane tank-of-a-grill where the magic happens.   Also, you can read the menu a hundred times and think about the food the whole time you are line.  And best of all, someone brought me a tall boy from the Ace of Cups to drink while in line!!!!   Cold day, cold beer, hot BBQ.\\n\\nFinally, as you get up to the front of the line and the side of the food truck, the friendly staff starts prepping your BBQ to order as you gaze through a steamy, not so transparent window that offers you glimpses of ribs, brisket and sandwiches being cut/chopped, weighed and sauced before your very eyes. Sensory overload and exhilaration!!  It's like descending into an airport of meat through a bank of clouds.  \\n\\nI got 2 slabs of ribs and 2 pounds of grass-fed brisket.  SPOILER ALERT - it was/is all extremely good, leaner than you might think, smokey barbeque awesomeness.\\n\\nBut then, I knew it would be because there were dozens of other true mountain-men and mountain-women like myself willing to stand in line in 25 degree temperatures, frigid breezes and snow to get a taste of Ray Rays."},{"name":"Bombay Caf√©","address":"1137 Doss Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"What a great surprise!

We received the usual nachos and salsa, but the chips were stale. The salsa wasn't bad though. We ordered the queso dip with jalapenos and the guacamole.  The guacamole was again mediocre, ok, but nothing special. The queso dip wasn't that great, it didn't help that the chips were stale. Once we received another basket of chips, the queso was a bit better, but still nothing to write home about.

I thorougly enjoy bypassing the mopes waiting for a table (for nasty food and uncomforatably close seating) and go right to the counter to order my multiple slices of delicious cheesecake. This has been my thing more recently. Well the last time I visited this establishment (for cheesecake only), it was a semi disaster. First I asked the employee if they had the red velvet cheesekcake (because I did not see it in the case) and she said yes and pointed it to me. Of course I jumped all over that and asked for a piece of that and the banana creme cheesecake. My boyfriend (who worked in the food industry forever) noticed she had been handling money or something and needed fresh gloves, so he immediately reminded her of that before she began slicing up my cheesecake. He placed his order and we took a seat on the bench. This is where I'll add that for some odd reason, I do enjoy the decor of this place. Anyway we pay for cakes and go home. Upon arrival at home, I am absolutely horrified when I discover my red velvet order was somehow mistaken for apple crisp or something. How in the world did she screw that up after the animated conversation we had?! At this point, I am infuriated that I had to deal with Cambridgeside Galleria and the miscreants who frequent it, only to come home with the wrong order. I phone the place and speak to a manager who very insincerely apologizes and asks me to come back and get my cake. I respond with a no and she responds by putting me on hold forever. Finally she returns and offers to send me a $10 gift certificate. I accept. I have since used my gift certificate (on cheesecake of course!)and definitely checked my order before going home."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Great pastries!

The 13 year old and I had some make & potato/scallion pancakes. By the time his udon noodle dish came he was too stuffed to give it a fair try, so it went into the doggy bag. I was right there with him and was too full to eat much of my Gopdol Bibim Bab (Korean dish in sizzling stone pot with rice, veggies fried egg and tofu). I wished I had picked chicken rather than tofu, as it was a little bland. Since my picky-eater 9 yr old didn't like his plain chicken on a stick (hold the teriyaki sauce) I did have some chicken to take home too, and mixed it together for a good meal the next night.

Once she got the drinks, she came really close to spilling a glass of merlot on my boyfriend and then she actually dropped and entire bottle of beer and a glass on the floor right next to us, spilling beer all over the 2 people on the outside of the table and leading to a 10 minute clean up process. \\n\\nOnce we got settled again, our food arrived shortly after and it was pretty good, but nothing better than any other sushi place in Arlington.

I would consider Lambert's Downtown Barbecue as fancy barbecue. Freedmen's Bar and them. This is where you look for quality service with a sophisticated cocktail in hand. There is nothing wrong with that by any means. Good barbecue is good barbecue no matter where you eat it. My wife and I have gone here before to celebrate an anniversary so it is not an everyday restaurant for us. Lambert's is located in the historical Schneider Brothers building downtown. Their barbecue is good enough to make it on the Texas Monthly Top 50 list. Some people believe they do no belong because they use a gas smoker. I cannot fault them for that because of the space they have. I have not had good bbq in a month so I was excited for this visit.\\n\\nWe went to brunch this time. I am an all you can eat brunch type of guy on the weekend. Just eat one big meal and make it through the rest of the day without eating. I can put away a lot of food. Surprised? Lambert's used to have all you can eat brunch on the weekend, but that has stopped recently. Sad face. I ordered the three meat plate with two sides. The meats I got were the brown sugar & coffee rubbed natural brisket, the maple and coriander crusted natural pork ribs, and the homemade jalape√±o hot link. Yeah that is a mouthful. Although the moist brisket was cut with the grain, it was fantastic. It was tender and smoky, and the fat was well rendered. The bark was a little sweet so it was like meat candy. I wish got a bigger portion of brisket because I could have eaten a couple of pounds. No joke. The pork ribs were good and tender. It was not as smoky as I would like it to be. The glaze was sweet, but the flavor was a little off. The homemade sausage was decent. It had a heavy grit and good fat ratio. It was spicy and had a nice snap from the casing, but the flavor was a little boring. Instead of two sides, I got a large order of baked macaroni and cheese. It was really good, but it might be too cheesy. Is it that possible? My wife got the brisket hash. It was pretty tasty.\\n\\nLambert's Downtown Barbecue is great plain and simple. Sure it is fancy and on the pricier side, but sometimes I feel they are a little underrated. I want to try the beef rib and pulled pork next time I go. Lambert's also serves more than just barbecue which is good for my wife. Burgers, sandwiches and steaks. The menu does vary by the time of the day. They also have a live music space located upstairs.

My personal favorite is the Mouse cannoli (always get the powdered sugar on top!). But although Mike's is most well known for their cannoli, they have a bunch of other great pastries. First starting off with is their cheesecake! I swear their cheesecake is better than the Cheesecake Factory in my opinion. This is slightly bias though, if you're a fan of the bottom crust of cheesecake you won't like Mike's because they have no bottom crust. But if that doesn't bother you Mike's cheesecake is for you.

Later with dessert, I ordered coffee, and he brought it with no cream. By the time he re-appeared, my coffee was icy! Come on! I know it's a serve-yourself buffet, but you still have a job to do!  In fact, at one point, I thought he might have left, because another waiter saw that we needed things and took care of us. However, he eventually re-emerged just in time to drop off the check and collect his gratuity. \\n\\nOverall, we enjoyed the food and the atmosphere, but the service left a pretty bad taste in our mouths.

As you can see from my previous review I do check to see how my pizza stacks up. \\n\\nThis pie came in at just over 13.00\\" so pretty close to what I ordered. Again, however, the toppings are a little more concentrated to the center of the pie than I'd like, but at least the volume was there. \\n\\nWhile I can't speak to the origin of the toppings, which a lot places like to promote, I can tell you all the toppings I've had on my various Flying Pie pizzas have tasted excellent. I particularly like the pepperoni because it has a little kick to it, like a pepperoni should.\\n\\nNow here's where you really start to take notice. This pie came in at just over 3.5 lbs, and I'll have to check with my accountant...errr wife,  but I think we spent $19.00. That means we paid approx. $5.42 per lb, so when you compare that to the $10.06 per lb I paid for a large (16\\") at Pronto Pizza you can really start to see the value.\\n\\nEven with the heavy load of toppings the pizza still isn't overly greasy orbwatery because the folks at FP put a perforated pie pan on top of your pizza after it's cooked and flip it over so all the extra grease and moisture drains from the pizza before they serve it to you.

Was greeted almost immediately by our server. She did a quick run down on the menu for us. We were starving so we got an order of nachos to start, they were delicious. The kind of nachos that have a layer of bean and cheese on every single chip. There was guac, sour cream, cilantro and picked veggies on top as well. For drinks I did the under the volcano which was a mezcal drink served up, had a nice flavor. My friend did a house margarita which she said tasted good and was pretty strong. They have two salsas on the table with small bowls which is super convenient. I was partial to the avocado salsa. For dinner we shared the parilla mixta which had chicken, steak, and pork along with rice, beans and delicious tortillas. There was some sort of frothy butter, pico de gallo and some guac as well. Presentation was awesome, although I will say... It would have been nice if staff was on top on table maintainence so there wasn't old dishes no longer being used on the table. So I lucked out because my friend doesn't like pork, little did she know it was delicious pork belly and I didn't tell her cause I didn't really wanna share. The steak was really tender too. Chicken was forgettable but still good. For dessert we did the tres leche cake which was amazing and had the perfect amount of sweetness. \\n\\nThis is my first rodeo at a ford fry restaurant and I will absolutely be back to Superica and to try his other concepts. Can't wait for the Buckhead location to open now. One thing to note is, they don't take reservations so I would probably go on a weekday as opposed to a weekend. Otherwise, it is a great spot with a homey feel, cozy interior. Tex mex is hard to sneak past me, being from California and my family living in San Diego, but I am thoroughly impressed and can't wait to bring my mom to eat here when she visits Atlanta."},{"name":"Atlantic Kitchen","address":"1374 N Main St","city":"Randolph","stars":"4","text":"V-Day Dinner with my boo.

I  really believe they ripped me off because the menu says the include 20% gratuity in the bill, and we paid the bill we asked again because the bill was so much and they said they had not included the gratuity, so we  paid again.

I heard rumors that the quality has gone downhill so I was hoping for something better than average but not outstanding but I was wrong - it was really delicious. We had some really mediocre Korean out in Coquitlam so I was trying to rectify it and it did just that. My girlfriend said it was much better than that one and that she'd happily come back (which says a lot because she's a bit picky hehe). \\n\\nWe got the blood sausage which I had been craving for months! There's only three Korean restaurants I know who make it and so I always get it when they have it on the menu. IT WAS SO GOOD. In fact, I got a medium order just so I can take the rest home for leftovers! \\n\\nThe tofu soup was delicious, flavorful, and just very tasty. They didn't skimp on tofu, meat, or kimchi. It was really satisfying. \\n\\nThe jap chae left much to be desired for one reason: they skimp on meat. They'll pile on the veggies but give you a few shreds of beef which is really disappointing. For $20, they can afford to put more meat on it! But aside from that, it was cooked really well and was very flavorful. \\n\\nThe kimchi was too fresh and wasn't fermented enough. Other than that, I really enjoyed the other 3 side dishes. \\n\\n\\nI'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because the service wasn't the best. They weren't awful by any means, but they were just incredibly busy so it was difficult to find someone when you needed something.

Here's my take on 3 that I tried: I ordered the Red Snapper and it was delicious - a nice firm meat with real fish flavor. The Dover Sole is described as a delicate white fish - and it was very delicate, too soft and flavorless for fish and chips.  I don't think it's the right fish to deep fry.  The Halibut was very good light and flaky with little flavor - good for people that don't like a fish flavor with their fish.  All of us got the 2 piece fish and chips and it was more than enough fish - large pieces and we ended up taking some home. \\n\\nThe chips here are genius - it's because they're hot, steamy and not too fried - with all of the fried food the shop has to offer - it's nice to eat some thick cut fries that were more like a baked potato than what we normally think of as fries.  \\n\\nAll in the fish and chips were great.

The bathrooms are filled with plush towels and designer toiletries and the beds are super comfortable and include high thread linens. Most rooms offer city or river views.\\n\\n3. Perks: As a Marriott Platinum Elite member I received free WIFI and access to the concierge lounge on the 28th floor. The lounge is closed Fridays and Saturdays, but I was able to have free breakfast in the lounge on Monday and Tuesday. The continental breakfast included scrambled eggs, an assortment of breads, pastries and cereals, fresh fruit, juice, meats and cheeses, and Seattle's Best coffee.      \\n\\nNegatives\\n1. Extra Fees: If you are not a Marriott Elite member WIFI is $13 a day. This seems silly when cheaper, lower-end hotels offer free WIFI.\\n\\n2. Expensive: Prices are always inflated this week in Boston, due to the seafood show. If you don't need to be near the convention center there are cheaper hotel options in Boston.\\n\\nOverall, this is a very nice hotel and I enjoyed my stay. I would definitely consider staying at this hotel for next year's seafood expo!"},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"I went here for lunch.The chips and salsa were good.

I made sure to let the super friendly lady at the counter know that also. \\n\\nI got the authentic chai and it was spot on. I loved it. And not to hot to drink right away too - perfection. \\n\\nAnd the pie. I had the strawberry rhubarb.

Hey - so many pies to try before I head back home to Hawaii!\\n\\n(Vegan and Gluten free friendly too!)\\n\\nUPDATE FROM 6/19/14:\\n\\nYep - 2 days later I am updating. Already. Honestly - before I leave Vancouver there will probably be another update. Yesterday I went with 2 girlfriends for lunch. It is adorable that you get to pick your own tea cup and they have a little French press looking thing that they bring your tea in. So freakin' cute!

I don't wish I was kidding - this place is amazing. Spot on service, pie, and tea. My kind of place. \\n\\nSo the pies I tried.... Below are the flavors and a bit of info on them and my rating from favorite to least favorite (Though all were good!)\\n\\nApple Blackberry - Perfect blend of flavor. My all time favorite.  I came back for this one a couple times. \\n\\nStrawberry Rhubarb - Sweet, tart and the perfect combination of flavors. Can't go wrong with this pie. \\n\\nLemon tart - I expected it to be a bit more tarty but I loved it all the same. \\n\\nRaspberry Rhubarb - A bit too tart, but still yummy. Anything with rhubarb is a solid choice. \\n\\nChocolate Banana Cream  - Good, tasty, but I am less of a chocolate person. \\n\\nLet's rank my pies from favorite to least favorite:\\n\\n1.

Food is mediocre at best, questionable hygiene and underwhelming customer service (probably because I'm used to slightly better service from the US even for an Asian establishment). If you're in just to stuff your face with Asian food, then this is a good spot. If you care about the quality of the food, look elsewhere.\\n\\nFood:\\nThe sashimi/sushi is underwhelming. The only redeeming factor is the choices you get. I have eaten a fair share of sashimi/nigiri sushi from AYCE in multiple countries/regions, and Shabusen's is below par unfortunately. The sashimi does not taste anything like fish, and I'm not even talking about comparing it with a 4 star yelp sushi restaurant, I have had sashimi that tastes better from any cheap old chinese-ran sushi establishment. \\n\\nHere's the scary part, I read on another yelp review about roach sighting, I waved it off as a one-off. But I saw a bug (not sure whether its a baby roach or just a fly) on my sashimi plate. I just squished it with a napkin and didn't take a second look, trying really hard to forget what I saw. BE WARNED!! \\n\\nThe kitchen food is alright, the korean BBQ meets the bar for an AYCE. The kalbi (beef short ribs) is pretty decent. Some of the fried stuff like tempura also meets the bar. We didn't bother trying any of the teriyaki stuff.\\n\\nService:\\nFor those who're not familiar, this AYCE is where you write your order on a piece of paper instead of getting up and picking stuff onto your plate. We only ordered one round, but the staff seem to get our orders right. I think what irked me is when we asked for the bill, they asked whether we're paying by card or by cash. When I said cash, the manager stood there and gave us the total and expect us to whip up the money on the spot. No written bill no nothing, he just stood there and stared at us while we try to figure out how much tip to pay. He said, with tip its $70, didn't even give us a choice, WTF?!?!"},{"name":"Sylvia's Restaurant and Lounge","address":"1154 Gilford Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Went here and they happened to have their dine around vacouver deal, so I took up their offer.

I have to say, I forgot for a quick moment that I was in Central Florida, and was pretty impressed with this place! The interior is chic and pleasing to the eye, and there are a wide variety of seating options to choose from. We were promptly seated with no reservation, and had drinks and edamame on the table in just a few minutes. \\n\\nWe ordered the Godzilla, Mango Tango, and Ichiban rolls and thoroughly enjoyed each! The Mango Tango was the most interesting for me - putting a sweet twist on sushi is quite a lovely idea! The sushi was very craftfully presented - the panko from the Ichiban was served on the side (a nice touch when sharing in a group with varying preferences). The other rolls all had a special sauce or garnish on the plate, which nicely enhanced the flavors of each.\\n\\nThe service was great - their waitstaff clearly works together to keep guests happy! Our server was very friendly and efficient. \\n\\nWhen we were given our menus, we were told that there was another simpler sushi menu that exists, but that they ran out of copies of it that night. Our server gave us a couple of examples of more simple rolls that we could order. While I appreciated his accommodating the restaurant \\"running out of sushi lists\\", I think it's a little odd that a sushi restaurant would run out of their sushi list... and not have a backup plan in order. The gourmet rolls listed on the regular menu were really delicious - and totally my cup of tea - but if I were a good ol' California roll kind of person, I might be disappointed if I couldn't browse over some less intimidating choices. \\n\\nOverall, Seito was a great experience. The sushi was creative, fresh, and very tasty. The excellent service added to the quality of the experience, which I'll be sure to share with my Orlandoan friends!\\n\\nAlso, for those fellow Diet Coke enthusiasts, the fountain DC here was phenomenal."},{"name":"This Is It!

I have been to plenty of four star places with zero star service, and vice versa. Great Bay brought the four star service and used said service to deliver a four star meal.\\n\\nWith restaurant week, I always feel like the restaurants somehow resent us promo-diners, and view us as annoyances during these two weeks...trotting out half-assed service and penny-pinching meals that squeeze into the $33 range. I didn't feel this way at all with Great Bay.\\n\\nWe got there about 8 for an 8:30 reservation, and sat at the bar, which was beautiful and spacious with very low and inviting lighting. It'd be a great after work hangout if the drinks weren't in the $9-$17 range, which incidentally was my only real complaint of the night. The bartender was pleasant and prompt, and they even offered to transfer our bar bill to the table, which is something that so few places do any more.\\n\\nOnce we sat down, we dined. We were ordering from the restaurant week menu (3-course) but wanted to try the clam chowder which would have made way too many first courses for two people. We mentioned we would split it, and instead of bringing us two spoons and getting annoyed (or telling us we couldn't split it), they brought out two smaller bowls and split it for us, charging us for one full-priced bowl. I was won over there.\\n\\nThe rest of the menu was great, and the restaurant week menu didn't disappoint. Perfectly grilled shrimp, an awesome crab and watermelon-tomato gazpacho, and sweet desserts. All with spectacular service from the hostess to the bartender to the waiter and everyone in between.\\n\\nAlso worth noting, is the space is beautiful and much much larger than I had thought from the outside. And they use it too, as tables are not 2 inches from one another as they are in so many other places.

Both were good...chips crisp and the Queso is some of the best out there, and that says a lot coming from us, considering we always have to add Salsa to wake up the Queso...And that brings us to the Salsa..We figured it would be the first thing hitting the table, like every other place we have been too..but it is listed on the Menu a separate item..  This should be included when ordering a $30+ meal, and not an extra cost..Salsa has basic ingredients and not $$ to make..needless to say we didnt try it.

My Chicken Chiladas were the same. Chicken alone was tender and had a good flavor...Green Sauce was top notch...and the Charros...Wow...unique all there own to anything I have tried...almost like refried, not a broth style like most...I used the chips to get to the bottom of the bowl...Then came the rice, and sadly it was not what we expected..it was on the watery side and a bit under cooked...The flavor was there, and it was good, very good. I still highly suggest this place...the food is really fresh and has that scratch made taste....and I really want to try some of the tacos they offer..It will kept on the back burner for when we hit this area again...But the Salsa and the Rice did cost some points..On to the next adventure!!"},{"name":"Crawfish Shack & Oyster Bar","address":"2013 Wells Branch Pkwy, Ste 106","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"i'm baffled with the philosophy of the owners and where they came up with this style of cooking.

The biscuits had excellent flavor and were a perfect size as an app. The spiced honey reminded me of pimento cheese, which I dearly miss from the south. For our entrees we shared a couple of dishes: the spicy chicken sandwich, fries, chilaquiles, and the french toast. The chicken sandwich was by far the  best. It was not dry, juicy and had a nice kick to it. The fries were incredible, and I think a must if accompanied with one of the sandwiches. The chilaquiles were alright. I liked them, but if my party wasn't all sharing I wouldn't have liked them enough for it to be the only thing I ate. The french toast was also good, but very rich.

On some nights I still see this place packed and rightfully so, the place has great food in general. The interior of the place is simple, but rather spacious, fitting plenty of people in big and small tables.\\n\\nThe service could use some brushing up, they tend to rush you because they're trying to be quick and often don't make eye contact since they are probably thinking of something else.

I've noticed some reviewers below who were upset about long waits at Sunnee--and I'd agree that for a while this was true. They lost two waitresses at once and for a few weeks the owner seemed like he was running around trying to do everything himself. I watched the wheels come off a few times for sure.

Anyways, we made small talk with the waiter who told us there's only 3 people in the kitchen...how do you run a restaurant with 3 people? No wonder they're so backed up.

Top Golf is a huge venue and perfect for food, drinks and fun.  I would count on spending at least a few hours here if you decide to check it out.  When you arrive at Top Golf you walk in and there are three different levels. Each level has their own bar and own bays. You can have six people per bay. The prices range depending on the time you arrive.  From 9-12 the bays are $30 an hour, from 12-5 the bays are $40 an hour and from 5-close they are $50 an hour. Top Golf is open until Midnight Sunday through Thursday and 2 AM Friday and Saturday. Night golfing is a blast as they set the music to the lights as you're golfing! A lifetime membership will cost you a one time fee of $5 and can be used at any Top Golf. This helps you to keep track of your scores. Top Golfs Bays are all comfortable and a fun place to hang out.  That being said even if you're joining a group of your friends and you don't want to golf,  you don't have to, you'll still have a great time.  Each bay also comes equipped with heaters which is great for the chilly days or at night when the sun goes down. \\n\\nLet's talk food! Oh my goodness, their food rocks! I honestly didn't know what to expect when it came to food but it was so delicious. I originally went for an event and had their event food which differs from their normal food. The event food was delicious and the Mac and cheese was definitely my favorite!  When I ordered off the menu at Top Golf I ordered the pulled pork sliders. I wasn't disappointed one bit. The sandwhiches came out piping hot!  The buns were perfectly toasted,  the meat was delicious, and I even liked the slaw. I'm not a mayo fan, and in my opinion you couldn't even taste the mayo in the slaw with all the seasonings. They also have plenty of fun drinks to pair with your food for the hot summer days, or nights!

Beautiful atrium and lobby, typical of Hyatt signature interiors. Superb customer service, from the moment we checked in to the second we checked out. Plenty of self-parking available (expensive, though!). Cafe on the first-floor, near the front entrance. Decent distance from central downtown, including Congress and 6th Streets. It's over the river, so it'll be a nice little trek (~10 minutes from front door to the other side of the river), but nothing egregious. We stayed here during 100+ F temps, and we didn't find the walk to and from town to be onerous. If you're in decent shape, it's a beautiful walk across the bridge and through town. We would suggest that you drive, however, if you'll be coming in late from town.\\n\\nCONS: Did I mention that valet parking is expensive, at $14/night? Internet/wifi is ~$9/day, so if you can, save your web browsing for when you're at a cafe that offers it for free, or bring your own hotspot (which is what we did, and it's so much more secure). Amenities are few, although there were two waffle-weave robes in the room for our use. \\n\\nAll in all, a pretty decent hotel, especially for the price. However, if you plan on spending a lot of time downtown, you might consider paying a little extra and booking directly with a hotel of your choice (e.g., the Sheraton was offering $89/night on Priceline) rather than playing the Priceline roulette.

I ordered the avocado grilled cheese with a side salad and she had the calamari which was half priced during the happy hour. The food came relatively quickly and I have to say...it was the best grilled cheese I've ever had. The sandwich was a multigrain bread with avocado and goat ch√®vre as well as some veggies. It was phenomenal and I even went online to their website to screenshot the ingredients so I can make it at home. My colleague's calamari was superb. The textures were perfect and the calamari was crispy but tender. \\n\\nIf you are staying in Downtown Vancouver and have a chance to visit this restaurant, I highly recommend that you do!

It's great to see folks enjoying themselves so much and people watching here is interesting as there's such a variety of folks.  You can find some really good deals when you shop around.  When we stop by to catch a movie or something to eat we always end up purchasing something for us or a family member as there's so many neat and interesting shops."},{"name":"Thai Basil","address":"1215 Thurlow St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"The best Pad Thai in Vancouver, for sure.

I lived in Columbus for a couple years, and I have tried and loved pretty much everything on their menu. They are located in a parking lot just adjacent to Ace of Cups so it is a little tricky to find the truck the first time, but you can just look for the giant cloud of BBQ smoke. \\nMy favorites from the menu include the spare ribs, the brisket sandwich, and the jerk chicken sandwich. I'm also a big fan of the baked beans side and the banana pudding! They also have a great variety of BBQ sauces (sweet, habanero, jalapeno, and vinegar). I personally love the habanero (it is pretty spicy but they allow you to order the sauces on the side as well). For the past year or so Ray Ray's has also started to have specials each weekend which they post on their Facebook page each week ranging anywhere from meat corn to whole roasted chickens. I haven't tried that many of these but they always look amazing. \\nThey are open year round, however its the best to go during the warmer months because you can sit at the outdoor patio of Ace of Cups! Otherwise you are best off taking the food home as there isn't an indoor seating option. I would also be a little wary going later in the day, especially on Sundays since they can run out of one (or all!) of the food options. Occasionally during the colder months they may have a day or two that they are closed but they are quick to update their Facebook accordingly!\\nLastly, the staff there are always full of energy and happy to offer suggestions. If you're in Columbus it's worth the trip!"},{"name":"Bernie's Gourmet To Go","address":"1875 W County Rd 419","city":"Oviedo","stars":"5","text":"Fantastic food that's made fresh.

Two or more of the Disney food trucks will be at the park most days: Superstar Catering (featuring favorites from Disney's Hollywood Studios), Namaste Caf√© (Disney's Animal Kingdom dishes), Fantasy Fare (Magic Kingdom tastes) and World Showcase of Flavors (Epcot Food & Wine Festival). The park is next to Bongos Cuban Cafe and also includes an area for live entertainment, seating for diners and ample shade.\\n\\nFulton's Crab House - Seafood is flown in from around the globe, but also celebrates Florida's waters with seasonal catches such as stone crab claws. Choose from the nautical dining room or one of three outdoor decks. Fulton's is an 11-time winner of Wine Spectator's Award of Excellence, with more than 2,000 bottles in their cellar.\\n\\nGhirardelli Soda Fountain & Chocolate Shop - The chocolatey smell wafting from the rooftop is enough to draw anyone inside. This spot offers everything from scoops to floats, sundaes and malts. You must try their World Famous Hot Fudge Sundae, with house-made fudge.

My wife was given this place as an suggestion from a co-worker and at first we were kind of skeptical due to the other seafood places we have been to that were all you can eat. But this place right here is mind blowing. I must say if you are going for a variety of food you will be kinda disappointed, but if you going because you love lobster and crab legs, you will be winning! As you can see in the picture those plates were from was my first trip to the buffet, and trust me plenty more trips followed lol. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who want that seafood fix and My wife and I will definitely be attending this place again whenever we come back to Florida. Let's go lobster!!"},{"name":"Little Donkey","address":"505 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Went here last night with another couple, and can't say enough good things about Little Donkey! If you love the concept of small plates there are few restaurants that do it as well as Little Donkey does. There menu is incredibly varied and delectable, it invites so many possible food experiences that lead to delight, wonder, and a very full and pleased belly! \\n\\nWe handed off our experience to our supremely gracious and thoughtful waiter, Alex. He did not let us down. We started with the crudo selection (Pony) in which you get 4 crudos plus 5 oysters for $65. The sashimi was excellent and oysters were very interesting varieties and it only got better from there. I can't remember everything we got, but I believe there was lobster rangoon, baba ganoush, some perfectly cooked crussel sprouts, the special of ramen bolognese (outstanding!), duck nachos (don't ask, just eat!), the best octopus I've ever had in my life, and then a sampling of desserts that pretty much brought us to heaven. \\n\\nI realize this review sounds a bit over the top, but I promise it's all true, highly recommend Little Donkey. If I was forced to complain about anything I would say it is a bit dark in there for my taste and a bit loud, but at the same time they played some Ice Cube and Pharcyde, so there's that!

I have always gone to Bahn Mi Fast food in the Asian plaza with the failed Ranch 99 grocery store.  \\n\\nAlways been an argument between most people in Atlanta on who has the better Bahn Mi.  I am putting my stock in with Bahn Mi Fast food on this one and the simple reason why is because the funky Vietnamese mayonnaise is much tastier at Bahn Mi fast food.\\n\\nI had the Lee's special Bahn Mi and it was good, but it just doesn't have the \\"special sauce\\".  Thought it was strange that Lee was pimping the best Bahn Mi award via the New York times or some other over inflated hype machine when you walked in the door considering they just don't have \\"the sauce\\".\\n\\nAs for the rest of the menu, well it is definitely superiour to Bahn Mi fast foods.  Wife had the Spicy beef soup,  I went for the tried and true vermicelli with pork shrimp and egg roll (Bun Tom Thit Nuong Cha Gio).  Kids had the crepe.  \\n\\nOnly thing that fell short was the dipping sauce for my noodles and they put less veg in theirs. Beef soup was very good (highlight) and the crepe is just a typical flavorless vietnamese egg crepe with shrimp stuffed inside (nothing special).\\n\\nThis place is what it is.  Quick vietnamese food that you can eat sitting down or take out.  \\n\\nService, not bad.  My waiter did bring out the wrong item to me and looked kind of shocked that I sent it back after he brought out the menu and I pointed to the item I requested (for the second time), but I can overlook it.  The poor guy barely speaks English, and other than words like Bahn Mi, and Pho, I can't speak ANY vietnamese.

Of course, there are also several overhead costs that Lee's clearly doesn't see as a priority - such as their website, which prominently declares \\"we are best Banh Mi and the cheap lunch place for everyone can hang out\\". \\n\\nFood: Lee's Bakery specializes in casual and authentic Vietnamese fare. During my visit, I opted for the #3 lunch combo, which consisted of a chicken banh mi and a \\"small\\" vegetarian pho, both of which were gargantuan in portion and flavor. The banh mi was absolutely packed with vegetables, noodles, and broth - more than I could have eaten in a single sitting. Although I didn't have one,  Lee's also serves several different types of smoothies that many of the patrons seemed to be enjoying.  \\n\\nService: Patrons have the chose of either dine-in or takeout service. Those wanting takeout can order at the front counter, while those seeking to dine-in must wait in line for an available table. Once at table opens up, one of the servers will seat you and promptly take your order. Drinks are self-serve from the cooler, but food is brought out to you once it's ready. The staff aren't particularly personable, but they're incredibly efficient - the time from order to food delivery during the peak lunch hour was less than 10 minutes. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Loud, chaotic, and devoid of any frills. This is not the type of place you should come for an intimate lunch or business meeting - it's all substance and no style. The dining room consists of a series of communal tables with folding chair and plastic table clothes - coolers and bakery items line every available wall space. \\n\\nCost: Very inexpensive, to the point where you feel compelled to tip over 50% out of sheer guilt. A lunch combo, which includes a half banh mi sandwich and a bowl of pho, will set you back $6.50. A full banh mi costs approximately $6, while a half is $3. \\n\\nOther: Lee's Bakery is open daily from 8AM to 8PM. It's located in the Buford Plaza, which is at the corner of Buford Highway and Clairmont Rd. Parking spaces outside the restaurant are extremely limited, so during peak hours you may need to resort to parking in the adjacent plaza.

My grandson is on the 'old' side for the average children's play age here, but that's alright because he is on the young end of his age spectrum (4). And because he loves trains so much, the playing table with tracks and plenty of trains below is a nice enticement for him to enjoy. \\n\\nAnother fun factor is watching the children interact, and learn to interact--the social aspect of bringing a child here. \\n\\nAlso the climbing wall in the back still has his attention, which would be a challenge for smaller children, due to the hiding factor for him: playing hide and seek never gets old.\\n\\nThey have special jars for 'mouthed on' toys, and offer lots of toys for both girls and boys--with easy to get to boxes on display to sort out what they want to play with. The dollhouse is huge and looks like fun, and the fake car has plenty of puzzle like things on its side.

We got the banana stuffed french toast which was probably one of the best stuffed french toast I've had. It was super fluffy and had lots of bananas inside, combined with a perfect bourbon vanilla sauce. It was unfortunate that the strawberries on top did not look fresh at all and that they didn't bother cutting off the white/brown part of the strawberry where the stem and leaves attach so I had to do that myself when I ate it. We also got the San Francisco Joe's Special which was the more forgettable dish out of the two just because it's a typical type of hash that you can get at many brunch locations.

Capozzi's is a taste of Little Italy here in Atlanta. A few weeks ago my boyfriend and his wonderful family took me out for my birthday to Capozzi's. Our server was terrific! He was not only efficient, but personable, friendly, and quite funny. Even better, he knew the freakin menu inside out. He was the kind of server who not only knew the food, but thoroughly enjoyed it as well. Always a good sign. After a few cucumber and gin martinis (HIGHLY recommended. So delish!!!) I enjoyed the best calamari I've had in Atlanta. Lightly battered, fresh, and coupled with the best marinara I've had since back in NYC. Very, very impressive.\\n\\nWe all chose different entrees. Veal parm, salmon filet, pork chops... everything was exceptional. Portions were more than generous and the flavor was out of this world.  We all sampled each others entrees and I can honestly say I experienced buyers remorse from one dish to the next. Until, of course, I got back to my own dish and just about stabbed my boyfriend in the throat when he reached for seconds on my plate. The owner makes his own homemade cheesecake and sent a complimentary slice our way. I was sooooo full from appetizers and main course that I could only enjoy a few bites. If I had less manners I would've thrown the remainder of that cheesecake into my handbag. Hey.. don't judge.

I made a reservation for 10 to 11 people for our annual year end get together which we were holding on 12/20/17 at 6 PM.  I first called on 12/14 and spoke to a woman there who confirmed the reservation.  I called back a little later on that date to change the number of people.  I was told that would be no problem.  I called back on 12/19 just to confirm the reservation and told them I may need to add one.  Again I was told that would be no problem.  I called back on 12/20 to confirm and then a little while later called back one more time to tell them we may need to add one.  I was told that would be no problem and that they would just slide over another chair.  Then at about 5:40, about 20 minutes before our reservation, two of the people in our party got to the restaurant.  They went downstairs where we often are seated to see if anyone else from our party was there and saw two tables pushed together to accommodate ten people.  Since no one from our party was there yet, they went back upstairs.  Someone who works at Massimino's asked if they could help my two friends and they told him that they were with the Grossman party.  And the person from Massimino's said that that party was going to be downstairs - acknowledging that we had a reservation.  My two friends said they would go outside to let others know that we were eating downstairs.  When I got there at 5:50, I went to see the owner and he told us \\"that he did not have a reservation for us\\".  I told him the story and all he could say was if we wanted to wait about 45 minutes, which just so happened to coincide with when the Boston Bruin game would start, that they would be able to seat us.  I was very angry and we eventually left and went to another restaurant.  The bottom line here is that the owner of the restaurant is A LIAR.  He was clearly just interested in turning tables over until the Bruin game started and could not care less about this large party of 11.  If you think that I am just an angry customer, I invite you to look at the reviews on Yelp.  You will quickly find a number of similar stories to mine.  So if you don't mind taking a chance with your reservation and then having to deal with a bloviating liar, be my guest.  If you want good food, good service and honest people, go almost anywhere else in the North End.

When I clarified what I wanted, the barista just dumped out two inches and handed it back. Now I've got half-full cup of weak coffee. When I told him why I wanted it that way, I got ton of huffing and angry looks. It's not my fault the cashier didn't mark the cup, and it's not the end of the world to pull some more shots of espresso. He made sure to pull the crappiest shot with no crema and only put in half the espresso while shooting me angry glares.

I thought it was going to be better, but with all the flavors mixing together, it was a bit too much to enjoy. The Candied Bacon Maple had a bit too much bacon.

It's also pre-filled whereas Modern just has the shells ready, and fill them when you order.  At Mike's we got the original cannoli filled with ricotta cheese, and another chocolate chip cannoli that had a caramel glaze.  I loved the flaky crust on the original cannoli.  In my opinion, the Mike's crust is better than the Modern crust, but I liked the filling in Modern more.  The filling at Mike's has a more cheesy, thicker consistency.  The filling at Modern has a smoother, creamier filling - both are good, it's really up to personal preference!\\n\\n-  Other sweets: At Mike's, we ordered the Red Velvet and an Almond Macaroon.  The Red Velvet was moist, and they really piled up the frosting.  The Almond Macaroon was addicting!  It was so good, with a chewy texture... I had to stop myself from inhaling it all.

It has shops like World of Disney, a Star Wars shop, Legoland, etc. and many fun restaurants like Rainforest Cafe, Bongos (with live salsa music and dancers) and Planet Hollywood (sadly, it is temporarily closed as it is being remodeled). We enjoyed our stay and loved the live music. It's a very fun night, and the best part, it's free! Well, unless you sniff a Churro then you'll be obligated to buy one.

My husband and I were on Austin for business and went to Lamberts Monday(8-31) evening. I ordered the steak with brown sugar and spicy mustard medium rare. This was the BEST steak I have ever eaten! We live in Atlanta and we've had some pretty great steaks...but not like this. It was cooked to perfection and the crustiness of sugar and mustard was amazing! It is served with a whole bulb of roasted garlic. It was a nice added flavor when spread on a bite of steak...but, I ate most of it without the garlic. I gave my hubby a few bites but only because I really love him. He ordered the brisket and loved it. (although, I think he will order the steak next time). We had the side of mac'n'cheese and the jalapeno grits. My husband went nuts over the grits. The mac'n'cheese was wonderful too. Service was great and fast. Our waitress was so nice. I wish I could remember her name (she is from Houston). She was nice enough to give us some insight as to the ingredients of both side dishes as they had flavors that we could not put our fingers on. We can't wait to try them at home. Both had the perfect amount of kick to them. One last, very important, bit of information about Lamberts....We got there a little less than an hour before they closed(no attitudes from staff). As we were eating our amazing dinner, right behind us, the kitchen crew started scrubbing down the grills. Yes, scrubbing! They were cleaning those things like you would not believe. I was so impressed! They were up inside the hoods, everywhere. We thought we were catching their yearly grill cleaning..wrong! Our waitress said they do that EVERY night! Unbelievable. That says a lot for this establishment.

French toast was so flaky and crunchy, not super sweet. They were soft on the inside, great contrast to the savory dishes.
