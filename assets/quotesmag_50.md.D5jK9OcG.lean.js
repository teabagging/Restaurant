First, kudos for being a young entrepreneur and having the guts to start your own business--hence why I am adding a star from 2 to 3. \\n\\nThere are a lot of lunch options at Boston Public Market. Finding gluten free (GF) options are tricky but usually I can find something almost everywhere. I decided to try Jennifer Lee's since it is exclusively GF. \\n\\nFirst piece of advice: I asked what beverages they had available and I was told none because they couldn't compete with other businesses. I have no idea what this means, other than I was dying of thirst and wanted something to drink with my lunch. Ultimately I had to visit an additional food stand to get a beverage. This is lost revenue... why not sell Spindrift or potato chips (they are GF) as add-ons? I have no idea why a lunch place wouldn't sell beverages.\\n\\nSecond piece of advice: I had the \\"buffalo style\\" sandwich. It was really, really awful. I've been GF for medical reasons for a long time and this was just sad. First, the protein replacement was a combination of jack-fruit AND tempeh. I struggled with the inconsistent variation between the two competing textures. The smell was off--when I brought it up to my face something registered as \\"don't swallow\\". Maybe the jack fruit was fermenting? Not sure, but it smelled and tasted on the verge of being bad. \\n\\nThe main GF component, the bread, was ok. Not the best GF bread I have had, but not bad. I think if you are using a lot of replacement components to a sandwich like this then the rest of the ingredients need to make up for the lack of real bread and the lack of real Buffalo Chicken. For example, the lettuce on the sandwich was just iceberg lettuce which was slimy and wilted. Why not finely chop some baby kale, red cabbage and spinach, toss it in some rice wine vinegar, and top with some pickled red onion? \\n\\nUnfortunately the sandwich was so bad after the second bite I tossed it. It was just really bad. I guess if it were my business I would try and be more creative with the presentation and ingredients. I'd also skip the jack fruit. It's hard to get right and if it isn't done correctly it's just slimy tastelessness with no nutritional value. \\n\\nLast bit of advice: hire a professional graphic designer to brand your business. Unfortunately right now your business is suffering from a lack of identity. You have a great story, but it's not being told correctly. Visually speaking, your peers at BPM are way ahead of you. It will make a difference at how your customer's perceive your business.

As in, a waiter had to go run to a nearby store to buy rolls or something. I wouldn't have cared as much, but we were never informed of this until I said something after waiting something like over a half hour for our appetizers. And we were right next to the kitchen (which is very small), so we clearly knew something was happening. It was during the day. That was a little annoying. \\n\\nThe second time I went was a dinner-into-drinks night and I had a blast. The band was great, the bouncer waived one of my friends' covers because we had been there since dinner, and the appetizers came out nice and hot. So, hit or miss. Great for a SMALL group.

One roll will easily fill you up.\\n\\nYou can choose from traditional seaweed or soy wrap, and your choice of two veggies, two meats, two toppings, and sauces. The result is an incredible mix of rich flavours. One criticism might be that because there are so many ingredients, it's hard to distinguish any ingredient in particular. If you eat sushi just for the fish and sashimi, then this might not be your type of place because it's all about the custom mish mash.\\n\\nSushi does take more time to assemble than a subway sandwich, so even with only three people in front of me I had to wait a really long time. Maybe they need more workers, although it's a small space. They need to find a way to streamline the sushi making. Still, service was good, they're quite friendly there.\\n\\nLastly, I really like the cute takeout box that you get. The custom packaging is a really nice touch, definitely stands out. I could imagine on a nice day, getting a take out box from here and eating it nearby on the beach.

It seems that perhaps the Tin Shed has found a niche in the Portland market that other businesses could exploit.\\n\\nBut really, it's a restaurant so it's the food that matters.  I'm allergic to pork, so eating breakfast out is always kind of a bummer for me.  Still, I love the vegetarian gravy (the mushroom flavor is bomb) and they have been very gracious in helping me make things work with my needs.  My dog also loves their pet menu and has enjoyed his dishes thoroughly.\\n\\nThe service is good but not overly fawning.  It sometimes takes a little effort to get noticed, but I've never felt ignored.

Bless you Austin for having such places.  \\n\\ninitial impression - as such the case with many Austin restaurants - very  nice aesthetics.  Not to say that there was something unique about the interior of Get Sum, it was just extremely well-lit and very clean.  As I would notice throughout my short lunch here - the employees are very prompt to bus and wipe down the tables almost immediately after someone finishes their meal.  That's always something to be appreciated. \\n\\nI can't recall exactly all what we ordered but I did upload the photos.  The menu is extremely helpful - noting what is vegetarian/vegan.  Takes the guesswork out and strikes out the need to engage in the usual, \\"Um so is this vegan?\\"\\n\\"Vegan?  What's that?\\" \\nAlso quite nice that you can order a la carte or from a couple of other combos.  If you're indecisive like me, this sort of accommodation can mean everything.  Just saying.  \\n\\nAs for the actual food - it was decent, but I can't say it was freaking amazing.  Where do I get off saying that when I don't have a point of reference?!  Well I just do!  The portions were modest, which I am totally fine with.  I dunno, I was satiated, but it wasn't like anything completely wowed me.  The fried items were superbly greasy - like they had been fried and left to simmer in their oil.

Being that this was my first time visiting Boulder I wanted to stay out and have some fun, thankfully Bartaco believes in a good time and they stay open late, thank goodness.

The bartender was on the inattentive side but the manager and I were chit chatting and he was super friendly. To his defense, the bar was on the busier side. I liked the atmosphere here, laid back, good music, people just hanging out. I have been to the bartaco in Nashville and thought it was a fun atmosphere there too so I expected this to be similar. I decided to order some food to go, I like that they have some healthy options on the menu. You can swap out a tortilla with lettuce, they have various grain bowls, big fan of all that. I went with three tacos, the cauliflower, their tuna tatako and seared swordfish, all on lettuce. Not really the thing to order to go, was a touch sloppy by the time I got back to my hotel, but nevertheless, delicious.

Half of our appetizers came out, along with some chips and salsa (which we had to ask for) shortly thereafter, but we still waited awhile for our margaritas.  That finally came and we were done with our first 2 appetizers before we had to get the waitress' attention to ask about the third, which turns out had been forgotten.  We were never checked on and had to waive down a waitress to get the bill.\\n\\nAs far as the food goes, it isn't anything special.  The salsa was okay, but the bowl of chips was tiny and they charged for extra.  The appetizers were also okay, but overpriced for what you got (Boloco or Chipotle offer better fare) and forgettable, with the exception of the empanadas, which were good.

The scenery is very inviting with luxury decor and a wonderful music selection but the dinning experience has left me traumatized. I ordered the N.O shrimp and grits and my friend had the steak. First her order came out and mines was wrong so while she ate I had to wait for my food. Finally after she's half way through her meal my food comes out COLD! Because I was so hungry I just asked the server to heat the food instead of remaking it. Not to mention the menu mentions a Baguette that comes with the meal and she continues to plead with me that's she's never seen that before. Well it's on the menu and I would like to have it. Finally my food comes out the microwave still with no baguette. She goes to the kitchen to show them their own menu and nobody seems to have knowledge of the baguette and she's still trying to push this concept in my face, honestly I don't care if you seen it before it's on the menu and I want it with the meal. She brings out a different baguette not one that comes with the dish and says management needs to fix the menu.

I walked in and the spicy aroma instantly reminds me of Southern California. They say we keep certain memories with smells the longest and Coffee Bean is certainly associated with Southern California to me. That is where I enjoyed my first experiences while cruising on my bike in Santa Monica. I was instantly greeted while I was browsing the breakfast items. The young girl, Dominique, had a bright and uplifting personality. This is a great person to have working behind the register because she made the experience instantly uplifting and happy. I ordered an ice vanilla latte and it was quickly prepared by the Batista, Trevor. He had a very calm and collected personality and did the things I believe Batista should do. He made my drink in a timely manner and established conversation with the customer. I believe the Batista should establish an experience while making the drink other wise I can make this at my home grumpy and tired lol. I also noticed a business lady near by quickly crunching away on her laptop not looking up for anything and the Batista finished her drink and actually brought it to her instead of calling her name repetitively like that one annoying monotoned teacher in elementary school taking role. *Even though she knows the person is there by face she just keeps repeating herself really annoying.* I am now enjoying my Iced latte and surfing the Internet!

The collard greens was a bit sweet and the rest was just okay. Now! The just okay items will not stop me from returning. I got to try the Ox Tails for their so famous for. Oh! I forgot I also got some blackberry cobbler. And that too was good, but it wasn't my grandmother's. \\nSeeing that I was there for so long waiting for my order, when I got home it was time to go to work.

Everyone who goes here has to try the portabello soup. The shitake mushrooms on top are so good...I wish it had some more. The soup is so creamy and just unlike any I've ever had before. I seriously need to learn to cook this.\\n\\nI had a cheese platter for my appetizer which had some honey that complimented one cheese, some berries to go with another, some walnut toast. This tray was a great variety and very tasty...I preferred two over the other two but loved sampling them all. \\n\\nFor my main entree I had the beef which was cooked perfectly with macaroni and cheese. Both just excellent. I was very full and had my dessert to go...a very chocolatey dessert and loved it back at my room.\\n\\nThe dining room was quite noisy on this trip as we were surrounded by tables of very drunk adults.

If you like tastier but smaller portions, go to ShabuZen or the Q. Hot Pot Buffet is convenient to where I work, and I am a fan of hot pots in the winter. HP Buffet is pretty good, not great. \\n\\nThey serve Chinese style hot pot, rather than Japanese shabu-- I don't know enough about the culinary differences to explain why the spicy hot Japanese broth is hotter than the spicy hot Chinese broth, but it seems to always be so and I like *hot*! I almost always get the mala. I've tried them all, though. They're a little bland.\\n\\nThey're one of the only hot pot places that always has frozen tofu, which I love! \\n\\nPortions are big, the food is fresh enough, but nothing blows me away. I like a ton of different veggies with a hot pot & am disappointed that something is always missing-- last night, it was the bok choi-- and catching a waiter once the food is delivered is not easy.\\n\\nHowever, this wouldn't make any difference if I were just going for quantity! I'm usually here alone or with one friend, and this might make a difference: this is theoretically an \\"All You Can Eat\\" place for $25ish. Wagyu & some seafood are extra, but I've stuck to the basics.

After seeing it this week on a Georgia Public Television special, I knew it was now or never. \\n\\nMy friend and I stopped in on a Saturday night around 5:30 p.m. When we walked in, there were a lot of people standing in the bar talking, but not many people actually dining. No matter. We stepped up to the host podium and were greeted warmly, then shown to a table.\\n\\nI was prepared for the rather cozy quarters and dated decor so that didn't surprise me. I liked it, actually. The traditional Italian tunes (some arias, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra) made it even better. I kept expecting Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro to walk in. It does get a bit noisy once the place starts filling up (and it did), but not to a point where we couldn't hear each other speak.\\n\\nOur waiter was on the young side and happy to explain the menu to us newcomers. He was not pushy and did not act put out when only one of us ordered wine. I liked the fact that you can order one of their large pastas as a side to a different dish. I've never seen heard of that before. The garlic bread was warm and toasty with plenty of oil. It was charred in a few small places, something I like. Very tasty, I could have eaten all of it easily.\\n\\nI ordered the chicken florentine with a side of fettucine alfredo. My friend got ravioli and cleaned her plate. The fettucine alfredo was not as hot as I would have liked but it still tasted delicious. Not too heavy and very creamy. The chicken was nicely cooked but not overdone with a zesty lemon flavor, covered in mushrooms. The side of cooked spinach was huge and while I am not a big spinach fan, this was cooked just long enough so it tasted good but wasn't overdone. The portions were generous so I took half home.\\n\\nFor dessert, we shared a canolli and it was fantastic. I have had cannoli in many places and this was in the top five. The pastry was tasty and had a good crunch. You could tell the filling was homemade and not too heavy, just delightful to taste. \\n\\nBefore we left, one of the owners came over to see how we were doing. He was a pleasure to talk to and was pleased when we mentioned seeing them on TV. It's nice to know that while they take care of the regulars, they are eager to see new faces as well.\\n\\nAlfredo's is definitely old school so you're not going to see any gastro-tech fancy tricks or uber hip dishes. But they do serve up traditional, tasty dishes with class and warmth. And that's not easy to find these days. I'll be back."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"This is my second review of The Ravenous Pig.

Definitely your best option for sushi around Hunters Creek.\\n\\nI came here for the AYCE sushi. As other reviewers have stated, instead of buffet service you have to get table service and order from the menu. This method forces you to be somewhat modest about how much you order, so I ended up consuming less than I might if I had unsupervised access to a giant buffet. They will happily serve you multiple orders, but waiting for the server and then waiting for the order to be made adds a lot of time between servings, creating another layer of portion control. It didn't bother me too much, but if you are looking for a place where you can eat your feelings until you don't feel anymore, you will probably not be happy. And as it turns out, I probably could have ordered a la carte from the menu and ended up paying the same price. \\n\\nAs far as the sushi goes, it's pretty good.

Waitress: I don't know what that is? EEK! Still in disbelief. Me: Well could you please ask someone who does know? (2 painful minutes later) Me: Hello, yes our waitress wasn't sure; can I get pancetta with my pasta? Waiter: We don't have pancetta sir. WTF? His words hit me like a punch to the groin! Me: This is an Italian restaurant correct? Waiter: Yes sir it is. Waitress interrupting: What's pancetta? Me: It's fucking Italian bacon for Christ sake! \\n\\nIt's one thing for an Italian eatery to not offer it but yet another for the staff to not know what it is. For now they remain on my boycott list."},{"name":"Gandhi's An East Indian Cafe","address":"827 SW 2nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I guess I'm a bit puzzled by the (granted, not all that many) negative reviews.\\n\\nI've been a fan of Gandhi's for years, and I remember with fondness the days I could walk there from my office, 2 or 3 times a week.  The positive things about Ganhi are obvious, and it's why the place has such a loyal following.  The food here is cheap, the portions sizeable, and waits for service brief (usually).  It's a great place for local office workers to come and get a quick bite before heading back to work.  Quality is pretty good; I wouldn't call it great.  However, I've always walked away feeling comfortably full, after a pleasant and generally delicious meal.\\n\\nThat being said, it's important to keep in mind what's going on here.  The food is prepared well in advance, then kept in heated containers, which the owner will ladle onto your plate (either over your rice, or on the side).  This is very much a no frills cafe, and if you're expecting a gourmet, white linen table cloth affair, definitely go elsewhere (or expect to be disappointed).   The owner (and usually one helpmate) are crammed into a very small corner of the building, and service consists of you telling the owner what you want (or pointing to what you want), and having him ladle the \\"entrees\\" over a big scoop of white rice.  Food is served on a paper plate, or you can get it in a plastic container to go.  They also give you some naan and \\"condiments\\" (if you want them) that consists of several different sauces (I have no idea what they're called,but they all taste pretty good and go well with the spicy tomato and spinach dish I always order) and some chopped cilatro.  Don't go here for the bread.\\n\\nThis place is great for what it is.  \\n\\nI would also caution folks coming here that when the owner says something is spicy, he means it.

Dogs everywhere and blankets to warm you if you get cold.\\n*Ordered the Veggie Pesto scramble with Shed potato cakes, which is basically everything I love (roasted yam, zucchini, sweet onions and garlic in a pesto sauce) all swimming together in goodness.\\n*Buttermilk biscuit with a pot of jam.

Four stars = restraint.  I can enjoy the experience on an intellectual level and everything is pleasing.  Five stars = I will stab you with a fork if you get between me and my food.

We ordered the filet mignon and lobster tail teppanyaki dinner for two ($49.95 per person).  I've been to many Japanese teppanyaki restaurants in the past, they usually serve all the meat first, then vegetable to follow.  With Yokohama Teppanyaki, they just give you whatever to eat in their convenience.  The party sitting beside us had finished their meat courses and the chef was cooking vegetables for them.  For the chef convenience, he cooked enough portion of veg for the whole table, so our first course was vegetables.  I was wondering a bit as I was expecting to have the main course first.  Finally, we had our main courses, but the food quality was really disappointing, the lobster tail had a salty taste, and the filet mignon tasted like it had been past expiry for a long time.  The explanation from the waitress was that they aged the beef for 28 days for good purpose, but we didn't get it cause it tasted like garbage ( btw, it was very chewy, its not an ordinary filet mignon, and we did not finish it). For the last course, fried rice: while the chef was cooking, one of the customer sitting nearby sneezed onto two bowls of already fried rice, the chef did noticed but he still gave those two contaminated rice to his customers, unfortunately, my guest and I were the two who got those two bowls of rice.  I refused to have it and told the chef that I've seen a person sneezed on it, the chef just said ok and took the rice away.  He had no intention to recook another rice for us, we waited quite a bit ( almost 20 mins watching him cooking other stuff for other customers), therefore we decided to just skip the rice and pay the bill.  While paying the bill, I mentioned about the rice to the waitress.  After we paid the bill, the chef finally told us that he will recook our rice for us, but its too late, cause our plates and chopsticks had already been taken away by one of the staff.  So....., terrible experience!

Spinach dumplings, chicken dumplings, veggie dumplings, some jasmine tea, and a whole order to take home (Had to use up the whole gift card from groupon,com) and ran me about $15 with the discount. I was very full when I left and super happy about the food overall. \\n\\nThe menu system is a little weird - sharpees and wipe-off menus. Seems kind of archaic, but it did not bother me that much. I plan to return. \\n\\nService and food prep was turned on a dime without sacrifice to quality of the dishes, which were stacked nicely atop one another to make for a little Asian Tower of Dim Sum. The system kept uneaten food hot."},{"name":"753 South","address":"753 South St","city":"Roslindale","stars":"4.5","text":"My husband and I only had drinks.

I don't know why I came here, even after reading all these reviews and noting the mediocre 2.5-star rating. I so desperately wanted to give the Dumpling Room the benefit of the doubt, especially because it really sucks to shlep over to Chinatown when one is craving the XLB (xialongbao/soup dumplings).\\n\\nWe asked the woman behind the counter if they did soup dumplings, and she said yes. We got an order of that as well as the Emperor, which had chicken, pork, and shrimp. The soup dumps were NOT SOUPY and the skin was so thick that I felt like a lion gnawing at the carcass of a dead antelope trying to get my share of meat. Dumpling Room claims on its Facebook page that they serve 'juicy buns' and not 'soup dumplings'. A) In my 20-something years of being Chinese American (and a glutton/Chinatown fiend in general) juicy buns have always been equated with soup dumplings. The Google will also back me up on that one. B) If they aren't soup dumplings, then don't have your staff FALSELY ADVERTISE that they are. Plain and simple.\\n\\nOn a side note, the Emperor dumplings were pretty meh. It's a slightly strange combination of meat, but it's nothing that a huge glob of plum sauce can't solve. FYI - prices are a little high for the size of the dumps you get. They fried the dumpling skin pretty nicely, though, so I will give them that.\\n\\nIt seems like the D.

We arrived a little late and decided to sit at the bar so we wouldn't have to wait for a table.  \\n\\nThey had the three course menus and one of the appetizers we ordered was the veal meatball which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious on previous occasions.  It came out completely charred on one side and was clearly overcooked.  We sent the meatball back and sure enough the next one came out a few minutes later and it was the same way.  It seemed like the kitchen tried to doctor up the second one with more cheese and marinara sauce which didn't help.  We sent that one back too and here's where it got worse.\\n\\nThe owner came up to us with our partially eaten meatball in hand and proceed to eat a bite out of the pot that we just sent back!  She said that there was nothing wrong with it.  I've never been more disgusted or insulted in my entire life.  Then she asked if we wanted a 3rd meatball or have it taken off of the check.  My boyfriend said he wanted to think about it and she responded saying, \\"Well I'll have another one ready to go for you to take home.\\"  At that rate we were flabbergasted and he told her to just take it off of our check.  \\n\\nLuckily the entrees were prepared well (beef short ribs and fusilli with prosciutto.)  We were too full for dessert and asked to have them boxed up.  To our surprise when we got home, they had messed up our dessert order as well.  Perhaps they ran out of creme brule and decided that chocolate cake was an acceptable alternative??\\n\\nI do realize that they were incredibly busy with it being the last night of restaurant week but management could have planned better and had more workers on the schedule.  \\n\\nThis experience was very disappointing to say the least and what used to be our favorite spot to go to for a bottle of wine and dinner has fallen to the bottom of the list."},{"name":"Story Book Dining at Artist Point with Snow White","address":"901 Timberline Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"One of the best filets I've had.

The tomatoes had a few small pieces of a frozen gel or juice type thing in it which provided an interesting texture and a very tasty leaf (I'm not quite sure what kind) as well as cured beef ( very thinly shredded imagine thin threads like saffron)\\nI can't quite give you all the details of the clams but it wasn't really what I expected ( I was thinking clams in the shell) there was again a cold component ( the dish was served room temperature or so) it was like a foam/ or meringue type substance.\\nI think the clams were my least favorite dish.\\nThe mushrooms we had were very good and the presentation on a wooden board was lovely.

And then I obviously had a premature seniors moment. Anyway, I have been maybe half a dozen times but had only had drinks and appies until the last two, both within the past week.\\n\\nFirst, the obvious selling feature of this place is the location. You can sit on their patio and people watch to your heart's content, with the beautiful setting of the seawall and False Creek in the background. Also it is a fun sports bar during playoff time, if you want to catch the game and have some drinks with a big group. Appies are decent, too, and excellent value if you come when they're half price.\\n\\nBut beyond those comments, I have to say I was pretty impressed with the quality and generous portions on the two occasions that I did have dinner here recently. I say that because both times I had a seafood dish (the seafood salad and the seafood risotto) and they did not skimp on the \\"seafood\\" portion of the meal, like some places would. The seafood salad was tasty but I do think they could do a bit more to jazz up the salad part of the dish (ie. add a few more veggies or a bit more variety to the bed of greens). However I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the seafood risotto. First of all, I wouldn't call it a risotto (although it is arborio rice). I would call it a jambalaya because it comes with a really tasty, spicy tomato-based sauce and contains seafood and chorizo sausage. But whatever it was, it was piled high with seafood and super delicious. I would definitely go back and order that again. My fellow diner also enjoyed her fajitas (which were probably enough for two people, especially if you ordered a salad or small appetizer to go with). Best of all, I tried their cosmo for the first time and it was also really good (although I do find it hard to argue with cranberry juice, lime and vodka put together).\\n\\nOur server was also great. She was attentive and friendly and made sure that everything was OK with our meal, and that we always had water without us having to ask. Overall, a very good experience.

The atmosphere and ambiance were set by the dim lighting, white table clothes and candles lit on each and every table...setting the mood nicely. As expected, the wait staff are top knotch and treat you like royalty. Their knowledge is impeccable when it comes to the wines and food on the menu. After ordering drinks, everyone receives a platter with melba toasts and various spread. Although I'm not big on steak, I felt obligated to order a filt mignon since we were in a steakhouse. It was AMAZING! It practically melted in my mouth and was cooked just as I asked...as rare as you can get. I've also had the scallops and fish, which are equally as satisfying. My boyfriend ordered the T-bone steak and loved it. All items comes a la carte, meaning you order the sides separately. I highly recommend the potatoes and asparagus, but all of them sound yum-o.\\n\\nAs far as wines go, this place has all of the best name brands including my favorite, conundrum.

Cooked as requested and flavorful. I subbed fries for their \\"Cuban\\" mac and cheese because it sounded so unique and I love swiss cheese. Great decision. It was tangy and salty with little pops of pickle.

Normally the classic burger is $8.95, so we decided to get the special. \\n\\nYou get to pick 2 toppings for the burger. My husband's topping was pimento cheese and apple wood smoked Bacon. He gives a thumbs up.\\nHis side was saut√©ed spinach..it was fine...not much you can do with spinach..unless you put lots of butter on it but then that defeats the purpose of trying to eat something healthy.\\n\\nMy topping was fontina cheese and apple wood smoked bacon.

It was basically just 1 chicken boneless chicken breast breaded and fried. This meal is not worth $12.95 at all.\\n\\nI ordered Shrimp, Chicken and Sausage Rigatoni - I can honestly say this was probably the most HORRIBLE dish I have ever ordered from Atlanta in the 9 months I've been living her. The sauce tasted like something straight out a cheap jar of sauce, like RAGU. It's definitely not home made sauce. I really did try to eat it because I was really hungry and I did not want to waste $15.95 but after a few bites I had to stop. Since I was home, we ordered take out. I did my best to doctor up this horrible pasta dish. I put the pasta in a colander and washed off the gross sauce. I then heated up a better jar of spicy tomato sauce by Classico. I covered the pasta and this sauce and added Pecorino grated cheese...this helped improve the flavor.\\n\\nAfter this order, we probably will only order burgers."},{"name":"Century Bar","address":"930 SE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"My go to place to watch a big game.

The left side of the tavern is mostly table seating with plush booths in the corners.  \\n\\nI had visited the tavern only a few times for drinks and bar bites and overall it was a good experience.  Staff was friendly and food was good.  What really impressed me was thier semi-private area in the back of the restuarant, which has seating for about 40 or so and seperate bar area.  I planned a gathering for about 10 of my friends and usually booking this room exclusively costs a $1000 food/bev min.

Our company got a group rate, so I didn't have to spend as much as the room actually cost, which was nice. \\n\\nThe staff at the front desk were kind and helpful, but whoever controls staffing needs a jolt to the head. When you have a group f nearly 3,000 staying in your hotel for a convention, all checking in and out on the same days... you'd think you'd staff appropriately for that. \\nNOPE. \\n\\nLuckily I was smart and arrived a day before everyone else so I didn't have the headache checking in, but checking out was a complete nightmare. Hour long wait for the bell hop, Even worse for the front desk, and don't even get me started about the refrigerators...\\n\\nThe rooms themselves though are incredibly lovely. Beautiful feather pillows, most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in, ipod clock dock, and a freaking TV in the mirror in the bathroom! \\n\\nThe refrigerators are a whole thing though. Each room has a mini fridge in it, which is great if you are there for a convention for a few days. You can go down to the WalMart up the street and buy some food and stock your little fridge. However, they are high efficiency refrigerators, so the outside grows incredibly warm... making a lot of people thing that they are broken. I can't even imagine how often the Peabody moves people from room to room or replaces refrigerators. But here is the part that really shocked me...\\nThe bell hop doesn't have a fridge to put cold items in! So if you arrive early and want to check your stuff into bellhop before you can check into room, or if you check out before you leave and need to store your items with bell hop... you better hope you don't have any cold items.. because they can't be accommodated. \\nWhen we checked out (check out is at noon) we still had the rest of the convention to attend (went until 5pm) and we were moving to another hotel that night that was on Disney property so that we could enjoy the next 4 days at DisneyWorld. This meant that we wanted to take all our food items from the Peabody with us to the new hotel; milk, beer, cut mangos, wine, hummus, olive tapenade, and some other things. When we took a bag of all the food items down to the bell desk though, we were told that there is no where to put the items or to store them for the next 5 ish hours. \\n\\nSo I went to the front desk and begged them to help me. The girl at the front desk was kind and helpful and put my items in a Peabody bag, wrapped it up tight, and wrote my name all over it. She told me it would go in their personal fridge in the back and to just give my name when I left so it could be retrieved for me. \\n\\nI go back at the end of the convention to retrieve my items. \\nNowhere to be found. \\nI'm not sure if it was incompetence on the part of the taker or the retriever, but somewhere they screwed up. I complained. They gave me $20. I left satisfied, but still irritated that they don't have a fridge in the first place. \\n\\nBut other than this nonsense, I was very please with my stay at the hotel, and - if given a discount again - would be happy to stay at the Peabody."},{"name":"City Barbeque","address":"2511 Blackmon Dr","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"So much fat in our meal it grossed us out. \\nBoth in pork in chicken plate. \\nNot sure we will come back or not."},{"name":"El Potro Mexican Grill","address":"61 Union Sq","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"4 stars for food, 2 stars for service, 2 stars for ambiance\\n\\nThe food itself was actually much better than expected.

It's a fast casual order at the counter and they call your number and you grab your tacos. There are so many options that I only was able to try two of the options this first go around. I got the #2 Rotisserie Chicken and #12 Angus Brisket. The chicken was definitely the best of the two, the tortilla on the other one was too crispy it broke when you ate it so then everything went everywhere, Not saying the chicken ones content didn't end up going everywhere too. Maybe it you had plates or something it would be better to save your contents, but it was good I didn't let it go to waste. The crisp tots were good as well, definitely a large side and worth sharing. \\n\\nThe only down side for me was the red velvet cake (odd since it's in the name) it was dry dry dry and not very flavorful nor sweet without the sauce. I was not a fan one bit of the cake, which is unfortunate since I love dessert, but lucky for me there is a cupcake joint in the same area that knows Red Velvet. \\n\\nI'd come back for tacos and the corn next time. Can't wait to give all the tacos a try. No cake though, save yourself the money on the cake and get another taco or side instead.\\n\\nParking is a super pain though, since well it's the Domain you have the parking garage options but good luck there.

The ramen broth present d on the saltier side of broths, which was hard to finish because I kept following it up with sips of water. Broths are the most important factor of how good a bowl of ramen tastes to me, so that took away a couple stars from my review. The rice dish was also just alright; we got the eel dish, in which the sauce tasted a bit off. I did enjoy the complimentary soup and our gyoza appetizer. Th gyozas were fried to a crisp and the dipping sauce had the perfect amount of tanginess to celebrate compliment the fillings.\\n\\nSERVICE: 3.5\\nService was quick but very impersonable.

I asked about the booths in the bar area and was told that you can have happy hour at those booths, but only with reservations. My friend and I sat at the long tables and the accompanying bar stools were uncomfortable. The bartender served us and when I asked her if happy hour was only served where we are seated, she told me happy hour was served anywhere in the restaurant. I went back to the unhappy host and told him what the bartender told me, and he repeated that happy hour was only at the long tables. Every worker in this restaurant seemed frustrated. There was a very pretentious air to the way customers were treated- like they were annoyed that people didn't already know how this place worked. I saw several people come in after us who had the same questions because they had never been there and the staff was neither friendly nor helpful. My friend and I ordered one drink each and decided to take our business elsewhere. I don't think I saw one employee smile while I was there.

Gone is the bizarre stage and haphazard tabling, replaced by a half-dozen hibachi grills, a sushi bar surrounded by table seating and a large chariot display/fountain.  About the only thing carried over from the old layout is the ample bar in the southeast corner of the restaurant.

The hibachi table shows are well-executed and interactive and the sushi fresh.  The kitchen, likewise, is dependable.\\n\\nArguably the best thing about Ginza, however, is that it's not Benihana.  It's hard to say how popular the new location will become, but early in its existence, crowds have been eminently tolerable, with neither the long wait for seating nor lack of elbow space present at everyone's favorite hibachi chain.\\n\\nAlso nice about Ginza are its very reasonable prices (the $13.95 hibachi special is a downright steal), and late hours ('til 10pm during the week, 11pm on Friday and Saturday).\\n\\nOverall, Ginza is a quality option for Japanese cuisine, especially given the paucity of hibachi restaurants in Orlando.  In particular, it's an excellent Japanese bookend (along with the Bikkuri, a couple miles east) to the Mills 50 Asian cuisine district."},{"name":"Nook","address":"781 Denman Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Excellent Food, I have been a fan for a few years.

It would be the WORST place I have frequented. \\nOnce a hostess spotted my fiance and me amidst the crowd of servers, she directed us to follow another hostess to our table--with the only problem being that we had to weed our way through a thicket of servers blocking the pathway. Only after firmly stating, \\"Excuse me,\\" to them did the black donned crowd part like the red sea.\\nStill, I hadn't give up hope yet. I'm all for second chances, refusing to judge a book by it's cover. It was once the waiter brought me my cocktail in a dirty martini glass with seeds floating in it did I admit defeat. You see, my cocktail did not contain any ingredients that would have seeds in them-only vodka and a flavored liquor. The waiter tried to convince me they were just ice shards- ahem, brown ice shards? Methinks not. \\nThen the food arrived. Our waiter was too busy chatting it up with his fellow comrades to actually bring the food himself, so another waiter was kind enough to take over his duties. My fiance had ordered a burger well-done, perhaps the least challenging of all burger temperatures. But the kitchen hadn't quite mastered such a feat, as his patty arrived in a medium fashion. The fish tacos I ordered were bland-at least the parts I got to munch on while batting away the flies from our table.\\nWhen the waiter finally brought our check, I hardly recognized him, seeing as he had only been at our table to take our order and bring us the check (luckily I'd made the decision to ration my water early in the evening). My fiance then did the unthinkable. After working in the kitchen of a restaurant for years, he ALWAYS leaves at least 20% on a check. Even if the service is terrible, he defends the kitchen may get tipped out as he scrawls away a generous tip. But as I peered over at him writing, he was leaving less than a 10% tip, attesting to the fact he has never had a worse experience. \\nFellow yelpers, I implore you, stay away from this establishment.

You pick out all the fixings here, inc. meat, veggies, sauces, spices and other misc items (egg!) and then take it up to the grill where the showmen running the grill do their thing and cook up all that delicious food.  One criticism my friends used to have was the limited amount of choices of meat, it used to be just beef, chicken and seafood for the most part but they have really expanded upon the choices as of the last couple of years and now have sausage, sometimes crawfish and all kinds of interesting combinations.\\n\\nI have a couple of hints for you at this place, whether or not you're a newbie or a veteran to it.  First of all, go when it's not too busy, that way you can get a bigger bowl (extra trips cost more) on the first go round by getting the VEGGIES FIRST.  If you do that you can pack the meat on top of the veggies and get more in your bowl.   I've been known to stack mine about a foot tall and get three meals out of one trip to the grill.  They may joke with you about charging extra or whatnot but they won't have a problem with it, trust me, I have done it a hundred times at various BD Monglians.  \\n\\nMy second tip is quite simple, don't be afraid to experiment and see if you strike gold!  And lastly, and this one's very very important, remember to get three little bowls of sauce.  That's right THREE!!  Most people only get one and I have learned from experience that isn't enough.  \\n\\nI love this place and swear I'd eat here once a week if my fiance liked it as well.  She likes it ok but it's just not exactly her cup of tea a lot of times so we just only occasionally get over to a BD Mongolians.  \\n\\nOh and don't forget to register with Club Mongo, you will get a free stir-fry on your birthday!"},{"name":"The Busy Bee Cafe","address":"810 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I had heard that this place was pretty good.

Their stuff is typically mild, but if you don't like spice just ask about it when you order. I love everything I've tried there, and their chai tea is very good.

The sauce is a little thin for what I'm used to, but totally delicious and the meat is incredibly well-cooked.

I've lived in Atlanta for a long time and pick up sandwiches and dessert from here a couple times a year when it's convenient and to keep giving it a chance. I'm disappointed each time. Today I had an egg salad sandwich and cheese Benny that reminded me why I don't come here regularly, but also made me forget why I perennially give it another shot.  The wheat bread hardly qualifies as such with barely there specks of brown in it. The texture and off white color was like off the shelf white Texas toast. If it's baked in house they should not bother with the effort. There is better whole grain bread at Publix. The egg salad (one of my fave foods that I try everywhere that it's served) is meh and tastes mostly of pickles. And they only give you a super thin schmear and is not a satisfying sandwich portion. I've had other deli sandwiches here in the past and I always had regret choosing Henri's over some other place. The cheese Benny was not a flaky pastry. Chewy, bland, and not worth calling a pastry.

This is the absolute worst Subway I've ever been to in my entire life... and I eat a LOT of Subway. I really, really wish I could give this place negative 5 stars because it's that bad. I don't even think I can even think of any other non-Subway restaurant or fast food joint with service this bad. It's THAT bad, and I don't know how the employees there have been working for so long, or why that Subway is still open. \\n\\nFirst things first, the UBC Student Union Building (SUB) isn't necessarily an oasis of food selection. You can get sushi, pizza, coffee, pastries, burgers, Chinese food, and some other basic food-court fare. There are also a few hidden gems in this building but they usually close earlier, so Subway is usually one of the only options when you're stuck in the centre of campus in the evening. \\n\\nI've ordered from this specific Subway location maybe about 4 or 5 times during my time here at UBC, but try and avoid it as much as I can. As a lover of Subway sandwiches, this place is truly a sorry excuse. None of my experiences here have ever been positive, and I decided to finally write this review after having a horrendous experience there today, when I had no choice but to eat there. This was my final time of ever ordering from this location. I've had enough of wasting my money here only to leave pissed off.\\n\\nThere were about 5 employees working. There were 2 customers in front of me and a few behind me, waiting in line. The employees did not acknowledge the customers before me (who were standing patiently) for a good 2 minutes. The moment they started both their sandwiches, they decided to start sandwiches for 5 people, including myself. They always seem to be making as many sandwiches as possible at once, which basically messes with everyone's orders.\\n\\nI ordered a footlong steak & cheese. I LOVE my steak & cheese sandwiches and always make sure to load them up with every vegetable to the fullest. Whenever I order this sandwich from any other Subway, the \\"artist\\" could barely close it because of how much veggies are loaded into it. Yum! As a broke student, I want my money's worth.\\n\\nAnyways, the lady who took my order and pulled the bread out barked at me for no apparent reason. Second lady who put the cheese on, threw the cheese onto my sandwich as if it was diseased or something, threw it in the toaster, and toasted it for too long. If you frequent Subway as much as I do, you notice that they practically scramble to get the sandwich out of the toaster as soon as it beeps. Well, they left it in for a little bit and all the sandwiches in there ended up looking quite crisp (not a good thing).\\n\\nNow with the veggies, like I mentioned, I load them up to the fullest (but I only ask for extra when it comes to pickles and olives). Well, I got half a handful of lettuce, four misshapen tomato slices (2 of them being the \\"butts\\" of the tomato), 6 slices of olives (which makes up about an olive and a half) when I asked for extra, and a pinch of everything else. For reference, I get Subway quite often, and having a standard amount of veggies should make the sandwich hard to close. \\n\\nAt that point, I was pretty damn disappointed, especially since I ordered one of the most expensive sandwiches. I get to the till, and the head grouchy lady barks the price to me. There were two sandwiches on the counter, one of them being the pizza sub of the guy behind me. His sandwich was ready to be rung through as well, so after I was told the price, I asked the cashier lady \\"for the steak and cheese, right?\\" just so the price is correct. She said yes in an awful tone and I paid. I grabbed my sandwich, and asked her \\"steak and cheese?\\" to make sure I was taking the right sub. She grouchily muttered \\"YES\\". Ok lady, calm down. \\n\\nI picked the sub up and I couldn't believe how light it was. Granted, the subs I'd get from this location were always feather-light because of how much they skimp out on the ingredients, so although I was disappointed, I sort of expected it.\\n\\nI basically grabbed Subway for the purpose of having non-smelly, non-leaky, easily transportable, convenient food, especially since I was heading to a class. So I got what I wanted... or did I? I got to class, opened up my sandwich, and was quite annoyed as to how flat and pathetic it looked. I then open it up and it was a PIZZA SUB!!! The pizza sub of the guy that was standing behind me at Subway! At this point, I was fuming, but I couldn't go back. I ate the pizza sub in anger and dismay. Sigh.\\n\\nSo all in all... AVOID THIS SUBWAY LIKE THE PLAGUE!!! RUN! There is a new Subway in the UBC Village, about a 5 minute walk from the SUB. Do yourselves a favour and GO THERE! The difference in service and quality of food is ASTOUNDING. They actually smile and make your sandwich with care, even with all the crazy line-ups!

I added the house slaw, black bean salsa, and avocado aioli as accompaniments. I'm drooling as I write this. I wish I could turn back time and eat lunch again. Lol! The seared ahi tuna was really hearty. Think a rich buttery steak but in seafood form! The add ons were also spectacular and well thought out. The slaw was crisp and refreshing! The star of the bowl in my opinion. Because I checked in via yelp, I got a side of hush puppies for FREE! As if the generous rice bowl wasn't enough, four hush puppies sealed the lunch deal. I've never had hush puppies until today and had zero clue what I was in for. Apparently hush puppies are equivalent to a party in your mouth. These corn fritters were a sweet yet slightly salty mouthful. They were crispy on the outside but soft inside. Give me 100 more of them and a pair of baggy pants! \\n\\nI am beyond impressed with the food and will probably come again before next weekend. However, I am disappointed that this establishment chooses to offer plastic ware to dine in patrons. It's wasteful and unnecessary.

Hefty, left me full. My dad had the lamb shoulder and he really enjoyed that. They only have 1 beer on tap and it was okanagan, so it was prettty meh. My mom had the shrimp skewers which she liked.

Having been there a couple years ago (and having good memories of it), we were looking forward to going back with a couple friends who live nearby.\\n\\nWe ordered a lot of food among the four of us. Dishes that stood out in particular: the oxtail, the arros negre, and the sunchoke salad. Everything else was just fine (pulpo, peppers, goat cheese/beet, garbanzos), etc. The patatas bravas, a solid way to judge a tapas place, were nicely prepared. Desserts were terrible, though: the Mel I Mato was far too sour and the gastrique tasted more like balsamic than sherry. The almond torte had a weird consistency and didn't taste all that good.\\n\\nService was subpar. It is a PET PEEVE when servers don't say what they're out of first thing to the table (we ordered two dishes that we were then later told they were out of). That's service 101! All the dishes came out at once, hot before cold even, indicating that the kitchen wasn't on point. Our server/s were also the bartenders, so either they were overly attentive (because they didn't communicate with each other about our table being helped) or they were both missing when behind the bar.\\n\\nOur experience last time was much better and four stars.

The paleolithic diet, as glorious as it is for its health benefits, has been a source of constant angst.  Now I must grapple with profound guilt every time a refined sugar comes near my mouth.  And so, on a rainy Portland day, I stumbled bleary-eyed and hungry upon the noodles & company location in Pearl district.  After strictly (well its all relative) adhering to the paleo diet for one month (hmm time can be so subjective), I decided to treat myself to the holy grail of anti-paleolithic friendly chow.  I ordered the japanese udon noodles because i can still remember it like it was yesterday the sensation of those voluptuous chewy noodles dancing in my mouth.  I monopolized the largest table possible (since I needed to strategize for table space in case there would be a 2nd or 3rd bowl of noodles).  A pleasant waitress brought me the steaming pile of goodness and I went to work.....\\n\\nVERDICT: Noodles that taste JUST LIKE MY GRANDMA made them....if my grandma had no memory of her brief life in China before she was adopted as the token chinese daughter into a really really white (but really really nice) family whose idea of cultural exposure was standing at the foot of the gates to Portland's chinatown (but never entering because God forbid the junkies needed drug money).  But my Grandma was as chinese as a chinese grandma could get--even refusing to relinquish the chopsticks when the rest of us ate pizza with our hands like cavemen.  The noodles tasted like Brittany decided to follow Paula Dean's food network recipe for Asian Noodles.  I am literally kicking myself for coming to this gimmicky 'Round the World in ten noodle/pasta dishes' joint to celebrate the breaking of my paleolithic diet.  \\n\\n(My 3-stars are entirely for the soda fountain's zero-calorie grape FANTA and endless free refills thereof.)"},{"name":"Jack's Pizza & Wings","address":"676 Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Nice hole in the wall spot to grab a slice late night.

Even though they are partially a bakery, they have a variety of gluten-free treats shipped in weekly from a gluten-free bakery in/near Boston. They have gluten-free bread and wraps for all of their sandwiches. \\n\\n(AND they don't charge extra for gf bread!!)\\n\\nThere are a lot of vegetarian sandwiches, and a lot of vegan or vegan-option sandwiches as well. And sometimes vegan treats, too. (Not sure if that's all the time or just sometimes.) Wow!\\n\\nService: The owners and employees are always SUPER nice. They will also go way out of their way if, like, you are looking for something that is gluten-free but ALSO vegan but doesn't have cilantro in it -- whatever weirdo issue you might have. \\n\\nThe down side is that the service is usually slow for no reason, unless you are just running in to grab a dessert and run out. Sandwiches take longer than they should.\\n\\nIf you are there with friends though, it's easy to be distracted by the board games or tv screens while you wait, so I don't think it's such a big deal. \\n\\nBut back to the sandwiches, I think they taste great! Everything I have had at Coven has been delicious. The prices aren't cheap, but they're not ridiculous, either. Their house dressing is tasty. Breakfast is pretty cheap. Their desserts are good, too.

It seems like the restaurant is slightly geared toward sports fans, so if you're going there to watch a game, it *might* be crowded, but I can't say for sure since I honestly don't care about sports and I always seem to show up when a sporting event isn't taking place.\\n\\nThe decor is pleasant, and all of the staff that I've interacted with have been totally friendly and helpful. And whoever is in charge of the radio needs some props because they usually play a lot of songs from the 90s, so I can sing along to some Weezer as I'm waiting for my food.\\n\\nAnd the food is great. I've tried a few of their burgers and sandwiches as well as their ribs and nachos. All of those were on point. Each table has a selection of different types of BBQ sauces for you to add some flair to your meal. The prices are fair. Not once have I felt that I was paying too much for something.\\n\\nThe food comes out fast, but it's always well prepared and the meals aren't messy. They never feel like they were hastily put together. They run their kitchen like a well oiled machine.\\n\\nAll of the times I've been here, they haven't been super busy, so I have time to shoot the breeze with my friends for a while after our meals, and we never feel rushed to get out of the restaurant.\\n\\nIf you're looking for some good BBQ style food and some great burgers, give Smokey Bones a go. If it's a holiday, and you can't find somewhere to eat, Smokey Bones has got your back. \\n\\nAlso, one final plus, the last time I came here, there actually was some football game going on, and there were a lot of sportsball fans in there cheering for whatever happened with the ball.

I went the other day for the first time with my wife and for our first course we had the charcuterie board which was awesome I ate the chicken liver mousse all by myself it was great we also had the pretzel which to me was a little bit overcooked and not really flavorful next came the salad which was probably one of the best I've ever had with a herb yogurt dressing for our main course I ordered the venison and my wife ordered the pork porterhouse which we have heard is very delicious when the food came out the plates were presented beautifully and I took my first bite of venison the first thing I noticed was that it was cold I ordered it medium rare but the outside should have had some heat to it so I told the server and she brought it back meanwhile my wife cut into her pork porterhouse she ordered it medium well and it came out more like well done and was really dry and not too flavorful the marmalade on the plate was very good. We didn't want to return that because then we would have been waiting for 2 meals to come out of the kitchen again my venison came back shortly afterwards and to be completely honest it was cold again I don't know how they cook it I believe they said they finished it in the oven but to me there was no heat on the outside of the venison still hungry I ate it because I wanted to eat already after that we ordered the pigtails for dessert they were like a funnel cake shaped like a pig tail covered in of some kind of cinnamon sugar those were delicious not to be left out I had I believe the ravenous pig old-fashioned which was one of the best drinks I've had.

My family is Greek and I convinced a group of 10 people to have dinner here the other night.   First of all, the patio wasn't ready for people at 6pm when they opened.  No big deal, we hung out downstairs until they were ready and then relocated to the rooftop.  \\n\\nHere is where the two stars come in, the patio is nice, it was lovely sitting out there except for the fact that they're still figuring out the right balance on music and TV volume.  However, good luck if you want to actually eat or drink anything.  First off, they were already \\"out\\" of three dishes when they opened, and I had to ask several times for a diet Coke, even though this was at the point of the evening when the waitstaff outnumbered the patrons.  \\n\\nThe biggest problem was that everyone's food came out at wildly different times - 3 people were served fairly promptly, then 20 minutes later another entree came out, 30 minutes later another two, until finally the girl who ordered the salad for dinner was still waiting after everyone else had been served (total wait time well over an hour).  Food quality was ok but most people's meals came out lukewarm...not surprising when you read the next paragraph.  \\n\\nIn fact, I went downstairs to ask what was happening with the last 2 dishes (the aforementioned salad and a couple of appetizers one gal ordered in lieu of an entree).  The waitress had the appetizers on her tray and said she was taking them upstairs.  I continued speaking with the manager, used the restroom, went back upstairs, and she still hadn't arrived with the food on her tray.  Five minutes later she shows up with the same tray and the same food and gives it to my friend.  It is now cold of course, and heaven knows what she was walking around doing with it all that time.   \\n\\nOh but it gets worse.  The waitress had asked everyone to start a tab even though were were eating dinner, and then it took 30 minutes after everyone asked for their bills for her to sort out who owed what, even though she had put everything on separate tabs.  (Which by the way was the reason we were told the food came out at such odd times, even though we'd all ordered at the same time).  \\n\\nThe manager told me they were going through \\"growing pains\\" - well they should not have opened up until they were ready to handle their business.  The bar was less than one-quarter full the night we were there, and half the people we saw were only ordering drinks, so the kitchen needs to get its act together.  As for the waitstaff, they seemed to have never eaten in a restaurant before, much less worked in one.

After speaking with the store manager I was still left with a, \\"are you kidding me\\" feeling so I called the main office in Brockton.  I have made 5 phone calls in the last week, 3 to the General Manager's line, Jaimie and 2 to David White's line.  I saw to their \\"lines\\" because,no one answeres the phone ever.  And, sadly no one, has ever called me back to find out what the servvice experience was or to make an offer to fix it.  I assume David White is an the/an owner and I also assume he could care less about speaking to a customer about service.  If the management at Whites is so sure of themselves that they can't find the time or care enough to call a customer back then, that must be a wonderful over confident feeling.  You may think you have a lock on the market because of your Derby Street location, but there is another bakery right down the street who provides a great product and great service.  And there are many others as well.  You may have a convenient location but your service has cracks in it and you clearly don't know what great service is all about.

Most weekends, we like to go out and have a nice little breakfast together at whatever local diner we come to love. Being new to Billerica, we decided to head out this morning in search of a new local favorite. While cycling, I'd ridden past Riverview and thought it looked like a nice little place, so at my suggestion, we headed there.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, we seated ourselves at a window with a demi-view of the Concord River. The restaurant was maybe 1/4 full; no line at the door or anything.\\n\\nOur waitress - who looked like a 50-something - came over to our table and asked the usual, \\"can I start you off with drinks?\\" question.\\n\\n\\"Sure - hot chocolate, please,\\" asked the girlfriend.\\n\\n\\"Hi, coffee and a glass of water, please,\\" I added.\\n\\nAbout two minutes later, coffee and hot chocolate arrived at the table. So far, so good; the water would be coming soon for sure. We then placed our orders.\\n\\nI ordered three eggs - two egg whites, one regular egg - and bacon, which came with a side of pancakes. My girlfriend also ordered something basic; scrambled eggs, bacon and home fries.\\n\\nThe waitress waltzed off, and so began our wait.\\n\\n*The following timeline is as accurate as my memory allows.*\\n\\n~12 minutes, nothing. People who came in after us are being served. \\"Eh, it's gotten a little busy,\\" we thought, so no biggie. We both worked as servers in college, so we're more than understanding about long waits (I don't think I've ever once complained at a restaurant).\\n\\n~15-20 minutes, still nothing. \\"Eh, the waitress is probably new and just put the order in a little late,\\" we thought.\\n\\n~25-30 minutes, two pairs of customers who came in after us had both eaten and headed out the door. We started to think maybe our order was never submitted.\\n\\n~30 minutes, still nothing. The waitress has not so much as acknowledged our existence since we placed our order. A couple more groups of people who arrived about ten minutes after us get up and leave after enjoying their meals.\\n\\n~35 minutes in, I make eye contact with our waitress, who then walked back toward the kitchen area.\\n\\n~36 minutes in, she walks halfway between us and the kitchen and shouts, \\"yours should be out soon!!,\\" then shrugs and shouts, \\"I dunno!\\"\\n\\nEVEN STILL, my girlfriend and I look at each other and say, \\"Eh, stuff happens, whatever.\\" In fact, we were talking about how we shouldn't judge a restaurant by one server.\\n\\n~45 minutes in, our food arrives (which makes it pretty obvious that our order wasn't submitted until aforementioned 36-minute mark). My girlfriend is given wheat toast to go along with her French Toast (she asked for French Toast made with wheat bread), and I receive three fried egg whites (not what I ordered). The food is not served by our waitress, but by one who'd been serving people on the other side of the restaurant. THIS waitress was pleasant and asked, \\"Is there anything else I can do?\\" So, you know, she COMMUNICATED.\\n\\n~55 minutes in, our initial waitress is seen being told by someone (a manager?) that she should apologize. No apology is ever given, by anyone.\\n\\n~60 minutes in, our initial waitress comes back, doesn't say a word to us, and takes one of our empty plates away. We were never asked how the food was, or communicated to in any such way at all. The only time she spoke to us beyond taking our orders was when she shouted at us from three tables away at the previously mentioned 36 minute mark.\\n\\n~70 minutes in, she returns, and slaps a bill on our table. That's it; nothing about the food, no apologies, just an attitude (toward US, for some reason, who haven't complained about any of this at all).\\n\\nThe bill, which was something like $19.35, was paid for with a $20 bill. The waitress walked up to our table, took the $20 bill (keep in mind, we have change owed to us), and NEVER RETURNED.\\n\\n~75-80 minutes in, still no change. We decide that she must have tipped herself, so we have no reason to leave any additional tip. We stand up to leave.\\n\\nAs I look over to my side, about five waitresses/servers in the kitchen area are staring right at me. They all know what went on. Is there one apology issued by any of them for anything that occurred? Nope.\\n\\nWe leave the restaurant, walk out and vow to never return again.\\n\\nSo what did we learn? Apparently, at Riverview, the customers aren't a top priority - or  priority at all - even when they're beyond understanding about all of the screw ups that occurred by the waitstaff.\\n\\nBy far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had in terms of service, and I eat out pretty frequently.\\n\\nOh, and I still don't have my water."},{"name":"Red and Black Cafe","address":"400 SE 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I lived in Portland a few years ago, and I really miss this place, which was a few blocks from my house.

That's problematic when you're at a fancier place, but no one gives a shit in Roosters if she lets out a scream or throws a crayon on the floor.  For that, I am very grateful.  There's a fairly extensive kids menu and they have nice lidded plastic cups and straws (short ones, not full length!) for kids.  Plus our server was very good with her and made sure to put her order in early to get her fed.  Great for families.\\n\\nI've alway kind of dumped on the Roosters beer list.  This is a place to get giant Bud Lights, not to look for anything fancy.  But they've added Columbus IPA, a top-notch beer and a local one to boot.

Apparently, at the last minute the restaurant decided that they didn't want to offer the restaurant week menu that day, and neglected to tell anyone. I'm guessing they decided that because there was a convention in town that weekend and they probably wanted more money. Then, they simply blamed the \\"confusion\\" on third party websites even though my boyfriend and I had both checked the Miel website two weeks before. Either way, since we had made our reservations so far in advance, they let us have the restaurant week menu anyway. However we did notice that they didn't let anyone else have that menu, even when it was requested. So I guess we got \\"lucky.\\"\\n\\nThe service was somewhat friendly, but the overall attitude was rather morbid. It seemed like no one enjoyed working there, and the manager wasn't friendly at all. He made the atmosphere very uncomfortable for my boyfriend and I, but we both really wanted to give this place a chance so we didn't leave right away. We didn't even get olive oil for our bread until after we got our first course. There were however, about 3 couples who came in after us who did leave before they even placed an order. They were the real lucky ones.\\n\\nFor my meal I had the Pistou soup, Grilled Brandt Steak Frites ($5 extra), and the Miel Chocolate Pot de Creme. \\n\\nThe soup was okay. It was light and flavorful and lukewarm... It seemed a bit undercooked but it wasn't terrible.\\n\\nI had ordered my steak \\"medium-well\\" because I'm more susceptible to food-born illnesses. I don't like my steak extremely bloody just a bit pink in the middle. In cheaper restaurants I usually order it \\"medium\\" because I expect them to over cook it a little. However since it was $5 extra and supposed to be an upscale restaurant, I assumed they knew what they were doing. Instead of a steak I got this dried out, burnt to a crisp, chewy, flavorless piece of a dead cow. It was so tough to chew that the only way I could think to eat it was to pick it up and gnaw on it (but I didn't). I got roughly halfway through it and just couldn't take it anymore - it was the first time EVER that I didn't finish a steak. The french green beans were barely seasoned - just had a little bit of salt and the dish also came with fries. They were thin and crispy - almost identical to McDonald's fries, but differed in flavor slightly in that they added some thyme to them which gave them a \\"rotting vegetable\\" flavor. \\n\\nMy dessert was the best thing I ate there. The chocolate was very rich and creamy. Simply amazing. If the rest of my meal was like that, then this place would get 5 stars for the food and 2-3 stars for service, but one good dessert just can't make up for how horrible this $53 meal for two was.

Where do i start on this...... firstly no Yuca/fries which i have always gotten whenever i order a Jalea. secondly the seafood was rubber in a crappy coating. No fresh fish, or fresh seafood for that matter. it was clear to see that this came from a seafood mix bag that you can pick up for a few dollars at the oriental markets. I was slightly embarassed that i made her excited for the food. The appetizer was that potato seafood salad thing.

When I was finally able to tear myself away from all the adorable canines, I looked over the brunch menu and followed up with our waitress (who also happened to be Vegan) about Vegan options. They have several on the menu, but she recommended that I get \\"The Latin\\" a concoction that is not listed on the menu. She also dubbed it \\"The-Vegan-Thing-That's-Not-On-The-Menu.\\" You have to love Portland! So, I took a chance and got it. I was not at all disappointed. The hash browns were crispy and prepared to perfection! The tofu scramble was so flavorful, especially coupled with avocado, tomato, and a spicy aioli sauce. The toast was great and they even provided Earth Balance Vegan butter to put on it! I couldn't ask for anything more.

This is pretty poor form when you're paying a premium for the meal... They whisked away our plates so quickly after our meal and brought the check immediately after...it was like they wanted to vacate the table ASAP.

There were five selections represented, along with various accompaniments. It was nice to have a relatively guided tasting. I will not elaborate on the flavors, but suffice it to say the cheeses were high quality, flavorful and tasty. I would order it again. \\n     The pork shank arrived with quite a nice presentation, a little shaved raddish on top for color. I went to work with a fork and a knife, but the meat was so tender I was able to pull it off without needing the knife. It was literally fall of the bone. Tender, well seasoned, a scosh dry but nothing that interrupted my enjoyment. The turnip mashed potatoes combined everything I loved about mashed potatoes, but combined it with the sharp bite of the turnip. The kale was more in the form of a salted kale chip, it actually reminded me of bacon.\\n   At the end of our meal we were satisfied. Our waitress missed a few things. We never got our portobello bisque, but we weren't charged for it either, which ended up being a good thing.

Wine recommendations were only from the reserve list. I didn't even realize there were less expensive choices. Appetizers as main courses were highly discouraged- he said it wouldnt be enough and that he would order us two of the same to \\"make sure we had enough\\" and his overall tone was that we were annoying him.

Feeling impatient and hungry, we settled for The One, which had a slow crowd and 0 waiting time.\\n\\nIn hindsight, we probably should have waited for Hayakawa.\\n\\nTo begin with, the host gives us only 1 food, 2 drink menus.

I'm not the type to nitpick but I find simple things like these irritating. \\n\\nAnyway. We ordered the lobster bruschetta (pretty good), hamachi shooters (overhyped, nothing unusual), and the sashimi sushi platter (was fresh). It took 20+ mins to get 3 small toasts (the bruschetta), another 10+ to get the shooters, AND THEN another 20+ to get the freaking platter. We put in another order of the chanel republic roll prior to receiving the platter. We initially held off on ordering bc we wanted to see whether the platter would be a sufficient amount of food but considering the ridiculous wait time on the food,  we didn't want to gamble. Another mistake. After finishing the freaking platter, took another 20 mins to get A ROLL. The waiter,  seeing how irritated I looked, came to apologize for the wait - said it was unusual, that they were understaffed. The waiter was attentive and i understand my experience had nothing to do with the waiter. However, I couldn't agree with his explanation. The restaurant wasn't busy - in fact, it looked pretty far from it. And being understaffed is not an excuse. I saw PLENTY of tables. I thought, \\"what would happen if this place was actually full to capacity?\\" The business should be prepared for those circumstances. It's a shame bc the food was pretty decent - but the experience isn't just about the food.\\n\\nWe got there at 7. Left at 930. Ridiculous. A 30 min wait at Hayakawa would've paled in comparison.

It was almost closing time since they had removed all sushi and only the hot buffet was laid out. This time a young girl was there at the counter who was over friendly (which made me a bit uncomfortable) but the portion sizes served were good, both of side and chicken.

The one thing that kept me from giving Main Event Entertainment was that they were not done setting up the buffet until 30 minutes after the scheduled time. I don't know why they were behind schedule. The food is okay and pretty standard to how a gaming and arcade place would be like. I would consider Main Event's direct competitor to be Dave & Buster's especially since there is a Dave & Buster's in the next exit. They are very similar except Main Event is newer.\\n\\nOverall, I do see myself returning in the future to try out their bowling lanes and for a place to hangout with co-workers after work.

The fish korma was flavorful with a rich sauce.  I didn't like the mixed vegetable dish as much.  A lot of tomato and the spices didn't blend well, in my opinion.  The naan was a bit tough.

I called the waiter's attention to the amount of meat provided in comparison to the menu photo and he shrugged \\"That's how much meat is always in those.\\"  I asked if I could be given additional meat, but was told there would be an upcharge for it.

My first visit I had the two Meats which was brisket and ribs it was three rib bones very small the brisket was sliced nice and thick however was not very flavorful had to order size I like art had the green beans very salty and the collars which were pretty good flavor just too much meat in them almost equal portions of meat and greens. I went again just yesterday to give the brisket another shot this time I got the two meats brisket and pulled pork with a side of collards. The collards, once again too much meat not enough greens The pulled pork was actually pretty decent. The real disappointment was the brisket. I'm so regretting I did not take a picture of this. I had to go back in (didnt check til I  got in the car) and ask what was it. It was not sliced it was in crumbles like chopped beef they gave me another serving said just keep thst we will give you another serving. I said what happened to it being sliced with bark on it and they said we will just give you another serving. The second serving was not much better, it was very fatty and bland. Also beware of the gumbo they gave me a sample and I can tell you it is not reminiscent of any form of gumbo. It's kind of like a thick gravy  with chunks of sausage & turkey meat and it appears to be brown rice. So my assessment of City Barbeque, based off what I've had...pulled pork has been the best .

The line wasn't too long, I was about the 3rd person, but it took an extraordinary amount of time to have my order taken. The two people behind the counter were having a hard time managing the crowd. No problem! I have nothing to me inpatient about, I'm in line for pie! What could be wrong? I had my heart set on a slice of pie and a hot chocolate. I had plenty of time to think out my order given this line predicament. I watched as the barista made several hot chocolates in a willy-nilly fashion. He just tipped this bottle of Gardellis chocolate over and tapped it a few times without rhyme or reason. If there's one thing that gets under my skin it's lack of consistency of quality control. Now, this barista was not doing this in a way that suggested he had honed his craft so well that measurements were irrelevant. He was doing it In a way that was just plain apathetic. By the time it was my turn to order I changed to a Ginger Hot Toddy. \\n\\nIt was packed so we took a seat at the counter, right next to all the action in the kitchen. Although I was right next to where they called our orders I could not hear what said barista was saying. Drinks and desserts were just sitting on the counter, pilling up, because people couldn't hear him. I understand it's not awesome working on a Saturday night but come on. \\n\\nI had the banana cream pie and was able to sample the coconut cream. I was very happy with my pie. The filling was light and the banana wasn't overly sugary which I was pleased about. The crust was nice and not too crumbly. My ginger hot toddy was pretty good as well. Everything I had was tasty, enough to bring me back for sure. \\n\\nRandom Order is a great place to get together for a treat. I've been before during the day just to drink coffee and read.

Complimentary sour dough bread with olive oil dip for the whole table. We ordered the calamari appetizer, mixed green salad, and chicken carbonara which were all good. It's deep-fried calamari, comes a red marinara sauce with some spiciness to it. The salad is the usual run-of-the-mill. The chicken carbonara was okay, nothing special to remember by.\\n\\nThe 2nd time around, I went with a larger group, we ordered the seafood trio platter, crabmeat pizza (special promotion), lasagna, veal saltibocca,  prosciutto stuffed chicken, and chicken parmigiana. The seafood trio had shrimp scampi, mussels marinara and fried calamari. All great, but the marinara sauce has a little kick to it, as mentioned before. The crab pizza was good, but it had red pepper flakes all over it. Lasagna was so-so. It was a bit dried and too cheesy for our table to handle. It didn't sit so well with us. The veal saltibocca was good, but a bit sour. Prosciutto stuffed chicken was above average, I would order again. The chicken parmigiana was a-okay. \\n\\nSo far, the experience is just okay food, nothing top-notch. It looks like a family-owned restaurant when you step in, but it's definitely a national chain. I wouldn't say it's super authentic, but there's definitely Itanlian presence on the menu items.\\n\\nThe portions are huge, a small can feed 2-3 people, and it only goes up from there.

They play nicely off the ceiling tiles. \\nWe ordered a couple of beers to start, a Brooklyn lager and a Lagunitas Czech pils, mmm.\\nWe started with the shrimp and grits appetizer and I have to say I've never had more perfectly cooked shrimp in my life. They were tender and just barely pink. Now I have to admit I hate grits, but something told me to order this anyway and I was not disappointed. I loved the way they were prepared in this dish. Will I try them at Denny's now? Hell no. But the chefs here know what they're doing with grits.\\nWhile we waited for our entr√©es we snacked on the gruyere biscuits with smoked sea salt butter. Drooool. A bit dense, but good. They could work the dough a little less for a fluffier biscuit, but they're very good. (and for $4, go for it!)\\nHere's the kicker, a man who appeared to be a manager, stepped over to the table and informed us that the chef had over cooked my husband's steak and was not pleased with it, so he was not going to send it to the table. Ok, I thought. Nice of them to make sure it's done right, so they compensated our time with another small snack while they re-cooked it. \\nHe brought us these breaded and fried balls of risotto mixed with their house prosciutto, chopped oysters and sweet little green peas with a side of sun dried tomato aioli. Holy crap. That made up for the, what, 10 minutes we had to wait? Thank you!\\nThen for the actual meal itself, I chose the smoked duck breast with pepper relish and succotash. I can't tell you how bad my father ruined succotash for me with the garbage in a can he used to serve when I was a child, so I was reluctant to order this, but oh man am I glad I did.\\nThe duck was cooked perfectly, and I mean perfectly medium, juicy, crispy skin, smoky flavor, and the pepper relish complimented it in a way that was nearly sinful.\\nMy husband's rib eye, now cooked properly was fork tender, juicy, melt in your mouth, this is painful for me to write...\\nIt was served with a small terrine of lobster mac and cheese. Yeah you heard me.

Now I'd been pondering making my own marshmallows at home for a while now, and this made up my mind. I'm inspired.\\nHere's where it all goes awesome. Since they over-cooked the first steak and were just going to throw it away, they boxed it up and GAVE it to us to bring home. To make steak and eggs or whatever tomorrow morning.\\nHow cool is that?!? No wasted animals here! We brought that sucker right over to our friend who loves his steak cooked that way. I should have brought him a fresh pair of pants too.\\nWill I go back? Hell yes. Will I order the same thing again? You betcha, after I try everything else.

I'd say more 3.5 stars if I'm being honest. Maybe they still have some kinks to work out because they're new? \\n\\nIn general - my thoughts: I thought that our server was nice, tenured, knew his stuff. The rosemary shrimp were great as an appetizer, the chicken fettuccine alfredo was a 6/10. I will say everything is reasonably priced for an upscale restaurant (half off apps on Thursday nights, and $23 for the entree). Something positive is that the food came out quick, but almost too quick to the point where I wondered if they had it ready in the back before I ordered it (still was warm and tasted fresh though). \\n\\nThe biggest downfall of my experience (which is unfortunate since it's not even related to food or service), is that valet was a MESS. It took the guy forever to even acknowledge that we were standing there waiting, and once he did, he was trying to help his coworker navigate parking a Range Rover which was terrifying in itself to the point where he wasn't even talking to us because he was so focused on helping out (I honestly wouldn't have trusted these kids with my car and would have parked elsewhere had I seen what I saw upon pickup). He said they didn't take credit cards, but took cash app and Venmo. Fine. I asked them if I was good to go once my car was pulled up, received no response and he proceeded to talk to who I think was his manager. The whole thing was a cluster in all honesty and I've never experienced a bad valet situation at all, much less THAT bad.\\n\\nMaybe I'll give this Sage location another shot in the future, but for now I'll stick with the Perimeter location."},{"name":"Nook","address":"781 Denman Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Very enjoyable food and friendly service.

The mash potatoes didn't have any flavor. Not even taste of butter or salt. The Chili was ok but it didn't taste fresh.  If you want want a good aforable breakfast/brunch restaurant, please do yourself a favor and go to Hang Over Easy.  I can't believe all the good review this dinner have.

Let me tell you... I wasn't disappointed. The atmosphere is open with a romantic ambiance at dinner. We went on Sunday by pure happenstance it was half priced bottles of wine (which happens every Sunday & Tuesday after 7 PM and Tuesday). Naturally we ordered two of the 2015 Indus de Vall Llach, it was full bodied and with fabulous cherry notes. Our servers name was Erik, he was delightful and very attentive. We ordered the mussels, croquetas, jamon iberico, and patatas bravas as tapas. The mussels were fresh and cooked perfectly (the pancetta was nice and salty and paired fantastically with the mussels), the croquetas were pleasantly crisp and creamy in the middle, as it should be, and the patatas bravas (my boyfriends favorite) were golden and generously covered with a creamy allioli as well as the brava sauce, which is a spicy tomato sauce.  My personal favorite was the Jamon Imberico. LET ME TELL YOU... I am a huge fan of aged meats! This one was so delicate it nearly melted in your mouth, coating your pallet with wonderful nutty notes. Over all the tapas were 10/10. We finished our meal with the large order of the Paella Barceloneta. Again, no complaints, the shrimp were my favorite part of that dish, full of flavor. Keep in mind the large is perfect for two or even three to share after tapas. We finished the meal the the dark chocolate and marcona almond ice cream. I am no a huge fan of nuts in my ice cream but this particular scoop was perfectly sweet with a nice little crunch from the shaved almonds with a smooth finish. \\n\\nI was very impressed by the authenticity of the food as well as the service. Ultimately, Barlata will be a go to spot moving forward for my boyfriend and I."},{"name":"Dinesty Dumpling House","address":"1719 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The vegetarian noodles made with thick noodles is good i should say.

So the $15 all you can eat price is NOT inclusive of the soup options (you can have plain water for free, but who wants to cook their food in that?)\\n\\nThe broth is nowhere near as good as it is at *Kaze* or *Shabu-Zen*; also, the sauce is pre-mixed, which is a plus for some and a minus for others (I liked the taste, but it wasn't spectacular).\\n\\nThe service isn't that great, and you constantly have to flag down waiters because oftentimes the orders you receive are incorrect.\\n\\nSo all in all, a pretty good place to go if you want hot pot & a lot of it.

When my order came, it was nothing at all what I expected and when I tasted the actual stew I was in total shock at just how unbelievably salty it was.  I regretted my order immediately.  The stew came with 4 oysters and diced up red and green peppers.  If you ate the whole stew, then you would have easily consumed a few days worth of your recommended daily sodium intake: no joke, it was really that bad.  And if it was supposed to taste like that to begin with, then I'm sorry, but that's just ridiculous.\\n\\nThe only reasons why I gave this place two stars instead of just one was because the sweet potato fries that came with the chipotle mayo, on the other hand, tasted good, and the 1/2 dozen pan fried oysters that my Mom had ordered, was pretty good too and definitely a better choice.  I really had wanted to order the pan fried oysters in the first place and should have done so to begin with, but decided on the oyster pepper stew at the last minute instead - what a mistake.  So like they say, it's always good to go with your first choice. . .  \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is pretty small and when we got here, we grabbed the last remaining table, as the only other available seats were at the counter.

One thing that should have tipped us off was the multitude of signs telling us that RESTROOMS ARE FOR CUSTOMERS ONLY. I do understand that - the restaurant is right by the max station near 84, and I can imagine there are many people looking for a place to pee and make mischief. Unfortunately, this makes it very difficult for a customer to use the bathroom as well, because after we paid we couldn't find anyone to actually let us in the bathroom!\\n\\nI am 100% sure I will not return to Eastern Cathay for any reason.

Granted, four of those years I was a poor college student and three of which having no transportation.  Anyways, I scoped around and found Barlata.  I was super stoked about a ton of items on their menu!  Their prices are relatively inexpensive as well.\\n\\nLet's start with the parking.  Barlata has a parking garage, but it can still be pretty packed during the rush hour.  During dinner time on a Saturday night, I drove in and had to turn back out.  Tip: if you can't find a parking space, drive into the parking garage and turn left instead of right.  There's a couple parking spaces in that tucked in corner that I completely missed the first time.\\n\\nTonight was apparently an unusually packed night.  There were multiple birthday and bachelorette parties and the place was super loud.  Not an intimate place, but definitely fun and exciting.  We had reservations, but still had to wait a good 10-15 minutes to get a seat along the wall.  A Bee's Knee's was ordered and it was tasty and refreshing.  A nice change of pace after the parking madness.\\n\\nThe two of us shared six dishes between us.  The first one up was a baby squid stuffed with sausage in squid ink, and it was a doozy.  I admit, I wasn't accustomed to having an entire squid on my place before me, so it was partially mental to get through this dish.  Overall, it wasn't bad, but not anything I would get excited about.  The Tiradito of Escolar and Escalivada was next and it wasn't that much better.  I was stoked about the escolar from my sushi experiences, but the texture and flavors weren't what I was expecting and left much to be desired.\\n\\nI must agree with those who said that the Braised Oxtail on mashed potatoes tastes essentially like pot roast.  I enjoyed the flavors and the fat content, but I personally feel that the oxtail would be best experienced with the bone on.  The intensity of the flavors and the presentation would greatly benefit that way.  Not wanting to be outdone, the Paella Barlata was a hit!  Flavors were on point and the shrimp were large and perfectly cooked.  The small was a good size to share, but I'm sure we would've gladly taken down the large version as well.  The pan was licked clean.  The pork belly was also good, although it was a bit strange being served in thin broth and was no where near the best I've had.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the Mel I Mato.  Overall we both liked it a lot as it was sweet, but not over the top.  The combination of the mousse, torte, and the ice cream was excellent with a great presentation on the plate.\\n\\nNow, the service.  Our servers were overall really nice and friendly.  I understand that the place was super busy, but there were times where we, a mere table of two, felt ignored and almost pushed out the door.  Not that it was anything severe enough that could count as offensive, but with a lot of the dishes we ordered tasting mediocre, the service didn't help improve the experience.\\n\\nWould I come back?  With so many great Tapas choices in Austin, it's hard to dwell on a place that didn't absolutely meet my expectations."},{"name":"Rimsky-Korsakoffee House","address":"707 SE 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Kooky coffee-tea-dessert house with beautiful live music and quirky staff.

I went to school out there and was  definitely spoiled by the great Italian foods of that neighborhood. I know exactly what it is supposed to taste like. \\n\\nNow on to my review. I ordered the curbside to go. I showed up and sat in the parking spot, waiting for my Pizza to come to me and it never did. I call and say hi is my pizza ready? They proceed to say yes.. Why didn't you call when you got here. I stated that the website says for you to describe your vehicle, indicate your license plate number, and be ready at your specified time. So then he asked me for my confirmation number and said I need to pay. I stated, I paid online I am not paying you again.. Oh your order came as a phone order. \\nHmmm really now? So you have 3 other staff members there not one of them can recall speaking to me, yet I made a phone order. \\n\\nSo then he gets upset and says fine! We will bring it out. Mind you this is a half an hour after  my pizza was scheduled to be ready. They bring the pizza out to me and it's cold. At this point I say to myself, hmm I paid $20.00 for a pizza and its cold.. Um no I need another one. The crazy thing is that I was polite and said Can you please make me another one because this is cold. He said oh the website is broken and the order didn't come in correctly so that is why it's cold. I sat there and said um this doesn't make any sense. I said to him. I could have driven to the North End for the authentic stuff.  Which I must say tastes much better than what I received. \\n\\nThis was the most frustrating experience. I live in the south shore. However the amount of time it took to get a hot pizza here, I could have driven to the North End.\\n\\nI read the review below with the negative curbside review, I should have listened. I must say..

Interactive food (good for groups, good for alleviating awkwardness and keeping people distracted), and done exactly the way I want!!!! If I had written a review for this place the first time I'd gone, it would absolutely be 5 stars. Now I'm bumping it down in my head to 4-stars, but only because my friends and I have had a few problems with how they handle the checks recently.\\n\\nThe variety of things you can order, vegetarian or no, is also sort of ridiculous. One of the cute little quirks about this place is that when you get new ordering sheets, each version I've ever had is slightly different and sometimes has new things on it you hadn't seen before. There's a huge selection of think-sliced meats, seafood (inc crab and mussels and clams and scallops....), tofu (and similarly, fish balls, fish paste, etc), mini dumplings, napa cabbage, bok choy, chinese broccoli, watercress, other vegetables i haven't heard of, like 5 types of mushrooms, different types of starches (various noodles, rice cakes, etc), etc etc. The broths are generally chicken-based (although that flavor isn't obvious), but can be made vegetarian upon request. The ingredients are all pretty good quality, too. They also have beverages, alcoholic and non.\\n\\nThe customer service during dinner is always pretty decent too, at least the 6 or 7 or so times I've been. They promptly hand you a sheet, bring you sauce, bring you water, and quickly bring you your platters of food. One way to strategize, if you're impatient, is go in a giant group. That way, you can just basically get multiple divided pots and check off everything on the ordering sheet without having to make major decisions. They are also good about coming by to refill drinks and put more broth in the pots when they evaporate off, and to bring you more sheets. Sometimes it gets a tad busy, but it's not hard to wave someone down or just make eye contact or hand new ordering sheets off to whoever passes by.\\n\\nAnyway, the one detraction is that they are a little inconsistent with how they handle checks. It's $15 for lunch, and $20 for dinner. $2 for each type of broth, which is standard at other types of shabu-esque places I've been. The first time I went, they were super nice and split our bill with 5 credit cards. A little while later they stopped doing that, but eh I get it. Once a waitress gave us some attitude because she claims we were under-tipping - that is inexcusable i think, even in chinatown (i think recently they started adding in pretty decent tip automatically for large parties, which is fine, but  i think they forgot to put it on our check and just charged my CC),  Mostly I've been slightly peeved lately because I went on New Year's Day for lunch and was charged the dinner price because \\"it was a holiday.\\" Then today a friend texted and said she was suddenly told that they were being surcharged because their party had stayed longer than 2 hours (the first time we'd ever heard of that, no mention of it the previous day. Oh well, I guess being able to stay 3.5 hours at a hot pot buffet riding the waves of my appetite was pretty cool while it lasted.)\\n\\nAnyway, everything in that last paragraph can be forgiven and has always been worked out much more easily than it would have at some other places in Chinatown (see my post about Hei La Moon). This place is badass. Only things to watch out for are 1) avoiding overeating and ending up in a bad place later, and 2) avoid eating the garlic cloves, roots, and other herbs that are floating around initially (could be a little unpleasantly intense, but these mix-ups happen, and then you drown the fail moment in more delicious food)."},{"name":"Alamo Roast Beef & Seafood","address":"21 Salem St","city":"Medford","stars":"4","text":"Their roast beef really is yummy, a lot of places claim to have great roast beef, but they really do.

I had purchased a Groupon which we had been waiting to use.  Called ahead at 5:00 pm  to make a reservation and was told that they are not seating until after 9:00 pm.  So, what does that mean? Do they have reservations for the next 4 hours?  Couldn't get a straight answer from the hostess and was put on hold for 10 minutes while she \\"checked\\".\\n\\nWe were in the area so decided to go by and see for ourselves.  Got the same response when we arrived even though only 2 tables were occupied in the dining room.  I asked if we could sit at the bar and the hostess said okay, but then turned around and ignored us, not offering us menus or anything.   As we proceeded to sit down, another woman approached us (I assume she was the manager) and told us we could not sit there because our son was with us.  I once again asked if they could accommodate us at a table.  She said all tables were reserved and that they only take reservations on Friday and Saturday nights.\\n\\nRather than ask us if we could return later, or if we would like to make a reservation for the following evening, she began to rant about her kitchen staff being overworked and how busy they were, even though the place was virtually empty.  She was extremely rude and told us that she would not seat us as she basically pushed us out the door.  Needless to say, we took our appetite elsewhere, and will never return to Porcini's.\\n\\nAs an added note, there is no disclosure on the Groupon or on Porcini's website about required reservations.    Based on other reviews, it looks like even if we had made a reservation, it would not have made much of a difference since they apparently have a habit of overbooking tables and keeping their customers waiting,  along with a history of rude and defensive management staff.

A real stand-up guy ya know? So while my fiance was in the restroom I talked to the guy and just said \\"hey buddy, she said sorry you don't have to get upset here.\\" which I totally know I didn't have to say anything but I'm a dude and you shouldn't swear at a dudes girl, am i right? So anywaysers, Im pretty sure what he heard was \\"hey asshole, don't fuckin ever swear at my girl again you piece of garbage bus boy.\\" But I would never say that to anybody and ive been a bus boy dishwasher so i get that that's a shitty job. So this is what happens. After we sat back down I see the bus boy whispering to our waitress and pointing at me giving her the old cutoff signal. And after a few minutes (because i think the waitress didn't think it was necessary) the bus boy comes over to tell me I have been cut off. Now I know what you're thinking here.. don't stiff the waitress! don't stiff the waitress! its not her fault! well guess what? We stiffed her. We had to. We talked to the manager and he didn't care so it was our only recourse. They gave us no choice. Unless this yelp post works and everybody stops going to Dillon's and they shut the place down.

Although I did order other things these two is enough for a lite lunch or early afternoon delight with a drink.\\n\\nFor the meal we ordered the Croque Monsieur aka Ham and Swiss on a baguette (reminded me of a Panini of sorts) and the Burger Trilogy.  After burning the roof of my mouth the baguette was not the best choice since the crust of the bread was hard to bite into.  The Burger Trilogy was better since it gave me a variety to pick from.  My favorite was the lobster.  Loads of big chucks of lobster and wished I could have had more.  The mini burger was good but the Tuna wasn't since I am not a tuna fan.\\n\\nI'll need to go back for dessert since I was so full I couldn't bear to entertain dessert and nothing really jumped out at me.  Not sure how I really feel about olive oil ice cream and I am a huge ice cream lover so I am still pondering that.\\n\\nThere is a private dining room which is the Olive Room for groups of about 14.  There is no charge to use the room but there is a food and drink minimum.  There are individual small bottles of olive oil that make up the chandelier, the table and room have a history and story from olives and there is a looked area which holds the premium olive oils.  It is a beautiful room and worth booking for the right occasion.\\n\\nThey can also open and or close a portion of the dining hall and create a private seating area for larger parties.  With the night views it would be beautiful."},{"name":"The Busy Bee Cafe","address":"810 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Mainly a lunch place, I went here for a Valentine's Day dinner before going to the circus at nearby Phillips Arena. \\n\\nIt was greasy, authentic and it's hard to resist something called \\"Busy Bee's Fried Chicken.\\" Probably the cheapest Valentine's Day dinner we've ever gotten away with. \\n\\nThey have a parking lot, so that's not a problem.

I went on a Friday evening for a birthday, and I have to say, I was less than impressed. For a restaurant that was voted #1 in Orlando Sentinel, I have to ask the question, who did the voting?\\n\\nFor starters, the restaurant was dead for being supposedly the \\"most popular\\" Greek venue in the area. There was 80's music playing, which urked me to no end. I was hoping for some authentic Greek music to go along with a hopefully charming dining experience, but it was completely void of atmosphere. The only music that exists is on their website, along with a 10 year old Zagat award. It was loud, and you could hear  every person's conversation, even though there were only a few tables.\\n \\nTh service was very slow. It took 40 minutes to get appetizers, and all entrees came out separately.  Two of our guests were really annoyed that they had to wait for their food while everyone began eating. Many of us were also drinking coffee, myself included, and I literally waited 30 minutes for a refill. I'm the type of patron who appreciates when you don't have to ask for something that should be done automatically.\\n\\nThe food, well, what can I say. Canned green beans? Really? They tasted like someone poured Fabuloso on them. The Pastitsio was bland in my opinion, however some of the other guests enjoyed it. The Mousaka was also a hit for one guest, but the other said they felt like they were digging at an archaeological site, searching for the lost eggplant.\\n\\nAll in all, not a great experience.

Jumbo grilled scallops are served on a bed of angel hair pasta tossed in a creamy pesto sauce with pine nuts, pounded basil, butter and garlic.  The scallops were cartoonishly large, but tasty and tender, cooked just the right length of time.  Obviously deft hands in the kitchen have been making these dishes for years and gotten them down to a T. \\n\\nA classic appetizer, melon with prosciutto de Parma, is a light choice that serves as the perfect foil to the heavier pasta dish.  The prosciutto tasted average, but the melon, cut away from the rind but still nestled on it, was the perfect ripeness and bursting with flavor.  A glass of the house montepulciano complemented the meal.\\n\\nService is impressively attentive -- water glasses are replenished constantly and bread baskets replaced regularly.  But, lingering is not encouraged, unless you're paying for a bottle of wine or adding additional charges like dessert and coffee to the bill.  If you pay with cash, be sure to take your change off the check tray as soon as it's laid on the table.

Do not come here for dinner. They don't take reservations (you need to be there in person but they will call your cell when a table opens up). Bar seats are first come though. The bar staff is knowledgeable and super friendly. Last call is 11:45, although they stay open later than that.\\n\\nThe long version: The bf and I rolled in around 7pm on a Friday. Place was pretty busy and the table wait was 45min-hour. We decided to wait at the bar, and promptly scored two seats right near the opened front doors. Bar was a bit hot (temp wise), so the gentle breeze from outside was needed. The tattooed female bartender is super knowledgeable on both the drink and food menus. If you have no idea what craft beer you like, just tell her what you normally drink and she will find an even better version of it! And she lets you sample it before getting a full glass!

Some acidity and a crunchy/contrasting texture was desperately needed.\\n\\nMenu: grilled hanger steak* (g) $19\\n8 oz marinated steak, goat cheese-scallion mashed, wilted spinach with balsamic onion\\n\\nReality: we ordered it medium. Came out raaaare and unevenly cooked (one side was cooked longer than the other.) We don't mind rare, but I'm sure other ppl would be very upset if they don't get the proper temperature. Spinach was a bit oily and I couldn't taste any balsamic. The mash was a hot gummy mess. It was oddly kinda sweet with pretty big pcs of scallion that overtook the flavor. I wouldn't know it had goat cheese in it if I hadn't seen the description.\\n\\nThroughout our dinner, the bar got more and more crowded and ridiculously loud.

Being a vegetarian, Doc's Green looked like a safe bet. We arrived on Monday, July 05, 2010 at 12:32 pm:\\n\\n     As we walked into this restaurant, tables and booths were set up somewhat neatly in the dining area. It looked like a nice little salad bar and the smell of cooking vegetables showed promise. So i went to the counter with my family and we ordered:\\n\\n     I ordered the \\"Dr.Grilled Veggie\\" salad without the balsamic dressing. The menu stated that for $8.99 you got field greens,grilled zucchini and yellow squash, grilled portabello mushrooms, roasted red peppers, avocado, and onions all in one salad. It sounded very appetizing and so i was kind of excited to see so many vegetables i loved in one dish. When i got it, it was not what i expected. \\n     \\n     The vegetables were cold and showed char marks meaning they had grilled them quite a while ago, but that was fine. They want to prep before hand to make it easier? Go for it. So i looked at the salad and discovered they had forgotten the avocado. I went back to ask and they said \\"oh no. Its not real avocado. We use a paste.\\" So looked through it and found nothing. Not even the \\"Paste\\". So i went back again, and they said it was clear and mixed in the salad, so you could not see it. So i ignored it and went on to eat the rest of my food (which was not big enough for nine dollars). When i went to eat the mushroom (it only had one instead of the plural on their menu), it was greasy. It had black liquid dripping from it and it did not even taste like mushroom.\\n     \\n     So i went to get some water and hoped that was safe. Well truth be told, the lemonade pump and water pump were connected, so even after holding the water pump for a second to maybe circulate it out before using my glass, it tasted lemony.\\n\\n     I do not mean to complain as i am a very picky eater due to my vegetarianism and strange taste buds, but my family was not happy either. I do not recall the name of what they ate, but they politely asked me to review the macaroni as it tasted like it came from a box, and the grilled chicken as extremely dry and crunchy (the chicken meat was crunchy, not the skin).\\n\\n     So i am sorry to say that i was very disappointed in the restaurant. Maybe it was just a bad experience or maybe it was just not my preference. Either way, i would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good quality food for a good price.\\n\\n-Andrew D.

They've got tons of different cereals to the left of the counter that makes you wish you lived on the block so that you could mozy on down in your bathrobe and fuzzy slippers just to get yourself a cozily, cold breakfast while you surf the news using their free wi-fi. They've also got a mishmash of gourmet foodstuffs, including local milk, butter, and eggs. Not an alarmingly large array, but enough to satisfy any foodie on the go. They also artfully display your sandwich with a salad whether you are eating in or out. If you're eating in, there is a good amount of seating, though the arrangement of chairs, tables, and shelving units could be more efficiently executed. The other downside is that the wait for one's sandwich can be quite long. I'm not sure if it is because they are still working out the kinks in the system or because that is just how long one must wait for a fairly inexpensive, though gourmet, sandwich, but I've had to wait more than 15 minutes for my sandwich both times when it appeared as though there were maybe two other patrons/orders before mine.

The Karaoke host, Joe Pet, was really nice, plus he has over 200,000 songs in his database!  \\n\\nIf you are looking for a \\"hot\\" or \\"jammin'\\" night club where you can pick up some skanky sorority tail, this place probably isnt for you.\\n\\nI admit that I didnt even try the food.  I just went for the karaoke but I did get a scorpion bowl that was a little small for the price and really, really sweet, but arent they supposed to be?  They had a big menu of funny drinks served in tiki heads called things like \\"Dr. Funk\\" and \\"Suffering Bastard\\".  Classic Polynesian tiki bar. \\n\\nIf you like unusual dining experiences, interesting people, and the best karaoke in town you should probably check out the Cathay Pacific.

I loved how uniquely set up the restaurant was, it made the experience more enjoyable. They say a small portion serves 3-4 people however, I disagree. I ordered the Cheese Manicotti and an order of mozzarella garlic bread and my boyfriend ordered the Veal Parmigiana. I was able to finish all but two manicotti noodles which would make the portion big enough for 1-2 people (i guess depending how much you can personally eat). The bread was mediocre at best and didn't come with marinara or any sort of dipping sauce. The Veal came with three pieces and NO SPAGHETTI! I would think for the price they would include spaghetti with the veal but nope! We did end up ordering a piece of tiramisu which was delicious...2-3 people could likely enjoy one slice. In my opinion the food didn't look too appealing but it all tasted great! However, I think it is priced way too high for the portion sizes as well as quality. I can go to Olive Garden and order chicken parmigiana which come with two pieces AND spaghetti, AND unlimited salad and breadsticks and pay half the price than if i were to come back here. Also, our waiter SUCKED! He came to the table maybe a total of three times, had zero personality, and was just standing around talking in the drink station. I feel as if the appearance of most the servers I saw was very unprofessional looking. There were servers VISIBLY standing around talking, complaining about other tables, and drinking fountain drinks by touching their straw and then not washing their hands. Management seemed lazy and the two managers i saw pass by did not smile or ask how anything was.

The tomato egg soup is exactly as they say it is - brothy, tomato egg which so many people grew up eating and will provide an instant punch of nostalgia. The green beans are also very good - flash fried with some bits of pork that have great flavor. The toothpick lamb is phenomenal - cumin rubbed, non-gamey lamb that is just fatty enough. It's the best dish of all that we had, so I would definitely recommend that on a return trip.

For the entrees, we had the Braised Short Rib Hash, Southern Crab Cake Benny, and Buttermilk Biscuit plate. \\n\\nBraised Short Rib Hash - Came on in a deep dish pan with 2 poached eggs on top and a blend of short rib, kennel potatoes, black eyed peas and gouda cheese. The ingredients blended nicely but I was a little disappointing there wasn't more short rib, since that is supposedly the main feature of the dish. Nonetheless, it filled me and I'd recommend this one. \\nSouthern Crab Cake Benny- a unique dish for sure. The muffin was nicely toasted so that it retained some structure and wasn't soggy by the time we put it into our mouths. The Crab cake had a nice texture to it, and stood out well next to the poached egg and hollandaise sauce. \\nButtermilk Biscuits came with Eggs (scrambled), sausage or bacon and Kennel cut potatoes. We asked for more gravy as the biscuits alone weren't moist enough. Nothing too special about this dish. \\n\\nPricing wise, it's pretty decent for a West end restaurant.

And tarts and pie and tarts.  I have giant books devoted to the art of pursuing that elusive, perfect, flaking crust that crumbles and gives just right under the weight of your fork.  I enjoy the science behind gluten, fats, and what will best serve my Perfect Pie.\\n\\nMy friend and I heard that this place was home to one of the best pies in Portland.  In fact, it had been featured in some kind of blabla magazine about best pies in the US even.  Amazing!  Here, in Portland?  Well!  I have got to try it!  \\n\\nWell, we get there, and I'm already kind of a bit turned off by the atmosphere.  First, we're just here to grab our pies and go -- we had lunch waiting for us at home and we just wanted the pie to tag along with us to cap off what we hoped to be a carb-o-riffic lunch.  But there was barely room for us to stand and my friend commented that it felt like we were interrupting everyone's conversations.  It did feel a little awkward because it seemed like we were just smooshed in the middle of a gathering of friends who all knew each other until we finally managed to get our pie slices.  The pie slices themselves were a bit pricey, but The Best Pie can have no pricetag, so I wasn't too put off yet.  \\n\\nWe took the pies home for lunch, and I have to say, I was very disappointed.  Not just because they weren't $4.25 pieces of pie, but they just weren't very good pieces of pie period.  We got the much heralded salted vanilla caramel apple pie (I probably just listed the 83 flavors in this pie backwards and sideways) and the brandied peach pie.  We shared these, and while the filling was decent, it was overwhelmed by the crust.  The crust was just awful.  It was clunky, tough, chewy and tasted burnt.  In part, I could place some of the blame from the pie sitting out, but a chewy pie crust is often just a poorly made crust: one where the fat wasn't properly chilled.  The back portion of the pie (the pure crust) was very thick, and almost too thick, given the tough consistency. \\n\\nI'd be interested in trying this place again, given that it has such interesting flavors and such a great reputation.

Live music, $12 bottomless mimosas, valet parking. Sounds like it's gonna be a good time right? No. Let's start with parking. When I neared the Sage lot, it looked like a traffic jam. My friend already texted to say she was trapped in that madness. Luckily, we work in the SunTrust building so I just parked there and walked over. We had a reservation for 1:30. We were there in time (despite that monstrosity that was valet parking), but had to wait probably a good 20 minutes before a table became available. When We finally were seated, we were practically in the kitchen lol. We sat for probably 15 more minutes before a waitress came over to take our order. At this point, it's after two. So it's almost pointless to do the bottomless mimosas that end at 3, but we try anyway. She leaves and tells us she's going to put our drunk order in and will be back for our food order. At least 45 minutes go by and she never comes back: not with water, not with our drinks, not to take our food order, NOTHING. We saw her taking other people's orders in our area. We saw people that sat down after us, got drinks, got food, and almost finished. We're still sitting there with absolutely nothing on the table. We were able to flag down a manager who seemed flustered. We told her what was going on and she said she was going to get our waters. We lost her for a while. Then another waitress (who wasn't our original one), brought us water. The manager comes from the back with water and looks pissed that we already had water. Still don't have the drinks we ordered. Still no food orders taken. At this point, brunch is almost over. FINALLY our waitress returns with our drinks. My friend was so pissed at this point, she sent them back because there was absolutely no point in doing bottomless mimosas for 15 minutes.... The manager comes back and we tell her no one has still taken our food order, not to mention the waitress came out with one drink when we ordered bottomless and other tables had a pitcher for their bottomless beverage. She tried to tell us that's not how they do bottomless but it didn't make sense considering we see other tables with pitchers of mimosas or bellinis.... After some back and forth, my friend and I agree to stay and put in a food order. The manager takes our order and goes to put them in. She comes back to the table to tell us that they were our of champagne...and walked off. No alternative was offered. No apology. Nothing... (meanwhile we see other tables still being brought mimosas and bellinis) So we ask to speak to another manager over the initial manager we'd been speaking to. Cause although she took our order and whatnot, the exchange with her was not empathetic or apologetic. She seemed bothered. Which I'm sure she was because we weren't the only ones complaining. But at the same time that's not our problem. \\n\\nA male manager came to the table and we explained to him our whole ordeal since we've been there, including being told they were out of champagne but other tables were still being brought their drinks. He stated they were using Rose' since they ran out of champagne. We told him the other manager didn't say that, nor offer another option. He apologized for the inconvenience. And at this point we really did have enough (not to mention we were hungry), and were about to leave. \\n\\nThe male manager came back to the table with a $100 gift card for my friend (meanwhile, I'm at the table too....but ok) to apologize for the experience. \\n\\nShe took it and we left. When We were leaving, the valet had lost someone's keys (hopefully she's not still up there). We ended up going down the street elsewhere. We saw a waitress coming in with bottles of champagne.

There are two cash registers but not everyone knows there is a second or that they can move to it if the first is busy.  But, wait!  What if someone is waiting for the first and someone behind them goes over to the second register. Is that legal?  Or, someone at the second register who followed their friend over notices that the first register is available.  Can they back up just as someone else arrives at the first register?  You get my drift.  To make matters worse, the employees move around so you don't really know who is at which register or if you are supposed to move up to an empty one. I've seen employees go from one register to the other.  No one ever says \\"next\\" or \\"may I help the next person\\".  Awkward. (Minus a star)\\n\\nSecond, the food is not all that great. The pastries are made elsewhere according to an employee who probably should not have told me.  (So how can they call themselves a \\"bakery\\"?)  The coffee is flat and just not rich tasting. The breakfast taco is small and not as hefty as the one around the corner at El Arroyo but it costs 65 cents more here. And the gelato tastes old.

I also think of the warmth and comfort and feelings of family that are so evocative in Italian food and culture. I am not Italian nor was I raised in an Italian household. Growing up, my exposure to Italian cuisine was a thin meat sauce made from a packet of McCormick's spaghetti sauce mix served over spaghetti. My father despised the dish and now I know why. I fell in love with real Italian food when I was a young Navy pilot deployed to Italy in the mid-1980's. When we weren't tracking Soviet submarines in the Mediterranean we were tearing around the Italian countryside in a beat-up Fiat 124 looking for our next fix of pasta and vino. While the food was great, the welcoming environs and that feeling of family were even greater.\\n\\nNowadays, when I want to feel like I'm part of an Italian family and get my fix of Sunday gravy, I travel to Alfredo's. You feel right at home when you walk in this place... the dark wood, the white tablecloths, the dim lighting, the doting host, the brigade of red vest clad waiters... There's always a crowd and on most weekend nights there's a line out the door but they do take reservations and easily accommodated our party of nine who recently visited to celebrate a birthday.\\n\\nOur waiter immediately descended upon our table serving surprisingly good garlic bread and an assortment of pickled vegetables. You want to know the specials? You want some wine? You want some appetizers? The man in the red vest is at your disposal and will not leave until someone gives him guidance as to how he can begin making you happy.\\n\\nWe ordered a couple of carafe's of the house Chianti and several appetizers for the table. They have a decent-sized Italian wine list and also offer several Italian beers and a full bar as well. \\n\\nThe appetizers arrived quickly. The mussels in white wine were perfectly done with lots of fresh garlic and Italian parsley. The fried calamari was light and crispy with a spicy Fra Diavolo sauce.  The fried mozzarella was a hit; it's a large gooey wedge served with a good Sunday gravy. \\n\\nWe placed our entr√©e orders, first the ladies, then the men. The servers here are pros.  When our entrees arrived there were no questions about who had what or  \\"roll call\\" serving as I've taken to calling it. Each dish was expertly placed in front of the person who had ordered it. \\n\\nThe portion sizes at Alfredo's are large. You will not leave hungry.\\n\\nThe breast of chicken Cacciatore was pure comfort food.  It was what my Italian grandmother would make if I had an Italian grandmother. The chicken was surprisingly juicy to be just breast meat and the Sunday gravy was rich with plum tomatoes, mushrooms, red peppers, onions and herbs\\n\\nThe half portion of eggplant Parmigiana hung off the plate. The delicately fried vegetable was not swimming in sauce and cheese but rather had the right balance of ingredients as to highlight the delicate yet hearty dish.\\n\\nThe breast of chicken al pesto was excellent, saut√©ed in pounded basil, pine nuts and butter and served in a creamy garlic sauce.\\n\\nThe Snapper Casalinga was a large portion of fresh fish. It was broiled and served with a tart lemon butter and white wine sauce that slightly overpowered the fish. The accompanying saut√©ed spinach was garlicky with a hint of smokiness.\\n\\nThe veal dishes were very good. The Padrino, or Godfather, is a trio of three veal preparations, Francese, Marsala and Parmigian.  All were faithful representations of these classic dishes. The veal Saltimbocca was supposed to be prepared with white wine but tasted of Marsala wine instead, which made the dish a bit cloying.\\n\\nAn assortment of Italian desserts was served in honor of the \\"birthday boy\\" and the waiters and several adjoining tables serenaded with \\"Happy Birthday\\". The desserts were all authentic with the cannoli being the star.\\n\\nAlfredo's serves good Italian food but Alfredo's excels at providing exceptional service, a welcoming atmosphere and those feelings of warmth and comfort that are at the heart of what Italian really means."},{"name":"Miller's Ale House - Orlando","address":"8963 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I really wanted to like this place based on all the reviews.

The corn muffins were a good consistency, and I ate both of them like a jerk while my lunchmates whined about it too bad their loss for being slow and tentative.

While it doesn't need much explanation, you sit down, choose your meal and you are brought a bowl which you fill with raw ingredients. Then, you walk up to a number on the grill counter, have your food cooked on a community grill, and proceed to sit and eat.\\n\\nGreat in theory - horrible in reality.\\n\\n1) Serving size varies heavily on how willing you are to push the limits of ridiculousness. A $15 bowl could mean a modest portion of noodles and egg or a heaping bowl of protein that is overloaded and spilling over the edges. There is no regulation to how high you can pile your bowl, and the guests next to me somehow stockpiled theirs about 3-4 times higher than the lip of the bowl. It could have won a contest.\\n\\n2) Raw ingredients are not appetizing. Scooping raw chicken next to veggies and seeing ingredients mixed from sloppy customers is annoying. The process should at LEAST be handled by an employee, which would solve both the portioning and mixing issue. Have a dietary restriction on shellfish or a serious gluten allergy? Stay away!\\n\\n3) The grill was disgusting. While the showmanship of hibachi-sytle grilling is part of the \\"novelty\\" of eating here, it was one of the worst parts of the experience. Seeing how disgusting the grill, floor and surrounding area is was not appetizing. Add to this that the wait was fairly long (10-15 minutes of standing without a chair) ...and it is not pleasant.  Furthermore no attention is paid to food mixing, and I had pieces of stir fry that I never ordered in my dish by the end.\\n\\n4) Clientele. I came around 4PM on a Monday and the other guests were seedy to say the least.

Sure, this is possible anywhere, but I wonder if the easily-abused setup for unrestricted food portioning attracts a certain demographic.\\n\\nI know how fun this experience sounds in theory, but I would warn anyone with food allergies, issues standing or just cleanliness standards to steer clear of this Mongolian misadventure."},{"name":"Moe's Southwest Grill","address":"12701 Narcossee Road","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"My chips were stale and I ordered pick up for a stack and paid extra for meat for my husband.

They dropped their salads with bacon, that's ok, and the tomatoes that use to be tasty were ripped up little pieces that I believe were tomatoes.  When my wife mentioned to the manager that the as advertised chopped salads were not at all chopped, he said I can assure you we have not changed our salads, not the best response. The ham was like lunch meat, not like before. And to add to the disappointment, we ask for additional tomatoes and cheese, had to ask twice, and when the tomatoes finally came, that I said I would pay extra for, there were 3 one inch tasteless soggy pieces. Any we never got the extra cheese.  Poor service, wrong response from the manager, and a chopped salad that was not at all chopped are not the end of the world, but 5 people in a restaurant, including us, at 6:45 on a Sunday night says it all.

I've tried a number of Thai food spots in Vancouver and haven't been that excited about any of them, so I was eager to cross another off the list. \\n\\nThe restaurant has very limited seating for how busy it was, so we opted for take out, which was likely a mistake. We ordered the Spring Rolls, Stir Fry Veg, and Pad Thai and were told 20 minutes. We showed up a half hour later and were made to wait almost another 30 minutes, which I found to be very annoying. Call me ornery but botched time estimations are a huge pet peeve of mine.\\n\\nI will say that once we got it home, the food itself was enjoyable. The portions were certainly smaller than most of the ethnic food spots I've ordered from, but we liked what we were given. The spring rolls and stir fry veg both were crispy and well flavoured. The pad thai was heavier on the fish sauce than I'm used to, but it was good none the less. Definitely not one of those dense bricks of ketchup-flavoured noodles that gets passed off as pad thai in Vancouver.

I have only really enjoyed burgers made from chicken or beef. Never had I thought one made from venison, lamb, or ahi tuna existed, and was so readily available. To match the uniqueness of each patty, is an equally unique list of ingredients. Ingredients that cater to each of their gourmet burgers. Guinness cheddar, truffle aioli, and watercress. Each burger is well thought out. The lamb burger is paired with goat cheese. The tuna with a miso aioli. And the venison tag teams with Stilton, a strong cheese for a strong meat. These aren't burgers that Ronald, the Colonel, or the \\"king\\" could come up with. These are delicious, well though out works of art, as seen in their plating; open faced to be admired. \\n\\nWould I come back? - Yes. With drinks named \\"Blueberry creme frappe\\" and \\"Fish Bonker\\", I have to come back for a cocktail night.

Much to my delight, it was served in quarters (some places will just half it, like a \\"regular\\" sandwich, when you order a club without mayo, but not HG), they added cheddar to the come-with swiss, still make it with ham and turkey (not chicken like I've noticed at some spots - just a personal preference!) and the honey mustard was delish.

I tend to rate each restaurant based on what their particular demographic and intentions are. I may give a very reasonably priced restaurant a 5 star review because they hit everything on the nose and provided an excellent experience while I am forced to give Castagna a 4 star rating, (4.75) based on other high end establishments that I am grouping them with. ANYWAYS....\\n\\nWOW! I had been planning on coming here for some time but it has always been difficult to steer away from my many other Portland restaurants on the regular rotation. I finally made it and was not disappointed!\\n\\nThe goods:\\n\\nWell appointed facility with surprisingly intelligent lighting! For once I didn't have to take out my phone and use the flashlight to see the menu. I know, I know..sometimes a very dimly lit restaurant is a good thing, but in general I like well placed above table lighting. \\n\\nThe menu was a no brainer, You can have a set Prix Fixe or the Chefs Tasting Menu. I decided long before I came that the Chefs Menu would be the way to go. The menu is $125 per person with wine pairings and additional $60 per person. Not at all inexpensive, but I am a firm believer that most of life is a \\"get what you pay for\\" event. \\n\\nThe experience included I believe 10 courses with NUMEROUS snacks along the way. We were served a total of 22 items each....yes that reads TWENTY TWO!!! I won't bore you with a recount of every single item we were served, as the menu does change. I will mention the fact that the menu builds in perfect fashion starting with light delicate flavors and building to a finish so rich it bogles the mind, then leaving you lightened up in some supremely refreshing finishers.\\n\\nThe items that blew me away:\\n\\nGolden Brook Trout Roe with Crab Gelee\\n\\nOnion Terrarium with Smoked Oil\\n\\nShikoku Oyster with Oyster Ice\\n\\nDuck Breast and Duck Sausage with Duck Jus\\n\\nLamb Loin and Sweetbreads with Parsnip Puree\\n\\nMind you that EVERY SINGLE THING we ate was amazing! These were just the things that really stuck out to me.\\n\\nThe wine pairings were really well done. Not the very best I have ever had, but probably the most interesting I have ever had. The pairing included a greek wine and a house made Aquavit...the whole thing was really great because these were pairings that I don't think many restaurants would be willing to put together. It worked!\\n\\nThe best thing - the timing worked well. There was no rushed feeling during the meal. It was well paced and we left feeling perfectly satisfied as opposed to sick. In comparison, the 7 course meal at Alan Wongs on Oahu was rushed and by course 5 I wanted to poke my eye out! This ended up being a 4 hour and 20 minute meal!!!!\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\nWe ordered a couple of cocktails prior to the meal. I have to say, they were just completely underwhelming. I admittedly am a cocktail snob. I know my drinks. I didn't expect these to be to the level of Jeffrey Morgenthaler at Clyde Common, but they were just not well thought out, and more importantly, not well executed. Just skip the cocktails, or maybe the restaurant will see this and rethink their cocktail program?\\n\\nService. It was solid, well timed, pleasant enough. But for a $500 meal I would like a little warmer reception. I have bitched about this in the past. Your job as a server is to not only supply professional service, but to relate to me, just a little. Our server started off a little stand-offish, literally did not make eye contact with my wife, but by the end of the meal, (with effort from me), had come along a little.  When you see your patron is going to be friendly and engaging, engage them back!!! As I said, solid and knowledgable, but I just want more for that price and the tip will ALWAYS reflect it!\\n\\nGreat restaurant and great experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone!!"},{"name":"Tony's Fish & Oyster Cafe","address":"1511 Anderson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Litte, tiny restaurant on Granville Island.

It took a while to get a table and once we did it was another 15 min or so before we were helped. As soon as we got the servers attention we ordered everything to make it go as quickly as possible. 2 pitchers of beer, 40 hot wings, and a large pepperoni pizza. It was over 30 minutes before we got our beer. About an hour and a half on the wings and close to two hours on the pizza. We overheard another server tell another table that half of their oven was broken so it would be 2 hours for pizza. Unfortunately this was not communicated to us and we didn't over hear it until it was too late. They were SO under staffed and the only reason I'm giving 3 instead of 2 stars is bc our waitress was busting her butt to please everyone as fast as she could, and ended up taking a good chunk off the bill because of the wait. The food was average at best. Wings were small and came with prepackaged dressings. And the pizza was just meh. Maybe we ordered the wrong things but I don't think I'd go back.

Let's face it, what good is a yelp review if all you do is *gasp* review the place? The last thing I want is a bunch of 'useful's . . .  bleh.    Anywho, perhaps something 'funny' or 'cool' will just miraculously happen as I write.  If not, I apologize.  \\n\\nSo I've been to Polaris Grill twice, once for the brunch buffet about a year ago and once a few weeks ago for lunch.  The brunch had a zillion choices which ranged from breakfasty stuff like eggs benedict  to true lunchy stuff like carved meats and fantastic salads/pastas.  It was the best brunch I have ever had, but it was also the only brunch Ive ever paid $20 for.  Considering it was a year ago the details are fuzzy but I remember leaving full and happy.  \\n\\nMy most recent trip was a weekday lunch with my bestie a few days prior to Christmas. (Note: places to avoid 3 days before Christmas: Toys R Us, Best Buy, ANY Mall, and of course - Polaris Parkway) It took quite a while to drive less than a mile on Polaris due to traffic but it was worth it.  Luckily on the way back my BF remembered a nice lil shortcut to avoid the traffic. Good news since I practice what I like to call \\"active\\" driving, which involves lots of slamming on the brakes and driving close to the cars in front of me and I don't think the leftovers would have survived.  \\n\\nBF and I chose a seat at the bar and to our enjoyment the bar area was not busy and was nice and quiet.  The bartender was attentive and friendly acknowledging our menu choices as \\"fantastic\\" which made me feel like a culinary genius.  The meals were served with a basket of fresh hot bread and a seasoned butter that was tantalizing and also a nice surprise considering the reduced lunch time prices. \\n\\n We ordered the large 55 house salad and the shrimp/scallop New Orleans to share.  The pasta dish had an abundance of shrimp and scallops tossed in linguine and a tomato cajuin cream sauce.  The kick was nice and not overpowering.  The serving size was huge and at 12.95 fed both of us at lunch and was more than enough for me to have at dinner that evening.  \\n\\nThe salad was fresh and tasty and the house 55 dressing was one of the top 3 dressings I have ever had (The other 2 would be the house dressing at Rusty Bucket and the white french at The Office in Akron,  What? You can't rattle off your top salad dressings or dipping sauces at a moments notice?  pffff  . . amateur.)  \\n\\nWe ordered beers and the bartender had no problem humoring me with samples of a few beers I had never tried before (yes, I am high maintenance, but worth it).  After all her efforts I think I settled on a Bud Light so although she was probably cursing me behind my back, she was nothing but smiles as she served me.  Kudos.  \\n\\nI would definitely be back to give PG another try- the menu is very large (size wise it is somewhere between BJ's Brewhouse and The Cheesecake Factory) and I think there is something on there for everyone.  Also if I ever fast for 24-36 hours (you know, like if someone ties me up and attempts to starve me or I'm in a coma. . ) the PG brunch would definitely be the place to go to plunk down $20 and feast until I pass out.  \\n\\nOverall ( in an effort to end in a useful fashion): Polaris Grill, I  recommend you."},{"name":"The Busy Bee Cafe","address":"810 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I needed some soul food while I was in GA.

My husband rotates between the burger, flank steak, and fish special. We are usually too full for dessert and to be honest, I find the crumbles and crisps too sweet but the pigtails are awesome (minus the chocolate, too much for me).

However, it really did not live up to all the hype. To summarize, the basic issues were:\\n- UNDERSTAFFED\\n- INATTENTIVE BARTENDERS\\n- TOO MUCH ICE IN DRINKS\\n- LACK OF SYNCHRONIZATION BETWEEN EMPLOYEES/SERVICE ISSUES\\n- AVERAGE FOOD WITH SMALL PORTIONS (thus overpriced)\\n\\nHere were the main issues/complaints in more detail:\\n\\n1. Arrived at 6:30 PM and were told that we would have to make a reservation at 9:00 PM if we wanted to eat. I asked if they did walk-ins and they said yes, but all the walk-ins were filled... Doesn't really make sense unless they are assuming that every walk in planned to stay from then until closing (highly unlikely). Nevertheless we put our names down for the 9:00 PM reservation (only 3 of us by the way). They also had plenty of seating available outside but for whatever reason they were not serving out there (or so they claimed).\\n\\n2. THE BARTENDERS WERE HORRIBLE. I don't think they could have been slower or less responsive. For whatever reason they also had 2 of the bar seats reserved, so there were only 6 or so left for the crowded venue. Thankfully we were able to get a seat at the bar, but even then the bartenders were inattentive. It took me 30 min to get ONE DRINK. They also fill their drinks with WAY TOO MUCH ICE. I was done with the drink after a few sips. (To be fair, the drink was very good, but took way too long to make for the amount of time it took to actually drink it). They also closed my tab when I asked them to keep it open and put everyone's drinks on the wrong tabs. We ordered a bottle of wine next and it took them another 15 min just to open it. The entire bar experience was very disorganized and stressful.\\n\\n3. We headed outside with our bottle of wine and found an open table. Unfortunately, they did not have a staff member clean it beforehand so we had to remove the old drinks and clean the table ourselves. I then see one of the bartenders (1 of the 2 total bartenders) come out and bring a couple some food... This was especially irritating after being told that they don't serve food out there. Also, why was one of the bartenders taking the time to deliver somebody food. That's what waiters are for. The bar scene was already bad enough, he needed to be attending the bar.\\n\\n4. Then comes the actual meal itself. Once we were finally seated it was pretty unclear as to who our actual waiter/waitress was. We ordered two appetizers and they brought us the wrong one. I told them we ordered something different so they told us to keep the wrong appetizer (the one we didn't want) and they would bring out the others. So we ended up with 3 appetizers on our clustered table. They brought the food out pretty quick and started to remove the appetizers when we were only half way done eating them. We told the waiter we were still working on our appetizers but there was no room for the entrees so they had to remove them. To be honest, the food was pretty average and the portions were pretty small for what you paid for. My pork was overcooked and tough. \\n\\nOverall I think Mattie's has A LOT OF POTENTIAL, but is going to need to some work if they want to remain a popular restaurant. The renovations were really nice and the restaurant itself and the grounds were BEAUTIFUL. \\n\\nI will likely come back but will probably give it a few months to see if they make any improvements. PLEASE HIRE MORE PEOPLE AND BE SURE THAT THEY ARE ALL COMPETENT (unlike the bartenders)."},{"name":"El Oriental De Cuba","address":"416 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"Born and raised Miami until 23 years old.

Homeless are sleeping on the sidewalk near by. \\n\\nInside, I noticed a book donation box for prisoners sits in the corner next to the computer. Paintings hang on the wall near the windows. A bulletin board on the opposite wall that has fliers of current events in the area. A news rack is filled with informative magazines. The cafe looks like one would find in a liberal college town. It reminded me of some that I've been to in Berkeley, CA were philosophy and politics were passionately discussed. \\n\\nThe cafe's offers live music, a place to discuss philosophical, political thoughts, art shows, movies, Internet access, drinks and food. In other words a center for the community to hangout. \\n\\nThe staff and the customers are friendly. The Chi Tea is very spicy, which is a nice change from the typical bland taste that most coffee shops push off as Chi Tea. The tea can be made with rice, soy or almond milk. The prices on the menu are at fair market value. Not a great deal but fairly priced (http://redandblackcafe.com/menu/ ).\\n\\nWhat makes Red and Black cafe different from other cafe' is their vegan social anarchists policy. They have a \\"safe space\\" and \\"are welcoming to all\\" ( http://redandblackcafe.com/safer-space-policy/ ). \\n\\nWhat I didn't like about the cafe' is its vague safe space policy that states a person can be asked to leave if they are \\"Causing a worker or patron discomfort or distress for any reason\\". It is in direct contradiction to their \\"welcoming to all\\" mission statement. Basically, saying if a customer isn't exactly like everyone else then they are not welcomed. \\n\\nOn their contradictory rhetoric mission statement I have to give them below average score.

When ordering, the several staff members we ordered with, (training) were incredibly nice and accommodating with requests and questions.\\n\\nI got the #2 Rotisserie Chicken, and the #7 Cuban Pig and my friend got the #2 as well, and the #8 Annatto Shredded Pork. We both loved the Rotisserie Chicken - thought the chicken was moist, the corn shells were amazing - soft, yet slightly thick and sturdy. It is always a plus when a soft taco shell doesn't fall apart! My Cuban Pig was phenomenal.. all the makings of a Cuban with a taco twist. The shredded pork and the ham were really well done, and the balance of the cheese, as well as the mustard were done right. The flour tortilla was soft, yet slightly crisped and also well done. The only tortilla that beats it that I've had is the ones at Pappasito's Cantina. My friend thought her Annatto was fantastic as well - the pulled work was well done, and we both particularly loved the hibiscus tortilla. It was not only a beautiful purple, but unique and tasty. We weren't as fond of our queso blanco. It honestly wasn't great - very bland by itself. However, we did understand that it was probably not meant to be by itself, and usually is incorporated into the tacos, so it made sense that it was light on flavor. \\n\\nThe only gripe that I have here is that their spork silverware has got to go. Not only did I have to ask for it up at the counter after doing a search of the restaurant, but they just didn't work great. I'd like to see some real silverware - or better plastic ware. \\n\\nWe sat out on their large patio and really enjoyed the evening. Our names were called for our tacos pretty quickly even though it was moderately busy. The space was clean, open, inviting, and comfortable.

There are many components to go into a hotel, from customer service, rooms, amenities, two restaurants and bars on the premises, all the way to its proximity to other major attractions.

I didn't have much trouble with anything, which also speaks for customer service, but I also didn't have any negative experiences in which I also can't give you any problem solving material for this review. The next thing on the list would be rooms. The room was actually really spacious. A lot of the times you get a hotel room, That may be 300 ft.¬≤ and you feel cramped. These rooms were very big spacious and made me feel like I wasn't in a shoebox. They also had a balcony in the room.

If you want to yell to your friends down in the lobby you would be able to do so on this balcony. \\n\\nThe next categories are what many people really look for in a long term stay.

All Very good for a resort level hotel.\\n\\nWhat this particular hotel was lacking was great restaurants. They had one restaurant that was OK and I believe that was called the boardwalk. The rest of the restaurants inside the hotel, as you see from my previous review, were average to below average at best.

I only went there because I didn't have any food at home by chance.  And I was friggin hungry after fasting. All I said was that I had ordered the rice because it was fast and just wondered if they could possibly accommodate me with a sped up service.   She could have just politely said that it wasn't possible.  But no she has to  be sarcastic.  So I then asked her if they by chance had a delivery service (which I would be happy to pay for).  This time she gives me the most sarcastic, long \\"NOOOOOOOO!\\"  You know  that sound.  Not very nice.\\nWhen I picked up the order I asked who the manager was and she said that she is the manager.

It was a first-time visit.  I had searched the Fearless Critic for a new place, and I remember hearing things about this place.  So we decided on Mesa Ranch.\\n\\nFirst impressions were ok.  It's in a building that looks like someplace you'd go to visit your dentist or eye doctor, but that isn't anything bad.  We stepped inside and there was live music playing, and it was a little dark.  After my eyes adjusted I noticed that we were probably the youngest people in the place.  Not that there were blue-hairs everywhere, but this was bordering on Sun City.  We were asked if we had reservations, and I thought, \\"Uh oh.  We're going to have to wait a while.\\"  But we were seated right away.\\n\\nThe decor is ranch house meets The Alamo.  There isn't a spot on the wall that isn't covered with a picture or iron sculpture of a steer, cowboy, or horse.  Once you get past that, though, it's ok.  It isn't that big of a place, which is actually a good thing in my book.\\n\\nThe night didn't start on a good note, as our waiter took over 15 minutes to get to us for our drink orders.  After that, though, he was ok except for a delay in refills once.\\n\\nI had one of the Nolan Ryan steaks.  The waiter had not shortage of superlatives to describe all the items on the menu, and this description of the steaks intrigued me, if only because the baseball great was born in my hometown.  It was a 12-oz ribeye, and it was perfect.  I can honestly say it's probably the best-prepared steak I've had in town.  It did have a little more gristle than I like, but every ribeye has that streak of toughness in it.  The side of poblano mashed potatoes were good.\\n\\nMy dinner mate had the mixed grill platter, which had elk sausage, chicken-fried venison, and grilled quail.  He said it was excellent.\\n\\nBoth meals came accompanied by a choice of salad and bread.  The cornbread croutons on the salad were a nice touch.  I normally toss croutons to the side on a salad, but these I ate.\\n\\nSomething to note:  if you want dessert make sure you ask about it before you place your dinner order.  I overheard a woman at the next table ask for dessert after she had finished her meal.  The waiter (the one we also had) said that because they make many of their desserts on the spot you have to order it at the beginning of the meal.  This is NOT mentioned anywhere on the menu, and he had failed to tell them.  As a result the couple skipped dessert.  So we asked the waiter about dessert and he told us the same thing.  We mentioned that it might be a good idea to say something at the beginning of the meal.  But we ordered the apple pie a la mode.  It was excellent!  They make it when ordered, in a mini-skillet that comes out piping hot.  It tasted very fresh.\\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised with the prices.  Something this good I thought would end up costing more, but my steak -- including the salad and bread -- was $23.  The mixed grill was $28.  All in all, I think that's a good deal for what we got.\\n\\nIf it weren't for the slow kick-off to the meal I would have given this a 5-star rating.  But I will be back to try some of the other options on the menu."},{"name":"Regina Pizzeria","address":"250 Granite St","city":"Braintree","stars":"3","text":"Braintree location only.

The few times I've seen this dish, the okra look over teamed and unappetizing; not so at Busy Bee...defintely worth the try.\\nCandied Yams - Just try them.\\n\\nThe portions for the food were very reasonable (neither excessive nor stingy) and I walked out of there without the food coma I typically associate with soul food.  If you want some really good soul food this is the place for you.  I'd almost be tempted to give this place 4.5 stars if it wasnt for the wait.

At around the one hour mark I asked the manager about their little jenga block sets that were out for playing with while waiting, I asked if they sold them, because our daughters really loved them.  He said he would look into the procedure and see if he had any for sale.  When our wait for our table reached 80 minutes I asked if we should go somewhere else- not mad about the wait, because I totally understand they estimate how long it will be but cannot demand that other patrons get up when their meal is over- but my daughters were starving and we needed to feed them quickly.  The manager said our table had actually just become available and he was very sorry for the wait, and as an olive branch our daughters could take their blocks home with them, on him.  I just thought that was such an amazing service moment.  I've managed restaurants and know how it goes sometimes, and I really commend how the staff here handles crazy crowds and busy nights.  Our food was super fast and with a smile at all times.  My favorite is the ahi tuna taco on Bibb lettuce but you really can't go wrong here.

I had been there 3 1/2 hours and had just finished my second round of coffee and dessert.  I was also doing work on my computer.  Perhaps that is \\"table-squatting,\\" I don't know.

And to make matters worse, I can only assume that the lady who told me that I'm not \\"respecting the business\\" was either a manager or an owner.  Her sole job, apparently, was to walk around, hover, humph, and kick people out who were taking too much time.  No one in their right mind would actually hire a person so socially awkward and rude to do that job.  \\n\\nHey, just cuz I'm pretty sure you're reading this manager/owner, here's a friendly piece of advice for your business:  Post some signs that say \\"Use of tables limited to an hour or less.\\"  Then you put people on notice, and I would know that it's not a place I want to hang out.    \\n\\nYeah, Random Order has great pie, but I certainly will never go back there.

However, my ultimate sin in the bunch were the meringues........ Holy Crap!!! As my friend Walker was getting chills from eating one....I was doing everything I could from not grabbing all 5 remaining and shoving them into my kisser!!! I don't think that I have tasted something quite like it. The texture and flavor combos were top notch! \\n\\nWith that said....the almond croissant was just as good as Kimberly K. and Michelle C. claimed..... The Pain Au Chocolat was delish.

They serve innovative pizza dishes such as their Soul Food pie, which consists of fried chicken,collard greens and gravy. My personal favorite is the Big Mama which is their own take on the meaty pizza. One thing that i love about Jacks the most is that they DO NOT skimp on portions. The slices are large, and the topping are plentiful. Slices average around $4.50 and specialty pies are around 18 bucks. Their wings are great and cheap as well. Their menu is vast and I have yet to try everything, but I am sure from what I have had thus far and from the constant large crowds, that everything is amazing.

Anyway, they brought me a plate out that wasn't mine.  When they brought MY food out,  the baked chicken was under cooked and looked like it was smothered, well it was smoothered in gravy. I dipped my finger on the chicken an tasted it. I wasn't upset though just asked for my chicken to be fried instead.. As i waited for my chicken,  i kept my sides. The collard greens were really good. The macaroni...  Smh. It was....  For lack of better words. HORRIBLE. Sorry to say. I wasn't the only one at the table who agreed without me even mentioning it. It tasted like something gritty like hella rocotti cheese or i dont knw. It just wasn't appetising. By that time i was a little irritated. My friends fish was dry as ever, to the point where she squeezed 4 lemon splices on it to juicen it up and add flavor. Just didn work. Finally got my chicken, which I tasted without any hot sauce,  typical right,  anyway not what i was expecting. Added hot sauce. Soo disappointed. We asked Brittnie if they'd gotten a new chef because it wasn't my first time there. Nope, sane cook. So basically, there's no consistency.

I told her what I wanted again. At least this one was iced coffee, but it wasn't raspberry like I had asked for (twice). At that point I didn't care- took it home and never went back. Also, because it's so busy, parking is a pain (the lot is an awkward shape)."},{"name":"The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf","address":"13376 N Highway 183, Ste 800","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Stopped because they had a drive through.

Dunkin doughnuts has about the same sandwich. It's bigger, tastes better, and is $4 cheaper. Chai was basic with too much nutmeg. Not impressed with this place, despite the friendly staff.

They have a screwdriver that is made with great orange juice and Grey Goose vodka which was very refreshing poured over ice. For a brunch entree, I ordered the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict and a side of hash browns. Instead of an English Muffin, a light, yet sweet, cornbread is used as the base. On top of that is a large crab cake with lumps of crab meat and very little filler. The crab cakes were better than some of the ones I've had in Maryland. More than 90% of it was actual crab meat. On top of the crab cakes was an avocado spread, then a perfectly poached egg, and then Hollandaise sauce. This was a best of breed brunch entree.

The steak fajita is flavorful, albeit salty - not much onion, pepper filler - its all beef; I actually would prefer some more vegetation to cut the salt and the meatiness.\\n\\nBut whats the best about Granny's is the ranchero. Ever wanted non-vegetarian migas? That's the glory of the ranchero as they add pork rinds to your tacos on top of the chips, eggs, and avocado.

Simple, but tasteful decor (love the retro lights over the bar) greets you along with a friendly voice from behind the bar. There are tables, high tops and bar seating available, and it sounds like they generally don't take reservations. Great music playing, but not obtrusively. Decent tap selection for beer - currently Dogfish, Abita Purple Haze and Fat Tire (along with meh Miller Lite). \\n\\nThen there's the food. I can only speak to what I tried, but I can also tell you I'm inspired to come back and try more - so take that for what it's worth. \\n\\nTonight I tried the Croque Monsieur. You can see my photos in the app; imagine the best toasted bread you've ever had, topped with salamander-melted cheese on top of the bread, a subtly sweet honey ham, a smoky and slightly spicy stone ground mustard and more cheese inside. \\n\\nDid I mention this was a fancy grilled cheese place? Maybe should have. But dayum... I was salivating from the first sniff when I walked in and I was hooked at the first bite. \\n\\nFries are good; they had a double-fried texture, a sign of a fry pro. Service was very friendly, and while not fast, it was efficient and I didn't feel slowed down by the stop (though the two beers may have helped with that!). \\n\\nWill definitely return and try the buffalo chicken and some of the wonders on the menu."},{"name":"Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant","address":"343 N Front St","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"This hit the spot.

As soon as we walked in we were greeted and snagged a table at the bar.\\n\\nThe food at 50 Plates isn't as snooty as some--it's more like a upscale twist on some well-executed pub fare.  At least, that's what it seemed like from the bar.  We had a little trouble deciding which two appetizers we wanted to order, but eventually settled on the dungeness crab jalapeno poppers and the artichoke rolls.  The poppers were like a creamy crab cake stuffed inside a breaded and fried jalapeno--spicy and savory.  The artichoke rolls were filled with goat cheese, garlic and (of course) artichokes.  Both came with a tangy side of avocado ranch and were scrumptious.\\n\\nThe drinks were good, but not my favorite of the evening.  The \\"Smokey Tombstone\\" was a blend of smoked Bulleit bourbon, simple syrup and bitters, served up with a twist.  I like a good manhattan, and this sounded like an interesting variation, but in the end I didn't like the smoked flavor--it was like drinking a manhattan over a campfire.  Kathleen had the \\"50 Plates Cooler,\\" a blend of Bombay Sapphire, Aperol  (kind of like Campari), fresh grapefruit juice and tonic.  If you're a grapefruit fan, you will love this drink.\\n\\nThe decor was modern and the atmosphere seemed pretty lively, but without being obnoxiously loud.  Our server was prompt, super-friendly and even suggested some other places we might like to check out.

The outside of the building is colorful, sleek, and modern. The lobby is incredibly chic, stylish, and an architectural marvel. From the winding, marble staircases that lead to the pool and spa area, to the fountain feature (water drizzling down a clear vertical plexiglass pane), the lobby bar (live jazz band played Thursday night), etc. this place makes you feel like a king/queen and special. Friendly and helpful staff.\\n\\nThere is a Starbucks inside the hotel by the lobby area. The hotel is close to the many restaurants (and a few bars) up the road on International Drive\\n\\nThe rooms (we had the one on the 25th floor) are spacious, clean and comfy. The view from the floor to ceiling window to the outside is panoramic and beautiful. You can see the pool down below and the Orange County convention center as well as Orlando's skyline (not facing downtown though). Good insulation and/or wall thickness in that you can't hear your neighbors next to you. Comfy beds. Decent design and decorations. \\n\\nAs mentioned in previous reviews; the room has 2 cool unique features - ground lights that are controlled by motion detectors in the bathroom and one in between the beds. Really useful when going to the bathroom at night are walking around the room at night when you don't want to wake the other person in the room or trip on something. The other feature is that there is a tv in the mirror at the bathroom. What seems like a good idea, actually isn't though; especially for a short person. First off, our tv in the bathroom mirror only picked up 3 stations and also didn't really work. And like I said before, if you are on the short person, then you can't see your face or neck when shaving. You have to lean to the side and away from the sink to avoid the tv. The tv seems cool but you get over it real quick and is not really used.\\n\\nSome of the other cons to the room - is that our curtains wouldn't close all the way shut. This left a slit that let in just enough light in the room to be annoying and keep you up in the morning. Also, the bathroom lacked an exhaust fan. For a nice, swanky hotel not sure why there isn't one. There really should be one for a number of reasons.\\n\\nThe pool for Tower 1 is really nice. A few different areas to do different things. The bar was reasonably priced and had a decent drink menu. Straight to you chair/spot service (I believe only on the weekends?) was nice and helpful. A basketball hoop at the edge of the pool, fusbol, and ping pong tables were all nice touches. The big problem though is the fact there is definitely not enough room at the pool for the crowds they get on weekends. Me and my girlfriend couldn't find a single chair/chase-lounge on a Saturday at 11:30am. We had to sit at a table by the bar to enjoy the sun and pool. Simply put; the pool and surrounding area can't accommodate the amount of people in Tower 1. \\n\\nIf you self park, there is a very long walk from the parking garage to the hotel. Plan accordingly.\\n\\nOverall a nice hotel with a cool look (both inside and out) and nice features. But be warned - this hotel nickels & dimes you at any chance they can get. Whether it's parking fees, resort fees, expensive shots at the lobby, etc. It was kind of expected and sort of worth it but it's not cheap here."},{"name":"TGI Fridays","address":"3670 Camp Creek Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"I am hoping that the issue is this particular restaurant & not an adjustment to TGIF's quality of food.
