Doesn't touch the Cuban food I have had in SF.\\n\\nBut it's not bad.  I might have been inclined to add a half-star, but besides the fact that one cannot do that on yelp...but then again, probably would not ... only because on a relatively calm Wednesday night they were OUT of a number of what I consider sorta mainstay menu items...including most of their fritters and a few empenadas.  Not like there was a rush or they were getting slammed or anything, and it was only around 7:30 PM.\\n\\nSo, the stuff we had was pretty good.  Fun atmosphere, outside tables are nice on a warm day except the 2-seaters are lousy, sorta generic red metal which look more at home a Jack in the Box than a Cuban eatery...while the 4-seaters are nice, comfy wood benches.\\n\\nThe Palm Beach sangria is a good concoction; far better than their standard red sangria, which was really pretty boring (lacking in both spice and fruitiness) and I wouldn't suggest it.  As a matter of fact, both sangria alternatives are kinda overpriced..but at least the PB was GOOD.\\n\\nThe only fritter available (taro) was pretty yummy...fresh and cooked just right.  A Cuban restaurant quite fairly should be judged by how it does Platanos...and here it was a split-decision, The ripe, sweet Platanos were fantastic...perfect.  The fried green Platanos were absolutely terrible and no amount of table salsa or sauce dosing could save 'em.\\n\\nThe Ensalada Caribena was very good...cabbage gets a bad rap because few places know how to actually prepare it, but this salad was excellent..nice and refreshing while being slightly sweet and piquant at the same time.  Note: this salad comes as a small accompaniment to the fritters, if you don't wanna order the whole salad.\\n\\nMoving on. We aren't meat-eaters, but their seafood choices were done very well (Pescado con Coco and Camarones Enchilados). The latter was excellent; the former got lost in its own sea of veggies and sauce as can often happen with Latin-Carribean fare; but the dish was still pretty tasty. The sides accompanying them were only so-so...the refired beans and rice nothing special at all.\\n\\nI also will echo what was noted by others: the bill really shouldn't quite come out as high as it does for the fare you are served.\\n\\nWould I come again ?  Mmmm....yyyyes.  It was a fun place and the waitstaff was nice enough, if a bit rushed.  But I would just suggest you temper your expectations a bit.

That's what it's like at Giacomo's.\\n\\nMy friend and I started with the calamari, which was good.  The marinara is perfect and I love the fried slices of peppers thrown in with the squid rings.  I have had calamari a lot and this was rather standard--it didn't blow others out of the water.  I would probably start with another appetizer next time to try something different.  I think if you skip this to save room for other dishes, you're not missing much.  I had the glass of chianti, which I would recommend.\\n\\nFor the entrees, I had the homemade fusilli with the Giacamo sauce (their creamy tomato sauce) with lobster and shrimp.  The shrimp were great, but the lobster, not so much.  It was very chewy.  The pasta was wonderful though...nothing beats homemade pasta!  If I got this again, I'd nix the lobster and get the diavolo sauce (the spicy tomato sauce).  The cream didn't do much for the sauce and I think the spiciness would've put more zing in the dish.\\n\\nMy friend had the linguini with clams and mussels and the Scampi sauce (white wine, garlic and olive oil).  Her plate was tastier than mine, but it's hard to find something more complementary to mussels than wine and garlic.  She raved about this dish for days, and rightly so.\\n\\nThe garlic bread was nothing special.  It was lacking in the garlic taste and was pretty greasy from the olive oil.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just not how I like my garlic bread (I prefer more garlic taste and butter).\\n\\nWould I come back here?  Sure!

If you've been to NYC it's a lot like the little hole in the wall places there.\\nOn to the food. The sandwiches are really good. They are small but stuffed full, so one sandwich is a good snack, 2 is a light meal, and 3 will fill you up. (The combo of 2 sandwiches and a drink for $7 or 3 with a drink for $9 is a crazy good deal!) I love the steamed buns, and the short rib filling is out of this world. I also got the pork belly, which was great, and the grouper, which proved to be better fried fish than I've had in a long while. \\nI was a little disappointed in the accoutrements though. The grouper was supposed to have a kimchee slaw on it, but it was just normal, sweet-ish cole slaw. All the sandwiches had so little topping that it seemed almost an afterthought, but the upside to this is that there was little topping because the sandwich was so full of meat. Do with that what you will.\\nWe also got the tater tatchos, which are like nachos with tater tots. They were really good but my husband and I agreed they needed something.\\nI will definitely be back, but I sort of wish I hadn't bought in to the hype beforehand. I went in with a super high expectations, and while it was really, really good, it wasn't the earth-shattering experience I had hoped it would be.

Soho is one of those places.\\n\\nMy brother and fellow Yelper, Ryan V, told me about a Sunday Summer special they were running on lobster dinners and I immediately made reservations. One and a half pound Maine lobster with potatoes, corn and sausage for only $28.00. What a steal! I called on Monday to make reservations for the following Sunday and the hostess said I wasn't the only one as apparently word was getting around fast and they tend to run out of reservations by Wednesday. \\n\\nThe first thing you notice when you walk in the door of Soho is the amazing ambience. The main part of the restaraunt had dim lighting, white table cloths and candles on every table. The oversized bench seating and dark wood chairs accented the soft white and gray walls perfectly. The large art installations on every wall and high ceilings made the main dining room a fairytale. \\n\\nImagine my surprise when we were seated on the enclosed, \\"Florida Room\\" (for those from the South) enclosed patio, just off of the main dining room. This room made me feel extremely claustrophobic. The ceilings were very low and there was a  table every 2 feet, crammed in to thisalready tiny patio space. Each table was full of large, boisterous parties making the noise level like a concert hall. The walls were a bright white color only adding to the cramped room and the sconce lights on the wall had to be the same wattage as the sun. I was surprised how busy it was for 8pm on a Sunday but half the patrons were wearing lobster bibs so I understood their reasoning. \\n\\nWe were immediately greeted by Liz, our very fun and playful waitress. Yes, I liked her for her name but her personality and her banter back and forth with my friend only sealed the deal. She handed us over some menus, went over the appetizer specials, got our drink order and told us our lobsters were on the way. \\n\\nWithin minutes of sitting down, all I could hear was the conversation coming from the large party of 8 behind me and the party of 5 behind him. Why stick 2 people between large parties? I can understand if we were a walk in but we had reservations. My friend began talking about a project at work and I couldn't hear a word he was saying. Considering this was my last night to spend time with him, I became irritated. I tried to lean in closer, ask him to speak up, even jokingly asking him to text me but the room felt like it was closing in on us. \\n\\nWhen Liz came back with our drinks I asked her if we could move. She graciously moved us to a table on the inside of the restaraunt in a corner booth and it saved our night. I wanted to hug Liz considering her moving us meant so much. We rarely have time together and something as simple as a Maine lobster dinner was special considering one of our best trips was to Bar Harbor Maine where I experienced lobster for the first time. \\n\\nWe were given plastic bibs, a paper place mat with directions on how to open and eat lobster and 2 large red, steaming tubs came from the kitchen to our table. I was so excited I began eating immediately. I can understand the kitchen staff making several lobster orders so cooking in bulk is important but if you cook the sides, potatoes and corn, in a water bath, you need to remove them periodically so they don't taste like water logged mush, which is exactly what they tasted like. I had already complained about the noise and was moved, I didn't want to now complain about the food so I pushed the potoatoes and corn to the side and went for the main event-LOBSTER!! When I broke open the tail and began separating the pieces I noticed a thick white, almost mucous like layer coming from the lobster and all over the meat. I asked a passing waiter what it was and he said it was the lobsters blood-immediate turn off. I lived in Boston for years so I know what Maine should taste like and \\"blood\\" was not it. I tried to wipe it off with the napkin, I even attempted to eat a few bites but the thick layer had such a bad texture, I was afraid I'd get food poisoning. Thankfully, my friends lobster wasn't bleeding and we split his.\\n\\nOverall, the chocolate bread pudding dessert, beautiful decor and my dinner date made up for the worst lobster I've ever had. I'll be back to sit at the bar for a drink but I'll pass on the food."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"I love the food here!

Fall off the bone tender and if you truly know ribs like I do, the end pieces are the freakin best, caramelized on the outside, meaty and juicy on the inside. Second to the pork ribs is the beef ribs. Beef ribs can be notoriously hard to do well and I've had many experiences with tough, dry beef ribs (*cough County Line).

The salad was pretty mediocre, but it wasn't the star of the meal, so I didn't think much more. We got the 3 peice halibut for $20 and when it arrived, I wanted to get up an leave. The pieces were tiny. It's a good thing I am watching my weight. While I'm no halibut expert, I did find the pieces too tough. They had the texture of chicken breast. The tartar sauce that went with them was good, so I wonder if it was made from scratch. The star of our meal was the strawberry shortcake. It was quite excelelnt and only a buck.

To me, that alone gets it 3 stars, then I'll give it a fourth one for all the fun times I've had here as well as the friendly and accommodating staff. The menu is very interesting - there seems to be a lot of stuff on it that you just can't get at other places you'd go to for lunch/dinner and a beer. (Though it does have the word \\"Deli\\" in its name, so that makes sense.) I've had the burgers, fish & chips, wings, nachos and pizzas here and all were good. Many times I visited here, though, I went simply for the beer/cider selection, which is unparalleled in the Lake Mary/Longwood area.\\n\\nThere are a lot of TVs both in- and outside, which makes this an ideal spot during football season. My father and some friends and I were regulars here for Giants games a few years back, though we now make Mugshots in Altamonte Springs our home since we found out that that's where a Giants gathering convenes. However, when the Giants play on a Sun./Mon. night & the gang isn't getting together at Mugshots, my father and a few friends and I are usually here. It seems they even upgraded to a few really good TVs (inside and just to the right of the entrance) - we watched a game here maybe in late Sept./early Oct. and were really impressed with the TV we were watching our game on. Looked good!\\n\\nIt's okay to bring your kids here, too - a few of my friends have children & have brought theirs here to watch the Giants games. They may hear the occasional expletive, though this isn't a rowdy place and people don't get carried away with any regularity ... though it has happened before. (I've even been guilty of it myself, though it was during isolated incidents - to be specific, the Giants' playoff wins vs. the Cowboys and Packers on their way to the Super Bowl a few years ago.)\\n\\nI prefer this Jax to the one on Edgewater Dr., though I've only been to the latter maybe 3-4 times ... which I really can't explain, since I live less than 5 minutes from it!\\n\\nOverall, this is a cool place with a menu that should have something for everyone and a beer/cider selection that should have you coming back several times to try everything that sounds interesting.

I first discovered this mecca in 2007 starting my first job a few minutes down Tremont St. I soon became known as \\"the guy who eats the same thing EVERY day for lunch.\\" \\"How can you do that?\\" they asked. Well, when possibly the friendliest man I've ever met already has my order halfway ready by the time I've accepted a sample of the tastiest falafel I've experienced this side of the Atlantic Ocean (I lived in Israel for four years, so I'd like to think I have some authority when reviewing Middle Eastern food), it's hard not to keep going back.\\n\\nAfter a year of lunch time bliss, I moved out of Boston and down to Virginia. For two long years my stomach ached for the crispy falafel and tender chicken shwarma. I don't think there is another place in the USA where you can get food of this quality in a such a hunger-blasting portion (for an incredibly fair price, I might add). When I realized I would be moving back to Boston, the first thing I did was start planning my return to the King. I sheepishly wondered if the King himself would remember me - a fool's dream, I know. Why, of the thousands of customers, would he remember me after two long years? But, in what is a testament only the character of the King, he greeted me with a warm smile and the plate I'd dreamed of for so long.\\n\\nYou really can't go wrong here - If you're not sure whether to go falafel or chicken, just ask for a king special and get the best of both worlds. If you're looking for something a little more adventurous, he also serves up a lamb shank that falls right off the bone.\\n\\nThe tremendous food and spectacular service are the reasons I make the 30 minute round trip trek every day now that I'm back working in Boston (but unfortunately no longer around the corner). Ignore the questionable locale, the long lunchtime line tells you all you need to know (don't worry, it moves quickly - the King churns out those plates faster than you can order them).

My first trip was years ago and nothing too remarkable; a couple shared apps for dinner, a PBR and a 'see ya later'. Since it had been so long, bf and I decided to try this spot for brunch last Saturday. While on the hunt for the perfect Bloody Mary, we had been recommended Surly Girl (by another Columbus bartender), so what better way to start a gorgeous fall day than with a little vodka, right? \\n\\nWe got there around noon, which was great because about 8 people came in after us and I didn't feel like waiting (does anyone, ever?). We immediately ordered some drinks, and I loved that they offered their Bloody Mary in three heat levels. Bland drink = blah. I opted for the medium version, while my adventurous bf went with the super spicy. Mine was delicious. Perfect amount of spice if you like it spicy, and a great salt & pepper rim. Nothing fancy to garnish though, just a lemon, a lime and an olive. The sriracha Bloody Mary was INTENSE. I only had a sip and don't think I could have made it through an entire drink, but it was interesting to say the least. Bf only had one of those...\\n\\nI hadn't really noticed how long we had been waiting on our food because I was happily enjoying both my drink and my company, but the waitress (possibly manager) walked over apologetically with some cupcakes and to tell us that our order had gotten lost (not rang in?) and would still be a bit longer. She brought over 2 Red Velvet cupcakes and when I asked if they were the daily special of Beet & Goat Cheese, she happily replaced one - then comped our first round of drinks. Well, let's just say if you give me a perfect fall Saturday, a stiff drink and cupcakes, I am in heaven. Felt kind of bad for a nearby table though - they were in the same waiting boat and didn't receive any freebies. \\n\\nBy the time the food came I was feeling pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good. I had ordered a BLT with Egg and Avocado, he ordered a breakfast burrito. Both with redskin potatoes. Food was decent. Drinks were better. \\n\\nKudos to our waitress who turned what could have been a horrible start of the day into something worth reviewing.

The atmosphere, the service, the FLAVOR is the bar at which other BBQ houses try to measure to.  The only way to eat is Family Style, for $15 at lunch, you can eat your fill and still be full at supper.  This is great food and it sticks to the belly!  \\n\\nI liked the Ribs the best, tender and moist, not quite falling off the bone, but bursting with smoke flavor.  A natural sweetness permeates the meat, balancing the salty and smokey flavors.  The crispy crust locks in the moisture, and leaves you begging for more, which your waiter will happily provide.  The tangy spicy rib sauce is fantastic, and goes with the meat perfectly without disguising or taking away any of the flavors. \\n\\nHonestly, I thought the sausage was only ok, and the first plate of brisket we got was on the dry side... the second plate of brisket was really fatty and tasty.  Later that night, we went to another BBQ house that had good and most consistent cuts of fatty brisket, but honestly, the smokey flavor of Salt Lick absolutely blows the others away. \\n\\n\\nThat smokey flavor can only come from 2 things... that is real billowing black clouds of real smoke coming from logs, and time.  This is not something you can rush.  \\n\\nI didn't each much of the sides, the coleslaw was fresh and pretty tasty, but the beans and potatoes were pretty much a non-event in my mouth.  The bread was heavy and I wouldn't have traded the stomach real estate away from the meat for the bread. \\n\\nMy wife and I and our 2 favorite traveling buddies flew all the way from the SF Bay Area to TX to eat BBQ, and our meal at Salt Lick made it ALL worth it.   Nothing in the bay area compares.  Uncle Frank's has a similar quantity of smoke flavor, but it comes mostly from liquid smoke and leaves a NASTY aftertaste.  Armadillo Willy's (which I hate to even mention, but have to, since so many Bay Area-ans think it is Texas BBQ) is like spoiled milk to Haagen Daas... not even in the same league and should be shut down for false advertising.  \\n\\nI can't wait to come back... and I don't give out 5 stars for nuthin.

I also had an arugula side salad which had a nice, light olive oil and vinegar dressing, if i remember correctly, but the bottom line was that it was incredibly fresh and crisp.

We had browsed the menu online before going and pretty much decided what we wanted.  I kind of wish we hadn't touched the menu's or top of the table because they were both really filmy.  We ordered a frito pie appetizer, I got the meatloaf platter with the poblano mashed potatoes, green beans and cupcake.  The hubby got the pigs in a biscuit with the same sides.  We got 2 red cream sodas and the server looked at us like \\"ooh, don't go crazy with the hard stuff so early!\\"  It was a little disappointing because the ratio of syrup was off so I just didn't drink it but no biggie.  We got our entrees with our little toys and such and after the server left we looked at each other.  He forgot our frito pie.  This looked like enough food anyway so we didn't need it but that's not the point.

Um, I really hate to say this but it tasted like a Hungry Man/tv dinner meatloaf.  I know some people have said it's life altering but I'd say you just haven't had really good meatloaf before if that is your idea of the best you've had.  The potatoes were awesome, a good heat from the peppers and balanced with some garlic and cheese maybe?  The green beans were underwhelming and too al dente for our tastes.  It's like they blanched them for 2 minutes so we left them.  We didn't get our choice of cupcake, the server chose for us so I got a carrot cake and he got red velvet.  I gave him the carrot cake.  He loved it.  I thought the red velvet was decent but something was off.  When we left I said, 'the red velvet cupcake tasted like cornbread.\\"  He said \\"YES!!!

The fella taking my order was friendly enough, and he told me that my order would be ready in 15 min.\\n\\nHe was a bit off by the time, but the wait didn't seem long.  As I waited, I observed that there were perhaps 3 stools in this take-out spot.  They have their menu listed on a chalkboard, and there was a seafood theme to their decoration and the clock.  I also got to watch my Fresh Catch Platter $21.95 being fried and piled in the styrofoam container one item type at a time.\\n\\nBy the time I got my bounty home, I noticed that the fried calamari side $7.95 had begun soaking through the paper bag.  It was all rings and kind of soft.  As a tenacle girl, it was okay, but not to my taste.\\n\\nThe best part of the platter was the crunchy onion rings (4).  The fries were fine and crispy too, where they weren't made soft by the seafood lying on top of them.  The 3 non-jumbo shrimp were pretty good, the fish fingers (not fillets) were fine.  But the scallops and clams were soft, and the crunchiness of the clams were (I suspect) from the sand.\\n\\nA cold little cup of cole slaw, 2 tartar sauce (nice!), and cocktail sauce were included.  I found the slaw to be the creamy sort, okay but not as sweet as KFC's.\\n\\nNext time I'm trying the broiled items...\\n\\n***\\n\\nA week or so after my first visit, I called in a another order... again they were out of the lobster roll.  Turns out they make them fresh each day in limited batches, which sounds good, but I was really bummed, since I was looking forward to trying it.\\n\\nThey were also out of the single fried shrimp.  I was hoping to find out how the single fried shrimp compared to the three shrimp that came in the Fresh Catch Platter, but it was a no-go.\\n\\nI had also noted that on their printable online menu that the soups came with a side.  Odd, but cool, I thought.  But the lady taking my order said they don't.  Another disappointment.  I'm getting tired of being disappointed.\\n\\nFinally, my order ended up being the broiled seafood platter $15.95, 2 clam chowders $5.99 ea, and a side of sauteed vegetables $2.95 (by vegetables, they meant zucchini... if they meant zucchini, why didn't they just say zucchini?).  15-20 minutes?  Okay.\\n\\n\\"You deserve lobster perfection.\\"  That's what my radio told me as I made my way home with the food.  Too bad I didn't receive it.\\n\\nThe chowder was okay, but not great.  It was the cream sort, but wasn't very chunky.  And my mom noted some sand in her serving (she finished off the bowl, so perhaps the sand settled).  The oyster crackers added some unnecessary saltiness to the chowder.\\n\\nThe zucchini was okay too.  I'm not used to the seasoning they used, but at least it wasn't overcooked.\\n\\nThe broiled seafood platter was a bit dinky... not just in portion, but also in the size of the individual types of seafood.  The bay scallops were moist enough, and the fillet not overcooked, but the shrimp looked and tasted a bit like that Chinese dried shrimp ha mai.  The fries were a bit chewy (fries can be chewy?) (was it because they didn't make holes in the styrofoam like they did my last visit?), but as the conveyor of ketchup, it may have been the best part of tonight's meal.  And, I realized a bit later, they forgot my cole slaw.\\n\\n***\\n\\nIn summary, this is by no means a destination spot.  And with all the disappointments, it wouldn't be my first choice for take-out.

I asked if it was an extra charge for the hazelnut syrup and she said there was so I told her to take it back. Some things would be good to know up front. I have never seen this before & thought it was an odd way to serve flavored coffee.\\n\\nI ordered the pancake combo with scrambled eggs & cheese and bacon. My eggs arrived with a long black hair running thru them. Needless to say I sent them back and when they remade them they came without the cheese (but also without the hair). The bacon had a very smoky taste was very thick cut & was extremely salty. \\n\\nI really did not enjoy anything I ordered and was kicking myself for not going to Egg Harbor. \\n\\nI do not recommend going to this place and I will never return.

I had seen them listed on a bunch of best of Boston lists but had yet to try them out, so I went a few times for lunch and it was A+ each time.  As you enter, you find a beautiful carved out industrial style restaurant with a big open bar and delightful raw bar adjacent. The vibe was very classy, and hip, while still allowing for a more casual dining experience as well if that what you're seeking. \\n\\nThis review is from my dinner experience on a Saturday night. We had called earlier in the afternoon to try to secure a rez but were informed it was full through 10:30pm (very common for this place, the buzz is real). The nice receptionist/host then told us there were nearly a 1/3 of the seats available to walk-ins, so it made sense to go that route seeing as we really wanted to eat there. I dropped my girlfriend at the door and waited to park in case it was a 2 hour wait, but found that the very last high top was available right now. At 6pm on a Saturday this was a gift, so I quickly parked at one of the $15 dollar lots and made my way. \\n\\nWe started off with a couple of Trillium double IPA's (which has become my single fav beer maker) and proceeded to order from the raw bar next. She ordered a variety of super fresh, tasty oysters with some shrimp cocktail, while I ordered the scallop salad (which consisted of artisan bread slices, cr√®me fraiche and some pickled radishes to spread over the scallop and bread). To say we were blown away is an understatement;  100% fresh, taste through the roof and nice sized raw options made it glorious. \\n\\nBeing our first time and having time to kill before meeting friends later on, we decided to add the spicy fish tacos as a secondary app. The order came with 2 nice sized soft tacos and the flavors were to die for. Such a nice little go between to split while enjoying the IPA's and waiting for our main courses. Highly suggested. \\n\\nFor the main courses, she had the daily whole fish which was so perfectly prepared and extremely clean and healthy and I had the burger with the fried oysters on top. We've fallen in love with places such as Lineage, the Gallows and a few others for having the best burgers in Boston, but on this night, Row 34 took the title. Considering we touted Lineage as the best burger for almost 2 years means we don't change our rating and de-throne the best burger without the one supplanting it hitting the equivalent of a grand slam, and this burger did just this. UNBELIEVABLE JOY FOR MY MOUTH AND TASTE BUDS!!! This is easily one of the best experiences we've had in nearly 3 years touring the city trying new food. \\n\\nAs a nice touch, we had Coconut Tres Leches Cake with a couple espressos. This dessert was a mix of soft, chilled cake layers with a beautiful topping and not an overwhelming coconut flavor. Right up my alley!

I would recommend skipping the pork ribs and going for the sausage and brisket (the turkey was also very tasty).\\n\\nThe staff were all extremely friendly, informative, and attentive.

This is our second visit. The first time we sat at the bar and had appetizers which were great. Unfortunately, tonight was a disappointment. Like many of the other reviewers, I really want to like this place. We want to support local businesses but when our experience is a mirror image of the majority of reviews, I have to ask, is anyone reading these reviews. The two major issues are the service and the inconsistent food quality. Clearly, many Weymouth residents are trying to support this restaurant. Tonight we had 2 burgers and 2 fried fish entrees. Both were flavorful but overcooked. We had to ask for our waitress to come back for drink orders repeatedly and our food took over an hour to come out. The place was full from 7pm - 8pm but they needed more waitstaff (or a bus person) and clearly more help in the kitchen. An hour for what we ordered was crazy. Thankfully, we were not in a hurry and enjoyed the atmosphere. One thing I would add is that the 2 bartenders were not outgoing at all. I initiated conversation with them as I waited for my friends to arrive but they made no attempt to keep the conversation going. I also had to interupt their conversation to order another drink as they stood directly in front of me talking. All that being said, we did have a couple of good house drinks, the home made potato chips were great and the beer prices are very reasonable. Please correct the issues before we lose faith.

We walked into the cafe and were not greeted or directed, even by a sign. We sat at the counter where 2 to 3 people behind the counter were able to avoid any eye contact. Finally, I noticed a booth in the back that was open. We got our group together(book store customers) and headed to the back. Servers came to the tables next to us but no one made eye contact. We finally went back up to the counter and forced eye contact by asking whether we should order our drinks at the counter. We were told that, we were supposed to check in in the front (rather than through the wide entry from the bookstore). After some serious pondering of this dilemma, during which I was wondering if it would help if we walked up front and came back, she finally told us that someone would be right over to take our order.  A long time later, a server came over and spoke at length about the fact that we were supposed to check in in the front (by this time there were several empty tables), that there were hardly any menus left and that she would be back. A few minutes later she returned with the coveted menus, which apparently was enough for us to ask since we never saw her again! All of the adjacent tables turned over and the new customers orders were taken. My daughter, who lives in the area said, \\"this is why I like Waltham, Boston is filled with Hipsters\\".  We left.

They would put them out, the waitress would check the food and the ticket, notice something wrong and the cook would look pissed and take it back. This happened several times. We waited 30 minutes for our food which is especially ridiculous because usually we get our food pretty fast at Keke's. FINALLY, the food arrived. My boyfriend's omelet had extra peppers when he wanted none. They didn't give him him his toast until he was finishing his food. Both our omelets were noticeably cool, as if they had been sitting out for a bit. Just an all around very disappointing visit. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.

My tilapia was actually flavorful- and not just mushy white stuff on plate, which is usually how it comes out.\\n\\nTeranga's menu is unique.  Definitely unlike anything else in Boston.  The two times I've been there have been successful endeavors.  I suppose the service might be a tad slow, but I was having such a good time with my fellow dining companions it didn't bother me.  \\n\\nHusband had the Mafe- a lamb stew- and raved about it.  Other diners at the table enjoyed the Brochette and another lamb dish, name of which escapes me at the moment.  Appetizers were the fayata (I think- the pastry filled with fish) and poisson croquettes.  Only issue with those: only three pieces per app- hard to split with a table of four.  Or even with a table of two.  Have also had the little black-eyed pea balls- the sauce they come with is amazing.  \\n\\nAnd definitely try their juices- the ginger drink is divine.  I just wish they had some vodka to throw in there. Ah, the trouble with Boston's archaic and puritanical alcohol licensing laws.  At least they have a lovely, well-priced wine list to more than make up for it.\\n\\nOh- and the decor?  It's understated, lovely, very south end- exposed brick and all.

I am not foreign to the amazing food scene in Portland, but this place definitely caught me by surprise with its authenticity, melt-in-your-mouth meat dishes, reasonable prices and ridiculous portions. I came here with my friends after flying across the entire country. The moment we sat down, we were cradled by a waft of fried olfactory delights coming from the kitchen. It didn't take long before we recognized the source: golden yucca logs (yes, I consider them logs, not just fries). For the group, we shared the yucca logs/fries, got the pulled pork, the oxtail, the fried beef and the beef tongue. I must admit that of all of these amazing selections, my favorite was definitely the oxtail. The meat practically melted in my mouth and was served on a giant plate with enough food to feed a starving family of 4. My absolute favorite was the corn fritter that contained a subtle sweetened aftertaste that made me grin from cheek to cheek. The fried beef was actually...just ok, and the tongue was good, but definitely much chewier than its rear end compatriot. I ordered a flan to go, and while I did not taste it, it looked very enticing and home-made.\\n\\nOverall, this was a wonderful place and I strongly recommend sharing your food with everyone.

When I arrived (after calling and speaking to the hostess twice) I was told that not only did they not accept reservations with requests for the patio, I had to wait 30 minutes. Considering I had called ahead, it would have been super if either of hostess editing my reservation could have maybe warned me that my patio table would not be reserved. Especially because I called 6 minutes prior to my reservation, where she would have had the perfect opportunity to let me know I didn't have to rush because I didn't have a table anyway !!!!! In addition, the girl I dealt with was incredibly rude and unapologetic (she had blonde straight hair I didn't catch her name but I'm sure you guys have a schedule with it on there) so I found the manager! When I spoke to the manager with short dirty blonde hair and a salmon shirt, didn't catch his name either, he had a wonderful attitude!!!!! (Please sense the sarcasm) He told me that my reservation isn't good for a patio table, because the patio table is first come first serve. Which I find super interesting because it's in fact part of the floor plan and part of the restaurant. Personally, as a shift lead hostess for a restaurant that seats 1200 people, one of the largest in the world, I found it incredible that four girls at the host stand were incapable of planning for their upcoming reservations. Not only should the table be reserved but it should be preplanned at least 30 minutes beforehand. My service was mediocre, I saw our server three times.

I don't necessarily blame the manager, but...Three of us went here on a Monday at 3:30 pm.  Absolutely not crowded, noisy or rushed in any way. I ordered: \\"... the fish and chips (I paused for clarity, with eye contact and all that) ...AND a side order of onion rings, please.\\" Waitress looked like she understood.  OK.  She brings out the salads for my fellow diners (I had none).  After an appropriate interval, she brings out their two entrees.  Then she brings out mine.  Its supposed to have 1 pound of fish like the menu said.  It has one piece of fish, no \\"chips\\" (fries) and a few onion rings on the plate.  She puts it in front of me and says, \\"This is supposed to come with two pieces but we're out so it wont be full price. Let me know if you want anything else\\" and starts walking away.  I said, \\"First off, the rings were a side order, not a substitution.  Next, bring me a menu so I can see if I want to make another order.  Also, please bring me some malt vinegar.\\"  Well, I got the malt vinegar and half way through my meal she brought out a side of fries, and never asked if I wanted another drink.  I looked at the plate and thought this is a $7 meal, not the $13.50 menu price. No tip, you say?  Well, I was a guest so I didn't have a say in that.  I would have handled it differently if I was not a guest.  I do have two tips though.  1. For the waitress:  Check the kitchen early to see if your table's orders are correct (you sure were not too busy for that).  If they are not, inform the customer ASAP and come to an understanding.  If they are, say, minus a piece of fish, for example...DON'T COOK IT AND WAIT TO SERVE THE OTHER DINERS, THEN SHOVE THE HALF-AN-ORDER AT ME AND TELL ME IT WON'T BE FULL PRICE AND START WALKING AWAY!  Maybe I would change my order.  Maybe I'd order something in addition while there is still time to prepare it with the other diners' orders.    2. My second tip is for you dear reader:  If the waitress with the short, fake red hair and face piercing stops by to take your order; MOVE....preferably out the door.

The subs are big enough to fill your stomach. Come to think of it, all their servings are pretty big. We are hungry little greedy pigs, so when we were done with the food we ordered Cannoli and a Tiramisu. There is a different taste to the Cannoli when served by a man with a heavy Italian accent. I don't know if its the accent that did it, but the desserts were both very tasty. Tiramisu can get ruined when its too sweet. Theirs is perfection for me. \\n\\nAnother good point - the prices! I paid for one sub, one pasta, one soda and the Tiramisu - $19. Beat that! We were so happy we left a generous tip, I'm sure you will too when you eat here.

My only knowledge of the actual bookstore is the rack in the front with the sticker books, about which I don't really have an opinion.\\n\\nAnyway, we were seated right away in a booth in the back by a friendly manager.  About 10 minutes later, a waitress abounded.  She seemed nice enough, we ordered our drinks, then she disappeared (how long does it take to fetch straight up cups of coffee?).  People at a table near us, who were seated after us, were receiving their meals by the time we got our beverages.  This would set the precedent for our Trident experience.\\n\\nThe point of this review is that I think this was the most absurd waitress experience I ever encountered.  Not only was she moseying around the place like a geriatric on holiday, instead of like a woman with at least 6 tables that I could count, but she also managed to squeeze in an attitude problem, which must have been exhausting for her.   We put in our order, with my boyfriend quite articulately, in a voice not too loud yet not too soft, asking for the basket of fries.  When our food came, several lifetimes later, she presented him with a plate of home fries before scurrying off.  We were no fools at this point - we knew another World War would be fought and resolved before we saw this girl's face near our table again, so my friend hopped up with the plate and brought it over to the counter, just asking that we get the fries instead.  Instead of allowing the swap, the waitress huffed that she'd \\"be right with us\\", which is Trident server code for 10 minutes.  This is where the story of woe really gets good.\\n\\nShe comes over awkwardly, with the sort of long, breathy \\"hiii\\" that you'd get from a former make out buddy whom you defriended on Facebook for sending you too many invites to her open mic nights but whom you have just seen at the Sharper Image and now have no way of escaping.  She explains, \\"now, you want the basssket of fries?  I really could have sworn you said home fries...\\"  (anyone who has ever waited a single table in his or her life knows this is possibly the dumbest thing you could ever say to a paying customer). Once we assured her he really and truly had requested the fries, she acquiesced.  The fries turned up about 20 minutes later, with the caveat from our ever-socially-appropriate waitress, \\"better late than never, I hope.\\"  She also assured us that the home fries that we never ordered, did not want and did not have on our table for longer than 10 minutes would be removed from our bill.  How nice.\\n\\nThe people next to us had similar woes.  One woman ordered the \\"Backache\\", an original beverage on Trident's menu (which my friend also got and was in fact reportedly delicious).  The waitress brought her a single pancake on a plate.  Backache.  Pancake.  Basket of fries... at least we just got home fries, and not a bucket of flies?  Casket of ties?  Truly a \\"who's on first\\" sort of tragicomic experience.\\n\\nI am compelled to retell this story because my friend has been there a few times before and assured me that the service is pretty consistently bad (slow at best, rude-about-messing-up-your-order-while-also-being-slow at worst).

There was one other couple in the place eating when we arrived, and 6 or 7 idle employees chatting amongst themselves at the bar. We were seated by one person, and when we asked if we could order a drink, we were informed that he'd need to go discuss with someone about whether our table would be his, or someone else would wait on us. Ok, so 5 minutes later our server arrives, and we place out drink order. Fifteen minutes later they finally arrive. I was about to walk over and interrupt the employee social hour going on at the bar to get them myself. The food showed up in a reasonable time frame. The server approached our table with a water pitcher in her hand to check on us, and kept right on going to another table without filling our empty glasses, only to have to go retrieve it again later. It's like they just don't get it yet. \\n\\nBased on the food you should absolutely go check this place out.

Maybe it's that other reviewers are too embarrassed by how much they've spent to give a sub-5 star rating. Maybe it's that other reviewers think Salt Lick is an institution which can do no wrong. Whatever the reason may be, I can't possibly give this place any more than two stars. \\n\\nWe've known about Salt Lick for well over ten years, but only made our first visit this weekend. I knew as soon as we pulled into the Walmart sized parking lot that we were in for disappointment, but my wife and I tried to keep an open mind. We got there at around 1:30 on a Saturday and the wait wasn't too bad. We actually felt lucky that we only had to wait 15 minutes amongst the beer and wine swilling, obnoxiously loud suburbanites waiting with us given that there are two separate lines in which one could potentially wait, a pager pickup line and a pager drop off line. \\n\\nAfter being seated our server promptly took our orders. Despite my reservations I did actually anticipate some expertly smoked meats and delicious sides. After all, all those TV showcases and rave reviews about the place couldn't all be wrong, right?\\n\\nOur food came out fairly quickly, brisket and pork ribs for me, a brisket sandwich for my wife, and turkey for our daughter. The first couple of slices of brisket were pretty good. Those slices were juciy and tender with the perfect amount of fat left on. The flavor of the brisket was good, but my wife and I both thought it had barely any smoke flavor to it. The last 3 slices I had though were extremely dry and needed liberal doses of sauce to get down, which for me was a big turn off. I'm a firm believer that quality bbq does not require any sauce. The ribs were tasty as well, but also extremely dry and tough. The turkey, while it had a nice flavor, was the driest of all the meats we had. It looked like lunch meat that had been left on the counter for a day or so. The sides weren't much better. Their ranch style beans tasted decent, but the potato salad was, can you guess, dry...and had a strange grainy texture to it. \\n\\nWithout a doubt we would not go back to Salt Lick and could not recommend it to anyone looking for good BBQ.

He said \\"Try them - I think you'll like them.\\"  I take a tentative bite of a cucumber corner... and am very pleasantly surprised.

I expected a behemoth, but Estelle's doesn't want you to go home uncomfortable, and I appreciated that.  Four generous but not huge pieces of white fish in a great batter, over hand cut fries, served with cole slaw and a mustard dipping sauce.  We split the corn bread and fried pickles (well, split as in, I had a small slice of cornbread and husband ate it all).  The bread, especially with the maple butter, was DIVINE.  I was almost angry that I didn't get more of it.

She obviously has a rapport with all her customers. There was a couple there with a young son.  The husband told us they have been going to Bangkok Thai since their first date. Awww! It started pouring at some point during the meal and she offered to walk the family out to their car with an umbrella. She offered the same to us when it was time leave.\\n\\nRemembering the lack of spice from our last visit, the bf opted for \\"Thai hot\\" Chicken Pad Thai and I did the same for the Drunken Noodles. Oh my god... Thai hot is a whole 'nother level. Can't there be something in between Thai hot and medium hot?! I learned my lesson... just stick with medium hot next time and ask for extra chili. \\n\\nFor some reason, the Drunken Noodles were a LOT hotter than the Pad Thai. Perhaps the sweetness of the Pad Thai offset the hotness a bit. We ended up trading dishes even though I thought the Drunken Noodles were pretty delicious. They had a bit too much sauce for my taste (I've never had Drunken Noodles before so I'm not sure how saucy they are supposed to be) so I asked for a bowl of rice to go with it. \\n\\nWe also ended up ordering Thai tea to cool the burning in our mouths. My bf loves Thai tea and kept raving that this was the best Thai tea he has ever had. I'll take his word for it. I've only had Thai tea at Tin Drum and Bangkok Thai and I will say Bangkok Thai's is a lot better. The glasses are smaller so they charge less for the tea than at other places -- $1.75 a glass.\\n\\nThis will be my go-to place for reasonably priced and tasty Thai food."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I've tried many Cuban food around the world...

I could take the easy route and just say it this restaurant is incredible, groundbreaking, and sets the bar like no other restaurant I've been to, and this would suffice.  \\n\\nThis place is so amazing I am almost speechless..and a bit overwhelmed because I want to go into extreme detail about everything..but not this review.  I'll save that one for the next time around.  \\n\\nThe service was wonderful.  All of the waiters were knowledgeable, friendly, polite and encouraging of questions.  They all made sure to let us know that they would accommodate us in any way they could - from the drinks to the actual food, and they did.\\n\\nThe menu is incredible.  As a vegetarian, it was one of the few times that I actually regretted not eating meat because I felt as though I was seriously missing out.  Every plate that was brought to us not only looked perfect, but tasted perfect.  Even though we didn't really eat a lot of food or drink a lot, we were still treated like favored patrons, and were given not 1, or 2 or 3 but 4 complimentary dishes.  One of the complimentary dishes given to us was raw tuna, and one of my friends is pregnant, and I am a vegetarian, and they were so gracious about taking them back - and bringing out yet another complimentary dish that was vegetarian, and so delicious that I couldn't help but savor every single bite.  \\n\\nWe sat at a spot that gave us a direct view of the open kitchen.  We were literally sitting a few feet away from where the kitchen staff performed something akin st synchronized swimming.  There are some folks that when they go out to eat, prefer to not see their food being made because it takes away from their appetite, but me? Watching these men and women at work...the accuracy and dedication that went into each dish being prepared, made me want to taste everything they were making.\\n\\nI have not had a dining experience like this in so long...I plan to go back and spend half a weeks paycheck in one sitting.\\n\\nI can't stress enough how incredibly wonderful the staff is at this place.  EVERYONE seemed to be in tune with each other, but more importantly in tune with the diners.  \\n\\nCraigie is worth every cent spent...and more.  And though my next statement has nothing to do with food, it added to my atmosphere - there were two chefs who were very hot, one who I kind of couldn't stop looking at (heh)...and watching them making this food that could be considered art, made my dining experience that much better.\\n\\nI never thought I would find a place where I was happy with everything...but I have found that place with Craigie on Main...and I am already planning my next visit, where I will have the full vegetarian meal, and as many of their amazing cocktails as I can stomach.\\n\\nIt is pricey, but I can honestly say that here, you get what you pay for...which is excellence created by passionate people who are good at what they do and work hard at it.\\n\\nI highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an all around incredible dining experience, and if you are lucky to sit by the open kitchen, I suggest you take the seats...because it is a show worth watching...even though the performers are not really performing (they are only focused on what they are doing, not who is watching), but creating meals that please all of the senses.\\n\\nSimply put? I am in love with this place and plan on going there any and every chance I get."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a pretty chill place to take a friend, or meet up with someone for the first time and gab about random things while drinking a strong, overpriced cappuccino.

Our waitress was very pleasant and took our drink orders promptly. The menu at first blush is pretty interesting. A varying menu gives the diner a lot of \\"create-your-own\\" options. One can choose the \\"Trio\\" of small plates, 3 for about $18. You can also do the mix-n-match with a protein/preparation/side entree. Interesting to include not only tofu but egg for a dinner protein option. \\n\\nThere is also sashimi and sushi - half a dozen promising options to choose from. Inside-out style (rice on the outside). \\n\\nUnfortunately from the time we ordered until we got our food, 45min plus. The waitress told us at one point the kitchen was behind.

The fish was decent and the sides well done. \\n\\nI went with the \\"Trio\\" with Carrot Sriracha Hummus, Firecracker Shrimp, and Spring Rolls.

The Spring Rolls however were quite tasty. Crispy outside with a nice vinegar based dipping sauce.   The \\"Trio\\" is served in a goofy tower like you get at a high-tea, one plate per level. Incredibly awkward at a three-top table.

I didn't have a chance to say anything about my plate yet. But then that waiter, without giving me the bill, came to clean my table. Before I could say anything to him, he already put another dish on my food. So later after paying the bill, I told the waitress who served my table about this, hope that she could realize their service really make customers feel very uncomfortable. Unexpectedly, she told me that she could ask them to make another plate for me. Therefore I waited for an extra 10 minutes. While I was sitting and waiting for my food, the waiter (who threw my plate) came to say sorry. He said, \\"I'm so sorry about that, but because you didn't say anything so I didn't know it.\\" (So he came to say sorry but still blamed it on me when he knew I couldn't had said it because he had been far away?) At the end, after the extra time waiting, I received my togo box, which was much smaller than I expected, because I knew the leftover in my plate couldn't fit in that box. After I went outside and checked the box, it was a slice of smoked fish inside(???)

I went for the Taganino (rhymes with Menino) and not exactly as described in the menu. Somebody forgot the crostini.  I kept eating; kept doing my best to get to the bottom; but there was no bread at the bottom of the delicious little necks and mussels.  The sauce was described as spicey by not so.  One diner, Auntie, enjoyed the Rollatini (eggplant perfectly rolled and the most wonderful of all textures and taste.)

Also, the first waitress didn't explain that the paella takes 45 min to prepare! (Um yeah that would have been nice to know!) As we were about to cancel that order the owner came and personally served us! He saved the night. I will definitely be back!!!!

I missed out on their dinner reservations a few months ago when they booked up until March and closed down reservations until then. I couldn't do the walk-in because I was usually working during their open hours. I was finally able to take a day off of work on Wednesday and visit them. Wednesday around 3pm, not busy at all, luckily. My husband and I found two seats in their little counter top. Once you walk through the cloth curtains and sit on their stools, it's like entering a little stall in Japan. I don't know how they fit so much stuff in such a tiny space and make it feel home-y and comfortable. I loved it!\\n\\nI had no idea what to order but I was fortunate enough to spontaneously pick out the Sushi Omakase. My husband ordered the Hamachi sushi. We also ordered a small bottle of sparkling sake imported from Japan (to celebrate finally visiting Kappo). I was informed that the chef would serve me each sushi piece one by one as he makes it and places it on my wooden board. I was to eat it with my hands and given a moist towlette to clean my hands with as needed. My husband was served his 5 pcs as soon as they were all ready and arranged on his plate, he loved his Hamachi, very delicious and perfect. However, he was way more jealous of my meal.\\n\\nI had 10 pieces of sushi, it was whatever the chef decided to serve me and it was perfect. I had a lot of new things that I had never tried. The most notable were the West and East coast uni. West coast was definitely much better but it was interesting to try both out and compare. I also had seared Salmon belly which was amazing. There was even a small quail egg involved in one of my sushi pieces. Each one was amazing and delicious in its own right.\\n\\nWith my omakase, I also received a soup of the day and a small dessert to cap it all off. Both just as wonderful and delicious as the sushi meal itself. It was a unique and wonderful dining experience. Probably one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. The chef was awesome, he conversed and was so friendly, almost felt like an old friend the way he made you feel so comfortable. He even gave us an extra sushi piece so my husband could try since he was jealous that he didn't spring for the omakase himself.\\n\\nKappo is truly special and unique. An experience to be treasured."},{"name":"Little Big Burger","address":"3810 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We live in the neighborhood and have been weekly regulars since opening.

They were crunchy, meaty and the sauce was a perfect combination of spicy and sweet.  My children split the kids' steak entree and the mac and cheese.  I tried a bite of each and everything was good- especially the mac and cheese.  We were too full for dessert.\\n\\nAside from the food, the entertainment was great- loud (that's to be expected), but not offensively so.

I had gone in a few weeks ago to say welcome to the neighborhood and Ashley let me look around. It was good spot for a private function with the upstairs and the main floor as well.  So yesterday 8/26 was my first time having a meal. I like a simple menu and this one was very simple. It was a little confusing why the fish sandwich and the lunch fish & chips both come with the exact same sides except the sandwich has bread both cost $10.00. According to the lunch fish & chips it was supposed to come with a special cut fries (can't remember the exact wording) but when our meals came out, (my friend ordered the jerk chicken panini) we both had the same fries. \\n\\nOk, so the gentlemen who is our waiter does not introduce himself. My friend wanted to see the upstairs and I guess asked him if it was okay while I was in the restroom. She went to look around once our order was placed. When she came back she told me he was the owner. Oh, I said, it's good to see an owner working his business. So he comes back over and asked her if she had any questions about what she saw. She did because she is looking for a place to have a birthday party. He explained how it would work and so on. I asked for his name and gave him mine and we shook hands. \\n\\nWhen our food was done Chris brought it over to us. He said to me, I had the another piece of fish to be thrown in the fryer for you because this piece is just too small. I will bring it out when its ready. \\n\\nI appreciated it that and was glad the owner had witnessed it to make a correction. My immediate thought was, \\"this is acceptable to the cook? is this really okay?\\"  Then I tasted my french fries and they tasted as if they had been sitting for too long. My friend said hers were fine. So I tasted the tartar sauce which really wasn't tartar sauce as we know it to be. It had a much different spin on it which included corn. However it was tasty by itself but added nothing to the fish and the grease on the fish took away the flavor the sauce had on its own (I had never experienced anything like that). \\n\\nThere was a dollop of coleslaw on my plate. Nothing remotely close to being a serving since it was considered a side. \\n\\n-When the fish was ready, Chris brought it over. It was pipping hot. I let it sit on its plate until I was ready for it. Once I was ready, I added it from my plate and there was a pool of grease on the plate (I should have taken a picture). That pool of grease explained why my fries where like they had been soaked in grease and my friends were not. My first piece of fish was placed on top of my fries and unlike the second piece of fish that was solo, my fries absorbed the grease.  So its safe to say there is no draining of the grease for fish, it just straight out of the hot grease onto a plate to be served (or maybe it was just mine).  \\n\\nOverall, I would go back just to see if Chris is in this for the long haul or just trying his luck at something. \\nThe space is great. The restroom was clean and I appreciate that. It is probably good for drinking a few but I can't be sure about that so do not quote me on it since I have not had any cocktails there.  \\n\\nAfter reading some of the reviews here, its not just me. \\n\\nI would suggest to Chris to figure out what is going on in the kitchen. If you had not been there to say the first fish was unacceptable, who would have? Why was it acceptable to your chef?

I've been on a diet so I allowed myself this as a cheat for the week and let's just say I was pretty depressed when I got my meal. The chicken seemed overcooked on the outside but raw in the middle. The waffle was bland and the syrup tasted like it had hot sauce in it (the syrup was actually pretty good). Nothing at all the way chicken and waffles should taste. It felt like they were trying to make a tradition, homestyle dish into something culinary and failed miserably at it. I would have sent it back, but the waitress was no where to be found. My friend got the stuffed French toast, which turned out to be more of a sandwich that actual stuffed toast. She said it was decent, but nothing special.

More so for the BBQ than the flowers. The road is isolated and beautiful in the sense that you never know what you'll find (hello Hindu temple). It reminds me of driving around Napa on the Silverado Trail.\\n\\nBut the BBQ is delicious. The only other BBQ place I went to in Austin was Iron Works, and Salt Lick is miles better. Their habanero BBQ sauce is terrific, as is the original, which is a bit sweet and tart. The BF  got the unlimited brisket, ribs, sausage for $14.95, which is a terrific deal if you can pack away that much food. I stuck with a plate of brisket and ribs, which was already too much for me that I had leftovers. Sadly, I stuck it in our hotel fridge and forgot to take it with me to the airport. So there's a surprise for the next occupants.\\n\\nThe food matches the d√©cor and you can't help but feel like you're intruding on someone's home when you're there.

It's been a few months since we last ate there, however, tonight, within minutes of walking in, we could tell something was different, wrong. There was a formality that was NOT the norm in the past. I was hard pressed not to ask our waiter where our regular bar tender was. We were told she was \\"let go\\" a few weeks ago. \\"It happens \\" he said. Later in the meal, it was obvious this was not the same Village Wines we'd grown to love. The service was stiff, slow. The formality of the restaurant erased the reason we loved the place so much.  Villages Wines had always been a high end restaurant that didn't feel stuffy, stiff, and formal. This new Village Wines was nothing like the one we'd grown to love. The mystic of Village Wines is that it was an excellent restaurant without the pompous atmosphere. Those of us that are familiar with fine dining appreciated being able to eat in a high end restaurant without having to dress up.  I hope the new owners read this review. Canal Winchester has many people that can afford the price of a high end restaurant. They just don't want to feel like their going to one.

My wife and I were excited there was a sushi restaurant opening locally. I lived in southeast Florida where  sushi is much more prevalent than here. I ate it 2-3 times a week, everything from high end, elegant and overpriced to basic and simple.\\n\\nBefore the negative I'd like to point out they did a nice job with the interior, it 's simple and quaint. Now the rest of the story- we ordered basic sushi fare; salads (fine), steamed pork dumplings (fine a bit cold) a spicy tuna roll and carpaccio roll. Spicy tuna rolls are basic. I took one bite and knew immediately it wasn't fresh.This was not subtle, it was apparent there was a problem. The tuna on top of the Carpaccio Roll was light in color and looked stringy. I forced a piece but was simply afraid to eat anything else. You can make mistakes with average food, with sushi, it's a different ball game. \\n\\nI assume this is privately owned and any normal person wants to see them succeed so this isn't easy for me. When our server asked how it was, I commented that something wasn't quite right in the spicy tuna roll. I didn't want to come out and say 'your tuna is not fresh' (trust me, it wasn't). She responded how it was the 'spice' and lectured me how spicy rolls taste and how that should be expected. I  also heard her telling another waitress. Needless to say we didn't have one more piece of that roll. My  wife had couple more of the other but I was done. It was left on the plate and they never offered to take it off the bill.  Lecturing someone is not a great way to start or run a business. You should have seen the look on her face when we actually stuck with the chopsticks and refused her offer for forks. The whole experience was a complete insult. Who names a place Sake and doesn't have a liquor license?\\n\\nBottom line; Their tuna of all things wasn't fresh and the way things were handled was not professsional.

Multiple times, our waitress (who walked away after 3/4 of us had ordered a drink and had to be chased down because she couldn't hear us yelling, \\"excuse me!\\") was standing in the corner, spacing out. I can totally understand if she's busy and running around, but seeing her standing in the corner with her hands on her hips really frustrates me. One member of our group wanted to leave her less than 10%, which didn't happen but she didn't really earn what we did leave her.\\n\\nThe food was ok. I ordered a special, which was a crab salad. It was fine but they didn't really put any dressing on it, and I couldn't find the waitress to ask for more until the check came. Two friends got the trout, which had a toasted-coconut-cilantro sauce, but both of them said it was boring and nondescript. The fourth had the nachos, which were good, but then again they were nachos. Sadly, the best part of the meal WAS the pita. \\n\\nI wouldn't say that I would NEVER come back. I have heard they have good brunch, and I wouldn't be opposed to it, but I would make sure I didn't have pressing, time sensitive plans right after."},{"name":"Pizzeria La Sorrentina","address":"3000 SE 164th Ave, Ste 107","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Reopened on 11/20 after the unfortunate fire.

No.  I've gone to Tartine twice now and though the food was decent both times, there's no way I can justify the price in my mind.  $15 for a slice of quiche, $15 for a tartine (an open-faced sandwich).  When you break it down, and I'll even use organic food prices (which Tartine is not), we're talking two slices of bread (tops, $1.00), a cup of salad (again, tops $1.00), garnish ($1.00) and some variety of thinly-applied spread (really splurging at $3.00).  So maximum we're talking $6.00 for an open-faced sandwich that Tartine will charge $15.00 for which, even if the tip is included, is still a steep price for Beverly.  Even if the food was stellar, everything on the menu could be easily replicated at home, which is something I don't want from a dining out experience.  The lights are even so bright that you can't so much as justify the experience by hanging out with a drink.

The pizza we ordered was not \\"droopy\\" this time were very tasty! We went on a busy Friday night and the atmosphere was totally different and we loved that it's BYOB. We met the owner and his son and definitely have a different perspective of this place now.\\n\\nOld review:\\nToday I went to Antico Pizza for lunch with three of my coworkers. We got there right as it opened since we heard it can get very busy. We ordered right away and sat down at one of the few tables. They gave us cups for water and we asked where we could get water and they pointed to a sink. Kinda weird getting your water from a sink. There were no soda machines or ice.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was pretty unique. It felt like you were literally in the kitchen where they were preparing food. You can sit at the tables and watch as the make the pizza. Pretty neat!\\n\\nAbout 5 minutes after we ordered, our first pizza was brought to the table. It was a Bianca Pizza - all white with a couple different cheeses. Our second pizza came a couple minutes later, a Margherita Pizza.\\n\\nBoth of the pizzas had good tasting, fresh ingredients (sauce, cheese, dough. basil), however, I did not like the texture. My favorite pizza is NY style pizza, the kind where it's thin, crusty and you can hold it up in your hand and take bites. This pizza was one of the most soggy I have ever had. There was so much moisture that came out of the tomatoes and cheese that there was literally liquid falling off my pizza into a pool on my napkin. Yes, I said napkin because they don't have plates there. It was a drippy, watery, gooey mess and I needed a handful of paper towels to dry it up.\\n\\nI will say again that the ingredients did taste fresh but overall I did not enjoy the food. I also think it's overpriced. It was about $10 per person for an equivalent of maybe 2 NY style pieces of pizza and they do not provide you with what you'd expect in a restaurant - plates, napkins, ice, etc. A lot of people do love it, so try it out for yourself."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"UPDATE: Changing my original 4 star review to 5 stars because Flour took my advice and added egg sandwiches to their menu and they are really freaking good! \\n\\n*************************************************************************\\nI am really glad this place opened up near my second home (my boyfriend's neighborhood).

I found the lighting a little dark, but that's because I like to read while eating lunch.  I think my lunch set me back about $9.75 including a 16 oz. bottle of diet coke.

If I'm looking for slices, Pino's would win out.  While I find their whole pizza's a little inconsistant, they always seem to get the slices just right.  When they are on their game, what sets them apart from Presto is how flavorful their pizza is.  Its got a lot of character and is more than your usual slice.  Boston can't quite compare with New Haven or New York pizza on getting the basic formula to greasy perfection, but when they try for something just a little different the results can be very satisfying.\\n\\nConan O'Brien apparently loves Pino's and stops here whenever he's home from New York.

In the ongoing dumbing down of ethnic foods Chipotle takes its place right next to Olive Garden. It is the \\"Wonder Bread\\" of tex-mex food. By which I mean it is bland, tasteless and devoid of nutritional value. OK, maybe it has nutritional value but it definitely has no flavor. \\nI tried a barbacoa burrito. I was informed by the menu that the barbacoa is specially spiced and marinated beef of the highest quality. If they were going for the flavor and consistency of cardboard then they got it right. The cilantro in the salsa was non-existent and the only consistent taste I got from my burrito was that of the beans and the tomatoes in the salsa. I asked for guacamole but for all the flavor it added I might just as well have asked for green school paste. This is easily one of the worst burritos I have had in recent memory. I think the only way I would choose to eat a burrito from Chipotle was if someone was offering me one from Taco Bell but that choice isn't a no-brainer.\\nIn an area like Davis Sq. with two other clearly better options in Anna's and Boloco it will be interesting to see if \\"Wonder Bread\\" is still on the Davis Sq. menu in a year or so.

But alas, Yelpers some how convinced my BF and I to try Giacomo's...Even so, I tried to get around the lines by planning on getting there right at opening time...but as all plans born in the midst of a mini vacation, we didn't get there at 5...instead, we got there at 7...on a Saturday night....when the line wrapped around the corner...and people in line in front of us was \\"snacking\\" on take out fries and pastries from another place!  I knew we were in trouble!  Thanks to my BF, whose patience made up for my lack there of, we got in line and waited....and waited....and finally after 1.5 hours, we were rewarded with some of the best pasta and cheapest good wine we've ever had!  \\n\\nSo the restaurant itself was really really crowded because it's tiny!  Service was incredibly fast and friendly.  The majority of the pasta is served with a choice of 5 sauces: pesto, red (lobster base), fra diavolo (lobster base spicy red), Giacomo's (lobster base with a splash of cream~almost like a vodka sauce), or white (wine, olive oil, garlic).  So we started with the mussels appetizer in Giacomo's sauce--I'm not a fan of mussels, but they were perfectly cooked to just open so the meat is tender and the sauce is very flavorful.  We started with a bottle of the house Sauvignon Blanc which was an incredible value at $16/bottle and it was actually decent.  I ordered the special lobster and shrimp with homemade fussilli in fra diavolo and it was amazing for $25.  It had huge lumps of lobster meat and many big succulent shrimp.  The pasta was perfectly al dente.  I talked my BF into ordering the butternut squash ravioli which was served with diced asparagus and prosciutto in a cheesy cream sauce.  Also amazingly good and at the unbelievable price of $16 or $18.  Everything also came out very fast and the servings are enormous!  I could only finish half of mine...and my BF helped with the rest but still not all finished.  We also had a second bottle of wine, this time we had the Santa Margherita Pinot Grigio, which is our favorite Pinot Grigio for the price range (and at Giacomo's the mark up was minimal to only $36/bottle).  \\n\\nSo for our entirely satisfying meal of very flavorful food and definite splurge on the wine (two bottles for two people!!) we walked away only having spent $120 including tax and tips.

Their lobster ravioli is so good as well as their antipasto display.  Service is great, they are fast paced however super friendly and welcoming.  \\n\\nThe way that menu is set up is you have your choices of pasta with seafood, chicken, veal, etc.  Then you can choose alfredo, giacomo, fra diavlo, red sauce, etc.  This is great for picky eaters and it's a great way to get people back to try different combos.

Daily. We coat it in our special light batter, a family secret for generations.\\n        * Out potato-chips are natural and fresh-cut. The way fries (chips) started out.\\n        * We cook our ingredients in only the purest of oils, to serve up what we believe to be the very best fish & chips you can buy.\\n        * Our food is cooked almost to-order, the way it should be. It may take a few moments longer, but we believe it is well worth the wait.\\n        * We bake our famous Dublin-style pies from scratch daily.\\n        * And we serve up our unique \\"doh-bars\\" -- melted candy bars covered in our secret dough. You won't find them anywhere else!\\n\\nI was certainly impressed with Cookes of Dublin's claims and its menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9RPUAPjj7vJf7bGovoF2OA?select=3QToqL4rLR8cJA1js6V9qg).\\n\\nSince Cookes of Dublin's specialty is their fish & chips, I had to go with that as my order.\\n\\nWhile I waited, I took a couple snapshots of the seating areas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9RPUAPjj7vJf7bGovoF2OA?select=mWqwz9ulTmeIpeN4_Hox0Q).

I had a great visit - happy hour on a Friday with my best friends.  We sat at the bar and had a blast - drinking and eating and enjoying our bar service.  The ambiance is clean and bright, filled with lots of young folk and cheer.  The food was delicious - whatever we ate came with much attention paid to presentation - think it was a ceviche, a chicken skewer app, and quesadilla.  All delicious.  It was good pricing due to the happy hour - I would probably only go back for the happy hour prices.\\n\\nHere's the dilemma.  This bar is supposedly representing a caribbean island called Saba.  It in no way represents that island.  Have the people been there?  Do they even know where it is or what it's all about.  I would say NOT A CHANCE.  Hell, my family is from Saba, many of them still live there.  Saba is a very very very small island not included on most maps - well known to scuba divers and not much else.  It's only about 1200 in population, think a large high school size population.  The drink menu on Saba includes Red Stripe and Heineken.  Not found on the menu at Saba Blue Water Cafe.  Also the delicacy on a good day is fresh fish, maybe lobster.  You'd be lucky to get even that.  We mostly eat pizza and goat curry when we visit.  I'm not kidding I was there last year.  Saba Blue Water Cafe and their advertised Saban specialties are a farce, but delicious.  They should change their name or admit they are pulling a fast one.  Or maybe their smoke and mirrors will boost tourism to Saba - which I approve.  \\nOtherwise good for groups, dates, and fun.

But then, the manager came over and apologized, offered them another entree to try instead, and even sent over a free dessert. I thought this spoke volumes about the quality of customer care.

If you don't know them yet---you should. They are the All Asia Bar co-owners and wonderful people through and through. All Asia experienced its 10 year anniversary this year. I came first along in 2006, having been introduced to its existence and the music scene that has thrived here by Karina Dacosta, then-lead vocals and bass player for 28 Degrees Taurus.\\n\\nI was brought here to witness the legendary All Asia Open Mic, which has been hosted by Brian Murphy, lead singer and guitar player of the Shills; a multi-intrumentalist, music teacher and selfless central figure in Boston's Indie Rock scene. What I found upon first witness was a home.\\n\\nThe set-up is perfect and comfortable. On the left hand upon entry you have the exalted pool table, where Sixes teach Threes how to become Fives. On the right hand you have a very slightly elevated stage, and its here the best and the brightest of our time come and regale us with their thoughts and emotions. These folk play all over Boston, up and down the seaboard and stretch out past the Mississippi sometimes. Yet they all know to come here. Dead center upon entry is the bar, and its bartenders must be the reincarnation of the very monks who invented the drinks they are pouring---you'll know what I mean when you meet them.\\n\\nCan't say I know what the lady's room looks like, but the men's room has stickers all over it marking the presence of hundreds of great acts that have traveled through over the years---major acts of the Boston output. Band members playing here both past and present have been from the following acts:\\n\\nThis Car Up, The Shills, 28 Degrees Taurus, Thrushes, Justin Shorey, Shoney Lamar, Ellis Ashbrook, The Governors, Quiet Loudly, Gunfight!, OTP, Kayla Daly, The Soundscapes, Audrey Ryan, Hot Box, Sanguine Drone, Amoroso, Caspian, Sophie Innerfield, Fly Upright Kite, Ends of the Earth. And then there's the hundreds of bands and thousands of songs I discovered through the networks these bands course through. Its been wonderful for me---the same is available for you.\\n\\nNow as for that Open Mic:\\n\\nI have seen the greatest minds of my generation at this Open Mic, five years worth and by my measurement two epochs of Boston Indie music and the friends they drew in from the outer rings. At open mic, the singers and song writers either step out from the surety of their band's acts to become vulnerable again and test out new material or to play long familiar and heart warming favorites, however they like. It usually starts at 10pm and goes on till the thing has to end, two songs each (or for non-musicians, less than 10 minutes). On a typical open mic, you'll witness 20 acts.\\n\\nAs for the non-music act---it always has been a tricky measure to get up there without accompaniment from some kind of instrument. Over the years a few comics have come and gone. In the past year however, a new comic troupe has emerged that is worthy of note. They originate from the crew who gathers at Rodney's Bookstore and of this clan, Mr. Goodnight is the most undoubted.They're bad-ass all, and certainly will not hesitate to make good fun of you for pointing this out to them. Anyway, if you want a laugh, you can have that too, on top of everything else this place has to offer.\\n\\nIf its your first time, then your entire universe will be inverted and you may just find yourself completely illuminated. All other times, you'll enjoy the warm embrace of good friends, warmed by whiskey, beer, pool, music and entertainment, good conversation just outside over a cigarette, and courtly treatment from the staff and owners.\\n\\nI believe its true All Asia will be closing soon and giving way to the birth of The Valhalla, Marc and Patty's newest brainchild---which will be 4 times as large, include 2 live stages, outdoor seating, a day-and-night food menu, parking and a major-primo location just at the corner of Mass Ave and Prospect St. This won't happen until after the New Year though---so you have a few months left to come in and see for yourself where it all began.\\n\\nCome on in Pilgrim, you've traveled long enough---time to see the lights of the Holy Land.\\n\\n(Marc, please bring the Foosball table back---we're in the homestretch, let's wind it down right!)"},{"name":"Alborz Persian Cuisine","address":"3300 W Anderson Ln, Ste 300","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Last time went to Alborz was nearly 15 years ago.

You generally need to fold these slices or the toppings won't stay on well.  The ingredients are still great quality, and IMO Antico still makes one of the best Neapolitan style pizzas you can get in the city.  It has changed my mind on Neapolitan style pizza.

He eventually said screw this and walked out. I continued to wait another 5 min again. With no one paying any attention to me. Eventually what I think was the manager or shift leader yelled at one of the employees and said \\"hey, who's suppose to be working the front line, we have customers leaving.\\" This young lady eventually turned around and began to finally take my order. I specifically said. I want the king jr kids meal with the cheeseburger. She didn't know what I was talking about apparently because she replied with, \\"do you mean the 2 for 5 deal we have?\\" Again I replied no. I want your king jr kids meal with the cheeseburger. She eventually had to step back and look up at the menu herself so I could point to it and read it to her. The employees themselves don't even know what's on their menu.

Consistent with what other reviewers have reported, my recent experience at The Cup can best be summarized as \\"edible, but forgettable'. They also receive the distinction of serving one of the worst white hot chocolates that I've ever ingested- a feat that takes some effort considering that the drink only has two ingredients. Most reviewers appear to be consistent in their complaints, so I'm baffled as to why the management hasn't processed the fact that there's a problem. \\n\\nFood: The Cup serves approximately 15 different cupcake flavors, including gluten-free and vegan options. They also offer a variety of other baked goods, including cakes, cookies, and cheesecakes. I opted for the Ciroc red berry cupcake and a white hot chocolate - I also ordered a slice of the carrot cake to take home. Although the cupcake was aesthetically pleasing, the cake portion was virtually flavorless. The carrot cake was equally as underwhelming - complete with random mushy pineapple chunks in the filling. The coup de grace was the white hot chocolate. There wasn't even a hint of white chocolate - it was essentially just a cup of steamed white milk, which promptly found its way into the dumper after only two sips. \\n\\nService: There is no table service - all orders are placed at the front counter. Aside from the heinously disastrous food offerings, the girl working the counter was really quite nice. She took the time to describe each of the dessert offerings and was quick to prepare the drinks and pack-up the order.  \\n\\nAtmosphere: Quaint, clean, and tastefully decorated. In addition to a handful of tables, the cafe also has a hightop counter that looks out the front window. All cupcakes are displayed and clearly labeled in a glass case - additional desserts and baked goods are displayed on top of the counter. \\n\\nCost: Although the cupcake prices are consistent with most other places in the area ($2.50/each, $29/dozen), the price simply isn't commensurate with the experience or product quality. \\n\\nOther: The Cup is located in the Town Brookhaven Plaza. Hours of operation are Monday-Wednesday, 10AM-9PM, Thursday-Friday, 10AM-10PM, Saturday 9AM-10PM, and Sunday, 10AM-7PM. There is a $5 minimum on credit card purchases.

Bad service, no respect for the customers and a very rude manager. Terrible choice for eating.\\nWe went there for lunch on a Thursday, around 3pm. The place was empty, out of the many tables there was only one taken. We were looking for a table with shade, so we asked for a specific 4-seats table which was fully covered from the sun, since the place was empty and it was already past lunch hour. The waitress refused, and she sat us on a table that was partially hit by the sun.\\nSince it took them 10 minutes (!!) to come take the drinks order, we decided to move to a different adjacent table that seemed more covered by the tree above our heads. Again, we asked the waitress if there's any chance we could go to the fully covered table (under the umbrella). She refused again, even though we pointed out that the place was empty. Her ridiculous excuse was that it gets busier at that hour and they want to reserve the big table for more people. Well, it didn't get any busier until we left, the place was still empty 1 hour later. \\nAfter we were served the drinks, we decided to move again to a different table because the sun was allover our backs and it was impossible to eat under those conditions. This is where the whole situation became really bad. The manager comes out to the patio and tell us that we should stop switching tables. When we told him that we're trying to avoid the sun, since they are not giving us the table under the umbrella, he assertively told us that \\"you're sitting outside, there's sun\\". And then he THREATENED us by saying \\"last table, that's it!\\". That's it? THAT'S IT? This is unheard of.\\nThis is the way this place conducts its business, by pissing of their customers and not accommodating to their needs at no cost. The place was freaking empty, and these... people turned a perfectly normal situation into the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER, for absolutely no reason at all. Dear Mr. Manager, what would it have cost you to agree with us and let us sit where we want? Why did you have to come out and talk to your customers in such a bad and insulting manner? Is it because your overprices food is already bringing you enough money, that you don't really care if you lose a customer or two? Is that they way you run your business?\\nWell, I hope people read this review and be prepared for what they might face here.\\n\\np.s.1: we asked the waitress if their restaurant is on Yelp. She insulted our intelligence by replying that \\"she's not sure\\", for obvious reasons.\\np.s.2: as soon as we got into this whole situation, the waitress stopped serving us. She didn't come to ask if we wanted more drinks, or if the food was ok, or if we had any concerns. She dropped the food on our table and disappeared until we asked for the check.

My friends and I ordered the tasting menu and it was good overall but sorely lacked in some areas and there is definitely room for improvement...my gripes about the dinner are more with the servers perhaps than the chef.  The food is fantastic but my main entree was nowhere near hot when it arrived at the table and trust me, tepid mashed potatoes under a tepid chicken, even if it is fantastic chicken, is underwhelming.  The appetizer was the best part of the meal, the foie gras, and the dessert, the cheese plate, was an unsavory regrettable choice.

In short, it's weird and delicious. The main draw of the place is that you can get booze and sit down at a comfortable table with your K-tacos. The booze part especially is welcome, because the only improvement on a kimchi quesadilla I can imagine would be to drink it with a cold beer.

But it all works together and the entire diner eating experience just leaves you hypnotized and content, the perfect feeling for post-breakfast. They're one of the first restaurants open in the morning, and it's actually beautiful to watch the sky get brighter as the cars go by at 6:30am.\\n\\nService: I actually appreciate that our server wasn't bubbly and cheery at the early 7am. I'll surely be back to share what they're like later in the morning, but I don't anticipate any problems.\\n\\nFood:\\nBreakfast tacos - If you like pancakes and eggs together, this is down your alley. Just the most brilliant concept. Imagine a thin, spongy, flavorful pancake. The eggs are folded over instead of scrambled which makes them easier to eat. We substituted chicken sausage and found ourselves having a full breakfast spread that way that just sits great together in three \\"tacos.\\" I dream about this plate and wonder if I could come back here without ordering it.\\n\\nChicken and Waffles - Easy (though sticky) to eat with your hands or with a fork and knife. The fried chicken was conveniently crispy yet moist, thin yet in abundance. The waffle paired perfectly with it, not robbing too much flavor but adding the perfect amount of pillow around each bite. I was able to get the perfect ratio of chicken to waffle in every single bite down to the very last one. I do wish it came with a side or something on the empty half of the plate.\\n\\nIt's the kind of food you're still thinking about later in the day. The kind of plates you'd come back and order again. The kind of menu you want to explore more.\\n\\nParking/Environment: The expected Atlanta struggle when it comes to finding parking since there are only about three spots right out front. The diner chairs are fun and the tables are a perfect distance from each other to have your own private conversations but for the space to be used efficiently.

A little chaotic upon entry with disorganized line for ordering at the counter but moved rather quickly. I like the informality of this place like you've just pulled up a chair at a prep table in a pizza kitchen. The seating in the actual kitchen is a nice touch as you get a glimpse at the fresh dough being made, prep of pizzas, and large pizza ovens. In an age of so much premade food and detachment from it's preparation I think people enjoy being exposed to the overall process that goes into their food. Transparency being a key word. A look around at the shelves makes it apparent that most ingredients are imported from Italy and clearly much care taken into their selection.\\n\\nWent pretty straightforward with a Margherita pizza which was very tasty. Buffalo mozzarella perfectly melted. Good char flavor and the actual crust a bit chewier than expected. We also had a pizza with broccoli rabe and mushrooms on it. Again, great care shown for fresh ingredients and good execution. The imported peppers on the table give good flavor and a nice kick that made up for the lack of crushed dried pepper.\\n\\nEach pizza was around $16-18 and can feed 2 people which I think is pretty reasonable for the quality you receive in this food. Was quick and although they take what they do seriously it's a very unpretentious place. This is best displayed by the pizza arriving atop a metal tray with butcher paper on it - a nice informal touch!\\n\\nOn the way out I picked up 2 cannoli - pistacchio and walnut. Both were very good - filling was creamy, pastry had the right fresh crunch I wanted making this damn near perfect. I think I can put this on the regular stop list and may be a new craving . . .\\n\\nI highly suggest grabbing your pizza-lovin friends (who doesn't like pizza?) and checking this place out.\\n\\nOn a side note, one of my dining companions used to be in the baking supplies business and is pretty particular and critical of pizza dough/crust. He walked away very pleased and that counts for a lot in my book!

On the other hand, since I'm such a fan of Indian cuisine, if I were to hold them to my highest standards they'd probably only get 2 stars - so why not split the difference?\\n\\nI've never really been disappointed with Tandoor, but it still leaves me wishing we had some better Indian food options here in Portland.  The last time I went, we got there at the height of the downtown lunch rush - 12pm on a Tuesday - but found a table quickly.  They pack 'em in fairly tightly, so expect to bump and be bumped as everyone gets up to head to the buffet line.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, the line was quite long which seems to indicate that they've got the customers to survive even these \\"troubled economic times\\".  By the time we got to the buffet they were running woefully low on a number of items (rice, pakoras, naan, a few curries) - this ACTUALLY isn't a knock, as they were refilling things pretty quickly and appreciate that they seem to be constantly cooking and monitoring the trays, rather than just dumping a ton of food and letting it sit there for hours.\\n\\nWhile the all-you-can-eat buffet is not cheap ($9) and doesn't include any drink (except water), I love that they give you the option to save $2 by getting just a single plate - probably a good option for regulars who just want to load their plate with a couple of their favorite items.  They also have to-go boxes you can fill with pricing based on how many items you pick (I think it was $6 for 2 entrees and rice).\\n\\nI was thrilled to see they had Chicken Tikka Masala (which is not the most common buffet item), but that soon turned to mild disappointment once I got a good look at it - it was a little pale, looking more like a Makhani, and didn't have the little \\"extras\\" that I love like cilantro and onions.  It was tasty, and it did have actual grilled chicken tika (rather than just chopped bits of tandoori chicken, but the masala was just not quite up to snuff.\\n\\nThe number of items was not overwhelming, but the variety was quite good.  I tried almost everything and everything tasted pretty good; I've long since learned to accept that no lunch buffet will ever really kick the spice level to where I'd like it, and I would definitely call this stuff mild, but it was at least flavorful.\\n\\nThe lamb curry was a little thin but still quite nice, with tender bite-sized bits of lamb and plenty of potatoes.  I really have to stop and give them props here for not mis-advertising their lamb curry as \\"vindaloo\\" like they do at so many other Indian buffets.\\n\\nThe Chana Masala was also a standout, with nicely cooked, firm chick peas - I hate it when they're all mushy.  Other than that they had a decent Paneer Saag, and a couple more vegetarian curries.\\n\\nWhile the entrees are the heart of any buffet, it's the sides and appetizers that can really set a place apart.  Tandoor scored points with me by having garlic AND plain naan, both of which were fresh, soft, and chewy.\\n\\nI was also pleasantly surprised by the onion and jalapeno pakoras; for some reason I don't really associate jalapeno peppers with Indian cuisine, and the few times I've had them it was not executed well - but these were delicious!  But I was bummed that they didn't offer ANY chutneys at all.  Those pakoras would have been perfectly complimented by a sweet and tangy tamarind chutney.\\n\\nThe service was pretty no frills, but this IS a buffet so all I really want is for them to keep my water full and clear the plates from the table when I get up, so I really don't have any complaints.\\n\\nI definitely recommend those jonesing for some quality Indian food to stop by and give the buffet at Tandoor a try, especially if you work downtown.  I don't know if I'd go out of my way (and pay for parking) just to come here for lunch if you're not already in the neighborhood, but I get the feeling that the chefs here are skilled enough that Tandoor might be even better - maybe 4-star worthy - when you order off the menu for dinner...a theory I hope to test soon!"},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Breakfast egg sandwich was the best I think I've ever had!

However; my husband, a few of our friends, and myself decided to try it for brunch on Sunday, for the first time. We were served by Caitlin, blonde and average height, she was nothing but unprofessional and rude the entire time. She also spent more time at the servers stand, by the bar, talking to a female bartender and flirting with the male bartenders and male patrons, than she did checking on her tables. Her service alone is enough for my family and several of my friends to never return. If they allow their wait staff to be so rude and incompetent this is not a place I can see myself visiting or suggesting to people. To allow your wait staff to seemingly disappear from one table to canoodle and fraternize with young men at another table, is complete madness. She hardly smiled or checked in with us, we did not feel welcome. When she took out order, the light was on but nobody was home. Our table went uncleared for quite sometime.

Bottom line- total disappointment and not worth it.  \\n\\nThe food is good, don't get me wrong; it just will not blow you out of the water.  There were a lot of fish preparations, e.g. kampachi w/ citrus vinaigrette and mustard seeds and pine nuts.  You can tell they're using fresh ingredients, but they dishes don't always come together well-- more like discrete fresh ingredients on the same plate.  I'll admit that the desserts are amazing: chocolate coffee semifreddo and lemon custard beignets, respectively.\\n\\nWhat was really disappointing, though, was the service.  It look amount 10 minutes after being seated to even be greeted by our waiter.  And each course is brought out by a different set of waiters who tell you about the dish-- gives the place a really chaotic feeling and a lack of personal attention.  We had to re-ask one of our waiters for extra bread, 10 minutes after he said he'd bring it out.

We came back to the hotel the next afternoon and they were not fixed! We asked the front desk again and they said they'd fix it that night.

Unfortunately, I have to side with the minority and consider this place much over-hyped. \\n\\nI hadn't eaten much the day I visited, so I went for the Mega Ramen, as many have heralded about. First the really bad: the broth. It was starchy/clumpy and tasteless. There was NO flavor to the broth and needed salt in the worst way. \\n\\nThe bowl contained three types of pork: thinner cuts of pork belly ubiquitous at other ramen spots, a shredded pork (kinda like pulled and chopped pork), and chunks of pork shoulder (or I thought was shoulder). The pork belly cuts were acceptable, but nothing special. The shredded pork was the most flavorful of the three pork types and had good texture. Lastly, the chunks of pork were dry and bland. \\n\\nThe noodles themselves were passable, as there was a decent amount of chewy texture to them. However, given the competition of ramen proliferating these days, Totto's offering of ramen noodles is now standard and nothing spectacular. \\n\\nYes, there is a lot of pork in the Mega Ramen, but with the premium I paid ($15.50) for that bowl, I expected that. There isn't much in terms of garnish with the Mega (like no egg, corn, etc.), so the fact that the pork choices were a mixed bag was further highlighted by the lack of other components to the ramen bowl. You have to pay extra for those.\\n\\nService was fine the entire time. Water was provided periodically and the waitress was polite. Sometimes I do expect cash only in places, but with this one, charging higher for ramen...don't be a turd and start accepting plastic.\\n\\nMaybe I caught an aberration here or this place is indeed overrated.

I like it OK, but I'm perfectly fine with only eating it once or twice a year.  Confession #2: When I do eat barbecue, I prefer Memphis style.  (Obviously, I'm not from Texas.)  That said, tonight's supper at The Salt Lick was among the best BBQ meals I've ever eaten.\\n\\nI had been meaning to go to The Salt Lick since I first moved to Austin two years ago, but I had mistakenly believed that you had to eat family style.  It's not very often that I'm in the mood for meat gluttony, especially when it requires driving out of town.  But since I'm moving next week, I decided I needed to get down there before I left Texas.  I had eaten the beef brisket sandwich at ACL Fest before, but that had not prepared me for what eating at the original location would be like.  Driving down the road, we smelled the restaurant before we saw it.  There's a shady patio where you can listen to live music and hang out while waiting for a table. \\n\\nOnce inside, we were greeted by tables and tables of meat being chopped and sliced.  We ordered off the menu (available after 4pm and on weekends), which allowed us to eat a (relatively) reasonable amount of food.  All three of us ordered combination plates, although I'm not a big fan of pork ribs so I only got the beef brisket and sausage.  I did try a bite of the ribs, though, and it tasted pretty good for what it was.  Still, I was much happier to have a little extra sausage and brisket instead.  Both meats were tender and flavorful on their own, and I didn't bother to add BBQ sauce.  But pairing the meat with pickles, onion slices and white bread created some sort of magical food alchemy.\\n\\nPotato salad and coleslaw don't exactly get my heart racing, but Salt Lick's versions are very impressive.  The mustard and onions in the potato salad gives it a nice kick without being too spicy.  The coleslaw is lightly dressed in oil and vinegar, which allows the taste of the cabbage to come through instead of drowning in mayo.  The beans were fine, but definitely the least memorable part of the meal.  All three of us were completely satisfied, not just with the food but with the whole experience of driving out to Driftwood and eating at a barbecue mecca.

Though you will probably need to wait longer at busier times, the food comes pretty quickly (within 10 minutes) once you place your order.

The wait to eat inside was super long, but there was no wait to eat outside on the patio. There was live music so it was loud, and they also had performances including Irish tap dancers.\\n\\nAfter reading yelp reviews I had to try the Irish soda bread with the guinness & sugar dipping sauce. It was interesting b/c not everyone was given this, so I'm not sure who they give the free bread to and who they don't. But when I asked for it the waitress said she would bring it over.

But it was definitely a heavy dish.\\n\\nMy friend had the chowda which I had a couple of tastes of. That was definitely delicious also and not too heavy. My other friend ordered the lamb which tasted good too. So overall all 3 dishes we ordered were all super yummy.\\n\\nWe shared 3 desserts. The apple strawberry crumble tasted like a typical crumble and it was actually really difficult to eat since everything was jammed into this mason jar. The presentation was nice but it was annoying to eat. We had a trifle which was light, I'm not a fan so I didnt like it. But my friends enjoyed it. Now my FAVORITE dessert was the bread pudding and I'm drooling just thinking about it. It's definitely very heavy, and it tasted like it was dipped in buttery then baked to make the top crunchy, which was so delicious to me. So if you dont like butter flavored things, definitely don't get the bread pudding. If you do, YOU MUST GET THE BREAD PUDDING.\\n\\nIf this restaurant was in my neighborhood at home, I'd definitely revisit.

Goat likes Sebadoh and Spoon. Torchy's rides a low rider bmx bike meant for 12 year olds but Torch is 29. Goat rides a fancy yet easy rider Peugeot.Torchy's drinks Lonestar or Tecate only. Goats more into Stella and Corona. Torchy's really fun to party with but tires easily. Goat talks about boring things sometimes, but is usually a pretty reliable time.\\n\\nAs you can see, Goat the restaurant is uber mellow in so many ways --- it's approach, flavor, decor, setting (tiny old house of 10th street), atmosphere, menu (read: no fried avocados here, no sir). Far be it from me to deduct points for being mild mannered, however. It's just a manner of moods. Which do you feel like? If you want something simple, fun, low key, yet kinda different (I've never seen the flautas ahogadas anywhere else), swing on by El Goat.\\n\\nThat's not to say Goat doesn't like to tie one on. I'm totally looking forward for $2 Texas beer Tuesday, and $2 Corona Friday, both 4pm-9pm I believe. Beers.\\n\\nAs I mentioned, the flautas ahogadas looks insane --- flautas in a sort of puddle of chicken broth topped with cheese and their delicious tomatillo salsa --- and on top of this I don't really like flautas. Also, as I don't do burritos ever ever never, I recommend the adobado chicken tacos --- great melt-in-your-mouth flavor that's perfectly seasoned. The tilapia tacos were pretty dull.

It's in one of my favorite parts of the city, is a wonderful space, and I love the outdoor bar.  I ate at the original Strega years and years ago, when it first opened, and was underwhelmed then.  I figured over a decade was enough time to put together a good menu with well-prepared offerings, and I was excited to try its beautiful waterfront location.

It's very close to my house, which I liked, but I found it packed at 8:00pm on a Thursday night. I had to wait quite a while for a spot at the bar, as I didn't want to take a table - I was alone that night. From where I was sat, I could look right into the kitchen and see everything as it was being made. That was sort of fun, as I love to cook myself and watching others cook can be an education. The people who worked here were very friendly, and I liked that too.\\n\\nSo, why only 2 stars? Well, I'm allergic to soy and it turns out most everything made here has soy something in it, or is cooked in soy oil (at least it used to be, but this could have changed, so call and ask if soy is an issue for you too). I also don't like coconut anything. So, my choices of what I could eat were almost nothing.\\n\\nAnother minus point is the parking. Buddha Thai is located in the Willow Springs Shopping center on the NW corner of Iris and 28th St.. There are a total of 5 restaurants here, and a gym, a yoga studio, a tattoo place, a liquor store, two hair salons, a mani/pedi shop, and many other businesses. Parking can be challenging, to say the least, but I can usually find a spot somewhere. I do come to this shopping center for other reasons, and have been since 1992.\\n\\nAnother down point is the noise level. Because it's such a small place, it gets very loud inside; add in the kitchen noises, and it can be close to impossible to carry on a conversation. I've come back twice with others who like it (so, I ate before I went with them) and both times, we ended barely speaking to each other because we just couldn't hear.

It wasn't what I was expecting which isn't a bad thing, challah bread french toast with raspberry preserve spread, canadian bacon and fried egg with cheese. The slight downside was the cheese wasn't melted with the bread but on the egg alone and the canadian bacon also wasn't warmed with the sandwich. It seemed to be 3 separate cooked items put together at the end. I would have liked the sandwich to be fully hot and finished together on the grill. Only downside but my hubby and I shared our food and our son enjoyed his so it was all good. The place was packed and busy but service was nice and attentive. Look forward to returning and trying some other good looking items."},{"name":"The Onion","address":"408 Brazos St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is Awesome!!!

I wasn't sure what \\"Persian\\" cuisine meant, since it's kind of like saying \\"Mediterranian\\" - a good cultural reference, but not terribly definitive in my mind - but I found out.\\n\\nEating from the (expensive) lunch buffet, I found the selection to be limited.  The seven or so main dishes, of which all but three contained beef or lamb, made for limited vegetarian eating.  I will point out that there were four different kinds of rice, including a sweet cherry rice, that were quite tasty and fresh.  There was eggplant stew, vegetable stew, and a veggie stew (don't ask what the difference was, I don't know).  The eggplant stew was relatively tasty, but the eggplant had lost any firmness and resulted in that \\"cooked-too-long-slimy-eggplant\\" texture I'm not fond of.  That was probably due to being on a buffet, so I forgive it. :)  Both veggie stews were good - the one with onions tasted better to me (more savory), but I'd be hard-pressed, even only twenty minutes later, to name the differences.\\n\\nThere were abundant side dishes - tabouli, hummus, must-o-mousir (a tangy yogurt and shallot dip), borani, and others, with both unleavened bread and pita.  All were very tasty, but I favored the must-o-mousir the most.\\n\\nLooking over the menu, it looks like a meat eater would love this place - lots of lamb, all the meat looked very tender, and great side dishes.  For a fish eater, there's only a salmon plate (Sabzi Polo Mahi).  For the pure veg guys, there's only  a veggie skewer plate (Combination Plate) and a sampler consisting of hummus, tabouli, baba ghannooj, dolmeh, and bread (Vegetarian Delights).  The restaurant does take the time to label each dish on the buffet as either \\"Vegetarian\\" or \\"Contains [meat product]\\".  I doubt it would please the vegans, but for the rest of us vegheads, it works out well.  This was worth a star on its own for me.\\n\\nI found the atmoshere pleasing, the service quick and unobtrusive, and the food I tried to be well cooked, interesting in flavor, and unique in style.  I will admit to little experience with this culture's food, but I'm curious.\\n\\nI would love to see Alborz try adding more vegetarian main dishes (use that eggplant, try out some squashes, etc), but I will continue to keep this tasty and versatile addition in my lunch list.

I've been here a couple of times and I've had a great time every time.  \\nLet's start with the set up.  The other day we had no problem parking, but I've been here at 6pm on a Friday night and the place was packed!  We had to valet that night.  \\nWe went on a Tuesday this week at 5:30.  It was not busy at all.  We had our choice of inside or outside.  I couldn't make up my mind so we sat at the edge of the outside/beginning of the inside right near a heater (crazy cold this week).  It was perfect!  The patio has a really lovely view.  On previous occasions I've had to sit at the bar because we couldn't get a table, but luckily they have about 3 bars.  There are quite a few tables for big parties, so this is an awesome place to go with a large group.  \\nThey have an incredible selection of tequila here and if you check in on yelp and order an entr√©e you get a free shot!   I've had the Strawberry Basil Margarita and the Black Cherry Margarita.  Both were outstanding and I would order both again.  I always spend a ton on margaritas here, but they are really good so I'm not going to complain.  \\n I have always ordered the tacos because I mean come on, the place is called Rocco's Tacos.  I have had the crunchy beef taco and the soft pork taco.  Both were really good, but I think I preferred the soft pork taco.  I really like that I can pick my taco and design it how I want it.  The only negative is that a single taco is $3-$5.  This is really high. I can get 2 much larger tacos in the same plaza at Tijuana flats for $5 and I enjoy Tijuana flats.  My local Mexican restaurant sells tacos for $1.99 each.  The price is a big reason why I don't give Rocco's Tacos a better review.  \\nMy friends have ordered tamales, burritos, and chimichangas.  They have enjoyed all of these.  I also really like the rice, which I stole off my friends plate last time.  \\nOn Tuesday we ordered the manchego cheese sticks.  These were basically fried mozzarella sticks, but with manchego.  We didn't love them.  We kind of felt like they were a bit overdone.  They almost seemed burnt.  \\nOverall, great place to go and have drinks with your friends.

We sat in one of the booths. I ordered the Nashville chicken sandwich (hot), a strawberry daiquiri popsicle, and a bbq chicken pizza to share with the table.  My sister got a grilled chicken sandwich with tater tots and a Bellini popsicle. Honestly the food was pretty average. It definitely didn't taste bad but I think it fits into the average bar scene. I would give it a 3.5/5 but rounded up because I felt like the popsicles were a cute idea. Unfortunately, the popsicles were very weak and didn't give a buzz at all. They tasted good and were refreshing on a hot June day. I might come back on a Thursday where they're $1 instead of $5. The chicken sandwich was crispy and the coleslaw was decent but lacked flavor.  It was a good level of spicy and the pickles were a nice touch. The grilled sandwich was pretty good and juicy and the tots were fresh and crispy. The bbq chicken pizza was good and flavorful.

When we found out Mushashino was moving out, we wondered what Mr. Cheng would do with the empty space. Once Street opened, me and my mom decided to go over there.\\n\\nThe theme of Street is Asian Street food, so the menu is full of small plates to share. They also have a full-sushi bar too.  They have updated the space quite a bit, it's not super-modern by any means, but it's no longer the dark dingy dining space that Musashino once was. The biggest change is that they created a separate bar away from the food prepping area/sushi bar. It looks pretty nice.\\n\\nWhen me and my mom got there we ordered  few things to start with, but then to our surprise Mr. Cheng was there and he ordered several more things for us that we probably wouldn't have chosen ourselves which was nice. I'll list everything we ate with an * by the things Mr. Cheng ordered for us.\\n\\nCold Snacks:\\nHamachi tacos-they are small, 3 come to an order, but they were very tasty. It's basically a mini-hard shelled taco with a fried wonton wrapper as the tortilla. It's filled with a slice of sushi hamachi and avacado, and some sauce of some kind. For a group of more than 2 people, you'd need to get two orders of them for sure\\n\\n*Nacho Typical Sushi snack-similar to the hamachi tacos, they are fried wonton \\"chips\\" topped with sushi salmon, fish roe,sauce and I think one other topping. Also very tasty. good for 2-3 people\\n\\nHot Snacks:\\nOnion pancake-I've had onion pancakes at other Asian restaurants, but they were always a little on the oily/greasy side. Th onion pancake at Street was not too oily, and had the perfect ratio of flaky-light chewy dough. Would like to try the once with beef some other time.\\n\\nSkewers:\\nChicken Thigh Yakitori. Reminded me of the Yakitori I had when I went to Tokyo in 2009. The meat is not cooked to death, is seared perfectly which adds great flavor. Very tasty\\n\\n*Grilled Eel Skewers-If you like grilled eel you will like this. Chunks of grilled eel with the typical sweet-soy glaze that grilled eel is typically served with\\n*Escolar Brochette-also with slices of red onion and some tangy-sweet vegetable of some kind? As with the chicken skewers the meat was cooked well and had that nice charred flavor.\\n\\n*Dumplings\\nI can't remember which ones Mr. Cheng ordered for us, but they were steamed, and had a meat filling in them. 6 come to an order and they were little pillows of deliciousness.\\n\\nLastly me and my mom ordered one sushi roll to share. We got the Street Roll, which was very good. They have other \\"Signature\\" rolls which are a bit more creative and complex, similar to how Musashino was, with a similar price-point, but they still have many sushi rolls that you'd See on the Chinatown sushi menu that are more moderately priced.\\n\\nAs one reviewer said, the prices are kind of all over the place, most of the items are fair and moderately priced, but I have to wonder what makes the Shaken Vietnamese Beef worth $19. It's the most expensive thing on the menu! \\n\\nThanks to Mr. Cheng's generosity, we were able to try out a lot more things on the menu.

For sides, we ordered the Old Bay Onion Rings (i would have preferred the chef to be more heavy-handed with the Old Bay- I love that stuff) and Mushroom Casserole (tasty and a variety of mushrooms not just white caps).

I loved the puttanesca slice that I got.  It had tomatoes, artichokes, olives, feta, and garlic on it.  So very delicious, I  really loved it.   Paul loved his pepperoni slices, they looked so greasy though!  His stomach was pretty upset about an hour later, I wonder if it was because he didn't de-grease his slices?  My stomach was a bit upset too!  Although in my case it is highly possible it is just because I was convinced rogue pepperoni grease was attacking my insides so, who knows???"},{"name":"EStEA Cafe ÁîüÊ¥ªÂ∞èÂìÅ","address":"6401 Kingsway, Suite 120","city":"Burnaby","stars":"2.5","text":"Even though it doesn't compare to Asia, Estea does have one of the better bubble teas in town.

It's like the owner knew how to balance every little thing from the veggies to the slaw to the meat and the sauce. Let's go down the list.\\n\\nThe meat here is cooked to perfection. My favorite was probably the fatty brisket. It almost had the same feel you get when you bite into fatty tuna. It melts in your mouth. Just dissolves. The flavor is unbelievable.\\n\\nThey also serve onions, beans, cole slaw, potatoes, pickles and jalape√±o peppers. All of this balances the fatty meat flavors so well that you just keep on eating. It never gets to feel too fatty because all of these sides balance it so perfectly. The beans weren't too sweet. The slaw wasn't too sweet but had a good acidity to it. The potties weren't overly creamy and went so well with the meat.\\n\\nWhat impressed me more than anything is their sauce. The reason is because their sauce so perfectly complements their meat so that you just want to keep eating. Often times BBQ places give sauces that are too sweet or over powering that you can only eat a little of before it overwhelms you. Their sauce you can basically drink. It's light but semi sweet and it goes so well with the meat. It doesn't overpower the meat but enhances it. I'm so impressed that as I keep eating I don't get sick of their sauce.\\n\\nI was so full by the end of my meal that I had to share a dessert just so that I could say I tried it. I was blown away by their blackberry cobbler. Perfect sweetness and acidity. The peach cobbler was pretty good but the blackberry cobbler was amazing. I regret not trying their pecan pie but I just didn't have enough room. Also the fact that they allow for you to bring your own alcohol just makes the experience so awesome.\\n\\nThey have live music as well and the location is so beautiful. This is my perfect restaurant. Amazing in every way and so affordable.\\n\\nI also got a bottle of their salt lick cellar wine. The BBQ Red.

I can't believe it has taken numerous trips into Austin to finally try it...and now I fully regret not having come here sooner.\\n\\nSurprisingly enough, it wasn't too far outside of Austin - a lot farther away on the map. Taking the 45/1 all the way down, and another 5 minute drive down and you are there. I was surprised rolling up - it was a very well kept, very cute place. The winery had a nice decor/atmosphere and lounge area near the trees. We checked in and poked around, admiring how well done everything was.\\n\\nFinally got to our table - went back and forth on getting a small plate vs the all you can eat - we decided to do the AYCE, which was a good choice. This place is BYOB, so we brought a few cans of beer in. The smell in this place was amazing, and watching the guys work over the open pit with the meat - made you appreciate how much love and work went into it.\\n\\nFood finally came out - I literally skipped all the sides (except for one piece of some amazing bread) and went straight for the meat.\\n\\nSausage - not a huge fan of sausage to begin with - it was good - had a nice smoky flavor to it.\\n\\nBrisket - money, straight up. Our first plate was a lot more of the meat, less fatty pieces. It was good, tender, had some great smoke flavor. I wasn't overly crazy about the BBQ sauce - guess I'm used to the normal traditional sweet - but it did complement the brisket very well. Our second plate of meat had a burned end and some of the fatty end pieces - straight up heaven. What? Heaven. My third plate of meat had more fatty pieces and more burned ends. Mmmmmm!\\n\\nRibs - great. I grew up on wet ribs, and also have had plenty of experience eating dry ribs in Memphis. (Family, and traveled there for work multiple times a month) I was surprised that these ribs were unique - had that smoked meat texture and flavor, similar to dry but with more of that savory bark. The sauce once again, not my fav plain, but complemented it perfectly when put together.\\n\\nSeriously, who eats the sides? We had 3 plates of meat before I finally cut myself off...having eaten one piece of bread and maybe a bite of the coleslaw. (Coleslaw without mayo? Money!) If we had a fridge in our hotel room I'd have gotten another plate to go, but sadly, we did not. \\n\\nSalt Lick will be a part of every Austin trip from hereon out.

I mean this in two ways--beware, I'm going to get detailed. We ate some of the more adventurous items on the menu. And if you're the type who can't handle too spicy or acidic (acid reflux), too greasy or creamy (diarrhea), or too much meat (MORE diarrhea), then you're like me.\\n\\nAnyway, Craigie on Main gets a 3.8 from me: the food was good but some of the dishes we ordered were similar to dishes in cheaper Asian restaurants, the experience was memorable and recommendable, and the aftermath was...also memorable. The service was great and our waiter was amazing. That being said, I think we could have gotten a very different dining experience with different menu choices. Craigie on Main deserves a repeat.\\n\\nWe ordered pork ragout, pig tails, the shared pig's head, a praline-nougat dessert, and vanilla saffron pudding. I also had 2 cocktails (the Serius, a delicious lemon/ginger/vodka concoction) and my boyfriend had a beer. We ordered the pig head right off the bat as it takes a bit longer than most of their entrees.\\n\\nFirst, the food. The bread was decent; it was a nice sourdough, but it was being served from the basket next to the computer. My boyfriend wanted his bread straight from the oven--nitpicky, but, as he pointed out, the amount we paid might justify something like this. For the amuse bouche, we received what I believe was beef heart pastrami with a touch of mustard underneath. It was sliced thinly and was surprisingly tender. Definitely a great first impression for my first experience with heart!\\n\\nThe food was pretty much perfectly executed. The pig tails were perfectly seasoned, delicious, and very Vietnamese-inspired. There were onions (I think) lightly breaded and fried on top, cilantro, and thinly sliced jalapenos. The pigtails were, as the server said, basically (delicious, tender, collagen-y) chicken wings except with pork. With the exception of the onions on top, however, I think you could walk into an Asian restaurant and get a similar dish of equal tastiness, except with slapdash presentation and a less pleasant environment. The pork ragout topped with a farm egg was great--a much lighter appetizer than the pig tails, but one that really showcased the talent of Craigie's kitchen.\\n\\nThat leaves us with the pig head. It was a delicious mess and an incredibly fun thing to do, if not to eat. For the faint of heart, it does get kind of gross to look at the fuller you get. I recommend the experience at least once. Taste wise, again, very Asian inspired. Barbarically ripping chunks off the skull, placing them in a Peking pancake with a smear of boudin noir/hoison sauce and a bouquet of sambal...I had a few critiques, some of which might have to do with my skill in choosing what parts of the head to eat.\\n\\nTips based off impressions: Avoid the fat for the sake of your gall bladder and because although it will initially be delicious, it gets really disgusting biting into a mushy pocket of fat as you start getting fuller. Fight your partner over the cheek muscle. Don't put too much boudin noir sauce on. I found a little went a LONG way--it was very rich, and you could taste the graininess and pastiness the blood introduced into the sauce. I actually thought a slightly more acidic sauce would have been better; this one was a touch too creamy. The sambal was DELICIOUS and did add some acidity, but had a very strong flavor on its own that would have overpowered the other \\"burrito\\" components if there was too much. It had bean sprouts, which I thought I hated, but I found myself cleansing my palate with fistfuls of the stuff. I do not recommend the ear (had a weird musty smell to it) and the pupil of the eyeball (yes, it's there. Weird texture).\\n\\nLastly, desserts were a surprise delight. I love praline and nougat, and this dessert was perfection. The vanilla/saffron pudding was also great, and we received teeny, tasty macarons while paying the $200+ check.\\n\\nThen came Wilbur's revenge. Even on the 40 minute ride home I felt my gall bladder furiously squirting/cramping and wondered what the heck was happening down there. I was pretty much stuck on the toilet for the rest of the evening and periodically the following day. Fighting for the toilet in a 1 bedroom apartment with your significant other is not fun. My thought was it was caused by too much fat, too much meat--hence, not for weak stomachs. But I don't regret it at all!

My favorite place to sit is definitely out on the patio at the top right next to the shop, because it's covered and there are fans there to keep it relatively cool.

Even though there's multiple Wi-Fi networks to connect to, I've found that Wi-Fi while out on the patio is still pretty bad, even if you connect to the one specifically for the patio. So I've just learned that the best areas to sit for good connection is either in the shop itself or on the patio as close to the shop as possible. However, I definitely come here if I just need to get reading done - bad Wi-Fi = less distractions! \\n\\nParking: Not the best, especially during weekends. The lot in front of the shop itself is pretty small and always crowded, but if you're lucky, you might find an open space! If not, then you'll have to succumb to parking in the lot across the street. \\n\\nFood/Drinks: Nothing superb, but then again everyone knows you come to Mozart's for the view. Depending on my mood, I always get either an iced vanilla latte (coffee isn't something I would consider myself an expert in, so please excuse my basic-ness) or the bottomless iced hibiscus and passion fruit tea and have found both to be pretty good. I've never had any of their desserts, mainly because I doubt that their quality is worth the price."},{"name":"Cafe Yumm!","address":"1806 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I could eat a meal here several times a week.

By best overall, I should say that I still like some donuts at DD, and I still think Betty Ann has the best donut in Boston (my favorite is the lemon, hot out of the oven), but if I had to pick a dozen donuts from any donut shop, it would have to be Ohlin's. Their dough is light and fluffy, while still having some weighty crustiness. There are many relics among donut shops in the Metro Boston area.

The patio is also quite nice.\\n\\nFor my meal, I chose the Burrito de desayuno. First, I didn't find that the burrito was put together all that well. It sat on the plate like a limp fish. Also, the proportions in the filling were a bit off. I can't fault them for this necessarily as it's a matter of personal choice. I found the burrito noticeably lacking in the chorizo department. I'm a meat kinda guy, and I can't even say that I got chorizo in every other bite of the burrito. The potatoes were soggy and the cheese was neither melted nor incorporated well into the rest of the filling. That said, for the most part the components of the burrito tasted well by themselves. A little more time in a heating element and I suspect that things might come together a bit better.\\n\\nGoing solely on the freshness of the individual ingredients (and the cheap drinks), I would definitely give Pure another try.

Slightly cold, I started unraveling the burger to put ketchup on it.. only to my surprise yet again the non attentive bartender had nothing but onion - the complete opposite of what I ordered. It took another 10 mins to get her attention about the mistake and now I'm currently waiting on my remake. She placed a man's sweet tea, who was seating two seats down from me, in front of me like I ordered it and I had to give it to him. She never brought me a check after I asked her for it.

I'd love nothing more than to sip through the entire drinks list-- sugarcane lemonade, lavender citrus toddies, mango and banana batidos, cortaditos, coconut sodas, sangria mojitos-- and roll away on a haze of croquettes & empanadas.\\n\\nI particularly enjoyed my introduction to Iron Beer (think a fruity, extra effervescent Dr. Pepper) and Malta Hatuey- a hoppy, rich cereal-like malt soda, dowsed with condensed milk; in essence, a cream soda! To think I once passed by these drinks with indifference at my local Mexican supermarket... never again."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Amazing food.

We had heard that if we were in Boston, we had to visit the North End and find some Italian food, so that's exactly what we did. Having over 1,000 reviews with 4.5 stars, we thought it'd be a good choice.  After eating there, I agree with the good reviews. But be prepared to wait! The restaurant is pretty small, maybe 12-15 tables at most. The food was quick and the service was attentive and friendly. You could see the kitchen and the chefs working, which was a nice touch. It felt like a personable, family atmosphere. \\n\\nMy husband had butternut squash($16), which he loved and was very fresh tasting. He did however feel that his dish was a little smaller in size than he expected when he compared it to the other pasta dishes people had ordered, and I agreed. But he was still happy he ordered it, and just asked for an extra basket of bread in order to soak up the remaining sauce. I had a special for the day($23), halibut with a risotto with asparagus and lobster meat. It was divine and filling, I even had leftovers."},{"name":"Polonia","address":"750 S US Hwy 17-92","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"Went there for dinner for two, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  We split an appetizer of 3 pierogi (aka Polish ravioli), comprising one each of the fillings on offer: spinach, potato and cheese, and mushroom and sauerkraut.  All were fresh, hot, and very tasty.  The breaded veal cutlet was yummy, as was the wasanki (a superior Slavic riff on corned beef hash where the meat is kielbasa, the starch is kluski noodles, and sauteed cabbage is thrown into the mix).  FYI, kluski are short, stout mini dumplings that are close cousins to German spaetzle.  The kielbasa here is a little bit spicy, very garlicky, and quite authentic.   I had strong, smooth honey wine with the wasanki, and it stood up well to the assertive flavors.  Only later did I realize it was a dessert wine.  Oops.    Speaking of dessert, it is homemade like everything else on the menu, and quite delicious.  The lemon mascarpone cake was tart and creamy, and the apple strudel was tasty, if less ethereal than the classic Hungarian or Austrian versions.  Overall, the prices are reasonable and good value for money.  My only quibble was that I used a restaurant.com coupon, and the waitress insisted on tacking on a 20% gratuity ON THE TAX as well as on the original cost of the food.  The service was good, but still, that was a bit out of line."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Disappointed!!

I went with two of my favorite eating buddies, my mom and my roommate, and opted for the Prix Fixe. For $32, you get your choice of an appetizer, entree and dessert, plus coffee or tea. That sounds like a deal (although it's still a pretty damn expensive brunch), but if you were to order all your courses separately, you would only pay a few bucks more. I even had to pay a $6 supplement to get the steak and eggs, which featured one of the saddest hunks of beef I've ever seen.\\n\\nI won't dwell on the food too much because there's really not much to say. Nothing was bad, but nothing wowed us, either, and at a restaurant of this caliber, you expect to be wowed. The donut was good, but it was certainly not the life-altering experience that many--our waiter included--claimed it to be. As I mentioned, my steak unremarkable, while the potato galette that accompanied it was pretty much tasteless. Had I ordered this meal on its own (and paid for it myself) for $26, I would have felt the victim of highway robbery (Another ripoff? A $4 side of jam. Give me one of those little cartons of Smuckers you get at a diner any day). The best part of my entree were the eggs and toast. Go figure.\\n\\nMy roommate had the grilled dayboat scallops and tomato gravy grits, which was an odd flavor combination to be sure, but one that she rather much enjoyed. My mom, on the other hand, found her entree, the beef cheek and tongue hash, a total letdown. I actually kind of liked it, but she claimed it had no flavor. Between the three of us, we got to try all the desserts, and each one outshone everything that came before.\\n\\nWhile the food was for the most part underwhelming, the service was downright peculiar. We arrived a little early for our 12 o'clock reservation, and were asked to wait on a ramp leading down to the bar area. It was more than a little awkward standing there clasping our coffee, waiting for our table to be ready. What we didn't know was that a four-top by the window which remained unoccupied the entire time we stood was actually for us. Why we couldn't sit and sip our drinks is beyond me.\\n\\nOur waiter, Shawn, on the other hand, was a delight. When he saw that my mom wasn't really enjoying her brunch, he must have told his manager, who in turn gave her her meal for free. It's that brand of classiness and professionalism that makes restaurants like Craigie on Main a pleasure to dine in. For that reason alone, I'd definitely consider going back."},{"name":"Sargam House Restaurant","address":"955 West Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This place has gone down hill!

I said all that to say (nobody was intoxicated) The lamb chops were tough and had a lot of fat, the sweet potato fries were overcooked and the arugula salad was salty.

The BYOB is nice - when facing a long wait, it's good to be able to just pop your next beer without tracking down a waitperson or elbowing up to a crowded bar.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the BBQ is pretty ordinary. A Texas BBQ joint has got to put its best foot forward with their brisket to earn my respect, and The Salt Lick offers a dead average brisket. From the all-you-can-eat offerings, that leaves sausage - which is good, but it's hard to find bad sausage in central Texas - and ribs, which are definitely the high point of the meat trio. Sides are better than average, but not sublime.\\n\\nNot surprising for an Austin-area eatery, but amusing trivia nonetheless: On both visits, when we asked about particulars, the waitperson deferred on the question with the explanation that they were vegetarian.

It is conveniently located on \\"the drag\\" and is super close to campus. Normally, before I discovered Austin Pizza, I hate flat crust pizza. If it wasn't pan crust or thick crust from like Pizza Hut or Dominos, I would not eat it. A friend of mine dragged me into this place one day for lunch and my opinion on thin crust pizza was forever changed. \\n\\nFirst Impressions: When you walk in, it is this big room with limited seating's on the first floor. I remember thinking where am I going to sit? I didn't realize at the time that there was a second floor full of tables and a full service bar in the back corner. We proceeded to the counter and ordered pizza. I was hesitant of course.\\n\\n I got the personal size pizza (7 or 10 inch I think) combo drink included for about $8 bucks. The manager at the counter was really nice and he explained to me how to make my order which was basically for the lunch combo, pick two toppings and wah-la, your pizza is complete. I picked mushrooms and pepperoni. It's a safe choice especially for me in case I didn't like the pizza and had to give to someone else. \\n\\nThey give you a cup for your drink and a number for your order so the server can find you later I guess and you can fill up your drink at the drink fountain thing to the right of the counter. We walked up stairs (amazing because I didn't realize there were stairs at first). \\n\\nThe pizza arrived, small and personal. Each slice fitted perfectly into my hand and in about 3 bits, I finished my first slice of thin crust pizza that I wasn't repulsed about. The toppings were fresh, especially the mushrooms, just enough grease for a pizza, and the crust while lacking was soft and chewy. At least, I didn't feel like a parrot, \\"Polly want a hard cracker\\" for my crust.  I totally fell in love.\\n\\nSo I continued to go there for lunch and got different toppings each time (pineapple and pepperoni, hamburger and mushrooms) Most of the time, I was with one other friend. It's a really relaxed place to be at so it's okay if you don't have a friend to come along. \\n\\nI went with a group of about 6 once to the place and realized they had BBQ chicken pizza which I has by the way a very strong BBQ smell floating into the air and invading every other smell in its path. \\n\\nThey have this pizza called MoPac which is dedicated to one of Austin's highway. MoPac included every topping: pepperoni, green & black olives, fresh tomatoes, mushrooms, bell peppers, ham, can't remember what else, but the toppings were toppling over. Both the pizza we ordered that night was 14 inches. Trust me, the boys and 2 girls were stuffed. \\n\\nThey also serve pizza rolls which I didn't know until now. It was stuffed full with pepperoni on the inside, soft and chewy bread baked until the outside was an even dark golden brown. It came with two sauces (not sure if it was free or not) but the classic marinara sauce and ranch. \\n\\nThe guy who worked there, Justin or whatever his name is was really nice. I went with my group at around 10pm on a Sunday night and since we ordered 2 pizzas and those rolls, he gave us free drinks so that saved us about $12 bucks combined. \\n\\nI recommend this place to everyone...\\"roll out\\""},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The restaurant is good.

I adore Surly Girl. \\n\\nIt's a rather long and narrow bar... so when it is busy, it is kind of hard to navigate. Don't let that deter you away from this place! The actual decor of the bar is some of the most interesting I've seen and is almost enough to check the place out. The wallpaper is a reddish color with little scorpion silhouettes embossed into them! How rad! The decor is a mix of Wild West meets Moulin Rouge meets a haunted house... seriously. It's very eclectic. They have a bar along the side and smaller tables on the other side for up to four people (although I've been in and seen parties of 6 or so be able to push tables together). I definitely recommend keeping the number of people in your party down to insure you have a place to sit. Either way, it's a cool place to socialize. \\n\\nThey have one of my favorite beers (Brasserie Des Rocs Grand Cru), which is so hard to find at a bar! So with that, I am quite a happy lady. The beer selection is pretty good, but it can't beat Bodega just down the street. Which is great is that they have a lot of micro-breweries and they even have an icon next to the specifically \\"woman-brewed\\" beers. Excellent! They have also Surly Temples for $3 all the time! The food is actually quite good and they do have a happy hour special where the Frito pie is quite cheap (and you can get veggie chili on it instead of real meat. Um, awesome!?)

The dark reflective tint on the windows block any sight of activities. Understandable, since the restaurant faces Kirkman Rd. and the beating afternoon Florida sun.\\n\\nIt is an expansive open dining room with hues of Latin colors. The tables were white linen and butcher paper with standard paper napkins. There is no host so a server nodded to an empty table. Several minutes later.....okay forever later a server walked over and asked for a drink order at the same time handing us menus. Okay, maybe they were busy. Not really, more like unorganized. Order placed, beer took forever to arrive. Frosted mug, had a bad odor. Food was delivered by another server. During the entire meal our server was more interested in talking and interacting with the other servers or what was going on outside the front door than our table. There seem to be a common thread among service staff to avoid interacting with guest at all cost. I even observed a server at a table pretending to listen to the guest while rolling his eyes at the other server. Another server was more focused on changing the track blasting Latin music. Did not seem like any staff wanted to be there. Poor showing on all levels.\\n \\nThe rotisserie chicken was cooked perfectly. Seasoning was spot on. Very flavorful, juicy and moist. Rice and beans was okay. Skirt steak was a perfect balance of flavoring. The chimichurri was definitely bursting with flavors. Yuca fries were crisp yet tender inside. Good down to earth food. Nice portion size. They have a Peruvian beer, Cusquena, not bad at all. Medium body, nice balance.\\n\\nIf the server remembered we ordered another soup, it would have been somewhat decent. Then again, if we weren't given someone else's check it would have been okay too. Oh, I can't go on.....Arrogance comes to mind.

They started taking people off the ride with a ladder and that's when we decided it wasn't going to get fixed soon so we got out of line. Trying to find an exit we walked to where we thought it would be and heard the roller coaster start up again. We tried to hurry back to get our place in line but that was difficult because of the crowd. We made it back and got on the ride. It was very short and not worth the wait. \\n\\nWe did like Jurassic Park and I enjoyed the water show in the tomb. I can't remember the name. The talking water fountain was a hoot and my daughter still talks about Cosmo (the fountain). \\n\\nAfter going to Holiday World in Santa Claus Indiana nothing can compare to it.

Her last bite was sushi and she had a smile on her face.

The heavy prices kept heaving in the back of our minds when there were other places now that served as good as or better food in the area.  Yes, competition has come to this community and we just couldn't afford to eat there anymore with them catering to the nouveau riche clientele.  If the food matched the prices, we'd understand, but it didn't.\\n\\nThe heyday of the original ownership has come and gone like our grandmother who so dearly liked eating there.\\n\\nMaybe if we come back to try it again, things will have improved, but the past two years and numerous tries hasn't fared that well.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong the place is still good, just not as good as the newcomers in this town."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Ginger molasses cookie and milk chocolate macadamia nut cookie.

The lettuce wrapped \\"unwich\\" is a good low cal/low carb modification, that comes at no additional cost.  They'll take any sandwich on their menu, and wrap it in large lettuce leaves, like a lettuce burrito.  This isn't a sandwich-in-a-bowl like some places offer, but an actual lunch you can pick up and eat (neatly) with your hands, no fork and knife required.\\n\\nAnd did I mention they're pretty cheap?

They have 2 signature bratwurst dishes which are phenomenal.  This is not your typical store bought \\"greasy who knows what it's made\\" of bratwurst.

I visited Chambar with my mom for Mother's Day and we honestly had no idea how it was going to be. I've heard so many great things about this restaurant but I've never really tried it so here it goes!\\n\\nBeing asian, we parked at Tinseltown because you get 2 free hours of parking (oh dear god I hope we can finish dinner in 2 hours!) We wandered around Beatty St a couple times, looking for a nice fancy restaurant and honestly, we could not find it! I had to pull out the iPhone and guess what, its a hole in the wall kind of place. The doorway resembles Sweet Revenge (dessert place on Main St) and when I walked in, I thought this place was going to be tiny! I can see right to the end and it looks like a very narrow corridor with only around 10-15 tables max! When we were greeted, we wandered past those 10 tables and oh my gosh it opens up into this bright massive room! I honestly did not expect it from this place at all.\\n\\nWe were first greeted by our server, very nice and friendly. He mentioned the daily special and recommendations. My mom was curious about the architecture and asked the server and he told us that the building is actually a historic one that's at LEAST 100 years old so the wood and furnishing inside the restaurant is real! Not like the 'wood' we have nowadays, ahem more like plywood.\\n\\nTo carry on,  we ordered the mussels to share, I ordered the Bison steak and my mom ordered the Sea Bass or the Halibut.  My apologies for the type of fish it was, it was honestly quite a long time ago.\\n\\nThe infamous mussels. Okay hands down these are the freshest and richest flavored mussels that both my mom and I have ever tried in Vancouver. Beats Sandbar, beats Cafe salade de fruits and Rodney's!  You can tell that the sauce wasn't just drizzled on top, these mussels have actually been cooked in the white wine sauce hence you can literally taste the wine inside the mussel! If you're a restaurant owner and wanting to enter the seafood business, you've got a strong competitor right here!\\n\\n\\n\\nNext up is my Flat Iron Bison Steak. I would love it if it came out a bit warmer but overall it was good. Loved the mushrooms on the side, and the bison steak was great! I honestly haven't tried a lot of bison meat before so I can't really compare but I do like this over your regular sirloin steak or NY tenderloin steak. The steak was well seasoned as well so you could really taste the flavor with every bite!\\n\\n\\nLast up is my mom's fish. I'm sorry I really don't remember the type of fish it was and I only had one bite but from what I recall, I remember the texture as being very smooth, similar to a Sea Bass or Black Cod type of fish! If you know exactly which kind it is, please leave a comment below! I recall it as very good, very much comparable to the fish served at Sandbar :)\\n\\nOverall, this was a great Mother's Day. She loved her dinner there, the service was fantastic and staff were very knowledgeable as well. Love how the dress code is semi-formal / casual and yet the food is five star quality! Its a easy place to catch up with friends or to have a very very serious dinner :) joking, a place that everyone would feel comfortable dining in for sure!\\n\\nMy G-star rating images needs improvement so text will suffice for now.\\n\\nG-star rating:\\n\\n5 out of 5 (stellar service, food and a very comfortable dining environment)\\n\\nHope you enjoyed the post :)\\n\\nfor more postings check out www.sunnysideupssu.wordpress.com"},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Born and raised in Texas, just moved to Austin.

I have to say this is the worst potato salad I have ever tried.  The coleslaw needs something to give it more flavor.  I gave this place a 3 because so many people on Yelp have said the sides are not good.....you would think the Salt Lick would try  different recipes because their sides aren't good.

The cheese and potato empanadas are great as an appetizer or a small meal. The naran-pi√±a juice is DELICIOUS, so much so that I have dreams about it. Lastly the desserts here are phenomenal.

I worked as a line cook in a Cajun/Creole place in New Orleans for a while.  This place tries for that type of food and fails.  They can't even figure out basics, such as the Etouffee that is listed as having a creole sauce.  An Etouffee is a brown roux based sauce.  A creole sauce is a tomato based red sauce.  When I asked the server how it could be both, he said they did their Etouffee with a red sauce.  That's a basic part of a core dish that is completely wrong.  I had the Brisket po-boy, and my GF had the shrimp po-boy.  Neither was much like a po-boy.  They were both bland.  The Brisket was really dry, and the cheese didn't melt properly, instead all the oil just separated out.  The shrimp weren't very good either, no real flavor to them.  A friend had the Fried Chicken, which had a good crust, but again the chicken itself had no seasoning or flavor to it.  I would think that after a few bites it would be easy to lose interest in it.  We also split an appetizer of Tasso Ham hush-puppies.  It didn't taste much like Tasso.  Just a pile of mushiness.  Good hush-puppies have a stiffer feel and more complex flavor from more coarsely ground corn. It tasted more like corn muffin mix.  \\n\\nAs for the beers, there is a decent list on tap, but they don't have the right glass ware for the different styles.  Everything is served in the same 16 and 9 oz glasses.  The beer was definitely warm, and I could see them having problems with the beer foaming over like crazy.  So if you like beer that is warm, 1/4 foam, and served in the wrong glass-ware, this is your place.  It also has a horrible layout where the servers are constantly carrying food through a narrow area between the bar and window seating.  Just a badly thought out place that fails in execution."},{"name":"Spice Modern Steakhouse","address":"326 S Park Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3","text":"I guess I should have known better than to order sushi from a steakhouse (although this place didn't have as many steaks on the menu as I thought a steakhouse would).\\n\\nI ordered the Nigiri Dinner and the Lava Roll.

Both were beautifully presented but they were just okay.  The rice wasn't too flavorful and there was just so much of it in the nigiri!  I had to break off half of each piece just so I could enjoy the sushi (otherwise, you feel like you're eating rice with a hint of fish).  Some of the fish tasted more fresh than others - it's not the freshest fish I've had, but it certainly wasn't the least fresh either.  The Lava Roll was decent.  It's heavy though!\\n\\nMy coworkers ordered several appetizers, including the spicy edamame, bruschetta, fire quesadilla, calamari, and fried gyoza.

Seats are extremely close, often an inch or two apart.  On the window outside, there is a plaque showing that it was review by Rachel Ray's $40 a day.  There is a menu taped on the window outside, but there are two blackboards inside.  The large blackboard has the everyday menu while a smaller blackboard on the opposite corner has the daily specials.  The kitchen is in the back of the restaurant.  With a bar in between the kitchen and the rest of the restaurant, you can see the chefs preparing your food.\\n\\nFood:  Admittedly, I've never been a huge fan of Italian food (blasphemy, I know).  But I really enjoyed the food I had at Giacomo's.  when we were seated at our table, 1/4 loaf of bread was already waiting for us.  The bread was cold, but still tasty.\\n\\nFirst, we had the fried calamari appetizers that many have been raving about.  It was good but not out of this world.  Coated with cornmeal (I think), the calamari's are tender and not greasy.  The sauce is pretty fresh.\\n\\nFor entree, we had the 1/2 lobster, clam, and mussel linguine special for $18.95.  Since you get to pick the sauces, I asked the waitress for her recommendation.  She said that she always combines the Giacomo's sauce (very creamy) with the spicier lobster sauce (I forgot the name) for a little bit of heat.  For my dish, I didn't think the sauce had much heat, but it was definitely delicious.  I got 1/2 of a lobster, 4 clams, and 9 mussel.  My fiance, who normally hates seafood, actually enjoyed my dish.  The other dish we got was the chicken marsala.  The chicken must have been fried beforehand.  It was very tender and juicy.  The sauce was more sweet than salty.  Also comes with lots of fresh mushrooms.\\n\\nService:  Considering how busy this place is, the service is surprisingly good.  My waitress was very patient in explaining to me all my options regarding the sauces.  She recommended the combination of the sauces, which I didn't think would be optional previously.\\n\\nThe wait time at Giacomo's is long.  When we arrived at 5:20PM, there was already a line.  Standing at the end of the sidewalk, it took us about 45 minutes to get inside the restaurant.  When we left around 7PM, the line was still there, albeit marginally shorter.

It also just so happened that the North End wasn't very crowded on a Friday night, so my girlfriend and I were able to get in and get a table within five to ten minutes (which was important given the cold weather!).  Rosemary sat us at a small table in the back, right next to another couple, and we got right to ordering as we were both hungry.  Tried the fried calamari, house salad, special of the day (1/2 lobster, clams,  with scampi sauce over linguine), and the butternut ravioli with cheese sauce, accompanied by a bottle of red wine.\\n\\nTHE GOOD\\n 1) Food quality was excellent - Fried calamari was probably the best we had ever had - lightly breaded, not overcooked, lots of meat - and the pastas and meats were all cooked well.\\n 2) Cost was low - wine was $18/bottle, and the total meal was around $75 before tip (and we left quite full).  Contrary to other reviews, these guys DO take Visa (no AMEX though).\\n 3) Service - the place is small, so there is always waitstaff right nearby.  Rosemary (our server) was the sister of the owner and had been working there for 14 years.  Very friendly and enjoyed her work.\\n\\nTHE BAD\\n 1) The place is SMALL - You are sitting essentially at the same table as other diners, and the waiters are always brushing by.  Get comfortable, and enjoy it (sometimes other diners have good suggestions on food choices!). \\n 2) Not romantic - would not take a first date here as it feels much more crowded and less romantic than some of the other dining options in the North End.

My last meal on this planet, I can assure you will be at this place.\\n\\nEvery single time I must order the Rabo Encendido (The oxtail). Each oxtail has seemingly been simmering for hours and is drenched in a mouth watering sauce consisting of the beef's own tender juices and most likely Jesus Christ's tears. It's served with an ample amount of rice and greens, decorated in a spectacularly appealing fashion. This dish is the heavy hitter. The show stopper. The siren of my palate. I dream of picking up an oxtail and sinking my teeth in, because I am met with a sensation so powerful that I can feel time slow. I can assure you that I will not have this type of emotional reaction to anything else in my life.\\n\\nThe atmosphere of Pambiche is very entertaining because it seemingly takes on the hustle and bustle found in a different country. The outdoor seating is perfect for dates or parties of 4 and is not meant to seat very large groups. The indoor seating can feel a little small if you bring a large amount of people. I highly recommend attending Pambiche with a smaller, close knit group of friends, not only to ensure that you are more comfortable but to allow for more people to file in and experience the food as well. \\n\\nMost of my dine-ins have been with server Carlos who captures everything great, exciting, and lively about Cuban food through his passionate energy and genuine care.

Flour is a good place for lunch, and an amazing place for dessert.  Sandwiches are reasonably priced.  Desserts are...sort of reasonable.  I mean, $4 for a brownie isn't ideal.  $6 for a small slice of chocolate cream pie - ugh.  But then again, their recipes are awesome - so who cares.  Recently had the apple pie and it was one of the best I've ever had.  WOW.  Homemade oreos...pop tarts...sticky buns...cookies...it's a sweet tooth's dream come true.\\n\\nA rare miss, however?  The cupcakes.  They are too big and kind of flavorless.  Joanne needs to go back to the drawing board on these and look at what Sprinkles Cupcakes does and deliver a stronger product.  Go a little bit smaller, sweeter, perhaps fill the inside.  They simply don't live up to the rest of the phenomenal baked goods.

I'm not a huge octopus fan but enjoyed it more than I thought and the crab was delicious. The martini style tequila cocktails were a hit, not too sweet, no lingering alcoholic taste, easy too drink and very enjoyable. \\n\\nThe wine list is larger than the menu (this is always a good thing in my books) and the sommelier was helpful to my partner (not much of a wine drinker himself) in picking out a wine that he'd enjoy. \\n\\nEntres: This is where things took a turn. My partner ordered the rib eye steak ($33). He enjoyed it thoroughly. I don't eat beef so I can't comment on the dish but based on the look of bliss on his face and the happy sounds while eating, I think it safe to say this was a great dish. I ordered the arctic char (L'omble de l'Artique nicois, $28). The sauces and greens had a variety of flavours, all nicely complementing the crispy skin fish. The problem I had was of the two pieces of fish one was cooked through, still moist and flakey, positively delicious, however, the thinner of the two pieces was cooked medium rare. Now, if you are serving fish medium rare, one it should be listed as such and secondly BOTH pieces should be cooked the same. Because the thicker slice was cooked through I took the thinner slice to be under done (I prefer my fish either raw or well done). \\n\\nWhile eating our main dishes we had multiple offers for more drinks (which we took) but at no point were we asked how the food was. I took notice because I was actually waiting for someone to ask.  When I did find the waitress and tell her that my fish was under cooked, she took it back to the kitchen only to return to tell me the kitchen said it was medium rare which is okay. She followed this up with that some people don't like it medium rate (so I'm assuming fish has been returned before) but that was it. No apology, no piece of cooked fish, not even the offer to return the medium rare piece. This means I ended up with only half an entre. In a less expensive restaurant I might expect this but for $28 a dish (our total bill before gratuities was over $180) I expect more. I must say this left me feeling rather pissed and if it weren't for the desserts I'm not sure I'd even consider going back. (I'd like to point out that I would have pushed the fish issue with her more but it was my boyfriends birthday dinner and I didn't want to cause a fuss for his sake.)\\n\\nThe desserts: this redeemed the night. We split an espresso cheesecake (Le Caf√© Belge, $12) and lemon cake with Chambar ale (Les Dessert de Nico, $12). The cheesecake, although laughably small, was so beautifully presented I had to be one of those people who photograph their food. It was just as tasty as it looked but the real wow was the lemon cake. I'm a cheesecake fanatic, so for me to be wowed by lemon cake is quite something. But this is no regular cake. It is a very firm cake served in a glass floating over an once or so of ale and topped with whip cream and a heavy cream. The magic happens when the cake if pushed down into the beer. Sounds odd but is so good. I'm not even sure how to describe it. It was simply bliss. \\nSo in to recap, the flavours Chambar serves up are beautiful but the service was disappointing for the $200 bill and we returned home from dinner less than two hours ago and I'm already feeling I need to see what's in the fridge."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Love this place.

The least I can do is meet them halfway and visit again and give them a second chance based on this level of response from the manager. Thus, I changed my review from 1 star to 3. \\n\\n\\nI will preface my review to say that I am not someone who has ever worked in the food service industry but I have worked retail service so I understand unruly customers. Additionally,I am a public school teacher so I work with the general public on a daily basis. I have the highest regard for our public service workers. And on Yelp, I only review if things are exceedingly good or bad. Tonight's experience was the latter.\\n\\nThis was my third time coming here but only my first coming with a large party. I either blocked out the restaurant's peculiar \\"we cannot do individual checks\\" policy or it was not an issue on those first two visits.\\n\\nThe food, first of all is quite good. The chicken can be somewhat greasy (I am from SC, so yes, I know what good fried chicken tastes like) but overall is quite nice. The large party I came in with tonight had a reservation and all of the members save 2 came in at the same time. \\n\\nEverything was going well in the evening with the service until we were recommended to order two Big Cluckers (at $28) to accommodate our large party. From that kind of recommendation, I would have assumed that meant the check could be split. Apparently, that is \\"not how their system works\\", which became our server's mantra as the evening progressed. To me, that is a convenient excuse for incompetency.\\n\\nOur table was given water and drinks and carafes of water and iced tea, but no refills ever came after the food was served. Our server was attentive in the beginning but after our food came, it was like he wanted nothing to do with us. Perhaps that was because he left out multiple items in at least 3 people's food orders, and left us all with a feeling that he was subconsciously blaming us for his clear lack of being able to handle a large party. Either way, I was beginning to feel we were to blame for his inadequacies at his job.\\n\\nIt was only when the check arrived that we were told it could not be split. At least 3 members of our table did not eat from the two large cluckers - which he was aware of - and yet they still were forced to pay based on this restaurant's antiquated system. Every other restaurant I have ever been to in Columbus has told me what their policy is with checks for large parties at the start. And considering we had a few people at our table with food service industry experience, this was kind of a large oversight on our server's part.\\n\\nOur server then did a clumsy attempt at splitting the bill, which we were told would take a while, once again emphasizing in a not so subtle way that this was our fault and not his nor the restaurant's. After at least 15-20 min of waiting for the bill to be taken care of, two of us - myself included - were told  in a round about way how it was our fault that he messed up on how he split my and another person's bill.  We were even told that because \\"we all came in so sporadically \\" - Uh making a reservation and 2 people coming in about 20 min after the party is sporadic? - this was why everything was so screwed up with the bill.  At this point, his tales of incompetency were of no interest to me. \\n\\nIt disappoints me to give such a negative review as the food truly was quite good. The ambiance of the restaurant is great and the hostess was very kind. Our server even started out very kind and informative. It was once he began to realize his own errors - not telling us he could not split checks, encouraging us to order something for a large party he knew we could not split, becoming upset with us because we were basically making him do his job - that he basically gave a bad name to his restaurant and the entire Short North. \\n\\nI shall not be returning to Double Comfort, nor recommending it to anyone I know. In fact, I will be vehemently discouraging people from coming. It is a shame, especially given the dearth of southern food establishments in town, but I cannot subject anyone I know or like to this type of incompetence just to get some battered chicken."},{"name":"Another Broken Egg Cafe","address":"4745 B Ashford Dunwoody Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Pros?

My companion really enjoyed his dirty chai but I would have preferred more flavor. \\n\\nThe lines usually aren't too bad, but during the holidays they can build up which is why they open up several other tables for coffee/hot chocolate.

Previous experiences were so-so at best, with both service and food not all that good. \\n   We arrived at the dinner hour on a hot summer Friday night, you know, the one's where eveerybody is dining out so as not to heat up the house cooking. Fortunately we were told it was only a 15-20 minute wait, an estimate that was right on.\\n   We were seated and asked about drinks in an appropriate amount of time and then served in timely fasion as well.\\n   We ordered a calamari appetizer, that was seasoned well and served with a lemon aoli. Unfortunately, once you've had properly cooked calamari, tender and juicy, anything not cooked properly is apparent. And this was a bit overcooked and rubbery. Not terrible, but definitely not great. Three stars because of the seasoning and aoli.\\n   Next were the main courses, My reportedly \\"fresh\\" razor clams and the wife's macadamia nut crusted halibut. Both entrees were served with a side of green beans and a baked potato.\\n   Starting with the wife's halibut, she said it was dry (probably overcooked). She poured the lemon butter atop it in an effort to make it more palatable and ended up using my tartar sauce on it, alas, to no avail. The potato was great but the beans were \\"woody\\". One Star.\\n   As to my razor clams, I'll start by saying I grew up in a family that dug our own razors on Washington's beaches from the time I was 4 or 5 years old and if there is one thing I dearly love to eat, it's fresh, panfired razor clams. That being said, I know a good clam from a bad clam and how to cook a great clam. Problem is McGraths evidently doesn't.\\n    I can truthfully say, without exageration, that these were the WORST razor clams I've ever been served, the cause of which is twofold. #1. They were WAY OVER BREADED. The ration of breading to clam was about four to one. Way too much panko leaving very little clam flavor and lots of butter flavor  #2. They were WAY OVERCOOKED and tough as shoe leather. I needed that knife to cut them. Are you seeing a trend of overcooking here? Again, One Star. \\n   As an added insult the price was $16.99 and for that I got two medium sized clams, not that it mattered much seeing as they were not very good.  One Star.\\n   My potato was the highlight of my meal and my beans were tough and woody too.\\n   All in all I'll stick with Red Lobster.

A gentleman took our drink order, appetizer order, and entree order, as well as dropped off the appetizer, within five minutes. Fresh baked bread and oil was served for free. The drinks were pretty small, and we didn't receive a refill (probably because of the traffic, but I didn't care to ask). We got the caprese, which was a lettuce and arugula salad with mozzarella, marinated tomatoes, and a large crouton. For dinner, I ordered the Chicken Parmigiana, and the boyfriend got the Lasagna Primavera. Both came out fresh baked in crocks, and they were HUGE. Really great flavor, and super nostalgic;it  felt like being in my Mammy's kitchen. The sauce is sweet and homemade, and the breadcrumbs on the chicken were legitimate Italian breadcrumbs, egg coating and all. \\nWhile it was a bit obnoxious to hear literally everything the drunk group next to us was talking about, the food was pretty great, and the atmosphere was lovely.

We were seated immediately and given menus immediately and offered water straight away. We ordered a pot of tea to share. I was a little disappointed in the tiny selection of teas, but they had a lot of decaf options which is pretty rare, so I can't complain too much.\\n\\nFirst course was scones and clotted cream. The scones were more like miniature biscuits; nothing special or remotely comparable to the holy grail of scones served at Cambridge Tea House. They weren't bad per se, just not very scone-y.

There were a wide variety - curried chicken salad (amazing!), smoked salmon, cucumber, mushroom, and then a larger ham and swiss sandwich. They were all delicious except the larger ham and swiss which was just meh.. kind of grocery store-ish, honestly. The other sandwiches made up for it, though.\\n\\nThird course was desserts.

So, I've hit up Standard Hall on 2 separate occasions.  The first time, I came in on a Friday night at around 10:30pm and it was a decent time.  There was no line when we got there but there was a very significant line by the time we left roughly an hour later.  I am not the kind of person who waits in line to get into a bar but if you are, Standard is pretty decent.  They have some cool drink options and the music was pretty good although it does get super crowded so it may be a while before you get in.  If you're more like me, you will want to check it out during the day time or on a weeknight when it isn't as much as night club but more of a restaurant.\\n\\nNow that I've said that, prepare yourself to likely be disappointed in Standard Hall as a restaurant.  My experience at SH was a comedy of errors.  To start off, I tried the boozy popsicle (bellini-flavored) and it was okay.  I wouldn't say it is worth $5 - maybe more like $3 but it was fun.  My friends liked their drinks as well so there's that. My water glass had a big hole in it and had a leak which I didn't notice at first.  There is no hostess presently so you seat yourself which means there's a decent wait before someone actually notices you and provides service.  I think a hostess would certainly help.  \\n\\nMy friends all ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and they all said it was pretty meh. I ordered the cheese coneys with NO onions because I get really sick when I eat onions and when I got my coneys I dove in and sadly there were onions one of the 2 coneys which was really disappointing.  I let the server know and she put in an order for a 2nd coney for me and when that coney came out, the gentleman who brought it dropped it on the floor so a third coney was brought out which was cool but by then my friends were all done eating so I felt rushed and didn't really enjoy it.  The coneys were tasty but probably not worth the hassle.  The menu itself doesn't have a lot of options and my gang and I agreed that if we ever return to SH it will be a \\"one drink move on to the next place\\" kind of visit.\\n\\nThe building itself is super cool and I love the steam-punk type decorum.

Only recently I have rediscovered its happy hour which takes place daily and even late night on Friday and Saturday.  I usually come here when I am with a group so that we can all try the various dishes Pambiche has to offer.  \\n\\nAs a great starter, the fried plantains are a guilty pleasure.  Sure it's not the healthiest option, but the sweet and soft texture with each bite is an addicting snack.  The Cuban sammich is usually my preferred main dish choice if happy hour is not an option.  It comes with regular plantains which I'm not a huge fan, but that is just my personal preference.  The sandwich arrives piping hot with the cheese and meat melted perfectly.  \\n\\nI think I learned when the best time to arrive for happy hour when its Friday or Saturday.  I probably shouldn't say otherwise it would make the happy hour crowd even more since its a popular venue hehe.  The menu is huge and extensive: 1 page for food and 1 page for drink specials.  Definitely get the sweet plantains, the fried chicken, and the fried pork.  I get the right amount of portions and feel just full enough for dessert after wards.  The chicken ($3.50) and pork ($5.00) doesn't have the greasy after taste like other places.  It's fried just right while maintaining the juicy flavor an seasonings with each dish.  You get a good size chicken piece for the price you are paying for.  The rice dish ($2.00) is a big steal and is seasoned with meat and spices that can pair well with the meat plates.  \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is small and can get crowded very fast.  I recommend groups no more than 6 due to the space size.  They have outdoor seating but can only seat a max of 4 people.  They have heated lamps so if you want to eat outside and it's cold, you will be OK for the most part.  The service is friendly and the plate arrive in a timely matter.
