Not impressed. It wasn't a particularly busy evening, but we waited forever for two burgers, cheese fries, and onion rings. Of the two burgers, only one was even warm. The cheese fries were a pitiful handful of fries on a large plate - they looked so sad and lonely - with some shredded cheese melted on top. They were cold. The onion rings - also cold - had a nice light batter, but were so oily that I ended up having to blot them with napkins. The flavors were good, or probably would have been if they were hot, but as it was, we won't be going back. Yes, I suppose we could have returned three-quarters of the meal, waited another twenty minutes, and gotten it in shifts, like the family at the next table, but we'd already been there almost an hour.To be fair, when I stopped on the way out and told the manager why we wouldn't be back, she did offer a refund - or rather, she asked if I was asking for my money back, which I wasn't. I just wanted to tell her why we wouldn't be returning.

A visit to South City Kitchen will leave you wanting more. Like many restaurants on Crescent Avenue in Midtown, South City Kitchen is actually a renovated house, and the cozy, homey feel is the perfect backdrop for the Southern cuisine served here. There is also patio dining, and an upstairs dining area, in addition to the main dining room. The main room is bustling with activity, and has a certain magic to it.It is the perfect place to partake of Southern cuisine in a trendy, high energy environment.Cornbread, biscuits, mashed potatoes, fried green tomatoes, grits...And it gets even better...The wine list is impressive, with many choices that I had not seen on other Atlanta restaurant wine lists.Wines by the glass are limited though there are bottles in the $30-40 range, if you are seeking a good value. The Old Charleston She Crab Soup is award winning, and the wait staff sings her praises. After you hear the song long enough, you ultimately feel an obligation to try it out. Definitely worth the money. This soup makes you taste buds even sing. Its a sad moment when you realize...That the soup is gone, and your cup is empty.Also highly recommended is the Maryland-Style Crab Cake with chow chow and creole mustard aioli. Talk about some good crab cakes...They have my vote! I once came here for a business dinner and was spoiled with mounds of endless crab cakes...I must have had at least 3. When I visited the 2nd time, i ordered the crab cake appetizer and realized that the appetizer consisted of 1 crab cake for 12.50. Definitely worth the spend-age...but, I had wished that there were at least 2. Did I mention that I love crab cakes?When it was time for dinner....I ordered  the famous Buttermilk Fried Chicken served with mashed potatoes, green beans and bourbon gravy. That proved to be a very good choice. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal....The presentation was artistic, and the taste lived up to its hype.Too full for dessert? Think Again!!!!  BANANA PUDDING layered with homemade \\"nilla wafers\\", banana pastry cream, \\nripe bananas and fresh cream. Don't be a fool. This is one dessert that you can't pass up. Tasty, fresh, and serioulsy delicious.If you are not familiar with the Crescent Avenue area of Midtown Atlanta, then you should be aware that it is a bustling entertainment district with many nightclubs and restaurants in the space of a few blocks. Parking can be found at one of the many lots surrounding the restaurant. If you are from the South and you have a craving for country food with an edge, South City Kitchen is a must-dine experience and a guaranteed great time.One Word: CozyFood: 5\\nAtmosphere: 5\\nService: 5Recommendations:\\nShe-Crab Soup\\nCrab Cake Appetizer\\nButtermilk Fried Chicken\\nBanana PuddingAll in All: Seriously A Life Changing Experience"},{"name":"Hunan Pearl","address":"15160 SW Bangy Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"Very nice people and j hate to leave this review.

He definitely lost out on a sale. For a sushi joint, I was surprised to find that they don't offer a market fish selection. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the nigiri is priced per two pieces as opposed per one. We ordered the shishito peppers and the lobster spring rolls. The peppers were amazing. Definitely my favorite part of the meal. We then ordered two rolls and lots of nigiri. Keeping this short and sweet... The fish is just not good quality. It's all clearly frozen.

I had the Mac n cheese of course, the catfish (add an extra dollar), and the German potato salad. My bf got the fried chicken and my bro got the brisket.  The Mac and cheese unfortunately did not deliver for me, only because I'm spoiled by Homeroom in Oakland, CA, which specializes in Mac and cheese entrees and is very good at it.  Screen Door's take on the Mac and cheese was a little bland and runny for me. I did like the top--a layer of baked cheesy goodness. As I write this I am feeling more and more remorseful for what I ate yesterday. I ran two miles this morning and that probably burned off 2 bites of what I had.  The beef brisket was good until we found a hair in it. They replaced the plate very quickly....Anyway, the dinner was good but not amazing.

I had to take on that monster, cobbled together from lesser corndog parts - three types of sausage (beef frank, kielbasa, and Italian sausage), battered and fried until a crispy brown crust forms.  It's alive!  Mwhahahaha!  Erm... how does one non-suggestively eat battered sausage of such girth?  Rhetorical question.  Pull out the corndog stick and knife & fork it.  Squeeze out some of that house-made sausage mustard.  Savor the flavors of each of the three sausages (Kielbasa was by far the best, Italian sausage had too much fennel).  We opted for fries done poutine style (cheese curds and gravy)... didn't have the fortitude or requisite antacids to go full on \\"garbage\\" style (cheese curds, gravy, cheese, onions, and peppers).  Not too bad, not too great - good gravy but the cheese curds had melted into unwieldy globs.No doubt, Pallookaville Fine Foods (what's so \\"fine\\" about it anyway?) was an experience worth having...if only just one time."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"If you go for only one thing, please get the crab and artichoke dip... you will not be disappointed.

I took quite a while to develop a discriminating pizza palate. Frankly I'll be pickier when it comes to coffee and beer but more tolerant due to their intoxicating qualities. Unfortunately when it comes to pizza there is no chemical ingredient that will absolve poor quality. Now I'm not saying I'm a pizza snob nor an expert but I've lived in the northeast for most of my life and I'm used to a slice of pizza being an inexpensive, quick, tasty way to grab lunch. Edgewood Pizza fails in each one of these categories in astounding fashion. Whoever said this place delivers in 30 minutes or less must live right around the corner because I've waited more than 30 minutes in the restaurant.  Allow me to break down the actual slice:Dough - If I could eat the pizza without the dough I would do itCheese - definitely not fresh, even a cheap slice should have some degree of fresh cheese, not worse than the dough but unflavorful and kinda staleSauce - actually not horrible and with a little kick, the sauce is the only reason they get A starBy the way doesn't anyone else take issue with the use of the phrase \\"King Slice\\" right around the corner from the MLK historic district? If you're gonna call it a \\"King Slice\\" you have to rival the size of a slice from Benny Tudino's in Hoboken and you should probably be at least more than 2 blocks from the gravesite of one of the greatest political figures in American history. Just so you know the King slice is just 2 slices in one box and the price of the king slice just went up by $1. Great more money for more bad pizza.Thanks for the heavy card stock, high gloss flyer in my door today guys. Maybe you should spend a little less on marketing and a little more on cheese."},{"name":"The Oakwood Canadian Bistro","address":"2741 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"What a great place that we finally got to try!

Despite having to wait for nearly an hour - that's ok, we anticipated that, but heads up you should too - we finally got to sit down and indulge in one of the better brunches we've had in Vancouver.First, the bar menu looks awesome. They use some really clever combinations and stuff you've likely never heard of. We were traveling/driving for the day, so we didn't indulge, but would absolutely say it's worth a visit for that alone. I loved everything about the brunch menu and I had a hard time deciding. I finally opted for the toast with pork belly and avocado ranch - three of my favorites - along with their homefries, which omg are amaze. They are so crispy and tasty.

That's a very important thing to note. For those who couldn't get a drink at the bar or flag down a waiter or waitress to put in a second drink order because they lack the initiative to use their vocal cords, I'm sorry. Next time say, \\"Hey Gordy, get me another beer!\\" or simply use your hand to wave down a waitress, I'm sure they'll be happy to help, just like a friend would be. A place like Cypress St. isn't going to be bugging you every 5 minutes to order another drink; and thank god for that.\\n  Next time you go, ask for your waiter's or the bartender's name and use it. That's why they gave it to you.FOOD: Freaking Phenomenal\\nPersonal favorites are the Sliders for an appetizer and the French Dip with Onion Rings for my main.\\nIn all honestly, I've eaten nearly everything on the menu and have never received a bad dish.DRANK: Rotating Taps keep it Non-boring\\nThe fact that I can go in every week and have to actually review the beer list is nice. It's not like Taco Mac where you might as well just throw a dart at the menu and pick something random; the bartenders and staff generally understand beer and the nuances therein and can make a good recommendation to suit your tastes. Not sure? Ask for a sample, they'll be happy to oblige. (See, asking for stuff's not hard).SERVICE: Friendly and Non-annoying\\nThankfully for a regular like myself, they're not pushing drinks onto me every five minutes (as previously stated).

This was one of the most anticipated openings of the year, with a central location super close to the T, a great concept, and such high reviews on here I was super excited to try it out.We arrived and were brought to a nice and well-let area under the greenhouse area surrounded by pretty succulents.  The decor in our area was nice and simple but under the greenhouse area it was a bit toasty and humid.We ordered some drinks (which took about 10-15 minutes to arrive....I'm not sure how crowded the bar was but it was quite a long wait for 1 beer and 1 cocktail...) and placed our orders. I ordered a cup of tea as I wasn't feeling all that great.  A mug arrived, but was dirty and had brown remnants at the bottom which my fiance luckily noticed before I poured my tea.  I was given a new mug but was already a bit nervous and uneasy at this point.They arrived with some pickled green beans which were a nice change from bread, nicely pickled and a hint of salt, but I may be partial because I looove pickles.We started with the smoked cashews (which tasted like they were smoked with pork/bacon of some sort or just Smothered in bacon fat...the currants were a nice change but it literally tasted like we were eating slice on slice of bacon, which it did not mention on the menu). They were salty and so heavy with the meaty flavor.Next we had the Kale Salad (which was the best thing of the night.) and the grilled cauliflower caponata (which was MASSIVe for a \\"snack\\" but was good, a bit overly garlicy and salty, but 2nd best thing of the night).  Also the charred broccoli which had a strange sweet hummus-like consistency underneath...underwhelming.Then we had 2 orders of the mushrooms with egg....which was far too salty. the pine nut crumble was the only change in consistency but I couldn't call it a crumble....it wasn't as crunchy as it could be, and I liked the pine nuts more than anything else because they weren't little salt bombs, like everything else we had.We had 2 orders of the market catch (black bass) which were decent, the finishing salt was STRoNG on this one, and this portion was MUCH smaller than the other very large portions (this was even smaller than some of the \\"snacks\\").  My main issue with this is the fact that the tiny chunk of potato was undercooked....hmm, no thanks, also paired with some sort of balsamic sunchoke which I was not a big fan of.The oyster gratin was massive and PIPING HOT when it came out (without a warning), luckily we used our eyes and saw the mega steam, or else we would have for sure scalded ourselves.  it was a bit like a clam chowder with cheese, and similar bread to that that was served with the cauliflower \\"snack\\". We also had the \\"secret burger\\" which was reportedly similar to a big mac with a mega fluffy (and SALTY again) bun, and a cheese crisp. This was somehow also salty but was decent.At this point all of the dishes were taken away as I waited for my mesquite tortillini...we asked and were told it was coming...about 15 minutes later our server returned and said they were firing it now....firing it now? I ordered it at the very beginning and by this point we had been there for an hour and a half...how long could it take to fire a round of tortillini? I'm pretty sure that would be one of the quickest things to send out! Finally, it came. 5 little \\"tortillini\\" that looked as if they were fried. I saw NO broccoli, i saw kale....and perhaps a DOT of mesquite...it was one of the worst things i've had, overly salty, DOUSED in cheese, and garlic....and the dot of bbq. no thank you. i actually could not eat this, i had 2.After all of this we had been checked in on by our server maybe 2x over the course of almost 2 hours, never asked if we wanted anything else, once we flagged someone down we were able to get drink refills (after 10-15 minutes). All of our orders were unbelievably salty. I LOVE SALT, I eat chips and pickles on a daily basis because I LOVE salt, but so many of these dishes were ruined by the over-salting, some things were even inedible. But no server ever asked if anything was wrong, nor did they even offer to comp anything after they had forgotten my tortillini (which was inedible)...and it was obvious they forgot as other items we ordered later in the meal came before my tortillini and the tortillini was added lastly on the receipt as if it was just thrown on there.Overall, definitely not impressed. I had high expectations, yes, but many of these items were almost inedible due to the EXCESSIVE SALTING OF EVERYTHING.  The menu descriptions were loosely based on the food, with main components not even mentioned, and varying portions with some of the \\"snacks\\" being larger than the regular sized plates. The cocktails were strong and decent but took forever.  Service was NOT good, extremely slow and lackadaisical.

We ordered the shrimp ceviche (thanks for the heads up, Jason) as well as a chile relleno with red sauce and vegetarian enchiladas with green sauce - both a la carte (since this place is a little pricey, the a la carte option saves you a lot of money). The red sauce was made with nicely roasted tomatoes and the tartness of the tomatillos really came through in the green sauce. Also, they didn't skimp on the cheese. Very delicious!All the ingredients tasted extremely fresh and the food was obviously made to order. Looking around the room it seemed like everyone dining had cleaned their plates. There is actual thought that went into the design of this menu. They chose vegetables that go perfectly in wrapped food.

It drives us nuts when you go to a Mexican place and try to order something like this and you get carrots and broccoli. I'm sorry - that's just wrong. All of the food we tried had a touch of tex-mex, but to an elevated degree. It's obvious there is a chef in the back as opposed to some random cook.There were a few kinks in the service but it was obvious a lot of the wait staff was new and they were very quick in resolving issues.

So nice of her!Ambiance: My favorite kind of Ambiance- a little bit noisy but not to a point where it's unbearable.Food: We started out with sweet potato dumplings. Growing up in an asian household, I would expect dumplings to be cooked balls of dough but this dish was an explosion of flavors. There's the sweet, the salty, and the sour all nicely blend into one. The salty mushrooms blends greatly with the pickled pears, and porkbelly and the best part was that the gnocchi was so chewy. Love me some fried chicken! Obviously, I had to choose the buttermilk fried chicken. Afterall, this is what I was looking forward to the entire trip! Just like what I expected, the fried chicken is delicious. The fried chicken was not oily at all, the meat was really tender and it paired nicely with the spinach. We also shared the shrimp & red mule grits. We told the waitress that we're sharing when it ordered and when the order came, they split the order for us which I think it was really thoughtful of them so we didn't have to go through all the hassle of cutting the chicken etc. \\nThe shrimp was fresh, it wasn't like those frozen shrimps. The grits were a little spicy but it adds to the overall flavor. Overall, it was probably the best grits that I've ever had. And of course with all that food there was no room for dessert. Next time!

She called out for her coworker who came from the back to take our order. Both of them looked equally grumpy. The one who took our order had to scream at us and actually got the order wrong because she couldn't hear us over the music. My father commented \\"wow the music is really loud\\"and we were informed that \\"that's the way they like it\\", referring to the kitchen staff, I assume. Um... what about your customers?We sat by the window until our order came, and then we moved upstairs because it was a little quieter. My dad and I both love loud music, regular club goers, but this was too much... there's a time and place! between the service and having to shout over the music to have a conversation with my father, I am dubious about returning.

Great hot dogs, cool atmosphere, friendly staff, can't recommend it enough.I went on a Saturday afternoon around 2:30 and there was a pretty decent crowd but seating was available at tables and at the bar.  The restaurant is pretty small though so seating may be an issue if you come during lunch.  The location is not bad, but it kinda stands on its own.  Dirty Franks is located on 4th St one block north of Main.  I wish it was a little closer to the Short North/Arena District, but that's just my own bias.I had the \\"Whoa Nellie\\" which is a hot dog with beef brisket and BBQ sauce and a side of their hand cut fries.  They have a wide variety of hot dogs with some unusual toppings, including cream cheese!  You can substitute a brat, italian sausage, or a veggie dog if that's more your speed.  Most of the items on the menu can be made veggie or vegan if desired.Like I said, the dog was great and the fries were very good as well.  The price was great as well, I think the total for the two of us (two hot dogs, fries, and one drink) was right around $10.  I'd love to try some of their other sides too, the mac and cheese sounded really good.Dirty Franks also has a full bar and is open until 2 am.  I think the location hurts them a little from the bar stand point but if I'm ever down in the area it seems like a really place to stop in for a drink or two.I'll definitely be back!"},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"This is really 4.5 stars.

They were nice about moving us, but sometimes that is not an option if they are too full.

You can get a kiddo a simple cheese quesadilla or rice and beans for $2.95 which is good for the unadventurous small person. My kid has since graduated and will eat an enormous chicken quesadilla  dunked in spicier salsa if the place is good.

Lemme tell you a few things about this place. First off, you walk in and it's beautiful! Very cool, chic design. You can tell the designers spent their time here wisely and made some good, interesting and provocative decisions. From the bright colors, colored glass, and comfy chairs to the wood beams suspended in mid air above, this place has everything. It's visually stunning. But enough about the looks, let's get down to the nitty gritty, THE FOOD!The food there was absolutely DELICIOUS. I had the 10 oz Contra Filet with rice, beans, and mashed potatoes. The meat was tasty and juicy and the chimi churri sauce added the perfect finishing touches to such a good filet. It was a very hearty meal and for a VERY good price! Anywhere else you might pay around $32 for this steak! This bad boy cost LESS than HALF that amount! The portions are just right - not too much, not too little. They also had some great Brazillian Guava cheesecake options for dessert. My wife had that and she really enjoyed it. I took a lil bite from her's and indeed it was everything a cheesecake should be. Very good. I, however, decided to be boring and have some vanilla ice cream, but that was awesome too. And they topped it off with chocolate syrup (they have other syrup options too such as raspberry). So even with dessert this place knows how to stay on top of things. The service at Giraffas was also very good. The staff members were polite and patient with us. They were also helpful and attentive. I have NO complaints about this place and have no doubt that I'll be back soon! The burgers look delicious so I think I'l try one next time.

Absolutely perfect.Getting back to the crowds, for your first visit, I recommend you try a quieter time, like a Monday or Tuesday night.  Friday and Saturday afternoons and nights are almost always jammed during the school year and holidays, so if that's when you go, just do so expecting to wait 15 minutes or so to get in.

They were small, fluffy, chewy and so warm. Great on a gray chilly day! The masa on the tamale made me so happy. My biggest complaint about tamales is that the masa tends to be dry. While other places may have better filling, this tamale had nice salty pork and very moist, soft, dense masa around it. There's only outdoor seating on sturdy plastic picnic tables that seat 4 and a few chairs up against the side of the food cart.

Every dish seems to be an interesting combination of ingredients and styles. We both ordered appetizers and entrees, but no drinks.Shortly thereafter, the waitress brought some bread with three different spreads. Things were looking good. However, before we could even taste the bread, the appetizers arrived. This couldn't have been more than 10 minutes after ordering. Well, who knows, it wasn't very busy, being a Sunday, perhaps the folks in the kitchen were feeling a bit over-eager.So we munched on the appetizers and the bread for, again, no more than 5 minutes, before our entrees arrived. So now we've got our appetizers not even half-eaten, and our entrees sitting in front of us getting cold, and of course the bread. I don't know if they thought we were in a hurry (we certainly didn't give any indication that we were), or they for some reason wanted us gone quickly. Either way, absolutely horrid pacing.The food itself was mixed. The appetizers were fantastic, and reasonably priced. The entrees were too expensive, and bland-tasting. This was surprising, given the interesting descriptions on the menu.Based on our experience, I certainly won't go back. Maybe they'd be better for tapas, given the speed at which things came out, and the fact that the appetizers were so much better than the entrees.The food quality and pacing issues would have given this a 3 star review for me, in the end.

It was pretty chilly so the wait to get a table inside was 40min, but the heated patio was no wait. The heating was more than sufficient to be comfortable.Service was very attentive and charismatic even when it was very busy.The Texas fries honestly looked like it came out of a microwave...kinda tasted like it too. The brisket and jalape√±o was the only decent thing about it. I'd recommend against it.I really like that they give you a choice to get fatty or lean pieces of brisket. It just makes sense because some people may want to avoid the fat to have \\"healthier\\" BBQ, whatever that means. But the fatty brisket was very tender so I'd recommend that because it doesn't get dried out like the lean brisket. The roasted wings were way better than I expected, had a great smokiness that spread throughout your mouth and the depth of flavor grows on you.I wish they used thicker and crispier bread like community q to be honest. It felt and tasted like a regular slice of white bread. (Side note: I never really understood why they pile the meat on top of a slice of bread, because the meat juices and steam make it soggy and just altogether unappealing. I just feel that if the bread isnt substantial enough to compliment the meat, it's more like a chore to get through than something to savor as well.)The Fox-a-roni an interesting mix of Brunswick stew and Mac and cheese. The Brunswick stew was sweet and savory while the Mac and cheese was buttery. Personally I'd prefer to have them separate. The Cole slaw was a bit bland but was refreshing so it served its purpose. I know it sounds like I'm bashing on the place but the BBQ itself is really quite good, so for doing well at what it's supposed to and for great service I think it's a great place for BBQ!"},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I can't get enough of this place and crave it now.

It's not even obvious that it's in business unless you happen to drive by during the lunch rush and see the line extending out the door and onto the sidewalk.This little corner grocery store has been there forever (I first went there 14 years ago, and it was there long before that) and has been the winner of numerous awards for \\"Best Cuban Sandwich\\" in Atlanta as given by the various periodicals.  In recent years they've raised their prices a little as well as added a real menu that hangs on the wall (previously you just had to know what they served!).  There's really not much else in the \\"grocery\\" store that you'll probably want besides a drink or possibly some chips.  Their main business is derived from their lunchtime sandwich sales.  Some claim that real Cuban sandwiches don't have jalapenos or lettuce, but hey, I've never been to Cuba (something about a trade embargo).  Plus, I also hear something about all that Mexican stuff we eat being fake.  So I just can't get hung up over a few peppers and some shredded iceberg.There's no place to sit, so it's only to-go.  There's a picnic table outside, but on nice days, it'll be hard to find empty.  As the area continues to improve with the advent of Atlantic Station and the renaissance in Midtown, I'm sure they'll eventually be pocket parks and other outside spots to walk to to eat your sandwich.  But the question remains, will Kool Korners survive the urban renewal?  Maybe they'll have a chance to relocate close by, but it definitely won't be the same.

I was on a mission to find out. For the last leg of my Portland trip, me and my friends decided to try out Screendoor. The wait was about two hours during lunch time on a Sunday afternoon. Although it was long, there were many little quirky and fun shops to check out around the block that help pass the time. Plenty of cool coffee shops, a Whole Foods down the block and even a Starbucks, so don't feel confined to just waiting outside the establishment! Once seated, it was time to feast! Coming from L.A., we have our own version of the famous chicken and waffles, Roscoe's! I LOVE Roscoe's and I'm a devoted fan but I have to admit, Screendoor gives Roscoe's a run for their money. I loved the interior design and the atmosphere. We sat outside in the patio area and it was absolutely stunning. The ambiance was great. Me and my gf decided to have mimosas which were perfectly made. We then had the praline bacon as an appetizer which was amazing since I've never seen such a thing before. For the main course I had the one piece chicken and waffle, and let me tell you, it was absolutely glorious. The chicken was tender and juicy while the waffle was a perfect balance between savory and sweet. Everything is priced accordingly as well.

She was obviously in pain and we took her back to IVG one night at midnight so she wouldn't have to suffer until regular business hours at our normal vet.

I still remember when it was a simple fruit stand that I walked to weekly, my wee little hand in that of my father's.But that was then and with the amazing fruit stand long gone, I now gingerly enter what is now known at the Arlington Diner. When you first opened your doors, I was bit skeptical since you had just replaced a cherished childhood place with a greasy diner where a few of the workers smoke weed out back on their breaks. In wife beaters stained with grease, the constant view of waiters and cooks smoking by the dumpsters isn't really something most diners would like to see right before entering your establishment.On two separate occasions, I tried to order the manicotti. One time was around 3:30 and I got it without incident. The second time was around 3:30 again and the waitress said that they didn't start the broiler until 4:30. For this, I was confused and I asked the waitress when I had been able to order it before 4:30 before. She just shrugged and walked away.The service is sub par, the prices expensive and the food boring. The servers are constantly chatting each other up or flirting with customers while ignoring their own. The wait staff looked like they'd rather be anywhere but there. On more than one occasion, my food has come out cold or just not at all until I talked to a manager. The food has been wrong and once, could have killed. I'm allergic to nuts and I ordered a menu item that normally came with nuts. I specified numerous times that I didn't want nuts on the plate. And what was on the plate when it came out? Nuts. Then, they just scraped off the nuts and thought all was fine and dandy. But no, even traces of nuts can cause me to have an allergic reaction. I didn't eat it and refused to pay.And on the topic of the food, where to start? It's bland and not exciting. I normally love diners and diner food but this place, the food is just mediocre. The food is either cold or way too hot. The one time I ordered a burger with fries, the fries were soggy and tasteless, and the burger? The cheese wasn't even melted, it was that cold. Of all the times I, or a dining partner, have ordered eggs, they come out runny and usually not the way the patron ordered them.One time, there was a rather large party trying to pay while I was eating there. The whole time I was eating, about 30 minutes, the large party was still trying to sort out the bill. They all wanted to pay separately or at least have the bill divided up amongst the different couples the group was composed of. Their waitress seemed utterly confused as to why they would want separate bills or how to do it. The cashier was looking at the register like it had three heads and spoke perfect Russian. They obviously had no clue what they were doing.Also, the owner/manager lady constantly brings her dog into the restaurant, letting the wait staff and the cooks pet said dog, and then go right back to preparing and serving food. The dog was also allowed to run around the kitchen. I refused to return after this.Despite the fact that it's about a block away from my house, I refuse to go there. I wouldn't wish the servers or the food on my worst enemies."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is the real deal.

The manager recognized that we had returned and acknowledged us with a free appetizer. They have tremendous food and amazing customer service! I will be back when I visit Atlanta again!

While SSC doesn't threaten to take away the title belt from Harry's in my mind, it's still a fun spot worth checking out for dinner or some drinks. The pros:- Large (you will be stuffed) portions of solidly good Chinese food. Some people have complained its not the most traditional fare, but the steamed buns (with duck), the spicy short rib noodle bowl, and the sesame chicken all hit the spot for me. \\n- A fun drink menu (scorpion bowls, mai-tais, and other rum and fruit concoctions abound). And sometimes a man just wants his drink in a hollowed out Buddha with a fruit garnish, know what I mean?\\n- Not your run of the mill bar environment. I may prefer the low-key, hits of the 90's atmosphere at Harry's for my every day dining and drinking, but the loungey, techno, over the top Asian style of Shanghai Social Club is a nice departure from the norm. The cons (or why I docked them a star):- The prices are a little higher than I might expect, but only a scoach. Cocktails run around $10. \\n- The only item we had I didn't think was up to snuff was the ribs... a little too fatty, too tender, and maybe a bid overloaded with sauce.I'll definitely be back, and for the moment, I'm not worried about finding a table.

If there was a hazelnut anywhere on that halibut, you could have fooled me but there was a sauce on there that tasted like something that sat in a compost pile for a week with mangoes in it I think.  The halibut tasted old and so did the salmon, as if they just picked it up at Safeway.  The bland potatoes were similar to the ones a sick relative was recently served for dinner at Kaiser Hospital, 4 chewy asparagus, some so so sour dough bread, a beverage and a bill of almost $100.00!   I have dined in many fine restaurants and can honestly say that the chef had absolutely no imagination or creativity in creating these overpriced dishes.  This place is terribly overpriced and the food was bland and tasteless. We felt totally ripped off and would never recommend this restaurant to anyone who was a friend.

The wait is worth it if you are with the right people and/or have entertainment of some sort for the (usually) 1.5-2 hour wait. If you want to get your barbecue by around noon you should get to Franklin at 10am (on weekdays). On weekends, breaks, days in tandem with festivals (i.e. SXSW) you should plan on getting to Franklin's earlier (9-9:30am). While waiting a person will come by with a clipboard and ask what you're ordering. Don't panic. They're just getting an estimate of how much of each item people are ordering that say and they'll explain the menu to you if you need it. That same person will come around to tell you the approximate wait time to expect when Franklin opens as well, which is nice.Warning: For those of you who don't know (and I don't know how you wouldn't know but just in case) Franklin stops serving barbecue as they run out (which is why you need to get there early). Food: In my opinion the pork ribs and brisket are the things to get. The ribs ($14 a lb) are literally fall off the bone tender and simply delicious. I could definitely eat these by themselves without any sides or sauce and there's also a good amount of meat so you'll be getting more for your money. Basically it's a must have.\\nOf course their famous brisket is a must try as well (though to be honest I'd be happy with just the ribs). You get a choice between fatty and lean (both cost $16 a lb) and both are really good so it just depends on your preference (the fatty being more juicy but the lean having a more concentrated flavor).\\nThe pulled pork and sausage were good too, but in my opinion getting more ribs and/or brisket is a better option unless you really want to sample everything. You can go for the sides if you want a change of pace/flavor but I don't think it's really worth it. Things I've yet to try is their Tipsy Texan ($8), a large sandwich filled with chopped meats, sausage, and optional coleslaw (no extra charge).The wait is long, the barbecue is a bit expensive, the place is hyped up, but the food is delicious and definitely worth it."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My boyfriend and I wandered here one Saturday night in search of a low key dinner and we had a half off depot gift certificate, so we decided to check this place out.

I was prepared to write a good review, since I first ate at Pazzo shortly after it opened about a year ago.  Then, the service was great and the food even better.  My, how things have changed.  This was the only time in my life I have left no tip for the waiter, who consistently either ignored us or was rude to us.  \\"Just a minute\\" was his clearly \\"I am annoyed and I'm not going to even pretend that I'm not\\" response when after much delay, I (very!) politely told him that we were ready to order.  Yikes!  Then he just walked away and several minutes went by before he returned, clearly still annoyed.  He never checked on us after the food arrived; failed to bring the complimentary bread that other diners received (even after we asked specifically for it); failed to check on our drinks (an excellent way for a restaurant to lose money, by not allowing customers to order more drinks!!).  After waiting for-EVER for our check, I asked to speak to the manager.  She seemed shocked by my complaint, but then the people at the table next to ours whom I did not know chimed in and told her that they, too, had been treated rudely by this waiter.  Still seeming shocked, the manager apologized and indicated that she would \\"take care of it.\\"  However, this \\"taking care of it\\" did not include taking anything off of our bill, or offering free drinks, etc., that one would expect from an establishment that values its customers and wants them to return.  Oh, and the food?   It was mediocre, and certainly not good enough to overcome the offensive service.  We had the calamari, which was pretty tasteless and overwhelmed by the batter-fried peppers and capers that came with it.  In short, I won't be back to Pazzo."},{"name":"Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm not here to judge whether Fox Bros is 'legit bbq', but the food they serve more than earns its keep. I been there numerous times, and every time there has been at least a 20 minute wait. Do not be dismayed by that, for the food has always been worth the wait. The best food they have is a tie between the Brisket and the Deep Fried Ribs. The Fried Ribs offer an unique experience that I have yet to encounter in any other establishment. The wonderful flavor of a savory rib is wrapped perfectly within a slightly salty crunchy exterior. Once you bite through the golden flaky breading, the supple meat falls off the bone. As for the Brisket, normal brisket is something you can find in every single bbq shop, but Fox Bros is able to take that common food and make it truly special. First of all, the Brisket served here is the tenderest and most flavorful brisket I have ever encountered. Upon picking up a single sliver of Brisket, it pulls itself apart under its own weight before even reaching your mouth, letting half fall back onto the pate. The fats melt evenly on your tongue while charred rims of the Brisket add just a pinch a spice to the mix. Everything about these two items stands above anything else on the menu. Really, this is a must visit gem in Atlanta."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I never had brisket until about a year ago when I moved to Texas for 4 months.

Tons of black pepper for black pepper lovers. Seems like they over baked it in the oven as it came out burnt. They used some cream in the dish...like creme Fraiche to mask and add moisture to the over cooked and burnt beef. There was more hash (also over cooked and dry) than beef so the ratio wasn't great. Dish came with tortillas making it a carb overload dish. Decor is unique, super busy. Staff is nice. The only thing is that they wore regular clothes like patrons so you couldn't tell who was a staff memeber thus finding it hard to flag someone down for assitance.

The front of the house hustled to accommodate how many tables they had. Now maybe it was because I was starving or cranky but the only reason I was upset about the less than the usual amazing service was because my number one pet peeve was happening. My other brunch companion and I were drinking coffee. If I watch you whiz by my table numerous times filling up other cups and ignoring mine I'm about to slap someone. Finally after it happening for a good 15 minutes and numerous times I couldn't take it anymore. I walked up to the manager and politely just let her know my grievance I was having. I felt like an asshole and I even told her that. Despite me complaining about the stupidest thing she was so sweet and understanding. She comped our drinks and gave us a gift certificate and thanked us for being regulars. Which was a smart move, we will definitely be returning, partly because we have a gift certificate but also how she handled the situation.I have to say this to the owners of the establishment: 1. Your manager is money, she always is on top of shit, keep her around for sure. 2.

I can usually take it or leave it.  To be honest, I don't really like getting dirty while I eat. So it takes a lot for me to roll my sleeves up and slather my hands with sauce.I really enjoyed the ribs at Fat Matt's. This was the first time I thought \\"hmm, maybe there's something to this barbecue thing after all\\". My husband is a BBQ nut and has been trying to get me to see his point of view for years. These ribs were tasty and tender and I really liked the sauce. The sauce is a bit sour and zingy and seems to have horseradish in it. I don't like sweet BBQ sauce, so this was great for me. I like spicy and/or vinegary barbecue sauces.There were a few of us dining, so we ordered the baked beans, macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and potato salad as our sides. I enjoyed them all. They were all pretty standard dishes, but cooked competently and tasted good.I agree with Gretchen O. about the pointy bits in the ribs, though. I was confronted with bony bits and gristle a few times and didn't know what I was supposed to do. I'm a rib newb, I guess.

After two years of talk, we woke up early prepared our take-a-longs and waited in the infamous Franklin's line.We arrived at 7am on a Friday and were about 20th in line. The community presence was awesome; everyone had an excitement and happiness about just being in that line. We saw a group of dads with strollers making mimosas, we saw an older couple in from out of town and the list of cultural differences went on and on. We were all there on the same mission. About 9am a gal came around and started taking orders to ensure how much food would be available for the folks in line. We immediately felt the pressure to order and abundance and hoped we were able to taste everything. 9 pounds, we said. Now to wait just a few more hours for the doors to open...Surprisingly time passed quickly. We chatted with neighbors, ventured inside to buy some schwag and use the restroom. Every hour or so a gal came but with a bucket of various drinks and coozies. I must say, the treatment was stellar. Nothing over the top but just a general heartfelt interest in their patrons. This alone would bring me back again and again.Now on to the goods. It's the brisket you really want to read about. Right? As our meat was being cut the gentleman handed us a handful of bite sized peices and said \\"here, share with the line.\\"  That must have been the most delicate bite of brisket to ever hit my tastebuds. The perfect bark and most impressive melt in yo' mouth action to ever occur. But were we just hungry? Were we just drunk on the excitement of being inside the doors of this meat mecca? It's true folks. This brisket is life changing. An arguable second place winner were the ribs. The simple flavors and perfect balance of spice and moisture scream loud with every bite as it falls off the bone. Honorable mentions: turkey, pulled pork and sausage. I did say we wanted to try everything and that we did. Cheers Aaron, Benji and Team! You're definitely doing something right.

This is seriously the best brunch in Portland. Unfortunately, if you want to do it on a weekend, you're going to end up waiting 45+ minutes. My preference it to go about 30 minutes before they open, stand in the line that has already formed out the door, and get in the first seating at around 15 minutes after. That is, that was my preference before they started doing breakfast EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK!Now I save my Screen Door breakfast cravings for the occasional days when I'm not working. If you get there early enough, there isn't a line, and the food is just as fabulous as it is on the weekend. I highly recommend the chicken and waffles, and I usually do a sub for the praline bacon waffle (instead of the sweet potato). The fried chicken is amazing, and if you get the waffle + 3 chicken breast option, you can eat if for your next two meals as leftovers! Most recently I ate their fried chicken sandwich, which was also fabulous. If you don't get the praline bacon waffle, the side of praline bacon is great on its own as well. Everything I've had there is pretty solid. I do prefer Screen Door's breakfast over their dinner, but both are good. It's pretty loud and busy inside. There is a bar that you might be asked to sit at if you aren't picky, and they also have additional seating in the outdoor covered porch area.

Instead, I did not finish my meal which rarely ever happens. We moseyed on up to the bar to try and salvage the evening. We just wanted to sit outside and enjoy the evening on the waterfront. Obviously, this was a bad choice for location..we were surrounded by obnoxious groups of people. It must have been a Gap convention...I've never seen so many men in khakis....and I hate when men wear khakis...there were more tools there than in my basement.

There was another guy giving orders to the girls because he noticed people were starting to pile in at the hostess stand but he nor the manager actually went to help get the people seated.So first impression was bad.  Our drinks were worse.  I ordered a Long Island and it was the most watered down drink ever.  Then I said \\"self try something else maybe it'll be better\\".  So I ordered a sangria.  Another bad decision.  It was watered down as well.  Why do I come here?  Honestly.  It's the mozzarella sticks.  Probably the most ridiculous answer ever but I just enjoy them.

I have no doubt whatsoever that, if you remove the sheer volume component that affects overall quality, small batches of Franklin's are probably out of this world.

Also, the pricing is AFFORDABLE for quality ramen. Although I would definitely hesitate to say it's on par noted east and west coast establishments, I think that Tatsu-Ya is great in general, not just \\"good for Texas.\\"The first time was fantastic! I ordered Miso-Hot and added pork belly to it because I just couldn't resist. The broth was perfect and the spicyness was just right, enough to pack a nice flavor punch but not overwhelming to where I couldn't taste my food anymore. I've never had ramen with noodles so thin before though. It was kind of odd to me at first, and I think I prefer the thicker noodles for maximum slurpage. I'm not sure what it was exactly about the 2nd time, but I did feel like it didn't live up to our first experience. I even got the same thing. When we went last Saturday, my group and I (incl. 2 who went the first time with me) agreed that the broth was significantly richer and thicker, which made it difficult to attempt finishing it. While I like a nice, rich broth, it was definitely thicker than the first time when I slurped the entire bowl. Also, I did find a 6-8 in piece of hair in mine and discreetly mentioned it to a server who apologized and told me he'd \\"find out whose it is and kill them.\\" Meh, hair happens, it's not like Travis county requires hair nets, and I've had it happen in my own kitchen so it wasn't too big of a deal.Ramen's not something I'd eat all the time, but I'm sure I'll be back once the weather starts getting colder again.

I think the owner (Marco) wants to save money by not hiring bartenders, and just having his waiters alternate going up to the bar and taking orders. Which is a little absurd, between placing our order and getting our food, it was easily 40+ minutes. Our waiter didn't come by to ask us for refills or ask how the food was once during our meal. When we finished, we all ordered cappuccinos. 30 minutes had gone by and by then we realized he had forgotten about us, we had to flag down someone else. The food is very good, homemade Italian.

Big parties should seek eggs and bacon elsewhere. The decor is cute and colorful, it definitely has the feel of a neighborhood place. In the cooler they have an exhaustive selection of bottled root beer and fancy soda - if you are a connoisseur of such things it's worth a visit. The service was quick and friendly - sometimes a bit too eager as at the end our drinks were taken away before we finished some of them. The food was pretty good, though I didn't think the portion sizes quite matched up with the prices. I had the Gypsy Omelet, which came with a pretty small bit of homefries and a couple pieces of toast - it ran me around $11.

There is complimentary valet service, and the restaurant interior is well-decorated (although not well-lit). Overall, a great place for a romantic date - there is also bar seating available.Let me start with the good part: food. We ordered the Brie and Crab Cakes to start, the Angus Filet Mignon (medium rare) to share, and an Ice Cream Sandwich to finish. We both don't eat a lot, so one appetizer and one entree is usually enough food for the two of us. The order came with a complimentary side of delicious focaccia bread. \\n- Brie: The plate comes with a cut of brie, apricot preserves, and toasted bread. I honestly can't distinguish the quality of cheese after a certain threshold. To me, there's cheese I want to eat and cheese that I don't. It's not that difficult to fall into the first category. The brie at Aria is definitely a cheese I want to eat - and finished. It was delicious with the apricot and toasted bread (very crispy crust but soft center). It was a great starter. However, the apricot preserves taste just like Smuckers apricot preserves (which is my go-to at home, so I'm very accustomed to the taste). Nothing wrong with that.\\n- Crab Cakes: This was my favorite part of the meal. The crab cakes are an appetizer, but it's enough to be an entree for those with smaller appetites. The order comes with 2 small crab cakes and a side of apple pecan salad. There is no shortage of crab meat in the cakes, and I love the fried exterior that adds the perfect crunch. The sweet and fresh apple pecan salad pairs well with the cakes in both texture and flavor. I would definitely order this again.\\n- Angus Filet Mignon: Pretty straightforward - steak with a side of brussel sprouts and butternut squash puree. The steak was tender and cooked to my liking (medium rare), and the brussel sprouts were amazing (not overcooked or overseasoned). A classic choice.\\n- Chocolate-Espresso Ice Cream Sandwich: Obviously dessert. The espresso ice cream (with specks of chocolate) is sandwiched between chocolate biscuits (?) with a side of hard hazelnut toffee. It is a dessert with a variety of textures and flavors. Not too heavy, and delicious!So service... There could be many reasons for the poor service from our server that night - our race, age, sexual orientation, his mood, miscommunication, etc. Who knows? He could honestly be the best server who was in a terrible mood. We are both Asian and in our early/mid 20s, and this doesn't work in our favor with servers that stereotype (regardless of restaurant). We had a few issues throughout our dining experience:\\n- Few check-ins, and extremely difficult to wave down the server throughout the meal (not a huge issue in general)\\n- Requested a box for our leftover steak, but the person clearing the tables (not our server) took our leftovers and never brought it back\\n- Asked, \\"Do you guys do anything for birthdays?\\" and the server replied, \\"Yeah, you have to choose a dessert though.\\" Thus, we ordered a dessert. Turns out it's not complimentary. This would be completely fine - classic miscommunication - but the server was extremely rude and replied with an attitude when we asked about the charge for the dessert.\\n- The server returned with an updated check where he comped the dessert. An action that would have completely redeemed him, if he hadn't continued to explain the situation with an attitude - emphasizing how we shouldn't have gotten it for free, but he did us a favor (repeated this 2-3x to us).I assume this is a one-off scenario based on the other reviews. However, I never plan on going back. I can find food and service of better quality elsewhere."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Ugh, this place is so pretentious. You don't eat pork, well tough. They refuse to not serve a dish that has bacon as one of the side items without the bacon. Just leave the bacon off. I know what your thinking, was the bacon integrated in something like a casserole or a quiche. No, it literally was just an item placed on the plate next to a number of other items also just placed on the plate. Instead they suggest a completely different meal, a veggie version of eggs Benedict. Original choice eggs, pankcakes, bacon, and I believe one other side but may be mistaken. Maybe just be me, but these seem in two different directions and a weird suggestion for someone who said they were really looking forward to pancakes.

We have a few favorites that I would recommend (stick to the usual Italian pastas/pizza that involve marinara) my husband loves the fried mozzarella cheese as an App its a lot of cheese but the right amount of stringiness.  We love the pizza (they are huge), Pasta with Meatballs, Shrimp Scampi, Mussels and again the garlic knots/rolls are ammmmmaaazzzing.

They did a great job moving us to an outside table where things were much better but the food took way too long for the simplicity of what it was. I could tell the wait time of the food was beyond the server's control and he apologized on his own a number of times. The food when it did come out was great and what I expected quality wise.

My friend and I were visiting Boston for Easter weekend and were staying near Harvard Square. We woke up early for the crazy good doughnuts at Union Square and walked about a mile and half to get towards back towards Harvard Square and that's how we found the place.\\nWhen you first walk in, you think, oh it's not a big place. But man was wrong. It is quite an expansive place. Maybe because I'm used to small restaurants living in NYC but Alden & Harlow felt like a palace. Also because it was Easter, the place was PACKED. Luckily, we were able to be seated without a reservation so that was a win.Our server explained the menu to us. Ended up getting one Easter special and two brunch menu items--the polenta with poached duck egg, green gravy and ramp oil; the pickled corn pancakes, and the classic secret burger. Every single bite of food was perfection. The Easter dish was earthy but light at the same time but also a good kick to it from the spices and it was balanced by the creaminess of the poached duck egg. The pancakes was sweet from the figs and sour from the buttermilk yogurt and yet refreshing too from the sprigs of mint. However out of the three, it was that burger that was the most memorable. Now I've had good share of burgers and for me the one they make at Alden & Harlow is quite possibly the best burger I've ever had the chance to eat. Yes that is quite the statement but from the way its constructed to how its cooked to the ingredients such as the house made roll, the burger is a must try if you ever find yourself in Boston.¬†As I mentioned before, the seating is ample and its a good mix of bar seating, outdoor seating, table seating, and group seating so there's no wonder people come here. The service was nice too as our guy did a good job of explaining how everything worked and knew the answers to questions we had regarding some of the menu items.

There's one cashier taking orders for the line going out the door. The majority of the tables were empty in the restaurant yet nobody was getting seated. Here's my gripe... there are a lot of people working here and from what I gather, there's one guy behind the counter that just opens up sodas and there's another guy at the door that just opens the door.Look at what food trucks or In-n-Out does... take the orders and payment from people in line with an iPad and get them seated right away. Heck, in Japan almost all ramen joints just have a clipboard at the front for you to sign in yourself. I can accept a lineup if the restaurant was full, but it wasn't.

Okay? Look. Many of them just plain flat out suck. They suck bad. Now I have a dilemma. The Cracker Barrel rocks. The Cracker Barrel has great food.But maybe that's not a bad thing. Especially considering that there aren't too many other restaurant chains that attempt the same cuisine. Sure, it's all a bit hokey, what with the rocking chairs outside and the whole down home country fakeness. Luckily, that doesn't take away from the food.Some of the items aren't as great as anything that's homemade (the green beans cooked in pork), but most of the items on the menu are more than decent - they're really good. Fried chicken. Mashed potatoes. Mac and Cheese (it's really good here). Pancakes. Nearly all of the main items will not disappoint. It's always the sides that could leave you wishing for something else. But that's okay - breakfast is never a problem. Breakfast at the Cracker Barrel is effortless.Well, effortless as long as you don't mind wandering around their huge gift shop/old time junk store while you're waiting 30 minutes to be seated. Once you're seated though, it's worry free.Unless you sit across from a table where an example of America's child obesity barely fits into a high chair, and then proceeds to vomit all over themself... only to be brought back for more by her mother who is obviously well read on proper etiquette in the same way she understands proper nutrition. (Okay, that only happened once - and it didn't stop me from eating.)Where was I? Oh yeah. Cracker Barrel. The best part is that they're almost always located on the outskirts of town, or at the very least, where the suburbs begin and the city ends - so it's almost like you're actually out in the country. (Well, okay, it's not really like that. There's no magical transportation.)I've eaten many breakfast and had too many great gatherings with friends and family at Cracker Barrel. They're prepared for large groups and they make it easy. So bring everyone. You're not going to have anything unique, you're not going to really remember the food. But you're also not going to worry about it - and you'll be more than fed.So yes... if even I can find something good about a big box chain restaurant - every once in a while."},{"name":"Tsim Chai Noodle Restaurant","address":"8251 Westminster Highway, Suite 50","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"A toss up between this place and Mak's.

I haven't been here in awhile, since it's such a trek from my neck of the woods, but I feel this place is deserving of a glowing review.I've been to Israel twice. Both times I ate a LOT of falafel. LOTS. Traveling all over the country in a bus lends itself to chowing in the country's iconic 'fast food'. Honestly I think Rami's was equally as authentic and perhaps, dare I say, even better than any I had there.First of all lets talk falafel. Rami's are perfectly seasoned, crisp on the outside to a golden brown, with just the right amount parsley running through themBut it's more than just the falafel, it's the toppings. Authentic toppings. The correct pickles, cabbage, tahina, hot sauce, and hummus (because why would you get a falafel without hummus?)Its also about the pita, here they're homemade perfectly soft, substantial enough to hold everything. And if you're going to complain about the price than go somewhere else, because if you're complaining then you probably have no idea that authentic Israeli falafel is Kosher, which you also subsequently wouldn't know was a more difficult and expensive way to prepare food.

The carne asada on the plato Mexicano was over cooked to the point of being beef jerky. Which finally brings us to the margarita. Watered down and cheap tasting. I've consistently had better at much cheaper restaurants. All In all a very lackluster experience at a restaurant with more ambiance than flavor or service.

Just chill, read the menu, chat with the other folks waiting. \\nIf you think you're going to walk in and grab a spot right away, you're probably mistaken. Though take note, the bar area is first come first serve. so you can just grab a bar spot. Though I'd be polite, and ask if any of the waiting folks want it before sniping, that's bad form, and they were there first.Now, onto the dogs. We tried a couple of them, the Greek and the Chicago dog... now the Greek was alright. a lil weird for me, but still good. The Chicago was pretty good, but they are missing the cucumbers. My wife is a Chicago native, and pointed that out to the server, who told us that the owner is actually from Chicago as well, but doesn't like the cucumbers on a Chicago style dog, said it's a West side thing over a South side thing or some such. A pity, but it didn't break the meal, was still good. We also got an order of tots. It was something different then fries, that EVERYONE offers, and they were pretty decent, if a little greasy still, but hey, that's school lunch nostalgia right there. So I'm not complaining. Over-all it's a good meal at a nice price, they move quick, and they move really well for a small staff. Just don't walk in and expect instant seating and service, the place is popular after all."},{"name":"John Barleycorns","address":"14610 SW Sequoia Pkwy","city":"Tigard","stars":"3.5","text":"Nothing special.

Maybe just a fluke, but I didn't think they had any heat to them at all.  They served me a really dry, flavorless burger too.  Sorry, but crunchy tots aren't enough to earn another chance.

Their drinks are tasty, sufficiently boozy and often served with a whimsical flare that makes you feel as if whoever dreamt them up was enjoying themselves in the process.The Long Straw with Appleton Estate rum and black port turned out to be a grown-up snow cone. The liquid portion of the drink was obscured by three inches of ice, but it was luckily served with its namesake device that made for easy consumption. It was adorned with blackberries and a sprig of mint that had been dusted with confectioners sugar to look like they just emerged from a spring snow. Lovely and delicious. One complaint is that I wish they reserved more tables for walk-ins. I came with 2 friends at 6:30 on a weeknight and the place was completely dead, but we had to sit at the bar because all the tables were reserved. This leant a bit of an eery vibe to the place and given how popular it is, I doubt booking it full every weeknight is really necessary.  I also wish they would make their sign outside a bit larger since I missed it twice, but I get it. Speakeasies are cool. Or were cool... In either case, I'll keep walking up and down the street to find the door as long as they keep making great cocktails."},{"name":"Tokyo Japanese Steak House","address":"250 Granite St","city":"Braintree","stars":"3","text":"I used to be a loyal customer but i will never be coming back. Firstly for their hotpot, the beef slices of meat are extremely thick, you will be chewing for days to eat this meat. Yes their broths are good but that can never justify for their horrible customer service. Their meats used to be cut nice & thin and they used to be very generous with sauces and everything, im not sure if they changed management but it has been going down hill! Servers & waiters always takes a long time, they give us attitudes when we need special accommodations in seatings, attitudes when we ask for extra sauce. Not worth the time and hassle there are plenty more & better hot pot places in quincy! My story: On a busy mother's day there was of course no parking, the manager then told us that we can park in the handicap spot and that do not worry no one will tow us. Halfway through our meal, a pregnant hostess came yelling at us as she was walking to us she was yelling \\"move your car you cannot park in handicap move it now\\" at this point everyone in the restaurant was looking at us. We kindly told her that the manager told us to park there. We then said okay we will just take the bill now and leave. She said no move it right now! One member of my party got up to move the car, turns out, no one needed our spot for all that rush. Now we are in the middle of our meal with one of our family members just sitting outside in the parking lot in the car. We decided we will just leave. \\n \\nEmbarrassed because we would of never parked there unless the manager insisted it was okay we went to the front desk and told him about this. He simply said \\"dont mind her she is pregnant\\" that is NOT an excuse. This is a business if she cannot handle her emotions at work, she should not be a work. And I LOVE how they started to talk SMACK about us in Vietnamese not knowing we are vietnamese as we walked out.None less i will not be coming back.

Everything was mostly pork and shrimp. Everything was pretty much a dumpling-like thing with a skin-like white slimy covering and smooshy insides.Needless to say, I don't like dim sum!That personal take said, I can also relate that my table thought the dim sum was good. Ross enjoyed it quite a bit, but now needs a new dim sum date because I probably won't return. I actually found one dish I DID like that he'll have to bring me home when he goes. I think the dish is called \\"steamed bun\\" or \\"sticky bun.\\" Basically it is like biscuity goodness with BBQ pork in it. It is a dish the South would have created (and been proud of!).

This was my first experience at any one of these establishments and I am very reluctant to go back after my experience today. I was in a hurry so I thought I'd grab a sandwich quick. From what I have discovered this place was not quick, at all. I filled out my slips and paid, which was the fastest part of my experience. As I waited for my sandwich the staff looked confused, walking around not doing much of any sandwich making (Apox 4-5 staff members), besides one lonely worker. At this pace I knew it would be an eternity before receiving my sandwich, making my initial thought of getting a sandwich quick, false. Finally, I saw them making my first sandwich. A miracle in the making. I got the sandwich without a hitch. Then, oh no, I saw them starting to prepare my second sandwich. The sandwich maker grabbed something off the toaster oven. This was not what I had ordered. Cheese and a hot sandwich was not what I had checked off on my bag. No, no, no, but because I was in a hurry I thought, I'll suck it up today and just take the warm sandwich. But what I received was the completely wrong sandwich. Turkey and pesto mixed with honey mustard and banana peppers. Doesn't sound that appetizing. Long story short, what's the point of filling out these bags with what you want if the workers, when they are actually working, aren't going to read them.

It really does. The brisket is that good. That being said, I've never had to wait in line for it. I've always placed the carry-out catering orders. So, I both don't know if it's worth waiting hours for and I'm untainted by having waited forever and thus had to say good things to validate my time.While I was working in Austin, we would get carry-out Franklin for lunch about every other month. You pretty much have to order within a few minutes of when they open it up to get that to work, but it's awesome. You walk in at 10:15, ask for what you ordered and walk out with egregious quantities of epic barbecue. If you're picking it up, they cut you tastes of things and give you free sweet tea while you wait. Awesome.I don't know what to say other than the brisket really is that good and it really is that good every day. There are other places which can make as good brisket and even do it nearly as regularly, but not many. It has to be tried. The only other place that comes close is La Barbecue which I think does as good brisket and sometimes better. Still, the wait there can be almost as long.Come here.

I personally enjoyed waffles more than the chicken. They had tiny chunks of sweet potatoes, which added a naturally sweet flavor.Biscuits and gravy - 2 huge biscuits, each split in half, and drowned with country gravy, just the way I like it. The gravy was pretty good, just the right consistency and bits of sausage in it. The biscuits though were a little over baked, making them too crunchy. Don't get me wrong, I love crunchy texture, but I like my biscuits a little fluffy to go along with a crunch.Bowl of fruit - it's a bowl of fruit. Fresh and yummy.Overall, it was a nice experience.

All of the meat with the exception of the flank steak was cooked well done. Filet mignon and prime rib were not tender or juicy and was completely brown throughout. In my opinion, you ruin those cuts of meat by cooking them well done. We left a lot of meat uneaten because of this. The sides on the buffet were ok, nothing special. Also, we had to ask our waiter to send servers to our table because they would keep skipping our section. Finally, my credit card was charged double the bill amount and I'm still trying to resolve this with the restaurant. I wish we would've made a different choice in an area with so many options.Update: I was contacted by the restaurant after posting my review to resolve the issue of them double charging my credit card. I'm still not sure how I was charged $100 extra in the same transaction, and I wasn't given a reason other than it was an error. They have refunded my money though.

Last Friday (April 12), I went with a few friends to try Franklin's brisket. We arrived around 8:30AM, and we were third in line. The wait was not a big issue since I had the opportunity to chat with friends. Plus, every once in a while the wind would pick up and we could smell the smokey goodness of the BBQ pit. Right at 11:00AM the doors open, and we were allowed in. Each of us ordered a pound of the moist cut of the brisket and a sausage link, and my friends also ordered the potato salad. We sat inside because it was too windy outside. There is limited seating inside, so arrive early if you want that good seat, too. The moist cut is definitely fatty and juicy. For me, the best part of the brisket was the bark. It was rich in flavor--peppery and juicy. The other parts tasted like any other brisket. I liked the sausage the best. It was also quite juicy (and greasy), but it had a nice smokey flavor. The sauces they had were also quite good. I liked mixing the coffee-based and the vinegar-based sauces to create a sweet and spicy mix. In terms of the potato salad, if you like pickles, this is the salad for you. Along with the usually potatoes, pickles were mixed into the salad. I was not expecting this, and I was not a huge fan of it. In the end, be ready to walk away feeling greasy and full.

This review, I am focusing on the dinner faire, which I had at a business meeting aftermath yesterday night.I have always found the food to be middling, and my dinner yesterday night was not much different from other faire I have had here. I have yet to be blown away, but in comparison, the quality seems to be lightyears above the place I despise the most *cough*Emperor's Garden*cough* and a small step above China Pearl, but unfortunately, when I think high quality Chinese cuisine, the cha laos in Boston still has a ways to go. We ordered one of the set meals, which cost about $200 after tip to feed 9.The first course was a mixed seafood soup with crab meat and egg being the most defined flavors. It seemed more flavored by salt than by the seafood stock and extremely heavy on thickeners. It was passable, but not particularly good. Next was a bird's nest filled with mixed seafood. The bird's nest was cold and thus did not break apart easily, making interaction a bit difficult. The seafood within it is of reasonable size, using moderate-sized scallops and plenty of cuts of fish, not being overly laced with vegetables as filler. You can not go wrong with ginger and scallion tossed lobster, since it is such a simple and basic dish... but after seeing it so many times, it does not seem any different. I wish a Chinese restaurant out there would learn to blanch lobster, extract the meat, and slow simmer it to make it more tender, but that is but a dream... The beef short-ribs with black beans are served on a hot plate with onions and green peppers. The cuts of the short-ribs were varying in quality, some being very high in fat and seemingly untrimmed ends, others fine. There was a celery-like green Chinese vegetable that I forget the name of, served in broth, but I avoided because after experience with it in the past, the strands within are like celery in terms of getting caught in my teeth. The salt and pepper shrimp used whole live shrimp, so a bit more work is needed relatively, but the preparation method preserves the internal juices. This was fairly well-executed with the salt not overwhelming, which is a tendency I've seen with such. The steamed fish of the day was butchered very well and seemingly the highlight dish in terms of preparation, the bones parted without being broken, steamed with soy sauce and topped with scallions. The Haianese chicken was served somewhat tepid, though for me, that is better than cold, but I wish it were hot. However, it was butchered very well, the amount of work needed with my mouth to extract bones minimal for every piece, though about half the chicken was very light on meat compared to others. The admixed fried rice had ham, bean sprouts, beef, peas, and shrimp. Nothing unusual, except to note that the fried rice is seemingly not sauced and just lightly salted, which I personally prefer. It was not too dry, nor too sticky. For dessert, we had a chilled dessert soup of tapioca pearls and sweet potato. In terms of flavor and thickness, it was wonderful and light, the sweetness not overwhelming, but in terms of texture, a lot of the tapioca pearls were stuck together in large globs, meaning it was not stirred enough to keep it from sticking or the tapioca was left out too long to dry.Overall, Hei La Moon is a safe bet. It can cater to a large array of tastes, but it seems like a place to take the family rather than a date. If you are versed in Asian dishes, you will find nothing innovative here, but the standards executed fairly well. In comparison to the other dim sum/function hall restaurants in Chinatown, I'd say it is the best, but not by much. There is room for someone to craft a wonderful Chinese dining experience rather than a large room for dinner. The group meals offered here is good for when you want to focus on gathering with your family rather than spending time arguing over what to order. Just learn the even Chinese numbers, walk in, peer at the Chinese menu, point at the number of people you want, and get back to conversation. Let the restaurant take care of the rest."},{"name":"A La Mode","address":"1689 Johnston Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"My hubby and I had to try this place...it's very unique as everything they make has the pot pie crust baked on top.

Everything was moist and smoked to perfection.  The sauce was not to spicy or peppery, just right.  Not thick like the sauces we had in Florida, and not as runny as the sauces we had in SC.    The place is small, tables are very close to each other and you'll be squeezing in between people every time you get up.  There's a small patio out front and if the weather's nice that's where you want to be.  There's usually a line (even when I went at 2 PM), great blues music, all homemade sides.  I took my buddy who helped me move here for lunch and he loved it too.  I think the rib and chicken platter was about $12, I think sides were extra?  Don't quote me on that.

Normally, I would be like whatevs, but my friend was driving me and really wanted a beef tongue taco. Really? You're gonna wait three hours for a taco? We wander down the street to eat at a place that has no line... because their dinner rush is over. At 10pm, we get a phone call asking if we still wanted a table. Umm, sure... my friend is already out the door while I am trying to pick the toppings off my pizza so I get my money's worth. We get another phone call on our walk back to Mezcal.

I am seated with my back towards the bar. We order some drinks, some ceviche, a couple tacos and my friend's beef tongue tacos. Now here's where things go awry: I had like three out of the six drinks our server was holding spill all over me... bottle of coke and ginger beers. Our server said she didn't know she spilled it on me, but that she would bring a fresh round since my coke was on me and the floor. I don't know how she didn't know since the bottles were now not full. She never back with new drinks. At least she didn't charge us for the ones she spilled on me. I had to sit there all wet and sticky, but hey... free coke. She came back at the end of the night to tell me about how it wasn't her fault the drinks spilled all over me because someone pushed her. When the food came, we were missing those beef tongue tacos. We flagged another server down because we couldn't find ours... he said he would check on them. They ran out. Oh, it's so nice that we knew that. He asked if she wanted something else. She declined since she didn't want to have to wait. The ceviche was okay. I like that they make their own chips...

Ever since then I have been searching high and low for open faced Bao sandwiches but no place anywhere near town have ever really specialized in them....until now! Once I heard that this place was opening I squealed like a little school girl when her crush walked by and said \\" Heyyyy girlllll\\" No...really I did. Located in a decent part of Gastown the restaurant is very small but quaint. There are a few seats downstairs and also some upstairs which is a very enjoyable spot to eat and do a little people watching haha. They offer free lemon and cucumber water and have a clean single person bathroom downstairs. This place is basically like a hip food cart but disguised as a restaurant...isn't it usually the other way around?? What a mind - funk, I love it.The menu is pretty good, about 7 different Baos along with a few sandwiches and sides. We ordered the Yvr, Bao chicka boa boa, flip side and the Jaws with a side of kimchi fries. Unfortunately the two worlds collide was sold out (two kinds of pork belly) ...must try that next time. -The Yvr is seared albacore tuna with bacon bits and it was amazing I recommend it highly-The Boa chicka seems to be the most popular because it's fried chicken but the one we got didn't look like other pictures really...the consistency was closer to a fish but it didn't taste like fish so we really weren't sure what to make out of that one.- The flip side was korean soyu pork I believe and it was really good with the veggies- The Jaws is a coconut crusted catfish, this one was our least favorite but still not badNow here's where I scream out to everyone around town about something extremely special...KIMCHI FRIES HOLY MOTHER OF EFF! So their kimchi fries advertise that they come with pieces or crispy pork belly and chicken but unfortunately our order didn't come with either of those...so we asked about it and the lady didn't even hesitate to tell us to finish those and she'll make a new one WITH pork belly for us...seriously!? two ordered or these magical fries for the price of 1? Now that is a great way to make sure your customers come back, being polite and sincere. The second order has lots of delicious pork  belly  but no chicken...this time we didn't want to say anything because we enjoyed it too much and didn't want to be any more of a bother. THESE THINGS ARE AMAZING THOUGH!Along with some other reviews I did find that the cold baos made for the meats to get cold quickly so I would suggest them being served warm to order and I really don't know about that chicken...I will have to try it again to see if I just had a bad piece because I am a fried chicken FIEND.

This one particularly arrogant server/waiter walks up to my table (even before serving a glass of water) and very rudely says (looking at his watch) that we have 15 minutes to finish the lunch. When I reminded him that the buffett closes at 3:00 PM, he very curtly said 'You have to finish it'.

I understand it's purpose, but when you are meeting up for drinks and dinner after work with an unknown amount of girls... well, this is not the place for you. One particular occation will always sour this restaurant for me. I understand that when we were seated with what we thought was our full group, it was annoying that more people kept showing up and eventually we couldn't keep adding more chairs. I get that it is a pain in the ass to switch tables and thus switching waiters. However it was a Monday evening and the place was empty. It was annoying that you made us wait half an hour to be seated in an empty restaurant.Seating issues aside, my biggest problem was the food. While tasty enough, I only physically had three bites before it was taken away from me. It took us so long to get our food that I had to excuse myself to use the facilities after a mediocre margarita and several glasses of water (that to their credit, were filled promptly) very early in the meal. By the time I got back from waiting in line and using the facilities. My nearly untouched plate was gone. When I asked about my food the waiter just said, \\"Oh, we've already thrown it away,\\" and walked away. They cleared the table so quickly that none of my dining companions had a chance to stop them. No apology, it was not taken off the bill I had to pay for the meal I didn't eat.I wish I could say this was an off night, but I have had for too many similar experiences here. The drinks are just O.K., the food is average and the atmosphere is soured by the often surly wait staff.

Both were cooked the way they should be and had a spice/bite to them that was expected and well done. No complaints. My only critical notch is that the bartender charged an extra two dollars for putting my straight up tequila in a snifter. I get it, you have to hand clean it, but at least tell me in advance.

The food was okay....they don't serve their barbeque with  sauce on the ribs and quite frankly, you don't really need it.  The ribs had a slightly sweet spicy rub on them that tasted pretty good.  The ribs themselves, however, weren't as tender  as I was expecting them to be.  I will give the Fox credit for serving the ribs with two pieces of white bread though! :-)I had the chocolate pecan pie for dessert and didn't enjoy it at all.

Not so much of a cold cereal or oatmeal type of guy, but the pancakes, waffles, eggs, bacon, and sausage kind of guy. When asked what his favorite food was, he answered: BREAKFAST!! Not one item in particular, but the meal as a whole. It was only natural for me to take him here. If the world ended tomorrow, at least he would've died happy from brunch! (; I myself am not a big fan of breakfast/brunch, but Screen Door has made me reconsider my feelings.Three different visits to this place--each one just as amazing as the last! If you're not in line as soon as they open at 9am on Sat, you're most likely looking to wait around for an hour or two. No worries though, because there's free coffee! The service and food is also great, so I can usually look past the long wait. (: As far as the food goes, everything I've tried is absolutely AMAZING. If you're indecisive on what to get, a safe bet would be the fried chicken and waffle--three enormously fried pieces of chicken stabbed into a giant sweet potato waffle by a knife. What more could you want?? If you're not feeling like chicken, the scrambles are also a tasty choice! The Alabama scramble, with ham, green onions, and pimiento cheese was pretty good, but the Cajun scramble with andouille sausage, bell pepper, onion, cheddar cheese, and green onions was even better! :D The scrambles come with your choice of potatoes or cheddar grits, as well as two slices of white or wheat toast. If you're not in the mood for meat and eggs, I would highly recommend the bananas foster french toast. (Four pieces of french toast with rum-flamed caramelized bananas, topped with cinnamon and powdered sugar, and four dollops of whipped cream). And finally, your meal would only be complete with a side of praline bacon. (Think bacon with maple syrup and nuts, and a dash of crack). I can't reiterate enough how much I LOVE this place and the food that they serve. From what I remember, $2 for unlimited Stumptown coffee is a bargain and wheat toast + butter + jam could stand alone as a fukkin' meal! No joke, it's that amazing! :D My single complaint is that the bananas foster french toast should come with a tiny pitcher of syrup (like the fried chicken and waffle) instead of having it all poured on top for you. It was a little too sweet for me, and I found myself tired from all of that syrup. On the other hand, the waitress I had refilled my glass of water when it was only half empty on THREE different occasions. Now THAT'S service!

Parking can be a little iffy in this area, especially in the evening, but we got pretty lucky with a spot a block away. The ambiance is pretty cool here - I love the tin ceiling and exposed brick - and it feels dark and cozy, which is nice after a long day under fluorescent lights. One thing I didn't like was how loud it was, especially when there were still open tables. It was hard to adjust to the noise level and sometimes I felt like I had to scream my conversation. We got drinks (Oktoberfest now on tap!) but were kind of bummed when they came out far too warm to be fully enjoyed. Service was okay.The food was pretty good. We started with the Jalapeno Bean Dip, which was decently seasoned but could have been spicier. They give you a ton of chips, I think we ended up sending half of them back to be tossed. We each got cheeseburgers - regular for me, double for him - and split an order of the fresh-cut fries and coleslaw (to top our burgers with, of course). The burger patties were thin and pretty similar to the burger at Press Grill (owned by the same people as 185). Overall really really good burger if you're not into a huge piece of meat. Fries were kind of soggy, but we got a huge basket for only $2. Our total for 2 drinks, an app, 2 burgers and 2 sides came out to just under $30 - which is awesome.

The menu online says they have a signature chicken dish, but its in limited supply - so I asked to make sure they'd still have some by 6:30. The woman was sure they would - but could make no promises. We showed up early just in case. I got a bit panicked when the server who took my name at the podium thought they might be out of chicken, but only because neither myself nor my date are adventurous enough to eat escargot (what I consider to be the Cadillac of the slug family) or rabbit (an animal I had as a pet once). He went to the kitchen and confirmed they did have the chicken, so we were good to go. We started off with the cheese plate with Ch√®vre, Gouda, pistachios, berries and sliced baguette bread. We also shared the \\"Leeks Vinaigrette\\" (salad) with greens, lemon Dijon vinaigrette, shaved radish, Apricot & Ch√®vre. Both were very good. Then came our 2 entrees of \\"Poulet en Cocotte\\" (the chicken). It consisted of chicken confit leg, pan-roasted breast with a demi-glace, farro risotto and topped with a poached egg. While I thought it was amazing, my date only liked his white meat because the dark meat had the sweet glace - which he isn't used to. Geez! You'd think he never had Chinese food before! The decor is homey. Black tables, black window frames and black wainscoting are met with that wallpaper that looks like a china pattern. Hung on the walls are dishes that remind me of grandma's Sunday best. While my dinner partner may not have gotten it \\"It doesn't look like an expensive restaurant\\", I get it. It's shabby chic meets Portland Hipster. Only, these hipsters are friendly, clean shaven and look like they've bathed today. I had a bad experience with one of Portland's other French bistros (rhymes with Le Chignon) and had to compliment our server on being nothing like the stuck up snooty wait staff person who looked down upon us there. The happy hour items look amazing so I definitely want to go back for that now!"},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Brunch & Bakery Heaven!!!Absolutely one of my favorite Sunday brunch place!! The place is in an unexpected location with limited parking. It is also quite small with limited seating. Although it might look rough on the outside but it is quirky. When you walk toward the door, you will see a mural with a lady holding the pie with the phrase \\"Come on in & let us fill your pie hole.\\" Once entered, make sure to get in line and order. After you order, you can find seating. They don't allow anyone to save table before paying and expect to sit really close to people. If you don't like hearing other people conversation, this place isn't for you.The order come out quick and the staff are nice though.My favorite thing about the place is the unique flavor. We had the following: 7th trimester which was a mix of biscuits with mac'n'cheese, bacon, eggs, etc. \\nBenedict which was top with hollandaise, bacon, and a side of grits\\nTree hugger which was a muffin and yogurt filled with berries, figs, etc\\nMini salted caramel pecan pie with its buttery crust and scrumptious fillingI am not a fan of pie but Se7en Bites' salted caramel pecan pie has changed my mind.

It's what they're known for so stick to this.  House smoked beef brisket ($16.50) - I could barely swallow this, and took no more than a couple bites because it was so dry and bland.

The best part of the bao was the pickled veg. The chicken was fried, the glaze was reminiscent of nothing but fish sauce and the bao itself was soggy (steamed too long) and mushy while thr open end was hard. Needless to say, I didn't finish my bao. The fries were good, the curry was definitely a highlight. The \\"fried\\" chicken though seemed more like sliced chicken breast and it was a little cold. The beignets were great, crunchy, soft, coconutty, sweet and as calorific as you'd imagine. The free item saved the meal for me. Won't come back but this is a great concept that can go far.

Now here's what bothers me slightly about this place: It's a trailer that's only open three hours a day. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that - it's probably the very best method for them to be efficient, effective, eco-friendly, and whatever - but it's also a narrow window to catch me in a hummus mood, and if it's too hot or uncomfortable outside, I'm just not going to be your biggest fan of trailer dining, regardless of how good it is. When it comes to eating out, I'm big on my own personal comfort levels.The bottom line is I like Lizzie's Lunchbox, I think it's a fun and yummy place, and I'm definitely a fan.

I'd totally order that again but I do wish there was a bit more duck on the dish as it seemed like there was 5 small slivers on there. We also order the warm kale salad cause it's always good here. It's nice and creamy but not overly dressed. We also ordered the buttermilk fried confit lamb belly. This was a decent dish, great for sharing as it is a pretty rich plate of food. It came with 2 sauces which complemented each other.Next up we had the poutine. I was pretty disappointed with this dish as I have heard people talk about how good it is here. I found the dish rather odd due to the fact that the brisket had this sweet taste to it which really threw me off and also the gravy was a little tasteless. Lastly we had the pork cheeks. This dish really didn't do it for me the purple cauliflower dirt seemed pointless on the dish for me. the smoked yogurt didn't tastes smoked to me at all...

We paid less than $14 for all three, and the brownie and waffle were both upcharges.

I've always thought the burgers were good, but something kept me from coming back regularly, it just wasn't quite there; good, but not amazing. I went last night on a whim, and my girlfriend and I were blown away, everything was excellent! The milkshakes and malts are the real deal, thick, rich and flavorful. The Cockshake adds booze (brilliant) in any of its many permutations. We tried a chocolate malt and  the cockshake special which had buttershots and irish cream. They were both delicious, but I preferred the malt. I am thinking about that malt right now, agghhh so good.... Next were the black and white fries which I've ordered every time I've gone for the past couple years. They are excellent, order them and thank me later. Fresh fries with parmesan (maybe some pecorino as well?) and truffle oil, with a side of garlic and squid ink aioli. My one and only gripe is that our fries were all about 1\\" long, which got annoying after a while. The burgers. Oh the burgers. If these weren't their crown jewel, it wouldn't be called Foster Burger. I had the BBQ and my lady friend had the burner. We were both very pleased; they were both perfectly medium in the middle as requested. Our friend had the turkey burger and said it was by far the best he's ever had. The An Xuyen buns are very brioche like and absorb the many juices from the burger quite well without becoming overly soggy or pasty. The BBQ burger has BBQ sauce (surprise!), bacon, cheese, coleslaw, homemade pickles and the other standard FB fare. It was really fucking good. I was so full I could only eat half, and I saved the rest for the next day, and it was still, really fucking good. Leftovers that are that good are rare indeed.  I have enjoyed my past experiences, but last night was transcendent. I look forward to my next visit, and will gladly amend my review to five stars if it's anywhere as good as it was last night.EDIT: I have been back, and it was still very good.

I thought, nawww...not in Atlanta...no way. Fox Brother's bring's a slice of Texas to Georgia...no way. Well, I can state for a fact, they did and they do it well, very well indeed. The area off either 75/85 & 20 is not the best/safest; you know, cash for your car, bars on windows, gang markings on walls of buildings (everywhere), etc. When you get within a block or two of the restaurant, Millennials & Gen X'ers have been buying in this area rehabbing the homes. So on street parking was fine, you'll be safe. Just don't walk more than 5-blocks away in any direction...you'll be fine.   Three of us started off with their Texas fries with the pulled pork option minus the jalapenos. Oh my... If you don't control yourself, you will literally eat the whole plate and have no room for your meal. These fries were off the hook!  Just dip them in the provided ranch dressing and try to stop yourself. I had the brisket platter, ordered it on the fatty side with chili-mac & jalapeno corn-bread. The brisket was succulent, pulled apart with ease, extremely tender, not over-seasoned, and I lightly put their base BBQ sauce on it...WOW!  I haven't I had that taste sensation since my last trip to Austin. The brisket today was as close to Texas as you can find in the state of GA! The chili-mac was more than the name implies. It was shells & cheese, with a pulled pork mixture of chili. I could of ate a bucket of it! It was fantastic. I didn't think it could get better until I tried the warm jalapeno corn-bread with butter. I was ready to dance. The flavors were fantastic and popping. This is a meal where you need to take a small bite of one item and add a quick 2nd bite of the jalapeno corn-bread to allow the flavors explode in your mouth. The pull pork sandwiches were also served with tater tots and again, this meal nailed the mark. The pull pork was cooked to perfection, and extremely tender too. Even the tots were served crispy, not over-cooked whatsoever. Can you tell I'm stoked?  I finally found great BBQ in the Atlanta area...thank you Fox Brother's!

I'm convinced that Screen Door inspired that episode. Luckily, it was well worth it.Our first attempt to try this spot was at opening on Sunday morning. We arrived 10 minutes before opening to find the line was down the street already. I didn't want to make our friends wait for hours so I moved brunch to the Hunnymilk pop up (it was amazing too!). The second attempt was mid-morning on Monday and the line was shorter. We ended up waiting an hour and a half for breakfast. The restaurant has a bar behind the hostess stand where you can grab coffee, juice, and drinks to enjoy while you wait. I'd suggest this since your wait will most likely be a long one.At long last we were seated at one of the picnic tables on the patio. I liked the outdoor seating and the patio was definitely less lively than the inside of the restaurant. By the time we were seated we had decided on our brunch feast options so we got to it.I had the Pimento Cheese & Sausage Biscuit Sandwich. Ahhhhhmazing. The biscuit was piled high and was a fork and knife sandwich. The biscuit was very tasty, the sausage patty was thick, eggs perfectly prepared, and the pimento cheese was delicious. The ingredients sound standard, but the taste was far from standard. The Cheesy Grits on the side were yummy as well.My husband had the Fried Oyster Breakfast Po-Boy. This is not a dainty sandwich, bring your appetite. He absolutely loved this and was happy to get his fried oyster fix in Portland. The roasted potatoes on the side were amazing.For breakfast dessert we shared the Coconut Pancakes with Rhubarb Compote and orange whipped cream. The pancakes were fluffy and the coconut flavor was very nice. The orange whipped cream was really good and a nice touch.

We showed up at noon on a Thursday (in late Dec) and it took a *really* long time to get seated and to receive our food. To be fair, we did have a large group (there were 7 of us total). The staff was also pretty preoccupied and seemed overwhelmed. Basically, from the moment we arrived to when we left, the whole experience left something to be desired. I ordered a cheeseburger (sans special sauce and medium-well), french fries (w/the squid aioli), and a vanilla malt. When our food finally arrived, my cheeseburger was enormous, but it was really overcooked and the patty had very little flavor. The fries were also a bit of a let down because they came out soggy. Despite not being a big fan of sauce, I tried the squid aioli anyway and it was okay. Keep in mind, the real flavor of the aioli may have been lost on me because I'm not a big sauce fan. All of that said, the vanilla malt was delicious!The atmosphere at Foster Burger was pretty cool though. I like the modge-podge of old rock posters all over the walls combined with random antique furniture and dim lights. Definitely somewhere I'd want to hang out and have a beer. Would I visit here again? Probably. But mostly because it is really close to home and I'm hoping this experience was just an anomaly.

As far as drinks, I tried the corn and oil, blue Hawaii, dawn of the apes, and the rum runner, and every single one was fantastically prepared.

Expect no less than perfection with this team, they know their stuff.We had the crab and corn fritters and pork empanadas to start, and both were delicious, but those empanadas were to die for. There was a green pesto sauce that came with them that was divine - I was surprised at how light they were able to make everything taste with full flavors. We also had the Caribbean seafood pepper pot and the Ropa Vieja. The pepper pot was delicious, like a Caribbean bouillabaisse, but the Ropa Vieja took the gold medal.

That being said, this is the best brisket in the Austin area.  I went today for the first time.  I arrived at 10:15 after reading tips saying there is a line and if you're not early enough you may miss out.  This is true.  They are only open for lunch because they sell out by 1pm.  By the time the place opened at 11am there was a pretty substantial line.  I ordered the pork ribs and a lean/moist mix of brisket.  I also tried the turkey my friend ordered.  I'll start with the brisket - it was incredible.  So tender it could be shredded with a fork and it had a great flavor.  Again, it's the best brisket around with a CLOSE second being Johnny T's BBQ in Round Rock.  The ribs, my personal favorite, were incredibly tender.  My test is if one can put the rib in your mouth and easily pull out a clean bone - this place passes that test.  They were so tender you could even easily bite through the bone and get at some of that marrow - if you're into that sort of thing.  The turkey was a little salty but really moist and tender which is hard to do.  All of it was definitely worth standing in line for.  It's a little pricey (but worth it) and along with the drive to downtown (for me) it's probably a once and a while type of a deal.  Johnny T's ribs are just as good and they're closer so that place will be more frequented by me.

Nothing in NY can even come close to replicating something like this, but I will say I've had something on par in St. Louis. 2 points though. This place is ridiculously popular and the line and wait time I had to endure (just so the food does not run out) was over 2 hours in 30 degree weather. This made it tough in general to say it was SO worth it (mentally). And second, I've had better sauces. I know that may be an amateur thing to say but the 3 sauces all tasted very similar to me (one slightly spicier than the other 2, one slightly more vinegar based then the other 2, and one despite it looking brown and chocolaty, tasted pretty in-between). Even though I have these negatives, I think the meat is just worth it to try. It's absolute heaven. The staff was very friendly and welcoming, thanking us every moment for waiting.

It is a brightly decorated place full of character, colors, and Mexican music blaring on the speakers, that it was somewhat strange that it was located seemingly in the middle of nowhere during an empty Sunday morning at 10am. For the deliciousness of the brunch items, it's unfortunate that this place isn't very busy (at least Sunday morning). Could be a good or bad thing, but I thought it was awesome that we didn't have to wait long to be served. Our waiter also seemed a bit inexperienced and on the edge...the instant we were seated he asked us what we wanted to order, and he mixed up our orders, brought me the wrong item the first time and still had the order half-wrong the second time. What compensated for this was that our items came out relatively quickly.We ordered the Mayan mochas, which were okay. A bit too sweet, not sufficiently spicey, very chocolate-y and could barely taste the espresso in it. I had the Mexican eggs benedict, which was excellent. The corn cake (masa) that it came with was absolutely delicious and featured an interesting type of corn (not your usual yellow corn kernels) that lent a great flavor to it. My friend ordered the Adios, which was excellent as well and came with a generous scoop of sour cream.Every corner of Adios is packed with something to sell, whether it is the lantern hanging above your table, random Mexican toys or decor placed throughout the cafe and restaurant, or a glass case of chocolates and baked goods, all lending a charm to the place and making me wonder why the place isn't more popular. I also heard great things about the chocolates and cupcakes here, so I may be back to give those a try.If it weren't for the Scoutmob deal, I'm not sure if I ever would have come here, since it is a bit of a ways off from Atlanta's other shop/restaurant areas. The dishes are delicious here and reasonably priced at $6-9 each.

Four for the prices, no-frills/comfortable atmosphere, and generally decent service... three for the predictably \\"A-OK\\" food that is perfectly fine but nothing to write home about.I've been here multiple times because it is just such a convenient stop for a quick, cheap, sit-down lunch or dinner when you're wandering in the Harvard area. The restaurant is huge so wait times (if you have to wait at all) are rarely long - even on a busy weekend night. Also, despite being consistently busy, the staff never make you feel rushed or try to turn over tables as quickly as possible. The menu is so large and diverse that it's pretty easy to accommodate a group of people with distinct tastes. Moreover, despite serving a range of food (Mexican, Cajun, good ol' American), the kitchen does a decent job with every dish I've tried thus far. Between my various visits I've tried enchiladas, tacos, steak, and recently crawfish etouffee. Everything has been perfectly ok and generous in size, so for $7-$10/entree I leave feeling satisfied. If you're looking for locally sourced food or depth of flavor you're obviously in the wrong place. Dishes are overwhelmingly one-note (cheese, sauce, etc.) and don't have much in the way of distinguishable spices, herbs, or other complex flavors. But I doubt that will come as much of a surprise. I was surprised, however, by the fact that they serve at least some locally brewed beverages; my rootbeer came from a brewing company in Ipswich.

Very, very unique restaurant, certainly is a hidden gem. They don't actually have a menu, and it's BYOB ($2 Cork fee/bottle). They have a few set appetizers and they tell you what they have for main ingredients, other than that it's on you to make up what you want. Joe the owner/chef, is the MAN, and he'll literally make you anything if they have the ingredients. Whatever you get I'm sure it'll be wicked good, I've been here probably 10-12 TIMES and have never had a bad meal. Very, very good Italian eating. The actual restaurant itself is very small, it's only one room, but that adds to the unique intimate atmosphere. Because it's smaller it can get loud and rowdy in there real quick, it can turn into one big family party with family members you've never met before. So beware if you're looking for a quite secluded dinner - this is not the place for that. Last but not least, always be safe and call plenty of time in advance for a reservation. Because it's so popular and small it's highly unlikely you'll be able to just walk in and sit down especially Thursday-Saturday.

So, first off I am not a huge fan of shortbread. That said, the lavender shortbread was tasty and not overly perfuming as I was afraid it might be. The honey butter hazelnut cake was delicious. We shared one of the gourmet oatmeal cream pies the next day and it was just meh, the cream filling was to sweet and the oatmeal cookie part was just bland. It had an okay texture but for my taste could have used some more flavor, maybe some raisins or nuts to make it more interesting. The peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies were way too shortbread-like in the flavor and texture which I find to be just too rich for that type of cookie. Same thing with the biscotti, they had more of a shortbread texture too, rather than the traditional biscotti dry crunchy goodness. They still dunked pretty well in my morning cup o' joe. These folks obviously love shortbread so if you are a fan you will love a lot of their sweet baked goods.Service - well I have never had better friendlier service anywhere, so what else is there to say.My only tiny ding would be that they were preparing baked goods with a stand mixer in the front of the store while we were eating and the pitch of a stand mixer running for that length of time can be quite unnerving.

Words may not adequately describe the experience, but I will do my best.I came here with my cousin who was visiting from out of town, and we were both in need a a breakfast that would fill us up for the rest of the day. Starving as we were, we were a bit apprehensive about the wait, but it was nice sunny day, so the wait outside wasn't so bad, especially for a Saturday. After a half hour we were seated by our very friendly server, and ordered the holy grail of breakfasts: Chicken and waffles. In spite of the place being so packed that we were nearly rubbing elbows with the people at the table next to us, our food was out in less than 20 minutes. One Belgian waffle, with a tower of three massive pieces of golden fried chicken skewered to it. The waffle was great, not too soft, not too crispy and oh so fluffy and delicious. The chicken was really the star of the meal, as it was really the perfect fried chicken. Slightly spicy, not overly salty, and fried to perfection with an almost grease less, crispy golden outside, and a tender, juicy inside. Finish it off with some strong, flavorful coffee and you have of the best breakfasts ever. The only disappointment I had was when I later found out that my cousins sister was cleaning out the fridge, and threw away my left over piece of chicken. Sure, \\"threw it out\\" uh-huh, sure. I bet she threw it out. Oh well, I guess that just means I have to come back again, and again and again....Believe the hype. Screen Door deserves the reputation it has, and is well worth the wait.

I honesty couldn't even tell you if our pizza had garlic or scamorza on it like it was supposed to.The absolute worst part was the dough. It was like the wood oven equivalent of California Pizza Kitchen...seriously. No sourdough flavors, no pleasant chewyness, under salted and just bland. Oh, and the DeSano was burnt on the bottom...New restaurant, new employees who probably aren't used to a wood burning oven...I get it, it happens.

The overall flavor was great, but meat a little dry (probably happens every once in awhile, but would get again).30-40 minutes after we finished our appetizer, our main entree was served. We honestly were no longer hungry, but no one checked on us during our long wait so we couldn't cancel our order.

About  20 minutes later, we had our entrees.I had the burnt end platter with spicy mac n cheese and brisket baked beans. The entree was a bit disappointing, despite our extra wait the brisket was cold, and the beans and mac n  cheese were  too hot. I  could tell that the beans and  Mac had sat under a  heat lamp for a while because the surface was dried out,  but overall it was hard to eat because of the temperature. Would have been more enjoyable if the food was a proper temperature. The spicy mac n cheese lived up to its name, very flavorful, but very spicy.  Burnt ends seemed to have sat for awhile before being brought out to us, they were cold and almost mushy. We canceled the dessert we had ordered when we initially sat down (restaurant week) and asked for our check. The manager came out to apologize, was very pleasant, as were we, and no offer was made to discount the meal, or coupons for next time, which was disappointing. I feel that if we were the type to be angry and confrontational, then more would have been done, but that isn't  our style. Instead, we likely won't  return.

The migas were incredibly flavorful and overwhelmingly delicious.While the prices are semi-steep, I consider it worth it seeing as each meal has the absolute potential to result in a second meal later with the help of a to-go box. We both employed our leftovers as supper later that night.Without a hint of reservation, I wholly recommend the Screen Door. Every aspect of my visit was a pleasurable one.

Ramen, dude. No joke.\\" to nobody in particular because you were at home in your underwear lying directly under the ceiling fan? Well this isn't the Ramen you were talking about.Because it's better! Which, ok, it's not hard to be better than instant Ramen that costs like thirty cents or whatever it is after inflation these days. No, this Ramen is for realzies. They put all kinds of stuff in it too. Like pork, vegetables, and even an egg. There's actual nutrition in this thing. Like, you could eat it every day and not get one of those weird diseases with funny names like scurvy or rickets or polio. Actually, don't trust me on that one. I'm not a doctor. You might get polio. I don't know.Anyway, the food's good. During this Ramen Renaissance (Ramenssance?) I've eaten at a few of the other places, and Tatsu-Ya is my favorite. Except for the seating. It's cramped inside and there's often a line. They have a line person who assigns you a table, and if there's no table available, you have to wait to order. Making faces at this person doesn't help, but it's still fun, so I recommend it.I've only been for lunch, and there's not a lot of options beyond the standard bowl (that they call Ol 'Skool). They have things called \\"bombs\\" that are different substances in ball shapes that you can drop in your Ramen for like a buck. They're alright I guess. I'm mostly impressed that there's such a level of comfort with the b-word at a Japanese place.

First off the experience started slow as I had to instruct the likely new person handling the register through the speaker at the car hop.  Each item took about 2 minutes for them to find in their computer. Then I had the audacity to order a chicken strip sandwich plain from the value menu. They kept typing in the more expensive one and I had to instruct them where on the menu it was as it was a big mystery to them. I think it was more likely they would find that missing Malaysian airplane before locating how to order this sandwich and get it plain. I had to ask for it plain 7 times as well (no lie) Well, I then ordered an ice tea as well ( or so I thought)\\n      When the food quickly arrived. The receipt was correct with the sandwich saying plain. However after opening it I quickly saw it had mayo and lettuce on it. Also the \\"ice tea\\" was incredibly warm as they didn't put any ice in it. \\n      I pushed the speaker button and explained the situation. They apologized and brought out another \\"plain\\" one. The car hop kid said it was plain. I opened it and it had mayo on it, but no lettuce. Knowing there was no way they would get it correct a third time I just let it ago and had a big laugh.

Arrived just before 9 am to find a small group already waiting on the porch. A little after 9 the group moved in front of the door on the far right side to officially from the line. The queue then snakes down the ramp and into the parking lot. If you bring a chair and a beer/book/iPad, the time will fly by. Shortly after 9, the staff began arriving to prepare the inside. The door is open and you are welcome to use the restroom. The folks at Franklin go above and beyond. They get an A+ in food quality and an A++ in service/marketing. These folks know what they're doing. My only disappointment was that the head pit master was absent the day we went. Apparently judging a food contest elsewhere in Austin. Nevertheless, the substitute cutter couldn't have been friendlier and we really enjoyed the whole experience. The atmosphere is just classic. Great music, layout, etc. Oh yeah, the food. Oh, the food. The brisket at Franklin has been praised high and low so no need to go into great detail about that. There's no question whether it should be in your order. Was it the best I've ever had? Close. I still rank Louie Mueller's (Taylor) No. 1. After the brisket, the pork ribs are a must too. Perfectly seasoned and smoked. Out of this world some of the best-I've-ever-had kind of ribs. The turkey was superb too. The other really memorable take-away were the sauces. Yes, all of the meats stand on their own without the need to add a flavor-masking sauce, but the two sauces available at Franklin are so well done and so unique, you don't want to miss out on them. One is a dark espresso-laced sauce. Totally rocked. The other was a vinegar-based southern-style sauce. Loved it too. I normally shy away from this style when enjoying Texas bbq, but it was very well done. I used the white bread, soaked up the sauce and added some pickles. Mmmmmgood. We drove in from Houston the night before just to enjoy Franklin BBQ so we could get in line early. I've slowly been checking off the top BBQ spots in striking distance - Smitty's, Black's, etc. and I still have a few to go, but I just don't see how anyone will be able to compete with this place and the overall food quality and experience. Already plotting my next visit. Thanks again to everyone at Franklin for making this such a memorable visit.

Service started out great, the waitress very friendly, but then she must have sensed I didn't like the food, she got avoidance behavior.  And then when I made a small criticism (like how they should reduce the massive amount of roux so you can get at the shrimp), she didn't care for it.  Really!  She's a waitress, not the chief, not the owner, unless I'm mistaken.Anyhow, appetizer: coconut shrimp with mango salsa sauce.  The pieces could have been bigger, and the batter, better.  I've had bigger at chain (bahama breeze) and better batter at Red Lobster.  I had a bad feeling about this place.  Next appetizer: seared ahi tuna.  Room temperature and dry, like it was cooked three hours ago and sat around waiting for a diner.  Six very small pieces for 14.95.  And I thought sushi restuarants were overpriced.  This was half a sashimi order for $14.95!!!  When you have sushi, the fish still seems fresh, but this was lifeless (and this place panders as a fresh seafood restaurant.)  Main meals: pork tenderloin.  Pretty good.  The the waitress was unwilling to change the sides when we found out the rice also had butter; she said the order was already in the kitchen.  Please!  What a lazy or cowardly bitch.  Not sure which.  Some kitchens can be mean.  And she insisted that they only used a little butter in the veggies.  Bullshit.  Actually, this is a bad restaurant, so let me reduce my rating to one star.  Because if you drown things in butter, minus one star for you.  Just make the food better, jeez.I got crawfish/shrimp/chicken etouffee.  Bleh!  I had years of amazing etouffee in Austin, so I know what I'm looking for.  I've also had experience of bad etouffee, so I know what to worry about.  This was a blend.  For one: massive quantity of etouffee BUT it was all roux!  So I did this: I spooned the roux onto empty plates so I could pick out the large shrimp, the teeny, tiny crawfish and the occasional chicken.  So much burnt tasting roux, what a brown, muddy mess.  And they don't give you nearly enough rice for the amount of roux, unless they wanted you to just eat roux by itself.Now the dessert: chocolate box.  Big.  But, I've had much better at Red Light in Chicago, my ultimate place for chocolate box.  At Jake's, the chocolate itself was acidy and not dark enough at all.  And very, very thin.  I prefer a strong sided box, very dark chocolate like.  Also, there was  a lot of berries, but the whip cream was too heavy (the kind that won't melt because it is SO heavy.  And the chocolate mouse wasn't tasteful and was too darn heavy too.  It's like a french guy did the chocolate box: bleh!  And the rasberry coulis (sauce) was not sweet or tart enough, though it tasted very, very natural, almost too much so.  So, the box overall was very bland, like french desserts, which some people may like.All the food was on the level of a medicore chain, but it shouldn't have been for the prices."},{"name":"Appetito","address":"761 Beacon St","city":"Newton","stars":"2","text":"What a shame! Having grown up in Newton during Appetito's hay day- I was so disappointed by my dinner last night. I took my wife here thinking we'd it would be a little bit of a treat and was I ever wrong. I should have known better when we stood by the front for probably about 3 minutes before anyone saw us or sat us at table. I REALLY should have known when there was 4 dirty tables no one bothered to bus that just sat there. Our entire meal. In defense of my server she was trying and they were understaffed. She had one other server who wasn't up to much but it wasn't busy enough that they couldn't have taken better care of all the customers. Having said that overall the whole place really needs a good scrubbing and a bit of a face lift. I hate it when the menus you're presented with a greasy and have flecks of bread on them. And with no host, manager or anyone of authority present you can't be that surprised that two young servers were really just doing the minimum. Having said all that the food was just not great. I had the salad cuchina which was 1 leaf of spinach and a giant bowl full of over dressed romaine. My wife had the beet salad which was nearly identical except for the beets. Her entree came which was a Milanese of eggplant over pasta and she said it had zero flavor. I had the bolognese which was pretty good (that's what the second star is for) Wine and beer is reasonably priced- I think the pasta is over priced considering its clearly not home made.

The okra pieces were huge and there was quite a bit crammed into the small-ish bowl. I ended up splitting it with my wife.The pulled pork sandwich was good.

Having admittedly ignored the word of mouth about Bono largely due to the hype and excessive commentary on local know-it-all site Columbusunderground ever since Bill Yerkes was baking pies out of the back of Eleni-Christina Bakery in 2008, recent moves in the restaurant had made me rethink my stance and with the location now inside the \\"Corner Market\\" on Northwest Boulevard in what I believe is technically Upper Arlington and featuring a legitimate handmade Neapolitan brick oven I figured there was no better time than on this tour to see if maybe the rumors were true.Opening at 5:00pm according to their website it was with luck that we brought a GPS given the obscure location and limited signage at Bono, but once we parked and figured out that accessing the restaurant meant actually entering through the Corner Market it was with good fortune that we found ourselves as the first patrons of the evening and after a warm greeting by Peggy we were seated at the restaurant's only 4-top-a study wood table with a tablecloth I'm rather certain was actually once a bed sheet and mismatched chairs...some with wheels.  With menus presented we were explained the dynamics of the oven, the sourcing of the ingredients, and finally the $10 for each 10\\" pizza or any three for $25 cash only policy before being left to make our decisions.With options weighed heavily and the three for $25 option too hard to pass up we again decided to go with the concept of making one of our own and ordering a couple of eclectic house made pies - all of which were deemed \\"great choices\\" by Peggy.  With the bar and outdoor seating now filled we were next asked by Bill if we'd like to see the oven at work and while my mother went to peruse the beverage options I watched Bill fire up the first of our pies in their trademarked 1800 degrees F (at the apex and just under 1000 on the floor) with a total cooking time of 145 seconds producing a hot and crispy disc that was subsequently cut and served by Peggy before I even made it back to my seat.For our first pizza we opted for #10 WAIKIKI \\"Jamie Style\\" - a sweet meets savory amalgamation that was surprisingly restrained despite its bold ingredients.  Beginning first with the crust - to be fair it would be my only criticism of Bono...it is simply boring.  Nicely cooked and cracker thin to be sure, but no more nuanced than a Saltine and lacking much chew or openness to the crumb.  Moving on to the sauce - marvelous - and reportedly made that very day from local tomatoes with tons of herbal notes overlying the fruity base notes and acidic bite.  Similar to the tomatoes, Bono does it right when it comes to both the cheese and the toppings - all top quality, all nicely dispersed, and in this case as mentioned before all in perfect balance.For our second pizza, we chose #16, The BIANCA - a veritable salad on top the crispy crust flecked with parmesan and pools of melting gorgonzola that on taste alone I'd assume to be at least 4-5 months age given the sharp aromatic notes.  Another example of what top quality ingredients can do for even the simplest of dishes I'd certainly recommend it for a change of pace...even if it does mean you're missing out on the best tomato sauce in the city.For our final pizza selection we opted for the \\"Design your own\\" with tomato sauce, locally harvested mushrooms, basil, brie, and sun dried tomatoes - and while the crust worked a whole lot better in texture while still lacking flavor this time around, the toppings and sauce once again sprung to life on the palate - particularly the buttery brie and nearly candy-sweet tomatoes punctuated by some of the best fresh basil I've had.With the pizzas now a happy memory Peggy stopped by to ask if we'd care for dessert and after being told \\"we have Belgian waffles that can be topped with hand whipped cream, chocolate, nutella, strawberries, blueberries for $3\\" we said \\"absolutely\\" and after perhaps a 5 minute wait the 5\\"x5\\" waffle arrived stacked nearly 5x its normal height with all but the blueberries.  With forks handed out and each of us digging in I will fully admit that this was one of the least \\"upscale\\" waffles I've had in quite some time, but with a crispy golden exterior and buttery supple inside it was damned good while the toppings, particularly the snappy berries.With the tab paid - $28+tip (no tax) we thanked everyone for the food and made our way to the streets with some calling the pizza the best yet and myself thinking that in all honesty if Bill and Peggy could find a way to improve their crust flavor and consistency this could not only be the best pizza in town, but the kind of oddball store/location/idea that could not only be the best pizza in town, but a \\"destination\\" pizzeria."},{"name":"Tatte Bakery & Cafe","address":"70 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Loved the great breakfast sandwiches and baked goodies at this charming place.

For lunch I ordered the lasagna and a side caesar salad. The lasagna was very good but I would not recommend the caesar salad. The dressing was bland and it came with giant chunks of tomatoes. I didn't realize that caesar salads had tomatoes?? The service was the biggest disappointment.

We ubered from hotel to get here, very glad we did because the park lot is very small. We arrived shortly after 11am and there was no wait no line at all. Our waitress was super nice and friendly. The food, on the other hand, was just OK. We got the beef brisket plate and combo plate with ribs and wings, for sides we got jalapeno cornbread, tater tots, baked beans, and Brunswick stew. All the reviews had raved about chicken wings, and unfortunately they were my least favorite. They were very tough and dry, and not saucy at all. One wing was completely inedible that I had to spit out the meat, because it was THAT dry. Maybe I got the double cooked leftover from the day before? Ribs were also just OK, the meat was not falling off the bone and also a bit and dry. I do like their homemade spicy bbq sauce so I ended up pouring lots of sauce on the ribs. My husband was very disappointed in his brisket, dry and tough. On the brighter side, all sides tasted really yummy, especially the Brunswick stew. So if i were to only judge the sides, it's a 5.

Back in South Florida my gf and I would visit on a regular basis for their consistently tasty and filling dishes; I see this being the case once again. Today happened to be their grand opening so we decided today would be the best time to test this location out; we were not disappointed. I've never seen such a long line at a Pei Wei, but the exceptionally large staff was able to churn the customers in and out at a moderate pace. The layout felt more modern than other locations we've been to, for some reason it reminded me of Chipotle. The natural lighting was also far different from the dimly lit interiors we were used to; I think I prefer the dim (romantic?) lighting, but I don't find it to be that important. The menu has changed quite a bit since our last visit (2 years), but we decided to stick with a few of their classics, Kung Pao Chicken, Chicken Pad Thai, Crab Wontons and a Spicy Tuna Roll. The Crab Wontons offered a crispy and tasty snack while the Spicy Tuna (4 pieces) was surprisingly delicious; maybe it's because we've been craving sushi, but I really had no complaints. The Kung Pao came with perfectly crispy chicken, scallions, garlic, snap peas, carrots, peanuts and topped off with a tasty sauce. I love spicy food so I improved the dish by dousing the rice in their chili sauce which I am obsessed with. My gf's Pad Thai was very solid, but a bit too sweet for my taste. I'm a huge fan of their Orange Tea, but for some reason it was kept empty throughout our visit, yet there's a happy ending because I sampled their Chai Tea which was very delicious!The staff needs more training, but this location has potential."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"We went there on Sunday and had great expectations.

Luckily I had my luggage to sit on, but it had wheels and I fell off it once like I was in a Laurel and Hardy sketch. Yeah I made a Laurel and Hardy reference.

First off, to give you an impression of how popular this place is, there was a line around the building by the time we got there, and it was only 30 minutes after the place opened (it opens at 5pm). And, I overheard some people in line mention that they DROVE ALL THE WAY FROM HOUSTON for ramen from this place. That should say enough, but I'm not done talking. Once we were able to get inside, there was still a line. And, as a word of caution, you have to secure a table before you can order. This is because the food gets served so fast and it is recommended that you eat the ramen noodles right away because they get soggy. But don't worry, there was someone there to help coordinate who would sit where, which was very helpful. I ordered the original with chili on the side. They call it a spicy bomb and the serving is big enough to share between two people. The broth is pretty rich and should be savored. There were myriad flavors to enjoy. and the noodles, pork belly, and aji-tama (the egg) were perfectly cooked. It might be worth mentioning that they serve a vegan ramen option only on Sundays. I might come back to try it because I'm pretty curious. My only issue is the atmosphere. Though the decor was very nice, the space itself was too hot. Albeit, we were all eating hot soup while it was almost 90 degrees outside, but still. I ordered an icy cold imported Coke which made the conditions much more bearable.

The shooting happened and this town hasn't been the same since. I have not tried Brazilian steakhouse before and I have to say that I am a fan!! It's very cool to pick out my own sides but to have repeated persons bringing me assorted meats is something that I'm not sure I can now live without. I have a smaller appetite so picking my sides, and the size of them at the salad bar, really appealed to me. And this is far from a typical salad bar. It's more sides to go along with the amazing protein options. The gentlemen kept coming by with different meats on sticks, including pork, chicken, and beef. I haven't decided which is my favorite but the garlic sirloin is pretty high up on my list of favorites. I know it's not totally fair to judge a steakhouse on their prime rib, but even that was phenomenal. It may feel like sticker shot at $40 a plate but, as a frugal diner, it was worth it! It's all you can eat and then some. I'm pretty sure we went with a third round. This is totally the place to go if you're in Orlando, and I say this as someone with great loyalty to the Darden brand (Olive Garden, Longhorn Steakhouse, etc). The servers are amazing.

I really do.  I mean, there is a definite unfilled niche for places that serve french fries in a healthy, slightly less healthy, or way greasy, but most tasty, style, with fancy toppings.  Also, their eco-conscious angle and their endless deals (20% with Eco Pass, buy-4-get-the-fifth-free punch card) make me really, really want to like this place and make it a regular hangout.  Everything about how they're marketing this place is spot on.But I just wish the food was executed better.  Your amount of toppings will depend entirely on the server who's preparing your dish.  I had the chicken BBQ sauce one (I tried looking up the name on the menu, but for the life of me I can't navigate Spud Bros' blog to just give me a sample menu) twice, and the first time (which was also my first visit) it was simply slathered with sauce dripping down onto the lower layers, sprinkled with green onions so plentiful the dish looked like it was celebrating Christmas, strips of tender chicken, and a blanket of melted cheese.  After eating that, I was like, 'ooh, hey, that was awesome!  And they have a five punch card?  I'll be back!'Unfortunately, the second time I ordered the same thing and it was a totally different experience.  There was hardly anything on top of my mound of fries!  I mean, it sort of sparsely covered the first layer, but after the first layer, I was out of luck - I had a giant plate of plain fries in front of me and had to salt them liberally.  Sort of found myself wishing I had a hamburger or something.On my third visit, I ordered something else, but had the same experience as the second in terms of quantity.And on the fourth one, I got mounds and mounds of toppings again... but they had a really off taste to them - actually, it tasted, more than anything, like the inside of my freezer.If every experience I had was as good as the first one, I'd be stopping in constantly - I don't agree that the prices are high, but maybe that's just because I have a tiny little appetite - and taking a much needed break from Boulder's whole-wheat, raw-food, vegan restaurant theme.

They were tender, crunchy in the right places, moist, and incredibly flavorful.  I had promised two of these to my bf, and it almost killed me to not eat them all.  Seriously.  And my companion Sunday added that the pulled pork was the best she'd ever had.  I believe it.  And I think I'm leaning toward the belief that while I am a moist brisket devotee, the lean brisket here is so good that I think it's my favorite.  It is moist without being overly fatty.  I still order a combination, and have learned to cook with brisket in just about everything (eggs, migas, pasta, you name it), because we get enough to last the week.  Also makes great sandwiches.I will point out that on Saturday the brisket (both types) was drier than it has been before, not as good as usual.  But on Sunday it was back to perfect deliciousness.  This one shortfall I think makes Aaron human.  It can't be totally pefect EVERY time.  The perfection quotient is still much higher than anywhere else I've been.

Several reasons, in fact. First and foremost is their excellent service. From the moment I enter the iconic space on Crescent Street, I'm welcomed and made to feel at home, whether I've dined there recently or not. It doesn't matter which server I'm paired with for the evening, as all are highly trained professionals that balance friendliness and warmth with expertise and guidance. But you're in for a special treat if Bobby is handling your table. He did a superb job of pairing wines with our courses and making sure my birthday dinner was an exceptional experience.If you imbibe, be sure to try one of their signature cocktails. The Sunday in the Park with Mark is a heady combination of Amaras mezcal, Herradura Blanco, basil, lime, and egg foam. Paired with a special appetizer of confit pork cheek, it was a great way to start the evening.Even with my gluten allergy, I never feel deprived at SCK. The gluten-friendly menu has many of their classic dishes, prepared expertly with fresh, local ingredients. The Georges Bank scallops, with celery root, shaved fennel, and grapefruit-tarragon vinaigrette hit all the right first course notes, and the creamy, rich Carolina Gold risotto with English peas, grana Padano cheese, and fresh mint wowed as my entree. (Wine pairings: Donnafugata \\"Anthelia\\" with the scallops and Davis Bynum \\"River West\\" Russian River chardonnay with the risotto.)My dining companion was quite impressed with his filet mignon entree, which was expertly paired with the Atalon cabernet sauvignon from Napa valley. I had a few sips -- this wine is truly amazing and worth the splurge.We finished the meal with a bowl of raspberry sorbet and a glass of brut rose from Sicily, the Col de' Salici.

The noodles are ok but the both is too oily, peppery, and overpowering. It is not a good sign when you can't finish the broth in your bowl (I have on occasion watered my broth down).  It is definitely made for the American palette.  Having said that, I will still be a frequent eater here.

Unfortunately, it seems to me Bao Down has become the definition of a place that, initially, gets a lot of buzz surrounding it's food, and as a result, the quality and due diligence goes downhill......Significantly.

The place wasn't super busy at the time. Can't recall the names, but I believe we ordered at least the Tuna Belly and the Fried Chicken with crispy garlic on-top baos. First off, one of my boyfriend's baos was HARD, which really ruins the experience; it's essentially like having soggy fries. No one thinks of fries and thinks soggy; the two simply don't go together. Hard bao=No bao. Secondly, on my end, the fried chicken bao's fried chicken wasn't exactly fresh. I ended up taking what little chunk of meat was there out of my bao and dissecting it myself because I simply couldn't enjoy biting into it as a whole as the chicken was so tough and dry.Thirdly, on this occasion, they really did skimped out on the other ingredients and especially the sauce; if you're going to serve us food that's obviously been sitting out for awhile, the least you could do is douse everything in liquid to mask the definitely (not)-in-a-good way crunchyness of everything.Overall, let-down is the word I would choose, especially for a place I know can hit the marklike it has before.

Its always on stand-by if we're feeling like some delish Tex-Mex. The margaritas are great and I tend to order my old favorites: Queso dip and Black Bean empanadas. Both are great. The BEST part about Border Cafe is that it is cheap, cheap, cheap. You can't beat their prices for what you get. The only reason I didn't give Border Cafe 5 stars is because they don't take reservations and in general there is always a wait. On the plus side, you can easily grab a marg while waiting and they are super generous with chips and salsa. Also, the food comes out really fast so they do try to turn the tables over quickly. \\nOne helpful tip: Avoid wearing anything that holds onto smells! Wool coats, winter coats, sweaters, scarves, etc. You WILL need to dry clean these after dining at Border Cafe unless you don't mind the lingering smell of Texas/Mexico border and fried chips.  You could negate all the cheap prices with a hefty dry cleaning bill."},{"name":"Sushi Town","address":"5935 Hastings Street","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"This is my neighbourhood so I've been here a few times.

However, do not let my predetermined biases cloud your beliefs as I think Screen Door is ultimately a great, and fairly inexpensive brunch experience. Disclaimer, I've never really been to the South, nor had I had really amazing fried chicken, so I have nothing to really compare to.My GF and I came here on a weekday, at around noon, hoping we would hit that sweet spot between brunch goers and late lunch grabbers, but alas, we were still a bit early by about 1 hour (1pm seems to be the sweet time to avoid lines). After waiting for about 30 minutes, and feeling like we were being punished for being enveloped in the aroma of fried chicken and gravy, we were finally let into the establishment. The waiter was nice, albeit a bit on the succinct side, but explained all of the menu options and the daily special. My GF and I shared the chicken and waffle (two pieces), the okra fritters, and one biscuit with gravy along with the praline bacon slices, accompanied by the $8 bloody mary and $2.5 all you can drink Stumptown coffee. The biscuits came first, sliced in half and drenched in sausage gravy, and while the GF really liked it...I was kinda unimpressed as the biscuit was cold, if it weren't for the warm gravy and it lacked that delicious gooey texture I've come to love in a freshly made biscuit. Also, the cost of gravy is almost twice the biscuit....suspicious. As for the praline bacon, we were given 3 very generous slices, smothered in honey and sprinkled with cayenne pepper and nuts. They were certainly tasty, and I will warn you, they can go down real easy since the sugary coating removes a lot of that greasy sensation. I was really excited for the okra, and we were given a huuuge platter of fried okra pieces that took me the rest of brunch to finish. I would have liked less cornmeal breading on my okra....and actually just eat the okra by themselves, but I can see how others enjoy the entire experience. As for the piece-de-resistance, the chicken-n-waffles...it was alright. The fried chicken was definitely breaded very well, with hints of peppers and spices with an equal savory component to the waffles as well. However, I just wasnt a super big fan. If you plan on sharing, I think one piece of chicken may not feed both people, so please order accordingly (unless you plan on ordering a ton of other fried goodies as well).I very much enjoyed the delicious Stumptown brew and the bloody mary was good, but not spicy enough.Overall, I think Screen Door justifies in their proclaimation as one of the most popular brunch establishments in Portland and would recommend people to check it out, not just out of notoriety, but for their food as well.Food: 4 stars\\nPrice: 3 stars\\nAmbiance: 3 stars\\nService: 3 stars"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"So you wait a year and a half to eat someplace because the line is 3 blocks long, you finally get in all excited and the service sucks.

If you're looking for a place that you just feel comfortable at, this is it.We went for brunch at Cypress Street for the first time this past weekend. I ordered the Plain Jane 2-egg breakfast, which came with asiago grits and a biscuit, for $5. My bf ordered the BYOB (Build Your Own Biscuit) with everything, for $5 I believe. We also ordered a side of pancakes for $2 and sausage for $1. No matter what the food tasted like, we both felt the prices were unbelievably reasonable... considering most of the brunch places we frequent it will cost us much more than $15/couple. So how was the food, you ask? It was delicious. My eggs, prepared over medium, were cooked exactly the way I like over medium eggs-- with most of the yolk cooked but not all of it. The grits, which cost $1 as a side item, were so yummy with the asiago cheese! And the biscuit was not one of the wussy biscuits you would expect at any other brunch- it was HUMONGOUS, soft and fluffy, but flaky at the same time, with just the right amount of buttermilk taste. I was very impressed.My bf overall enjoyed his biscuit sandwich. Nothing incredible, but the price could not be beat. We were both not a huge fan of the pancakes. We were expecting much smaller portions of grits and biscuit, so by the time we got to pancakes we didn't have much. We both recognized the flavor of the pancakes and syrup as something very similar to the taste of McDonald's hotcakes. This is not an insult as I could probably speed-eat McDonald's hotcakes, but just the taste of them was similar. I also had mimosa, which I would probably not order again. It was nothing fancy and I probably could have just stuck with OJ. The only (ONLY!) reason I'm not giving Cypress Street 5 stars is because I have been there a few times lately where I did not have that same, neighborhood feeling I spoke to before. Instead it has been just like any other bar in Midtown - the clientele dressed to impress, fruity drinks being served, a wait for the bathroom, and requiring cash in hand to get the bartender's attention. This is not the Cypress Street I know and love, so I'm wondering if the popularity of this place (both by word of mouth and by Yelp) may be ruining it."},{"name":"Revival","address":"129 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"The food was perfect. I ordered the catfish + field peas with sweet cream butter and dill. I was with a couple friends and also sampled the friend chicken, heirloom tomato salad, and green tomato casserole. Everything was completely fabulous (oh, and the entrees come with the best cornbread you've ever tasted). The major downside was that our waitress acted really pissed that we wanted separate checks and just made a huge deal about it. It was strange because- is this not a normal occurrence?

Ordered lean brisket, some sausages, potato salad, and cole slaw. I admit the brisket was extremely tender and delicious. However, everything else was average.

The 5-hour wait flew by, and every second was worth it after biting into that tender, melty brisket.THE MEATS:\\nThe turkey gets slathered in a buttery dressing to keep it moist and full of flavor, and the pulled pork is flawless - not too tender, not too chewy, and just the right amount of smokiness. I thought the sausages were a little generic and lacking in flavor, but I could be spoiled by the custom craft sausages made daily down the street at Micklethwait. Either way, most of the meats were top tier in terms of quality and flavor, and I don't believe you can find better brisket.THE SAUCES:\\nThe barbecue sauces were amazing as well, ranging from vinegar-based to syrupy espresso flavor. The thick, dark espresso barbecue sauce is unlike anything I've ever tasted and is a must try for first-timers. The mild barbecue sauce has a classic tang with a slight heat kick to it, and the vinegar-based sauce is perfectly sweet.THE SIDES:\\nIf you're going in for some sides, the potato salad is heavy on the mustard and not chunky, but the pinto beans are a smokey and savory treat, and the classic slaw is fresh with a nice wet crunch.THE STAFF:\\nThe staff are some of the friendliest people in one of the friendliest cities. My spirits were genuinely lifted by the sincere, upbeat attitudes of all the staff and their helpfulness in taking orders, telling us the status of the line, how long we'd be waiting, etc. All around great people who seem very happy to be working there!OVERALL:\\nEven given the long wait, if I had a day to kill and a hankering for BBQ, there's no other place I'd rather go."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This was the best breakfast place I have ever been to!

Everything was just sub-par. Not the equivalent to a \\"delicious escape with a dashing young carny gentleman with funnel cake shooting from every orifice\\" that I was expecting... Thankfully we didn't have a problem with wait time or service as seems to be the common complaint, it was surprisingly pretty dead, so it seems we came at a prime time for quality right? Pfh. We ordered the:\\nFryinstein Monster in Cornbread Batter (It was so greasy that the batter was mushy, it was almost inedible, and for a girl who LOVES just about any fried junk food, this is saying a lot.

Note to all you who have made reservations after perusing the menu that's been circling online: Per our waitress, they will only be serving the fried chicken OR the country fried steak each night, but are not able to serve both on the same night. No idea how you'll know what night to go on if you are craving one or the other, but we were really disappointed that we couldn't try them both last night. Cocktails were delish, Sweet Tea was on point! very tea-y without putting you into a sugar coma. We had the deviled ham tea sandwiches to start and they were very tasty and a nice size portion for the price. Then out came the skillet cornbread - literally the best thing we had all night - someone Chef Gillespie has made cornbread light and silky and also taste like bacon... so obviously you need that in your life. Our group tried the Fried Chicken, Catfish w/tomato gravy and Meatloaf for entrees and the skillet corn, mac-n-cheese, mashed potatoes, and peas. Everything was pretty good with one overwhelming observation about almost everything - too salty. What we were recommend: fried chicken which was perfectly prepared, skillet corn good god good (a crack of fresh pepper would put this over the top), and the mac-n-cheese which tasted like you'd bitten into a block of sharp cheddar! nom nom nom. Things to skip: mashed potatoes just not great, little flavor, and yet somehow greasy.\\nPossibly the meatloaf - I only had a bite and don't love meatloaf but thoughts from others at my table(and one across the room) were too salty, and that the meat to sauce ratio was off. The meatloaf is really thick and there is only a very thin splattering of sauce on top. To sum up: Really very good, not the best meal I've ever had.

Elk foie gras sliders with blueberry jam- too much bread but that's easily corrected. I'm a sucker for foie gras and elk apparently and mixed the sweetness from the jam. this was rich, cleaver and devoured quickly.Deviled gulf coast blue crabs- this is the type of dish you don't want to share. if there's more than two of you order more.Maybe:Elk Steak- the sides were lacking except the candied grapes i don't know what they were doing there but i enjoyed them on their own. the steak was fine, pretty rare but better than the beef. (if you like medium rare maybe tell them medium here) This was overpriced. I'm not paying but i still like to get someone's money's worth. they rely too heavily on the meat (cook it as ordered then) and they don't do much with sides for their main dishes. Fireside Snapper- apparently fireside means you can charge $36. Is snapper being considered wild game here? It was cooked well and tasty just nothing exceptional. there's better tasting and cheaper snapper all over town (Mongers Market, Perla's etc.)Ancho Chile Chocolate Cake- the cake was moist and rich. the vanilla ice cream was weak and served too cold so it was hard and awkward. It was a good piece of chocolate cake. I didn't taste the ancho chile part. unless you're a chocolate addict you can skip this, you've had it before.Miss:Roasted Garlic Stuffed Beef Tenderloin- I had to send this back. I asked for medium rare and it was more rare blue. It was cold rare on the inside. I'd rather it be bleeding than cold to the touch. the sauce tasted cheap. I don't like A1 but this was worse. If i never have \\"western plaid hash\\" again i'll be just fine. this dish was a disaster for me. i didn't try the asparagus. I bet that was the best part. Prime NY Strip- This meat was chewy. Maybe cows aren't wild enough for these guys because they didn't seem to care as much about the preparation. I didn't know if i was going to get it down. I was just glad it wasn't what i ordered but i had to send back my beef too for being too rare and this one had the opposite problem. Corn Fried Catfish- too much breading and barely any sauce. The fish was lost.Fideos with Crawfish- this tasted like a cajan asian disaster or is this a spanish inspired dish? Regardless, it felt out of place on the menu(the waitress recommended it, why?) That \\"natural aioli\\" had no flavor. Oily noodles is what i remember most from this.I'd say if you want to check it out, try the elk and crab apps but avoid the pricey mediocore mains."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I made reservations 10 days in advance. 10people @7pm.

Most people were probably there for Motorhead more so than the food anyhow.

What I can tell you is that the BBQ I had at Stubbs was pretty underwhelming. I was expecting fall-off-the-bone, super tender, perfectly flavored meat. What I got I felt I could have gotten at a Friday's or Applebee's. The brisket had a processed meat-like consistency, the ribs were pretty bland, and the sausage, while the most tasty of the 3 meats, had casing that felt like I was biting through a ziploc bag.So, Stubbs BBQ sauce at my local supermarket?

I think they use a different kind of pickle, too.  Anyway, it was gross and I sent it back.  I sat at the bar, since I was waiting for a friend to arrive. The female bartender spent the entire time chatting with other employees.  She wasn't helpful or friendly.  I had to ask a passing server for silverware.

The Po'boy was a-okay for me as I thought there was too much bread. But I have to say that the mac and cheese was solid, so make sure to get that for your side.

The car is slowly coming at you and there's this uneasy feeling of sorts, but not necessarily a bad one. You don't know what's going to happen when that car gets to you, but you can't help but watch and wait to find out what's coming. What happens when the car gets there? A really great movie, that's what. Turning onto East 6th, it feels like the street gets narrower. At night, it's pretty dark and I'd never quite gone this far. This is where that slight uneasy feeling entered. I found myself surveying the neighborhood passing by and not knowing what would happen when I got to what looked like a dead end. What happened? I had a really great meal at Mettle. We had the escargot to start, which was a wise decision. They come in a savory chipotle-kaffir lime butter sauce and it's plated with grilled baguette slices. They're very tender and the dish is perfect for two people to share. For the entr√©e, my long neglected need for a really good burger was finally satiated. I have to say, I really appreciated that they didn't need to do anything terribly complex with it. They are working with really great ingredients and didn't have to dress it up to create some fancy gourmet, bells-and-whistles burger. It's simple and really tastes great. Hats off to the kitchen for sending me a perfectly medium rare burger! Too many times have I been burned by something coming out medium to medium well, which I don't find enough of a crime to send back. I ended up deconstructing my burger as I went on so as to experience the patty sans bread/toppings/etc and it really was great meat. Over the course of the evening, I observed several other dishes making their way to other tables and each of them looked just as great as what I was eating, so there is much to try here. The service was great from start to finish. The bar area is very open and has this wicker structure in the center that is really striking. In the other dining area, there's a large, modern chandelier over one of the tables that's rather pretty. The interior has this industrial-chic feel that really works for the location. And if that's not enough, they have a really great patio. I seriously cannot wait for warm weather to come back to us. Where I was sitting in the restaurant had a good view of the neighborhood and the area and sitting outside on that patio just seems like it'd be conducive to a really great time. They have happy hour from Tuesday to Saturday from 3pm-7pm and I'll be damned if I don't intend on spending a good number of happy hours on that patio indulging in conversation and the $5 bar snack/appetizer menu.

The mashed potatoes were a nice addition, but I'm confident that I can live without the collard greens...We also tried the jambalaya and I think that the spices (in terms of both seasoning and heat) were lacking... the flavors of the andouille sausage and chicken did help the dish.Though the main entrees disappointed me, my favorites from the evening (and perhaps a reason I'd return) are the side dishes... I LOVE sweet potato fries... ok, maybe that was too much... I love sweet potato fries!!! so delicious! these fries were perfectly sweet and salty and definitely not greasy.I also liked the mac && cheese... the cheesy baked goodness totally nailed my mac and cheese cravings...It was good to try Screen Door, and though I'd like to say that I will revisit the place, I'm not sure if side dishes would justify another trip."},{"name":"U & Me Restaurant","address":"4646 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"ËÆ≤ÈÅìÁêÜÔºåËøôÂÆ∂È§êÈ¶ÜÂú®‰∏≠È§êÈ¶ÜÈáåÁÆóÊØîËæÉÂç´ÁîüÁöÑ„ÄÇËèúÂë≥ÈÅì‰πüÂæàÂõΩÂÜÖ‰∫Ü„ÄÇThis is a great restaurant with traditional Chinese taste and high quality."},{"name":"The Wild Horse Cafe","address":"392 Cabot St","city":"Beverly","stars":"3.5","text":"I love the Wild Horse Cafe!

The line doesn't move much, but the staff is totally fair about what they can offer you and how the restaurant works.

As de rigueur and humdrum as that may sound, there is something to be admired in their perfection.\\n     A word of warning to first time diners: the portions look deceivingly small and it is very easy to get filled up before your dinner arrives.

Furthermore, the sandwich was grilled giving it a nice overall presentation, and some resistance to the juices of the pulled pork. It held up okay, but there was some sogginess. The sandwich has some mustard, pickles, braised pork, bacon and I believe there was some cheese in there.The pickles added a nice nuance, they tasted like house pickles, mellow. Cheese adds some creaminess. The braised pork was not as tender or juicy and I'd like. As for flavor, It was difficult to get a sense of the braised pork as the bacon was overpowering it. Honestly, the bacon poses a problem here. While it adds some crispiness, the drawback is the saltiness it brings and in combination with braised pork, it was overkill. This might be an unpopular opinion, but while bacon can add a great nuance or accent to a dish, as a main component it is obnoxious. Salty and greasy. I'd like this sandwich without bacon. And I know what all you bacon-heads are thinking and I don't give a lick!

Short Version: \\nTaste like a healthier gringo version of southern/soul food. Longer Version:\\nI came here for dinner because the reviews made it seem spectacular. I was sadly disappointed.I ordered the fried chicken with a side of Mac n cheese and greens. The portion size was amazing, until I started eating and realized the chicken was mostly just batter. The flavor was ok, but most of it came from the batter. After removing most of it, the chicken was simply under seasoned. I solved this issue with hot sauce. The Mac and cheese was really good, I love it when places know to bake the top for a delicious crust of cheese. The flavor was good, but every time I took a bite I got the feeling it was missing something. Good effort on the collards. They are very hard to conquer so I won't be too picky. The ham hock inside the greens was tough-which means they weren't a fresh batch. I also felt like they were missing something, and compensated with hot sauce. Brian was our server, and he was really sweet. I told him I drink a lot of water and he brought a pitcher to the table instead of having me go dry. The meal cost $17. As someone that's grown up in the south and in a soul food loving family, I should've known better. An amazing plate of soul/southern food is typically around $12. It's a very popular restaurant and a rather small space. So we were eye to eye with the behinds of many servers, runners, and bussers during our meal.

Always a plus in Austin.The event I attended was probably 100+ people during 7-11 pm, and their waitstaff was pretty swamped by us, but still provided prompt, phenomenal service while remaining patient and friendly.  The bartenders are very happy to provide samples, mix you up a special something, and chitchat with you.  They even prepared a few surprise special drink recipes beforehand just for our event, which really was top notch of them.  Everything was delicious.  I also had the spicy capirinha and Italian barbera from their regular menu, and they were great.  We had dinner at about 10pm, and even that late the food was awesome, and didn't take long to come out.  The waitress was very accommodating of any changes we wanted to make.  We tried the lamb tikki masala, the beef tongue bahn mi, the boudin, broccoli w manchego, and the pork confit tacos.  Talk about yum!!  The naan bread served with the lamb was so good, we asked for extra.  The pork confit tacos were incredibly tasty yet simple, and served on this great wooden slab.  The broccoli and manchego was so delicious that my friend commented he'd scarf it down like it was brisket.  Too full to get to dessert, but that's just a reason to come back later :)    Overall wonderful place, whether for an event, dinner, or just hanging out drinking in the bar area.

The white pear sangria, however, could not have been improved on in any way - so delicious we had two pitchers of it between the three of us.  And I was STARVING, so imagine my delight when my appetizer arrived (the Spicy Ahi Tuna \\"Cabo Rolls\\") and was much heartier than I had imagined.  The rolls were a sort of deep-fried wonton wrapper stuffed with rice, raw ahi tuna and a spicy sauce, among other things, and there was a salad that came with it, too.  The salad dressing was a lime vinaigrette that was to die for.  For an entree I had the Negra Modelo Braised Pork Shoulder with Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Port and Fig Jam and Baby Arugula.  HUGE portion - I couldn't finish it - but so delicious.  The port and fig jam went really well with the mild chili sauce on the pork, and the mashed potatoes were perfectly smooth.

A friend of mine and I couldn't choose, so we decided to order different things and split them.

I'm so glad we split them because while both were fantastic, I think an entire serving of either might have been too much.And now, let me tell you about the funkiest of their breakfast cocktails, the Brass Monkey: a 40 of Colt 45 (for real) with orange juice.

My wife and I, and another couple made a reservation a month earlier for an adult night out...you can imagine how sacred that is. \\nWe arrived at 6:15 for our 6:30 reservation. The hostess checked us in and we went around back for a pre-dinner cocktail. We came back around to the hostess stand at 6:30 and were told our table would be ready in a few minutes. Five minutes later the hostess returned to inform us that our table was ready BUT \\" we have a party of twelve with a reservation for that table so you will have an hour and twenty minutes to eat\\". That took a moment to sink in but we felt that would be enough time. We were seated and our server came over to greet us, first words out of her mouth...\\"we have another reservation for this table so, we're going to need to hurry up and get you out of here\\" and continued to say \\" we're having record sales this month and we need to keep that going\\"..wow; I'm almost ready to walk out at this point but after a few minutes of making light of it among ourselves we got over that. The server did return to say the manager was going to do something for us as she could feel our displeasure. \\nSkip ahead to ordering dinner, we've all rapidly decided on what we want so that we don't exceed our time limit. My wife orders the Pork chop; again the server - \\"oh, we're out of pork chops, I should have told you. We do have everything else on the menu\\". Ok, Really!?! Folks, it's 6:45 on a Saturday evening dinner shift; your OUT of Pork chops? The remainder of dinner was pretty uneventful except for the 30 minute forgotten drink, and then the incorrect drink when it came. In all fairness, she did leave the watered down (it had obviously been sitting) old fashioned, free of charge. We concluded with deserts while we closed out our tab and fended off the stares of the party of 12 that had obviously been informed that we were the reason their table wasn't ready. \\nNever heard from the manager to this point. We walked out while we discussed our plan for the remainder of the evening ultimately deciding to go back in to the bar for one more cocktail before calling it an evening. As we were finishing our cocktails the manager came over to apologize for the exuberance of his host staff in there Insistence that we adhere to a strict time limit for our dinner. He went on to explain how they do routinely hold reservations for 15 minutes; \\"when people are late, our staff gets a little more strict about timing\\" we did remind him that we arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation. He rewarded us with lemon drop shots (couldn't have been more inconsistent with our cocktail selections) and apologized. I couldn't help but notice that if we hadn't returned for cocktails there would have been no acknowledgement whatsoever. \\nSummary: Not warm and inviting or friendly for that matter. I consider it a fail to run out of an entree at 6:45 in the evening. I've had better fried chicken and would think that for $45pp you would at least get a breast of fried chicken. Cocktail selection poor, beer and wine selections worse. Food overall was good, but for the money I would go elsewhere. I was really looking forward to going and really thought I would like it but I left with no desire to return."},{"name":"Milestone 229","address":"229 Civic Center Dr","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This place has a beautiful interior and wonderful views of the river.

It was so tough that I couldn't even take an actual bite of it. The avocado was as expected. The only part of the meal I really enjoyed were the fries. They were good, and when dipped in the ancho sauce, they were even better. If I came back here, it would probably only be for the fries or to try the cheese sticks or fried pickles.

We had a male server. He messed up our drinks three times as we waited a half hour for them. However, the drinks were great! We also let out server know it was a special occasion we were celebrating and wanted to surprise the bride with a dessert ( which he did not remember). Our waiter messed up and forgot three of our entrees and didn't realize until we told him we didn't have our food after waiting for 15 minutes. He brought over a menu to us and asked us to point out what he ordered...he did not apologize once for the poor service or mistakes. The food here is really great here and usually the service is not this poor.

I believe they still employ good, fresh ingredients and virtually all of the front staff appear very friendly and helpful.   However -- and again this isn't a one-off -- I've experienced repeated cases of poorly maintained tables and many occasions of salsa (Roja) so runny that it's barely distinguishable from muddy water, if not downright translucent.  In cases of the latter, sometimes staff would open the salsa and get it well stirred up and re-primed, and other cases hand me some pre-filled cups with properly thickened salsa.   Other cases, I've been left to try and fix it myself, and recently had an employee just shrug it off without offering any help.   Returning to the cleanliness, I get they can be pretty busy -- insanely busy -- so keeping up with the tables requires some dedicated effort.   But, I've also been there often during off peak times, and still seen a sea of tables with spilled salsa, chip crumbs, left over straws, etc. without anyone appearing to clean them.   Last, but not least, there's the parking issue.   While that's not a Tacodeli failing unto itself, visitors should be well advised that securing parking at this location can be a nightmare and has just seemed to get worse.  Again, even during off peak times, you're really at the mercy of the parking gods to smile upon you.  When you make a call-in order, don't expect to score any of the parking spots marked for short-term (e.g. 5-minute?) with the ability to dash in and dash out.

We actually grabbed the last parking spot before heading inside. Upon entering the Gastropub  you get a cool hipster (if that is even possible) vibe. My husband and I were seated immediately and both ordered Warsteiner on tap. We decide to split two plates and started off with the wings. The wings were seasoned and had a thai chili dipping sauce. The wings were not your typical wings at all. They were huge (always bigger in Texas, eh?) and came with maybe 3-4? wings. This was a hit at our table and the thai sauce kicked them upThe main meal we also split which was Atlantic Cod Fish and Chips- consisting of Mashed peas, malt chips and Meyer lemon remoulade. This came with a little vile squirting device of malt vinegar. It was a strange meal to split but we managed to do it. The fish was crispy but was not a fan of the \\"chips\\".

The Squealing Pig is a decent nightlife spot most of the week with the usual mix of college students and the doctor/nurse crowd from the Longwood medical area. \\nThursday nights at the Pig are a whole different story, the place gets packed to capacity (which doesn't take much) with college kids there to see Mike Barrett (http://www.wankinsong.com/index.htm) an interesting \\"entertainer\\". He sings dirty sing-along songs and the crowd chants and pounds on the tables to the tune. It's quite a spectacle and I would say for the sheer experience go with some friends some night and check it out. There is no cover and the beer selection is better then most other places in the area, although seating is limited so arrive early.\\nOn to the food selection, The Squealing Pig's menu is surprisingly extensive with everything from fajitas to Sheppard's pie to great French fries.

This time I started the night with a Northeast Kingdom cocktail; - gin, mulled wine, lemon, etc.  It was smooth and delicious.  I tasted my friend's Moonlight cocktail - vodka, allspice dram, ginger, which was also excellent.  The bar continues to create great mixed drinks!  We had 10 plates between the 4 of us, and we were stuffed!  Some portions were huge, like the smoked lamb belly ribs, which were awesome - sweet, crispy, fatty goodness.  We had a bunch of solid dishes: the burger and the pork belly with apples (though I didn't think the pork belly was as good as it was in October).  We had some great dishes: the corn pancakes served with maple syrup and popcorn (OMG so good), the fried brussels sprouts, and the kale salad.  Then some not so great ones.  Everyone at the table agreed the chilled poached chicken salad was a fail - sort of clammy and bland.  The burrata wasn't as good as last time.  Winter finds it served with sunchokes and prunes.  I found the 'crust' a bit chewy, the flavors not as exciting.  The bone marrow croquetta were not what I expected.  They were just little friend things; the bone marrow was completely lost.  We also had the rabbit stew.  The rabbit meat was delicious - tender and well flavored, but the buttermilk dumplings were too heavy/solid, kinda like a matza ball.  So 6 out of 10 were good, and a few were sort of boring.  Alden and Harlow continues to be a (expensive) fun experience.  I liked going with 4 people as you get to taste so much more.

I am so glad I did because this place is more than I thought it was.  Yes, it is a panaderia but they also offer a respectable menu. I haven't checked out the food beyond the pan dulce but, from the looks of the other customers, their food must be pretty good.  I'll check out the regular menu some other time.  For now, I can attest to the various pan dulce, pastries, and cookies.

I have lived all over the world and have had my fair share of barbecue including KC, Dallas, Houston, St. Louis, Carolinas and numerous other places that claim to have the best barbecue. So I decided to try the famous Fat Matts. The line is no problem since the counter is right inside the door so don't get discouraged if lined up outside. Personality of employees is mixed so just go with it. Food. I had the ribs and the chicken. The chicken was very dry, way more than smoked meat should be. I am glad they give you sauce on the side. The ribs were fine if you can find the meat. The fat to meat ratio was extremely high compared to other rib joints around. Meat was tender and the sauce is very good but overall quality and enjoyment of the meal keeps me wondering if ATL has decent barbecue.  (I tried several sides from coleslaw to beans and mac&cheese  which were all fine).  The guy/beggar asking patrons for money in the outside seating section was unappealing too. Send me a note and let me know where the best barbecue in Atlanta is as I continue my 1 year of reviews of this great city."},{"name":"Sugar Factory","address":"8371 International Dr, Ste 70","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Made reservations and was seated early with my family of 6.

However, this place is definitely for the adventurous eaters.Even the burger is called the \\"secret burger\\" that requires your faith as sells out early in the night (so don't bring any picky eaters).

Pok Pok is one of our favorite restaurants and we have never had a bad experience in the many times we've eaten there. Service and food at Pok Pok are always good. After hearing that Andy Ricker was one of the owners of Foster Burger, I anticipated the same quality service and food. I was sorely disappointed. Here's how the meal went down: We arrived at 5:10, ten minutes after opening, to an already 1/2 full waiting room of diners. We all could clearly see that only 2 tables had been seated. There were obvious looks of confusion on all our faces as to why there wasn't an effort to seat us if the entire restaurant was empty.  From what I could see there were two cooks/chefs in the kitchen, two servers on the floor, and one bartender. One of the servers was playing double duty as hostess. She was pleasant and did her best to explain to us that they were staggering the tables so the kitchen wouldn't get slammed (poor woman having to bear the brunt of what I'm sure is not her decision to stagger the tables). While this may be true, it doesn't add up that even after that explanation it took 10 more minutes for her to seat 2 more tables. Since we were about 4th on the waiting list, at that rate (2 tables seated every 10 minutes) we were faced with waiting another 20 minutes for our table, a total of 30 minutes, with an empty restaurant staring us in the face...do you see how frustrating that be for a customer? It leaves the impression that you aren't prepared to be open at 5 and need extra time to get it together, or that the competency level of the staff is not up to handling a new successful restaurant. Neither of which might be true but those are the lines of logic that run through a customer's head when trying to figure out why we were waiting when the restaurant is empty. Here's the deal, I get it, you've just opened, there have been write ups, you get slammed because everyone wants to try your restaurant. Our first visit to your restaurant has to be a home run. As an experienced diner, I am more than happy to wait for a table, when it makes sense. None of this made sense. What made even less sense is why the staff isn't offering to get folks a beverage while waiting. With a drink in hand most people are content to wait, not to mention they are less likely to leave in frustration because now they have a tab open. Most of all, you could be increasing your revenues by at least 10% on each ticket if you sold beverages to the waiting. Pok Pok gets that whole formula, they have dedicated hosts, they have servers actively getting drinks into the hands of those waiting, I don't understand why that formula hasn't transferred to this new restaurant. In the time we waiting we saw 8 people leave in frustration, and we were just about to leave when we were called to be seated. Seriously, in this economy can you afford to lose those 8 potential customers who now are spreading the word to their friends, family and associates that they will never go back to Foster Burger? I noticed right after we were seated, around 6pm, two more staff people came on shift. It's Saturday, you know you're going to get hit at opening, why wouldn't you bring these two people on shift at opening??All that said, once we were seated things went well for the most part. Our server was a bit abrupt, but she was one of the people who just came on shift, and she took our order as she was tying her apron on. She didn't tell us the specials and didn't check back after we got our food to see if we wanted another beer (more lost revenue). Let me say this loud and clear, THE FOOD WAS GREAT. Burger was flavorful, cooked to medium to perfection, bun was delicious, hand cut fries good, though I would advise against salting them, let the customer salt them to taste.The weird wait at the beginning had us thinking that maybe this was going to be more upscale than it was. When all is said and done, this is a burger joint, the burgers delivered in plastic baskets lined with checkered paper. You have got to figure out the opening strategy, and the waiting room situation. What is the solution? Hire another cook, more servers, a dedicated host/hostess? If you need to stagger, then maybe require reservations though this would be antithetical to the whole burger joint vibe. I'm sorry that all this needed to be said. I want Foster Burger to be awesome, it's in our neighborhood and there is nowhere else near that will give us grass fed beef, cooked to perfection on a delicious bun that was baked next door. Please work it out, but until then I'm afraid we won't be back anytime soon."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Fun hot dog joint with good selection of vegan and vegetarian hot dogs.

With such a small selection I expected the icing to be piped onto the cupcake when I ordered it, but no, they were pulled out of a storage container.During my contemplative cupcake adventure at Hey Cupcake I realized that these are way too sweet for my taste.  I thought the cake was good, but the large quantity of icing really did it in for me.  I know it is just a personal preference to have less icing, and that the ratio of icing to cake is what makes a cupcake a cupcake, so I'm not criticizing them on this.  All-in-all I thought it was O.K.  I think that things could have been done better, and I might be a touch too critical, but I'm just giving my opinion.  Would I go back to Hey Cupcake?  Probably not - just not my thing."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"OMG absolutely terrible, I'll tell you the largest reason it was bad; manager Tyler.I came in almost two years priors and gave a 5 star review except for the soggy pickle chips.I was offered a free appetizer the next time I come in. I came in last night and met two amazingly wonderful people and then I was told \\"Tyler will take care of you.\\" I thought that it was nice because even though the company is on their own they didn't have to honor it.Onto dinner: the appetizer I chose was deconstructed crab Rangoon with very greasy but delicious (probably from the fat) fried wonton wrappers.I ordered a Cowfish Bento box. Where the beans were good the sweet potato fries were very salty! I couldn't bear them so I sent it back after eating almost nothing. I then ordered a California roll and fries with truffle oil and cheese. OMG the amount of salt on these were ridiculous too! So I sent this item back too.I ate the California roll and it was pretty good except the rice was more vinegar than it needed to have.To recap: I was given a free appetizer from a prior visit\\nI ordered and ate: \\n(one) California Roll\\nI ordered and didn't eat: \\n(one) fries with truffle oil and Parmesan\\n(one) Cowfish Bento BoxWhat was I charged for? Fries with truffle oil and California roll.I mentioned to Tyler the manager that I didn't eat the fries at all and I told him why. I mentioned that I didn't eat the Bento box and I told him why. He relied in a VERY snotty voice: so you just didn't like anything did you?! Wow! That made me feel so uncomfortable while I was waiting on my bill.Why would I pay for something I didn't eat? My bill should've been: (one) California roll however it ended up being (one) California roll and truffle fries. Tyler stated \\"you got your free appetizer with the deconstructed crab Rangoon.

Got up early, drove down, got there about 7:00 am. Sign on the door says \\"Closed for a private party.\\"  WHAT? No mention on their web site that they were closed. So we figured that oh well, we'll go to Muellers. But it's Wednesday and Muellers is closed on Wednesday. Still, I thought, what if the sign were left over from last night? So we drove back by at 7:20 am but there was still no one in line and the window sign still said closed. Other people who had just gotten there were also leaving. When I got home I emailed Franklin to let them know how disappointed we were. They wrote me back almost immediately and apologized, saying that the sign was left over from the night before and that they were open today but no one had taken down the sign yet.  So.....the extra star is for the very nice and very prompt email reply. We ended up going to la Barbecue later in the morning, their brisket was phenomenal, it was a beautiful day, we were able to use the drinks in our cooler, and the wait in line was about 20-25 minutes.

The obligatory steamship round of beef is expertly and generously carved (rare, please!). I am particularly fond of three veggies when they have them: eggplant casserole, steamed rutabagas, and boiled okra, slurp! Their mac 'n cheese is more like what Aunt Mildred called a \\"cheese pie\\". made with eggs, cheddar, and pasta- good. The jalapeno cornbread is snappy, and the cracklin' bread is way good.

The rest of the restaurant was empty, so I had expected service to be very quick. However, service here was actually surprisingly slow when we visited. I'm not sure why- perhaps cooks take time off during the afternoon when they aren't expecting many people. Either way, I felt like the service could be sped up a little bit.This place has waiter service, and as I said above, ours was quite slow, since they didn't come to take our order until a good fifteen minutes after we had sat down again (again, the place was basically empty).We ordered a lot of the typical things, including the slaw, ribs, cornbread, fried wings, etc. Pretty much everything here was good. They include multiple different kind of sauces at the table for your ribs, so you can put whatever you like on them. The only thing that I will say was kind of odd was the chicken. We got the half chicken, and when they served it to us, it was... green. I don't know why it was green, but it was definitely green. I didn't ask why, so I suppose that's my fault. I may never find out why. The chicken is alright, a little sour, perhaps due to the green coating that continues to baffle me.

So this is what ribs are really supposed to be like! So thick and juicy..These are not baby backs, but spare ribs...Let me just tell you that they rocked my face off. It's kinda embarrassing to admit this, but after indulging in a rib sandwhich, I had to make my way back into the long line to order a full rack of ribs to be split at our table. They make your mouth water. I even had visions of programming their phone number into my cell phone for some after-work-pick up action. But, I'm sure that would not be a very healthy habit to form.

We actually came here with friends the day after we got married and did our rehearsal dinner here as well in 2011.  Most people come for the dim sum, but their Chinese banquet style food was really top notch.  I was very caught off guard how good it was.  Very similar to what you'd get in Southern California.Parking is always the issue, so I recommend taking the T or biking here.  The parking lot next door is the narrowest, creepiest parking lot ever.  You are going to waste your time getting trapped here.  They don't even watch over the keys for you very carefully.Back to the Dim Sum, order the shark fin dumpling, actually any of the dumplings are awesome here, the Chinese broccoli or Beijing Kale, turnip cake, Beef Tripe (Ngau Pak Yip), Bean Curd Roll in Oyster Sauce (Ho Yao Seen Juk Guen).  Here is a dim sum menu decoder for some of the more popular dishes that you'll see rolling around Hei La Moon: http://yumchajunkies.wordpress.com/dim-sum-menu-decoder/The food is pretty comparable to China Pearl, but I like how there windows and the place is better lit than China Pearl.

Cost us $32.84 for lunch.. NO DRINKS! My son will only eat peperoni pizza and I prefer somethign with veggies on it. So I was forced to order two 11 inch pies and oddly my 4yr olds cost MORE than mine did?! Really? You also can't customize, I would have loved to do a half and half but was told there was no way. I didn't find anyone particularly friendly infact the man who helped us was pretty unfriendly. My son and I both enjoyed our pizzas. The ingredients were stellar. They clearly do not skimp on quality, that's for sure. But I found the pie very chewy and had no crispy crust. By the time I got to my second slice my pizza was soggy and limp. Because each of the ingredients were so good it made it easy to overlook the limp soggyness but not the cost. I will say for the amount we spent there was A LOT of food. We ended up taking an entire 11\\" pizza home with us since we both ate half (yes my 4yr olds a beast) so really for the amount of food you get it's not expensive but being forced to order so much isn't cost effective either. So I'm not sure if this is a good review or a bad review? Either way the pizza was good.

And Pete who i assume has stake in the place is the best!!!  This bad review is purely because of the menu change.  Originally i could order great and delicious plates in the $14-20 range, and the dishes were worth the money (filling and delicious).  We were told some new food items were being added this spring, sounded great to us!  Unfortunately to our surprise, they dumped the whole original menu(burritos and enchiladas) and went 100% tapas(they are so small).  The new menu recommends 3 items should be the appropriate amount to adequately fill someone up.  The rub, each item is $15-18!  So before you add a beer or $10 margarita you are already pushing $50 bucks per head - yikes!I see this good intended approach hurt business all the time.  They change the model and completely end their original product offering (and all their customers without knowing it). Their new model is 100% different, they could change the name of the place its that different.My advice, bring back the old menu and price structure.  In addition, have tapas offerings and test the market.  Conduct customer assessment and look at the numbers.  Tapas offerings at that price can be great revenue generators for appetizers.   Nevertheless i wrote this long post in hopes Pete and their staff will consider how dramatic this change was to their happy customers.  Not to mention they are missing the mark on price tiering.  I will change this to 5 stars if they consider welcoming back their old and happy customers back to the table.   $65 to have a drink and fill up before tip seems like a big ask.  Those numbers are fine dining.  Thanks for your ear.Pete, please consider this advice.

The burger was tiiiiight, yo. Really, it is in my top 3 burgers around town. My wife's veggie burger was similarly top shelf. I really enjoyed the extra touch like the house-made pickle slices on the burger. They had a really nice flavor and texture. The new-fangled (I'm told) bun was fantastic. It was structurally sound down to the last bite. The burger almost rivals those I make at home. YEAH. They're THAT good. Really, the only beef I had was that my fries were pretty much all the nubbinses but it's a minor quibble. We went on a Wednesday and the cockshake of the day was White Russian, which is a favorite of mine. One long sip of it and I was \\"dasvidanya, comrade\\". Man, was it strong and tasty.  It was truly a POTENT POTABLE. It made a terrific dessert and for $5, can't be topped for value. It's worth coming in for, itself. I really dug the rock show flyers on the wall. Most of the bands on them are from the time I was in college and more into the music scene. I even went to some of the shows on display, albeit the Seattle dates. Even if no one else digs it, I do.

I work in Kendall Square, and many of my colleagues are all about Aceituna Cafe, and though it is decent, I just can't get behind it like they can.  The chicken shawarma sandwiches at Boston Shawarma are so good there are no words to describe them.  The chicken itself, which they slice off to order, is perfectly moist and all white meat.  The veggies are fresh, the tahini delicious, and if they happen to have the pickled turnips, you have to get them because they totally make it (none of this dill-pickles-in-the-shawarma business...I don't even know what that IS).  The hot sauce is also key.  They press the sandwiches before they serve them to you, so they're all warm and delicious, and super-messy because all the juices drip out which is really tragic because they're so flavorful you don't want to sacrifice them to your paper plate.  Okay, I really need to get off the sandwiches now because I'm getting a little worked up.  The honey cakes in their dessert case are are really fabulous, especially later in the day when the honey has really settled into them.As far as the atmosphere is concerned, I for one am in love with the crazy makeover.  The walls are now painted in some crazy pink and purple swirly pattern that I don't exactly understand but love anyway because as far as I am concerned, more places in the world should be decorated in such a festive manner.

Probably should have tried the drink first, as I have never complained about a drink being made before, but I literally could not taste any gin in them. Weakest drink I've ever had. Also - last call was at 12:30? Is this normal for them, even on a really slow night?Update: Have been twice since. Gin and tonics havent gotten any better. Second time was okay. Third time? Well, my friends all ordered shots, I didn't. He brought over an extra one - so we quickly told him that we only ordered four, not five. He said, \\"It's okay, don't worry about it\\", then left. Not only did he charge us for this one (which I feel like it was safe to assume was free), but charged us for an extra on top of that. When we asked him to remove them he only removed one. ???

As for the meats I had both the lean and fatty brisket as well as the sausage. Needless to say they were all sensational but my favorite was the lean brisket, with meat tender enough that it absolutely melts in your mouth while also maintaining just enough texture that your palate has something to play with.

We started to order a drink until we realized there were no prices on anything! We asked how much some of the drinks were and they were $40. $40!! We decided to pass on that since it was brunch. My favorite part of this was a bartender who was clearly trying to make being rude to customers part of his \\"act\\". I asked for water and he rolled his eyes and said \\"lame. Get something to drink.\\" Which would've been fine if he had actually gotten me the water I asked for...but he never did! We had to ask another bartender minutes later! A few people in my party actually got some of the smaller drinks (more like $15-$20) but none of them were super happy with them. Finally we were seated and I'll spare you the gory details, but that was the longest brunches of my life. 3.5 hours. They were agonizingly slow. Food showed up cold. Food was brought out at different times. Drinks were forgotten. Our favorite rude bartender actually thought he was being funny by slipping in beside someone to slide their drink on the table without the person knowing. Needless to say, one of our party had to fly home smelling like Bloody Mary mix. They actually forgot salmon on two people's salmon Benedict orders and clearly took it back in the kitchen, lifted up the eggs, and plopped cold salmon in between. The eggs were all over the place when it finally came out! I got an omelette--pretty hard to mess up right? Wrong! The omelette was completely burnt, the potatoes were not even done (some were completely raw), and they put a piece of bread on my plate. Literally bread. Not toasted, not buttered, nothing! We were honestly so hungry though that we ate whatever we could, paid, and left. Seriously, we did not expect this to be an all day event! The icing on the cake was the birthday celebration every five minutes. If you don't know, The Sugar Factory's thing is that they have very expensive and massive desserts for special occasions with sparklers. If you pay enough, they will also present this with the song of your choice, complete with a dance from the wait staff. The pictures of the celebrities who were paid to pretend to eat these desserts are plastered all over the place. I couldn't help but wonder throughout my 3.5 hour adventure here how much they paid Kim Kardashian to pretend to drink one of their $40 drinks. But I digress, while this was cute the first few times, the blasting of music every 5 minutes for this was enough to put one hangry bachelorette party over the edge.If you're a tween or have a tween that wants an Instagram shot with that famous dessert and sparklers, this place is for you.

It's one of our go-to places to take visiting friends and family and we've yet to have a disappointed guest.They convinced me that fried okra isn't supposed to be slimy and hush puppies aren't dried up balls of blah. The fried chicken, brisket, jambalaya, and fried pork chops are favorite entrees. I have an aversion to meat that is still on the bone so the fact that the fried chicken are breasts and not a combination of breast and leg is a huge plus for me.What I really love about this place are the side dishes. My father once dubbed me the \\"side dish queen\\" growing up because I would eat entire meals of just sides. There are quite a few spots in Portland that make killer brisket, fried chicken, etc. but fall short on the side dishes. This is not the case here. The mac n cheese is amazing. The seasonal veggies are always fantastic. And you can order the Screen Door Plate with just sides! Service has always been great and food comes out fast, even when it's packed. Prices are reasonable for the level of service and amount of food you get-- we almost always have left-overs.I have never driven by this place during operating hours without seeing a huge line outside. We try to get there right when they open or later in the evening on a weekday. The one time we were told there was a 1.5 hour wait, we took our guests across the street to the Matador for drinks as the bar/waiting area of the Screen Door is a bit cramped."},{"name":"Sugar Factory","address":"8371 International Dr, Ste 70","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"This place is crowded, & they had a 40 minute wait for a milk shake.

We inevitably joined it and had a delicious meal, but both ended up with stomachaches afterwards and haven't been back since. We decided to give it another go last night since we were up in the area anyway running errands. Since we got there relatively early (5:30ish), there was no line, and the woman at the register was extremely helpful and patient. We started with the salad and the sweet & sour yodas. The salad was good with a nice dressing, but nothing uber special. The yodas were like a flavor explosion in your mouth, and mouth-wateringly delicious, but they came out at a barely lukewarm temperature. Lame!For ramen, one of us got the Tonkotsu Original and the one got the Ol' Skool. We loved the broth on the former, but not the noodles, which were ultra thin without any flavor. The Ol' Skool had better noodles, but not as good of a broth. Both had a weird funky smell when they came out (but maybe that's normal??).We're giving Tatsu-Ya 4 stars since everything we ate was pretty good and we got good service.

Plenty of places to park your bum down to eat. The food is a selection of sandwiches, salads, and sides. I got the rebel Reuben which was perfection! It was super flavorful and not too mushy (one of my Reuben requirements). I got a side of chips and a drink and a slice of cake (red velvet in case you were wondering). The cake was too sweet (personal preference) but definitely moist and good (it was the frosting that put it over the sweetness cliff).I've got to remember to put this place back into my lunch rotation, it's awesome!

But now, I'm being extremely honest.I guess if you were raised in Maine and moved to Atlanta you would consider this \\"authentic\\" southern food.  I on the other hand owe it to the people to keep this review 100% real.The service was excellent.  Clearly, the staff and the mgmt were over the top professional.  So let me break down the food.As a child we ate potted meat (look that up), and deviled ham from CANS.  That is not worthy of a $42/person meal.  So don't try to serve me deviled ham on toasted WHITE bread as appetizer for a meal.  You can't even spring for a cracker??  Yes, waitress, I get how people LOVE your deviled ham but I didn't want that crap when I was a child.  And I CERTAINLY am not paying for it at $42/person as an adult.  I suggest you find some meat or veggies that aren't ground to an unrecognisable  existence to serve to me.  I was allowed to have the heirloom tomato salad.  Why would you take a something as beautiful as a tomato and mess with it like that?  Tomatoes can be eaten and enjoyed off the vine.  Now you SAY you marinated it in tomato juices, but my taste buds disagree.  Tomatoes are FRUIT.  Fruit is generally NOT SOUR.  I'm not sure WHAT you had on that tomato but it was bitter.  And unappetizing.So then the waitress starts to advise us that we probably don't want to pay for dinner.  OK, I'll admit my friend was a bit over the top by asking them to fry her catfish instead of serve it grilled in tomato gravy.  After tasting the heirloom tomato salad, I don't blame her.  And I wasn't having the quail.  My Daddy was a hunter and he would shoot quail and that has a TON of little bones to work around and I want chicken.  We ate quail when you didn't have money and someone had to go hunt food.  At $42/person, I expect chicken or steak.  And I am NOT a fan of kale salad.  I'm sorry.  I know everyone loves it, but eating raw kale is like eating raw collard greens.  I don't eat salad dressing to begin with so \\"massaging\\" my kale is just not something I'm entertaining.  And mac n cheese is NOT included at $42/person.Clearly, we won't enjoy our dinner, so maybe we should just go.  I booked this (reservations) as a dual birthday dinner celebration.  I was very disappointed.  In fact, the manager herself told us, no charge, just go.  I appreciate your hospitality and your politeness.  I'll reciprocate by not returning.P.S.

My experience was good, but slightly less than ideal.First, when we arrived, there was a 45 minute wait time, which I was fine with, but the host offered an option:  the \\"heated patio\\", where we could sit immediately.  Seeing as how it was cold and rainy, I didn't mind waiting, but my party wanted to take the heated patio option for quicker service.  They do indeed have the overhead heaters at each table on the patio, but I wasn't about to take my jacket off.  After about 10 minutes, I realized why it was so cold on a patio that was purported to be heated... there was a 3 inch gap between the plastic and the wall just behind the door to the patio, which was causing icy gusts of wind to blow over us for the duration of the meal.  We were so cold by the end, that my wife and I immediately got into our bed under the covers to warm up once we were home.  Disregarding that small inconvenience, what you've heard is true!  The food here is exquisite!  We each ordered a variety of different things, and were sharing bites to get a taste for everything.  I ordered the griddlestack burger, which was 2, 5 oz patties of natural angus beef with bacon added... it was messy, but damn, was it a fine burger!  We ordered some hush puppies and fried okra as appetizers, and both of them were top notch!  I especially liked the sauce that is served with the okra.  Oh, and the mac & cheese here is frickin' AMAZING.

The chalkboard sign on their sidewalk advertising $5 appetizers drew us in to glance at the menu.  As soon as I saw the words \\"grilled artichokes\\" I was game.  We sat at the bar and drank delicious cocktails that were a little pricey, but when it's all top shelf, that's to be expected.  I was a little disheartened to hear they don't have any beer on draft, only a few skunky domestics.  But I had my Stoli, so my dreams of a New England-produced IPA could be prolonged.  We were happy to hear that it wasn't just the \\"antipasti\\" section that was $5, it was the whole page.  My friend and I quickly agreed on four appetizers: a sausage/ricotta/roasted red pepper pizza, my beloved grilled artichokes with lemon and herbs, breaded risotto with house-made mozzarella inside, and a delicious prosciutto plate with more rich mozzarella accompanied by familiar friends, tasty bruschetta, tomatoes, and balsamic glaze. As we were waiting, we were offered a white bean/olive oil sauce with some tasty bread.  The food was amazing.  We gobbled it down while still trying to look graceful.  I finished my meal with the molten chocolate cake with raspberry glaze and cherry gelato.  I resisted the urge to lick my plate.  It was quite a battle.After talking to the friendly waitress, we learned they had recently opened, only a couple weeks prior.  I realize I probably can't financially support gorging at this restaurant on a regular basis once this promotion ends, but I definitely recommend trying it out.  $5 has never made me feel classier."},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Long wait but worth it.

There are bad things about this place - mainly that most of the waitresses don't speak English (but you can point to your food!), the food tends to be greasy, and I always feel like they stick us white kids at terrible tables and often together in the same section. (And they always try to pass off certain foods to our tables that they don't in the rest of the place, although I didn't want chicken feet anyway so I don't really mind. I just make them show me everything and take what I want.) Overall though there are a lot of choices and the carts have pretty high turn around so the food usually tastes pretty fresh. We usually stuff ourselves and get away with $12/person bill. That's tough to beat, especially since my boyfriend had a huge pit for a stomach. My favorite is the fried shrimp w/ taro, although I kind of prefer the ones that are more gooey inside. (They have those too, but just taro no shrimp.)I went here once with a guy who didn't eat shrimp or pork and another guy who didn't eat beef. That was a bad idea.

I had a question, and it was answered with a seriously good reply.  This was followed by seriously good bbq.  After a pound of smoked turkey, a pound of ribs, a pound of brisket, sausage links, potato salad, and coleslaw (washed down with a Big Red), I was VERY HAPPY.

The brisket is sublime and the unanimously friendly staff clearly cares deeply about both the quality of their product and the quality of each guest's experience. And it's a relative value given both the deliciousness and the demand. But...waiting in line for 4+ hours (or, in my case today, 2 hours in 100 degree heat  towards the end of their service) is an inherently unappetizing experience (unless standing in place with a line full of tourists is your idea of a fun half-day). If Franklin had  invented Texas BBQ or was the only game in town doing it superbly, I'd say just do it, but frankly (pardon the wordplay), I'd choose JMueller, Micklethwait, La Barbecue (which has it's own mini-major line now), The Granary in San Antonio, or any of the old school places in Lockhart, Luling, or Taylor before I'd ever subject myself to the unpleasant reality of that line again.  However, if your goal is to be able to tell your friends back home in Houston or Kansas or Seattle or wherever that you went to Austin and ate at the place with the epic line (and post a photo of said line on your Facebook page to prove that you're super-duper hardcore!), then this is indeed the place for you.I loved the food and the people who served it, but unfortunately it's simply not worth the wait..."},{"name":"Apres Diem","address":"931 Monroe Dr NE, Ste C103","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The place gets way too loud and trendy at night, but I love coming here for brunch or lunch.

Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I've eaten here for lunch several times with my co-workers, because it's convenient, yet sort of away from the office, and the food is decent. However, the wait is a bit terrible. For every time we've been able to sit and eat, another time, someone has had to take their food to go. I don't know if that's related to how popular, and thus busy they are, or if they're understaffed. But, it's something to note. I ate there for Dia de los Muertos last night with the sig, and thanks to the Yelp Event section of the site, and the experience bumped No Mas up from a 3 star to a 4 star in my book. The food was good, as usual, with appetizers served in buffet style. I think I'm secretly falling in love with their cheese sauce, because I have to get it every time I go. But there were several things beyond the food that I enjoyed.First of all, the live band was really great and reminiscent of traditional Mexican music. The lead singer was also HILARIOUS. During the awesome costume contest (for which the sig was a finalist - yay!), he would improv a song for each person, with a little story about how they came to be. There were some pretty decent prizes and give-aways, as well. And I was a fan of the photo booth. There should be more of those in establishments I frequent. So, if you go, don't be surprised if you're waiting a while for your food, even if you get seated promptly. It's a large space, so that's not an indicator of busy-ness. The food will likely be enjoyable, but the servers will be stressed out. Avoid prime hours. However, if you can go for some sort of event or celebration, it's completely worth it.Side note, while there is a relatively large parking lot with additional space in the back, that area's a bit scary at night, and it's really compact.

The taste of their crust is average on most pizza's - not so great on the peperroni.  The sauce on most of their pizzas lack seasoning - the exception being their squash pizzas.   I thought that the Omnivore Bliss was a little light on the toppings for how expensive it was.  The bacon, spuds and cheddar pizza is good but ultimately too rich for my tastes.  Their Sicilian pizzas are all crust and they don't have enough sauce.  Their ham and pear pizza is actually pretty delicious though.I appreciate what they are trying to do with the fresh toppings, local ingredients and everything, but if I want a veggie pizza, I find that even Bellagios does a better job.The cost of their made-to-order pizzas is prohibitive ($21.25 for a 13\\" combo) so the best option is to order by the slice if you come here.  Most of their slices are around $3.50, and one is probably enough to fill you up if you are  a light eater.  I hate saying this though, because re-heated pizza isn't the best way to enjoy pizza.This place does have a nice outdoor seating area and fills up on the sunny days.Depending on which hipster you get, the service ranges from charming to snotty and indifferent.  At least they have good beers on tap and even a decent little wine selection!

My sister and I were craving seafood when we visited boston. We decided to go for a more cheaper alternative rather than going to an actual super expensive seafood restaurant. Our hostess (we stayed at her house for a couple of nights) recommended this place to us so we decided to go. The restaurant was really big and was pretty empty considering it was 9 PM on a friday, but there was a couple of parties there eating dimsum. But my sister and i were kind of glad because we were a bit worried about not being seated since theres a chance that this restaurant would be packed.Anyway, my sister and i ordered scallops in sizzling platter with black pepper, and lobster with garlic and scallions. It was my first time trying scallops so i was really hyped and it was so good with the sauce and the peppers. The lobster was the dish that my sister and i have definitely been waiting to try. Now, my sister and i are not a big fan of lobsters. We had tried them back in NY but there werent that fresh and it was not good. But the lobster dish has been chopped and sauteed with ginger and scallion flavors. Although the flavors only reached the surface of the lobster and not the lobster meat inside it, my sister and i could definitely taste the freshness of the lobster. We literally devoured the whole thing because it was so delicious.Lastly, just as a small craving of dimsum, i asked to order for shrimp wrapped in rice noodle. but they ran out :( so i decided for the shu mai instead and BOY THEY WERE BIG.

The other being Havana Sandwich Shop on lower Buford Highway.It's true that this is really only a take-out sandwich shop.  The only seating is a single picnic table outside.  Also there is no official parking except for a couple of spots and whatever street parking you can find.When you walk in, you'll see the no frills atmosphere, but do not be discouraged.  The Cubans here are the best around.  The classic Cuban has ham and pork pressed between Cuban bread with swiss and all the fixings.  They'll ask if you like freshly chopped jalapenos added on.  Just say yes if you like a little kick, they're really not that hot.  Lately I've been passing on the classic and getting the salami.  It's a little greasy, but the swiss pairs wonderfully with the salt cured salami goodness.  Pick up a 20-ounce Coke and you've got a wonderful lunch for about $5.  If you choose a sandwich other than the classic, it's best that you flag down someone when you enter as they'll have to specially make it up.  They'll already have classics made up for miles.  Don't be surprised around noon for the line to be out the door, but it tends to move quickly.The hours are from just before noon to late afternoon.

The fried chicken is also really, really good, especially since it seems that the chicken gets a spice rub first before it's battered and fried. As for the wings, I'd prefer to go to nearby Wing-It, but they were definitely good. The only thing I want more out of this place is for it to be open later. 11:00 seems like an early closing time for a place with a bar. Then again, the place is nearly empty at that hour.Be warned that your food may take a while to be prepared.

That was indeed false, the pita wrap here is much thinner, but still held it's own. After a few minutes of reviewing the menu I went with the safe bet (Typical, right? Whatever) with the Lamb Shawarma - lean meat slowly roasted and thinly sliced w/ seasoning. The wrap was pretty good, but a little over salted.

This isn't the ritz Carlton where all things are delicate and over priced. A slightly larger piece of pie and a slightly larger scoop of ice cream would still allow the restaurant to make a killing in profit by charging $8.50, but the patron would at least sense more perceived value.

There's a bar area which is usually empty, but populated by loud parties at happy hour. They show sports on TV, and its a nice place to have a quite drink and a chat before it gets busy. The rear is a dining area which is usually not very busy, especially at lunch. So you have a lot of choices of the type of vibe you want. \\nThe house special drinks tend to be excessively sweet and light on the alcohol, and priced pretty high. Food is unexceptional but serviceable, with small portions and upscale presentation style. IMHO, it's too expensive for what you get, but sometimes I just want to sit down in a not too noisy place and have a bite and a drink, ya know?\\nI usually get a cesar salad and three-cheese/spinach pizza or one of the ahi appetizers during the day.

She was fairly close to the front and the line was around the corner. \\nThey do have chairs and umbrellas available for the wait which makes the wait better so you aren't standing dying in the heat. They also will walk around selling you beer or water and they also have water jugs around for you to have water while you wait.\\nFood: The brisket was amazing! It was the perfect smooth of seasoning. I also tried the pork which was good but the brisket was my favorite. I'm not a fan of ribs but my friends had it and thought it was really good as well.

I think I-Drive is fun for tourists and locals alike, but with that in mind be prepared to pay elevated tourist prices. Parking for Sugar Factory is convenient at the free parking garage that is on the side of all the restaurants and I-360 Ferris Wheel. So Sugar Factory is composed of two parts. They have the retail section with candy, lots of sweets, ice cream (home of the infamous King Kong sundae) and the other section is the restaurant and bar. Just beware the actual restaurant is not open for lunch, or brunch on the weekdays, only on Saturday and Sunday. The retail store is open everyday at 11 a.m. We went right at five on a weekday and there was literally no wait, but the closer you get to 8 p.m. expect a wait. If you plan to go around those times it's safe to make a reservation, especially if you want to be at a table and not plopped on the bar. The lunch I had there was really average, just what you'd expect at a regular deli. It was good, just nothing special. The menu is mostly composed of deli items, American-style sandwiches and such. \\nWhy people really come here, are for the deserts and the drinks. Now THOSE are special, they don't disappoint. I brought my friend here when she was visiting me in Orlando, and she said this was one of her highlights of her trip! The goblets are awesome, they are everything you expect them to be and they literally look like the pictures that are on the menu. That being said they are over-priced. The goblets (which are huge, I usually share them with someone) are $30 (non-alcoholoic) and $35 (if you want with alcohol). They have really cute themes surrounding the goblets and all their other drinks. Their trademark drink is the \\"Lollipop Passion, fi this is your first time coming, I would definitely recommend getting this one! You have to! It's their trademark and if you love candy this goblet is adorned with yummy candy you can indulge in after your drink is done. The other goblet I've had is \\"Ocean Blue\\" it was really cool with the gummy sharks, but the dry ice they put was so minimal it didn't live up to the hype as much as the \\"Lollipop Passion\\". And not to mention, they have a whole section for chocolate martinis, chocolate lover or not (I don't like chocolate) they. look. and. are. amazing. \\nOh, and there's been some confusion in the past, but sadly no, you do not get to keep the goblet as memorabilia. It would be really cute, and I think they should offer that option, maybe it has changed, but since my last visit they do not. Our service here has always been pretty good and the servers really did do their best to make sure we were taken care of and happy. Our first visit my friend didn't like her meal, and frankly couldn't eat it because of some of the ingredients and she kindly told our server and the server went to talk to her manager and next thing you know we had a new sandwich. \\nThe other time I went with a friend our server took the time to tell us about her favorite drinks on the menu and we only ordered a goblet no food. At some places some servers seem to put on this annoys face of \\"What? You are only ordering an appetizer or a drink?\\" And here they didn't (not like any server should in the first place, but it was nice.) Another side note, I'd like to thank Sugar Factory for raising money for the Pulse victims by selling Pulse cookies it was great to see this chain support our Orlando community. \\nThis place is definitely worth a visit, it's an attraction all on it's own and once you see the drinks and deserts yourself, you're going to want everyone to come here."},{"name":"The Mighty Cone","address":"1720 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"So, I was visiting Austin and Googled the Mighty Cone because I had seen it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, cooked the recipe at home after watching the show and it was so good, I wanted to taste the real deal! I ordered the Hot and Crunchy Chicken Cone and fries, it was absolutely nothing like what had been featured, as a matter of fact my husband said the version I made at home was way better. They opened late, we were waiting about 20 minutes. The guy that took our order looked and acted as if he just went ahead and slept at the club and was very matter of fact and kind of rude. There was no jalapeno mango coleslaw, it was just regular ol' coleslaw, there was no spice, like none. The fries were good but they were nothing special and again no spice. We ordered a burger just to taste and it was very dry and the bread was hard. I gave 2 stars because the chicken, which I just went ahead and pulled out of the cone was delicious! And, I bet it was or hope it was the hangover giving the sorry service not what they do on a daily basis. Surely not, right?

When I'm hankering for a Vietnamese sandwich, I don't want to have to deal with the guess work of which place should I eat. I've eaten at both now and I feel I can write a semi-decent review.Cons: Some of the meat I was given was hard to chew, like tendons or something. My jaw kind of worked hard to get through some of that meat and I have TMJ, so that's no good. Pros: I liked how the jalapenos were cut so I didn't get a massive dosage at once. I like the bread here because it's softer than the Baguette House. The roof of my mouth is very sensitive at times so harder bread can really irritate that. Bread boosted this rating.  The price is about the same as Baguette house give or take a quarter. One thing that I liked when coming in was seeing the array of food they had.

Sadly, they only offered one breakfast option, \\"The Standard Breakfast\\" Bacon, Sausage, potatoes, eggs and toast. It was adequate, though it took a ridiculous amount of time for our order to arrive (easily 25 minutes, and we were the only ones in the place!). The bacon was thick and quite tasty and the sausages were alright. The toast was very basic, wonderbread/safeway bakery style and could definitely be improved. The coffee was ok, and served with the little dairy creamers (I really prefer 1/2 &1/2  in a little pitcher that doesn't have that preserved/shelf stable flavour, but this place is obviously not a breakfast joint). I ordered the eggs scrambled and they were done in a standard diner style. Cheap eggs, no golden yolks or free range here...I wasn't expecting it, just reporting what I ordered.Fish and chips and the lamb burger were the other two items ordered. The fries were nice, and had season salt on them (I like this). The fish was to my liking, flaky fish with a crisp coating, but the oil tasted a bit...old? The tartar was basic, but again, I liked it, creamy with dill. The lamb burger appeared to be a pre made/frozen patty. I really want fresh meat burgers if I go out, especially if I am paying 13.00 for the entree. If I wanted a prefab burger, I'd have bought a box from Safeway. The bun was some sort of whole grain with sesame seeds on the top and bottom, toasted nicely. The burger also came with red onion strips and fresh pickled cucumber (YUMMO!). Nice touches, but if you use prefab meat...it just doesn't matter... The garden salad that came with the burger was fresh and crisp (greens, grated carrot, cherry tomato and cucumber) and the dressing was a lovely vinaigrette with parsley and mint. Tasty stuff!Service was kind and attentive. I realize we went in to a bar that specializes in live music for breakfast. I knew better than to expect much. It was ok for what it was, but I will not be back for breakfast, though we'll surely check out the nachos and live music some night.

You've got the Classy Lady, which consists of crushed up potato chips, gooey cheese sauce, and every fond memory you ever had of being dared in to adding unorthodox toppings like chip crumbs or Billy Johnson's boogers (anyone? anyone?) to your wiener. The Zippity Zam, which is my personal favorite, is topped with red peppers and a spicy cream cheese goop that's been kicked up a notch with a healthy dose of Sriracha. Lara's Pittsburgh Princess is a relative newbie to the menu and is the clear front-runner for being the best value on the menu, what with its fries, slaw, and signature hot dog all nestled in a toasty Chicago-style bun.  If none of these things sound enticing to you, never fear- there's over a dozen more combinations on the menu at your disposal, as well as the ability to finagle your own custom dog any which way you like.But wait, there's more! If you've ever wondered what a Slush Puppie would taste like with half a pint of vodka or rum in it, Frank's got ya covered. The cocktail menu offers all sorts of boozy slush concoctions that will make you wish you didn't come here on your lunch break without a desiganted driver. Try the hot lime if you're feeling sultry- lime slush, habanero lime Monin syrup, and a woozy dose of tequila to whet your whistle. If you're metal as f*ck like I am, a tribute to thrash metal O.G.'s Slayer is in order with the Reign In Blood (not making this up!)- vodka, sport peppers, spicy bloody mary mix, Old Bay, and a garnish of two olives and a cocktail wiener. This ain't your grandma's Bloody Mary, unless of course your grandma worships satan and plays a 7-string Warlock guitar. Other favorites include Ride the Lightning, an 80's Metallica homage that's 80% booze and should probably include a taxi ride home, and the aptly named Charlie Hustle, a slurry of red slush, vodka, and some sort of energy drink that probably isn't Red Bull. If you're counting calories, the old hipster standby PBR is also on tap, and the folks behind the bar are kind enough to sell it to you for just a dollar if you can prove that you rode your bike there. That's one hell of a way to curb drinking and driving if you ask me!Other perks: most of their sides are modestly priced at two bucks, and more than half of them are delicious. Not a huge fan of the tots, but the onion rings are certainly a cut above the rest and an absolute steal at only two buckaroos. The mac & cheese is somewhat standard, but always creamy and never disappointing. The big sloppy plates are a welcome addition to cater to larger appetites, although I doubt the Cincinnati 5-way will ever be able to reach the gold standard that Skyline Chili's had  firm lock on since the dawn of time. If you're still sitting there with a smug look on your face wondering when I'm going to stop trying to sell you on a place that specializes in low-brow peasant food, I've got one more thing to sell you on here: the kitsch factor. You'll be hard-pressed to find a greater collection of such ludicrous installments of \\"art\\" that pay tribute to some of the most random characters that we all remember from our yesteryear. The south wall of the dining room is covered in custom-drawn paintings of everything from hair metal bands to Michael Jackson to Hall & Oates, and I have absolutely no reason why. And this is why I love it. Think Beavis and Butthead meets Heavy Metal Parking lot and you're almost there. If hesher rock ain't your thing, direct your attention to the MLB-themed mural on the eastern wall above the kitchen window. You'll then find a picture of some of the greatest MLB players ever to grace the diamond before The Strike of 1994- Andre Dawson, Roberto Alomar, Fred McGriff, and the mustachioed wunderkind himself, Rollie Fingers. And a hunder more that even I can't name without pulling out an iPhone. Nevermind the tiny dining room; Dirty Franks truly is heaven on earth."},{"name":"Milestone 229","address":"229 Civic Center Dr","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Beautiful patio.

The temple of barbecue deliciousness.  Wow.The brisket ($17/lb) comes out beautiful with a peppery black bark and a 1/4\\" thick bright red smoke ring.  The brisket is not as aggressively peppered as some other well-regarded places but here it is balanced just right.  The meat is so soft and buttery and moist on the inside that the salty and spicy bark is the perfect contrast.  I devoured my plate.  Holy $#*@! - it was unbelievably amazing.  If this BBQ were a 1980's pro-wrestler, I would say it's the best there is, the best there was, the best there ever will be.Even if they only have the chopped beef sandwiches left, those looked pretty damn delicious.  From what I can tell, it was chopped brisket and pickled red onion on a homemade bun.  Looked delicious and it was only $7.They serve two sauces - an espresso and a red vinegar sauce.  I wasn't into the espresso, but the vinegar was awesome.  It's pungent and bright and adds punch to the meat.  Really really good.  It felt like complete sacrilege to use sauce on Franklin brisket, so I dipped sparingly.  The sides are meh, but who cares?Not only is the meat mind-blowing, but the entire experience, other than possibly the line, is very pleasant.  Aaron Franklin himself is often cutting the meat and interacting with customers.  He is also about the nicest and friendliest guy I've ever met.  Every employee seems to follow his lead in being extremely outgoing and friendly and seemingly genuine.  The employees must be dead tired from the constant bum-rush of patrons, but they never fail to be awesome.  I generally don't care about service, but even I am impressed.  I'd like to work here just so I can hang out with all the employees and have like 20 new best friends.And yes, there's a very long line.  However you, because you read Yelp, don't have to wait in it.  I will tell you how:  1. Show up at 12:30pm on any day but Saturday (when the lines are too long)\\n2. Get in line - you should see someone holding the \\"Last Man/Woman Standing\\" sign in front of you.  This is the last person who is guaranteed food.\\n3. Wait behind the Last Man Standing no further than about 15-20 people back.  Don't despair if you're too far back - an employee will come out and tell people they aren't guaranteed food, so they will leave.  Since you're smarter than that, you will move up.\\n4. You will get brisket, and it will only take you about 45 minutes to reach the front.  They always underestimate what they have left, so the Last Man may be \\"guaranteed\\" food, but you can be pretty damn sure you're going to get food if you're standing near him/her.  Never wait 3 hours again!\\n5. Lastly, send me a message and praise my genius.

In fact I changed my option after I'd already ordered like the indecisive person that I am and the register worker was super cool about it and didn't seem annoyed at my changes.  The food came out wicked fast and everyone's looked AND tasted amazing.  Great service.  Great food.

Needless to say, many had told me their love for Masa, so my expectations were raised to begin with. I was attracted to the Brunch special, and had the plantain empanada to start, followed by the scrambled eggs with mexican cheese and chorizo. Before our meals even arrived, however, I was surprised by a basket of cornbread. Needless to say, I understand this has a mexican-southwest flavor to it all, so I thought it was appropriate. The cornbread and 3 spreads were delicious. I don't usually expect the bread which starts the meal to be anything that appealing.Next -- the plantain empanada. I have eaten both plantains and empanadas, but the idea of both combined into a delectable sweet, oily and starch filled treat were too much to resist. It arrived as a single empanada on a plate, and my expectations were more than satisfied. Not too sweet, but with deep fried flavor that I crave.The main meal, the scrambled eggs with cheese and chorizo was actually a bit disappointing, which is the reason this received 3 stars instead of 4. I was hoping for a bit more, to be honest -- these scrambled eggs were certainly no better, and maybe even less satisfying than those I would eat for breakfast at the local diner. To boot, we had the misfortune of attending this restaurant during what appeared to be a bridal shower in the main dining area, and undoubtedly the experience would have been a bit better had we not dined at the bar."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Ever been to a restaurant that had so much food shit but you don't have to money or stomach to by everything you craved on the menu, well this place is one of these restaurants, I saw so much stuff that sounded good but I decided to resolve with the infamous burger doughnut, ... it was actually good and I ate it all in one sitting, but I'll prolly never buy it again, I love myself to much to do that again... but once again, I caught a great vibe from this place, everyone was secluded and relaxed, the waiters and waitresses were friendly, and it's located in the middle of midtown, so if you're on a date, I advise you to dig a little deeper in your pockets and walk your obese ass to Insomnia cookies and impress your obese date, with a Cookie sandwich there, because the desserts at Pints looked good, but crazy high, especially after you paid $12+ there, but highly recommend you come here and eat"},{"name":"Firehouse Subs","address":"9120 SW Hall Blvd, Ste C","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I gotta say, I was pretty impressed overall.

The wait was approximately 20-30 minutes in which time we enjoyed a LARGE margarita which was $6.50 and pretty damn good!  The place was packed and had a great atmosphere and the music in the background playing was great.  By 10:30/11 it slowed down but people were still coming in the door.  The food was great and reasonably priced.  We both ordered the burros, one without the enchilada sauce and one with.  The sauce was spicy which I enjoy.

Tonight, it was cream cheese with red pepper, butter with molasses, and chipotle hummus.  All were delicious, especially the butter.We shared a romaine salad and a chimichanga with corn and yucca.  The salad was beautiful (it looked almost like snow on the lettuce), but could have used a bit more seasoning (for my taste).  The chimichanga was quite good, with an especially tasty (spicy) salsa.For our entrees, one of us had the chicken breast and the other a chili rubbed pork chop.  We were both quite happy.  I had the pork chop and loved the spicy crust.  It was a huge portion.  Along with it, were some garlic potatoes (so-so), baby corn, and onion rings.We ended with the banana bread pudding.The main things were exceptional.  The side dishes were fine.But the reason that I wanted to write this review was that, contrary to the experience of other diners, the service we received was exceptional, from the coat check on.  There were nice pauses in between courses.  Our server was attentive, without being a bother.  He had no attitude, about my friend wanting only tap water to drink (and I mean, nothing in additional to tap water).

Unfortunately, far too often the eggs are a mess. Overcooked  on the outside and slimy raw on the inside.  I was there again on Nov. 28, there were only 2 other people eating.  The eggs were not edible, and both eggs and potatoes were swimming in thick oil.  It was disgusting.  The potatoes were unbelievably greasy I got sick just looking at this $9 meal.  This is not the first time I had to send the food back. I do not trust the ever-changing bevy of young, usually male, untrained cooks to prepare food properly, hygenically or not to spit in it if it must be redone so I walked out after leaving money for the coffee I drank on the table.  The floor is usually filthy as it is more of a bar at night and wafts of cig smoke blow in from the human chimneys that sit on the patio and into the restaurant each time the door opens. In summer there is no getting away from the cig smoke inside either.  If you are a non-smoker you cannot sit out patio ever.  I will not give Heritage Grill another chance.  Have gotten ill before eating the breakie and will not bother trying again.  Dirty cooks, dirty kitchen, dirty food.

Shortly after my party of four was seated early one Sunday morning, we were served some warm, freshly baked corn bread. And honestly, I'm not much of a fan, but this kind of changed that. It came with an assortment of spreads - cranberry jam, apricot jam, and butter, all of which went deliciously well with it.First course. I got the Caramelized Plantain Empanada with Mexican cinnamon cream cheese... talk about a rich and filling way to start your day! I found it to be not overly sweet, which I appreciated, since I tend to prefer savory items for breakfast/brunch. Second course, I had to go with the Santa Fe Style Eggs Benedict. And now, I gotta tell ya, these weren't your ordinary, typical poached eggs on biscuits with some Hollandaise on top. These were Eggs Benny kicked up a notch or two or ten!!! The poached eggs came with avocado, Green Chile Hollandaise, and salsa. Take one bite of that and you'll never want regular old Eggs Benedict ever again!What an amazing deal. I can't say that enough.

Best Katsu I have had.Chicken Teriyaki: Good flavor, not a huge tan of teriyaki normally but I would eat Oishi Sushi's Teriyaki again. Good meat to sauce ratio, sauce not over powering. Chicken is soft and done but not dry. Didn't find any fat or any other non tasty bits, like you do sometimes it teriyaki.Over all I will go again. Price point is reasonable for the amount of food you get.

It made them taste different than normal sweet potato fries, and not different in a good way.I ordered a Southwest Chicken salad.  It was good, but a little on the small side.  I wish I'd got a burger, they looked really good.  (The veggie burger sounded amazing).  I got to try some of the fries that came with the burgers, and those potato wedges were awesome.

I ordered a Corndogski (a polish sausage wrapped with their signature cornbread) and I was in heaven. This corn dog was cooked perfectly, a heaping size, and I could probably just eat that breading alone. It was literally the perfect corn dog. I also had a few bites of the Fryinstein Monster (a mixture of a beef frank, spicy italian sausage, and a polish sausage) with their jalapeno cornbread and it was also amazing. This beast didn't need any condiments at all. The jalapeno cornbread packs a nice punch of flavor and spiciness.

Located right next to the new Walmart, this little banh mi restaurant's decor is very clean, nice, and definitely feels like a high tea place like another reviewer mentioned. The food is beautifully presented and it looks like they use quality ingredients.  However, a pet peeve my hubby has is that you have to order at the register first and they bring your food to your table. We checked out this little restaurant over the holidays and I had high expectations based on reviews.  We ordered the Banh Mi Jambon ($7) which has very thin slices of pork belly - it was sliced so thinly I could barely taste the meat over the bun and the filling of cilantro, cucumbers and pickled carrots. The beef pho ($11) faired better with good flavors and we were impressed by the bone marrow thrown in.  [They only have 1 pho on the menu though so not really a place to go for variety of pho.  On the day we went their daily special was a chicken pho so there, you get 2 options.] We ordered a side of Spring Rolls ($7) for the toddler but it was nothing special and pricey for what it was. Service was slow and I was almost done my Banh Mi before hubby's pho showed up.  Overall I'd give them another try as it was comfortable dining there and I do want to like their food more.

All other dishes we tried were good, but with some flaws.  The Hot&Sour Wonton soup contained wontons, bok choy, tiny pieces of raw garlic, and no other solid contents. The wontons were very good, however the raw garlic contributed an intensity to the broth that I found unpleasant.Beef Chow Foon #129 was flavorful and contained tender beef, however the noodles were mushy and did not hold together.  Overcooked, I think.  Jin Gu Fish Filets #65 was served in a large bowl with tasty broth, fish filets (perhaps founder) and lots of broccoli florets.  Although the broth was spicy and tasty it did not adhere well to the fish filets so they tasted a bit bland.  Also, the fish was slightly overcooked and mushy.  The broth and broccoli worked well together, as the florets were able to sponge up the broth and deliver a kick to the palette.I'll go back and give it another shot.  Perhaps the overly soft noodles and fish were an anomaly."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Walked over here on a quick lunch break from my conference.

Blech. I was grateful for his suggestion and the Texas toast nicely enhanced the delicious pulled pork. It was tender and delicious and if I was just rating the service and the pulled pork sammy, Stubbs would rate a solid 4 stars.Wish I could say the same for the sides I sampled at our table: the french fries were freshly prepared, but a bit soggy and the mac and cheese was bland.

The service is perfection and friendly as can be. I don't see what the hoopla is about with the line. It wasn't bad at all and it's worth the wait. People need to stop complaining that they won't expand. If they expand, a lot of the quality and boutique service and appeal could go out the window simply so impatient people can \\"have it now\\". Go to McDonalds if you fast food...or garbage essentially. These days people just don't have any damn patience for anything. It's sad. Quit whining. Bring a friend to chat with and discover that most good things are worth waiting for. Truly great products take time to make and are often sustained not only by the quality results you get when time is spent on something but also the care and service that accompanies great products. Doing that on a mass scale just doesn't work with some things and food is one of them in my opinion.We had the pork ribs. They are fall-off the bone amazing and delicious. My pal had the tipsy texan which didn't sound good to me but I was blown away when I sampled his treasure.  We also tried the brisket sandwich which was superb.

I'll also admit I had read the reviews in advance so had fair warning of some of their better dishes to order and portion size. \\nThe space has been nicely renovated and feels very warm and casual. We ordered a great bottle of Joie, and I don't remember too much on the wine list but thought it was well priced and lots of local options. The beer taps look great to try next time. We ordered 6 dishes for 3 of us, and it was too much food, I think the right 5 dishes would have been plenty. \\nTo start - the rabbit rillette - a definite hit at our table, great fresh bread and the melt in your mouth rabbit was heavenly (think truffle, butter and foie gras!). The bison carpaccio came next and was fresh and well seasoned, I don't like olives and they paired them nicely. \\nThen the warm kale salad - a hit as I think most other reviewers have shared. I love brussel sprouts and kale so not hard for me to love, but my husband hates brussel sprouts and was fighting me for the last ones. PS. don't expect it to be healthy even if it says kale, in fact, don't expect anything there to be very healthy, but heavenly, yes.\\nWe also had the poutine and mussels. I'm not a poutine fan, but the house-smoked brisket was the star, the cheese was gooey and fresh and the fries crisp. The mussels were good, Chambar does them best, I had mussels at Chewies a day or two earlier and they beat them so somewhere in the middle. I like the cornbread biscotti that came with it, the others didn't. \\nOh and octopus - nice, not too memorable but seemed to remember liking it.\\nDidn't make it to desert with this menu - I have my eye on the cheesecake for next time.

Or a brat, which is now my go-to wiener. They also always have a soup of the day, 99% of the time it's vegan. Dirty Frank's knows what's up.I find myself craving Dirty Franks all the time, and with the insanely fair prices, those cravings are something I can afford quite often. I can escape from there with a full belly and $5 less in my bank account every time. BUT, I encourage everyone to spend a little more and indulge in their creative, fun cocktails often made with their infused vodka they make in house. I tried the peanut butter and jelly cocktail - peanut infused vodka and grape soda, and it was...well you've gotta try it for yourself.I love the atmosphere, I love the staff, and I love the food. Dirty Franks is a solid choice every time (as long as you have a group of 5 or less. You may be waiting for a table for a really long time if you go at a peak time, even with 3.) But grab a friend so you can skip the line and sit at the bar and you are good to go. Another cool thing - they only play local music.

I think it's close. ( do you want to know the others? Well, patience grasshoppers, and I will tell you at the end). . This time we took BIL and the kid. Kid was not pleased to hear we had been before, without her, until we explained we had not known how kid friendly it would be. There were a number of families with kids there on a Sunday afternoon. I think it's fine for kids. They even have a mini beef burger for $4. We all had Turkey Bacon Burgers.( even kid, who is finished with her vegetarian thing, for now at least). We shared two orders of french fries. Fries do NOT come with it, this is not how I remembered it last time ( I think they used to come with?), but that's ok. We also ordered me the special cock shake ( chocolate fireball, with whiskey, cinnamon schnapps, and ice cream and chocolate, hello, yum), husband a virgin coffee shake ( his turn to drive, poor thing), green tea ( BIl didn't feel so well today, sad), and a root beer float for the princess. It was proclaimed the BEST root beer float ever. It was pretty darn impressively good. It came as a tall glass full of vanilla ice cream,with a long spoon and a straw,  and a bottle of  icy cold root beer next to it. She was in root beer heaven. She couldn't finish it in the restaurant, they gave us a cup to take it home. She nursed it all day.Our burgers and fries were very good. We all liked them.I think it's more of a bacon burger with turkey,( the bacon is chopped up INSIDE the burger, think meatloaf) it's smokey and salty goodness. I like their sauce that comes in a little cup next to it, I think it has horseradish in it, yum!  Hubby had some minor gripes about various things (ketchup bottle was sticky,fries had a couple bad spots,the bun was too big, blah blah), but really? Foster Burger makes it hard to complain about anything. Especially with an alcoholic milkshake beverage in hand. Oh, princess had the house pickled beets too ( two slices for 50 cents) and loved them. Practically licked the plate they arrived on.We will be back. Princess wants to know when she can have another rootbeer float, for one thing... I'm drying to go sneak a lamb burger ( no, I'm not supposed to eat lamb OR beef,because of testing, blah blah,  but it looked really delicious when it was on the way to the table next to ours). Anyway, do you wanna know our favorite bacon? probably either my own carbonara (sorry Yelpers) or the bacon brownie sundae at Fishwife... or the maple bacon bar at Voodoo Donuts. Or the candied bacon at Hall Street Grill.

With that said, I felt that it was necessary to turn to Yelp to write a review of Serafina.  I was extremely excited to see that a new spot was opening up where Radius used to be.  I enjoyed how close Radius was to my work, and was glad to see another option was now available for lunch, dinner or drinks in the Financial District.  I started telling everyone in the area that it had opened, and had even suggested it to several people in my office.  I am now regretting having suggested it after dining there for lunch today.  The d√©cor of the place is stunning.  I love what they've done with it - it's brighter and more vibrant than Radius was.  The one thing that I will suggest they add to the room is some kind of fabric, rug, or curtain of some kind to absorb some of the sound.  The place is outrageously loud during the busy hours.  Everything echoes.  The menu seemed great, although I think they would benefit from having a lunch AND a dinner menu.  I asked the waitress if they planned on having a separate menu and she told me no.  The prices for lunch are just way too high.  The pizza section is a little strange to me, I felt like every single pizza was the same.  Now for the part that made me never want to dine back at this restaurant ever again.  THE FOOD.  The food took FOREVER to cook, and to top it off, it was TERRIBLE.  We had 3 people in our party, and had 12 pm reservations.  When we arrived, we were the only ones in the downstairs room.  By the time our food was handed to us, 45 minutes after we ordered, the room was packed and almost everyone was eating or finished with their meals.  One of the people in our party had ordered a salad - no chicken, no steak - just a plain old Caesar salad.  THAT should NOT take 45 minutes.  She did not even get to enjoy her meal, or even see her meal, because she needed to return to work.  Another person in my party ordered a 4 cheese pizza.  She only ordered that pizza after asking the waitress for her suggestions on the best option for a \\"cheese pizza\\" (the way you would order it at your local pizza shop, cheese and sauce and pizza crust)...and she suggested the 4 cheese pizza.  Well, she definitely got cheese on her pizza.  She was handed what I would consider cheesy bread.  There was no sauce, not even on the side,  My order, the Steak Frites - Hanger Steak, was overcooked and under-seasoned (I asked for medium - it was well in the center and crispy on the outside) and it looked like a log of steak.  It wasn't cut at all, it came with a steak knife, which was nice of them.  The frites were drowning in oil.  It was like they poured frialator grease on top of the fries.  The sauce that comes on the side for the steak was tasteless and bland.  Then, it said it came with veggies.  Well, there were 4 thin slices of veggies.  Two thin slices of zucchini and two thin slices of roasted red peppers.  With no seasoning...at all.  I hated everything about my meal and am sorry that I even tried it.  I wasted a good 25 bucks on my meal and a drink (3.50 for a lemonade!?), and because I know the food wasn't the waitresses fault, I was out the additional 6 bucks that I tipped her.  So basically, if you want to feel robbed of your money and time, go to Serafina for lunch.  Lunch should never cost that much, unless you're ordering several drinks with your lunch.  Which isn't a bad idea - you may actually need to be drunk to eat here and get any enjoyment out of it."},{"name":"The Pie College Park","address":"2429 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Really delicious pizza with the ingredients very fresh.

We purchased a Groupon Deal and thought we had a very special occasion to celebrate together.  Because I have known about this place since '98 I have only been dreaming about returning. In the last six months we have now gone twice. Because we go early on a Sunday (around 4pm) it is fairly empty. Not to sure what that indicates but knowing what I once tasted and experienced I was happier to not have to wait for a table.  The decor is a bit outdated but I don't need elite lighting structures or lots of flat screen TVs to make my meal complete - there is one flat screen in the bar area. Of course the white bean paste and bread served prior to dinner is to-die-for. It has been a staple of theirs since I can remember.  In fact the main reason I have been dying to return. We began our dinner with a few appetizers. The calamaritti fritti was delicious. My boyfriend is selective when it comes to calamari - so this was a nice surprise when all that came out were the little round disc pieces and no crazy tentacles. It was presented on a simple plate with a tasty dipping sauce. We also got the buffalo mozzarella, tomato and prosciutto appetizer drizzled in balsamic vinegar and oil with a few roasted red peppers.  Although the buffalo mozzarella was a little thin it was an amazing mixture.  The tomatoes were crisp and fresh. The portion of prosciutto was generous for our table. I would have liked literally a couple more roasted red peppers. The two appetizers were more than enough to begin our dinner. From the time we sat and ordered the timing of the waitress was fine. In fact we had to send her away a few times because we just kept chatting. The waitress joked with us which sometimes can be annoying but we all took it in stride. I think some people might not find it appropriate but yet again it was not over the top. I ordered the Lisce Penne con Pollo and I was shocked at how good it was. Don't get me wrong I have always had good food there but it was always rich. This dish was just right. The ziti filled up with the pesto sauce so when I bit into a ziti the sauce would explode in my mouth. The chicken was awesomely flavored and not dry. Nothing was overpowering. My boyfriend had the Trinett Mafalda Bolognese which is a traditional bolognese sauce. He is VERY PICKY but enjoys this dish tremendously. This is the second time he has gotten it.  His sister got Portobello Lasagna which has no meat and no pasta but she made it disappear. She did say how amazing it was. As a world traveler she has tasted a variety of flavors and truly enjoyed her dish. Lastly my boyfriend's mom got the Brandelli and raved about how good it was.  We were so full from dinner we didn't have any room for dessert nor coffee.  The waitress wrapped up our leftovers and then brought the bill. We were using our Groupon which she took back then returned promptly with the new bill.  Another waitress also popped in to see if we wanted dessert.  We didn't feel neglected nor as though anything was done incorrectly.  The staff was pleasant. The food came out in great time and presented nicely.  We will be returning again and again and if the service is bad as it has been noted in other reviews we will just have to choose another day to return. Perhaps we should try a busier time of the week but we like our Sunday dinners out."},{"name":"Fat Duck Mobile Eatery","address":"","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Omg...the Philly confit sandwich!!

They provide free folding/camping chairs for the first 20 people or so, which helps... after striking conversations with the folks around me, I just sat down and read my book to pass the time. About an hour before opening, staff will start coming out to take drink orders and chat with folks waiting in line.\\"Enough nonsense. How was the food???\\"OK, let's be real... the sides at Franklin's were mediocre. The turkey, sausage, pulled pork all were solid but not worth a 4 hour wait. The pork ribs were surprisingly good (unfortunately, they didn't offer beef ribs that day) and probably some of the best I've had. But unquestionably, the star of the show was their amazingly moist, melt-in-your-mouth, peppery brisket! It really is THAT mind-blowing good! You won't need or want any sauces - the way true Texan BBQ should be. You can request fatty or lean brisket... go for the fatty and thank me later - because let's face it, if you're eating here, you're really not thinking \\"health consequences\\" at that point! Not sure I would do that wait if there was a next time, but I would do the brisket pre-order again!Also had a chance to chat with the man himself, Aaron Franklin, who was super down-to-earth and took a selfie with our group!"},{"name":"Mario's Restaurant","address":"347 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Old school awesomeness!

Avoid the lines at the place down the street and come here. No offense to the other joint...it might be fantastic. But this place is too. I ordered off menu and got the lobster tails over fettuccine in a scampi sauce. My taste buds are still salivating. The man got the pappardelle bolognese (veal, pork and beef).

My roommate and I stumbled across it while we were on the hunt for dinner. We were seated immediately and were greeted by our awesome server, Jason. He was knowledgeable and recommended the fried chicken wings (their speciality), which were AMAZING... like fall-off-the-bone amazing. My friend and I split the monthly burger, which was messy but delicious. Jason somehow convinced us to get the butterscotch pudding for dessert (even if you're not a dessert person, you need to try it). He then gave us two jello shots on the house. We couldn't stop talking about how amazing the meal was!I came across a coupon on Gilt City and of course had to buy it, so we went back last night. We were skeptical if the meal could really be as good as it was last time, but we were pleasantly surprised! We split the calamari and octopus salad for an app and each got the surf and turf entree. No dessert this time. This place is a gem. Jason is the best server ever and his recommendations have always been on point. I will definitely go back (even without a Gilt City coupon... but who doesn't like a promo?). I docked one star because I got the Moonshine cocktail and it was okay, nothing special. Moonshine 152 is a nice alternative from the typical Southie bro places with mediocre food and overpriced drinks."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

After an unsuccessful attempt (because this place gets slammed in the morning and you're not getting in without a reservation past 11 unless it's -5 degrees) I got to go in and give it a shot.  I was not disappointed.  From the outside the restaurant doesn't look too impressive but once you step inside you quickly see that it's a pretty cool space.  To the left of the door is a full bar with a cool library backdrop and then a more dining area to the right.  Thanks to the snow and cold weather we got right in and sat down.  The waiter was very personable and friendly and helped us feel right at home.  He took a little while to bring us some bread to start but he apologized once he did eventually bring it and all was forgotten.  There are so many awesome things on the menu we went a little crazy.  We ended up deciding on the Caramelized Plantain Empanadas, Baja Fish Tacos, Jalisco Chocolate Chip Pancakes, Masa Style BBQ Mac & Cheese, and the Cured Salmon and Poblano Quesadillas.The empanadas were ridiculous.  One of these would have been perfect for dessert but a little intense to start off with.  Little fried pockets of sweet plantains with a sweet cream cheese to dip it in.  Really good but be ready to be overwhelmed with sugar.  The fish tacos were really fresh and tasty.  They weren't deep fried like most fish tacos are so you got to taste each element of the taco versus a lot of friedness.  I like both kinds but this was a nice switch up.  The chocolate chip pancakes were the perfect amount of sweetness for me.  The chocolate used in this pancakes is definitely more dark and biter versus overly sweet milk chocolate, which was nice.  They give you three good sized pancakes packed full of chips.  The mac was unlike any I've ever had before.  The BBQ flavor mixed with bits of chorizo really give it a smoky, delicious flavor.  I really enjoyed it.  Lastly, the quesadillas topped with salmon.  The amount of salmon they top these quesadillas with doesn't make sense.  I honestly could have packed it back all together and re-created a full size 3 pound salmon replica.  Thankfully I'm not a weirdo and didn't do this but I was impressed by the amount.  Unfortunately I think the amount of salmon detracted from the flavor of the quesadilla.  All I really got was salmon and the cream cheese and roasted poblano was a little lost in there.  Still good but not one of my favorites of the day.Overall, it was a great experience.  The food was great, the service was great, the prices weren't bad and I was a happy camper.  The menu for dinner looks special as well so I may have to come in one night and check it out.  Definitely a nice spot to come with friends and grab a drink and hang out.  If you like delicious food and cool atmospheres, definitely check this place out."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The service was horrible!

Martin had a  Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold and I had a \\"Rick Astley\\".   Both of the drinks were \\"firsts\\" for us.  The  \\"Rick Astley\\"  is like an \\"Arnold Palmer\\" (iced tea and lemonade) with vodka.  It was perfect for a hot evening.  Very refreshing.  For me, though, I would probably order it \\"tall\\" next time.  It is just too easy to suck it down quickly...which I did...and which wasn't the best choice, if you know what I mean.Can't tell you about the beer because I forgot what my husband said.  Probably because of the Rick Astley.We also shared fried leeks and tater tots, both of which are very yummy there.  I kinda got my fill of the leeks this time, though, so it might be a while before I order them again.  Tater tots were great.  Not too greasy, but greasy enough that you knew they weren't baked in the oven, like I do at home!For this visit, David stuck with the Lara's Pittsburgh Princess dog with a brat which was what he had last time.  This is a dog topped with slaw, fresh cut fries, & malt vinegar.  He had a side of broccoli with cheese.  Enjoyed them both, but said he preferred the mac and cheese he had last visit to the broccoli.Audrey and I both got  Puff the Magic Popper, a dog topped with Cheddar cream cheese, jalape√±os, & real bacon bits.  We both liked our dogs, but comparing mine to last visit's dog  (True Love Always-Cream cheese & green olives), my personal preference was the True Love was better than the Puff. I thought I'd like all that bacon on the dog, but I really didn't.  I think it was the \\"bittiness\\" of the bits.  I think I would have liked a piece of bacon better.  Also, while I like hot food, including jalapenos, the jalapenos sort of overpowered the other flavors. So, basically what I'm saying is that I liked it, just didn't love it.Martin had the Brisket & Slaw Dog, which was a dog with....yes....Beef brisket &  slaw .  He liked this visit's dog better than his last visit dog.  What was that?  Nope, don't remember.  Check the review...Our server was really nice.

I live nearby and go often, especially for all-you-can-eat wing Mondays. The place isn't perfect, but in this price range... what is?The digs are just aiight. It's too dimly lit, and the red walls are a little overbearing (on the plus side, no creepy red lights like the Sunset Grill, so at least you won't feel like you're dining in the Lust scene from Se7en), but I'm not there to look at the walls, you know? Music tends to be pretty good - mostly old soul and funk. Good selection of local sports games playing on the TVs, and they have a huge projector on the main wall, so it's a fun place to watch a big game.The beer selection is decent and cheap - a lot of local selections, both canned and on tap. Tip #1: you will be required to order food of some kind if you order a drink - even if it's just cornbread (which is hit or miss, I've found - some days it's outstanding, and some days it's just mediocre).All-you-can-eat wing Mondays: THE BEST. These aren't your typical anemic bar wings, these are big, fat, meaty wings and drummies. There's a standard roster of three flavors: buffalo, Soul Fire sauce (their house sauce - a really solid spicy/sweet barbecue), and (I believe) their Pit Boss sauce, which is a rich, sweet barbecue. The fourth is a rotating flavor that changes every week - on various days, I've had bacon ranch (I died when I ate these, I'm actually writing this review from the grave), Thai green curry (delicious), golden barbecue (nice buttery barbecue), and coconut lime. The new(ish) chef is a whiz with soy-based sauces, so I expect a lot more Asian-inspired flavors in the future. Thank Jesus.Their normal menu is overall done right and priced right. A standout is the fried catfish - huge filets of flaky, moist deliciousness, and the spicy tartar sauce rules. Their fried chicken should also not be missed - it's unbelievably moist and tender with a crispy, mildly-spiced batter. Break away from the standard pulled pork and chicken (though both are good - especially when doused in the vinegary North Carolina sauce) and you'll find some real gems here. Tip #2: ask your server for the South Carolina sauce. It's a tangy, spicy mustard-based sauce that isn't on the menu, but it's the best of the bunch, in my opinion - especially on the fried chicken!Their sides are all slightly different takes on what you might expect from a southern barbecue joint - mac and cheese is creamy and delightful but not overly salty or gloppy, with crumbled barbecue chips on top. Both beans and collards are much sweeter than usual, and neither are cooked into mushy oblivion. The potato salad is as good as mom's, specifically my mom's. A large order of fried mac and cheese bites is easily a meal in itself - deep fried cubes of their normal mac and cheese, perfect for dipping into various sauces.Don't come here expecting the best barbecue you've ever had in your life (this is Boston, come on), but with a grain of salt and a little faith, you'll be more than satisfied."},{"name":"la vita pizza & pasta","address":"1155 Virginia Ave, Ste F","city":"Hapeville","stars":"3.5","text":"Service was fast.

I've never seen this place so packed.  Of course, there were power outages all over the state yesterday, so there's a strong likelihood that a lot of people were driven to dine out because they couldn't cook at home.  However, if that's their normal volume of dinnertime customers, then they must be doing something right.I showed up with my dining companion around 7 and arrived to find the parking lot and restaurant completely full.  We managed to snag a space and gave our name to the hostess who was able to find us a table in just a couple minutes.  Sweet!  We started dinner with an order of the bruschetta.  I hate to say it, but this appetizer only gets two stars.  It didn't taste bad or anything, just didn't wow me at all.  \\"Meh, I've had better\\" sums it all up.  My entree was another story.  I had the Greek baked lamb and LOVED it.  I don't know much about Greek food, so I can't judge it's authenticity, but I thought it was great.  Lamb was tender, the tomato-y sauce delicious.  It was served with rice and a vegetable.  My one complaint about the entree would be the green beans.  They were mushy like the ones you get in a can.  My entree also came with a Greek salad to start.  This was a very generous pre-dinner salad with kalamata olives (yum!) and loads of feta.  Wow, I just realized that my meal chronology is off as I went from appetizer to entree to pre-dinner salad.  In keeping with this helter skelter timeline, there's also something magical about the rolls here.  I dare say they are comparable to the rolls at Bertucci's.  We also ordered a 1/2 carafe of the house merlot, which yielded us each two glasses.  A 1/2 carafe was only $7.  Clearly, this wasn't the world's finest wine, but for that price who cares?  A friend stopped in while we were eating and joined us for a beer.  His 16 oz Sam Adams was only $3 and some change.  Not bad, I must say.  Not bad at all.Service was just a tad slow, but our waitress was exceedingly friendly.  She was an older woman who made sure we took our vegetables home in our doggie bags.  Very sweet.  In the end, the total bill for an appetizer, two entrees, a 1/2 carafe, and a beer was under $40.  Hot damn, I say!

They had never done it before, but they said yes!! I was thrilled to be their first, and they did a fantastic job! I seriously could not have been happier. We had fries and salads family style, everyone ordered whatever burger they wanted, we had a keg of great beer, fabulous pickles on the table and banana splits for dessert. They let my husband's family in early to decorate the patio, and gave us the patio for the whole evening.

It was one of the original \\"brass and fern\\" restaurants, and I am thankful to see the brass and ferns have gone the way of the dinosaur.Item to disclose: I once worked for this chain.  In grad school, I made ends meet waiting tables Friday to Monday at Ruby's in Greenville, SC while taking and teaching classes at Clemson Monday to Thursday.  Waiting tables is back breaking work that makes you appreciate the value of teamwork and a hard day's work. Having worked at Ruby's for a couple of years, I would gladly dine at one.  But one thing I learned waiting tables: don't piss off your waitron.  He or she sees your food before you do.  I'll leave it at that.  It's been several years since I've been to a Ruby's.  This one on Delk is the closest to us but is still several miles away, but we are not often near by, and it's just easier to stay closer to home. However, we had to run by Team Ford to pick up the Wagon Queen Family Truckster after getting the airbag light fixed, so we were right in the area and opted to stop by.  Additionally, we happened to have a coupon as well!The decor has changed from the brass and ferns of years ago.  The place is open, airy, and decorated tastefully.  The bar is in the center of the restaurant, but you run into the salad bar upon entering.  Might not be the best spot for it, but I guess that's how they want to run it.  Although we didn't get the salad bar, it appeared to have plenty of items to choose from.The menu has changed as well.  Gone is one of my favorites: the teriyaki marinated sirloin. That item was a real pleaser!  The menu has a nice mix of fish, chicken, and steak, but I will admit that the steak choices seemed rather slim.  But there were plenty of fix items to choose from. I picked the Creole-seasoned tilapia with saut√©ed shrimp.  It was one of the best fish dishes I'd had in a long time!  My wife choose a chicken dish and was pleased but wished she'd gotten the fish.  You get your choice of two sides with a dinner entree, and the there are plenty of sides to choose from.  I got sugar snap peas and mashed 'taters.  The kids chose the mini-burgers and the chicken fingers, both of which came with ample fries. Refills arrived quickly, and they even refilled my younger son's chocolate milk at no extra charge.  Most places charge for each chocolate milk refill.  Maybe they normally do here, and we got off, but it was a nice perk either way.So yes, this is a chain, but I don't think you'll be disappointed if you attend.  We went on a week night, and it wasn't busy at all, but I cannot speak to what it's like on weekends.

Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Let me start off by saying that I'm in between 2 and 3 stars, but after really thinking about my latest experience...they follow closer to 2. My boyfriend's brother was in town and he wanted Mexican and since we had both been here before and remembered it was good...we decided this was the place. Well...our trip left me very disappointment.  Pros - \\n* Free torillas with entrees...yet you only get 3 at a time and we had to keep on asking our server to bring us more. \\n* Lots of parking. \\n* Pretty large patio and the entire restaurant (inside and out) is decorated very well.\\n* Adios Cafe coffee...great selection. Check out my review on them. Cons - \\n* Prices can be a tad high. Ok there are a few things that are competitive with other Mexican restaurants, but $13 for a 3 taco plate (plus an extra $1 if you want steak) is just too much. Especially when there's a different Mexican restaurant at every corner. I think I was mostly irritated about the prices since we were there for lunch and they don't have a lunch menu on the weekends.  \\n* Service was ok. Our waiter was nice, but he didn't know the menu at all (how things were cooked, certain veggies included, etc), we also had to keep on asking him for more water/coffee, and when he cleared the table and noticed that all 3 of us only ate half of our food...he didn't ask us why. I appreciate a server who is knowledgeable about his restaurant, but also invested in my table. He wasn't. \\n* Food was fair. I ended up going with the steak nachos and I would have to say about 1/4 of the chips were burnt and most of the steak as dry. The ones that weren't dry/burnt were tasty though. My boyfriend's brother's food (steak and eggs) also came out cold. But since we had already waited about 15 minutes for our food...he just ate it.  Overall...I hate giving a restaurant a poor review, but I do feel that they have a lot of potential. They have a very cool atmosphere and would probably be a lot of fun for large groups or a girls night. I'm sure I'll give them another chance...just hope they don't disappoint me again."},{"name":"Aria","address":"490 E Paces Ferry Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"It had been a couple years since my wife and I went here.  We don't live in Atlanta, but come every couple months for a weekend and usually always trying to go somewhere new and different.  This time, I decided to return to the best meal I have ever had in Atlanta to see if it has stood the test of time and the verdict...absolutely YES!!!  Aria offers a truly wonderful dining experience.  From the moment you walk in and greet you, take you to the small but oh so sexy bar to get you set up with drinks, and escort you to your table, you know from the first moments their patrons matter to them.  Both wife and I started with a perfect fresh, simple, perfectly executed salad with arugula and escarole, spiced pecans, plums and wonderfully simple lemon vinaigrette.  For my entree I had the most succulent, fall off the bone lamb shank over a smooth polenta and roasted vegatables.  A wonderful start to fall.  Wife had the most beautiful, perfectly cooked scallops that had a great crust and melted in your mouth.  We finished with a shared desert of a warm apple tart with vanilla ice cream.  Sweet apples cooked into a great crust.  Its a beautiful restaurant with a romantic atmosphere.  Service is perfect.  Helpful, but not pushy and always there to help.  It is a place for a special night as it is pricey, but 5 star meals like this are and Aria deserves every star it gets.

We ordered two combo platters (ribs & brisket) with baked beans, mac n cheese and tater tots. We also ordered the smoked chicken wings, the chili and the banana pudding. Wait for to go was 30 minutes. We waited and sat in the parking lot eating our food.\\nThe smoked wings were just the tip of the iceberg! Wow full of flavor, perfectly grilled and the smoky bbq hot sauce and blue cheese dressing that came with it should be bottled and sold. The bowl of chili was amazing.  Full body and flavor. The sliced brisket is not to be missed. So juicy with a bit of fat that was perfectly charred. The ribs were equally as good and super tender. They ran out of pork so we couldn't try that. The baked beans were smoky and delicious. The mac n cheese was super cheesy and creamy. Having never tried banana pudding I thought it was excellent. Not too sweet but very smooth consistency and it came with crushed vanilla wafers that gave it great texture and bite. I would of definitely waited 3 hours need be for that amazing bbq experience.*now that being said I don't know why the wait was so long because there were a ton of tables not being utilized. Don't know if its bad management or what. But on the patio had at least 5 tables and on the inside they also had tons of tables not at use.

I made a reservation because I've heard it gets pretty crowded and it was so I suggest a reservation unless you want to sit at the bar. I made it for 5 people but was only 4 the day of and it was not a big deal to the hostess and accommodated is very quickly. The place doesn't look like much from the outside but the inside is a large place that has a bar area and normal dining room. The tables are pretty close together but not so that its uncomfortable. They have good lighting from the windows and tasteful decorations that make the place feel slightly more classy than any normal brunch place. The exposed brick is painted which is a slight pet peeve of mine since exposed brick is very aesthetically pleasing. Anyway it took about 15 mins for a waiter to come by but we weren't in a rush and the place was busy. We ended up getting to order at 11:10 but we wanted the brunch deal of an app and entree for 10 dollars but that ended at 11. Again they were very accommodating and let us order that. We ordered our drinks and our food. Three of us were getting a mimosa or Bellini because you know it is brunch. The waiter said that if we buy the bottle the juice comes free and it actually saved us about 20 dollars. Which most waiters wouldn't do so I highly appreciate that being a former waiter and bartender. I ended up getting the friend plantain empanada and the Santa Fe style eggs Benedict. They were both amazing. The empanada was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The eggs Benedict was a spicier eggs Benedict with avocado and was one of the better eggs Benedict I've ever had. We split the bill and spent about 35-40 bucks each for the whole meal.
