I read in some previous reviews that there are people who drive hours to eat here and I believe it. You have to understand, this type of cuisine is a revelation in this area. Usually what you get in terms of Taiwanese/Chinese food is deep fried-starched meats drenched in neon colored sauces, or maybe a stir fry. A word of caution; be prepared to see items on the menu that are very much the opposite of what you're accustomed to. When you come to Tai Pei, you could order that other stuff you'd normally get at other Chinese places but they have the real deal here, foods that if you were to fly over to Taiwan, you'd find being prepared by street vendors; that is the type of food you will find here.\\n \\nThe soy milk.  In no way does it taste like the milk you'd buy at the store; this is real soy milk that they prepare in house, sweet, flavorful, without all the chemicals and additives; absolutely delicious and refreshing on a hot day. (They have salty soy milk as well if that is your preference)Zongzi.This is incredibly delicious, and in my mind it is the equivalent of an asian tamale or a pastel. It's sticky rice stuffed with pork and wrapped in bamboo leaves. The rice itself has a sweetness to it, it's warm, it's filling; just order it, you'll be glad that you did.\\n \\nAs an entr√©e; the last two times I've ordered their fried fish lunch box. The fish is cooked perfectly each time, very moist and tender on the inside, but crispy on the outside, brimming with spicy peppers on top; insanely delicious. The seasoning, I'd venture to say is five spice mixed with flour or breadcrumbs, just phenomenal.\\n \\nIn true Taiwanese style, they serve your rice/noodles with finely chopped pork that's been simmered and in a gravy of its own juices, yup; very delicious. If you order the lunch box it comes with both rice and noodles and vegetables but I personally find that their noodles are the way to go so you do have the option of just getting all noodles instead of rice.\\n \\nI'm told that I've only touched the tip of the iceberg and that there are still many delicious dishes like their fried tofu, steamed bun with pork belly, and the spicy beef noodle soup which they only serve 15 bowls of each day, so come early for that particular dish.If all of this weren't enough of an incentive to dine here; I'm going to throw you another one. Service is good here. The owners are very friendly and more than happy to accommodate your request or answer questions; all that's left is for you to go and try it yourself."},{"name":"Emmets of Norwood","address":"434 Providence Hwy","city":"Norwood","stars":"3.5","text":"So while staying at the local hotel I thought I would give this local pub a try since I've heard good things about it in the food was very good it wasn't great but the food was very gets I give it 3 stars"},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent service.

Also, though this is family style and prices as such, the portions were not family sized. We ordered two dishes, peanut sauce, and sticky rice, and it really wasn't enough. Especially the sticky rice. A side order (no rice came with our dishes) was (I believe) $4, and it portioned out two small scoops.

We liked it before we even got there. The outside decor was artfully done and inviting. But there weren't many other positive things we can say about the place, most especially - the food. Such a disappointment. My shrimp fra diavolo was a huge glob of spaghetti (too al dente) and 7 shrimp. Because the dish did not include other seafood, that was disappointing. But the real disappointment was the sauce or \\"gravy\\" as we call it in our house. There was no flavor and no kick to it which, of course, is what fra diavolo sauce has. My friends meal was scallops (very generous) with one blob of vegetable. End of story. Not much flavoring, overcooked. My husband had the best dish-a rigatoni and mushroom plate. It was flavorful but the presentation was not great. We asked for grated cheese, salt and pepper as they were not on the table. They gave us a salt shaker and ground the cheese and pepper for us, which I normally like but it was not enough. It was rushed and I felt strange not to have control of the seasoning of my food. At the bread course we would have liked to have some grating cheese. Dessert we got the cannoli's. The shells were not fresh although the ricotta, citrus stuffing was quite good. But we didn't finish them ( and they were tiny). The stale shells turned us off.All in all-the venue is decorated beautifully but the noise level is distracting. Very, very loud and we were trying to catch up with one another but our conversation was at a minimum. Food-not good and wait time was exceptionally long. Our server was wonderful which was a plus. The cappuccino was also great. Best part of the meal!We are hoping that because the restaurant was crowed that night that the food orders got ahead of them and the quality suffered.

Made a last minute decision of wanting a steak so I cancelled my dinner reservations to The Optimist. My husband had called on the same day to make a last minute reservation and the only available time was 10pm. To me it was a late but for a damn good steak? I'll take it. Even told the ladies on the phone that we will be celebrating our 1 year anniversary. I'm stoked. I did so much research before even making this reservation. Upon arriving two ladies at the host stand greeted us and even said congratulations on your one yr and asked us when are we having kids lol. I jokingly said never. She then promptly seated us at a booth next to the bar. I actually loved the booth table because it was nice and spacious. Candle lit on every table :) Our server was Shawn. He introduced himself and gave us highlights of what the restaurant was known for. Again keep in mind this is around 10:15 and they close at 11:00pm. While I was looking at the menu my husband and I were not exactly sure what to order. Called Shawn to give us some recommendations. He sounded like he was in a hurry or he just didn't really care what we were going to order. Husband and I decided to order lobster fritters, baked escargot and a glass of riesling for myself to start. For dinner we picked a 6oz filet mignon(medium), 20oz ribeye(med well... husband never liked med rare or medium that's the way he likes it), creamed corn, parmesan french fries, and creamed spinach. Our steak was also accompanied by 2 sauces. 1)House steak sauce 2)Black truffle butter. We both very much enjoyed the appetizers. My steak was a perfect medium and portion sized. My husbands ribeye was good. But I'm pretty sure it would've been much tastier if it was a medium ;) The side dishes were plentiful. Overall the food I give it a solid 4 stars. We did have a lot of leftovers so we had the rest boxed up. We asked for a dessert menu after and he brought us two. The only thing that really captured my eye was the creme br√ªl√©e. Still decided not to order anything because Hostess said that they give a complimentary anniversary dessert. Our bill came out to $177.50 I left a $30 cash tip. Now to the negative reviews. I felt like Shawn wasn't a very attentive server. Throughout the whole dinner service he forgot to refill our waters and gave all his other tables more attention. Im not sure if its that the other tables had a bottle of wine or they ordered more.. and he decided to give us less attention. It made me upset to the CORE that this was my anniversary dinner and I got NO love from my waiter. I felt like he was just trying to hurry up, make his money and get out of the restaurant. I understand that I came and made a reservation at 10pm. It just means you shouldn't treat me any different. I am still a customer, I came for a wonderful dining experience and it was my 1 year anniversary dinner that ruined. So Shawn for that I give you 2 stars for your customer service.

I do think the hostess need to pay attention to the customers. In the room along with us we're 2 older men with canes along with myself who just had knee replacement and my wife in a walking cast and instead of sitting us in the main dinning area on the floor that we entered in they took us downstairs and to the farthest away from all the food. So we had to make 4 trips up and down stairs just to get one plate of food. Other than the walking for some that shouldn't the service was good .

Well, I better get on it, the suggestion from my Co-workers was to go to skyline chili and get the 5-ways to experience the taste of Cincinnati and Columbus.Upon arriving to my destination the set up is similar to a Diner/Denny's. I arrived on a slow point of the day as most of the workers were just hanging out and conversating. I took a seat at the front bar  (Why did i choose the most awkward place to sit?!) I ordered the regular sized 5-ways and watched as the cooks make my meal and having the rest of the staff staring at me as I snap a picture when it arrived in front of me.Food review:I'm glad I tried it, would i be coming back anytime soon? most likely not. The cinnamon really overpowered the flavor of the chili and even the mountain of cheese they stack on top. The meat looks like the Jack in the Box soy-meat they put in their $0.99 tacos. By the time I ate half of my meal i could see a pool of the watery sauce pooling at the bottom. it wasn't my thing and I'm sure if I had a home-cooked style of this Cincinnati favorite I'd enjoy it more but, this didn't cut it for me (not saying no one else would love it, just wasn't for me) with the over powering of the cinnamon flavor that ran though out the dish that hid the flavor of all the other ingredients with the watery spaghetti noodles that diluted the flavor even further it just didn't wow me.End of food review.The establishment is clean and when a fly flew into one of the chili they were really quick to react and dispose of the chili and replaced it with a new batch. The establishment was clean and my server was really great and attentive. But, since it was slow and they seemed over staffed during the time I came with majority of them just standing around and complaining about wages and hours it didn't really leave a great dining experience for me as I could overheard every complain as I was sitting right up front."},{"name":"The Loud Juice Cafe","address":"440 E St Elmo Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"Loving this new juice joint at The Yard!

I visited here for the first time with two of my friends and all of us were very impressed at how the burgers were prepared. It puts a creative twist on \\"sliders\\". I had the fried chicken sandwich. Aged beef & salmon burger. They were individually very tasty & interesting burgers. If you include your side item. A trio is a lot to eat. I would recommend starting with the two sliders duo and a side item. The owner was very kind and patient with us as we had a lot of questions on options. He was very professional in his multitasking skills as well. Yes at one point he was on the register helping another employee. And at another point in the kitchen with gloves on helping prepare orders. In my opinion. There are people on here that are being a tad hyper-critical because I personally see that as a humble business owner that is not afraid to wear the many necessary masks of a well oil machine. There are plenty of other establishments were managers would rather watch employees provide poor service instead of putting their clip board down and putting in the labor in the name of customer satisfaction. Great attitude. Great burger spot. I will be back because it's different. Different than five guys and yes. Different than vortex. I enjoyed the food. And I enjoyed the establishment. But hey.

The place was packed and inviting aromas from the kitchen permeated thought-out the room. As soon as I sat down at a table, a waitress attended to me immediately. I didn't see any KFC on the menu so I chose the BBQ beef boolgogi which came with miso soup, salad, rice and small-bowl sides of kimchi, savory boiled potatoes, tofu and some others that I had no idea what the names were but they were very palatable. One thing that really impress me were the stainless steel chop sticks. The engravings at the top of the chop sticks gave one a firm grip to maneuver the chop sticks with precision. At first I was not pleased to see the bone-in slices of beef but after savoring one slice, it didn't matter. I would like to thank Rocky Rice for an unsavory and unpleasant experience otherwise I would not have found a real Korean restaurant.

When I arrived I was greeted by Shawn. He checked me in and then escorted me to the salon space which is located down a short flight of stairs off of the main entrance. There he introduced me to Blessing, Lydia and a third stylist (can't remember her name). All three were so warm and friendly which is so great because sometimes visiting a new salon, in another state, can be intimidating. I got a shampoo, deep conditioning and roll set. It was heaven, especially since I had just gotten my color updated a week before and my hair was pretty dry. And for the deep conditioning they use this cool special hooded dryer that literally steams your hair. My hair is naturally abs would be described as 3c/4a. The ladies at this salon definitely know what they're doing when it comes to black hair. I was thoroughly impressed with my entire experience at Studio 27. The hair treatment was amazing. But more importantly the customer experience was exceptional and the energy of this salon is unlike anything I've ever experienced.

In April of 2012, they sold the trailer and moved in to their new permanent space in East Austin. I never had the pleasure of eating at the trailer, but in my research of Austin, this new restaurant sounded like a great place to go for comfort food.We headed there for dinner on a Sunday evening. The inside decor is that of a 50's diner with bright turquoise walls, floors, and tables with a jukebox on the wall. It was kind of cute. We decided to sit outside at one of their turquoise picnic tables on this nice, warm evening.They had a modest wine list, but we weren't expecting anything spectacular from a diner-like place. Zach ordered a wine from Texas (very bold of him) and I ordered a sustainable red wine. We both liked mine better and agreed that it would be nice if they offered a few more choices. They also need to get some real wine glasses.We placed our orders and within minutes were becoming mosquito food. Before we got eaten alive, we decided to move indoors. The waiter seemed very understanding as he remarked that the bugs can be vicious at times. We started with the Spicy Bake Artichoke Dip. Oh my gosh, this was delicious! It was this incredibly creamy dip made of baked artichokes and jalapenos. It was served with this fresh, warm bread. We basically licked the plate.We both ordered the Philly Seitan. This sandwich was on the same bread that we were served with the dip. The \\"meat\\" was housemade wheat meat thinly sliced with sauteed green peppers and onions and topped with a cashew cheese made with nutritional yeast. The sauce was thick and creamy and coated the seitan well. We both loved this sandwich. This was a win. On the side, I ordered garlicky Swiss chard - delish! Zach had the roasted root vegetables.We loved the decor and the food; and the service was great. Overall, it was reasonably priced at $8 for the sandwich and $7 for the appetizer. This is a restaurant that goes on the top of my list of places to eat in Austin. Highly recommended for comfort food."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Note: There is more than one Powell's so make sure to go to the one on Burnside.

Their menu is very non traditional and you won't find the typical pad thai or red curries we're used to. If you read through the description the dishes are very familiar and combines flavors of Thai, Lao, Burmese, Vietnamese and Chinese. It was hard to decided what to order because so many items we're appealing and different from what I'm used to at a traditional Thai restaurant.We end up skipping their famous wings because we were all fried chickened out from the trip and focused our appetite on 2 entrees. I'm not going to lie, my jaw dropped when I saw the wings at the every table.  I wanted to order it BADLY!  They we're humungous but we didn't want to stuff ourselves in case we wanted to squeeze in dessert or one more stop. We went with the Khao soi because I was in a curry noodle soup mood and one of the specials which was a whole fried tilapia. They were both beautiful and delicious!The Khao soi was delicious. They used a thick flat egg noodle and the soup was creamy and rich. I liked how it was garnished with deep fried strips and a side of fresh pickled veggies. The fried tilapia was over a bed of herbs and spices and was huge! It came with 2 tasty dipping sauces: sweet and sour and a green spicy sauce.The staff was very friendly/accommodating and there is a full bar inside the restaurant. I highly recommend Pok Pok.

Fish and chips: Was literally 1 whole fish that was pouring grease laid on top of potato wedges that were also covered in grease. Mushroom swiss burger: Ordered medium, came rare and swiss cheese was hard and cold. Had only 3 mushrooms on it and were hidden under the cold cheese. Potato wedges were greasy. Black and blue burger: ordered med rare, came med well. Literally only had sauteed onions on it that tasted like they were sauteed days ago and stored to use later. No blue cheese or anything else.

Unfortunately Wings over Somerville ain't it.I've gotten takeout from here twice -- the second time because I was hoping the first time was just a mistake, a bad night, whatever.But no. I'm sorry, but the wings are consistently soggy, the sauce is flat, the fries are meh, and when you throw cheese sauce on 'em they're bleh.The service is OK -- enough to give them one extra star.

Out of all the steakhouse, this seemed like a decent one to eat at. Tucked all the way at the end of a road, we were promptly seated when we arrived. It was not packed because it was a Monday night. The complimentary cheesy bread was a great start to our dinner. We got the seafood tower which had 3 of each (shrimps, oysters, crab legs, lobsters). Crab legs were very fresh. We also tasted the eggplant fries and bone marrow. I recommend both! The 10 oz ribeye was more than enough for one person. Pair that with black truffle butter and creamy mash and you got a divine meal. My friends also got the dry aged for 2 and it was also delicious. No one could finish their food. Everything was decently priced for a steakhouse with great quality food and meat!

I was worried there might be a long line after reading reviews, but on a Monday night there was no wait at all! My friend and I ordered the fish sauce wings, glass noodles with prawns, and the braised pork belly w/ curry sauce. First off, the fish sauce wings were amazing!! So full of flavor and crunchy, yet tender on the inside. The braised pork belly w/ curry sauce was also delicious, but I wouldn't recommend getting both of these dishes just because they're both pretty salty and have strong flavors. Having both dishes made us drink so much water hahah!!, but delicious nonetheless. Tip: make sure you order a side of rice with the braised pork belly! The glass noodles were just okay for us. There wasn't much flavor, but it did balance out the meal because the other two dishes were quite heavy.

I only gave Torchy's 3 out of 5 stars for the following 2 reasons:\\n1. for the money these are very small tacos.\\n2. they put waaaaaay too much salt in these things, making them almost inedible sometimes, so you have to find the less salty types by trial and order and select accordingly."},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"It gets really busy and expect to pay around $18 for your meal (assuming you get a sandwich, side & a drink).

I don't know if its because we've been spoiled by all the good and authentic Thai food in California, Pok Pok just didn't live up to the hype. When you walk into their dining room, you're immediately hit with the smell of fish sauce. I understand that many of their dishes rely on fish sauce but the restaurant should not smell like one. With that said,they do an excellent job of putting descriptions of the items offered on the menu so you do have some idea of what you're ordering. Kaeng Hang Leh  (Northern Thai sweet pork belly, pork shoulder curry with ginger, palm sugar, turmeric, tamarind, Burmese curry powder, pickled garlic): This curry fish was unbelievably salty. Borderline inedible salty. EVen with rice it was just ridiculous. It was such a shame because the curry itself had some good flavors and the pork belly itself was very tender. It tasted more like Indian curry though rather than Thai curry. Muu Sateh (Carlton Farms pork loin skewers marinated in coconut milk, turmeric, served with peanut sauce, cucumber relish, grilled bread): How can satay be so flavorless? It was unbelievably bland and the peanut sauce did nothing to help it along. My husband loves satay but he hated it here. That's how bad it was. The only redeeming part of this dish was their cucumber relish and grilled bread. Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings (whole natural chicken wings marinated in fish sauce, sugar, deep fried, tossed in caramelized Vietnamese fish sauce, garlic and served with pickled vegetables): Their signature dish and famous chicken wings. I thought they were pretty good the first wing and possibly the second wing. But the fish sauce quickly became overwhelming as we continued to eat the dish. I really had to rely on the pickled vegetables to cleanse my palate otherwise it just got way too salty. Pok Pok has a huge problem when it comes to seasoning. It's either too much or nonexistent. I also hated the fact that they charged for a very small bowl of rice. I've bad much better Thai food pretty much everywhere else so we really walked out feeling like we wasted $50. Yes, it is VERY expensive for what it is and not worth coming back to ever. 1/5"},{"name":"The Oyster Shack","address":"8460 Alexandra Road, Unit 165","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"I was looking for crawfish but found it closed so instead of eating chinese food decided to give it a plunge.

We mentioned to our waitress that we desired some yummy oysters, but had no idea where to start, and she was more than happy to order us a dozen that she thought we'd enjoy.I can't tell you which oysters were which, but they were darn good oysters. I'm typically more of a happy hour $.50 to $1.00 oyster kind of guy, so while I could assuredly detect that there was more complexity to these oysters we were consuming - some being exquisitely briny and others having an interesting sweetness to them - besides being able to note these simple differences among the oysters, I can't say I've developed enough of palette for oysters to tell you that they were of such superior quality and that they were worth the $3-4 cost per oyster, which still seems too pricy for me.Besides that the clam chowder we split was great, especially with the wonderfully thick chunks of bacon floating around in it. And our salmon tartare was good too, but I felt like it could have maybe used a little more seasoning. I really enjoyed the pure fresh taste of the salmon, but I couldn't really detect much other seasonings or preparation that went into it.This place was great overall! I guess I feel at a bit of a loss to describe whether or not this place was worth the more expensive price tag, as I'm used to eating more cheaper seafood. The quality was definitely there, but I'm just not sure it was worth that much of an extra cost. But the experience of getting to eat some wonderful seafood in Boston with my friend right next to the river was amazing and I definitely recommend this place to those wishing for a cool experience eating exquisite seafood in Boston!"},{"name":"Hakata Ramen","address":"673 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Wanted to try Ramen in my own city and It was meek!

Service was distracted at best. We ended up with 2 orders of mussels, one of linguine, a pizza, and a caesar salad. The mussels did not have a fresh smell, and three mussels were broken, suggesting lack of care in preparation. The caesar salad was simple with dressing, no grated cheese, and no croutons - -rather unimaginative. The linguine was well prepared, and the pizza was ok. The food preparation area appears unclean.

My review is solely based on having tried only this one dish. To my dismay, the wings were on the saltier side. It was a good blend of seasoning but I just wished it wasn't so loaded on sodium. I've had Vietnamese fish sauce wings in little Saigon Orange County that are not as loaded with sodium and still tasted really good. I'd highly recommend you order a side of sticky rice or jasmine rice to pair with the chicken wings unless you have a high tolerance for lots of salt. The amount of salt in this dish alone may exacerbate your blood pressure and heart failure lol. We came at 3:45pm on a Friday and still had to wait as a party of 6 for 30 minutes with no one else in front of us which is surprising. I could only imagine how horrendous the wait would be if we came during peak hours. In my opinion, the chicken wings alone are not a worthy dish to wait for. Now, I have not tried the rest of their menu so I am not sure if the other dishes are worth the wait. But given that the wings is the most popular dish, I am not impressed by this establishment so far.

It looked like the employee put about 3/4c of cheese on my pita. To be called healthy pita with these standards is really a misnomer.

We came at kind of an off hour, around 2pm on a very rainy Friday, and were seated immediately! There were only a handful of other tables filled, which meant that service was super attentive and willing to take some time to talk through menu items, etc. The guy can't have gluten, so we were asking some questions about various menu items, when the server went and grabbed a whole separate menu marked up with the various allergens in each dish--if you're a person with any food allergies, make sure you ask for this! A super super helpful and easy guide! After scarfing down the amazing spicy complimentary peanuts, we got to work whittling down our food selections. We had the Yam Samun Phrai to start, a light salad that tasted really fresh and was a great appetizer to whet our palettes. It definitely had a kick to it though, which we were not expecting because the dressing was described as mild. But it was so good that we didn't mind powering through a bit of spice. I had the Ike's wings that everyone raves about and they were stupendous. Some of the best wings I've ever had in my life, fried to crispy perfection with tons of meat on each plump wing. They're super super fish saucy, so probably pass on these guys if you can't hang with that sharp flavor. I loved these, but they were about 15% too salty for my taste--definitely would've benefitted with a bit of sticky rice on the side (i thought about this while ordering but eventually decided against, as I had to save some tummy room for dinner). The guy went with the Cha Ca \\"La Vong\\" at my recommendation and hearty support from our server. A man who loves him some seafood, he proclaimed this as easily the best catfish he's ever had in his life. I snuck a bite and confirmed. It's somehow cooked so that the catfish is melt-in-your-mouth buttery, while still maintaining a feeling of health and lightness in the dish. He was truly thrilled. For drinks, he had the yuzu hot toddy, which was spectacular on a rainy day, and a super fun twist on a toddy. Toddies are my favorite drink and this is by far one of the best ones I've ever tried. I stuck to my tried and true Vietnamese coffee because the pdx rain was making me very sleepy, and have zero regrets because it was exactly the bone-rattling, mind-starting, extra strong coffee that I adore. I love Pok Pok so much, and 100% understand why it's a Portland institution. We definitely lucked out not having to wait, but I think the wait is worth it for the awesome experience and unique Thai dishes."},{"name":"Kiku Japanese Steakhouse","address":"3630 Marketplace Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Horrible service.

The evening started out auspiciously enough: no wait, strong margaritas served with beautiful flowers in them, spicy salsa.We started with the fiesta salad to share, and it was...fine. We might have been happier with the rest of the food that came out except that our waiter messed up the order. Why? 1) Acoustics. It got SO LOUD in there that you could barely hear anything. They need to get sound panels. 2) There are not enough servers on the floor. We saw two--maybe three. No wonder things got messed up. The mom ordered enchiladas, but ended up with one of our orders, Emma's Choice, so we ate her quesadillas (that nobody ordered) instead. The shrimp taco plate was pretty good because it seemed like they were using real shrimp. Again, everything was fine, but the mood was soured because nobody is thrilled not to get the dish that they originally wanted. The food here isn't bad, and if we had gotten what we actually ordered, we probably would be leaving a 4 star review with plans to come back.

They did not take reservations on the phone but said we should be able to get a walk in seat in. We arrived and we were told there was a 40 minute wait due to advanced reservations....that was a load of BS! Although the host was polite, they said there was an opening at the bar. So to our disappointment, we sat at the bar and it wasn't romantic. While we sat there, there several open tables that were opened the entire time we were at the bar. This was stupid business move for the restaurant. If they said, we don't have enough servers at the dining room, I would understand that over obvious lies!!! What ever excuses they had, was juvenile and unprofessional. Nonetheless it was not a complete loss because Jess the bartender was the best server and bartender... I believe he served us before last year.  Also, he was very easy on the eye. He recommended The Rosette de Savoie- Altesse (white wine) and he was right. Nice $11 glass of wine. Then he explained the menu and we ordered the fried oyster sliders, raw oysters, soft shell crab Bahn mi and the lobster roe noodles with braised beef then carrot cake..yum! Delicious and rich! Although, it wasn't the most romantic experience with hubby, I had fun and a good dining experience at the bar. I give Jess 5 stars...

And i can still say.. this place is still my favorite oyster house in boston! SO have never been here so We stopped in here last minute on a Tuesday evening with no reservations. \\nWe were quickly seated with no wait and even got the table we had our eyes on! We did a mix on a dozen oysters and wellfleet will remain to be our favorite! I didn't see and canadians which I absolutely love but didn't catch any this time around. Salmon crudo was very unique and different in flavor but it worked and was not bad. Very nice twist. We both loveddd the halibut ceviche. Very original, tasty, refreshing, and clean. I wish the portion was a bit bigger. I find it small even for the two of us to share. The mussels was very yummy and very well cooked! The flavors were all there! I do love the fries on the top but i do expect more from isoh! Only because every single plate were delightful and had its own twist. Maybe homemade fries or homemade chips? The prime steak was nicely done. The plating and sides and flavors were well put together. My palates were very happy. Brussel sprouts could be cooked a tad bit longer. But it was perfect. SO had beers and i had the desert rose. I absolutely loved it and it totally screamed my name. Service was good, he knew it was date night so he gave us our privacy but also gave us just enough attention. \\nAmbiance was on point. \\nMusic was perfect. \\nLighting was just right. \\nWe will definitely be back!

They say you can call ahead and pick up and pay at the head of the line, but that never seems to work. When you show up it's awkward and unclear when to cut in at the register and pay. There should be a dedicated pickup area. It may sound small, but this is enough of a hassle to keep me away.Also no delivery. I used to live in Kendall Square.

Before I get started, I strongly recommend visitors to make a reservation far, far in advance. Prior to our visit, Will C. and I made a reservation for two about 10-15 days in advance. And even at that, we had to settle with a very late reservation (9:30pm or later). Upon our arrival, we were seated almost immediately. Despite the fact that we rolled in at 9:30pm, the restaurant was still extremelyyyyy booked. The restaurant definitely has an upscale interior, but plenty of people were dressed down, so don't feel like you have to come in looking your finest.Once we were seated, our waiter brought us some complimentary bread and butter. That sweet butter is addicting af. Beware! Will C. and I started with a dozen oysters - 6 Island Creek and 6 of another type (I don't recall the name). We really, really enjoyed the oysters. I personally like West coast oysters more than East coast oysters, but hot damn...the oysters we had at Island Creek were extremely fresh and not too brine-y. I was even impressed by the bed of ice that the oysters came on. I'm telling you, it's the little things that made this restaurant our favorite of our entire Boston trip. With your oysters, you also get a little basket full of different hot sauces, but I recommend you forego the hot sauce and stick with the a little lemon, cocktail sauce, and horseradish to get the full flavor of the oysters. We had to wait quite a bit for our entrees to come out, but it was well worth the wait. Will C. and the Lobster Roll and I decided to have their famous Lobster Roe Noodles. I had a bite of Will C.'s Lobster Roll and that thing was DELICIOUS. Huge, fresh clumps of lobster on a hot buttered roll. Mm-mm-MMMMM. It doesn't get better than that! This dish was also served with a side of coleslaw and house-made chips. The Lobster Roe Noodles are famous for a reason. The noodles come with braised short-rib and lobster. That sounds like a strange combination, I know, but trust me...they know what they are doing. I can't really explain what this dish tastes like because it was way past my bedtime...just know that it's HELLA GOOD. I wish my boyfriend and I weren't so tired because we could have totally gone for drinks and dessert, but because were so exhausted, we decided to end the meal and make our way back to our hotel. For a truly outstanding dining experience, I highly recommend Island Creek Oyster Bar."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"A book-lover's dream.

They've managed to be one of the places in Boston that's always busy, even on a random snowy weeknight, but they have a way of making you feel welcome and doing their best to take care of you from the moment you walk in, even without a reservation (although I'd certainly recommend trying to get one).  I've had amazing service every time I go; they seem to have a team approach, and while that can be hit-or-miss in some establishments, it works at ICOB. Everyone seems to be singularly focused on making sure that you have a great experience.  Decor is really cool, it feels a bit Manhattan-esque, and there is a great wall of oyster shells along the back, very interesting to look at.Now to the important things - food and drinks!  I'm a wine and cocktails person in general, but I end up getting beer at ICOB.  My go-to beer is the ICOB Pils, which is always available, although I also enjoy their selection of Brooklyn Brewing Company and Anchor beers. They have a number of other interesting draft and bottled beers as well as an extensive wine list.I have to admit that I sometimes judge restaurants right away by their bread, and ICOB never disappoints.  Or should I say their butter is the best I've ever had.  It comes with honey, red chili flakes, and salt, and I'd eat the butter by itself if it weren't socially unacceptable.After getting oysters - there are often 10-12 types ranging from PEI down the East Coast to Virginia, as well as a few from the West Coast - which are always shucked to perfection, it's time to hit the entrees.  I've enjoyed the various insanely fresh fish dishes, it's always made to perfection.  My favorite dish. however, and perhaps my favorite dish in any restaurant in Boston, is the Lobster Roe Noodles.  When I went 3 weeks ago it wasn't on the menu and I had a minor heart attack. It's got some generous chunks of lobster claw, braised short rib, and noodles.  Perfection in a dish, I'd say.In summary - an amazing restaurant with a great vibe, warm service, and amazing seafood.

And while it is partly grub hubs fault it is totally this restaurants fault as well. I ordered the chicken avocado sandwich. I was given a sandwich that was mostly bun as the chicken only covered half the bun. The chicken and bacon were burnt. The lettuce was wilted and brown. No avocado on the sandwich (it's literally in the name). Tater tots were soggy which I'll say the grub hub driver was late, but only took five minutes to get to me from the restaurant. So the restaurant let the food leave like this. the mozzarella sticks were disgusting. Like I'm still nauseous thinking about them disgusting. They were 90% breading 10% cheese. Breading was cold, crumbly, and burnt. The way the photo of them looks is exactly how they looked when I opened the box. They were untouched. So overall incredibly disappointed in this place. Only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is because grub hub is partially to blame.

I would usually come with my family for every special occasion but spending over $30 on food that you can easily go to a basic average buffet for is pretty ridiculous if you ask me. As well as constantly waiting in line for crab legs that come out every 20- 30 minutes. Until I hear of improvements, I won't be coming back. Atmosphere: Dining area definitely needs a spruce or update. Service: The service is great. I've never had a problem with a server. They are quick with taking away food and refilling waters and such.

I was at Dark Horse downstairs for most of the night and I had asked people around us where my crew should go next and they all said the Warren or 10High, if we didn't want to go to Buckhead. After I checked out 10High(which was awesome) my crew decided to go upstairs to check out The Warren. I didn't care too much about the cover charge since I had heard good things, so I hoped it was worth it. It wasn't. The bar/club was super dark, and wasn't crowded at all. The atmosphere felt like a middle school dance party in my mind. Guys lined up on the wall and girls just dancing around. I went to order a Bud Light and it was $12. I'm fine with paying expensive beer prices since I live in Manhattan but it was $8 more expensive than downstairs. When I asked about it to the bartender, they just shrugged and said it is what it is. In attempts to savage the somewhat underwhelming experience my crew decided to make the best of it and hit the dance floor. Unfortunately, the music was more of early 00s jams that you would hear at a wedding after party. Fun music but nothing you can really dance or get hyped to. We ended up just going to the room/bar that overlooked Dark Horse and that ended up being more of our vibe. Eventually we just left to check out some of the other bars. My crew still had a good time overall but The Warren ended up being our low point of the night. To put it shortly, The Warren City \\"Club\\" was just overpriced and underwhelming.

I've tried several of their coffee options and none of them have been good at all. In fact, I just threw my vanilla iced coffee away after a few sips because it had the overwhelming taste of chemicals. The food has never been good either. The omelets and build-your-own breakfast sandwiches come out nauseatingly greasy. Today, I ordered the Thai peanut salad with chicken. Instead, all I got was lettuce topped with spaghetti goop and regret that I paid for that. Sadly, this was my last time giving Highland Bakery chances.

Finally, my search was over!  MAD MEX is open and available!  It was my first time eating here, and the building/deco was quite trendy looking.We stood at the hostess stand for a good 5 minutes before anyone paid any attention to us.  Finally, someone took us to our booth.  I'm already disappointed; however, I was running out of options to find mexican food.  So, we sat down, and I ordered chicken tacos.  It's kind of hard to mess up chicken tacos.  There was no free chips and salsa, so we placed an order for one ($2.75).  The chips tasted pretty healthy, but it does not taste as good as the homemade chips from an authentic mexican restaurant.  The salsa was loaded with chunky tomatoes that did not have any flavor.  Overall, I would suggest skipping the chips and salsa and just wait for the food to arrive.After a short time of waiting, my tacos finally arrived.  There were 3 tacos filled with margarita marinated chicken, spicy cabbage slaw, sliced avocado, chopped cilantro, and roasted red pepper cream sauce.  The portion was rather huge and looked quite appetizing.  I took a huge bite into my first taco and realized that this dinner was not going to be a good one.  The taco with all the fillings was very sour.  The margarita chicken had too much lime; the spicy cabbage slaw was more pickled, and the red pepper cream sauce also tasted like too much lemon was in it.  I could barely finish the first taco.  The side items on the plate were rice and beans.  The beans were very unappetizing looking; basically a big blob of blackness in the corner.  The taste was pretty good, but it was hard to go beyond the presentation.  The rice was bland with no flavor.  The menu indicated that there should have been a side of fire-roasted tomato chipotle salsa, but never did find it!Overall, the experience was definitely not what I had in mind when I left the hotel searching for a mexican restaurant.

The east coast oysters are significantly larger in size, smooth in texture and taste. The Kumamoto is smaller and a heavy taste of the sea which is quite different and frankly, it was amazing! For appetizer, we were able to get the last crab cake which was obviously, a hot commodity. Like the oysters, the crab cake has a very clean, fresh taste and was just perfect for an appetizer.

For entrees both my husband and I were feeling brunchy, so we split the steak + eggs as well as the chicken fried steak. The steak and fried eggs was accompanied by a fresh chimmichurri as well as cheese pepper grits and bread. Y'all this Saturday special was EVERYTHING, as the chimmichurri was the perfect tangy addition to this breakfast staple. My only quib was that I could've had more chimmichurri and the grits were a little underwhelming but delicious none the less. The chicken fried steak was heaven with the perfect crispy texture and didn't leave you with any greasy feeling or taste. The non greasy is just a testament to Moonshine's fresh and locally sourced ingredients. I would certainly return to try more dishes as there were plenty of yummy to choose from."},{"name":"Virgo and Pisces Restaurant & Bar","address":"500 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Darn, it!  What can I say that hasn't been said?  It's clean, nicely decorated, mostly empty, and the food is so so.  The martinis aren't bad, and pretty good for the price at happy hour, which is the only time I go.  The fish and chips aren't what they used to be.  The fish was cut thicker, and had a better breading previously.  Now, it's kind of a sprinkle of cornmeal on some really small thin fillets of I'm not sure what kind of fish.  The fries could be great if they were crisp.  And dang it!  What's with the wasabi?  It's in the tartar sauce, the coleslaw, and the ceasar salad.  It's hard to stay away from the stuff.  Since I don't like it, I'm kinda stuck.  On the upside, I like the staff.  They try really hard.  I am giving an extra star for effort.  The brunch looks good, and I will most likely give it a shot since it's right down the street, and I haven't noticed any wasabi mentioned in the French toast.

It was 12 bucks and came in a small champagne glass and was filled with ice. It pretty much tasted like water, maybe carbonated water and had cucumber slices and mint all throughout it. Sure didn't have any hints of alcohol. My friends didn't love it either. Should have just ordered a water. The waiter let us know that our food would probably be awhile......but we probably waited 45 minutes at least. We all ate everything on our plates maybe bc we were starving but it was decent food but nothing I'm going to seek out and go back for. Our waiter was friendly and attentive.

After a long day of work, my party and I rushed to see the highly anticipated Avengers film. My party of 3 viewed the 11:15pm showing. We were super excited to have dinner and drinks at SMG and experience the Endgame after spending the last month marathoning all the MCU movies at home. We came to SMG about a week or two ago, but didn't order good. The service was a little bumpy (the servers and food runners are incredibly interruptive and loud and not at all \\"stealthy\\" like the service staff at AMC Fork & Dine) but I chalked that up to the place being new. All in all we were super excited about the concept and wanted this theater to be our new \\"place.\\" So we arrive and head to our seats. A server gets to us but only hands us one menu for a party of three. We're all awkwardly passing it around because we don't know what we want. She's just standing there waiting for us to decide but we've just arrived and we have one menu. Awkward, but whatever. I order the spiked macchiato and the server starts yelling to the kitchen through her radio. No one answers, and then she said they only have strawberry ice cream so they can't make any of the spiked shakes. Disappointing, but no problem! I'm flexible. So she takes our friend's order (separate check) and my boyfriend's mojito order and I tell her we need a few minutes to decide on food. She starts yelling through her mic \\"Please, I NEED someone to help me take orders in here!\\" I felt really bad that she was on her own in this theater. She told us that the kitchen and bar closes at midnight and that after midnight, we can't even get soda refills. Once we decide, we hit the button to order (it's still well before midnight, the time the kitchen and the bar closes.)  A different server appears. I order a strawberry milkshake (since I'm told it's the only ice cream in stock) and we get the 2 for $29 deal with nachos to share, a pizza, and a burger. My boyfriend also orders a soda. At least 20 minutes go by. My friend has his blue moon and burger and we have nothing. Eventually, someone brings cold nachos. We inform them that we didn't get our drinks yet. She scurries away, not even asking what we ordered. Someone else appears with a soda. We tell this runner that we're missing a mojito and a shake. She says \\"we have no milkshakes\\" and immediately walks off. Okay....Someone else comes and stands right in front of us \\"you ordered a water?\\" and I say no, we're still waiting on a shake and a mojito. She walks away. At this point, we also hadn't received our entrees but we figured the kitchen was backed up or something. The first girl who scurried away comes back at least an hour after I told her we didn't receive our drinks and asked if we have them now. I said \\"No. they never came and neither has our food.\\" She starts to leave and then says \\"well I can't get your drinks... bars closed\\" and at this point I just tell her to go away because this movie keeps getting interrupted for no one to be helpful or even try to rectify anything. Eventually, someone drops off the bill. We have been charged for every single item that never came. I'm just outraged now. It's offensive. I've spent over 3 hours in this theater and interacted with 5 different staff members just to get my dinner. I'm starving and I'm angry. This completely ruined the entire experience and our feelings toward SMG, a place we were so excited about. The movie ends and despite my numerous alerts to the staff, we never received a single drink ordered or entree. We spoke to Brian, a manager, and he seemed completely uninterested. He kept making the excuse \\"we just opened\\" and seemed more annoyed that I would complain than concerned at the situation. It's 2:30am and I still haven't had dinner. I would love to know how this could happen, our order was obviously put in the system if it was charged to us. Multiple people at the bar and kitchen had to decide to ignore our order. Our servers never ever followed up to ask how everything was or at least ensure we received our order. The 3 food/drink runners I told about the situation ran away, completely unwilling to help. I have to say, I've never had a worse experience in my entire life. It will take a lot for us to ever come back, which is such a shame because the food looks awesome and the place is really cool. My friend, who received his entire order without issue, said his burger was great. It's just disrespectful to treat guests this way. I am sympathetic to the people working here, because they so obviously haven't had proper training. I would highly recommend avoiding this place, or maybe making sure to go during earlier hours. Be prepared for runners and servers that completely block the movie and talk loud enough for you to hear them 3 rows away during the film. Hopefully they improve, but until then, skip this place and do AMC Dine In instead."},{"name":"Kabsah","address":"9436 S Orange Blossom Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Amazing!!

I still am- the dishes are fun and flavorful but it just felt like the chef was using fish sauce as a crutch for every dish. I understand that Portland is not the most diverse place so using fish sauce is gonna shock people and make it seem groundbreaking - but I really think it was missing other flavor profiles (funky, Spicy, Smokey, sweet). I hate to compare and I understand that the chefs are friends but Night+Market in LA uses fish sauce along with all of those other elements I mentioned. And the spice there is real spice and the prices affordable. I still highly recommend Pok Pok (this is me being nit picky) - and the Bloody Mary is GREAT.

It has amazing totchos and solid food and drink options. Today, we went for lunch. The bar was not packed, with only about 5 groups throughout the entire place. We were greeted by the host, who informed us that we could sit wherever we wanted. We decided to sit outside because it was a lovely spring day in Atlanta! The server came by after a couple of minutes to provide us with drink menus and glasses of water. However, it took them almost 15 minutes to come by and take our official order. One of my friends ordered a beer on draft, which took another 10 minutes to arrive. That was only the beginning. Two of our orders, we asked for lettuce wrap instead of a bread bun for our burgers/sandwiches, and confirmed with him again to make sure that he knew (dietary restrictions). After waiting over 40 minutes, we finally received our orders. The icing on the cake was that two out of three of our orders were wrong. When we asked him to fix it, he came by a minute later with a manager with the same plates and said that they couldn't put it on a lettuce wrap...why couldn't they have told us that when we placed our order? Our food was cold by the time we asked them to remove the bread and place the sandwiches on a bed of lettuce...no one apologized, no one tried to provide a solution to our challenges.

We had been hearing about this restaurant for quite some time from our best friend who typically holds a lot of work dinners there...I decided to book a reservation for 6 on Feb 9, 2019 at 9pm for my spouses birthday. I don't know if this had any bearing in our service but between the party we did bring (2) bottle of Beaux Freres Pinot and (2) bottles of Palmaz Brasa Cabernet. We asked for the server to please open and decant the bottles so they would have time to breath..After the waters came he opened the bottles and let them sit on the table...I then had to prompt him to actually decant the bottles so they would be ready to drink for dinner....After decanting he took our appetizer and salad course order of (2) orders of lobster fritters and various cobb salads...At this point other than having to prompt him on how to properly decant the wine, service was great but unfortunately after ordering these courses everything went down hill. Our appetizer course course came out within a very reasonable time with the salad course following it about 15-20 minutes later delivered by someone else other than our server...So at this point we had not seen our server since we placed the first order probably around 30 minutes earlier....This is where the service tanked. We had to pour our own wine almost the entire night, which is absolutely unacceptable considering we were paying a $20 corkage fee per bottle. Then after having the salad course delivered and waiting at least 20-30 minutes we literally had to get up and go ask another server to have our waiter come to our table so we could place our entree course order. Once he came back to the table he \\"thanked us\\" for our patience but regardless there is no time at this level of restaurant that a patron should be expected to serve their own table or have to ask other servers to get assistance. After placing our entree orders they arrived about 25 minutes later which is very reasonable...However when our steak for (2) arrived it was highly under cooked from the temperature we ordered. We placed a medium to medium rare order and it was delivered very rare/blue, ultimately the server  had to return it to to the kitchen to bring it up to proper temperature. Other than the temperature issue with the steak the overall \\"food\\" experience was above average in regards to taste & quality. Unfortunately in regards to the general table service, specifically our waiter and not the \\"busing\\" staff it feel absolute flat as well. For this level of restaurant and for the experience we paid for I feel that other than the food we could have received better service at the local IHOP. I would consider ourselves well traveled and we have eaten at many Michelin rated restaurants and other fine steakhouses and I can easily say this is the worse experience I have received from such an establishment. Unfortunately at this point there is no way I could conscientiously recommend Kevin Rathbun Steak to any friends or colleagues and I definitely wouldn't return because there seemed to be no concern at all last night from the waiter or staff about the experience which is unfortunate!"},{"name":"Arleta Library Bakery Cafe","address":"5513 SE 72nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Legit coffee cake!

The place has outside seating a a decent bar. Staff appears to be a little off tonight. Sitting at the bar and it appear to have a slow start. Bartender works a different shift. It appears that each wait person makes their own drinks from the bar so there is no one bartender servicing the main bar area. \\nWhen you sit at the bar there is a wait person that takes orders along side of you. Just a little different than I am use to I guess. But as we lifted the large margaritas in toast manor to the sky the evening began to take on a different form. Drinks were very good. Blender right before your eyes. \\nThe bathroom set up was located as soon as you walk in through the main door. They have no ventilation system that cools this area so it was very humid. If you walk in dry you will walk out sweaty. \\nThe food was basic Mexican dishes all prepared in traditional ways. Combos seem to be the best offer on the menu. Since I am a big fan of Sopa de Pollo I ordered one bowl. The avocados were sliced in chunks along with jalape√±os and onions mixed. It was good.  Again basic prep with traditional flavors.\\nThey have patio seating and a covered patio area. Best to get there right before sunset so the gaze from the sun can set you off into a subliminal mist.  Again. I did not indulge in the food but it's because I was in margarita mode. From what I saw from the locals everyone had a plate of refried beans and Spanish rice. I saw a lot of chicken plates and sizzling platters being served. Maybe next go round I can report on the food. But in the meantime try the bar experience.

The biggest table they had held 16. So they said. We were able to fit in an extra guest who showed up with a friend. I had to put down a $50 deposit but that came back as a credit the night of. I used that for the cake cutting fee ($2 a slice) and my meal. \\nA friend bought me a really cool zebra striped martini glass so I drank my drinks out of that until the server absconded with it. I panicked and popped into the kitchen to get it back. By then it was in the dishwasher. Luckily, I got it back. I didn't get my birthday cake platter back, but I'd gotten it from the Dollar Tree so it wasn't a big deal. I had asked the server to save me half my cake (to take home) and to just cut 10 very thin slices from the other half (7 people in our group didn't want cake). There was a miscommunication and it all got sliced up into fat pieces, but that was the only real snafu. Now, for the food. Wowza! Those of us who ordered the crab sliders, LOVED them!! The crab is deep fried and served on delicious potato rolls. They came with pickled ginger, jalape√±o and passion fruit cream cheese. My best friend ordered the WHOLE FRIED FISH. It came with jasmine rice & tortillas. she was a bit surprised about the head still being attached but ended up eating it all, including the eyeballs (her husband had one, she had the other) which was a dare. Another friend ordered the Wagyu steak fajitas. Something about it was dry so they sent it back and opted for something else. I'd have just slathered it with whatever sauce they had - but that's me. The friend across from me ordered an Asian chicken noodle platter. I don't see it on the online menu now but it was an option that night. It had some sort of hoisin-looking sauce and I know it didn't just look good because she ate it all and exclaimed that it was delicious. As for the atmosphere, \\"Tropical oasis\\" is a perfect description! Hanging plants everywhere gave it a jungle feel, so I turned my birthday dinner into to Jungle Love party, with each of us wearing floral or animal prints. I also brought animal masks, for one silly photo. Our group had 2 servers, both of whom did an excellent job keeping up with our drinks orders and getting all of our food out around the same time. They also let us use 4 credit cards and separated the checks so others could pay with cash, so there wasn't a bunch of confusion at the end.

They use a high quality Ciabatta style bread. I definitely recommend the Ed Abbey Sandwich made with poblanos peppers, caramelized onions and a really good chipotle aioli sauce. I also liked the Dante sandwich made with Prosciutto, Chevre and a great pesto  sauce. Don't forget to try their amazingly delicious fried donuts.

The restaurant does get 3 stars because there were components that were good, so we'll start there. The shrimp cocktail, crab cocktail and truffle fries were delicious! The corn/chickpea hash that came with the salmon was also on point. The problem came with the main dishes. I ordered the salmon (cooked medium). It was a bit on the rarer side, but still good. The real issue was with the peppercorn strip that my husband ordered medium and it came out so rare that it almost looked like he was eating ahi tuna. We aren't the type to send food back, so he sucked it up and was eating. We were minding our own business and the waitress came by and pointed out that the steak looked rare and asked if she could take it to have them cook it more. My husband stated that he only had 4-5 pieces left so no worries. Then the dark cloud came by, in the form of the manager, who the waitress had obviously sent. He yammered on about it being rare and how it was on him as long as we promised to come back. Which would have been all fine and good, except he was so pompous and condescending. A really irritating experience since we never complained in the first place. We even said that the gesture was completely unnecessary and we are happy to pay. We simply just aren't \\"those people\\". It was especially irritating because this was a special date night where we were going to see Nutcracker. We'd rather overlook little things and not make it a big deal. It also was frustrating because the tables are packed in so tight that others overheard the entire exchange and probably wrongly assumed that we complained, making us look like complete jackasses.

This is where I noticed my taste buds are either out of wack or they are trying to do too much here with the food cause there was so much I did not like as far as the flavors were concerned.

The corn beef hash was fairly standard but they give you a few choices of protein for their biscuit sliders - hash, pulled chicken or sausage.

She looked at it and said \\"you have a lot.\\" She was annoyed we were there. She asked if we would want to sit at a table close to the door and we explained a booth would be better for our daughter. She was so rude about the stroller, which we said we would be willing to park anywhere that she wanted us to! We weren't greeted by a waitress and when she came, she didn't explain anything and was also unwelcoming. The griddle controls are in another language, so we didn't know exactly how to turn the heat up, since the pancakes weren't cooking. The waitress should have explained it but she was too bothered we were there with kids to even fill my water.Speaking of water, when we got the batter you cook yourself on the griddle, I had to add some of my drinking water to it because it was so thick it wasn't coming out and the pancakes weren't cooking on the griddle.If you do go, here are some positive points, the bottles of pancake batter are $8 a piece and two fed my family of 4, but the kids only ate two pancakes. They don't charge extra for gluten free batter. They have a vegan and GF batter. If you are hungry, you can start cooking batter right away if the griddle is hot enough, which we couldn't turn up so the pancakes were cooking pretty slow for us, but you can make fun shapes. They have some good sides and toppings. We ordered 2 sides of bacon, it's about 1.25 per slice of bacon, not the worst price. But plainly, it was not fun for my family to eat there because the staff was just mean and hostile towards us the entire time. :( My kids were quiet, well behaved and handled the griddle fine. The other guests were smiling and admiring my kids, which as a mom, I know is not always expected, but the way we were greeted was pretty uncalled for! I wouldn't go back even without my kids. We were in town for hospital visits at Dornbecher for both my kids and because it was my daughter's birthday we thought getting to cook pancakes would be fun. Thankfully they are still young enough to be oblivious to everything adults do. Ugh.

Our menu changes seasonally, monthly or at whim. We do not serve staples like Phat Thai or Penang Curry, but the food we do serve is very accessible to most people. We use local product when possible and practical. We do not use MSG. While we are not specifically vegetarian friendly, all our vegetarian dishes are either vegan or can be made vegan, and there are usually about a half dozen of those on the menu.\\"  This \\"About us\\" pretty much says it all.The outdoor seating in the summer months is wonderful.  The wait can be quite long so they send you across the street to another local place to have a drink and they call the bartender when your table is ready.

And that's a wrong that needed to be righted.What really got me thinking about BK was the expectation of going here on the way home from a long day in Boston. The day turned into night and we weren't able to make the 10pm closing time. My Au Bon Pain turkey club was good, but it was no Brother's Kouzina Mousaka or Artichoke Fran√ßoise. Big bummer, people.I think we first came here after using Yelp to sift through the myriad options available on Route1. We wanted something a little different and we like the Greek chicken lemon rice soup (Avgolemono) that is rarely found anywhere. BK was perfect, perhaps our most important restaurant find.At first glance, the interior greets you like a standard but ultra-clean diner, but it is much more than that. Whether by design or accident, although there are plenty of windows, diners are led to focus inward on the warm and comfortable accommodations instead of the raging chaos of Route 1. The furnishings and layout are worth mentioning because they add to the experience: to the left is a large, standard table area with booths along the walls, and to the right is the nicely appointed bar as well as 10-12 high-rise, step-up booths. We love the booths, perhaps their height makes us feel special. The staff acts as one big, welcoming family...possibly because that is exactly what they are. We have a few kids and although I wouldn't describe the atmosphere as 'family' due to the classier set-up and also because of that description's sometimes negative connotation, it is definitely family friendly. And the food has been nothing but great...from the Mousaka and Pastichio all the way to the grilled salmon, every meal has been outstanding and the service exemplary. We love the Artichoke Fran√ßoise and have taken to ordering two of these apps as they never last long. Although this is a Greek restaurant, the menu touches on just about anything you may be in the mood for while managing not to be a massive crap-shoot of random options.If you find yourself slogging along Route 1N with a growling stomach, you owe it to yourself to try this place. Even if you find yourself along Route1S, it is worth making the turn and popping in here as well...but why qualify? It's worthwhile to go here no matter where you are! I have no doubt it will turn into a great option for you as well. If only they were 15 miles further north, the BK would not just be a fantastic way-station, but a bona fide destination for us.Brought to you with generous support from the Titanic Nut Company."},{"name":"Upper Crust Pizzeria","address":"68 Mall Rd","city":"Burlington","stars":"3","text":"Great 1st experience. 2 thin crust slices of the day and a drink for under 10$.

On my first visit to the city, I made sure to put it on my list. Enter Pok Pok on a Wednesday evening at 6:35pm. A table for 2 needs no wait; perfect. Unique, eclectic, and somehow cohesive is a good way to describe how I feel about Pok Pok's interior. The bathroom is inside the building, and can be a bit of a maze to get to. Gotta wash those hands before digging in though!Ike's fish sauce wings - Fried chicken wings that live up to the hype. Sticky, salty, crispy, delicious. I could probably eat an entire portion myself and call it a night. Wing bean salad - blanched wing beans sauteed with minced meat (pork?) and shrimp in a curry sauce. Crispy and interesting, but was quite salty. Kaeng Hang Leh (pork belly and shoulder curry) - saucy, unctuously melt in your mouth pieces of pork in a little clay pot. Definitely eat it with a side of rice, but maybe not coconut rice (see below). Coconut rice - For $3.50 a bowl, I was expecting white, fluffy, fragrant and moist coconut rice. Instead, I got dry, particulate rice with some brown bottom-of-the-rice-pot scrapes, and not the crispy yummy scrapes either. Color me disappointed. Pok pok affogato - Vietnamese coffee over condensed milk ice cream with patangko (fried, savory Thai style crullers). The crullers were laden with what tasted like old frying oil that was at too low a temperature. The ice cream didn't taste particularly like condensed milk and the Vietnamese coffee didn't taste very accurate either. I say this as a Vietnamese girl that drinks too much Vietnamese coffee for her own good. The cruller left an uninspired, stale and greasy taste in my mouth.

REALLY wish it had at least some of the drink selection of the OG location but in reality there's very little linking the two businesses. I found the restaurant awkward and a little uninviting as there's a crowd of locals around the bar that can be quite unruly and loud.I ordered a duck and soy chicken on rice with an iced milk tea which came to about $14. Not exactly cheap in my opinion and the portion itself was smaller than I was expecting from Milk & Sugar. I didn't think either of the meats were exceptional but given the late hours of operation I didn't expect that much either. I didn't find the meat as overly salty like HK BBQ master but it's not as meaty and flavourful as Tak Fook in Parker Place either.

Bf and I went there for dinner during the week. It was partially filled with patrons. The kitchen wasn't as busy as we thought it would be. No, nothing like Hell's Kitchen....the students were very calm.  Dinner consisted of a four course meal for $18. Bf and I both chose different dishes so we could try a variation of the cooking. Apps:\\nWinter squash soup - 1 star: tasted very watery and bland. \\nBacon and lentil fritters with smoked aioli - 1 star: also bland and no bacon flavor. \\nSalads:\\nWatercress, Beet salad - 2.5 stars: fresh and dressed perfectly with light balsamic vinegarette, but pistachios were burned. \\nFris√©e salad - 2 stars: the Parmesan reggiano overpowered the salad. \\nEntrees:\\nDuck confit bucatini - 4 stars: topped with foie gras yum! lots of duck meat and the bucatini was cooked perfectly. Huge portion with good flavor. \\nSeafood stew - 3 stars: good variety of cod fish, mussels, calamari and fried oyster...could use more seafood. \\nDesserts:\\nOCI Chocolate dream torte: 3.5 stars: decadent and a dark chocolate lover's dream come true. \\nApple tart with ice cream - 4 stars: the wonderful juxtaposition of warm and cold together with a delicious pie crust filled with apple filling topped with vanilla ice cream and caramel drizzle. \\nGreat presentation for both desserts. The students were great servers and we asked them some questions about cooking which they entertained. It was a good experience but definitely some hits and misses with the different dishes. We thought there would be a survey card at the end but there wasn't. Anyway, maybe they will read this as their appetizers do need some more work. The entree chefs were good but the pastry chefs really shined."},{"name":"Rocking Frog Cafe","address":"2511 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"A nice little coffee shop in a converted house.  Seating is cozy and welcoming - there's a front room with some big chairs and a coffee table, a natural wood side table in the entry nook.  There's another room lined with bookshelves, an ordering counter in the back, and another smaller room in the back with some more seating.Since it's a converted house, it's comfortable to camp out at a table and study or tap away at a laptop, and it's a bit of a throwback from the modern, more sterile shops that tend to be popping up.  It's the kind of place you could go and read a book and feel perfectly at home.Bike rack is hidden in the back (as well as a big patio area with picnic tables).Overall, a nice change of pace from most of the newer coffee shops, and one that I'll visit when I'm looking for a more intimate setting."},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I would say I ate THE BEST Sandwich I've ever had at Sam LaGrassa's.

Undeterred we went to the bar area, got a pamosa for my wife, a Bloody Mary for me, and sodas for our boys. The Bloody Mary was perfect... spicy but not to much so, refreshing, and good sized with a baby corn, olive, pepper, and a celery stalk. It hit the spot.About 45 mins into being here the buzzer for our table went off. That was a good thing because my boys were making plans to hijack the watermelon on the buffet table as it was.We were seated outside on the patio... it was a beautiful morning... and the patio was perfect. We met our server, gave him a drink order and then hit the buffets. I ordered a signature Manhattan... it was stupendous! They have 3 stations/buffet tables, 1 sweets, and two savory. We of course went straight for the sweets! Come on... it's Father's Day!I loaded up on the bread pudding, cranberry muffins, and a danish, my wife had the French toast and some fruit, while my boys destroyed the cinnamon rolls and the fruit. The bread pudding was phenomenal! Sweet, moist, and plentiful! I love a good bread pudding.Next we hit the egg station... here there are many interesting combinations: eggs with bacon and potato, chorizo eggs, spinach, peppers and eggs, and so on, but no worries... if you are like my boys... they will make just plain scrambled eggs even though they are not out here on the buffet... just ask. (The eggs are ok) However on this station is also the chicken fried steak fingers, the chicken tenders, and the chipotle gravy and biscuits.... ohhhhh my Goddie, the gravy, was so tooooo Hottie!! It was great on the chicken, the steak fingers or the biscuits. I'll bet it would have been good on the French toast, the salads, or just about anything! It was so fantastic... yum yum YUMMMM!The third station had sausage, candied yams, deviled eggs, and other savory treats... all of which were wonderful!

One of the good highlights of my dim sum order!The Shrimp Har Gow also smaller sized and imo the skin was thicker than Ming Bistro. This was okay. Shrimp Rice Paste was freshly made and delicious But small shrimps inside. The shrimp is fresh but small. The sweet soy sauce was good not overly sweet.Egg Tarts were Yummy and Delicious - Flaky light crust pastry and soft egg custard! This was the other good highlight of my dim sum order! Fried Taro were good but this was my first time eating these. It had a good \\"flavor\\" but not really a fan - Would not order again.

The ordering is a little confusing but between the three of us we got the Three item combo, which gave us extra mussels. We threw in corn and potatoes and had garlic noodles on the side. Little did I know the Louisiana sauce would have more garlic than the garlic noodles.You put on the bib. I wear the plastic gloves because I am unauthentic (and because I don't want my nails to smell like garlic for the rest of my life). You open the plastic bag and start choosing what you want to eat. We picked snow crabs, mussels, shrimp with the head on because apparently it's a thing to suck on the heads.

The first is that my wife and I ordered from them once. We ordered takeout in the restaurant, and waited close to 30 minutes. They were not busy, but we gave them the benefit of the doubt, and the food was good. We were happy.So last night, attempting to head this issue off, I called our order in. The guy on the phone said he was ready for our order, but I had to repeat it three times... whatever, it's fine. Said it would be 25 minutes. We arrived 25 minutes later and got in line. We waited almost 10 minutes and watched the two customers ahead of us walk out without being helped, (again, inside was not busy). We approached the counter and told the guy we called in our order. After searching, he said our order must have gotten lost and was not put in. This is unacceptable. This restaurant lost a minimum of 5 customers, (the two ahead of us were a couple with a baby and a lone man was the second, assuming he was only ordering for himself... which is doubtful). This is ridiculous. My wife and I had to find somewhere else to get our food, and this dumb problem added a pointless hiccup in our evening. The food might be good, but we've only been able to eat there once, and they don't seem to want to try very hard. If they keep losing customers this way, they won't last more than a year... maybe. They have one job, which is to make food for people. So far, they screw up this one thing 50% of the time.

We're the type to eat family style, and of course pasta can be a filling dish, so we ordered two appetizers to share and 3 pasta dishes, one that was suppose to feed 2 people (however I had this dish before and it can honestly feed 3-4, and that's my own personal experience/opinion, which was why we didn't order more). It's a small place, so the host and server were the same person. He said we weren't ordering enough food, then later came back and said we would leave hungry. Mind you, we were satisfyingly full. I think it's extremely rude to tell someone that they didn't order enough food. People go out to eat sometimes just for something light, regardless, we knew how much we were ordering and we did not leave hungry. This totally ruined our experience, considering we spent $250 for a meal that could've been so much better.

They have vegan, and vegetarian options as well as plenty of meat options. Turkey. Lamb. Wagyu beef to name a few. Hubby got the classic angus burger. I went with a duo. Crispy chicken covered in the buffalo sauce and a classic angus. The burger was dripping which is just how I like it and the buffalo chicken was a great recommendation from the young guy behind the counter. Kids had cheese burgers and chicken strips.

I ordered her teriyaki salmon and to be honest, I was disgusted with what they brought out. I have ordered teriyaki salmon from numerous restaurants and I always get the same thing. It's a salmon filet that's been grilled or even baked with a teriyaki sauce over it. But here at Sushi Sakura, it was almost as if they breaded scraps of salmon, deep fried it and put some sauce over it. It was overcooked and dried and reminded me of jerky. I had to dig through the breading to get to the salmon meat so my daughter could have something to eat. If you want sushi, maybe come here. But if you're wanting a teriyaki salmon bento, find somewhere else."},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Heard so many great things about Cafe Luna that we made this our Mother's Day brunch spot.  To sum it up, the food here definitely deserves all the press it's been getting.  On our visit, we had the pleasure of trying the following:- Cookie Monster waffle special:  A dessert served up as a breakfast/brunch entree special.  Delicious but very sweet.  Waffles were perfectly cooked.  My daughter had a smile from ear to ear while scarfing down each bite.  Warning though: I repeat, it is definitely more of a dessert than a entree item though.  Best to check your diet at the door before you consider ordering this concoction :)  5/5- Lobster Benny special: I'll admit I'm quite the lobster benny snob and this one of the best I've had in a while.  Plenty of lobster meat, eggs were poached perfectly and I loved how they also had avocados as one of the layers in between the English muffin and lobster.  Yummm!  5/5- Lemon ricotta pancakes special:  Sweet batter mix with special lemony taste topped with fresh mixed berries.  Vaguely reminded me of a certain lemon dessert available in Chinese bakeries.  Not too sweet but sweet enough with a nice lemon zest.  Would definitely order again.  4.5/5- Lobster & Avocado Omelet:  Omelet was cooked perfectly but had a little bit too much avocado when considering the avocado/lobster/egg ratios.   Good quality but not as tasty as the other dishes.  3.5/5Now for the only reason why it's not 5 stars - We'd made reservations over a month in advance for a party of 5 but when we arrived, it was basically a 4-top with an extra chair on one end.  This would've been fine except there really wasn't any space for it so my mom had to turn her chair sidewise to eat throughout our meal.   Yelpers were not kidding when they mentioned how cramped this place is.  Hindsight being 20/20, it's a great place to grab a quick brunch for a 2-top as service is fast and efficient but definitely not for larger parties and not on a holiday.  It's just not one of those places where you'd feel comfortable to hang out a while longer and enjoy a coffee afterwards.  There's a sea of other patrons waiting to jump into your seats right after you're done with your meal.  As long as you know that coming in though, you will love their food!"},{"name":"Slappy Cakes","address":"4246 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Congrats to Slappy Cakes for taking over the crown for most overrated restaurant in Portland. Waited for almost 90 minutes. Normally, I would associate this type of wait time with a large crowd, which there was. However, the horrendous wait time was due more to the wait staff being completely inept than it was anything else. Unfortunately typical of SE Portland, the owners seemed to have been more concerned with hiring a staff more for their hipster look than any actual talent or experience in service. For example, our server had a perfectly placed nose-ring, vintage cardigan, and tiny pig tails, but couldn't be bothered to get our drink order correct or provide anything close to prompt service. While the breakfast cocktails were very good (once they finally arrived), everything else was absolutely average, at best. The pancake batter tasted out-of-the-box, the ingredients were Safeway-esque and, the griddle was so luke warm that it took almost 10 minutes to cook each pancake. We ordered the pork belly Benedict and it was disappointing. White bread English muffin, with bland Hollandaise and a pinky-finger sized piece of pork. Fairly certain the potatoes were straight from the freezer. If you look at my reviews, I'm fairly generous with my compliments. However this place just has \\"GIMMICK\\" written all over it and does NOT deserve the praise shown here. If you're going to wait this long for food on Belmont, head down to Pine Street Biscuits, where the crowd and reputation for greatness is richly deserved.

People throw half the rice anyways so why make it so big. I didn't like how they refill the sashimi so slowly. They also take their sweet time refilling the oysters and crab legs but it's necessary b/c people waste food. It was a busy Saturday but they were refilling all the dishes too slow.They have a wide selection of other foods such as meats, vegetable dishes, noodles, and fried foods. They have a pretty good dessert selection including vanilla and green tea ice cream. They even have a crepe station.The staff was friendly and the place is very large.

The service is definitely a five. The food... a 3.5. I just want to rate the food, and given the restaurant's high score, I thought I'd skew down.What I had:\\n- Veggie Egg Rolls - this is an order of four, small, crispy vegetable SPRING rolls. I thought it would be a big egg roll, without the meat. They were fine, but there was virtually no veggies. But if you like crispy egg roll wrappers dipped in thin, sweet & sour sauce, go for it.Blue Crab Rangoo - the wontons were crispy and not oily, yay! The filling was good, but there was too much cream cheese for me. It overpowered most of the crab. Plus, it was a little runny and messy. Eh, I don't know that I'd get these again.Drunken Beef Noodle - Great! It was well seasoned, had a perfect balance of noodles, beef, and veggies. It was oilier than I typically enjoy, but I think it was flavored with a garlic-chili oil. I thought the serving size was appropriate for the price point.I think I'd try the General Tso's chicken and maybe another dish in the future, but it wasn't really exciting or impressive.

Either way it made my list of \\"Must go to's\\" next time I was in Portland. My sister, cousin, and I arrived at Pok Pok about 15 minutes before it opened at 11:30am on a Wednesday morning. We were one of the parties that first arrived, but the crowd grew longer in short time. When the doors opened, we all formed a single straight line to the host stand and were ushered to our tables accordingly. We were second in line, so the hostess had no issues with finding space for us. In fact the restaurant had a lot of seating areas including indoor and outdoor where we were situated. I really liked what Pok Pok was going for with the atmosphere and decor. The restaurant was very reminiscent of a casual, crude built restaurant found in SE Asia. What particularly gave me Asian street vendor vibes was the takeout kiosk in the outdoor patio of the restaurant and the communal style dining tables right next to it. Even the flies came out to play when our food came out. Can't get more a more authentic Asian experience than that! The customer service at Pok Pok was exceptional. I don't recall our waiter's name, but he was an Asian dude with a shaved head and tats. Such a nice guy! Super friendly and attentive. We had a secondary server, white guy with his hair tied back, who brought out each order. I swear he should be the host of a game show, because the way he gave us a rundown on every item we ordered made us feel like we won a prize. He thoroughly explained each order as it should be enjoyed (e.g. shredding the Thai basil, spritzing the lime, mixing this with that, etc.), thereby demonstrating the complexity of the flavors in every dish. Pok Pok's menu had a large variety of regionally inspired Vietnamese and Thai inspired dishes. The food was as good as it looked, and I loved everything we ordered. We had the Kai Yaang, Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings, and Khanom Jiin Naam Phrik. Major plus was that our food came out promptly. We got a half order of Kai Yaang, which was a roasted chicken. It was so flavorful with the lemongrass, garlic, pepper, and cilantro seasoning. The chicken was also moist and tender. It came with 2 delicious sauces: one was a spicy, sweet and sour and the other was tamarind. Per Pok Pok's recommendation, we got the sticky rice. Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings were amazing! I could really taste the fish sauce marinate, and the wings were crispy. We ordered the wings as spicy, but they weren't spicy to me at all, which was my only complaint. What's especially noteworthy of the wings was how big the pieces were. Typically a wing is broken off at the chicken's elbow, which essentially is only the forearm muscle you eat. A wing at Pok Pok includes the chicken's tricep and pectoral muscles, so you're getting the full sized wing. Lastly, we ordered Khanom Jiin Naam Phrik that consisted of prawns and a \\"gravy\\" made with coconut and split mung bean pur√©e. The richness and creaminess of the gravy provided a palette reprieve from the distinct flavors from the other dishes."},{"name":"Sushi Sakura","address":"506 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"This is the best revolving sushi place I've been to here in Portland.

Things that were odd was that they sort of watch you eat at different angles to make sure you're not sharing food. I also noticed that the lobster had strange residue on the shell which isn't a super big deal because you don't eat the shell - but it was pretty gross some said it was seaweed another said it was algae (workers).

Our server was way too intense - pushy about extra food, talking too fast, remained polite but sort of dismissive when we refused to order more than we wanted. And the selection here isn't great. All of us felt forced into decisions we weren't happy with since the menu seemed pretty limited. And we are easy to please!My chicken sandwich was very good, though not for the price. My sisters' salads were very small for entree portions and flavorless. The only one happy was Boyfriend, he got the steak fajita salad. It was sizeable, tasty, and healthy...ish.

The dish had minimal meat and the rice was bland. The pork egg rolls and beef lo mein were less than ok. We were not checked on to see if we were ok and the final straw was as we were eating a waitress came over gave us our check and a to go box. We were literally being kicked out.

They do, however, charge an extra $1 for gluten free...not sure why, since with sauces, its usually the difference between using soy sauce or tamari (which are the same price at HEB, last time I checked).We ordered the eggplant tofu and the general tso's tofu. We thought that both dishes were decent, but very one-note. Both tasted identical, there wasn't a lot of depth in flavor, and I thought they were both pretty bland for what I was expecting. Also, I included very specific delivery instructions in the \\"delivery notes\\" section, since I live in a Unit B behind the main house and our entry is off an alley.

FOOD::\\nComing to Nori Nori is a dream come true for anyone who loves QUANTITY. I love quality but I also ADORE stuffing my face with endless plates of food. I really feel like the options are endless at Nori Nori. You get your pick from sushi, nigiri, sashimi, seafood, hot dishes, grills and deserts. Because this place is a buffet, nothing is really spectacular. You can't come here expecting to get the type of sushi you would get at an actual sushi restaurant. However, I would still say what Nori Nori has to offer is above average and is still incredibly yummy. Personally, I come here to feast on the snow crabs. I was disappointed during my last visit two weeks ago when I noticed Nori Nori started steaming their snow crabs, instead of serving them cold. I was able to ask a worker to bring out plates of cold snow crabs which saved the night. Why steam the snow crabs? Steamed snow crabs aren't as juicy or flavorful and I would definitely not pay over $30 for that. Prices are not cheap at Nori Nori but they're understandable. I generally go on weekends and with tip and tax included, we'll pay around $82 for two people. SERVICE::\\nThere's really not much to say about the service at Nori Nori. It's a buffet so you don't get that much interaction with the staff. What I do appreciate is the staff's ability to quickly replenish all the food. I rarely ever come upon an empty plate. LOCATION::\\nLocated in Sandy Springs, Nori Nori is a ginormous restaurant. Even though they have lots of tables and seatings, sometimes you'll still have to wait because it is a popular restaurant. I don't believe they take reservations for small tables."},{"name":"Knight Moves Cafe","address":"1402 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4.5","text":"On a weeknight this place is sheer, cozy perfection, 5 stars.  On a weekend it's overcrowded, cramped and chaotic, 3 stars.  The game selection is surprisingly extensive for such a small place.  Every nook and cranny and spare surface is overflowing with games, literally floor to ceiling in some corners.  The interior is very homey and comfortable, with the classic brownstone decor and furnishing mostly preserved - the perfect cozy atmosphere to gather with friends around a table by the fire and play games into the evening.  The cafe counter is stuffed with enticing baked goods, snacks, and other treats.  They even blend up interesting milkshakes and serve up cheese boards and the like.  The byob policy is quite reasonable, with a $2/person corkage fee. I've always found the staff to be super accommodating and helpful; they move furniture around to seat groups of varying sizes and even help you get started with games if you're a group of novices.However, on weekends the place is much less enjoyable simply because of overcrowding.  It's clear they get all their business on the weekend nights, so I can't really blame the owners for squeezing as much as they can out of them, but when they let the place fill over capacity it really does negatively impact customers' experience.  The place gets so cramped it's hard to move around or access the games.  The staff have their hands so full they aren't available to help.  We had one particularly rowdy group crowd us out of an extra card table that had been set up for us; they really took over the space and made us want to leave early, which is pretty unfortunate considering we paid the flat entrance fee for the whole evening.

I offered to order for the 6th person so there would not be a delay.  While I understand the policy and why it exists, it does not make any sense to me why you would keep customers waiting by the front door, not being willing to seat them when the restaurant is literally empty.  Had it been busy in the restaurant tonight I would not be writing this review.  There were two occupied tables in the entire restaurant.  Isn't the entire point of this policy to keep the flow of customers moving?  Well, not being willing to seat us is not moving anyone along.

We just wanted to get drinks so sat at the mostly-empty bar in the \\"rum bar\\" upstairs section. It was early on a Friday evening, and the bartender helpfully explained the drinks to us. It was fun to watch him make them right in front of us, and the music and atmosphere were just right. We enjoyed our Compass & Black Velvet cocktails very much, and he even made a special mini drink with Jamaican rum, guava, and cinnamon for my birthday! This was amazinggg and I hope they put it on the regular menu.A few months later, I returned with a reservation on a Wednesday evening for dinner. We were seated in the downstairs dining area, which looks cute with greenery adorning a wall and an open kitchen. It was empty when we arrived a bit after 6pm but filled up in the 2+ hours we were there. We ordered 2 rounds of rum cocktails (I loved the Passion Fruit Daiquiri - fruity while not being overly sweet) and were pleased that a brown bag of long sweet plantain chips with an asparagus dipping sauce arrived at our table. The ideal pairing for tropical drinks.For our tapas, we ordered the chicken & mushroom pastelillos, meatballs in onion & guava sauce, and wild mushrooms & sweet potatoes. Our fave was by far the pastelillos. These Puerto Rican-style empanadas came out piping hot with melty cheese and a divine red dipping sauce.

The truffle aoli didn't over power it. \\nI also ordered the baked potato soup and side salad. The potato soup was hot fresh and full of big chunked potatoes. The side salad came with chick peas, not a fan of, but still a good size salad. The strawberry dressing was the best I've had and tasted so perfect with a salad. I also tasted the house vinegarette and it was good too, but I loved the strawberry! \\nI recommend asking for Taylor, she was awesome and helpful and prompt.\\nTheres lots of new and cool things on this strip. There is tons of parking behind the building Incase you didn't find a front spot.

I stopped in for take out one night, choosing Bobby's Classic Cheeseburger for myself and Bobby's Smokehouse Burger for J, and one order of fries for us to share.  You order the basics at the counter, and they give you a buzzer for your order.  They've got a toppings bar with different kinds of lettuce, tomato, pickles, banana peppers, sliced onion, chopped onion, ketchup, mustard, etc, including specialty sauces.  There's also an assortment of flavored salts/seasonings for the fries at the end of the register counter.While the variety of the toppings bar is good, it's somewhat annoying for take out orders... since I had to open each container and add the toppings, rather than being able to just package them while waiting for the burgers to cook.  And this is where my laziness prefers Five Guys - I tell them what toppings I want, and they put them on my burger for me.All that being said, it was a good burger.  I was particularly impressed by the bun, which was hearty and held up to the heapings of toppings that I added to my cheeseburger.  The meat was flavorful and moist.  The fries were ok, a little overcooked, and pretty bland.  Guess you need to add one of those seasonings!I'll eat in again, but probably won't get take out."},{"name":"Ceviche Tapas Bar & Restaurant","address":"125 W Church St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Ceviche is a tapas restaurant and bar located in historic Church Street Station. The restaurant has been reworked since its Phineas Phoggs days back in the 80/90s but it still shows the beautiful artistry used when Church Street was built. There is lovely woodwork, beams and brick that give the place a cozy charm.Food was good but mostly I LOVE the concept. You order 2-3 app sized dishes per person and share, a fun way to try lots of different items. Prices are in the $4-$12 range. Food comes out as it's ready so you eat one dish at a time which keeps you busy. A couple of favorites of mine were the scallop ceviche and the skewers which allowed us to try a little of the chicken, sirloin, chorizo and veggies.  Stay away from the Sangria; it was poured tabled side into a pitcher from a bottle that said, \\"Ceviche Sangria\\". Not sure what they put in their mix but it was barely drinkable. Stick to the bar drinks instead, both the Mojito and Cactus Flower were excellent.Between two people we ordered 5 dishes and were absolutely stuffed. Service was quick and helpful. The menu is large and a little overwhelming. Our server helped guide us and the options she suggested (one was the skewers) were a hit.

They were kind enough to halve the clam chowder and lobster roll for us since we were splitting everything. Everything tasted delicious, even the wedge salad. We were stuffed at the end of the night and passed on dessert, but our server was insistent we have something and brought us little complimentary almond blondie bites.

Being right off 12th Street, if you like to sit outdoors it can be a little noisy, but there's ample seating available always. The food is pub grub, but I've always enjoyed everything I've eaten. They have a great happy hour, where you can get 3 tacos starting at for $2.50, with a variety of options like adding sour cream or subbing chicken for an additional cost. They have a pretty large menu too, so if you want pizza, they even serve that!  It can get pretty difficult to make a decision, so fair warning!

But we spent a majority of our time in the purple room right there in the spirituality section (yoga especially).  We were specifically looking for certain topics and couldn't quite find what we wanted amongst the 80+ yoga books.  So, of course I went right to the desk at the top of the purple room stairs and the woman who helped was insanely quick.  Not only did she step out from behind the desk and show me the section I was hoping to look in, she tried to dig through the shelves to help us find what we wanted (after getting several author's names from her).  We couldn't find either one even though they were in stock!  But she helped us find similar books...on two different occasions.  She came back and gave me a 10% off coupon for having to wait and I was floored because I was nothing but thankful for her help.  It's clear that Powell's is BIG into customer service.  That alone makes me want to live in that store amongst those shelves.  Their new books at lower prices sections scattered throughout the store were another one of our favorite spots.  We found several books for less than $10!  We actually went came in to Powell's twice during our trip.  Both times we sat in their Brown Room cafe.  The World Cup Roasters coffee was by far our favorite we had in Portland...more so than Stumptown Roasters.  The mocha and cappuccinos we ordered were not too strong and brewed to perfection.  I do agree that they need a few more tables and chairs though.  But we chose to sit up against the window to watch the Pearl District and enjoy more of Portland.  Before we left, we did buy ourselves a bag of the Bookworm blend and have had it several times since coming back home to Arizona.

The gyro was about average but when you have it with the falafel, your taste buds will be thanking you. The service was quick too, I had three orders in front of me and it only took roughly 10 minutes for my order to come out.  The only downside is parking in the plaza is limited.

Pupusas are still the best in the area and So are the hand made tortillas and I would still go back there just for the food but be aware of the awful customer service. The pupusas are still more expensive than anywhere else but, they are still better than anywhere else. No sure if its a family owned restaurant but I think it is which you would imagine it would be cozy and friendly but they are just rude. The other day I went there and took some friends for the first time bragging about their pupusas. The waitress sat us and served us, it was a girl a never saw before and the restaurant was really busy. When we got the check (which, by the way, they include the gratuity, even for parties with less than 6 ppl) she told us the credit card machine was not working. I asked if it just stopped working and she confirmed it wasn't working since morning. Like, what about telling us before hand and let us decide if we wanna stay or not? We didnt have cash and I asked to talk to her supervisor. I was nice about it and told her I am a regular which, she knows since she knows what I want when she serves me, she rolled her eyes and told me that there was an atm machine across the street. I wasnt looking for a free meal, just an apology and for her to address her employee on how to hand these types of situations before hand. I felt robbed because I wasnt given the option to choose.

When my order was up, I sat at one of the three (yes, just three) tables that they have. When I tried to raise one of my sandwich halves to my mouth, a cascade of mysterious tiny items fell from it. Thoroughly confused, I opened the sandwich to examine the pieces that remained. They looked about the size of shredded cheese pieces, but the texture was crunchy rather than soft. The only thing I could figure is that they had put old shredded cheese on my sandwich that had failed to melt. Finding this highly undesirable,  I brought it back to the counter for a redo.  The lady told me those were potato chips. This was very odd, because A-I've never seen chips that tiny, and B-Who puts chips on a sandwich? Plus I've eaten a few Cuban sandwiches in my life and have never had to ask them to hold the chips. The remade sandwich was mediocre at best despite the missing chip fragments.

I started with their Moonshine Mule that was just OK.  We followed with the Shrimp Corn Dog appetizer which was very good (it helps that I like corn dogs).For my main I ordered the blackened catfish and it was excellent - perhaps the best entree I had in our two weeks in Texas.  The much touted corn bread was solid.  The fried chicken sandwich was good but nothing special.But what was special was the decadent and tasty banana pudding - we loved it.

We also ordered a gravy covered biscuit to try out. The portion sizes here are gigantic....we ordered based on our hunger level and should have ordered one plate to share.  That being said, the food is amazing and we both ate way more than we should have.  Each pancake is as big as your face, and the biscuit is on steroids.  The food was a little slow coming out of the kitchen today, but the wait staff was very attentive and apologetic.  Last time we were here, I had the chicken fried steak and eggs, and my husband had the fried catfish plate.  Neither disappointed and both, again, were way more food than one person should ever eat.

This may have been because of the frakking cute coffee, but I think it was because there was a band there. I heard them play the Rolling Stones' \\"Dead Flowers\\". They were a full contigent and shockingly knew to play at a respectable volume, even with a drum set (and were not playing jazz or folk music). xxxooo Extra Cute! oooxxxI never come over to this part of town, because I don't know anybody on this side of 35 at the moment except for the guy who cuts my hair, and he's usually busy cutting hair.

Even although it was the happy hour wine Kathy topped up our wine during dinner.  We shared an appetizer of maple walnut prawns.  They were amazing.  There were 5 good sized prawns that were fried in a tempura batter and then they were glazed with a maple sauce & served on toasted walnuts and sesame seeds.  We asked for an order of garlic bread to go with our appetizer.  What a wonderful start to our meal.  My husband paid an additional fee and had the sablefish.  It was so good - perfectly cooked.  The fish itself was melt in your mouth tender but the skin was really nice and crisp.  I had seafood linguine in a pesto, sun dried tomato cream sauce.  It had 4 perfectly cooked mussels, 2 good sized prawns and a generous amount of salmon.  The pasta itself was also very well cooked - al dente.  It was a pretty good sized portion and I couldn't finish the whole dish.  For dessert we had a chocolate hazelnut cr√®me brulee.  It was an absolutely wonderful meal and we enjoyed ourselves so much.It's a lovely room.  I would not go for a romantic evening as it is a bit loud.

But this all changed when we seen how this hotel tries to charge you for everything humanly possible as a extra. The room was not much different than a holiday inn Express except for the 400 dollar a night price tag. If that wasn't enough they charge you for towels at the pool 35 dollars a day. Did I forget to mention that it's also 30 dollars a day to park at a lot that's almost a half mile from your room. I honestly thought that 400 dollars a night would mean that this experience would be top notch but soon found out it's just the beginning of what seemed to be neverending can I see your credit card again! This literally drove me crazy and would never stay at this hotel chain ever again! Ps stay away from the room service I ordered my 6 year old son a glass of milk before bed on the first night which the menu said 4 dollars but when I noticed the small print there's a 5 dollar delivery charge which made this milk 9 dollars and did I forget to mention it came in a shot glass and I'm not exaggerating at all my son finished it in 3 swallows did I say he's only 6?!

This morning someone was so tired of waiting for their cup of coffee that they snatched mine and ran off, which meant it took even longer.  Most DD's I go to will make the coffee right when you order it if coffee is all you got, but this one puts the order in the queue so you have to wait for everyone else's sandwiches to get made. Then they call out you order \\"Large coffee\\" -- nothing else -- and so everyone who got a large coffee tries to take it. There's also one lady working who (I usually can't understand, and) invariably yells at me for doing something wrong.. such as reaching for a coffee that isn't mine because she only called out \\"Large coffee.\\"  I've been here multiple times even though every time I go I swear it's the last time. Somehow I think that the next time will be better than the last. Wrong. It's always worse than the last time.

The rep seemed a bit annoyed while at the same time trying her best to be helpful.I purchased a pack of Macarons that were hand-selected for the day, it was an assorted bunch with 6 macarons. As I walked through the mall, an employee in Macy's talked about how \\"legit\\" my macarons were because the owner is actually from Paris, that made me even more excited to taste them.After finally getting to my car and having a chance to open the cute little package, I pulled out the lemon Macaron because in the past that has been one of my favorite flavors from other bakers.The Macaron's are perfectly textured and flavored to please, I couldn't have been more impressed. Macaron Queen has the best Macaron's I've tasted thus far, I highly recommend the Macaron Queen, I believe it may be the closes you'll get to Paris Macaron's without going to Paris. ~XOXO\\n~Stacy"},{"name":"Zaza's Cuban Cafe","address":"1 Jeff Fuqua Blvd, Airside 1, Gates 10-19","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Great coffee, fast and friendly service.

So the Shrimp Corndog....Neither me nor my wife can understand why this item would be such a hit. Kind of a soggy tasteless shrimp deep fried in a pretty tasteless batter. Chicken fried steak... great portion size. Decent quality meat. Again, batter didn't have much flavor. Our waiter sold it as \\"voted top three in the state\\". I can't imagine that it would be in the top 20 in a legit competition.

Chicken tacos are usually so blah, but this had TONS of flavor, and I was happy I had them take out the grilled jalapenos cuz it was already very spicy. I would definitely order this again, and there was like a whole chicken breast in there.The migas taco was pretty good too, avocado is a nice addition to the standard. I would order again.This place is very busy. Oh, and the rose designs on the wall are beautiful.UPDATE: Do not get these tacos to go. After 15 mins in the car the flour tortillas were half mush. I didn't really enjoy the Trashy Trailer Park taco because it was like ALL goo once you add queso to an already big pile of cheese.

Try the wings!Opened June 13th 2019.Shares the same parking lot with a few other businesses. Limited up front parking but there is plenty of space.Dining area is spacious and clean. Nice open concept. There is bar seating alongside the register. Music playing in the background that breaks silence but is easily drowned out with conversation.Menu is pretty self explanatory and there are plenty of pictures. There are a LOT of different ways to customize your burger. The beer on tap is a plus! This is a good place to buy good burgers in bulk. Check out their family and party boxes! They have a nice variety of salads as well.There are two registers, thus two order lines can form--a slight problem for the table right next door as far as personal space goes.Service: order and pay at the register, seat yourself, you will be handed a cup if you got a drink (fountain is to the left of the register in the back hall), your name will be called and food brought to you. Your table will be bused as you dine and when you're done there is a trash and tray shelf near the front door.Sweet Crunchy Chili Garlic Sauce Wings: yum!Sweet, sour and has a slight kick that goes away with a few sips of soda. The wing itself was cooked really well and had that juicy texture. Fairly good sized wings as well, not your typical tiny sorry excuse for a wing that other places give you. The 6 piece wings are pretty filling, especially if you get fries as well.Angus Beef Burger: toppings were very fresh and crisp. Burger itself was slightly on the dry side but still tasted great. Condiments are located next to the drink fountain to the left of the register. Love the sesame bun! Overall this burger tasted healthier to me than most other places--not overly flavored and dripping in juices. I would almost equate it to a sandwich.Regular Fries: not your typical shoestring cut--they are medallions. They are soft and slightly crispy with a slight chew to them. The best thing is that they are not oil soaked. Lightly salted. These fries are one of those food items that really depend on you personal preference. I like them because they aren't as oily and lightly salted. Some places have fries that are so salty that you can see the water leave your veins--that's not a problem here! That being said, they could use a teeny bit more salt--but that's just personal preference for me.Sweet Potato Fries: shoestring cut and lightly salted. Soft on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside. Nice to snack on and not feel guilty about."},{"name":"Dunkin'","address":"1421 S Narcoossee Rd","city":"Saint Cloud","stars":"1.5","text":"Two stars for a Dunkin' Donuts in Lake Nona that can't seem to get it together.

I got the full developing-world experience in PDX, flies, dirt and all. If you come from another foodie city like SF, feel free to skip this \\"must-try\\". There was nothing special about this place. We (my friend and I) went around 2pm so there was no line, and plenty of tables open. We were told that if we wanted to sit at a table, it would be 30 minutes, but if we wanted to sit at a bar, we would only wait 15 minutes. Wait, there were plenty of tables open, why would we still have to wait? That made no sense, but wee said bar because we didn't want to wait. While we waited to be seated at the bar, a table for 2 opened up, so we chose to sit at the table.Sitting at a table meant we sat outside....oh boy......Sitting on the patio means that you are surrounded by flies. Flies that tried to land on you, your stuff, your food, your plate, your cup, just everything. No matter how much you tried to swat them away, they would come back. It truly felt like I was in a developing nation, but I was not paying developing nation prices for my food. I am all about trying to make the experience as authentic as possible, but I didn't think it meant having dirty dishes and insects. We ordered:\\n1. Shrimp clay pot \\n2. Fish sauce wings\\n3. Mango Sticky Rice\\n4. Thai tea\\n5. Pineapple drinking vinegarWhen our server came around, she wasn't very friendly. She dropped a mini plate of spicy peanuts on our table and asked if we were ready to order. We had never been there before and told her as much, but she didn't try to explain any of the dishes. As a result, I turned to my trusty Yelp app. My friend said her Thai tea, that came from a Pok Pok bottle tasted good. I tried to the pineapple flavored drinking vinegar because it was also a Pok Pok thing to do. It was interesting and different. Not necessarily something I feel the need to order again. If you do order it, really mix it all up. Apparently the fish sauce wings were a must. It was 6 wings for around $15-16. Not developing nation prices. They were ok. Nothing extraordinary. I did have high hopes because everybody was really hyping up the wings. You could have gotten better wings at any other KFC (Korean fried chicken) place. The shrimp clay pot, which I believe was around the same price as the wings, had 4 shrimp, clear noodles, and 4 very thin, very small pieces of pork belly. The dish had NO FLAVOR. I expected flavor town, but got bland town instead. The mango sticky rice was also very cold. Normally at any other Thai restaurant, the rice comes out somewhat warm. It was $7 for a pretty small portion of rice and mango. This place was by far the biggest letdown food-wise in Portland. I expected the place to blow my mind. When I spoke with my tour guide and told him how I was unimpressed with Pok Pok, he was like yeah, sadly the place has gone downhill. It is no longer the place it used to be. There you have it. Based on my experience, I cannot recommend this place."},{"name":"Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya","address":"11830 NW Cedar Falls Dr, Ste 128","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Á¢∫ÂÆü„Å´Âë≥„Çí‰∏ä„Åí„Å¶„ÅÑ„ÇãÔøΩ?Âàù„ÇÅ„Å¶Ë®™„Çå„Åü„ÅÆ„ÅØ2Âπ¥„Åª„Å©„Åæ„ÅàÔøΩ?„Çπ„Éº„Éó„ÅØÁ∑©„Åè„ÄÅÈ∫∫„ÅØËåπ„Åß„Åô„Åé„ÅüÊÑü„Åå„ÅÇ„Å£„ÅüÔøΩ?„Åó„Åã„Åó„Åì„ÅìÊúÄËøë„ÄÅ„Åù„ÅÜ„ÅÑ„Å£„ÅüÊó•Êú¨„ÅÆ„É©„Éº„É°„É≥Â±ã„Åå„Åì„Å†„Çè„Çã„Éù„Ç§„É≥„Éà„Çí„Åç„Å°„Çì„Å®Êäë„ÅàÂßã„ÇÅ„Åü„ÅÆ„Åã„ÄÅÊ†ºÊÆµ„Å´ÁæéÂë≥„Åó„Åè„Å™„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„ÄÇÂîêÊèö„Åí„ÇÑ„Çµ„Ç§„Éâ„ÇÇ„Ç¢„É°„É™„Ç´„Å™„Çâ„Åß„ÅØ„ÅÆÂ§ßÂë≥„Åß„Ç¨„Éº„É™„ÉÉ„ÇØ„ÅåÂäπ„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Åå„ÄÅ„Åì„Å°„Çâ„Å´‰Ωè„ÇÄÊó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆ„Éõ„Éº„É†„Ç∑„ÉÉ„ÇØÈò≤Ê≠¢„Å´‰∏ÄÂΩπË≤∑„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Åì„Å®„ÅØÈñìÈÅï„ÅÑ„Å™„ÅÑÔøΩ?,2019-07-14 14:55:16\\njze6VTeUWnjxNAMZytrjKA,Chick-fil-A,3410 Camp Creek Pkwy,GA,Atlanta,30344,33.6563899,-84.50170200000001,3.0,88,1,Caterers"},{"name":"Studio Movie Grill","address":"3204 Margaritaville Blvd","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3","text":"I have been to this theater 4 times now since they opened not too long ago.

This place has some amazing Japanese foodWe ordered a bunch of items to share from the happy hour and then had a bowl of ramen each. I ordered the miso ramen wich was very flavorful and delicious. There were small bites of minced meat, and the broth was to the top of the bowl. Presentation was wonderful,  and I will definitely order this again. The karaage chicken was very delicious as well. Reminded me of the karaage in Japan. The sushi, while simple, tasted very fresh.The reason for docking 2 stars is this...The happy hour was weird. One side of the restaurant had it, the other didn't. I didn't understand. Wasn't a huge deal but it was odd to me.One issue we had was with the toro ushi. I've always wanted to try toro as I've heard it's very delicious, and Saburos restaurant never has it available. I ordered Toro at market price, which was $10 that day (It's around $6 in Japan but hey). My mother was telling me that toro is so good, very popular in Japan and that it melts in your mouth. I was excited to try it out.After taking a bite with a smile on my face, that smile soon disappeared as it was very chewy, stringy, and hard to eat. I would have preferred salmon over this. I asked my mom to try the other piece, and told her that it wasn't very good at all. She tried a very tiny piece of the toro, smelt it, and could already tell something was up. It was either the wrong cut of tuna, or a bad piece of the fish. I think they may have thought we didn't know our sushi and tried to rip us off. Too bad my mother's family used to own a sushi restaurant.We told the waiter and he kindly took it back, but after that he seemed real quiet for the rest of the night. He even came back once and asked us if we didn't want the toro at all, or the chef said \\"he could give us a better cut of toro.\\" For not getting offered a good cut to begin with, it was a bit insulting. We declined that offer.Everything else besides the toro was great. I would recommend definitely the karaage and the bo gyoza is a must. Good happy hour beer as well."},{"name":"PIZZAFIRE","address":"804 Town Blvd, Unit A 1040","city":"Brookhaven","stars":"3.5","text":"Had a wonderful experience!

We brought our young children and that seemed to thrill them, which was sweet.  My daughter wanted juice and the only option was mango- it was delicious and she has requested it for breakfast every day since.\\nOur salads were wonderful and the typical peanut dressing was the best I have ever had.  We started with some Thai chicken wings- and they really weren't good.  They were the sad, bony and crunchy kind of deep fried wings you might see at the end of the night at a bad bar.  They came with dipping sauce (which I didn't like) but didn't appear to have any on the wings themselves.\\nThe kids had fried rice and I can honestly say it was some of the best fried rice I've ever had.  It had that deep grilled flavor and the rice was perfectly cooked.  My husband's spicy noodle dish was also to die for - my fork spent a lot of time on his plate.\\nI ordered the panang curry and the flavors were balanced just so.\\nWe were feeling gluttonous and ordered the Thai donuts- and woah!

And everything--sweet or savory, it didn't matter--was all packed in the same bag! So my cinnamon roll smelled like sausage. Ugh. Out of all the klobasniki we tried, the Ham & Swiss was the clear winner (it's also the most expensive).

The salmon burrito is definitely good, but I've been disappointed to see that the size of it has gotten smaller over the past few times I've been here. The burrito is a little overpriced considering how much they actually put inside it. I feel like getting an Alaskan roll with spicy mayo on the side would've been more worth my money, but I just like the idea of eating a sushi burrito.

Grilled octopus was about the best dish we had. Also ordered the sashimi...very ceviche-like...wasn't bad. Service was very poor! Ordered drinks and waited forever...it was busy, so okay, I get it.  When we finally received our drinks, the waiter served us a chipped glass with his fingers on the rim of the glass!! Then, after we were half way done with drinks, we got bread.  No bread plates, just bread in a basket. A new table sat next to us, and we overheard the waiter call them a disparaging name as he walked back into the restaurant from the patio.

Now to the positive, chips were brought right away; manager was going table to table helping out in different ways; excellent ambience; clean and spacious; and by far the best mariachi band I have seen - 6 piece and excellent vocals. My husband's entree was excellent - chicken chimichanga mixture of white and dark meat and rice was super good. I clearly ordered the wrong thing and was deeply disappointed.

I love how you can walk all the way around the cashier, treats on display, menu, etc. There's also a ton of windows so you can easily peak out on the street. The windows provided a great deal of natural light. It was all really cozy and inviting. On top of all that, there were ample amounts of seating and yes, of course there was an open area where you could view into the bakery. It's always super fun being able to see the masters of deliciousness hard at work. After gawking at all the lovely pastries and goodies, I decided on ordering a blueberry scone and a chocolate chip cookie for later. My sister ordered the egg sandwich and it came out very quickly.  I could see all of the gooey cheese and it looked fantastic! She loved it! I however, had recently eaten lunch so I stuck with dessert. The blueberry scone was heavenly! There were so many blueberries; you never went a single bite without having a giant blueberry burst with flavor in your mouth. The sugar baked on top gave it good texture and the entire thing was moist and to-die-for! The chocolate chip cookie was baked wonderfully.

Also, CASH only, but there are several nearby ATMs.We were a group of 6, a few of us got the aglio olio pasta, which was squid ink pasta with garlic and octopus. It was divine. They serve it in the same fry pan they use to cook it. I basically licked the plate. And we got calamari appetizer which was simply calamari but it was perfectly fried and tasty as all else. Another friend got the haddock which was awesome and probably a healthier choice than the pasta dishes. This place is not a fancy place (I mean they serve wine in plastic cups), but my understanding is that they catch their fish daily, and the flavor reflects that.Parking in the north end is a pain so I recommend ubering or walking here.

In fact, my wife couldn't finish it so I gladly helped.I had ordered the \\"smash\\", spicy pork meatballs with an optional egg on top, on a ciabatta roll.  This one was just packed with flavor, really excellent!  The only thing I don't care for when ordering the sandwich is that you don't get a side; the sandwich bread is considered your side I guess.  It was lucky that my wife couldn't finish hers, because I was left wanting a little more after eating the sandwich.  Had I known this at the time I would probably have ordered an extra side. Then again, that puts the price point for a single meal a bit higher than I'd want it to be.So from now on I'll probably stick to the regular meals and avoid the Smash.The owners are friendly and seem to be big on customer interaction, so if you're a big fan of people paying attention to you, you'll feel right at home here.There's currently a check-in deal for a free cannoli with meal purchase, but when I'm trying to get a solid feel for a place, I don't like alerting them to the fact that I'm on Yelp. On subsequent visits I'll redeem the offers, but before I write a review I don't want a business treating me like they know they're about to be reviewed.To their credit, I don't feel like there would have been much of a difference.

Also, there is plenty of seating, they really make use of all the space they have. They also refill their dishes fairly fast too, I rarely saw people waiting for them to refill a plate.The food selection is pretty good. I initially thought it was only going to be a sushi buffet and was sort of worried about getting too full on the first 2 plates, because let's face it...that's a lot of sushiO_Olol But thankfully, there was a big variety of seafood dishes, hot and cold to choose from. from crab legs and crab cakes to pork/shrimp shumai and teriyaki balls. they also have a crepe station on the side near the dessert aisle. the selection is awesome and the food was good, not exactly phenomenal, but there were definitely certain dishes that I did end up liking more than others.

I was split between that and the Honey Vanilla, but the barista convinced me by telling me they're the only ones making a lavender drink.

Don't get me wrong, KFC has a time and a place, but there are better options for chicken. Like Boom Beer for starters. There are a few Korean Chicken style places around town, and Boom Beer maybe the one that's the most obscure. If you don't know what you are looking for, you will walk right by the place since it just blends right in. It doesn't help that the sign is in Korean with the only English word being Cafe. If you need better directions, it is lodged between K-Town BBQ and Domino's Pizza. For those that may be unfamiliar with what to expect with Korean chicken, the best way to sum it up is like comparing McDonald's burgers to a burger joint like Vera's or 5 Guys. Basically you are getting fresh, juicy, piping hot fried chicken versus chicken that has been sitting under a heating element for a few hours. Of course, it is served with a Korean twist. Now, chicken and beer is at this point pretty much a Korean staple. If you visit Korea, every neighborhood has a few chicken and Hof places that people will order from with alarming frequency. You might be saying to yourself, I know what chicken is, but what the heck is Hof? I asked myself the same question during my trip to Korea last year. As it turns out, Hof is synonymous with beer in Korea. Putting two and two together shows that Hof (perhaps the name of a brewery or region in Germany) became something of an adopted term for beer in Korea. On to the restaurant. There really isn't anything special to write about when it comes to the atmosphere for this place. It is, however, clean and the hardwood bench along the wall provides a nice accent to the rest of the decor. See if you can spot the multiple chicken statuettes around the restaurant. The music that plays is of the Kpop variety, and most of the songs I heard there were at least a couple years old. I figure that when it is busy, it just sort of fades away into the background. We went during the daytime, just before 6pm on a Friday, and we were the only ones there. Service was prompt, and the lady was friendly. She does speak English, so not to worry there if you don't speak Korean. The menu has English written on it in smaller print, but it is there. We ended up ordering a half dish of regular fried chicken, and the cheese fire (direct translation, it's a bit spicy) chicken. Oh where do I begin. The spicy cheese chicken comes piping hot and the cheese is just starting to melt on top of the red pepper paste marinade sauce. I can't do it justice in trying to explaining it other than it is a perfect combination of sweet, spicy and savory. The chicken comes on top of Korean rice cakes () and it just works. Make sure you stir it up and mix it around for maximum flavor. The regular fried chicken may just be the best fried chicken you've never had. It is cooked fresh, it is crispy, flaky and super juicy. It's also really tasty. On top of that it isn't really greasy either like other fried chicken. A quick wash of your hands wipes away any grease and smell. This is a big plus and difference when compared to fast food chains. I didn't have a beer, but the coke I did have was super cold so it came very chilled with the \\"frozen foam\\" on top. I can only imagine their beer is the same. The only side dish that you get are freshly diced radish cubes in a sort of sweet/vinegar sauce. It compliments the chicken nicely. The regular fried chicken comes with some coleslaw, except instead of a mayo base sauce, it is topped with ketchup. It too, is ok. The prices may be a little higher than what you would expect to pay for fried chicken, but it is quite the norm for Korean fried chicken.  Dishes range from $10 for a half order to around $20 for a full serving. My brother and I racked up a $54 between the two of us with the stupid amount of chicken we ate. It was worth it. All in all, the chicken is fresh, tasty and just all around fantastic. Chicken lovers, you would be doing yourself a disfavor by not checking this place out and trying the amazing poultry they have to offer."},{"name":"Taste of Peru","address":"9521 S Orange Blossom Trl, Ste 117 A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Firstly, I have been to Peru before and consumed dishes from said country.

We were the only ones in the very small dining room. We asked if they were open and he seated us. Not friendly just did his job. When ordering tea he described the tea as \\"regular hot tea\\". I asked what that means and he told me \\"it's brown\\". Okay... so don't ask too many questions.The lack of friendliness and the fact that they currently use their sushi bar area as an extra shelf (phone books and old boxes stored around it) tells anyone that their main focus is take-out orders. If you have the patience to get over this - the sushi is actually very good. We always get the sushi and have never had complaints. They have a good selection of fusion rolls that come with about 6-8 pieces. This time we got the North Beach Roll which is a California roll topped with baked salmon & spicy mayo. It was very good and I liked that they didn't smother it with spicy mayo. Aloha is a good place to go is you want sushi that isn't all dressed up with condiments and crazy extras. The rolls are good quality and contain a good amount of fish. Don't go for the atmosphere or the customer experience.

We came at a strange time of day, around 3:30 or 4:00, for an early dinner. We were seated right away and it wasn't too crowded. Quick side note, use their valet service! Do not try to park too close on your own because it is steep. My dad refused to valet and the lot we parked in ended up being $20! We started with drinks and an appetizer. I got a sangria and my parents both got margaritas. My drink was a little atypical, it was more tropical flavored (and was yellow) than the traditional sangrias I'm used to. It was delicious though! The appetizer was a special, fried green tomatoes. They were garnished with little pieces of shrimp, which sounded strange but was also pretty good! I've also had their corn dog shrimp appetizer, which again sounds strange, but is delicious. I would definitely recommend the corn dog shrimp!For my entree I got the rainbow trout and it was delicious! I'd originally planned on bringing home leftovers, but nope, I couldn't stop. My family all equally enjoyed their entrees as well.Ok, now for the grand finale, dessert! My parents got the bread pudding and loved it. My sister and I got the apple pie. Now, this apple pie. Maybe this was partly my fault for not reading the description, but I was shocked when this thing came out. It is not a piece of pie. It is a pie. Like a whole pie! It's not the size of a standard pie but it is still a huge dessert! My sister and I tried our best but there was still at least half left. It's definitely a dessert for like four people.

The dumplings are so flavorful and unique, and the pita bread that came with hummus was amazing. They give you normal and gluten-free pita, and both were good enough to down without the hummus. I ordered the Korean Noodles + chicken dish and found it disappointing, probably because it was very far from the noodle dishes I'm used to.

I can't recall how many different restaurants have occupied the space, but it seems like beau coup people have been trying to get this place rolling and it just sits there, removed and cold with its business building glass windows lending nothing to the exterior of the place - certainly not warm and appealing.  The parking sitch is kinda different - you pay $5 and then when you go in and eat/drink they give you the $5 back.  Seems easier to validate, so I'll just scratch my head over that one.I can't say that the food is bad,  because when it arrives it tastes lovely - especially the small pieces of fried chicken,  but it does take a lot longer than it ought to given how busy it was (not very).

It puzzled me because this is a new restaurant. It was a rainy day so I thought maybe the stink had to do with the weather. After a trip to the bathroom I noticed the cause of the stench... The north wall of the building can be retracted and opened to the outdoors. This allows those at the bar to technically be outside so they can smoke cigarettes yet be right up to the bar that is indoors. Well, as the wind was blowing out of the north this blows the cigarette smoke right into the restaurant where it is trapped. Not a good set up at all and may be a deal braker for us.

It came with three sides. We ordered two pounds of shrimp, one pound of mussels, and one pound of crawfish. For sides, we had Cajun fries, garlic noodles, and sausage. First off, the Cajun fries left much to be desired. Coming from California where Boiling Crab is a big thing, these fries paled so much in comparison. Almost tasteless with barely any Cajun on it. A hard pass for me (and I love fries). Then again, I am a fry connoisseur. Our waiter failed to tell us that our sides would be included in our bag. Sausages, I can understand being cooked with the seafood, but the noodles? I wanted to try it by itself! He didn't explain a lot about the menu and we had to figure it out for ourselves. It would have been nice if he mentioned it came along with the bag of seafood.  Now, for the taste. We got the Louisiana sauce in medium. Spiciness level? Perfect for me. As for the sauce? It's good, don't get me wrong, but I wish the seafood held more of its taste. The seafood itself lacks a lot of good flavor that comes with the boiled-in-bag experience.

The deal was for a beef or chicken burger with a side of fries or salad. We had a beef burger and a chicken burger and upgraded the fries to poutine. I asked for the chicken burger without a bun and it came on some lettuce. The burgers were tasty and cooked nicely. The chicken patty was lightly fried and came with a delicious sauce. It was nice to also have a side salad included. 4 stars for the diner style food but there were a couple of mistakes: we ordered two poutines but they came with yam fries instead of regular fries, so we had to wait for them to fix the orders. They also made a mistake on the bill charging more than what was on the menu, but the server fixed it quickly. Aside from these glitches, Deacons Corner is worth a visit for your diner style food cravings!"},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"We came here for weekend brunch. RESERVATIONS: they actually do take reservations for brunch, and it's highly recommended that you make one if you're coming over the weekend because they get very busy. However, if you don't have a reservation, just show up at 9am when they open and you'll get seated. Only thing is you'll likely have to sit at the bar because the rest of the tables are likely all reserved. But you get full service at the bar so it's no issue. PARKING: there is actually plenty of metered parking on the streets!! Both around the corner and in front of the restaurant. FOOD: I highly recommend the lobster eggs Benedict. The eggs are cooked perfectly and it actually comes with plenty of lobster meat! For all their eggs Benedict dishes you have the option of choosing English muffin or a biscuit . They also had Mexican breakfast specials on the day we went, so we also tried the breakfast nachos which were yum (kinda like Huevos rancheros)! Comes with salsa, avocado, beans and 2 eggs cooked any way you like. You can also add meat to it for additional charge. Food comes out very quick. INSIDE THE RESTAURANT: Restaurant is not very big, it's rather cozy, but you won't feel cramped or anything. It's not a great place if you have a stroller for example bc they don't really have room for that. It's relatively quiet with only noise being from people talking, no loud music.

But quite frankly... I was left with a very meh feeling. First off, depending on what time of day you go, parking (a small area which is outside of the restaurant) is hard to get so if you can take Translink... take Translink because you'll probably save yourself the headache if it's a busier time.It doesn't have a Chinese restaurant feel... which is slightly disappointing but whatever... d√©cor isn't everything. Also, there are dishes listed not on their physical menu but on their takeout and online menusÔøΩ? So I think it is time for an update? And the prices have clearly changed but are not reflected on the takeout menus (they're about 2 years out of date) and were written on a piece of paper and taped into the restaurant menusÔøΩ? So yeah... they really need to order some new menusÔøΩ? both takeout and restaurant. As for the food we ordered... there were some hits and a few misses as well. We each ordered a dish to share between the five of us (ginger beef, chicken fried rice, sweet & sour pork, string beans in black bean sauce and beef with rice noodles). First off, they didn't have rice noodles, saying that they were out and instead gave us crispy noodles which they ok'd . That's something we should've been informed of at the beginning. The string beans were good but it's hard to mess those up. The sweet and sour pork was fine as well. And the ginger beef was more batter than meat (something I see someone else has experienced). The fried rice wasn't very fried and looked more like white rice with a bit of egg, chicken and peas.I might give this place another chance, I don't know.

I made my reservation a week in advance, however being that it was a cold Thursday night in Boston, I'm sure I could have walked-in with ease as well. \\nIt's a fine dining experience, with a modern interior and nice lighting. It's a rather large restaurant as well, plenty of seating despite the fact that this place is always busy on the weekends. Service is great and waiters are very attentive. They ask if anyone has any allergies to avoid cross contamination which I thought was very kind of them. \\nOYSTERS:\\nI ordered 3 kinds: the island creek, ichabod flat, and moon shoal. Everyone has different tastes when it comes to oysters, and me personally, I like ones that have a nice clean, not too salty taste. With that said, my favorite out of the 3 was the ichabod flat, being that it tasted creamy and not as salty as the others. Overall, the other two were good as well and I would recommend trying any of them. \\nLOBSTER ROE NOODLES:\\nI was really hyped for this dish based on reviews and I enjoyed it! The noodles itself are delicious and different from other pastas I've had; the dough tastes creamy with a nice chew. The pasta doesn't really have a sauce (maybe some kind of butter based sauce?) but it's rich in fillings like lobster chunks, brussel sprouts, mushrooms, and short rib. I thought the short rib was kind of an unnecessary addition and off threw the balance of flavors in the dish. However, the meat itself was really tender and delicious.

How can you mess up all you can eat pizza, right? Yeah, well don't expect super quality pizza, I mean pizza in general is pretty fantastic no matter what but this pizza was just 'meh' - on the plus side, they were coming it quickly as people were grabbing the up quickly.You start at the register and pay for your pizza buffet - I think it was $7 per person and our toddler was free. You then grab one of those plastic, cloudy looking buffet plates (ya'll know what I'm talking about) and start your way through the feed line. Meanwhile there are people coming up for seconds, thirds, fourths, etc...coming and cutting you off. First stop - pasta and sauces - empty in our case. Then there was soup - no thank you. Then you come across the pizzas, and use a spatula to put them on your plate - they are smaller slices and you don't have a maximum of the amount you can take. Then there's a massive amount of people waiting in front of an empty space while I later learned was the dessert pizza (cinnamon bun, apple, cheesecake). And it's dog eat dog at the dessert pizza station - if you take more than one slice of a specific pizza, expect dirty looks (even though I was grabbing a bunch for the table). There was a salad area too but I wasn't about to indulge as it looked questionable.I also learned that you can order a pizza with specifications but for some reason we were not allowed to do that, not sure if it was due to the high volume at the time or what.The place is just filled with people & kids...so many. And some of the people look as though they crawled from under a rock - yikes!The floors and tables are all just dingy and super sticky. There's a game room attached to the farther seating area. There was a guy walking around from table to table with children making balloon animals, we were getting excited as that would have been my toddlers first time witnessing that and getting it and he walked right by. Thanks for skipping us baking guy!All in all, unless you need to check off the \\"ate at CiCi's\\" box on some crazy chain restaurant bucket list, don't bother - so not worth it.

First off, it's a meatball shop filled with nice, helpful people. That's a good start - simple, unpretentious food should have simple, unpretentious service. Basically, before the idea gets lost in all these words: the meatballs are delicious. I think my favorite is the spicy pork - nice spicy flavor, moist, and hand-made. I think my go-to combination would be: spicy pork meatballs, served on polenta, with provolone sauce on top, AND spicy marinara on the side for dunking. The white bean ragout is tasty as well...chunky, and made from scratch. The little side salad you get with the combo is surprisingly well-done - nicely dressed, good ingredients, and a nice treat when your focus is on meatballs.The Meatball Monday is an interesting concept - but you must pick only one style of meatball, and you must purchase a 12 oz canned soda for $1.75 (crazy high price, right?). The meatballs are $1, but you must get a minimum of 4. I understand they are trying to have a minimum order transaction price, but forcing the soda (which I don't drink) or any drink (which I never buy) is not a good look. Too many rules and restrictions on customers can make the experience a drag - so I hope they keep it simpler moving forward. The inside area is quaint and cozy - but they need some casual music in the dining area to curb the awkward vibe that a small dining room with no sound can create. But, they're also great for takeout - as food is prepared quickly, and their packaging is high quality stuff!Each time I go in, they have something new they are trying out...like focaccia pizzas, and a few  other interesting things...so be sure to check out the specials. Overall, a good place for homemade, local food with options for everyone (they even have veggie meatballs)."},{"name":"Hearth Pizzeria","address":"974 Great Plain Ave","city":"Needham","stars":"3.5","text":"We were there last night and loved the duo of acoustic musicians playing.

A few reasons why they don't get 5 stars:  the hostess was kind of rude, the service was very slow, and it's pretty expensive.

My friend made her own pizza with a bunch of veggies and each topping was $2 so her medium pizza was over $20.

What more could you ask for? We came for dinner on a Friday Night. Pok Pok was pretty hoppin', we were hungry and boy were we excited to try those wings!!!!Pok Pok fish sauce wings - first bite I was like wow, amazing! The wings are glazed with a thick sweet and salty sauce and cooked for a satisfying crunch in the outside, and tender meat on the inside. The fish sauce gave it a nice fermented aroma. The wings were definitely very salty, so it is a good idea to order lots of rice and side dishes to balance out the flavors.Sticky rice and coconut rice - So simple yet delicious, and went perfectly with the Pok Pok wings. I love how the sticky rice comes in a cute little colorful basket to keep it warm. It was a nice chewy and sticky consistency. The coconut rice was amazing, cooked well with a hint of fresh coconut flavor in each rice grain.Iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk - I always love the Viet coffee, and they execute it here flawlessly. Amazing and smooth flavors with the Stumptown coffee, and served rich and frothy with condensed milk. Shaken, not stirred!Wait time was 1 hour for the two of us. They take your cell phone and text you when the table is ready, which is nice. We hung out at their sister restaurant Whiskey Soda Lounge across the street while we waited, per their recommendation (FYI offer some same menu options as Pok Pok including the famous wings as well). Pok Pok has a large outdoor patio and small indoor area. We were seated inside. The tables were a little small and really close together, so it felt a little cramped. Then the waitress kept sliding in between our table and the table next to us all night while she worked, which made it a little uncomfortable for our dining experience. The red table clothes and tin plates and cups made the vibe more casual street-food type of feel. I liked how the patio is decorated with lights. They put oil candles on the tables indoor once the sun set, which was nice.Overall we enjoyed the food and drinks. The wings were the star of the show. The portions are small, and prices are a little steeper then your typical Vietnamese and Thai restaurants. The service is prompt, but get ready for a wait and a crowded eating space. Takes reservations for parties of 6 or more."},{"name":"That's Italian Too","address":"957 Washington St","city":"East Weymouth","stars":"4","text":"its been awhile since I posted for this place \\"That's Italian too\\" \\nthis sub shop is still  \\" awesome \\" everything is great and the have specials form Mondays - Fridays all of them are wicked good. also they offer bowls of soups  Beef stew is my favorite really yummy during the day of a patriots game you will see people coming inside to pick up their party platters or for the brave \\" a  4 ft Sub \\" plenty of parking out front and on the side ( HP Parking is right outside the their door ) staff are awesome as the know most of the customers by 1st name and remember what you got last time. we're lucky to have such a great local sub shop and their prices are very reasonable."},{"name":"Woking Dragon","address":"1198 Landsdowne Drive","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"3.5","text":"Great first experience with this place.

We're not big burger eaters so we got grilled cheese and a hot dog with fries. The atmosphere is cute, there's a big chalkboard that kept the kids busy as we waited... and wait we did. I ordered my food at 2:48pm and got it at 3:05pm. Normally I wouldn't complain, but we didn't get burgers and our order honestly was super minimal. The most difficult part of the order was the slice of cheese I asked for on my hot dog (which was actually forgotten.) the fries were COLD. It seems like they make their fries as soon as the order comes in so they sit there for the 10-15 mins it takes your sandwich to be made. They were very cold and stale, which is sad because had they been fresh I'm sure they would have been so tasty. What was more weird was the fact that the shakes didn't come out for 5-8 mins after the food came out. We ate most of our meal without a drink. The staff was extremely friendly.

The restaurant itself is really big with multiple sections including a full separate bar outside with fire pits and an event venue area. The wait on a Friday night around 9pm was about 15 mins but you can get a drink while waiting. We ordered the hanger steak w/ a side of mac and cheese, my bf ordered the ribeye special with a baked potato, and the fried green tomatoes appetizer. My hanger steak was really good, cooked perfectly med rare, and very tender. The chimichurri was great and the mac was really creamy. Definitely recommend! My bf's ribeye, however, could have been better which is surprising since I would've expected this place to do a good ribeye easily. Not sure what it was, the quality of the meat didn't seem great as it wasn't as juicy as ribeye usually is. They put this truffle butter on it though that I could literally eat on everything. Fried green tomatoes were sooo good- the breading and crunch on them was great and the remoulade-type sauce was a great pairing. Our waitress said the breading is the same as for their fried chicken so their chicken must be delicious too! The complementary corn bread muffins were super yummy and acted like a small dessert to round out our meal.

When we arrived today at 11 all of the tables except for 1 were available. There were 5 out of the 7 in my group that got there first and were told we had to wait until everyone was there in order to be seated. There was one man already there but he could not be seated either since he was waiting for his friend so that means only 50 percent of his group was ready. We were told that if that man had not already been there, then we would of been able to sit down. So weird. BUT it was also weird that we were asked for our drink orders while we waited in the small area of the front of the restaurant and they brought us our drinks to have while we stood there. From the second we walked in, it was just the most awkward experience ever. Once everyone in our partied arrived, we were told they had to go set our table up - like why wasn't this done earlier when we got there and they knew how many was in our group??As soon as we sat down we were told that only 2 credit cards could be used per group and the gratuity would be included since our group had over 6. (This is fine but again, just awkward).As far as the food, AMAZING. I will definitely come back. The garlic pork ramen (not the official name) was so good.

The kind of cafe that used to exist all over San Francisco. Extremely personable baristas without any trace of pretentiousness. And that, in turn, attracts the same kind of customers. All of the tables were taken up when I came in on a Thursday afternoon. I went to order a coffee and when the barista mentioned sharing a table, a customer came and told me he was leaving and that I could have his spot. That action may seem small to some of you. But, in the ever changing landscape of self-absorbed middle class millennials that now run rampant throughout San Francisco, this shit just doesn't happen anymore. And that's the kind of world most of us now live in; where a small common courtesy can blow your mind.  When you're sitting there having your coffee, listening to the house play Leonard Cohen and Glen Hansard, whilst you're staring outside of the window onto the neighborhood's trees with their orange leaves, the sun sitting on your face...it's a good life. It's a democratic life. It's the kind of memory you'll have to hold on to as the near future seems bleak. When you're sitting in this cafe, it's hard to imagine there could be as much hate in the world as there is.I'm not trying to get utopian about it. I came in for their fresh and hot doughnuts and the barista said they were not making them that day. Deeming me and the barista not friends. And then a few hours later he came to my table and said \\"doughnuts are now live,\\" and we were friends again. If I can stay positive during a \\"no doughnut\\" day, you can manage to stay positive on any day. No booze. Clean bathrooms. Plenty of parking.

Crispy chicken was seasoned, hot and crispy!! Highly recommend this dish. Not to mention it was a huge portion and I had enough for lunch the next day! For $11, I'd say this is a steal. I did notice that the portions for noodle dishes were bigger than the rice dishes. All my friends who ordered rice dishes finished their food, while most of us who ordered noodles had leftovers to take home. My vegetarian friends were very pleased with the selection. There's a whole page of veggie options and throughout the menu there's a (V) for dishes that can be turned vegetarian! Also they know not to use fish sauce for the veggie dishes. It was a friend's birthday and they were fine with us bringing a cheesecake from outside! It made her night :) FYI - There's a separate menu for desserts.

I thought i'd order takeout and taste the food. Now, I cannot speculate as to the quality served to those dining in, but i can say that what I attempted to eat for takeout was an embarasment to the most diluted and stomped on excuse for thai cuisine. The boar was akin to leather served alongside a sauce that suggested, \\"I don't care and it doesn't matter.\\" The side dish...some fresh greens ready to be cooked...came along with some ice to keep them fresh! While I appreciate protecting the hard work of farmers to keep their product fresh, it has no business being on a take out bag. If someone wanted to cook the package they got for takeout, they would order from blue apron not a restaurant!The ike's wings were just okay and smelled like that underbelly of a factory developing the worst kind of fish sauce in Thailand. I understand that the fish sauce is reduced causing the markup to be high, but taking the most basically cheap ingredients: (chicken wings and sugar) and charging the consumer because there is a line, is not only extortion but petty theft. The standing icon of the freshness that can be found in any thai restaurant in america is the papaya salad. It is meant to be lively and fresh to counteract the bold flavors found in other dishes. The pathetic excuse for a salad that i received from here was only green papaya dressed in something spicy. It would suggest that perhaps by blowing out the palate of the consumer, one could cover up the fact that this salad is completely devoid of flavor. I love spicy foods, and this seemed more like a tactic performed by the most devious; those cooking for the overwhelmed prisons. With popularity, notoriety, and fame in the restaurant world comes a responsibility. To allow your standards to fall from expansion is what McDonalds would do.

Ok so service / Amazing! Literally the nicest woman you've ever met in your life giving you sugar covered pastry's and Kolache.The Kolache is good but the dough is super sweet, even on the savory Kolache. It's on the verge of too sweet for me but not quite. I ordered a sausage and cheese, sausage jalape√±o and cheese, the ham and cheddar, a raspberry filled and a cinnamon bun. (Not all for me lol!!!!) The sausage and cheese was sausage egg and cheese, it was good but it's weird to eat cold eggs. The jalape√±o sausage was the best. Unfortunately the ham and cheese was inedible- the dough was completelyyyyyyyy raw. We threw it in the oven for like 15 minutes but it was still raw in the center so we gave up on it. Cinnamon bun was amazing and oddly less sweet than the Kolache dough. This is probably a 3 star review but honestly they were so nice I'm still giving it 4.

Granted the person who suggested this spot for us is one of the people whose opinion I trust, but when I heard \\"southern food\\" I had my doubts. It's not that I don't like Southern food, but I'm from Alabama and I've had a lifetime of both sublime and horrific Southern food. It can really go either way.But that's not the case here. Moonshine is great in terms of food, service and atmosphere. The food is a solid take on modern Southern cuisine. It's elevated but not frou-frou. The flavors are deep and straight-forward. I had some salmon that had a great balance of wood-smoked, sweet and spicy flavors along with a side of sweet potato fries (a weakness of mine). In addition tasting delicious due to the glaze and peppers on the salmon I have to give kudos to the chef for the absolutely perfect temperature that the fish was served at; it was a perfect medium rare - right at the point where the fish was just done enough to be flaky, moist and succulent.To drink I had a couple of really good old fashions - spicy and just a touch of sweetness. After dinner our waitress brought out a salted caramel moonshine. OMG, keep this stuff away from me because I could have a potential problem if this was readily available.Service-wise, I can't say enough except it was excellent.

The curry flavor of both dishes was powerful and we had no problem knocking them off although it made it tough for me to eat dinner that night.  One side order of sticky rice and the pancake that comes with the HY combo were enough to provide a substrate for the awe-inspiring liquid curry that came with it in its own little plate. And the fried chicken? Super crunchy and hot out of the fryer with a subtle spiciness that makes me slobber just thinking of it now! The whole lunch with a couple of beers came to $43, a little more than I'd generally want for lunch but more than worth it for both the quality and quantity. I was worried this place might be super crowded for a Friday lunch but hey! Only a few people were in line at high noon, at the Belmont location.

As someone who grew up eating this dish, putting less than 3 stars would not be fair. There are a lot of things that they do well.I got set menu no. 1 that consists of roti, curry, and fried chicken. The taste is too sweet in a lot of ways in my opinion. Actual roti in SE Asia has layers and flaky, while here, it's kind of flat. The dipping curry is sweet, as compared to saltier and oilier version that I grew up eating. Chicken is pretty good, although I wish they go easier on the corriander, at least grind them. I also tried the sticky rice, it is a little dry.With that being said, I still think this is a good eatery and would suit the palate of locals here. I am all for casual Thai street food setting and decoration. It is a good way to introduce the Thai cuisine and enhance the experience.

If I have the chance to go back to Life Alive again, I'd probably try one of their rice bowls. Since noodles don't really absorb the sauce, there seemed to be a little too much of the sesame ginger sauce for me in the Fool. However, I thought the combinations of the vegetables was good, and that the many other bowl options at Life Alive looked great and worth trying. I got the Spring Alive smoothie as my dessert, and it was AMAZING. Smooth and creamy, and not too sweet. That smoothie, along with some of their other ones, has coconut-based ice cream in it, which I think helps create that lovely texture.Service and ambiance: 5/5\\nThe people working at Life Alive are just as lovely as their menu options. The woman working at the counter was very nice and patient as I struggled to make a decision, offering her suggestions and favorites. They also have plenty of different seating options, including tables for small groups, a window bar with single stools, and a downstairs seating area if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of ordering that occurs upstairs.I look forward to coming back whenever I'm in Boston again and trying more of their food and smoothies!"},{"name":"110 Grill","address":"170 Forbes Rd","city":"Braintree","stars":"4","text":"Had a great lunch with my dear friend.

The house made tortillas are thicker than usual, I enjoyed them nonetheless. Last by not least, they have fresh guayabana juice! It really does bring back memories from south America :) I also tried their churros, perfection!!!  Not too sweet, and just enough cinnamon to it!

Unfortunately, thats the only positive thing I can say about this place, despite being a regular at the \\"Weather Up\\" in Brooklyn.  On a recent visit to my former hometown, Austin, I suggested to my friends that they come to this bar because it was a spin-off of a great, cool, hip place in NY near where I live.  I was so embarrassed by my suggestion in the long run, because my friends (who live in Austin) are probably convinced that I frequent a pretentious place with poor service and staff who seem to go out of their way to demonstrate their contempt for customers.I arrived with a group of four and were expecting three others to join.  It wasn't crowded when I arrived, and having never been there before I moved to go inside (we walked in on the patio).  The. . . \\"maitre de?,\\" I guess, because he was wearing a red scarf and acting supercilious, stopped me and told me we needed to wait to be seated. I was a little surprised by this since it's not typical for a bar, and explained that there were more people to come.  He was clearly annoyed, asking me to specify how many more people (between 3 and 4 was not good enough for him) because he would need to find us chairs.  I said we didn't mind standing around in the bar area (though I had yet to see the bar since he stopped me on my way in).  At which point he said, \\"So, we serve craft cocktails?. . .so, we need to do things a little differently.\\" He began educating me about why the drinks were so unique.  In fact, they are not unique to me (every place in Brooklyn seems to serve drinks like these), and not to Austin, either (Eastside Showroom has similar drinks, minus the ridiculous seating policy or the smarminess).  I tried to explain that I was familiar with \\"craft cocktails\\" but by this time he curtly asked me to wait while he arranged my table. We were seated and the drinks menu looked great. . .however, service was extremely slow (30 minutes for a drink); the server failed each time to deliver the correct drink with the person who had ordered it, and when I attempted to order a traditional cocktail not on the menu (a whiskey sour), the waiter rudely told me to choose between the drinks on the menu inspired by the whiskey sour).  Another friend asked the waiter for suggestions based on the things she liked and he was dismissive and condescending.I was really sad to experience all of this, since Weather Up in Prospect Heights is a great spot and the only things it has in common with this place are the name and the bespoke ice.  It's fine to be a purist about traditional cocktails, but the rules, the rudeness, and the pretentiousness are so unnecessary. I'll never go back and I hate that this is the representation of a Brooklyn Bar in Austin--twice as douchey as the real thing."},{"name":"Dish Dive","address":"2233 College Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a BYOB restaurant people!

It was some sort of flattened beef with some onion on top, small iceberg lettuce and tomato salad to the side with some fries.  The steak was dry and flavorless. The salad had a chimichurri sauce that was OK but needed like a lot more to help with the steak. Diner A & B both got sandwiches and enjoyed them.  We also got some desserts. Because my steak was so bad and my co workers enjoyed their sandwiches, I'll give it 3 stars. If I make it back and the sandwiches are really as good as my co workers said, it's easy to see this place being a 4 or 5 star place.  Some oddities are that they serve oatmeal.

Right now it's just Tapas, but they said they will be serving entrees starting in January.  The Sandwich de Bistec was messy perfection, and the yucca stuffed shrimp will leave your table fighting over the last one left.

They wanted seconds and thirds, stuffing they're faces. As for me, the gyoza was soggy and slightly burnt. The dipping sauce was a bit too vinegar forward. The flavor of the tonkatsu broth was above average - great porky base. The soft boiled egg was better than most I've had - marinated and boiled in the broth? The chashu was disappointing. It was too small/thin to suffice, dry, and not very fatty/flavorful. TBH, I'm being too damn critical. Though I have experienced some phenomenal ramen I will return to this place happily!

Until the new location opens on East Colonial near Fashion Square, I will defiantly visit this Lucky's in the time being.\\nI was doing a few errands and decided to stop in for a few items on the way home. \\nAs you enter, the produce section is first. Unlike some stores in which the bakery is the first section you enter, causing your blood sugar to spike just looking at the baked items. I only needed to buy some fruit to pack in my lunch, and honey tangerines are $1.49 a pound. Two quarts of strawberries are $5.00. The produce section is as good, if not better, than other grocery stores. Especially the organic produce.\\nI am also impressed with the selection of cheese and meats, and coffee. I am good on coffee for now. But the next time I am here, I am going to try Lucky's coffee, which is whole bean that you grind there. Such as coarse ground. Ideal for a French coffee press. Like the one I have in the kitchen cabinet that gets little use.\\nI like the kitchen/hot foods section. Unfortunately, there was no rotisserie chicken available. I would have like to have taken one home for dinner. There is a hot bar and soups, as well as a pizza and sandwich counter. As  well as the caf√©. The only other problem I experienced was at the checkout when the scanner was not picking up the price code for tangerines. But that happens everywhere. \\nThe employees are friendly, the food and beverage selection is fantastic, especially the wines and craft beers, and the aisles are wide and clean. Some aisles in the produce section may be a tight squeeze. And you know there is always that one shopper blocking an aisle with their cart, making you go around the long way. The caf√© area and the bathrooms are kept clean as well.\\nParking is a little tight, since there is construction going on. But being a Monday afternoon, parking was plentiful. I entered and exited the parking on Orange Avenue. I do know the eastbound lane of Pineloch is shut down due to road work/construction. Take that into consideration when you drive here.\\nIt is nice to have a Lucky's Market close by. I will most likely visit here when I am in the neighborhood. I would like to try some of the house brands that Lucky's offers. And there was some nice looking steaks in the display case of the meats section.\\nAnd since we are on the subject of Lucky's Market, I was in Ormond Beach over the weekend, and there is a Lucky's Market that will be opening soon in the old Food Lion location on Granada Boulevard (State Road 40).

When we came there were two people in line in front of us and we waited for 30 minutes. About 10 minutes in two couples cleared out but we still waited another 2 minutes because they take their time to clear the tables and to give the cook some space between orders. The kitchen is small and open and there's one waitress and a bus boy. It's loud and cramped and probably not the place for a first date. Come here anyway.The menu is written on a chalkboard and it's cash only here. The portions are on the big side and everything is well priced. When you sit down you get plastic cups of water and some bread (not warm but was good all the same)We got the small fried calamari appetizer, the Aglio Olio (squid ink pasta with saut√©ed ground squid and  garlic) appetizer portion, and the mixed seafood combo entree. We wanted the lobster fra diavolo for the entree but at 2:30 they were already out of lobster. The waitress said the mixed seafood combo was the diavolo with all the same shellfish just no lobster. It was also half the price. We thought them running out of lobster was actually a good sign that everything was fresh same day. Towards the end of our meal we overhead them send the bus boy to meet a fisherman for some lobster. The calamari was perfectly done, a bigger portion than we were expecting, and came with just a wedge of lemon- no red sauce. Didn't need an sauce but the was Tabasco on the table if you wanted some spice. The squid ink pasta was very garlicky with lots of ground squid- I loved it and thought it was big for an appetizer portion (didn't even eat half of it). The mixed seafood was delicious- the seafood was fresh and the pasta was perfect. There only thing here was that if the seafood red sauce is really the same as the fra diavolo sauce like the waitress said then it's not spicy at all.

One important note: I do not like buffets. I hardly go to them, and if I do, I'm really picky on where and when I go. I enjoy fresh, quality food and most of the time that's hard to get in a buffet - especially seafood and sushi. But we were in town and this place was highly recommended. And Saturday nights are usually so busy so food is usually fresher.Food: Hugh selections...Hibachi, huge assortment of sushi/sashimi/nigiri, crawfish, crab legs, udon, kale, japchae, grilled tentacles - my personal favorite, dessert. However, out of the all the selections, only 2 were actually really good - the grilled tentacles and the japchae. The rest were just ok, but not bad. For a buffet, they did a pretty good job on refilling the food, there were only a few dishes and times that something wasn't available. Service: Our server was really good, better than you would expect from a buffet. She was friendly, available, and attentive. She brought us things that weren't available in the line - hot sauce, crab legs cracker, butter, drinks, etc.Price: It was $34 per person on Saturday night and although I did not eat  my worth, I could see it being worth it if someone enjoyed mediocre sushi and seafood. There is a 20% uncharge for wasted food, so only get what you intend to eat!

A kitchen was recently added and Sunday Brunch is now being offered. Sadly, management forgot to tell the staff that service and attention are required to keep customers coming back.A couple of Sundays ago, my girlfriend and I walked over around 11:30, in theory brunch starts @ 11:00. No other customers ANYWHERE, we made a crazy assumption that we would be dining before the sun set.  After waiting 10 minutes a waitress appeared, we ordered the sweet potato waffles and the crepe but not drinks (which may have been our downfall). Twenty minutes, yes 20 minutes, later waitress, who had disappeared during this whole time, tells us the batter for the crepe was not adequate so no crepes. One would think that information could of been parted with when we ordered, not 20 minutes later. Already feeling unloved by the lack of service and being assured the waffle was on its way, we chose not to order anything else. Another 20+ minutes later the waitress FINALLY brought waffle and than disappeared FOREVER. Was the waffle good? Oh yes it was, but our waitress did not offer to refill our water, nor did she ever appear again after the dish hit the table. We got tired of waiting, figured up our bill, left money on the table and left. Since there were no other customers there during the hour+ we figured the waitress had run off to join the circus. Would we have gotten better service if we had ordered alcohol? Should we have set something on fire to get attention?  Still hungry we went down the street to Cenote (also on Cesar) and got coffees and an omelet in less than 10 minutes. Were we the only ones at Cenote? Heck no, they were at capacity with a waiting line. So what gives Weather Up? Are you a bar and a restaurant?

I know they close at 10pm so I was hoping we could get a table but I was doubtful so I just wanted to know the wait time. I was already prepared to leave if the wait was too long. There were a couple of parties ahead of us waiting too. I walked up to the booth and the staff was working on the iPad. I didn't know if she knew I was there so I said hello. Without even looking up from the iPad, she raises one of her index fingers, signaling for me to wait, and did not say anything. She keeps working on her iPad for about 3 minutes and I am starting to get annoyed. She continues to not even greet me while I am standing there. Then, as soon as one of her co-workers or managers walk up to the booth, she quickly looks up and asks how she can help me. I'm not sure if she just finished her work on the iPad or if she is trying to look good in front of another staff. I simply ask for the wait time for a table for 2 and she said it's a 2 hour wait. I didn't want to wait that long and they close at that time anyways so I did not want to bother them. I said thanks but we'll just go back another time.

We arrived promptly at 8 AM because one of us needed to head directly to the airport to catch a flight after breakfast. We had heard good things about the restaurant and looked forward to yummy pancakes and to their breakfast drinks. It was busier than I expected for a mid-week morning, but there were still only about 5-6 tables of people, most of them parties of 2 or 3. There was one large party of 8-10 people who arrived not long after we did. But by no means was the restaurant crowded. Still, they seemed as surprised as we were, and completely unprepared. Our waiter, who seemed new to serving in general, was clearly nervous when he came to take our drink orders. We ordered drinks: breakfast cocktails for two of us and coffee for the other. The coffee came promptly but we waited 20 minutes for water (which had been promised at the time our drink order was taken). When a refill was needed on the coffee, the server had to take the cup back to the kitchen, since \\"no one's made up a carafe yet.\\" Our food orders weren't taken until at least 20 minutes after we sat down, although we had not asked for extra time. Our drink order took 50 MINUTES TO COME OUT. 50. Almost an hour. One member of our party had ordered a bloody mary; the other had ordered a restaurant special, house-made syrup served with a can of local champagne. They were not difficult drinks to concoct. Imagine if a bartender took that long! We calculated that in the entire restaurant probably no more than 10 drinks had been ordered, so there was not a deluge of drinks to be made. The bloody mary at our table had been ordered with an extra slab of bacon but arrived without it; they did at least bring it immediately to the table when we mentioned it. The food also took forever, but it wouldn't have been as big of an issue if we had gotten our drink orders in an appropriate amount of time. In fact, we would have ordered a second round of drinks while we waited for the food, except that we didn't want to wait another hour. When the food finally arrived -- almost ninety minutes after we sat down -- it was good. I ordered carrot cardamom pancakes (made in the kitchen, not at the table) with walnuts and honey; the batter was very, very good and the tall stack was a very economical $5.75 (which included two toppings). One friend got the Slappy Benedict, which was delicious; the other got biscuits and gravy, which were fine, but the gravy was slightly runny for our tastes. By the end of the meal we were in a hurry, as it was nearing 10 AM and we had hoped to deliver our friend to the airport at about 9:30. We did not bother to wait for the check (all the waitstaff seemed to be studiously avoiding eye contact from everyone in the place) but instead calculated our total and brought it to the counter. Then it took three members of the staff to figure out how to work the computer. Though we didn't complain about the wait, they did give us one drink free for our patience, but we couldn't wait for them to figure out how to recalculate the bill on the computer so we paid in full anyway. The food and drinks at this place were great, and if we had known we would be there for two hours anyway we probably would have tried the table top griddle, which looked fun. Although the restaurant is new, there's no excuse for the level of disorganization and the amount of waiting everyone had to do for their food. One of the servers commented to us as we paid that they were \\"not usually this disorganized\\" and that they hadn't expected the amount of people that had come in. It seemed to us that everyone on the waitstaff that particular morning was highly inexperienced. They definitely would have benefitted from having one person delegating who was to do what. In a town that loves breakfast this much, where the market is full of really fine breakfast places, a gimmick (making pancakes at your table) is not enough to keep a place afloat if their service stinks. The food is very good, though, and the drinks, when they finally arrived, were above average. (The house-made ginger syrup and champagne combo was delicious).  I hope Slappy Cakes can iron out the wrinkles and step up their game. I'll wait a few months before returning."},{"name":"Ceviche Tapas Bar & Restaurant","address":"125 W Church St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Out of any dining experience I have had I can honestly say that my service was excellent at Ceviche.

Matthew was incredible. Informative, friendly, efficient... He is literally the kind of server that makes me want to become a regular at a restaurant. I wish the food had been as good as the service. Salted Cod Cake- This was pretty inspired. The fluffy texture they achieved was almost bread-like, and all of the flavors melded well together. I highly recommend this. Oyster slider- Absolutely nothing special. I feel like I've had this sandwich at every east coast seafood shack in the south.Lobster Roe Noodles- I was really disappointed in this dish. I don't understand the rave reviews as I honestly thought this dish was kind of a disaster. The noodles were delicious, however- my lobster was beyond overcooked the first time, and the veg was raw, so I sent it back. The second time, the lobster was better (albeit still a little rubbery for my taste), but the veg was still raw. The Brussels sprouts were bitter- almost inedibly so, and the squash literally still had crunch to it. The short rib was cooked perfectly, but was a weird flavor profile added to this dish (at least for me). It's worth noting that I got insanely sick about 2 hours after dinner, and this dish was the only thing I didn't share with my dinner mate. It's now a day later, and my stomach is still messed up. Oysters- Let me preface this with the fact that I have only ever had oysters ONCE that I salivated over. Their oysters were okay, but not anything I would write home about. Biscuit- I live in the south, and I have to say... This was a pretty masterful execution of a huge biscuit (especially with the honey drizzle). Overall, not bad, but way overpriced for the quality of what we got. This is a 5 star restaurant service-wise, but a 2 star restaurant as far as food quality goes based off of my experience here.

I can't say it's the best ramen I've had, especially when compared to Los Angeles, but it's solid. They are actually an established chain with locations in Oregon, Washington, Illinois, Indiana, Taiwan and Japan. The establishment is modern Japanese, with a darker clean interior. Came here on a Friday afternoon and it was packed. You enter your group name on a digital kiosk. Party of two, we only had to wait about 5 minutes along with others in their little waiting area up front. The table layout is stacked fairly tight, not sure if they'd accomodate a wheelchair very well (call ahead). Unlike the trend in hard unpadded and uncomfortable metal or wood chairs, they have real thickly padded chairs. Hooray! The stream of patrons was constant from noon until 2 PM. Didn't have any trouble finding close parking in a shared mall lot. Service was attentive, quick and friendly and they were playing some actually decent electronic grooves through the overheads. Ordered the chicken wings, you get six. Hot crispy, tender and tasty, not spicy at all. More of a salt with light pepper flavor with a mild sweet drizzle and garnished with diced scallions. Along with some tea, I ordered the Yuzu Shio ramen as I wanted a lighter base. Also decided to try the green kale ramen. I don't really like kale on its own, but something about green noodles piqued my interest. Our server assured me that they wouldn't taste overly kale-ish. Adding items to your ramen is easy for an additional fee, I added some bean sprouts. Our ramen arrived hot and ready about five minutes after ordering. Presentation was nice. The kale noodles were a pleasant surprise, they were mildly earthy tasting with a flavor and texture that resembled traditional noodles far more than any kale leaf. The broth was light and with good flavor. Only wish there was a little more meat, you get one thinly sliced portion. Our eggs were whole (softboiled), but they were easy to break apart with the spoon or chopsticks. Server came by a few times to inquire and offer refills on water and tea. All-in-all I'd come here again. They have a decent menu with reasonable pricing and plenty of flavors. I didn't see it on this locations menu, but I'd definitely be interested in trying their seafood ramen. Still not as good as LA, but a-okay."},{"name":"Veritas","address":"11 W Gay St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The setting is a bit claustrophobic.\\nWe had the tasting menu.

The place was pretty dead when we first arrived (on a Friday night around 9pm) so we got to pick basically any table we wanted in the whole place. Slowly more and more patrons arrived until people weren't all sitting, so it didn't remain totally dead the entire time. I thought there was some kind of beer deal that I read about online, but I didn't see it advertised anywhere inside so we just bought full price beers on tap and they ran about $8 each. Eventually, the lights dimmed and they tried adding in a light show and a DJ'd playlist, but nobody started dancing. The vibe felt weird considering that when we walked in it was an empty, run down pub, and an hour later they were trying to do the whole light show and DJ thing. It didn't seem to work too well. The bathroom was pretty tiny with two stalls and one sink, but it wasn't so bad that I would have tried to avoid going in. I might come back here if I could find confirmation of a really cheap beer or appetizer, or maybe to feel like I was in a movie scene (sad, in an empty bar midday, asks bartender for another double...something like that) but otherwise, nothing special."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Not sure what there is to say which hasn't been said.

I ordered the Sicilian Hash, unfortunately some of the meat preparation done ahead of time already had Parmesan involved, and there was no way around it, so I ordered The Hawthorne instead. Seasonal veggies, potatoes, and scrambled eggs, all along side a scone. The scone was very tasty, but the meal as a whole fell a little short of satisfying.

Unfortunately, her \\"professional apparel\\" was anything but, wearing ultra short cutoff jeans that were in poor repair with the Von Ebert corporate t-shirt. Stray hairs were hanging from her clothing as if she just combed her hair (eew). Being a brewery, I was looking forward to some of Portland's famous craft beer. Several of the offerings on their beer menu were \\"not currently available.\\" I inquired about a medium flavored amber ale -- none available. At the server's suggestion, I tried a couple of tasters and concluded that Von Ebert does bitter beer very well. Even their summer fruit beer concoction featured a bitter after taste. Not what I was seeking. At the server's recommendation I ordered the much-hyped brisket sandwich. The only \\"side\\" offered were fries or tots with an additional charge. (No slaw as the traditional accompaniment to this sort of item?) It was served luke-warm on a puffy hamburger bun. The meat was only mildly flavored and included a surprisingly large amount of fat. The fries were soft and a bit greasy. This was my second visit to this establishment, hoping that my first experience (a negative one) at this Glendoveer location was due to start-up issues or just a bad night. I noted that they already upper their menu prices from their somewhat recent opening. The location is convenient to me and I really wanted this to be a go-to spot for a beer and casual dining. The service, meal, and bar timing were greatly improved from before. The food, beverage, and value were not. Oh-for-two Von Ebert and I'm done.Addendum: On July 31, I was contacted via a phone call by Dominic, the \\"director of Food & Beverage\\" in response to my review. We had a very cordial conversation where I agreed to come back so he could help select a more appropriate beer and a \\"guaranteed winner\\" of an entree. We set a time of 4 o'clock the next day, before they got busy with the evening crowd. My wife and I arrived on time, asked for Dominic by name, were escorted to a table, and informed that he was in a meeting and would be with us shortly. We decided to wait for his recommended beverage and food so sipped on the supplied water. I sent a text message to him (contact info provided earlier) at 4:09 that we were on-site and awaiting his presence. A server came by to report he would be a few more minutes and thanked us for waiting. We gave up at 4:25 and left the restaurant feeling pretty disappointed at the disrespect for our time and value as a customer. Dominic later texted an apology that he was dealing with an employee issue and didn't understand why we couldn't have waited for him a little longer. To which I conclude, he just doesn't get it.

Starting with the interior - Don't let the huge parking lot fool you, the inside of this place is quite cramped.  Tables extremely close together, and the waiting area is basically a cattle corral.  It's overall pretty uncomfortable for being in the suburbs.  Expect wait times of 30-60 minutes during crowded times (hint: not worth the wait).The queue system at this place is extremely awkward and I'm doubtful of the efficiency of the software that they use.  It's all facilitated through an iPad-like device where you choose party size and table choice (table or counter).  We picked counter, but we had to wait a ridiculously long time even though the counter had 4-5 spaces available (we were a party of 2) and there were also several open tables.  The system overall is frustrating and leaves you guessing as to how long the wait will be (will it be 10 minutes? 60 minutes? Who knows!)As far as the service goes, it's terrible.  Last time I was here our impersonal, inattentive waiter not once came around to check how we were doing or refill our drinks, and on top of that, our appetizer never came out.  Apparently it was \\"on the way\\" but that was after we not only waited on and received our bowls of ramen, but also had time to finish them.Bottom line: this place is overhyped for what it is, most likely due to the lack of ramen places in the area (especially good ones).Don't get me wrong, I like ramen, but not enough to have to come to a place like this.

Chicken Parm with a side of carbonara (the owner was kind enough to let him sub out his side of spaghetti for a small charge). We loved everything on our plates. We've since been back a couple times. I have also had the gnocchi but got the vodka sauce on it - highly recommended! And the fiance got the prosciutto and arugula pizza. Also quite good.

The wood paneled walls (reclaimed wood, not that tacky 1970s faux wood paneling) made the industrial space look rustic and lived in.  College football was shown on multiple screens and Chevy truck commercial music was playing on overhead speakers.  I was surprised to see only a few other customers there for lunch on Saturday but we were happy to be quickly seated.  Our server, Ashe, was very cordial and attentive but overall the food didn't do it for me.\\n  \\nThe pulled chicken had a faint hint of smokiness but somehow--despite being coated in white barbecue sauce--it was dry.  Drizzling on classic barbecue sauce from a bottle at the table helped...a little.  I think I was also bothered by the dark meat in the sandwich.  I'm used to chicken breast pulled chicken so I'm not going to lie, the occasional bites of gristle (that thin bulb thingy that dangles from a drumstick...I have no idea what it's called) were not appetizing.Anyone who knows me says that I'm part rat so I thought that surely the 3-cheese macaroni would be a high point.  After the first bite I realized that the dish was chock full of finely diced peppers.  I'm sure that some people like spicy mac and cheese but I'm not one of them.  If they had disclosed that on the menu then I would have ordered something else.  I was starving so I ate it but I didn't like it.Dessert was the saving grace.  The Mississippi Mud Cake with ice cream was delightful!  The chocolate cake had a velvety crumb--the perfect foil to the scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  The cake was topped with a layer of gently toasted marshmallow; that was the best part.  I stopped short of licking my plate clean.  I wish I felt that way about my entire meal.  Too bad the rest was just so-so.  Two stars for the interesting d√©cor and attentive service.  One additional star on behalf of my friend who raved about his smoked chicken wings, side order of Brussel sprouts, and peach cobbler topped with ice cream.

As soon as you walk into the door, you're greeted with a warm smile.We ordered 4 items off their menu and shared every one of them.  The Shaved Fennel Salad was the first dish and we weren't the biggest fan of it.  It was a good way to start the meal, with something refreshing, but it wasn't the best salad.  The Buttermilk Fried Chicken came next and this is their signature plate.  Absolutely delicious.  The pickled mayo and dill powder with their chicken is just incredible.  We could eat it again and again.  Next came the Charred Summer Cabbage.  It's ok.  It was a little too saucy for our liking but it's a nice light dish to have in between the chicken and our final plate, which was the Seared Scallops.  The shoyo dashi butter sauce is so yummy, along with the scallops and mushrooms.  Great dish.Their menu changes all the time, so it's a place to keep coming back for more.

You can thank me now. Powell's Books is the mecca for any reader in all subjects. I unloaded the car for seven hour pilgrimages down from Vancouver to the Portland area, braving I-5 congestion through Seattle and the border checkpoints, for the twin pleasures of seeing old friends and visiting Powell's. No stop in Portland, no matter how short, deserves a pause here. Slate at least an hour and a half even if you're certain to \\"pop in and out.\\" Even a knuckle-dragging, illiterate proto-human would be stopped in awe at the extensive picturebook and map sections. You have a Kindle? So do I. A visit to Powell's is still mandatory to appreciate the host of new authors, find those paperback editions for stories that will never see the light of digital day, and thumbing through print media. I dare you to resist sinking into a chubby couch and not blow 30 minutes going through a book of poetry which caught your eye or a novel that stole your heart by the title or spine alone. Powell's is the sort of place to reward exploration and a spirit of discovery. Luminous rooms stacked floor to ceiling by books from oversized coffeetable show volumes to dog-eared paperbacks and tiny chapbooks bound in cloth fill a corner of the intersection in Portland. I liken Powell's to a layer cake cunningly constructed by bibliophile bakers from several different treats: marchpane technical books, red velvet children's, some eclectic Swedish flavour fusion with lingonberries and coffee for speculative fiction; good old chocolate for fantasy, and so it goes. Every genre receives love and attention from a knowledgeable crew of staff who know their business. Handwritten review cards are the name of the game. I've discovered authors my grandparents read here and took suggestions to find writers heretofore unknown without an inside hook.Their ongoing support of the writing community is recognized internationally. My Portland friend posts regular updates of the signings and readings at Powell's; the choices are jawdropping. The likes of Neil Gaiman to Stephen King make a point to stop through when they make their book tours. Mary Robinette-Kowal all but performed excerpts. Love for indie Oregonians trying to make in-roads and the pop culture giants get equal celebrity treatment. I can only salivate over the book clubs, the writing meetups, and the regulars here. In no area does Powell's fall down. Their website is extensive, their prices fair, their mix of used and new a standard for any independent bookshop. This bibliophilic tour de force in the Pacific Northwest unabashedly loves Portland and Portland loves her back. Their community involvement is second to none. In the age of Amazon's megamonumental presence, Powell's does brick and mortar right. I will be a fan to the end.Parking is in an adjacent garage or street side. Park the car somewhere free, hop a tram or bus, and prepare to stay a while. Now get a sister store in Detroit or Toronto and we'll find that elusive sixth star."},{"name":"Mashita Teriyaki 5","address":"3010 NW Nicolai St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Simple, no frills, good value place to eat.

We were able to be seated right when we got there on a Thursday evening. The location itself was unique and impressive. They had several different areas for seating, including an outdoor patio area, an upstairs floor and an indoor dining area. As for the food, we ordered their staples: the fish sauce wings (one spicy and one non-spicy order), the Papaya Pok Pok, and several other dishes.  While the dishes were flavor packed and extravagant, we left wanting just a little more. Whether it was a combination of how pricy the dishes were or how the serving sizes were, there was just a little something more we wanted. I would definitely come back to give them a second chance, but I feel like the expectations going in were too high.

They were dashed from the moment we walked in the door.The restaurant is on the basement level and everything about the decor and arrangement just felt off.  The lighting is bad. It's super bright and stark.  With a name like \\"Veritas\\", you expect a dark space with candlelit tables, not someplace that reads like an old dining car that has lost its shine.  They were trying for mid-century, but it felt like we were in someone's basement at some kind of card tournament. To top it off, the chairs are obscenely uncomfortable.  What's worse:  they sound like nails on a chalkboard on the floor. It sounded like a horror movie every time someone sat down or stood up.We had already decided that we wanted to order small plates instead of the tasting menu, because so many items looked good when we looked at the menu online.  Also, 8 courses would have been A LOT for an 8:15PM reservation.  Our waiter suggested the mushroom ricotta toast \\"because he hates mushrooms and still likes it.\\"  We did end up ordering that, a couple of oysters, brussels sprouts, gnocchi, scallop, and the bacon risotto.  Unfortunately, our waiter didn't make any suggestions on the number of tapas to order for our party, so we ended up adding the hush puppies at the end.  Also, we waited a very long time for our first course to arrive, though the kitchen staff were clearly doing a lot of leaning (as was evident through the glass wall to the kitchen).Here's the thing:  I really wanted to like the food.  Everything is housemade and the menu boasted some really creative dishes and a nice infusion of Korean flavors.  Unfortunately, most of it just didn't work.  I LOVE salt and most everything was WAY OVERSALTED.  Especially problematic because so many items include bold spices and flavors.  On top of this, each item was brought by a different server and we were left with the same plates until the last course.  The seafood gnocchi might have tasted a lot more light and delicate, had I not been keeping it away from the strong spices of the sauce from the brussels sprouts.We all left feeling satisfied, maybe because nothing was so over the top that we were fighting over it.  In fact, each small plate usually ended with \\"You take it.  No you take it.\\"  There were a few bright spots though.  Cocktails were reasonably priced (if weak).  Also, although we had been warned a la Pretty Woman that the place was \\"very expensive\\", it didn't seem too bad.  I'm pretty sure part of that was based on the tasting menu prices, though.  \\nIn\\n the end, the pretentious attitude was totally out of keeping with my experience.  Maybe it was an off night, but they really did not live up to the hype for me. Even (especially) when you have great reviews, the details are still important.

Kimbap roll (beef veggie sushi roll) its the best travel food My boyfriend usually rotates around this : Chungpa sogogi (Chinese beef green onions and bamboo shoots stir fried) this is literally sooo good. Its definitely a Chinese dish tho as you can taste the familiarity. Beef or chicken bulgogi (beef or chicken stir fried  bbq) also one of our favs. The seasoning and sauce is always really good.

I'm afraid I might leave my shoes behind due the stickiness.Another thing, when we got there, 3 of the tables were dirty.  I don't know if the staff are waiting on each other to clean them.

The girl who picked Cafe Luna for Easter brunch said that it got great reviews online.As a vegan, I asked the waiter if I could just have a plate full of fruits and vegetables. The waiter kept going away and coming back, and asking me more questions about exactly what kind of vegetables I like. \\"Do you like brussel sprouts?\\" YES! \\"Do you like sweet potato?\\" \\"Yes!\\" Finally, the waiter left, and one of the owners showed up. The owner asked if I wanted any vegan chorizo.\\"Vegan chorizo!?\\" I was so excited.The owner explained that they had left it off the Easter Sunday menu to make it simpler, but that they had vegan chorizo available in the kitchen for vegans.

The inside has a high end feel, but it made it still feel relaxing and very chill. If you have a laptop or need your phone charged as you smoke, there are tons of outlets. I thought the furniture was over done at first, but there is still tons of room to move around and tons of seating for small to very large parties. Customer Service:\\nThis is the only reason this establishment is not getting 5.0 Stars. While the gentleman who helped me was not rude and got my hookah going almost immediately, he was on his phone the entire hour and a half that I was there. I felt like I was being rude if I interrupted his conversation. I can understand most of these places are not run by employees but by the owners themselves so they are at an extention of their home, however, I would appreciate a little more professionalism. He did check coals frequently so the hookah lasted a long while. Quality/Quantity:\\nThe quality of the hookah was fantastic. No complaints there. The only thing I question are the coals themselves. I think this is the pickier side of me coming out, but I like to use cocoa coals not quick lights. This establishment uses quick lights, which are not bad, they just go out 3x faster than cocoa coals. The overall quantity is great. Tons of hookahs for a busy night, a lot of seating as well.

It is in the shopping center with Taco something? We kept trying to find it, but no luck... I asked these people who had walked out of the Taco place and they said it's pretty hidden. If we walked along the side of the Taco place, we should be able to see a red light. We walk through the red light and ring the door bell and someone will let us in.  Looked pretty damn sketchy, but I did see a tiny little red light. It looked like a safety hazardous area kind of light. I went down the little walkway just to look and there it was!  So it's alongside of the Taco place. We ring the doorbell and someone opens the door. Its a speakeasy place (didn't know that until we got there). It was late as I mentioned around midnight and no one was really there. There were a few TV's around where you can watch TV, small little comfy areas to select from for you and your friends to sit.  We ordered drinks and ordered a plate of wings that came with fries and carrots. It was cool to just sit, chill, relax with your friends. The wings I wasn't very impressed.

This place has been a bit of a mystery to us for a while- it is steps away from our apartment and tucked away on top of the infamous Dark Horse Lounge. We had seen the sign many times but had never heard anyone talking about. Regardless, we decided to give it a try on a balmy, winter Sunday afternoon. During the week, this spot is a private club and event space, but on Sunday, they are open to the public for brunch- we had the impression that Sunday brunch serves a quasi-open house to give clientele a taste of what to expect with a membership. And we were far from disappointed. The atmosphere was pleasant, with plenty of sunlight, and we opted for the rooftop patio, which was very comfortable and provided nice views of VA Highlands. We were seated and served by the friendly host right away, and opted for the very reasonably priced bottomless mimosas, with rotating flavor choices between orange, cranberry, grapefruit and pineapple. We sampled each throughout the meal, with pineapple being the stand-out. Although the menu wasn't terribly vegetarian-friendly, we were able to customize it to our liking. She had the classic two-egg breakfast, sans bacon, served with an outstanding flaky biscuit with refreshing strawberry jam. I ordered the classic eggs Benedict, and substituted the ham for roasted asparagus. It was delicious- classic, hearty but light enough to make me feel comfortable. We were also treated to complimentary small cinnamon rolls at the start of our meal, a perfect sweet way to start our brunch. Besides the quality of the food, the service was impeccable. Our waitress, Raina, was beyond courteous and attentive, and her and other servers kept our champagne flutes full throughout the meal. To top it off, the wait staff even treated us to a show, performing an impromptu conga line to \\"Proud Mary\\" on the patio mid-meal. I am not usually one for such silliness, but the homey atmosphere and genuine hospitality of the staff, made this a convivial and light-hearted touch.

Cocktails were well made especially the moonshine ones. Portion sizes are Texas sized so sharing is a good idea. We were 2 people and initially waited for a table but they told us it might be an hour wait which seemed extra long but we took a chance, had a drink and a couple spots opened up at the bar after about 20 minutes. The bar serves the full menu and is first come, first serve. The bartenders were friendly, attentive and talented drink makers as well as knowledgeable of the food menu.We went with a few of the recommendations found on other Yelp reviews but no one mentioned the Fried Green Tomatoes, the bartender recommended them and they were to die for! The shrimp corn dogs were a fun novelty take on fair food but no taste comparison to the crispy breaded fried green tomatoes and accompanying aioli sauce and chiles on top. We then shared the chicken and waffles. I'm a first timer on this craze as I've always thought it was a weird combo but when in the south. I'm now a believer! The chicken was juicy, tender and crispy and the waffles were perfect. The accompanying sauce went really well with the sweetness of the syrup. I'm only sad we didn't save enough room for dessert. I also noticed from other reviews that there's complimentary popcorn and cornbread muffins however maybe because we were at the bar they don't offer them?

When we got there we noticed a very large party, but I didn't pay it any mind.  The servers were friendly enough.  We got our drinks fairly quickly.  When we ordered we expressed that we'd hope we could get our order in before the party of twenty.  I ordered the Bourbon Street Po' Boy with the lobster, crawfish, and shrimp.  My mom ordered the prime rib special  medium rare (they said it was cooked to order which is different than I normally think of prime rib) with a side salad.  We both had the bayou strings as a side.  Her side salad came out pretty quick, and we were really hungry so we were happy to see some food.  The salad was huge, but unfortunately, it was trash quality.  The vegetables were all semi-wilted and close to past due and it left a really bad after taste in your mouth.  We both had a few bites and just hoped the entrees would be better.Of course our orders were not cooked before the very large table's and we were waiting forever.  The manager/server told us \\"Your food is coming out right now\\" three times.  My po boy arrived before my mom's dish did, and had been sitting at the window for a long time.  By the time I got it the bread was cold and the shellfish was lukewarm.  I told our server(/manager) and he took it back.  It was brought back in roughly two minutes and was extremely hot (read: microwaved).  My mom's prime rib came out shortly after.  I guess it's a novel idea for the food to arrive at the same time.  It was pretty obvious it was well done just by looking at it and not medium rare, but our server asked her to cut into it.  Correction.  Beyond well done: overcooked.  At that point we just got up and left.  It had been over an hour we were in there, and all we ate was a nearly rotten salad.  Thinking back, really their concept makes no sense either.  It's like a buffet.  Serving a lot of mediocre food instead of a select menu of good food.  I understand they had a big party (by the way, they didn't look happy either), but that had to be reserved in advance because they were well-staffed for such a small restaurant.

(including my current hometown of Seattle.)  It was cooked perfectly, sauced perfectly, seasoned well and just-right portion size.  OMG!  Felt like I was back Italy for a minute, especially with the staff speaking in Italian all around me.About the food...I try to often order spaghetti or linguini with clam sauce in restaurants, because it is one of those dishes that is so good, so simple, yet way too much work to make at home, IMO.  I don't care if the sauce is red or white (wine) sauce, as long everything is cooked well.  Here it is a simple white wine/garlic sauce with a light sprinkling of Italian parsley, and utterly delicious.  My 7-year-old fish-lover son and I each ordered the dish, and while he usually won't touch anything that has anything green in it, he scarfed his down and even ordered a second helping of \\"just the clams and sauce\\".  Others in the family had the penne with pesto, and a dish that included spaghetti, a lighter pesto than the one in the penne, shrimp and mushrooms, and both dishes were simple and spectacular. I can't wait to come back try some of the other dishes on the menu, particularly the homemade pappardelle.I would have given the overall experience 4 and a half stars if that were possible, because there were a few minor issues.  The entrees took a very long time to come out, which was tough on the hungry children who whined a bit. I didn't care too much about that, because as I said, it's a fun atmosphere, with soccer games on the TV screens and people chattering in Italian.  And the wine pours were big, probably double what I have received in other places...not complaining about that!  Next time I will avoid the 7 dollar salad, which was basically a couple handfuls of mixed greens and some tomatoes.

FIELD GUIDE so you don't go about it like a noob:When to Get There: \\nYes it's true, the line outside pre-opening brings attention to Ramen Tatsuya in that semi-ghetto asian complex that only Din Ho people knew about before they opened, but get there before 5 for the smallest wait. Then you'll be immediately seated while others watch you with envy and be strolling out the door with a full belly by the time others have time to say \\"Sapporo.\\" They may also potentially (read: did) make your my roommate cry out of frustration because they either sold out early or because of the extreme conditions of longing while waiting in the heat and being turned away because there was nothing left. How To Order:\\nDon't try to order something different from what's prepared on the menu. Don't try to order squiggly noodles instead of straight noodles if you're not getting the dipping noodles, because frankly that's just not how they want you to eat it and if they see you do this they will pretend that they don't see you and think about calling you out and maybe do it and then you will feel shame and your noodles might not taste as good as they should. Jk--but really, they want you to experience the dish the way it was meant to be experienced--they frown upon arriving late to a bowl of ramen with a congealed top, subbing your noodles for \\"better\\" ones, or trying to change anything up because you think you know better because.. they know better. What To Order: \\nThis was hard to narrow down, but I think that the #1 Original is my favorite, with the dipping noodles as an extremely close second and the Miso as a third. Sometimes I feel like the #1 and dipping are tied, because as much as I love the creamy broth that has been obviously simmered for just the right amount of time, I also love the sweet but limey kick of the dipping broth and the chewiness of the noodles. \\nALSO note: the dipping noodles are for dipping. Don't try to disperse all of your broth over all of your noodles at one time like a noob because let's go back to the ordering point: retain the quality of the way it was meant to be experienced and use that ceramic spoon. \\nThe #2 is an amped-up version of one with more saltiness (a few times that I've been there I thought it was too salty for me) and more seaweed, and it's common for my friends to get corn bombs for the extra yum factor (although I'm not into that). The miso is a good choice with a more subtle taste if the #1 is too intense for you, but it had smaller pieces of ground beef rather than the super yums pork belly. What I love about the ramen bowls is the egg and pork belly (which they started charring with some crispiness in my most recent visit as opposed to simply slow cooking it to be tender. It is MUCH, MUCH better charred, which is what I prefer. Their pork belly slider is also a good try with a side of their version of chilled mashed potatoes which I will call Asian Mashed Potatoes. Also, go for the mochi and almond tofu, which has slices of apple and tangerine and comes with a cutesy spoon that causes you to comment about how small it is. Other notables: a small shelf of asian beers and sake, some asian fruit snacks that are soda pop flavored. Overall Rating: \\nI would ultimately give 4.5 stars because let's be real: I wouldn't eat here every day. The broth is extremely rich and delicious, but afterward I was like man--give me some veggies, I want something light. BUT, I do applaud them for tapping into the storefront dedicated purely to ramen after so many of my friends hunt down the ramen specials at specific restaurants (East Side King, Kome, Musashino). Also for sticking with a small, obscure storefront that is small enough to bring attention to the line outside and to create a close-proximity culture where people sit next to each other and make slurping sounds. Also, it's all my friends talk about and want to go to which is why I've been here a multitude of times. Also, now they have a newer looking menu. Quick Pro: \\nGood service-- they allow you to order more while eating and can bring out your ticket and take care of it while you're at the table. Quick Con: \\nThey're so packed and the line is constantly moving so they take your bowl ASAP, don't allow you time to loiter much unless you're eating dessert, and generally but politely ask you if you're done so that other people can have a place to sit. Also, sometimes they won't seat you unless your whole party is present for the sake of seating, but they try to accommodate when they can. Overall, having a clear focus on ramen and red bathroom art makes them different (because after all, who really instagrams bathrooms because they look good anyway), bravo!"},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"503 W Martin Luther King Jr Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I cant believe this place!!

I was deathly afraid of a long wait on a warm day in May with my 9 year old daughter in tow.  Surprisingly, we strolled up at lunchtime on a Saturday and walked right in.  Was it a freak occurrence or did it have something to do with the Rose Festival?We started with drinks.  My wife had one of their hand crafted creations, my daughter with a classic thai iced tea and I had a blackberry som.  Mine was tasty and refreshing, but I had to kick it up with a shot of vodka.Being first timers, the entire menu looked intriguing, but we had to order somewhat light as we had an early 5:00 dinner coming up.  I knew the fish sauce wings were a no brainer and they didn't disappoint.  It was a perfect blend of savory and sweet with a nice sticky yet crispy texture.  We went for the Muu Paa Kham Waan next.  This was a nice contrast to the chicken.  It was almost like a boar ceviche on steroids.  It was super tangy, herbaceous and uber spicy.  Served with some iced mustard greens, it was pleasantly refreshing.  The last dish we ordered was the Kung Op Wun San.  This was easily my least favorite dish.  It was good, but it didn't have the in your face flavors of the previous two.  For sides, we had some sticky rice, which was good, but nothing special and some coconut grilled corn on the cob.  The coconut was extremely subtle.Service was great.  Our girl was very helpful in steering us around the menu.  Sitting inside was definitely nice.  It wasn't the height of summer, but it was very warm outside nonetheless.  Prices are relatively more expensive than your typical Thai place, but it won't break the bank.Overall, we had a great experience and under the same conditions, I would not hesitate to go again.  However, I would probably change my mind if I had to wait an hour for a seat outside.  I noticed that an offshoot has opened in LA.

Not until we went up to the counter to ask for them did we receive the coffees five minutes later.\\nWithout trying to exaggerate, I would say about 30 minutes after ordering our rather simple breakfast order a gentleman, or i should say some dude, came over that worked there and asked if we had ordered. I said politely enough that we had in fact ordered awhile ago and he proceeded to give me a \\"this is not ihop or Denny's and everything we make is fresh, blah blah blah\\". I found this a weird comment considering I hadn't given him an attitude. Well, 20 minutes after this we are still sitting there twiddling our thumbs getting increasingly hungrier. Eventually we decided to just get up and tell them we would pay for our coffees and were leaving. Rather than apologizing for the slow service, or making up some excuse that the waitstaff was new or they were down a cook, he tells me \\"fine, just go.\\" I really couldn't believe the complete lack of empathy from the guy who I believe was the owner, or at least manager, of the place.

My wife was excited to visit this \\"trendy restaurant\\" and we waited several weeks to find an opening around 7pm. Open Table sent me 2 emails reminding me of our reservation and Island Creek phoned me on Monday to reconfirm. We arrived at 7:02; the valet approached and asked if we were checking into the hotel. I replied no, we were here for dinner. Next I was asked the strangest question of my dining life, \\"Do you have a valet reservation?\\"  Island Creek would rather sell their valet spots to Red Sox parkers for premium than make the usual fee. I asked my wife to wait by the car, entered the restaurant and asked for a manager. I identified myself, explained that I arrived on time, and was told that I should have made a \\"valet parking reservation.\\" As I became more upset, I asked what other 2 restaurants in the city of Boston require such. Answer: Island Creek and Eastern Standard. I asked how should I know this, it isn't in the reservation emails, on the web site, nor did the phone reservationist mention it on Monday. What a sick business plan. Just lie to the customer. Island Creek may enjoy the profit margin on their Red Sox parking, but know that they have no interest in dining customers.

Very soon, he will be enjoying it along with my other brother, who I'm pretty sure will become an addict!Every time I plan to go, I do my best to go on dinner time when they have live blues. Rib-gasmic! This is your Latina chick loving the experience of having a chunk of ribs inside her mouth...chewing it slowly, getting its flavor to seep into her palate and taste buds. While doing all this mouth wrestling, she looses herself in the wonderful notes of a good tune, washing all that down with some semi-sweet tea (blend of sweet and unsweet).I usually accompany my meal with potato salad...and I never say no to the enormous loaf of white bread. I do break some rules when I'm here: I get bread, sweet tea, eat with my hands, clean the plate with the bread (literally) and dissect a big piece of pecan pie \\"by-myself-no-sharing-thank-you-very-much,\\" in what is a long lasting sweet tooth experience.

Our group started with the fried oyster sliders, one each. They were excellent -- crispy, juicy, and a great combination of flavors with the oyster, toppings, and brioche. Definitely a standout. I would've definitely gotten more than one, but wanted to save room to try a few different things. In hindsight, I could've just eaten a bunch of these and gone away happy.Next I had a cup of clam chowder, which was flavorful and had lots of clams -- my only small quibble, and it really is more of a personal preference, is that I would have preferred a thicker, less watery texture. Next on the agenda was a dozen raw oysters, and our server was extremely helpful in giving descriptions and suggestions. Each one was as advertised, whether briny, or sweeter, etc., and all tasted very fresh.And for my main course, I went with the lobster roe pasta, which, while tasty, didn't quite live up to the hype/price the way I'd hoped. I had to remind myself that we were at a seafood place and not a pasta restaurant, and that it was lobster ROE pasta -- there was plenty of lobster roe and even a pretty generous amount of short rib -- but not a whole lot of actual lobster except for a couple of pieces on top. Still, it's mostly my own fault for expecting more lobster, since it's clearly called a lobster roe pasta. Misguided expectations aside, it's a solid dish, though a bit on the salty side in my opinion.

I told my wife I could actually feel the alcohol in my stomach getting sopped up. She had the filet with the New Orleans B√©arnaise sauce over Red Bliss potatoes and a side of fried okra. Really nice! I had the espresso-rubbed flat iron steak with asparagus and au gratin potatoes. Cooked to perfection. We tried the Krispy Kreme bread pudding for dessert, because how could you not? It was okay, but my wife makes one at home that we both agree was better.Overall, the food was really much better (MUCH better) than we expected when we first arrived.

Instead, an employee in the far back corner signaled us that there were two empty seats over by where she was standing. First thing I noticed as I sat down were how sad the sushi moving around on the belt looked. Some of it looked really old. Some looked like it was falling apart. Some looked full or topped with tons of unidentified sauce...perhaps mayo? None of it looked appetizing. Boyfriend pulled off some edamame which was fine. I ordered a Lion King roll which the sushi chef made fresh. It tasted decent, nothing special. We also ordered calamari which was also made fresh and tasted really good. After looking at the menu we decided to go with bento boxes. First my boyfriend ordered the teriyaki chicken bento and then I ordered the tempura bento. My bento came out about 20 minutes later, but his never came. Perhaps the sushi chef was confused and thought we switched the teriyaki one to the tempura one? Either way it was clear they didn't understand us and didn't take the time to clarify. Not wanting to wait another 20 minutes we decided to order some more sushi. I asked for a Spider Roll and my boyfriend asked for some gyoza. The gyoya turned out fine.I expected the roll to be made fresh but the chef literally waited until the old Spider roll, which had been going around and around on the belt, reached a point where his back was turned and grabbed it off. He sat it on the counter while he made something else, and then handed it to me, as if I would think it was freshly made. I could only eat half of it as it tasted fishy and made me feel sick. The vegetables in the tempura bento were good, but it was easy to tell the shrimp tempura was not freshly made as the coating was a much thicker consistency. I suspect the shrimp ones were not made in house. The seaweed salad wasn't appetizing. The miso soup was edible but not very good. The California roll that came with the bento was 90% 'crab salad' (which I think consists of small pieces of fake crab and TONS of mayo) and a tiny sliver of cucumber. They were disgusting and I barely got down two pieces. Good thing I had a Groupon and only paid $12.50 for it all, although it still wasn't worth it. Would have been one star but certain things were good (calamari and vegetable tempura). Overall there are SO many other amazing sushi restaurants in the Portland area. If it's really the conveyor bet you're after O'Sushi is Hillsboro is really good, less expensive ($1/plate all the time!) and has delicious seared salmon. The difference in food quality is worth the drive.I'm sure there are many other better conveyor belt sushi joints in Portland I have yet to discover. You should be the one to discover them and skip Sushi Sakura. Don't care about the belt?

However, I was hungry and everything at Encore is billed as \\"high-end\\" and \\"luxury\\" (and I note that while the casino itself has a fair amount of the cheesiness typical of these venues, it is not without a small amount of class--to the extent it's possible for these places to have any).Red 8 is expensive--by which I mean grossly overpriced for what one gets in the bargain (I note that I eat at high-priced restaurants often & I generally don't feel the need to focus on cost because I often feel that the meal, the service, the atmosphere were all worth it).  I guess it is the high prices that lead the Wynn group to believe that Red 8 is high-end because neither the food nor service were.In all fairness the food was average and the service--while insufferably slow (apparently the Encore folks don't realize that every minute spent in the restaurants is time stolen from the other, presumably more lucrative, money-making enterprises that occur there)--was pleasant.  I had the lemon chicken; it was exceedingly middling, entirely unmemorable.  Indeed, it was not nearly as good as lemon chicken I've had in dive-y Chinese restaurants in Paris (a city which is not particularly known for its Chinese cuisine).What took this from perhaps a 2.5-star review to a 1-star, however, was an issue with the wine.  After waiting a good 15 minutes to place my order, I ordered a glass of wine.  A wine glass arrived, but when my meal did 25 minutes later, it remained empty.  An observant server said, \\"oh, were waiting for wine?\\"  (I resisted my snarky impulse to say, \\"No, I generally travel with an empty wine glass as a sort of \\"therapy pet\\" for me\\";  of course I was waiting for wine!).  She \\"looked into\\" it.  Halfway through my meal, I was provided an update on the missing wine (and I note that I hadn't ordered an obscure vintage of Ch. Petrus, but a merlot that can found even in grocery stores and 7-Elevens (again, this is how \\"high end\\" Red 8 is!):  Red 8 was out of it (I guess they were searching their extensive cellars all that time!).  Shortly thereafter another functionary arrived to inform me again that they were out of the wine.  I guess Jesus hadn't arrived in the interim to perform his water-into-wine trick!Eventually I received a glass of wine--just as I finished eating.  And then I received the check;  this luxury\\" restaurant had the shamelessness to charge me for the glass of wine I never really wanted and for which it took me a small eternity to get.  I normally sate myself by writing scathing Yelp reviews when I feel I've been wronged, but I couldn't help myself.  I flagged down a manager and recounted my story.  I was informed that they weren't really out of the wine I had originally ordered and that they had bottles of it at other of the casino's restaurants and that they could have procured it for me (I imagine they could also have gone down to the Everett 7-Eleven!!!).  I don't really get how this was supposed to assuage me--my principal concern wasn't that the wine I had ordered wasn't anywhere on Encore's premises, but that it took me a good 40 minutes to eventually get any wine at all.  Ascertaining the absence of something is generally not difficult (perhaps tending bar at Lot 8 is Don Rumsfeld's second act:  \\"absence of the evidence of cheap Merlot is not evidence of the absence of cheap Merlot\\").  After I explained that it is common practice for restaurants to take responsibility for these contretemps, the manager then sought approval to waive the comparatively insignificant cost of the glass of wine I did receive.  Waiver was granted.In case you haven't inferred, Lot 8 is like the games at Encore themselves:  the odds of receiving great service are against you.  This is an over-priced establishment that does not have \\"its act together.\\"  As I noted, Encore as a whole has pretensions to class.  Unfortunately, pretensions in themselves do nothing.  I would recommend that folks looking for a night out of dinner and gaming first go to a dining establishment in the city before making their way to the casino--that's the best bet!"},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Really great breakfast options and nice ambiance.

Generous portions, won't break the bank, and super fast service.I arrived at around 5pm on a Saturday for an early dinner with three friends.  The parking lot was already jam packed, and there was already a crowd of about 20+ waiting to be seated.  We ended up sitting at the bar for appetizers and drinks while we waited.  I ordered the tater tots with chili and cheese (I want to warn you that they are definitely generous with the cheese!).  Our appetizer arrived not even 10 minutes after we placed the order at the bar, and we were seated about 5 minutes after that.  I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly we got a table considering how busy it was!Now for the food!  Our table ordered a mix of wings, ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and a variety of sides.  I have to say the pulled pork was my absolute favorite; it was incredibly moist and had so much flavor that I didn't even want to cover it in BBQ sauce.  The sides I ordered were the mac n cheese, onion rings, and fried okra.  I wasn't a huge fan of the onion rings as I am a more beer batter kinda gal and these onion rings had a breadcrumb crust which made everything really dry.  The fried okra was spot on.  The mac and cheese was a little too rich for my taste, but if you like cheese, then this is the side for you because they smother it with an additional layer of cheddar cheese...Service was friendly and lightning fast.  The four of us were starving so it was a little discouraging seeing the huge line outside when we first arrived.  But they definitely made sure we were that we fed and happy in record time.

While we did eventually get a table, we had to take our food to go :( FYI, there is take out available, counter was close to the entrance and really we should have utilized that.Otherwise, we ordered the famous fish sauce wings and the crepes with the mussel. Obviously fish sauce wings was a winner and a most try in my opinion! The crepes could've been better, it was quite bland in my opinion.

Pork stock is greasy.This pork soup was full of flavor without a spot of grease.Better yet, the pork in the soup was as lean as chicken breastBut tasted porkier than Porky the Pig.Like a stand-out \\"pay attention to me\\" exclamation mark level of actual pork taste.Tiny shitake caps were fresh and vibrant.The greens and tofu played well with everything else.This is a bowl of soup that could have competed with Ramen Tatsu-ya in the same Asian food complex.(Side Note: the proximity of Ramen Tatsu-Ya may have been what stimulated Din Ho to jack up their game.)The Barbecue was also lovely. Pig Organs are often the most interesting thing to order at a Chinese BBQ place.You get - depending on the place - two to six different kinds of meat with your order. (Tripe, intestines, pig ears, tongue, heart, whatever)All the meats taste REALLY different from each other.This is a plus when you are having meat, just the meat, and only the meat. Unlike everything else in a Chinese restaurant, with BBQ there is no sauce or side vegetables for extra entertainment.So having a mix of radically different tastes on the platter is a good thing.(I can get pretty bored working my way through a duck - even allowing for skin versus meat).In this case, though each part of the pig requires a different cooking time and a  different cooking technique, each was perfectly done and at peak flavor before being mixed with the other components.A fine platter and fine eating.The featured dish of tofu and mushrooms was the only relatively boring dish on the menu - but then bland tofu dishes tend to be bland tofu dishes.Altogether, this was much more dynamic and vibrant eating than we were used to seeing at the old Din Ho.Din Ho is now back on our rotation of Asian Chinese restaurants to be visited regularly.And given how many impressive Chinese restaurants have opened in Austin in the last ten years - It is something to say Din Ho can hold its own with the newbies.* * * * *Postscript: On looking at the other Yelp reviews - There seems to be a general thumbs down on the other BBQ items.Pork meat, duck and chicken all get bad reviews From reviewers who know their Chinese BBQ.It could be that they do Pig Organs much better than they do regular meats Which could make sense since the dishes are prepared in very different ways.I will stick to my guns on the assessment of the Fish Fillets and Soup."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Love, love, love, love it.

My husband and I went last night (Friday) at 5:30 pm. Since we are observing Lent, we were looking for meatless or seafood entrees. I have to say that Casa Arandinas has many seafood entrees to choose from. My husband ordered the Shrimp enchiladas which were really good, and at $9.99, a bargain. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros (breakfast is served all day) and it was perfect as usual. We each got a house margarita ($2.99 at Happy hour). I knocked one star off my review because their chile con queso is of the cheddar cheese soup variety that you get at ballparks. It is very disappointing. For me, the appetizer sets the tone, and this queso sets a bad tone to the meal. But, if you stay away from the queso, you probably will have a perfect meal."},{"name":"Starbucks","address":"199 E Campus View Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I was just here and received a fly in my drink!

We were greeted by a friendly and professional hostess, who sat us right away at a cozy table on the windows.  Our server came over shortly thereafter, and was SO nice!  Wish I could remember his name...\\nWe started with the cheese board of the day and the arrancini. The cheeses were absolutely delicious, authentic, really good quality cheeses. Served with some cranberry/apricot/dried fruit chutney, bread toasts and what we believe were toasted candied hazelnuts. All was to die for!  The arrancini were just perfect - rice was perfect, good seasoning, fried to a crispy deliciousness on the outside; served with a light tomato sauce. \\nOne got bucattini carbonara, the other got a special with lobster, butternut squash and pasta. While the lobster dish was tasty, it could have used more lobster and the butternut squash was a little out of place. With that being said, it was still absolutely delicious (just personal preference on taste) and the carbonara dish was out of this world!  \\nFor dessert we had the special which was a butterscotch/caramel pudding/torte type of dessert. I had called ahead and pre-ordered a tiramisu for my husband's birthday and figured they forgot when we were offered dessert; but the most impressive part of the meal is when the server came over with a candle in our dessert. Not only remembered, but wished my husband a genuine Happy Birthday and thanked us for coming.\\nEverything was absolute perfection!  The only problem is that the menu is big and this place is within walking distance...which means we will be back, often.

This, however, will not deter me from eating there every chance i get.  I do believe it is worth every penny.Excellent food and cool ambiance aside, there is one other outstanding feature that deserves recognition - the customer service.  In a city where courteous service can be hard to come by, it was comforting to be welcomed by the very friendly staff.

They had a pre-opening this evening, but are targeting late September to complete the fit out of the space.Today they have a flowing space from the entry to the hotel registration deck on 9th, around towards the Burnside face and up the stairs to a large sparse conversational space, a large outdoor deck, a large multipurpose room and an elegant conference room. The main floor has the requisite open hearth gas fireplace, some seating with wobbly micro-tables and a bar. There is also a kitchen which doubles as their catering kitchen for events in the spaces up the stairs. The furniture is modern and they have commissioned some tree silhouette-themed art for the walls. Of course the hotel desk carries forward with the tree-ringed fir slabs found in the Doug Fir lounge. It is a little more minimal than the Skylab Jupiter lobby. It reads well with honest materials. It may become a gathering place for the design businesses of lower Burnside - LoBu. That would include occupants of the 811 Building, BSide6/Slate Buildings, the Skylab Death Star and lower Stark - LoStar - including ADX, Uncorked, and many more.

We called ahead, and ended up showing a bit early for our pizzas. In fact, they hadn't even started cooking yet. Turns out they can only make one pizza at a time in the oven. The guy behind the counter was friendly, asked which pizza was our favorite and I told him it was our first time visiting. \\"Ohhh Bono Virgins, right on, man!\\" Dude was cool. Um, can we hang out?He asks if we want to peek over the counter to watch him cook our pizzas. Well, of course we do. He explains the process of cooking them in the oven, how he has to let it sit for the first 45 seconds to cook the bottom, rotate it, etc. I was amazed at how quickly they cooked. I guess 1800¬∫ will do that. He told us the history of the space, how they found it and a little about how they operate. 15 minutes later we were out the door with our pizzas. We get home, I dive in. SO SO SO good. the fresh mozzarella on the top was a nice change from typical pizza places. We tried the Pepperoni Sausage (San Rolando, #2), the Veggie (Verdura, #4) and the Mushroom (Funghi, #12). All were delicious in their own right. For as much as I love veggies, I think the Pep/Sausage was my fave. Layers of perfectly crisped pepperoni and tiny crumbly bits of sausage that had big flavor. Sold. Pizzas are $10 each or three for $25 - an incredible deal for the quality and toppings you're getting. There's a counter with about 4 seats and a couple of small tables, but this isn't really a dine-in place. They don't have drinks, but you can grab some from the convenience store if you want. Bono may have just become my go-to favorite pizza for lazy nights at home. Or, any night really.*Worth noting, he asked how I had heard of them and I said Yelp. He told me the Yelp community has been awesome for their business and he's really grateful for all of the reviews and photos. See, Yelp really DOES help small biz!

The hotel shares a lot of its outside space with the Ritz Carlton next door. I think they both share some pools and the golf course. Either way, the property is lushly landscaped and very grand feeling. It's a fabulous little getaway and I recommend it highly. I'm not sure exactly how convenient it is to the parks, but it seemed to be reasonably close to everything. The hotel has several restaurants on site, in addition to really great room service.

The food has mostly been very tasty and delicious.  If you've never been here, basically it's a cooking school where the students not only cook your food but also serve you as well.  You have to make reservations and there's only set times for both lunch and dinner.  You have to be patient with the service because they are learning students.  I have to say that for the quality and multi courses of the food, the price is a fraction of what you would pay at any fine dining/upscale restaurant in town!\\nThe split pea soup was surprisingly tasty.  It was a bit thick, and the pork belly was delicious!  I'm not a fan of split pea, but it was good.  The shrimp and grits was delicious!  First time having cheesy grits and I'm a fan now!!   Everything was cooked perfectly.  If plate licking was allowed, I would have done it!  Highly recommend this place.

And yes it was well worth the trip.\\nWe started the meal with a spicy krab bao bun. The bun was toasted to give a feeling of a lobster roll especially when dipped in the drawn butter it was served with. It had nice flavor with just a hint of spice (at least according to my heat level). \\nThen we reviewed the extensive menu. It was a hard decision. They offered a wide selection including burgers, donuts, burritos and pizza yes and all of those are sushi options. \\nI went with a krab donut and a sushi burger.\\nThe donut was typical sushi in a awesome presentation of a donut. It had sushi rice topped with fish eggs, raw tuna and salmon as well as avocado. Then the donut was stuffed with krab meat and served on a square of nori. It was a great combo of flavors and textures. \\nNext I went big and went for the sushi burger. I went with the fried panko breaded rice bun. Then it was topped with spicy salmon, seaweed salad, cucumbers, spicy mayo and eel sauce. I added spicy crab to make it one epic burger. The burger is massive and I couldnt even fit one bun fully in my mouth. Good thing they serve with a knife and fork because that is the only way to eat this masterpiece. They usually serve the bun as just rice but I loved the panko breaded bun the warm bun served with the raw toppings was a great combo. \\nMy family also enjoyed their specialty rolls and spicy tuna burrito.

Well, then let's get started! I like to go here on Mondays around 2pm, I've tried to stop in on other days and other times and the wait is so long that I'm overcome with hanger and move on to a place where I know I won't wait. If you don't suffer from hangriness, then it might be worth the wait. The first time I stepped foot into moonshine was the day after my birthday, a fine October Wednesday afternoon. A few of my friends and I were so hung over and STARVATING- that's starving and salivating if you didn't already know. Now! We were sure in for a treat, but didn't know much what to expect. Being the food whore that I am, I pretty much ordered half the menu on my own. Yes, I ate every last morsel!We started off with shrimp corn dogs, while those were getting battered and fried up, we had some of that delicious popcorn that they give to hangry guests to calm the nerves. As soon as the shrimp corn dogs came out 2 of my friends burned their mouthed them, so be careful... I knew better. I waited. They serve them with FABULOUS dipping sauce. This was my first mouthgasm in a while. We then ordered our entrees and sides. Honestly, I found the green chile Mac n cheese to be a bit bland. On the bright side, I ordered the pimento Mac n cheese and it was slap yo' mama worthy. The real treat for me on this beautiful fall day was the gotdarn meatloaf! Son of a bench! It's the best I've ever eaten! I mixed it with mashed potatoes, bite after blissful bite! I ate to my heart's desire that day, and I have no single regret! Just thinking about the food here makes me wanna get naked and run down the street, yelling its praises. Instead, I decided to Yelp the hell out of it!Bottom line, get valet, go on a weekday afternoon, screw brunch, sit by the window, and enjoy."},{"name":"Austin Tea Xchange Cafe","address":"13011 Shops Pkwy, Ste 600","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"This place is so good!

If you are expecting melt-in-you-mouth sashimi and rolls you will need to go somewhere else. BUT with that said Kiku is my go-to sushi ROLL craving restaurant.  I don't know what they put on their rolls, but I'm a bit addicted to the spicy sauce they put on top of the rolls.  Yum! They offer half-off sushi rolls every day of the week. Basically, they should just cut the price is half, but it is a good marketing idea.  I usually order two rolls. That will usually leave me stuffed and wishing I wore my stretchy yoga pants. There are SO many rolls to choose from and there is a booklet of pictures so you are not left wondering what it will look like while reading the long list of ingredients. I tend to get the flaming joy, hot night, or lenox rolls.  For those of you who are big Japanese restaurant people, you already know that Japanese restaurants can get kind of pricey.

The fried shrimp was my least favorite of the assortment, which put the rice and General Tso chicken as the top favorites of the dish.

I am of Asian descent, and I can honestly say that the restaurants around here are in no way authentic, to put it nicely (and not offend anyone).The first time we came here, we had to wait due to it being so busy and packed.  Starved and intoxicated with the lingering smell of Chinese food, it didn't help that there were roasted ducks and a pig hanging on a rack tempting us near the waiting area.  Finally, we were seated...Din Ho has a multitude of entrees to choose from.  There's even a menu on the wall written in Chinese.  I wish I can decipher what it says.. maybe it even offers meals \\"off the menu.\\"  But, I'm content with what the regular menu has to offer.  What I did notice is that the waiters do not play around... patience is definitely not a virtue here.  We were asked by 4 different wait staff what we wanted to order in a span of 5 minutes.  Feeling rushed, we just ordered whatever caught our eye.  Our food came out quickly, and everything was so good.My second visit, the food was equally as good.  But, this time I went on a weekday and it was much more serene.  Our waiter was very patient.  It was also very nice of him to pack our food in a box with a bag of ice knowing that we were going to be in Austin for a bit and having to drive an hour back home.

I love this place because it is equally as good for special occasions as it is for a casual drink.\\nWalking through the revolving doors at Mitchell's is like going back in to a time where the supper club trumped the dance club. Elegant dining on white table cloth tables where the place settings could pass for art. The bathroom alcove has a black and white photo section of famous guests who have dined here that is reminiscent of Elaine's in New York. The staff is incredible with attention to your details from the moment you walk in the front door to the closing of your car door as you leave. \\nAnd the food... oh the food. \\nMitchell's is a steakhouse, and they do it right. I always get the filet no matter how long I peruse the menu looking for something else. Mitchell's is one of the few places that you can order a steak medium and actually get the correct temperature. For those people who don't like steak, the sea bass and lamb are also very good. Mitchell's has sides to order a la carte. I love the truffle mac and cheese and the fancy green beans. My friend swears by the potato au gratin, but between you and me, I have better taste. You should also try the lobster bisque. Just get a cup because the bowl is not going to leave you any room for anything else. The cheesecake is my favorite desert, but the lava cake is good too.\\nFor special occasions I recommend Trevor as your server. Knowledgeable about the menu and especially impressive with his knowledge of champagne. Trevor always takes great care of me and also creates the restaurant's play list. \\nFor bar service, try to go in on a night when Matt is there. He is funny and gregarious. If you are eating alone, Matt will keep you company and laughing. Don't shun the bar. On a Friday or Saturday the bar can be more crowded than the actual restaurant. The bar with a bowl of bisque, the chop salad and a few drinks is a great way to eat here without spending tons of cash. Jeans are perfectly acceptable for eating at Mitchell's bar.\\nMake sure you valet, and try Mitchell's. Its not just for special occasions, but it makes every occasion special."},{"name":"C&S Seafood & Oyster Bar","address":"3240 Cobb Pkwy SE, Ste 118","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Wonderful experience, food, service, and attentiveness could not have been better, thank you Kevin. We were in town for a milestone birthday celebration for my Mom, the hotel made reservations in Buckhead and did not recommend C&S, but the Waverly needs to reconsider that because these guys literally knocked it out of the park. The one standing caveat for dinner was that the restaurant must have white tablecloth service, check! That eliminated 98% of the restaurants in town and we were fortunate to find this place just a few minutes from the hotel. I called on Saturday afternoon to reserve a table for 8, and they were booked but were happy to accommodate our party and squeeze us in.  We were seated at a perfect round 8 top in the back near the retail fish/oyster counter, my Mom could not have been more pleased. The menu was exactly what we were looking for, mostly seafood with a few steaks and some creative appetizers and sides mixed in. We settled on raw oysters and made a special request for some fried oysters, not on the menu, for the birthday girl. They were perfect, and that was some of the best cocktail sauce I've ever had...honestly don't know how they did that because there was no visible horseradish in the mix but it was delicious, and hot. They were happy to split a wedge for each of us in the kitchen and the homemade blue cheese was superb. At this point I should tell you that this was already one of the best services that I've experienced in years, and nobody was tag teaming our table, Kevin handled everything, the guy is a magician. Somebody at our table commented that the food sure was coming out fast and a passing waiter stopped and asked \\"Sir, is it coming out too fast?\\" No, we weren't complaining, the efficiency was something to behold. Oh yeah, the bread service... homemade Sourdough and raisin bread... yes raisin bread with whipped butter....my mom got an extra order of that packed up to take back and show off to Bridge Club. Thats the best Sourdough I've had since my last trip through SFO. Soon the apps and remnants of the oysters were cleared and our entree's arrived, the presentation was spectacular. Everybody was craning their necks doing that \\"Oooh what'd you get?\\" My Mom is usually 5/4 in Vegas to order crab cakes, but she was so pleased with the overall experience she decided to order the special, crab stuffed shrimp with dirty rice and fried okra... she was very happy with her dish... we all were. And the big surprise was that my daughter's filet was one of the best steaks I've had in a while. Never would have believed that.C&S and Kevin came through with 5* bread pudding and key lime pie with ice cream all around for desert, compliments of the house, Mom was even serenaded with a traditional Happy Birthday song. I don't think there is any possibility she could have enjoyed herself any more than she did. Oh, and I have to mention the entire staff here was wonderful... randomly they kept getting photo requests and they all took time to oblige... and with a smile on their face. We all loved C&S and took turns shaking Kevin's hand and complimenting him on the way out the door. Give that man a raise! We'll be back, thank you, it was phenomenal."},{"name":"G-Love","address":"1615 NW 21st Ave Portland Or","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Food and cocktails were excellent.

Knight Moves is literally board game heaven and if it were big enough, I'd probably move in.We went on a Friday night and it was love at first sight-of-mountains-upon-mountains-of-board-games. They have everything from my favorite strategy games, such as Settlers of Catan (and all the expansions) and Puerto Rico, to games that I play with kids when I babysit, such as the card game Sleeping Queens. If there's a game you want to play, they probably have it, and even if they didn't, they'd pick one out for you based on what you like and teach it to you and you'd have fun anyway. The only potential hole I could see (but didn't confirm) in their collection would be vintage games such as Operation or Guess Who, but who knows, they might have those too!This is how it works: You show up, pay $10/person, and play for as long as you want, literally. According to their website, you can even leave for a few hours, return and play, leave for another few hours, and resume playing without having to pay another $10--you're covered for the whole day. The staff are all super friendly and have mastered the art of concisely explaining a complex board game. You can BYOB or you can buy some coffee and pastries. I can't speak to how good they are because I didn't order any but while we were there, there were even two patrons who were apparently just there for the coffee and presumably the ambience of other-people-playing-board-games--the possibilities are endless.The only downside is that the space is undeniably small--with only roughly 10 table surfaces, all of which are on the smaller size, I foresee them becoming too awesome for their own good before long."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I paid my first visit to Powell's Bookstore during my most recent trip to Oregon. Needless to say, my friends and I spent two hours in that crazy, crowded, chaotic store, but if we didn't have dinner reservations, I probably could have spent two more hours there.\\n \\nPowell's is famous not only because they have STORIES of books--both old (used) and new--but also because the bookstore is open 24/7. So yes, you can actually stay and read and peruse the extensive book selection late into the night or into the wee hours of the morning and no one will kick you out.\\n \\nSince Powell's is in Downtown Portland, finding a parking can be quite difficult. When we went on a Saturday mid-afternoon, it probably took us 20 or so minutes to find a decent spot. We were still a few blocks from the bookstore, but at that point, we didn't mind walking ... but since it was raining, we just didn't want a super far walk.\\n \\nGoing to Powell's can definitely be overwhelming if it's your first visit (and, according to my friend who lives in Oregon, it's still overwhelming, even though she's been there several times). Because the bookstore is a famous destination, there's literally crowds of people wherever you go--at the Caf√©, sitting at tables, perusing bookshelves, in the checkout line. My advice would be to treat your Powell's experience as if you're heading into Black Friday shopping (at least, based on my experience from that weekend): expect a major crowd, don't be in a hurry (because it'll be hard to get in and out of there quickly) and don't expect to find exactly what you want (if you're searching for a particular book) quickly.\\n \\nI completely didn't know where I was, regarding the different sections of the store, but my friends and I agreed to split up and then meet back at the Caf√© entrance (where we entered the store) in two hours. The different sections of the bookstore are color-coded according to genre. I'm basically writing this review, though, because I found the Powell's staff to be completely helpful! With a bookstore of this size, staff who know how to find things are crucial! I enlisted the help of two different people to find two books I was looking for (since they were in different sections of the store), and both staff members were really helpful and were able to direct me to the appropriate place to find my reading material. Even though Powell's is a bookstore, it almost reminded me of a library at the same time ... they have help desks located all around the store, so you can easily find a staff member if you're having trouble finding something specific.\\n \\nBesides the different book sections (obviously), I think my favorite part of the store was near the main entrance, where you can find Powell's logoed gear. Whether you want mugs, shirts, cups or bags, you can find a great assortment of Powell's merchandise in this section. I ended up getting a cup that I really wanted--one of the glass ones that show all of Oregon's major landmarks (I really liked the cup because it include both Voodoo Doughnuts and Powell's on there)--in addition to my two books. I was just fortunate that one of the books I wanted was used, so I didn't up spending too much on it.\\n \\nIf you're in Portland for the first time and have an appreciation for books, I would highly recommend visiting Powell's. Of course, depending on the time you go, you may have a completely different experience than me. I anticipated the large crowds and claustrophobia, so I wasn't really bothered, but I would have preferred to come later at night or earlier in the morning (on a weekday) so perhaps it would be easier to navigate my way through the store and not have to struggle so much to find parking. But visiting this bookstore is definitely worth your while, and if you still love reading physical books from cover to cover, this would easily be one of the highlights of any trek to Portland."},{"name":"Meson Sandwiches","address":"6622 Eagle Watch Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Meson Egg Omelet Sandwich is LiT!!!

We started off with drinks (I had the espresso martini because the waiter swore by it; lived up to the hype! It was very tasty and strong) For our meals we got the chicken parm & filet mignon. I have to say and I can't seem to rave enough about it, the steak was PERFECTLY COOKED. I am so anal when it comes to ordering steak because I love it medium rare and some places that don't usually \\"specialize\\" in steaks would overcook it and it just ruins my dining experience. Our waiter told me that it will come out perfectly cooked or he will pay for the steak out of his paycheck. That confidence definitely sold me! No regrets, I was so happy cutting into it when it first came out. It came with mushroom risotto and sauteed spinach. My only gripe was the risotto. It was still good but it wasn't so much risotto as it was just rice with mushrooms and the sauce. My boyfriend absolutely loved the chicken parm! Overall we had a great dining experience. They played Sinatra overhead and I was ecstatic; I always play Sinatra while I cook at home so that was pleasant to listen to. I loved the vibe. Our server, Gustavo was a doll.

For fun I threw in an order for a frozen margarita but couldn't decide between the strawberry and the cactus flavor so the server suggested that I get the two flavored swirled - what a fantastic idea!The queso compuesta was just as delicious as a remember it and was a hit at the table.  My seventeen year old loved the fresh salsa at the table and my thirteen year old niece loved the jalapeno ranch.

My friends would literally drive down to Portland just for those wings. Don't get me wrong, it's damn good, but you gotta learn that Pokpok is soooo much more than that! Next time you go, try the Muu Paa Kham Wan. It's boar collar meat grilled and served with a salty soury sauce of lemongrass chili and other spices. It is the most amazing thing on the menu. It's a little spicy (they say it's the spiciest thing on the menu) so be careful if you can't stand heat, but it goes perfectly with their sticky rice, which is just a little bit sweet, and their Thai iced tea. Yum! Another great thing on the menu is their Khao Soi. Omg! The broth is thick and flavorful. The egg noodles are fresh and chewy. Can't get any better than that. I came there once after a happy hour, but I still finished the Khao Soi because it was soooo damn good. Honestly, other things that I have tried at Pokpok are also good.

I managed to only buy 2 books, at a fairly reasonable price. It isn't the cheapest bookstore out there, but again, the sheer variety is something to marvel at.With all the ladders strewn around, you might think that there'd be some liability involved, but people just go for it when trying to reach for those high shelves.

Sauces, sides, salads and desserts are also featured on the menu.Excellent flavor overall and you can clearly tell and taste that these are hand-rolled and very fresh, as if you don't already know that simply by the attitude of Jeff and his employees.My only complaint is that Jeff did not invite me back for their official grand opening event later the same evening!

More memorably--my favorite was the ceviche. OMG yum. It was basically chopped pieces of octopus, clam, and mussels tossed with brightly colored peppers for that added crunch.Nothing on the hot bar really appealed to me. I saw the \\"ginger fish\\" which was picked dry and not replaced. Meh. They had a dish called \\"dynamite\\" which was too creamy for me...but the concept behind it was great (blend of imitation crab and baby clams). Dessert was minimal. Cream puffs, fruit (melon and cantalope), jello, and a couple of small bite size pastries. There was a soft serve machine as well that oozed out green tea ice cream or vanilla. The green tea ice cream was EXTREMELY powdery ish tasting.Overall, I enjoyed the AYCE sushi and would come again. The decor inside is clean, and modern. Not super \\"romantic\\" but a good date spot.

I did, and do, appreciate the offer and the message, though.  It's always nice when a business genuinely wants to improve and have a dialogue with its customers.Which is why it pains me to write this update - but I feel I have to tell it like I taste it.The other night, I found myself in Spud Brothers sandwiched between two guys who wanted to eat.  I wasn't that hungry (had just eaten a huge plate of drunken noodles), so I didn't order, but took liberal helpings from each of their plates (thanks, guys!).  One of them got the Thai'd up, and the other got the spicy Italian sausage.Thai'd up:\\nAs always, the fries themselves were great.  Slightly crispy, salty, tasty french fries.  It's the sauce that made me 'eek'.  It had the same 'freezer' taste as before... but much stronger... you know, that stale, shut-in, almost moldy taste that accompanies things that have either passed their expiry date or are loaded with preservatives that keep them from HAVING an expiry date.  Had it been my dish, I would have probably returned it.It was unclear how fresh the vegetables or the chicken were because everything was drenched in that appalling sauce.Spicy Italian Sausage:\\nNeither spicy nor with any discernable Italian herbs, I could only call this a sausage, and a dull one at that.  The bread was stale-ish, and the whole thing was only saved by the mustard, a grainy brown complex concoction.Mango Tea:\\nTasted exactly like what I imagine Mango PineSol would taste like.I'm sorry, Spud Brothers.

Nice taste in decor, tables, flooring, walls, bar, and small touches!  5/5-Our server was John.  When we asked questions on the menu, he had no clue.  He stated it was his 2nd shift.  Cool, but why not invest in training of the staff?  Judging from his service, I'm going to assume he's never served before as well, because he had no clue.  He did weird things such as when we took a bite of our bread, he stopped by the table and took our left over half bun off of our plates, in his hand and walked away with it.... weird!  We weren't done with it, why would you grab it off my plate with your hands and leave with it? -I ordered Shrimp Scampi Pasta - Sauce tasted amazing, dish was served barely warm.  And portion size was tiny.  When it was delivered, I looked at John and told him I ordered the dinner portion, not the lunch portion.  I suggest adding more pasta to dish so it at least gives you a meal.  5 nice size shrimp, tasted great, but Luke warm and portion size was mini me.  I'm not a big guy, but I left hungry!  Looked like a nice menu and fair pricing though, but I don't have enough to fill me up, it's not worth it.My guest ordered chicken parm.  Again it was luke  warm, good portion size, but sauce tasted canned.  It was the runny, thin, sweet, can tasting sauce.  I've grown up with my family owning numerous Italian restaurants, I love the thick, hardy, homemade sauces.  If not canned, just wasn't to my liking.Grato's definitely has potential, and I know they just opened recently, so I hope they work out the kinks so I can become a regular, but not sure i am coming back.  My best suggestion would be for the owner to visit the tables, I would have been happy to have given her the opportunity to fix things.  Our server was lacking the skills and knowledge to do a good job and remedy any of my complaints, matter of fact he found it funny, and just kept joking about it when he came to the table...asking how is your Luke warm lunch portion shrimp scampi...as he grabbed my half eaten bun off my plate and walked away.  I felt like I was in the twilight zone!  I will say looking around, and noticing the other servers clearing our empty plates, and demeanor at other tables, looking at the rest of the staff, they seemed more \\"on the ball\\" with things than our server.

It's accompanied by roasted potatoes which are cubed meaty potato chunks with whole roasted cloves of garlic.  So bring a breakfast date that you're not fearful of offending if you go that route.Prices match the portions are large enough so that I can eat my way to a food-coma stupor but not so large that I have to be carted away by friends.

Also, I've never been to a bookstore that had so many comics, anime, and graphic novels available to read and browse.

The only complaint I'd have is that their bathroom is absolutely horrible. There was only two stalls and two urinals, leading to a huge lines.

Hae Woon Dae is more traditional in the sense its low key in ambiance aka, it doesn't really have any. It's very unassuming from the front and funny enough I took pictures inside similar to my visit from 5 years ago and they looked the same!  While we were in there it was pretty quiet and I think two other groups were in there. They were playing K-pop on the TV. Customer service was great. We were greeted right away and the food came out pretty quick. And by food I mean the banchan which is by far my favorite part of Korean food. We were given Kimchi (3 Stars), potato salad (3 Stars), radish (4 stars), fermented seaweed (4 stars), bean sprouts ( 3 stars), and some other greens which were the best out of all of them. We also were given rice and a bowl of greens along with soybean paste and sesame seed oil mixed with salt and pepper.  Out of three of us two ordered the BBQ , Bul Gogi and Pork Bacon. There is not all you can eat option here folks so order wisely. The Bul Gogi was delicious and it was a nice portion size to share. The pork I believe was half frozen so it didn't really have the best flavor as it cooked. Some onions were added with it but it was just okay and a smaller portion.  My third friend ordered the Bibimbap which he enjoyed and our server even came over and helped him stir it up, which was a bit funny.   The grill is a charcoal grill and no fancy updraft system. \\nThe best part of Hae Woon Dae is that is is open late night, so if you are out an about and want some late night Korean food, you have this option on Buford Highway.

Since it was early, we opted for the \\"brunchiest\\" option on the menu: chicken and waffles with a side of bacon. Pass on the bacon because the chicken and waffles is delicious and has a very large serving, with a plate-sized cornmeal waffle and 4 large chunks of fried chicken. It also comes with bitter, maple syrup and a tasty chipotle gravy, plus cornbread muffins.

A fantastic sushi burrito has finally landed in the Boston area! For $10.25, you get a sushi burrito filled with warm rice, thin strips of cucumber, avocado, a crunchy leaf of lettuce, flying fish roe, and seaweed salad wrapped in a crisp nori skin. You get a choice of protein: shrimp tempura, salmon, tuna, yellow tail, eel, or chashu. You also get a choice of sauce to flavor your sushi burrito: miso mustard, wasabi mayo, eel sauce, or spicy mayo. The sushi burrito definitely tastes like it's made-to-order and contains generous cuts of sushi-grade fish inside. My current favorite is salmon and eel sauce. I'm also intrigued by the miso mustard and I want to try the yellowtail as well. But it's so hard to order something new to try when I am so in love with my current order! I love that they threw seaweed salad in the mix and love how customizable it is. Clearly, I cannot say enough positive things about it!Other things we've had at Hakata Ramen:\\n+ Gyoza ($4.50 for 5 pcs) - Solid but nothing to write home about.\\n+ Chashu Don ($8.50) - A friend ordered this and let us try a bite. Great flavor! We imagine the sushi burrito version of this would be quite delicious!\\n+ Yellowtail Don ($12.95) - A friend ordered this and really enjoyed it. See photo below.\\n+ Tiger Maki ($12.95) - Sounded amazing and tasted good but not blown away enough to reorder when there's so many other yummy things I want.\\n- Katsu Lunch Bento ($7.50) - The most lackluster of all the things we tried. The katsu itself was just meh and the bento was a little skimpy--it only came with 3 pieces of California maki, soup, and salad. No pair of gyoza or shumai, which I feel like is standard fare for a bento box. My fianc√© was still hungry after finishing this.A couple of logistical notes: Hakata Ramen is a relatively small restaurant and can seat roughly 22 people. Service was attentive and accommodating.There are so many things I want to try on the menu: the chirashi and yellowtail don, their weekday lunch ramen and mini-don special, their reasonably priced nigiri, and of course, more burritos! Needless to say, I'll definitely be returning--possibly weekly to get my sushi burrito fix![Update: 3/11/17]I'd been rethinking my original 5 star rating since I discovered a new favorite sushi burrito place but today I felt compelled to finally take off a star. We ordered delivery from Hakata (as we've come to often do on Saturdays) and instead of our order of a salmon burrito with eel sauce, they delivered us an eel burrito. We called to ask them for either a refund for that burrito or an exchange and they said they could bring us the correct burrito. After 10 minutes (at which point we had already given the incorrect eel burrito away), they called us back to ask us to return the eel burrito. It kind of makes sense if we were eating in the restaurant but felt a little petty and possibly sketchy for delivery--did they want it back to throw away or to resell to someone else? We ended up just dropping it since we couldn't return the eel burrito. Service here definitely doesn't warrant 5 stars."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"6240 E Broad St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"I have gone here twice on my lunch break from work.

The gnocchi were perfect little pillows of light fluffy potato nestled in perfectly reduced chicken stock. They were topped with shaved parm and earthy truffles. I could have eaten another pound of them no problem! The runner up was one of the dessert courses.... cherry cheesecake . The bottom was this almond brittle crumble that was the perfect balance of salty and sweet. On top of the crumble was a delicate liquified cheesecake and that was then topped with a cherry granita. I wish I could have this dessert every day and I'm not even a big fan or cherry or almond. Veritas is definitely a splurge but should be  at the top of your Columbus restaurant bucket list."},{"name":"Sushi Sakura","address":"506 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"This sushi place is Amazing!\\nI went in there with my friends the other day, and it was pretty legit. \\nThe service was great, and the food was even better. there conveyor belt was cool, and the rolls were made pretty fresh! \\nThe price is reasonable, i had 10 plates for less than $13 bucks!\\nThe place was nice;y decorated. it's the BEST sushi place ever!!!! \\nAnyone would love it.

As we walked around after a game looking for a place to eat dinner, every where we checked had a 40+ minute wait. Walked in Burger IM and it was about 1/3 full. Decided to give it a shot without looking up reviews because I thought I had heard good things about it... turns out the name just sounds eerily familiar to other new hip burger joints. Anyway, there were four of us. We all ordered either the two or three slider meals. Two of us upgraded to the Wagyu beef patties. Computer asked me to enter a tip as we placed the order, which I did. Now I wish I had waited and just tipped with cash. Lesson learned. Anyway, total for 4 people was over $70 with tip for a fast-casual burger joint. We were expecting some pretty good burgers.We waited. And waited. And waited. 45-50 minutes later our food started trickling out of the kitchen. One order. Then another. Then a third. Finally, more than 5 minutes after the first order came out, the last (mine) hit the table. The regular french fries were more like thick cut chips, and were more \\"boiled in oil\\" than fried. They were soggy, cold, and flavorless. The sweet potato fries were cooked well and tasted great - really wish I had gotten them instead. The burgers were \\"meh.\\" I expected a lot more out of \\"Wagyu\\" beef. The sliders were much thinner than the marketing photos... probably just cooked too fast. They were charred on the outside, a little bland, and the buns were hard. Very disappointing after such a long wait and steep price tag. I can forgive one or two issues but to have so much go wrong at my first Burger IM experience... not interested in trying it again."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"If you see a line more than four groups, leave!

That's because Portland is bursting with pride about Powell's.  The whole city adores the massive independent bookstore that has become a landmark both downtown and on Hawthorne.  It remains peerless in size, selection, and price; I always appreciate that the used books and the new books are shelved side by side in any given selection.  When downton, head to the top floor to browse the current art exhibit (this is the space where frequent readings and talks with notable authors are held) and next, check out the Rare Book Room.  The logic behind the pricing of these apparent gems is beyond me, but in this room you can look at old books and try to fathom forking over thousands of dollars for a book.  Powell's Hawthorne location is smaller, but still harbors a fantastic collection of new and used books and hosts its own schedule of visiting authors.  Two doors down on Hawthorne is the Powells Home and Garden store--you're destination for cook books, crafting books, gardening books, and trinkets.  Those in the suburbs are kept happy by the Beaverton store, and those Portlanders who have moved to other places can continue to shop online at www.powells.com .

I actually had to call and ask as I had belly aches after eating, and that's the usual suspect with Chinese food.  I guess the new management has made the adjustment as they didn't use it until recently.We ordered Veg Chop Suey, Szechuan Beef Broccoli, and House Chow Mein.  First observation... 75% Broccoli in the chop suey and chow mein (and I like broccoli).  However, I already had ordered a broccoli dish, and then everything else was served with so much broccoli...it got tired fast.  The veg chop suey literally came with small cuts consisting of 3 cauliflower, 3 carrot, 3 small bok choy, 6 cuts of celery, and at least 25 broccoli.  I guess between all 3 dishes we ordered steamed, flavourless broccoli for dinner.  At least I didn't get a stomach ache this time!Which leads me back to the other issue...no flavour without MSG.  That is, if you ask for no MSG you are also getting no flavour.  Everything just tasted steamed.  The Szechuan Beef Broccoli really had no flavour aside from the heat of the chilli sauce, and very little from the lame garlic they use.  It looked like there were at least 2 tablespoons of garlic in the dish, but I could eat 10 chunks before I even got a hint that it was garlic... must be cheap garlic from a jar?  It was unfortunate that the only flavour we had was the Soy Sauce they sent us.In summary, if you like flavour, don't remove the MSG...that's all they have flavouring the dishes.  If you want broccoli for dinner, order anything that comes with veg... but seriously, only order 1 veg dish unless you absolutely LOVE broccoli to no end!Off to try the next Chinese restaurant in our neighbourhood...what's left?

So...bottom line, you get what you pay for. Food: \\nI was pretty happy with my creamed corn soup, the salad was not bad either, my main entree of salmon tasted good, but there just wasn't enough of it for me to be satisfied, and my dessert of angel food cake was decent. Overall, the food wasn't bad, I just didn't think I got enough of it. Ambiance: \\nIt's a almost classy, romantic feel to the decor, which is nice if you are on a date night or a classy girl's night out. There are huge windows to look out at the street so you can people watch. There's also an open kitchen, so you can peek over to see what the students are doing. I would say it's on the average, quiet side for noise level. Service: \\nJust like the food is by students, so is the service. I wouldn't say the service is bad, but I've had better. It just seemed like it could have been a little more organized and efficient. Don't get me wrong, everyone was VERY nice and courteous, but it just seemed a little scattered. Our waitress would come over and seem like she wanted to take our order (she had her pen and pad ready) but then excuse herself and walk away. Then she would come back later and take just our drink order. Then she would serve us water and leave. Then she would come back with our drinks. Then she would come back later to take our orders...you get the point...Price: \\nCheap! For a four course meal, $18 dollars is not bad! But considering the portion size, it might not be enough food....so take that into consideration. Overall: \\nIt was an interesting dining experience, but because Portland has so many other restaurant and options and I just wasn't impressed with my visit, I don't think I'll come back.

Last night my friends and I went here for my friend's 30th birthday. We were a party of 10 and called to make sure they were open, since it was a holiday. They were and we asked if there was room for 10 people. After being scolded for not making a reservation, my friend asked if they were busy or something. They weren't. In fact, when we got there, we had an entire room to ourselves, which was pretty cool. So after a long wait the waitress took our drink orders. This place only has vodka, wine and beer, so don't go looking for Mai Tais or scorpion bowls. The menu is pricier than what you're probably used to, comparatively (sushi regular was $16 and some change). When we ordered, she took our order but began to walk away without taking one person's order. We got her to come back, she took his order, and all was fine.First, my friends BBQ came out. We watched as they cooked their food. Pretty cool! Then, some cooked entrees came out. After a long wait, my friend's sushi came out. Now it was just me and my friend Dave waiting for our food. Everyone was about finished and then the waitress came out and said they didn't have my food at all. She said it with no care at all. Just very matter of fact. I said, \\"Ok, so... I'm just not eating???\\" And she walked away and came back with a menu and told me to pick something else. I was perplexed. I asked why they didn't have my food. She said it was because the maki I ordered had avocado in it and they ran out. So, she waited till everyone was DONE eating to tell me they didn't have what I ordered. So I ordered something else, but was very very upset with how I was treated. She sincerely didn't care. After a few minutes, my friend Dave asked where his food was, and she said they didn't have it. They never even told him. So he ordered something else and was equally as annoyed as I was. In fact, my friends asked the waitress to take one of my beers off of the bill, which she did, but she had to be asked. No apologies or anything. When I finally got my sushi, the tuna tasted and was the consistency of tuna that had been frozen for quite a long time and was not very fresh at all. In fact, it was a drab very light red/almost purple. The rest of the fish was fine, but I've literally never had tuna that was old served to me in a restaurant. When we finally got the bill, the waitress added the gratuity, as some places do for large parties. I felt like this was not acceptable given the poor service and quality of food we were given. While we were paying, one member of the staff came over and slammed the door to the room closed (it was propped open the whole time) in a rude way, as if to say they didn't want to hear us. All in all, I don't think I've ever had such poor service. It would be one thing if the food was good and relatively inexpensive, but this was not at all the case.

I will say, I get everything can't always run smoothly. I get that this place is right across the street from Piedmont Park and it was during the Dogwood Festival.  What I don't get is the response I received from the staff. I get to the restaurant with two of my friends and its packed with an hour wait.  Well we hung out by the bar and got some seats and decided to order food at the bar. To sum it up:1. For some reason, I was the third wheel for the bartender because I had to wait, and wait to order my drink. And when I did guess what? he forgot it.  When I reminded him, he chuckled and said , \\"I just told someone I know I forgot someone's drink hahaha\\". Sir, that's not really that funny. Because if that's what you think you did you should survey your customers sitting at the bar and refresh your memory. 1. At the bar people come, people go. Two of us ordered tater tots. Tater tots that's it. The other order was a burger.  I not only waited an hour and a half for tater tots, I watched three other people who came AFTER me get their order of tater tots.  Again I get they were busy. But when we mentioned it to the bartender, because of course he never came to apologize or advise us things were backed up, he said \\" Oh don't you worry, they are coming. They will be here, hahaha.\\" Sir, you are A. having too much fun while I'm hungry and B. You are having to much fun with your coworkers when you are technically working. And if they are so backed up everyone else should be hungry.  Nope just us. 3. At the hour and a half mark I got up and found a manager, Jack Pottage. I explained that while I understand they are busy, my main concern is that others around me seem to be eating the exact same thing I ordered and they arrived after me. I almost asked was there a call ahead number I should familiarize myself with, but he seemed to be just as busy as everyone else. He apologized and I also advised that while I searched for him,  the food had come out, but it was completely unacceptable we were left sitting there in tater tot limbo.  He apologized and motioned to the bartender that we should be taken care of. \\n4. Finally eating, my lukewarm tater tots, the bartender rings us up.

It's truly a place of magic and fantasy; and if you're planning on visiting make sure to give yourself plenty of time and/or opportunities to stop in.

And one very baffling aspect of the menu is that most of the dishes are served with French fries. What? In a city like Austin where amazing Mexican food is just a stone's throw away, there is no excuse whatsoever for a restaurant to make bland Mexican food. We are pretty disappointed, because this place is a very short distance to our house.

The papaya salad was so spicy I needed to order a thai tea to tone it down. I didn't have much of the Khoi Soi but it was also delicious.

I of course, obliged, as I'm always in the hunt for oysters. Yes, yes, I think the rule of thumb that I've always heard was that you don't eat oysters on months that don't end with er, but I think it's just the cold months which is more correct. Anyways, the oysters that we had were delicious.Let me preface that if you're coming here, you're looking for quality oysters and that isn't cheap. Hell, oysters themselves aren't cheap. But if you do decide to come here, your focus should be oysters and nothing else. Sure, you can get the clam chowder, but you could get a good one anywhere in Boston. I know, take my own advice right? Yeah, I wish I did. I wanted to check out their chowder and also we saw the ceviche so we decided to get that as well. The oysters delivered, of course, and surprisingly the chowder was flavorful, but I wouldn't say it was the best. The ceviche I felt was a bit underwhelming. I honestly wouldn't care for it, but since I'm in Boston...why not, right?Other notes, the staff was really nice and helped us through the menu along with explaining the different types of oysters. The interior was very modern/upscale. I wouldn't say this is a suit type of place, but if you wore a suit you definitely won't stand out. I came in with t-shirt and jeans for a brunch. Yeah.Overall, this place focus should be oysters. If your focus isn't oysters, I don't know if it'll hit the spot for you.

So honestly, it didn't seem so bad. GRILLED BISCUIT with HONEY BUTTER\\nI've never had biscuits grilled, so this was something new. It had the crunch when you bite into freshly toasted bagels. It comes with 2 halves, so my friend and I shared one. The honey butter is exactly what it sounds like. It's butter with a subtle taste of the honey sweetness. PULLED CHIPOTLE CHICKEN EGGS BENEDICT\\nI liked that you can get any eggs benedict into a bowl option (it's the same thing except it's not over the typical biscuit), so that's exactly what I ordered. I got the eggs benedict over a layer of home fries with the salad on the side. This dish is quite filling with the pulled chipotle chicken, eggs, avocado. etc. LEMON RICOTTA PANCAKE\\nOn the menu, it stated that this pancake was highly requested. So my friends and I got 1 order to share. Although my own eggs benedict dish and the shared pancake was a bit overkill, I did enjoy it. I typically don't like lemon squirted on my food, but the lemon taste was really subtle. The slight sourness of the lemon curd & fruit toppings was a good balance with the sweet pancake syrup.SERVICE\\nThe service was excellent. The waiter was very helpful when ordering. And during our meal, she was attentive to fill up our water cups. And at the end of our meal, she even offered to spilt our checks. Although we had shared a lot of things, I was quite surprised that it was do-able to spilt it like that.

We were seated very quickly and  efficiently. Garlic rolls came out. I have to say, this was probably the only gripe I had with my experience here. The rolls were not very good. They hardened up fast, and there wasn't much \\"garlic\\" infused in them. I get that they are complimentary, but I wouldn't mind pay a couple bucks extra for my entree to have soft, chewy, and garlicky rolls.  Our server seemed a little stressed out - but we were a kind group (no strange requests, here) so I was hoping for a little friendlier experience. No frills - but that's okay. The owner made up for all that and was extremely hospitable. I ordered the lasagna lunch special - which for $7.99 comes with a salad, and a fountain drink. The lasagna was out of this world. Hands down - best lasagna in Atlanta. This is something I cannot reciprocate at home. They did not skimp on the whole milk mozzarella or the ground beef. The marinara sauce was not too tangy, not too sweet, and had the perfect touch of savory. It wasn't canned! Finally, marinara that doesn't taste like a can or a jar!

I inquired about it to Debby and she said \\"that's the sauce we use.  Did you taste it?  The chef is really good.  She's the real deal\\". I had to stop her and tell her that the steak was perfect, but the sauce was not. She left and came back with more of the same sauce in a little ramekin and said that people were complaining about the taste so they changed it up.  I suggested that they not call it chimichurri then.  I explained that an authentic sauce has garlic in it and/or cilantro.

Seeing that the wait was rather long, we walked to Market of Choice to kill time.  Our table was ready at 5:55 pm (yippee). As soon as we sat down, the waiter brought us waters. He walked away and came back to explain the menu. Any menu item that has \\"thumbs up\\" picture indicates a popular selection. Moments later, A waitress then came by our table to take our order. We asked about the extra order of noodles and when it should be ordered. The waitress pointed out its best to order it after we finish. We decided to order a thumbs up selection which was Garlic Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen with low sodium broth. The ramen came out rather quickly. It didn't take us long to finish our noodles. The portion of noodles is rather small for dinner but it came with other goods in the bowl. After we finished the noodles, we ordered 1 order of the noodles to share. At least five minutes passes and our noodles hadn't shown up yet. We had to flag down a waiter to ask about the status of our noodles. He went to check on it and came back indicating that it's still being worked on which made me think that he forgot to place the order earlier. By the time we received the noodles the soup was already less than luke warm. Since the noodles took awhile the waiter didn't charge us for the extra noodles. The interior decor is very zen, relaxed and welcoming which reminds me of Maui. The restaurant was very clean but not a lot of tables. Though more tables than Yuzu.I highly suggest the low sodium broth unless you enjoy sodium and msg. Even with the low sodium broth it still rather salty but rich at the same time. Overall, I had a good experience today and I would return to try other dishes. Despite the additional noodles issue, I'm still going to give it five stars since the waiter took it off the bill. I know it wasn't intentional. What matter most is that he acknowledged the issue, looked into it and provided a quick solution.

I had heard great things about Pok Pok and was so glad I got around to eating here during my recent Portland visit.  We arrived around 8:15pm and were surprised to see that Pok Pok still had lots of people waiting around on a drizzly, cold Saturday night.  Luckily, my boyfriend convinced me to be patient and wait for an hour and a half - something that would usually deter me to go somewhere else immediately.  We left our phone number with the hostess, who told us we'd receive a call/text when our table was ready.  We ended up driving to Target nearby to grab some snacks and kill time, and headed back around 9:45pm.  I approached the hostess, concerned that we may not be seated since the restaurant hours state closing at 10pm, and she said our table was ready and we could be seated inside!  (I didn't even realize there was inside seating, but it was definitely preferred since it was chilly outside.)Our waitress greeted us warmly, and I noticed a few other tables being seating around the same time as us.  Business seemed to go on as usual despite the fact that they were technically closed!  Not sure when they close off allowing people to dine-in.  We ordered the famous fish sauce wings and a curry noodle dish, with a side of sticky rice to share.  The food didn't take too long to arrive, and we had complimentary peanuts to snack on in the meantime.  I'm glad we held back when it came to ordering; the two dishes for us was plenty!  We even had a couple of wings and a little rice leftover.  While the curry noodle soup was warm and filling, I definitely think that the accompaniments helped dial up the flavors - squeezing in some lemon and adding some chili made the dish even more enjoyable.  The wings, on the other hand, were amazing from beginning to end to the next day when we reheated them for lunch.  We LOVED the wings and I would visit Pok Pok a million times just to order wings each time.  They definitely lived up to any expectation I had for them.  Yes, they were a little salty, but I thought it worked well with bites of rice and the pickled carrots, daikon, and cucumber that come with the dish.All in all, I was really pleased with our visit to Pok Pok and can say that it was worth the wait.
