Serious change in attitude is needed by your staff.Here's why:I had called the restaurant earlier ask if I needed to make reservations, I was told 'no problems, at that time for 2 people, it should be fine'.  Ok great!  \\n - We showed up at 6:30pm where the hostess asked if we had reservations - to which I told her no and what I was told.   To which her reply was - 'I don't think we have any tables/room'.  PARDON ME????\\nIf you took a look around the restaurant was half empty - only the back portion and a couple of the 2 people seating areas were full.  They are going to have two big groups coming in later, she tells us.  She asked if we would want to sit outside on the patio, to which my friend and I said no, but then my friend asked if we could sit at the bar (since the seats were empty).  This hostess/es reply \\"I don't know if that's possible\\" WTF???  Do you not know the answer - or how about you ask your fellow workers?\\n- should have left at that point honestly.. \\n- we get seated at a table that won't stop wobbling, so my friend takes her napkin to adjust the  table.  A few minutes later she asks the waitress for some more napkins, and the waitress just throws them on the table - no eye contact, or there you go.. nothing.\\n- asks if we want anything to drink  - but doesn't tell us about specials or even if we have been there before, or if we have any questions about the menu.\\n- she comes back with the drink and asks if we are ready to order, so my friend asks a few questions and decides to order the souvlaki -- but no pita bread, but can she have rice and potatoes on the side -- not a difficult request.  Oh but this waitress \\"oh that's going to be extra\\", my friend tells her that's fine, she understands that but explains that she doesn't like/eat pita bread, so just don't even bother putting on the plate (even though that's what is listed on their menu). Again, waitress repeats her \\"oh that's going to be extra\\" - -thanks, we are not deaf, we heard and understood you the first time.  Then she asks me what I want to order and I replied moussaka - to which she replies \\"oh do you know what that is/have you had that before\\" ?? WTF???   Yes, I have eaten that at many other Greek restaurants, why are you talking down to me, rude much?????  \\n- then she tells us the food won't arrive at the same time -- um, hi - most people like to eat together, not watch the other person eat.  I understand that you guys do mezzes, but, if there are only 2 of us, and we each order an entree - surely the kitchen can figure out how to send two items at the same time????  It would be a different story if we ordered 6 or 8 or more items - like mezzes/tapas style.. but we are not doing that. \\nwe tell her to please make sure they come out together and hope that she can understand that.\\n- then comes the food... a plate with two skewers of chicken and tzatziki sauce... \\nwhere is the rest of it?  so we wait.. because as we had said, we want the food to arrive together.  A few minutes goes by and finally the rest come. .. okay fine.\\n- Food is okay -- not the best Greek food i have had, not the worst either.... just okay/average\\n- so I did not order anything to drink, my friend did. .. and we both had water at our table..   we had started eating our meal, at which point she should have come by to check if everything was okay, and see that our water glasses needed refilling, but it took her about 20-25 minutes to refill water?? REALLY??\\n- I am full and not completely satisfied, so there is food on my plate still... my friend finishes all of her food. .. the waitress eventually arrives.  At this point, at any other restaurant the waitress would notice the food was not finished, and ask if everything was okay or if you want to wrap it up -- oh  not our waitress... just picked up the dishes. \\n- she asks if we want the bill -- doesn't ask if we would like anything else (i would have liked to see the dessert options!)..  \\n- Oh and the bill -- they \\"conveniently\\" convert the tip options (15%, 18%, 20%) on the bottom, if you choose to not do your own calculations. These are based on the total plus tax??? you give tip based on the total of the food, not food and tip - smart people!!

There was a ton of pre made tacos on the warmers, with a line for freshly made ones. I decided to just get the pre made ones. There 2 bucks each for two ingredient tacos. I also grabbed some red and green salsa for them.When I go them home, I was disappointed. While the tortilla was decent the fillings were not great. The meats are not cooked together with the eggs, they are just placed inside separately. The better of the ones I tried was the bacon and egg. The pigs in a blanket were horrible! The sausage was funky, the bread was soggy/wrinkled. I expected the chopped one to have eggs in it but it was just straight up over sauced chopped brisket in a tortilla. No bueno. The salsas were ok.

I parked way back and the walk wasn't that bad. Also one lane of the road is close so its kind of tricky to get out, you may have to cut through the Publix lot. Ok so my first impression of Lucky's was \\"WOW THIS PLACE IS SO NICE, CLEAN AND VERY BIG!\\". I only had 45 minutes to look around so I kind of did a very fast drive through lol. There is plenty to look at. They have a very big selection of warm cooked food. its $8.99 a pound. On Tuesdays they have Sushi for $5 and you get more than what you get at Publix. You also will get very full. They have a variety of different sushi that you can get. I saw that they have cheap bottle of wines that I am definitely going to try. Oh and the whole cooked rotisserie chicken is only $5.99 on Wednesdays and $6.99 on other days.

We ordered: chicken wings, pork belly & shoulder stew, boar collar, prawn with noddles.  Definitely too much for 3 people, but it wasn't so egregious.  (+2 orders sticky rice, thai iced tea and special iced coffee.)Most satisfying was prawn and pork belly dishes. Most unique was the boar collar and I loved making it a \\"lettuce wrap\\" with the mustard greens.  Not much to say about the chicken wings, they were tasty chicken wings.The prawn with noddle dish was actually shrimp, so...sad.  It had good flavor.  I loved the skinny noodles (I don't often indulge) and the lumps of pork belly which was basically just fat.  The pork belly dish had a very nice flavor and was rich with a tasty sauce, which was unique.  I would get the pork belly dish again.The boar collar was a tiny portion and the sliced meet with the tendon or fat sort of exposed was unappetizing.  I love \\"american hot\\" food and this was truly spicy in a good way.  Lastly, the wings were perhaps too built up.  I like chicken wings.

The ordering process was simple you had your choice of crust, toppings and all the pizza came in one size and at the same price $8.50, we both ordered our own pizza. All the ingredients were fresh and they had a large selection to choose from.  The staff was super friendly yet they made sure the line moved quickly. There is plenty of open seating and the staff made sure the tables were cleaned off. My friend and I both ordered drinks with our pizza, she had a glass of red wine and I had a mixed drink called The Bootlegger. My drink was awesome and I will be sure to order the same one next time I come back. The pizza was absolutely delicious the sauce was good and the crust was thin.

Seriously, this thing is . . . expansive to say the least!Last night was my first visit to this Yelp-esteemed (and clearly, by the number of customers, others-esteemed) establishment. Such nice people! So much food!My top two picks - the pork potstickers and the beef ribs. Get a little rice to eat with your rib meat, if you're like me and like to have a bite of meat with some rice (or veggies). Speaking of veggies- impressive selection of salads (pretty good Caesar), lovely asparagus, sauteed spinach and multiple dishes of chicken or beef with red peppers, corn, etc mixed in. Steak and chicken kabobs round out my fave - if you're into shrimp like my dining companion, there is lots for the taking that you will surely enjoy!!As for the sushi- impressive number of choices, however I was a little skeptical of the ones normally \\"hot\\" that were out on platters. Probably just me as they must have been moving fast based on occupancy/number of diners. But I tried several that I enjoyed - thought it was nice that all were labeled though I can't remember all the names now!- definitely the tried-and-true basic, the CA roll, a shrimp tempura and at least one other one with avocado.

Since it was expiring in about a month, my girlfriend and I decided we'd better use it. Our experience was okay, but we don't know if we'll go back.The place is extremely clean, and I like that they have the menu printed on 2 large signs, making it easy to read. You can also see directly back into the kitchen, which is nice. Soft drinks are serve yourself, and other beverages are brought to you.My girlfriend wanted the Pad Thai, and I ended up ordering the Lemon Grass, after the woman behind the counter said she liked it. Neither one of us was impressed with the food. The Pad Thai was kind of sweet, and gummy, and not what my girlfriend expected. The woman behind the counter said the lemon grass was a sweet dish, and it wasn't. It was salty more than anything, and I could barely smell the lemongrass used in it. Neither one of us finished out servings (which were large), and we didn't bother asking for takeout containers. Our Groupon covered the cost of dinner, but we didn't know that until after she ran our check. Once we'd ordered, I mentioned I had the Groupon and handed it to the woman behind the counter. She took it and crossed it off their list, and then closed our check. Dinner was $18.50, Groupon was $20. I don't mind if what I'm purchasing doesn't use the entire Groupon, but usually when that happens, I get asked if I want to add anything. This woman didn't say a thing.In the end, dinner was okay, but not great.

By the end of the wait, I was completely ready to make an elephant-shaped pancake. My friends and I ordered a tube of the buttermilk pancake mix and the pumpkin pancake mix with hazelnut, cranberries, and satsuma ginger marmalade. (I highly recommend the marmalade- it's like a fancy version of orange jam) We also split the pork belly benedict, which the menu describes as a \\"confit of pork belly with pickle carrot ribbons on an english muffin with two eggs & a bacon fat hollandaise\\". basically blood clotting greasy goodness conveniently package with an english muffin. The whole experience was really entertaining. I dig the idea of using pancakes as a creative outlet. My elephant pancake ended up looking obscene, but my triangular shaped pancake deserved admiration. In the end, I think this is one of those \\"once is enough\\" kind of places.

My favorite food is steak. I make my dates concerned, Midwestern grandfather proud, and vegan aunt absolutely disgusted with the amount of red meat I eat in one sitting. However, I need to maintain my wallet, cardiovascular health, and figure. Steak for three meals a day, or even three meals a week, is not an option; I need to suck it up and eat some vegetables. Life Alive is awesome. The food is satisfying, healthy, flavorful and delicious. Every time I tell a friend I am craving one of Life Alive's bowls filled with tofu, quinoa and kale they look at me like I have three heads. I drag them here, and they fall in love with it as well. This is also a great place to get acquainted with those grains and vegetables that are often pushed off into the \\"pretentious health food\\" category.  The atmosphere is very whimsical and comfortable. The staff are always friendly, even during the times when I accidentally put my dirty dishes in the wrong place or thought the ginger kombachu on tap (which is delicious, by the way) was beer.While a meal's worth is determined by so many more factors than calorie-count, it is important to note that while Life Alive's meals are nutritious and organic, you do not magically remove calories when you remove the chemicals.

I begrudgingly am giving 4 stars based on your amazing drunken noodles and tom yum fried rice. Both are marvelous. The drunken noodles are spicy and will take your taste buds on a wild ride. You'll be that annoying person who says, \\"Ahh it's soo spicy...\\" every 5 minutes, but continues to eat it because it's THAT good. Guilty. My vegetarian roommate gets it about every other week, so you could say it's kind of a staple in her diet. Tom yum rice is HUGE, so there's definitely a bang for your buck there. And it is super flavorful and delicious, full of your protein of choice, and lots of veggies for variety. Pad thai is very good and very average. It's pretty hard to mess up pad thai, right? I like putting my bean sprouts in my noodles right away so they cook before I dig in.My cousin fell in love with my tom yum noodles, which I enjoyed, but thought was a little too sour for my liking. I'm happy he loved it though, because that means he'll want to go with me next time he's in my hood. And I am always going to be down for Pho Basil! The only thing I don't like about Pho Basil are their Vietnamese options. Not a huge fan of the pho and definitely not of the bun bo hue. Just stick to the Thai and I don't think you can go wrong.

A somewhat small place but slightly larger than sushi station across the street. I ordered the salmon and tuner lover entree with the spicy tuna maki roll.My thoughts:\\nThe spicy tuna maki roll is fairly typical. Same as other places. Nothing special. It also has sesame seeds (black and white) sprinkled on the outside. The knife skills of the chef wasn't that great for those who care about how well the sushi roll is cut. The pieces were cut slanted. The roll was, however, wrapped tightly so it didn't fall apart when it was picked up. Moving on to the sushi pieces. Both the tuna and salmon pieces had generous cut amount of fish. The sashimi pieces were tasty and the cut sizes are very generous.The presentation was well done. The ginger and wasabi was separated from the sushi by a divider. there were even slices of lemon on the side. The soy sauce was place in a small container which was then also placed in a sealed plastic bag. This was a nice additional because if the container would of opened during travel, the sauce wouldn't make a mess. Cons: My only negative thought is that the rice used tasted very hard and not soft at all. They didn't use authentic Japanese sushi rice. The rice they used seemed to be jasmine rice which is long grain rice. They should of used short grain or at the very least used medium grain rice."},{"name":"Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya","address":"11830 NW Cedar Falls Dr, Ste 128","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great food . excellet service.

Of course our server warned us about this, so we were not surprised.  Although we ordered the hot wings (you have a choice of mild or hot) they were mild compared to the salad. The wings had a very nice flavor and the meat was just coming off the bone. The pork belly was served in a sweeter sauce and was also very tender.  The only complaint about the pork was that of the 4 pretty small pieces served, 3 of them were mostly pork belly fat and very little meat.  It's a shame as it had such a nice flavor.

Some of the best times of my life. I miss the language, the culture, the FOOD!\\nWhen I heard about a little Italian joint in the Pearl where it's like \\"walking into a restaurant in Rome\\", I got there as soon as I could (albeit a couple weeks after I heard of this place) and I must admit, I got a little weepy.I've been there a few times now. The first time, I ordered the \\"Pappardelle con Rag√π di Cinghiale\\" (In english speak \\"pappardelle with boar ragu\\") as my main course, and my dining companion and I split an order of the Bruschetta as a starter.The ONLY thing I haven't liked here so far has been the Bruschetta; the bread was saturated in olive oil, and the topping consisted of sparse tomatoes, too much salt, and in the place of fresh basil was DRIED BASIL. What the eff, Piazza Italia? There's NO excuse for dried basil on bruschetta. I was disappointed, being a bruschetta whore and all. I hate dried herbs in general. Fresh Fresh Fresh all the way! ...And there's definitely no excuse for an Italian restaurant to be using dried BASIL for the love of GODDDDD. Che cazzo!?Soooo, I'm kinda worried to ever order it again. It made me very sad :(The second time I was there, it was for lunch, by my lonesome, because I found myself wandering around the Pearl after school and wanted gnocchi really bad, and also felt like brushing up on my Italian skillz. So zoom zoom back to Piazza. They didn't have gnocchi on the menu, but the extremely awesome waiter who looked straight from a Nordic country yet spoke fluent Italian (how's that work? Maybe he's Swiss.) hooked me up with some perfectly perfect gnocchi alla Sorrentina which is as simple as you can get. (Gnocchi, basil, tomato sauce, mozzarella).It's funny how restaurants can fuck up a simple dish. This was not at all - tiny potato dumplings perfectly cooked and not mushy, lovely velvety tomato sauce, loads of fresh mozzarella, and oh! Basil! Fresh! Love at first bite.That, and 2 glasses of $$$ wine suggested by NordicItalianWaiter and I had an awesome lunch. I was so happy I way overtipped but hey, money supposedly grows on trees and I hope he got to buy some extra Lutefisk or something.I will so be back when I am able to splurge again.Their Tiramisu is awesome as well. It's not the cheap frozen shit made with Cool Whip in place of Mascarpone (that is a fucking abomination when places do that - GROSS).Soooo bottom line: they play Euro football on the tvs. With the amount of Italian speak flying around it put me right back in Italy.

I ordered nachos but the edges came out burned and the cheese was partially melted. I did bring this to the lady's attention and she re-did it, however, she put it back in the oven further burning the chips.

I should perhaps say around town since they have two locations - Burnaby (North Road) and Richmond. Soondooboo is a hot and spicy Korean stew made with tofu, vegetables, mushrooms, onions, scallions and chili powder. It is a popular item in Korean restaurants and is truly comforting because of it is served piping hot with a raw egg and also side bowl of rice.However, superior tofu soup is hard to come by in the Lower Mainland. Some restaurants make them either too watery or cheap out on the ingredients. This is crucial because a lot of the flavours comes from the tiny shrimps and veggies. House of Tofu Soup offers a few choices of seafood, pork, beef, chicken, kimchi, dumpling or mushroom. You can select the level of fire of hot, regular, mild or white (non-spicy). What is special about this place is that their serve the bowl of rice on a stone bowl - the heat from the stone bowl creates crispy rice along the side. The traditional way to conquer the rice is to add tea into the crispy rice to soften them up and then eat. Myself I like to scrape the crispy rice and dip into the left over spicy tofu soup - To each their own.Common to all Korean restaurants, delicious side dishes are served: kimchi, marinated potatoes, bean sprouts, seaweed, radish, etc. etc.The prices are extremely reasonable and you will find yourself satisfied with yummy goodness.

The remaining part of the restaurant is still pretty nice though.  The sangrias are highly recommended (get a pitcher, it is a great deal) and the food, while small because it is tapas style, is great across the board.

The specialty croques only come as one sandwich with a small salad and the croque madame comes as two sandwiches and salad or fries.  I never had croque sandwiches before and we decided that the croque madame was tasty but it was a glorified ham and cheese sandwich.  I liked their specialty sandwich(it had pork and goat cheese), but my husband thought it was just 'ok'.  The vegetarian sandwich tasted good but wasn't anything too special.  I think portion for the $5 sandwich would not be enough(maybe use as an appetizer and then get another entree).  We got a couple of drinks to go with our sandwich.  I got the En Thyme, which was a delicious blueberry concoction with thyme in it.  I loved the scent of thyme in the drink.

In all honesty, I can selfishly admit I hate that its gaining so much popularity. Its been written about enough now that people from all over are heading to the obscure side of Mass Ave to check this place out. I wouldnt mind except that its so small that you are guarenteed to have a wait. The atmosphere is unassuming, the chairs old and weathered, with small tables that a party of 4 would call \\"cozy\\". If you walked in during a slow period you wouldnt really guess this place harbors such phenomenal cuisine. To those that love Thai and Vietemese, this is a real treat. Very authentic cuisine, my personal favorite is the Won ton soup, Pad Thai with chicken, and the drunken noodle. Their curry is also outstanding and I would recommend it. If you or someone accompaning you has had a bad experience or is skittish, bring them here. It will turn them around. The price, especially for the area (you are only a few blocks from Newbury, Boylston st etc) is very reasonable. Pho (and you get a heaping full) is around 7-10 dollars. The same with their main dishes and appetizers around 5-7. All in all, enjoy my secret location that isnt so secret anymore. My only wish is that they could somehow increase the space of the restaurant. It gets cramped quickly and their is really no hostess typically since its so busy so it can get confusing.

I might have missed the others.  It would have been nice, though, to not have to go back to the entrance to figure out where I wanted to go next.  The organization is not intuitive, which is fine if you're in there to browse for hours, but it was confusing for a newbie like myself.Ok I lied, I have one more complaint: I didn't see all that many used books compared with the number of new ones, and the used books I did find were kind of pricey.

One thing I like about the place is the service. They provide attentive, courteous service. I had a pineapple sculpin with a dozen raw, a glass of Pinot with my grouper, and a Dark and Stormy after my meal. This is my second or third time eating there. A bartender that used to work there is a personal friend of mine.  To the food: no technical issues at all. They recommended a bigger type of oysters for my appetizer, as I am used to traditional gulf oysters. I chose the grouper broiled with the lemon caper and brown butter sauce. I guess there was one technical issue, all I got in the sauce was butter. It overpowered the capers and lemon. So why is this a two star review? The price. A dozen raw was $33 and the grouper with potatoes and broccoli was $32. The grouper filet was half the size of my hand. Management needs to make some changes before I order food here again.

In fact, it's right across the street from the Kenmore station (green line).  The food was AMAZING!  My boyfriend and I started our meal off with 6 Island Creek Oysters.  We had been eating oysters alllll week at some of the other well-known oyster bars in town, but OMG, ICOB had the best!  They were so good that we ordered 6 more.  We then ordered oyster sliders, mussels in saffron, and we split a lobster roll.  Nothing negative to say about any of the dishes; they were all fantastic.  The lobster roll was my favorite, however.  While it wasn't filled with overly huge chunks of lobster, the mayo-based spread was delicious, the lobster was perfectly cooked, and the bun/roll was melt-in-your-mouth good.  My boyfriend's favorite dish was the oyster sliders.    The cocktails were very unique and pretty tasty as well.

Okay. By 9:50, I STILL hadn't received my food. I tried calling again and got a busy signal.

This Subway is the only one that's has the dirtiest, nastiest, no washing hands employees I have ever witnessed. I have gave that continuous business, but I am done. This is the last draw, I'm tired of going in here, watching whoever making the sandwiches and never and I mean never wash their hands. They come around that corner, straight to the gloves, passing up the sink. Put gloves on, fix the person sandwich ahead of you, then go to the register, sometimes taking one glove off, collect cash or leave both gloves on, touch the computer screen, take cash or wipe everything they can with gloves still on. Never changing or turning around to the sink behind them to wash their damn hands. The guy tonight, did exactly that, rang a customer up, touch screen the dirty computer with both gloves on, took payment, pass him his receipt, then went back to making my sandwich with the same dirty gloves on, he just used to touch everything in his sight. If you order online, be careful, you might be ordering filth, because if they want and definitely don't wash their hands in front of you, just imagine what they're doing when no one is there to witness them making your sandwich. If you get sick, with diarrhea, salmonella, hepatitis, cholera or any other infection bacteria. Look to this place first, I guarantee it was this Subway fault, because their employees never and I mean never washing their hands.

But CRAPTASM -- the service was an abomination on fine dining.Let's review. It took at least 10 minutes for a server to greet us, even though the restaurant was mostly empty on a Sunday late afternoon. After ordering, it was quite a while before the coffee and tea arrived. When both did, there was not a spoon or napkin to be had and our vacant server disappeared before we noticed and could raise the point.When the pie arrives, I politely ask if we could have some silverware. Their is no apology, but there is a bit more waiting. Once we've got the tools to get the job done, we dig in and the apple-cranberry pie a la mode is quite good. Hot, rich, and delicious. The ice cream is a decent vanilla bean. There's a sugary wafer thing and a bit of dark chocolate. Satisfying.But then the social experiment begins. By the end of it, I'm wondering if Harvard psychology students are hiding somewhere frantically typing notes on their laptops as they observe my fuming date & I run out of patience. In short, we waited at least 20 minutes for the server to return and offer us the check. Then we waited at least another 15 minutes... all this time, we can see our server chatting up the chef behind the prep counter. All this time, we see a far more professional server making the rounds to the other half of the restaurant. We watch the other tables vacate and fill, and start to get ready to vacate again... WHAT IN GOD'S NAME CAN BE SO IMPORTANT TO DISCUSS WITH THE CHEF???!!!Here's the thing -- if her best friend just died a few days ago or her significant other dumped her the night before, she could have said something -- or the other server or a manager could have said something or given us a heads-up/apology. But no. That didn't happen. So that clearly wasn't the case. Our server just sucked. She wouldn't even last a day working at Friendly's.Finally, when we couldn't wait any longer, I walked up to the take-out counter and asked if I could pay there. The staff member said sure, but didn't even question what had happened that had caused a dining room patron to try to pay at the take-out counter. Of course, she didn't know how to do it and had to go and ask someone. You would think at this point the manager would come over and speak to us -- or, I don't know, our server, but no. After waiting another 3 minutes, the take-out staff member returns and I have a check to sign.GOOD JOB, FINALE -- I SPENT ALMOST AN HOUR TOTAL WAITING AND WAITING FOR THE GRAND FINALE TO HAPPEN AND RELEASE ME FROM PRISON.

There are four -to five major rooms that have a core area , like the blue room is literature, drama, red  is travel and spirituality etc. Everything is very well labeled, so very easy to find. It can be overwhelming at first and you spend hours and hours if you do not know what your are looking for. But I feel that can be awesome fun ! Just while away and browse the amazing collection. You can easily spend hours and days here. Every section has staff recommendations, powell city favorites and award winning books highlighted - which is great to see that they are so well read. It is also a great help if you are looking to try something in a new area - I would suggest go for the highlighted books. They have some souvenirs and used books as well. Cashiers  are fast as well.The store is generally crowed but since it is so huge , the crowd seems spaced out.

After about 10 minutes our waiter came to take our drink order, but we decided to put in our order for food right away because we were starving. After our order was in we waited about 15 minutes for our waters, another 15 minutes for our drinks and then another 15 minutes for our food. Once we got our food I was astonished I waited so long for something so bland and unimpressive - I could have made my own meal in less time at home for a lot less and a lot tastier. So once we were done with our meals we waited again for an extended amount of time for our bill which we of course ended up being overcharged for. Again fair enough, human error, but at this point we spent so much time waiting and waiting and waiting and having to wait again for the waiter to fix the mistake we got impatient. In my opinion, this is one of those places people go to because it's trendy - and they have supposed impressive drinks but let me say this place was not worth the wait.

We sat now, waiting at the table and not being noticed once again, as no one came to take our order even, so we decided we would go elsewhere, as we also had friends joining us and by this time, 15 minutes had passed without anyone coming back. On the way out we met the manager, and told him our situation, and also that we were disappointed in the wait time. He told us that they were training new staff. Ok! We received a gift certificate for Christmas, and since we have children and work shifts, and live in Burnaby, we finally decided to go there for our anniversary, and hired a sitter for the evening. We had made reservations and arrived some 15 minutes beforehand, and again we felt invisible for that time, until the manager arrived and asked if we had reservations-to which we answered, yes. He said ok, and went somewhere! We waited again for about 15 minutes and when he did not come back, my husband and I decided to leave. Only THEN did we get noticed, and were told our table was ready! We do not want to go back, as it was embarrassing enough to leave twice.

Here's the honest truth:Atmosphere (5/5): Really great! Beautiful Italian d√©cor, comfortable and spacious seating, and ambient music complete the dining experience.Food (3.5/5): For the price point, the food is pretty good; however, not everything is fresh/authentic, which is what is advertised on the menu.Service (4/5): Most of the servers are friendly and knowledgeable. During busy times, food can take a while (up to 30 minutes for an appetizer and 60 minutes for an entree) to come out.Bar (1/5): The bar is almost full service, just missing a few key items. The bartender knows little about wine and craft cocktails, which is a huge problem because it's an Italian restaurant. Drink service is usually pretty slow (think 5-7 minutes for a Moscow Mule if you catch her while she isn't busy) because she checks the menu to see what the ingredients are in the signature cocktails before she makes them. Bartending abilities aside, the bartender lacks personality and basic customer service skills and instead makes her money with her tits and foreign accent. Overhead a group of people at the bar complain that this was the \\"worst service they have ever received in their life.\\"Personal Experience:\\nThe reason I left was not because of the money, I averaged about $9-10/hour working there, which isn't ideal for a food service gig, but it's decent. I also loved my coworkers, including all of the servers and most of the kitchen. I left because the bartender and management were complete trash to the employees.Servers get paid completely under the table ($0.00/hour) and don't get paid up to $7.25 if they don't make it in tips (which should be the case for the people that get a week of bad shifts). I don't know how the IRS isn't on their ass; the only conclusion that I can come to is that management is BSing their records.The final straw for me was getting physically threatened and violently verbally assaulted by another staff member. After informing management, no attempt at a solution was put forth to rectify the situation. I don't feel safe there anymore.Overall (1/5): Even though the food is okay and the service is fine, I will not go back and support this establishment because I fundamentally disagree with how they treat their employees and how they handle financial obligations. I understand that to some degree every restaurant has illegal practices, but this one kicks it up a notch. Start giving servers their $2.13 an hour and retrain/fire the bartender and this might become a decent spot where I would be happy to spend my money.I promise you'll have a much better time if you go to one of the other places in Emory Point (i.e., Tin Lizzy's, Marlow's Tavern, etc.)"},{"name":"Cap't Loui","address":"160 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"The foods was good but bad service!!

After seeing this place on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives (I live in San Diego), I decided that this place would be a must visit on my next trip to Portland.The service was decent, and I did like how they gave us the option to go to a Thai-inspired bar across the street while we waited for our table. But when we walked into the bar (the Whiskey Lounge), and we were impressed by the authenticity of the Thai atmosphere (a couple of friends of mine had just come back from a trip to Thailand), and thought we would be in for a treat. Once our table opened up, we were told that we have five minutes to get over there or we would lose the table. Normally I would be pleased that the wait for a table wasn't as long, but I would hope that if you were in the middle of a drink (which had just arrived), they would give you a bit more time than that. Once we get to Pok Pok, I discovered an extremely convoluted menu (there's literally a paragraph underneath each item describing it... I don't know if they know Restaurant 101, but it is a bit of information overload). The server we had was decent at best, and would say that some things were spicy, but wouldn't warn about other things that were, in fact, spicier. Now this wasn't a problem for us, but I can imagine how it could be for some other people without a taste for spicier foods. So we basically put in a very large order (our total bill for 5 people came out to well over 100 bucks), and weren't waited on for the rest of the night hardly. When our bill came, we saw why: gratuity is added on for parties of 5 or more so we didn't need to have excellent service. This was a shame, as the presentation of the food was pretty good, but the service was a nightmare.  There you have it: TWO STARS. Now the food was, in a word, disappointing. If this is the best Thai food that is made in Portland, I would say come down to San Diego, CA and walk into ANY Thai restaurant for the real deal. And the wings that I saw a lot of people raving about just tasted like they were soaked in fish sauce with very little other flavors, other than some sort of spice (they weren't very spicy anyways, so I feel like anyone could order the spicy variant with little to fear). The curry was mildly flavorful, the brined bird was decent at best, and they charged for sticky rice!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Decent food, but minus one star for cleanliness, and one star for portion and ambience misfit.

The service was excellent and the price was great.  However, the chicken shawarma was very dry.  Everything else was good but I had to smother the chicken in their super potent garlic sauce.  Word of advice, be warned the delicious garlic sauce is super strong.  It could use a little mayo mixed in to make it a little more smooth and creamy.

I decided to order the Wundershowzen, mostly because it has peanut butter in it....and peanut butter is life. It also has spinach (yayy..get the veggies in), almond milk, banana, and hemp protein. Let me tell you that this smoothie was EVERYTHING! Hands down, the best smoothie I have ever tasted from an establishment. Definitely better than my own..even if I were to use the exact same ingredients. Imagine that. There are sooo many different smoothie options. You shouldn't have trouble finding something that you have a taste for. Smoothie was made pretty quickly so you don't have to worry about long wait times.There is minimal street parking.

We went around 8 pm at night, when it was DEAD. I ordered a cubano, my husband ordered the boricua and a bowl of soup to share. My sandwich was fine, but TBH I'd rather have a Publix cuban sub any day of the week. My husband's sandwich was completely inedible. The meat was so chewy you couldn't even tear it apart with your teeth or a knife. The soup was the best part of the meal, I actually really liked it. The real reason I'll never return to the restaurant is the customer service though. At the end of our meal, I needed a lid for the soup to take the rest home (it was the only part of the meal worth saving). I walked up to the counter. I could see three employees visibly, although there could have been more in the back. I don't expect them to drop what they are doing in order to answer my question, but what annoyed me is that each employee made eye contact with me ATLEAST three times before even acknowledging my existence.  It was as if none of them wanted to help me, and they didn't even know what my question was at that point. When one person finally came over, I simply asked for a lid for my bowl of soup. She huffed, walked away WITHOUT saying a word then returned a minute later with a lid. I didn't think asking for a lid was a big deal. Nonetheless, at least have the common courtesy to tell me \\"I'll be right back I need to go get one.\\" There was no verbal communication at all. I was disappointed to say the least. Even though the food was bad, I WOULD have been willing to give the restaurant a second try IF the employees had basic customer service.

I asked him for utensils because the table was one set short and he brought the set out in the middle of our meal.  The food is just about average bar food. I have tried the BLT with apple-smoked bacon, tomato and arugula on farm bread. I did not enjoy this sandwich at all. The bacon is bad quality so you end up paying for a sandwich composed of bread, arugula and tomato.

Both waitress and manager came over and offered something else, but having two fussy children doesn't afford the luxury of waiting again. Manager fully took off of check and gave me his card to come back for a free burger another time. Might have given it a thought until I came home and found a 1.99 entertainment charge on bill.

It's actually the closest thing to what I experienced at some really expensive restaurants in Japan last summer. I came here with my usual craving for sashimi that hits every day around lunchtime, but the sushi was not the highlight of the offerings, in my opinion. There wasn't any sashimi, and the nigiri and rolls were good, but not too memorable.The grill and the salads are responsible for my resulting food coma. I'm still thinking about the grilled calamari. The Japanese ceviche, calamari salad, and hijiki salad were particularly awesome. I didn't hit up the hot bar as much as my brother, but he raved about the soft shell crab and tempura. The small cubes of different dessert cakes are too cute, and the green tea ice cream machine is super cool, but the ice cream isn't as strong in flavor as it was in Japan (which I preferred). Still a perfect end to the meal, though.You get a lot for your money here, and the $15 lunch buffet is one of the best deals in the city. I've heard dinner has even more options, including a dessert crepe bar, and I'll probably shell out the $24 to come back on a weekday night. Tip: Get their rewards card, and join their birthday club.

There are too many ways to count my love for Powell's.The outside is your typical looking brick building, with an unassuming fa√ßade. You can sell your used books (fiction, non-fiction, cookbooks, textbooks with current student ID) on the bottom floor. If you can imagine a book, new, used, rare, kids, adults, anything, you can find it here. If you can not find it here, it probably does not exist. Seriously though. Since the listing of Powell's in 2005, there have been 3178 reviews that have counted to the listing. 5 star reviews? Well, my 5 stars for them is just one of 2662 5 star reviews. A bookstore. In 2017. Only 25 1 star reviews, that is only 0.7% of the reviews, so that alone should say something.I could spend days on end here. The smell of the paper, ink, people, coffee, is overwhelming and brought me to tears when I walked back in this past November. I dream of getting lost in here, sitting huddled in a corner, nose in a book, unaware of the time or date. Five or so floors of books, novelty items, cards, rare, new, used.Some of the prices on the novelty items are a bit on the high side, but seriously, some of this stuff, you can't find much of any where else. For real. I went through a period when I lived in Portland that I wanted all the books considered to be banned, whether they be for questionable topics for children or things that adults found to be inappropriate, but this is where I went.This location is downtown, and has very few parking options. If you are lucky, you can get in their garage and get your parking validated, but it is small and the parking spots are tricky to get in and out of. There is a blind spot when entering and exiting. There is some street parking. Your best bet is to park out by the Lloyd Center, and ride max or take a bus. Or walk! A little walk might be good since your planning on getting some books to curl up with.There is a coffee place inside Powell's, tucked away in a corner.Powell's is local to Portland, and I dare say the largest privately owned bookstore and is not a cookie cutter chain bookstore. You can order from their online store. They do have many locations, but this main location is truly my favorite ever. This is my security blanket. My heart belongs here. This is my happy place and I imagine my escape to here frequently. I feel like Alice and this is my rabbit hole. Just writing this review makes my heart yearn for Powell's.

The staff is short-fused and impatient, so it doesn't help asking for explanations.If you're staying for dinner, they have an extensive and inexpensive Cantonese menu that is flavorful but over salted. Wonton soup is wonderful. So are the noodle dishes. The English descriptions in the menu aren't the most helpful, so definitely ask questions if you're not sure what you want.Din Ho now has competition for BBQ - and that includes the superb Ho Ho Chinese BBQ (35/Parmer) and First Chinese BBQ (Braker/Lamar).

Whenever I see that they are offering raw specials, I try to come out and try each one!  Whenever my non-vegan friends want to eat out with me, this is the place I take them.  I know I can get something for me, and I know that they can also get some warm vegan comfort foods that are more familiar to what they normally eat minus the animals.

Luckily, only 10 minutes of waiting two seats at the bar was opened.Granite, I understand the bartenders were slammed making other guest and server's cocktails, but I think they could of used one extra one behind the bar. But we sat down looked over the adult beverage menu - and their selection of wines are pretty impressive and are not too over priced. For a good glass of wine I don't mind paying $14, but it better be a good glass of wine.We split everything.Started with the mussels - which the presentation was very nice and extremely tasty. The steak on the menu, which I don't recall, but I'm assuming it was a sirloin. It was vey tasty and cooked to order, but we both decided when we come back here again, we are def. getting the filet. Shared the fries and mac-n-cheese, and the mac-n-cheese was our favorite side dish.Finished with dessert which was also tasty.Highly recommend dining here. But come here to splurge.

That definitely would deter people from going so it's probably because I didn't go during the most ideal of conditions. We were sat inside away from the rain and cold. We were greeted promptly by our waitress and asked if we'd like anything to drink and were given time to look at the menu. The menu is not like a typical Thai restaurant, and probably where all of the appeal lies. It was hard for me to choose since everything was so foreign to me, but I settled on the Khanom jiin naam phrik with coconut rice. I can say right now that I do not regret my decision whatsoever. The main dish had some cabbage that added some crunch to the food and the noodles and vegetables blended in well. It had some pureed shrimp in it which you could taste and added some thickness to the soup. Just a forewarning, the dish comes with a super spicy sauce that you should use in moderation, so just be careful when eating it along with your meal. The coconut rice is a must since the change of pace from traditional white rice is always nice. I only wish I could visit this place more to try all of their different dishes, but I would say this place is a definite must for those who are adventurous eaters that are in the Portland area."},{"name":"sweetgreen","address":"372 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"You know that you are in yuppie heaven when Sweet greens opens up.

From the Front host stand to getting the check almost every aspect was 1 star...So, the hostess has to write down like 20 things when she checks you in making the process take longer than your typical \\"how many? Name?\\" So it took about 5-10 mins just to wait in line to get our name on the list on a Sunday at noon. We had a party of 5 for a bachelorette brunch and the hostess neglected to tell us that they have very few tables that can accommodate more than 4 people due to it being a \\"fire hazard to pull up an extra chair.\\" We found seats at the bar for all 5 of us and had drink while we waited what we were told would be about 30 mins for a table. Service at the bar was pretty spotty but I've had worse. The menu said the Bloody Mary came with bacon but mine didn't. After an hour of waiting we decided to check on our table. Tons of people on the list after us had been sat but there were no tables for 5 open. Finally after an hour and 15 mins we decided to try and squeeze the 5 of us into a 4 person booth. That didn't go so well so we asked to just eat our appetizer there until something else opened up. At this point the manager has gotten involved and he was try to help remedy the situation but not enough to turn our sentiment around.Our tots appetizer arrived and our waiter brought 4 small plates. Have I mentioned there were 5 of us????? He also never once asked if we wanted more water the entire meal. Our new table was right under the AC vent so we were pretty chilly the rest of our meal. Not even sure why the AC was on when it's was in the 50s outside? Our new table had no salt. The mustard cap was filled with mustard and needed to be cleaned. We had to ask for to go boxes 3 times and it took about 10-15 mins to get our credits card back at the end.

I don't know that any restaurant of this caliber has much more than that on the menu.

(Or, you could head down to Dan's other restaurant, the stunning Steel & Rye on the Milton side of Lower Mills, a place that is all kinds of lively and classy in both food and interior design).Anyway, we really liked Prarie Fire, and found it to be as enjoyable as Steel & Rye. To the extent that S&R is upbeat and bustling, Prarie Fire was heady, subdued, and easily sophisticated. Medium wood, comfy chairs, places to stand, and a minimum of Edison lightbulbs lend this a grown up air that telegraphs something like \\"we're not chasing the trends, but we have good taste,\\" which is perfect for Brookline. There's a kind of easy, timeless comfort here. We saw plenty of Brookline people on first and second dates, folks having a drink after getting out of work and kvetching about their crappy bosses, and people alone for a drink and pasta. It was Friday night, so there weren't too many kids, but I'll bet this gets to be kid central midday on weekends.The food met the high standard we've come to expect from this business. The highlight was the ricotta dumplings with a great savory smoked tomato sauce, but the chicken and roasted vegetable salad was also great (simple, satisfying, the ideal form of green goddess dressing), as was the chocolate dessert with mushroom ice cream. The \\"very stable genius\\" cocktail and the beer collaboration between a Chicago brewery and the incomparable Chicago gastropub Longman & Eagle were both memorable.The service was also friendly, easygoing, and professional.

I'd say the only thing that could've been better were the sides. The risotto was just ok and the asparagus wasn't as charred as we would've liked, seemed more like steamed than grilled.  Btw....they only charge a $20 corckage fee so it's well worth it to bring your own wine if you have something special at home."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"New favorite spot in Boston.

The interior is all clean lines + modern decor. . . Yes, the Herman Miller chairs make me drool. Yes, I think the Pelligrino wall is fabulous (probably helps that I could drink the stuff by the gallons). Yes, I wish my living room looked like this. And, yes, I even love the font they use on the menu.Ah, and the food! My most recent meal was a tableful of steak frites from their late night menu - did you know that the closer it gets to midnight, the better a steak tastes? As for the rest of the menu, it's new American all the way - they've got selections like well done classics like fried calamari and a fresh fish selection. Actually. . . last year one of their recipes that I had tried, the spaghettini, was published in the paper. I liked it enough to save it and even email it to a friend (um, but no, it didn't taste quite like it does at the Globe when I tried to make it)! And as an event space, there are a lot of options - from the lounge area in the front, to the 'library,' a private back room. They're well staffed and suited to cater to special events. Depending on the night, they have valet, but they always validate parking in the near by parking deck, which is a huge bonus for Midtown.  This is one of the restaurants that I've frequented quite a bit - and I'm excited to see the upcoming new additions they soon plan to add to the menu.

The rest of our 12-person birthday party were therefore told to meet at Moonshine at 8. We were all there, standing until 9pm (in heels). They gave us a couple of free appetizers for having to wait so long, so that was nice. I wasn't crazy about my turkey melt (all the condiments were in a pool in the middle of the sandwich.. not spread at all) but the chicken friend steak looked amazing. Service was pretty good, I never had to wait too long for a drink refill. \\nThe event that really makes me never want to come back again has to do with the restaurant's valet. The rest of my group had to wait 20 minutes for their car because of the shortage of valets. My car was taking much longer, so when I asked, the valet hurriedly told me their was a long line and to continue waiting. After a total of FORTY minutes, I again approached the valet and it turns out they never even took my keys out of the box. \\nOverall, alright food, but DEFINITELY not worth the frustration of the evening."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place is definitely an Americanized Vietnamese/Thai food place. It's very unique with flavors that I've been familiar with all might life. It is a bit pricey but I think it's worth it. The first this my friend and I had were the wings. They were good but a bit salty. I would recommend some rice with it. We also shared the khao soi. It was noodle soup dish and if you've ever had Vietnamese curry, that's what it tasted like. It had a strong coconut flavor. I'm sure there was a lot of coconut milk that went into the dish. Luckily I like coconut milk so I thought the dish was great.

Where they falter probably has to do most with timing and circumstance, but the corners we saw cut when they were slammed on a Friday night were highly disappointing. The food itself oscillates wildly between divine inspiration and try-hard, erring more on the latter than the former. Because they might be very busy when you arrive, plates to a group of people (5 in our case) may come out at a glacial speed. It was not uncommon to receive one piece of nigiri, eat this in under 90 seconds, and wait another 15 minutes for the next single piece. Our meal was drawn out over 3 hours, with conversation turning to where we would eat afterwards because we were still hungry after the slow-drip feast we'd experienced. Additionally, water glasses remained empty for 20+ minutes several times, and while delivering a roll to our table, one of our dirty dishes was placed next to a yet-to-be-delivered roll on a tray the server was carrying. That seems like a sanitation misstep to me.Again, all this could be chalked up to a 5-top on a Friday night. But when you boast your fish comes from the freshest far reaches of the world, then coat it in Tabasco sauce so you can't taste it, there's more than just hospitality that needs to be re-assessed."},{"name":"SwedeDISH","address":"609 Irvington Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We have had food trucks at my work everyday for the past month and this is my least favorite truck and I will never spend money here again. They are super slow (even for the simplest of orders) and seem to run out of everything. The first time it was taking over 30 minutes to order and get the food and I couldn't wait that long.  The second time I went a little later , about 1pm, and they were out of everything but hamburgers! I was hungry so i just got the burger. The was very little of the sauce or toppings mentioned on the menu and it was a bit dry so I had to track down some ketchup. It was an average burger you would get anywhere else, nothing special except it cost around 10 or 11 bucks for just the burger. What I got wasn't worth that.Ok , so I tried them again and that will be the last time. I ordered the special marinated roast beef on toasted roll with fried onions, special sauce etc etc. The bun wasn't toasted instead it seemed like a generic roll that just came out of the package. The roast beef was Ice cold, maybe that is my fault for expecting the beef to be put on the flat top and then on the toasted bun but it wasn't even room temperature it was like it came out of the ice box! There was hardly any sauce and the fried onion were more like the tiny fried onions you can buy in a can - but I only saw a few of those. It was not good. Ice cold, flavorless and I  ended up throwing most of it out because it was hard to eat.

I chose this place because I am vegan, and everything there is vegan/vegetarian.  The food there was delicious - especially the Green Goddess bowl - not to mention, healthy.  I could eat that particular dish every day and never get tired of it - in fact, I ate it every day I was in Boston.  The atmosphere is straight out of the 60's - loved it!  For the down side,It took me more than 30 minutes to get through the line the first day I was there, which was late on a Sunday afternoon.   While in line, I noticed that there was peeling, chipping paint on the ceilings right above where the food is being prepared, and I could see cobwebs hanging from the ceiling as well.  They should definitely fix that!  There is also the hair issue that others have mentioned - seriously, no one wants hair in their food!  Also, as a business traveler, I have to turn in my receipts in order to be reimbursed for my meals.  They will give you a receipt, but you have to specifically ask for it (something I'm not good at remembering to do) - even when you're using a credit card.   Another problem was that the people who are taking the orders of the people who've stood in line for 30 minutes or more are also taking orders on the phone - while you're standing there waiting...and waiting...and then waiting some more.  Since there were two lines going, and I stood and watched 4 other people get served ahead of me in the other line, I finally had to get a little bit rude and say to the other lady taking orders, \\"Excuse me, but I've been standing here waiting for her to get off the phone for a very long time now, and I wondered if you would go ahead and take my order?\\"  I hated doing that, but they really need to have a better system so that sort of thing doesn't happen.  Bottom line - if you're vegan or vegetarian, you'll most likely love the food (meat-eaters, maybe not so much).  If you're a child of the 60's, you'll probably love the atmosphere.  If you're a germophobe, you probably will freak out about the cleanliness issues and decide to leave before you ever make it up to the register (and you'll have a while to make that decision).

Since it was my first time in Portland, we toured the city for a bit instead. When we returned to the restaurant they accommodated us all, although the space was cramped. We ordered a variety of different foods on the menu for all to share. We had the Kung Op Wun Sen (baked prawns), the boar dish, the chicken wings, baby back ribs, the roasted game hen and a noodle dish. Everything, down to the last bite, was fantastic!! The chicken wings were unbelievably packed with flavor. They were mildly sweet, with a nice balance of savory and spice. I wasn't too crazy about the boar myself; however, my husband was thrilled I didn't care for it because it was more for him. He said that it was like no other meat he's ever had and wouldn't mind if he had nothing else ever. It was definitely his favorite dish.

Their wine menu is extensive and very detailed, but their cocktail menu is not very descriptive.  I think it was meant for customers to converse with the bartender about their preferences, but we were sitting a bar area away from the bar so we were relying on the server to tell us about the drinks.  He seemed harried and in a rush so after a few descriptions, we just randomly chose a couple drinks.  I probably wouldn't have ordered what I ended up ordering if I knew the full description, as the drink was a little too strong for me...tasty, but strong.  We were well taken care of though, despite not sitting directly at the bar, so...well done.Bar stools are so comfortable, large and with a nice back to the stools.  The bar area tables are nice and spacious for all the food, drinks and purses!  Very customer friendly.  The decor is cozy and reminds me of the sea without being cheesy or obvious, and with lots of candles in the evening.

Not the 5 star of the Peking Duck house in NYC's Chinatown, but I was on Ohlen Road in Austin, right?  It wasn't quite as shredded and had bigger chunks of duck that made it slightly more difficult to eat.  Also, we had the occasional small bone mixed in which had to be dealt with.  The buns that they serve where not as tasty to me as the pancakes in NYC, but Ellen preferred them.  The Orange Beef was very good.  I'm glad we ordered it but truly it was too much food.  The duck ($25.95) would have been plenty for 4 people.  FYI, they are BYOB and there is a liquor store right next door!

It seemed an unlikely pairing with these meatballs,  but was perfect.  My husband ordered the Nonna's traditional, Mac and cheese, and chicken Buffalo bleu meatballs. He and I both agreed that the Nonna's traditional was the best meatball on that plate.  At this point, we were absolutely stuffed,  but the dessert display was too appealing. We ordered two desserts to go: the mascarpone cake with cherry butter and a lemon and ricotta filled pastry. I'm honestly not sure which one was better.  Neither was excessively sweet, but I definitely knew I was eating dessert.

The Shawarma Place is by far THE MOST authentic Syrian/Middle Eastern food in the state!

And by the way, they have the most delicious falafel and shawarma sandwiches, just like the old country.  No other restaurant in the state fries their falafels to order like The Shawarma Place.

I have missed out on sampling from the 'original' trailer-based experience, so take that for what you will.  I know, I know -- blasphemous.Here's my take on the Torchy's in the burbs.  This was my second visit.  This time, we waited about 20 minutes for our tacos -- but the place was PACKED.  Every table full, a line to the door, at least 10 people waiting for to-go orders and people streaming in to pick up sacks of tacos.  Seems like they have some improvements to make to get orders moving faster during crunch time, but things like this are to be expected at a new place.  I am patient.  :)Last time I tried two migas tacos -- which I think are a bargain for what you get.  I didn't realize how huge they were, so I could only finish one and took the other home.  This time I sampled The Democrat and I was not disappointed.  This shredded beef taco was amazing.  Not greasy, complex flavors, wonderfully seasoned -- it was a mouthful of \\"oohhhh\\" and \\"mmmmm\\".  My hubby tried the Green Chile Pork taco and loved it.  I tasted it, it was very good, but I liked mine better.Next time I hope to sample either fajitas or a burrito to see how those measure up.  The closest thing this compares to for me is Tacodeli (both from a quality and a price perspective).The queso seemed a bit pricey for what you get (at 4.95), but it has a real kick to it -- and on a cold day, it's yummy!  Next time we'll try the guac.Other interesting notes:  soda fountain has fancier offerings, including Dublin DP.  They also offer fresh-made lemonade (but no free refills).The real test is going to be when my sister comes down from Dallas.  She's a devout worshiper of The Taco Joint.  I'm going to see if I can convert her.Leaving 1 star for improvement -- they are still working out the kinks in the burbs.  Nothing fatal.  The quality is there, no doubt."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"If you asked someone what the menu would be at almost 99% Thai Restaurants in America, I think everyone could tell you at least 3-5 items.  Rainbow curries, pad thai, thom yum, etc.....I've never been to Thailand, but I always wondered, do all Thai people eat the same dishes?  Its almost like going to China and thinking that everyone eats General Tso's and Kung Pao Beef.  There isn't such a dish, but I digress.I had read about Pok Pok in an interview with Gabriel Rucker (the executive chef at Le Pigeon).  They asked him where he goes to eat when he isn't eating Le Pigeon.  Pok Pok was his answer.  So, I asked our friend about it and she totally loved it.  Like it or not, good chefs know where other good food is.  Pok Pok doesn't disappoint.  The food can be a little spicy but this is what I pictured real Thai food to be.  Just a blend of thai spices and seasonings mixed in different ratios and styles to get multiple different dishes that aren't named curry, pad thai, etc.  I was curious what the style was and the best answer I could get was Northern Thai food.  I don't know if this is correct but I'll go by it.  In short, I really wish there were more places like Pok Pok.  I love thai food and this is so not the usual Thai food I eat.

It's nice to find a cool coffee/tea shop on my favorite side of the Willamette River, sans hipster 'tudes. Cheers to that. I like their breakfast plate which is scrambled eggs, a side salad and prosciutto. However, the eggs seem to be hit or miss each time I go. Like, sometimes they are pretty bland and off-tasting and other times fresher and tastier. It would also be cool if they could add cheese to the scramble.The location is cool, in an old house, with super old furniture, along with good nooks and crannies to find a seat in. There's plenty of books to read if you come on your own - so go ahead, put down your smart phone for an hour and kick back. Parking is easiest in the morning on weekends, oddly.

One other is an amputee who walks with crutches.  Others have various disabilities.Accessibility here is excellent compared to its peers.We contacted Barlow ahead of time and queried about their accessibility.  They stated that they were compliant.  However, this does not always mean that in practice a bar is accessible.  Often, walkways are too narrow, particularly for wheelchair maneuverability or seating.  At one event, a certain bar stated that it was accessible only for us to find that it has stairs and that it has a regular client they lifted in and since this client did not mind, it deemed itself \\"ADA accessible.\\"Barlow, however, is an excellent choice for individuals searching for an accessible establishment.  The seats are low and padded enough for the individual with an amputation to sit comfortably.  No one opted to guide the blind individual to our table (or any table, for that matter) or help her avoid unexpected obstacles.  Instead, I noticed her entrance and subsequent confusion and aided her.One individual stated the music was too loud for comfortably hearing conversation though it did not impair my ability.  For the most part, Barlow is a rare mostly accessible bar downtown for individuals who may be coping with any number of accessibility issues.

There's one waiter who is hilarious and cool, but he's about the only person there who's worth anything.SERVICE:\\n- They are very wary about alcohol serving and literally tell you the \\"bottomless mimosa brunch\\" has an 1.5 hour time limit (lame). The waiter will also tell you \\"not to ask for a carafe\\" and that they will come \\"pour it for you when everyone's drink is low\\" (sounds like an excuse to be a lazy waiter)\\n- If you aren't drinking mimosas, you have to practically hound the waiter to give you a drink. I ordered a screwdriver and it took 15-20 min for it to come out after placing the order\\n- After the second attempt for a refill, I just went inside to the bar and ordered it myself -- which ended up being even worse, because the bartender assumed I was part of the mimosa brunch and seem perplexed when I told him I came inside to order the drink myself because the server took FOREVER... He was also wary about serving me like I was lying to him about the mimosa brunch and trying to \\"double up on drinks\\" (rude)FOOD/BRUNCH:\\n- Then comes the food... menu is pretty limited and only has breakfast/brunch items. No lunch menu. Understandable for a brunch spot, but still slightly annoying/inconvenient.\\n- The presentation is good, but the food itself tastes pretty bleh. Nothing special whatsoever\\n- A lot of the time the food has been a bit soggy too\\n- Also the \\"sandwich\\" isn't a true sandwich, it's just all the toppings on one piece of breadATMOSPHERE:\\n- Probably the only semi-redeeming quality of this place (reason I say semi is because only half of the property looks nice/developed)\\n- The inside bar area and outdoor courtyard/patio is nice and especially great on a day with good weather.

The menu is on the smallish side but from what I remember, all of the items have a reduced price for HH (every day from 5-7pm). I opted for the steak and fries. I also grabbed the drink special for the day - Makers Mark and ginger.I snagged a table in the corner near the front windows and except for the teenage girls that chose to sit on the sidewalk above right at that window, it was an intimate little spot that I could get lost in my book while waiting for the steak. The drink was absolutely yummy. Strong with big hunks of ginger floating in it. I asked for a glass of water as well and the server brought me a glass and a recycled wine bottle filled with chilled water. For someone who tends to drink a lot of water, this was extra nice! The steak was decent... not the best I've ever had but, you know. The fries were scrumptious and the entire meal was brought out piping hot and with the perfect condiments. I thought my server was attentive without being obtrusive, the meal was decent, and the drink above average. Oh yeah, and they were playing some freakin' great music as well.

I think the best ramen in town has finally arrived! I've tried all the other ramen shops in Portland, and Kukai gets it right on all counts. They have a dozen variations on ramen so you're sure to find one that pleases your palate. I've visited twice now, and have to go back to try more varieties of ramen. First visit was during their soft opening, when they were taking reservations to keep things from getting too crazy-busy while they trained their staff. We got a seat at the counter and had great service. My first bowl of ramen was the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. It came with menma, a soft-boiled egg, green onion, and a chashu pork slice. It looks like they grill the thin-sliced pork before adding it to the soup. The flavors were rich and meaty but not too heavy. They have \\"traditional\\" and \\"low sodium\\" versions - I got Traditional to have a baseline to compare to. Very very good soup! Thicker noodles than other bowls they serve.Son had the regular Shoyu Ramen. Also good, not as much flavor as the Tonkotsu Shoyu. Thinner noodles than my soup.  We also tried the pan-fried gyoza and found them delicious. Second visit was after the official opening. MOB SCENE at the front desk. They do not take reservations. We waited about 30 minutes for a table. [funny side note: one of the hostesses was soft spoken and got super embarrassed when the next name she had to call out was \\"Ho\\". If you are working in an Asian restaurant where there will be lots of Asian clientele, you gotta get over yourself. The crowd was large and she didn't raise her voice to be heard because she didn't want to yell out HO.]Anyway...ramen. I tried the Shio Ramen - thin clear broth with a great flavor. Lighter than the Tonkotsu Shoyu, equally tasty. Thin wavy noodles, greens, pork, menma. Deliciousness! Nothing  like Santouka's Shio ramen (which is my favorite food EVER) but still great. \\nHubby had the Spicy Ramen - I tried it and yep, medium spicy was plenty hot. I liked it but not as much as the other bowls. Also tried the Spinach Goma-ae - boiled spinach with sesame dressing, and the chicken karaage, which was perfect. Crisp outside, juicy and hot inside. 5 pieces on the small plate menu. The bowls of ramen are plenty of food, especially for the price. Average price is $10/bowl but you can add more items for a price too. Super nice staff, truly gorgeous space with laser cut wood, lanterns, and other items imported from Japan. Easy parking. I'm a fan!!"},{"name":"DONYA","address":"950 SW Washington St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Probably my favorite food cart downtown.

We were not promptly attended to- there was only one waitress working. We were given a small table for 2 near the doorway, which was nice because we didn't have to share the large table with 2 other parties,but bad because we were slapped with a large gush of cold air every time the door opened or closed,which was quite often. About 15 min after arriving, the restaurant was filled and the notorious line out the door began. I ordered a small portion of the squid ink pasta with olive oil and garlic. It is one of the top 3 most popular dishes and apparently a must try. The dish tastes exactly as it is described. Squid ink pasta doesn't taste much different than normal pasta, it just has a different texture. It tends to be a bit thicker and chewier.The olive oil and garlic sauce complimented the pasta perfectly. Although I don't think I'll crave this dish often, I'm definitely glad I tried it. My friend ordered the fish and chips. The fish chunks are cut in squares and still include the fish skin. The portion of fries was pretty large and the tartar sauce tasted homemade. Our lunch experience was quick, delicious and filling.

They were offering this $6.95 lunch special where you could order various Thai/Vietnamese rice/noodle dishes. For an additional $2, you can add an appetizer which consists of soup, salad, a wonton dumpling and two tiny pieces of what appears to be crispy dumplings. I decided to get the Pad Thai with Pork. The lady got the Vietnamese Fried Rice, which is known as the Com Chien, while I believe the dude got the Pad Kra Pow, which consists of some chicken, mixed peppers and a spiced up sauce. It comes with rice. The soup was pretty good, liked the wakame inside. The vegetables of the salad were fairly fresh. The dumplings were fairly decent and the sauces were pretty good. As for the Pad Thai, the noodles were tasty, but the pork was a little dry and needed to be more tender. I did like the flavor of the Pad Thai, but I think they could do a little better. The lady and the dude seemed to have really liked their dishes and we had a great time catching up while enjoying our food. I did get my stomach fairly full, mainly because of spending the extra $2 on the appetizer. Interior was pretty good, a decent choice to set up an inexpensive lunch appointment. Overall, this place is at a great location, within walking distance of Fenway, Newbury Street, Back Bay, Symphony Hall, and the Christian Science Plaza. Although I believe can find better Thai and Vietnamese places, I think this is a pretty solid choice to get some decent Thai and Vietnamese food for lunch for under $10 without leaving Back Bay or Fenway."},{"name":"Pinky's Famous Pizza","address":"165 Main St","city":"Medford","stars":"3.5","text":"Granted, i've only had Pinky's once, but it was hands-down 5 star quality.

However, this restaurant cries out for you to try every last thing on the menu lest ye leave unsatisfied and it isn't hard to hurt yourself trying.So I opened my well preserved pallet last night for my first General Tao's chicken; yes the joke was made \\"Why have the Colonel's chicken when you can have the Generals?\\". Also tried my first beef won ton's. These two new food groups and been permanently added into the future eats mental menu. The chicken didn't have the crazy nose bleeding spicy power I always thought it would have and well, won tons in my world have always been in a soup bowl so fried with beef was new. Heck, one even had a couple of random shrimp in it!  These two new additions were both awesome!  And this was just two of the 5 or so appetizers we ordered! I'll save you a play by play of our meal, suffice to say we were there from around 7pm to 9ish eating almost the entire time. We had at least 10 different dishes moving around our circular table with multiples of some so there was no running out. Each plate had an amazing helping for a very reasonable price and though we didn't leave much left when all was said and done, there was still a bit to be brought home. The service was EXCELLENT! This is the best service I believe I've ever received at an Asian restaurant. Our drinks never ran dry and once the food flow starting coming it just about didn't stop. The turnaround time from when we started ordering to the time it hit the table was phenomenal. Also, if you're looking for a nice atmosphere, their setup is beautiful. Just keep an eye out for the roasting ducks to your left when you walk in; they kinda creep me out but are neat to look at none the less since you might find yourself eating one.... or two... Overall, this is definitely a 5-star place. Perfect for a large group and seems like it was be nice for a small romantic setting as well.

I was surprised how small the shop is, there are only 4-5 tables cramped together and then there is a wall with a large cut out where you can see straight back to the kitchen.  I was a little concerned when we were a party of two seated right after a party of 6 with no one else in the shoppe and I heard the owner get on his phone and say \\"you better hurry up and get in here, we have a rush going on.\\"  We ended up waiting about 20-30 minutes for our food, which wouldn't be so bad if they made some improvements in the dining area like playing music and most importantly, fixing the front door.  It has no pneumatic door closer so it SLAMS every time you go through it and the owner must have walked in and out about 5 times.  In a small space this gets very disruptive.Being such a small operation the owner was the one to seat us, explain the menu, bring our food out, the check and clear the table (since they only use plastic it's not to big a deal).  He was very friendly and you can tell passionate about his food.  For drinks they have coke products and only offer bottled water.  They list \\"Orlando Craft Beer\\" on the menu but don't actually offer any at this time; they told us they were still working on their license.  The menu has SO MANY CHOICES!  The basic process is you chose if you want your meatballs to be served on a side or in a \\"smashed\\" sandwich (like a more traditional sub) then you choose your meatball (they even have vegetarian and gluten free options), then chose your sauce and the side you want it served on.  I went with Nonna's traditional meatballs with red sauce on creamy polenta and I thought it was all pretty good.  You get 3 meatballs which are a good size and it also comes with a small salad and piece of foccacia bread.  For $8.95 it's a pretty good deal, but I wish the drink came with it too.  Everything is homemade fresh, in house daily.  My boyfriend ordered the sausage meatballs with pepper and onion which were good but a little overdone, on top of penne and creamy provolone sauce.  They forgot to put the sauce on the dish but it actually didn't need it, although it was very strongly peppered and had some burnt bits.  I like that they have weekday specials where you can get $1 meatballs which would be great so I could try all the other ones that sound yummy (chicken parmigiana and Mediterranean lamb? YES PLEASE!).  They also offer an entire \\"bucket of balls.\\"  Yep, that's right, I laughed like a little kid too- where you can get a whole bunch of different flavors and would be great for a large group."},{"name":"Firehouse Tavern","address":"38 S Vernon St","city":"Sunbury","stars":"4","text":"This place is great.

For the most part I was really surprised how much of the buffet was rather fresh and while we were there they were constantly churning out sushi and various other dishes as food disappeared. The variety was also quite nice from the sushi to hot plates.Hot bar had a lot of fried seafood and noodle dishes. Lots of variety to choose from in case you or someone in your party isn't about the sushi there is at least a decent amount of options for them. The skewers they had on the side bar were really good too. Especially the shrimp.As far as sushi went they had raw to cooked or seared. Also glad that it was decent enough to not make me sick. Nothing seemed off which was one of my bigger reservations about going to a sushi buffet.As for desserts... I gave it a bit of a pass. Ice cream seemed good, but the rest wasn't anything particularly special. It works though if you need a quick sweet fix at the end of your meal.Not a lot of veggie lovers options. They did have a few dishes that might comply, however this place is really about getting your fill off of sushi.I ultimately would probably just pay to eat lunch at a non-buffet sushi spot, but wouldn't say no if invited out again to this place.

That's why i'm all for places that let you make your own..whatever. I need to love everything on my sammich! Is that so wrong?\\nWell, that's why ESB (aka my lover) is amazing. They have some of the most amazing ingredient combinations ever. It always comes out light and each flavor complements the next. I swear they have the executives of the Food Network locked up in that kitchen helping them through these key decisions. \\nOkay sooo here's the deal. Get the Calamari. Yes it's fried, but only lightly. Whatever that means. But do it. Trust me. Also the Bistro Burger. What is it? Well...Strawberry Mountain ground sirloin, grilled and served with lemon aioli, tomato, avocado, Nueske bacon, lettuce and caramelized onions. Yeah. I know.

I ended up getting the Spicy Pork, Nonna's Traditional, and Chicken Parmigiana which came with a salad and focaccia bread. They were all really delicious but I believe the traditional was the best.We were served by Isabella who took her time telling us about the menu and giving her opinion on what to get. She was very nice and helpful for us very indecisive people.However, they do not serve tap water because their pipes are old. So, if you are a person that likes to save money on not buying a drink when they go out to eat, I suggest you bring something with you. Also, despite having really good food, I was still a little hungry after having my meal. The portion seems just a little small since it is only three meatballs and your sides. I definitely was tempted to get more but I didn't think it was worth the price.In any case, they had really yummy food and great hospitality.

Too bad we had to fight for it.When we got there, no tables for brunch were available; no problem, we could order take out sandwiches and wait in the park area and they'd call it out for us. But that meant that, as we pulled three consecutive items out of the bag that were not what we ordered, we ended up having to walk back across the park each time.-We ordered a wrap and a panini; one came with chips, one came with a choice of chips or salad. We took salad. Two salads and no chips made it into the bag. They fixed this up. On the upside, the chips are nice Kettle ones.-The rosemary foccacia panini we ordered was neither foccacia nor panini; it was ciabatta, and not grilled at all. We had to take this one back, because $8 is pretty steep for a sandwich and I'd expect a bit more quality than that. Once they fixed it, it was pretty good. But no apology for serving us a sandwich that was completely wrong. -Grilled veg wrap: I asked for wheat wrap; it came in white. The receipt even said white, so the person at the register tapped it in wrong. She had nodded when I asked for the wheat wrap, acknowledging that she heard my request, so it wasn't just that she didn't hear it. By the time we pulled this third wrong thing out of the bag we were tired of walking back and forth just to get what we ordered so we ate it anyway.I'm fine with substitutions but you need to inform the customer so they have the option of ordering something different if those changes don't work for them. If we hadn't been eating right in the park and had walked home or elsewhere, it would be a one star review, as we couldn't have gotten what we ordered.On a last note, I have a hard time believing their chai is \\"the best chai in Central Square\\"; I had the iced chai latte and it was like drinking heavy cream.

They've changed managers, employees etc and still the service sucks and god forbid you want an extra sauce, you gonna pay for every single thing overpriced. So yeah that's my take on this place. I wanted to give them a 4 but I feel there are many other Lebanese over priced food that I've had that gives me great service and great portions. I think if they hire one really nice person for the register and give folks a good portion of sauces and quit charging us for a tiny little container for the amount of food we order they will get a 5 Star from me.

Full bodied and smooth with a hint of spice. I plan on going back for this wine and hope to eventually buy something similar from 3 sisters. $6. Ouzo and vodka shots for $4, 1516 Lager $4.FOOD for HAPPY HOUR Spanakopita was fresh and flakey. Definitely the best spanakopita I have had in a long time. $4 for their Happy hour size, which is quite small so we ordered two! I am planning on coming here for dinner and ordering a whole sized Spaniko and I am not sharing!!   :DHappy hour Calamari was pretty decent at $8. Lightly battered rings, with tasty flavor. The calamari was cooked well, but seemed a little generic. No little squids or tentacles, just cookie cutter rings. Dip was good, but I prefer mine with more garlic.They do have a small to moderate sized patio. It's not as nice as some of the neighboring patios, but still an awesome option with summer in the air. The tables on the patio are the long communal style, which I don't care for myself. Could use a little TLC. My two complaints for the star losses are..... #1 We were charged for $6.50 for each glass of wine when the happy menu said $6. We didn't notice until we looked at the pictures I took. #2 was the service.  Our server wasn't overly personable, but he was helpful with our questions, however we thought it was very strange when he left his shift for the day without letting us know. We wanted to pay and tip him, but he took off lol. It was annoying because we sat there for a bit wondering when we could pay. We had to go inside and talk to a different server. Honestly, if we were jerks we could have easily walked out without paying and no one would have notice.

Is this place all hype or is it worth enduring the wait? Find out below. First, a brief history of the owner Andy Ricker: Andy Ricker is the chef/owner of Pok Pok Restaurants, with branches in Portland and NYC. He first visited Thailand as a backpacker in 1987. Since then, he has spent several months each year living, traveling, eating, cooking and studying the food culture in Thailand and neighboring countries. He is also the founder and managing partner of Pok Pok Som (a drinking vinegar company) and is managing partner of  Pok Pok Thaan (a charcoal importing enterprise). Among other achievements and accolades, Andy is a two time James Beard Award winner and best selling cookbook As we arrived at the restaurant, there was already a crowd outside waiting, we went to the host and asked how long the wait was which was about an hour to two. Of course, this did not dissuade us and we hunkered down and waited. Thankfully, they use an app to see which place you are so you can easily walk around the nearby downtown area while waiting for your seat. Eventually, we got seated at the bar area. Of course, we already knew what we were going to order:Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings  \\nHalf dozen fresh whole natural chicken wings marinated in fish sauce and sugar, deep fried, tossed in caramelized Vietnamese fish sauce and garlic and served with Cu Cai (pickled vegetables.)

Ever.  I've been here twice.  The first time, we got the wings, one of the current specials, and unfortunately I don't remember what else, but I do remember it was all amazing.  This trip, we again got the chicken wings, the papaya salad and the boar collar.  I'm not normally a fan of chicken wings, but their wings are amazing.  Likewise, the papaya salad and the boar collar we both amazing.  The food was all a little on the spicy side, but since I love spicy, it was perfect.  We also tried the tamarind, black pepper thai basil drinking vinegars.  They were all super good - the thai basil or black pepper if you're looking for something a bit more interesting, but the tamarind was definitely my favorite.  Now, as many other reviews point out, you have to be aware of the line.  It was ~1.5 hour wait when we showed up at ~7pm (the previous time I went, we showed up ~5 and only had to wait about 30 mins.  Not sure if that's still true though, since that was 5 years ago).  They do take your phone number so you can wander around a bit while waiting at least.

I got a chicken burrito with a side of beans. And the price was definitely affordable, but the taste was just awful. I was starving and couldn't make myself finish it, it was that bad. The chicken was a weird gray color and tasted like dirty dish water. I was so disappointed. Atmosphere: This was problem number one for me. You can tell that the owners don't know what they're doing when it comes to decorating, and that's okay with me for a place like this. But the smell! As soon as I walked in all I could smell was bleach. And while it's refreshing to know that the place is definitely clean, it's still very unappetizing. I planned on eating in, but after I smelled the place, I ordered my food to go. Service: Brush up on your Spanish before you go.

First off, do not come here if you are counting carbs because pasta is in EVERYTHING.  I do mean everything too.  Soup or salad?  Doesn't matter, they both have pasta in them.  Every single entree does as well.  I am dismayed they haven't found a way to work it into the tiramisu yet.  Back to those house salads, they had very old rotting lettuce in them.  A quick scan of the steel cage death match sized dining room was horrifying.  Everyone else's salads were gross, but they must need new glasses because they couldn't see rotten lettuce inches from their face but I can see it two tables over.  Don't know why they couldn't taste/feel it with their mouth as a final layer of defense either.  The wedding soup was a much better choice, but the eggs in it had been cooked hard, a la egg drop soup style, and in case you don't know, they're not supposed to be that way.  They are supposed to be stirred in at the end to lend a creaminess to the broth.  My friend has a penchant for cream sauce on his pasta, so it was no surprise his predictable ass ordered exactly that.  Too bad that they decided to put an entire stick of butter in the sauce.  I am not joking.  It was ridiculous.  He said, \\"tastes like the butter sauce they put on the popcorn at the movies.\\"  That make you hungry?  Naw me either.  I tasted it, shit was wack.  Oh, and the wine was lacking this time.  I am guessing that they have a price point set in stone, and if they can't find anything decent below it, they'll serve up some swill.  The servers all appear to be photogenic airheads from the local high school.  Thought that was just the one I got last time, but they're all that way.

I was in this place with my mom, and there was only 1 other customer at the time. There is a little TV playing spanish music hanging off the ceiling and not all the tables are positioned to see it, but that didn't matter to me. Seating is definitely limited - if memory serves, there were about 8 tables. But the place didn't look like it gets serious traffic or anything anywaysOnce the other guy in there left, it was just my mom and I with the hostess/waitress/owner/wonder-woman. She was the most friendly woman I've ever met in a restaurant! She even sat down with us for a bit and we kind of shared stories. If you're reading this, I hope all is well for you!FOOD REVIEW:\\nI honestly don't remember too much of what we ordered, but the chips were fresh and the salsa was yums. I hate some Mexican places where the chips are stuck together or you can tell they just dipped them in oil to give them life and they are usually not salty enough for me. I like to be able to eat the chips by themselves and they can hold their own flavor-wise. This place had chips ON POINT.My mom, being talkative and easy to convince to get superfluous menu items or something she doesn't need, got a burrito or some kind of wrap that wasn't anything to write home about, but ordered a nachos special that made up for it. The pulled chicken that is usually prepared Mexican style in this place was spot on - seasoned well, juicy, and flavorful. Honestly though, those nachos could have been made at home, but it hit the spot really well. I ordered some kind of enchilada dish or something that was quite tasty and the cheese level was above average (read: bonus!).\\nI apologize for not being able to clarify further on what we ordered, but I went to this establishment in I think September and I just now remembered to complete the review :(Was not particularly pricey, we just ordered a healthy amount of food for 2 people. As we talked with this ridiculously friendly woman, she insisted we try the horchata and some other jasmine/flower tea thing. I hadn't had horchata in a while, so my mom and I got a to-go cup to split. While the woman claimed it was homemade, which I don't doubt, it was in one of those typical smoothie tumbler machines so she could just lever it out. I would have liked to see it kind of simmering on the stove or something to really validate the freshness, but it was okay. VERY DELICIOUS and a perfect way to finish a spicy Mexican meal.\\nIf you're ever driving on that highway in Orlando towards the airport (God knows the name) and you see a small little Se√±or Frog's, STOP AND GET READY TO EAT!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is one of the most raved place in Portland.

The wings are marinated in fish sauce and sugar and tossed in fish sauce afterwards.- Kaeng Hang Leh: It's a pork belly and pork shoulder curry. The curry was too subtle, to the point that it might not even be there. Really needed more curry. - Het Paa Naam Tok: Basically a mushroom salad with a lime-like dressing. Way too spicy to eat. Couldn't finish it. And also a bit too salty.- Brussel Sprouts: typical brussel sprouts dish. Not sure if it's because I'm from SF or maybe the chef was having a bad day. Oh!

I was initially leery of the place as Asian places that purport to do more than one Asian cuisine often can't do both well.It was a pretty darn cold evening in Boston - perfect for a steaming bowl of Pho! I was praying that their Pho Ga was made with a chicken broth - NOT a beef broth like the lazy Pho places offer.Lo and behold, when I arrived and read the posted menu outside the door - it specifically mentions that the Pho Ga is made with a rich chicken broth! Score! So I ordered the Garden Rolls and Pho Ga.The Garden rolls were very tasty, filled with a very fine shred of iceberg lettuce, like a very fine Chiffonade, and herbs and shrimp, rolled in rice paper, and served with a peanut dipping sauce. Of course I added Sriracha sauce directly to the peanut dipping sauce, as well as applying additional squirts of Sriracha directly to the rolls. Very yummy!I can't speak for what the Thai food is like, but the Pho Ga was excellent! Rich, savory, tasty broth, tender chicken (white meat), noodles not clumped or overdone, fresh sprouts, lime, and Basil.One thing was off though - no hot peppers offered on the plate of veggies/aromatics. Most places tend to offer jalapenos. I asked my server - she said they had no jalapenos. I asked if they had something comparable. She told me they had these really hot small green Thai chiles. I asked if she could bring me some. She asked if I wanted it whole or chopped up. I asked her to please slice or chop it up.So she brings me this small souffle cup half filled with the sliced green Thai chiles. She is looking at me with this dubious look - like she thinks there is no way I can handle these peppers. I tasted one and then proceed to dump most of them in the broth. I though her eyes were going to pop out of her head! But she didn't say anything.The peppers made the broth delightfully spicy and hot! As regular readers of this Yelpers reviews probably know - I love hot, spicy food and have never encountered something that exceeded my spice capacity. These peppers made the broth significantly hotter than jalapenos. But I loved it and after eating all the chicken, noodles, and veggies (with many squirts of Sriracha sauce added directly to most bites), I added some Sriracha sauce to the broth, stirred it in, and began slurping down spoonfuls, the drained the bowl. It seemed like my server came to check on me a couple of times as I was guzzling the broth. She asked me how it was and I told her excellent!

Not too long ago they decided to open up an outpost in this country.  Where to do this?  Seattle and San Francisco might be logical options as they both have good Asian populations.  Portland was the choice.  Wait.  What?  Portland?  The whitest city on the west coast?  Really?  Ok.  People in Seattle and San Francisco walk around with confused looks on their faces.  It has nothing to do with this restaurant opening up in Portland.After talking about it for a long time, some friends and I finally made it here.  A few of them had already been here before, but it would be the first time for 3 of us.  Ramen is the name of the game here and you should order it with gusto.This is not an inexpensive meal, but you get a ton of food.  Ramen comes in a small (which is not small at all) and a large (which is very very large) size.  The small runs around $9.50 and the large is closer to $14.  You can do well with the small and some other small plates.  We all ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen -  chashu pork, kikurage mushroom, green onion and noodles in a rich pork & soy sauce broth as our main dishes with other smaller plates like seaweed salad, bacon wrapped quail eggs (melt in your mouth goodness), calamari rings and grilled bacon skewers to start us off and sate our appetites.First the ramen, as that is what you should be coming here for.  Not sure if they house make the noodles.  I'm thinking not.  Four of us ordered the small size which is plenty big if you have a good appetite.  One ordered the large and that portion was huge.  This dish is something else.  So much flavor.  The veggies were cooked to that perfection between tender and crunchy.  The pork just melts as soon as you put it in your mouth.  The broth is damn fine.  Not too salty which can definitely ruin a dish like this.  That is some good eating.All the smaller plates we tried were made with care.  Everything was.  I could honestly eat the bacon skewers all day as well as the bacon (noticing a theme here?) wrapped quail eggs.  That was a suggestion from our server and she was spot on with that one. Speaking of the service.  It was good.  Mostly.  We did sit for a bit after being handed our menus.  She came over with water but then disappeared for a while.  After that, she was around without being too around.  Cleared our plates when we were finished with them.  Filled waters when waters needed filling.

Between 5 of us, sharing food family style was suggested, but it wasn't feasible, I got around a bite of each dish, (we ordered 5 dishes) because the portion size was extremely tiny! Don't suggest family style dining if the plates of food can only feed one person and maybe fill that person up, though doubtful. The Sticky rice ordered separately was such a tiny amount of rice, they could at least say, oh you should order 1 per person because that might actually be enough for you, sharing was not enough for everyone.  The 3 hour wait on a Saturday night was ridiculous, they just want you to spend all your money on drinks and appetizers across the street at Whiskey Soda Lounge first then spend more money on overpriced food at the restaurant.If people are really into something that they believe to be \\"just like what you get in Thailand\\" and will frequent this establishment because it's the \\"thing\\" to do, then good for them.

High energy was the vibe and bright, open eating space was what greeted us as we took in the surroundings on our first visit, with only an hour left till closing (7a-2p today; check before you go). While checking the food options, I was momentarily distracted by the creative homemade drink sign hanging by the registers. For food, we chose the Iron Goat - biscuit, spinach, and goat cheese- and the Chicken Club - biscuit, fried chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and honey mustard dressing. The biscuits...for fast casual, they are flaky and seasoned and delicious! Not doughy, not greasy. In fact, nothing we purchased was greasy. The fried chicken coating straddled the too moist and too dry just right and contained the right amount of seasoning. Saut√©ed spinach and warm goat cheese combined with the biscuit to provide a satisfying vegetarian option. The Red Leaf Coffee is roasted nearby and received a thumbs up from a fellow Yelp Elite dining with us who enjoyed their latte.

You simply have to try it! From the creator of Bunk Sandwiches and the original Pizza Jerk, Pizza Jerk 2 delivers excellent, high-quality pizza in a relaxing, laid-back atmosphere. Opened in June 2018, this spot is relatively new to the SE neighborhood, but will hopefully be a lasting addition to the neighborhood. I am a total pizza fanatic, but there is something truly special about Pizza Jerk. I believe this is due to the seriously high quality of ingredients featured (e.g., Bunk hot peppers, Old Salt pepperoni, local honey) and the special East-coast style of crust featured here. At the SE location, Pizza Jerk features a smaller, more condensed menu relative to their NE shop. They focus primarily on slices to go, though there is ample seating, free wifi, and beer if you're hoping to dine in. I've tried a handful of different slices from here, but my top three (in order) would be the \\"It's Always Sunny in Cully,\\" \\"Lovely Linda (vegetarian slice),\\" and their \\"Old Salt Pepperoni.\\" As someone born and raised in Honolulu, I have always been a strong advocate for no pineapples on pizza. However, after trying Pizza Jerk's \\"It's Always Sunny in Cully,\\" I'm a total convert. The combination of caramelized, bursting-with-flavor pineapple rounded out by the spiciness of Bunk hot peppers, the saltiness of the mini Old Salt pepperoni alongside the sweet drizzle of local honey, and the freshness and herbiness of the basil, makes this a pizza unlike anything else I've tried before. Everything tastes so well balanced, yet so unique, and the perfectly stretched thin dough is a wonderful vessel for the toppings. If you're not a fan of thin crust pizza, I recommend their cast iron pies that feature a much thicker, ciabatta crust. I normally stray away from thick crust pizza because I think it's too greasy, but I like that Pizza Jerk's isn't. In my experience, basically everything here is simply done right. Their pizzas are fantastic, sure, but so are their salads (thick cut garlic-y croutons, yum) and house-made dilly-ranch. They should seriously bottle that stuff up and sell it in-store. Finally, the service here is always really nice and helpful. I'm always greeted with friendly smiles when I walk in, and there seems to be good camaraderie among the workers.

Accompanied the meal with a delicious Taiwanese carbonated Apple drink, Apple Sidra, which I have not have had for many years. Oh so good.

My friend Travis recommended it by running over to my desk every other day and telling me to go down to Portland just to go eat at it.  I had been warned about the mega waits and so was surprised when they had a spot for two Friday at 7. However, this spot was outside, in the open-air, in an area that neither the heating lamps, nor the plastic blocking the wind could reach. Fuck, I was freezing and am still really surprised they were even seating out there.Overall, I have decided this is a place based on chicken wings as the papaya salad was like every other Thai papaya salad I've had, and the fish ball curry was absolutely inedible. It was so dark outside it was hard to see what was in the curry, but I kept biting into slimy bits that had hard crunchy things inside. Neither the flavor, nor the texture was appetizing.Thai food should be spicy, as all the flavors salty, spicy, sweet, and bitter must balance. The waiter warned us that the dishes we ordered were spicy, but they really lacked that heat, and therefore that balance.I can assure you that if this was a chicken wing stand I would give them 5 stars, but it ain't, and while it wasn't awful, it was disappointing."},{"name":"Ceviche Tapas Bar & Restaurant","address":"125 W Church St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Ceviche is VERY yummy.

I tried food from the truck earlier this year (during the springtime), but my memory of it was pretty hazy - even the next day! - since a few friends and I had some drinks at Tom and Jerry's before checking out the food trucks. I needed to make a second trip here before I could write a decent and fair review.Both times that I ate at this truck, I had the Ragnar√∂k, which is the truck's signature burger. Unfortunately, I don't remember its exact ingredients (I didn't take a picture of the menu during either visit), but the burger is very tasty. (See the picture I've provided.) If you've tried this burger, then you know how good it is. I was tempted to order something else during my second visit, but didn't bring enough money and still had to get a few things from some other trucks that night, so I didn't go overboard at SwedeDISH. Maybe I will try something different next time, perhaps as soon as this coming Thursday since I am planning on going to the WPFTS then.The woman who works at (or owns?) the truck and who has taken my order during both of my visits is very friendly. The truck seems to be enjoying success throughout town and I hope that it remains one of the mainstays in our city's roster of trucks.Check out its Facebook page, www.facebook.com/SwedeDISHFoodTruck, for the latest news. It frequently is updated and you often can find out when and where the truck will be open. The two times that I've been to it have been at the WPFTS, though the truck makes the rounds throughout some of our city's food truck events. I've seen it in Longwood, Winter Park, at Tasty Tuesdays in the Milk District and several other places. I may add a 5th star to my review at some point down the road, though I'm going to have to bypass the burger during a future visit or two and try a few other menu offerings before giving the truck a 5-star review. For now, though, it's, to me, a very high 4!"},{"name":"Prairie Fire","address":"242 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Ask for Carrie she's an amazing waitress!!!

Though I never order chicken and rarely eat fried food, this was a leap for me. And it paid off. The chicken was juicy, crisp and not at all greasy. The flavor was buttery and the portion was just enough. As with Sara's review, the menu stated spinach, but the dish came with broccoli rabe--a pleasant surprise for me!So-so's: The lobster mac and cheese was good. Cheesy, not clumped together, topped with crispy breadcrumbs. Though we'd ordered the side of mac and cheese ($6) we opted to add lobster (an add'l $6) and were pretty underwhelmed. For the extra $$, there were two small pieces of lobster in the dish. We each got one bite.The disappointments: We'd asked for a specific cocktail to be made with a specific liquor and were informed that they didn't have it, even after the waitress double checked. We ordered wine instead, but later found out that they actually did carry the liquor. Neither the waitress nor the bartender knew, even though the bottle was prominently displayed behind the bar. And no, the bartender did not know how to make a caipirinha. In a pro vs. con consideration, Lobby Bar comes out about even. With a little more focus on the bar program and a few more chunks of lobster, Lobby would be a place not to miss. Right now, it just misses the mark a little."},{"name":"Cask'n Flagon","address":"62 Brookline Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Meh...not great.

I walk to it, although the walk home with a few cocktails in me would be HEINOUS...This restaurant/bar/cigar room is located in the Beaverton Shilo, where many a restaurant has gone to die. most have lasted about a year, and then they leave in the middle of the night..... I have tried over an over again to support them through several incarnations and re-inventions.....but nothing really ever took here.The Mark has been here less than a year, but with it's later than usual Happy Hour (3-7 and 9-close) and it's bistro inspired menu items, it has got Hubs and I  ready to take a long look at The Mark.I'm hoping this place makes it, because:1)It fills a void for quality, non-fast food  with an emphasis on American Bistro fare in Beaverton.2)It may (pray pray pray) break Canyon Road of it's apparent love affair with the adult industry. I\\"m all for self-expression and good times, but Canyon Road has become the Westside answer to Burside or.....when I have to explain to my 10 year old daughter asks me what a lap dance is, because the businesses on Canyon Road are advertising them as I drive her to school, we have a problem..... Hubs and I used to love to go to the Italian restaurant that was adjacent to the Greenway Inn back in the day, and this place reminds me of that....old school Reagan era atmosphere (think wood paneling nautical) but, with a nice updated menu.THE FOOD:\\nThe Happy Hour Menu has lots of great items, and the fish tacos were tasty. the hamburger was money, but my all time favorite is....the tempura green beans served with aoili.....sooooo unexpected and so good. Several specialty cocktails for $4 on HH, and wine and beer specials to boot. I really can't wait to try the rest of the menu.THE STAFF:\\nI've been there 3 times now, and like to sit back and observe....this is a place struggling to find it's identity and fill it's tables, but there is no sense of desperation. Instead, the staff seems genuinely happy to be there. Supportive of each other, and just plain NICE!

There are different variations of the eggs benedict so you can pick based on your palette. The food was definitely anything BUT disappointing. The hollandaise sauce was extremely tasty and delicious. I got the peach bellini here and thought it was a little strong for my taste but they gave me the leftover wine cooler that they didn't use up in the peach bellini which was a plus. The waiter was really friendly and I loved how they used an ipad payment system so you can pay with multiple cards and you guys can each individually choose how much you want to tip. The place is small and can get crowded but there was never any pressure from the waiters to hurry up and it was great. I would highly recommend coming here in small groups just because it is such a small space, but also it's a great place to connect with people one on one.

Perhaps just an isolated incident, as I've there a couple of times before without the same horrible outcome, but it must be mentioned due to their inability to rectify a bad experience.We walked in on a Sunday night without a reservation but after just a few minutes, we were promptly seated at a table in the bar at a just-cleaned table with a napkin smeared with wasabi under the place setting. It took nearly 15 minutes for a waitress to approach us for our drink order, at which point we were informed we couldn't order food from the Happy Hour menu unless we ordered drinks. Ordering soda water (as they didn't have any sparkling water on their menu) apparently didn't qualify. We ordered the seaweed salad, an octopus salad, a sushi roll and, sizzling salmon rice. The seaweed salad came out first and as we finished that, the octopus salad arrived, then shortly after, our sushi order. Not in any great hurry, and though long finished with the rest of our meal, we weren't worried when the rice dish failed to make an appearance. After about 15 minutes, we asked the waitress about it. She replied \\"What? You haven't got that yet? No? Let me go check.\\" She came back to tell us that the kitchen was all backed up and it would be out soon. We joked that she forgot to put the order through the kitchen, but when she kept walking past our table with other people's food, that joke wasn't funny anymore. When I made eye contact with her again, after another 10 minutes, she stopped by to ask us if we'd got our order yet, to which we replied a sad \\"no\\". Joking about getting the bill and going across the street to dinner, we patiently waited for our rice dish wondering if it would be cold when it finally arrived. Ultimately, after an hour's time from when we ordered, and just as we were preparing to ask for the check, the rice dish made it's grand and long-awaited appearance, accompanied by a chef or manager who explained there was a communication problem in the kitchen. The rice dish was not worth the wait, the salmon was grossly overcooked and the dish was overpowered with scrambled eggs. Again, my date and I joked about the experience wondering if they were going to charge us for the sizzling salmon and rice. Of course they did. After screwing up on their service, they added insult to injury by leaving us with a sour taste in our mouth. They need a lesson in hospitality. After making a mistake with someone's order, a restaurant should do something to make the experience a good one. It would have gone a long way in my book had they comped the measly $12 order or offered us complimentary dessert. Instead, I left knowing I would not go back, and tweeted just that to my nearly 4000 followers."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Thank you for the most delicious pasta and gelato of my life.

I don't eat sushi so I ordered the chicken teriyaki entree.  The chicken was sauteed nicely and still juicy, the teriyaki glaze had a great smoky and not-too-sweet flavor, the veggies were sauteed but retained a firm texture, and the steamed rice was perfectly sticky.  While everything was cooked well, it was chicken with veggies and rice so it wasn't amazing.  My entree came with a green salad and miso soup.  I'm not a fan of miso soup, and this was too fishy for me.  The salad was cool and crisp, but with too much salad dressing so I only ate the top portion because the bottom was drenched. My meal was pricey at $17 (including 18% gratuity for the group), so this wasn't a cheap chicken with veggies and rice meal.My coworkers all had the sushi buffet and went back a few times to fill up.  Everything looked really pretty and my coworkers snarfed it all so it must have tasted good. They think it's reasonably priced at $12.  On the way out, I looked over the hot bar buffet and was glad I'd ordered a separate meal.  I'm not a fan of buffets and this one looked picked over like all the others I've seen.  The sushi buffet was much cleaner.  I think because the sushi chefs are standing behind the sushi buffet counter making the sushi so people aren't as likely to pick something up and put it back and there are no sauces dripping all over the place.  I'm writing my review so that people who aren't too sure about eating sushi know that there are chicken and steak options if sushi isn't your thing but it's a place you have to go.

While the clientele is interesting, it's the food that makes the visit truly worthwhile.After seeing this place and driving by it a half dozen times, we decided to try it out on a Friday night, on a whim. Arriving around 8PM, there was a bit of a wait, however, we had a table in 8-10 minutes. We were ravenous and the list of choices made the decision a bit difficult, we ultimately decided on a grill special and a pizza, to get a sense of the range of the place. Lamb tips and baby back ribs were amazing, the lamb was ordered medium-rare and cooked PERFECTLY, which is tough to do right and is one of the reasons I almost never order lamb out. The baby backs, a bit dry, were LOADED with meat. I am not sure I've ever seen ribs this meaty, with a sweet sauce on them and the whole thing complimented by perfectly done fries (mashed, rice, or veg are the alternative options.)The pizza was even better, light, thin crust with tangy cheese and delicious meat toppings (we ordered the Reginaldo and highly recommend it.) The fact that this place still does it up old-school with the salad first, a huge plate of bread with delicious dipping oil to start doesn't hurt either. Drink menu has  a bunch of \\"martinis\\" many of which were being consumed by the aforementioned fake-n-bakers. Martini glasses of bright blue, orange, and pink cocktails lined the tables in the bar area and I'm sure all of them were as teeth-rottingly sweet as the Mandatini we ordered. At $7.50, you can't go wrong and can always order the real thing. Yes, this is a four star review and, at the outset of writing it, I had to consider my reasoning for it, as I was thinking about this, my dining companion pointed out, \\"I have a hard time finding what's wrong with the place.'

The server who looked at the burger was very apologetic. Then the owner/chef came out and completely disrespected our entire party. \\"I'm not making another burger so I don't know what y'all want me to do!\\" Then we asked for the manager and received the reply \\"Aum pot ona\\". We were taken completely off guard by his aggressiveness and dogmatic disrespect. He literally yelled at us as if we were small children and made me feel extremely unsafe. I will never eat here again. The subpar food and the overwhelming unprofessionalism of the manager/owner has irrevocably stained my view of this establishment. I have never felt so sad, low, and threatened in my life. I'm utterly dismayed and disheartened that someone would be so rudely abrasive. Please save your time and money. Henri's and Joes on Juniper are great nearby places with great customer service. Having worked in customer service before I knew to still tip the server, none of this was her fault. Perhaps if the owner who was outside sitting down smoking cigarettes while talking on the phone when we left, if he spent more time brushing up on his culinary skills and professionalism this type of encounter wouldn't happen again, but I'm not confident that it won't.

And yes, it does get very crowded at times so there could be a bit of a wait time. \\nBut the food is absolutely delicious. Great for vegetarian, vegan and meat eaters.

The service was okay at that point, but not great. When I found out the restaurant would be open on New Year's day, I decided to treat my sister and two teen-age daughters when they came to visit. I have never received such poor restaurant service in my life.We stood at the door entryway for at least ten minutes before we were taken to a table. The restaurant was not crowded. Many tables were available. The staff seemed totally uninterested in seating us. They would just walk by us as if we weren't standing there (the sign clearly said, \\"Please wait to be seated). I should have walked out then.Once seated, we placed our orders, then a pot of hot tea was brought to our table (no cups to drink it with). I thought it was brought as part of the service of the restaurant. I had to flag someone down for cups. He asked how many cups. \\"Four cups -- one for everyone sitting here,\\" I said incredulously. (Hello!) Later, as I looked at the receipt, I noticed that I was charged an extra three dollars for the tea. I asked my guests if they had ordered the tea. No one had. All four of us ordered our separate dinners. That took at least ten minutes to arrive ... at least part it. Only two of the orders were brought. My plate was set in the middle of the table, instead of in front of me. My niece was served her dish in front of her. So, I told everyone to try some of mine (since it was in the middle of the table). I don't like to eat until everyone is served. So, we kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting. I flagged down the waitress and asked where the other orders were. She said that we should eat these first and the others would come later. What?!After 15 minutes, the other dishes arrived. During the time that we waited, I suggested that we leave, but my sister and her family didn't want any confrontation. So, we stayed. But, imagine how I felt. I was trying to entertain my guests at a restaurant in which we were being treated rudely. If I had been alone, I would have walked out -- no doubt.As we sat there, I noticed two Caucasian couples entered the restaurant. They stood at the door and waited as we did. They looked as perplexed as we had. Once again, they were obviously being ignored as we had been. There were even less people in the restaurant by this time, but the staff just let them stand there. I was tempted to walk over and tell them that the service would only get worse, but that would have only been speculation on my part.I will never go to the Din Ho restaurant again. This restaurant serves a high volume of Asians. (I have nothing against Asians; I have several Asian friends, but I'm not fond of rudeness from any group of people.) From what I experienced and from what I observed, Din Ho has no desire to serve Caucasians.I can take a hint.

It is a rather unremarkable place in so many other cities--and yet, here, in Vancouver, where breakfast is the maligned sibling to the Caesar-soaked shindig that is brunch, Deacon's rather straightforward take on good breakfast food seems special if only for its simplicity.I should have gotten the chicken and waffles--I assume that's why you're coming here, right? Well, on a bit of diet, I limited myself to egg breakfasts, and while Deacon didn't disappoint, it didn't wow either. My scramble was uninspired, though I realize calling a plate of scrambled eggs 'uninspired' misses the point of scrambled eggs to begin with. So they were fine, beyond adequate even, and our table was plied with copious amounts of cheap hot sauce--as it should be. Service mimics something of a U.S. 'greasy spoon' or a Vancouver dim sum restaurant where staff are not woefully absent but they're hardly glad you came either. Our belabouring over the finer points of the menu, was not warmly received. The decor inside feels a bit scattered--especially on the fringes of well-curated Gastown, where Edison bulbs hang demurely from so many cute stores and restaurants. Given Deacon's neighbours, an extra dose of charm would help swallow those prices at the end of the meal a bit easier."},{"name":"Maple Street Biscuit Company - Oviedo","address":"978 City Plaza Way","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4.5","text":"Maple Street Biscuit was excellent.

Once you place your order, instead of asking for your name, they ask you for your answer to the question of the month which is posted on a board at the entrance. Ours was \\"What is your favorite Halloween candy? Candy Corn!!! I thought that was neat!The place was clean and the wait wasn't long at all.

I may have been handicapped by being on the Vancouver WA side, where volume appears to be rewarded more than quality.  I mean, there are a few pretty good places, but not like this.  Fantastic tripas tacos with two tortillas and onions / cilantro.  Good-sized tacos, for $1.50 each, not enormous but a good-sized street taco.   They chop up the tripas so's they are crispy all over, and ask whether you want them crispy (I do).  That's five stars right there.  I also got a couple of carnitas tacos and they were superior carnitas, crispy edged tender pork. \\n \\nAlso the guacamole is actual guacamole - thick and rich smashed avocado with enough salt and a smattering of onion and tomato.  Not avocado sauce, a strange and unsatisfying substitute.  I also got a plate of beans and some chips, which were fine.  This option was not on the posted menu, but the cost was minimal, three bucks or so.The restaurant was very clean and well fortified with pointy steel fencing.  It appears to have been split so there is a bar area on one side, we did not go over there.  It was very old Portland - As we left,  we passed an older gentleman wearing house slippers, pushing a grocery cart containing a large gasoline can, while expertly smoking a long cigarette, no hands!   He was squinting the one eye like a cigarette pro, and not concerned about the proximity of the gas can.

The space is cool-- open and airy, with a vintage/industrial feel. Cement floors and copious reclaimed wood give it the same vibe that many establishments in the area are working with (Catalyst, Puritan & Co, Area 4...), but Commonwealth has set itself apart a bit by using antique furniture pieces in the displays: a retro stove stocked with the peanut butter and Nutella, a shabby chic hutch for napkins and silverware, etc. It adds a personal touch and makes the decor feel less generic. There are three spaces in Commonwealth: a market, selling local produce and other provisions; a sit-down restaurant; and a lunch grab-and-go counter. There's also a little bit of seating for those ordering from the lunch counter.Prepared food: high quality, low value. I got the farro and squash salad for lunch. I don't need a huge lunch, but this portion was meager, even for me. None of the salads had much of a protein component, aside from a sprinkle of some nuts. I felt $9 for the small, protein-deficient salad was steep, especially when you compare it to the offerings at nearby Flour. As an alternative, I wish they had more vegetarian sandwiches (their current menu only offers one choice: hummus and quinoa tabouleh). But the quality of ingredients was great. I also grabbed a cup of house coffee. Meh. Fine. Drinkable. But it's not their specialty.I'm especially excited about the market part of the store. Kendall is a wasteland for groceries. Their merchandise was a little expensive, but that's expected for a place that's touting local products. I kind of wish they had mentioned the source of their produce on the tags (mostly so I could mentally justify the prices). It's definitely not an option to do ALL your grocery shopping. But to run in for a quick baguette or those carrots you forgot (or the chicken liver mousse you've been dying to try), it's perfect.

No alcohol until 11AM....so we made plans to visit the Liquor Store after (which, by the way, is open at 9). \\nAfter perusing the menu I decided on a Mediterranean scramble which was described as having asparagus, feta and tomatoes. Sounded perfect! I am one of those rare people who is not a fan of onions (I can handle a few but so many places use them to add bulk to a meal. I call them the \\"filler vegetable\\") so I asked if there were onions in it. Our server wasn't sure but said they could add them if I wanted.

Partway through waiting for our food, when our server walked by, I asked if she had found out about the onions and she said 'Oh, I had them add extra for you.\\" I explained that I DIDN'T like them and she said she would go back and tell them to remake it without onions. When she returned, she said they add their bruschetta mix to it (why is this referred to as 'tomatoes' on the menu when it is clearly a mix of tomoatoes and onions?!) so it would have a few which I conceded would be fine. \\nShe returned suspiciously soon with our meals (by which I mean, there is no way they remade it without the additional onions) and it was chock full....\\nAt this point, I just wanted to get to that liquor store and go home to a delicious Caesar so I ate only the asparagus i picked out of the eggs and planned to eat the shredded hash browns (but guess what? They had onions added to them!!) and just called it a day.My friend said her Benny was 'okay' but it was served on slices of baguette instead of English Muffin which seems like a cost saving measure to me.

So, armed with the address in my phone from the SEND TO PHONE Yelp feature, off I went to seek the best damn chinese food outside of the Bay Area (so they said).First question - 'do you serve dim sum' - answer - NO.  Second question - 'do you have a lunch menu' - answer - NO.  I'm thinking 'hell, what did I go to this trouble for...'.  I said to the very nice waiter who only knew the word no, 'please get me an egg roll and chicken lo mein'.HOLY COW.  First result - the food came out in less than 5 minutes (critical at lunch time).  Second result - Egg Roll was fresh and fantastic.  Third result - chicken lo mein was out of this world.I was done in about 1/2 hour and made it back to the office by the end of the lunch hour, full and very satisfied.I guess they may be right.

I'm not a huge pasta person and I had my reservations waiting for a place that has only maybe 20 seats and doesn't take reservations. I was pleasantly surprised. Food: some of the best pasta I've had in my life. Must get the homemade squid ink pasta with ground squid, garlic and olive oil. Then had linguine in white wine sauce with mussels. Add a side of broccoli and that was enough for the 3 of us. Extra authentic points for them serving the pasta in the pans they are cooked in. Ambiance: tight and busy. This place is tiny and the kitchen is right there in the dining room so you can see everything. This is a true gritty experience.Our waiter was part of the family that owns the restaurant and it was great hearing about their history and plans for the future. This place is the real deal.

Moonshine shots were taken, mojitos and margaritas were sipped on and we ordered the pretzels with pimento dip and the bacon dip. Both were fantastic.The pretzels are a great choice if you have a little one because they are soft pretzel sticks (3 of them) that are super delicious and buttery. And if your child loves bacon like ours does they'd probably be down with eating the bacon off the top of the bacon dip (which is caramelized onions, cheese and bacon) with toasted sourdough.Once it was our turn to be seated we went inside to be seated at a good size table. There was water in mason jars waiting for us and the music playing was bluesy rock which our kiddo was crazy about.They had really well seasoned popcorn waiting for us at the table as well (instead of like chips and salsa ) which was a huge hit.They don't have a printed kids menu but they do have a kids menu and no joke the Mac & cheese may be the best mac & cheese I've ever had! My daughter and I split the BBQ chicken, however it was a little spicy for a 4 year old, hence why we ordered the mac&cheese. The chicken however was fantastic, very moist for BBQ chicken. My husband ordered the corn flake chicken salad which was delicious as well, while other members of our party ordered the salmon, the veggie wrap and a steak.Wine was drank and plates were cleaned to the point that an extra side of grits had to be ordered (because they were that good).Then came dessert. We were so full already but the white chocolate bread pudding was to hard to resist. We ordered 1 slice for the whole table and everyone got a decent size bite (easily splittable between 2 people, however it was good enough that you probably wouldn't want to share)I highly recommend this place.

I was willing to forgo the patio because, hey at least we can find some respite from the sweltering summer heat right? Again, no such luck. A couple ancient fans were scattered around but they did little to help circulate the stagnant air or the pungent perfume of our waitress.

I saw Stacy F's review and bookmarked Maple Street earlier in the week and knew I had to try it out ASAP as the menu sounded perfect for both my boyfriend and I, who have completely different tastes in food (I'm vegetarian, and he's not exactly a vegetable lover). I'm always on the hunt for new cheap eats, especially for brunch/lunch. It was easy to find, just try not to miss the first turn into Oviedo on the Park or you'll have to backtrack some. The parking lot is ridiculously small with many entrances blocked off, but hopefully it'll be better once they open those up. We were in a wider car so it was a bit hard to get in and out, just as a heads up. Upon entering we grabbed the menus and took a few minutes to narrow down what we wanted, as there were SO many delicious looking choices. I wound up getting the Iron Goat which was delicious and savory. My fiance got the one with pickles, fried chicken and honey mustard, and really enjoyed it. We also got a side of mac and cheese which was amazing in flavor, but unfortunately was a super small serving, even at the $4 price tag. Not sure if I would get that again. It was also somewhat lukewarm, but I tend to like my food piping hot. I ordered a cortado which was nice and strong. We went back and got an iced cinnamon pecan biscuit which was really big and while tasty, it was a bit strange of a texture, so I don't think this is a star menu item. That said, their regular biscuits are SOOOO good, I will definitely return for more, and so many of the sides and other menu items looked and sounded amazing.

(If you are one of the lucky ones who gets to eat regularly...rejoice, be grateful, and always treat a meal with reverence.)I love food experiences. Cheeky and informed servers. Good vibes. Thoughtful decor that parallels the food offerings. Bar tenders who understand the care of cocktails. Clean plating. All the stuff that makes the food, when delivered, taste even better. Unless it's Pok Pok. They could serve me their food, in an alley, on a trash can lid, with a feral cat as my dinner companion and I'd STILL give it 5 stars. I've eaten here numerous times and am heading back in November. My mouth is already watering. Many of the dishes are served as shares...family style. Andy was named best NW Chef. I own the Pok Pok cookbook. Best Thai in the country. No joke. So, I'm gonna keep this simple. Here are a few of the things I love at Pok Pok. Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings. I feel that everyone should have a taste of these before they die. Yam Samun Phrai. It is nothing short of a party in your mouth. If I were you I'd make sure you are firmly seated when taking the first bite. Laap Pet Isaan. Laap is one of my fav Thai dishes. I always get it, when available, at Thai restaurants. It's fun to see how each one prepares it. Pok Pok takes it to a whole other level with duck, duck skin (have mercy) and duck livers. Bursting with a medley of well layered flavors.Pork Belly. Anything they serve with pork belly is worth eating. Especially if it's cooked for two days and served in a little crock. Vegetarians, relax, lots of wonderful dishes available for you too!I have had their cocktails, \\nBloody Mary- really good with the wings. \\nHunny - grapefruit juice with lime, honey drinking vinegar and tequila. Everything fresh squeezed. Never had desert, not enough room. Stuffed.So take a walk, let it digest and the head to Salt and Straw (artisan ice cream) right down the street.Pok Pok and S&S are two of my fav places to eat in the Northwest.

And then we waited for about 5 minutes, and for no reason, the waiter thought we were staring at him and told us to \\"not stare at him, and that he was preparing our table\\" in a very rude manner. So moving onto the food, we ordered the fried calamari, squid ink pasta, pan fried swordfish and some cherrystones. Unfortunately, the food was ALL atrocious. The fried calamari was lukewarm. The squid ink pasta had pretty much no taste to it. The swordfish was hard and cold. The cherrystones were huge, but they tasted super salty.Furthermore, the 'rude waiter' forcibly added 18% tip to our bill. Frankly speaking, the service and the food did not even deserve 10%.

We had a delightful meal on a surprisingly nice early November evening.  We sat outside as there was live music blaring just inside the door.  Everything was top notch.  I wish there were a place this good and this authentic in my neck of Silicon Valley.Our two servers were prompt, friendly and willing to chat (one of them had a bandage on her finger from her cat).  The decor feels like a nice family run restaurant in Italy with modest wood tables and chairs and all sorts of Italian (sports) stuff hanging all over the place.  A cluttered but warm feeling.The food was lovely, generous and authentic.  Their specials included a beef tail in tomato and tortetellini stuffed with cheeses and meats in chicken broth, the latter which I had really wanted, both because it is so good and because it's not something I see often (pasta in broth).  But the papardelle with wild boar was equally compelling, ever since my stunning introduction to that dish in Cannes, Australia.  What to do?  So I asked if I could get a half portion of the tortellini and they said, \\"sure\\".  And our server then mentiond getting just half orders of salad, since were were getting a lot.  Which we were and so we did.The food was authentic and delicious across the board.  I wanted the food to be more salty but that's an understandable slant.  My wife's linguine with runny egg and proscuitto ... was a really rich carbonara.  The tortellini was delicious as was the obviously freshly made papardelle.  Portions were large, but not excessively so.They had 5 beers all Italian, which were fine.  Their wine list was solid and appropriate for this restaurant.  (I passed on wine as I had been wine tasting all that day).I'm half tempted to come back here, even though we're only staying in Portland for a few days.

Not even a tiny complaint.Let me elaborate. Waiter, Jane, dressed in traditional Thai clothing, met us with a formal greeting, and let us choose where to sit. It was a rainy Sunday 11:00 a.m. with three other tables nicely spread out to give everyone some privacy. Jane's genuine warmth was felt right away, asking if we'd like to sit beside each other or across, wanting us to be as comfortable as possible. With his suggestion, hubby and I sat beside each other on comfy booth style couches, watching the rains pour outside as we pondered over the tempting menu.Jane made perfect recommendations for drinks, offering me a taster of their special Thai tea, a mix of tea and fruit juice - loved it. Hubby and Jane shared the same high regards for good quality mango juice.We enjoyed probably the best vegetarian spring rolls ever. Very lightly deep fried, creatively cut and presented on a rectangle shaped plate of coloured shredded lettuces. Could have had seconds of those tasty rolls.For lunch I had Authentic Pad Thai, very flavourful, not too spicy at all, easy on the bean sprouts, piping hot, and deep bowl full. Hubby had the Panang which he really enjoyed. I had to remind him to slow down and enjoy it - he wanted to gobble gobble it was so good!Yes, the food was excellent, the very subtle music was excellent (however I'd rather listen to Thai music instead of North American standards when I'm eating in a Thai restaurant - oops, don't let that count as a complaint though), the atmosphere was excellent, relaxed and not rushed, but the best part by far was the service. Jane made us feel so welcomed, wanted to interact yet always politely excused himself when he came to present something, or ask if we needed anything. He was so genuine in his love for his job and his customers. He used to be an airline flight attendant, and has worked in 5 star hotels, and his heart sang of happiness for customer service. Jane's happy 40th birthday was celebrated the night before, in addition to catering for 200 people and running the restaurant. I hope when the sun comes out this week (finally after 3 months of rain) that Jane takes some time off to relax.

I called a week in advance to make reservations, but somehow they didn't make it into the book. After much back and forth with the hostess, my friend finally secured us a table. The restaurant was nowhere near capacity at any time during the night, so there was no reason for us to have had to beg for seating.We were told in advance that there was no cover charge, but that everyone was a $20 minimum food/drink charge, so we planned to order accordingly.Our table of four was given one menu to share, and we almost ended up sharing that with the table of three beside us, as they weren't given any until we asked for extras and they asked for one, too.The menu looked exciting, but the food was late in arriving, and a huge disappointment. Two of us ordered the Barbeque Mashawi, which was supposed to come with grilled vegetables and either rice or fries. They arrived with only three thin slices of tomato and a pile of raw diced red onion as vegetables, the rice was possibly cooked in bullion but had no real flavour, and though the two kebobs of prawns were tasty, one was even more overcooked and dry than the other. This, for $17.95! The third friend at the table ordered the kabsa, but was told about a half hour after ordering that it was unavailable.Hoping to redeem the meal, we asked to see a dessert menu. The waiter had to check back with the kitchen, before letting us know that there were *no* desserts available that night, because according to him, the kitchen hadn't expected many people.Frustrated by the food and the experience, we planned to tip accordingly, but the bill brought an interesting surprise: a 15% gratuity had been added for us!

Sweetie took a taste of the last starter, and opted for a serving of her own.We both feasted on roasted turkey with cranberry sauce and gravy, and roasted prime rib with au jus and roasted garlic horseradish.Sweetie enjoyed the prawn scampi with a white wine and garlic butter, and I sampled their oven roasted Oregon king salmon with lemon buerre blanc.It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without a dollop of mashed potatoes, traditional stuffing, and baked green bean casserole.Although Sweetie turns up her nose at Brussels sprouts with shallots and bacon, when she tasted half a sprout from my (third) serving, she agreed this is a great dish.Okay, reading this far, you realize I haven't given a critique of each dish - so here goes: Fresh, deliciously prepared and graciously served.Except for the candied sweet potatoes - somehow, although browned on top, the potatoes were uncooked - crunchy as if raw, but warmed. However, I wasn't chastised for leaving them on my plate.For dessert, I opted for the traditional pumpkin pie. Sweetie selected apple pie, and a big slice of a decadent-looking chocolate cake. When she realized she was too full to eat the gooey chocolate confection, our wait person simply brought over a To Go box.  So, if you're looking for a holiday feast, at a good price (about $27/each as I recall), one can not do better than The Mark at the Shilo."},{"name":"The Meatball Stoppe","address":"7325 Lake Underhill Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Good food the White bean ragout is excellent and the mini cannoli are awesome.

I bought a lot from Ebay and Half.com and lo and behold many of the harder to find used titles came from this bookstore called Powell's Books in Portland.  At the time I didn't realize that Powell's Books was (and still is) the largest independent bookstore in the United States (uh, and maybe the world?).  The store takes up an entire city block.  It is 4 stories tall.  You will get lost in here.  They have maps.My inaugural visit happened to be the weekend of their 41st anniversary.  What a treat!  The streets outside of Powell's were closed off and filled with free food, free book fishing games where you could fish for free books, free cotton candy and popcorn, various drinks and speakers and a few singers.  Some of Portland's most beloved and famous authors were there to give a mini reading on what they loved about Powell's.  Chuck Palahniuk was there and gave a surprise book signing event that he secretly announced on his blog only hours before that I missed getting in line for because I didn't know about it (DAMMIT).  Chuck's mini reading on Powell's Books was about how when he was writing Choke he would hang out in Powell's for hours doing research, as where else could you find a store that had books with detailed maps of the lay-out of commercial airplanes plus tons of kink?  Michael Powell was also in attendance during the festival.  I entered a raffle and even won a free stainless steel Klean Kanteen that was branded Powell's Books.  This is an annual anniversary event and I encourage anyone to bookmark this for next year if you love books.There isn't much more to say about the inside of Powell's as they anything and everything you could want.  They even have coffee and fun stuff like goofy cards, iPad and cell phone cases and decorative art.  Powell's is a major Portland institution and a Must when visiting the city."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Whoa. What is all this Pok Pok rave all about? If you are easily offended by the smell of fish sauce, stay 20 feet away. I may be biased, coming from LA with a slew of authentic Thai eateries and traveling to Portland to try their rendition of Thai food. Or this one star was from the lack of customer service from the moment my friends and I stepped into Pok Pok. So if you want to know about the food, don't read on because I won't address it. This review goes to how rude staff are. 1-Pok Pok was third lunch. Had Clay's Smokehouse first and take-out from Bollywood Theater second. We didn't see anywhere to throw away our take-out boxes so packed them up neatly and walked over to Pok Pok. The hostess said we can't bring outside food (even if it's packaged?). So we told her it's trash and she pointed to the back and told us to toss it. As we walked to the back to throw it away, a server came up and asked what we were doing because it's a health hazard to throw it away. Ok. Make up your mind. 2-some friends ordered Pok Pok Bloody Mary's, which were awful. Like drinking vodka tom yum soups. When we kindly informed the waitress that they were not to our liking she said, 'yes, they are different.' We ordered a soda and a different cocktail off the menu, and when we got the bill, the Bloody Mary's remained on our tab. I guess it's customary to charge for untouched cocktails at Pok Pok, instead of switching them out complimentary. 3-the restrooms were in between the kitchen and the restaurant, of which the servers yell at you for getting in their way. I'm not sure where else is appropriate to wait in line.

My lasagna was good, it was by no means bad at all. But I really feel like the sauce had no flavor, I felt like I needed to add salt and I NEVER salt my food. It just tasted like layered noodles with nothing in between topped with sauce and cheese. I love melted cheese and noodles so again, it wasn't bad- I was just expecting some more flavor to amaze me and I didn't get it. I would go here again, but not order the lasagna again.

It cost $28. There was fatty skin attached to all pieces of my duck breast, and a leg bone with no meat on the plate. The breast was chewy and the veggies were under-cooked. Over half of my colleagues were not happy with the quality of the food they received either. Maybe they comprised quality with speed? There was no service either from our waiter, as we had to ASK to get pepper and cheese for our plates. AND we waited half an hour for him to figure out our individual bills, which were brought to us one by one, with the help of his colleagues. Our waiter was Jamie if I'm not mistaken.

I have had better fried chicken wings elsewhere.  Pok Pok has ginger beer on top, and a nice, cold glass goes well with a lot of the spicy dishes.

I wanted to keep eating it because it did taste really good, but I couldn't handle the heat. We also ordered the wings spicy and it turned out to be the perfect about of spice.If you're familiar with Portland then you already know this, but there's no parking lot around here.

I can't wait until the sweet potato pecan pie is back but I'm fine with the brownie a la mode. Be prepared to wait for at least an hour on the weekends.

The stars are entirely owing to the complex flavors and excellent qualities of the wonderful food served at the Cafe. We live in Lexington and we have patronized Khushboo Indian Resaurant, in Lexington Center, for years. The trouble is that , while Khushboo is a pretty elegant Indian restaurant, the portions have grown smaller while the prices have grown higher over the years, to the point where this disparity impedes my enjoyment. Further, the food at Khushboo is rich with cream and oil, and I ALWAYS ended up with indigestion after dining there.  When a coupon advertising menu for Bollywood Cafe arrived in the mail, I noted that they had several starred dishes listed, featuring no cream, and less oil. I was all for that, so we ventured over there that very night. The three of us were absolutely delighted with everything we ordered. The Chatt Papri was divine, as good as you could ask for, with wonderfully balanced notes of sweet, salty, crunchy and savory. YUMMMMM does not begin...... The Vegetable Samosas tasted as though they had not actually been fried, there was no noticeable fat or oil anywhere, yet they were lightly crispy on the outside, as they ought to be, and replete with potato-pea curry goodness inside. To Die For!!My daughter wanted her usual Tandoori Chicken Tikka, and it came, tender and delish with not a few highly seasoned grilled veggies as the garnish, yet there was much more there than just a garnish. We ordered curried chickpeas and Aloo Ghobi, and again, there was no noticeable trace of fat or oil or cream anywhere, just a perfect balance of spices and flavors. I did not get any indigestion and we honestly can't wait to go back there soon. Our server was delightful and he told us that they offer the less oily, less creamy dishes because that is what their customers told them they desire. The food was superb and so much better for not being rich! I don't like to feel guilty after I eat, so this attention to the fat content is a real blessing for me. I am grateful to the customers who requested this feature from their local Indian eatery!

If you are an avid reader or interested in getting back into reading then this place is definitely for you because you could literally get lost in here for hours.

The server was a pretentious brat, which although annoying, was humorous because it didn't match the ambiance.  We waited nearly 30 minutes after placing our order for appetizers before we saw our server again.  She must have seen the displeased look on my face and quickly came to give a half-hearted apology for the delay.  Her attempt at an apology was, \\"there was a mix up in the kitchen\\" blah blah blah.  The appetizers finally arrived after about 45 minutes. We understand that things happen, but it was frustrating that it took so long for the issue to be addressed.  Fortunately, the manager came by shortly after, gave a sincere apology, and comped the appetizers.  She was empathetic to the situation and it helped save our evening.   After the alleged \\"mix-up\\" we didn't see our server for the rest of the night.

I don't like to refer to other reviews while writing my own, but some of the piddly bullsh** people are complaining about is ridiculous. You can get a better sandwich at the grocery store? Really?Maybe Whole Foods, but you'll pay more. One truism I've learned: some people are never satisfied.I know it's a chain, but Corner Bakery is far and away the best casual-take-a-number sandwich/soup/salad/baked good purveyor out there. The quality and tastiness of the food is so much better than Panera, Au Bon Pain, Cosi, etc. (We don't have the latter two in Austin, though.) I even prefer it to my beloved Texas French Bread. When I worked in downtown Chicago, Corner Bakery was a lunchtime staple. Their catering was also awesome. The pastry basket alone is mesmerizing.So I was ECSTATIC when I learned they were coming to Austin. I gave them a few days to get the opening-week-kinks out and then the husband and I headed up to the wilds of the Arboretum to get some lunch. I was like a kid on Christmas, I kid you not.The food is just as good as ever. I like to order the Corner Combo. Half a sandwich with a cup of soup or salad. My favorite sandwich is the Uptown Turkey - turkey, avocado, bacon, on multigrain bread (hold the mayo). The Chicken Pesto is also great, as is the Tuna Salad. I also like that they've added \\"plainer\\" sandwiches to the menu - just turkey, tuna salad, etc. without the fixings. Helps to keep the calorie count down. Speaking of which, I LOVE that they post calorie counts on the menu. I know Panera also does this, and I think it's a great way to get people to think about what they're putting in their mouths. You can modify many of their sandwiches to make them a bit healthier.The chicken noodle soup is the best, and it's relatively low in calories. I do not have as much experience with the non-sandwich menu, as I love their sandwiches too much to feel like experimenting. But I have had their paninis, which a lot of people seem to be complaining about, and they were fine. The only two breakfast items I've sampled are the oatmeal (perfect for a cold day - if we ever have them) and the cinnamon raisin french toast. Sugary amazingness.Desserts need their own separate paragraph. Cookies, mini bundt cakes, lemon bars, cheesecake brownies, cookies - I think I've had them all. You cannot go wrong with any of the desserts. If health, weight, and longevity  were no object, I'd eat one of their cookies every day. One flaw, I do have to admit, is the layout. The other CB's I've been to had wide open spaces in front of the counter to accommodate lines. This is not the case here, and when it's crowded people seem to wander around confused. There is also not a lot of space around the soda fountain, so people congregate around the tables nearby. So don't sit by the soda fountain!I'm so glad Corner Bakery has come to Austin (All I need is an H&M and my retail dreams will be fulfilled).

I offered it as a suggestion because it was well-reviewed and we were craving some Asian food. We glanced at a few Yelp reviews, saw that it was a buffet, and thought, what the hell. We were under the misconception that it was a buffet, AND you could also order from a menu. Nope--it's exclusively a buffet.This is not a place for tiny tummies. I am the person at dinner that eats half a hamburger and half the fries, and saves the rest for later. So I really really tried to eat my money's worth here. I don't think I entirely succeeded, but maybe got about $15 worth out of it, so not bad. Lunch is around $20 per person, with a drink and closer to $17 without. The selection is what really makes this place, I think. There's just SO MUCH. Not only sushi for the boring (California, Vegetable), but also for the more adventurous (Rock 'n Roll, Rainbow). They even had some of my favorites, so that's a win!They really run the gamut in tastes and textures here. You've got raw, veggie, cooked, crunchy, spicy, and savory. There are also plenty of sauces and additions, like ginger, wasabi, spicy mayo, soy sauce, and daikon. Okay, so now you know about the quantity, what about the quality? Naturally, I've had better sushi. But I've also had worse. The fishy smell/odor that goes along with non-fresh sushi is minimal here, and even non-existent in the more popular varieties. I think it's a safe bet that this place would be great for people who haven't experienced much sushi. They get to sample a wide plethora and determine what they do actually like, and they also get to sample other dishes as well.My favorites? I love crunchy rolls, volcano rolls, spicy yellow tail, and anything with avocados. I'm not a fan of cream cheese, octopus, eel, or the chewier kinds. But the beauty of this place is that you can sample something and not need to get anymore if you don't like it. Besides the obvious sushi menu, there's also a decent selection of hot items as both entrees and side dishes. Rice, tempura, various fish (beautifully displayed, I might add), teriyaki, noodles, etc. The dessert menus is small, but varied enough that you can have one of everything and not feel like a fatbutt. A few I sampled were green tea ice cream, some kind of yogurt/gelatin mixture with fruit, flan, and something with a soft, cheesecake consistency. A word to the wise, the menu online is definitely not the entire menu they offer--more so a rotating option that depends of availability and seasonality.PROS:\\nHuge variety of sushi.\\nDecent selection of entrees and desserts, too.\\nThey take away the plates very quickly.\\nFairly fresh sushi options--little to no fishy odor.CONS:\\nExpensive price tag if you don't eat a lot.\\nNot exactly the most authentically prepared sushi.\\nSmall parking lot.\\nMy lunch companion and I were VERY under-dressed. Maybe it's not the fanciest place, but I feel like jeans don't really cut it here. We felt kind of awkward and out of place.\\nThe server expected me to pay a tip (which I usually do, even at a place like this), and she didn't give me exact change back. I REALLY hate it when they do that! I prefer the option of leaving them the change I was given or using my own bills. I always tip less when they don't give me my change back.THE VERDICT\\nGreat place if you enjoy sushi, or have a friend who is new to the game and should sample many different kinds. I've been eating sushi for a couple of years (I'm a bit late in the game), but I finally got a chance to try a lot of sushi that I had either never felt like trying, or was nervous to try. The servers take away your plates quickly, but she was slow on delivering the check. It definitely seems more of a fancier kind of place, something that's probably a good date or business lunch option (yes, even though it's a buffet). I might come back... If I were treating someone for their birthday, or another special occasion, but it's difficult to justify the price tag when I can't physically eat enough for it to count."},{"name":"Sushi Nami","address":"1315 Lonsdale Avenue","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Good sushi, good environment, good service.

I just can't imagine what they liked about the heavily wet doughy pizza and cheese steak subs!  Both had a ton of pepper on them (even the pizza dough!) and were both made with such little care that we asked to see a manager.For example; When a description of a pizza like the house pizza I ordered states extra mozzarella as part of the description I expect that to be all over the pizza not just over a part of it.  And I also expect the other ingredients to be spread somewhat evenly around the pizza too, but no, apparently that was just asking for too much effort on the part of the cook!  I am also pretty sure and surprised that for $10.49 they went crazy with the cheap ingredients like peppers and onion and skimpy with items like the bacon and other meats... cause all I could taste was peppers and onion!  I noticed too that some people in other reviews got to try two types of pizza on each half of their pie. Sure wish my waitress would have suggested that as I was having trouble deciding which one to order and could have at least tried the red potato skin pizza (I believe it was called) along with the house pizza. Very disappointed.  My friend's cheese steak was also very heavy on the pepper and onions and very light on the cheese and steak. Neither my friend nor I were interested in a lunch time beer but I suspect that may be why so many think the food tastes so good there - alcohol tends to dull taste buds.The waitress was cheery and though we gave her our feedback (and my dining partner and I had already vowed to each other we'd not be back) she begged us to give them another chance!  Really?  No way. I can get mediocre food at Hungry Howies for half the cost.  I seriously do not think this place will be in business 6 months from now when people see the reviews don't match what they get there.Last, on the way out of the store, their large sign blew into my friend almost breaking her fingers as she tried to stop it from hitting her. The host saw this and came out to pick it up, and I commented about the danger to people.

The marinara was nice and light, so as not to drown the food but complimented it nicely. The cheese-nice and smooth and gooey! The topper was the fusilli, which is house made. I was a happy camper, as the portion was so big that I got three delicious meals out of it. As to my friend, she got chicken marsala with fusilli, and she gave it five stars-cleaning her plate. She got a couple of martinis with her meal, and said they were some of the best ones she's ever had. Raso's has two new fans here. We will having many more 'girl's night' dinners here!

I'm sure the people behind me loved that as I slow down and stick my phone out the window to take a picture.)Anyway, these signs drug us in for 50% off of everything, on our famished way home to cook lunch, it was like a sign... actually like 6 signs.... Held by 12 year old's you just couldn't say no to.  A burrito, taco and nachos later, hubby and I were sampling and MMM'ing our hunger away. Tacos are almost as good as Don Pedro, yet way closer to my house. Burrito was burrito-licious, huge and I took half home, I'm a sucker for left-overs. Hubby said his nachos were the bomb. So, another sign was advertising $1.95 breakfast burritos. I think it was maybe 4 days before we gave it a shot. Hey, it's literally like 6 blocks away, easy to stop by after Fred Meyer. So, choose Bacon, Ham or Sausage, $1.95, pretty big bundle of egg, hash-brown, chopped peppers I think, I don't know, but it's delicious. The tortilla even tastes home made, it probably isn't, but it has that consistency. So far, we've been there 4 times, which is pretty sad considering we didn't try them until like the 2nd week of January. But, a killer breakfast burrito is just that. Once I even got the hubby the breakfast burrito and I got the Chile Relleno. Also good. Stoked to try more. The people are always really nice and accommodating, they always give sauce and thick napkins without asking. And inside, they have the pickled jalapenos, onions, relish etc, and more sauce choices, as well as better pictures than the drive thru. Seriously, I'm really glad this drive thru opened up so close.

I used to work at Nordstrom and I also work in the service industry as a bartender so I am a very easy going customer. My server (Raven I believe is his name, at least that's what my receipt said.

Fifteen minutes goes by and I still have no drink. I had to physically get up and ask the hostess to retrieve my drink that was just sitting at the service bar while my server wandered around aimlessly. I received my food and was not a fan of the 'Smoke and Heat' drink and wanted a margarita instead. It took him forever to come back and check on me so I had to ask to hostess AGAIN to go and grab him. He took my drink and I asked if they had any Reposado tequilas and he was unsure; asked the bartender. To make a long story short it took forever for him to actually tell the bartender to MAKE my drink (I overheard their exchange because my table was near the bar) and he finally comes over and tells me \\"your drink should be out soon\\" when my food was basically already done. I told him to cancel the drink and bring my check, which he swiped my card for and then dropped off on the table. He didn't apologize or even tell me to have a good day.

Kacey's doesn't have a huge variety, but you will get the choice of 4 or 5 meats and 8-1o sides. There is also a cold salad and a dessert bar. These could both use some work. The mediocre hot food could be excused more easily if they had a kick-butt salad bar and delicious homemade desserts (the \\"banana pudding\\" just looks scary, like an alien blob monster from a bad horror movie).

The salad was filling - had quinoa and pickled radishes in addition to the kale and pumpkin - price = $10.  I got a small ice tea, $2.00, and left happy.  It wasn't very quiet and the food was ready in just a few minutes.  The woman at the counter was nice and helpful.I would definitely come back for take out again.

I totally understand why most people are giving 5 stars; such a sweet couple that owns the spot, very communicative with you and asking for feedback and sharing their story with everyone. Love their passion!However, I do believe there are a few things that need work for me to give it the 5th star. Let's start with the things I Loved:\\nThe meatballs were great. I went with the Jeffy's Sausage with creamy provolone. Everything came out SUPER hot so we had to wait a while to indulge. The meatballs were flavorful and cooked perfectly. The Tuscan Farro Salad was huge and delicious. So fresh! Next time I may go with this and throw a meatball on it. Would make for a delicious, filling lunch. Few things that can improve: - No tap water - bottled water only\\n- Can/Bottled beverages only \\n- No ice\\n- Plastic serving plates\\n- The bread for the meatball smash is huge - I had to remove the top and just with one slice\\n- No background music in the front - such a small, quiet spot that it's awkward to have a conversation because everyone in there could hear everything since there was no sound drowning it out\\n- Ordered a side salad and wasn't informed my sandwich came with one automatically, would have been nice to know and or an option to upgrade to a different side salad. I was left with 2 salads as a side.

The ambiance was at first a bit jarring, as our subconscious had to acclimatize to a distracting, Indian-language CSI-type TV show blasting loudly in the background.  The artwork was simultaneously blas√© and disturbing, consisting mainly of poorly strewn Christmas lights and some sort of man-camel optical illusion (ÔøΩ?.  Once we settled in we noticed that the waitstaff, all Indian, seemed somewhat...annoyed?...that we were there.  This was consistent with the fact that at exactly 10 p.m. the staff abruptly shut off the TV and turned the lights up in the style of a dank inner-city nightclub.  Furthermore, upon careful inspection it became clear that everything, including the silverware, glasses, and even the table itself, was impeccably, impossibly clean.  This would normally be a good thing, but everything was so amazingly spotless that it suggested that we very well might have been the first customers ever to cross the threshold.  If so, what was the purpose of the buffet?  \\"Is this a mafia front?\\" we thought.  \\"What's going on here?\\"  Anyway, regardless of any inexperience that might result from never having waited on a single guest in their lives, the RP waitstaff were exceptionally professional.  One of them even reminded us of the hunchback assistant Igor from Young Frankenstein, who was, after all, one of the most loyal servants in all of modern cinema.We began with naan, which was apparently on the \\"secret menu,\\" thus requiring us to guess what types might be available.  Chat expertly divined \\"peshawary,\\" which arrived in a very, very clean, gilded basket...?  Its quality was not befitting of its conveyance, as it was a tad doughy.  Things improved dramatically from this point, however: the veggie pakora appetizer ($4) had impressively uniform fryitude, and while the matter was so fried as to leave essentially no veggie on the interior, it was nonetheless (or consequently?) quite good.  The papad ($3) was nicely salted, and was even spicy!  It was not quite crispy enough, but had a fantastic flavor.  As for the mains, the kashmiri goat Madras ($14) was excellent, sporting tender meat.  And the aloo gobhi ($11)...oh, the aloo gobhi...it was the spiciest ever!  So much so that Yogi was literally left speechless, and experienced such intense face and extremity vibration that it was not only unclear -- but irrelevant -- whether the food actually tasted like anything.  Rounding out the meal (and counteracting the spice!) were a nicely crystallized kulfi bengali ($3), and a mango lassi ($3) with the highest viscosity we have ever experienced, holding up an entire straw with only ~2 inches of its length submerged!In keeping with the arc of Young Frankenstein, despite an inauspicious beginning and an abrupt end, the overall experience at RP was outstanding, warranting a four-samosa rating at eminently reasonable two-rupee rates.  Next time you're at RP, make sure faithful Igor gives you a hefty dose of your meds.  While this may lead to a mood of stoic grimness (\\"The Gut-Wrenching Science Behind the World's Hottest Peppers,\\" Smithsonian Magazine, June 2013), it will ensure long life and vitality (Chopan & Littenburg 2017, PLoS One)!"},{"name":"Chung Ki Wa","address":"27 Riverside Ave","city":"Medford","stars":"3.5","text":"Last night was the third time I have been here.

The lady working the cash register had a bit of an attitude, but nothing extreme.

I just love their grilled Brussels sprouts and their sweet potato tots and the have a great Ah√≠ Tuna sandwich.

So what I do is take both their sauces mix in their horseradish and some ketchup and it makes it a lot better... LolI do recommend this place the customer service is always great and friendly and it's a cool place to eat especially if you are going to see a football game b/c it is located in Castleberry Hill down the street from the Dome or what is now gonna be the Mercedes Benz complex.

I have to tell you that I have tasted a lot of Peruvian and Ecuadorian Ceviches, but I have never before tasted one with Cumin in it. It only had one shrimp about 2 ounces of fish and a few rings of squid.

When I saw the sign for their James Beard Award in the restroom, I was sold. Despite the \\"hole in the wall\\" look and curb appeal as you walk up. The first dish we ordered was a staple of this restaurant: Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - Chicken wings in Fish Sauce and Palm sugar, deep fried, tossed in caramelized Phu Quoc Fish Sauce and Garlic\\nHoly crap-balls - this stuff was freaking amazing! I would've been happy if this is all that we ate. Perfect blend of heat and sweet. I think you get 8 of these wings and they make just about anything from Hooters or Buffalo Wild Wings seem like bad frozen food. Start and/or end with these and you can't go wrong. When we were done with the other food below, we ordered a second round. They are that good. Next we tried: Kung Op Wun Sen (prawns and pork belly with bean thread noodles). The pork belly on the bottom was the best part. We ended up eating this dish after it had cooled down so it was good, but not great. I'm sure that when this dish was still hot, it was delicious. So if you get it, eat it as soon as you get it. The Wings you will most certainly order will still be good when you finish this dish. Keep in mind this dish has prawns and they still have the shell on so you'll have to put in a little work to enjoy the whole meal. But they were big and meaty prawns so they were definitely worth the elbow grease to get the job done.The complete impulse buy was the grilled sweet corn on the cob with salty coconut cream. It was on the menu on the wall and sounded so awesome as I'm a huge corn fan. It was good - not great. I think the grilled nature of the corn, coupled with the salt and sweet of the coconut just really muddied the dish. A good dish but with so much going on with your palate, it was overwhelming.  I wouldn't try it again.Last dish was Yam Makheua Yao (eggplant salad ). My least favorite. It kind of just seemed like filler when compared to the other food. Definitely had the least complex flavor when compared to the other dishes. Not a bad dish, just paled in comparison to the others.The only thing I was disappointed with about this dish was our waitress. She was a little snotty and almost pretentious. The host/hostess at the front was great. And the other people milling around whom we would ask for drink refills or to take plates were also great. But our waitress, who was also a bartender, just seemed so crabby to us. Wasn't quite the attitude I was expecting after spending over $100 for a lunch!Also parking in the area is a crapshoot. They are doing construction on the street the restaurant is actually on so you'll have to park on a side street but many of these streets are blocked or otherwise unavailable because of the construction. Not their fault so I don't knock them for it - just something to be aware of as you get to the location. Seeing as how there was still a small line to get in at 2:00 in the afternoon, this is still a hot spot of a locale. \\nI knocked off a star for the waitress' attitude. Yes, it was that bad.

I came here for dinner and a little has changed here.  Prices are a tad bit higher at around $30 for dinner on Monday-Thursday as it used to be cheaper on the weekdays vs weekends.  On the hibachi grill, there are no longer scallops.  One thing I noticed, the crab legs are now served hot instead of on ice.  They probably got tired of people asking them to heat it up.  Lol haha \\nThey don't stack the crab legs as high as awhile back so you may need to wait for the crab legs to come out.  I do notice crab fish as I don't remember them having crawfish back in the days.  They also no longer have the grilled oysters on the shell on which I do miss. All in all about the same.  They need to drop prices back to $25-$26 for weekday dinner tho.  Service is definitely not what it used to be as I had to ask for crab crackers and it took my waitress awhile to get me a refill on water.  It appeared that she had too many tables and was too busy.

I felt like I was in harry potter's staircase bedroom. While sitting so close to strangers ur elbows could touch. Wish they would open up the place more since it feels so crowded and tight, but I guess it would be considered a nice vibe if you don't have a big party. Since I made that request, my server, whom was a male decides to give us attitude the whole time and taking super long to just give us waters. It's whatever though, it was probably busy and the guy had a long day. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. Small servings of food for a good sum of money. A little pricey for me but if the chef was American, they definitely hit home run on the delicious Thai flavors. My overall experience was good and would come again.

It was not that much food, and we ended up ordering the remaining item.  The \\"portion-control police officer\\" rudely agreed to place the order and said she would consider the chicken wings our dessert.  WOW (gross).  She also stated several times that we ordered a few spicy items, and kept asking if we are sure we want those.  We are 3 people that love & eat super spicy food regularly.  YES we want it to be spicy, thanks.  Needless to say, NOTHING was remotely spicy.  The whole dinner was passive aggressive comments such as above.

I go a lot for lunch because work is closeby and I have yet to go there and have them offer prompt service, especially when it comes time to bring the bill. We're usually left trying desperately to flag someone down. Most of us are there for a quick business lunch and they just take so long I have to put in extra time to make up for it. A couple of times they have been so significantly slow that we had to ask where our food was. Once, it took almost 45 minutes to get our food, and they weren't apologetic at all. The waitress just kept emphasizing that there was a large order in front of us so everything was slow. Well... maybe you should have told us that there might be a wait. Or, maybe you could have apologized. But 45 minutes is way too long and there was no acknowledgement at all that it was a disservice. Just a tactless \\"here's how it is\\".Another time, my colleague pre-ordered all of our lunches the morning of a lunch get-together, after a significant back and forth via email with the owner, and then when we arrived they completely had no record of our orders at all.

Although I don't often eat meat, the chicken shawarma is the highlight here. It's flavorful, full of spice, yet light and healthy at the same time. The vegetarian platter and foul (fava) are also very good. I also enjoy the cabbage salad that comes with the roll-ups - a nice crisp counterpoint to the meat that is a much better complement than lettuce. Next time I'll try the fried cauliflower wrap.

Those were signals that I went to a nice burger joint.Sunday evening, almost all seats were occupied, but it was not packed nor uncomfortable. The menu is very simple. They only have burgers (5 patties), toppings, fries, and beverages. Craving for a complete 60's experience, I went for the burger and fries entr√©e, two toppings, and malted chocolate covered cherry milkshake. Service speed was good. My shake came in about 5 minutes and my burger and fries in about 7 mins more. The milkshake serving was large; first filling the coned glass, but also giving a cup with equal or more serving than the glass! That was as if I had two milkshakes.I was pleased by the size of the serving. There was a generous serving of fries and the burger was, although not humongous or fancy, quite succulent looking. The fries were not salted (good!) and definitively fresh cut. Not greasy or weak, but to the point, which were very good. The burger itself indeed lived its expectations. Juicy and tender, as in the old days. Just a well made burger out from the grill, with a lingering smell that confirms it is a true old fashioned burger. Then came the bill. The burger and fried platter was around 10.5 CAD. Each topping was 1.35 CAD. The malted shake came to 6.95 CAD. The total was 19 CAD. Add HST and tip and had to cash out 25 CAD.Conclusion, the place is VERY good and worth visiting. Cons, it was not a cheap eat. It definitively hurt dishing out the 25 CADs for a burger dinner (still hurts haaa).  Although I might say it is the best burger I had until now in Vanc, it still not on par with some good joints in New York City (and for about half the price).

When the bill arrived, we were charged for both the late meal and the complimentary drink, as the waiter said he could not give that for free.

Other things I've tried here are the scones and the lemon bars, and while I could probably whip up superior baked goods at home, that would require a lot of work and these are definitely more than \\"passable.\\"  Tasty is a good word.I'm not usually picky about atmosphere, but since this is a coffee place and people go here to \\"work\\" (ostensibly), I'd say that the atmosphere here is good for that.  It's probably not a place you want to try to work at on a weekend, because they do serve alcohol and things get pretty chatty in there in the evenings.  It's not a huge place, but not tiny either--there's a decent amount of seating, tables for laptops, and even a couple couches if you choose.

I got that \\"we are here to keep our customers happy and coming back\\" vibe from our waitress. We told her that it was our first time their and she thoroughly explained the restaurant, the menu, and gave so many suggestions on what to try. we started with the crispy calamari and you are given complementary cornbread which was quite delicious, given the fact that I typically don't like cornbread. I tried the chicken fried steak with macaroni and my friend originally tried the meatloaf with red beans and rice and their soup of the day (creamy jalape√±o with bacon and shrimp). I absolutely loved the chicken fried steak, it was crunchy and flaky on the outside without being dry and the inside was perfectly tender. the creamy sauce they put on top of it had a little kick which I always love! The macaroni was decent, definitely not the best I've ever had but I tend to not focus too much on side dishes when I'm trying out new restaurants. our server came back to check on us and see how everything was going, and she could tell my friend didn't really care for the meatloaf and insisted on switching it out for something that she would like better, which was so kind. So my friend tried the chicken almondine dish which was delicious as well. overall, i'm giving it four stars because I can say that I have had a better meal at the same or less price point in a local restaurant before, but the service, ambience, and food altogether was such a nice experience that I definitely think it's worth checking out!

This is truly sad but it sounds like the management of this establishment has totally self-destructed.  http://data.tallahassee.com/restaurant-inspections/brevard/kloibers-cobbler-eatery/sea1503727/3374874/?next=/restaurant-inspections/brevard/Kloibler's has been a Titusville staple for many years and I've really enjoyed the food and the value as well as the historic building.  Regrettably, this place seems like an establishment you would see on Kitchen Nightmares.  It's kind of a disaster.There are a few issues with this establishment that are getting worse every day... the seating, other than one round-top table, is old and terribly uncomfortable; the stool cushions are nasty; like something you'd find in a dive bar.  There have been some upgrades to decor like pictures and wall art, which is welcomed, but there are easy-fix cosmetic issues nearly everywhere that need addressed.  Worst of all, the men's restroom is really, really bad...and it's been that way for many years, and without any apparent repairs, is getting worse.  Small things too; the broken urinal that has been in there for 10+ (20+?) years... the faucet which is old and leaky and is missing the screen that one of the pot-heads probably took out 25 years ago to use in their pipe... still hasn't been repaired.  The constant piss smell of the restroom which is somewhat rafter-connected to the next door kitchen.  Look, I realize all of these things, even the small ones, take money but many of these issues are decades old and are small fixes.    Another annoyance is the rear entrance (where all the parking is so where most people come in) takes you right through a smoking area that is nearly always occupied by a smoking employee of some kind.  I don't want to take away the right/ability of the workers to have a smoke-break; I just question why I have to walk through it with my family every time I want to come in the restaurant.All of the above items I have been sidelining for many years because of their pretty good food.  The servers are usually very friendly too even if the other employees seem to be indifferent to my presence (never has anyone said \\"hello\\" when I walked in other than a server).  Unfortunately,  a few weeks ago management raised the prices of their usual specials. And not just a small increase; we're talking a fairly large increase in prices... this would be actually okay with me if the food wasn't getting worse tasting and in quality.  There is a huge drop in the past year of quality at this place both in food and in overall cleanliness of the establishment.  To top that off, the food prices have gone up without us the customer seeing any improvement or upgrades being done to the poor conditions of this restaurant.  I seriously hope that someone who works there takes this review as constructive and makes some changes.  Is there a money management issue with the owners?  I don't know but something desperately needs to be done to save and re-invent this classic Titusville establishment."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Amazing huge book store in Portland!

One of our party held a wet-wipe over her nose to keep from gagging. (A bit dramatic, but it made the point: that table should be OUT OF BOUNDS. We kept looking at other happy diners, enjoying dappled sunlight and fresh air. Lucky bastards.)We ordered the game hen and ribs, and were expecting--for $9 and $15, respectively--big dishes heaped with succulent morsels of roasted hen and pork and fresh, colorful vegetables, presented with artful Thai garnishes. LIKE I HAD IN THAILAND. What we got instead was Bits of Meat Thrown onto a Plate (sticky rice sold separately, for $2 per scoop).Our final bill came to $32, not including tip for slowish-but-not-unfriendly service.

So I feel like the pricing is a rip off, considering the fact that the salon is not in a posh area. Please note, I wasn't expecting to pay $30 or something cheap. However, the $100 charge took me by surprise.Also, if you do go to studio 27, I would only recommend Blessing to do your hair. Another lady started doing my hair, I had to stop her because she wasn't careful and my hair started breaking.

I have waited over 20 minutes for them to make 3 tacos, when I actually ordered 6, and even those 3 were wrong. I have never seen more than one other customer there at the same time as me, and still have never managed to get a to-go taco in less than 10 minutes. I decided I was done after they couldn't even bother to fully wrap up a to-go taco with refried black beans, they just threw the oozing taco into a bag with my other taco and it was a huge mess I didn't even want to deal with.

Apparently, you can only get happy hour bargains (which looked very promising) in the bar section of the restaurant. Well. I guess that's good to know. It'd be helpful if this info was on their website, yaknowhatimsaying? The sushi was sort of lifeless and just OK, I've definitely had better. I ordered the spicy shrimp roll which was decent enough but then made the mistake of ordering the salmon skin roll. Holy shite. I've never tasted a saltier piece of salmon in my life. Yeah, I get that it's the skin of a salmon but the taste of salt was so overwhelming I had no desire to finish. And let me tell you- I fucking love salt. But there was no other flavor than salt. Our waiter was also kind of bumbling and seemed like he had been working there for a week. I ordered a miso soup and got my sushi before the waiter even realized I hadn't gotten it yet. I politely told him to cancel the miso since, uh, I had clearly gotten my main course. Since we were celebrating a birthday we asked what kind of desserts they had, expecting the typical Japanese fair- mochi balls, fried green tea ice cream, etc. The waiter replied, \\"we have crepes.\\" What in the fuck.

Everything I ask a local BBQ lover about this place, it's usually the following reaction:  A half smile + head shake communicating respect that conquered initial disbelief - kind of like when you like a popular song/band on the radio but have trouble admitting it because you're 'indie'.  (note:  this is a slight variation on the smile/head shake combo that communicates respect and/or pride for an action you don't necessarily condone - like if you had a 14 year old son who boned his hot teacher)  ....followed by....\\"I gotta admit...Rudy's is pretty damn good.....consistent....brisket....creamed corn....\\"    A couple of 'deadly sin'-inspired notes before I go into a review of what I've tried: 1) Gluttony - They don't have the all-you-can-eat option that you can get at Salt Lick and County Line.  But you'd be hard-pressed to eat $20 worth of stuff here and not be stuffed.2) Envy - The meat isn't quite as good as places like Franklin's and Kreuz but is very consistent. 3) Wrath - Rudy's sauce reflects the service you'd expect at a store connected to a gas station - more vinegary than sweet.  It's grown on me in subsequent visits but definitely not for everyone.  (Luckily the meat is good enough that the sauce is unnecessary)4) Sloth - They don't do sandwiches per se.  You have to order by weight (1/4 pound good for a sandwich) and they give you white bread on the side.  While I like white bread when I get a platter, it's a little too doughy and chewy for a good BBQ sandwich.  Anyway, here's what I've had so far:Moist brisket - Nice balance of meat and fat (sometimes moist brisket can be too fatty).  Good flavor both in the bark and the meat.  Great texture.  Beats any brisket I've had in Austin short of when Franklin's is having a good day.  St. Louis Pork Ribs - Really like these.  A lot of meat on the bone.  The rub is strong on salt and pepper with a nice hint of heat (cayenne?). Original Sausage - Not bad but pretty forgettable.  If there was a plate in front of me with their brisket and sausage, I wouldn't even look in the sausage's direction. Cole Slaw - Solid.  Cut really fine.Creamed Corn - Delicious.Banana Pudding - Great.

We came here for dinner around 7:30 Saturday night and did not have to wait for a table. The place was pretty crowded, but the restaurant was massive so it had plenty of seating.The buffet options were quite overwhelming. I first tried a bunch of rolls (maybe 5-7 different rolls, one piece each), salmon sashimi and buckwheat soba noodles. I also tried the veggie and shrimp tempura, seaweed salad, hamachi nigiri, unagi nirigi, mussel nigiri, masago nigiri, spicy tuna nigiri and plenty more salmon sashimi.My advice is to skip a lot of the rolls, unless there is one you really love. The selection is awesome (much bigger than anything I have ever seen) but none of the rolls that I chose stood out to me and I thought at least one would. The problem is you do not get the same kind of freshness that you would if you had ordered off the menu. I think the winners were the nigiri and sashimi. I really liked everything else too, especially the soba noodles. They have a dessert bar as well that I was too full to pick from, but I did save enough room for the green tea soft serve. I know there were some complaints about it being too powdery, but I loved it and thought it was a nice refreshing finish to the meal -- not too sweet.Now that I know what I like, I can really zero in on the goodies.

Dinner wasn't impressive; brunch was something else entirely.  The star of the dinner menu is the corndog shrimp, a creation that was never meant to be - four overcooked, rubbery shrimp inside a cornbread batter not quite as thick as the batter on a corndog.

There was no salt and pepper or ketchup on the table- this is frustrating when your waitress is busy with other customers through out the night. Anyways, I took one bite out of the steak and couldn't eat it. It was cooked the right way but it tasted SO bad that I believe it was old. I had my fianc√© try it and he agreed. (I've never had a steak that I couldn't eat cause it tasted bad?) I told my waitress and she offered to bring me out a chicken breast- I said yes and she comes out 20 minutes later (my fianc√© is done eating by now) and gives me cut up chicken like you would find in a salad. The steak was not removed from the bill (I didn't even bring the steak home or anything of course even though she offered) and then she tried to compensate with a free cookie (i got it to go and I find out it was BURNT!) but my waitress was very nice, she was just doing what she was told and my drink was great, but we will not be back due to lack of menu and failure to make the bill right- that's just bad business!"},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Came here for brunch with a friend and was absolutely delighted.

With all the slobs that frequent buffets keeping them clean is a challenge - the folks at Nori Nori do it well and are quick to clean up when some mouth breather puts the wrong tongs back on the wrong plate - they don't allow cross contamination to become an issue.Overall the service is pretty good - young service staff who weren't as quick but were affable and professional.

Only downside was that the temperatures were sky high and the restaurant did not have air conditioning. We were all sweaty when we left.  Otherwise the food was fantastic. The menu was extensive and there were several alternatives to traditional breakfast items that I look forward to trying. One of my all time favorite breakfast items are lemon ricotta pancakes (I first had them when I was a server at the Four Seasons in Seattle) and was thrilled when I saw them on the Cafe Luna menu. These lived up to my high expectations. So light and moist compared to a traditional pancake. We also got a few orders of honey biscuits. Sweet and delicious .. wish I could have had a few more!

As far as the ramen goes, it's a little overpriced for what it is but it does taste relatively authentic for a chain restaurant. The pot stickers and Takoyaki are pretty delicious too, also ordered to go. I've never actually dined here..... I don't think I want to dine here as the mere interaction with the staff while getting things for pick up is enough. Saying they're incompetent is probably being little too generous. Wait staff standing around with blank looks on their faces as people at the front wait to be helped or at least acknowledged. No, these not people who have been greeted and are waiting for a table, they just got there and have to call out to the staff who are not helping them even though they're not doing anything else. If the waitresses are not spacing off, they're busy talking to each other. This has been my experience on numerous occasions but I live nearby and the Onigiri is usually delicious, or at least they used to be. The last couple of times I've ordered them they had been made with hot rice which wilts the seaweed on the outside immediately and just doesn't taste right with tuna salad inside. The rice should be room temperature and as a Japanese restaurant which claims to be authentic this shouldn't be a mistake they make repeatedly. They've also stopped putting the pickled radishes in with the to go, although when I asked next time I called in, they insisted they still serve those with the Onigiri. It's unfortunate that a restaurant in a new development with so much potential leaves so much to be desired. My complaints are something that can be easily remedied. If the staff were only trained properly. I don't know how busy they are anymore but they were definitely packed during peak hours when they first opened. The area is so highly populated that I imagine they still get good business. This, however, should not be reason to allow the mediocrity to continue. I don't know that they will lose enough business to care but they've definitely lost mine and some of my neighbors. Come on corporate, train your people better or higher better staff for a place that is obviously busy enough to want to work there."},{"name":"Firehouse Tavern","address":"38 S Vernon St","city":"Sunbury","stars":"4","text":"Best burgers around!

It's a simple place in the heart of the Pearl District with outside seating on nice weather days.  You could feel the love in the atmosphere and taste it in the food - I spent a month in Italy when I was 21 and eating here transported me back to that time from the Italian shows blasting over the TV to the authentic food and wine and the Italian family who runs this delightful establishment.  My favorite meal here was the Insalata Mista followed by Spaghetti Mare e Monti paired with a nice glass of Sangiovese or Barbera.  Both the Penne al Pesto and Lasagna were favorites - very well prepared versions of these classic Italian dishes.  There was always a line, and from reading through more recent reviews it seems that is still the case, so don't go hungry because you will most likely have to wait for a table.

Let's ignore the part where I still can't swallow them whole but (prefer) to chew them lightly, or that I hate their actual taste and must eat them with lemon juice/seafood sauce/mignonette so they all kind of end up tasting the same to me. I blame Yelp Elite events with free oysters for fueling this obsession.Anyway, Island Creek Oyster Bar may be the best upscale seafood place I've yet encountered to meet my oyster/seafood needs. I tried the Chatham and PEI oysters and they were fresh, plump and all-around delicious. The master oyster shucker Paul even gave me a free Island Creek oyster because he felt I needed to try it.At $10, the mussels in lemongrass broth with celery and chili pepper are an incredible deal. The broth was lick-the-bowl delicious and the mussels were so fresh, plump and tender. Bonus: They de-shell them all for you so no manual labor, no splattering broth over your favorite top as you try to pick the little things out of their shells (not that that happened to me or anything, but...uh...on a totally unrelated note, anyone know how to get garlic broth stains out of a gray top?). For entrees, I got the Lobster Roe Noodles and it is everything the hype says it is. Delicious, home-pressed orange lobster noodles with incredibly tender short rib pieces and a perfect piece of grilled lobster tail, accompanied by peas and mushrooms in the most decadent, satisfying sauce. It doesn't look like a lot when it's served but I guarantee it will fill you up. For $27, I've paid far more for far worse dishes.Drinks, drinks, drinks. The sparkling muscat is an excellent accompaniment to pretty much any oyster selection you make. I had the High Pines because I am a cocktail fiend and it was refreshing, grapefruit-y goodness. The woman sitting next to us told us about their rose flights, so Alyson G and I have plans to come back to try that. Seriously, rose flight? Sold!Service was stellar--attentive and friendly.

In fact we probably could have easily fed a fourth of similar appetite and had left satiated but not stuffed.CORN BREAD WAFFLE & CHICKEN $9.99\\nOur savory corn bread waffle with crispy fried chicken. add a side of sausage gravy for $1.49.NUTELLA GARDEN $9.99\\nNutella, creamy peanut butter, caramelized bananas, and strawberries between 2 pancakes, topped with whipped cream.BBQ BRISKET BREAKFAST $10.99\\nIn-house brisket mixed with BBQ sauce and melted cheddar atop texas toast topped with 2 eggs and home fries.The boneless fried chicken pieces were pretty big, and nice and crispy.  The waffle didn't taste much like corn bread, but had the slight corny grit evident of cornmeal.  The pancakes were rich with creamy spreads and fruit chunks.  The brisket, though not plentiful, was well sauced and tender.  The home fries a mix of crispy and tender sliced potatoes generously seasoned with rosemary.  The sweet potato fries nice and crisp.  I'd order everything again, hopefully all at once with friends who like to share.Service was friendly, and after 2:30pm when most the restaurant was emptied, they welcomed a rather large party and pushed a few tables together, even though they've posted a sign on their door that they do not seat parties larger than 4.The restaurant consists of 6 diner type, attached to the floor type, stools at a counter, 5 tables for 4, 5 tables for 2, and 1 mystery table that I couldn't quite see from my seat at the innermost booth.  Be careful when stepping into the larger dining room on the further side of the room - there's a step down that I wasn't initially aware of but was verbally warned about.The bathroom was a rather large private one with a hook on the door.I enjoyed their version of home fries even though it isn't the normal sort which I prefer made extra crispy.

I don't give easy 5 stars! (But I don't give easy 1 star either)So I was tipped by other yelper about this joint, and figured \\"why not?\\"As I walk in I already had a good feeling that this joint won't be a miss...It's just like Japan!  This is great interpretation of the modern izakaya in Japan.  I like the little details from the decorations to the aprons that's employees were wearing.  I wonder if the owner is copying the Shinsengumi of LA about the taiko though...(Shinsengumi is a popular yakitori joint in LA and they have the same EXACT concept with the taiko as a greeting method)I brought my other Japanese friend and we were both pleasantly surprised with presentation of the restaurant.20oz beer?! Hell yeah, these guys know the nature of Japan's beer drinking!  Free flowing baby...I came in here on a mission, to try many dishes as possible.\\nSo we ordered:\\n3 Yakitori items\\nAssorted Kushikatsu plate\\nGrilled saba\\nOkonomiyaki. andSunomonoService is great.  I think this lady was new but she as very sincere.  She was attentive and most importantly, honest with customer care.Yakitori is hands down the best I've had in PDX.  Tender, juicy, and very flavorful.  Grilled just right.  This is 5 stars.  But I would not order the ume shiso chicken again...a little dry.Kushikatsu was good!  I was happy to see the quail egg and mozzarella cheese...This is called \\"B grade gourmet\\" and is considered more of \\"soul food\\" for many Japanese people.  Non- Japanese would not understand what I am talking about, thus you see some complaints on here.  It is a izakaya staple in Japan.  The sauce could have had little more tang but it was good.  ( I think they were using otafuku since there were banners everywhere...I prefer Bulldog sauce. It's all personal preference!)\\n \\nSaba was good.  But it's kind of hard to screw up the saba since this fish is so flavorful by itself.  It was grilled just right.  I wish it had a little more grated daikon though.Okonomiyaki...Ok here is one disappointment.  \\nI heard these guys were from Kyu-shu(southern Japan) and I am from western Japan, the birthplace of the okonomiyaki.  It was much left to be desired.  The crust was too thin and the filling was not flavorful.  I am also not a fan of mixing the mayo and the sauce!(Lol, this is such a hot topic in Japan where to use straight sauce vs with mayo.)  I guess I am happy to be discussing in this high level since nobody in this town besides Yuzu that serves Japansese food as close as it gets to my home.  So I guess this can be taken as a compliment though.Sunomono, another disappointment.  There was no sour element at all.  I dunno if they forgot to add the vinegar.  It had no flavor.  It was way too mild.  Presentation was wonderful though.  It was just like how it would be served in these type of izakaya in Japan.On the last dish, we ordered the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen.\\nRamen has been pretty sensitive topic for me lately since Biwa pissed me off so much, but I knew that it would not be bad at all considering the food we've just had.The presentation was great.  Simple, just like how it should be.  It had Char-shu, green onion, and kikurage.  I add 1 extra points for this!  I have not had a kikurage in a long time and it was a pleasure.(Dried mushroom)  We both liked it since the flavor was VERY Japanese.  The soup is VERY rich in American standard.  To give you an idea, there is a layer of oil on top of the bowl that prevents the steam to come out.  This actually is very popular in Japan and many ramen places have these type of soup.  This keeps the whole bowl hot.Aroma was dead on.  This is what you call \\"Tonkotsu\\" ramen.(Kyu-shu is very famous for their Tonkotsu, go figure!)  Rich and fatty!  Soup was on a salty side but it was good.  This is comparable to Yuzu, and it might have an edge for more authenticity.The noodles were a little slippery, which was a little disappointing but you gotta make the bowl presentable to all crowds.  If you think in this perspective it makes sense.  They are made in house and it was good noodles.  I just felt that it did not match the rich soup that they had.  And can we please get white pepper next time, pretty please...?All these and we came out as 60$ tab for both of us!  I'm a fan now.  In general we were pretty darn happy to get this high level of Japanese food this side of town.  We had to go to all the way Yuzu when we wanted to eat at a decent izakaya...now we found a SOLID joint.  4.5 stars!  Thanks to some of the yelpers pointing me out to this joint!

Ironically enough I sat  in the bar area and the bartendress (did I just make that up?) thought the hostess was with me. I guess they're boosting the staff for the holidays. You know you're in a nice restaurant when they do the little things differently. For instance, when you order a drink, typically you get a plastic drink stirrer right?? Well here you get a nice metal one. Gotta tell ya, as I'm a chronic drink stirrer, this was a nice surprise. Simple and functional.

Risotto was not anything memorable, and mac and cheese was below par for a restaurant of this caliber. Wild mushroom was little too salty for my taste. I also had their succulent perfectly cooked scallop. The quality of ingredients is top notched, the steak was perfectly aged and tender.

The entrees here are good, but in my opinion, the appetizers are the real stars of the show. I typically get two or three appetizers and then share a pizza. My must-get appetizer here is the Edamame Dumplings. I highly highly highly highly HIGHLY recommend it. Another appetizer we like to get is the chips and guac. True Food makes its chips in-house and provides a spin on something that's usually served very plainly. As for pizza, I've had their Brussel Sprout & Wild Mushroom one and House-made Chicken Sausage. Both of them are good - we usually just ask for half & half on one pizza. Very few instances where you can eat pizza and not feel bad about yourself.

I've been back and forth with this place over the last 5 years. The thing that would always get me in the door was their breakfast sandwiches, which are both the best and cheapest in town. But due to the arrogant owner, and his terrible, over sweetened and over creamed coffee, I am done!Over the years I've been somewhat of a regular and have tried a good amount of their offerings. Mostly for feeling guilted into doing so. If you take the bait and go in ONLY for one of their awesome breakfast sandwiches at what seems to be a too-good-to-be-true price, you'll undoubtedly be asked, \\"what ELSE can I get for you???\\" (in a tone that eerily suggests that there should be an \\"else\\"). I'm a sucker, and I always knew I was getting a great deal on the sandwich, so I would usually take a baked good to go... They sell lots of homemade baked goods, muffins, cake slices, cookies, etc. All of which are very good... However, I get the feeling what he's really trying to sell is his coffee. Which is TERRIBLE. If you want a regular coffee with cream and sugar, ask him to go easy on both. If you don't, your coffee will be nearly undrinkable. But back to my point about the arrogance of that guy, if you dare ask him to take it easy on the cream and sugar, be prepared for some passive aggressiveness, and a coffee that has almost NO cream and NO sugar in it. It's all or nothing with this guy. If you're not familiar with this place, you cannot fix your coffee yourself. They don't put out cream or sugar for their customers, they fix it for you. You cannot win. Over the years I've witnessed plenty of \\"awkward\\" moments between other customers and the owner. Which, at first, always caught me by surprise, because for the most part the guy is pretty pleasant, always thanking you for coming in, saying good morning when you do... but make a claim that they got your order wrong or ask him to go easy on the sugar and YOU'RE the a__hole.This guy is the soup nazi of coffee shops... He IS the coffee nazi! So why did I finally decide to call it quits, you ask? This past weekend I stopped at  What's Brewin and arrived at 8:03am. I had a long list of errands that morning and needed to get started asap. The shop says it opens at 8:00am. When I went to open the front door at 3 minutes past, it was locked. The owner and his cashier were both standing behind the counter, leaning against it, and engaged in what appeared to be a very light conversation. They both turned, looked right at me, and immediately turned around and pretended not to have seen me. Normally this wouldn't be an issue and I would just simply wait. But on this particular day, the temperature outside was hovering around 15 degrees F. My extremities were numb from the cold, it's AFTER the time they claim to be open, they're standing right there... walk around the counter and open the the door for me! Even if the conversation you're having is private, acknowledge the fact that I'm standing there in the cold and that you're at least in the process of letting me in. I stood there for another 5 minutes, visibly freeing my a__ off, while they occasionally glanced my way while continuing to ignore me.There was also a day a few years back when I stopped in with a friend to get some breakfast sandwiches. We had been walking around town for a while and had stopped much earlier to get coffee at Dunkin Donuts. I wasn't thinking and was holding my empty coffee cup when we walked in. When the owner saw the empty cup from Dunkin Donuts in my hand, the whole place came to a screeching halt! He yelled at us to \\"get out!\\" ...and \\"read the SIGN!\\"... which we had missed on the way in. Oh yes, there is a SIGN, that says you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside into the shop.Get over yourself, coffee nazi. Or don't.

The hen dish was also quite good, but the portion was SUPER SMALL. \\nThe thai noodle dish was filled with unskinned chicken which was of dubious quality and some cheap egg noodles. It was topped off with canned fried crispy noodles. The actual components of the dish were very lacking, but the flavor of the curry it was in was good.Pok Pok delivers in flavor, but is WAY overpriced (dishes don't even come with rice and you need to pay $3 for a quarter cup of rice), and gives way too small portions.It is too busy and the atmosphere is loud and rushed.Go here once if you want to see why this place is overrated.

However my friends and I all agree that Pok Pok unfortunately was underwhelming.We ordered a variety of dishes.-Chicken wings: Surprisingly not that good.  I thought the wings would be the best thing since sliced bread, but the wings were underwhelming . The sauce was good, flavor was good.  The only problem was it was not great... also, not that spicy either!  The wings are a bit sweet so if you're not a fan of sweet wings, I would skip this one.  Also, if you don't like messy food, skip this one as well.-Wild boar: Decent.  It tasted a lot like pork to me so don't be scared to try new types of meats!-Pork belly curry: The dish kind of reminded me of a Chinese dish you can get that looks similar, some pork belly dish with a dark sauce.  I thought the sauce lacked a lot of zing...-Corn on the cob with salted coconut cream: probably my favorite dish (which is kind of sad).  I think it's a bit expensive at $4.50/ear but this is something new that I have never seen at restaurants before.-Duck leg: decent but the portion is really small  The sauce is good and probably the most vital part of the dish.-Water (on the table): someone had mentioned that they put pandan leaves in the water and it makes it taste like basmati rice.  I agree.  It is a little weird at first but I got used to it as the night went on.-Coconut rice: This was my first time eating coconut rice with my entrees.  It is pretty good, but at $3/bowl, you could be spending a lot on just rice alone.The all star of the night was actually our waiter.  We had dirty dishes not once, but TWICE (disgusting bits of food left on the plates), and both times he just knew what happened and came right over and exchanged the plates without us having to say anything.

First I always start off with a hard lemonade. They give you popcorn with paprika on it to munch on while you wait for your food and once your food comes they give you tasty jalape√±o cornbread muffins along with it.The cornflake fried chicken salad is my favorite! I am not one who usually orders a salad for dinner but this is more than a salad, I crave it! It comes with 3 big hot pieces of fried chicken on top that are so moist and delicious! I switch the dressing and get the chipotle lime ranch and it's amazing! I also have added pickled onions.The chicken and waffles is fabulous as well.

The sandwich choices from yelper posts was enticing and definitely intrigued me. However, once I sat down, I realized the restaurant was more of a $$-$$$ pricing. They offered a very simple menu with an assortment of entrees that was just the meat for a range of $25-$35 and then sides were separately priced at $9. Since I was coming in from out of town, I ordered a nice glass of wine, the skirt steak and a side of their stuffed mushrooms.The skirt steak (my favorite cut) was cooked to perfection and rested on a nice gravy. The mushrooms were stuffed with a nice cheese blend and was also extremely flavorful. The steak was a bit salty for my taste but nonetheless very delicious. The mushrooms were juicy and well seasoned.Before my meal came out, I was served some bread and butter. However, this bread came out in a mini dutch oven where the bread came spilling out of the corners of the container. Clearly, the restaurant is baking their pre-dinner bread to their guests in individual dutch ovens. The bread came out extremely hot and delicious. It had a very buttery taste with a hint of salt. It was a dense bread and in hindsight, I would not have eaten so much of it. I finished my steak and took most of my mushrooms home for left overs.

Good fancy restaurant.  Rather expensive.I came here for a special work dinner.  We each had a drink, a starter, main, shared side, and desert.  It was around $85 a person.  (We got the side free  from our foursquare check in).I had the beet salad.  It was one of the better beet salads I've had, yet it needed some more citrus zing that I found it lacked.  I had a dish with lobster and fresh pasta.  Good flavor, but a meager amount of lobster and a lot of pasta as a filler.  The shared side was ratatouille.  I've made better myself.  For desert we ordered two souffles - a Grand Marnier and a chocolate.  Both were to die for and the BEST part of the meal.  We had coffee as well.  They serve Illy coffee - nothing special.Attendance was good for a Tuesday night and the food was good overall.

Slick, stylish and contemporary environment, a centerpiece bar, with but two screens makes for an acceptable bistro, but not much if your looking for a steak and a beer while catching a few innings. Goodness knows Wayland and the surrounding communities need a good, well situated eating establishments, and I had high hopes for this one, living walking distance from it, but this one disappoints. The gluten free peperoni flat bread I ordered was cold as ice, the dough crusty and stale, like dried out cardboard. I have had similar gluten free pizza at Bertucci's where they use a cauliflower dough, and would recommend the same to these folks. I can't say whether it was the prep, or the gluten free dough they're using, but regardless it was inedible. The kind enough server, asked if I was taking the pie home as it sat untouched, and I declined without the heart to tell her how bad it was. My wife opted for grilled cheese and tomato soup, a safe bet on a thirty-degree day, but the soup too was cold, the grilled cheese a mess of dried out bread, stuffed with a nasty cheese mix that would have been made better if simpler. Anyone ordering soup and sandwich would be content with a pedestrian cheddar, or Munster perhaps, but the infused concoction used was over the top and just tasted awful. My Mom ordered another simple plate, fish and chips, which was served in a wire basket, lined with paper. I would dispense with the paper, as all it did was collect and display unappealing grease, paper towels would have been more absorbent and less conspicuous than wax paper I think, that is if you accept the premise that grease is acceptable in the first place. The fish itself was fine, warm at least if spartan, while the fries were again consistently cold. The table beside hosted six middle age woman out for a cocktail, lunch and some quality gal time, which the 110 seems best suited for. If your content with Applebee's with a better bar, this place works, if your hungry or eat out regularly, your money and time could be better spent. -P in Natick"},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Phenomenal legendary HUGE landmark bookstore in downtown Portland which is a must read!!

It is especially convenient considering I usually barely have time to consume my lunch, let alone go out to get it.  What impresses me most about this ABP is that they are always trying to do it better.  The instituted I-Pad ordering in the sandwich line to see if that made things more efficient.  You always see them having management meetings to see how they can make things improve, and occasionally they have changed the store lay-out to make things move a bit faster.  Their coffee isn't super-strong but I like it and think it is above Dunks and Finagle coffee so that is my go to for coffee when the sbux line is too long.  They also have a great selection of healthy lean, organic meat and veggies so you can be sure to have a lean and healthy breakfast or lunch.  I love the little low-cal snacks that they have packaged.  It is great to grab one of those instead of buying processed food for your snack.

Their portions are certainly generous and my shrimp dumplings were pretty good while the pork shumai were also fine but could have been better and the turnip cake--a really huge portion of that--was a little too greasy perhaps but also alright.I would come back for dim sum: it's far from the best I've had and I do prefer the cart system many places use over the list system of ordering here, however, the restaurant itself is small and carts would be cumbersome here so I understand why they use the little lists instead. They also have laminated sheets with photos of the items in case you are not familiar with everything on the list, and everything on the list is listed in both Chinese and English so I don't understand the complaints some people have about any language barrier or not understanding exactly what they're getting here.

Each bottle is 8 oz, and it is suggested 1 bottle per person.\\n2- Pick your \\"add ins\\" (I opted for hazelnuts, chopped apple, goat cheese, mushrooms)\\n3- Pick any \\"toppings\\", to adorn the top of your pancake and complete the flavor experience.\\nGiven the fact I was already bought in to my impending slappy-coma, I ordered the Creme Fresh as a topping.Each bottle runs about $6, toppings are $1-3 each, as are mix-ins. A tart strawberry syrup and regular syrup are already at the table, no charge.---Now, for functionality:  5 out of 10\\nThe griddle is not so large, when sat with a table of 5 guests total. Realistically, each person has room for like, 1 pancake at a time. Only 3/5 of ours were doing the pancake cooking and the griddle still felt cramped, also considering that most of the cooking is above the heating element, in the middle of the griddle.TIPS: ***Start an \\"assembly line\\" to your mouth (That's what she said): Put one pancake on the outlaying area of the griddle, mix ins, etc- so you can have this one slowly cooking, while cooking your central-location pancake in about half the time. By the time you are done eating your middle-o-griddle pancake you are then ready to eat the one cooking on the cooler part of the griddle. ***Another tip: Any party larger than 5, I would say, break the group up, and have 5 sat as their own party. I would hate for it to take 3 hours for a group of 7 people to eat their food because they are able to cook a pancake once every 15 minutes. ***GET THERE EARLY- I arrived at  9am on Sunday, 1 hour after open. The wait was already 1 hr +. Our table was by the hostess booth, and by 9:45, the wait for a party of 4, was between 1:45-2 hours. ***The Candied bacon is worth trying. Not saying it's something I would seek out again, but certainly yummy savory lovings, and worth trying while in the moment. Carpe that diem!OVERALL: I would go back, for sure. Not on my own accord, given the location across town for me, the wait, and how in the time it takes me to drive there, finally be sat, cook my food and then get back home, I could have bribed my husband to clean the dishes for me and taken a nap, allowing the same feeling as if I went to slappy cakes.

But I don't know, it just didn't work me over like I thought it would.  The chipotle pastrami was good, but not great.  I'm not just saying this to be a snob, it just didn't taste like a $12 sandwich.  And maybe that's what bugged me the most.  There was a decent amount of meat and toppings, but not for that price.  Fries were an extra couple of bucks mind you.  Not only that, but man, their hours suck.  If you live or work in Boston on M-F, you can have this any time.  But if you're outside of Boston and can't get there until after 4pm?  Well, you're screwed.I enjoyed my sandwich and I'm glad I went.  All in all though, I wouldn't go out of my way to return.

Why Pok Pok?!!??!!A quick sidenote that the Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings were not as perfect as I expected them to be.  They had good crisp and texture but the fish sauce flavor had a difficult time coming forward, so they just tasted like a fine spicy teriyaki wing.  Nothing wrong with that, but you feel like an opportunity was lost with the fish sauce.  Interesting that they serve the wings whole, with tips too.  Could have been easier to deal with had they cut the wings and thrown the tips away, but leaving them on does replicate a street-food like atmosphere.Now the lamb noodle soup is the opposite story.  From the first bite it is unmistakable what is really featured here: Lamb.  The broth and noodles work so excellently to enhance the rich lamb flavor.  Definitely not to miss if you like lamb.  I found that there is a new way to eat it.Now, I have not been to Thailand and had the real stuff, but if someone told me these dishes were flown here overnight, I'd believe it.  Giant crisp in-shell prawns served with an amazing thai chili sauce.  It's not the prawns, it's the sauce!

He gave good service throughout, no complaints there. Among the five of us, we had two salads, three pizzas and two pastas. The margherita was alright, but very Pizza Hut-esque, oddly.  It almost tasted like a frozen pizza with a bit of fresh mozz added on top.  The brie and pear pizza was alright, but I expected more out of it, it was kind of flat.  The two pastas were \\"delicious\\", said my friends, and the salads were average.So everything was peachy, nothing extraordinary.

Clearly, we did not belong at their bar. =)  We tried not to draw any extra attention to ourselves (not like we're a crazy bunch to begin with), but our zen was challenged when.... .. at 6 pm on a Wednesday... the live entertainment started.  A guy at a keyboard and a brazen, dolled-up middle aged lady took the 'stage' and started playing really awesomely bad covers of mediocre 90s love songs.  We felt like we were in Twin Peaks. It was too loud and with only 3-4 tables in the restaurant, intensely awkward. There was no ignoring them. And after their first set, they started going around and smoozing with the tables.  I hesitate to judge for a variety of reasons, I mean, god bless the effort, but it was enough to make me hesitate to return,  or at least call first to ask about 'entertainment' for the evening. I feel bad even mentioning it, they seemed so nice and well intentioned, but I thought it was worth warning anyone looking to go on a date night, or, goodness, a first date.  Mood killer, most definitely.  I guess the horror of it could be a bonding experience though, or a test to see if you have the same sense of humor..."},{"name":"Burger King","address":"Vancouver International Airport, 3211 Grant McConachie Way Richmond","city":"Richmond","stars":"2.5","text":"Le seul inconv√©nient pas assez de place pour pouvoir accueillir tout le monde\\nUne file d'attente √† l'am√©ricaine o√π l'on tourne en rond.

Granted it was a bit of a the drive for us being in the universal area, I heard good things about this restaurant and wanted to try it myself. This is not a full service location picky I am you think it would be. It's been a bit since we've been there but I promise the owner who I spoke with that I would do a yelp review. One of my favorite dishes is chicken parmesan and of course the next week after we visit they introduce that to the menu. I have to go back to try this! The main dish that I got with meatballs smash or I.e. meatball sub. The meatballs and bread were perfection. However I do have a bit of a gripe about the cheese. If I'm not mistaken they made the sandwich with provolone but I feel strongly than a meatball sandwich should have mozzarella. Luckily I learned that they actually make their own mozzarella cheese and the next day's batch was done that I could get some on my sandwich. If I'm not mistaken though they don't make the mozzarella everyday so it was luck. I had a nice 20 minute conversation with the owner and he explains what he would like the restaurant to be in the future. He was an extremely nice man. The conversation took me back to when i was a kid growing up in Massachusetts and my grandparents were still alive and making their meatballs in the kitchen. My partner got the pork version of the meatballs and could not stop talking about it. Overall I highly recommend this restaurant...

Someone close to me had tried some of the Queen's offerings and suggested I give them a whirl.  Suggestion noted. Since it was right before closing on a Sunday, Macaron Queen was out of 3 per bag, so I had to buy the 5 per bag.  There were some customers when we first approached, but they dissipated, and then the attendant came over to help us.  I wanted to try blueberry and pistachio, so she patiently helped me select a bag with blueberry, pistachio, key lime, red velvet, and strawberry something.  I forgot.  I wish the bags listed the flavors inside.  I got distracted by all the excitement I guess.  10% off with Yelp check-in, yes!  The packaging is very pretty and gift-ready for giftees.So I'm still on the fence about macarons in general.  I liked them but am not in love with them.  I'll put macarons in the friend zone.  They are beautiful, have pretty hues, and could be wee cheeseburgers.The flavors were very subtle for the most part, though key lime really was the most memorable and strongest.  Then blueberry.  The buns were reminiscent of compressed cake with a eggshell-like exterior.  I keep looking at macarons and expect them to be like wafers but they aren't.I'd definitely give macarons and Macaron Queen another go; I want to see how others compare to the Queen's.

It's as if a sports bar and a dive bar mated, and the jolly roger was their clean baby, who statistically should have been addicted to crack, or paint thinners at least.We sat down at the bar and were promptly served.  I ordered the honey chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce, and my girlfriend ordered the mushroom burger.  I think.  Either way, the food was immaculate.

I'd usually be embarrassed to make such a confession but I've decided to keep it real... yep, it's true: my name is Jelena and I'm a Torchy's taco addict. But before we dive into the taco breakdown, there are two other menu items that warrant your attention: the street corn (off-the-cob roasted corn topped with ancho aioli, queso fresco, cilantro and red chili powder) and the green chile queso (homemade chips served with a cheese dip comprised of queso fresco, guac, cilantro and diablo hot sauce). Like any good parent (even though I'm not), I cannot tell you which of these side items I prefer. Just know that they're both ridiculously good, so I usually end up alternating between them. I wish there were a better solution but they're not inexpensive dishes... and, let's face it: no one should eat this much cheese in one sitting.Tacos are all terrific but the two standouts (for me, anyway) are the Brush Fire (Jamaican jerk chicken+grilled jalape√±os+mango+sour cream+cilantro) and the Green Chile Pork (slow-roasted pork carnitas+queso fresco+cilantro+onions+lime wedge). Both the Jamaican jerk chicken and pork carnitas woo and easily seduce all 8,000* of my taste buds - the meat is juicy, tender, well-seasoned and even a tad smoky. Friends, I am a fan. Though the price tag per taco may seem awfully spendy ($3.25 - $4.75), I can vouch that they're much bigger than the typical taco. I usually can't finish two if ordered √† la carte and barely one if I spring for the street corn.

The waitress showed us the upstairs area, and gave us the option of the upstairs and the downstairs. The ambiance is intimate and welcoming. You almost feel as though you have been invited to an old friend's stylish new loft, mixing both comfort and intimacy with a stylish flair. Our favorite was the wall of vegetation.Our waitress was friendly and attentive. She gave us just the right amount of time to look at the menu and was very patient when answering questions about the menu. The food was even better. We were given plaintain chips and asparagus sauce as a starter. I chose the tabla de ceviches (assortment of three ceviches) and the green plaintain pizza. My friend chose the crispy avocado rolls, the bu√±uelos and the sesame seared tuna. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. The size of the portions was just right to share between two people, and the flavors and textures of the foods were perfect.When we were done with our meal, I thought I was too full to order any dessert. That was until my friend ordered the tres leches cake. After one bite, I completely forgot that I had eaten an entire meal before that. The cake is sweet and moist and the chocolate sauce is a perfect complement.Overall it was a wonderful experience. The atmosphere was great, the service was great and the food was fantastic.

A little gas station/auto garage/grocery store in Leon Springs decided to sell smoked meats in 1989, and Rudy's BBQ was born.  Now they're in [too tired to count] locations across the southwest. Sure, there's turkey and other stuff, if you're a girl (ok, i find the sausage is fairly good).  But we stick mostly with the brisket, which is about eight bucks or so a half-pound (you can get any amount you want, not just half-pound increments).  Which makes it just a couple bucks or so less than Franklin and the \\"big boys of BBQ\\" pricing.  We actually got some Franklin and Rudy's side-by-side the other day.  And yes.... It's certainly no Franklin.  It won't melt in your mouth, and the flavor is a bit more one-note.  But it's a pretty good note.  And I can live in denial with how caloric that cream corn must be.  It's really the best side I've gotten at a BBQ joint.  Every single dessert isn't gluten friendly (I've wondered about picking the 'nilla wafers out of the banana pudding, but wouldn't risk my wife's health for that), but all protein choices except the pulled pork contain NO wheat.  Though with the free Mrs. Baird's bread flying around there, it's not friendly to those extremely sensitive to gluten.  Though they say the cream corn \\"contains wheat\\", my wife oddly has never been affected by it.And finally... The \\"Sause\\".Yes.  I'll say it.I like their BBQ sauce better than either of the three Franklin sauces, at least for brisket.  Though, to be fair, sometimes it's just great to savor Franklin's brisket without sauce, which I probably wouldn't really do at Rudy's.  And they do a pretty decent catering job.Sure, I've walked away when I've seen the line go all the way to the door (ain't nobody got time to wait 25 minutes there), but we do like Rudy's.4.1 stars."},{"name":"Cask'n Flagon","address":"62 Brookline Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Better come to this bar ... drinks are so cheap after the game and the bar back James and bar tender Chris   are soo helpful and friendly ... coming back here soon with all my friends"},{"name":"Torchys Tacos","address":"4301 W William Cannon Dr, Ste G-400","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"OK, I'll start by rating it on its merits: the food's pretty much like the other locations, it's nice that it's close to my house and has decent parking, etc.But I have to warn you, it's stuffed to the gills with kiddos on weekend afternoons.

Very good service and a pretty cool place too. I would not, no way in heck, wait more than 15 minutes for this place, it's really not worth it with all the good food around Portland. We got there when they opened so we got a table immediately but my wife said sometimes people wait a long time for a table. Nope, not here.Not that it's a bad place, but it's not worth a long wait in my opinion. You can find a great place within walking distance if there were a long wait.

When they said it would be half an hour, I was like sweet!  Well, guess what, they showed up within half an hour!!  I was impressed.I ordered an Ultimate pizza, which is basically a smorgasbord of ingredients.  3 different meats and 3 different vegetables.  Again, I was expecting one layer of all the ingredients combined, so a little bit of each on the whole pizza.  Wrong again!  They did not skimp on the ingredients.  The thing was loaded!  It had probably a whole bell pepper and a half.  Again, impressed.As for the flavor, it was very good, but not mind-blowing.  When you've got so many ingredients, you're basically just tasting the ingredients, which I don't mind.  I ordered an extra-large of the Ultimate, which came out to $18.  Totally sweet.

Previously, I've come close to closing time on a week night and ordered a yakult passion fruit drink. I was told that you cannot customize sweetness with the yakult drinks. That is unfortunate, because this drink was WAAYY too sweet, and kind of gross. Don't order that. My biggest hang-up is that they run out of their cooked foods (snacks) frequently. My first visit, they had no fried chicken nuggets. That's fine, it was the end of the day, you probably shut off your fryer already.

We used to cab it to Chinatown, but our last visit there to get our Pho fix was also the last straw.  Although Chinatown is great for it's authenticity in Asian foods, we found that getting reasonable customer service was almost impossible.  There's nothing worse than having to ask numerous times for water to drink!  So, after some serious research, we finally found Pho Basil online, read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  It also was an added bonus that it was really close so we could walk there.  We almost walked right past it since the sign is a little hidden from the street view, but as soon as we walked in, we were greeted with smiles from the waitresses and seated immeadiately.  After scanning the menu for a few minutes and finding our mouths pratically watering with curiosity, we decided to start with a few appz. and some drinks.  I ordered a strawberry fruit shake which was fabulous.  And wouldn't you know it?  Water was given to us without even asking for it.  For the appz. we had the shrimp shumai, gyoza steamed dumplings and the fried spring rolls with chicken and pork.  All three dishes were fantastic and I highly recommend either one or all.  After the appetizers, we could hardly wait for our bowls of Pho.  When they came out, the smell was irresistable.  When we dove in to savor the flavors, we were pleasantly surprised at how awesome it was.  The meat wasn't fatty, but very lean and tender- just right, and the broth itself wasn't too light or too greasy.  Our waitress was very nice by accomdating us with more table space since we had quite a bit of food on our table.  She graciosuly added another table to make a 4-top so everything was in easy reach and not in danger of being pushed off the table.  She also refilled our water and checked in on us every now and then without being overbearing.  She was very pleasant and was very helpful with questions we had about the menu.  The atmosphere of the place is over all, comforting and cheery and the bathrooms are very clean as well (another added bonus).  The prices are very reasonable, especially for Back Bay and the menu selection seems to be daring with a wide variety of different things.  We are looking forward to trying other things the next time we are there.All in all, this place is awesome.  My boyfriend and I are pretty stoked on the fact that we finally have a favorite Pho place.  Best of all, we found out that they also deliver, so we're really excited about that too!

Are my standards to high or was that kinda rude and not really helpful?(**Soapbox** I'm so tired of the lack of good quality service in restaurants lately. When a patron tells you there is a problem they are giving you a chance to fix it. Take the opportunity to do so and keep your client relationships in tact. Lastly, if you check on your people regularly, they are more likely to let you know early when there is a problem. This limits refunds by offering solutions before a person's food gets cold and gross. **End Soapbox**). I did have to ask for a manager. Her name was Emily. She did everything right. She apologized, offered a solution, (i.e. Let me get you another bowl of soup and I'll personally make sure to add a few pieces of crab for you) checked for agreement, fulfilled what she promised, then checked for satisfaction. The second bowl was prepared to go. This is the experience I expected from Nordstrom employees. This was a 2 Star review, but Emily recaptured the experience for me.

The polenta made an excellent accompaniment and was very enjoyable.  So, between the meatballs and polenta, comfort food extraordinaire.

Though I had already snacked earlier, I was down for some fine Italian food. And fine it was.We got lucky enough to capture a coveted outdoor table, and we were treated with good weather, good service, and some fun entertainment from some Italian grandfather. Our service was very nice, too; we didn't seem to have a problem unlike some other Yelpers. It all set us up for a good meal.We initially split some excellent bruschetta with mushrooms, pork, and olive oil, and other delectable herbs. I love mushrooms, and if I could have had those alone for a meal, I would have been happy. We also split the veggie antipasto, which was needed because it was the only veggies I got the entire meal. Each veggie was brined quite nicely, including the surprisingly light wedge of fennel. I then moved on to my entree, which was the homemade pappardelle with wild boar meat sauce. I've become a big fan of pappardelle over the last few years, and it was perfectly al dente for me. The wild boar sauce was great, too, as it balanced the heavy and gamey taste you expect from boar with other lighter tomato flavors. It all made for a dish that I continued to eat until it was completely gone from my dish. It wasn't until I took a breath and sat back that I realized how completely stuffed I was from the meal. That didn't stop me from trying out my friends' dishes, which were also quite good. That also didn't stop me from getting dessert. I got the strawberry and lemon gelato, while my friends got the tiramisu. While the tiramisu was excellent and light, the gelato really finished my meal off right. It was incredibly flavorful and bright, contrasting nicely with the heavy aspects of my hearty meal. Afterwards, we had to take a walk around the block to let the experience soak in and the food digest. I can remember as we were walking just how savory that entire meal was and how very satisfied and content I was in that moment. Memories like that are what makes dining out so fun and Piazza Italia a place I will keep in mind for another occasion."},{"name":"Gennaro's Eatery","address":"12 Blanchard Rd","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"Great price, huge portions, ok food and dessert.The hit or miss depends on the day and time.

First let me say that I love Austin, and I love Tex Mex, and I love that Chuy's embodies both of these. We were so thrilled to hear of Chuy's opening a location in Orlando. We went once during a lull, and it satisfied our deep craving for Austin, Tex Mex, and good food.Being our anniversary, we decided to revisit this special place instead of trying something new. What a mistake as it totally soured our anniversary night for these displaced Austinites. The service was hideous that night.  There was a steady stream of waiters and waitresses to the three patrons across from us with repetitive service for their every desire or just to chat (perhaps a waitress who was moving far away?). We however were not acknowledged or brought chips for an extremely long time after arriving. We were finally acknowledged asking if we would like our picture. At that point, we were ready to see a manager and asked for one.Meanwhile, a well meaning server brought us chips and salsa with the caveat he was not our server.Finally, our server (perhaps?) showed up, but at this time we really pressed for the manager we had previously asked for. So Steve, the manager, finally came and said he would comp us an appetizer. Perhaps, it would have somewhat saved the night if that was it, but the bad service continued with salt in our wounds as the superfluous service continued across from us. Our new server eventually arrived, borrowed from the bar. He seemed really nice and professional; it would have just been great to get some of the timely service the other table was receiving at this point. However, the service continued to be extremely slow. We painstakingly waited for the appetizer of queso. My husband was way past his breaking point by now. We knew by now every single little thing was bound to take 5-10 minutes...at least...waiting for our server to come by at all or to bring another requested bowl of salsa, etc. But I was ravenous and could not wait to call it quits and go elsewhere. Finally, finally our food comes out with a little dribble of sauce. They offer more sauce but we know before we ask it will come after the food is done or cold if we wait. In my excitement to at last eat, I knock over my water over my silverware, my lap, everywhere. No one offers to help, and we wait another 5-10 minutes. We only have one clean fork and still no extra sauce. Our long awaited food is getting cold sharing a fork.  Eventually the server comes; by this time, I guess the mess on the concrete has dried some, and I just want new silverware and napkins. Forget the puddles. Finally, he comes with what we need and all the extra sauce. My husband is livid, and I'm devouring way to much food because I'm about to sink into oblivion with hunger and sadness over the ruins of our anniversary dinner.This is not the way the Austinites would do things. Texans are masters of excellence.

She brought out a giant bottle of hot sauce and ketchup without even being asked. Must have read my mind! I ordered eggs, fried potatoes, bacon, and biscuits & gravy. The eggs (ordered over medium) were cooked to perfection and the biscuits/gravy were very hearty and good. The bacon was a bit wimpy, I prefer thick cut, but tasted good and wasn't over or undercooked. The fried potatoes might have been my favorite part of the meal. They were skin-on red potatoes which was a nice touch, and cooked to just the right balance between crispy and soft.

I loved that the water tastes like pandan which is so genius and refreshing!! If you never had pandan leaves it's a slight coconut taste. We ordered the papaya Pok Pok salad, muu paa kham waan, and of course the Vietnamese fish sauce wings not spicy. I hardly ever eat papaya salad but this salad has bold fish sauce flavor with spice and super fresh, crunchy and had a lot of roasted peanuts which I love. Muu paa kham waan was spicer (really really hot if you don't eat spicy food regularly but soooo good), so spicy it comes with mustard green under ice to cool your mouth down. I liked wrapping the pork in the leaves with a little papaya salad for a flavorful bite. Ok now on to the wings... I thought they were the best damn wings I've had in a long time.

Service is a little spotty (some inexperienced servers, perhaps) and the atmosphere is well designed, but a tad dry (could use some table decoration), but those are minor qualms. I go for the food, which never lets me down. Regular menu favorites: \\nRaw Pad Thai -- There is nothing else like it in town. The flavors are exciting, but not overwhelming like some raw food; it's balanced and not too rich. \\nPesto Rawvilois -- These are incredible. So delicate and delicious. They're also surprisingly filling.\\nJackfruit BBQ -- My favorite from when CC was a food trailer on North Loop. It's perfect!\\nPhilly Seitan -- My second choice sandwich, if I've already had the jackfruit that week. It seems to be the one everyone else picks first--and with good reason.\\nPac Man Salad -- I love the dressing and the kale is always perfectly crisp. My first choice side.Brunch here is insane. A vegan omelet?! Yes, and it's awesome. I've never had anything like it. I had the French Toast the other day; it is an enormous portion and super decadent; I left stuffed, as I do every time I brunch here.Nowadays, since I've had everything on the daily menu, I get the special. The curry pizza was superb and loaded with toppings. I love the cornbread crust. The \\"beetball\\" sub was convincingly meaty. The special soups are always tasty.

Somehow the skin is dryed out and shrivels up or something. The meat is all dark and is tasty, but there was just too much other wierd bones and cartilage type things involved....I dunno, not used to duck and even though I love the meat, perhaps I am not used to it just being cooked and hacked up and served like this...honestly I am a huge fan of meat and this dish kind of made me feel yucky eating it, so guess I can't hang.I'll give this place another shot, and leave a 3 for now, but check out some different dishes."},{"name":"Chez Filet","address":"8255 International Dr, Ste 144A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"After reading the reviews, we walked from the Wyndham to this outstanding experience of attentive service and fine cuisine -- far better than one would expect from a modestly priced restaurant in a strip mall.

It is a small place but very clean. First off I would recommend making a reservation as the locals really like this place.  We tried to eat here the night before but there was a 90 minute wait. Also, in the hour plus we were there, I know they had at least 5-7 takeout orders picked up. The average price for a meal was around $22.00 but you really get your monies worth.They offer some wonderful Italian food.  Once seated, they bring out a loaf of bread and homemade garlic butter.  The bread isn't warm but it is golden brown and very fresh.  There were 4 of us and we ate 3 loaves.  I had the chicken parmesan which came with Alf redo noodles in red sauce with a house salad.  The salad included the normal salad items along with some green beans, spiral and round spaghetti noodles.  The house dressing was light and taste.  The main course was very large and delicious!  The juicy, tender chicken breast was covered with cheese, mushrooms and the tomato sauce was thick and really flavorful.  My husband had the sausage lasagna and he really liked it but it was too spicy for me.  Anyway, everyone had something different and we all come away very content and with enough food for another meal.Service was excellent and the waitress seemed to read our minds because she always showed up when needed but not in a pushy fashion.The next time I'm in Columbus, I will truly eat here again."},{"name":"Round Table Pizza","address":"8120 Number 2 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"We ordered one vegetarian and one Hawaiian for pick up.

If you're picking between the bread or toast options, just get the biscuit.  Hands down.  They are HOMEMADE!  And why would you turn down a biscuit for whole wheat bread, something you can pick up at CVS.  They make their biscuits fresh in the morning and they are super soft and buttery.

Unsurprisingly, the only two things I realized I knew about Portland when deciding to visit was its craft brew culture and a must-see bookstore.In NYC, there is a bookstore, practically an institution, by the name of Strand that touts 18 miles of books within its old, creaky passageways; you can often find me here exploring their collection of second-hand books.  Powell's of Portland has several branches, but at their headquarter \\"City of Books\\" location, I found a bookstore that is a worthy match to Strand, with its own distinct character.By square footage, Powell's is bigger than Strand, occupying a city block.  Books are divided into sections by genre/types not so different than usual, but because the collection is so massive, each color-coded section is located in a different room, with multiple levels.  The store itself is bright and inviting on floors with windows, sporting sleek light wood shelving, good signage everywhere, and frequent information booths.  One can pick up a map for guidance, or download apps that will locate a book and lead you right to it.  And of course, there's a coffee shop inside.I've spent considerable time in used bookstores so as I perused the shelves here, it surprised me that Powell's chooses a sales model where used and new books sit side by side.  It quickly becomes clear that this works; indeed, what reason is there to keep them separated if both are carried?  As a customer, I can choose between price, condition, print edition, and publication formats for a particular book all at once.I am also delighted to see posted notes on many shelves introducing various books, a common feature of indie bookstores, where staff are usually knowledgeable about what they carry and have recommendations to give.  I wasn't there long enough to chat with the staff, but those posted notes are a nice touch.I am incredibly impressed with Powell's; it surely deserves to be called one of the best bookstores in America, by displaying characteristics of indie, used, and new stores.  An ideal bookstore, and certainly a must-see."},{"name":"Rapscallion Kitchen & Bar","address":"208 Fitchburg Turnpike","city":"Concord","stars":"4","text":"A great place to have an after work drink.

We got the wings, the papaya salad, the sticky rice and the boar. I know for damn sure that this place loves fish sauce. If you're wondering why some areas of the restaurant smell like butt, it's because they're heating up fish sauce somewhere. There was fish sauce in 3 out of 4 dishes that we ate, with the sticky rice being the only item without their key ingredient. Since I'm a sucker for fish sauce, I enjoyed all of the dishes. My favorite was the boar.If I had to wait 1.5hr without having any bars or places to visit near by and the food was how it was, I would most likely only give this 3 stars. Since we were able to go near by to grab some drinks and lounge around I think 4 stars is acceptable.

Perhaps the dim light...candles illuminating a small area of the table and the faces of fellow diners...perhaps the excitement borne of an hour plus wait...perhaps the melodious Yelp reviews that christened Pok Pok as the second coming.

The drinking atmosphere and promise of peppers and heat called out for liquor and fermented beverages.  I contented myself with a bing cherry drinking vinegar: tart and sweet with bits of blasted apart bing that needed to be swirled around the glass to get some in every sip.

It was greasy and addictive: the dough unsweetened by any topping it seemed and dripping with more oil than gulf-coast shrimp.  The ice cream and sweet milk melting gloriously before I could soak it all up and in.What an empire they have created: excessive waits and the overflowing crowds directed down the street to their other venture to drink the time away until called back to Pok Pok's festive underbelly or holiday-lit patio.

It might be authentic, but the food was really salty for my taste. Especially the fish sauce chicken wings. They also weren't as crispy as I like, but that could have been because this was a take out order and they sat in a box for 20 mins before we started eating. The catfish with noodles was not as salty and had a nice flavor. I really enjoyed the papaya salad since it was a refreshing balance to the overly salty chicken wings.

Our food came out quite promptly and everything was very pretty and neat. Between the three of us, a beet salad, mussels, crab cakes, pasta, salmon, and shrimp was had. And wine. Only reason for the lack of the fifth star was that it wasn't an amazing five-star taste sensation worthy kind of a restaurant.

My girlfriend and I tried to come here earlier on our trip, but the wait was too long and we were hungry! To our surprise, we ended up meeting a group of people here the next day for the Sunday Brunch! Yay!   For Sunday Brunch, there was also a decent wait (about 45 minutes for a group of 8) but it was all good because they had a bar! The outside of Moonshine is deceiving because it looks like it's only one place, but there are a number of small little areas with extra seating and even outdoor areas with fireplaces. The set-up here is unlike any other restaurant that I have been to. The whole restaurant is super rustic and homey. I loved it! While we waited, the hostess pointed us in the direction of the back bar to wait. We all enjoyed bloody mary's and mimosas which were only $4 for their Sunday brunch... which helped pass time! We ended up being seated in a small little room that only had 4 tables inside. This was a very intimate setting that almost made it feel like you were eating at someone's house. It was perfect for a large group. On Sunday's they only offer the brunch buffet. I would have preferred the full menu but there was enough of a variety on the buffet to make up for it. Their brunch selection was HUGE with everything from green chile grits (my personal favorite) to cornflake crusted chicken. Everything on the buffet was different from your typical eggs, waffles, and bacon at every other brunch spot. Highly recommended for brunch- worth the wait!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"the food isn't nearly like it used to be.

First off walking in there is a hugh bar and comfortable looking bar.  There were many seats available which I was surprised to see so we sat there.  I will admit the 2 male bartenders could have cared less about attending to us and we were probably 2 of 6 patrons at the bar on a Sunday.  Not sure what their issues were but whatever.  I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup and the grilled cheese had tons of different type of cheeses in it on ciabatta bread and the tomato soup was definitely not out of a can.  It was very delicious.  My husband ordered a burger and said yum many times to himself as he was eating it.  He said the burger was very good.  So all in all, the food was very good and we would definitely go back - hopefully with new bar staff to make the experience even better.  The restaurant seating and atmosphere is very welcoming.

Regardless of what sauce you choose, I highly suggest substituting the homemade pappardelle pasta. It's very, very good!The area the restaurant is located in is nice and it's fun to walk around after dinner. The ambiance at the restaurant is a bit unexpected.

Located just off of Canyon Rd, you walk into the hotel lobby to enter the restaurant. The interior is tastefully decorated and the view is relaxing.  With the copious foliage outside, it is easy to forget that just on the other side is busy road. We were under the impression that there was a full bar (we wanted a coffee nudge) but there wasn't. We were able to order mimosas with our breakfast.  It seemed like the waiter was either very new or just very young. Maybe both.  I had a BLTE, it's an open faced sandwich and the E is an egg (over-easy for me).  I was a little disappointed because I only got two very crispy pieces of bacon. I prefer my bacon not to be too crispy and I was expecting more bacon. The sweetheart had chicken and waffles. It was okay. The waffles were fluffy. If you stay at the hotel, they do have a nice complimentary breakfast menu. It's better than a continental breakfast.

My parents were visiting and we decided to try Gennaro's on a Saturday night.  It was rainy and I was a bit nervous we'd have to leave as my mom is known to have perpetual ants in her pants and it was packed and there was standing room only waiting for table's (apparently the norm).  But I must say, nothing intrigue's me more than a bunch of people willing to stand and wait around for food.  Luckliy, my mom agreed so we joined the herd.  Surprisingly, we only had about a 25 minute wait and I was more comfortable than I thought I'd be.  They'll even get you a glass of wine if you like while you wait, which I thought was great.So we get seated at a table which always gets me a bit anxious when I'm with my mother because she's been known to be a \\"booth-or-go-home\\" lady (I know. fun.) but she stuck it out because she had a front row seat to the caravans of other patrons' food while we waited and she was clearly excited about ordering her own dish.  It was fabulous. I dont need to go into too much more detail other than the fact this was way better than I would have expected (not sure why, but the outside just didn't lead me to believe this would be a place I'd continue to return to).  But it is.  In fact, I might go get take-out from there tonight because as I'm typing this my stomach is urging me \\"gnocchi.....gnoooooocccchhhhii!\\"  Gennaro's gets my stamp of approval (which I'm sure many of you were waiting for) and a promise of my future loyal patronage.oh PS, and we learned this the hard way on a rainy night, but parking is a pain in the you know what.  I don't know if it's frowned upon or what, but we parked across the street in the kind of strip-mallish type place right by the stoplight & crosswalk. So it really wasn't bad as far as gettnig to the restaurant.  More pleasant if it wasn't rainy and cold, but there didn't seem to be many other options as the restaurant's actual lot holds about 10 cars. So head's up!"},{"name":"Avalon Pockets","address":"3564 Tanja King Blvd, Ste 2","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great place to enjoy home style Mediterranean food.

I do NOT recommend this place for parties.  I suspect if you came here with a date wanting to drink craft cocktails at the bar or a small table, you'd have a very different experience.When you host an office party, you have to expect that not everyone drinks alcohol.  Either they're pregnant or they abstain for religious reasons or they're a recovering alcoholic or they are diabetic or on Weight Watchers or they just plain don't drink and drive.  This place has no reasonable accommodation for people who don't drink, and they make you feel like you are putting them out if you want something other than water that doesn't have booze in it.I requested a diet coke w/ grenadine (aka diet roy rogers).  Here's the right way to handle that request:\\n\\"I'm sorry, we don't have sodas here.  Are you specifically looking for something non-alcoholic? (yes) Perhaps we can mix you a mocktail.  What flavors do you like?\\"Here's the wrong way to handle that request, how it was actually handled:\\nWaiter:  \\"We don't have diet coke.\\"\\nMe:  \\"Ok, how about regular coke w/ grenadine\\"\\nWaiter:  \\"We don't have anything like that.  We serve mixed cocktails.  I suppose I could send someone to the store for it.  Be patient.\\"  (Then walks off without waiting for me to say, \\"hey, I just need something w/o alcohol, what are my options?\\" since I'm not actively trying to be difficult.He comes back awhile later with a drink and says \\"diet coke\\", and takes off again.  I take a sip and nearly sputter it out, because whatever is in there with it is NOT grenadine and is distinctly alcoholic.  (I give to one of my friends, she says it's rum.)  Now that I know he sent someone to the store for it, I am extremely self-conscious about saying to him that he missed the entire point, that I wanted a non-alcoholic drink, by adding rum instead of grenadine (how does one confuse those two things, anyway?  Grenadine is pomegranate syrup, for fucks sake.)  Anyway.  I'm sitting there during dinner (which was, to be fair, quite tasty) with no drink, because I didn't want the waiter to see that I hadn't touched the stuff he'd left for me that someone went to the store for.  So one of my friends had pity on me and tried to order a mocktail for me.  And the waiter STILL is going all \\"I don't know what we have\\" on me when she asks if a strawberry mocktail is ok.  I'm like look, I want something sweet and fruity with NO ALCOHOL.  Other than that I don't care.He comes back a bit later with a very tart and not particularly sweet mocktail.  Eh.  At least I could drink it.  Now, lest you think I am just difficult, there were several other people who had issues with this waiter as well acting like they were putting him out by requesting things.  Which leads me to the other reason this place has no business hosting parties.  They gave us one server for a 22 person reservation.  We actually had a few people extra show up, so it ended up being 25.  So, even if this guy were the greatest server ever (which he wasn't) he would have been seriously overworked trying to manage this large of a party.  Which is his management's fault, not his.Also, it was a cold day and we had the party on the patio.  The heaters they had didn't even make a dent in it.  I was having fun only because I enjoyed hanging with my coworker friends, but when my toes went numb, I figured it was time to skedaddle.So I say to the management - if you are going to host parties you\\na) need to be able to politely and effectively accommodate those who cannot or do not wish to have alcohol\\nb) staff enough people for the number expected, one server for every 6-8 people maximum.\\nc)  If you're going to rent out the patio in winter, you need better heating.  Brr!To anyone wanting to come here, just come on your own, not with a party, expecting to drink booze, and you might like it.

MadMex offers both! And they're open fairly late, so if you ever get the late-night munchies, you know where to go (they also have a late-night happy hour in addition to their normal one in the afternoon/early evening). My top three favorite things that MadMex offers (in order of preference): 1. Ice Cream Burrito - I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this, since the thought of ice cream on a tortilla wrapper was never something that occurred to me, but boy was my mind blown! Whatever they use for their tortilla, it perfectly complements the giant serving of ice cream within. Moreover, they offer this dessert both Saturday (cinnamon-sugar and honey) and Sundae (whipped cream and hot fudge) style. In case you're wondering how you'll ever decide which style to get - rest assured, you can order this burrito half-and-half and get to try both! I personally like Sundae style more because I'm a huge fan of chocolate and hot fudge, but both are absolutely amazing. 2. Wings - I've tried both the San Francisco and the Southwestern, and absolutely loved both. The San Francisco has a stronger umami flavor, whilst the Southwestern is a bit more tart (as you'd expect for something with that name). We ordered medium spicy on the wings, but I think I'll have to go for their strongest next time, since medium was pretty underwhelming in terms of spiciness. 3. Gobblerito - it's a seasonal dish, which is why it only makes third place. I don't like the idea of being denied one of my favorite dishes for 9-10 months out of the year!! That being said, it is literally Thanksgiving in a burrito. I split one with a friend, and we both left completely stuffed. It can easily feed 2-3 people (probably even 4 if you order a few apps). This ingenious invention is just an explosion of mashed potato, turkey, cranberry, gravy, and stuffing deliciousness.

I made this the last stop on our Portland experience since the best is saved for last. I hope. It was a Monday morning and our group of 5 showed up 5 minutes prior to opening and was greeted by a rapidly-growing lineup of 25 people. What surprised me was the building itself. It literally was someone's backyard and residential house converted into a patio-like dining area. There was also limited seating in the renovated \\"basement\\" of the house but we opted to be outdoors.Service was a little slow since they served people in the order they lined up in. I'm quite amazed at how they actually remembered who was first. Our waiter was dressed in a black tee and red headband and looked like a carbon copy of Zach Galifianakis - minus the sunglasses and baby of course. He was quite friendly and helpful once he served the customers who came in before us.Between the 5 of us, we ordered a whole game hen (Kai Yaang), Ike's fish sauce wings, papaya pokpok, boar collar meat, and the pokpok special (half a game hen). The winner here was the wings by a country mile. It's what they're famous for in New York and I can see why. The Papaya pokpok salad also deserves a special mention. We also ordered a round of thai iced teas which were delicious and refreshing on that hot summer day.As a man with hollow legs, I found the portion sizes to be a tad small. Considering each one averaged $15, it would've taken 2 entrees to fill the tank. Perhaps it's the overly casual environment that made it feel like I'm at a roadside cafe in Bangkok.Despite being overhyped in every travel magazine and forum, PokPok provides a solid experience from start to finish.

I was also not impressed by their topping selection as I mostly stick to fruit. They had pineapple, honeydew and 3 raspberries. My bf likes the sweeter stuff though so he loves their toppings of candy, brownies and various other sweets. When we went to pay and tried to use the Yelp check in for 5oz free and the lady just shook her head. I looked at her confused and she said they lowered their prices a few months ago and that offer is really old. Maybe they should take it down then? It's funny because for lower prices, it was almost $13 for the two of our yogurts. My bf's was on the larger side but nothing huge, mine was average. Overall they were overpriced, the yogurt consistency was off and they don't have enough healthy topping choices. I also don't appreciate that they wouldn't honor their Yelp offer.

I had the ribeye for my entree, which was cooked properly - but overpowered by the bordelaise on it. I think that was a ploy to cover up the fact that this ribeye was not prime, as advertised, but rather a choice cut. My wife said the bolognese wasn't memorable at all.

I had the half (it's more than enough for anyone not currently employed as a linebacker or growing teenage boy) pancakes and pulled pork this morning and it knocked me on my arse. Exceptional, and still under $10 for a pancake, the pork, two eggs, and hashbrowns. The good, in general: hashbrowns are actual HASHBROWNS, shredded and panfried, not cooked potatoes/yams. Hard to find in Vancity. Decently priced breakfast fare, with most stuff under $12 and massively portioned. Coffee is adequate. Service is also adequate.The meh, in general: biscuits are a bit tough. The rye toast is weird and overly dense. The mimosa for two is just a cheap mini bottle of bubbly with a cheap mini bottle of OJ. One time, they let a kid lick the nozzle of the ketchup bottle. Definitely go for the standards...basic eggs and stuff is $7 and all done well. They'll sub out tomatoes for the meat. The sausage is actually pretty good.

Without piling on the yum yum sauce, the food was pretty tasteless. Most didn't eat and didn't bother to take it home. A big waste of money.

The third time I went to The Nook was yesterday afternoon for drinks with my two girl friends. We sat at the bar and we're welcomed by two friendly bartenders. We had three cinnamon toast crunch shots to start (bartenders choice) which tasted just like the cereal, and a fish bowl to share.

Found this place on Yelp that was highly rated and near the hotel so perfect.  Actually, as we walked up to the place, the outdoor covered patio area was thumping with some old school Sir Mix-a-Lot.  However, as we entered the establishment, partner and I were greeted with a quiet, conversational ambience with soft rock in the background.  There were a few couples and small groups around, but nothing as rambunctious as the patio.  It took a few minutes to get seated, but luckily the kitchen was still going strong.  The waiter forgot partner's beer, but it came eventually.  The appetizers all sounded really good in a fried, cheesy goodness kind of way and the desserts all sounded delicious.  We ended up getting the spinach and artichoke fondue with mozzarella, parmesan, and garlic bread and the white chocolate bread pudding with raisins, bourbon sauce.  The menu reflects a Southern comfort style.  The fondue was creamy and heavy so I didn't have much.  Had to save room for dessert!  My bread pudding was served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a dollop of whipped cream.  It was sweet, but not too much so and filling.  I couldn't finish it partially because I didn't want to go crazy pigging out.  As we were leaving, they were setting up for their Sunday brunch buffet.

With that in mind, I waited an hour and a half on a Thursday night. \\nthere wasn't really waiting room for anyone, which is a shame. \\nThis place was really good, but probably not worth such a long wait. \\nIt's cool my waitress brought out popcorn. I'm not really a popcorn person, though. I ordered the chicken and waffles, which I highly recommend. \\nIt was very tasty. The portion sizes are very large, and you can probably split them between two people if you aren't extremely hungry. \\nThe service was good. \\nI hope to come back at a less crowded time."},{"name":"Cuba 512","address":"6800 West Gate Blvd, Ste 112","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Love, Love, Love this place.  The food is well seasoned and delicious.  My addiction are the Croquetas.  I love the Croquetas so much I attempted to make a batch at home, along with Maduros, however it tastes so much better at Guantanamera.  They can expect to see more of us, since I intend to try some of their veggie dishes."},{"name":"Ceviche Tapas Bar & Restaurant","address":"125 W Church St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant last Tuesday. We found out on Tuesdays some of the tapas are half off so this was a great deal. I definitely suggest checking this place out on a Tuesday. What really sold me was the place. It was just gorgeous inside - reminding me of a true place from Spain. Our server was also great and extremely knowledgeable. The tapas are a bit overpriced if we didn't go on a deal night. But I was very pleased with our dinner and our view that looked at the beautiful Church Street. Go a bit later in the evening for a more lively crowd."},{"name":"Kismet Cafe","address":"411 W 24th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Kismet is pretty satisfying if you just really crave a decent gyro, and cheap on those, too. As other have said, the people are really nice. They're from Jordan and if you come in by yourself and it's quiet, they'll chat with you. The reason for the 3 stars and not 4 or 5 is that I'm a big fan of lamb, and I've had it twice here. The flavors are good, but it was just dry and chewy. I've had great Mediterranean style meat before at the Greek festival in Houston, and oh baby, when it's cooked right, it's flavorful, tender, and has that melt-in your mouth goodness. This was disappointing for the price. Good tabbouleh and knock out hummus though!I visit this place a few times a month, as long as I stick to gyros I'm not disappointed."},{"name":"Sam LaGrassa's","address":"44 Province St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Rarely do things live up to the hype (especially super hype when you consider that this place was on DD&D and all the raving yelp reviews), but this is an exception.I got the chipotle pastrami sandwich, and I can honestly say it's probably the best sandwich I've ever had.  I'm not going to bother going into the details because other yelpers here have said it all.  It's just a perfect sandwich.

Wine room is down the road, so we didn't feel we needed another wine place. We were wrong.Super friendly greeter and waiter. I suspect he may be an owner. There was an attentiveness and explanation of the menu that is getting more and more rare.We happened upon a happy hour menu. The rating is based on that good value. $22 for 3 courses. Primavera cooked vegetable saladb was delicious and plated beautifully. The plating reminded me of Sketch, a very high end restaurant in London. Second course was Picanha. Beautifully plated and delicious. Interesting choice in serving the gravy, and it was very good.Dessert lemon tart was the final course. Deconstructed and delicious, I was shocked at how good this was.Beer was $2 off during happy hour. My wife had a very nice $5 glass of red wine.I love when they process your payment at the table, and they do that here. Had some skimming issues back in Miami, so I like seeing where my credit card is.I rarely give 5 stars, but this place is definitely worth trying.

My server was Cassandra and she was outstanding, courteous, and attentive. I ordered my usual which was lechon w rice n red beans w maduros and I ordered tostones for the app. The lechon is INSANE it is so damn good that when your body is telling you to stop eating you will still keep eating. Red beans were ok, they need a little work. Not enough flavor, but not bad. Maduros were perfect, soft n sweet. The tostones, man o man, finally somebody is doing it right. At Havana on congress you get these thick round disks that are bland. At Guantanamera they make them traditional which is FLAT n flaky. Making them flat is key and every Rican like me or Cuban knows this, except at Havana lol. Also it wasn't even happy hour and I ordered a couple of Coronas and they were cheap as hell like $3.75 I think. So I had all that food plus 2 beers and the bill was just over $30. Also the portion was large so I got to eat some more pork n rice n beans later that night. The value here is great, I hope they keep it that way. Great food, great server, ice cold beer, and great bang for the buck.

As we walked in, one of the only two customers there yelled, F%#k...!\\" Oh boy. Waited at the door of this small establishment expecting a greeting of some sort from the bartender, who was busy chatting with the yeller. Seeing no movement on her part, we approached her, asked for the fish & chips. \\"Small or large?\\" No menu offered. My husband ordered an ale but I wasn't sure what nonalcoholic drinks they offered. \\"Okay you don't know what you want,\\" the bartender said as she turned to fill a glass of ale. I'm bypassing some stuff so you don't get bored. We sat ourselves at a table. At no time did anyone, including what I surmise to be the owner, who was busy chatting up other people, stop to make us feel welcome or \\"at home\\" as some others have said here. The only other time that the bartender/server approached us was to pick up the plates and ask if there was anything else we wanted. We asked for a dessert menu, and she said, \\"We only have chocolate (as in chocolate bar??). We took the desserts off the menu.\\" We had to approach the bar to ask for a bill and pay. We felt so lonely and out of place there. Stars only for the fish & chips, which was lovely, but didn't come with any other sides."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"A true delight to the palate.

Located in an old building with exposed brick walls, the restaurant is warm and inviting.  The bar is well stocked with Texas beers such as Independence and Austin Beerworks, complemented with a nice selection of classic cocktails.  Eat on the patio if the weather is nice.I ordered the cornflake fried chicken salad - a generous portion sprinkled with pieces of crispy bacon and chunks of avocado.  The chicken was tender and crispy, if a bit bland.  Overall, a satisfying and tasty, but not mind-blowing, salad.My companions ordered the pimento cheeseburger, which looked glisteningly meaty and enormous.  Despite the name, the consensus was that the burger was surprisingly bland.Overall, a nice choice for drinks and dinner, although not sure it's worth more than a 30 minute wait."},{"name":"Thai New West","address":"424 E Columbia Street","city":"New Westminster","stars":"4","text":"The atmosphere here is so good and the servant is polite and nice.

Such a shame as it has such potential. I liked the atmosphere, but if you want similar atmosphere, head to the Parlour on the next street over, much better food and service. Me and my friends had a selection of tapas style food as well as cocktails and there was nothing that we felt impressed by. We even mentioned we were particularly unhappy with a dish and the only response was 'I'll let the chef know'. We sent a cocktail back after waiting 20 minutes for our drinks with the only excuse of 'the barman is new'. Really expensive bill and after paying on my card, with the intention to leave a cash tip (although wasn't deserted), the waitress questioned why I hadn't tipped on my card, as well as asking if we'll be paying for our friend for her birthday (in front of the birthday girl!) really unprofessional.
