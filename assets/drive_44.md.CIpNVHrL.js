The concierge recommended several places, but our options were severly limited (on a weekday night at 10p) and this was the highest rated and within walking distance of the choices we had.\\n\\nMy gf got the spinach salad and I got the tenderloin sandwich (based on the waiter's recommendation)... wow!  Interesting tid bit:  each sandwich (roughly a dozen+ options) was created by a chef in town (yes, from other restaurants) and then featured with their names on the Parish Cafe's menu.  What a novel premise!  Indeed, there were several unusual creations that I wanted to try, but I had to go with the steak recommendation.  At $20 I hesitated because it was the most expensive sandwich (most were between $12-$15) but the waiter didn't flinch and I recognize tenderloin is not cheap.  The salad was good, but I only had one quick bite (I'll leave it to her to write a review :)  I only wish we had time/room for dessert at this cafe, but with midnight approaching and with a full morning ahead of us (including bfast) we had to pass.\\n\\nAs for ambiance, being July, we sat al fresco where the cafe featured about 7-8 tables ranging from 2-tops to 4-tops.  The patio was 3/4 full at this hour and there was also always at least 1-2 staff outside, along with a dedicated register/computer.

The donuts they use for savory items are not sweet, but like a fry bread. I would wish more than anything to have the option for a glazed version instead, because... you know, that would be awesome.

Ah-ha - I understand, regardless I'd still recommend this appetizer. \\n\\n- Fried Chicken:  WOW!  The highlight of the show.  Crispy good, not greasy, meat was juicy and tender, very flavorful, a slight seasoned kick to it.  I couldn't stop eating it and kept reading the menu to see if I could upgrade to a bucket.  I don't like anything too greasy or overcooked and this chicken was none of that - - cooked to perfection.  With the 2 sides I felt it was well priced @ $7.75 (in the 78701 too ya know).  \\n\\n- Sides:  Seasoned fries were just regular cut fries that are lightly salted, they were hot and fresh but nothing out of the ordinary here.  Potato salad is mayo based and had a slight sweetness to it which I liked.  Next time I'm going for the coleslaw.  \\n\\n- Chicken Tenders:  Again, WOW!  Superb.  Just like the Fried Chicken they were crispy, not greasy at all, quality chicken meat plus hot & juicy.  I can't think of anyone who has Chicken Tenders this good, I've had my fill but I really like these.  They're well sized and you can add them to your dinner plate @ $1.75 each.  No dipping sauce comes with it but the waiter said they'll have honey mustard.  \\n\\n- Service:  Prompt, courteous and professional.  Everyone there was very nice, the waiter gave excellent recommendations and was prompt with drink refills.  Brian came over to check on me, and I (think) the owner also made a stop over to see how everything was.  I definitely felt like I was part of a family there.  \\n\\nI had a nice talk w/ the owner and he brought up a good point.  Being new to the restaurant business when he started w/ Gus's he too was eager to add in specialty items (i.e. homemade ranch and more sauce) and tweak it, but he realized that this place is successful as-is and he's gotta get the foundation stuff right - - like the fried chicken for starters, and the rest of the menu.  That makes sense - - duplicate what's successful in Memphis first and get it right, then everything else is gravy.  \\n\\nHe's right - and I can appreciate someone who's focused on achieving perfection the right way.  It made me think of a recent infamous California Burger chain that just opened up in Austin who've been unable to duplicate the same great experiences in I've had in Cali.  I bet this fried chicken is just as good as it is in Memphis, it's savory and succulent good!"},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"So, I know that this is a chain and maybe it was an off night.

The wing dings were good, however they were NOT monster in size so that's false advertising, plus they were greasy. The flat bread was not flat bread at all, but pita bread flavored with garlic. The garlic flavor was OK, but then it was covered in large pieces of RAW onion & large slices of tomato. Gross! That was also greasy. How the hell flat bread made with pita bread can be greasy is beyond me, but the pizza box it came in was dripping in grease so bad, I had to put the plastic bag under it so it wouldn't get all over the furniture. Lastly, the ziti dish was even worse. How the hell can anyone screw up pasta? The ziti was overcooked & mushy, the sauce tasted like ketchup with bits of tomato from a can, the meatballs were awful (wonder if there was any beef in them?) and lastly, the alleged cheese melted on the top was this sphere of something that looked like someone puked on the dish! After only a couple of bites, I threw the entire pasta dish in the trash! After spending $30+/- plus tip, I feel totally cheated. The only positive thing I can say is that the driver was very nice and for that alone I didn't mind tipping him.

Our party of 6 had put our names down and was given an estimation of 30min around dinner time but we were able to get an entire high-top table within 15. \\n\\nWe started at the bar/raw bar and got some beers and a variety of fresh Oysters, and then ordered a bunch of apps and dishes when we got to our table. The mussels were a fam fave - we got three orders and could have eaten more. Both sauces are so delicious - I personally preferred the fra-diavolo one. We also got crab cakes and calamari to share. All were decent.\\n\\nEntrees everybody got something different but we ended up sharing 1 entree per two people because of how filling the apps were.

I asked what the cheese was that the dish originally comes with and the guy working there told me it was a blend of cheddar and asiago.\\n\\nI really recommend ordering from for the first time without extra cheese. Reason being, the original flavor of the cheese without the extra is actually quite delicious and I find extra cheese to be unnecessary. Simply because they provide a lot keeping the mac very flavorful. It was a very sharp and bold flavor and it was already quite cheesy and creamy. The extra cheese would definitely over do it.\\n\\nAs for the toppings, I went ahead and got chicken, bacon, tomatoes and jalapenos. The jalapenos provided an excellent spicy kick that didn't make the dish too spicy, but just the right amount. Tomatoes seemed fresh, and the chicken and bacon were both well cooked. The bacon was crispy as well, and wasn't left stringy and chewy which I would find unpleasant with my pasta. It seems as if they know what they are doing here, and although this may be the most I've spent on mac and cheese, it was very well worth it.

We found Top Burmese on Yelp, as it's super near where my bestie lives, so wanted something we could walk to for a late dinner.  \\n\\nWhen we arrived to Top Burmese, we learned that the space is on the retail level of an older, small residential building and it's tiny inside!  There were literally only two tables for dining in, so when we were there around 9pm, we were unable to get a seat and were told by the super friendly staff/owners to come back in 30 minutes if we wanted to dine in, which we did.  Much of the space is used as their kitchen. \\n\\nWhen we arrived half an hour later, the place was still packed and learned that the staff had turned away another party who wanted to dine in because they were waiting for us to come back!  The friendliest people work here, as it's a family-run business.  \\n\\nMy friend and I ordered samosas, beef curry with paratha, beef curry with coconut rice and two mango juices.  In fact, if you check-in on Yelp you get a free drink of your choice, and would highly suggest the mango juice which is made in-house and you can customize how much sugar you want.  \\n\\nThe food was amazeballz!  What's especially nice at Top Burmese is that you can order the entrees at a petite or regular size and the petite size was definitely enough for one person.  I'd recommend the regular size for family style dining.  The samosas were solid with a potato, carrot and pea filling and was served hot.  They were freshly made and had a nice sriracha-base sauce that came with.  The paratha with the beef curry was super good.  The bread was light but dense, so had lots of great flavor and really soaked up the curry, a perfect side for the beef curry!  But the beef curry and coconut rice was awesome and my favorite, as the curry soaking up the coconut rice was true comfort food and the beef was outta-this-world-tender!  I loved how flavorful the beef curry was without it tasting too heavy.  It's definitely one I would order again and again! \\n\\nI'm not all too familiar with Burmese food, but from what I had here, it's certainly a cuisine I can get behind!  But here at Top Burmese, it really feels like you're eating at the owner's house, as the staff truly made you feel at home.

I decided to make the short drive to the West Side for something resembling real food.\\n\\nI tried the al pastor, chicharron, and lengua tacos.  The al pastor was one of the better versions I've had in the city, but would have been over the top if it had a little pineapple in it.  I requested chicharron, but I'm not sure that's what I got.  It was meatier chunks than what I expected.  Maybe they gave me carnitas instead?  Whatever it was, it was delicious.  I was hoping for the lengua to be more of a stewed preperation, but it was cooked in a dry fried style.  I probably liked those the least, but they were still OK.\\n\\nThere's an authentic Mexican feel to Taqueria Delicias - the signage is in Spanish and most of the clientele on my visit were presumably Mexican.  There were folks singing along with the music in the bar area.  It looks like a laid back place to spend happy hour if you speak Spanish.  The menu items are mostly translated to English, and the service was above average."},{"name":"The Conquistador","address":"2045 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The Conquistador is one of those places that is dangerously close to my apartment with way too good of a happy hour (and it lasts until 7pm!).

The chicken was your standard sesame (balls of meat like any Chinese restaurant on the block) but he loved the fried rice.

It was described as being \\"crispy\\" and \\"caramelized\\", but really it was just deep fried. Lots of flaky white meat, but the breading was too thick and the skin wasn't crispy at all. The fish actually tasted great, but it also kind of reminded me of a filet-o-fish at McDonalds so not sure if it was worth $20. It was literally swimming in a gallon of Thai curry sauce, but luckily the curry tasted amazing so that was a plus. \\n\\nWe heard a microwave ding about 10 times during our meal, which is always a turn off to hear in a restaurant.

However, this location is a case study on how a large chain can lose control over quality service.  A new restaurant always needs a little time to work things out, but this store can't seem to get it right.  Service is slow, inefficient, with employees preparing sandwiches at 9AM for some future lunch rush rather than attending on immediate customer coffee and breakfast orders, and the manager is often nowhere to be seen.

I had to share it with my aunt and I believe if I ate it alone it could easily be 4 meals.  We each had two portions. One for now and one for later. Also I loved the spicy kale chips ginger pineapple and ginger mango vyne as well as the chocolate chip cookie it was perfect no too sweet crunch on the outside soft inside.

When I was in Austin, I just had to go back here twice to eat because it was that good. The line is pretty long but with their very organized system, the line goes by pretty fast. You stand in line and then you go into a little system on the inside. First, you get your sides which you buy by the size. The creamed corn and the coleslaw are definitely a must have! We ended up loving the creamed corn so much we got the whole pint of it. After you get the sides, there is someone who will point you to the cashier who is available. Next to the cashier is a person who will ask what meats you want and will give you all the meat you need. After that, you get your drinks, pickles, white bread and red onions on the side (these are unlimited).\\nThe best thing at terry blacks is definitely their beef rib and their sausages. We also tried their pork ribs but nothing could compare to the beef rib and the sausages. The pork ribs are a little dry because there's not as much fat on it as the beef rib. The ribs and the sausages are pretty salty, but that's because you eat it with the white bread, the pickles and the onions and it just makes it perfect. Their sauces are also some of the nest sauces I have ever had. They have sauces at every table for everyone to use. \\nMy boyfriend and I didn't have a problem with finding a table on the inside, because of their efficient process there are always many people going around wiping down tables and clearing them off so if it's really hot, you definitely will have a table if you're patient and if you don't have a giant group!"},{"name":"La Reyna Bakery","address":"5200 E William Cannon Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I am so upset.

Just be advised that it's something different. If you're absolutely not feeling it, you can substitute French bread. \\n\\nThe meat was SO good. Very well-seasoned and not spicy except by request. My SO ordered his spicy and I did sample it. Definitely has a kick to it. I don't remember which beers we had, but they were pretty good. We split a cream puff for dessert and had coffee.

Or whatever deaf server keeps sneaking to the back and cranking it up, fire them. \\n\\nMy friends and I love food. We love partying, drinking, talking, checkin-in, Facebooking, Instagramming, and most importantly (for you) dropping tons of money. We are not lame, old, or prudes. We love music.

IT'S JUST TOO LOUD!!!!\\n\\nYou need us. This isn't a joke, Bartaco, are you listening to me? Or is your music too loud? I SAID YOU NEED US!!! We are the gay scene of Midtown. Every restaurant in Atlanta wants our business and y'all are lucky enough to be one of few who have managed to get the gays of Midtown to travel outside our parameters of real Midtown and venture into West Midtown for food and cocktails. However, it is quickly spreading around that y'all's music is too loud and for good reason. What's the reason? BECAUSE IT IS! We used to be there all the time -- 3 nights a week minimum. I'd say about three separate occasions now in the past month we have decided against going there because a few people mentioned how annoying it is that we can't hear each other over your music. This isn't a small 2-top or 4-top I'm speaking of. We come in masses and we drop money on tacos and margaritas like they are our children.

Lunch/dinner... not so much.\\n\\nI first tried the Coop shortly after it opened. Like many other reviewers have noted, the sides are hit and miss. I expected the sides shared with sister restaurant 4Rivers would be similar if not exactly the same, but that was not the case, and I was disappointed by the inferior quality of the Coop's products. I grew up with southern food and what I had at the Coop seemed to be a half-hearted approximation. Even the chicken I found to be lackluster. The common thread seemed to be a lack of seasoning. I get not wanting to drown everything in salt but there was not much taste to the mashed potatoes, chicken, or biscuits. I did leave with a delicious fruit hand pie, but no desire to return for anything beyond dessert in the future.\\n\\nHowever, I did decide to give this place another shot today now that they've introduced a breakfast menu. This was a much better experience. Breakfast has some more inventive selections that venture outside the \\"Southern Affair\\" tagline, which was welcome considering my previous experience. I had the King, a French Toast sandwich filled with peanut butter, honey, and bananas and dusted with powdered sugar which was just as delicious as I had hoped it would be. My husband tried the Mexican Scramble, a take on breakfast tacos with chorizo and peppers that was fresh and tasty. I will definitely be back in the future to try the Breakfast Poutine. My only complaint was the biscuit served with my husband's meal... Again, almost completely flavorless despite a perfect texture and sweet glaze. \\n\\nI'd love to be able to upgrade my rating in future updates.

One egg was poached medium hard and the other medium easy that was ok and provided some balance. This was a fantastic dish and worth returning for. I was still hungry after this so I then ordered their:\\n\\nSteak Fajita Taco\\n--If you're not a fan of black pepper, you may not like this taco. Me on the other hand, I love me some black pepper so the highly peppered cut of flank steak was fantastic and went well with the nice dollop of guacamole on top and grilled onions.

The taco does fall apart a bit while eating it, but that's a small price to pay. The steak was tender and juicy.\\n\\nI didn't get a beer on this visit which was hard not to do since they have some great selections on draft. I've also heard their Sake Bloody Mary is great too.

So this leads me to say, last night my husband and I dine at the Howard location and we sit at the bar and was waited on by the bartender name Bobby. I ordered the chicken fajaita with Charro beans. The food arrived and I noticed right away the chicken was different not anything like I gotten before. It looked was very thinly slice and dry so I informed Bobby that I did not want it  he ask me why I explained and ask if they had changed the chicken fajtas and he said no its just the way they are cutting them up. Well he's only been there for a short period of time at that location and with the company because Ive seen him at Stonelake which is where he transferred from. Ok so he continues to argue with me about the chicken and Im still telling him I dont want it. He picks up my plate very fast and tossed the plate in the bucket with the rudeness immediately went straight to the other bartender and told her. Im watching him tell her because he's facing me. Did he ask at the time if there was anthing else I could get you, no he did not. \\n He is definetly is very rude and needs not to be working with the customers with an attitude like that!\\nI have spent lots of money at Baby A's over the years and deserve to be treated with respect. I was so upset I finished my one drink and left, but not before letting Roxanne know what had happen and informed her that when I see Ms. Helen I was going to tell her about that employee Bobby.

This bar has changed hands a couple of times over the years. It used to be called the Stranded Sailor Pub then after that the British pub (the owner was from somewhere in England). Back in those days the venue showcased a band almost every weekend. The Bands were mostly a local rock/punk style genre which we enjoyed although it could be LOUD at times. Regardless, we appreciated the great drink specials and the opportunity to see a local band performing original music right here in downtown Sanford. \\n\\nNow, Throwbacks has more of a sports/interactive gaming vibe which caters to more customers in my opinion. There are a variety of FREE games you can play with friends while enjoying a drink or some quality food from their limited menu. There are multiple TV monitors available for watching sports related entertainment and CHIVE TV. They have a decent sized liquor bar along with some of the best craft beers available for purchase. Robbie (the owner) and Drew have always been super nice and helpful on every visit. I never have to wait long for a drink, even on busy nights. Once you get to know the crew, they treat you like royalty. \\n\\nThere are several large picnic style tables available for dining/drinking and a smaller raised platform that allows additional seating next to the window to view activity on Sanford Avenue. There is a small undeveloped seating area in the front of the venue. I look forward to seeing what Robbie decides to do with this portion of the building. Additionally, there is also a large fenced-in back patio area they will most likely dress up in the near future.\\n\\nAll-n-all Throwbacks is one of my favorite pubs in downtown Sanford.

Love the concept. Booth style seating with a grill in the middle of the table, and every table is by the revolving conveyor belt (try to get a table close to where the food comes out)! There's a drawer on the end of the table with all the tools, plates, and utensils you need to dine. You order your meats via the iPad at each table, and you grab your sushi/veggies/apps via the conveyor belt. Did I mention it's all you can eat? For their soft opening prices, absolutely a steal, though I hear their prices will be increasing after the holidays. The quality is impressive for AYCE. I personally really enjoyed the brisket, filet mignon, tenderloin, and octopus. As far as the conveyor belt, very impressed with the quality of their salmon and seared fishes. I love that they don't pile on the rice on their sushi. They truly have options for everyone. Like if you have a dainty eater in your party, I'm sure they'd love the one egg roll or the avocado rice. \\n\\nSince it's the soft opening, they're still working out some kinks. Some things that definitely could use some improvement is the variety of foods coming out. Initially, barely any veggies were coming out, and it was more or less the same sushis coming out (tuna, salmon, basic snowcrab rolls). Towards the end of our stay, many more options started coming out. Also, not a huge deal, but with all the plates and the grill in the middle of the table, it felt really cramped. We wound up having to put some empty dishes on the seat next to us until a server came and helped clear our table. \\n\\nOverall, I definitely plan on returning. Sushi and Kbbq are two of my favorite things so this concept is brilliant. The options are great, and I love that despite being AYCE, they don't seem to be stingy at all.

The pork ribs are good - some of the edges were overly salty for me, but maybe that's just my preference.

I was pretty skeptical before coming here - were the great reviews biased by spillover from the Flour bakeries? - but the food didn't disappoint at all. Came for Date Night (Mondays and Tuesdays), which has three menus you can choose from for $45/couple and went with Long Walk on the Beach; we were pretty happy with the amount of food we got!\\n\\nIsland Creek Oysters: The yuzu mint ice was DELICIOUS. It went extremely well with the slightly salty oysters and there was enough of it that my date and I just polished it off by the spoonful after eating the oysters. Might actually be the best oyster dish I've ever had.\\n\\nMiso-Glazed Carrots: Also insanely good. I was pretty happily surprised with how much carrot we got. The miso flavor wasn't overpowering, and the carrots had the loveliest sear to them. This and the oysters were definitely the standouts.\\n\\nDan Dan Noodles: Maybe not as inventive as the previous dishes and not my favorite out of the set, but actually the one I'd answer if you asked me which dish I could eat forever. The peanut sauce is really sticky so the noodles look like one homogenous mass at first and they're hard to separate, but don't fret! If you really exercise your fine motor skills with your eating utensil of choice you can pull them from each other without pulling up the entire globe of noodles too. There was also a perfect kick from the chiles.\\n\\nStuffed rainbow trout: The most eh dish of the menu. There was a lot of rice in this...and I mean a lot. It was more rice than fish, which I think detracted from the rest of the flavors. The trout itself was pretty plain, the tomato ginger jam didn't have any discernible ginger, and I didn't taste much coconut in the rice either. On the plus side, the fish was really soft, the skin was crispy perfection, and the dish overall was super filling. \\n\\nOk, so I have to bring up the decor. It actually made me a little uncomfortable. I know this place is Asian fusion, but that does not call for using all of the most blatant Oriental symbols everywhere. I'm talking giant swirling red dragons tattooed across the windows, idealized cherry blossom trees painted on the walls, mini red lanterns strung across another wall, plastic 'Chinese style' teacups used as receipt cups - come on, Chinese restaurants don't even use those, they use the plain white porcelain ones. One or two of these things together is ok, but all of them at once? It just felt like Western exoticization of Asian culture, and I wish they could've toned it down. A touch I did really like though were the the Chinese newspaper placemats.\\n\\nTLDR: overall fantastic and intriguing dishes, if really kitschy decor.

For a beverage, I selected the Columbia Gorge Blackberry smoothie, bottled in Hood River.  \\n\\nAs expected, having been prepared with local organic ingredients, both the Lamb Kofta and the salad greens were exceptionally delicious.  The greens were fresh and I loved the citrus dressing, diced squash and light sprinkle of sesame seeds.\\n\\nThe Lamb \\"meatballs\\" were humongously huge.  While robustly seasoned, the spices were not overwhelming, just right in other words.  The meatballs came with a tomato sauce over mashed potatoes.  The sauce and potatoes were excellent.

Not only did it contain blackberries it also contained pear and apple, plus maybe cinnamon for a quite original flavor.

Simple menus, not an overwhelming amount of offerings but enough that there's someone for everyone (if you like standard BBQ fare). \\n\\nWe ordered Creole BBQ Shrimp as a starter. It was ready super fast, and I really enjoyed it--It was peppery and delicious. My husband and I shared the Applewood BBQ combo with pulled fork, chicken thigh, brisket, baked beans, and cornbread.    The brisket was absolutely delicious, very tender and flavorful, just like the Southern brisket I know and love. It was a little dry, but the flavor and texture was more than enough to make up for it. The chicken was good (I'm not a huge fan of chicken thigh meat, but it was tasty). The pork had a citrus flavor which my husband loved, and it was cooked just right, but the flavor was a little too salty in my opinion. The baked beans were sweet, hearty, and wonderful. The cornbread was...cornbread. Nothing too special there. I was really shocked though, that the extra bbq sauce ramekin was only half full. I love extra BBQ sauce, so that was a minor disappointment. It ended up not being an issue at all--the bbq sauce was not to my liking. It tasted like a watered down, vinegar mess. \\n\\nThe Southern Punch was super delicious.

Not care as in give a damn but care as in checking and checking things twice and ensuring that everyone gets exactly what they want, and not what they dont want. So with that being said, i asked for fresh salsa and i didnt have any problems afterwards. LIES! I asked for a little HOT sauce and she ladled it on thick! Maybe thats also why my tongue is hot!

The dish also had more vegetables than fish ration, which I find a little odd for a ceviche dish. Chicaron (pork belly) dish was okay - nice and moist but quite sweet. Mashed potato dish was good - some nice flavours. Yucca (cassava) was good - nicely salted and crispy. Their pineapple and jalapeño cheesecake was quite good - good cheesecake flavour with a slight hint of jalapeño. I didn't enjoy the donut as much as I thought I would've.

It was given, but didn't include the tip I left, which was another detail that fell by the wayside. We ended up at Mississippi Pizza, which is where we should have gone in the first place.

On the pescatarian front, they have a tuna burger which I've tried a couple times and was very good. I try to keep the burger as close to original offering as possible, in spite of some dietary restrictions, and my burger is always delicious. They also offer a veggie burger, which is black bean and corn. I had it with cheese and some Lactaid. \\n\\nTasted amazing - was sick for a solid 24hours - I rarely ever say this, but it was worth a try. If you visit Hopdoddy's website and go to  \\"order online\\", they provide some clues as to how you can order certain burgers vegan (veggie burger and \\"impossible\\" burger). Also, you can order online and do a pickup order. They usually say the burger will be ready in around 15mins when you order online.\\n\\nMost recently I tried the \\"impossible burger\\", made with vegan \\"impossible\\" meat. I had Favor pick it up. As far as to-go burgers go, it looked very promising when it arrived. I included an untouched-up photo so you can see the real deal of what arrived. The order was packaged really well. The burger tasted more like what I remember meat tasting like than anything else vegan that I can recall having. I ordered mine cooked \\"no pink\\". I got it with no cheese and added a fried egg and avocado. It was very good - almost too good, as I ate a little too much and food didn't sit 100% well with me. (If you have a sensitive stomach, maybe don't go full bore at this place?) Fried egg was served as expected: a little runny in the yolk and the white. \\n\\nCouple more pointers for the dairy-free contingent: You can order their Parmesan truffle fries with no Parmesan. Sassy sauce is Hopdoddy's blend of mayo and house-made horseradish honey mustard (and the messiest part of my burger, followed closely by the fried egg)."},{"name":"Coast Restaurant","address":"1054 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"What a great experience and dinner.

I drove for almost an hour to go pick it up a week later when it was supposed to be ready, and they had no idea what I was talking about when I gave them our name. They also didn't seem too concerned with the fact that someone actually told us that it would be ready, with the words we requested written on it. It was as if that was not something they did, but we were told on the phone that it was. Then they kept asking me what it was supposed to say, and I took that to mean they were looking for it, and wanted to know what it said for reference purposes. So I tried to remember what my wife wanted it to say and rattled off a very vague and general description and waited some more. Turns out, it wasn't for reference - it was so they could go write it really fast on another cake. At that point I just wanted to get the heck out of there because it was my birthday and this wasn't looking up at all, so I just paid for the stupid thing, thanked them, and left. I opened the door to leave just as someone else was walking in, so I proceeded to walk to my car to open the trunk, placed the cake in there and hopped into the drivers seat. I checked my messages on my phone, but while I was looking down, I noticed a woman outside the front door shouting at my car, apparently. I hadn't been paying attention to anything outside my car prior to that because as far as I knew there wasn't a reason to, and I was on my phone. But as I looked up at her, she turned around to walk inside and slammed the door so hard I thought all the front windows were going to shatter. It appeared as though she was shouting at me, or my car,  but I couldn't possibly imagine why. I wasn't rude, I didn't refuse to pay, I gave no indication of any kind that I was even as angry about it as I truly was, so I cannot explain this behavior, or even really validate that it was directed towards me to be honest. But I certainly won't be returning anytime soon. Or .. ever. They really couldn't have cared less about the cake we ordered, even after the huge wedding order we placed just a few months before. A simple apology would've gone a long way, but pretending like they didn't do anything wrong and acting like I was expecting a service they didn't offer was incredibly unprofessional, and annoying. Things like that make me feel like I'm in the twilight zone or something. It was a very juvenile interaction for a business. Maybe it was just the staff that day, but what else do I have to go on?

Oh my god, the beef rib. First of all, it's the biggest rib you'll ever eat, so if you're getting some other meats, you'll really only need one rib max to share with another person. Unfortunately this also means that it has a giant bone, which is the bulk of the weight that you're paying for. But MAN, it was the most fall-apart tender rib I've ever had in my life, and ridiculously flavorful too. I would even go as far as to say that it's the best rib I've ever had. Totally worth it.\\n\\nThe brisket was also fantastic. I'd say Franklin's is still slightly more tender, but they're pretty on par in terms of flavor, and considering the dramatically shorter wait times to try it, Terry Black's brisket is absolutely better value. \\n\\nFor the sides, we opted for coleslaw, cornbread, and sweet potatoes.

The whole point of ordering online is timeliness and predictability, which were completely defeated. Lesson: don't online order. Show up and wait with everyone else if you must visit this location. Once they started to make my order, they needed to replace half of the ingredients in the line, which made making my (already late) order take much longer than it should have.

I hate playing guessing games with the waiter guy about what's on the Chinese menu but I digress. \\n\\nI just stopped by this past Wednesday for a late night dinner with Kungfu. We ordered chrysanthemum tea without sugar, pan fried noodles with beef, shrimp with xo sauce (more like HK style I don't know I thought I had ordered shrimp with xo sauce but I'm 95% sure it was just HK style), salt and pepper squid, and stir-fried snow pea tips with garlic to go for Kungfu's sister. \\n\\nTheir pan fried noodles are excellent. Lots of veggies (bok choy, carrots, black mushrooms) and good chunks of beef with gravy poured over a bed of oh so crunchy noodles. Yeah, its greasy but you gotta live a little. Definitely not a to go item, more of an item to eat in. \\n\\nHong Kong Style Shrimp was probably the highlight of the night. I was trying to order XO shrimp, but I think the waiter mistook what I said and thought HK style. HK style is dry with black bean, shredded dried pork, chunks of ground pork, and other delicious stuff I cannot ascertain 100% at this point but nothing weird, I assure you. If you do order it, make sure to pour the pork mixture on top of your rice and mix it together. So good... \\n\\nSalt and pepper squid wasn't nothing special but was better than a few other places. I would order it again. \\n\\nI always love their snow pea tips with garlic though; I think theirs is the best in town haha. \\n\\nSo definitely give their more traditional fares a try the next time you're here and do not sit by the left side of the restaurant past 10pm.

Never go to your backup choice and expect 5 starts because you know you aren't getting what you initially wanted to begin with. \\n     Anyway, I went to the Taco & Tequila festival a month or so back and remembered that they had served a taco with plantains and avocado inside and it was the best tacoid ever had in all my life. SO, I found it on the menu and ordered two of them with a Micultra equating to around $12... \\n     After I received my food I saw my tacos and I saw they had tons of white sauce poured over the top... this was not on the taco that I had gotten at the festival so I was a little shocked but I tried it anyways. Not surprised, it was mayo based and of all the foods, Mayo and aquatic things with tentacles are those that I HATE! So I was pretty upset and had to be one of those obnoxious customers that rubs off all the dressing with napkins which was such a mess. \\n     Three stars because it was way pricey for lunch, for me at least, and because it was only ok.

The menu is a two-part deal, you have to transfer your specials to the kitchen ticket with the standards.

The cake was firm, but not dense, and just sweet enough to be eaten without frosting - the Earl Grey flavor was very subtle but the crunchy tea bits sprinkled on top of the cake helped tie it together. The frosting itself was bliss - not so cream-cheesy as a dairy based confection but with the same creaminess and little zing in the aftertaste. It's nice and sweet, but doesn't taste sugary like the cheap stuff from a grocery store bakery. Everyone else agreed it was delicious (of the six people who had a slice, I was the only vegan).

When my mother and I went here for the first time, I remember telling her that I hated ribs because no one could cook them the right way. The only ribs I eat now are from Smokey Bones. The meat falls right off of the bone, and the sauce is delicious. Some of my other favorite menu items are the big cheese macaroni, loaded cheese fries, and mashed potatoes. One of my favorite drinks was the Strawberry Lemonade from the bar, but I see that they have now taken it off of the menu. Really disappointed about that!\\n\\nSmokey Bones is my favorite restaurant, so I hate to have to give them only 3 stars. \\n\\nMy problem is with their customer service. I have been double charged, told that a coupon was applied to my bill when it wasn't, and charged for things that I never received with pickup orders. For every issue that I have had, I've been told to email their customer service team feedback@smokeybones.com. I have never gotten a response to any of my emails. I have also tried writing on their Facebook wall, and I even found a phone number for them at one point. You get promised that you will receive an email back and it never happens. Sometimes I just have simple inquiries with nothing to complain about, and I still never get a response.

I literally never review anything on yelp, I mainly use it to search for places and that is about it. But this place needs this review, someone needs to say and do something about it.\\nI recently moved to a couple blocks away from the Breakfast Club and I saw the reviews and the line outside the door and decided to give it a shot. I went there on a weekeday morning, (very early in the morning, like around 6:15am) and first thing I noticed walking in was a weird smell. I decided the smell should be coming from the grill or something, maybe they were prepping something in the kitchen.\\nI chose a seat at the counter, right behind the grill, because I wanted to distract myself with the cooking process, since I was alone there. Imagine my surprise when I saw a freaking MICE running across the little table by the grill! A MICE! That was disgusting!! Freely running around as food was being prepared!\\nThen I had a sudden realization, the weird smell I felt walking in was clearly the smell of mice urine! I've felt that before on my old apartment when we had a mice problem. The whole place smelled like mice urine! A strong and pungent smell. I can only imagine that with all the cooking that goes on during the day, that smell kinda fades away to give place to the smell of bacon; that is the only acceptable explanation for why people still go there. If people could smell this, the smell of infection and disease of mice urine, they would never be back.\\nI wouldn't even dare to drink my coffee after that. I payed for it and left.\\nBe careful and mindful of where you eat guys!"},{"name":"Barcelona Wine Bar South End","address":"525 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"GREAT SERVICE\\n-------------------\\n\\nThis was my first time in the South End location! The staff here does a really great job of making you feel like a VIP guest. My friend had already arrived for our reservation, and when I walked in, the manager asked \\"Are you Sophie?\\" like they already knew I was coming. It felt great!\\n\\nHowever, the food we ordered definitely could've been improved:\\n+ CHICKEN & JAMON CROQUETAS: This was the best tapas of the night. Perfect amount of breading, perfect sized bite, and great cheese inside.\\n\\n~ ALBONDIGAS: I am usually a huge fan of their meatballs, but they had way too much tomato sauce and the meatballs tasted overcooked. We used a lot of our complimentary bread to eat with the sauce, but it was really tangy.\\n\\n- GRILLED ASPARAGUS & EGG: The asparagus and egg on top were cooked well, but I didn't think the two complemented each other. I really didn't like the breading that came with the dish. It was overly salty and just didn't go well with the asparagus or the egg.\\n\\n- PATATAS BRAVAS: I always get this dish at Barcelona because they do it right. But this time, the potato cuts were too thick, and not cooked well enough. They didn't have the crunch that they usually do, and the sauce did not complement the potatoes because the cuts were just too big.  I was super disappointed with this one.\\n\\nThe greatest of the night, I have to say, was the complimentary bread. They give you more if you ask for it, and the bread was soft and warm in the middle, but crunchy around the edges. It tasted great with the olive oil and as a dipper in the many sauces of our tapas dishes."},{"name":"Andiamo Ristorante","address":"2521 Rutland Dr, Ste 325","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Oh Andiamo, how I love your food. \\n \\nYes, it's in a strip mall and yes it's a tad small, but I wouldn't change anything about this place. My husband and I have been going to Andiamo's for years and have never had a bad experience.  Everytime I come here however, it's just me and my husband and I make a reservation well in advance, so I've never had the trouble of waiting or lackluster service other people have mentioned. \\n \\nThe wait staff and owner are wonderful. Many times that we have been here, the owner herself has stopped by and asked how we were enjoying our meal. Also- The waiters have always been very helpful in picking out a wine to go with our courses. \\n \\nNow on to the food- They serve the most amazing bread- wrapped with herbs and served with olive oil. I have to pace myself so I'll have room left for the main course! \\n \\nMy favorite dish that I've had here is the seafood ravioli. They change the ravioli often, so if you see the seafood, be sure to try it. The pasta is perfectly cooked and the creamy sauce is lovely. My husband's favorite is the osso bucco, made with venison. The meat is so tender, it just falls off the bone and loaded with flavor. Again, the dishes change from time to time, but if you call them up, they can tell you the next time the osso bucco should be available.  Another favorite is the crab-stuffed fish. Again, the sauce is creamy and delicious and the fish is cooked and seasoned to perfection. \\n\\nSome other highlights- Once, we were served a cashew soup. Holy canolli! That was the most AMAZING soup I have ever had in my life! It was a course for their New Year's Eve dinner and I'm crossing my fingers it pops up on the menu again this fall. Another stand out is the risotto. Perfection.\\n \\nWe have also had there 5-course dinner where the chef cooks up a menu for your table on the spot and it was wonderful....very, very filling, but wonderful nonetheless. \\n \\nAndiamo's is my favorite restaurant in Austin and I plan on coming again and again.

The Black's name is synonymous with delicious bbq, and this place lives up to the name. The set up is similar to the restaurant in Lockhart in that you first select your sides a la carte, and then you tell them what kind and how much delicious meat you would like. We tried the brisket and the pork ribs and they were both very good. The brisket had a great bark on it and we selected the moist cut so it was very moist and tender. You could actually cut the meat with a fork. The pork rib was also very tender and moist and delicious. I would like to have had a slight bit more smoky flavor on the ribs, but I can never get enough smoke so I'm probably in the minority. They were competition quality ribs just like they were. They had three sauces on the table, a sweet, a spicy and an original. I liked the original, the other two had a slight mustard taste to me and that's not my thing. The original complimented the meat without overpowering it. The beef and pork flavors came through nicely. Great place and a popular place, on this Saturday it was pretty packed.

They seemed overwhelmed with the line and the numbers and the whole ordeal. \\n\\nIt's a convenient spot to get a taco -- especially if you're already on that side -- but with all the great fresh off the truck food items on east Sixth, I'm hard-pressed to find a reason to seek out this particular run of the mill trailer again.

The moral of this story is are you looking for sweet or savory and that'll help you choose what to get.  Their Shrimp and grits looked good but I can't eat all that in one sitting.

I figured it must be pretty amazing for people to line up to come here. Since I hadn't ever gone inside, before today, I didn't account for there not being a lot of seating or that it takes people a considerable amount of time to eat a large bowl of noodles, and this contributes to why there's such a long wait line. We did wait approximately 30 minutes to be seated but our order was taken within just a few minutes of being seated. We got our gyoza appetizer fairly quickly, which was good but a little soggier than I typically like them made. Then our ramen came to the table within 10 minutes of finishing the appetizer. I got a large bowl and my husband got a super sized bowl. The super size is served in the same size bowl as the large but is a larger serving of noodles. We both got the spicy, one with shoyu broth and one with miso broth. Both were good but we had heard from others, while waiting in line, that the pork belly was the best part of the ramen bowl. Neither of us were impressed by the pork. It was fatty and unless you add extra, like my husband did, there's only a couple of small slices in the bowl. After removing most of the fat there wasn't much left at all. The ground meat added to the bowl for the spiciness we ordered was much better than the pork belly. The noodles were also good but not good enough to wait for a half an hour to have it again. Our original waitress disappeared before our food was served so we had some delay in getting refills on our drinks which is a bit of an issue when we ordered spicy bowls of hot soup. It's total worth giving it a try. You really can't go wrong with noodle soup so I gave it a go but I don't have any plans to make the trip over to wait in line again in the near future."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"80 Colonial Center Pkwy","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"4","text":"Happy Hour has always been a pleasant expierence, love thier shoe string fries and their burgers.

The only thing is that the chicken was kind of chewy and not cooked the best but I was fine with it since the flavor of it was so good. My dad got the Miso Salmon which I tried - also comes with rice & vegetables- and I thought this was very good as well!

The nigiri was pretty lackluster, as the shari was not well formed (some of my pieces fell apart when I picked them up), and the neta seemed somewhat neglected. The highly lauded Butter Crab roll was good, but make sure you dig in really deep into the butter to get the browned butter bits to balance the highly acidic roll. The soft shell crab dish was probably my favorite dish, however I think there should've been more crab as I don't think we even got one whole crab (or we are near the end of the season and they are getting thin?) But the accompaniments for this dish (pickled wood ear mushrooms, tomatoes) were great and a nice surprise.\\n\\nWe also had some non-seafood dishes: the ribs (which I heard were good from friends), and the karaage chicken which came out quite pale and I think needs to be brined to improve on the flavor as it was quite bland.\\n\\nEverything also had a very high price point.

I understand the concept of the \\"fusion\\" experience, but the only thing that was fused together were the noodles, that were neither Taiwanese or even reminiscent of the dan dan style.  Slightly spicy was the only taste that the noodles offered.  0 for 5 so far.\\n\\nMama Chang's pork dumplings - \\nIf this is the best Mama Chang has to offer, you're better off buying the frozen pork gyoza from Trader Joe's.  The first bite into this delightful treat filled my mouth with mush.  The texture of the pork was far too overwhelming that I don't even remember the taste.  I've had a TON of dumplings in my life and this was by far the worst.  Sent it back to the kitchen and apparently they agreed because they took it off the check.  Yep, still 0 for 5...\\n\\nGinger sesame waffle and vanilla parfait - \\nThis thing was actually pretty freaking sweet, literally.  It didn't bring anything new to the table, but that being said it was still a decent dish.  Definitely a dessert as the name suggests, but was eaten with our lunch.  1 out of 5 ain't bad.  \\n\\nCrispy salt and pepper calamari\\nRun of the mill calamari, but also cooked well and flavored simply.  Definitely met the expectations.  That bumps us up to 1.5.\\n\\nEdamame guacamole with white corn tortilla chips\\nI know what you're thinking.  O-M-G guacamole made from edamame?!  Well prepare yourself for disappointment.  This is literally just regular guacamole with edamame thrown in, not even mashed or anything, just whole beans all up in your eye.  The flavor was bland and the chips were nothing to write home about.\\n\\nHakka eggplant\\nThis could have been purchased for $3.99 at my local dirty Chinese food restaurant.   Soaked in sauce with the inherent flavor of the eggplant masked completely by the taste of salt.  \\n\\nGinger Brownie\\nThis was given to us as recompense for the mush dumplings.  The brownie itself was decent but the ginger definitely did not work with it.  Imagine a normal brownie minding its own business and then being attacked by flecks of candied ginger.  The pock marked brownie would then find it's way into your GI tract unleashing an explosion of unwanted flavor combinations.  Game over.\\n\\nShe said:\\n\\nDespite the food, I thought the service was great. They were very courteous and apologetic about the dumplings. They were attentive and saw to your dining needs.

Another Glowbal joint I like! I went twice last week, once for happy hour and once for lunch. They feature $9.95 lunch specials with a different item everyday, so I cannot wait to try it one day. A stellar price given its prime location!\\n\\nService was quick during lunch which I appreciate given the rushed timeframe. We had a server in training and were told up front; he was great and the trainer was very patient. They have an extensive wine list but I went for the safest choice - white house wine. A great pairing to my salmon, prawn and scallop lunch feature with a splattered sauce presentation. I can't recall the type of salad beneath the seafood, but it was somewhat sour and tangy presumably served with a vinaigrette sauce.\\n\\nFor the happy hour, I tried the sangria and had a beer (I believe it was Stella). They also have quite a big happy hour menu which I like. I would strongly recommend the calamari with garlic, serrano chili, cilantro, and buttermilk aioli because it is currently my favourite in Vancouver. We enjoyed it so much we ordered two! Also had the beef carpaccio which exceeded my expectations especially with the wasabi emulsion, pickled mushrooms, garlic chili sauce and green onion croutons. For our final dish, we wanted to experiment something unique to Coast so we opted for the mushroom tempura. It is hard these days to find a fellow friend who loves mushrooms as much as I do. This dish took slightly longer to prepare (but understandable) and had prawn cream cheese stuffed, arugula, onions, spicy rosé. A perfect combination and the portion definitely surprised me, as it was a portobello mushroom cut in half as opposed to small button mushrooms.

We loved the decor, the artwork, the concept, the service. Everyone was really nice. The colors were vibrant and the space was trendy. As we dwelved into the menu, we still had this look of awe at all the different types of sushi-burger fusions that they had. After lots of indecisiveness, my cousin and I shared \\"Doug's Filet Roll\\" and a Seared Tuna Salad as well as a simple philly roll. They do know how to do simple well. The philly roll was amazing! Especially with their spicy mayo. However the Doug's Filet roll was more cool-sounding than executed. It has filet mignon (cold, not warm as we expected) on top of a bagel roll basically and roe on top. I didn't like the filet mignon on it. And that's really the only thing that makes it special. So personally it wasn't a favorite. The seared ahi tuna salad was pretty good. It wasn't OMG amazing, but it was really good. I liked the ginger dressing that it came with and it had a good selection of vegetables. I wouldn't recommend sharing it, because it's not like Cheesecake Factory servings, but it was a pretty good portion if you're sharing it with a couple rolls. The tuna tastes amazing and fresh.

So you can pick from a few different bowls of ramen: spicy, deluxe, extra spicy, butter and corn....and a couple others. I've only had the spicy and the deluxe. So after you pick which bowl of ramen you want, then you get to pick the soup broth: Shiyo, Shoyu or miso. I've tried them all, personally I think they all taste great, can't go wrong with any of the choices. I personally favor the shiyo and shoyu a little more. \\n\\nThe deluxe ramen comes with a whole egg (perfectly cooked, still runny on the inside), three pieces of chashu (meat is flavored really well and so tender, it melts in your mouth), all the fix ins like seaweed, bean sprouts, etc. \\n\\nThe spicy ramen has one piece of chashu and ground pork. The broth is spicy but not too overwhelming.\\n\\nI think this is probably close to the best ramen I've ever had because the broth is flavorful, the noodles are AMAZING, and the chashu is out of this world!! \\n\\nService: \\nFriendly and welcoming. They are really nice about breaking down the menu for you if you are dining there for the first time. The ramen comes out pretty quickly too. \\n\\nAmbiance: \\nIt's attached to the Japanese supermarket so you would think the decor wouldn't be that great, but actually, it's a really cute restaurant and decorated very appropriately. Just the right amount of Japanese decor.  \\n\\nPrice: \\nThe deluxe is around $10.95 and the spicy ramen is around $9.95 (I think?) which for ramen (and such DELICIOUS bowls of ramen), I think is a super good deal!! \\n\\nOverall: \\nI HIGHLY recommend this place!

Had a crusty top with a creamy lobster type mixture underneath.  Very tasty and highly recommended.\\n\\nShrimp Escabeche - This didn't look like much but as soon as we took a bite, we glanced at each other and thought \\"Oh oh, isn't that a surprise?\\"  The peppers accentuated the shrimp very well and there was almost like a pickling flavor in the oil.  So good that we used this oil base to sop our bread with instead of the regular EVOO on our table.  Really great dish; Another winner.\\n\\nPotato Tortilla - Great starter.  Almost tastes a bit like it could be an omelet but could just be me.   The only thing that threw me off was that it was served more room temperature and I expected it to be served hot.  I'm still unsure what the correct temperature should be but it sure tasted good either way.\\n\\nPaella Mariscos - There were mixed reviews on this but we decided to bite the bullet and order it, especially after finding out that we can get a single order as opposed to a 2 person minimum advertised.  Absolutely no regrets on our decision.  Rest assured, you will like this dish and the portion, even for a single serving, is ginormous and had spoonfuls and spoonfuls of mixed seafood.  \\n\\nChurros - Light and crispy and oh-so-happy that it came with dark chocolate for dipping.

They have a nice website, their menus look professionally done, but that's kind of where the good things stopped.\\n\\nFrom the service to the food, things just did not come together.  I keep thinking maybe it is a one-off bad experience, but I don't see how it could be.  \\n\\nFirst, we tried to order a bottle of wine.  At a steakhouse and bar.  They don't offer bottles of wine.  What they do have those little 4 packs of sutter home mini-bottles that they'll charge you $8 apiece for.  In a restaurant setting, those have to be the least economical way to serve your guests.  They could get bottles (or hell, boxes) of wine and serve those by the glass for much less, and the quality wouldn't be complete garbage.\\n\\nSecond, they say that everything is made in house.  I highly doubt that the fried okra we ordered as an appetizer was cut and breaded there.  It was ok, but did definitely seem like it was poured out of a frozen bag into the fryer. The garlic bread also seemed like it was frozen and then heated up.  It was like tough, dry Texas toast.  Mine was burnt on one side.\\n\\nLet's talk about salads!  When I go to a steakhouse that has the normal 'one side and a salad' included in the price of the steak, I expect that I can order a Caesar.  3/5 people at our table did so, but what came out was iceberg lettuce with some croutons and tomatoes and a Caesar dressing cup on the side.  Not romaine, no Parm cheese, not mixed together.  Tomatoes do not go on a Caesar. \\n\\nOne bright point was that our server was very nice and was trying her hardest.  I did tip her well because of the experience as a whole, she was doing the best she could with what has to have been very little training.  One example of this is when we asked her about the wines.  She had no idea even which kinds they serve, and had to go ask the owner.  The owner was also very nice, but nothing about the staff was professional.  \\n\\nWe all ordered steaks, the majority getting the $24 ribeye.  They were out of the $21 ribeye so everyone up-ordered.  Every single one was well done and all were ordered mid rare.  Somehow, the strip that I ordered medium rare came out just seared and VERY rare on the inside.  Luckily I can handle rare steaks and enjoyed mine, but it still wasn't right and nobody else at the table enjoyed their steaks.  \\n\\nAll in all, I'm really frustrated that on my check for 2 adults and a child, we spent over $80 on a really subpar experience.  \\n\\nWe will not be going back."},{"name":"Burger King","address":"3462 Broadway","city":"Grove City","stars":"2.5","text":"I can't speak for the others who have reviewed but I live in grove city and have been here a few times through the drive thru but today I dined in.

Also the buffet was kind of lacking with variety and the only soup they had was a pumpkin soup. \\n\\nWe went in with a large group of people around 8pm and the service was pretty good. Very attentive. I asked for extra lamb or a specific type of meat and they brought it pretty quickly. Also make sure to ask for their cheese bread, probably my favorite thing there, but still not as good as the other restaurant."},{"name":"Petrone's Pizza","address":"438 Main St","city":"Melrose","stars":"3.5","text":"Can you get food poisoning from undercooked french fries?

We didn't have high expectations since it seemed to be a fairly new business - perhaps needing to work out some kinks. Boy did they blow our low expectation out of the water .. in a bad way! Our food took forever to come out. We ordered the crab cakes benedict, beet hash, a single pancake, and the nutella crepes. Crab benedict was okish. The crabcake was pretty good but the eggs were overpoached. Instead of a runny oozing egg, I got an egg that was the consistency of a hardboiled egg. I then asked for them to please cook another one for me so I could eat it with my crabcake. It came 10+ minutes later. My crabcake was cold by this time. Oh and did I mention my side (hashbrown casserole) was cold from the get go? To top it all off, I had a bug crawling around on my plate. But no one asked how my food was so ... shrug* \\nThen there was the beet hash. It had a pretty good smokey flavor to it. Sad thing is the beet was all different textures and not consistent. Some were SUPER hard and chewy while others were mushy. Each different bite you took made you want to give up on the dish more and more. It just wasn't good to have the mushy vs hard/chewy different pieces of the same type vegetable. The plate was garnished with some guacamole on top that was oxidized. Do they not make it here? Is it sitting out in the open? Who serves guacamole that has changed colors? *shrug\\nOk, so the single pancake. What could go wrong? It came out burnt the first time. We wanted to mention it to our server but he literally put it down and walked away before we could say anything. Then we tried it and it tasted burnt so we sent it back. Second time it came out? Burnt. We just ended up eating it because we were so hungry. No one was around for us to ask them to fix it anyways. How does a burnt pancake leave their kitchen twice? Does the chef here not check her/his food before it leaves his/her kitchen?? This pancake was also upcharged $1.50 for adding chocolate chips! A buck freakin' fifty!!! This is not listed on the menu nor was it mentioned to us by the waitress by the way. \\nOk so nutella crepes are always bomb so obviously that must have been the best part of our meal, right? Wrong. The crepes were teeny tiny - like a little bigger than my palm. I have small hands. They were folded in half twice. This made them like two bites worth. There were three of these for $9. They were overcooked and super rubbery. They were topped off with some sort of crumbly cereal which was super awkward and weird to eat. The \\"marinated berries\\" that came with them were disgusting. The fruit tasted like old fruit that had been frozen to keep them from going to waste. I literally buy bags of frozen fruit from Costco that tastes more fresh than their marinated berries. \\nOk, so I wish I would have been able to tell someone there that we had so so so many issues with our food and experience. I couldn't because no one was around to ask. The one guy who dropped the pancakes off basically threw the plates on our table, didn't make eye contact and left. Our waitress was too busy with her newest customers (party of 6) and didn't really ever come back around except to drop off my poached egg .. the one that came 10+ minutes after I requested it. \\nI'm still in disbelief that we got such bad food and service for the price. Our check came out to be over $40 and we both left the place still hungry. \\nThe funniest part of it all is that they weren't even busy. There were literally 15 people in the whole restaurant.

It felt like there was more bone/fat/cartilage than actual meat you would eat on the plate (presentation of dish was nice, but not what I care about). Maybe our expectations for the ribs were off, but even with what was served half of the 'food' was not what you'd expect. If you eat the ribs in the way presented (with the peppers, salsa, and guac rolled into a soft-shell taco) you're basically paying $60 for 3 tacos.

The food is great as I got four plates. They recommend 3 to four for a complete meal of small plate dining in this gastropub. My first plate was the scrambled egg blue crab, followed by the pulled pig face, the rabbit, and finally the the crispy stuffed pig ankle with foie gras. The last plate was my favorite despite all of them being delicious. Various creative flavors and ingredients worked perfectly in each dish giving it a variety of flavors. The grilled foie gras was my highlight. This is a dish I rarely eat so its always a treat to eat it. Its enticing me to go visit Montreal again and finally try Au Pied De Cochon but for right now I can get good juicy delicious foie gras at Barley Swine.\\n\\nThe staff are very friendly and helpful always asking if you need anything else and how your meal is. With each plate they explain the dish including the ingredients point at each part of the meal to let you know exactly what you are eating. The executive chef/owner does not just expedite but cleans tables and he asked me personally how my meal was. I rarely see that happen. Great customer service.\\n\\nYour paying for the taste and its not cheap. Basically you can spend 40-60 dollars per person and that does not include the price of beer or wine. The restaurant is small and cozy with only a few tables and basically six to 8 bar seats. Come early or right when it opens so you can get a spot. My meal too me an hour and when I left a woman asked for a table for a party of six Basically they will have to wait an hour and a half. The rise of small plate establishments with creative dishes is rising in Austin. Barley Swine had the reputation before I came and I understand why. Next I have to try Swift's Attic."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My girlfriend and I went here at the recommendation of our hotel concierge, and were very pleased.\\n\\nWe tried the brisket, turkey, pork ribs, beef ribs, and a few sides, and particularly enjoyed the brisket and turkey.\\n\\nYou order by weight, and it is very easy to over order, since everything looks so good!

The dining experience begins with the hostess. She/he can make or break the entire night. In our case the hostess set us off on the wrong foot. Luckily, our server and bussers did an excellent job that made up for it. Regardless, she was rude. Was making/answering the phone whilst greeting us. I've experienced better greetings from McDonald's drive throughs... Very dissapointing. To be clear I'm not asking for smiles, I'm not asking for a red carpet. Just don't be rude. \\n\\nYou're the face of the business. So, I repeat if your restaurant and your staff are unhappy about serving the dine out menu, don't participate in it. We've been to coast several times before, and tonight's experience will subscontiously reduce the likelihood that coast pops into our head the next time we're thinking about where to go. That's why service is critical, no matter how you judge the people coming in. Sure, the majority of those dine out customers will never come back. They probably don't quite fit your regular demographic, but park your prejudice at the door before you start your shift. You applied for the job, you got the job at a nice restaurant.

They have a waiting list for you to write your name on at the cashier podium, but we didn't know because it was not very apparent. Sure, they have a piece of white paper on the white wall which tells you to do so, but when there is a whole mess of people crowding around the podium and the wall, it is not very obvious (and the white on white just worsens the matter)! \\n\\nWe saw the sign that says wait here to be seated, so we stood there and waited while trying to get the attention of the staff. Took a long time for the staff to pay attention to us, which was annoying. And because we didn't sign in, all the people who came after us (~3-5 parties) got seated first, which made us feel pretty bad. \\n\\nNote to restaurant: if you're going to have a sign in waiting list, how about you put it on a music stand near the entrance, where people will see it when they walk in?\\n\\nSmh.

The fried pickles were of the wedge variety which was upsetting to some of the pickle chip supporters, but I loved them.

And no, I could not wait to eat these because I was starving. The collard greens were solid (or as solid as collard greens can be, I suppose). Fries were okay. Mac and cheese was comparable to elementary school cafeteria mac and cheese.\\n\\nOn to the chicken: the chicken itself was amazing. Some people in the group didn't like the breading that was less crispy than the fast food kind, but had a bready crunch to it. But I knew that this was the type of batter for a quality fried chicken.

The maitre d' was absolutely fantastic and we loved the entertainment of tableside meal preparation and hearing stories. I didn't have high expectations for the food going in given that the place is really dated but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the freshly made food.\\n\\nFast forward to us taking our family here for the holidays given our wonderful experience. We told them about how they make the Caesar salad fresh tableside, tell the story of the food, etc. Unfortunately this was the time that Wilfs decided to cut corners in their service and we were sorely disappointed that we had hyped up the experience so much. A few things happened: we ordered Caesar salad, and instead of it being made tableside, they brought it out premade. I asked the server about it being made tableside and he said they couldn't accommodate that over the holidays (this is advertised by them as something they do...). The pasta dish ordered by two people was missing multiple ingredients that the menu said it had. One of our first timers asked the server if he should order Steak Diane or the special, Prime Rib, and the server steered him towards the prime rib which was objectively the wrong answer (agreed by multiple people in our party). The server literally said everything is made in house including their bread, but the bread they served was definitely not homemade and was some stale commercial role (different than the homemade bread we had the first time we were there). Before our visit, the host called me on on two separate occasions for my same reservation to see if we wanted to be seated in the dining room or lounge (apparently he hadn't recorded my response when he called me the day before). All this would be very disappointing but probably worth 3 stars overall if the whole experience itself wasn't SO overpriced.\\n\\nTLDR; Wilfs is a novelty place that can be charming if you come when they are not busy. However, don't expect to be treated consistently well there or have the same level of food and service quality between visits."},{"name":"JOS","address":"1190 W Cordova St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"JOS is a comfortable neighborhood Italian restaurant in Coal Harbor, a block from the waterfront, with stunning views of the mountains. If the weather's nice, there's even patio seating available to enjoy the idyllic setting.\\n\\nThe menu is fairly limited - some salads, a charcuterie plate and handful of pizzas. Their pizzas are cooked in an imported Italian wood-fired oven.  The crusts have that slightly charred look that you would expect from being cooked in a wood-fired oven. We ordered a Margherita and a Wood Roast Mixed Mushrooms. The mushroom pizza seemed to only have one type of mushroom (so much for the mix) but was executed perfectly.\\n\\nMy Nicoise Salad, which came with seared tuna (a selling point), potatoes, eggs, green beans and butter lettuce in a vinaigrette. This simple salad offered a refreshing contrast to our pizzas. The pieces of tuna were on the small side, but the eggs made up for it. They were cooked so that yolks were still bit jammy, with some sea salt flakes sprinkled on top. Utter perfection.\\n\\nNot only was the scenery stunning out the window, but there's also a skylight above, revealing another beautiful view.\\n\\nIf we were lucky enough to live in the area, JOS would be one of our regular places to relax and appreciate the Vancouver's beauty, while getting a bite.

We ordered 2 chocolate turtles and 2 black/white chocolate fondues.  The dipping items seemed very scant to me but, I'm a hearty eater.  It seemed more child oriented though it wasn't meant to be.  There were small amounts of marshmallows (choc & regular), Rice Krispie treats, pound cake and fresh fruits (my fave)...strawberry halves, pineapple pieces and banana slices.  Three of the adults ordered a glass of Chianti but they had run out so, they settled for an \\"okay\\" Cabernet.  All in all, not that memorable.  We were the invited so did not see the bill.

The appetizer came rather quickly, and it wasn't bad at all. The mussels were nicely cooked and sauce was great. Then we waited for a long time until our main course finally came. I ordered a filet mignon, and man this is the smallest portion I've ever seen. I asked for medium-well, and this piece was way overcooked. I felt like the chef just tossed the meat in the oven and forgot about it. It was very dry, the outside was too hard (almost burned), and not tender at all. Though the mashed potato and sauce was not that bad, it definitely does not worth 30 bucks. My wife got some lamb, and though the taste was fine, she only got three tiny ribs. Again, does not worth 30 bucks. So overall the food wasn't bad, but way too overpriced and carelessly prepared.\\n\\nI have a big problem with the setup of the restaurant and its service. Supposedly it's voted the most romantic restaurant, but how can it possibly be? Tables were very close to each other, and you gotta be less than 2 feet away from the other couple.

The waiting staff all wear German clothing and musicians play traditional German instruments including the accordion. I choose the buffet. It was around 3 PM and there were no lines. Reservations can not be made. It's first come and first served. Weekends can be very crowded and a relatively small parking area forces most people to park on the street. My party of four was seated immediately and our drink order consisted of water. It came quickly with a fresh lemon slice. There were two orders of the buffet. The Buffet was $9.95, all you can eat. Three varieties of brats. I liked the Brat stew which has a BBQ style sauce and beans with a slightly spicy brat. The Bahama MaMa and another brat was also available. Sides included: sauerkraut, potato salad which was not to my liking, mac and cheese, potato soup (Great), red beets, apple sauce and a salad bar. The buffet came with a free dessert. I had the cherry cheese cake torte. A fabulously smooth creamy texture. The gigantic cream puff was the other order. Yes, it was \\"All That\\". The strudel was the final desert order.

I asked a trusted, fellow Yelper (thanks Dawn H!) of her recommendations and Terry Black's was one of them.  \\n\\nWe arrived at about 11:30am on a Saturday and no crazy line here!  Works for me.  The process here is simple, you get your drink, get a tray and some side dishes first.  You can use a plate or bowl.  You have your standard creamed corn, cole slaw, and mac and cheese.  They even have some Mexican rice.  The next station will also have some jalapeno cornbread or even some dessert.  After that, you hang a left and go choose your meat.  There are many selections such as smoked turkey, lean or moist brisket, sausage, and pork ribs.  However, the one item you HAVE TO get here is the beef rib.  This right here will be the one thing that will show you just how good Central Texas bbq is compared to anywhere else in the world.  When people eat BBQ anywhere else and someone says Texas BBQ is so much better, this is the reason why.  The beef was so unbelievably tender and literally, was almost like butter.

This would be a great place for dates or small groups of close friends to relax and enjoy. The staff put me at ease and were not over-doing the service. From cocktail (The Old Pal) to cheese plate (Rosemary Manchego) to entree (Crispy Braised Pork Shank) with a great tempranillo and dessert (Bread Pudding) every plate was perfectly prepared, timed and artistically presented. Alqueria has the perfect sized menu; just one sheet. The wine list has a lot of great Spanish wines on it. John, the very skilled server, referred to his notebook about a couple of wines I was considering. Tastes were provided. A decision made with ease.

Some places, the corns are overwhelmingly sweet but Terry Black's was perfect. \\n\\nAfter the sides, you move on to get the meat. I got two slices of beef brisket and a pork rib. The beef briskets were the best Ive ever had. Coming from Houston, I've had briskets at other Texan bbq places and honestly Terry Black had the juiciest, moist, tasty briskets ever. Next time I go back, I will just get the briskets.

It came with an eggplant parm appetizer which was two pretty decent sized circles of crispy breaded eggplant!  That may have been a promotion though as I also got a dessert!\\n\\nOthers ordered the filet \\"Pittsburgh\\" style and blue in the center.  I've never ordered it that way, but apparently they did it right!  I got to try a piece (when they turned their head) and it had a beautiful char and a very rare interior.

Was kinda disappointed.\\n\\nParked with valet parking, walked in and got seated right away. You can kinda smell a fresh seafood smell at the front, I'm thinking because of the display of fish they have? Our server came and introduced herself and the menu. I heard Kyma has an old school vibe and I definitely felt it, as well as seeing the other diners were all north of their 40's or with family. I don't know if I was being too sensitive but our server seemed kinda dismissive of us and a little judgmental when we said we didn't want drinks. There was nothing specific but it was definitely a little colder experience than other similar old school establishments we've been to. \\n\\nGot the tasting menu for $52 a person. Table started with some bread and olive oil. It was ok, bread was not warm and a little hard but still tasted pretty good. There were walnuts in it so my bf couldn't have any. Started with four spreads and fresh pita. These were pretty good! There was an eggplant one that was my favorite, again my boyfriend could not have any because there are walnuts in it. There was a red pepper one, also very good, and two others which I did not like as much, a yogurt and a potato one. The pita was fresh and hot which was great. \\n\\nThe guy who brought us our food was actually very friendly and I'm glad we saw a lot more of him than our server. She also forgot what we had already had at one point and came to confirm with us. Additionally, when she came to clear the crumbs off our table she just swept them directly onto the floor which seemed kind of haphazard. Especially since right afterwards she cleaned off the table of an older couple behind us and swept the crumbs into her hands. This wasn't a big deal but the little things stand out in what should be fine dining. \\n\\nAfter spreads was our four appetizers, brought out one at a time. We got the octopus, obvs, the spicy lamb pie, the calamari 'pasta', and the scallops. Just putting this here, if you do not like capers do not come here!! Boy were there a lot of capers, capers in basically every dish. They were good capers, there were just a lot of them. The octopus is so highly reviewed but I actually was not impressed. Yes it was tender, which can be hard to find, but our octopus was slightly burnt and had a bitter aftertaste as a result. The flavor, if you ignore this, was average. I have had much better octopus in asian restaurants many times. I feel like this is amazing to people who have only ever had fried calamari or one tough piece of octopus in an appetizer and can't deal with meat that isn't completely tenderized. The lamb pie was pretty good but nothing special, phyllo dough wrapped around ground lamb. I couldn't really tell that it was lamb, vs beef? It didn't have that distinctive lamb flavor anymore after all the spices. The calamari was alright, a little acidic? The scallops were great, get the scallops! \\n\\nFor our main course of whole fish we chose the sea bream. It was ok. Overcooked, not much flavour. The whole point of a whole fish is that it should be fresh, you should be able to taste that it died that day but I couldn't really tell this apart from a fillet tastewise. My boyfriend and I also found a few bones? It's not hard to debone a sea fish, they have an exact number of bones you count out when you pluck them out. This just shows carelessness or laziness on the part of the chef who prepared it. Once again, I have had much better fish in chinese restaurants and at home. \\n\\nAnother little thing is the women's bathrooms are quite cramped. When I opened the stall door it opens inward and actually scraped against the bowl. This made getting out again a little difficult because I had to literally squeeze myself between the wall and the bowl to let the door open. The restaurant itself is also a little cramped and makes getting in and out a challenge when it is full. If they could take away a table or two I think it would make things a lot easier for diners and servers. I understand it was a very busy weekend though so maybe it's usually not a problem. \\n\\nWe were pretty full at the end of the meal but felt that it was a little lackluster. I would not recommend just getting one fish and sharing it if you come since the normal selection are a little small. I would say this is a good one time experience just to try it out but I would not come again. Everything was just a little off, perhaps I came in with expectations that were too high."},{"name":"Fresh Start Cafe and Bakery","address":"24 N Sandusky St","city":"Delaware","stars":"4.5","text":"YUM YUM YUMMMM!!!!!  \\n\\nMe and my Family were looking for a tree farm to get a Christmas Tree.

The line can get backed up. After ordering you grab your number and proceed to find a place to sit. Good luck! On busy days it is packed! For a big group, it can be hard to get seats together because some of the tables are different and you have to push them together. \\n\\n(5/5): WHAT THE CLUCK: A chicken and waffle sandwich with a sunny side egg and most amazing sriracha mayo. This a knife and fork meal. I noticed that the fry on the chicken is a little darker than I'm used to but it didn't taste burnt or anything. It might be the spices they add to the breading. The waffle was fluffy but also dense. This will make you full! \\n(5/5): VIVA MATCHA LATTE: Cute latte art. The matcha flavor was strong but it still had a good sweetest. The cup must have been deep because I had so much of my drink left. I asked for a to-go cup with ice and added my cold latte to it. Best of both worlds. I got a hot latte and an iced one.\\n\\nMight not be the best place to study just because it can get so loud. The aesthetics of this place is top notch.

They also serve smoothies, which looked pretty popular and tasty, although I did not have a chance to taste any of these when I visited. I also tried the el pastor and fajita steak-- these were a smidge smaller than the breakfast tacos were equally delicious.

There is no bread, but in our party of five, everyone's meals came out very quickly. Didn't seem like we were waiting for long at all. \\nMenu is not huge. It is composed of typical American fare, burgers, soups, salads, sandwiches, etc. The burger deal for Monday's is fantastic, where burgers are only $5 (or something around that). \\nAnd both the burgers and onion rings were filling and flavorful. \\nI have no problems with this restaurant and would do nothing but suggest it to others.

The korma was also really good in the cream sauce with cashew nuts. However, the Channa Saagwala was  very disappointing as it was bland and not really spicy even though we ordered medium spicy. Besides the food, the ambiance in this place is great and they have Bollywood music and shows playing in the background if you're into that. \\n\\nHowever, I give it 3 stars due to the service. For some reason, the waiters kept asking us over and over again (we counted at least 7 times) how the food was and that totally disrupted the flow of our conversation. We were definitely not there as long as some of the other customers and it just became annoying after a while.

They had a bit of a problem finding my name but thats OK; it gave us a reason to hang out at the bar. And this is where I found my new favorite drink!!! I forgot the name of it but it's \\"summer\\" something and it was absolutely refreshing and delicious that I had 2 and now I can't remember it to save my life. \\n\\nThe ambiance here is very warm and welcoming with a beautiful patio dining room with soft fairy lights and a water fall as the backdrop. It's absolutely stunning and thank goodness it didn't fall into the pretentious Buckhead scene. I appreciate that it's just a hidden gem with its own personality. \\n\\nWe ordered:\\n\\nCrispy Brussel Sprouts - Who knew vegetables can taste so good? They were crispy and taste nothing like it's good for you :) It also comes with an aioli dipping sauce but because it's nicely seasoned, I don't think the sauce was needed. \\n\\nBistro Mussels - One of our favorite dish of the night! It was extremely fresh and delicious and I remember sopping up the sauce with the sour dough crostini because it was that good. Great choice in bread so that it can withstand the white wine garlicky sauce. I highly recommend it. \\n\\nCrab Cake - The seasoning was fine but I thought it was too much bread in it for me. I couldn't really taste the crab as much. Not our favorite but it wasn't the worse crab cakes. \\n\\nGrilled Sea Bass - This was heavenly on a plate. I normally don't order fish when I go out just because it can be over cooked and too fishy that it'll ruin my palate. But this dish was superb that I would order it again. The grilled sea bass was cooked perfectly so it was nice, flaky and buttery with every bite. I absolutely love puttanesca sauce so it gave it that burst in flavor. \\n\\nDeconstructed Lobster Ravioli - This was one of my girlfriend's dish and thankfully she shared a bite with us for taste. This was a winner dish. There are real lobster in almost every bite you take so you know you're not cheated out of it. The sauce wasn't overwhelming and the pasta was cooked perfectly. Great flavor to this dish that makes every bite better and better in your mouth. \\n\\nBread Pudding - OMG the reviews were not kidding when they mentioned about their bread pudding. Just WOW. It was so good. Nice and creamy with perfect pudding texture and not soggy. You must have a bite if you're here!\\n\\nWe had such a wonderful time here and I can't wait to go back. You can actually have a good conversation among your group without having to raise your voice. It's a perfect place for lunch or dinner for a weeknight or night out for the weekend. It's also very casual so you don't feel like you have to dress to the T to dine here. \\n\\nI can't say enough good things about this place so you just have to come see it for yourself."},{"name":"Hardee's","address":"400 Welcome Center Dr","city":"Deltona","stars":"3.5","text":"I love the food at Hardee's.  They have great thick burgers and chicken.  We used to have to drive to Sanford or wait until I was working close to the Sanford location to get Hardee's.  Now we have a new location right here in Deltona and only a few minutes from my house.  I have been through the drive thru about half a dozen times, dined inside several times and got carry out from the counter at least  a dozen times.  My wife loves the thick burgers and onion rings.

Some of the cashiers are new and just learning about customer service but they have all been polite and friendly so far!   The restaurant and grounds have always been clean and inviting.

On one occasion, the onion rings we got in the drive thru were not hot when we got home but overall I think they are doing great!"},{"name":"Babette's Cafe","address":"573 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"First off, this place is definitely geared more towards the middle aged crowd. I think my boyfriend and I were the only ones dining who were under thirty. \\n\\nI wanted to visit this place because 1. I love French food, 2. there was a coupon on Scoutmob, and 3. I'm still in search for the perfect lamb dish in Atlanta. \\n\\nWe were seated outside because we didn't have reservations but I blame this to the both of us wearing flip flops. It was hot and Kungfu decided to wear shorts and my feet were tired so I switched out to flip flops. Probably not a great idea when going to a French restaurant that isn't a bistro. \\n\\nThe patio overlooks a parking lot, and you can see the valet guy busily running around to park cars and such, so not the greatest view. \\n\\nWe rummaged through the wine menu as we're both big wine drinkers. I didn't find anything I really liked. I sampled about four different whites and I didn't like any of them. It was either too tart, or a weird after-taste that I couldn't put my finger on except I thought it tasted a bit metallic, or too bland. We settled on ordered two aperitifs, two before-dinner cocktails: the Pim's Cup and limoncello spritzer. \\n\\nI can't say anything about the Pim's as I didn't try it. The limoncello spritzer however, I thought I'd never say this about limoncello but I would've appreciated some simple syrup in the drink. The club soda overpowered the limoncello completely and made the overall drink taste like Perrier with a dash of limoncello. For the Perrier drinkers, this might be good news, but I'm just not fond of sparkling mineral water. Maybe I'm just a rube in matters of cocktails (and isn't limoncello usually for after-dinner anyway?), or I should've expected this outcome as I don't drink spritzers normally, but I just expected something more I guess? It had this weird herb-like after-taste as well. I couldn't put my finger on it, but it bothered me immensely. \\n\\nFor appetizers, I ordered warm roasted cauliflower, bacon, and arugula with lemon, walnut vinaigrette, capers and gruyere and Kungfu ordered a romaine and arugula salad with shaved asiago and lemon thyme dressing. \\n\\nThe cauliflower was alright, I got some cauliflowers that were completely charred, but the rest was ok. I wish there were more morsels of bacon; I think I got a total of three chunks. I wanted this dish to be executed like how I thought in my head: savory and salty from bacon, fresh citrus flavor with a peppery taste of arugula, a bit of brine from the capers, sweet and salty from the gruyere, nutty cauliflower that had been slightly roasted, and I didn't know what to expect from the walnut vinaigrette except I just had a flash of thought in my head that said \\"interesting.\\" I would have to say the dish didn't come together as one flavor profile. They all just stood alone without intermingling with one another. I was a tad disappointed. \\n\\nThe romaine and arugula salad was good, except Kungfu wished for more dressing, and the man usually wants less dressing. \\n\\nOnto the main course, Kungfu ordered sea scallops provencale with nicoise olives, tomatoes, haricots verts, with parslied new potatoes, and I ordered the Colorado lamb chops grilled, with a fresh herb crust, red wine reduction and shoe string potatoes. \\n\\nThe sea scallops were good, I liked how they weren't overcooked or undercooked. I wish the outside had been seared a bit more, the provencale was on queue, and the vegetables were alright. \\n\\nThe lamb wasn't too gamey and I loved that it was peppered with herbs, but the T-bone in the lamb made it extremely difficult to cut on top of the patio table. The red wine reduction tasted a bit burnt but I could attribute that to some of the burnt herb crust on the lamb. The shoestring potatoes though, I felt like it didn't complement the dish very well. They were more of a pain in my backside trying to eat them as they shuffled off my fork, slowly. I also got a bit of haricots verts, which I appreciated. I think they were just boiled in water though, I'm used to them being cooked in a broth (beef consomme or vegetable broth), or cooked with garlic. They were just, plain old haricots verts hanging out next to my herb crusted lamb chops. I wish they had done a bit more with the haricots verts. \\n\\nWe declined on the dessert as I was getting eaten alive by mosquitoes by the end of dinner. When I got home, I surveyed 10 mosquito bites just on my ankles. I was scratching myself incessantly and I couldn't wait to get into my car. \\n\\nOverall, it wasn't mind-blowing, it was just okay. I don't know if I'd come back here for French as I didn't see much on the menu that was French. I understand the food has more of a European flair, but nothing felt really special or delicious. I don't know if I'll be coming back any time soon."},{"name":"The Waterfront","address":"4201 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great place for brunch if you want to get out of the downtown area and experience a \\"beach vibe.\\"\\n\\nGreat food with lots of options, and drinks were fairly priced and cheap. \\n\\nI got the Frose as a drink, which was perfect during the hot summer day"},{"name":"Babica Hen Cafe","address":"15964 Boones Ferry Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"I come here often and always have such a nice time.

It tasted like Simply juice. I asked if I grabbed the juice from the wrong tray. They said the juice is fresh squeezed at the company they purchase it from, and the company bottles the juice and ships it to their store. If they add sugar, bottle and pasteurize the juice, it's not considered fresh squeezed. The label on the bottle probably says Simply Grapefruit, which they also sell.

It still remains fairly warm during the summer, so beware of that if you're looking to cool down. \\n\\nSERVICE: I read some reviews about having poor service. I personally did not find this an issue. This place seems to be family run. When I order over the phone, they are usually short and to the point. They definitely are not overly friendly, but it is a fast paced joint and their main focus seems to be on the food. Also, English is not their first language, so there is not a lot of small talk other than taking your order. They do not have a wait staff, so you order up front and pay first. I am such a frequent customer that they are decently friendly to me. If I smile at them, they smile back, otherwise it is just business.

My friend and I were meeting up for dinner and since we both live in the area, I recommended we go to the Battery since they have shoppes and dining. The plan was to eat at Antico which I've been dying to go to but she changed her mind about pizza so we walked around to check out the other restaurants' menus and agreed on Yard House. I'm not crazy about Yard House which might be why I've never reviewed this place but I do like that they have something for everyone; similar to Cheesecake Factory. So we came around 7pm on a Friday with not a long wait either. We were told 30 minutes and got seated in 15 minutes. And during those 15 minutes, one of the hostesses was kind enough to offer soft drinks while we waited too. \\n\\nThe menu has literally every cuisine to satisfy your tastebuds from Asian, Italian or American which makes it a good spot to big parties. Our waiter came over to take orders and gave us recommendations based on the most popular dishes for entrees and apps since we had a hard time deciding. We decided on the Moo Shu egg rolls and Lobster & Crab Dip. For entrees, we both got the small size of Spicy Jambalaya with Linguini in which you can choose jasmine rice or brown rice instead of pasta. It took a while for us to get our appetizers too like a good 30 minutes and about 2 minutes later, as we were about to dig in, our entrees came. Like for real! It definitely seemed like our waiter ordered it all at the same time so the food runner took them back and said they'll make them again when we're ready. The waiter had no idea what happened and totally blamed the kitchen *side eye*, but the food girl handled it pretty well. The waiter checked in on us periodically to see if we had finished eating the apps then went ahead and placed the orders for the Jambalayas. They came in about 20 minutes. \\n\\nOn a scale of 1-5 for spice, I'd give it a 2. And the waiter told us we'd be getting 3 pieces of jumbo shrimp. No sir. Those pieces were regular schmeg-gu-lar. The dish was still good though. And the serving size is perfect too; Similar to a lunch serving. The next time I come in, I'm definitely coming in before 6pm to take advantage of the half off apps.

However, the staff at this restaurant was incredibly rude to my boyfriend and I when we went there tonight for my birthday that I feel compelled to write my first yelp review.\\n\\nI put in a reservation online for 8:30pm through Open Table, almost 2 hours beforehand.  While it was a long wait, this was a special night and the experience I imagined getting at this restaurant would be worth it.  We showed up on time for our reservation only to be told that our table wasn't ready and that it would probably be more around 9:00pm or later until we could be seated.  I asked if they had any seats open at the bar, which they didn't but said there was a now a new table available.  I said we'd take it, since we were both very hungry at this point.\\n\\nThe place they sat us was against the wall connected to an emergency exit and had extra chairs, children's highchairs and slings stored around the table, and was much darker than the already dimly-lit-for-mood room.  I noticed a table was clean and unoccupied right across from us in a much more pleasant area and asked our hostess if she wouldn't mind moving us.  She told me that that table was reserved for a party at 8:45pm, which was 15 minutes after our reservation.  I asked if they had specifically requested that table and she said no, but they assign tables per reservation and that the table we had been \\"assigned to\\" originally was still occupied by a couple celebrating their anniversary.  Still confused, I politely asked if we could move over there since the table they had originally set aside for us wasn't ready yet and we had an earlier reservation that the intended occupants.  She huffily explained that each table is assigned per reservation and that's how they do it here and then rudely asked \\"Do you understand now?\\"  I was so taken aback that I didn't even know how to respond, I have never been spoken to so rudely in a restaurant.  My boyfriend was so offended by how she spoke to me that we both agreed to leave and try to turn my birthday night around at a better, more professional establishment. I have never left a restaurant after being seated before, but I did't feel like giving our business to this restaurant when the hostess may as well have spat in my face with her sharp, condescending tones.\\n\\nI will never be coming back to this location.

This is something I only somewhat understand because its JUST FRIED CHICKEN. I could make it at home from scratch in that amount of time. That's beside the point. So I place my order and think its a little silly that I have to pay $0.50/side to substitute the sides of beans and coleslaw with something else. However, I asked that both meals that I ordered substitute the beans with macaroni and cheese. My receipt shows this, but they only got one of the substitutions. Unfortunately, (and I should know better) I didn't check the sides before I left. The thing about the sides is that they aren't anything special. My husband called them \\"bland.\\" I personally thought the coleslaw and macaroni and cheese were \\"okay.\\" I don't like beans so I can't really help you there. Since I did have to wait the 30 minutes on my take-out, I just watched the staff from the designated waiting area. It seemed to me (the observer) that the staff was somewhat disorganized. I saw cashiers going back and forth between the front and the kitchen. It seems like just anyone could put together the meals and that it wasn't necessarily designated to one person. Also, they took my name and said they would call me whenever my order was ready. I saw 3-4 take-out orders ahead of mine and I never heard a name called. Maybe there is some rhyme or reason to their process, but to me it didn't look like there was a process.

Easily best fries around!\\n\\nThe reason I'm unhappy with them this time around is two-fold.  1.  Asked for BBQ souse on the burger AND on the side.  Get the side of souse and it's the tiniest amount imaginable -- maybe an 8th of a container.  Basically, what is usually left at the end of a meal.  Now, I'm not asking them to use critical thinking or anything but if someone wants bbq souse on and on the side, it probably means they really like the souse, no?  Either way, you can't be giving people that little souse, that's just stupid and waste of time for me to go ask for more.\\n\\nThe second reason is I ordered a bacon burger which came with, wait for it, no bacon...  I had two bites left and was like, didn't I order a bacon burger??  Checked the receipt, says {bacon}, ask my friends (who also got the bacon burgers) and one said, I think I have it, the other said he saw a couple of bits.  I'm like, is this a joke??  No bacon or bacon bits??  I don't even know which one is worse.  They're pretty good with putting all the toppings on that I rifled through when ordering.  Was I supposed to ask for bacon on my bacon burger??  Most likely, it's the bacon bits scenario which really pisses me off.

We asked for more bread and the waiter took our dirty dish out from under us while we were still eating on it, disappeared for 5 - 10 minutes than came back with THE SAME DIRTY PLATE. I have never been so upset in my entire life, this waiter was told within the first 2 minutes that I have OCD and did not want him to bring a lemon in my tea since 70% of all ecol i out breaks at eateries are from the lemons. Yet he still put the lemon in my drink and brought us back a dirty plate not even knowing if it was ours at first until we had to ask him! The salad was slimy and coloring to no longer be green, also it was a pecan and apple salad that tasted distinctly of mint so strong that it wasn't really edible. There was no manager on site that could be seen, nor offered when complained about, and the server did not bother to take anything off or even apologize.

The explanation from the establishment didn't really make sense that there was two checks (and the waiter got it confused? who knows). The true frustration comes from the fact that instead of reversing $20 back to the card they are asking for him to come there to pick up the money.

The server came over and wiped down the table when she saw us sitting with our menus in the air. We ordered our drinks (a beer and an Ultimate margarita) and an appetizer (the queso which was fine). My husband and I both ordered shrimp fajitas and we both asked for guacamole. One person brought us the fajita plates (rice, beans, cheese, sour cream, salsa and lettuce). Mine had guac, his did not. Another person brought the actual fajitas and asked if we needed anything else. I had to ask for the flour tortillas. $20 for each entree (10 small shrimp, 3 flour tortillas and very little toppings) was not worth the money.

Song La's braised pork is now on-par with what I make at home, and tastes just as delicious. I am impressed, and highly recommend their braised pork over rice."},{"name":"Virgils Gullah Kitchen & Bar","address":"3721 Main St","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"Another gem on Main St in College Park.

I absolutely believe in all of the rules that were set in place, however, I did not act like an \\"entitled dick\\" when they ran out, I just had some general questions. I was beyond polite, and patient with the employee mentioned below, until I could accept no more of the ill behavior. Secondly, I would like to say that this place should only exist because of their Oatmeal Pale Ale [undeniably delicious].  They should probably just give up the fallacy that they have the ability to serve good food and/or provide even minimal customer service.  My experience during Burger Week was absolutely inexcusable.  I understand that it is stressful to deal with mass crowds, invading your restaurant.  However, it gives you no right to treat patrons with disdain. \\n\\nAllow me paint the scenario for you:\\n\\nI arrive to a huge line reaching out the front door, in which I reluctantly jump into.  About half way through, a lady, who appeared nice enough, came by and offered me a ticket. Naturally, I asked what the ticket was for.  Her reply was nothing.  Dead eyes peering directly into mine. Since I did not turn to stone, I proceeded with questions.  I wanted to know the purpose for the lengthy queue I was in, so I asked \\"What's the beer situation?\\"  Her reply, \\"The beer situation is good\\", as she walked on.  After waiting about 20 minutes to figure out why I was in line, I'm surprised to see the same lovely peach manning the cash register.  But that doesn't stop me, with my barrage of insanely 'benign' inquiries, no sirree. \\n\\nJust as I'm about to step up to the front of the line, they post a sign that says, \\"Sorry, we are sold out of burgers for the day\\"\\n\\nMe: \\"So, does the ticket you gave me mean I can still get a burger even though the sign says 'Sold Out'?\\"\\n\\nA-hole: \\"Well, that's what I gave it to you for\\", rolling her eyes so hard, she cried blood.\\n\\nMe: \\"I am sorry, but I tried to ask you while in line, but got no response\\".\\n\\nA-hole:  Rudely over-talking and cutting me off, \\"What do you want, I've had a long day. The first rule of Burger Week is 'don't be a dick'\\".  \\n\\nMe:  Maybe you should observe the rule yourself.  \\n\\nA-hole: Pushes money back across the counter and says, \\"you can have this back, you get nothing\\", then yells \\"CAN I HELP YOU\\" to the unsuspecting, next victim behind me.\\n\\nMe:  I want to speak with your manager.\\n\\nA-hole: With a smug look, \\"I am the manager\\".\\n\\nMe:  \\"YOU'RE THE MANAGER?!?! ... wow.  Just wow\\".\\n\\nA-hole:  More yelling, \\"NEXT\\".\\n\\nMe: \\"fuck off\\"\\n\\nA-hole:  Tattletales to her poor poor employees who obviously hate her as much as I do, \\"see the guy in the glasses?  He told me to fuck off.  Have him removed\\"  Offered no other details regarding the situation. \\n\\nMe: I go and sit with friends in the dining room as they finish their beer.  No one approaches me.  I then, promptly remove myself from this horrid, abusive, hell hole, vowing never to return and spread the word to as many people as possible.  Incidentally, the first person I told the story to, said, \\"I went in there once and sat at the bar.  The bartender acknowledged me, then went to the other side of the bar to socialize, and never came back. Sat there for 15 minutes before leaving, without anyone noticing\\".\\n\\nAdditionally, I have eaten here a few times, leaving feeling disappointed with the quality and the price of my meal.

While I could have read the on-line menu closer, I could have saved myself a lot of research time. But, I did have fun spending about 1/2 hour researching the menu vocabulary and learning about the Ethiopian culture.\\n\\nFor appetizers, my friend and I shared Sambusa, and Tomato Fitfit. The closest description I can come to for Sambusa is that they kind of looked like eggrolls, but were very different. We opted for the beef and the delectable seasoning went well the the sweet/hot dipping sauce, as they were nestled in their nicely fried crisp wrappers. Tomato Fitfit was a wonderful cold salad of tomatoes, vegetables and their injera bread. Injera is a soft, airy sourdough bread make from teff, a fine grain from the region.\\n\\nIndependently, we both selected Tibs for dinner.Tibs is (are?) dice size cubed meat seasoned in their own special spice mix with vegetables. Scanning down the menu, I saw you can get a meat lovers variety with three meats. It said it was enough to feed two people, but three could easily have dined. What was really great about this was that each of the meats we tried (lamb, chicken, and shrimp) had their own unique seasoning blend. It was served with injera, and we finally got to enjoy this pancake like, fluffy sourdough bread on its own. We even experimented in eating in the traditional method, which is to use the bread to pick up your food, shunning silverware. (They provided silverware anyway,)\\n\\nOne of the dishes we tried was a potato/beet salad. It was moderately spiced was smooth in texture and had a great flavor.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the miser, which is a nicely spiced lentil dish.\\n\\nDue to the research and curiosity, I had to try kocho. Too full to eat it there, I brought it home for my family to try as it is special Kocho is made from the enset plant. Enset is a food staple in Ethiopia. It is in the banana famliy, and each root ball, after 4 years of growth can provide 40# of nutrition. Kocho is made from the fermented scrapings of the stem, yeast, the leaves, It is put in a pit for well over a month. It had a cheesy aroma and taste to it.

It was one that hangs off of the wall by a large angle bracket and appears to have been neglected for some time. It sloped down towards the edge like the support was coming off of the wall. Not really that much of an issue other than our drinks would have slid of had we not put them on a napkin. We got the pretzel bites with beer cheese sauce, a cowboy ranch tavern double and a pig out tavern double and a side of mac n' cheese. Our burgers were pretty much the same aside from one having french fried onions and bbq sauce and the other having bacon. They tasted about as good as a p.terry burger so absolutely not bad but I'm not sure they're worth the extra cost. The pretzel bites came served on a plate with no liner which was odd because they were extremely greasy and had a large pool of unappetizing oil underneath them.

Once seated, we were greeted very quickly for drinks and handed menus. \\n\\nGot water and one hot coffee ( refillable ) which tasted great and better than expected for diner coffee. Both got the Basket Case: Comes with toast, eggs, home fries, bacon or sausage or ham, and a side of either french toast or pancakes. \\n\\nEggs were perfectly over easy, toast was slathered with all the butter you want and more, home fries surprisingly tasty, bacon was so crisp and tasted almost caramelized, sausage was standard breakfast sausage flavor but actually quite tasty. French toast were some of the best I've had in awhile, perfectly seared and crispy outside with a lovely soft interior. Loved also the cinnamon shake on top and how they brought individual syrup containers with WARM syrup. (Pet peeve is adding cold syrup sitting on the table to my hot pancakes or french toast)\\n\\nOverall, I had a great breakfast experience here and will most definitely come back again.

I didn't have a chance to validate that claim but I did swap my beans for greens. In general, I believe it's pretty hard to mess up greens, but that might be because I haven't had enough in my life. I'll work on changing that. The slaw was pretty good too, it offered a cooling counterpoint to the spice in the chicken. Another person at our table said it reminded them of Long John Silver's slaw - which was apparently a  positive and he noted he'd be hitting up the old school fast food joint later that week. I don't hate on LJS, I just haven't eaten it in years!\\nTo add to my fat girl lunch, I also shared a small side of mac and cheese. Good noodle consistency, maybe a tad dry though. \\n\\nI also added a chicken tender to my plate, which I found to be dry and lacking compared to bone in fried chicken. Bone in vs boneless?

I have been patronizing this business consistently for the past year and up to 2-3 times per week during my \\"honeymoon phase\\" with this establishment. However due to willful lack of care and inconsistency in their product, I am forced to take a hiatus from this place.\\n\\nEvery time I visit this place I feel just short of robbed and last night's visit was the final straw for me. Stopped by here with a friend who has never been here before and was excited to introduce him to delicious (raw) vegan food. The place was about as busy as it usually is when we arrived and the wait to give my order was about 15 minutes. I ordered two \\"full-size\\" South of the Border wraps and my friend ordered a \\"half-size\\" Punany wrap. So the guy begins making my \\"full-size\\" wraps in front of me (Subway/Chipotle style) and then hands it over to the second guy who finishes the wrap with the remaining fresh toppings. I noticed immediately that my friend's \\"HALF-size\\" wrap was almost identical in size to my two \\"FULL-size\\" wraps. My internal mood immediately went sour. This is NOT acceptable. Since this was my friend's first time here I did not want to cause a disruption calling out this major discrepancy.\\n\\nMy friend and I pay for our orders at the cash register and my total is over forty dollars and his total is approximately eleven dollars. Unbelievable.\\n\\nWhen I purchase a \\"full-size\\" wrap for nearly double the cost of a \\"half-size\\" wrap then I expect my \\"full-size\\" wrap to be close to double the size of a \\"half-size\\" wrap.

Black business or not, I support those who support and do good by me. Get your act together and train your employees properly or adjust your poor pricing structure. Contrary to mainstream ignorant beliefs, healthy nutritious food doesn't cost more. Stop abusing people's wallets.

I went on a Friday (8/23) at noon, waited in line about 20 mins. The line was moving quick since they have the flow down to a science. You can start out with a craft brew right by the entrance, then you work your way to the sides. I couldn't decide between the mac and the corn, so what the hell I got them  both. Then for the main course- the brisket. I got a 1/2 pound of the moist (fatty) sliced which equates to basically two thick slices. I think they threw a burnt end in after it was weighed. Maybe because I was already wearing a Terry Black's hat that I just bought on the way in. haha.\\n\\nSo the real deal- The fatty brisket would basically melt in your hands. So freaking delicious. And the flavor of the burnt ends, out of this world. I was thinking to myself as I was eating- brisket simply cannot get any better than what I was eating. I just could not imagine how it could be any better and I'm not even joking. The mac was great and the cream corn as well, but the brisket is king. The sweet tea was also on point- a must for a legit BBQ place.\\n\\nSo the next morning as I was planning my day, I thought should I attempt to stand in line at Franklin's (which is on my bucket list and Aaron Franklin is my culinary role model). I decided that I just could not spare 4+ hrs for the experience. I was looking at some other hot spots on Yelp and then said F-it, why not just go back to Terry Black's. But would there be a ridiculous line at noon on a Saturday. Nope- the well oiled machine of the TB's line got me to the BBQ counter in like 20 mins.

You get items you'd like cafeteria style and they calculate the cost based on weight, pretty much. I had the cream corn and potato salad, both of which were AMAZING. I also ordered the brisket and sausage and was blown away by the tender, flavorful meat. My mouth is watering thinking about it! The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable as well. I wish I could go back right now!

I went for lunch, and I ordered a FULL salad and FULL bowl of soup. I left feeling like I needed to go to another restaurant so that I could have some lunch. I'm not joking, that salad is the biggest joke ever. Like lettuce really costs that much money? I mean, okay, fine, don't put a ton of the other stuff in there, but at least make me THINK that I'm getting a normal-sized salad for that price. Seriously? Please go to North and check out their salads... THAT'S what a salad is supposed to be like. Then I also ordered the soup, and while it was good, it wasn't really worth the amount of money I had to spend on it. It was in one of those large bowls that is super flat, so it looks big, but it's like 1cm deep. No joke. And I hate it when places use those types of bowls because there is so much surface area touching the air that my soup is cold in like 3 seconds flat. I really would only give this place one star if the food wasn't good. But regardless, when I'm looking for an Italian-like meal, I'll be heading to North, or Reale's. \\n\\nOh, I forgot, half of that second star is for the bread.

It probably took us 20-30 min to get a table, one of the outdoor ones outside the restaurant. We shared a big bowl of garlic fries, which were nice and crispy. I ordered the veggie burger. They ran out of some items that my friends wanted to order, so keep in mind this is possibility; I always hope that this is an indicator that the restaurant uses fresh ingredients. The veggie burger tasted very healthy. The bun especially was heavily seeded and hearty, and the patty was almost a similar grainy texture. It was on the crumbly side, but it is difficult to make a veggie burger with as much structural integrity as a meat one. I wouldn't classify it as a must-eat when in Austin as the region is very meat-centric and there are lots of other more special places to try, but it's a decent restaurant."},{"name":"The Crepevine","address":"249 W State Rd 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Friendly staff and crepes were very good.

I was told that the restaurant did, indeed, allows dogs outside, as long as your were seated at a table adjacent to the outer separator for the restaurant from the street. She noted my dog as part of the reservation and told me we might have to wait a little bit when we checked in for our reservation for an appropriate table to open up.\\n\\nWhen we arrived for our reservation, the hostess checked us in, and in a few minutes we were shown to a table outside on the patio deck, on the outer edge of the restaurant's outdoor space. The hostess pet our dog and even went inside to get our dog a bowl of water. Our server greeted us warmly and mentioned that the restaurant 'loved dogs'. We were all set. We ordered 2 (very delicious) cocktails and a charcuterie and cheese board to start.\\n\\nAbout 20 minutes later, while we were maybe a third of our way into our drinks and charcuterie, the manager came out and told us that dogs were not allowed. She put the blame on us for not knowing, even going so far as to say 'I thought you knew'. She said we could chain our dog to an outdoors pole way out of our line of sight and reach, away from the restaurant. When we rejected this option (as our dog is just a 3 month old puppy, and I wouldn't have accepted the offer even if our dog was full grown), she said she would see if there was another table that we could be moved to. If there wasn't, we would have to leave. She mentioned that SHE would be back shortly with either another table for us to move to, or our check. After about 5 minutes, our SERVER was back with our check and an apology (I do not blame him whatsoever for this experience; he was knowledgeable about the menu and drinks and was very friendly). The manager did not even have the courtesy to keep her word and come back and talk to us personally. We were given no reduction or discount whatsoever on our bill - we were charged full fare for our cocktails and appetizer. As a 'gesture of apology', we were given 3 wooden tokens, good for a free tapa each (which is absurd as a means of apology:  we were charged full fare for a really poor experience and the offer of apology is a lukewarm enticement to come back and spend more money at the restaurant?). We were then forced to leave.\\n\\nSomeone within the restaurant should have prevented us from bringing the dog to the table in the first place if that was the restaurant's policy, and I would have expected to be treated more respectfully after the restaurant's error - instead of being identified as the wrongdoer, being pushed out the door quickly while paying full fare, and being given 'come back and spend more money' tokens as a means of apology.

I admit I was so excited that I stuffed the pork belly in my mouth and was puffing air just to cool it as the fatty goodness  melted itself on my tongue.  This was a derivative item on the menu.  They had a lot of sunchokes and they decided to do the soup.\\n\\nSpecial 2 - chicken, wrapped in bacon, stuffed with foie gras.  This was a 4 out of 5 star.  Depending on your piece, you might not get a distinct foie gras taste.  This dish was well done because the bacon wrapped around it all, made it seem like it was simply the skin.  I recommend eating a full piece yourself instead of sharing just so you get the full experience of a piece\\n\\nPig Trotter - crispy crust - think panko crust.  This was so so for some friends.  Some compared it to eating steak fingers back in middle school as far as texture goes.  I think the taste of the other dishes were so strong that we expected more from this one - a little underwhelming.  \\n\\nRabbit Stew - awesome creamy grits, leg and loin.  You would think - leg - dark meat - better than the loin.  I picked up a piece of loin thinking it would be dry - so juicy you would have thought you it was drenched in rabbit confit.  My friend commented on the irony of the small carrots being served with the rabbit. \\"This could have been the rabbit's last meal served next to him\\"\\n\\nAll in all, great food.  Great service.  Nothing too pretentious about this place.  Professional but still relaxed like Austin.  The manager walked around - nice untucked shirt and jeans.  He didn't just watch, he was a part of service as he would check in with people and pick up finished plates as well.  Our server welcomed our extra orders after our first round.\\n\\nWhen I asked Jason (the manager) if they were thinking of extending hours to include lunch, he told me probably not for now because the guys come in at 9am already to prep for the dinner service.  I love a company that isn't just about getting bigger and making more profit.  Jason talked about not overworking (aka killing) the people that already work there and how things currently have their flow.  Good food, good business practices.  My kind of place.\\n\\nSee ya'll there, but I don't know if I'll really share any food with you.  I might have to kill you for that pork belly."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great place for a drink and a a doughnut.

From the superb service to the really tasty food, we knew we made the right choice coming here.\\n\\nWe arrived at approximately 9:30am on a random Thursday morning and the restaurant was already packed ON A WEEKDAY. Fortunately, we only waited for about 5 minutes and were seated promptly. It seems we had come to the restaurant just at the right time when there was some turnover happening.\\n\\nThe menu is quite simple, either go with a daily special or a main dish. If anyone is interested in sides or waffles, go for it. FYI, DEFINITELY get the waffles as a dessert. After mulling over Yelp photo after Yelp photo, it was clear the 2 most popular dishes were the Paella and Fricassee ... so ... like 2 boring, old people we got the Paella and Fricassee, along with 2 Liege Style Waffles with Milk Chocolate Lavendar and Mixed Berry Compote sauces.\\n\\nFirst, the main dishes. Both arrived in cast iron skillets and had a very nice presentation to them. Although there was a ton of stuff in both, they were neatly organized and packed. The Fricassee's main ingredients were the braised short ribs and roasted potatoes. The dish had lots of flavor and was very hearty. Even better, there were 2 sunny eggs, so I pouched both of them and the yolk was just drizzled all over the dish. The Paella was more of the same. Really flavorful and tasty, but the heart of the dish was the orzo and sausage. It was definitely not your traditional \\"paella\\" as the orzo was a decent rice substitute. \\n\\nLastly, those waffles. For each person at your table, you must order 1. No, it's not a restaurant rule, but just a common sense rule. It's that satisfying, especially with those dipping sauces. I don't care what it is, but whenever you have a flour-based food dipped into a chocolate or berry sauce, it's heaven.\\n\\nAs the morning wore on, more and more people just kept on flowing in, but the traffic was moving. In addition, the service was excellent here. We didn't have to wait too long for our food and the employees were friendly. I can't say this was the best brunch spot in Vancouver, well, because we didn't visit any other one, but I can tell you that this one was definitely worth going to according to the reviews."},{"name":"George's Roast Beef, Seafood and Pizza","address":"124 Broad St","city":"Lynn","stars":"2.5","text":"I just ordered a sub pizza, chicken and I literally love my sub and the pizza and chicken are on point my husband said I'm so glad I did it right on the first go round and they met me with excellence"},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Butcher choice really good, roasted cauliflower out of this world, however truffle fries too oily."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My favorite brunch place in downtown Vancouver!

It was terrible!! Literally awful. I tried to eat it and took a few bites but couldn't do it. Firstly, the biscuits were dry and tasteless. Secondly the pork schnitzel was so super dry and chewy that I could hardly cut it. Lastly the chorizo gravy was bland even having chorizo in it. The flavor was weird or off. I've had chorizo before but this was just wrong. The waitress must have noticed that I wasn't eating and was just nibbling  on a small fruit cup that accompanied my plate, because she asked if I didn't like my food. I was honest and said it wasn't good. So she told me she could get me something else. She also said she wasn't going to judge me because she didn't like it either. She brought me the chocolate banana waffles which were much better but really nothing spectacular. I have never sent food back or complained anywhere.

Sooo was a bit confused by the almost 13 minute estimated wait time it took to make 4 of the MOST basic mixed drinks- 2 Tito's and sodas, gin/pineapple & a captain and coke. I've been a bartender for 15 years and that would have taken me no longer then 3 minutes! Then the bill for our 4 drinks---$56!!! She literally measured each pour out & I think it may have been a shot and a half (I hope for that price)l! So a round of drinks with the tip is nearly $70! Crazy!! \\n\\nWas going to grab a bite but decided to try Fratelli since it was still open- because if that was any indication of how service was going to be then we would have been there ALL NIGHT.

Next, Ive been to this location over 20 times because it's me and my friends fav location but the quality for the past 3 times I've been here has gone down, tremendously. I usually get duck tacos or the duck rice bowl and they use to be moist and was coated in some sauce and now they are dry and don't come with any of the sauce that use to be on there. This will be my last time coming back and I will let all my friends know not to come here anymore as well.

The bulgogi was flavorful, the bibimbab was a little bland and burnt on the bottom but still good, and the seafood pancake was filled with ingredients.

Food in general is pretty overpriced, and while I was expecting to shell out some dollars to enjoy an afternoon here, I simply couldn't justify spending much of anything. \\n\\nThe highlights of the Market are the performance areas (I loved the band they had playing, and the Alp Horns are so cool), the carousel (it looks like so much fun), the cider in mugs, and the indoor goods section with the beautiful Christmas ornaments and little descriptions beside them so you can learn about the culture too. \\n\\nSo it's not all a loss, but... the overall experience is still lacking a bit.

The service was amazing, and the food even moreso.  Our waitress gave us some great recommendations and brought the food out promptly.  We did the tasting menu for 49.00 per person, and it had such a variety of options (definitely beats getting each Meze individually based on its price).  \\n\\nWe started off with some drinks.  I got a tart lemon sugar drink with gin and St. Germain and hubby got the Dirty Greek Martini.

We came in around 2 pm and there was plenty of street parking, so we did not have to park far. Walking in the restaurant is very big, we came in at a weird time so there were not many people, so we got our food quickly. I ordered the Morrison chicken as a salad instead of a slider, and I ended up paying about $13 for it. My friend ordered the loaded Broadway fries and ended up paying about $9 for those. \\n\\nWhen my salad came, I was surprised by the amount of chicken on there. It was very protein-packed with a good amount of bacon hidden underneath as well. I instantly mixed my salad since the dressing was just drizzled on top, however, I quickly regretted doing that because there was a lot of dressing on the salad. Since it was an aioli dressing the salad ended up feeling very heavy rather than a healthy option. After a few bites I couldn't stomach how heavy the dressing was, so I ended up switching plates with my friend. \\n\\nI came in wanting a healthier option and ended up with the loaded fries, however, compared to the salad the fries were AMAZING. The meat was salted just perfectly, and the sauce drizzled on top complemented everything very well. The red bell peppers were perfectly grilled, and I was blown away by how crispy their fries were. \\n\\nIn summary, the staff was kind, but they didn't really check-in and were quiet.  I think this place does well with their sliders and fries however, I wanted a healthy option and was disappointed by the overly dressed salad. On the other hand, their fries did blow me away. I would recommend this place, however, not for a healthy option."},{"name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant","address":"Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park 775 Werikhe Way","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Our family and I absolutely loved this place for lunch.

Delish!\\n\\nMy hubby got the le moulettes- spicy (I felt they had quite the heat to them)Moroccan meatballs topped with lovely poached eggs! They were beautiful and the yolk oozing out was velvety! To end our first meal of the day, we also ordered a liege waffle topped with Earnest's cardamom ice cream with root beer bitters. So good! We didn't order lots since we still had a few more meals to eat by the end of the day! \\n\\nOverall, great food and service is fast once you sit down. If you can get through the 60 min plus wait time then you will be in for some good food. One thing though, the music was rather loud. Almost to the point of not being able to hear the person across from you unless you spoke quite loudly!"},{"name":"Banya Japanese Restaurant","address":"8166 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Decided to give this place a try today for lunch since it had good reviews.

I ordered the red dragon roll and the \\"crunch\\" spicy salmon roll. Both were warm, gross, & lacking good flavor. There was nothing remotely crunchy about the salmon roll as the tempura was undercooked so it was mushy and lacked any real flavor. The red dragon roll had hardly any eel in it, was warm (wtf?) and also void of any fresh flavor. I asked for low sodium soy sauce to go and instead received the saltiest soy sauce I have ever had in my life.

Yak & Yeti is located in the Asia section of Disney's Animal Kingdom and thus appropriately combines cuisines from various parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea with some influences from Thailand and India.

Our waiter came by a few minutes later to take drink orders. We selected a few beverages (from the standard assortment), although I was actually rather exhausted and just opted for an iced tea (others ordered alcohol). We then took orders for food, and my wife and I decided to split the firecracker shrimp, sweet & sour chicken with jasmine rice, and coconut shrimp.\\n\\nWhen the appetizers came out, we dived right into the firecracker shrimp, and it sure lived up to its name! The firecracker shrimp has quite a bit of heat, even for someone like myself who likes a bit of spice. Nevertheless, it was delicious! The sweet & sour chicken was also very tasty, and we both loved the coconut shrimp (though not quite as good as the coconut shrimp at Boathouse at Disney Springs).\\n\\nOther than the food, the ambiance here was very laid back and the prices were very reasonable.

I was most surprised by the size of the restaurant and the Biergarten! The space is not large at all. The inside of the restaurant is very small as there are only two rows of tables for seating. The Biergarten is smaller than I had imagined as well. Seating is first come, first serve. You seat yourself. We arrived on a Friday evening and was very lucky to find a seat for the two of us. While eating, I noticed many who were not as fortunate and who stood the entire time we were there. After looking over the menu, you have to place your food/drink order at the bar. Your drink is served immediately while your food is served at your seat when ready. My husband and I started with a dunkel, radler, and pretzel with bier cheese. I loved my radler and I loved the pretzel. The pretzel was large, super soft, and served hot! The bier cheese on the other hand was not so great. It was gritty. It was like it was powdered cheese mixed with water or something. Blah! My husband ordered the hen, spatzel, and kartoffelsalat for his meal and I ordered the jagerschnitzel, spatzel, and sauerkraut. My husband enjoyed everything about his meal except the kartoffelsalat. I only enjoyed the jagerschnitzel out of my meal. The schnitzel was cooked perfectly. It was hot and crispy and I enjoyed the mushrooms and cream sauce on top. I felt that the spatzel lacked flavor and the sauerkraut was clearly out of a Vlasic jar. \\n\\nThe main problem that I have with Gemut is that it lacks authenticity. The food was definitely not authentic German food and that was a big turn off for me.

Also, it was our first time here, and they surprised us with a FREE shiitake mushroom omelette! The egg was amazingly fluffy, the balance of salty, sweet, and savory was just right. And the white rice in the dish was made incredibly well. As for things we ordered:\\n\\nSzechuan Dan Dan Noodles: By far my favorite. It's like Szechuan spices meets Italian spaghetti in meat sauce. Very flavorful, very very very good.\\n\\nSweet+Sour Brussel Sprouts: Delicious! They were crispy on the outside but still retained enough juice on the inside and glazed with just the right amount of sauce.\\n\\nNasi Goreng Fried Rice: beautiful presentation with a perfectly cooked egg on top. However, not my favorite dish. It had an almost burnt taste to it, which I know many people like, but it just didn't suit my palette.\\n\\nTea-soaked ribs: These were quite tasty, with some interesting spices on top. I couldn't taste the tea flavor, but I could definitely taste the Chinese spices. It was almost like Chinese peppered beef and BBQ sauce. A little bit top salty for me, but I think it would go great with a bowl of rice.\\n\\nTl;dr: Loved it! Get Szechuan Dan Dan Noodles and Brussel Sprouts!

The cheese had a very weird consistency, it didn't pull like you would want, rather it was \\"gloopy\\". After having a few bites, the pizza didn't get any better as I hoped it would. The dough was inconsistently cooked throughout, with parts that was thicker than others and some parts that were cracker thin. The worst part was the center. The pizza had quite the flop to it given the pooling of ingredients, causing a lot of the topping to kind of slide off. The middle was also soggy which is the worst part of any pizza.
