For dinner I ordered the Mahi Piccata. It took an additional 40 minutes to receive my entree. To say the fish was over cooked was an understatement. It was so dry that it was hardly edible. The mashed potatoes and green beans were good, but I expected much more from the fish. I ordered the Ooey Gooey for dessert. This took an additional 20 minutes to receive. It was ok; however, I guess their idea of an \\"Ooey gooey\\" dessert is serving you a cookie that is not cooked at all. I was basically served raw dough.

If so, Neptune Oyster has mastered this concept with its provision of lobster rolls either hot with butter or cold with mayo.  I can't quite capture the lobster roll's glory in words, so I'll do the Sam Sifton and try by analogy: the satisfaction of your first bite is akin to tightly embracing a loved one whom was thought to be lost.

Regular for 4 years now so this is my first review. Kava is a bitter, yet a passionate offering. To those who never had Kava before, it is has a mature sawdust flavor and tame midtones. It is a viscous free bitter delight that people over 25 might appreciate more than most younglings. It takes approximately 80 seconds for your glands get used to it's taste, then it turns into a beverage with a pleasing bitter aftertaste. The Kava has a bashful muted aroma which is quite pleasing during and after consumption. This is not a 'Coffee' shop, but they also carry some of the finest Tea's and Coffee blends to hold you over. \\n\\n\\nPROS\\nTo really appreciate it's unique experience, enjoy Kava with friends and sleep good knowing that you will be alert before the snooze button alerts you (as in my case usually).\\n\\nIt's important to understand it's history and culture about Kava before trying it out. It will only enhance the experience. The Kavarista's and teh owners are very good about filling new patrons in the cultural and historical aspects. It's actually quite fascinating.\\n\\nFor critical thinking tasks, Kava is a real treat, especially for computer work or studying. When the Kavarista says it promote's Mindfulness, take it as a literal interpretation. I usually advise friends, professionals, students, and people who enjoy (non-alcoholic) social time to give Kava a shot. I would not recommend Kava [or alcohol] to 'beer/party people' or those with immunity or liver issues (same with alcohol) due to its effects. I might enjoy a single serving of scotch or hot saki but never consume beer with Kava.\\n\\n\\nCONS\\nKava is a diuretic and can give you the runs, especially if drinking one or two shells in under 10 minutes. I might suggest consuming carbs beforehand and take your time enjoying the Kava over about an hour's time to ease this. \\n\\nDo not mix alcohol with Kava. The folks behind the counter will not serve people who have been drinking, and advises patrons to not drink kava if they plan on Party Drinking. While I personally enjoy having a single serving of scotch or hot saki with a sushi meal, I have had unpleasant experiences drinking piss beer from a party, actually it could just be the PBR, yuck i'm never drinking that again.\\n\\nPeople with liver or immune conditions should not consume Kava (or alcohol for that matter) for medical reasons. 3 shells should be find more most folks. I might suggest drinking a (free) glass of water after having Kava if you're a newbie.\\n\\n\\nPro Tips:\\na. Wait at least 15-20 minutes after drinking any 'sugary' beverage or eating sweeties. For example mixing Kava with Space Pepsi, Dr. Pepper or sweeties is just bad on the pallet on par with mixing toothpaste and orange juice. \\n\\nb. Nibble on Pineapple and Mango to complement the Kava. I especially enjoy salted mango + pineapple with Kava. I usually get Mango+Pineapple fruit bowl from HEB or 7-11. It's like good ass cheese and wine, except with the tropical treatment.\\n\\nc. I have a better experience consuming Kava about 30-minutes to an 1-hour after consuming foods rich in carbs. I can't say if all people are like that, but I think the carbs helps slow down the digestive process, since Kava is a diuretic. I personally especially enjoy Kava after eating something very spice like Thai food or Spicey tacos or giant burritos.

My first visit here was almost one year ago during the Virginia Highland Summerfest. I ordered the chilaquiles. While I was there I joined their e-mail list.  2 days after my birthday last month, I receive an e-mail stating \\"Come in any time this month for lunch brunch or dinner to receive a $20 birthday credit compliments of Murphy's.\\"   I decided to take my mom for Mother's Day since my birthday had passed.  We get there around 9:00 and the wait for a table was not long for parties of 2.  We were seated outside which was very crowded.  It was so crowded that the father seated next to us with his 3 daughters and wife knocked over a saucer and it broke.  The waiters had to continuously squeeze through the small space to pass each table. Our muffin basket combined with our entree plates and water glasses on the table had very little space for anything. Before ordering I informed our waiter that I had a birthday coupon and gave it to him at the end of the meal. I was very surprised when I got my receipt and only my mom's entree (trout) was removed. Called the waiter over who said only my entree (pancakes with sausage) was free, even though I stated that the coupon was for $20.00. He left to talk to the manager and came back & restated it was only my entree which I did not understand because he did credit my entree; just my mom's which cost more. I went inside and spoke to the manager who did not understand what the complaint was.  I told him I thought the coupon did not have any stipulations about which day it was used or for what meal it only stated for dine in only. I read my coupons carefully and asked to see it.  He looked at the receipt and then a few minutes later said he would give us the credit.  Did my mom get a flower? No she did not. When I sign up for a restaurant e-mail list and they offer coupons or certificates, I like to use them. I can't comprehend why managers give patrons such a difficult time about honoring them?  Many restaurants don't offer discounts or coupon specials and I think less of them should if it is going to be a problem to use them.  Yes brunch at Murphy's is good, but it is not worth the wait, the small space, or the slow service."},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"3592 N.

The Tasty Hangtown Fry was a treat, and I loved sampling the fried oysters and bacon in between bites of the crunchy-on-the-outside yet soft-on-the-inside biscuit and the scrambled eggs. There was a slight misunderstanding with our last order- my boyfriend's Bim Bop dish arrived much later than everyone else's food (for comparison, I was almost done with my plate), but it may have been because they assumed we were sharing our entrees family style.

I came by with a group of four on a Sunday night around 8pm and it took about 20 minutes to get seated at the bar. I'm not familiar with the different east coast oysters so we let our waiter/bartender choose a couple. She ended up choosing the Island Creek, Wellfleet, and Katama Bay oysters (first three on the list). I'm not sure she just chose those because they were first on the list or if she thought we would enjoy them, but they were all pretty good. I can't remember which were more salty than the others but I really enjoyed the Island Creek oysters. The P.E.I Mussels were my favorite part of the meal! I would definitely recommend trying them. They are soaked in a delicious sauce/soup that you can eat with bread on the side. I'm a huge fan of garlic so I think that's why I enjoyed this dish so much. The server/waitress even provided extra bread to eat the remaining soup with. I had the Seared Georges Bank Scallops for an entree and they were delicious. They weren't over seasoned or over cooked. The brussel sprouts were a great side with the scallops. Overall I really enjoyed my meal at Neptune Oyster. I wish they would have had a larger space to accommodate more people or to offer more comfortable seating for people but that may be part of their ambiance/style.

We walked in when it wasn't even packed and no one greeted us. A minute or two later my date spotted a sign propped up by a growler jug. The sign said seat yourselves, so we took a table. We didn't have menus, but we just assumed that someone would be with us shortly. This was not the case. A family came in a few minutes later and the hostess came from the back to seat them with menus nearly right away. Since our table was awkwardly right next to the hostess stand where she now was standing, my date apologized for seating ourselves because we saw the sign. She said it was fine and then walked away to the back again. We still had no menus. We had to wait again for the hostess to come back to the front and ignore us before I walked over and asked for menus. Finally! \\n\\nAfter we got menus, a waiter came by to get our orders. We were going to grab beers later in the day at another place, so we ordered the mocktail. It was described to us as a virgin Paloma, but was a lot less grapefruit and a lot more lime - delicious nonetheless. I also ordered the regular Belgian waffle since I had already tried their Chicken and Waffles preciously and my date ordered the KH5 frittata. Our server mixed up our orders and gave my date my waffle and I got his frittata, but we didn't have the heart to tell him. We just switched plates when he walked away, but he came by and made a comment later. He also put my regular Belgian waffle order in as the Chicken and Waffles, but boy am I glad!\\n\\nThe really saving grace of this place is the food. My chicken and waffles was really an order mixup blessing in disguise. It was not the same as my previous order of Chicken and Waffles. The chicken was crispy, juicy, and perfectly cooked. I also liked how it was boneless other than one bone that was easy to cut around. There was rosemary on the plate, but the overpowering rosemary maple syrup was no more. My only complaint was that the waffle got soggy quite quickly in the middle from the syrup and heat of the chicken. Perhaps having syrup on the side and pouring it over yourself might help that. My date's frittata was delicious too. It wasn't a very thick fluffy egg frittata and was very thin, but it was very flavorful and moist. It also came with a salad. \\n\\nDespite the awful service we received, my date and I are already excited to go back to try out their lunch and dinner menus.

Before I get into the superlatives, I have a general question for restaurants that don't take reservations. Why do you find it necessary to antagonize your customers? There is no need to make people wait 2+ hrs for a table and not be able to plan their evenings as a result.  Also, there is some sort of 'list' you can get on if you know somebody and cut the line. That sucks too. Stop being jerks about this policy and open up a reservations book. Minus 1 star.\\n\\nThat said, my experience was fantastic. Had the dates & meatballs for appetizers and both were fantastic. Followed that up with the short rib & truffle mac & cheese, which was delicious. The veggi pizza was a mild disappointment, but I wouldn't have ordered it anyway. Loved the drinks, service was excellent.\\n\\nAll in all, I thought we got good value here. Even though it was busy, they didn't overload the bar, so not too hard to get drinks before/after dinner.

Mediocre food coupled with inattentive service, (don't get me wrong, there are plenty of employees standing around, but that unfortunately does not translate into good service for the customers) after the rediculous wait to be seated and prices that can only be justified by the location's cost per square foot.

Barcelona is located in what looks like a pretty old building in downtown Columbus.  But from the outside to the inside, the restaurant looks like it might have been teleported from Spain to Ohio's capital city.  The slightly dinged and nicked furniture doesn't make the place look shabby...instead it imparts a nice authentic feel to the restaurant.  The place was jumping when we went there on a Friday evening, but most of the business was being done at the bar at the time of our visit.  The restaurant was clean and the most of the tables were nicely spaced.  So why not an A+, you ask?  If you've read our treatment of The Cheesecake Factory, then you know we hate the long bench seat with the bunch of mini tables set up right next to each other.  Unfortunately, Barcelona's has the same setup.  It wasn't really a problem until diners were sat on both sides of us, but that didn't happen until near the end of our meal.  However, with lots of open tables around, we shouldn't have been seated there in the first place.\\n\\nHigh marks:  Clean, nice d√©cor, authentic feel\\nLow marks:  The horrible bench seat \\n\\nService:  Grade A:  Our server during our visit was Mara.  Unless you skipped over the bold Grade A, you should have a pretty good idea of how she did with the service.  All of our needs were met promptly, and the timing of the food was impeccable.  We didn't feel rushed, yet we weren't sitting there wondering how much longer we'd have to wait.  There were no errors with the service and our orders, and any special requests we made were attended to with a smile and a nod.  The only complaint, and it's minor and more of a point of personal preference, the service was a little too stiff.  Everything was done correctly, but the service almost had a choreographed feel to it, if that makes any sense.  We prefer a little ad-libbing with our service.   \\n\\nHigh marks:  Very near perfect\\nLow marks:   Just a tad stiff and choreographed\\n\\nFood/Spirits:  Grade A:  We had a midday snack, so we decided to skip the appetizer at Barcelona.  For her drink, Katina ordered the Sun City, which was very refreshing with a nice, fruity base and minimal alcohol bite.  One could easily sit there and drink one after another of these and find themselves on the floor.  I ordered a couple of Weihenstephaner Hefe Weiss's, which is one of my favorite hefeweiss beers because instead of a citrus note on the back end, this particular wheat beer has a banana-like flavor to it.  For her entr√©e, Katina ordered the salmon, which she requested be cooked well done.  The salmon came out perfectly prepared and complimented nicely with angel hair pasta.  I selected the lamb chops cooked medium well.  The strange thing about the lamb chops was that I wasn't that impressed with them on my first bite.  But somehow, each subsequent bite was better than the previous one, and by the end of the entr√©e I had to fight the urge to sop up the juice with my napkin and wring it out in my mouth (I refrained out of respect for my lovely wife).  The chops ended up being excellent, and I've never had a dish be able to turn on the flavor mid-course like that.  Because we had some time to kill, we both ordered the chocolate pudding cake for dessert.  It looked and tasted exactly like the name suggests, and we enjoyed it immensely.\\n\\nHigh marks:  Good salmon, drinks and dessert  \\nLow marks:  Lamb chops started shaky but pulled through\\n\\nValue:  Grade B:  I generally detest using coupons at restaurants, but Katina has not issue with it.  She was armed with a $10 off coupon on our visit, but Barcelona was running a special where they took off 25% from each food item, saving us about $20.  For the superior quality and the fact we had drinks and dessert, we felt like we'd robbed someone.  This would have been a solid A or A+ if we could have had the same feel without the discount.\\nHigh marks:   Pretty reasonable price considering the quality of food\\nLow marks:   We shudder to think of the price without the special"},{"name":"Joey D's Oak Room","address":"1015 Crown Pointe Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The atmosphere was great.

We were expecting a decent meal since it hasn't been too bad in the past and have a few friends and family that said it's not bad.  When we opened it up my wife's burger was a hockey-puck and inedible, my 18 month old had a grilled cheese and fries and it was comical to see her pull apart the bread and attempt to eat the cheese and spit it out...  it wasn't even melted.  I said \\"oh sweet potato fries.\\"  My wife told me that they were regular fries.  I looked closer and saw they were fries left in the frialator way too long and you could tell from the color of the fry that the don't change their grease.  Ewww!

Had I known, I would have come a little earlier to take part of the $1 burger special, which may have made the complete lack of service a little more palatable.  Basically, we had to seat ourselves, request menus after our server did not appear for 10 minutes, and sit in the dark until she finally turned on a light for us.  True, the bar area was busy on a Friday night, but not that busy. And if other restaurants can manage to provide good service when busy, I don't see why Match can't.  We ordered our drinks.  The martinis were flavorful and strong, but if you go for one with whipped cream, I'd recommend asking them to go light on it or else 1/3 of your drink will be whipped cream.  We each decided to try a burger and a side. The burgers were good and tasty.  The buns are a little on the greasy side, so napkins are definitely necessary (especially with the cloud of whipped cream on the martini).  It's too bad our waitress didn't brink napkins or silverware until we were halfway through our meal.  And, I'm really not the one to complain over a meal or service (to give you an idea of how bad this really was)!  I ordered lobster bisque and a classic burger, and received a classic burger and a lobster burger. Frankly, this is an honest mistake in the loud environment of the bar, but I received a snooty look and \\"deal with it\\" attitude that was unacceptable. I would expect at least some compensation in the check, since I had to eat a meal I did not order (especially since the burger is more expensive than the soup), but I didn't get that (at least give me the difference between the two items!). Frankly, I would have settled for an apology, but I didn't get that either. Food is good, but not exceptional.  Service is downright awful."},{"name":"The Bistro On Park Avenue","address":"348 N Park Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3","text":"Walking along the busy streets of Winter Park during the morning, I happened to stumble upon an alley way to my left which had a beautiful water fountain flowing with water. I can see some outside patio tables and people lounging with coffee and some snacks. I walk down the alley way, only to find to my surprise this hidden gem of a Resturaunt called Bistro on the Park. I liked the sunroom, which I thought was really cozy. I can see a bridal shower of 15 women with beautiful balloons, gifts and drinking Mimosas from tall flute champagne glasses. I can see they are having fun and want to check out the rest of the Bistro. Walking in, the owner is Erica.\\nShe is very nice and greets you with a warm smile. As she says, \\"walk this way and let me show you to your table\\", I feel VIP. As we sit down, she shows us the varieties of Mimosas that we can select with our meal. The Bistro has daily Saturday specials, which often changes and sometimes not that same. I chose the Banana Fosters Pancakes with a side of fruit and cottage cheese. It was to my ULTIMATE surprise, a delightful and enjoyable Bananas Foster dessert captured in a form of a pancake. I was mesmerized that the clovers did not over power one another but a spot on blend of just the right amount of ingredients. Since then, I have been back twice and brought guests who also enjoyed the various Benedict choices offered, as well as Key West Rueben sandwich. Each time I come back, Erica remembers me and my guests. I didn't want to share this little gem with anyone, but I'm certainly happy to help Erica and her business succeed and grow.

Well, if you said yes, this place should have your answer. \\n\\nI walked inside, and I said to the man standing behind the counter with a very confident voice,\\n\\n\\"I heard that this place serves some good steak and cheese sandwiches,\\"\\n\\n\\"The best sandwich you will ever have, sir,\\" said the man with a lot of confidence.\\n\\nI ordered a steak and cheese sandwich with onions and sweet peppers. After waiting for a few minutes, the man gave me a huge sandwich filled with beef and cheese that was served in a long baguette. It was definitely more than 35 cm long. They say that they make 16 inch sandwiches, so that makes it around 40 cm. One 40 cm sandwich served at this place should be enough for two people who want a moderate lunch, or feed the stomach of a very hungry man that might be 1.8 m in height. \\n\\nI really liked the sandwich, the baguette had a nice crisp on the outside, and was chewy on the inside. The warm beef, combined with the sticky cheese, peppers and the onions made it a good sandwich. Maybe with a little ketchup or mayonnaise on the beef and cheese, and you will have a really big and tasty sandwich. I would not say it was the best sandwich I ever had in my life, but it was probably the best sandwich I ate on a Monday afternoon. \\n\\nAs for other dishes, their pasta is actually a great choice. Although they are a little expensive, at almost $20, you will definitely get your stomach full and maybe you will be able to take home some leftovers if you are not hungry. I ordered the Spaghetti with Calamari served in a white sauce. I thought it was probably one of the tastiest seafood pasta dishes I had in a long time. The calamari was freshly cooked, and the texture was just right. The calamari portions were almost excellent. The sauce had a nice garlic flavor that tasted really well with the spaghetti. They were also generous enough to give me two pieces of bread to dip into the sauce when I finished the spaghetti. The man behind the counter said to me that the seafood that they serve here is \\"made to order.\\" \\n\\nThis place is not really a cafe, because they do not serve much coffee, it's more of a simple and small eatery, and they also serve some beer as well. \\n\\nOverall, this is a great choice if you want a really big sandwich that is greater than 38 cm in length or a good seafood pasta dish, as long as you have more than $16 in cash. It is also a great alternative choice if you are not really interested in eating at the restaurants on Hanover Street in the Italian American neighborhood of the North End."},{"name":"Efrain's of Boulder Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"1630 63rd St, Ste 10","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"I think I'll travel to Denver the next time I'm craving Mexican.

I'm not so sure about exactly what we ordered (I think it was a risotto and a pasta; they were really good but a little overpriced hence the four stars) and we were seated in front of the open kitchen where we could see the chefs and cooks working. Firstly, we were offered complimentary appetizers (I don't think they were on the menu; they were small and probably just for a taste) but then we were offered complimentary bites here and there (I remember one of them was some spicy Kobe meatballs) sent from the chef himself, about 10 feet away from us. We didn't know the owner, the chef, or any of the staff but were still offered some tasty eats. I didn't see other tables being offered complimentary anything so we were really surprised. We looked over to the chef and smiled at him to which he beamed a big smile back. He also kept looking over  to check on us throughout our meal. What the heck? It was awesome. I can't believe I haven't been back yet but I'll definitely be making a date.\\n\\nPros: friendly service, extremely friendly chef, quality food, big portions, and great selection\\nCons: on the expensive side, can be a bit loud, and parking can be a bit tricky\\nVerdict: I'll definitely come back if I'm craving Italian or happen to be in the area."},{"name":"Clerys","address":"113 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Drunk former frat boys looking for girls who  are DTF? check\\nTwice-divorced corporate pervs leering at peroxide blondes? check\\nThese are the largest demographics at Cleary's.

Wait was long and all 4 dishes that my table ordered were not up to standard. A tomato soup should not just be red oil water, a kale salad should not look like it has been fried to the point where it disintegrates into a powder, a burger should not be burnt, chicken undercooked and a meal sent back to the table cold if the cook forgot something on your grilled cheese sandwich. \\nSecond time, staff was not friendly almost seemed annoyed that a another party of 4 walked in. Two of us ordered the fish sticks off the special menu and we couldn't believe that the dish even made it on the menu. The flavors were not bad but who wants mushy fish sticks? You think fish sticks, you think crispy and flaky pieces of fish. The topper was when my friend asked for some ketchup halfway through the meal and our server schooled him on the sauce that was already given to him.

We concluded after the meal that we will not return. The food was just not tasty enough and was very overpriced. \\n\\nThe Pros:\\nWe enjoyed the Lentil Soup, bread & our Bud Light Beers. Plus, enjoyed the Belly dancing, music and the Rose & Orange Blossom water Hand washing. \\n\\nThe Cons:\\nThe food served after the delicious Lentil Soup and bread ranged from mediocre to just bad tasting.  We were served  the Imperial Fez Taste of Morocco Menu which you can see the details on their website. The assorted salads served on a platter were ok. The appetizer was the Cornish-Hen B'Stella which was ok but it was more like eating a dessert. It was too sweet for our liking. My husband chose Lamb Tajine Morozia & I chose the Lamb Shank M'Choui as our main entree. I could only manage 3 bites of mine because the flavor was not appealing to me + the meat had lots of slimey fat.  I tasted my husband's Lamb dish & it was so sweet it turned both of our stomachs. I can't believe they cost as much as they do & taste like that. We would've normally sent a bad tasting dish back but did not here due to we'd never eaten Moroccan food before so what do we know. It was interesting that our waitress did not seem to notice or care that we had barely tasted our Lamb Shanks. Next, was the dessert  which was Fruit Cocktail & two small Baklava rolls. The entire dessert was bland. I'd never had bland Baklava before.\\n\\nNote: \\nWe paid $45 for our Groupon & went over by $52. That was due to our entree selections, 4 beers, Taxes & Tip.

Ambiance was as if someone put together a Mardi Gras in their basement - very Old Time Pottery d√©cor. Pricing was Ok - about $100  for dinner, dessert and drinks. Adult drink prices are reasonable. The problem was portion size. I was left feeling hungry after my dinner. I had the combo which was a small splatter of jambalaya(very dry Andouille), a small Crawfish pie that was all crust and a cup of Gumbo, which was the best part of the meal - lots of chicken and flavor. My wife had Chicken Pontrachain which was a large portion and tasted good though not overwhelming, but was $15 and no sides. One daughter had Shrimp Etoufee which tasted good but a little small as she finished it and hardly even finishes a meal out. My other daughter had a Crawfish Po' Boy which had good flavor but was small and on some really bad bread that may have come from WalMart (if they used a GOOD Portuguese roll, it would have been really nice -then again we can only find good bread around here at Olde Hearth and they don't make Portuguese bread)) even for a half portion and a cup of dirty rice , which was average.\\nThe Beignets were pure grease and way too much sugar; the bread pudding was just ok but needed maybe a thicker sauce.\\nI do recommend the smaller portions and add your sides or cups to make your meal as this seems to be the best bargain and way to get all the flavors. \\nBTW, I do have to agree with the location is very loud.\\nOverall I have to give them a passing grade (really 2 1/2 stars) but noting they are just passing and should do a little extra-curricular homework/project to bring up that grade.

For real, I have weird feelings about writing critical reviews on yelp. There is something that feels wrong about being critical of a restaurant staff that works so hard. So let me just get this straight, this is not a critique of the service at Pine State, everyone that works there was really nice and gave me great service. \\n\\nSo here it goes: I went to the place on NE Alberta. The first time I went the line was around the block, and I really hate waiting in line, so I peaced-out and came back on a Tuesday when there were fewer people. I walked in and I was pretty stoked. They had Cheerwine, which is made in my home state of North Carolina. They also had Texas Pete in all the sauce holders on the table, and they even had shrimp and grits on the menu. So what did I order? Shrimp and grits and a side of biscuits, baby! \\n\\nSo I went outside on the patio and chilled out until my food rolled around, and man, I was hungry, I mean, huun-gry. One time my dad said that the greatest garnish you can add to food is hunger. Anyway, this dude drops my food off, and he is cool. Everyone working there was really nice. This guy came outside and cleaned up a glass that broke on the ground near a couple that had a baby and was extra cautious.\\n\\nSo, I'm digressing here, this dude brought my food and I dove into it. Like I said, I was hungry. And I have to admit that the food was pretty good. They definitely get points for creativity with food. I was looking around at all the biscuits and gravy and drooling while I was waiting for my food. And maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but about five for six bites into my food, I realized I was eating Cream of Wheat. \\n\\n...Cream of Wheat, dammit! (**shakes fist in the air**)\\n\\nNow, don't get me wrong. It wasn't BAD, really it was okay. It's just that you don't give a southerner Shrimp N'Cream of Wheat and tell him it's Shrimp N'Grits.

Without it, people might start to see otherwise about this popular Kits Beach spot. \\n\\nGenerally speaking, the service is good. The girls are friendly, as are the guys behind the bar. Never have I had service that warranted any sort of complaint. \\n\\nIt is the food that gets to me. The pinnacle of their kitchen disasters was when they had to make my medium-rare steak for my steak sandwich not once, not twice, but THREE times. By this point, my entire table had finished eating (and drinking, so that's saying something) and I was given my steak sandwich and fries in mis-matched portions. The server dealt with this as well as she could and I was credited, but I was absolutely appalled at the service from the kitchen. \\n\\nOnto other menu items, the burger is perfectly adequate. The chicken quesadilla was this weird, dry, flavourless combination. I know people who rave about their quesadilla, but I don't get it. It's extremely easy to get much better in this city. \\n\\nThe worst was the other day when our party of THREE was made to wait an hour and a half to get a table on the patio. Granted, it was an extremely nice day and the patio is on the beach. The hostesses can't control how many people come and how long they stay, that's perfectly understandable. However, their patio is huge and we watched them time after time sit two top after two top without ever even making an effort to re-arrange a table here or there to sit a group that had been waiting over an hour. They visibly just did not care about how long they were making us wait and we only received an apology when we finally cancelled our table and went to Burgoo. There, we were sat within seconds and given food that was actually cooked properly. \\n\\nI'm sure I'll be back for drinks here. Like I said, love the patio.

It does however hold together the caramelized onions, bacon aioli and juices together. The cheddar is sharp and bathes the patty in rich, sharp cheese. The beef is seasoned well enough to meld seamlessly with the toppings. The onions are not overly sweet although saut√©ed to a rich brown color. The bacon in the aioli is barely noticeable however the Creamy spread softens the bun and brings out the beef blend.\\n\\nFrench fries are hand cut, reasonably crispy and salted with flecks of kosher salt.

We moved on to a cup of Jambalaya and gumbo and two huge goblets of Abita Amber along with an order of oysters remoulade. All good. Next the kitchen split our orders of crawfish √©touff√©e and shrimp and andouille cheddar grits.  This dish is a must order.

Sophia W. got a corn dog and vegan collard greens.  All the sides are automatically veg friendly, albeit they have traditional fried chicken and such too.  They also have signs on their tables asking their customers to bust their own tables and not overstay because other people are waiting for tables.  No fuss, and asking people to gasp* be considerate of others.  The cooks then asked me if everything was tasty.  It was. The table next door got free biscuits since their order was screwed up.

My most recent visit here was with my sister and we came on a Thursday evening so it was fairly easy to get a seat compared to the weekend (the time before that I came with my fiance and we waited at least 2 hours to get seated!). So the bottom line with reservations is come early, especially on Friday-Sunday, and at least put your name down so they can call you when a table is ready because they are a small, yet incredibly busy joint. \\n\\nSo this may come as a shock, but I actually do not like raw oysters. Yes, roll your eyes and be disgusted with me, but I just never got into them. With that, you may ask, \\"So Kevin what do you order when you're there?\\" Hot lobster roll that's what. Even the first time I came here I didn't really eat lobster, but slowly but surely my fiance opened my eyes to the deliciousness of these ocean dwellers. The lobster rolls here are the bomb and I've had several other ones in Bar Harbor, Maine. The amount of lobster you get is fantastic and when you throw the flavors in there you just have the perfect combination of quantity and quality. \\n\\nIt is decently priced, but if you like lobster rolls then you'll like this one.

If you are going to stay open 24hrs a day you are gonna have up your game tremendously for this location. Otherwise you are now one of a million restaurants that stay open for those hours to serve drunk people that don't care about the food they are eating let alone the cleanliness of the atmosphere.

We waited 45 minutes for our first dish, which we sent back, then another 20 min for our second. It took forever to get water. I understand that most Indian places do not cater to the American way of dining, but the service was very poor. One shorter thinner gentlemen was very nice and he made up for the tip.

Sorry for the excitement, but I'm from rural Pennsylvania, where every strip mall has roughly a half dozen Chinese buffets (I'm barely exaggerating).\\n\\nYou're not going to find 5-star food at Mandarin Buffet. Heck, it's probably more like 2-star cuisine. But does that really matter when you're staring a buffet selection that features everything from crab legs to chicken nuggets? They even serve alcohol, which was entirely unexpected (it's just cheap beer and wine, though, so don't expect top-shelf booze).\\n\\nThe only downside to Mandarin Buffet is its Chelsea location, which is difficult to get to via public transportation. The food, however, was good compared to the average Chinese buffet. Sometimes there was a bit of food that was stale or too cold... but all you have to do is wait a few minutes for a heaping new tray of whatever to come and replace the old.\\n\\nThe choices are plentiful, the prices aren't bad (around $12 for dinner), and even the sushi was a pleasant surprise.

One thing that I love about sweetgreen is that you can always count on the quality of ingredients, consistency with portion sizes and a friendly staff. Well, you'll find none of those here. \\n\\nI went in a handful of times and felt like my bowl looked smaller with each visit. There's practically no base, you'll be happy if you find a few grains of rice. They kinda just stuff it with lots of kale (or whichever green you order) and sprinkle a bit of the other stuff. One of my favorite things at sweetgreen is their portobello mix, well at this location I think the most I got was about 1/3 of a cup. That's just ridiculous! To make the matters worse, on my last visit, the rice was barely cooked and was hard to chew. Seriously? In a $10 salad bowl? Come on. I don't know why I keep wasting my money at this location hoping it will get better when there's clearly no improvement (keeps getting worse in fact). The staff try to rush through the orders and I think food is handled with more care at a McDonald's.

We ordered the corned beef hash. Which were huge stringy chunks of corned beef. Which didn't go well together with the under cooked hash browns. Corned beef hash should be cut up so you don't spend time, cutting up the corned beef hash in your mouth for minutes at a time. \\n\\nI'd come back to try something other than the corned beef hash.

This is one of them.\\n\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\n My server was terribly disorganized, but at least he was friendly. A lot of people can't even manage that. Props for trying.\\n\\n  Nobody hassled me for my service dog. Thank God. As if the vest, tags, license, medical ID, and leash weren't enough, a lot of places still act like they've never seen a service dog in their life. I don't expect everyone to understand, but places that give him unnecessary $h!% and embarrass me publicly lose automatically in my book.\\n\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\n  Normally I love the way Austin converts so many former homes into businesses. It really gives them a lot of charm and I've seen this done REALLY well in a lot of places. Unfortunately, all of the crappy memorabilia and random crap thrown around here in a \\"Look how edgy and weird we are!\\" kind of way really just came off as a pretentious hoarder house. Some people like it, its not my cup of tea. I think I could have lived with the layers of random crap thrown over an interior outdated since the 80's if there wasn't a healthy layer of DUST over everything. Come on, restaurants should be clean.\\n\\n  My server was friendly, but he was really disorganized. His entire 4 table section had the wrong food delivered to everyone throughout the meal. Every one of our checks were sent to the wrong table. And when the check was delivered, it was a loose receipt paper slapped right on the table where there was a water ring from my glass. Classy.\\n\\n\\nThe Ugly:\\n\\n  I'm sorry, but after seeing this place on DD&D and hearing about it, I was really looking forward to the food! I was so disappointed in my salad, my sandwich, my soup... I could go one by one on the details, but it all just amounts to that the only thing I enjoyed was my toast. And I don't even eat bread all that often. It was a very lackluster experience and I would have had the same quality from Denny's, Norms, or iHop. Meh.\\n\\nThe parking is SCARY. There is probably the steepest driveway on the face of the earth that is the ENTIRE parking lot, and of course you have to park on it sideways, so it feels like your truck is at a near 90 degree angle.

Great food and a great time, with a view. \\n   \\n   I thought i would take my new girlfriend (at the time) there for her birthday in 12/09/16, because it would be a great treat for her. I made the reservation and we arrived about 5 or 10 minutes early. While we were standing there, we noticed another couple come in, several minutes after us, with the same time for their reservation.They sat us at the bar. About 15 minutes later, they called the couple who had arrived AFTER us to their table first! I didn't think too much of it, until they made us wait an additional 15 minutes or so... When i finally walked up and asked how much longer it was going to be, they finally led us to our table several more minutes later. We walked past the couple who had already been seated and had their drinks and appetizers already served. They had the perfect window table, facing east. We were led to our table, right in the north east corner, with a far less quality view. We raced through the menu to order, being that we starving at this point (probably 45 minutes after our reservation time) Dinner was good, wait staff was good.\\n\\n   I'm not the type to write a bad review usually, but opentable (the reservation app) sent me an email with a survey of sorts, asking about my experience. I was honest in the survey, describing the seemingly lack of training for the host/hostess folks in their prioritization of guests. I was contacted by a manager, who was very apologetic and assured me that they would get to the bottom of it, yada yada... and added that they would like to send me a gift certificate, if I would try them again. I told them that I love dining there, and would gladly be willing to try them again, if they sent me a gift cert! \\n\\n   Well, my girlfriend asked me the other day, \\"Hey, how much the gift certificate was for... I then realized that I had never received anything! All of that reassurance and apologetic banter, and nothing. Lost through the cracks once again. What a shame. I really enjoyed this place. I think their lack of concern for their guests/customers will eventually be their downfall. Of course, now that it's a good 4 months later, I don't remember the person that I spoke with and there is probably zero record that the conversation ever took place.

Tip: Don't chew on this too much, or at all... It will probably be gone before you know it. \\n\\nMaybe Mackerel is one of their expertise because they serve different kinds of it; however it does come with a heavy price tag. Don't expect a huge portion for $20 + sashimi. They are sliced very thinly and tiny. If you have grown the taste for oily fishy seafood, get the fresh saba. They have changed how they make this nigiri - it used to have 3 slices, but now it's just 1. (YES 3 slices!) \\n\\nThey sometimes have the rare o-toro, which comes at $6 per nigiri. It is a bit chewy and not very fatty like the regular toro, which is completely unexpected.

My go-to is usually the combination (lamb + chicken) over rice. I am not normally a lamb person, but this is the only place I'll eat it at! There's also other options to choose from (chicken, gyro, chicken shwarma, etc.) for the over rice options. My advice is to get the over rice, because personally, I think it's the most food for your money AND it's absolutely delicious. Their gyro is pretty good too, but sometimes it feels a little too burnt for my taste. The over rice bowls (?)  have the yellow rice, letttuce, diced tomatoes, your choice of meat, diced cucumbers, yogurt white sauce (SO good), and hot sauce. If you like more kick in your food, you can always for extra hot sauce, and they don't charge you for it! I also love love love their hummus! So good with their pita bread, yum. Once, when I ordered the pita and hummus, I only ordered 2 extra pita, but they were too lazy to take it out of the packaging so they ended up getting either 4 or 5 YAY.

We went to the bar and I pulled out my smartphone and saw that the restaurant had open reservations through 7:00pm.  I booked a reservation for 4:00pm.\\n\\nThe same bar waitress that told us they were completely booked came and asked us if we had just made a reservation.  We told her yes, we did. She began to pretend like there was something wrong with the reservation system. She then offered to pay for the round of drinks we had ordered.\\n \\nWhen we were taken into the dining room for a table, she wanted to give us the first table in front of the kitchen. A high traffic area.  I asked if we could have a table that I liked better across the room that was more private.  We were told by this waitress, that those tables were for a special list, and she was adamant that we could not sit on the side of the room that we wanted.\\n\\nFor a dining room that was completely booked, we were the only diners in the room, almost an hour after we were told they were completely booked. \\n\\nWhen another dining party finally showed up that happened to be white,  we overheard the waitress clearly say to them, \\"where would you like to sit?\\"  They began scanning the room to see which table seemed the best to them.  They chose the side of the room where we originally asked to be seated.  Upon hearing this we were shocked!  Moments later they changed their mind and were reseated at another table of their choice. Again, we were shocked at the difference in the service they received versus us. That was unacceptable for us!\\n\\nWe had already placed our order, for the largest cut of prime rib with lobster tails added to each of our orders but after witnessing the huge difference in how we were treated, I was so upset that I asked my husband to take me to another restaurant. He went up to pay for our drinks and to cancel our order and was told \\"no problem, the drinks are on us.\\"\\n\\nThe food and drinks that we ordered came to about $200.00, but we left without having dinner and we went to the Olive Garden Mall 205 and had an excellent dinner at half the cost of what we were prepared to spend at your establishment, and the customer service was superb!  Instead of you making $200 off of us, your restaurant lost the cost of four drinks.\\n\\nUnless the Owners of this restaurant want to make some changes in your establishment and insist that your employees cater the same, we will not return to do business with you. \\n\\n We think that the Owners need to be more hands on and train your employees to treat ALL customers with the same level of respect that we observed the white customers receiving.  \\n\\nWe were deeply hurt and disappointed by the treatment we received."},{"name":"Commune Kitchen","address":"203A Broadway","city":"Arlington","stars":"4.5","text":"I live around the corner from Commune but tried it for the first time tonight.

For the entree, I had their dry aged ribeye which was about $50, and it was not worth the price. Save your money and go to Ringside Steakhouse for expensive steak.

The octopus was good but I wish the exterior was a little more crispy.\\n\\nEntrees: Orecchiette (sausage/fennel) pasta had a slight spiciness to the sausage and didn't feel too heavy. The Paccheri (lobster/green onion) pasta was a little too oily and didn't not have enough lobster. \\n\\nDessert: We finished our meal with a Bluberry Crostata, a pastry topped with popcorn and corn gelato. The pastry itself was slightly too hard so it made it difficult to break into smaller pieces. The gelato was good but it was tough to taste the corn flavors without eating it with the popcorn.\\n\\nOverall the food was generally good to excellent and the pricing for all of this food plus drinks was about $100 excluding tip.

I've heard that it would be a good place to bring kids, but I didn't see anything there that would entertain my kid any more than the plethora of other options in town.

I just had a bite of my sister's burger, not a whole meal. Additionally, my margarita came from the machines you see at taco cabana, so no talent really went into that. The whole restaurant doesn't deserve a negative experience because of the awful service we had.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I met up with my sister, her boyfriend, and his friend, who had already been waited on. Although they had eaten already, they were watching a football game and still ordering drinks. My boy and I were NEVER acknowledged. It's a seat yourself establishment, so sometimes you don't get noticed right away. That's fine because I'm not a high maintenance customer and don't mind waiting, but we must have waited 15 minutes without our waitress checking on us, and my sister even made eye contact with her and waved her over, just to disregard us. So, fine, we went to the bar and ordered our drinks on our own, JUST to run into our \\"waitress.\\" There is no way she didn't realize we had been sitting in our section, mostly because i was wearing a little black dress with a big grungy flannel over it and EVERYONE else is wearing a jersey. She stood next to us while the bartender made our drinks. It was incredibly awkward. Later, although we were hungry, there was no way to flag her down so we just didn't order anything. She would occasionally wait on my sister (but not us, weird right?), and she asked if they had tall boys. She said no. My sister orders a beer. It comes in a tall boy can. How do you work in a sports bar in West Campus in one of the biggest college towns in the United States and not know what a tall boy is? My mom is a saint who's never really drank, and even SHE knows what a tall boy is. SO, although all of this was weird and off-putting, I didn't feel compelled to write a negative review until the check comes. The drink menu on the table indicated gratuity for parties of 5 or more. Understandable. However, they were charged gratuity, and she only waited on THREE of us. Three. Not five. Two out of the five people at this table had to go back and forth between the bar to get our own drinks. Did she have a feeling she was going to get a bad tip and therefore felt the need to ensure she would make money off the table? My sister and I have both been servers throughout college and tip above and beyond, so although she didn't provide acceptable service, we wouldn't have NOT tipped her. If the rest of the staff benefits from that tip it's not fair to penalize them for her rudeness. I just totally could not believe she chose to ignore us and then acted as though she had served us."},{"name":"Ichiza Kitchen & Tea House","address":"5411 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent service and food.

Then again, I haven't been to a BBQ joint with a great menu at this point. I think that is a way that the BBQ industry could make some strides.\\n\\nThe meat itself was good. Not 5 star or grand champion good, but really good. My problem is that I like sauce and they handed me 2 sauces and the sweet one must have been Sweet Baby Rays or something. It just didn't taste fresh. The Carolina sauce wasn't bad. It tasted a bit like Franks, which is a good thing.\\n\\nThe cole slaw was good. It kept me guessing as to what was in it. The potato salad tasted like it came from the refrigerated section at Krogers. That will never cross my palette again. Ever.\\n\\nTo me, the sides make the BBQ joint. Sure, the meat should be good.

With Pho. There's one particular day I remember of Freshman year. I just finished my Psychology exam and I hate that shit really. So much memorization. And so I came here at around 9:30am. I was obviously the only customer and I got the Large Pho. When it came I knew, this place was special. Nothing beats morning Pho. I can eat it anytime of the day. Trust me, for those who pull all-nighters, this is the cure. And then you can nap for 8 hours. \\n\\nThe noodles come very fast. For a while I got the large, but once I went Extra Large, I never turned back. Ahhhh. Noodles are fucking fantastic. I don't think I've ever found a place that had exactly the same noodles. I probably have, but very few places have this kind of thin noodles and it's very easy to swallow. A lot of beef comes your way with the extra large. And tendons. and raw beef. The combination of cooked and raw beef is amazing. Large chunks, and the cooked beef is delicate, whilst the raw beef (it will cook in the soup) is wholesome and chewy. And how can I forget the tripe! I used to hate it, but I love it now. It has a funky chewy texture to it. \\n\\nOf course I add some stuff to my Pho, namely Sriracha. And lots of it. Give it a good spanking and squirt. After I'm done with the noodles, I pour in the bean sprouts, and I pretend they are noodles. And the Broth - my god, there is really nothing like it. Hearty, meaty, tasty. It smells like the fragrance of a lover. The combination of broth, meat and noodles make a very flavorful experience.\\n\\nYeah service can be ass sometimes, sometimes it can be great. It's a hit or miss. When I took my parents here I was disappointed because they forgot our order. The one time I'm trying to make my parents love something. C'mon! Sometimes it's great though. They can be friendly depending on who. Sometimes too friendly. Oh well, the things I do for pho. And it's fast. Very Fast. Sometimes it comes out in less than 4 minutes. \\n\\nI've been here at least 200 times. No Joke. Once I came here 4 times in a week. It's that good.  \\n\\nI will always compare any other pho restaurant with this one, and it will never live up to this one. Even if it's arguably better (highly doubt it), this is my first love. \\n\\nI continue to search for this kind of pho throughout Hong Kong and L.A., and I can't find anything like it. Honestly, sometimes, I do day-dream about getting this before I go to bed at night. I dream of devouring those noodles as I do. I gobbled it up like a snake and I can finish a X-Large bowl in 5 minutes.   \\n\\nAbsolutely Favorite restaurant of all time. I'm really here for my love. My pho.

No. \\n\\nI waited 5 minutes for someone to emerge from the back and take my order, and when they did, they only had cinnamon rolls with strawberry icing. Wtf is that?

Lots of mediocre breakfast fare, including the gluten-free waffles, which were both dense and hard. A true disappointment to me after having eaten the light and fluffy little dreamsicles they whip up on Sunday morning over at Thai Fresh. I really disliked everything that I ate. \\n\\nTypically, a place that caters to food allergies will try and be sensitive to the other ones that almost always occur concurrently: shellfish, nuts, eggs, dairy. They at least try and avoid that stuff for the most part, but the brunch fare was very dairy and egg heavy, with soy being the only other option. \\n\\nAnd it was pricey. So for my money, this is not the Celiac's spot for brunch at all.

This is the place to be!\\n\\nWorry not if the private parking lot is full; there's ample street parking, and it's such a cute area to walk around after you get your ice cream anyway, although you could also sit at Jake's private outdoor or indoor seating areas, or stroll around the \\"Made in Georgia\\" indoor market that shares an entrance with Jake's. One consistency is certain - there will be a line, but worry not, because it's ice cream, so the line moves quickly, and the employees seem to be happy and helpful!\\n\\nYou might be caught off guard or put off by the flavors, since they're not always very descriptive of what the ice cream flavor actually contains, but that's what the employees are there for, and they're not shy about giving you hefty sample spoonfuls of flavors like \\"Hot Sexy Mexican\\" (cayenne-spiced chocolate) or \\"Diesel Fuel\\" (dark chocolate/espresso). The flavors are true to their ingredients and are not cloyingly-sweet or artificially-colored. If you're visually-stimulated in making your ice cream choice, the flavor cases are behind glass, so you can point at what look good to you. They also have sorbet and other dairy-free ice creams. My favorites from all their choices are Hot Sexy Mexican, Keylime PieScream, Chocolate Slap Yo Mama, and Brown Shugah Vanilla. I also like their sorbets.\\n\\nChoose from a cone or cup - the portions are huge!

It will only set you back about 5 or 6 bucks. Rest assured that if you're dragged here and you're not an ice cream fan, they have a nice little pastry case with appealing-looking cookies, donuts, mini cakes, croissants, and bagels.

The cranky old server comes over with hot tea and soup and asks \\"whatta you want\\"? \\n\\nWe ordered lo mien noodles with chicken and duck, rice with bbq pork, and chicken, and a side of veggies. The old man in the kitchen cooks each item with great care. One entree came out, then the veg, and 5 minutes later the noodles. The flavors explode in your mouth like some sort of Asian euphoric fantasy. The hot oil they have adds to the taste adding a bit of pop to the meal. The green veggies have oyster sauce on them and are flavored perfectly. We shovel it all down and can eat no more. The bill comes and it is $17 dollars for 2 people. WTF??? You cant beat that. Great cheap food infused with dirt and cranky staff. This is the wave of the future.....\\n\\nYUMMY!"},{"name":"Rising Son","address":"124 N Avondale Rd","city":"Avondale Estates","stars":"4","text":"I wanted to come here about a year ago but I wasn't able to find parking (note to fellow Yelpers - there is incredibly limited parking in the front of the restaurant and in the parking lot that's sort of behind it) so I ended up not coming back until today (after doing a Yelp search for brunch in Decatur).  Since we were in the area, we decided to give this place another shot.  Lo and behold, we were able to find a parking space on the street, a few doors down from the restaurant.  Score! They close at 3pm on Sunday and we arrived around 1:30pm so I assume we missed the big brunch rush around 11am.  \\n\\nWe were seated pretty quickly at 2 window seats, which was nice since we had a nice view outside.  Their menu has good options (not too many) and they're reasonably priced.  I'm always happy to see vegan/vegetarian items on a brunch menu so I went with the vegan grit bowl.  OH. MY. GOD.  This is probably one of the best vegan meals I've ever had in Atlanta.  It's basically a bowl of perfectly textured grits topped with (primarily green) veggies and a vegan form of potlikker (basically the \\"juice\\" that's formed when you cook collard greens) gravy.  I must find out how they seasoned that gravy because I'm pretty sure I could drink it out of a glass! LOL! Also, I loved that the grits were chock full of onions/scallions and topped w/ roasted beets.  I would have loved to see a \\"protein\\" element present but I promise I'm not complaining! I also ordered a biscuit (after trying a bite of my husband's) since they were fluffy and delicious!! One thing of note is that they have a homemade pineapple jam which is a perfect spread for the biscuit.  Do try it! My husband had the fried trout and grits, which he devoured and raved about, as well.  Overall, my experience here was very good! Great food, good service -- oh, and good coffee!  \\n\\nI'm usually in this area when I need to go food shopping at the DeKalb Farmer's Market.

Typically, an art museum wouldn't be my top place to visit in a mid-size town with just a few days to check things out, but since it was hot and I was pregnant, air conditioned entertainment was a top priority. By happy coincidence, we happened to go to the museum on Sunday, which is free admission. How amazing is that! \\n\\nI wasn't expecting much from this museum but was absolutely blown away. I thought that the entire museum was focused on being interactive and introducing children to art. An area of the museum was focused specifically on children that had multiple engaging activities. In addition to that, many of the main galleries had kid friendly activities as well, such as large puzzle versions of paintings in the same room. My husband and I were so impressed and can't wait to bring our daughter back here when she's older.\\n\\nIn addition to being an awesome place for children, I also loved the museum as an adult. It's a great size - enough to take up a few hours of time but not so overwhelming that you don't have time to look at each piece in a reasonable amount of time. I also appareciated the folding chairs strategically located throughout the museum. They're perfect for anyone needing to take a break.\\n\\nAfter spending a couple hours in the museum, we ended our time in the well curated gift shop, where I even found a gift for my impossible-to-buy-for best friend.

Our server's name was Austin S., and he was nice at first.

After taking our orders, he forgot what we had ordered for our appetizer, and had to come back and ask what it was(because he didn't bother writing down the order). After that, we never saw him again until I flagged him down to grab boxes after we were finished eating. He did not even bring the amount of boxes we had asked for, and I had to ask him for another one. He then offered to bring us bags, without us asking for them, and seemed exasperated regardless. We had to ask a different server for for refills when she brought us our food. We paid our meal through the table side system(which was the only perk of this meal) and left. As we were leaving, we overheard him talking with another server about finishing up with sweeping his tables, rolling his silverware, and \\"Getting the hell out of there.\\" Now that I had heard all at, I understood that he had been prioritizing his side work above his tables, I was even more upset than I had been before.

(Although, I'm not sure why one would visit Jake's if he or she didn't want ice cream.) Back to the ice cream, though, their cream is nice and smooth. A patron won't find any grainy or custardy-ness at all (which is how I like it). Since it was my first visit, I only tasted three flavors:\\n\\n*Chocolate Slap Yo Mama: Chocolate chips, Oreo cookies, and chocolate sauce -- if there was only one scoop left of this amazing-ness, I would strongly consider budging in-front of a long line of grandmas and grandpas to get it. Does transcendent ice cream trump Southern hospitality? Possibly.\\n\\n*Coffee Toffee: I usually like my coffee flavored ice cream obnoxiously overpowering, but I could totally appreciate the subtleness of this one. I would've also liked more toffee chunks in mine, too, but I know my homie Jake was just looking out for my waistline. \\n\\n*Peanut Butter & Jammy: Whoa. It actually taste exactly like a P&J sammy!

The only thing that would have made this omelet better is if the bacon had been crumbled instead of just placed in the omelet in slices...it made cutting difficult BUT if it would have been crumbled it would also have allowed me to eat it much faster. Not a good thing in my frail state. \\n\\nMagnolia Cafe is a MUST when you are in Austin.

It's a reflection of how the place manages its wait list.  We were told that there was an hour and a half wait for a table of 3.  Ok. I can handle that.  We were told that they would text us when the table was ready.  Since you can't get to the bar as people are seated and eating, we went to the bar down the street.  Wait an hour and a half.  No text... So we return to find that others who came after us were seated before us.  We were told it was going to be 40 more minutes.  Bull shit.... It was apparent that the hostess was incompetent or somehow specially challenged.  If she spent as much time focusing on doing a good job as she does in the tattoo parlor, she might be worth the money she was paid.   \\n\\nNeedless, we dined at a place down the street called Jake's and had as good a meal there as I have had at Alder in the past.

Also, I am very familiar with different Brazilian Steakhouses and the wide range of flavors they offer.\\n\\nLet me set the stage, Its 5:30 pm on a Sat and me and a buddy want some Brazilian steak. We wander into this quaint little place called \\"Fire of Brazil\\" right in the heart of Downtown Atlanta. We noticed the restaurant was completely empty besides us and the servers (Flag 1). We ask the server if they are open and she says yes and immediately asks if we know the price. We both said yes and she asked AGAIN if we were ok with the price ($41). Mind you, this is rather cheap for a Brazilian steak joint. We again say yes and are led to our table. \\n\\nBeing this is all you can eat, we grab a plate and head to the salad bar. After wrestling with some flies (Flag 2) I was able to finally get a couple veggies from the miniscule selection. We return to the table where we begin to eat. We both finish our salads and have our green indicator cards ready and then NOTHING. We waited for about 12 minutes before the first server came around with the selection of meats. \\n\\nNow to the disgusting part. They brought out the side dishes which were bread, fired bannannas, and PINTO beans. What Brazilian steak house serves PINTO beans? The proper bean of Brazil would be the black bean. The meat was dry, taisteless and not edible. Also, what Brazilian steak house serves TURKEY???(Flag 3)  We both tried 1 piece of meat and were so disgusted that we literally had to stop. I still had my indicator card on green and one of the meat servers approached asking if I would like another serving, I told him we were done and would like the check. He gave me a dirty looked, grunted, said something in spanish, pointed and grabbed my card and flipped it over and stormed off without ever acknowledging my request. \\n\\nWe had to ask 3 additional people for the check prior to it coming. We paid and started to exit the building when we noticed all the servers sitting in the front window playing on their phones and never said good bye. \\n\\nI expected less then par service because of the price, but this was unbelievable.

Since I was in a nibbly mood, I ordered a charcuterie plate for myself as a main course. A couple heavy pates made it pretty filling, but it was very tasty! Probably safe to share amongst 3-4 people if you don't want to try that much fatty food on your own. My counterpart ordered a cheese plate and the fish special which also looked fantastic, but left them a bit hungry. My only disappointment was the smoked mussels appetizer, which with the seasoning and potato crisps reminded me too much of hotdogs. It's not an item I've ordered before so maybe it's just not to my taste. Service was fantastic and the location is close to all sorts of downtown highlights, so I'll try and come again someday- next time with friends to share the charcuterie with me!"},{"name":"Apple Spice Junction","address":"3249 Old Winter Garden Rd, Ste 20","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Okay.

I'd never heard of if and while it is in a hard-to-find spot, it is totally worth it! \\nJohn Boone, the owner, met with us for a consultation. He took us on a tour of the kitchen to show us how everything is made fresh (huge points for this!) and he even gave us samples of the amazing fresh bread. \\nLong story short, John did an outstanding job, and their food is phenomenal!

It was not quite lunch time and relatively quiet. Within fifteen minutes the cafe had the ambiance of Penn Station , New York at 5 pm except the cafe was noisier. People lining up to give and receive their take out orders filled the cafe and one worker yelled  loudly and constantly the names of people whose orders were ready. It was astonishing, really, to hear his braying voice screaming at the people in line . We left after 20 minutes of this; my ears were ringing. \\nHad I eaten lunch there, I think I would have gotten indigestion from the chaos. There must be a better way to tell people their orders are ready other than screaming at them. How about using some technology rather than vocal chords?"},{"name":"Match","address":"94 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Great Place!

It means all foods only come in portions for about two people, so you have to share. In order to get a balanced meal, you get to argue with your friends to come to an agreement of which arrangement of large plates of single foods you're all going to share. After negotiating and ordering, you get to bump big serving plates and little eating plates into each other for 45 minutes as you pass around way too many plates for a crowded little table. Then you get to figure out how to split the bill.

Their avocado salad is one of my favorites - a generous portion that focuses on avocado, not lettuce!  I've had a bunch of different maki and always been happy.  My husband doesn't like sushi, but has been pleased with the agemono entrees.  I'd second some of the comments about the spicy tuna, but I've found that every sushi restaurant is bound to do one of your favorites in a way you aren't wild about.

The reviews I'd read and photos I'd seen made me consider the trip to Southie for brunch.\\n\\nShortly after arriving, I deemed this place the most basic brunch place in Boston.  All around me were girls in their Canada Goose jackets, leggings, and Uggs...are Uggs still a thing?  I am in no way trying to bring this place down, I'm just trying to let others know what they're in for.  Despite the basic brunch crowd, I'd happily return to this place, and let's face it, I'm pretty basic too.\\n\\nThe space itself is huge making it a good spot for larger groups.  There is a sitting area with smaller tables near the front, booths lining the main room, a large back room with smaller tables, and a bar in both rooms!  Everyone seemed very friendly during our visit, and our waitress was very apologetic that we had to wait for our pancake order because they ran out of Fruity Pebbles.  I will say that because the place was so large and relatively busy, we had to flag down our waitress for coffee refills and for the check.\\n\\nThe meal started with complementary blueberry bread, which was served with butter...but the butter was nearly frozen.  The bread itself was delicious though.  We ordered the Fruity Pebble pancakes, which are topped with cereal milk anglaise, and the aple cinnamon waffle topped with maple pecan crumble and vanilla bean whipped cream.  I was most excited for the pancakes based off of others' pictures, but I have to say I thought they were a little dry and lacked the flavor I was expecting.  Maybe if they had additional anglaise on the side or between the pancakes it might be a little better.  The waffle was outstanding though, and this is coming from a guy who usually chooses savory brunch over sweet.  I'd happily order it again...and again.  It was perfectly crispy with great flavors and delicious apple filling on top.\\n\\nOverall, we had a good time here, and for brunch, we were really happy.  I get the impression that it might be pretty average food for lunch or dinner, but I can't really say that without having tried it.

Often when you call on the phone there is so much background noise from talking staff and cook equipment that you must shout an order to the person on the other end.

They were also very mindful of telling us the ingredients in case there was any food allergy or dietary concerns (there weren't).

My wife ordered the El Beardo, and then a bloody mary. The waitress specifically asked her if she was Vegan, which she confirmed.

The El Beardo had several stray pieces of vegetarian sausage in it. \\n\\n3.) The El Beardo, while tasty, was very oily. There was a pool of oil that had separated and was sitting on top of everything. This dish should not have that much oil in the first place.\\n\\n4.) The \\"hash\\" part is just shredded potatoes made into hash browns. I typically see hash to be made of cubed potatoes. Either way, they were VERY greasy too. \\n\\n5.)

Again, it's a prime rib house, so not really a big deal to me. I ordered the prime rib extra rare, the 17yr old had a rib eye and the GF had a fish sandwich. Unfortunately the ordering process took about 20 minutes since after dropping off water the server went AWOL for quite some time. She then brought out the wrong glasses of wine,  and completely forgot the 7-up for the 17yr old, then took another 5 min to go get it. \\n\\nIn fact the service was so subpar that in my mind this review was shaping up to be a 2 or 3 star one max. The food saved it.\\n\\nGlossing over the cold & dry garlic mashed potatoes, the meat was truly excellent. The prime rib was in fact rare, served with a great au jus and creamy horseradish. I prefer mine more spicy, but that's a personal thing. It was totally fine. The prime rib was juicy and tender, and the spices they used were very good. It was one of the best prime ribs I've had in some time.\\n\\nThe GF's fish sandwich was fine, and the kid's steak was cooked properly to order and he damn near licked the plate.

There's some stuff inside the sandwich that looks like cole slaw but you actually can't taste it too much so if you hate cole slaw (me), don't worry.

My husband ordered the special, the prime rib, and it was so overcooked, it was dark brown all throughout, and the server tried to play it off like it was our fault for ordering it late in the night when it had been sitting for an hour!?! Bizarre. My husband never does this but he did accept the offer for a tenderloin instead, it came back RAW. Finally, a manager intervened, cooked it himself, and it was fine and he gave it to us on the house. That was classy. However, I left both receipts behind and someone wrote in an extra $20.51 tip for themselves. I have been too busy to call and get the charges reversed and noticed it a little late, but I won't ever be going back."},{"name":"House of Blues Boston Restaurant & Bar","address":"15 Lansdowne St","city":"Boston","stars":"2","text":"The restaurant is mediocre at best.  Service was slow even though it looked like the runners were constantly moving.  A few friendly faces including our waiter but most of the staff just seemed annoyed to be there.  Portion size was all over the place.  The house salad was huge while the $8 bowl of chili was only a small cup.  I was honestly shocked when the chili came out- the runner even asked who had the \\"side\\" of chili.

A swing and a miss!"},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"No idea why I'm even attempting to add my voice to the chorus of reviews for Magnolia Cafe, only that I've been coming here since 1994 (just prior to moving here), and it's as much a staple of my life as it is a staple of the Austin experience.\\n\\nWhenever I have out of town visitors, this is one of the \\"must visit\\" places I make a point of bringing them to, and a few repeat visitors insist on return trips, especially for the gingerbread pancakes.\\n\\nMost of my experience here has either been late-night or early morning -- I've got scant experience or information on mid-afternoon or early evening dining here, but the times I have hit MC during those times, I'm happy that it's still the same MC I've come to love.\\n\\nService -- I'm not ever had a bad experience with the staff here. Sure, it gets CRAZY BUSY during peak times (weekend mornings, closing time at area bars), but if you are a party of one or don't mind sitting out back, I've never had to wait too terribly long.\\n\\nThere is a certain amount of ambivalence to the waitstaff, but that's always been the case here, it's part of the allure, and it's kind of kept me coming back year after year -- I don't want a conversation, I don't want a whole lot of interaction -- I come in, check the menu in instant, order my drink, order my food, bing bang boom I'm done and walking out the door no longer hungry.\\n\\nI've found staff here to be consistently patient, even indulgent, when having to deal with drunken patrons or tempermental tourists. And I'm a regular enough patron that a few staff know my morning order -- coffee with 4 creamers, glass of water, The Economical with scrambled eggs, a side of sausage, home fries and an English muffin. I may surprise them and mix it up with whole wheat toast! Point is, we don't exchange names or life stories -- I order my food, they bring me my food, I eat my food, I tip them 30-40% because they're terminally overeducated and underemployed, and we all go about our day none the worse for the experience.\\n\\nFood -- it's cheap. Never bad, always good, sometimes superb (especially if you come in for dinner specials, which I'd say are quite stellar the handful of times I've ventured here for dinner). Depending on number of patrons, quality can be inconsistent -- sometimes the home fries are undercooked, sometimes it looks like only one egg was used -- but a quick \\"excuse me\\" to a passing waitstaff will resolve the issue.\\n\\nAmbiance -- it's largely been unchanged since 1994. Revolving art for sale from local artists grace the wall. Funky things hang from the ceiling. I think at some point they updated the tables, but I may be mistaken -- they may still be the same tables and seats from 19 years ago, already old at that point. You can get cool calendars at the end of the year. It's dingy, it's dark. I like it. It's a good place to people watch, regardless of hour. Hipsters mix with rockers, commies mix with families, rednecks mix with Bohemians. It's all good.\\n\\nOver-all takeaway -- besides Lovejoys (RIP), Magnolia Cafe South is one of the anchors of my Austin experience, and has been since 1994. It's stayed remarkably true and consistent, with little changes every so often to keep up with the times (back patio, better parking, beer and wine) without sacrificing what Magnolia means to me. I know what to expect when I go to Magnolia, and I've never been disappointed. And the surprises have been enough that I still get giddy walking through the doors, wondering what will hit me next.\\n\\nTips for folks? If you come during a peak time, plan for a wait and for the noise. That's why I often make it a point to wake up at 4am, drive into town, and get here by 5am -- I've got the place virtually to myself most times, other times other early-morning regulars straggle in and get their usual morning grub.\\n\\nAlso, don't be afraid to eat here alone, or out back on the patio. At least now it's covered and comfortable most of the year.\\n\\nThe OOOOOOOONLY thing I'll knock about Magnolia is the lack of wifi service. Then again, sometimes being off the net for 30-45 minutes is a good thing, and a reminder of the pre-smartphone, pre-wifi days of Austin, a reminder that Magnolia Cafe still remembers from whence it came."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I live in the North End and always walk by this restaurant.

Well our drink orders had already been placed once we sat down so we felt obligated to stay. So we ended up spending $115 on a two entrees and one drink each. Totally not worth it!!!

It's pretty heavy food so I actually like that the portion sizes are a little more reasonable.\\n\\nLOGISTICS\\n*There was a line out the door and around the corner when we got there around 10:15, but it moved pretty quickly because they take orders at the counter and then everyone just sits down where they can.

The others were GREAT, but one... I don't know, maybe it was just because of the Sunday rush, but she was pretty rude. As we were finishing up, wanted to order another biscuit or two (they're that good) and the guy who came by said I could just slip in at the line and take care of it quickly rather than wait for a while.\\n\\nBut, strangely, the girl at the register told me it would take 15 minutes (eh?) but I was willing to wait. The weirdest thing was that another gal walked by and was like, oh, I can grab those now, but the girl at the register told her NOT to. Wha? Shrugged it of...  Then, I came back a while later to wait for the biscuits, girl #2 was like, are you seriously still waiting? She looked over at girl #1 who (it seems like) gave her PERMISSION to give me 2 biscuits (that were obviously already ready and just chilling in the oven/counter/wherever).

I've been patronizing this location since before it was Refuge.  I'll often sit here and write for hours.  The baristas are usually friendly, and the food and coffee are good to great (depending on what you order).  I can vouch for the fact that I've eaten the food hundreds of times at this point and have never gotten anything close to food poisoning (I feel like that term gets abused by reviewers on this site in general and I just had to say that), other than maybe a stomach ache from eating too many delicious eggplant fries. \\n\\nI have to put my foot down though.  As a former barista, I can make fantastic cappuccino on my dirt-cheap espresso machine at home.  I can make an exact replica of an Allston Sunrise sandwich in my apartment, no problem.  The reason I go to a coffee shop to work is to change the scenery a little bit.  \\n\\nBut if I can't get any work done because the Wi-Fi is down, there was really no point in me leaving the house....or in not choosing one of the 10 other coffee shops around that DO have functional, reliable Wi-Fi (though don't get me started on Pavement's pay-to-use b.s...I was a bi-daily Espresso Royale customer for 4 years and have never looked back since they became Pavement and started charging to use the internet).  \\n\\nNote how I said \\"reliable\\" and not \\"blazing fast\\": bandwidth doesn't have to be anything special, but during business hours, network uptime should be 99.9%, not 20%. I'm pretty sure even my basic home internet & router would be fast enough to handle 50 people simultaneously screwing around on Facebook. \\n\\nThis has been going on for months.  In the past month alone, I've been there almost every day, and there has not been a single day where it worked the entire time I was there (fortunately I didn't always have computer work to do).  This happens regardless of how many people there are in the shop: it works just as poorly with 3 people as it does when the shop is packed, which makes me think it's something wrong with your router, not your internet subscription.  \\n\\nTo the owners: \\n\\nThere is too much competition for you to not address this issue -- you can blame Starbucks (or In House, or Blue state....) for setting the bar and always having reliable, free wi-fi, or you can blame our culture for needing to be always hooked in.  But if I'm going to pay 3 dollars for a coffee instead of making it myself for 10 cents, there has to be something to sweeten the deal.  You have everything but this going for you. \\n\\nI can't patronize your establishment again until this is fixed.  I'm going to start checking before I set foot inside, and each time I walk away, you're down a coffee and a meal in sales.  One average person spends as much as $1092 a year on coffee.  I'm probably above average, and once you factor in food, that's quite a sum.  And I'm sure I'm not the only one who is turned off by lack of reliable internet.  So it may seem like a lot to buy a new router and upgrade your service, but if you get my business back, that alone should cover it.\\n\\nI love this place, but a \\"hang-out\\" coffee shop like Refuge is only as good as its Wi-Fi."},{"name":"Tin Lizzy's Cantina","address":"77 12th St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"First visit, of many more to come.

So we went on a hungry Sunday around noon with an open mind...\\n\\n\\"Good brunch option\\" doesn't even begin to cover it!\\n\\nLocation/Atmosphere: 4/5. Nice location on Hawthorne. The vibe inside was not-quite casual, but definitely laid back and eclectic. Even though the restaurant was crowded, it didn't seem particularly loud. My only critique is that it was a little confusing at first to figure out how to get a table, since there are several entrances. \\n\\nService: 3/5. The wait was not terrible for a Sunday at noon--less than 30 minutes. However, once we were seated we waited over 10 minutes before anyone to even looked at our table. I understand that Sunday is prime brunch day, but it did seem to be an oversight. I don't think our server knew she was assigned to our table...Once she did arrive to take our orders, the rest of the service was prompt and kind. Her recommendations were excellent, as well.\\n\\nFood: 5/5. I got a wrap called \\"The Other One\\"...It was the most perfect breakfast sandwich I've ever tasted. The hash browns were just the right amount of buttery and salty. The portion size was quite large, and about halfway through my meal I was stuffed...But I HAD to finish, it was just that good!

Spent the early evening walking around from bar to bar trying to shake the disappointment of Cheers from my mind and then resorted to Yelp for a dinner suggestion.  Neptune was the first highly rated spot to pop up, so we poked our heads in. The lady at the door told us it would be 90 minutes, which seemed like a lot on a random Thursday evening especially when my entire time in Boston was limited to about 28 hours. I was ready to leave, but my boss decided we should put our name on the list. It was moments like this where I understand completely how he got to be where he is.\\n\\nThe food here is amazing. The oyster varieties were all interesting- one tasted of cantaloupe of all things - and incredibly fresh. The real showstopper though is the warm lobster roll. Sure, it would be hard to bathe a lobster in warm butter and not enjoy the taste, but this was incredible. The bread was perfectly crusty. The butter wasn't excessive to the point of making my hands greasy, and the price wasn't altogether unreasonable.  But the real driver behind this 5 star review is that I have woken up on three seperate occassions thinking of this sandwich. As ridiculous as that sounds, it's absolutely the truth.  \\n\\nWe sat at the bar, and the server/bartender was so friendly too, and the type to make a point of asking and learning every patron's name. \\n\\nHonestly, I can't even complain about the wait because the experience was so good."},{"name":"Scampo","address":"215 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I've been here on several occasions & most recently we celebrated my dear brothers birthday dinner celebration here given the great experiences the first few times. The ambiance is chic, modern, and lively. The space is not too small, but not too large by any means, making it an intimate space. The open kitchen is a nice touch. And what better than to celebrate a birthday in a former jailhouse?\\n\\nWe started off ordering a bunch of appetizers:\\nCalamari ($18): one of the most expensive and mediocre calamari I've ever had. It was mushy and soggy, there were no crunch or crispiness at all.\\n\\n\\"Best\\" mussels in winter ($18): do not let the name fool you, it's certainly not the best mussels, but also the most expensive mussel dish I've ever had, as well. It was very bland and not special, portions were tiny.\\n\\nTandoori fired large sea scallops ($21): The scallops were indeed very large, but it tasted very bland. There were no char or sear on it to give it that flavor and slightly crisp surface texture.\\n\\nLobster pizza ($28): Thankfully this dish semi-saved us from an otherwise disastrous appetizer course. It was hands down the best dish of the night. All of the ingredients from the succulent lobster, heavy cream, shallots, garlic to the distinct ricotta salata and parmesan all mashed perfectly for a scrumptious 10\\" pie that Chef Lydia Shire deservingly gets recognition for.\\n\\nFor the main course, I was able to try:\\nSpaghetti Bolognese ($28) : It was good, but did not amaze me, I was hopefully it would. From the pasta to the sauce & grounded meat, it was all very standard.\\n\\nChilean sea bass ($39): Perhaps it was our mistake for not asking, but I think the Chilean sea bass was actually steamed! Blasphemy if you ask me. It's a very fatty fish, thus a pan-sear would be the best way to cook it to give a nice crisp flavor and texture to the surface to offset the fattiness. But instead, fattiness and smooth texture from the steaming just made it taste extra fatty and mushy. And to add to it, it was very bland and not well-seasoned, if at all.\\n\\nBraised short rib ($36): very standard, it was fall-of-the-bone tender, but did not \\"wow\\" me. It was a bit under-seasoned.\\n\\nNone of us ordered dessert as we were full. We had notified the server that it's my brother's birthday and we selected a slice of tiramisu cake for him. The cake itself was tasty. Though, it was slightly offputting that they did not comp the slice of birthday cake, I've never been charged for cake before on a birthday occasion. It would have been a nice gesture, especially given we spent close to $90/person & the cake itself probably cost less than $1.00 to make. Meh.\\n\\nThe server for the table next us spilled beer on my brothers coat as she tried to squeeze by another server without notifying him. She apologized, but did not offer anything. We could have been an asshole about it & asked for discounts, but we did not want to cause a scene and wanted to give the restaurant a chance to be proactive to rectify. Nothing, oh well.\\n\\nSeveral of us were also given menus that did not reflect the correct prices of the pasta dishes as they were priced on appetizer and dinner portions. Conveniently, there was only the appetizer price on my menu and I only found out about the price after I had ordered.\\n\\nIn summary, we had a great time with great company at Scampo in a fantastic atmosphere and decent enough service with mediocre, overly-expensive food."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We arrived at 5:30 and didn't have a problem getting a window booth in the bar.

I've had the 10 oz angus filet mignon cooked medium and the steak was cooked perfectly (cooked enough with a pink center).

Also, the ahi tuna appetizer was seared perfectly.

We usually fill them out and get a thank-you postcard from the waiter.  ... Not impressed, Italian Kitchen.

Can't stress enough how important this is. Some burrito places don't understand that just because someone is vegetarian doesn't mean that a random hodge-podge cocktail of vegetables in a burrito makes sense to us. Broccoli is an iffy choice. Celery is a terrible one. Pepino's is one of the places that understand this. Here there are onions, yellow squash, bell peppers, and potato and you will be both relieved and happied by this assortment.\\n\\n5- Guacamole isn't way over priced!

Uncooked fish and a buffet are not the best combination when tables are not being able to be turn around fast enough. Only half of the tables were filled in the restaurant  for the three hours we were in there (no, we were not spending all the time eating, it was just friends who hadnt seen each other for years). Have that said, , the salmon and tuna looks relativity fresh, although the portion were small (more on that later). There was one Hirame that has a weird gummy texture which concerned me.  \\n\\nAs other have pointed out, there were not enough foods available. More than 50% of the plates were empty, and the remaining plates only had 5 to 6 piece on them. People behind the counter were preparing sushi, but for the time that I was there, I didn't see they brought out anything they have prepared.  The question for the night was, why did they prepare those sushi and didn't bring it out? It made made wonder how fresh the sushi on my plates are. The second thing that fails Maki Maki's quest to meet Minado's standard is, Sushi at, Maki Maki are tiny, I am not even going to call it small portion, \\"tiny\\" is the correct word to use.Sushi such as  Maguro Nigiri  are the size of my thumb. Some people call it cute, I just think it is pathetic when the restaurant charges $30 a person, and try to get away with tiny/mini size sushi, and empty plate. \\n\\nWould I go there again? Most likely I will not. The food I got for the time we were in there does not meet the high price I paid.

Each time they brought the other customers food out they looked at me, I looked at them with the \\"do you know where my food is look\\" but that didn't seem to help.

I would've thought that since they all saw me sitting there since which seemed like 200 BC without saying anything I would be at least issued a \\"my bad\\", but after what seemed like an interrogation and a long look at my receipt they finally started on my order.

How does that even happen in a fast food place?! \\n\\nThe service is the SLOWEST THING EVER. \\nWhich sucks, because all of the employees I have spoken to are really nice! They're friendly and helpful and everything. I do not understand why they're so slow. The past 3 times I have gone were terrible. The first two times, I waited at the drive through for TWENTY MINUTES before anyone said a single word. Even just a \\"Hello, I'll be right with you\\" would be acceptable. But it was so long that the first time, i actually drove up to the window to make sure they were open! When I drove around, I found TWO employees sitting out back smoking, and one person inside that was visible through the window. \\n\\nThen after driving back around to the drive through order box thing, I waited for 15 more minutes before anyone said anything still! \\n\\nToday, I went inside, because I thought it might be slightly faster (perhaps they can't easily tell when someone is at the drive through?

The hot dog was missing all the peppers (which are like one of only 3 ingredients...) And I had ordered a pineapple raspberry slush, and when they gave me was some bitter club soda tasting crap with actual chunks of mushy pineapple floating in it.  It was not slushy. it was disgusting.\\n\\nI really hate to leave such a bad review, because the hot dogs are always amazing, and the burgers are usually decent too. The drinks are usually delicious! \\nSo, when the food is made the way it's asked for, it's GREAT!

My favorite, surprisingly, was the shrimp roll (never even had a shrimp roll before), but the lobster roll and the crab roll were equally as delicious. There isn't much in terms of service, since it's not a service-based joint. You just pick up your tray from the front counter and eat.\\n\\nCons - Way too expensive for the quantity that they give you. I understand Boston is an expensive city, but that doesn't mean you can make everything ridiculously expensive. Take note that the rolls are not what you think they are - they aren't full rolls, like the pictures suggest. The actual size is a roll about the size of just the palm of your hand (about 1/2 to 1/3 of a roll). They try to fill this roll up as best as possible, but you really can't put much meat in a tiny, tiny roll like this.\\n\\nAlso, I originally did not even want rolls, since most lobster rolls I've had give way too much bread and skimp like crazy on the lobster. I just wanted a full, steamed lobster, but they don't offer this on their menu (not sure why not?). So just know that if you come here, you CANNOT get a full steamed lobster.\\n\\nOverall verdict - the quality of the food was great - fresh and delicious, but the price and quantity of the food made this joint less than a great value."},{"name":"RusTeak Restaurant & Wine Bar","address":"1568 Maguire Rd","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I are very happy there is an establishment in the windermere/gotha/ocoee area that isn't a chain.

We ordered a few mezze dishes, drinks, and an entree. The lobster lettuce wrap and calamari were decent, but portion size even for tapas was embarrassing. If tapas are meant to be shared, how can you do that with one lettuce wrap? We also ordered the eggplant chips and asked for no breading of any sort due to allergies and it came out with breading. The chef was unwilling to make it without breading and they still charged us for the dish we didn't want or eat. Most importantly, beware of the bavette steak entree priced at $29. The meat looked and tasted of poor quality and was only three slices. We took a bite and didn't finish it. For $10 more we could have gotten a nice filet at a steakhouse. If you can't make a steak, then don't put it in your menu. I also asked for a salad in place of the potatoes that came with the steak, and that was a mistake b/c they do not know how to make a dressing. They also forgot the mushrooms.

I've been here three times total but it had been a couple years since my last time.\\n\\nFirst things first.  You'd be better off bringing your own bag of Tostitos as the chips are terrible.  Perhaps those chips would be good in some other city in the middle of nowhere but not in Austin, TX.  The salsa tastes like it was dumped out of a bottle from HEB as well.\\n\\nFor entrees we had the Chile Relleno en Nogada and the Enchiladas de Mole.  The Chile Relleno was decent but nothing too great.  This is why I went back.  I remember liking it a couple of years ago so wanted to try it out again.  It's probably one of the best things on the menu but it's not that great.\\n\\nThe enchiladas were kind of boring.  The pulled chicken inside was quite dry and the mole was pretty underwhelming as well. \\n\\nMy main problem with this place, besides the food sucking, is the price.  Both of those entrees were $17.  How do you serve $17 entrees and give out chips/salsa so bad you know you can get better at HEB?   I've got no problem paying $50 for a meal that is good.  Unfortunately that is not the case here.\\n\\nI don't think anyone from Austin eats at Manuel's.

For celiacs and vegans, this will probably be sad news because just about everything is gluten-free, and most of the menu is vegan.\\n\\nIt's a cosy place with Himalayan decor that sets it a notch or two above a hole-in-the-wall. Maybe it's because the place is in it's final days and staffing is tricky when you're closing, they were busy on the floor and understaffed. Expect to have to call out to get someone's attention, and to have to be proactive about getting your bill. Best to just get off your ass and approach someone at the counter, really.\\n\\nAaloo Achaar ($7) Chilled sesame-lemon potato salad flavoured with timmur (Himalayan peppercorns) and fenugreek. Served with chiuraa (crunchy beaten rice lightly toasted).\\n-Chiuraa is like tasteless cornflakes. Curious to try but I wouldn't order something just to get some. You could probably get away with asking for a tiny sample.\\n-Also comes with a super-hot chili on the side (thankfully). This chili is good for being spicy-hot, but also not leaving a burning sensation / lingering aftertaste on your tongue.\\n-There's lemon?\\n-Interesting combo with the sesame, but overall, I wouldn't order this again.\\n\\nCurries - Served with basmati rice. Your choice of spiciness.\\n-If you don't tell them they may not ask what level of spiciness you want. We went with \\"very hot (just like Nepal)\\" and it was maybe medium spicy compared to Indian or south-east asian places.\\n-I asked for my rice to be swapped with roti. I got four wedges of roti. Not a good deal, but useful if you don't want too much starch in your dinner.\\n-Curry flavourful but on the watery side. It did NOT taste watery, it just was not as thick as, say, Indian style curry.\\n\\nPotato Curry ($12) Taamaa - lightly seasoned potatoes simmered in bamboo shoots and black-eyed peas.\\n-This curry was OK. Not too much flavour contribution except from the seasoned potatoes, though.\\n\\nChicken Curry ($13) Kukhuraako Maasu - boneless chicken simmered in a curry of onions and spices.\\n-Pretty decent for chicken curry.\\n-I didn't see or taste much contribution from the onions.\\n\\nGoat Curry ($15) Khasiko Maasu - piquant goat meat in curry sauce.\\n-Dark and flavourful curry. Of the three I tried, this would be the best one.\\n\\nCurry Combo\\n-You can have your curry in a combo for about $5 more. You get slightly less curry (maybe 20%-30% less?) in a smaller dish, but you also get daal (lentil soup), rice, roti, and a bit of radish chutney.\\n-Not really sure this is a great deal to be honest. Basically it's lentil soup plus roti for $5."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great views of Portland and a fantastic Happy Hour menu!

Seriously one of the BEST meals I have ever had. I am so thankful I got to experience Little Bird while I was in Portland. Make a reservation - the restaurant is small and intimate, so good to plan in advance. Of note, you need to call and verbally confirm 24 hours in advance... no joke. For larger parties, they require a credit card to make the reservation that will be charged per head for no shows according to the website. I found out about Little Bird based on the recommendation of a friend of a friend who is local and was asked to give me foodie friendly suggestions. The restaurant also was highly endorsed by my bartender at Portland City Grill, a great pre or post dinner drink spot if the weather is conducive to a view, but that's a different story. My server was super friendly and the meal was very well paced. I started with the gnocchi and after one bite was literally ready to stick my face in the plate. The gnocchi is cooked and then pan seared with a tasty sauce and carrots. Out of this world flavor. For my main, I opted for the hanger steak with fries. Amazing, amazing, amazing! Steak done perfectly to my specifications and fries were just the right size! The sauce was a great compliment to both. Good side of fresh bread with butter with sea salt as well. I rounded out the meal with the fork and knife ice cream sandwich - a nice cherry on top to an amazing meal! Great mix of textures and flavors, including the blackberries and basil. I highly recommended the gnocchi to a guy two tables over and then my dessert to the couple at the table on my other side who turned out to be from Austin as well. The wine list is also strong. I can't say enough good things about Little Bird and already suggested it to my Aunt who is heading to Portland soon. Prices were extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food.

Monday wait was still about 45 minutes. Not a big deal, the Modern Bakery is right around the corner for cannoli goodness.\\n  45 minutes later, a harried waitress seated us at the worst seat in the restaurant -- at the tail end of the bar, next to the bathroom and the chlorine-spewing dishwasher. That's fine, we can deal.\\n\\n  Then we waited for the bartender, who was apparently the manager on staff to wait on us. 20 minutes later, after several attemped mild-mannered flagdowns, we finally had our drink and raw-bar order taken. In that time, the chatty couple next to us were finally served (after 40 minutes, they said). Then half-way through their dinner, their much-awaited appetizer arrived. When they complained, saying not only was the dish far too late, but that they tried to flag down the bartender twice to cancel the order... the bartender argued with them for several minutes that they should still take it.\\n\\n  40 minutes later, we received our oysters -- easily the highlight of the evening. They were exactly as described on the order card -- tasting like the distilled essence of the ocean. When the bartender dropped them off, we joked with him that it looked like the kitchen must have been short staffed, expecting a slower Monday. He gruffly said 'No, this is a normal Monday, and we have the same staff as normal.'\\n\\n  25 minutes later came the clam chowder. It wasn't terrible -- was even pretty good, if under salted, potatoes under-cooked and almost crunchy. At least it was real New England style, with a creamy, but non-flour-pasty thick broth. \\n  10 minutes later (and an hour and a half after we sat down), I finally received my much-awaited lobster roll. Toasted roll... butter... hot lobster.\\n\\n  ...What a let-down.\\n\\n  The lobster was OK. Far less sweet than a northern Maine crustacean, and a bit on the tough side. There was plenty of it, and it was drenched in butter over a toasted bun. But... The bun was a non-descript semi-sweet roll. And the butter was unsalted, and the lobster meat cooked without salt or ocean water. So the whole of it was more of an oily-slobbery pile of rubbery lobster... However, when I was finally able to flag down the bartender after another 5 minutes for salt, I was able to eat the rest of the roll with at least a modicum of flavour.\\n  On the other hand, the fries were far over-salted, and a quarter of them over-cooked unto charred.\\n\\n  All in all, not a great experience.

I heard so much about this joint so when I got off the plane, I headed straight there. \\n\\nIt's located in the Art District so you're surrounded by art murals, and hipster looking shops. It's a walk in only place where you order at the front and they give you a number. The venue itself is pretty small so the line wrapped around outside. I suggest calling in first to see how long the wait is because it can take up to 30 or more minutes. \\n\\nOnce you're inside, you'll notice the seating is pretty limited but thankfully they have an outdoor patio with a roof so if it's raining, they got you covered. \\n\\nAlso, BEER IN OREGON IS SO CHEAP! Alcohol is less than 5 bucks compared to LA where everything is 6 bucks or more. \\n\\nWhat my table ordered:\\n\\nCajun Fries: Pretty bomb! It's actually kind of spicy which is surprising because most places I go too they concentrate more on the seasoning salt than the spice. However, the seasoning did remind me of those spicy ramen packaged powder so that's probably why I liked it.\\n\\nThe Chatfield: Okay, I LOVE APPLES! so of course apple butter with biscuits and fried chicken and cheese sounded bomb to me. It was a good mixture of savory and sweet but if you're someone who doesn't like apply butter then I suggest something else. They're pretty generous here with he apple butter so the flavor is pretty dominate. \\n\\nThe Reggie: This is supposedly the house favorite! I can definitely see why because you have your biscuit, bacon, fried chicken, and cheese all topped off with gravy. It's a great southern type meal. They have a deluxe where you add an egg, but tbh, it was bomb overall. \\n\\nHashups: A large plate of hash browns with meat, cheese, onions, and mushrooms. This was really good but it's definitely a meal in itself. \\n\\nBourbon Caramel Cinnamon Roll: THIS! on a cold rainy day, this was amazing with coffee. Not one of the best cinnamon rolls I ever had, but it was good. \\n\\n\\nThe downside to this place is that they don't have sides with their famous biscuit sandwich meals. I was a little bummed that it didn't come with fries, or fruit or ANYTHING but I guess that's just how they flow. \\n\\nAlso, they hand make all their own biscuits.

The food is a bit better than the coffee, but both are good, and I like that's it no frills. Reliable stuff if you're hungry or tired.\\n\\nAlso 4 stars for *food-related* customer service. I'm as un-hip and milquetoast as it gets and never got any condescension or anything like that. The people who work here seem nice.\\n\\nSeriously, though, 0 stars for the freaking music, which is so bad that it reflects terrible customer service. Jesus Christ. I get that this place is popular with The Kids with their Rock Music and Blue Jeans, and it's not their fault that I hate hard rock and indie stuff. But they really need to turn the volume down - as I'm writing this, I can barely hear my music over headphones at full-blast, though I can certainly hear the generic punk track, which I'm assuming is by a band whose name alone will make me want to smack them.\\n\\nEven on its own merits, the music is really hit-or-miss. Often it's at least interesting, occasionally quite good; other times it reminds me of bands from high school.\\n\\nMore to the point, the music seems designed to weed out people who don't strongly identify with white middle-class youth culture, sort of a Bizarro World version of the places that play classical music to discourage punk kids from loitering. It's incredibly obnoxious. These reviews seem to blend into social commentary about hipsters and young white people, so I'll add my bit: Refuge Cafe is a monument to the closed-mindedness of many youths who call Allston home."},{"name":"Clerys","address":"113 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Best grilled cheese I've ever had hands down...

We were seated right away, but it did take a while for anyone to come over, both to drop off menus and to take our drink orders. But after that beginning snag, our waiter was generally attentive and we didn't have any major bring-the-check issues like last time.\\n\\nOur meal began with some delicious cocktails, which were pricey ($11) but strong/good. Then on to a complementary amuse of tomato-coconut soup, which I found really tasty. We decided to stick to the traditional Indian menu (mainly because the fusion menu is waaaaaay too expensive for the likes of us). For an app, we ordered garlic naan, and as my entree I got the veggie kofta balls ($15) and the boy got the goat special curry ($17?), which came with a big side of rice to share between the two of us. It bothered me that the naan came out after our entrees, and it didn't really taste as garlicy as I'd like. My nutty balls (hehe) were tasty, although I only got 3 smallish balls and a ton of sauce (note: the balls themselves have a bit of a kick, I bit into something that made me cough and my eyes water). The boy liked his goat fine, but it wasn't anything super impressive. Although I was stuffed at the end of the meal thanks to the rice, portions were still quite small for the price ($5 per ball, really?).\\n\\nService was better this time, and the food is still generally tasty plus the manager obviously cares about customer service, so I'm moving my rating up to 3 stars... I wouldn't have any major qualms coming back here as long as I didn't have anywhere to be after and I had some sort of gift certificate or got some kind of great deal.

I have given it many chances.  Here comes the review! \\n\\nGood selection of beers. Bar is perpetually packed.  I still don't understand why \\"BBQ\\" restaurants in Boston feel the need to have Belgian beers and fancy-ass cocktails.  They do not go with pulled pork.  I will have a high life or a glass of tea (preferably the later).\\n\\nThe restaurant is too popular for unknown reasons (BBQ, how unique!).  The restaurant knows this. They will do all they can to pack the tables and turn them over quickly.  My last experience included being scolded by our waiter for missing the fourth member of our party.  I actually had \\"cleared\\" this with the hostess: the last person was not eating (we ordered right away) and as far as I could tell there were no three-person-only tables in the house.  At the end of our meal we were told to settle up because a six-person party needed our table.\\n\\nThe food is bad.  I am from North Carolina and I really love pulled pork, pork ribs, BBQ slaw and vinegary sauces.  The pork ribs that I am familiar with are slow cooked and fall off the bone.  I mean this quite literally; if you go to pick up the rib and you move too quickly you will pull up just a white bone.  The ribs I had here had been \\"starter-sliced\\" so I could more easily tear them apart.  I almost laughed. They were tough.  They gave you three different sauces that were so overpowering they could mask the flavor of poo.  Believe it or not, the ribs that I remember are tasty without any sauce.  Pulled pork should not come in a tomatoey saucey goop, by default.  The pork should be dry-rubbed, slow cooked, pulled and served.  If you want something to sauce it up, do what you like. \\n\\nThe decor is a joke, but it doesn't really affect my rating.  BBQ in New England still seems to require a theme park feel.  Restaurants in the NC (really, I have only ever had BBQ in NC in a quick efficient counter service fashion) do not have quirky signs (at least *inside* the restaurant) and they do not serve drinks in Mason Jars; we have figured out the latest beverage holding technology.  \\n\\nSo to summarize:  Redbones is not the best BBQ (even in Boston, Blue Ribbon and Soul Fire are much better).  It is not representative of NC-style BBQ (can't speak for Texas, but if it is Texas-style, then Texas-style sucks).  Sauces should NOT be required.   Mason jars are stupid.  Chimay Triple does not go with pulled pork."},{"name":"Rose & Crown Dining Room","address":"1510 N Avenue Of The Stars","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Our lunch at Rose & Crown Dining Room was mostly a pleasant one.

We got a chocolate cake and a Jafa cake, but I don't remember being crazy about either one. \\n\\nThe service here was poor. Our server, Katy-Sue was gone for long periods of time which was a little disappointing. We experienced better service at all the other country pavilions we ate at (Italy, Japan, France and Norway), so it was sad that on our last day and meal at EPCOT that the service was not good. It also delayed us from getting more time in the park on our last day, which we were not happy about. The positive review is for the food though, which we enjoyed!

I should also throw in there that they have milkshakes/frappes, smoothies, and pints of ice cream and ice cream cakes that you can take home. (I even saw one ice cream cake that was gluten free.)\\n\\nThe staff is also very generous -- they let my husband and me sample several flavors, as well as their agave-based gummy bears. While I could still taste the coconut flavor in their Honey Lavender and Strawberry flavors, I didn't find this in some of the other flavors I tried. Their Salted Caramel and Dark & Stormy flavors are phenomenal. They're not just good for coconut ice cream -- they are good for any type of ice cream period. Additionally, I tried their Thai Chili Peanut. While I'm not a huge peanut person, the flavors were incredible in this as well -- very peanut buttery with a bit of heat at the end.

If you don't know what you want right away, but know your drinks right off the bat, order that, by the time the return, you should know what you want.  Order by number, it's how they memorize everything.  Read quickly based on meat or vegetable or if you want soups or noodles.  It's a fairly simple menu system.  Don't ask what something is unless you really don't know.  Their descriptions are quite good on their menu.  If your tea is out, lift the lid up and they'll refill it, and when you are done with your food, just set it near the edge.  It's how their service works.  If' it is crazy packed, just pay the cashier up at front, it's what you are supposed to do.\\n\\nI've always loved this place for the experience and the food.

Ten minutes later, I leave full but not thrilled. \\n\\nI really wish I could use my Jedi mind powers to make One Taco turn into One Hell of a Taco. But alas. That is not the case. Instead, I will eat breakfast tacos that aren't amazing, but aren't traumatically horrible. Yes, they're a little overpriced. In their defense, that is how this city seems to roll. Maybe it's how we stay on the \\"fittest cities in America\\" lists every year: no one can afford to eat entire meals at these prices, so we just nosh a little bit instead.\\n\\nBottom line: fried egg breakfast tacos are fine to eat every so often. The small containers of green salsa and red, possibly chipotle salsa that get tucked in the bag are flavorful and suitable for smothering your tortillas in. I am thankful that you can build the taco from the tortilla up (black beans, refried beans, meats, cheeses, potatoes, three kinds of egg options, three tortilla options). \\n\\nOther tacos (what is that, lunch tacos? dinner tacos? I still don't know) are also not horrendous as long as you avoid anything with their overwhelming chipotle \\"One Taco\\" sauce. Please stop putting creamy, disturbingly mayonnaise-esque sauces on tacos, for the love of all that is holy. \\n\\nWould I eat here again? yes, but only because I work 3 blocks from here and there's no sign of any new, improved establishments opening their doors  (or more likely their Airstream windows) in the near future.\\nDon't make a trip downtown specifically for One Taco, but don't run screaming in the opposite direction either."},{"name":"Happy Lamb Hot Pot","address":"4755 Kingsway, Ste 200","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"Famous chain store from China, good quality food.

I received my drink right away but it took another 20 minutes for me to receive my sandwich and I basically had to leave 3/4 of it uneaten because I had to wait so long for my food.

So we chose this place since it was so close.\\n\\nMy husband and I both had the bacon cheeseburger with fries, an indulgence as we don't usually eat such fattening food but decided to splurge because it was a Disney day. Upon our first bite, my husband gathered up both burgers and went back up to point out how overcooked and chewy they were. At that moment we were both confident that the burgers were not supposed to taste that way and that the problem would be rectified shortly. We requested them to remake the burgers, which they were very nice and understanding about, the staff is friendly. It took about 90 seconds for them to be remade, and we were shocked to see that they use pre-cooked burgers, slap them on the grill until they're sufficiently hot and then give it to you like it's worthy of $9.00. \\n\\nThe taste of the burger was similar to leftovers that have been reheated in a microwave, the burger was not overcooked at least but was a bit rubbery and tasteless anyhow. I added lots and lots of ketchup and ate the lettuce and tomato since they were the only fresh items on the plate. The french fries are also pre-cooked or rewarmed or just old, they were gross and we didn't even bother eating them. Both of us choked down the burgers, (crunchy old bacon is $.50 extra and is so not worth it) simply because we had already asked them to redo our food and that is likely the best that it gets. Also because we were famished from walking around the parks all day, which is likely the only reason anyone ever eats here and it isn't just a deserted area.\\n\\nI find it difficult to believe that the food standards here stand up to any Disney culinary standards whatsoever and I can't believe a manager would approve this gruel as fit for consumption.

My boyfriend likes burgers, and I like to drink, so I figured it would be perfect for date night. I expected a wait, as with any night of the week, but their sign-in system seems really disorganized. I've worked as a restaurant hostess so I am overly critical, but there didn't seem to be any order as to who got a table when, and I signed my own name on the sheet because there wasn't a host around. \\nAnyway, after about 45 minutes we noticed a couple leaving the bar and jumped into their seats. I'd already had a few Blue Moons, but their keg ran dry so I had to switch to Sam Adams Winter Lager. Not bad. \\nThe service was really quick, and the bartenders were cool. We ordered the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, not knowing how much burger we were in for. I had the Western Burger, with bbq sauce, cheddar, onions, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and a huge burger patty. It was awesome and delicious and required a fork and knife and a to-go box for the other half. My boyfriend had the Thurman Burger, which was equally huge and had ham plus a ton of other toppings. We also got fries. Someone behind us got the Thurmanator, but we weren't that ambitious. Maybe next time. \\nDefinitely a place to check out if you don't mind spending a few hours and are really hungry, but don't go if you're in a hurry."},{"name":"Revolution Doughnuts","address":"908 W College Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Hugely overrated donut shop that gets most of its buzz from the fact that Atlanta has very few donut options.

This kind of atmosphere, unfortunately, sometimes seems to come with well realized food.\\nThe crab cake, hard-seared on both sides, square and floating in its sauces was almost transcendent. Except that the sauce was not enduring. I remember nothing about it. \\nThe drop dumplings, more like gnocchi, were chewy and sweet and acidic. Something quite special actually. The favorite for both of us. But, since they arrived after the rich and heavy crab cake, my first two bites were underwhelming. I actually had to adjust to the dish.\\nThe grilled avocado was quite nice. A dish that is so now.

We ordered water and asked if we could have a few minutes to decide, but the server seemed irritated at the fact that we weren't ready.  When he came back with our drink orders he asked if we were ready.  We then ordered and the server kept interrupting us by trying to finish our sentences.  After that, he gathered up our menus and rushed off...not to be seen again until our food arrived- 30 minutes later.

They're cakey rather than flaky, which might be a matter of preference, my grandmother's biscuits were flaky.  More importantly they'd been left sitting around so they were pretty dried out when they got to us.\\n\\nPine State definitely believes in laissez faire dining.  The customers are expected to do everything other than put money in the register and cook the food.  You stand in line to order, you find your own table, you pick up your own food, you bus your own table.  The table we found was dirty because the cashier was also the only person working the floor.  We finally got a wipe down, some time before a customer had to tell the cashier there was no more clean silverware available.  Fail, fail, fail, fail.  Fail.  Fail and fail.\\n\\nSo, the food.  Meh.  No, really.  Meh.\\n\\nI got the Money Ball, doubled down (which means an extra egg).\\n\\nThe biscuits were, as I've said, kinda dried out and heavy to start with.  \\n\\nThe gravy was decent, not capsaicin-y thankfully with plenty of sausage chunks. \\n\\nThe eggs were over easy and sprinkled with paprika, which, what the hell?  What is it with paprika on every freaking thing?  I saw someone's hash browns with the crap on top.  Hashbrowns which I did not get with the Money ball.  For the grand price of seven dollars you get two biscuits, an egg and something that's literally made with the stuff left over from cooking other stuff.  A dollar gets you an extra egg.  Hashbrowns cost two fifty.  \\n\\nThey only have funky bottled pop so I ordered chocolate milk that tasted like they either forgot to put milk in it or made it with baker's chocolate.

Strictly judging them as a Portland restaurant, they're fine, but comparing them to southern food, they are lacking. My husband's from Tennessee and I lived there for 7 years. We are no strangers to biscuits and gravy. He makes biscuits and gravy every now and then, and in my opinion, his is better hands down. So, for me, I will not be waiting in a long line to get a Reggie. \\n\\nAt Pine State the combinations are fun. It's sort of like a Portland twist on Southern food, salty/sweet, late night munchie thing. I'm not really a fan of the sweet biscuit/gravy. It reminds me of North Carolina cooking. Just like NC BBQ is on the sweet side and TN is more on the savory side. You've got some variation in taste for sure and I've got to be in a mood for the sweet stuff.\\n\\nThe Reggie has fried chicken, cheese, and gravy on a biscuit. It's good, but don't let the fried chicken distract you. Fried chicken makes everything taste awesome. The true star in a southern dish like this, is the gravy. Gravy, gravy, delicious gravy. Unfortunately, the gravy didn't wow me. I'm used to gravy that's packed with flavor, chucks of tomato, sausage, Cayenne pepper, black pepper, and sage. Where was the sage? I didn't taste any. The gravy was a little bland to me. I don't even want to know how they make the vegetarian gravy. \\"Southern\\" vegetarian gravy? It's almost sacrilegious. I get it though... It's a Portland thang. I will probably try it anyway just out of curiosity and I do appreciate that they keep my vegetarian friends and my heart health in mind.\\n\\nI would eat here if I was drunk. I would eat here if I was hungover. I would even eat here just because my friends wanted to go. If you haven't developed a strong opinion on how you like your southern food to taste, you will never know the difference... but I'm spoiled and I know what I like. Everybody's tastes are different.

The pancakes were so soft and fluffy, with just a hint of lemon and sweetness. Everyone was in love with these pancakes, highly recommend everyone gives these a try!\\nPotatoes Bravas (full order) ($8): Oof...potatoes with butter and an over-easy egg?! Sign us all up! These potatoes were just amazing. The butter had a unique texture and flavor that really added an extra dimension to your typical potato and egg dish. Highly recommend, although it was kind of heavy!\\nBreakfast Flatbread ($13): Probably our least favorite dish. The cheese made it really heavy without being too distinct. While salty, the flavor wasn't too memorable so I'd recommend skipping.\\nAuntie Paula's French Toast (half order) ($7): While really solid and delicious, it wasn't as memorable as some of the other dishes. A half order came with two half pieces of toast, a perfect size for an appetizer!\\nKorean Fried Chicken ($15): Like the crazy people we are, we ordered 3 orders of the famous Korean Fried Chicken and oh man....SO GOOD. Please do yourself a favor and get this dish! The chicken was tender and perfectly seasoned. Pairs excellently with the kimchi and egg and rice. \\nBim Bop Bacon & Eggs ($13): This is their take on the Korean bibimbop dish, and while not a hit with everyone, it was one of my favorite dishes. This one has bacon and is mixed in with various vegetables and toppings, king of like a fried rice packed with flavor. I'd recommend this one!\\nTasty Hangtown Fry Willapa Bay ($14): A dish with mixed reviews across the table. It had some pieces of fried oyster, egg with gravy, and a biscuit. I think the fried oysters were really unique and good but the rest of the dish was pretty standard brunch stuff.

I ordered the WuBurger (which was essentially a double cheeseburger) which came with waffle fries and ultimately left satisfied.  Both the burger and the fries were cooked fresh and served still steaming (which I certainly appreciated) and the service was prompt and polite (the order only took about 5 minutes to come out).  \\n\\nThe burger was satisfactory and very filling if maybe a little under-seasoned.  I think they must smash the patties on the griddle since both patties were well-crusted but still cooked to medium (they didn't ask for a doneness preference).  The waffle fries though were another story.  Even though they were well-seasoned and served fresh, they still felt heavy and oily.  They could have possibly used some more time to drain, but then again maybe I'm just not a waffle fry kind of guy.\\n\\nThe layout has largely been preserved from back when this building was the location of North by Northeast, so while it's still kind of cozy, WuBurger has made pretty good use of the space (somehow managing to fit in a pretty respectable bar with four taps).  If you order take-out, I would recommend ordering over the phone ahead of time because there doesn't really seem to be a convenient place to stand and wait for your order.\\n\\nOn the subject of value, I paid $11 + tax + tip for my double cheeseburger and fries.  While some may scoff at that price, consider that most pub burgers in Inman (such as those found at The Rising, Atwoods, and The Druid) start at around $12-13.  Now, those joints also each have more space, a larger tap list, and more variety when it comes to the rest of the menu, but WuBurger's pricing is at least comparable if not competitive.  My one request would be that the owners consider adding a single patty version of the burger to the menu for $2 less (like they do at the Woburn location).   The double patty version is just a little much for lunch if I don't want to be in a food coma for the rest of my work day.\\n\\nAlthough this place delivered a solid product, I think they have a lot of competition in the immediate area.  If you're local to the neighborhood, it's definitely worth stopping by to see if you're a fan - but I don't see people flocking from other neighborhoods with similar burger joints (such as Harvard Square or Central).  If I could, I would give this place 3.5/5 stars, but I'll gladly round up because of the great service."},{"name":"Haroo Korean Homestyle Cuisine","address":"8580 Alexandra Road, Suite 2000","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food, and service.

I wanted BBQ but, wasn't sure where to go.  I could've got Bill Miller and been content but, decided to check out Vic's.  First of all, it's on my way home and why not check out places near the hood.  I got there around 30 minutes to closing and met the older ladies who work there, probably for a while/possibly family.  They had the meat in a glass heat box showing it off.  I had a hard time deciding on what to get and opted for the 2 meat plate.  I chose brisket and sausage.  The brisket was whole and she trimmed it up and gave me three HUGE slices of it.  They were smoked nicely, almost black on the exterior but, near brown on the inside, probably overcooked.  She then gave me about 1 1/2 small links of sausage sliced at an odd angle.  It came with 2 slices of bread and pickles and onions and potato salad.  I don't eat potato salad, so i had beans.  The beans were pinto and were spicy, kind of like chili without meat.  They were freaking GOOD!  So i sat at a table alone under the tv showing \\"the best of Chris Farley\\" SNL special. The brisket was super lean, seemingly overcooked and didn't really taste of any spice/seasoning rub.  The sausage was typical Elgin sausage.  The sauce is served on the side and had chunks of onion and vegetables.  It seemed like a lot of money for a little food but, i got full easily.  Not bad food but, not amazing by any means.

The bitchy hostess was discouraging, but I asked if I could check for a spot at the bar. There was plenty of space inside, but few barstools, and none that were unoccupied. So I stood.\\n\\nI discussed food and drink options with a female bartender, and placed an order with her. While waiting for stuff to show up, I walked around the empty bar area, where there were tables with no one at them and no bar stools to be found. Over the course of the next 10-15 minutes, a boss-looking dude watched me stand at the bar, as did a guy who came and set me a place to eat. At this point, as I approached annoyance, the bartender bought out a barstool, apparently from a storage room. This gesture--and the rest of her friendly, attentive service--saved the night.\\n\\nNot that the food wasn't good--it was superb. I had the chicken and waffle, which is comprised of a perfectly moist, very flavorful, pan-fried chicken breast served over half of a crisp and tender Belgian waffle made with smoked flour. This is accompanied by kale two ways (braised and fried) and a teriyaki syrup. The confluence of flavors and textures was remarkable, the whole thing vaguely redolent with lemon, crunchy and meaty and just a bit sweet. It was very, very good.\\n\\n(I will pause here to ask Atlanta to stop frying kale. Seriously, quit it. It's just as good baked, and as a bonus, baked kale does not spill pools of oil in your mouth when you bite into it. That said, this fried kale was less heavy than other iterations I've tried around town.)\\n\\n(I will also pause to place a vote in favor of smoking unexpected food items. This waffle was a revelation.)\\n\\n(That said, I prefer maple syrup on mine.)\\n\\nThe drink I had, a Toronto, was strong and delicious. The company was friendly. The music and the crowd became more insistent--although in a fun way--at around 11. The look of the place is modern but warm, with sleek wood paneling and partitions overlying raw brick walls, and lighting provided by bare Edison bulbs overhead.\\n\\nFor the quality of the surroundings and the grub, the place deserves credit. But for employing only one person who would make eye contact with me and treat me like an actual human customer who wanted to give them money in exchange for food and drink, they deserve a spanking.\\n\\nAlso, as it was my first time here, I'm not sure if the paucity of bar stools was the status quo or just a temporary thing related to the timing of my visit. But during dinner service, that ought to perhaps be reconsidered."},{"name":"Paddlefish Restaurant","address":"1670 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is one of the worst Disney restaurants.

Don't ever go to this restaurant"},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Little Bird's cooking is actually worth better than 2 stars, probably 3 1/2. The demerits are 1 point for general culinary dishonesty, and 1/2 point for snotty service (more on that later). It should be pointed that Little Bird is authentically French in the same way that Taco Time is Mexican, though that in itself does not necessarily portend a bad meal: some local chefs (Nuestra Cocina, Toro Bravo and others) have actually taken a good thing and made it better, even if that is not the case here or at sister restaurant Le Pigeon, whose name has to be a Freudian slip. \\n\\nRucker may be a pretty good cook, even if his technical skills are not as solid as his awards suggest. What he shines at is product design: he knows his audience and skillfully panders to their inchoate tastes and narrow experiential range. Consider the steak tartare: it is larded with unnecessary and inappropriate glucose (as are many other dishes), then doused with vinegar, whose low pH cures (\\"cooks\\") the meat, much like lemon juice \\"cooks\\" fish in ceviche. The end product is essentially a beef ceviche that no longer tastes like meat, but is pleasing and safe to grown-ups with toddler tastes.\\n\\nRucker has a right to compromise his cooking in exchange for business success, and his patrons have a right to the limited frisson of eating raw meat that has been cooked. But Rucker has no right to call cooked beef \\"tartare\\", whether it was cooked by heat or by way of acid-induced protein breakdown. Tartare is raw meat, period. A cooked beef patty is called a hamburger. \\n\\nThe foie gras brulee is another example. It is not foie gras at all, but a soft, cloying custard with more fillers and sugar than foie in it, topped with caramel, topped with an apricot reduction, topped with a small brioche toast. It was bland, sugary and dessert-like. It certainly was not what you think when you think of foie gras, although a reasonably competent attorney could make the argument that it is in fact a foie gras product.\\n\\nThe chicken liver mousse had a curiously silky texture reminiscent of condensed milk. It, too, was vaguely sweet.\\n\\nThe most appalling item we were served was a deep-fried egg. It was a component of an otherwise pretty good but heinously salty salad, which also included the blandest boudin blanc ever. If you think deep-frying an egg is a stupid idea, well, that's because it is. It's the sort of misguided culinary brain fart one has at 3 am when one is stoned and one has a bad case of the munchies. The texture of the thusly defiled farm egg (which might just as well have been a Safeway egg, after what it's been through there's no telling) was oily and fairly gross, and it tasted like the kind of artery-busting snack you get at county fairs. It is characterized in the menu as a \\"crispy egg\\", so that you're fairly in the dark as to what you're getting.\\n\\nAnd that is my biggest issue with Little Bird, that is, the connection between dishes and their descriptions is as loose as a congressman's ethics. You're constantly surprised by the food that lands in front of you, which would be fine with a talented chef in residence, but unfortunately you feel more often blindsided than enchanted in these unsteady hands.\\n\\nOf the two waitresses who helped us, one was great, and the other pretty snotty. She couldn't wrap her head around that fact that anyone could possibly be displeased with the product she delivered (well, she asked). Perhaps a majority of her customers' palates aren't exceedingly discerning.\\n\\nWe did not order any nominal dessert, considering how much sugar had been in our meal.

You pay top dollar for the milieu, not the delivered product.\\n\\nMy experience with Narcoosee at Disney's Grand Floridian supports my Disney Dining generalization.  The restaurant is an attractive building that overlooks the 7 Seas Lagoon.   Service was playful and upbeat - but some of the runners were a bit off.

But finally I gave in to a friend's persuasion and went up there...in the fancy elevator...past the \\"dress code\\" plaque...to the 30th floor. SO worth it! Don't be put-off by the dress code- to me it doesn't seem like a big deal. The atmosphere is clean, the service is really friendly, and obviously the view of our fine city is just amazing. The other folks eating there seemed to be a mix of the societal spectrum, probably people like us who were there for the novelty of it and the good Happy Hour prices. And by the way- as others have mentioned- the Happy Hour deals are awesome- and this is definitely when I recommend you go, if it's your first time- to get a feel for the place. I think their regular menu is considerably pricier.

Waited about an hour for seats; they call 10 min beforehand so we walked around North End a bit. I wasn't a big fan of being placed at the end of the bar with the staff walking back and forth behind us the whole time, but the food made up for it. We ordered oysters (obviously), P.E.I mussels, and the hot lobster roll with a salad. \\n\\nOysters were incredibly fresh and they have a wide selection. Mussels were super tasty with fresh basil. And the lobster roll by far was the best we had in Boston. The roll itself with butter I think makes the lobster roll - hot is the way to go. Packed with meat, we thought it was well worth the price. \\n\\nMy only issue was the server that we had - she seemed super friendly to the other customers but somewhat short with us from the beginning. To me, service is a huge part of the dining experience, which is why I knocked off a star.

When our first two items came out (an additional 15min later) she asked, \\"what else did you get?\\" We told her and she clearly went to the POS and entered the items at that point. 5 min later she came out to tell me they were out of one of the items and brought me the wrong salad.

I had the choice of meat with two sides for $10. The pulled pork was dry and the bread felt like it had been sitting out for at least a day. The coleslaw was alright, there was something off about the texture and it was lacking flavor. The saving grace? THE POTATO SALAD WAS DIVINE. The creamy smooth texture, crunch of the dill and onions, and scallions to top were fabulous. I could easily devour a tub of it. Being fair, I did go to the food truck at 5pm, meaning that the food most likely sat out since the lunch rush.

Wall of windows was all open to the courtyard next door, including the live music. The restaurant has a nice environment, but was very noisy. The food was just average or less than average. The Amtriciana (pasta in red sauce) had more very thick sauce than pasta and was nothing special. Wouldn't order it again. Same for the Shrimp Scampi, Eggplant Parm, and Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli.  None were notable. Wouldn't order any of them again. It's overpriced for the average-ness of the food. ($80 for four, without drinks or dessert).  You can get cheaper Italian food that's better in the Burlington area. The service was also just average; had to chase the waitress to refill our empty water glasses, had to ask for parmigiana cheese, and didn't check on the food delivered to us by the kitchen until we were half done, for example. She also did not appear to know the menu very well. With so many new restaurants in this area, probably won't return to this one any time soon.

The lobster roll alone is worth writing about. Smothered in hot melted butter on a toasted bun...I'm drooling just thinking about it. The oyster selection is wonderful, as is the wine. As  you have probably read already, they pack this place to the wall. You absolutely sit elbow to elbow. And sorry, if I'm shooting back oysters and plowing into a messy lobster roll...I definitely don't want someone accidentally knocking it out of my hands!! The worst was last time we came here, the two of us had a shared table situation with a party of 3 -- which was fine. They were really nice and were perfect people to share a table with. HOWEVER, after they left, they seated a party of five there assuming they could take our places after we left. We were about to order dessert and the guy next to me was literally sitting ON me. And I scooted over, and he just kept moving closer!! He was totally trying to make me uncomfortable so we would leave. Well, it worked, because we left without eating dessert--which is really too bad since we were celebrating my boyfriends new job. :( If you're looking for more intimacy with oysters, maybe try B&G.

I must say that this place is a joke! The one star is only for the ambience/decor which was nice. Other then that this place is not worth the time/money. We had the rabbit and the daily fish. Food didn't taste or smell fresh. Rabbit wasn't a roasted one but if was previously boiled and then kind of baked. Fish wasn't good, well I didn't had that type of fish before but tasted just like a fish can, and came very cold. You wouldn't want to pay $30+ for those kind of dishes. And we went with what the waitress suggested us. Being very disappointed from food I wanted to give it another try and ordered the peach and blackberry Gallete dessert which honestly was worst then a muffin at a cheap hotel.

Why?  \\n\\nThis is a traditional cantonese style (relatively) high end restaurant.  I say relatively because I feel like many high end chinese restaurants get taken over by non-cantonese customers - I'm looking at you, Kirin - and then the flavor profile of the cuisine seems to take a nosedive as it slants toward pleasing their mainstream audience.  Frequently, such places will start to taste more like Shanghai style, Northern Chinese style, or even fusion westernized versions.\\n\\nAt Vivacity, you get what you get in Hong Kong before 1997 happened.  This is old school Canton cuisine.  Shark's fin soup and bird's nest soup figure prominently.  The dishes are not inventive or innovative, and the recipes are not expected to change in the next hundred years.  Even after all the sharks are extinct in the world.  Extinction is just another excuse for raising menu item prices.  \\n\\nThere is a place for this cuisine, especially in the Greater Vancouver area.  The older folks I ate with here are accustomed to this style of food.  They come here specifically for this kind of food that they grew up eating in Hong Kong.  They don't want Shanghai style food or some asian fusion.  This is a very specific style with a certain service style expectation in a very specific atmosphere and ambience.  With the private room next door going wild like a KTV, I could close my eyes and imagine that I was in Hong Kong.  \\n\\nIf you have friends or family visiting, and they specifically request Hong Kong style dinner from the early 90's when Chow Yun Fat ruled the cinemas, this is the place to go.\\n\\nThe prices are in line with my expectations for a place of this nature.  Meaning, it's quite expensive relative to other places in Richmond for this type of food, but you're paying for the emphasis on Hong Kong tradition, ambience and style of cuisine."},{"name":"Sabor Do Brasil","address":"2858 Delk Rd, Ste 120","city":"Marietta","stars":"4","text":"Gostamos muito do restaurante.

(A post-hoc examination of the online menu reveals that there was bitter cocoa in the sow and venison ragu. So THAT'S what that flavor was. Very interesting.)\\n\\nGo for the half-sized entrees and construct yourself a tasting menu of unbridled creativity, flavor and craftsmanship. It will be an experience you won't soon forget. Bondir also earns major style points for its bread selection, and the servers are not shy about dolling out slices. Barley flour bread with cascade hops and duck cracklings? Check and mate.\\n\\nIn true Chopped fashion, there's always room for nitpicking (dessert leaves much to be desired), but I'm not going to dwell on anything here.
