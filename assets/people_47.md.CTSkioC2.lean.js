Green tile-like wallpaper along the back wall. Classy and homey at the same time. Good view of Gastown. \\n\\nService: Friendly and attentive. Our cute waitress with a nice smile seemed to genuinely like her job and was knowledgeable about the drinks. She never let the glass of water go empty. The place was super busy but service was solid.\\n\\nFood: Good food price for some items, a tad much for others. My friend and I split the chicken and duck sandwich. It was overcooked meat with way too much salt. The cilantro was a nice touch though, but the bread was cheap... The whole thing tasted cheap. Don't go here for the food! This is NOT an ideal place for dinner but rather pre-/post-dinner drinks. The salads looked better from afar and I had wished I'd gotten one of those instead, but when you're drinking yummy cocktails you kind of want something high in calories to sop up all the alcoholy goodness.\\n\\nDRINKS/Alcoholy goodness: Now onto the good stuff! These drinks were delicious! I only had one drink and a sip of my friend's (I know, a tame night) but I wished I had the alcohol tolerance to consume at least a couple more. That's one of the down sides to being a light weight, especially since I don't go out to get drunk and much prefer to savour my drinks. The drinks here are ideal for savouring! Ranging from $8 to $12 per drink (most of them at $10), they're reasonably priced for drinks of this calibre. I got the Royale ($12) because it had won a bartending award and I was curious about how one could incorporate bourbon and ice wine together in a cocktail. It was delicious! \\n\\nFYI: They also run a bartending course for people who want to learn how to mix mean cocktails like the ones served up at the Diamond! So delicious. If I wanted to be a bartender, I'd say that's a good place to learn how. Oh, and watch out for the dweebs who jump around from table to table harassing women. One of them almost started a fight with the bar staff because I'm sure one of the women complained but then they just had a staring contest for a while. Silly dweebs.\\n\\nOverall, 4 stars because the food was so bad, otherwise it would've been 5. I'd say 4.5 would be more accurate because the drinks, decor and service were positives that overwhelmed the negatives of the food. I definitely recommend it! If you have the tolerance to get through a fancy cocktail menu then I applaud you and recommend you check out this place. If you like nice drinks, this is a good spot for them."},{"name":"Taste of Punjab","address":"4980 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy, Ste 192","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4.5","text":"My boyfriend and j just discovered this restaurant and we decided to order delivery here based on the yelp reviews.

I can say with confidence that Lee's does not disappoint. I got the BBQ pork bahn mi and pho combo, which was a surprisingly good deal. The pork was well seasoned and the bread clearly fresh baked that day. Personally, I think that the bhan mi at Quoc Huong is a little better, something to do with the butter rather than mayo, however Lee's pho is clearly superior to Quoc Huong. I also think the Pho Dai Loi's pho is better than Lee's, but Dai Loi's BBQ pork is not even worth mentioning. So, Lee's bakery has the 2nd best bahn mi and 2nd best pho on Buford (that I have found thus far) which could make it better than both Dai Loi and Quoc Huong. I will say this for Lee's Bakery, when I went there just before closing they still had exactly what I was looking for. The same cannot be said for the supposed king of bahn mi Quoc Huong. \\n\\nI will be back.\\n\\nLocation:\\nLee's Bakery is a little difficult to find.

For starters, the projected 1/2 hour delivery time actually took an hour. Styro containers are pretty much the norm when you order out, so no biggy. Except that the packaging had no seperating sections. Not that it mattered, the food appeared to have been thrown in the corner and evrything else piled on top. I'm talking meat balls on salad piled on rice mixed in with Dolmathes. Whats up with that? One order was supposed to have no Greek salad with extra potatoes.  The meal originaly came with a half potatoe, which is pretty sad to start with. I guess extra potatoes instead of salad means no salad and nothing extra, cuz he still only got 1/2 a potatoe. I myself am a greek food fanatic. These were flavorless spuds not worthy of the greek name. All in all every meal was considered terrible by all. The prices were much too high for the quality and quantity of food. No one should have to pay $10 for dry rice and shriveled chicken that tasted like turkey. I later complained to the owner who offered 20% off our next meal with extra potatoes and salad. Lame-O. I wish we could go back in time so this experience was just a figment of my imagination.

We had heard so much about it that we needed to try some of the famous canolli while we were visiting Boston. We had also heard that there is usually a line out the door and our walk-by yesterday (July 4th) proved that to be the case.  After seeing the line yesterday we wanted to get there early to beat the heavy foot traffic. We arrived at about 8:45 am, there were already several people there (on a Tuesday morning), but we got right in.  There were numerous people available to help us but we had no idea which flavors we wanted or how much each canollo cost (canollo is actually the singular of conolli). Since it is cash only, we wanted to make the most of our $21. I ordered the chocolate chip, and my husband picked out pistachio, chocolate mousse, chocolate cream, vanilla cream, and chocolate covered. Six large sugary creamy treats came to a total of $19 (but I have no idea which ones were more expensive).  If we had another $15 we would've gotten a Florentine, amaretto, and hazelnut (the amaretto and hazelnut hadn't been filled yet).\\n\\nI'll admit, I haven't had many canolli in my life, but enough to know what a bad one tastes like.  After my trip to Mike's Pastries now I know what a really good one taste's like.  The filling is rich and smooth - not grainy at all.  And it's just sweet enough without being overpoweringly sweet.  As for the portions... one is pretty filling.  We cut them up amongst six family members and we mad it through half of our canolli for a lunchtime desert.    \\n\\nA day later, only the vanilla cream was left, so we cut it up for breakfast.

The creamy sauce was perfect (not gritty!) and the sauteed peppers and onions were an excellent accent.

Vegan Stir Fry, Two Ways (tofu & vegetables (peppers, onions, broccoli, mushrooms, zucchini, carrots, green onions stir-fried with gluten-free ginger-soy sauce, served with jasmine rice 12.95$).  I'm glad that I asked for light sauce (it was still pretty saucy), but this was exactly what the doctor ordered.  Crunch veggies with light and fluffy jasmine rice.

It was a yes and I was to call Sunday morning giving them 30 min advance.  On Sunday,  I did as I was told and called in and spoke to Molly again.  She said I wasn't able to make takeout  orders because they were doing a special event. I reminded her of our two previous conversions and she transferred me to Stephanie. She told me she would ask the chef. It was a yes again, thankfully, since I was driving there at the time. (Half hour trip each way.) When I arrived, Stephanie told me that the butter cake had been taken off the menu the day before, but I could get two carrot cakes!!! I tried to explain that I had preordered it and confirmed it (a half hour ago), and she said,  \\"sorry, I don't know what you want me to do because that cake takes 5 hours to make\\".

I love living 3 minutes away from this place.\\n\\nI've eaten a few more involved dishes here.  The noodle soup, variety meat congee, and Viet pancake.  They are mostly decent but not amazing.  Not enough noodles and topping in the noodle soup.  Pancake is kind of sloppy.  For the variety meat congee, Pho #1's dish C22 is the way to go...much better than any other congee in town, including the Chinese places.  The pricing is very shady for these, they are not displayed and I was kind of surprised when they charged more than the Pho places.  \\n\\nIt's a bakery, so you can get some cheap Vietnamese French bread, pastry, and some other ready-to-eat items.  I've tried a few but was not too impressed.  You could get bubble smoothies here as well, very good quality for cheaper than Mozart or White Windmill."},{"name":"VCC Cafeteria","address":"250 W Pender St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"VCC cafeteria has a dinner service.

Finished off my Paloma and ordered a Killing Me Softly. I enjoyed it even more than the Paloma despite the fact that I don't consider myself a gin person. The cumin beef was To. Die. For. I would eat that dish at least once a week if I lived in the neighborhood. The Chinese broccoli was good, but a bit too charred for my liking. (That didn't stop me from wolfing it down). The Honey prawns were heavenly. I ended my meal with the custard....next time I would opt for the churro or sesame balls next time. The food was fab, but the experience would not have been the same without our delightful waiter James.

I happened to be near this one and stopped in.  Not busy at 1pm on a weekday.  It's kind of like Applebee's- restaurant with a bar, casual but would still work for a date or business lunch.\\n\\nService was excellent, start to finish.  There's a fairly diverse menu and I had a hard time choosing, so I went with a \\"pick two.\\"  I had a personal Chicago Classic pizza (sausage and cheese) and the chicken scampi pasta.  Between the two I was stuffed, so I'm glad I got more than just a personal pizza.  The pizza was fine- not nearly as good as what I've had in Chicago, but decent crust, plenty of cheese, good toppings.  The pasta was good- an interesting spin on scampi, with spinach, tomatoes, and chicken on vermicelli.  \\n\\nFor $10, the pick two is a great deal.  There's enough variety, and portions are decent.  But the rest of the menu scared me off- prices are high, and it's not good enough to justify those prices.  I doubt I'll be back, since I'm not over this way much, and it's a decent option but there are much better restaurants nearby."},{"name":"Tijuana Flats","address":"13651 Hunter's Oak Dr, Ste 107","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Very clean fresh and all the best.

Ready for some good takeout, we ordered a survey from this extensive (the first clue that it might not be good) menu: street fries, spareribs, duck in plum sauce, pad Thai and a spider roll (soft shell crab sushi roll). We received: Bland, tasteless pad Thai with mystery meat (reportedly chicken--and 2 shrimp) and some thin, pasta like noodles and tons of bean sprouts; dry, flavorless (though sticky with some kind of sugary basting) spareribs; mushy (and, wait for it, flavorless) street fries; the spider roll was unrecognizable as crab--tho I saw a little claw. The duck was moist, but by then we had all decided worst Asian food ever. Even the fortune cookies were blah.

I ended up having a great experience and can't wait to return!\\n\\nMy roommate and I ventured here on a Monday night around 6:45 pm. We were immediately greeted and seated by the hostess who was very upbeat and kind. The atmosphere was more intimate than we were expecting, but on a warm summer evening it definitely sets the tone well. They have a limited outdoor seating area, but inside the small space seems much larger than it is. The front area had high tables and a nice bar/lounge area to grab a few glasses of wine and apps. I could see myself here late night relaxing after work or an event. The dining room is set in an old world style with Italian landscapes on the walls, white tablecloths and candles, and some booth areas on the sides. It could easily transition into a group event if needed.\\n\\nEthan was our server and he did a great job! He was very attentive and made personalized recommendations based on his favorites and my preferences. Now - on to the food! They have a prix fixe menu option which allows you to choose an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $29. Some of the entrees have notes that add a few dollars extra on to the option (for example - you have a $5 upcharge on the prix fixe if you add filet mignon). My roommate and I both chose that option and split the apps and tried each others entrees. Most everything was on point.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\n\\n1. Fried Green Tomatoes - These were phenomenal! It was three large fried green tomatoes cut in half to make six total pieces. The breading was light and the inside was filled with warm, creamy goat cheese. The red pepper coulis base really accented the dish well.\\n2. Antipasto Platter - This will definitely feed two - three guests with ease. It included salami, prosciutto, parmesan, blue cheese, goat cheese, toast points, olives, and a mixture of pickled vegetables like artichoke hearts, carrots, and cauliflower. The only drawback I had with this is they drizzled additional olive oil on the top. Everything is already so rich/fatty/creamy it really didn't need that extra touch. It was a bit too greasy and I had to wipe some of my items down.\\n\\nEntrees:\\n\\n1. Gnocchi - This made the whole trip worthwhile! I rarely cook gnocchi for myself so I took advantage of the opportunity. It was cooked in a gorgonzola prosciutto sauce that was so good! My mouth is watering now just thinking about it. It was very rich and the perfect cheesy accent that would be perfect in the winter. Definitely a stick to your ribs kind of comfort food dish.\\n2. Grilled Lamb - The lamb was very tender and presented beautifully. It was bone-in with three pieces atop cauliflower mashed potatoes and crisp asparagus. A warm red wine reduction sauce topped it all off. Another rich dish, I would have loved to have something acidic paired with it to cut through the flavors, but extremely tasty and something I would get for myself.\\n\\nDesserts:\\n\\n1. NY Cheesecake - I was a little disappointed with this one. The cheesecake was warmer than I would have liked when it was brought out and it had lumps (I'm assuming of cream cheese) throughout. The crumb crust fell apart pretty easily and I prefer mine a little more firm. In future I wouldn't choose this one again over their many cake offerings.\\n2. Pistachio Gelato - Not as soft as a traditional gelato, this was more like ice cream. Served in an old fashioned glass dish it melted well in your mouth and definitely had the flavor my roommate was looking for.\\n\\nOverall, the great food and stellar service will have me come back to try more of their offerings and explore their extensive wine list. I had no idea that such a nice restaurant was hidden behind the oak door a few steps away from my neighborhood Bruster's."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Mikes pastry is the best!

Perhaps people are so inebriated with margaritas that they can't notice these things. \\n\\nI went to El Mercado on a Saturday afternoon when the place was less than half empty. After they seated us, it took forever just to get someone to take our order. When the waitress finally came over, her response was \\"oh, I guess I'll take your order.\\" As we waited and waited for our food, no one returned to refill our drinks or freshen up our chips and salsa. My friend actually went over to the where the salsa was kept and refiled our bowl. Again, the restaurant remained half than less full. When our food finally arrived, we were pleasantly surprised that it was tasty. \\n\\nGreat food on this particular visit, however, this isn't the first time the staff seemed aloof and unresponsive.

We started with garden salads of mixed greens, fennel, tomatoes, and a tomato basil viniagrette (crazy bargain at $5).  The greens were so fresh and delicious, perked up by the slightly licorice flavoring of the fennel, tied together with the tomato basil viniagrette.  Loveddddd it!!\\n\\nI also had a great glass of Riesling for only $7.  Very fruity.  \\n\\nMy swordfish was beautifully seared and complimented by a steamed mound of rice and simple green beans garnished with a bit of red bell pepper.  Perfect swordfish.

It was prepared VERY simply making each item uncomplicated and savory.  Beef.  Tators.  Broccoli.  \\n\\nThe prices are very reasonable and everything was appetizing.

You know like when you used to (or still do) add a layer of potato chips to your basic sandwich. Anyway, if you don't want them inside, you can get them on the side.\\n\\nMy favorite part of this experience was the man and woman behind the counter. Talk about the nicest and friendliest people. This place is set up so you can order at the counter and go get your silverware, napkins, and drinks yourself. We never once had to get up. Mr. Super Friendly (I wish we got their names) came around to bring us water and even silverware when he noticed one of the girls at the table forgot to get hers.

After much deliberation, settled on some cocktails, the Extra Fresca and the Superica Margarita.  The extra fresca is AWESOME if you're not much of a tequila fan (which I'm not)- so refreshing! And the Superica Marg def has tequila in it if you are a tequila fan.  Be careful, their drinks are potent... After 2 cocktails we were feelin good!  To eat, I had the steak tacos al carbon - freakkin AWESOME!!! Their tortillas are house-made and thick and so yummy and fluffy.  They come with just the steak and onions on them and then the avacado salsa verde on the side, which I enjoyed because I like to put as much or as little sauce on my tacos myself.  You will want to put the whole side of salsa verde on them. It is SO. Yummy.   My boyfriend got the cheese enchiladas.  I'm not a huge enchilada fan because usually it is doused in a marginal sauce - here, they were delicious.  They were plump and filled with cheese, and the sauce was flavorful with a nice kick to it.  I'd totally order enchiladas again!  With our entrees came family-style rice and beans.

It had a nice wooden look, chalkboard-like signs, and smelled of delicious BBQ'd meats! Unfortunately I think it didn't meet our expectations, primarily because we were looking for get-you-hands-dirty Texas BBQ. This restaurant ended up being more of a great BBQ spot to bring your colleagues too and have a civilized BBQ experience. Not a bad thing, but not what we were hoping for. \\n\\nThe portions were small to begin. I did like the cornbread with a kick that was served when we first sat at the table but those too were very small - smaller than the size of a regular muffin. I was happy to order a local beer on tap - Austin Beerworks Pearl Snap, and there was a large selection of other adult beverages. I noticed many patrons sitting alone which led me to believe the place must be really good to have worker bees coming solo to have this great BBQ. \\n\\nFor starters we had the deviled eggs... those were very good, had a nice spicy kick to them. The bore ribs were very tiny though flavorful. \\n\\nI ordered the Two Meat chicken and brisket dish with a side of collards and baked mac n cheese. The brisket was very tender! The chicken was a little dry but had a nice dry rub on it. Paired with the table sauces the chicken was much better. The collards were a little too salty for my liking, and while the mac n cheese was good it reminded me more of a velveta cheese than melted cheddar and other cheeses (I've had better). \\n\\nMy colleagues had ribs and they said the meat fell off the bone but they also complained about the portion size being too small for their liking. The potato salad was good they mentioned, but none of them finished their baked beans. \\n\\n\\nAgain, I can see how this place is good for business meetings or a higher-class happy hour, but I would not suggest this restaurant to someone who is new to Texas looking for some BBQ."},{"name":"The Greek Corner","address":"1600 N Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in for a Togo order while me and my boss sis interviews for a new restaurant opening in the area, and I can't stress enough how fast the service was and how amazing Jesse is!

Their cannolis are really good too with so many flavors to try from. I don't like their cream puffs though. The cream had no flavor except for all that sugar. The creme puff itself was soggy and had no flavor. I feel like it's just a big blob of sugar. The cupcakes are average - nothing to rave about.

The menu had many options.  We began with the pickled celery starter.  My husband loved the blue cheese and date combination which was spread on top of the pickled celery.  He also liked the strongly flavored carrot ginger soup.  I opted for the broken rice soup that had a soft chunk of pork which added a nice savory flavor to the rice which seemed more like a risotto than a soup.  The cup serving of the soups seemed larger than a cup---more like two cups.  Overall, the soup was ok and nowhere near as outstanding as the dishes that followed.  I had the mushroom meatballs served with a small amount of spaghetti squash and a mushroom puree.  Its hard to describe the dish and the menu certainly doesn't adequately describe it either.  It is an extraordinary bowl with about 6-8 small \\"meatballs\\" that are served with some roasted mushrooms and a mushroom cream sauce that gets an A+ rating in my book.  The dish would be a nice appetizer for two people and is a little small for an entree for one.  Just figure out some way to order it because it is quite tasty.  My husband had the spinach salad with quail.  The little birds were exceptional.  By the time we were done, we were impressed and satisfied.  I should also mention that we got to sit outside on a gorgeous Austin day and we were served by an extremely pleasant young man who knew the menu well and was most helpful..

They pay tribute to their creators by listing the bar and year in which they were born. I like that - a patenting of sorts. I liked the bar's default habit of serving some of their classic cocktails straight up without the rocks. Big on flavor. In reference to the reviews on the service here - it was not crowded at all when we arrived, so it wasn't a problem.

The salad dressing was great but for the fact that the lettuce was dripping with water.  This diluted the dressing and simply shows a lack of attention to detail for things as such which breaks an item.  The tempura was subpar due to the 3 coats of batter in which the veggies and tiny pee-wee shrimp were slathered in; concealing whatever fresh flavours it may have had.  I think the extra thick batter was intentional to mask the pitiful size of the 3 shrimps.  Not recommended unless you love batter and nothing but.

One of the first listings that came up was Croissant Gourmet in Winter Park.\\n\\nI live in Winter Springs, for me this trip was a straight shot down HWY 17-92 and a left hand turn onto Morse Blvd.  Yep, that simple.  He dropped me off outside the store and he went to grab a space (side street parking so if you are like me and can't parallel park THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU!!).\\n\\nI arrived about 10:30 to the cute/quaint storefront. It was still a bit cool but that didn't stop people from sitting outside to enjoy their food.  They have about 5 tables outside.  Inside, there are a few more seating spots and a bar along the front window.  They then have a chilled case and a unchilled bake window. \\n\\nThere was only one couple in front of me but they seemed unsure of what they wanted so it took about 10 minutes for them to make their order.  The cashier was very patient and that gave me time to decide what I wanted to purchase.  Of course, during my wait another couple came in to stand behind me, and a single customer came in and cut in front of me.  The cashier being johnny on the spot; however, noticed I had been waiting and came to assist me first.\\n\\nI ordered a french bread baguette, a bear claw, an almond croissant, a cheese danish and a blueberry danish.  I also wanted to order several of the tarts, particularly the mixed fruit, and some of the macaroons but I restrained myself. \\n\\nIt looks as if they use their croissant dough for all of their pastries, or at least for the croissant, bear claw and the danish.  The dough is perfect...crispy, flaky, buttery...my shirt was covered in the little bits of pastry flakes.  \\n\\nThe hubs had the cheese danish and he really enjoyed it.  He's a food purist, no fancy flavors or fruits for him.  He bit into and showed me the inside.  It appeared to have a good half pound of sweet, creamy cheese in it.  The almond croissant, though good, was probably my least favorite item.  The almond slices on top were a bit overcooked.  The bear claw was by far the star of the show (this trip).  The crust was flaky, the filling just enough and the chocolate on the top was sweet but not overly so.  My teenager devoured the blueberry danish and when I asked how it was I got a grunt...I can only assume that the translation was a positive response. \\n\\nIt is definitely a place to check out, even if you have to drive a bit.

This place is an absolute embarrassment to Austin.  I can get the view in plenty of other places and not put up with 1) zero hospitality, 2) poor service, 3) severe lack of cleanliness throughout, and 4) atrocious food... all leaving no doubt that they, Oasis owner/management, could not care less about salvaging any semblance of pride.\\n\\nVisited 7/25/16 and it will be my last time to grace them with my presence.  Starting at front door, hostesses did not greet (3 of them gathered around hostess area chatting) but had to be prompted by us regarding a table, even though there were no other guests waiting to be seated.  It was raining, so they seemed to be more concerned regarding \\"why are people still coming and we're not getting to go home early.\\"  Yes, we actually overheard them discussing this.  Great job Oasis management on instilling customer service skills in the persons that make the first impression on your guests.  \\n\\nOnce seated, the service was slow and extremely sub-par throughout.  Not a smile to be seen and we seemed to be as much an inconvenience to our waiter as we were to the hostesses.  Guess there's not a lot of motivation to provide quality when you have the 18% gratuity locked in before the guests are even seated... unless quality is a part of the culture of the restaurant.  That's doesn't appear to be in the vocabulary at the Oasis.  I always tip and have zero issue with giving a super tip beyond this amount, but it ought to be earned, not guaranteed.  That's what most of us have to do, work for and EARN our pay, not lollygag through because we know it's already coming our way.\\n\\nAt this point there wasn't much doubt where this was heading, and yes, the lack of quality carried over to the food.  Absolutely the worst beef enchiladas I've ever had.  Looked like they came out of a banquet frozen dinner, with some garbage rice concoction on the side and charro beans straight out of the can.  Zero seasoning on any of it.  Tasteless garbage.    \\n\\nCan't leave off the trip to the men's room.  Looked like it gets cleaned about once a week at best and in severe need of an update.  Icky to the max.  Very nasty and disgusting.\\n\\nI'll be back to Chuy's as fast as possible to get the anti-Oasis treatment and food that always leaves me with a smile... and if I can't make it to Chuy's I'll swing into Taco Bell where they can match the quality of the Oasis for about 1/10th the price.\\n\\nFor any persons visiting our great city, please do yourself a favor and skip the Oasis.

I've had a better deal for around $7 for a lunch/dinner combo plate (rice, curry, raita/yogurt, chutney), but it is a good value for Boston where ethnic food is more pricey than say in San Francisco, LA or New York City. \\n\\nPoor atmosphere and abrupt service are not uncommon when considering this is basically a fast food joint, though as many reviewers have mentioned, it's by no means fast. They certainly take their sweet *ss time taking your order and getting it ready. It's certainly not something I would put up with given the food quality. They do have free hot chai for you. The chai is standard --not bad, not extraordinary and a little heavy on the ginger.\\n\\nBottom line is it's great for a quick take-out type meal when you're jonesing for some no fuss Indian food. I prefer Kebab Factory down the street. Price-wise, they actually have comparable lunch deals."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I wanted to like this place. I really did. And I almost did until I revisited it the next day. \\n\\nMy first experience was more than I had hoped for. We arrived an hour before we intended to eat, knowing there would be a long wait. During that time we tried their macaroons which were pretty good. After sitting we were greeted by the fictional owner, Penelope. The atmosphere is a lot to take in and quite enjoyable. \\n\\nI ordered the Pub it Up burger and my fianc√©e ordered the goat cheese flatbread. Both were really good. The queso and mustard on the burger with chips in it is exactly what a gourmet burger should taste like. The flatbread was over a foot long, providing enough food to make it a meal and not an appetizer. Speaking of appetizer, we had the almond chocolate bread that's only crime was being too chocolatey and delicious. \\n\\nDessert was the brookie, cookies and cream sundae. This is for two people and I'm glad we didn't order two. It comes with three scoops of ice cream, two cookies, and two brookies. Absolutely amazing. \\n\\nIf I never returned my opinion would be 5 stars. But I returned and my experience turned sour.\\n\\nWe ordered a banana and Nutella crepe, cinnamon shake, and a strawberry cheesecake shake. The shakes came out first. Mine, the cinnamon shake with Cinnamon Toast Crunch on top, was already melted when it came out. I turned it back saying it was essentially cold milk and not a shake. I got my second one but it wasn't much better. Going inside I saw the reason. They put very little ice cream in the shakes and it's already half melted when they do. The crepe was drenched in melted Nutella, making it a plate of chocolate soup. \\n\\nThis place is just another tourist gimmick. It has potential but it ruins it by half assing. I know it's their soft opening but these are basic mistakes that anyone in the restaurant business can avoid. These are the problems mom and pop places suffer, not large chains and companies.\\n\\nAvoid the shakes and brunch menu. The dinner menu is decent and the dessert is superb. But expect to drop a lot of cash.

Thankfully my waiter was understanding and took the dish away. By that point I really wasn't in the mood to eat anything. My mother who never complains told me when we left that her clam chowder was inedible. She is old school and very polite so she never said anything. She said they filled half the bowl with crackers and poured the soup on top of that (?) never heard of that.

Well let me tell you about a nice balmy Saturday evening that turned into the night we wanted to forget. So my wife and I arrived a minute prior to our reservation and were promptly offered a table - right next to the entrance. We inquired if they could check if there was another table (plenty looked available) but we were told no, somewhat sternly. Okay, not the best but just the front desk. We settle down and start ordering when we realize this table has a strong draft of cold air. I mention this to our server again asking if there was another table - server looked displeased and said there wasn't. Determined to have a good evening, we pressed forth with ordering food, after all that's what we were there for. I order a Chimay, server brings me the bottle and a glass. He leaves the table and I realize the side of the glass is badly stained with some dirt. Now I start getting annoyed - the table placement isn't a big deal, but this guy is just not paying attention. I catch him on his next round, he apologizes and brings me another clean glass. We order our food. The appetizers are pretty good, so we're now thinking this is going to be a fine evening despite the rocky start. Oh, but they're not done surprising us. My entree turns up fine, but they mess up my wife's entree - turns out the server put in the wrong order. The server is apologetic, but in a way where he doesn't really mean it - you know what I am talking about - the words are coming out of his mouth but he looks like he's either getting strangled or feeling really constipated, take your pick. Finally after a 15 minute wait they get the right entree, the pork chop which was recommended by the server, turns out to have a little salt mine inside of it. Now we just want to get out of here....the server at this point throws in free dessert. We don't really want to be here, so we order the bread pudding to go....when we get home turns out the dessert wasn't very good (tastes more like banana bread, which is really weird with scotch sauce and ice cream). To top it off, there was a rude patron (not the restaurant's fault, but didn't make things any better). Could this all be just due to a lousy server with bad taste in food? Sure, but then where is the quality control? And the front desk staff wasn't any better. So, thanks Lambert for spoiling a nice evening.

For dessert, you can easily split something after getting dinner. I got a Brookie Sundae. The cookie was a gross cookie that typically comes individually wrapped in plastic- that kind of taste.

The doors and walls are so thin you can hear footsteps in the hallway and every door that closes. This hotel has a lot of potential if they put some effort and money into making it nice, but it is clear to me that they do not care because for some reason they fully book their rooms at certain times of the year.

It is consistently delicious, convenient and can please the crowds.\\n\\nAtmosphere 6/7\\nOne of the things o love about this restaurant is that you order when you walk in and seat yourself.  It is not full service in the traditional sense, you pay up front and food is brought to your table. The atmosphere is versatile, in the evening the lighting is low and it is great for a romantic night out. During the day the patio is lovely and there is nothingness better than a North Star brunch. Service is always excellent. If you wait too long for your food the manager will come give you a free meal coupon (unnecessarily considering I would pay excessive amounts of cash money to eat here). I like this location better than either of the other two locations. I want to live here. \\n\\nFood 7/7\\nSimple. Fresh. Clean. Good. Get the North Star burger. It is a veggie burger elevated to new levels. There is no nasty chewy soy patties here. This restaurant provides the best vegetarian options that are both simple and satisfying. I always get the sweet basil burrito. Even my meatetarian father in law likes the Newman ranch burger. The menu is not extensive but it is curated expertly. Eat this food. \\n\\nDrinks 6/7\\nRotating drafts at a good price and always good wines make this a good place to grab a drink with dinner. They also make specialty juices and one of the best margs I've ever had (I've been to Mexico don't check me). I always go for a local brew on draft and have never gone wrong, but you already knew how good local c bus craft beer is. My wife likes the wine so I'm sure it's good. \\n\\nService 6/7\\nThis is not a full service restaurant. But trust me ask them for anything and they will provide. Almost like a presidential candidate, but they actually follow through on their promises. Ketchup isn't on the table don't forget to ask for it!\\n\\nOverall 7/7\\nYou can't beat the value, food, or atmosphere.

All in all, a solid choice for a night of drinking beers and hanging out.\\n\\nBeers: They have a lot of 'em. At any given point, Cambridge Common has about 40 beers on tap. They give you two beer lists: The permanent fixtures, and the current rotating taps. The rotating taps will often feature more seasonal selections (think pumpkin beers in October). When I come to Cambridge Common, I almost always start with a sampler, which the bartenders are happy to assemble from any of the available beers. I tend to pick a random six beers that sound awesome, then the bartender arranges them in an order that makes sense for tasting. After my sampler, my MO is to get a pint of whichever beer I liked best from the sampler.\\n\\nService: Quality. I think I've only ever sat at the bar here, so this may not extend to the table service. But the bartenders are attentive, friendly, and well-versed in their beer. They also manage not to mock the people who come in looking for Bud Light.\\n\\nFood: There are some culinary hits on the menu, and some less successful items. Overall this is a better-than-average pub food menu. I really like the fish tacos here--the fish is blackened and NOT breaded, so this is a fresher, more flavorful version of the dish (probably healthier too). I've heard several people rave about the Greek salad, though olives and feta aren't my thing.\\n\\nCambridge Common does get crowded. I recommend taking the T to Harvard, walking to the bar, and parking your butt on the stool around 7 if you want to spend a few hours there, particularly on a weekend night. There is a small parking lot tucked behind the bar, but it fills up pretty fast. Plus, let's not kid ourselves: Cambridge Common is not the type of experience you'll be driving away from.

I guarantee you are the only one who's happy you get to have your loin monkeys at a bar.\\n\\nOn another, less child-centric note. The beer (especially the Copacetic) is well above average if you enjoy strong but generally well balanced beers. The menu is really simple but covers meat eaters and veggies alike. The staff is perhaps a little indifferent at times but I've never had rude service and sometimes had really great service. The bathrooms are clean, there are lots of covered tables outside which serve well to meet new people. The mix of people seems to be pretty good too. From the most hipstery of hipsters to studying college students to an after work office crowd to Dude-bros with some serious tans. I've never had anything but great experiences here with the other patrons.\\n\\nBest of all this is an ADULT SAFE SPACE.  There are no kids allowed so you don't have feel like you need to watch your language, move tables to smoke or listen to the cries of bored youngins who have to sit and watch pops knocking a few back."},{"name":"Vespaio Ristorante","address":"1610 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Ordered the calamari, caesar salad, risotto special, and chocolate dessert.

You never know what gems you might find as the carts wheel around and unveil their treasures.  There's surely something to please everyone.  It's best to go in a group of 4 or more so that you'll be able to try more varieties of dim sum without getting full on just a few items.  Just be sure to go early on the weekends because the line can get quite long.  But that's just a testament to how popular this restaurant is.  Trust me...it's worth the wait.\\n\\nIn case you're in the mood for more than just dim sum, you can also order dishes from the kitchen around lunch time.

Since then the place had burned down, going through many changes, and additional add-on structures, etc. Since we moved we decided that why not go there for our anniversary for nostalgia. Our expectations were low based upon others' reviews of this place and sadly they were correct.\\n\\nWe arrived here on a Thursday early evening and barely recognized the place due to all the additional buildings and structures. The place is surrounding by small shops, Oasis brewery, parking garage, etc. Basically the Oasis turned into some weird beachy tourist trap. It was odd to see all these statues outside of the oasis. It was like someone puked up statues. I later learned it was due to some store that was selling them or something.\\n\\nMoving on into the Oasis, there was a small wait to get a table since they didn't have enough servers to accommodate the influx of people trying to grab a bite to eat. Once we were led down 2-3 flights of stairs we landed at our small table. I got the Oasis Sunset drink which was decent tasting and got me a nice buzz. Their hurricane drinks are a minimum of 2 per person. My husband got the spicy banana drink. He said it was good but got overwhelmingly sweet towards the end of it. We were given a huge basket of chips and salsa to munch on while we waited for our food.\\n\\nOur food came out very shortly after we ordered it. It was weird since normally you wait a little bit for fajitas and it was also kind of busy. For our main meal we got the combo fajitas for two people. We got shrimp, chicken, corn tortillas, cheese, sour cream, beans, rice, guacamole, salsa, etc. The food was meh but we were hungry so we ate what we wanted. The service was not great. We saw our waitress only a few time throughout the meal. I don't even think she checked in on us after we got the food. \\n\\nI would recommend if you feel the need to come here, come for the view (beautiful!!) and an overpriced hurricane drink."},{"name":"Superica","address":"99 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"If I'm in the area, this is where I'm going.

Afterwards, I typically like to walk the beltline!\\n\\nEvery time I've eaten here, the server has been quick, friendly, and personable. The food? Phenomenal, y'all.

We're having it for dinner tonight in fact. Yes, it's in an older building so don't expect the decor to be all swish. It's a pub/bar type place and thus, treat it as such. What is amazing is the Dr Who & British decor and the delicious food. I have only had one item that wasn't up to my standard: Clam Chowder. But, to be fair, I'm a clam chowder snob and too picky about it. It's good here..just not the best I have ever had. \\nThe fish...oh, the yummy, wonderful fish. So good it can make you cry. And I am not a fish eating person. The fish here makes me one. The shrimp is incredibly good too. Just the right amount of crispness on lgood sized shrimp. The chips are so much better than any place I have had them. Even places that claim theirs are \\"authentic\\". My fiance' is British so, believe me, I hear about it if it isn't done right. I tried the Scotch Egg the last time we ordered from here and, while my Brit said it was perfect, I found it too salty for my taste. But I'm not big on salty items either. The prices could be considered a bit high but you also are getting good quality food and large portions.\\nBeing that we live nearby, we consider it a treat every couple of months to order from here and bring it home. Never a bad experience and the staff has always been very nice & prompt. I sincerely hope The Fish & Chip Shop will be around for as long as I am. Yes, the food is THAT good. We keep planning to go in when they have the Dr. Who Trivia nights but have yet to do so. Yet another thing that makes this place so appealing. It speaks volumes to us Sci-Fi geeks. \\nSo, if you want good food, pub-like ambiance, and friendly staff, this is the place for you.\\n\\nPS: If you are vegetarian or vegan, I suggest you walk on by.

The other problem I had that I found out about after the fact was that one of the waiters kept bothering a table of guests who were last to get their food asking if they were done so he could take their plates and then when they had gotten cake and went to the restroom they came back to find that their cake had been taken away before they were able to eat it.

My friend ordered a bloody mary and it was delicious and you could tell had been made to order, not using the pre-made bloody mary mix.  The waitress was great in that she upgraded him to an ultimate which included feta stuffed olives- and upon tasting, I immediately ordered one.\\n\\nWe then ordered the buffalo wontons to start, which were divine.  The dipping sauce was fantastic and complimented it nicely and it  was a perfect size as it did not fill us up, but we were still content with having enough of the taste.\\n\\nI ordered the chicken club sandwich which had so much flavor and was a very large size.  I took half of the sandwich home to enjoy for lunch the next day!  My friend ordered the eggs benedict.  I could not get over how incredible tasting the hollandaise sauce was.  It was the perfect combination of ingredients.  I can't say I've ever had better.\\n\\nThe waitress was great after the meal because it was such a great day, we wanted to sit and enjoy being outside.  She did not rush us at all and kept filling up our waters and offering us more drinks.  Inevitably, we called about 6 of our friends to come in and meet us for cocktails.  We ended up staying for over 4 hours after just merely dropping in.  It was very comfortable and relaxing while still keeping up with the \\"North End\\" immaculate service repertoire.

There was quite a selection, and more toppings, but there was not a single Vietnamese American, except behind the counter. \\"Well,\\" I said, \\"I'll go with the usual litmus test, the bbq pork bahn mi.\\" Judging layer by layer, I like that they put radishes, the other ingredients, pretty standard. Now for the important stuff, the pork. It's a bit different. Not the usual taste, that brings me back to my childhood. I'm not sure if it's more complex, or just a different ratio in the flavoring of the meat. In any case, I liked it. The bun, however, ended my hopes and dreams for the sandwich. The crust, I guess, generally, tastes better than your grociery store-bought baguette. But the texture is too dry and brittle, and the crust is too thick. Quoc Huong has a crispy, thin, crust, and is softer all around, and softer bread is generally more pleasing to the asian palette.

I had heard that I needed to check out this new Thai place in Wakefield, so I went for an evening dinner with my pad Thai loving kids. When we arrived, the place had no AC, so I considered leaving, but they redirected a fan at me, and it seemed churlish to leave. I should have followed my instincts. It's obvious that despite having tables, they don't really want sit-in customers. They never brought water, food arrived packed in to-go containers with disposable plates with incredibly flimsy plastic cutlery. There were no knives, so cutting food was impossible. The pad thai was mediocre, the shrimp didn't taste very fresh, the satay was limp and ungrilled, and came without skewers, which made it very difficult to eat (no knives to cut it.) The main dishes came out well before the appetizers, and I was never asked how anything was. I'm very sorry I tipped as if at a sit-down restaurant, and I'm a bit sad about eating my leftovers tomorrow - and I usually love leftover pad thai.

Because I make a better pot at home. I eat Pho every week, sometimes everyday. I have become a Pho purist. Yes, I know, I'm Thai, but when my Vietnamese friends decided my pho is better than their moms..I think I'm onto something. Pho is cheap (per bowl) if made at home, but more importantly, it's better. I can also delineate from the pure form that once used worms to flavor the broth rather than msg. There are bouillon cubes, pastes, prepackaged spices, and instant broth in a can.  Pho is a form of food art. It takes a lot of work to infuse all those flavors into something so magical turns that it turns any frown upside down. I make mine over a span of 8 hrs, simmering overnight as I awake to the smell of star anise puncturing my nasal membrane. There needs to be a glistening of fat on top, not a pale clear or brown broth. The noodles need to be somewhat slippery, and the beef, oh the beef..it needs to be of high quality. I buy bottom rounds from TFM (the fresh market) on Henderson and...ok, I'll stop now, back to telling you why Buckeye Pho is aight. \\n\\nI've lived in L.A., traveled to Southeast Asia, eaten in NYC and Chicago, and not that I think Columbus doesn't have potential, it's just that its not worth $8 a bowl.

Over all, for those who have limited experience with Pho and wanna try it, or for those who just need an instant fix and are willing to pay for it, this isn't a bad place to start.

It took a long time to get our food (approx 45 mins), but I can forgive that because they were slammed. The problem I have with this place is the salt content in their food, and I like salt. Even my salad of all things even was wayy too salty. I had the linguini with clams. The flavors were there, but it felt like I was eating almost pure salt. So much so that my mouth kind of burned. Until the chef addresses this problem I will not be going back. Again, I like salt, but this would have been a million times better  if it had a quarter of the salt content. Gross. On a positive note, the pasta was cooked perfectly, and their dough was good. Like I already said, the flavors are there just way too much salt! Come on guys!!!

The venue was perfect for the show - very reminiscent of the old Backyard (may it rest in peace...sigh).  Unfortunately, I don't think that Nutty Brown Cafe (or \\"the Nut,\\" as folks are apparently wont to call it) was really prepared for the crowd that came out for this show.  We got there just as the show was about to start, and probably ended up waiting close to two hours for a table (which was the only approved way to get food while watching the show).  I am positive there were quite a few people who arrived after us and never got to eat.\\n\\nAs a whole, the food was marginally better than I expected, although this isn't saying much.  We had a basket of chips and salsa, which were at least extremely plentiful (they'd better be, for $3.45), and the salsa tasted house-made, as it was super, super fresh.  We also had an order of the Nutty Shrimp Wontons (4 for $9.95), which were shrimp, bacon, cheese, and jalapeno wrapped with wonton shells and deep fried.  I would NEVER have chosen this dish, and I was immediately reminded why after tasting it.  Wonton shells are just not made to be wrapped around bacon and shrimp and deep fried.  It's unnatural.\\n\\nFor my entree, I had a chicken salad sandwich ($7.45), which came with my choice of one side.  Their selection of sides is excellent, and includes rarely-seen side choices like lima beans, jalapeno hush puppies, and queso home fries.  I was boring and got a dinner salad as my side, but I appreciated the wide variety of offerings.  The sandwich was enormous and quite good; the chicken salad was chock full of pecans and celery and fresh dill, which made it a refreshing choice for an outdoor meal (particularly after eating those 10,000-calorie wonton abominations).  \\n\\nI'd say the food averages about 3.5 stars; they're at least trying to keep it varied and interesting, which is no small undertaking given the volume of customers they had between the restaurant and the amphitheater.  Outdoor live music venues like these are too few and far between, so five stars for atmosphere, landing the Nut a four star overall rating."},{"name":"Old Thousand","address":"1000 E 11th St, Ste 150","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"food and ambiance were good, but the servings size for the price especially for being called \\"family style\\" no no no i don't think so"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The Neapolitans are the best!

I used to really enjoy most of their non-sushi dinner items, but the samplings that I've had from their non-sushi lunch items have been underwhelming. And there are some servers - although not all - who seem a little discriminatory towards solo diners (e.g., rushing you out by bringing the check right after serving your food, and without asking if you want anything else, and before delivering the check to groups who were served long before you; refilling the water glasses of the tables around you but not yours; seating you at the bar without checking on your seating preference, when the restaurant has several empty tables throughout the time that you're there).

The noodles were very good although they could have had a slightly more full flavor.  The momos were the best I've had in a very long time.  The filling was moist and soft and really flavorful.

Let me get a few things out of the way. First, we were in a sort-of rush, due to Blue Man Group tickets. Although we arrived almost 3 hours before the show, the wait was 1hr 15min, although initially I was told 45-50min. Not a big deal, still had over an hour, and we knew what we wanted. Very cool setup, but the lobby area was very packed (with the store) and what we saw of the seating area, we thought it was small. Maybe there was more, but we didn't see more. Our Server, which we will name D, was great, and after we told him why we were there, and our wanting to order it all now to make the BMG, he was very quick and helpful. \\n\\nSo we both got the chicken, I got the Bercy, and she got the one with the mushrooms. We also ordered the almond bread and thought it would include Almond pieces and chocolate, but it was basically chocolate bread. Didn't taste anything almondy, unless it was almond flour. I liked it, but my wife thought it tasted burnt. \\n\\nFood came a few minutes later, and it looked good, but the asparagus was skimpy. they looked like baby asparagus. They were super thin, and my first one the tip tasted like something burnt on a BBQ. The other 3 were fine. My wife's were fine too. I actually enjoyed my food. The chicken wasn't dry, the potatoes tasted great. Its just that itty bitty asparagus that was disappointing. My wife's was fine, but we didn't see any bacon. She liked mine more than hers.\\n\\nSo D came by before we were done, and asked about desserts, and after seeing people's milkshakes being delivered, I changed from the chocolate to the cheesecake one. I wanted stuff on the top, and the chocolate one looked wimpy. Wife ordered the flourless cake. So I get mine, looks great.. For the price, i'm like \\"Yeah!\\"  Then I dig into it and I go \\"Oh Snap! NO!\\"  So it tasted good, but a few things that annoyed me..\\n1) the mason jar is plastic. For $12.50, you couldn't have given a real mason jar out? Plastic? seriously?\\n2) there was more whipped cream on the outside which made it look larger than it actually was. I wasn't about to lick the sides, so that is a waste.\\n3) since i scooped the side cream off, I decided to scoop some out of the inside and almost 1/3 of the inside was more whipped cream. And no it wasn't ice cream. \\n\\nSo to get $12.50 for a plastic mason jar, filled with mostly whipped cream, and instead of \\"graham crackers\\" as the description went, there was just one on top, that was disappointing. \\n\\nMy wife's flourless cake was ok. It was very rich, but it barely had any raspberry sauce. We had to ask for some extra. \\n\\nso overall, we wanted to do it, but its not something we'd plan to eat there again. maybe get some desserts from the lobby, but to sit inside, not really. I will say, it was better than our trip to Rainforest Cafe at DS.

First of all, my patron and I were sitting at the bar waiting for the hostess to call me and saw bunch of waitresses behind the bar in the corner tasting the drinks the bartender made and carried straight out for the customer. Second, after waiting for 30 minutes for the seat, we ordered 4 rolls and it took them 30+ minutes to make it. On top of that, the rolls were the worst quality I have ever seen or taste. I say Kroger's ready to go rolls were better than this. Half of the rolls were popped open and rice tasted like if someone has been playing with it for a while. So, we called the waiter (our waitress did not even come by our table and we had to actually waive at different waiter) and complained that the food is not what we expected. He called the manager over (black male) and he literally said \\"whats the problem. Do you want it remade or cancel the order\\" NOT EVEN SORRY. I was the angry customer and felt like I offended him some how. Then the waitress came by and tossed us a check with $3.40 off. I wanted better service not lousy $3.40 off.

It's a big place with a lot of coming and going traffic in the evening, but I think they handle the surges of groups very well. Foodwise, I tend to order their BLT more often than not -- it comes with guacamole and usually very good bacon, and not being a fry fan, I often get a cup of clam chowder in place of the fries (that cost extra, though, but I'll sometimes get tater tots as a straight up substitution.) I find it amazing that they still have a decent $4.95 burger, and that includes fries. Another fave is the Mac & Cheese -- a big bowl with lots of cheese-soaked macs  and some bread on the side. I also liked the pepper tang of the Biscuits & Gravy brunch special.

My husband said that this was almost comparable to his ramen experience in Japan. But, a warning that the broth is sometimes a bit too salty. \\n\\nIf you can't handle spice, the regular tonkotsu ramen would be better, but the flavor can be too rich after a while (in which the ginger would probably come in handy). \\n\\nThey have a small kids play area--perfect for when our friends (and their kids) visited. \\n\\nService is fine."},{"name":"Grand Floridian Cafe","address":"4401 Floridian Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Sweet little cafe.

Everything from the food to the atmosphere.  Drinking coffee, listening to the birds in the morning is a fantastic way to start the day.  The server, Kathleen, had the Patio and indoor restaurant tables by herself, and you would have never known it.  She was very attentive, polite and always had a smile.\\nMy breakfast was a simple order, but one of the hardest things to prepare, as any chef will attest is cooking an egg.  A true measure of a chef, or any cook, is their ability to cook an egg; they passed!  I gave no special instructions with my breakfast, just the order above, which is one of their menu items.  My eggs where cooked beautifully.  I grew up in the deep south (not Florida) and I always had ruffles on my fried eggs which I am a fan of, but not always.  As you can see in the pictures these were cooked correctly, medium heat, a little oil, and a little time to make sure they are right.  \\nThe bacon was perfectly crispy (how I like it, not burnt), but still had some chewiness which was very nice.  The grits where pretty standard--creamy, but as most placed needed to be jazzed up with Salt, Pepper and Butter.  However, Kathleen did ask if I wanted to add any cheese to my grits and suggested 3 different types, but I can only remember cheddar, but I declined.  \\nLastly there was the bread options, White or Wheat toast or a biscuit.  And I must say this is the only part of my experience I wish I could have changed.  To begin with, their biscuits are as if I would have made them in my own kitchen with one of my 80-90-year-old great aunts.  Completely made from scratch, texture was awesome and would make the best biscuit sandwich; however, they cut the biscuit in half and toasted it on the flat iron/grill top.  I would have told them to leave the biscuit whole, no toasting, because there is NOTHING better than opening a fresh biscuit yourself.\\n\\nIn summary, if you have not tried Canopy Caf√©, you should add it to the top of your list for a great breakfast spot that is comfortable and relaxing.  Remember, this is NOT a diner; it is an awesome corner caf√© with a Tuscan vibe that serves straight-forward and amazing food without breaking the bank."},{"name":"Pip's Original Doughnuts & Chai","address":"4759 NE Fremont St, Ste C","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Best donuts and chais in Portland and probably the world.

Here I chose medium (level 2) which was spicy enough to be hot and tingly on the tongue but the flavors of the curry still shine through.

It was just enough background music with a flat screen TV, and a lounge like dining area located right near the sushi bar. \\n\\nI ordered Oysters as an appetizer and they were great. Shucked, plucked, and ready to suck (lol)! The sushi was also great. I ordered my favorite Soft Shell crab roll, Sashimi Super White Tuna, and Nidi Seaweed salad. The seaweed salad had shredded beets in it which was different, yet good. If you don't like beets, but like seaweed salad, ask for it without the beets! \\n\\nI didn't order any drinks, but I've had drinks before at Strip and they are decent (the average person wouldn't complain). I don't review other bars drinks because I am a bartender and I am extremely picky about my drinks. Strip was most recently made popular when Nene and her gay friend Dwight from Atlanta Housewives appeared on television at Strip outside on the balcony.

But I haven't been to Atlanta in over a decade and thought I'd like to go out someplace to get something to eat and just kind of see downtown.\\n\\nOn the advice of a friend, I decided to check out Atlantic Station.  Trendy spot but looked like it could be fun, so I popped onto the website and checked which restaurants operated there.  After some thought I decided to try Strip, a 'Steakhouse and Sushi' bar.\\n\\nIt started off well enough, a short wait on a Saturday night without reservations.  The sign outside says 'proper attire required' but I guess that just means shirt and shoes because my jeans and hoodies wearing party of 5 got on the wait list no problem.  They buzzed us in when our table was ready... except it wasn't ready.  not a big deal, it didn't bother me any that I was now in everyone else's way while we waited for our table to actually get ready.\\n\\nSat down and our server came to the table.  Friendly enough and everything seemed promising.  Steak was a bit pricey, but the sushi seemed reasonable on the wallet.  Rolls from $7-$14 I expect, and 2 nigiri/4 sashimi under $5 an order wasn't outrageous.\\n\\nEdamame for $5 is outrageous though.\\n\\nWhen I sit down for sushi, I like to start small and then order as I feel inspired throughout the meal.  So when the waiter took our order, I started with Sake nigiri and a 'Dragon' roll... something familiar to start it off so I could sort of see what it was about.  I explained to the waiter I'd be ordering more... so he took our menus with him when he left.\\n\\nSake Nigiri came out first and... uh... sad fish is sad.  Not fresh and laid on a bed of dry rice.  Normally I eat Sake as served, no soy, no wasabi.  It should have a soft buttery texture and almost melt in your mouth.  Not be dry with a grainy texture.  Failure.\\n\\nAfter that, the rest of the table was brought out, a couple of non-sushi eating friends got prime rib, and the other got roll, along with me.  We all shared the rolls and... rolls are a bit more forgiving on fish quality, so they were... passable.  Sauce saved them, keeping them from being too dry.  Except for one of the rolls which didn't have sauce.  Dry dry dry.\\n\\nAfter we ate, we sort of sat there, waiting for the server.  And waiting.\\n\\nAnd waiting.  It seems that the manager took him aside to get on his case about something.  Poor timing.  As we're sitting there, one of our party remarks that his fries never came out with his steak.  They just forgot to bring him a portion of his meal.\\n\\nServer finally comes out, apologizing profusely but the damage was done.  None of us were in the mood to order anymore.  He was mortified about the fries and did have them brought out so they could be eaten in isolation.\\n\\nA manager came out and apologized and offered my friend a complimentary desert.\\n\\nThey brought out a belgian waffle with powdered sugar dashed on top and a scoop of ice cream.\\n\\nGee.  Thanks.  TOTALLY MADE UP FOR A POOR MEAL EXPERIENCE.\\n\\nLooking at the other reviews, I guess I should have checked Yelp before I went in.\\n\\nLesson learned.\\n\\nAgain."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Got a chocolate cream cannoli and it was...unspectacular.

What else was weird is that the party next to us, who came in about 30min after us, got there order taken almost upon sitting and their pizza came out the same time as ours....So the whole thing about pizzas needing 20min was BS.

The breakfast bar, on the second floor, included with many rooms, was the best I ever had. Made to order omelets, every cereal you might want, croissants, bagels, etc., etc. I deducted a star for this reason: Austin is famous for, among other things, its huge bat colony under the Congress Avenue Bridge. That bridge and colony are less than a city block from the hotel. If you like being outside on warm days, you will contend with the very strong odor of guano. It is not a subtle fragrance, trust me.

The salad was amazing: thick slices of green tomatoes fried with a nice crust of seasoned cornmeal, and the huge lumps of crabmeat lightly coated in dressing. The bbq was terrific as well: that brisket was tender and had a great thick crust of rub, the ribs were a little disappointing, not as tender as we would've liked but the crust flavors made up for it, but the pulled pork was fantastic, tender, moist, and flavorful. The collards were equally delicious, and the slaw light and refreshing. It came with three sauces, their signature house, mustard one, and then super spicy, all tasty but the house had the best flavors overall. \\n\\nThe service overall was nice - especially the bussers, who were amazingly quick and would refill water before you had an empty glass.

Our order of Bombay Shrimp was pretty close to great - spicy and seasoned just right to make me think of home, but the ginger beef was AWFUL, drowning in black bean sauce, it was barely palatable. The Hakka noodles were good, but a bit off-putting with the large chunks of cabbage and the Manchurian chicken sauce was good, but the chicken pieces were extremely tiny, doubled-dipped in batter to make them look larger - an old Indian trick. It was also quite expensive for the small amount that the two of us ordered, but I suppose if you're one of two Indian-Chinese places in town, you can name your price. \\nThe wait staff, a set of funny, sweet young Chinese twins provides many smiles for the night with their antics and the owner was very nice, talking to my husband about how her family migrated to India, like thousands of other Chinese decades ago.

We found a sitter for overnight and booked our room through Priceline on the day of our stay. \\n     The front desk attendant was warm and very pleasant to deal with. (I wish I could remember her name so I could commend her directly). The concierge, Alex, was AMAZING! He helped to make our one night away feel truly like a vacation. \\n     The room was very nice, clean, and I was impressed that they had recycling bins in the hotel room.\\n     My only complaint would be regarding the cafe. We tried to go down for brunch at 11:08 only to find that they were no longer serving brunch off the menu (they had a buffet but it didn't look very appealing). Weekend brunch should be served beyond breakfast hours until AT LEAST noon, but more like 2pm, the way most good brunch establishments in this city do. \\n\\n*****Lost and Found*****\\n\\n     Last night before bed, I realized that I had left a brand new bottle (bought just the day before and only used twice!) of $38 face wash in my room. I didn't have a chance to call the hotel until today about the item. That's when the headache began.\\n     I called down to the hotel operator who ended up transferring me to housekeeping. The gentleman I talked to told me that it is their policy to \\"throw away\\" toiletries left behind, but that he could credit me for the amount of the item I left behind. I thought this was a bit absurd, but went with it. He pulled up my reservation. That is when he said, \\"oh... you booked through a third party. Well, I'll only be able to credit you the $23 you paid directly to the hotel for parking\\". \\n\\n     1) Toiletries, especially those used by guests willing to pay the price tag of this hotel, are usually NOT cheap! I am thankful that I only left my face wash behind and not a $90 face cream or a $150 bottle of perfume. \\n         These should not be items so easily discarded by the hotel!\\n\\n     2) The hotel should not be throwing away any guests items without first giving them at least a little bit of a chance to reclaim them. They don't have a way of knowing what is important to a guest and therefore should not be making that call.\\n\\n     3) \\"Throw away\\" - for a hotel which presents itself as being green with its in-room recycling bins, I was very dismayed to hear that they are tossed in the trash. It makes me think that they do this to the hotel provided toiletries as well rather than taking the time to make sure they are properly recycled. If that is the case, it is an enormous amount of waste.\\n\\n     4) If they are willing to refund a guest (in theory anyway) the value of the toiletries, then why are they throwing them out? They are just throwing away money.\\n\\n     5) Another thing I don't get- couldn't an unscrupulous person just say they left $50 (or an even greater amount) worth of toiletries in the room?  If they never make it to lost and found, who's to know they're lying?\\n\\nI have paid to have items of less value shipped back to me from hotels and in this case, I would have gladly driven over there to retrieve my lost item.

Service is definitely no the greatest;  I think they either need to hire a few more people or they be more efficient and attentive as it was so hard to flag anyone down for simple things like tea and they are always in a hurry to go.  The laminate floor was bumpy and you can literally jump up and down on it.  Not all tables had the fan above for bbq and area was probably  too crowded.  Renovations are still ok.

With my beau and David in tow, we left in our quest to find this highly recommended BBQ joint.  With none of us familiar with the area, we just winged it, nothing wrong with taking a unexpected scenic tour on a hot, summer afternoon, right?  Anyways, a bit down N. High Street, we zoned in our target in a parking lot of some kind of a convenient store - sorry can't remember, didn't quiet register anything else afterwards once I acquired my target.  After a quick look at Ray Ray's menu,  I decided on a brisket sandwich and the boys had the half rack of ribs and Sunday special, grass-fed beef brisket.  Service was fairly quick and friendly as can be on such a hot day... given the temperature, the guys inside Ray Ray's van must have been feeling like they've been cooking themselves alongside with the tender BBQ; much props to them for their friendliness and not forgetting their smiles to each customers despite the heat!  \\nAnyways, because I come from a place where BBQ is taken fairly seriously, I didn't set too high of an expectation since I didn't wanna get my heart broken.  However, Ray Ray's did not disappoint!!!  My brisket was moist and tender and had savoriness to it (although I felt that there was just little something missing.. but then again, it could be my Texan taste buds..).  And they didn't skimp on the brisket, either, and the meat was definitely the star~  Overall, a nice and simple, well put together BBQ Brisket that almost took me back home; no Southern Hospitality missed here ^___^"},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Long wait for just an okay food.

I am an artist myself but looking at artwork and eating food all by myself would get boring really quickly.  There is another reason for going with friends.  Obviously there are LOTS of people in the middle of a large city and it is safest to go with people you trust.  Not that The Gallery Hop is a dangerous activity, but it is common sense - especially for women.\\n\\nArt is the main reason people do The Gallery Hop, but a close second is food.

However we came back after 45 minutes and were seated immediately, next to another empty table which wasn't filled for another 10 minutes. Not sure if they let us eat a bit earlier or if they have a slow turnover rate to increase wait times...\\n\\nAmbiance: Very hip loud setting with young people all around. The lighting is extremely dark which gives it a romantic feel. However I couldn't even see my food and I like to think I eat with my eyes. They need to put candles on the table if they are going to keep their lights so low. Otherwise I'd recommend to bring your own candle. \\n\\nFood: \\n\\nHalibut Rice- such a burst of flavors in every huge! Decent portion for tapas. I enjoyed the saffron seasoning and the halibut. I did not understand the pickled side of vegetables that came with the dish though. Could've done without them. \\n\\nPupusa- my first time eating a pupusa. It's basically mashed up corn that is fried with lots of cheese in the middle. It's tasty and the cheese makes it filling. It was just one though, I feel that there should have been 2 for easier sharing.\\n\\nMatzo Ball Ramen half size- I was very excited to try Matzo Balls for the first time but was extremely disappointed when the half size portion only came with 1 Matzo Ball. I was satisfied with the portion size and the amount of different ingredients in the dish. The broth was rich and there were a great amount of noodles. It even includes a soft boiled egg. Wish there were at least 2 Matzo balls in the ramen for sharing. Especially since sharing is encouraged here. \\n\\nGrapefruit drink- amazing. Sweet but tart and with a colorful presentation. There was too much ice for my taste. \\n\\nService: The service was excellent but one server kept asking if we were done with our plates when we still had half a pupusa left etc. Maybe she couldn't see in the dim lighting but it got irritating."},{"name":"Rigoberto's Taco Shop","address":"15855 SE Mcloughlin Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Fast and great quality.

My friend was paying her half in cash and I was paying my half with my bank card. Well when our server returned he handed me a receipt with a $46 charge on my card! He didnt say a word, he must have thought I wasn't going to notice! So the manager comes to the table and explains that the check he gave us was a partial check. Wait, what?! So our total was really $71, but even so, WHY WASN'T I NOTIFIED BEFORE HE UNLAWFULLY RAN MY CARD FOR AN AMOUNT I DIDN'T AUTHORIZE!!!

We shared a small plate of chilaquiles (highly recommend) and went on to order our own entrees.

For spicy eaters though, I think calling it medium is about right.\\n\\nThe side dishes of cole slaw and mac-n-cheese were surprisingly good.  I am not a big Mac-n-cheese guy so the fact that I finished it all proves it is tasty.  The cole slaw was perfectly vinegary and the right cold temp to cool the mouth from the spicy chicken. \\n\\nOne of the best parts of the meal was eating the piece of bread that the chicken has been sitting on.

My first time here, the line went pretty far down the block, but I was at the door within a few minutes. However, once you get inside is where the real challenge is. Once you're beyond the door, it's basically a free for all. The single line spreads out to all the people behind the counter. You just gotta fight your way to the front because tourists really don't have any etiquette at this place. I found that what works best is to go along the sides because maybe you'll get one of the people along the side counters to spot you and help you, but at the very least you'll move forward to the back counter. If you go straight down the middle of the store you basically just have to wait until enough people in front of you clear out.\\n\\nThe thing they are most famous for are their cannoli, but they also have lots of other Italian desserts. Their cannoli come with multiple flavors, but I opted for the ricotta with chocolate chip. Other options are visible in their display case. Before I left Boston I came back and tried their lobster tail too. While the cannoli are obviously small enough for a single person, the lobster tail is something that no rational human being should try to eat in one sitting alone. Either share it with someone or break it up into multiple portions. It's good but there's only so much sugar your body can handle at a time.\\n\\nApparently there's a debate in Boston over which of these shops in the area serves the best cannoli. This place make great cannoli (and other pastries too) but I'll give the edge to Modern because of the ricotta. The fillings here are good but the ones at Modern tasted a bit better.\\n\\nThere are a few seats in the corner of the store that few people seem to notice because the mobs block view of them. No one really takes advantage of the seats here because a lot of people get their pastries to go, so just fight your way back out and you'll find these seats.\\n\\nAlso, it's cash only here so in addition to fighting the mobs, make sure you come prepared or all your efforts will have gone to waste."},{"name":"Punjabi Dhaba","address":"225 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"This is not a place to dine in unless you plan on taking a shower and throwing all your clothes in the laundry.

The concierge gave us some great tips and when my wife asked the drink server at the pool for a wine they didn't have at the pool bar she told us she'd be happy to to get it from the hotel bar, it would just take a little longer because she had to take care of the other customers.  That was really nice of her and I appreciate knowing why it took a bit longer and so I could tip extra for her helping us out.  They also had a variety of good live music in the lobby.   I'd definitely stay again.  \\n\\nSo why 3 stars?  They get a LOT right but drop the ball on easy stuff.  The first night they never cleaned our room. Housekeeping showed up at 3 and said they could only change towels. The next day housekeeping stopped by and changed the towels and made the bed.

At the patio no one took are order 2 nights in a row. I had to go to the bar to order drinks and food. The bartender argued a bit that the servers would help us on the patio. But they never did.  They helped a few people and talked to each other a bit.  At the bar they didn't have a wine I asked for and said read page 2.  Turns out they had a very similar wine. The bartender really should have mentioned that instead of a curt pointing to a menu and saying see page 2. It took about 10 minutes to find someone to store our luggage after we checked out.

We tried regular cannolis, florentine cannolis, chocolate mousse cannolis, custard cannolis, chocolate dipped cannolis, a lobster claw, and a mini Boston cream cake pastry.  Let me break this down for you:\\n\\n* Regular cannoli - delicious.  I love the shell, and I could eat a ton of these.  I wish the filling was slightly less sweet, but it was still excellent and the best cannoli filling I've ever had. \\n\\n* Florentine - Oh my god.  I don't usually like peanut butter, but we met some really friendly people while waiting in line who insisted that they're the best and that we absolutely must try them, so we got a few.  We should have gotten more.  The shell has the flavor of a peanut butter cookie, but it's crunchy and kind of like peanut brittle rolled around the ricotta cannoli filling and dipped in chocolate chips.  This was everyone's favorite by far.\\n\\n* Chocolate mousse cannoli - This is nothing special compared to the first two, and the filling isn't as good as the regular ricotta filling.\\n\\n* Custard cannoli - same verdict as the chocolate mousse.  You still get the good shell, but the filling isn't as good as plain.\\n\\n* Chocolate dipped cannoli - This is great if you're in the mood for something sweeter.  It almost tastes like an eclair with cannoli filling.\\n\\n* Lobster claw - This was very disappointing, and definitely the loser of the day.  The pastry tasted really bland after our cannolis, and the filling was overly sweet and lacked substance.\\n\\n* Boston cream cake pastry - This is good if you're in the mood for an eclair, but I still prefer the cannolis to it.\\n\\nI'd come here again in a heartbeat.  The line was long and hectic, but it moved pretty fast.  I wish they had more seating, because there aren't really any places nearby where you can sit and eat your pastries.

Something about diners only make me want breakfast food (maybe the occasional burger) because I think they make it the best. I would suggest going on off peak times like maybe around 6pm mid week where it's no as busy and you can breeze in, eat and breeze out. There's on street parking, so the earlier you get there, the easier the parking situation.

A lot of the restaurants can make pho broth by powder / msg/ food enhancer. \\nAll the cooking is done by owner himself. \\nOur favorite, other than pho, hot pot! Lots of vegetables and meat to your liking. Bamboo beef! We usually ask to cook little longer and add more pepper because we like it spicy! their fried egg roll raped  around lettuce, pork chops, chicken wings, their salad, beef flat needles, fried rice, basically all their food is excellent and tasty! You can taste food not just soy sauce. Good flavor worth all your money and trip. You can trust their food. I don't take my family to certain restaurants in town due to  food mis handles and out dated meats. \\nThis place is by far the best pho restaurant and Chinese food. Very clean and clean restroom. :) \\nOur family and friends eat at this place every week! \\nWe try other  new Asian restaurants but always comes back to China Jade!

At 12:30 I had gone back to check my spot to see if the time was still the same or if there were less people and we could dine there earlier. I was only inquiring curiously about our reserved spot when the hostess became extremely defensive, almost yelling at me repeatedly to come back at 1:00 and that she would call me when they had a free table. I was only asking curiously. Nothing else. Yet, she still yelled at my sister and I. I thought I was a customer. Apparently not. I went back at 1:00 and sat down. A couple of people who I'd overheard had appointments at 1:00 were ushered inside before us which is not a problem. But even at 1:15, we still had yet to be given a table. Frustrated, I lined up to ask her how long it would take. There were two groups of people lining up beside me, of which lined up AFTER I did. She saw me first but only smiled to help the other group beside me. Okay... After she finished with them, she smiled at me again and helped the group behind me. Only after I walked until I was almost in her face did she finally do her job in answering the customer. What the ****. Is this a competition to get her attention or what. To the hostess who worked today: do your fucking job properly or don't work at all. \\n\\nService from servers: aside from the nice server who helped us set up our table, other servers pretty much did their basic jobs without ANY conversation: when we waved our arms from them to take our orders, they basically just took it and left.

This one jelly with wild rice dessert I ordered was basically clear jelly with few pieces of rice. It tasted like water and sugar. No jokes. \\n\\nPrice: Way too overpriced. Tea which was bland and pale yellow (even after steeping for a long time) costed $4/person, which we hadn't been notified of. A small plate of sticky rice cost $15-16.

I had a chocolate-covered shell with ricotta and chocolate chips and a chocolate-dipped shell with vanilla custard, both were fantastic!  The main differences lie in the texture of the shell and consistency of the fillings.  The shell is difficult to describe, but it definitely has a fresher taste.  The fillings are far more light and creamy than Mike's, which is dense and overly sugary.  No one likes their cupcake frosting that way and the same holds true for cannoli filling.\\n\\nMy friend ordered a chocolate-dipped shell with chocolate custard and that was also very good.

We eventually ordered food, how ever the chicken came out cold. Ok so upon mentioning this issue the chicken went away and we waited. I swear we waited so long that I thought I watched a snail racing across to the finish line. Manager didn't come around to apologize. We had to stop one in his tracks to inform him the problem. And did he offer anything to make up for it? Or to stop us from leaving? Nope. Instead we got a typical \\"sorry\\"!!!!! So another. But that's not the point. We waited and waited until we were almost done with the salad. What is the point of having a chicken salad without the chicken? Sorry? That's it? Offer us a free dessert or something. So finally a hot plate of chicken came to our table by another manager. She offered \\"anything else I can do for you?\\" Yeah take it off our bill. Or give us a couple of sweet freebies so I can feel loved by cheesecake. So we finished our food. And waited another 30 years (as it felt) again watching the same snail moving to the other side of the finish line. Our waitress came and asked the typical question. Anything else? Yeah my check so I can escape the inescapable. And empty my tummy by walking. She finally came with the check. ****** and was anything done?******** noooo!!! So I grabbed the manager nearly pulling his shirt\\nOut and asked to take off the chicken at least because of the fact that we ate a chicken salad without the chicken. And did he offer anything? Nope!!! Typical guy who collects a paycheck to make a living. He doesn't care nor anyone in there. They are negligent, incompetent, inconsiderate, uneducated in management and just plain dumb people. Get your act together. Educate yourself in customer satisfaction, find someone who can teach you how to approach a dissatisfied customer. And for goodness sake grow a sense of humor and don't act like a dead doorknob. Yes I had to get him to take It off and he finally did. But why should I have to call them out for their mistakes.

So far removed from the generic pizza offerings you can find anywhere on the street. The flavors are complex and well thought out, while remaining simple enough for the mainstream to enjoy. My husband and I randomly stopped in. The first thing you'll order off instinct is the garlic knots, because you will see them floating around and smelling like butter and garlic. The knots are fluffy and tender, the marinara tastes really good too, even on it own. Because every pizza is being tossed and baked fresh, there is a little down time, so it gave us time to try the roasted cauliflower, it's not just your basic roasted veg, it's really flavorful with the chili and raisins. For a pizza decided to try the pie of the day, which had local pulled pork, grilled peaches, Rosemary, fontina and chili oil. The flavor balance of the toppings with the soft charred crust was a win. This place hasn't been opened long, but Pizza Bruno is a keeper, and I'll definitely be back.

Potato latkes are amazing and the sour cream and apple sauce take it to the next level.\\n\\nFriendly place that's great for any meal is the gist of it.

My favorite breakfast buffet is in the Pattaya Marriott Resort & Spa, and this one in the Cambridge Marriott is very close. It just doesn't have some of the exotic Thai delicacies available in Thailand. It seems strange that I wrote a somewhat scathing review of the sports bar here last night and this review is the polar opposite. This restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of the Cambridge Marriott and I just love the name. MC2 or mc2 is clever for one because the Marriott is adjacent to MIT, and it could refer to Einstein's famous formula for energy: E=mc2. One of Einstein's great insights was to realize that matter and energy are really different forms of the same thing. Matter can be turned into energy, and energy into matter. The other meaning of MC2 could be \\"Marriott Cambridge\\". Of course, I like the first explanation better.  Why? Because there was a lot of energy (E) in the restaurant: the hostess, the wait staff and the cook did everything possible to make my experience a good one. I ordered an all-veggie omelette w/a little cheddar cheese, with salsa fresca smothered over the top. They had fresh raspberries, blueberries and pineapple so I just added it to the mix. Yum. Where do they get fresh raspberries this time of the year? I don't care. I just love the idea of getting fresh raspberries in the Winter. McLuhan was right: we do live in a global village. Anyway, after that I brewed my green tea, and ordered a waffle: fresh raspberries on top and the waitress brought me the real stuff, 100% maple syrup. Yum. I polished everything off with a little oatmeal, sprinkled with powdered cinnamon, and mixed with blueberries and raspberries. The Hostess (great Boston accent) and the wait staff came over to talk with me throughout breakfast, asking me how everything was. It is apparent that they all love what they are doing.  All of this great food, attention to detail and the friendliness of the staff contributed to wonderful experience. All for only $17.95. I noticed that Yelp.com doesn't have the capability of writing the numerical equivalent of MC (squared). I went through all the trouble of going through my keyboard options to learn how to do it, and the \\"elevated 2\\" simply disappeared from my review.
