Their employees were very friendly and helpful and carried everything out to my car. (FYI: Although the parking lot is in the large Whole Foods/Borders shopping center off Ponce, Qdoba is right where all of the day laborers and bums convene, so expect to be confronted at some point.)\\n\\nThe students salivated over the sight of the quesadillas and said it was the best dinner they've ever had at a school function.

French fries? Listing fries on your most prominent signage for a restaurant is amateurish and tacky. In spite of this, we gave ABC Grill a try. \\n\\nInside the front door, you are greeted by a tiki head hanging on the wall. Odd? Yes. Once inside, there is a mixture of tiki heads, Chinese restaurant wall art & religious icons on display. The decor did not seem to be in line with an American BBQ restaurant excepting the neon beer logos hanging all around the bar. Although there is a hostes stand inside the door, no one was there and we stood for several minutes until someone finally greeted us. There was no apology for waiting, but we were seated quickly. \\n\\nThe service (and servers) was chaotic. They have been poorly trained (if at all) and do not conducted themselves professionally. To start, our server did not introduce herself, nor did she welcome us to the new restaurant. She did not offer to explain anything on the menu and did not ask if we had any questions. While taking our order, our server shouted over our heads to other servers regarding neighboring tables and we had to repeat the order three times. Soon after our order was placed we received a plate with two egg rolls and some sauce. Every table apparently gets this complimentary appetizer, which we didn't know. The server simply walked by our table and dropped them off and walked away. Again, egg rolls seem to be a strange fit for a grill , BBQ, & steak restaurant. \\n\\nThe menu offers appetizers (sliders, quesadillas, & grilled dates), a variety of sandwiches, platters with beef brisket, pulled pork, ribs, etc. Side dishes include Mac & Cheese, FRIES, collard greens, cole slaw, baked beans, mashed potatoes, cornbread, and baked potatoes (after 5pm). Customers will likely be turned off by a notification in the menu that all soft drinks are $1.00 with no refills. I have not seen this in a full-service restaurant since the 1980's. We drank water (which was not refilled either). \\n\\nWe ordered the beef brisket platter. Although the menu advertised that each platter comes with one pound of meat, we received a scant serving of razor thin brisket. It was very fatty and our plates certainly did not have one pound. In fact, I bet there was only about 1/4 of a pound on each of our platters. I have gotten more meat on a regular Arby's sandwich. The brisket was cold, too. Being a BBQ restaurant, I found it amazing that there were no BBQ sauces on the tables or even offered to us. The brisket was smoked but lacked good flavor, and a BBQ sauce would have helped. \\n\\nThe owners of ABC Grill are Asian (the husband and wife were walking around \\"putting out fires\\"). I do not mention this for any reason other than to say that once we realized they were the owners, the decor made sense---but it still doesn't fit an American BBQ.  But, in observing how the man interacted with customers and how his staff ignored him when he tried to make them do something, I felt a sense of doubt as to his restaurant knowledge. \\n\\nABC Grill is brand new and I understand they need time to work out the kinks, but after this first experience, we will likely not return."},{"name":"4th & Swift","address":"621 N Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Food was very good.

I had a spicy mayo-like sauce on the side (I forget the name), which added a nice kick.

Dishes come rapidly out of the kitchen   You don't order anything except your drinks. After that the real fun begins.\\n\\nEach cook brings around a dish they made and you can accept it or reject it. We had almost every dish except 3.  See photos.\\n\\nThe noise level is extremely loud but it almost completed the vibe and energy inside.

It was the most colorful dish with numerous flavors. Not a big veggie fan at restaurants but this is a do not miss dish.\\n\\nCorned beef tongue Ruben, Peruvian short rib, and the MOJO pork belly with yucca hash and plantains were a huge hit.\\n\\nThe drink special was some concoction with pea juice which was excellent, garnished with edible flowers. Each drink is made from a cart tableside which was a nice twist on a bar but they are fixed drinks meaning you get what is on the menu and no custom orders. \\n\\nThe snicker bar dessert was the big hit of all desserts.\\n\\nI would highly recommend this dinner to anyone who wants a fun experience with creative and very flavorful foods perfectly prepared with a high touch staff who want to make sure everything is a good experience.\\n\\nWe hear Kevin Gillespie is opening a Brautwurst and Beer Garden restaurant next.

In addition to our 2 entrees (husband got rib eye at $44), 2 sides, 2 glasses of red and a gin & tonic, we also got an order of oysters ($18). Oysters were very good and fresh.

Perhaps it's because we had prix-fixe menus for both times (first was through Dine Out Boston, second was for a private dining work event). The overall service was acceptable but still nothing notable and with the Dine Out Boston visit they did seem noticeably disinterested in us compared to the full priced patrons. I'll give an overview of each disappointment in detail. \\n\\nDINE OUT BOSTON\\nOne of my friends joined me for dinner after work. In retrospect I should have chosen a different location to do the restaurant week promotion for $38/person for a 3 course meal with a set menu of 3 options or so. (There are so many other options around Back Bay!) The bread was tasty enough to whet our appetites. My friend chose a seafood medley dish and I don't know what I was thinking with their meat loaf specialty. My entree was dry and nothing special especially if they served this stuff regularly. For dessert I ordered the Orange-Almond Cake and my friend ordered the Brownie Sunday. Both were good, but yet again nothing special.\\n\\nPRIVATE DINING\\nAs part of team building my team coordinated a lavish cocktails & dinner event. I overheard a quote that the private dining was around $90/person for a 3 course meal. First step with the cocktail was a disaster as my drink had sugar on the rim and it was simultaneously melting and dripping uncomfortably down my hand so I had to set it down. We had a few more options this time from the menu so I ordered the crab cakes since I didn't want to fill up early on. Some of my co-workers ordered calamari and the plate was huge! Definitely enough to share with everyone. The most disappointing part was the filet minion. I ordered it cooked medium. What I received was lukewarm and incredibly bloody. I have only sent a dish back on one other occasion (because the order was completely wrong) but I just could not choke down the extremely rare slab of meat. They were able to replace it but I had already ate a couple bites of the inferior filet minion. Then for dessert I culminated with another cold dish, the creme br√ªl√©e. I suppose many restaurants serve it cold but I prefer it warm/hot fresh from torching the sugar on top. \\n\\nIt would take a great effort to get me to come back here when there are so many other great options!"},{"name":"Dalo's Kitchen","address":"1533 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great meal (ordered the #2) for $8.

I have never paid more than $20 something for a bottle. Too cheap.  I stick to Oyster Bay or Cupcake or some form of those cheap bottles. \\n\\nThe wine was good. Nice and light and had a nice and peachy like taste to it. Being in a classy joint with my squeeze I couldn't drink fast which I normall do. If I was into red wine, they let us try this nice French win and it wasn't half bad. \\n\\nWe got a appetizer,  calamari. Simple and easy.  I've had better, but it was still good. The cream sauce, peppercorn was nice. Felt a little jipped on the portions, but i could stand to miss a few meals here and there. My girlfriend was a fan as well.   Better of been. \\n\\nI got all flustered when trying to figure what type of steak to get.  I read the menu and reviews for days before. But as always I find it tough to decide what I want.   I went for the porter house cut, and she got the lamb special.\\n\\nBoth were pretty hearty and tender.  I like my steak a nice medium.

Augustine's is painted with a solid coat of a yellowish butter color. And its the only building in the area that really looks like it hasn't given in to the underbelly of downtown Atlanta. Standing on its own, right off of Grant, it has its own free private lot, which probably says something about the success of this place somehow, considering how close it is to downtown, the paid parking capitol of the city.\\n\\nAugustine's is essentially a pub, so its not the best place for family gatherings with children, though, they don't card to my knowledge during the daytime at least (except for obvious reasons, like looking like your 16 and ordering alcohol). It is a great place to meet a friend, grab a drink, or have a relaxed date. It has kind of that woody, clean that's almost dirty because its so worn feeling. It doesn't bother me, in fact I kind of like it, but some may not be impressed because of that.\\n\\nThe beer selection here is EXTENSIVE. They have a very large variety of bottled and tap beer. All tap beer has its origin listed. There are at least a couple from Georgia. I can't remember if I saw one from Atlanta too. There is also a good variety of wines and cocktails. There was one that looked like a local wine. I believe it might have been from Grant Park, which was right next to the Pub. That's about as local as it gets. The one thing I'd like to see better is... it looked like there were a few choices on the menu that had been crossed out over time. It's probably time to not only print a new alcohol menu, but to try and get access to a couple new brews.\\n\\nNow the food... I had a mushroom burger. This same burger I've now had in three different restaurants. The other two had amazing flavor, and it has since been one of my favorite burgers to order. This one though, was lacking a little something in the seasoning department. Either the mushrooms weren't seasoned or cooked right, or the burger wasn't seasoned right. Maybe both. This is something that could probably be fixed by some more salt and pepper, and a little seasoning salt. Also, I don't think the mushrooms were sauteed the way they should've been to really give them that deep flavor. The fries were perfect, though. Seasoning was great and they were warm and crisp. The meal wasn't bad overall, but they definitely have a little room to improve. I think their chef could probably benefit from another cooking class entirely about seasoning.\\n\\nAll in all, I like the place. I appreciate that they have drinks other than alcohol on the menu too. It's a little far to drive since the food isn't mouthwatering, but I would go back again and try other things on the menu.

If you want a quick summary, the food was impressive.  We shared 9 entrees and a number of salads, and all of them had good flavor, pasta was properly cooked, and nothing was out of place.  The service was also good, especially given the restaurant has only been open a couple of weeks.  \\n\\nMy only nit was in regards to the wait for a table.  The restaurant isn't taking reservations at this time, but you can call ahead to be placed on the wait list.  We called prior to departing, and checked in and were told it'd be another 30-40 minutes.  It turned into being an hour an a half wait after we arrive.  The saving grace was that Steve the GM, kept us informed, and was more than generous in making up for our wait once we were seated.  \\n\\nFood highlights included the Caesar salad, which had a nice dressing that wasn't your typical, overly-gloopy, over-dressed salad.  The Tagliatelle with Tartufo al Parmigiano sauce was some of the best pasta I've ever had - rivals some five star restaurants in New York and San Fran.  The steak was also perfectly cooked and well seasoned.  \\n\\nService was spot-on, if not a bit overly attentive, but given the large party and how busy the restaurant was it was nice to have them taking care of water refills, asking about more wine, etc. \\n\\nFor a restaurant that has been only open such a little time, I was surprisingly impressed.

We also had the pad thai, which was well done and not overly sugary.  The massaman was wonderfully rich, and I loved that the meat was large drumsticks with the bone adding a ton of flavor.  We also had the Kao Soi which was great!  Loved the egg noodles, and again, a complex curry with many levels of flavor.  The additional sides of pickled veggies and hot sauce also added a lot.  \\n\\nHighly recommended and this is now our go to Thai place!\\n\\nJust read a few of the other reviews - one thought is, better to experience in person than take out.

It's in my neighborhood which has taken some major hits in the restaurant department. Unfortunately it was one of the worst dining experiences of my life.  I took my family for dinner and was immediately impressed by the way the place looked inside.  This is about the only positive thing I have to say about this place.\\n\\nWe arrived and sat down and we were all immediately surprised at how unprofessional the wait staff was.  The waitress had three tables to help and struggled the entire time to keep up.  The folks who sat next to us waited at least ten minutes before they were even greeted.  The people directly adjacent to us waited at least 15 minutes for their bill.  Another couple arrived and it wasn't long until we were all talking about how dissatisfied we were with the waitress. I'll also add that I'm usually very patient when it comes to the waitstaff, but this was so absurdly over the top it became comical after a while.\\n\\nThe worst part was that our waitress complained the entire time and several times uttered the phrase, \\"I'm just trying to get out of here!\\". We ordered a kids chicken finger meal and she charged us for an adult chicken fingers and then charged for the fries--an honest mistake, but it took 10-15 minutes to straighten out the mistake. \\n\\nThe \\"manager\\" had to come over and fix it and when she asked us how everything was we let her know we were less than pleased.  Instead of asking what she could do to fix it, she made a bunch of excuses and let me know that she was only the manager because the first manager got fired less than a week into the job.  \\n\\nI could go on but there is no need to beat a dead horse.  Long story short, she was probably one of the worst waitresses I've ever had, and that is saying a lot.  And from what I observed, the rest of the staff fell in line.  \\n\\nThe food was subpar as well.  I had a brisket sandwich and my wife had the pulled pork. The brisket was fatty, thinly sliced, and clearly not smoked.  The portion was also not what you'd expect from a BBQ joint.  The pork was also fatty and smothered in BBQ sauce.\\n\\nSave your time and money and go to a well established BBQ place.  I'd be amazed if it stays around for another six months.

(Actually, coming to 4th & Swift was probably the first time in two whole weeks that I ate off of real plateware, as opposed styrofoam, take-out cardboard, or TV dinner plastic. Sigh.  Feel lucky to have a job, feel lucky to have a job...)\\n\\nWe ate family style, and for the first starter, we had the foie gras special.  Mmmmm, rich, creamy, smoky, duck liver-y.  It could have been a little bit more firm, since it was a tad more fat-gooey than I like my foie gras.  Fabulous flavor though.  Sounds gross, right?  It's not.  And for all of you cursing me with your anti-foie gras sentiments...just skip onto the next review for pete's sakes.  Or watch the episode of Anthony Bourdain that shows how foie gras is actually made.  Better yet, read this: \\n\\nhttp://incanto.biz/2009/02/01/shock-foie/\\n\\nBack to the review...The raisin (?) bread that accompanied the foie gras was ill-conceived, I think.  Sweetness was too heavy along with the richness of the liver.  Should have just put down some good crusty bread, and be done with it.  The chutney was great though, good amount of acid.  \\n\\nThen we got a cheese course, all 4 selections were good.  Two pedestrian cow's milks, a funky creamy sheep's, then a goat's that kicked like a mule...or like a goat, I guess.  Accompaniments: some berries and fruits reduced in honey and a berry compote sauce.  Still would have like more bread or crostini, but instead got these crispy, thin, cracker-like sheets.  Forgot the name.  \\n\\nMains: got the diver scallops and the veggie plate.  Diver scallops were perfectly seared, not rubbery at all.  Sparingly seasoned, but just right. For scallops, less is so much more!  They sat ontop of a risotto that had good flavor, but I wasn't a fan of the texture, which was more thick sauce than rice.  The veggie plate had grilled root vegetables, grilled cauliflower florets, sauteed bok choy, and little bowl of mac n cheese.  The standout was the cauliflower, which I don't even enjoy usually.  Great flavor, smoky, but not too smoky, texture was firm but not crunchy (I hate mealy steamed cauliflower), and something about the flavor was quite intoxicating.  Couldn't put my finger on it...butter?  A mild hard cheese? Anyways, very well done.  Bok choy was fine, kinda like how my mom sautees it, simple.  I'm glad they even chose that as one of the veggies.  Mac n cheese was good too, but not noteworthy.  The roots were whatever.\\n\\nDessert: the espresso chocolate cake.  Good spongy texture, ice cream was good (caramel?).  Not spectacular, but good.  My dinner-mate was already full by this point so I had most of the dessert.  Of course, the sweet-tooth fiend in me opens up the second stomach I'm sure my body has saved for sweets, and polishes this dessert off.    \\n\\nService was quite attentive, and yet didn't hover.  Then again, while business was brisk in the restaurant, the economic climes as they are, the restaurant was by no means crowded, even on a Saturday night.  Overall, the ambience was nice (urban loft space, but not sterile-feeling), and the food was comfortably good."},{"name":"Charlie's Kitchen","address":"10 Eliot St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Aftah you pahk the cah at Hahvahd Yahd, throw back a few beehs with the boys -  head ta Chahlie's for a buhgeh.\\n\\nCan't read that sentence?

But that great time was had due to the fantastic company at our table and champagne we brought in ourselves. \\n\\nI can see where this would be some people's favorite spot; it's in a trendy locale, has an appropriately surly waitstaff, and the kind of menu that makes you want to order a bite of everything. But here's the thing: I already live in a trendy neighborhood, so that novelty is lost on me and I am just too old to be surly unless there's something to be surly about. So can someone please let the staff know that they'll get a much bigger tip if they actually smile and make eye contact every once in awhile? \\n\\nOur server started his introduction by letting us know he had just been tasked with changing the paper towels in the restroom \\"because apparently no one else can do it.\\" There are two inherent flaws here: a) I don't care where you were, just take my drink order, and b) why would I ever want to know that your hands were just busy doing work in the restroom, when you're about to touch my glass and plate? There were too many flaws related to the service to list. We watched them flip 3 different tables twice while we were there, my water glass was empty so long that I also emptied someone else's, and the waiter completely disregarded our request for a baguette (bread would've helped me overcome the hour+ wait-time from order to first bite). But it seems the biggest problem is that the place is completely disorganized from a service perspective. It doesn't appear that they have any type of table map, and if they do, they need a new mapmaker (is that a cartographer...I almost think I remember that from elementary school). \\n\\nNow on to the food. I really wanted to like my food. Everyone else at the table seemed to. I ordered the Napoleon Complex, which is a pressed sandwich with brie, prosciutto, fig jam, and red onions. Sounds great. But the prosciutto, which was stacked all at one corner of my sandwich, got tough from being heated; the red onions were inexplicably the pickled variety(!); and I had to use a knife & fork to get through the bread, as it had been \\"pressed\\" a bit too long.

Anyway, whenever I see fried mushrooms on any menu I have to try them. I must say they were fantastic, the horseradish-dijon sauce had a nice kick to it as well. The staff was super helpful and made sure everything was to our liking. I ordered the smoked turkey wrap, which was highly recommended, and it was phenomenal. I like fresh food. The crisp lettuce and fresh tomatoes and Swiss cheese on  this wrap was everything. My brother ordered the Augusta Burger which was topped with pimento cheese and fried pickles which was surprisingly good!It seems it could be very busy at night and during football season or any other sports season. The parking is decent,due to the time we where there. I like the spot, I would definitely stop by again when I am in the Midtown area. The menu also has fish tacos, Cuban, the crispy chicken club, and the buffalo bleu.  They also have their famous wings that you can order a single serving (6) to a hungry serving (50). Even for my seafood lovers there and buffalo shrimp that can be ordered for a single serving (10) or a double serving of (20).

One of my friends asked if the onions in her Tempura dish could be replaced with more of the other veggies as she's not an onion person. The waiter automatically responded that she couldn't have anything more but that they could take out the onions. So let me see, we get to pay the same price for less? Fantastic!  \\n\\nNext, we noticed that the menu clearly requests that in exchange for their courteous service, relaxed atmosphere and \\"healthy food\\", each person at the table is asked to spend $24.95.

Innovative idea to serve \\"Dimsum\\" style with chefs bringing dishes around for you to grab.  However, if you don't take a dish they \\"ding\\" you.  In other words, you can't have access to that dish later.  They give you a menu of sorts to look at which serves as your ticket.  They mark which items you have chosen.  So I saw an item or two that looked good.  I waited for those items to be brought around by the chefs, ignoring a couple of other fairly interesting items. The items I was interested in never circulated and then I was left with little choice.  At high prices for small plates I would hope to get to choose what I eat.  Wine extremely overpriced.  For two we paid over a hundred bucks for 2 drinks each and four very small plates that we shared.  More like tapas than a meal.  This is too much to spend on a few tapas.

I asked for cheese to be melted on top. Waitress said no problem. I said great. I then asked for a grilled bagel with cream cheese. Ok she said. She said that comes with home fries. I said great. My friend ordered a ham and cheese omelette with a side of bacon and no toast or home fries because he has a normal appetite. That's all we ordered. The food came right out. My hash and eggs had no cheese and she apologized. She forgot my home fries and she apologized. My hash was under-cooked and and my bagel wasn't really grilled very well.  It had been on the grill, but that's not what grilled means. My friend's omelette had very little cheese in it. I gave one star and that's because my coffee cup was never empty, and that alone is worth one star. $36+ was my total including tip. That's too much for what we had for a crappy underwhelming breakfast. With so many great breakfast joints in the area, choose any other unless you're just looking for a breakfast sandwich for $5.

The three of us decided to split the \\"large\\" taco combo, and our server recommended we get an additional taco each so that we could each have three. What he SHOULD have said is that this dish isn't meant for three people--it comes with two little empanadas and two cheesy corn cobs. Pretty difficult to split. The food was really disappointing--the tacos were insanely small, almost comically so, and definitely not enough to make a meal out of 3 or 4 as the waiter had told us. The falafel one was good but the rest were mediocre, visually unappealing, and everything was LUKEWARM. The empanadas were too gooey, the corn was too cheesy, and the little bowl of black beans and white rice with tomatoes was extremely boring.

The manager came over and made the bad experience worse. We were all so certain he'd apologize and offer some way to make it up to us, but all he did was explain that this is a \\"completely different restaurant\\" with a shocking \\"I don't think you get it.\\" All he \\"did\\" was point out that we did indeed get our free taco from filling out the comment cards. Which is what we were getting anyways.

A bowl of pho will set you back about $6-7, and the portions are very generous. Furthermore, the ingredients are much fresher than any other pho joint I've been to, and the broth is quite spectacular.\\n\\nI've had several dishes here, but some do stand out more than others. My most frequented dish is surprisingly the vegetarian bowl of pho. Vegetarian pho may sound like an oxymoron, and it may not be \\"authentic\\", but I don't care because it's effing delicious. The broth is sweeter than normal, but is flavored with some combination of delicious, savory spices and it has a generous amount of mushrooms, green beans, bell peppers, onions and tofu.\\n\\nI also really enjoy the spring rolls here more than other places.

This would have been bad enough, except that when we first came in, it took fifteen minutes before our AC/DC t-shirted waiter came over and that was only after a guy in the kitchen came out and brought us bread - the waiter had no idea we were even there. So with our limited time with a babysitter, I just ate the rare steak. It was outstanding. We shared a dessert which was a cream puff with mint and chocolate sauce which was passable but not anything to write home about, as was my cocktail.

I have been going to this restaurant for over 20 years. I have always really enjoyed the salad bar.  I have considered it one of the best on the North Shore. I have also enjoyed their prime rib especially the Kings cut. The Angus ribs I considered some of the best around. I was very disappointed this time around the salad bar was horrific. The cucumbers where mushy. The tomatoes were soft almost bad. I was just very surprised at the quality of the salad bar. The Angus ribs used to be all you could eat then a while back they change that and they gave you four nice ribs this time around the price increased by almost a third they gave me only three and the sauce definitely wasn't the same as it used to be it was a lot sweeter and really wasn't as good at all.  After 20 years of frequenting this restaurant I think I will be calling it quits :(   I will not rate it, as over the years it has always been a 3 1/2 or 4 star restaurant. This time around I would give it a 1 star or maybe even a 1/2 star.  I was very disappointed on the increases on price and the decline in quality of the food and extremely disappointed that they would have mushy food on the salad bar. I mean the lettuce was all brown and wilted??? I can't even go into it. All I can say is I hope things will change back the way it was in the past as the restaurant has a prime location on Pickering Wharf, it's great to go there and sit outside on a beautiful summer day or even during the winter for drinks and a nice meal by the fireplace. It seems to me that there may have been a change in ownership definitely at the very least a change in management everything was in a state of decline.  I will give it another try maybe in a month or so as I do have a lot of fond memories there, and hopefully it will go back to normal?????

I found out that if you get there before 6, you can do a 3 course meal for $29ish, so that's what I suggested to the kids & hubs and they agreed.  Since there were four of us, we got 2 pots of fondue for each course--cheese, main & chocolate.\\n\\nCheese: We did spinach artichoke & cheddar.  Both were really good, but the spinach artichoke was amazing.  That was a unanimous everyone's favorite. \\n\\nMain: The uncooked meat comes to you and you cook it in oil or broth.  We got one regular broth and one mojo.  We had to keep reminding the kids not to put cooked meat with the uncooked, and we probably made them a little OCD about it honestly, because now when we cook at the house, they freak out.  Anyway.  Both broths were equally good, but the dipping sauces were amazing.  Man, I could put that Teriyaki on pretty much anything.\\n\\nChocolate: Stepdaughter wanted plain milk chocolate, and I had read up and knew that the cookies and cream sounded the best.  My stepson and I have similar tastes, so we had one milk chocolate & one cookies and cream. OMG IT WAS SO RICH AND DELICIOUS!!  I really thought my stepdaughter would lick the pot clean, but everyone was so full that we couldn't.  \\n\\nOther: The service was great and it was a great phone/tv free dinner.

It seemed like they didn't want to serve us that night. We were dressed nice, celebrating three days of marriage and really felt like we were treated like second class citizens.

One of my all-time favorite restaurants is Khmer Kitchen (you have to check it out if you are ever in Philly).  I happened to be in Vancouver during my birthday weekend, and decided that out of all the restaurants in the city, I must come here for lunch.  We got here at 10:15am, approximately 15 minutes after it opened, so needless to say, I had very high expectations, which was probably unfair.  Overall, I liked the place, but it's more Vietnamese than Cambodian.  See below for the dishes we tried (by order of preference):\\n\\nButter Beef - the best dish we tried here, it goes to show that one should always follow the advice of Yelp reviewers :)  I was a bit hesitant to try what essentially was a beef tartare dish, but instead of minced ground beef, it was a big thin slice of beef.  The sauce on the beef was so delicious and went well with white rice.  The bf deemed this dish to be the best dish of the trip, which included Portland, Seattle and Vancouver. \\n\\nFried Chicken Wings - I was skeptical about ordering this dish at first, it didn't seem very \\"Cambodian\\".  However, I am glad that I listened to my fellow Yelp reviewers, as this was one of the best chicken wings I've ever had!  It was perfectly crunchy and packed with flavor, it didn't even need that sauce that accompanied the dish.  Moreover, it wasn't greasy and the perfect portion for two people (although we are probably not the best gauge as we tend to eat a lot!) \\n\\nSweet and Sour Soup with Chicken - one of my favorite Cambodian dishes, it's the dish I always get at the aforementioned Khmer Kitchen.  However, I was so disappointed when I tried it here.  People tend to call this dish \\"Hot and Sour\\" like the Chinese soup, but the Cambodian version should technically be \\"Sweet and Sour\\".  Here, the ratio of sweet to sour is completely wrong, it tasted as if someone in the kitchen dumped an entire jar of sugar into this dish.  Moreover, and I am being nit-picky now, they used canned pineapple instead of fresh ones, and it only contributed to the sickening sweet taste of the soup\\n\\nGarlic Clams - it was actually pretty good, however, more than 60% - 75% of the clams were empty.  I know what you are thinking, maybe the clam meat fell to the bottom of the dish.  Nope, they were just empty shells.  I wish I did a better job documenting the empty shells, but my hands were already dirty from the chicken wings, and didn't want to pick up my phone.  If I was a more out-spoken diner, I would've complained.

We drove around for 20 minutes... and in the heat, that does not go well in my book! We resorted to suing valet parking. Here was the worst part of this parking dilemma - the valet circled around - driving my car for 20 minutes and I saw my car pass me, sitting outside approximately 20 times. WHAT IS UP WITH THAT!? So DON'T valet park - the valet guy thinks its his car to cruise around the streets! \\n\\nLet me get to the better stuff - they sat us right away - the service staff were friendly and kept coming by frequently to refill water glasses and make sure we didn't need anything. \\n\\nWe started with the trio of pate - it was good - didn't like the chicken liver part but it's an acquired taste so it doesn't hurt my impression of the restaurant. We also ordered escargot and it was Sooooo good! The bread was hot and toasty that we devoured it quickly with the pate and escargot. I had the Chicken coq au vin with buttered noodle. I was hesitant at first because of the buttered noodle but the waiter explained its not what I would think and he was right - I couldn't taste any butter. I probably won't have coq au vin only because I didn't like the red wine reduction as much as I thought but the food was still extremely tasty. My friend had the special - the rabbit leg - and as an act of bravery, I took a bite and it was extremely delicious! I should have ordered it!!! Better than chicken! My fiance ordered the rack of lamb and I didn't try that but had a bit of the potato that came with it and the sauce was delicious! \\n\\nWe also had dessert - I had the profiterole with vanilla ice cream and fudge - it was sweet and I probably won't have it again but worth a try.

The chile studded cracker and soft, chewy rye deserve special praise, as does the crystalline salted butter. \\n\\nAfter each of us looked at the wine menu for a total of five minutes, the sommelier arrived out of nowhere and guided us to a delicious wine.\\n\\nThis time, the uber smooth mashed potatoes beat out the truffled tater tots...barely.\\n\\nThe service was very professional and attentive without hovering.\\n\\nThe only negative was being squeezed together on the first floor so that a private party could have the second floor.

At times, very hard to hear the person next to you -- one of the drawbacks of setting up shop with a sort of \\"country industrial\\" vibe. I think they'll need to do a ceiling treatment of some kind because the place just echoes with sound as it gets lost in the exposed ceiling.\\n\\n-- Tables: The clamped on sideboard things between each two-top are kind of clumsy and get in the way. The clamps often hit your elbow. I would remove.\\n\\n-- Wait Staff: Fabulous staff, they just need to figure out a more graceful way to \\"check mark\\" you menu every time you select a dish. A few times it was awkward how the waiter would reach across our table just to grab our menu to \\"check\\" the box next to an item we ordered.

So, while my most notable visit was spent downloading the entire Belle and Sebastian collection from the older guy sitting next to me... this is still a great place to go and get caught up on your school work... or Yelp reviews. ;-) \\n\\nThe coffee can be either good, or bad, depending on how much sugar you put in it or what you order. Their \\"white cow\\" mocha is pretty amazing. They have ice cream and all kinds of fattening pastries to eat, if you get their early in the day before they run out. For a while, my favorite thing to get was a  no-bake cookie. Yum, if they still have those when you come in, it's worth a try. Drink wise, however, they win in their blended drinks, which are sinfully good. (Sinfully as in... calories!

Bacon was raw, meat was tasteless and mashed potatoes were worse. $15-1 out of 5\\nHamburger and fries--good size hamburger, dry and not very tasty, fries same as above. 1 out of 5.\\nIced tea-colored water 1 out of 5\\nMeal with tip-$60\\n\\nNever again.

It took your staff more than 15 mins to greet and seat us. No one was friendly at all, and were told that the kitchen will be closing in 5 min.

I was really disappointed because I have been talking about coming here forever. \\n\\nThis was not a good experience. To make things worst I reached out to the company several times, and I was completely ignored. I know I have been ignored because I wrote comments on their IG but they never responded plus an DM message. I was trying not to take my experience out on them having a waiter not doing their job 100% but I will never come back. As a business owner myself treating your customers like you at least appreciate them is big and goes far. I wasn't asking for much not even a refund. Just some feedback from the company to acknowledge and apologize. I see why our waiter BEN was acting the way he was, because this is how they allow their company to be ran.

Second stop on the list being Z'Tejas. Its been roughly 20 years since I had the ruby trout entree that I used to love; revisited it lived up to its former grandeur. \\n\\nThere are alot of bites I still wish I could still consume. The Italian chicken fried steak and the happy hour chicken and eggplant pizza for $3 comes to mind at Spaghetti Western now Freddie's Place in South First. One last batch of fried catfish filets at Convict Hill Restaurant in Oak Hill, maybe one last slice of Pantera's pizza. \\n\\nEnough reminiscing, we started our meal with the cornbread. If my memory is correct it used to be thin baguette slices. Served in a small cast iron skillet, the yaller paired well with the sweet cream butter. We also sampled the shrimp tostada bites for an appetizer. Perfectly cooked shrimp with guacamole and a dab of chipotle. The slaw garnish was also really tasty.\\n\\nThe ruby trout was close to what I remember. For some reason I think the mango in the relish wasn't there in the past. The fish nicely grilled with crispy edges was a blast from the past. Decent rice and flavorful green beans rounded out a great dish. Mrs. Rooster opted for the wild mushroom enchiladas and came up with similar praise for her dish.\\n\\nLooking around while we were waiting to be seated, the digs haven't changed that much. One of my friends exclaimed that he gave up Z after Jack Gilmore left; and they took his favorite Navajo tacos off the menu. The day we visited, the tacos were actually a lunch special so their still around from time to time.

My girlfriend got the smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel, which she wanted toasted. He didn't ask if she wanted it toasted, she didn't know she had to ask for it to be toasted, and by the time she realized this, he had already thrown together most of the sloppy creation and she felt too bad for him to ask at that point. When I ordered my egg and cheese sandwich and specifically asked for the bagel to be toasted, he ignored me. When I asked again if I could have it toasted, he said flat out \\"No.\\" Finally one of the other employees overheard and leaned in to tell me that the bagel I had chosen couldn't be toasted because it had cheese baked into it. Good to know. I wish he had told me when I had first asked for that bagel, and asked for it to be toasted.

The answer to that is a resounding \\"mehhh\\"...\\n\\nI had the tuna tacos blackened and medium rare along with a fried crawfish platter.\\n\\nThe tuna was mouth wateringly tasty. Seated ever so slightly and seasoned just enough to bring out the natural juices. It also comes pretty thoroughly doused in their own special sauce which is just a little bit sweet and a little bit tangy. Round that out w a drop of lime (they give you an entire half of one), the crunch of fresh slaw, and a soft but sturdy flour tortilla, and it's pretty much the perfect fish taco. 4.5/5. All it lacks is a little bit of wow factor. It's the perfect fish taco, but honestly there are a lot of perfect or near perfect fish tacos out there. Nothing here to set it apart.\\n\\nThe fried crawfish was a straight up 3/5. Maybe ordering fried crawfish was my first mistake. I'm not sure crawfish were really meant to be fried. In either case, they were ok, but I've got to compare these to fried seafood in Boston, Maine and New Hampshire...and it doesn't come close. They were crispy, and that's it. Not a whole lot of flavor and cocktail sauce by itself won't make up for that.\\n\\nAtmosphere is a lively sports pub. On a Tuesday night, there were a ridiculous number of TVs to watch the nights games on. Of note, you can choose to sit at the pub next door, or simply order takeout from the window outside. I probably would not take kids here at night as it doesn't really seem to be a family restaurant.\\n\\nService was decent. The bus girls made it feel like a more modest hooters as there clearly seems to be an attractiveness baseline for hire...But maybe that's just average for Texas. The girl taking orders at the window though was a different and a bit slow.

The decor is quite nice (although we were wearing jeans and didn't feel out of place), and they have a cute space for outdoor seating as well.\\n\\nThey gave us complementary edamame, and although it was a bit overcooked and oversalted, it was free, and it was still pretty good.\\n\\nWater refills were slooooow.\\n\\nWe opted to order the sushi and sashimi boat for 2.  This came with miso soup for the both of us.  Not too bad.  The seaweed was a bit chewier than I'd like, but the tofu and the broth tasted very nice.\\n\\nNow, onto the sushi.  No complaints about the actual sushi on the boat (rainbow roll and tuna roll).  There was a bit more sashimi than sushi, or so it seemed to me.  I eat my sashimi and sushi with no soy sauce and no wasabi, so the freshness of the fish is paramount, since no other flavors are involved.  Definitely not the freshest fish I've ever had...but not old, either.  Sort of in the middle.\\n\\nOn the plus side, along with the boat came a martini glass that had sashimi on it, and we quickly realized that underneath the sashimi was a seaweed octopus salad that was quite refreshing and tasty.\\n\\n3 stars because this place is pretty much indistinguishable (price, service, and food wise) from most other sushi places I've been to here in Columbus."},{"name":"Anthony's NY Pizza","address":"1455 Semoran Blvd","city":"Casselberry","stars":"4","text":"Served quickly from friendly workers.

With it being Good Friday and our anniversary, we have been in seafood mode all day. We tried a new place for lunch after reading the reviews from other Yelpers and unfortunately it was not a good experience. With that behind us, let me tell you about dinner tonight...\\n\\nOne of the main reasons we chose them over the other places tonight was they had outdoor seating and it was a perfect night to eat outside. Their outdoor seating was a perfect setting because of the weather and it being a full moon. The electric fireplace by our table was a really cool touch. My only complaint was the lighting was a bit dim on the patio but since it was our anniversary, it was a nice with the light of the fireplace. On our way to the table I took a picture of the fresh fish on hand and they had a nice variety to choose from. \\n\\nOur server brought us some smoked fish dip and Ritz crackers to wet our appetite. As usual I ordered my unsweet tea with lime and baby just wanted some water with lemon. When she returned I was still a bit indecisive but our server was patient with me and helped me decide on something. Her witty personality made for a fun dining experience but I finally made a decision because I could see my wife was ready to order. She quickly ordered the Jerked Grouper Tacos and I ordered a cup of the tuna Chili and the Shrimp and grits. Yes, you heard me...  Tuna Chili...  Morbid curiosity to be truthful...\\n\\nWe polished off that smoked fish dip in no time... I have had smoked fish dip from a number of places and this was the best one I have had to date. It had just the right amount of smokiness but not too much to overpower the taste of the fish. The buttery flavor of the Ritz crackers was a perfect match to the dip. I no sooner ate the last of the dip and my cup of chili arrived. It looked and smelled like regular chili but that first bite let me know right away that this was tuna and not beef in my chili. I was really surprised at how well the flavor of the tuna stood out but in a positive way. I personally prefer my chili a wee bit spicier as a rule but this was the perfect amount of seasoning to allow the flavor of the tuna to remain front and center. NICELY DONE!\\n\\nWhile waiting for our entrees our server walked past with an order of crab cakes for another table that just lit up my senses. I will be coming back JUST to taste their crab cakes because I still can't get the smell of them out of my head. \\n\\nOur entr√©e arrived and the presentation was quite unique. Her tacos came as shells with on a plate and the jerked grouper in a small skillet. My wife gave me a bite of her taco and oh my god... That was one FANTASTIC taco. Their jerked seasoning was one of the best I have tried so far on grouper and I have jerked grouper from a lot of places over the years but only one place I can think of tops this version in my opinion but they are 2.5 hours away from me. Sigh... \\n\\nAs for the shrimp and grits... I looked at my bowl and thought... \\"OK, that is it?\\" Well let me tell you... I love it when my mind gets put back in check. That bowl had some grits in the bottom and a mountain of shrimp on top of it. The bowl made it look small but I found out that there was a LOT of food in that bowl. Straight up... Those shrimp were cooked to perfection and the seasoning was just right in my opinion. It is not what you would expect from The Big Easy but the sweetness of the grits was the perfect balance for the flavor of the shrimp. Last and CERTAINLY not least was that little nugget of heaven next to my bowl. It looked like a hush puppy but it tasted more like a cake donut with a crispy shell. Right now I am having a food moment just thinking about it.\\n\\nI will warn you now; the portions look a lot smaller that you realize they are once you start eating them. My wife only made it through 2 of her tacos and I struggled to eat that last taco of hers. Yes I made it through it but now I was had JUST enough room for dessert. I will have to tell you about their desserts next time I come here and there WILL be a next time. We had already planned to get some of that homemade Gelato from Rome's Flavours. Great gelato is hard to find and we go there every time we are in Winter park it seems...  lol\\n\\nYou can expect to see future reviews from me about this place because ever since moving to Orlando, I have been complaining about the lack of SERIOUS seafood places. I have FINALLY found a place that is in MY opinion, GREAT seafood. After spending 20 years in the Tampa Bay area, I became a harsh critic when it comes to seafood because there were so many good seafood places around me.

I enjoyed even more than the sweet version.  It retained it's caramel notes and is surprisingly smooth despite its potency.

We usually stay at the holiday inn or Wyndham across from downtown Disney. I thought this would be a nice step up. Unfortunately, when I checked in I found out about a $23 resort fee per day. So, since I booked on Hotwire, my nightly rate was now up to $113. She then tells me ok, there will also be a $10 per day for self parking or $15 per day for valet. So I opt for self parking, so now my nightly rate is up to $123. No big deal, it's a little more than Wyndham or holiday inn. I was still excited because the lobby is gorgeous, and welcoming. I go back to the car to park and grab the luggage. We proceed to the self parking which is literally a 10 minute drive. There wasn't a spot in the 500 spot parking lot. In fact there see cars parked on the side roads and grass that said no parking. I dropped off my fianc√©e at the self parking hotel entrance and went to park the car literally 300 yards past the self parking lot. I got to the room slightly heated, and called the front desk and asked whats up with the parking, she said oh there's a pageant in the hotel so parking should get better later. I asked if they could provide complimentary valet service for the hotel guests, she said she she had no control over the parking and by no means can she comp the parking rate. I said is there nothing else she could do? She said unfortunately not I'm sorry sir! \\n\\nThe next day I called and asked if it was possible to do a late checkout as I thought this was a normal question. The front desk responded by saying unfortunately, we are fully committed so you will be responsible to checkout as normal at 11:00am. Now I understand the NAM pageant that was being held in the hotel is a priority, but you cannot allow it to affect the overall function of the hotel. \\n\\nThe pool is amazing, but unfortunately the weather did not permit for a fun day at the pool. I think going forward I will continue to book my stays at the holiday inn or the Wyndham down the street. I worked in the hospitality/hotel business long enough to know that banquets are important to the business of a hotel, but if an event effects the hotel guests in anyway the guests need to be compensated accordingly. The extra people on the property greatly effected the elevators as well. It was consistently 5-10 minutes on an elevator not to mention the wait before getting on the elevator. \\n\\nI'm a baseball fan and was looking forward to watching the home run derby at the white horse saloon and sports bar, but no this bar was not even open for our stay. Very disappointing Hyatt! I feel like since I reserved on Hotwire I was maybe discriminated against, maybe that's why I kept getting told no sir!

This is a really chill, laid-back burger joint with zero pretension.

That, my friends, is when you come to P. Terry's.\\n\\nThe times we've gone to P. Terry's have been great experiences and both times we visited with friends and everyone in our party left happy.  The counter service is super efficient and friendly and the interior is almost always really clean.  You know how sometimes you go in a burger joint and your shoes stick to the floor?  Well this ain't that kind of joint.  It's still got a healthy dose of too-cool-for-school as even the most down-to-earth of Austin spots tend to get, but shake it off for the burgers totally outshine any weirdness you could feel about not fitting in.

The problem with franchises is that the parent companies do not manage them and because of that there is no consistency anymore. When I go to a chain restaurant I expect the prices to be the same and the service as well.\\n\\nThis place just throws that all out the window. They have their own prices, they run their own promotions and do whatever they want to customers. I really hate coming here because it seems like something will always go wrong, and when I went in yesterday morning, there was no difference.\\n\\nI went in with my family to redeem some new coupons that McDonald's offers for their new Egg White McMuffins. The coupon says \\"Limit One Coupon per person per visit.\\" I figured then that each of my family members (3 plus myself) could use them. I thought that we could just order individually so there would be no problem. After I placed my order, the cashier goes and says to everyone else in my party, \\"Will this order be altogether?\\" Clearly knowing that we would not be able to use all the coupons either that or she just didn't know anything about the coupons themselves. After she rang us up, the price came up and the total was incorrect. She ended up charging us for two of the McMuffins, even though she took two of the last four coupons. I told her there was something wrong with the price.\\n\\nShe called the manager over to look at what happened. He told us that he wouldn't be able to honor the last two coupons because it exceeded the limit per visit apparently. He then goes on to say to read the coupon, which he said a lot of whenever I would argue that he was still suppose to honor them. Nothing got resolved and nor did he offer any other solution to the problem and neither did the cashier for that matter. \\n\\nWe ended up paying for two McMuffins because they would not honor the coupons even though they took them. I had to make sure that I asked for them back. After that was all done, I told the cashier that I would be filing a complaint with McDonald's about this situation and she had a look on her face that told you that she didn't care, a kind of \\"whatever\\" look on her face as if to say this happens a lot there. After we sat down, we waited for our order. as it turned out, they didn't even announce our order number and it was just sitting on the counter waiting.\\n\\nThe training of customer service here is just awful. It's like they just hire anyone who can follow directions and do only what they intend to do, take people's money. They don't care if they get your order wrong or make a mistake or not honor your coupon or offer anything in return. It seems their only concern here is that they get as many people through their lines as possible. Notice I didn't say fast because that is another thing they do not excel at.\\n\\nI ended up taking my other coupons I had to another McDonald's in the Westlake area on Bee Cave road and Walsh Tarlton. Here's a story of what great customer service is all about, and is expected at even a place like this. I order just my McMuffin and she brings it out to me. My other family member order theirs and another one, since they decided they wanted to eat now. After each one ordered individually, the cashier told us that she could have just taken our order together. Can you believe that! The riverside location gave us all this trouble but another McDonald's provides us with real customer service! Goes to show that this riverside location needs a drastic change in management and ownership.\\n\\nJust like the other review says, Be Warned if you come here. Just be aware that just because one McDonald's tells you something, doesn't mean that all the other locations do the same. I filed a complaint on the McDonald's website just like I said telling them what had happened and saying that I want a refund on those McMuffins they charged me for."},{"name":"Laughing Planet","address":"1720 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The food is excellent!

And if you don't know exactly where Sun in My Belly is located and you blink, you'll miss the minuscule sign at the top of the restaurant. \\n\\nAlso, Sun in My Belly is serious about their reservations. If you aren't on time they will kindly call you and let you know your reservation will be canceled. However they are more than accommodating to make sure you are seated as soon as possible. \\n\\nI ordered Sun in My Belly's Belly Benedict which is a twist on the traditional Eggs Benedict. The Belly Benedict is two poached eggs with chipotle hollandaise sitting atop a sweet potato and honey glazed bacon hash and saut√©ed spinach, served with a buttermilk biscuit.  \\n\\nAlthough the hollandaise sauce was supposed to be made with chipotle, I didn't taste a hint of heat. That was rather disappointing because one of the reasons I ordered the Belly Benedict is I love anything made with chipotle. \\n\\nAlso, I didn't detect the honey glazed bacon in the hash. By now you know I love bacon so that was definitely a fail for me. I would prefer if Sun in My Belly used thicker chunks of bacon. Whatever bacon they did use got lost in the shuffle of the hash.\\n \\nHowever the combination of the spinach and sweet potatoes was spectacular, and the poached eggs were perfect. \\n\\nI split a carafe of mimosas.

However, there were some issues with our food. Two of our meals included different risottos (stuffed chicken with a mushroom risotto and scallops with a coconut cream risotto) and neither of them were cooked well with much flavor. But the biggest issue was three of us got meals with scallops and one person's scallops were raw, so we sent them back, and the same ones that were bitten into were brought back out charred on one side. \\n\\nWe brought this up with the manager who apologized and made sure we got new scallops, but these were charred on both sides, and the burnt flavor ruined the overall taste. The manager checked on us again, which I really appreciate, but honestly we didn't feel like complaining again because we didn't want to wait or continue making an issue. It's a shame because their menu looks amazing, but the food isn't actually cooked that well. \\n\\nThen when we split our checks, the server gave us the right checks initially, but then charged one of my friends for my boyfriend's food in addition to his own check. I don't know how that happened but it seemed like an appropriate end to our night of issues ÔøΩ?\\nTo end on a positive note, this place is definitely worth going to for drinks and appetizers, though.

The waiter was a little pushy, trying to sell us margaritas and appetizers, which we didn't want. Waited 45 minutes for our food.  I told the waiter I wasn't very hungry and just wanted a little something, like a salad, so I ordered the Caesar, which was $5 on the menu.  When we got our bill, my husband paid it, and then I saw the receipt and noticed we were charged $9 for a Large Caesar, which I didn't ask for and was not on the menu.  I guess that upcharge was meant to make up for lack of ordering drinks and appetizers. It was late and I was too tired to say something to the waiter or manager, but they lost my business.

I was just about to call Howard who was running late due to traffic when the truck arrived with some fresh Louisiana oysters. I wish I had taken a picture of the tag showing their origin.\\n\\nWayne opened the first oyster and there was a HUGE difference. They were plump, juicy and fresh off the truck! Howard arrived and we started off with a cup of the Gumbo. Straight up, I have only had ONE cup of Gumbo that was better and I was in New Orleans when I had it. There was a generous portion of seafood in the Gumbo and it was thick as you would expect a good Gumbo to be. I did not have to add ANYTHING to it. \\n\\nWe ordered a bucket of oysters (2 1/2 dozen per bucket) and Wayne gave us all the usual tools to feast on raw oysters BUT...  These oysters were so good that for the first time in my life, I did NOT need lemon, cocktail sauce and a cracker. They were nice and salty as a good oyster should be and were not at all slimy. The texture was perfect. Not too chewy and not too firm and NO grit whatsoever. We polished off that bucket in no time and ordered a second bucket as well. I kid you not... I felt like I died and went to oyster heaven last night!\\n\\nOne of the servers heard me raving so much she came over and admitted she had never tried raw oysters. I insisted that if she wanted to try them, this was the  batch to try and she did. The look on her face was priceless when she realized they actually tasted good and were not at all what she was expecting. I even took a picture of the moment!\\n\\nWayne introduced us to Mike, the owner, and I asked him when he was building one over in east Orlando and his response indicated that I would be dealing with the traffic of Semoran to get some great oysters!

We arrived for a late (11:00) breakfast excited to try a new place with good reviews. The first server was a pleasant young woman. In the dim cramped basement space, we sat next to a window.  Things on the menu seemed lower priced and the specials sounded good so I ordered the hash special with eggs over medium. After adjusting to the space we noticed the vertical blinds on the window splattered with food. A trip to the restroom sends one past a mess of a kitchen. I received a cold slice of a pre-made, unrecognizable conglomerate of \\"food\\" topped with over-light eggs and cold roasted potatoes on the side. The hash would compare to one of those breakfast casseroles someone makes from mixing frozen ingredients with tons of cheese, served at a potluck where it sat a while. My companion went with scrambled eggs and bacon. They added cheese she didn't ask for and the bacon was like jerky. After we were served, the server checked in but never came back. After eating then waiting another 20 mins, it must have been my first mistake to ask for the check, then when my portion was significantly more expensive, I asked that my companion and I be charged separately. The curt person (who MUST be Randy according to similar reviews) apparently didn't hear me say yes when asked if I wanted a copy of the receipt. (I've never been asked that at a restaurant, theres just always a customer copy of the receipt.) He offered a receipt again as we departed and when I said yes, scolded me about saying no the first time. I told him I had said yes at the table which made him angry, argumentative and insulting. I'm a grown man so I didn't jump in his childish dramatics. We don't know the inner workings of each other. But when your business is to host and feed people, the LEAST you could do is not insult your guests. I'm a paying, tipping, Yelp reviewing customer.

The classy ambiance, superb service, and scrumptious food is often the rationale for the hefty price tag at establishments such as this. For this very reason leaving a harsh review for a slightly less-than-perfect experience is also reasonable, am I right?\\n\\nNothing went terribly wrong per se, but nothing was mind-blowing either. Yes expecting to have your mind blown off is a reasonable expectation at places like this, see above logic. Yes the ambiance is modern/unique for a steakhouse and the host/hostess was nice/courteous, but aren't they all? When you put on a brand name item, you want to feel a million bucks. I felt like maybe fifty bucks that night. No, maybe thirty five. Let me tell you why.\\n\\nThe crispy calamari was too loaded up with too much sweet sauce (I immediately thought of duck sauce) and greased up with too much oil - what happened to the good ol' plain calamari? \\n\\nOnto the main course, the savory steaks! Not. I had the 16oz Dry Aged Prime Ribeye since it was one of only a few dry-aged & prime grade; it costed $9 more than how I initially felt about myself ($50) = $59. For a prime and dry aged steak, it was not as tender and flavorful as I had hoped. It was too charred on the sides which made somewhat hard and inedible. Normally, it wouldn't be horrible steak if you had it at Outback Steakhouse or something but at a \\"$$$$\\" joint, I can comfortably say that it was a below-grade steak. My girlfriend's filet was virtually flavorless and dry, no juice to it at all. My brothers got the bone-in delmonico, which they mentioned was very tough and over-salted on the outer layer, and flavorless/tender on the inner. Given that it's probably not a prime-grade piece of meat at this prime-priced establishment, it was disappointingly somewhat expected. I haven't gotten to the worst part yet. \\n\\nThe biggest point deduction here is due to our server. This guy had no emotions whatsoever, it felt like I was being served by the Terminator or something; he didn't attempt to talk to any of us, didn't care to ask to refill drinks, never came to ask how everything was. Basically dropped off menus, took our orders, and brought our check. The bus person was more accommodating than our server; at least he told me that my plate was very hot. Maybe he had a bad day, but man...it has to be understood that when one plans to put down at least $100 per head, that they're really paying for the service and ambiance; put on a fake smile or something. \\n\\nThere's usually a ton of street parking across the street, no need to waste it on valet."},{"name":"Pad Thai Cuisine","address":"1201 Barbara Jordan Blvd, Ste 1220","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I go here at least once a week, the food is excellent and reasonably priced.

Being a creature of habit, I kept veering across the street to Pig Floyds until today. I biked here on the urban trail and worked up a good appetite. Yep, there's a signpost out front to lock your bike to. There's also a proper bike rack in the back but I didn't know until after I'd eaten. \\n\\nThe place was packed. This was Saturday around noon and there wasn't an empty seat. But, the place is geared up for a quick meal and it was moving right along. \\n\\nI'd already read some reviews and heard the guac was great, so I ordered some and a pork fat taco. Got a plastic cup for water. I grabbed a stool right in front of the kitchen. Pretty quick the staff shouted my name and the guacamole appeared. You might think $6 is a lot for guac, but it was at least a couple or 3 avocados worth and it was just chunky and seasoned exquisitely and I couldn't have done that myself... \\n\\nThen, the pork fat taco came. At that point the guy had called my name twice so we were on a first name basis. Let me tell you, I thought it was a bit on the small side at first. But, as soon as I took a bite I knew this was the place. Thank you Black Rooster. That taco was hot, the meat was crunchy and fresh, and I absolutely loved it. \\n\\nNext time the guy walked by he said \\"Everything good Mike?\\" and I felt like this place had it all going on. Nice staff, great food and a definite rhythm.\\n\\nI have a pretty big appetite. I ordered just one taco thinking I'd take my time and then get another. I wound up with a lot of guacamole and fresh, salty chips after I ate the one taco. I didn't have room for another!\\n\\nThen, I took the rear exit. Behind the restaurant, there's seating but I think I remember reading that it's for the bar next door. There's also a little jewelry trailer and ... an Airstream Bambi begging me to find out what the story is. Love those. Like I said, there's a bike rack and there's lots of parking in back. \\n\\nWhoever put this restaurant together knows how to arrange things. The menu is creative and next time I'll try some other tacos. The beer was tempting, too. I was designated bicycle rider today, so that'll keep for next time I drop by.

Since everyone usually gets the same, and they can count on it, so it is all pre-made now or at least tastes like it. \\nThe last two times I ordered the beef luc luc it seemed like someone had just scooped it from a warming tray because it was luke warm and not \\"fresh\\" as what I remember it to be years ago. And it was the same with everyone around the table. I had this feeling of being scammed or treated like an idiot. The wings, are no longer made with love, they're scooped from a pre-made bowl. How do I know this? Well, we got 3ish actual wings, and 6 wing tips...I think the consistency no longer exists. And I understand that it is their way of dealing with the high volume. I am OK with them seating me at a table with others but if anything, quality should never be compromised. So, now I just get pho... but it's not the best pho (and not the cheapest), so I don't go unless there is a group of us or if someone else is craving it. \\n\\nVerdict:\\nWould I go back? Yup... but I wouldn't go out of my way.\\nWould I recommend this? Likely not, I haven't in a couple of years. I can't say with confidence to my friends that it'll taste amazing. \\n\\nWhen I crave their sweet/salty wings, I just go to (their sister restaurant - I haven't confirmed, but hear that the owners are related) Indochine on Broadway."},{"name":"Moonstruck Chocolate","address":"11705 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Very pricey.

Since it wasn't busy, I would have liked a table in the main room, but we were placed in this weird hallway facing the kitchen and adjacent to the bar.  Our server was clueless. We like to ask questions about the menu, we love to be told what the specials are or if anything has been just amazing today (you know, the regular kinds of info you get from a server when they 1) give a crap about what they are doing and 2) have a clue about food or wine or customer service.  She gave a blank stare when we asked if there were specials.  She was annoyed that we wanted to spend time looking at the menu.  She didn't ask us if we had ever been there before, nor did she highlight the menu for us.  My BF asked her to help him understand the real differences between a couple of sauces: she read him the menu description verbatim.  We ordered an appetizer, it was pretty good but was crying out for a bit of good bread to gather the delicious tomatoes and olive oil that came with the buffalo mozzarella.  When the manager asked us if she could take the plate and inquired about how it was, we said: \\"oh, it was great and we would have loved if it came with a bit of bread because the base of the dish is amazing\\". Her response: Others do not feel it should come with bread.  And she walked away.  Um...YOU are a manager here?  This explains a lot. \\n\\nI ordered pasta with what read like it would be delicious veggie based sauce. ( Eggplant, zucchini etc).  I received the pasta covered in a cream sauce with hunks of sausage.  When I asked the waitress, she seemed dumbfounded.

I get the impression, after several visits and trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, that the restaurant's team drinks too much of their own kool-aid. \\n\\nPrimary issues as I see them:\\n+There isn't enough talent to consistently create & deliver quality dishes on the rapidly rotating menu.  Restaurant should take their time and develop long lasting favorites rather than solve for novelty.\\n+Noisy.  Like being inside of an aluminum can noisy.  Put up some acoustic paneling please.\\n+The rotating cart concept is cute; but drives awkward interactions with staff.  I'm a fan of innovation where it drives better experiences.  Here it does not.\\n+Service falls through the cracks frequently given the rotating cart approach to doling out dishes. Server dressed in a gaucho costume came with a cold plate of $80 meat after several other tables passed on the meat, giving it time to cool well past prime temperature. \\n\\n\\nOn a positive note, the Banana Pudding is flawless.  There are certainly some great dishes that pop on to the menu, however their appearance is unpredictable and inconsistent.  Low signal to noise ratio here.  There are other places in Atlanta that have menus with dishes consistently at the level of Gunshow's best dishes, that fortunately don't have as much hype, and therefore are a bit easier to get a reservation ;)"},{"name":"Max And Dylan's North","address":"15 Middlesex Tpke","city":"Bedford","stars":"3","text":"Difficult to recommend.

Sometimes, our food will have been done for a good 10 minutes and they will not tell us it is done.

The chicken was fine, but rather plain - just a simple chicken breast smothered in a mushroom/wine sauce with the addition of a few sliced, canned mushrooms for good measure.

I decided to try my luck after my attempt online and the woman who answers said she didn't \\"think\\" they had any reservations. I was a little turned off because what was she a mind reader, how do you just say I don't think we have reservations for a night 3 weeks into the future. Anyway, I was in luck and we booked a reservation for a party of 4 at 8:30 on a Saturday.\\n\\nThree of our 4 arrived on time for our reservation but of course we had to wait for the latecomer which is customary. When she finally arrived they sat us closest to the door at the end of a communal table already occupied by two couples. It was chilly outside and by the door so it didn't make for the most pleasant experience at first. Once we got some of their unique cocktails into or system we warmed right up.\\n\\nThe dim sum-esque concept is very interesting. It was cool to have each of the chefs stop by with their nightly creations. We ordered practically everything on the menu except for maybe 2 dishes. I will say the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), Short Rib fondue, and the beets were my faves.\\n\\nIf you have food allergies make sure to let them know because they don't list everything on their changing menu. Who would have guessed the Korean fried chicken would have peanuts on it? Luckily they were accommodating and that chef was able to make another plate sans nuts.  \\n\\nSomehow we ended up being the last people there. I found it strange that they were closed up and ready to go by 10pm on a Saturday. For the money we paid, they could have waited until we got up to put the chairs on the table.

Overall, it was a very good experience.\\n\\n- Food - we got the grilled French bread with roasted garlic, Caesar salad, and steak. If I had known that they would be bringing out complimentary bread right after we ordered, I probably wouldn't have opted for the grilled French bread appetizer, but they were so good that I ate all of it anyway. If you've watched the episode of Kitchen Nightmares, you'll be pleased to know that the Caesar salad is no longer the disastrous spicy grilled butt of lettuce that Ramsay described as \\"fusion confusion\\", but is instead a very standard, tasty salad of crisp romaine and plenty of parmesan - just as I like it. The steaks were very good - maybe not the best that I've ever had, but perfectly medium rare, rather aggressively seasoned (bonus points for you if you recognize that reference from MasterChef!)\\n\\nThe service was very good. Rich (one of the owners) greeted us as soon as we came in (it was a little weird - he doesn't know who we are, but we know all about him now...) and our server was very attentive, service was very fast. I felt very well looked after. The restaurant itself is cozy; it only has about 12-15 tables in the main room, but it wasn't too loud at all. We left at maybe around 10:30 and the place was still decently filled. I'm happy to see a Kitchen Nightmares restaurant that didn't flop over as soon as Ramsay stepped out the door!\\n\\nThe one downside about this place: PARKING. Oy vey. I read all the yelp reviews and expected it to be bad; Inman Park is always bad for parking on a Friday night, but it still took us a good thirty minutes of circling around before we could find a street parking spot, and I was standing on the side of the road shivering and instructing Boyfriend to move forward two inches, back up one, repeat... on our long walk over to the restaurant we saw another girl in her nice dress and clutching her purse also guiding her boyfriend into their similarly squeezed parking spot. The restaurant has its own parking lot, technically, but I can only see it fitting about 12 cars at max - and I say at max because it doesn't have any lines painted to indicate specific slots. Therefore, people park wherever they please, and it's not an efficient system at all."},{"name":"Davio's Chestnut Hill","address":"55 Boylston St","city":"Chestnut Hill","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent service and atmosphere.

The Costco prepackaged salad I bought the other day was way better. There was barely any dressing; just a bunch if pepper and salt or some sort of seasoning.

If you open a bottle late, you will waste most of your bottle with closing time fast approaching.\\n\\nExpectation: Bottle service is somehow more convenient\\nReality:  No one at our table of 6 had what we wanted. With our differing likes of Scotch vs Makers vs Titos vs Ketel One, we compromised on a bottle of Grey Goose. We were stuck with this choice for the next 25 drinks. The carafe mixers get watered down.\\nReality: Regular table service waitresses are funner, you can order drinks of different liquor types, and have it made it for you and be served.  You pay per drink as you go.  Real waitresses act nice because they are working for tips unlike bottle service. \\n\\nExpectation: Bottle service is funner\\nReality: It is fun in a cook your own food restaurant kind of way. I think ordering different shots is funner than being stuck with one liquor. We usually do different types with each round to liven things up. Since our bottle had 20+ shots of liquor already, it doesn't make sense to buy even more. We were trying to finish our bottle before closing to get our  money's worth.\\n\\nExpectation: Bottle service is elegant or classy\\nReality: You aren't served, not very classy. People get sloppy after serving themselves \\"triples\\" from the bottle.  Please somehow weed out the douches getting wasted. Nothing frat or wasted is classy.  Outside going home this wasted chick (seen inside earlier) was behind her Ford Excursion sitting at 4th & Colorado talking on her cell phone. She thought she was pulled over out of the way, but her SUV was blocking a whole lane of traffic while she yapped on the phone. At least she wasn't driving over someone.\\n\\nExpectation: Hot Pangaea Dancers\\nReality: If you want to pay to see women dance, just go to the Yellow Rose. It's kind of sad/weird to old men stare at a semi-clothed Pangaea dancer. Plus drinks are cheaper at strip clubs (never thought that was possible)\\n\\nExpectation: Party\\nReality: Yes. But there's a vibe that it's amatuer night.  Lame people need to spend and pay for a party because they can't party on their own. Not saying everyone was like that, but a lot did give off that vibe.\\n\\n\\nPangaea Austin is not their first rodeo, they have opened a well designed club. Even the outside door looks cool. It has good sound. But that's about it. \\nA lot of other people have been \\"sold the dream\\" of Pangaea. But take off your star struck glasses and you will see much ado about nothing. It's not a good value, it's not good service, bottle service is an inconvenient concept, and I'm scared of liquor wasted amatuers."},{"name":"Phnom Penh","address":"244 E Georgia Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The five stars is just for the food alone (actually maybe just for the chicken wings)!

They have a vast selection (~40) w/ interesting flavorings and toppings you've likely not encountered at other sushi places.

Friends had a scorpion bowl for two which is equal to three single scorpion bowls, and they thoroughly enjoyed it. I started with hot&sour soup which was tasted more sweet (?), but I finished it because it was good for my cold. For appetizers we had raviolis which were very small, and crab rangoon. I didn't partake in those but others made note of the ample amount of crab meat. For main dishes we had chicken fingers which were meaty, chicken with cashews, Golden Temple fried rice, and Cantonese fried noodles. Everything was cooked fine, but it all tasted very bland. GT does seem to tout it is healthy, therefore maybe the lack of msg makes it so bland? idk. The service was very good, our water glasses never empty, etc.\\n\\nWhat I really enjoyed was some of the characters that were dining there. One table across from us had seven burly guys. Most of them looked like bodybuilders, and one wore a shirt saying \\"Jesus loves me\\".

Why? It's under the radar, the menu sounds great, and it's really close to home. Sigh. It's a nice bar and a step up from the Standard (especially the beer list) but in terms of food, doesn't hold a candle to the other more popular gastropubs of Atlanta.\\n\\nWrigley Dog - Definitely the best item we had. They even had it down to the celery salt. It's not quite authentic, but it's tasty nonetheless. Two steps to make it authentic - steam the poppy seed bun and use Vienna Beef. At $3 a pop, they're a steal.\\n\\nShort Rib Grilled Cheese - Sounds amazing, right? Imagine braised short rib, beneath a layer of melted cheese, sandwiched between two thick slices Texas toast. Would that not be amazing? They had to fancify and destroy a promising update to a classic. The thing came out on a baguette with arugula and tomato! The short rib was flavorless, the cheese was minimal and while the bread was fresh, it didn't belong with this combination.\\n\\nDuck fat fries - Highly disappointing. I just don't get it. What restaurant makes the effort of getting duck fat for fries, and then doesn't hand cut the fries. Could you taste the duck fat twang? Yes. Could you sense that these fries were beyond ordinary and frozen aside from that? Hell yes. Hand cut fries cooked in peanut oil taste better than frozen ones in duck fat. Please upgrade to hand cut - it will make all the difference!\\n\\nI'm kind of tired of seeing Benton's bacon on every menu in the city. Yes it's good, but so is Oscar Mayer bacon. Focus on getting the basics first. I realize a dish is only as good as the sum of its products, but to me, fresh fries are more important than farm-raised bacon. People are going to like that pig no matter what.\\n\\nSo aside from the food, Young Augustine's should make a great neighborhood speakeasy, with passable snacks. The menu is surely inspired, but the execution is not up to snuff. I just think a little more thought needs to be put into the ingredients and flavors when a menu has such unique and delicious sounding items. Sometimes it's OK to only slightly change a classic, not give it a complete and unwarranted overhaul."},{"name":"Gunshow","address":"924 Garrett St, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"We have followed Kevin Gillespie since Woodfire Grill, which was one of our favorite restaurants when he was there. Now at Gunshow, we had to check it out. \\n\\nAs you can tell from the other reviews, getting a reservation is not difficult, just a long way out. Our reservations were a month in advance, but we got a good time on a Saturday evening, so we were pleased. \\n\\nUpon entering, the first thing I noticed was how open the space is. It is like a huge eat-in kitchen. And loud. This is not the restaurant to come to for intimacy. It is communal and loud! We were seated right at the kitchen which can be a curse for some, but for us it was quite enjoyable to be able to watch the chefs do their thing.\\n\\nI had read up on the restaurant prior to going and from everything that I had read, there was no corkage fee. So I carried in two nice bottles of wine; one red and one white. Their policy had changed! There was a corkage fee of $30 per bottle. I paid the fee for one bottle, but half for the second because I bought one of their reds. Not cheap at all.\\n\\nNothing about this place is cheap. This dining experience is for once in a while. The dining experience is a unique one and we enjoyed every aspect of it. From the chefs peddling their creations, to the cocktail lady pushing her specialty cocktail cart. \\n\\nWe dined on almost every offering they had that evening and even had one dish twice. I think we only declined one. Everything was delicious including the (now) famous banana pudding!\\n\\nI highly recommend that you save up your pennies in the amount of time it will take for you to get a reservation and experience Gunshow."},{"name":"Marrakesh Restaurant","address":"1201 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We were enjoying a visit to Portland with friends from out of town when someone suggested we try something different for dinner. Marrakesh isn't simply dinner, it's an experience. It was somewhat difficult getting a reservation as the doors don't open until a specific time in the evening and they will not answer the phones before that time. However, with a little faith and good luck were were able to find seating by showing up at opening time. The interior transports you to somewhere exotic. (just don't take a seat near the front door, as your exotic Moroccan fantasy will be blown away by gusts of wet Portland wind as arriving patrons continuously hold the front door open trying to get inside.) Seating is somewhat cramped and not very accessible for the elderly or those with back problems as you have two options, a short bench seat, or sitting/kneeling on the floor on a leather cushion. Honestly it all adds to the ambiance inside. You may be able to call ahead for special seating arrangements. After settling in we all ordered a feast meal that was served family style and charged per-person. There was a young woman who came to our table with a towels and a silver bowl to catch rose-scented water being poured over your fingers to wash them. The meal consisted of course after course of delicious Moroccan fare such as apricot chicken, roasted goat with prunes, roasted vegetables with couscous and some sort of delicious pie made of phyllo, honey, nuts and more chicken. Our table overflowed with dishes and sighs of delight. I suggest being the kind of person who doesn't mind fingers in your food, as the meal is served without cutlery and everyone's fingers were in all of the dishes. It just added to the experience for us. The towel you are given is generous enough to rescue your lap from any spills and is handy for wiping sticky hands on.  Bread is also passed in huge baskets to help you sop up their delicious sauces without the aid of a spoon. Honestly, adventurous eaters will have a fantastic time. People who prefer a more formal and familiar dining experience should stick to any number of the fabulous traditional restaurants in Portland.

Everything was fantastic, but as others have said, this is not a place to go if you're super hungry and looking to leave full.  Their portions are what knock it down a star for me.  I mean it is about the experience, but when your chefs for the most part are uninvolved in the actual cooking process, it seems like you could be a little more generous with the portions.

Another ordered 1 waffle with side of egg and sausage links. The food took waaaaaay longer than it should have (appx. 35min, but honestly, should it even take that long for sandwiches & a waffle?). Both of our sandwich meals were served before the waffle meal (which was ordered first btw.). Not to mention, when our server finally brought the waffle \\"meal\\", she informed us that the cook had forgotten the rest of it and was currently in the process of cooking it. At this point more people had come in, all from citywalk & st patties day shenanigans as we had. But still, the order was placed before the crowd arrived.

I cite Morrissey and cows batting their pretty pretty eyelashes as my driving forces.\\n\\nSo imagine my surprise when I walked into Yen Ha and proceeded to not only eat the beef, but eat the beef raw.

And the thing is? I still can't muster the appetite for hamburger, but raw beef looks a lot like tuna sushi, and it doesn't really taste like anything.

The guacamole will definitely keep me coming back. As far as the tacos go, they aren't the cheapest but I don't think that's the point of Black Rooster. The concept is not for them to be a hole in the wall Mexican place, nor is it entirely traditional Mexican and I feel like that justifies the price. If you want cheap Mexican style food then there are plenty of other places in Orlando to go to, but if you want creative, fresh tacos or to have several nutritious items to choose from then Black Rooster is the place for you and the portion of protein in each taco is just enough and definitely not cheap. \\n\\nI've been to other places that have cheaper tacos but they also contain less meat in them, so needless to say I was extremely satisfied with my visit to Black Rooster and I can't wait to come back to try their other menu items."},{"name":"Ronin Sushi","address":"6100 Parkcenter Cir","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"Great small sushi place with other non-sushi items.

The lobster mac and cheese was basically a cup filled with heavy cream and noodles, no cheese in sight, and the tempura prawns ($18), were clearly  frozen already battered and then thrown into the deep fryer and were soggy, bitter and their sad taste will haunt me on my upcoming trip. \\n\\nBottom line, you're better off eating in the food court."},{"name":"Flying Biscuit Caf√© - Midtown","address":"1001 Piedmont Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I don't usually wait to eat at a restaurant, but the reviews I read for Flying Biscuit convinced me this place is worth the wait and I can confirm it is.

Most meals come with a homemade biscuit and homemade jam - so yummy!  I came here for brunch and I think I had a tofu scramble type dish.

Unless you happen to luck out and get one of the newbie servers. In most cases you probably won't.\\nSo we went there with a large group, probably around 15 people. We made the deposit as required and everything was set up.\\nWhen we got there it probably took like 40 minutes until the server actually comes over and talks to us. We figured since they gave us so much time it was to decide on what we wanted to eat. No. The server came over and pretty much told us we HAD to order the Royal Feast - meaning everyone is going to get a 5 course dinner and everyone shares the same 4-5 entrees that the cooks DECIDE for us. \\nYou're probably thinking the same thing we were, \\"So, we're going to pay 20 per person not including the gratuity and we don't even get to pick what we eat?\\" Uhm. Great... So she continued to ask if there were any food restrictions. Well with 15 people what do you expect? Do you honestly think 15 people will have the same food preference? Yeah, no. So we had people say they only eat chicken. Then others saying no lamb. Then of course me and I told her please give me lamb. Well what we got was 3 chicken dishes (that all tasted the same), 2 lamb dishes and one really really dry beef dish. \\nNothing tasted good. I don't even think anyone even liked any one particular dish. So we all left unsatisified. But what do you expect - we couldn't pick anything we wanted.\\nWell I came back exactly a week later to give it another try with just 2 people and it came out way better. I actually liked the food we got... maybe because we got to pick and choose ours. Imagine that.\\nWhat really pissed me off was that the second time we went, there was also a REALLY large group - and they were able to order individually. Not fair at all. They had a newbie server that said it was his second day. He told them he would check in the back to see if it was okay. Our server (some white chick in the downstairs area) told us no repeatedly when we asked and never even bother to check in the kitchen if it was okay.\\nSo before making reservations for a large group - remember to ask which server you're going to get and if you're going to be FORCED to order the Royal Feast. My advice is don't get the Royal Feast with a large group - There's way too many people with different tastes and preferences and you don't even get to pick.. At least Maggiano's Family Style dinner we're able to pick everything so at least you can put it up for a vote."},{"name":"Zoes Kitchen","address":"2333-A Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"My favorite quick Mediterranean spot in ATL.

I say forget the crowds and parking and just go the next day...it's still romantic, right? \\n\\nI've never had Brazilian food before, but when my wife explained to me what Fogo was all about, it was basically a buffet where meat was basically the star of the show. It's not your typical buffet place. Sure if you want greens to eat, you'll need it later, you have to go to the salad bar to get some of it, but all the meats are carried out by the servers who stalk each table looking for to see if the card is red or green.\\n\\nOur table, we reserved, was right next to the kitchen...well close to it. \\n\\nHello sir...would you like some top sirloin?\\n\\nSure!\\n\\nOk grab your tongs and hold on to the meat as I slice it down.\\n\\nOk...\\n\\nJust before I bit into my top sirloin another waiter came by...but with ribs.\\n\\nSir...would you like ribs.\\n\\nUh...yeah sure...\\n\\nSo by the time I started to eat I already had like 4-5 different types of meats on my little plate. I was already confused what meat was meat...well sort of. \\n\\nFogo does a good job with the read meats, lamb and pork. I thought Fogo didn't do well with the chicken. The white meat chicken that is wrapped in pork was dry. It wasn't worth getting as the dryness of the meat really made it not worth eating it at all. It's just really tough to slow cook white meat chicken as it dries so quickly.\\n\\nHowever the rest of the chicken, the dark chicken meat was really good. I almost wished they had more of that, but by the time I eaten all the meats my stomach really needed to take a break...and then some. \\n\\nWife ordered a drink, it cost like $13.50...she felt like it was lacking in the liquor department.

None of that fake stuff that other places use. As other reviewer's have said there is often a long line when you go into the store but it moves extraordinarily quickly. I also recommend going in to buy bagels that are at a discounted price from the day before. The freshness is absolutely there at a great price.

Yup, 30 minutes.\\n\\nIf you add up the extra time we waited to get seated plus the delay in getting our dessert souffles, we were physically at the restaurant for almost three hours.  I like to linger over meals, but I spent about half that time being annoyed at the staff.\\n\\nA quick recap about the delicious food I had because it was really good:\\n1. Trio of pates - Great app to share. Comes with mustard and teeny tiny pickles.  We all loved it and were afraid we'd fill up on bread and pate.\\n\\n2. Rack of lamb - Cooked perfectly.  It was so tender, and I ate everything on my plate down to the last potato.\\n\\n3. Souffle - Creamy and light. After the two previous courses, I was glad to split one souffle with my husband to have a small taste.\\n\\nI'd like to go to Petit Robert again for the food, but I'm not sure if I can stomach the service again."},{"name":"Las Margaritas Latin Resturant Tequila & Rum Sports Bar","address":"1842 Chesire Bridge Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I recently moved to the area and had been searching for a good mexican restaurant.

Overall, I wasn't disappointed by the pizza (half prosciutto and fig and half portabello). The p&f pizza I definitely liked--the sweetness from the figs definitely complimented the saltiness from the cured meat well.  The only problem besides that the prosciutto is tough so you probably end up eating the whole slice of it in a bite, is that after the first slice it becomes a little too sweet or a little too salty.  The portabello pizza was what you would expect of it.  \\n\\nThe main issue was that I felt it was definitely an understaffed restaurant for a busy Friday night.  I called to make reservations for 9:30pm (arrived at 9:00), and the overworked hostess let me know that there's a table leaving and if I stick around I should be seated right away.  After about 10 minutes I assumed that perhaps an earlier reservation had arrived.  All the while the hostess was too overworked to notify me because she had to run around and bring orders to tables/bus the tables/take names. We were finally seated at 10:00. The hostess was definitely the star of the night--she was still so apologetic and accommodating to us even after running around for probably hours on end. \\n\\nDefinitely a good place to go if you're looking for a good pizza. Not a good place if you don't like loud places or long waits."},{"name":"Victoria's Station & Vic's Boathouse","address":"86 Wharf St","city":"Salem","stars":"3","text":"In Salem for Halloween .

It does have a hint of elitism in the air, so as long as you dress nice, know how to order, wine selections, and not asking weird questions, service should be fine.  Yes, servers will pay more attention to well dressed, mannered customers, which orders bigger tickets, bigger tips.  That's just human nature, its worse in the east coast (they will literally say, \\"are you sure you are going to order that wine with your meal?\\").\\n\\nBack to the Urban Farmer, foigras is always pretty damn good, the oysters always change which is cool, and the soups can be a hit or miss.  In Japan, they say a restaurant can be judged just by the soup, since anyone can make a good meal with fantastic ingredients.  So this restaurant does rely on good ingredients, and not so much skill.  Its not a bad thing, you will be paying a lot more if both is combined.  A LOT more.\\n\\nThe steak is good, I've always had mine cooked how I wanted it.  Well, it is a steak house after all, if they fail here, there's no hope.  And they probably know that.  The different meats they have is interesting as well, grain fed, corn fed, grass fed, aged, not aged, wagyu, etc. \\n\\nThey use to bring different steak knives for you to choose from, and I thought that was cool but lately I've not seen this service.   \\n\\nIt is a great dining experience, I recommend it for business, dates and for your loved ones.  If you just want to drop in like you want to just grab a \\"bite\\", then you will complain how expensive it is and probably not prepared for a full meal with wine pairing, thus servers sensing that you're not comfortable, making it even worse dining experience for everyone involved.  \\n\\nAgain, 4 stars since its my fault I've tasted 5 stars in ridiculous places in a ridiculous settings.

Of course, there is a slippery slope.

It's Sunday night, we ordered a couple of calzones and some wings for delivery. We have a Benjamin so we ask the guy on the phone if that's ok, and if the delivery guy will have change. He says he'll let the delivery kid know and hangs up. Ample heads up about the big bill was given. \\n\\nAbout 50 minutes go by so we call back to check on the status. The guy who took the order answers and gruffly says, \\"Yeah, he's going to get change because he didn't listen to me,\\" about why the delivery guy hasn't shown up. \\n\\nFive minutes later, we get a call back from a guy saying he's the owner instructing us to fork over the hundred to the delivery guy who will come back with change. No. This is not ok. We offer to pay with a check, which he won't accept and at this point starts YELLING that he is the owner and that we should just give him the money (over an hour later). After he raises his voice, arguing and saying, \\"What do you want me to do?\\" we canceled the order. \\n\\nAs we are ordering pizza online from Domino's, the poor delivery guys calls saying he'll come back with change, so we let him know that the order has been canceled because of how we were spoken to. \\n\\nThen the owner calls back looking for the delivery boy, and AGAIN yells about how I should totally trust him, then he hangs up on us! What?!?!\\n\\nAfter that interaction turns out as pleasant as the previous, he TEXTS that if I had just asked for it for free, he probably would have given it to us. Probably.\\n\\nTo the owner, since you asked but clearly were not in a space to listen:\\n\\n   1. Don't say your delivery guy can break a hundred when he clearly can't. \\n   2. Don't blame the delivery boy's poor listening skills for the lateness of the order.\\n   3. Don't yell at another human being about the trustworthiness of your word while demanding money.\\n   4.

True asian experience (lol). They are very busy around all meal times. If you go during the 1130am-1pm, or around 5pm-7pm, expect to wait. The turnover is pretty fast, because well... people just wanna eat and leave. Still. \\n\\nService: Surprisingly efficient in light of how busy it usually is. Servers will notice you, don't worry, but don't hold out for lengthy chit chat. \\n\\nFood: What the place lacks in ambiance and service, it makes up for with an abundance of food for pretty cheap, like most \\"dives\\" (c'mon, this place is pretty much an Asian dive). When I say abundance, I mean the portions are pretty big. PP is known for its chicken wings. It is fried to perfection where it is lightly cripsy on the outside and juicy on the inside, served covered with sauteed garlic and a lemon pepper dip that offers the ideal contrast to the richness of the wing. It comes in a smaller size and a bigger size. If you love wings, and you go with more than one stomach, get the larger size. \\n\\nWhat else is good? Their version of beef carpaccio. I think it is called Butter Beef or something on their menu. Thin slices of raw beef, lightly seared on the outside, covered in a tangy sweet sauce and cilantro (don't get it if you hate cilantro), and i'm guessing butter is involved somehow. So, it's gotta be good.\\n\\nAnd? Beef luc lac. It's saucy strips of beef on a bed of rice/vermicelli, a sunny side egg on top, and some veggies. It sounds boring as hell, but I swear, you mix it all together like some crazed toddler, and then you shovel that stuff in your face, and I bet you will finish that plate in less than ten minutes. It really hits the spot. When you are really hungry and just want to be satisfied in all possible ways with minimal effort, get this dish. Their mixed noodles are good too, and the lemon grass meats are also pretty standard. \\n\\nBy the way, sometimes when you order a rice/vermicelli meal, they offer you this weird clear broth with sometimes a bone sitting in it. Don't be scared --it's just bone broth. It's good for you, and it's free.

Get your act together Greenbriar.

It has a lot of vegetation, and there are tables outside where you can sit down. I didn't like however how dirty the benches where, specially the ones beside the entrance. It is not as clean and fresh as the Blue Dhalia cafe, but it does have more space outside. \\n\\nRECEPTION: Upon my entrance, I wasn't really greeted. There was a tall guy (who the waitresses seem to like a lot) who seems a bit clueless, perhaps because he is new. We asked about the menu, and we where explained how to serve ourselves.\\n\\nKITCHEN: This is the plus for this place. You can see that the food is being made on a table on the back by the cooks. So it gives it a special touch to see your food being prepared. I expect that this is the main reason that some people give some reviewes a bit hyped. \\n\\nFOOD: It is ok, it is not amazing. The taste of the soup was a bit bald and lacking of flavor in my opinion. They chop ingredients and cook them, but lack spices to make it taste other than a vegetable soup. I can make a better vegetable soup myself. I still ate it, I was very hungry, but I would surely have asked for something else if available. I did asked the tall guy at the entrance if there was other options, to which he responded \\"There are no options\\". Again, he might be new and maybe there are. I went with the flow and continued my experience.\\n\\nTEA: The tea is great. They had two types and a description below. They also sell it there for prices that ranged. The once I liked was $11. My girlfriend let me know that it was a bit expensive for what it was worth (she is a tea fanatic). I still bought it and I'm enjoying it at home.\\n\\nENTREE: IT was ok, but I was left hungry. After the salad (average) and soup, you go and ask a cook for the entree. This gives a touch of intimacy of being served by the cook herself, but it is a bit confusing if you are sitting outside, and it is your first time. \\n\\nDESSERT: The desert was good. To tell the truth I can't remember what it was. It was small and it was 4 USD. The 3 course meal (soup, salad, entree) was $25 USD, plus 4 USD for the dessert, and $11 USD for the tea. That is a total of $50 USD for my visit, which I considered average, for a not so average price.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: If you go here, go not so hungry, perhaps during breakfast or lunch. Do not go on a first date: The place is rather dirty outside, and there are no fans to scare the mosquitoes. Expect average food, for a not so average price. If you are looking for different experience, it is worth experience, but not worth repeating. Making a vegetable soup and salad, and taking it to a park might provide the same relaxing experience with a way lower cost."},{"name":"Grill 23 & Bar","address":"161 Berkeley St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My meal started out shakey: I ordered the crab cakes appetizer and they came out quick but cold.

There is only ONE window table that can seat up to four people, so you might need to wait for quite a while if that's the table you want.

I loved how the waitress came around with a huge basket of bread with different choices.  The bacon-mushroom roll and the asiago cheese bread were both extremely tasty.  And the other courses popped my palate to maximum pleasure...there's no other way I can say it.  The lobster-mushroom soup with quail egg was spectacular, as was the chicken cordon bleu.  Cheese was melty inside as soon as I took a bite, seasoning was perfect, and the outside was crispy and evenly fried.  And the dessert choices were just the right amount of sweet to finish the meal...the chocolate ball was exquisitely prepared in great detail, and somehow cleansed perfectly after the rather rich meal.

Do not let the calmness and ordinary looking restaurant fool you. It's true what they say about not judging a book by its cover. \\n\\nWe were hesitant but decided to try it anyways and lets just say we had to fight our belly and convince that it wasn't full...lol! Any case I got the Grelhada Mista (meat & poultry) with my side choices of roasted red bliss potatoes and veggies. My friend got the Feijoda a Pescado (seafood) w/rice and we ordered Portuguese Fries to share. Words couldn't come close to describing how the food tasted but I'll try...AMAZING!

I must also profess my love for cars and close parking, but moving on...I enjoyed the food at Figs.  You cannot make a reservation, but you can call an hour and a half before, sort of like call ahead seating, I guess.  We did that and still waited 30 minutes.  The place is tiny and loud, definately wouldn't call it romantic.  The service was lousy.  I don't even know what else to say about it.  Our waitress was slow and not friendly.  I mean, I don't expect rushed service, but prompt attention is nice.  I had the salmon with orzo which was good.  The orzo was delicious.  I couldn't stop eating it.  The bread and oil was OK, nothing special.  They don't have dessert or a full bar, but they serve beer & wine.  I tried my friend's mac and cheese (really orzo, not macaroni) and that was really good and I don't even like mac and cheese.

We expected it to be busy, so we weren't incredibly surprised to see the line out the door and stretching down the patio. We were, however, amazed at how small the place was. Both in terms of number of seats and the size of the kitchen and staff. It looked like there were two cooks, sous chef doing veggies and prep, and one guy doing dishes along with two managers and a counter person. When we arrived, there were no seats available, but it seemed that the tables were turning over with enough regularity that it really wasn't a problem.\\n\\nAfter waiting in line for about 15 minutes, we finally reached the counter only to be told that the kitchen had just stopped taking orders in an effort to try to catch up. I'm not entirely sure I understand the logic behind this. You can take an order without firing it immediately. Instead, we were told we would have to wait another 15-20 minutes, and that we should continue just standing at the counter until they were taking orders again.\\n\\nAfter another 20 minutes, we finally ordered our grouper cheeks and a key west style grouper sandwich.\\n\\nAfter another 20 minutes, our food finally arrived. My grouper cheeks were fantastic, as were the vegetables and couscous. My wife's sandwich, however, was dry. It was fried, but not oily - just dry. I asked if she wanted to get some mayo or something to give it a bit of moisture, but there was already some on it. She found the fries too salty and had to wipe hers off, but I loved them just as they were (I tend to be a salt fiend when it comes to fries).\\n\\nThe prices ranged from reasonable to slightly overpriced. The staff was friendly, but once you had your food, you weren't going to be attended to unless you could flag someone down as they passed by serving someone else.

As a spicy fan it was delicious, flavor packed, but not for the faint of heart.  I'd get it again without a second though.  The agnolotti and the lobster roll were boring, though well executed.  The carrot/coconut risotto was a looser risotto and just too pedestrian.  The wild boar and particularly the foie gras were OUT OF THIS WORLD.

I received an entire new plate complete with more sides (even though I had finished my other ones) and she apologized profusely.

I really enjoyed the chicken burritos, it had a lovely creamy texture to its filling that I appreciated.  I can't say it's better than Anna's Taqueria yet, I'll have to try it a few more times.  The nachos had an interesting, smoky flavor, I think from the crema they topped it with, and were pretty good.  We were left with a massive pile of shredded beef once we were done, which, I suppose, could be great if you're really into red meat.  My friend ordered the fried fish tacos with cilantro crema and they were DELICIOUS.  I wish I'd ordered those.  The horchata was a little loose and a little too cinnamon-y, which is saying a lot, because I love cinnamon.  I love the decor in La Catrina, every table painted a vibrant color, little skeleton-ized portraits of celebrities on the napkin dispensers and large La Catrina murals on the walls..  Love it.

And since I have always trusted her judgement in good food, I made it a goal to stop by at least once during my trip.  \\n\\nWe decided on a date and then set to find this little hole in the wall restaurant in Vancouver's chinatown and damn was it packed.  Our reservation was for 1 pm and we were late about 15 minutes and were told that we were lucky we came in because they were just about to give up our table.  \\n\\nAt most Asian restaurants, you don't really expect good service, but the hostess here was incredible patient and professional.  I could not commend her more for her ability to manage the crowds of people waiting at the door for a seat.  She was organized, courteous, efficient, and probably the best hostess I have ever encountered at any restaurant.  Other than her, the rest of the waiters were nice and helpful as well and the food was brought out quickly.  The only exception was my vietnamese iced coffee, which came out near the end of the meal (well after everyone else's drinks) and which also wasn't as good as I've had at other average places. \\n\\nBut on to the food.  We had a pretty large party so we got to try many dishes.  Of course, we ordered the yelp favorites: the butter beef, fried chicken wings, and beef luc lac.  But on top of that we also got the spicy garlic spareribs, a combo rice plate, a pho, and a combo vermicelli plate.  As a whole, the entire table was very happy with all the dishes, but my personal favorites were the spareribs and wings which were packed with garlic-y fried goodness.  The butter beef is a rare beef with a powerful citrus/cilantro type of sauce on top.  Though it has been mentioned a lot on yelp, I don't think I'm much of a raw beef fan so it wasn't really my cup of tea, but its definitely a very unique dish.\\n\\nIf I ever come back to Vancouver, I will definitely want to come here again.

The scallops were cooked perfectly and were seasoned and paired perfectly lightly with garnish. The Cornish game hen was a treat for the most part although these birds can tend to get a little dry. They did a phenomenal job maintaining flavours despite some bites not being as tender as they could have been. \\n\\nI also ordered dessert which is something I do maybe twice a year.

We were staying at the Ritz, Boston Commons and I made a last minute 930 reservation via yelp/open table. It was walking distance from the hotel, an unseasonably warm evening and Mooo was a restaurant I wanted to try since reading about their Best Steakhouse award in this year's \\"Best of...\\" issue of Boston Magazine. I was in the mood for a gluttonous feast and was not disappointed.\\n\\nLocated a half block from the State House on Beacon St, we almost missed the entrance located on the side of the XV Beacon Hotel. My initial assessment of the space was very positive. I liked the space and loved the mood. It was romantically dark, cozy and not overly loud. We arrived a bit after 9 but were seated immediately. Our table, a double, was at the rear of the dining room and the massive high-back chairs added to the feeling of complete privacy. \\n\\nOur server Hugo (hope I remembered his name correctly), was pleasant, attentive and professional. Our appetizer, the delectable Wagyu dumplings were better than I expected (and they came highly recommended). The order of five perfectly tender dumplings were steamed in their wrapper and drizzled with an every so slightly spicy sauce which was flavorful and tangy, not hot.\\n\\nAs has been previously mentioned, the dinner rolls were freshly baked balls of doughy, stretchy goodness, served in a sizzling, cast iron dish lightly buttered and salted with large, course salt rocks. They were delicious with whipped butter and even better dipped into the dumpling's sauce.\\n\\nTime between courses was exactly what I'd expect. It was as if our server could read my mind. Just as our conversation started to wane and I regarded my watch for the first time, our entrees arrived. \\n\\nI enjoyed the boneless Rib Eye which was perfectly pink in the middle and seared crisp. My wife ordered the salmon served on a bed of butternut squash, brussel sprouts and lobster. Not normally a big fan of brussel sprouts, they were scrumptious and the fish was prepared a mouth-wateringly medium. We also ordered a side of potato skins to accompany my rib eye. These were far from TGI Fridays skins and the order consisted of three massively stuffed, baked with cheese potatoes. My only complaint was that since we were in a hotel, I couldn't take my leftovers home.\\n\\nMy steak came with a large beef bone stuffed with garlic and herbed butter for the \\nmeat. I asked to take that home for our dog but Hugo informed us that the bone may not be appropriate for a dog due to its preparation methods. I thanked him for saving us the potential trouble.\\n\\nOur night out was my wife's belated birthday celebration and we couldn't have chosen a better spot for a special occasion dinner. My meal was one of the best steaks I've had and equals or even betters my previous favorites, the Kobe Beef at the Oak Room (Copley Fairmont) and a Rib Eye at Gibson's in Chicago.

Asked for tea/water which didn't arrive till after our first order of sushi 25 minutes later.

Pizza Express sadly falls into the \\"major fail\\" category for me.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I had returned home from a day long family event this past Saturday night and were exhausted.  We decided to just order a couple sangwiches from D'Agostino's and take it easy for the night.  Unfortunately for us, when my boyfriend showed up at D'Agostino's he was told they were out of sub rolls (I don't get it but whatever) so we decided to go home and see what we could get for delivery.\\n\\nWe had gone to Pizza Express shortly after we moved in for pizza and were really disappointed in the greasy mess that we received. That was about 8 months ago and we were ordering subs this time around so we decided to give it a shot.  I ordered a Chicken Salad sandwich with american cheese and my boyfriend ordered a chicken cutlet sandwich.  We were told it would be about half an hour.  Our doorbell rang about 10 minutes later (we live very close) so we were pleasantly surprised with the speed of the service.\\n\\nUnfortunately the pleasantness stopped there.  Even more unfortunately the surprises did not.  When I first opened up my sandwich I honestly asked my boyfriend \\"Did they seriously forget the chicken salad???\\".  I had to look at the sandwich from the side to notice that there was a very very VERY thin layer hiding underneath a piece of cheese.  I lifted up the cheese and found a bright white paste.  Not a single chunk of chicken was to be found.  They must have blended the chicken, mayo and maybe cornstarch for thickness (?) in the blender as there was literally no texture.  It was also so thick that it tore the cheese in half when I was trying to check underneath.  The flavor was horrifying.  I ate less than half and had mouth sweats just thinking about it the rest of the night.\\n\\nMy boyfriend's chicken cutlet sandwich was similar in the fact that there was one tiny thin cutlet hidden underneath about 2 cups of lettuce.  It was overly greasy and flavorless and he also ate only about half the sandwich.\\n\\nI've given this place two shots but will absolutely never go back there again for, well, anything.

My tacos were so big and juicy.  I squeezed the lime all over and then there was this sauce on the tacos where really tied it all together.  It was messy, but there are plenty of napkins on the table.  It will be messy - make a mess - let it run down your hands - lick it off - messy hands don't care.  \\n\\nThe fries were great too, but I did notice that we were missing the cilantro on our fries.

After the third time we just ate them and Kara or Carrie was nice enough to let us know that we would not have to pay for it.. We left after that. \\n\\nHow hard is it to heat up some nachos and cheese people?!  Anyway, my husband pointed out that on the menu it described the nachos as being serviced warm so that's what we expected.

The most memorable dish of that night for me was the beet cured salmon and warm old fashioned banana pudding. That banana pudding is probably the best banana pudding I've had -  hands down!\\n\\nAlso, come in for the experience. This isn't your typical sit down and eat restaurant. It's dim sum inspired, so they come around with a dish in their hand, present what the food is, so you can decide whether or not you want it. I think it's a perk to see what your food looks like before you put in your order, so you know what you're getting. But I think for this place, you'll want it all. Everything looks and smells amazing.\\n\\nDo try to make a reservation when coming to eat, so you can avoid waiting around, since every time I've visited it's always packed. I've always made one and never had to wait too long to be sat.

I'm not sure what was going on, but there were only 3 orders ahead of me, and it took 10 minutes of waiting in line for me to place my simple iced coffee order. \\n\\n2. I brought my own cup, and it was placed somewhere *not* in the \\"drinks to be made line\\". I noticed orders placed AFTER mine, coming out BEFORE mine, so I went up to the Barista and politely let her know my \\"own cup\\" order was placed on the ledge by the cash registers. She didn't seem to know it was there and I don't blame her. She quickly poured my iced coffee and apologized. She was cool.\\n\\n3. If you plan to do some studying, go elsewhere. It is loud here even with my noise-cancelling large headphones. \\n\\n4. I went to get a refill and the barista who helped me the 2nd time was in a huge rush for some reason. There was no line, and no one was ordering anything. I asked for soy milk as creamer in my coffee and in his haste, he dumped soy milk all over the counter! \\n\\n5. I sat at a table next to the area where the drinks are made, and somehow, simple syrup ended up all over my laptop. The barista's station was probably a foot above the level of my table and all the supplies and syrups were facing away from my table. I'm guessing someone HASTY was squirting simple syrup into a drink and pushed down too hard, so the syrup sprayed outwards?? Not sure but my computer was sticky (and sweet) until I could get home to wash it. \\n\\nOverall, good location for a nice chat with a friend, but not for students or bibliophiles coming out of barnes and noble."},{"name":"Dalo's Kitchen","address":"1533 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"What is there to say about Dalo's?  Situated in the OAMI building on N Williams, it's relatively unassuming exterior would never have you thinking that it's delicious, but it's SO good!  When I bike by, I can smell all the Ethiopian spices, beckoning me to come in and sit down.   Inside it is relatively simple decor, as I think it used to be more of a cafeteria space for the OAMI building.  Their bathrooms are also shared with the OAMI space, which is a little inconvenient, but still so worth it for the food!  They do an all-you-can buffet, but I usually opt for the vegan platter as the buffet seems to be more of a meat-eater's paradise.  The vegan platter is more than enough food for 2.  They give you a huge thing of injera and lots of dipping sauces, like lentils and potatoes, as well as spinachy dip... SO GOOD.  I also like to get the veggie sambusas as an apetizers, fried delicious goodness!  If you order food rather than do the buffet, just be aware that it takes a little bit longer than your average restaurant to prepare food."},{"name":"Pei Wei","address":"355 E Altamonte Dr, Ste 100","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"3","text":"For a while now, Pei Wei has been my go-to restaurant to get Pad Thai.

As you enter the lush grounds through a series of arbors you instantly feel far from the nearby bustle of Austin. There are great little dining spaces hidden away as well as a playground for the kids. For the food, everyone gets the same meal - a drink, soup, salad, and plate - all vegan and organic. The hibiscus mint tea and salad with Casa dressing were really great. But the soup was watery and bland. The plate had an interesting variety of foods - a veggie, leafy green, grain, beans, and fermented veggie. But none of them really stood out or had much flavor. It's a shame because healthy vegan food can be so flavorful. If this is someone's introduction to vegan food they may never try again. Plus the portions were tiny - I left still hungry. When you're serving ingredients as inexpensive as rice and beans why not increase your portion size above a small dollop of each? The menu changes daily, so I'll give it another shot at night when the grounds are all lit up and I'm sure lovely.

It's all of these things, no less, no more. It reminds me of a time many years ago me and a buddy were drinking some beers watching the lingerie show at The Derby (I know, I know) and he says, the carpets in here are nasty....and I said \\"Yeah\\", he says, it stinks in here, ...and I said \\"Yeah\\", he says Don't ya love it, and I said \\"Heck Yeah\\".

They start out by bringing around the bar cart to your table and serving up whatever you choose. The cocktails were very good and unique. You get to see a menu which lists out each of the chef's creations as well as the prices per dish, which is a good way to plan out which things you want ahead of time. If you're in a large group as I was, I'd recommend ordering at least one of most if not everything on the menu just so that you can try more things. If you are with a smaller group or go for a date night, this will not be the most economical option and you will want to figure out which dishes you want to try before the chefs start coming around and putting food on your table. While I haven't gone for a date night yet, I suspect it's a little awkward to have to turn down the chefs whose dishes you don't want. In our large group, I think there was one dish we were reluctant to order near the end of our sequence, simply because we were all stuffed, and the chef walked away huffing before we could give a definitive answer (reason why I docked a star). So if you're sensitive to that type of thing, you might not like the vibe. That being said, the food was absolutely incredible and I'd absolutely go again with a large group so I could taste everything on the menu again.

The food is always amazing but the incredibly long waits are deterring at times. Ive called in an order an hour early and still had to wait 30-45mins extra. However that's not entirely the fault of the kitchen they physically can only make so much food per hour with their limited space on the flattop. And the food is popular. They also have the best wing special in the area. 12 JUMBO wings for $7. Sauce is great too. The Phillies are always on point and I suggest adding pepperoni and Special sauce to any you get. Lastly the eggplant fries are also very tasty and served with a jalapeno ranch sauce cup. If you plan on ordering on a weekend make sure you plan waaaay ahead. Like be a psychic. If its for dinner start planning after lunch lol. Kidding tho give yourselves AT-LEAST 1 hour lead time and don't bother parking in front of the building during peak hours the traffic makes it difficult to back out.

Similar to Las Tortas Locas, for example, this is a counter-serve Mexican spot with a self-serve condiment bar. The bar included limes, red salsa, green salsa, guacamole and pickled vegetables; Very small selection with barely any salsa left in the bowls (it was around 3PM on a Sunday). I will say, however, that this place is very clean. \\n\\nI ordered 2 carne asada sopes and a mexicana torta to-go ($11.77). The tortas was pretty good. The bread was soft with a slight crunch to it and included avocado, tomato, jalepeno, lettuce, onion, breaded beef, ham, queso, & mayonnaise. The sopes were bigger than I thought they would be; About the size of my palm! Although they were very generous with the toppings, I wasn't a fan of the base itself. It was very thick and slightly dry w/ a very doughy texture to it. Maybe it's just not my thing. \\n\\nOverall a decent spot for a quick fix if you're craving Mexican and are on this side of town."},{"name":"Argan Bistro","address":"795 Jervis Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"I signed up for Yelp just to write this review. \\n\\nOne day I walked in planning to order a quick take out. As the chef personally went through the menu with me I realized that this is an experienced that must be savoured. And I am so happy that I stayed. The calamari salad was out of this world. The presentation and flavours were so surprising, but familiar and comforting at the same time. I couldn't stop smiling for the rest of the day, so grateful for having this culinary experience. I found the use of sweet pea shoots especially inspired! They add such a lovely whimsical visual, textual and flavourful twist. \\n\\nI've since been back three times more. Once for lunch with soba noodles (ah... smoked mussels.. hello! they were an amazing discovery) and lavender panna cotta with chai spiced nuts, which was divine! \\n\\nThe next two times I brought people with me. It was too selfish to keep this place to myself only. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu by now. Dishes are truly an exploration into flavours, textures, colours. It is food that's truly crafted, made with love, thought and care. \\n\\nThe wine list is also very carefully curated, and the server was able to recommend a nice Pinot to go with our dinner.\\n\\nFor me the best way to describe this food is through emotions that it elicits. The chef talks to you through the dishes. Sometimes it's a nostalgic comforting reminiscence of the old world (pork belly and kimchi rolls or the meat lover's hash), sometimes it's something cheeky and funny (the calamari), or something romantic and timeless (the match creme br√ªl√©e). But all of it also has an element of surprise and discovery. \\n\\nI can't wait for the fall menu and for many more wonderful experiences.

Once we were all seated, we decided to order 4 mi-MOOO-sas. Major brownie points for such a clever name. The waiter asked if we would like complimentary cinnamon buns. Didn't have to ask us twice!

Loved it. May have eaten 2... \\n\\nWhen it came time to order, I decided, rather easily considering the limited options, on the spinach and egg white omelette. The egg dishes come with potatoes to share (between how many people I'm still not clear...) and your choice of 2 pieces of toast. Having already consumed too many cinnamon buns, I asked if I could sub fruit for potatoes or toast, expecting an additional charge of some sort. The waiter told me that simply wasn't an option. Huh? I can't have fruit at brunch?? He said I could order the fruit cup appetizer... For $8. No thanks! Didn't need fruit that badly. I told him not to bring me the toast, but he did anyway, and I felt guilty to just leave it on the table, but I had hit my carb ceiling. \\n\\nThe omelette was fine! The eggs were cooked nicely and the portion was huge! It's literally filled with just steamed spinach, but it's basically a block of it with a thick egg white shell. You need to be a disciple of Popeye to enjoy that much spinach at once. I'm used to an omelette being a mix of the eggs and fillings, but this kept them completely separate.

He was even honest to let us know which items he hadn't actually sampled for himself. He cautioned us to be careful for the spicy items on the menu. No need for the warning - I had the General Tao's that was noted as spicy; it was not at all spicy. It was tasty - more along the lines of sweet. However the General Tao's was not buried in batter - in fact the coating to meat ratio was very good - I like that. I wish that the fried rice had some meat, vegetables and egg in it.

This is more tapas or dim sum style environment leading to a chaotic, fun, and louder atmosphere.\\n\\nService - Our server checked back in intervals but they are not at your table to serve you food, for the most part, so there will be more downtime unless you flag him/her down.

Decor is nice, minimal and dark in a fancy-pants New-American trendy kind of way.  Our waiter was super awesome and very accommodating for our vegan friend.  \\n\\nBanquets are a little bit different because you only get to choose from 3 dishes for your appetizer, entree, and dessert, but they curated the limited menu well and I was very happy with what I got.  I'd be curious to come back again and try different things.\\n\\nMinus: disliked my beer.  Wish I'd had a little more guidance on that one; I wanted to try something new.  Short beer lists always make me hope that there are no bad choices, but alas not the case here.  Also all the beers were served in tall skinny frosted glasses, which was a strange choice.  I'm not a beer snob and I still thought it odd.\\n\\nA+: brussels sprouts salad with pistachios, apple, creme fraiche, and some magic sauce.  Perfectly savory and I loved the crunch of pistachios and sweetness of apples setting off the well-done sprouts.\\n\\nB+: Three little pigs.  Served on a bed of grits, which were unfortunately sort of coagulated like when you get mac and cheese from the school cafeteria and there's a skin on it, and greens which I couldn't remember, three different cuts of pork (possibly four?).  I'm from socal and love chicaronnes, but these guys weren't crispy enough and were just like big pork pieces of foam.  The rillettes were AWESOME and so flavorful (I'm guessing they were rillettes).  The pork loin was also tasty. \\n\\nA: chocolate cake with mascarpone ice cream, candied beet, and beet-chocolate puree.  Cake was filled with a whipped delicious creaminess as well.  The cake was perfect, not too moist nor too dry and not too sweet.  Like a good 72% chocolate bar vs. the usual hershey's.  The candied beet was a treat, like a sugared fruit roll up, and I also liked the beet-chocolate puree.  Ice cream was also not too sweet and just a dream.\\n\\nI'd definitely come back again and try more.  The brussels sprouts alone were so great.

My favorite thing about Fellini's is that it stays open LATE!!! I'm typically up late, and pizza is my favorite food, so I know I can always run to Fellini's for a slice or 2.

It definitely didn't seem \\"soupy\\" enough to me, but maybe I'm used to larger dumplings. I ordered the luffa & shrimp ones because I'd never seen that option before, but they were a bit weird, the luffa combination makes it even less soupy and changes the texture of the dumpling. The pickled radish was pretty good though, much sweeter than I thought it would be. \\n\\nThe restaurant has very open seating, and the acoustics makes it pretty echo-y in there.

Some curious facts about Australian Outback. But enough about Australia and let me focus on the restaurant. The Outback restaurants I have been to have a rustic feel to them. I would compare their look as similar to a lodge pole pine structure of the American west. Inside the feel continues. The floors, tables, booths, and bar are all dark woods. Scattered about on all walls are reminders that you are in an Australian atmosphere. All the Outbacks I have been in have TVs playing in the bar area that consists of stools and tables and chairs. This is different in other cities and states. I say this because eating at tables near the bar is also an option at many Outbacks'. Smoking or non-smoking, you decide. All the Outback's I have been in have TVs playing in the bar area that consists of stools and tables and chairs. In NY there is no smoking allowed anywhere inside. This is different in other cities and states. We have been to some where smoking is still the norm. I say this because eating at tables near the bar is also an option at many Outbacks'. Smoking or non-smoking, you decide. They are quick to bring it. That is, after you have ordered an appetizer. The workers are trained to immediately ask for your appetizer order. They call them Aussie-tizers. It's hard to go to the Outback and not have one. The most popular on the list is the Bloomin' Onion. This is a trademark item of theirs. You will see these crispy wonders being hustled to most tables. Just reach across and grab a piece. It also comes with a dip. The Aussie Cheese Fries are another favorite along with Kookaburra Wings. No, these are not wings of the Australian bird sung of in the Kookaburra song down under. If you want to watch the waistline and/or pocketbook there are still other options. They serve some great salads. You can even have some shrimp from the Barbie added. They have a soup and salad special too at 7.99. See you can keep it lighter. Just add a side of mashed potatoes, some grilled onion, saut√©ed Mushrooms, and a sweet potato. WHAT ABOUT LITTLE ONES? They have what they call the Joey Menu for $3.99 and $4.99 prices they have a Joey Sirloin, Junior Ribs, Maca A Roo'N Cheese, a burger, and chicken fingers. These dishes come with beverages too.

I've chatted with him numerous times. He's always welcomed me to a beer, cigarettes, etc. He's as hospitable as they come. I'd highly recommend."},{"name":"The Keg Steakhouse + Bar","address":"1011 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Our server wasn't very personable. Ordered my steak rare to medium rare and it came out medium well. When I showed the server he offered to bring me a new one but did not seem to care or acknowledge that it was over cooked. My meal came out finally but everyone was done eating. Not my favourite keg that's for sure"},{"name":"Charlie's Kitchen","address":"10 Eliot St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Probably not going to compete with its neighbor Bartley's for best burgers in Harvard Square, but Charlies is my number one in the Harvard area. Head in, head upstairs, grab a seat at the bar or a booth, get some good beers and enjoy the crowd and the jukebox. Hipsters, locals, punks, and average joes, make this a nice laid back and fun option after hitting one of the local restaurants."},{"name":"Monsieur Paul - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"1510 N Avenue Of The Stars","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Just not very good. Thank goodness had dining plan but it cost double points. Food was bland. Looked pretty but taste was not there. Worst meal we have had at Disney. Service was good though.  Added a star because desert was awesome."},{"name":"4th & Swift","address":"621 N Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Wife and I had a wonderful meal there last night - I'd strongly encourage it to anyone interested in an upscale technique/Southern flavors type meal.  It absolutely holds its own with Miller Union, Watershed, etc., but isn't as well known or as hot, so should be easier to get into.    \\n\\nThe summary - the service was excellent (albeit a little slow), the food was perfectly prepared, and the price was strong but not awful.  Several seasonal options on the menu, from apps and entrees to sides (the fried okra is wonderful at the moment), and we were both very pleased with everything we ate.  Didn't try dessert, but only because we were full."},{"name":"Thai Boo Cuisine","address":"712 Washington St","city":"Norwood","stars":"4","text":"This was the best meal we've had in a while!  \\nTook recommendations from another Yelp review and were not disappointed. Amazing salads, crispy hot basil duck, red seafood curry, fried banana with coconut ice cream! !\\nYUM!\\nLovely restaurant & service!"},{"name":"Aab India","address":"2400 E Main St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I wish I could give this place a higher rating. We have been craving a good Indian restaurant on the east side of the city for a long time and when Aab opened we thought it may be peg to fill that hole. It's close, but the service really lets it down.\\n\\nThe food is easily a 4. It's really good. Not the best curry I have ever had, but a solid 4. The service unfortunately is only 2. While we sat fairly quickly and the food was served with no issues, my main complaint is sitting for about 20 minutes after clearly finishing and no waiter to present the check. When he finally showed up it was like he was never missing at all. An apology would have been easy! We will probably go back again, and just allow more time in the schedule for waiting."},{"name":"Vino Vino","address":"4119 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I love this place, and I am not a huge wino... the food is what draws me. Plus it is in my neighborhood and sometimes I feel like there aren't enough really nice places to eat in my area. Vino Vino is nice, the atmosphere is very open and lively and most importantly comfortable. The food, while pricey is always perfectly cooked, the wagyu steak is amazing and my favorite thing to order. Overall a nice menu filled with updated french and Mediterranean dishes that appeal to a wide variety. Also a good place for some wine and appetizers rather than a full meal. equal appeal as a date or dinner parties with a group of friends."},{"name":"Charlie's Kitchen","address":"10 Eliot St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Most of the food on Charlie's regular menu is junk food, but it's top-shelf junk food. Their array of fried potato products is stunning, they make a high-value lobster roll, and the draft beer selection is better than average (and, more to the point when it comes to deciding where to have lunch in the Square, better than the draft beer selection at Shay's).\\n\\nTheir beer garden may be the coolest thing that's ever happened to Harvard Square. That's a bold statement, but I'm prepared to defend it because in my lifetime almost all of the changes to the Square have sucked (the Wursthaus, Elsie's, Ta Sheng, the pre-B&N Coop...). I mainly go to Charlie's Beer Garden in the summer while most of the students are away. Harvard does get overrun by tourists in the summer, but it seems like the guidebooks currently instruct them all to go eat at Mr. Bartley's, so I've never had a wait for a table.\\n\\nTry the waffle fries."},{"name":"Charlie's Kitchen","address":"10 Eliot St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"One of my favorite spots in Cambridge for a social meal and drinks. In addition to an abundant list of standard American-fare burgers and grilled cheese, you can swing some awesome seafood deals on local favorites like lobster or oysters (2/$1 12-5pm & after 9pm, $1 each 5-9pm). The lobster sandwich for $13 is a bargain. Their outdoor beer garden is lovely on nice days, and the beer selection is solid.\\n\\nMy main complaint and reason for subtracting a star is the consistently lacking service. It's like pulling teeth to get servers to check in on your table, even infrequently."},{"name":"Ki Sushi","address":"45 Eighth Street","city":"New Westminster","stars":"3.5","text":"Very slow service.

He was incredibly knowledgeable about both the menu and the Boston area in general.  If only they had him cooking the steaks...  I thought that my sides were OK.  I thought that my steak (the Painted Hills New York Sirloin) was below average.  Maybe I should just stick to the corn fed beef.  I thought that this one was a bit gristly.

I went last week with my friend, Gordo.  His review is much funnier than mine so you can just skip ahead to his review.  We started off with the nachos with fajita meat; the fajita meat really tasted great - an amazing flavor.  We  tried to order the nachos without the faijita; however, Gordo apparently thinks that they speak Portuguese in Mexico as he ordered everything in Portuguese & fortunately something got lost in translation.  The waitress was great; she played along with Gordo like he was a little boy.\\n\\nI also had an order of cheese enchiladas which was quite good as well.   Next time, I'm going for the fajita entree though unless Gordo confuses the waitress again.\\n\\nBtw - the frozen margaritas were excellent as well."},{"name":"Zoes Kitchen","address":"2333-A Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I gave this restaurant 2 stars due to a major health code violation that I failed to report to the  Health Department.  The incident occurred last year and I am just now getting an opportunity to post feedback. (I'm behind in a lot of my Yelp! reviews.) I reported it to management, but I don't believe it wasn't taken as serious as it should have been.  Free food is not the answer to everything. As stated by other Yelpers and Google reviews sanitation and customer service is definitely lacking at this location.  I live less than a mile from this location, but drive to the location on Roswell Road for a real Zo√´'s Kitchen experience. It's good to see that someone from Zo√´'s is now starting to consistently read customer reviews."},{"name":"Sun in My Belly","address":"2161 College Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Really good food.

Chicken wings, and fried squid and it's worth the wait.   I also like the butter beef.  Always a line-up but it's worth the wait.  Don't waste tables by coming here with just 2 people total.

All the food was chompable.  I am just sad that we forgot our to-go box."},{"name":"Gunshow","address":"924 Garrett St, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This place far exceeded expectations, I think it is important to know coming in what exactly to expect, the cafeteria style seating was different than I am accustom to but totally fits the vibe of the restaurant. My friend had expected it to be a western theme based of the name and we were presently surprised by the classic rock music playing. It is definitely a louder restaurant so maybe not the best for a quite intimate dinner. The toasted old fashioned was delicious.
