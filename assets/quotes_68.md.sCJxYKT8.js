(And I don't see it as pretentious...it sure wants to be though.)   I wasn't impressed to say the least.  First of all, they don't have a coat check.  Which isn't something I normally care about but when its dark in the restaurant and coats are draped on the backs of chairs people tend to step on them or trip over them.  (Not to mention unsightly...)  I don't get what is so \\"New York\\" about this place....places and NY don't decorate with wood paneling.  We asked for a booth and we were told they were for a reservation of four. . .even though we had a reservation too.  Then we sat at a table in full view of several booths that were unoccupied for the duration of our meal. \\n\\nThey have a million girly drinks (not my thing but if you're into it, thats cool) some of which are made with champagne. But no champagne by the glass. When I asked the waitress for one she got the most confused look on her face. \\"You mean you don't want it mixed with peach schnapps, chambord, grenadine and coated with pop rocks?\\" The food is cheap though which was a nice surprise, although I'm pretty sure they cook their food in lard. It was so greasy and salty and I felt so sick afterwards.  We actually didn't end up having one of their sliders which is supposed to be the whole draw. But if the margherita pizza was insanely greasy I can only imagine what the burgers were like. \\n\\nIf you know what fine dining is, don't expect it from Match because you will be disappointed.  However, if your expectations are for cheap bar food and girly drinks, then they will deliver.\\n\\nUpdate- Yelp Elite Status Event\\n\\nWe tried to get there early but they wouldn't let us in 10 minutes beforehand.  \\n\\nOk, lets be real for a second.  They were hosting an event for a group of people that review businesses and who, up until that point, had been giving them lukewarm reviews- of course they were going to have their game face on.  For a private party they did a great job and I'll give them one more star for trying. \\n \\nBut I still maintain the food is gross.  Why does everything need to be so damn greasy?  I could only stomach one of their sliders before my stomach began to turn.  The calamari is uninspired (is that duck sauce?) and the satay was average.  And once again, the pizza was greasy.   I can't even do the drinks there either.  I had a bubbletini which tasted like cough syrup.  I switched to a regular Kir Royale after that not wanting to even try another of their mixed drinks.  \\n \\nIt also would have been helpful if they gave out little plates to eat the apps with, seeing as I cannot put an entire slider in my mouth at once and I need to eat it in several bites.  I would have liked a plate to put it on instead of a grease soaked napkin.   \\n\\nI did give it another shot, in the name of Yelp, but again I wasn't impressed.

The space is very tight so get ready to know your neighbors.  Also, they don't take reservations and are quite popular, so come early if you don't want to wait too long. \\n\\nNew England Clam Chowder - not as thick or buttery as most new England clam chowders, but still very hearty and the seafood flavors were much more distinct in this chowder. I could really taste the clams, which were large and tender. The firm chunks of potatoes and celery also added a nice contrast to the texture. \\n\\nOysters and Sea Urchin - they have one of the largest oyster selections I've ever seen, and I appreciated the helpful descriptions listed on their menu for each oyster (e.g. nutty finish, sweet pea taste, salty, sweet, size, etc).

The sea urchin was good, but wasn't that creamy. \\n\\nWarm Buttered Lobster Roll - heaping with warm, sweet buttery meat from a 1  1/2 lobster in a toasted roll...straightforward and perfectly executed. It's also served with a generous portion of fries - because the fat from all the butter isn't unhealthy enough, of course.  :-)\\n\\nLobster Stroganoff with Wild Mushrooms - again, they don't skimp on their seafood here...there was more lobster than pasta in this stroganoff. And because they use cr√®me fraiche instead of sour cream, the sauce was less tangy and enhanced the sweetness of the lobster meat. The egg noodles were delicate, while the flavors were rich and earthy. Admittedly, I thought the dish could have used a little more salt or something else to perk it up. It's a huge portion, so I got kind of bored half-way through it - although my husband loved this stroganoff and happily finished the rest.  \\n\\nOverall, I really liked the unfussy personality and plethora of seafood at Neptune Oyster.

It was soft, warm, and gooey and ever so flavorful with the sweetness and hints of Bourbon packed into each bite.  The Reggie, Reggie Deluxe, and Regina were very enjoyable.  The Biscuits were warm, dense, and soft.  It was the best Biscuits we've tasted, thus far.  The Reggie (w/o egg) and Reggie Deluxe that was a Biscuit covered in gravy, crispy chicken, bacon, and an over easy egg, melded every so exquisitely.  The Regina composed of a Biscuit with collard greens and an over easy egg with a hot sauce was flavorful.\\n\\nIncidentally, don't forget to to get your own water, utensils, and napkins and condiments before you sit down.  The busboys and girls will clear your table and bring the food to you, though.  If you want, you can clear the tables, like we did, too.

At Bondir, doneness was perfect in almost everything we ordered, but where was the salt?  This might not be a problem for most people (particularly in salt-phobic New England), but it was a problem for me.  Here is what we ordered:\\n\\n1) winter squash soup with marshmallows -- a tad too sweet for my taste, but not bad in principle\\n2) grits with vegetables -- lovely creamy grits, a huge variety of vegetables cooked in all different ways.  fabulous dish, just needed salt\\n3) lobster risotto with mussels -- mushy texture of rice and somewhat muddy flavor\\n4) poached egg with mushrooms and sage stuffing -- tender white, perfectly runny and very rich yolk, fabulous mushrooms (I am guessing maitake and wood ear), stuffing that was absolutely decadent once you break the yolk over it.  one of the best egg dishes I've ever had (after I added some salt :)\\n5) monkfish with safron broth, leeks, turnips, and potato -- very juicy monk with a good sear, flavorful broth and very nicely done vegetables.  the only dish that didn't need extra salt.  maybe just a little on the potato\\n6) lamb chop and stuffed leg, beans, vegetables -- perfectly medium-rare and juicy lamb.  The chop was under-seasoned, but the leg was stuffed with so much anchovies it was way unpleasantly salty even for me.  vegetables and beans had perfect texture just needed salt.\\n\\nWe got a little dish or sea salt, but a basic Diamond Crystal Kosher would be more useful.  The sea salt was a little damp and clumpy (that's a feature of this salt, not a bug).  But it doesn't integrate into the finished dish very easily.\\n\\nThe bread:\\nThey make their own bread and even put it on the menu.  It has promise, but is no where close in quality to Clear Flour or Iggy's.  Two problems with it were very low salt level (I am guessing only 1% instead of the standard 2% by weight), and burnt crust.  They put a swirl of something interesting into each loaf (rosemary, goose cracklings, cherry and walnuts).  I must say that the goose cracklings were tasty, but these flavorings don't make or break the bread for me.  In my opinion a restaurant shouldn't bother baking their own bread unless they can match the quality of what they can get from Iggy's and Clear Flour.  But bread baking is hard and I admire Bondir for trying.\\n\\nI loved the fact that almost all the dishes offered a small and large size options.  This allowed us to try almost the entire menu at a very reasonable price.  We ordered 6 small dishes ranging in price from $9 to $15.\\n\\nWonderful wine list with many food-friendly wines by the glass that are not widely known and don't break the bank.  We got a glass of Gr√ºner Veltliner (excellent) and barbera, dolcetto, nebbiolo blend (very good).  I believe they were $8-9 per glass.  \\n\\nOverall, it was a lovely meal and I'd like to come back.  If Bondir was better at seasoning, it would be a serious competitor to Craigie on Main."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Okay I hope this sits the stage.....

My husband and I had a last moment idea of having lunch at the Grill to celebrate our anniversary. No reservations, and no real expectations because we really knew very little about this location. \\n\\nFirst of all, not being from Portland, it was a little hard to find. The parking for this restaurant in underground in a parking structure in a building adjacent to the high-rise the Portland City Grill is located in. .....Did you follow that? To get up to the grill is easy enough; you hop in an elevator from the parking garage and head up to the 30th floor. Easy. Going back down though is another story. If you get into the wrong set of elevators you'll never get back to the parking level. One set travels from floor 1 and then 31 and higher. The other set travels from parking to floor 30. Now, if you still follow me, let me get into the meal itself.\\n\\nFirst of all, there was absolutely no wait. We walked in and were seated right away with a beautiful window view of the eastern Portland skyline. I guess we had just missed the lunch time rush. That's the way to do it if you want to avoid the crowds and reservations!\\n\\nOur waitress quickly greeted us and bought us our drinks. My husband and I both started with a salad and a glass of wine. Surprisingly we lucked out and dined when all glasses of wine were $5 a glass! SCORE! I'll take the most expensive Pinot Noir please! ....Make that 2 glasses por favor!\\n\\nOur salads came out and I have to say it was one of the best salads I have ever had...until I got to the bottom of it where pools of dressing drenched every piece of lettuce. However, getting past that was not too hard. Sure, they need to cut back on the dressing, but it was still a good salad.\\n\\nNext we had a cup of soup....decent. Needed a bit more salt though. Our main courses were good, nothing spectacular, but decent. Honestly I have to say that I was a bit surprised that the meals were not better. What very little I had heard of the Grill was that it was a fine dining restaurant. To me, that usually means really, really good food. And that just wasn't the case. Maybe the lunch time chefs are junior in their training than the dinner chefs?? Don't know. My lunch seemed to have been nuked in a microwave as it was steaming hot and burned my mouth when I took my first bite. It was a pasta dish and usually those kinds of dishes and plates don't retain that intense heat unless nuked. My husband had a steak, so I am guessing my simple meal was done before his and they heated mine up right before serving it. Not sure if that was what happen, but it seemed that way.\\n\\nOur desserts were absolutely delicious. We didn't have a choice in what dessert we wanted; there was only one served. However, for us, it was perfect. That, with my glass of wine was a perfect ending to a decent lunch. Had our main courses been just a notch or two better I would have gladly given the Portland City Grill 5 stars. We had a perfect server, chef served us our main meals, and the manager came out to check on us.

Really really wonderful appetizer.\\n\\nWe ordered the 101 Burger and a Cuban sandwich. My sandwich was exactly what you hope for in a burger- juicy, but not messy. Flavorful, but not overwhelming. I loved the horseradish mayo and thick bacon which topped this high-quality beef burger. I also liked my salt and vinegar kettle chips. Crisp and flavored well!\\n\\nTwo sandwiches, 1 beer, and 1 beverage was only $37.09.  We felt this was a fair value for a really good meal. Our server, Adam, was very attentive and friendly.

Here it's The Reggie. First-timers definitely need to order it. Repeat visitors will be hard pressed to explore the rest of the menu, tempting as those choices sound. \\n\\nThe Reggie starts with a biscuit. It isn't the best in town, but it's more of a service vehicle than anything else, and let's face it: nobody ooh'd and ahh'd over the canvas Picasso used - the beauty was in the pretty pictures he created. The same holds true for The Reggie. Start with the fried chicken: a generous portion of breast meat, perfectly crispy and expertly seasoned. Top that with chunky, peppery country gravy. Add bacon. Finish with gooey, melted cheddar cheese. The end result? A sinful yet delicious masterpiece, a true work of art. Speaking of work, that's what it takes to devour The Reggie. You'll need to open wide to eat this thing, it's so thick. And trust me, once you start opening wide, you won't be able to quit until all that's left of the sandwich is a few scattered crumbs and many happy memories. You can go and up the ante with a Reggie Deluxe, which adds an egg to the already-generous creation, and how perfectly Portland is that? You'll just have to open a little wider. \\n\\nOn a followup visit I was in a rhyming mood and tried The Wedgie. This consisted of fried chicken, a fried green tomato, iceberg lettuce and blue cheese dressing all tucked between a biscuit. If anything, it was even taller than The Reggie, and pretty damn tasty in its own way. \\n\\nDelve deeper and you'll find biscuit sandwiches like The McIsley (fried chicken with pickles, mustard and honey) and The Chatfield (fried chicken, bacon and cheese topped with apple butter). While there is a definite devotion to fried chicken, other options exist; The Regina consists of an egg over easy with braised greens and topped with hot sauce (Texas Pete, one of the better bottled brands out there). There's also a steak club, a pulled pork sandwich, and a trio of grit cakes topped with a variety of toppings. The Moneyball is not only a Brad Pitt movie but Pine State's version of biscuits and gravy. You can even get a corn dog here (but, umm...why would you?).\\n\\nBeverages are standard fare, but I like that you can order a Bloody Mary. Theirs is nice and peppery, the perfect complement for the mile-high chicken biscuits. \\n\\nSeating (if you're lucky enough to get it) is simple. You can belly up to the bar or stake a claim to a table. Since this is the Alberta Arts District, if the weather is nice and you can snag a table outdoors, by all means do so. It's a great opportunity for people watching."},{"name":"Murphy's","address":"997 Virginia Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Murphy's is one of my favorite restaurants in Atlanta, whether it's for brunch, lunch, or dinner. \\n\\nBrunch can be a bit hectic because there are always tons of people waiting to get in. When (not if) you have to wait, just grab a drink from the bar and enjoy it outside if the weather is nice. \\n\\nOne of my favorite things about their brunch is that the delicious bread basket they give you that's filled with biscuits, muffins, and other breakfast pastries. The omelet here is great, as are the many renditions of eggs benedict. I've also tried the pancakes, and they are very good, too. \\n\\nLunch at Murphy's is also great because they serve many of the same breakfast dishes but the environment is overall more relaxing. I've been known to get an omelet and a side of their Caesar salad for a lighter, but still satisfying, meal. \\n\\nDinner at Murphy's is no less crazy than any other time of day. The atmosphere is intimate and fun. On my most recent visit for dinner, I had the roasted beet salad. Although the combination of roasted beets and goat cheese is kind of overdone, I loved the spin on this dish. It came with orange and marcona almonds, which complemented the beets wonderfully and also helped to temper the spiciness of the arugula. I don't even like arugula, but I loved this dish. \\n\\nI wasn't feeling like eating much meat, so I went with the seasonal vegetable plate. I understand that this plate changes quite frequently. On my trip, there was a barley salad, some perfectly roasted potatoes, more roasted beets (I love beets so I was fine with the repeat here), and a fun, if a bit heavy, crispy egg roll. Everything was delicious, and I love that the chef actually took the time to compose a plate that wasn't just a throwaway in terms of ingredients or creativity. I'm no vegetarian, but I appreciated the thought and care that was obviously put into creating the medley of flavors. The plate was also huge, so I took half home to enjoy later. \\n\\nFinally, I'd be crazy if I reviewed Murphy's and didn't mention their exquisite dessert selection. I've loved every dessert that I've ever tried here. Many of the offerings are also seasonal and rotate on a regular basis. However, you're always guaranteed to be able to order the Bonzo and Tollhouse Pie. Both are on the sweeter side of desserts and incredibly rich, so I prefer to go with the lighter options (well, at least as light as dessert can get). I recently tried a pear crisp/crumble that was perfect for sharing. It was served warm with ice cream - the perfect antidote to the chilly weather outside. \\n\\nHands down, though, my favorite dessert I've ever had here was the carrot cake. This slice is awesome. The cake itself isn't overly spiced and packs enough carrot flavor for you to know it's actually a carrot cake. If I'm not mistaken there are also nuts in the cake. Of course, the cream cheese icing only serves to make this cake even better. The wild card of the cake, and what really takes it over the top, is the orange gelee that adorns the top of the cake. It's a perfect complement to the tangy icing and subtly spiced cake. I wish this was also on the menu - that's how good it is."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Love to go to happy hour here, it starts the night off right with a beautiful view.

I do not even remotely consider myself a foodie because typically, the fancier the food, the weirder/more experimental ingredients, the more terrified of it I become. I'm generally not afflicted with food snobbery of any sort, but when it comes to Italian cuisine, I am more picky/demanding than I am with just about any type of food. This is partially because I grew up eating the home cooking of Nonnas, Zias, and even my mom, who learned from Nonnas and Zias, and partially because I lived in Italy for a few years and was fortunate enough to eat in a lot of great restaurants from the tip-toe of the boot all the way up to the borders of schnitzel land, and many homes of family and friends in between. \\n\\nI'm just trying to establish a basis for my opinion here, because when we go out for Japanese, or Ethiopian, I can only tell you what I  like, and not what's authentic. It is possible at times that I like something at a Japanese restaurant that technically doesn't even have the right to be called Japanese. Italian is the only cuisine on which I'm mildly qualified to have an opinion regarding authenticity. Sometimes I eat Italian that is good, but not authentic. So, I say I like it, but it's not Italian. There's an extreme amount of variation in Italian cooking by region, too, but still, once you've eaten there enough, you can generally tell what's been inspired by true Italian cooking, and what's been influenced by American taste buds or current trends in cooking. \\n\\nWhat I'm trying to say through all this rambling, is that Patrizi's may not be the sort of Italian some are used to, but from what I had and what I saw on the menu, it's as close to authentic as I've gotten in Texas. The pasta is fresh and you can watch them rolling it out right in the trailer. They have a lot of very simple sauces, because in Italy, pasta is rarely heavy - particularly the kinds that are eaten regularly, and a few heavier dishes for those who are accustomed to more New York-style, heavier dishes. I had the Cacio e Pepe, which was just olive oil, pepper, and Grana Padano/Pecorino. It was light, flavorful, and the star of the dish was truly the fresh, al dente pasta. Pizza and tomato sauce are two important markers for authenticity in Italian cuisine. They have no pizza, and I didn't get a tomato sauce dish, though I tried a few bites off others' plates, as well as a bite of a meatball, and all of it tasted pretty legit/good to me.\\n\\nIt was still a soft-opening menu when we went, and they're tweaking to find the right mix, but after talking with the owner Nic for a while, I got the impression that he knows what he's doing, and will aim to specialize and keep the menu small, so that the ingredients he offers can be as fresh and locally sourced as possible. He took the time to explain the menu and his vision to us, and they also took the time, before opening, to create a really nice, shaded outdoor dining area next to the trailer. Conveniently, Butterfly Bar is right next door, and you can buy your wine there for $15/bottle. \\n\\nWhile I agree that eating pasta outside in 100 degree temps doesn't sound appetizing, and that a brick-and-mortar Patrizi's would be awesome, I also think that this casual style dining is actually very authentic. Some of my best dinners in Italy were eaten off of plasticware, drinking wine out of short water glasses. I think Patrizi's has the potential to get there, but everyone's gotta start somewhere.\\n\\nOne tiny point of criticism: I didn't like the look of the Carbonara, with the basically raw egg cracked on top. Perhaps that is common in some region, but in Rome, home of Carbonara, you crack the egg in the pot immediately once the pasta is done and drained, and stir it around so it cooks. I would not want egg yolk all over my Carbonara. '\\n\\nOtherwise, Patrizi's is a great alternative to the abundance of Asian and fried-stuff trailers in Austin. I hope they stick around.

My friend and I dined here on a Saturday night at 8pm after making reservations a few weeks in advance. First thing I noticed about the restaurant was the first floor kitchen is placed horribly. It's right next to the host/hostess stand where they check people in, which was crowded, and the poor waiters were having to weave around the crowd to get in and out of the kitchen. It made the scene look chaotic. Also the host/hostess stand wasn't setting a great tone for the restaurant. It was messy (receipts, straw wrappers, and a few toothpicks scattered around on it, which just made me feel like I wasn't in the high class dining establishment that the prices on the menu had me believe this place was. The attention to cleanliness wasn't there, at least at the time I was there. The hostess announced my name and we walked up to her, and she led us up the stairs and to a table. No \\"How are you doing today?\\" or any other sort of greeting whatsoever from her. She led us to the 2nd floor and to a table hidden in the corner right next to another very active kitchen door where we would have a view of a plain wall and nothing else (it was literally the darkest, most boring table on the whole floor), when the floor was barely half empty and there were at least 5 tables within our view that were along windows with no one sitting at them. I asked if there was any way we could have one of those tables, and she moved us over there instead. I still just hate to be sat in the worst table on the floor when there are so many open tables... I shouldn't have to ask. It's the decent thing to do.\\n\\nOur waiter was nice, but totally clueless. My friend doesn't drink, and when we asked him if they could fix my friend a fun virgin cocktail (cause usually Disney restaurants have some fun virgin drinks on their menu with unique ingredients just like the fun boozy ones), he said something along the lines of \\"I dunno really about that kinda stuff, I mean you could mix pineapple juice and apple juice or something? I don't know\\". No \\"Hmm I'm not really versed in that, let me go ask our bartender what they might recommend\\". Nothing, nada. So my friend just said \\"It's ok, I'll just have water\\" and I ordered a glass of Pellegrino. 20 mins later, the waiter came back with my drink and said to me \\"Not gonna lie, I forgot about you\\". Very nice buddy.\\n\\nWe ordered a mix of appetizers and small plates as well as dessert. The carrot cake dessert we had was good, but not anything too special, though it did finish off the meal nicely considering we were pretty underwhelmed with the food. The other plates were OK but nothing to write home about. Our side caesar salads we bland - mostly white lettuce, dressing, and 2 croutons. Our conch soup barely had any conch in it at all and the tomato-based soup was about the caliber I'd expect to find in a Progresso can. The crab-topped fries were the best part of the meal and I'd say the best value as well, as it was a large dish. But otherwise, we were left extremely underwhelmed with both the food and experience. There are so many wonderful restaurants at WDW that I really don't see myself giving this place a second chance. I like to give places the benefit of the doubt, because I know every place has off nights - people call in sick, you catch a waiter at the wrong time, the kitchen messes up your dish.

We had a bunch of different dishes, including the charcuterie (fantastic) and cheese plate (even better).  The bone marrow appetizer was rich and flavorful, and the curry carrot soup (a special) was also tasty.  The coq au vin was interesting but drier than I expected, and the hanger steak and frites was just amazing -- goat cheese gave a wonderfully earthy undertone to the sauce, which went perfectly with the fries.  My favorite dish was probably the brussel sprouts though -- I've never had any better.

After I ran into him a second time, Muselet was still on his mind so we made plans to go.  Last Wednesday, our party of four went for dinner--surprisingly, the dining room was full so we were seated in the lounge.  Noted, need reservations in the future. So busy for being mid-week.  Service was on point, my friend was running late so we were waiting, the server made sure to check on us to see if we needed anything.  \\n\\nWe started on appetizers, we ordered half a dozen oysters and smoked salmon.  The oysters were the Netarts variety, I like that they were locally sourced but it had a bitter aftertaste to them and part of it was due to the melon mignonette.  Unfortunately, it could've been shucked more cleanly because I got shells in them.  The smoked salmon was delicious, it came with currants and a horseradish cream--I typically don't care for horseradish but it was mild and complimented the salmon well.  My friend said it had changed and he preferred the previous preparation he had, but I thought it was still good.  For entrees, we got two orders of Spot Prawns, Pork Crepinette, and Wagyu Cullote with the broccoli and carrot sides.  We kind of all picked at each others' food.  Hands down, the spot prawns!  The prawns and hen of the woods mushroom was served cooked over river rocks with doug fir.  The heads came deep-fried but the rocks was the right temperature because the prawns were cooked perfectly.  It was served with some lettuce and an aioli dipping sauce--the combinations of flavor was exquisite!  The majority of us concluded that it was the best dish of the evening.  Wagyu beef had chanterelle, pine cream, hazelnut, and mustard jus.  Meat came out on the rare side and tender, had so many complex taste in one bite.  I don't care too much for the Pork Crepinette only because everything else was so flavorful but it was cooked well and succulent.  The vegetables were sort of an afterthought.  \\n\\nAgain, service was fantastic and hospitality was wonderful.  Asked for recommendations on wine and received some good suggestions.  My water was always being refilled, more bread was brought out, and servers were on hand when needed.  The owner came around to see how we liked our meal and greeted us when we were leaving.  My friend was concerned that he might have hyped it up too much or that I didn't believe him how good it would be...pleasantly, it met expectations.

However, they were not warm...neither were the fries.  COLD friggin food sucks.  We tried to flag down one of the servers (in the over 21 den) but by the time anyone had showed up we had  long given up and started eating because we were starving.\\n\\nThe beers were pretty blah in flavor, surprisingly.  Also, considering this is a brewpub they were also overpriced at $5.50 per \\"Imperial pint\\" that was only 4/5ths full= a smidge over regular pint, so not really a true Imperial. \\n\\nWith all the local mom and pop brew pubs in town this left us underwhelmed and deflated.  I expected more for $40 (plus tip) for 2 beers, 2 burgers....\\n\\nRaccoon Lodge, you need some serious help with service and quality and get over yourself with your OVER inflated Prices.

Given how tiny this place is, the waits can be annoyingly long.\\n\\n But on this past Friday afternoon around 3:30, I was actually able to saunter right in with a dear friend and we bellied right up to the marble topped bar where two seats seemed to invite us to sit right down.  Hallelujah, such good fortune, perhaps divine intervention: hallelujah; we were actually in!   I do believe my jaw was hanging agape.\\n\\nI love the look of this little shoebox of a place from the black and white tile floor which must be original...and if it isn't someone did a seriously great repro job and I want their name, to the tin ceiling to every old world charm detail. \\n\\nWe ordered two of probably every oyster they had on the menu and had fun comparing our impressions to the ones written on oyster description card...nutty, creamy, pea-like, etc. \\nI have yet to meet an oyster I don't love and enjoy experiencing the nuanced differences amongst the different kinds.\\n\\nWe were savoring these oysters with a lush bottle of prosecco when a feeling of well-being came over me and it occured to me that I was happy and in a gustatory heaven. Such is the power of oysters and prosecco. In fact these two items are on my \\"Last Meal\\" Yelp profile list.\\n\\nI hoped I wasn't jinxing myself because I had an otherwise busy weekend planned and was not quite ready to kick the bucket despite how delicious the food and drink were.\\n\\nWe followed the oysters with one of the now famed and much Yelped about hot buttered toasted lobster rolls which we split.  Don't get me wrong, I could have very easily eaten the entire fabulous dripping with deliciousness whole thing. I bet I could have eaten two of them.  It is in fact as superb as everyone raves.  But it is incredibly rich and so it was probably best for our arteries that we split one.  It comes with a side of fries but they were really beside the point.\\n\\nThe minus one star is for the less than friendly, indifferent service we received.  Would it have killed one of the gaggle of gals behind the bar to smile, or to utter something remotely inviting or even to just fake a look if they had to, of being even vaguely interested in us? \\n\\nSadly, this is what sometimes happens to places that go \\"viral\\" in popularity.  They don't feel like they need to do much because regardless, people will still flock to stand in line outside the door forever and a day just try those dang lobster rolls and oysters.

I saw a pink prosciutto being sliced paper-thin, a skewer of lobster being plunged into a mysterious cauldron with flames leaping out, and perfect, simple salads being plated and slid down the bar.  It was all very nice, and before I knew it, I had a glass of wine and a pizza on the way. \\n\\nI was sad to find that Scampo no longer does housemade mozzarella for its mozz bar (the mozz was so popular that it didn't scale), but that they do make it for the pizza and a handful of other dishes.  I tried the anchovy and garlic pizza, which was pricy at $15 but the perfect size for 2 people to split, so not a bad option for a light meal or appetizer (they also have the famous Locke-Ober lobster pizza, not bad for $25).  \\n\\nYou couldn't quite taste the housemade mozz, but overall it was a lovely salty pizza, with a light, flammekeuche-like crust, sliced potato, red onion, a bit of cream and lots of mildly-flavored garlic heads that could be eaten whole. I ordered a great white wine to pair with it - I forget what it was now, but I ordered it on the suggestion of the waiter and was not disappointed.\\n\\nWe also had the opportunity to try the truffled gnocci, which was delicious. The gnocci was soft and almost melted in our mouths, and the mushrooms were substantial enough to stand up to any of the meats on the menu. It was a small portion, but worth splitting as well just for the taste experience.\\n\\nI agree that the prices here are high for what you get (it's clear that the clientele is mostly wealthy socialites and the like who don't care as much about value). And I think that the cocktail list, while inoffensive, was not on par with what I would expect for a Lydia Shire restaurant.  And while my waiter was wonderfully friendly and chatty, he did not seem to know the menu as well as I would have liked (he wasn't sure where certain foods were sourced, and overall seemed confused at some of my questions).  \\n\\nI think perhaps part of this problem stems from the fact that Shire opened Blue Sky at around the same time as she opened Scampo.  While many people marveled at this -- \\"it's like having twins!\\", people said - I think that what you can see now is that this cost Scampo some of the careful planning, training and execution that it might have had if it were Shire's only child at the time. She did a smart thing by bringing over many experienced staff members from her other properties, and trusting them to run the place, but everyone knows that leaving your kids in the capable hands of their loving teenage siblings is no substitute for real parenting. And while Scampo is doing well, and the food is very good, and I'm happy with what I had, I agree that it could still be better.  \\n\\nI'll still come back, though, because the Liberty Hotel is such an amazing place overall, and I think out of town guests would love this tucked-away, insidery secret of a place in the basement of an old jail. You have to love that."},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"7300 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Have been to this location a few times.

I wanted to go to James Hook but I figured hey, when will I be back in Boston again..might as well give Neptunes a try. One thing I didn't expect was that the place was smaller than my living room. There's only one long community table and then bar seating on the other side. You can barely walk through the whole place without hitting someone's elbow along the way. I'm suprised we only had to wait 45 mins to get a seat on a Thursday afternoon. Seems like the waitresses are partial to the people who are spending big money because no one said a word to us the entire time after taking our order but they seemed super friendly to the group next to us who ordered a roll each and some appetizers. \\n\\nWith that being said, the best part were the oysters. They were really fresh and tasty, even the ones with high brine which I tend not to care for but the ones they served were chilled to perfection and delectable. The fried clam strips were not mind-blowing but pretty good and was served with an unusual type of what I assumed to be tartar sauce which resembled finely diced coleslaw. I'm not sure if it was actually coleslaw or not but either way it added a needed freshness to the dish. The breading on the clam strips was light and perfectly crisp. The most disappointing part of the meal was actually the lobster roll which was a whopping $30 and not enough lobster meat to constitute such a hefty price tag. The lobster itself was high quality and very fresh, but why in the world they served it on that tasteless and puny bread just blows my mind. Bread makes or breaks a lobster roll and this one was definitely the latter. I couldn't get over how bad the bread was. My husband said it reminded him of a cheap hotdog bun with the insides taken out. What a disaster and crying shame that it didn't highlight what was inside. It ruined the whole thing for me and on top of that it was soggy at the bottom. They give you a huge mound of greasy fries maybe to make the dish look substancial for what they charge but they are so heavy it makes you feel like a slug after you eat them. I would skip them altogether. \\n\\nWe ordered a lobster roll, fried clams strips and half a dozen oysters and our bill came out to nearly $90. Say what??!!? Okay, so now I can say I've been to Neptunes, but I doubt it I will ever go back the next time I visit here. I'll stick to the shack on the side of the road joints that don't charge an arm and a leg and deliver lobster that's just as fresh."},{"name":"La Posada","address":"505 Medford St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"This place seems to have a pretty bimodal distribution in the recent reviews.

My partner's tacos were pretty uninspired.\\n\\nFor a place alleged to have the best tacos in Somerville, I expected much better. I haven't tried Karina L's recommendation for Rincons, but until I do, Tenoch remains my go-to place for tacos.\\n\\nOverall, a weak 3, but the benefit of the doubt goes to a place with character."},{"name":"BBR Columbus","address":"106 Vine St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"We snagged one of the fabulous Yelp Deals for this place and figured we'd check it out before we went to witness yet another Blue Jackets loss. So if you're curious about the nightlife here, you probably want to read another review. \\n\\nI'll get the not so great out of the way first.\\n\\nWe never ended up using the Yelp deal on the first visit because half of our meal ended up being comped and it wouldn't have been worth it too burn it off on what was left of our bill.\\n\\nPart I: Opportunity\\n\\nOn our first trip to Burgers, Beer & Rock we came in at about 5pm on a weeknight to a mostly empty house. I will say that the place has a nice modern rockstar decor to it, but the first thing you actually noticed was that the music was approaching bleeding ears levels and that is coming from someone who listens to his iPod at full blast most of the time. \\n\\nAfter being sat we were greeted by our server who appeared to not be having a good day. Everyone else in the place was all smiles and friendly, she on the other hand was pretty much sulking. No biggie, we all have bad days, and she wasn't actually rude to us at all. \\n\\nOrdering was a challenge due to the excessively loud music. My wife (who used to be a server) remarked at how amazing it was that she could hear anything to take people's orders. Well...turns out she couldn't. When she brought our food out to us she had my wife's food right, but my order mixed up (she did bring the right side, more on that in a bit). She was apologetic and said they'd have my order out to me promptly, which they did.\\n\\nThe food the first time was a mixed bag. We started with the calamari, which is one of my favorite appetizers, and I made the mistake of just seeing the dish and ordering without reading the description. This was a bad move. They ruin it by pre-tossing it in the same sweet chile sauce that everyone and their brother uses. I have nothing against the sauce (it's tasty!), but it should be on the side so the calamari stays light and crisp. The next uh-oh is also kind of a \\"shame on me situation\\" for coming to a place that's name stands for Burgers Beer & Rock and not ordering a Burger. In my quest to eat healthier I went for the Shrimp Kabobs with green beans, while my much wiser wife ordered a burger. Her burger was large, tasty and most importantly cooked the way she had asked. Major points for it being done right because nothing riles me more than places that will ask you for a temperature on your burger and just cook it however they want anyway. Aside from the fact that I was brought the wrong item to start, my food was ok. The shrimp kabobs were excellent, but the green beans were overcooked and soaked in an overly vinegary vinaigrette and nearly inedible.\\n\\nPart II: Redemption\\n\\nWe came back on another game night some weeks later during the Holidays. This time there was a decent crowd going and right off the bat when we walked in you could tell that the music was turned down a tad. Still nice and loud, but reasonably so.\\n\\nThis time we sat at the bar, service was friendly and checked on us often even when it started to get busier closer to game time. \\n\\nAs for food, both of us went for burgers this time and we were not disappointed. I opted to indulge and got the garlic parmesan fries, which are paradise soaked in grease and garlic. We had a little hiccup using our Yelp Deal, as they didn't want to honor it via my phone, but with a little prodding they accepted it.\\n\\nBottom Line: Not an out of this world place that I'm dying to go back to, but if burgers are what we crave for our pre CBJ game meal it's where I'm going to go and I'm going to work out extra hard at the Gym that day to justify the delicious garlic parmesan fries."},{"name":"Maitland Breakfast Club","address":"745 Orienta Ave","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4","text":"For $5.50 breakfast specials, Breakfast Club will be hard to top.

We ordered appetizers, spanish octopus and clam chowder. The clam chowder wasn't thick or thin of a soup. It had a great consistency for a milky soup and best of all there were actual clams in it. The taste was perfect. Spanish octopus was amazing. It wasn't chewy. The octopus was cooked right and it was quite tasty. For the main entree, we ordered the maine lobster roll sandwich with butter and with a salad side rather than the fries. The amount of lobster in the sandwich was lot. They simply fresh. Each bite was quite delicious felt like I was in heaven. Lastly, the oyster was quite fresh and tasty! They had several selections of oysters. We tried about 3 different kinds. After eating the dfferent kind of oysters left us wanting more.\\n\\nOverall, this place is worth going to when you are in Boston or even crazing seafood. The restaurant isn't big but quite cozy.

I literally pored and lingered over the menu, everything sounded delicious. There were tons of unusual flavor profiles, food combinations and several cuisine influences. Far from standard seafood house options.\\n\\nI decide on squid diavola which was grilled and then stewed in a spicy delicious tomato sauce with beans and isreali couscous. \\nI would definitely go back here with more of an appetitie so I could really eat my way through the menu.

However, the beer selection is outstanding. From Alagash to Rouge. Dogfish Head to PBR (I am from Milwaukee so I have to rep Wisconsin), Redbones does run the gamut. Going here for a few pints and some hush puppies with that great spiced vinegar for dipping is perfect. Plus, the Davis Square/Tufts crowd is nice compared to other neighborhoods. The service has always been good and being that the place is generally packed, you still get good service. \\n\\nNow the food is good. It isn't bad at all. But for a place to call itself a BBQ joint and serve food like that disappoints me a bit. But there are select dished that are very good. The Jerk Beef sandwich is quite good and spicy. Also the fried oysters are good. Furthermore, they have complimentary corn bread. However, the benchmark of a BBQ restaurant, depending on where it is is either the pulled pork or brisket, neither of which is amazing. Again, they are good, but not great. If you are looking for really good BBQ and wont be going to Texas, Kansas City, or Memphis any time soon, try Blue Ribbon BBQ.

It has been featured on television shows and is regularly lauded as an Orlando area gem. That is a valuable playing card in a flooded market. It takes time to build such a reputation. But, at the end of the day, a restaurant is only as good as the most recent plate served.\\nWell then, it is with all due respect to long-time patrons and those that have happy memories of this establishment that I call foul. Big rotten outdated foul.\\nThe exterior is charming; a patio, fountains, various plantings and country chic decorative touches. The interior is similar though some items do smack of the clearance aisle at Tuesday Morning. I appreciate aesthetic choices and enjoy discussing such but when it comes to dining, I will get onto the more important aspects.\\nMy husband and I went for a romantic dinner and experienced something that was more comedic than tender --- literally.\\nOur server arrived to the table out of breath and seemingly in a mildly desperate state. He muttered forth some specials, including mention of the souffl√© but could not recall all the available flavors. This is a finer dining establishment, sir. Why are you sweating and panting like Chris Farley in need of his next fix? (Too soon?) Not appropriate and certainly not romantic. How can you not remember information about one of the restaurant's signature dishes? I had thought that I may order the souffl√© but was put off by this underwhelming mention of it. The man also spilled my wine when he was pouring it. This lack of polish was later augmented with inattentiveness and discourteousness. In fact, after he explained that our plates were very hot, he placed my husband's large plate in front of him with the steak at the far end of the plate and the sides nearer. How is one supposed to cut a steak on a hot plate when it is the farthest thing away?\\nService be damned. Good food can save any indiscretion. Right? So, I truly wish that we had received good food. My husband's steak, which he ordered medium rare on the assumption that a restaurant such as Le Coq Au Vin would be serving a quality piece of meat even for their basic steak dish, was tough and fibrous. He was quite disappointed. Quite. My salmon was acceptable, probably of a slightly higher quality than the steak. The buerre blanc with the salmon was common, not in the a-classic-is-simple-but-good way but in the boring way. Our sides were the same and we agreed that the carrots were sublime, the gratin potatoes very good and the green beans overcooked.\\nI did, afterall, want the souffl√© --- it was one of the reasons we sought out a meal at Le Coq Au Vin --- but did not see our server again in time to order it because the kitchen needs a 30 minute lead time. So, no souffl√©... poorly described or not.\\nIt turns out that our graceless server had been cut and a different gentleman cleared our dinner plates and served our dessert which was a chocolate bread pudding. This object was less a pudding and more a puck-like muffin-looking lump with a pad of vanilla ice cream on top. It's salvaging feature was a delicious raspberry sauce.\\nOur second server was attentive and dignified, far more in keeping with what we initially expected. He got our bill together including making a correction left over from the former server's errors in ringing in our order. We grappled with how to tip. Did this second gentleman get the money or did it go, later on perhaps, to the previous oaf? In the end, we left a short-ish 20% unsure as to whom would be receiving this only okay number. We had, averaged out between the two, only okay service. Note: it is the competence of the second server that makes this review 2 stars not 1. Neither the first server nor much about our food warrants more than one star. \\nA few days later I find myself questioning whether or not we went to Le Coq Au Vin on an off night. Perhaps (I hope) our primary server was new. Perhaps it was a bad week for ingredients and the kitchen had to make do with what was available. Most of all, I want to believe that this many people can't be this wrong about a place for so long. Or maybe that is the problem. Good food cannot be created on reputation and longevity alone. Unfortunately, we won't be giving Le Coq Au Vin another chance. Not when there are so many excellent farm-to-table restaurants that are nailing French technique and its descendants AND fusing it to the modern palette AND offering at least a somewhat consistent and competent level of service."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place is a little too pretentious even for Portland.

First, I don't give five star reviews easily, but this place easily earns each star. Secondly, let it be known that I am not vegan. I used to dabble in veganism, but it's just not my cup o' tea. So, praytell, why does an omnivore like me love FoMu so much? Well...\\n\\nDairy doesn't like me, despite how much I love it. This can be a problem because I absolutely adore ice cream; so much so that is practically its own food group. Living in Brighton, I can walk to a number of places that serve ice cream, and I indulged in them plenty (and had the stomach aches afterwards to prove it) until I found my safe haven: FoMu.\\n\\nA vegan Yelper buddy of mine brought me to FoMu and I fell in love as soon as I walked in. The look of the place is unassuming yet pleasant. One would think that a vegan hotspot would look like an eclectic American-Apparel-meets-Urban-Outfitters-meets-a-Burlap-Sack kind of store, but it is simple, attractive, and bright.\\n\\nDespite the fact that we arrived less than 5 minutes before closing time, they served us happily and struck up conversation with us that lasted way past closing. These people are great! They are also very knowledgeable about the ice cream: what the base is made of, what sweetener is used, which flavors have soy, gluten, nuts, and other allergens... they know it all!\\n\\nNow, the ice cream. It rocks my dairy-loving socks off. The mint-carob-chip was heavenly! I've had so many other dairy-free and/or coconut-based ice creams (both store-bought and hand-made) and this is by far the absolute best. It's creamy, not-too-sweet, and flavored perfectly. They have toppings, pints to go, and plenty of flavors to choose from.

Great idea BUT why not do the right thing and just add 25% and distribute it fairly to give the waiters and staff a living wage? The 3% is silly, a token and if you tip 20% on top of entire bill you are tipping the waiter more than your intended 20%. So it's not fair to the kitchen staff or you you the diner and  it's a lose/lose proposition - neither the ethical thing they intended orca fsir distribution of tips and it turns out to be a gotcha moment for the patron when calculating the waiters tip.

We ordered the duck sausage tart with salted foie gras to start, followed by: chicken-fried trout, served as semi-cut pieces with fresh herbs, radish and pickled carrots that you piled into accompanying lettuce leaves for a little wrap; truffle butter corn; and sheep cheese turnovers. Everything was delicious, especially the trout, and prices seemed more than fair for the quality and portion size.

The club sandwich was a passable sandwich if it were reasonably priced ($17 was not reasonable for what was served... Maybe $10 would have been acceptable). The soup was under seasoned, and bland...

The amount of parking available is laughably insufficient and is no where close to accommodating for the amount of traffic it sees. It completely bewilders me why this location is always so busy. I have had oil changes completed at the car shop faster than the amount of time I spent in that line. The employees woefully lacked enthusiasm and enjoyment, I felt like I was in the movie zootopia with the sloths at the DMV. There was no order or organization. The portion sizes have become vastly inferior. I decided to ask for double meat after they had moved on to the next station; the lady might have given me another ounce of meat, certainly not double (which I was charged over 3$ extra for of course). Austin, the GM, is more than uncivil, uncomplimentary, undiplomatic, and many other adjectives. My girlfriend approached the counter immediately after sitting down because her food was cold. The GM curtly handled the situation by making a few brusque and disparaging comments; he then audaciously questioned the validity of her claim. Then, instead of giving her another bowl or heating up the one she complained about, he threw out hers and then dismissively stated he would give her a refund. Immediately following that, he turned around and walked away. I was absolutely baffled by the egregious etiquette of this supposed \\"manager\\". Austin clearly needs to either run through more training courses, or step down as manager if he can't handle difficult situations without responding with indignant behavior and vitriol.

It took a couple bites to get to the guava but when I did it was delicious and not overly sweet. \\n\\nI'd highly recommend coming here for the food and the ambiance.

With such a tiny place and a no reservations policy, I knew coming at peak time on a weekend night was going to be a bit of a challenge. This was not an incorrect assumption.

We ended up waiting an hour and a half, which was exactly what we were told. \\n\\nWe were finally seated by a little half cherub, half merbaby statue perched behind our seats who eyed our every movement with his languid, frozen gaze.

After our adult beverages were procured, we launched into our appetizer and raw bar orders. I got the Japanese octopus salad and the rest of the table got a nice sampling of oysters. I enjoyed my salad, though it didn't quite have the wow factor I thought it would. The little bit of citrus flavor that I did get was divine, just need to pump up the volume. Being the incredibly individualistic persons that we are, everyone got the hot lobster roll for our main course. \\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nCan I say, when you're about 2 prosecco glasses deep on a humid summer night a hot roll of rich meat is maybe not the best idea?

The bread was good, and the portion was massive. And the fries. Oof. I can't even explain how good they were. We did not have to wait long for anything, service was swift but a little barebones.

The salted caramel with bacon yeast based doughnut was heavier than expected.  it has sort of a spongey texture at first bite which morphs into a chewier experience as you chew.  the caramel glaze on top is excellent! the bacon is not too much and gives it a very complimentary salty bite.

I got to go to last Thursday's opening event (which was completely packed) and returned last night. From the outside, Tibby's looks pretty nondescript and like a typical strip mall joint. Inside, however, it's completely funky; the ceilings and walls are purple, and the walls are adorned with objects and art pieces from New Orleans. The speakers play jazz at almost all times.\\n\\nGlancing at the menu, I was pretty surprised at its level of authenticity: jambalayas, gumbos, po' boys, etouffee... Great looking menu. Great tasting, too.\\n\\nDuring the opening event, I got to try the Muffuletta, oyster po' boy, fried eggplants, gumbo and bread pudding. The Muffuletta tasted pretty close to the original back in the French Quarter's Central Grocery. It's not stacked nearly as high, thankfully (the original could easily feed four people). The po' boy was great; the oysters were really tender and it had only the classic fixin's (lettuce, mayo, tomato and pickles) on some nice french bread. The fried eggplants were tasty as well, though nothing I'd go out of my way to order. The rice in the gumbo seemed to be a bit undercooked, but I'll be honest: it tasted so good that I'll give it a second chance at a later date. Lastly, the bread pudding was piping hot and served with a brandy sauce rather than the typical rum sauce. It gave it a (welcome) extra kick! Unfortunately, I didn't manage to get my hands on any beignets that night.\\n\\nLast night, I ordered the crawfish pie and was surprised at what I got. I was expecting some sort of pot pie, but this was shaped more like an empanada and probably used the same kind of pastry. The pastry tasted different than what I would have expected as well (which was puff pastry); I could taste the flour. However, after I got over that initial bite, the pie was great. It was served with their andouille jambalaya which was also delicious. After that came the aforementioned beignets, which were delicious. If you are unfamiliar with beignets, don't let the menu's description fool you. Although they are referred to as donuts, they are much closer to pastries. I'd recommend them with coffee, as that's the classic way to eat them.\\n\\nAs far as the service goes, the staff is extremely helpful and are all very nice people. The food and drinks come out fast. Tibby's apparently spent weeks before the opening training all of their staff members, and it shows. The only disappointment I had with the staff fell on the bartenders. I wanted desperately to try a Sazerac, which is the official cocktail of New Orleans, from where it originates. It's a concoction of rye whiskey, peychaud's bitters and simple syrup, shaken into a chilled glass coated with absinthe (or herbsaint for the paranoid). When I asked for this drink, the bartenders came back with a \\"We have no idea what that is.\\" As impressed as I was at first with the full bar, I would have expected them to know their Louisiana/New Orleans drinks.

We had walked by Tasty n Alder a bunch and finally decided to try it. I didn't read any of the reviews prior so I didn't know what to expect. First off, it's busy! This isn't a big deal since there's tons of things to check out in the area while you wait for your table. We were told about an hour, but it ended up being about 25 minutes. Not bad!\\n\\nOur servers were all very friendly and told us to think casual - plates are meant to be shared and to feel free to grab any server who's eye you can catch if you're in need of something. \\n\\nI didn't end up ordering alcohol, but I did get a lemonade. I think it may have been my favorite thing we got. Super tart, and one glass made it through the entire dinner. Other than the lemonade, we ordered the sauteed chard, the duck breast with port cherry demi glace, the flat iron steak with porcini butter, and a side of the duck duck potatoes. \\n\\nFor food, I'd say the steak and the chard were the stand outs for me. My only complaint is that the chard dish was very small. I would not consider it a good choice for sharing because you may want more than two bites. I also wasn't super happy with the duck breast. It was a bit overdone and it wasn't cut evenly which I thought was kind of strange. Smaller slices seemed to be very cooked and the thicker ones were fine and tasted great. To top that off the cherry demi glace was too sweet and overpowering. The steak was cooked well and while the porcini mushroom butter was good - it was also pretty salty. The duck duck potatoes were the last thing to come out (the chard and duck were brought out together, then the steak, and then the potatoes). They were very heavy and it would have been nice to have them earlier through the meal so you didn't just have all that fat right at the end, but they were tasty! We probably would have been hungry if we hadn't ordered them. \\n\\nUltimately, I'm glad we tried it, but we won't be back. It felt overpriced for what it was and the combinations, while they looked good on paper, just didn't seem to work."},{"name":"Cork & Fork","address":"5180 S Conway Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I was very hopeful since it has so many vegetarian options but I did not like it at all!!!!

We were VERY disappointed!  The first meats we got were overcooked (very well done!), and after asking several different people we finally got them to bring some that was more rare - it was in fact nearly raw, and very bland.  The only exception was the turkey, which was quite tasty.  Aside from the marinated brussels sprouts which were very tasty, the salad bar selections were also very bland and uninteresting.  We were brought bread which I was expecting to be the usual basket of cheenies which are made from yucca flour, but instead got a wheat based substitute which since I am wheat intolerant was another disappointment.  After the meal we decided to try dessert since they had our favorite papaya cream on the menu.  This was the worst part of the whole experience!  It looked beautiful.. but whatever chambord substitute was poured over the cream had spoiled and as we took our first bite it began to curdle the cream!!  Needless to say this was sent back.

I'll break it down, starting with the good (and excellent). The restaurant was full, though with not much of a wait and the host quoted an accurate wait time. The restaurant always smells amazing and we knew we were in for a delicious meal. \\n\\nWe waited for quite a bit before we were greeted by our server, but during this time the host ensured we were hydrated. Overall, the service was slow(er than usual) and there was a forgotten beverage. Not a lot of checking in to see how we were doing, so it took a while before we had the opportunity to remind the server about the missing beverage.\\n\\nWe ordered 3 pies: one cheese; one with sausage and kale; and another with heirloom tomatoes. The pizzas were delicious. The ice cream (salted caramel all around) was as tasty as ever.  \\n\\nThe folks seated next to us had their four legged friend in tow. I can appreciate wanting to bring your pet with you to dinner, people feel their pets are apart of their family. But, this large dog was next to me, rubbing up against my legs and wagging its tail in my face. Dog hair flew through the air, and you know that is not appetizing. When another group of individuals entered the restaurant with their own large dog, the two dogs starting emphatically barking at each other. Both parties claiming that their respective dogs are \\"nice\\".

It felt like I was just eating rice with soy sauce on it. The service was terrible as well. We walked in and stood for 5 minutes without being seated, we even said excuse me for a bunch of times to the workers but they ignored us or did not acknowledge us at all. The ambiance of the room was nice however. I thought there would be ramen due to the other Yelp reviews but there weren't any ramen choices.

Shortly after though I heard them telling people the wait was 2 hours so the key is to get there and stand in line at least 30 mins before they open. I had half dozen oysters, the lobster rolls, clam chowder,  and the uni toast. The oysters were great wish they served it with a mignonette though. The clam chowder was ok,  I wish it was thicker but the clams were very fresh in it. The uni toast was rich and luxurious. But the highlight was definitely the lobster roll. The bread was so soft and pillowy. It was stuffed with a generous portion of sweet lobster meat and butter. I had the roll warm, so amazing. It was served with a side of freshly fried French fries.

My wife and I went for brunch today and sat at the bar area and were very disappointed with the experience. we had to flag someone down for every little thing, nothing was offered.. We ordered our drinks and food all at once, hoping to streamline the experience.... After a very long wait we got our drinks at different times - ironic since we were sitting at the bar. We waited more than 30 minutes and our food had still not arrived... Meanwhile the people on either side of us received their food even though they ordered 15 - 20 minutes after us... Neither of the bartenders noticed that our food had not come out yet... So once again I was forced to flag one of them down and ask where our food was and if it would be possible to get some bread/biscuits while we waited.. They never seemed to scan the bar to see if all was ok. They did bring the biscuits finally and went to check on where our food had gotten off too. After another 10 - 15 minutes our orders finally made it out. The food was excellent! The bartender even comped us a couple of drinks. The problem was I was stressed by then and did not really enjoy what should have been a relaxing brunch at the end of a stressful week for both of us. Both bartenders were friendly at the very end when they knew it was time to write the tip, but since they had pretty much ignored us the entire time I felt it was merely perfunctory.

It is enough for a big guy and enough for light eater to share a plate.   Lobster meat is sweet with right balance of tender/chewiness which gave the sandwich a great bite.   It seem like they put a whole lobster on to the sandwich!   Scallop was good size and tender sweet and very nicely presented for a great photo!  Friendly staff who is quick to help and proactive.  Appetizer octopus was good.   Great balance of sauce and grilled to tenderness (not chewy). \\n\\nCons:  Tiny restaurant and can be a bit sticky.  My chair was sticky and couldn't put my leg against the side of the chair.   Local MA oyster that we got was just ok, not best value for the price.

I also recommend ordering a side dish of the raita. (The cool yogurt-cucumber condiment/side dish.) I usually drizzle this all over my indian food and it provides a nice contrast. (I have no idea if this is the way real Indians use this side dish, but if it works for me and makes me happy, I will keep on doing it!).

And the Lobsta Roll certainly is what Bostons LOVE. This is it, this is what everyone hypes about and do I hate giving into the hypes, but hey, we only live once, why not give it a shot? So, after grabbing amazing pastries at Modern Pastry and Mike's Pastry, we headed over for lunch at Neptune Oyster... and boy is this place tiny. And I mean, tiny. It is literally a one person walkway with a row of booth seating at your left hand side and about 15 bar seats to your right hand side. And directly infront of you is the kitchen and a small restroom. Okay, so this place was already packed on a Sunday afternoon at 11:30am. Figured. Nonetheless, we were here and we were ready for some lobsta. The one waiter holding down the fort of 10+ people at the entry way, squeezing side by side, was able to take down our names and phone number for our small party. The wait was going to be an hour and a half and that he'd give us a call once our table was ready. So definitely plan somethng to do within that time. We went to see Paul Revere's house (2 minute walk). Surely enough, after exploring the Paul Revere house two streets down and around the corner, an hour and a half passed and our phone call drew us back out into the 23 degrees F boston air and into the warm Neptune Oyster abode.\\n\\nObviously, it was a given that we came for the hot, buttered Lobster roll $27 that everyone has been raving about. Man, was the lobsta and buttered roll so freaking delicious. Gracious chunks of lobster meat, lean, tossed in a light mayo dressing, and wrapped in a hot, buttered, toasted pillowly bread. Yeah, it was good. The french fries were just as amazing, though a bit salty, but so devilish good. Hot and crispy on the outside and cotton soft on the inside. We also ordered the large North End Cioppino $25. And, honestly, I thought the North End Cioppino stole the show with the flavorful seafood broth and generous amounts of seafood (mussels, shrimp, scallops, etc) drenched over delicious saffron rice. My spoon just kept going for more and more. It was 1000x more delicious than any Ciopponi I've ever had in San Fran. So, all I've really got to say is, if you're in North End with enough time on your hands, you've got to try Neptune Oyster's lobster roll and cioppino. Its a must.

This was probably my least favorite of the five courses, but that's simply because I'm not a huge scallop fan. My boyfriend has a bivalve allergy so they made him the same dish but with beets instead.\\n\\nNext course was hen of the woods mushrooms with shaved kohlrabi - this was excellent. The flavors and textures were just incredible.\\n\\nThird we had the squash canneloni with some sort of cheese puree. Definitely my favorite of the five courses. The portion was quite small (just two small stuffed pastas) and I could have eaten twelve more plates of this, but alas, that's not how it works.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the foie gras supplement. He said it was just okay. It came with figs and cocoa brioche and he found the combination a little weird. \\n\\nThe main course was a beef dish, not usually what I choose to order on menus but it was perfectly cooked. Two decent size pieces of beef, great flavor and tender.\\n\\nDessert was a white chocolate cremeaux with some sort of devil's food cake, a buckwheat tuile and huckleberry compote. I loved this. The chocolate devil's food part was kind of dry, but the other flavors were really great together.\\n\\nThe homemade carraway bread and salted butter was also wonderful. The two of us ate all 6 slices.\\n\\nI found the service and atmosphere to be great a well. The only major complaint I'd share is that they do not have a single reasonably priced glass of wine on the menu. The cheapest red was $15, which seems quite steep to me. However, the waitress spilled a bit of my wine when pouring and as a result gave me almost an entire second glass for free, so I don't feel like I got ripped off paying $15 for the quantity of wine I consumed."},{"name":"Narcoossee's","address":"4401 Grand","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Narcoossee's is my dad's favorite Disney restaurant.

ALWAYS. We sit there forever and the gate doesn't go up... or a mean security guard starts yelling at us through the speaker until we explain we're there for dinner. This last time, on the evening of 10/17/10, a female guard yelled at us through the speaker that we were parking in a Cast Member portion of the lot, even though there was no signage that indicated that it was a Cast Member section. We were simply guests who had made a mistake and were not even arguing with the guard, who took it upon herself to make us feel like idiots. I understand there are probably a lot of guests that use and abuse that lot as free parking for Magic Kingdom, but I wish there was a most respectful way to handle the parking situation, considering the Grand Floridian is such a classy establishment.\\n\\nOverall, Narcoosse's is a very pleasant, but pricey, dining experience.

This is the same shopping center that houses a Fuddruckers, IZBA Crepes & Grill, Uncle Vito's NY Pizza, Red Elephant Thai Restaurant, and the recently-defunct Hashiguchi Sushi Bar.  With so many restaurants and other retail businesses, the parking lot for this development fills up quickly.  Not only that, but the spaces are small.  Luckily, there's plenty of parking in the back, which many people don't take advantage of.\\n\\nI went to Barkers' grand opening years ago and while the hot dogs were good, my coworkers and I weren't floored.  I revisited recently for lunch and the store was busy.  The restaurant reached seating capacity and newcomers had to get their orders to go.\\n\\nBarkers makes decent hot dogs and sausages, but they're priced a little high for what you get.  For example, I ordered a smoked Polish sausage and a chili-slaw dog.  At lunch, these two items alone totaled almost ten bucks (no drink or sides).  These are hot dogs we're talking about here.  Two regular size dogs should fill most people up.  They also have sides (fries, onion rings, salads, etc.) which you order a la carte.\\n\\nAll Barkers' dogs are cooked-to-order, usually by the owner himself, on top of a charcoal grill.  He's got an open kitchen, so you can watch your dogs being cooked if you want.  When your dogs are ready, you let the employees know what toppings you want.  I had horseradish mustard and sauerkraut put on my Polish sausage and it was good.  This was a store recommendation.\\n\\nI like how the dogs are cooked-to-order, though there's a bit of a wait for them.  Both the hot dog and the Polish sausage had a firmer texture and \\"snap\\" when I bit into them.  The links were plump, hearty, and had a nice smoky flavor from being cooked over charcoal.\\n\\nPretty much everything except the napkins are kept behind the counter.  This includes forks, spoons, cups, and the fountain drinks.  If you need anything, you have to go to the front and ask for it.  This is a little annoying since most casual joints like this have these types of things self-serve.\\n\\nNote:  Barkers is open Monday through Saturday and is closed Sundays.  They've been closing early (3pm) each day because of the extreme heat, although I don't understand why since they have air conditioning."},{"name":"Solly's Bagelry","address":"368 W 7th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Cool homely neighborhood spot , great Jewish pastries and bagels, but not great service.

But making me go outside and then call and stare at you while you answer my call and take my order and then bring my order out the front door is the most ridiculous thing ever. I order pizza seriously at least twice a week. And in college park there are 6 pizza places. So you have shown me that there aren't 6 places there are only 5.

For those not so well-versed in barbecue, KC is one of those places that prides itself on its own particular kind of barbecue. And that's probably the kind that I prefer. I have also eaten excellent ribs in Memphis, in St. Louis, in Alabama and while living in Texas, but KC is my preferred style. And also the one style not on the menu at Redbones.\\n\\nBut other than that, Redbones is good. Their St Louis style ribs are excellent, and I fully recommend trying their sausage. The catfingers are tasty, and encouraged me to try other (fried) fish options the next time we go. The only disappointment I have in Redbones was their fried okra. It was boring. And soggy. And so not worth the calories, and that annoyed me. So basically, don't go to Redbones if you're in the mood for a vegetable. Go when feeling entirely carnivorous and iron-starved, and you will leave feeling great. Or at least overly full, which is probably ok. And though your wait will be longer with a larger group, it's also fun to go there with three or four others, and order some of the larger combos. You can try different varieties of ribs and smoked meats (their pulled pork is pretty tasty), and you'll still be guaranteed to get enough food.\\n\\nThe margaritas are decent, if a tad sweet, and the beer selection is pretty great. It tends to be very busy on weekend nights, but I fully recommend going down to the bar for a drink while you wait, and if you aren't opposed, you can often find a seat in the bar where you can eat much faster. You'll be in close quarters, but sometimes the wait is long enough that that seems worth it."},{"name":"Denny's","address":"11037 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Best service ever!

The menu is big enough to where you don't get bored, and the prices are reasonable (for g-free food).  Good side items too.  I recommend the mac 'n cheese and the green beans with bacon.\\nThey make three of their own breads (french, sourdough, and focaccia) that you can purchase and take home.  All freeze beautifully.  They also have a variety of desserts (cupcakes, cakes, pastries, etc.).\\nEveryone who works there has always been very nice.  Since they do so much food prep after you place your order, it's not a place to go grab quick food (unless you call ahead).  It doesn't take a looong time, just not super quick (which I prefer because the time they take to cook contributes to the great flavor).  Even though my boyfriend doesn't eat g-free, he likes to go here and has never had anything on the menu he doesn't like.  He will even order a burger or sandwich with the g-free bread (which says a lot about the bread).\\n\\nThere's a parking garage attached to the building, so parking is not an issue.\\n\\nMy only wish for Wild Wood?!

As a tip - you can add black or red beans to your rice without having to add a 3rd side, which is nice.  As for the other sides, they've got all the 'standard' offerings of a Latin food place, and if they happen to have empanadas that day, do yourself a favor and get one.   \\n\\nAmazonas is the kind of place where you order at the counter, get your food and pay, then grab your table.

The tacos were tasty with a bit of cheese (queso asadero) and a supposed chipotle horseradish aioli which was not chipotle nor horseradish enough for me.  The beef was tender and delightfully seasoned, so the overall effect was OK, but even the side of habanero aioli I asked for lacked seasoning punch.

I ordered a lobster roll and a platter of oysters. The lobster roll came out first steaming hot. Just the smell alone was amazing. And I came to this restaurant AFTER I had already had 3 pieces of pizza. When I took a bite of the lobster roll I suddenly felt hungry for lobster. It was buttered perfectly and the bread was great to. After I thought it couldn't get any better they brought out the oysters. Now I don't particularly eat oysters that much but I thought I would try some. These were by FAR the best oysters I had ever tasted. I gulped down every single one.

The one at Flour is the best (the ingredients change often, look at their board for the quiche of the day). I have tried quiches at Thinking Cup and Tatte, but Flour gets it spot on always. The texture may be too soft at times, but I prefer it that way rather than it being dry and tough.\\n\\nAnd as the line moves along, the dessert section comes into view. Oh. My. God. It all looks delicious. My favorites are the sticky bun, sticky bread pudding and the hazelnut-almond dacquoise. Their key lime pie and yogurt parfait were a little too tart for my liking. The kouign amaan is tasty but sticky - the kind that gets stuck in your teeth (don't want to order it before a business meeting!).\\n\\nTheir customer service is excellent too. One time, I ordered a bunch of desserts to go and after reaching home, I realized they forgot to pack one of them but billed me for it.

This was understandable, that is until it took at least 30 minutes to get our food after ordering; mind you this was on a week night when it was not very crowded. Eventually, I had to signal to the waitress who promptly ran to the kitchen and brought out our food. It must have been sitting under heat lamps for at least 10 minutes. The food was good, but barely over lukewarm and the potatoes were way overdone, as if the heat lamp had continued to cook them. Moreover, another waiter had to come over and ask us if we wanted more beer; the same waiter also served us the second round. Our waitress was no where to be seen until it was time to clear the table and deal with the bill. We also noticed several other tables who were waiting an unacceptable amount of time for their food. If I had been a first time customer, I would not return to American Craft based upon the mediocre service. However, out of all my times there, this was certainly the exception.

There were also two, whole corn on the cobs in the soup.  They should really rethink the logistics of this dish.  The crawfish were tiny, had so little meat; there was really no point in them being in the dish.  The broth was pretty good, but I was so annoyed by the shelled seafood, it didn't really matter.

It came with yukon gold mashed potato that was creamy, lemon garlic green beans that was buttery goodness, sweet honey butter mustard sauce. I don't normally like pork chop much but this one was enjoyable. My ribeye steak that was 36 day dry aged was a bit dry for my liking. It was too lean and therefore lacking the juice. I switched to the grilled rack of lamb that had a honey fennel glaze that came with  tuscan kale, roasted bone jus and yukon gold buttermilk mashed potatoes. You can't go wrong with the rack of lamb.

I finally found exactly what I was looking for.\\n\\nI'm not surprised it took me this long to find it, either.  While making tacos at home, I've realized that this relatively simple-sounding dish presents a challenging balancing act for a chef.  On the one hand, you can put practically anything you want on a taco.  But with that freedom comes an important restriction: The ingredients must all be in harmony with each other.  Given that you taste every ingredient in one bite, the harmony is crucial.  Clashing or overpowering flavors have ruined many a taco for me.\\n\\nThis is where Petiscos' talent shone.  Every choice of ingredient was perfect, not just for its own flavor, but because it enhanced the other ingredients' flavors.  Closely related to how they achieved harmony is through the texture of the meats.\\n\\nLet's break it down . . . \\n\\nI ordered two chicken tacos and two carne asada tacos.  The chicken tacos were topped with coleslaw, beets, and watercress.  The chicken itself was pulled but it was exactly the same as the finely fork-shredded chicken breast I make at home for enchiladas.  It was very lightly flavored and juicy.  If you're making tacos, you can slice the chicken, cube it like Chipotle does, or throw a whole tenderloin on a tortilla.  Whatever floats your boat.  But, in my opinion, taking a little extra time to boil and shred the chicken after it just finishes cooking exposes so much more surface area to the seasonings or sauces you will use later.  As with Petiscos' chicken taco, it just makes for a much more flavorful, and much less chewy, final product.  \\n\\nNow think for a minute about how the ingredients work together.  Chicken tacos need a lightness about them but the relatively bland taste of chicken breast needs something to help it along.  Coleslaw is both light in nature and adds a creamy fat taste to add moisture and weight.  In addition to the meats, every taco needs at least a crunch and a fresh herb to tie it all together.  I use onions and chopped cilantro in most cases.  Petiscos' beets provided both crunch and freshness and the watercress (stroke of genius) added another light, but fresh, herby flavor to add both the starting flourish and a finishing touch.  Cilantro would have been out of place.  It takes a skilled cook to be able to choose such unorthodox ingredients and make them get along so well.\\n\\nThe carne in the carne asada tasted like it had spent hours in a lime-dominant marinade.  It was cooked perfectly and when I bit into it, it oozed natural juices and brightened the bite with that zesty lime flavor.  Perfect.  Unlike the chicken, the carne was cut into cubes, like you would find at Chipotle.  Naturally, you have the option of creating barbacoa but carne asadas are traditionally thicker pieces or cubes.  As much as I love barbacoa, I like my carne slightly thick so I can chew on that meat a little before swallowing.  \\n\\nOn top of the beef came a three chili sauce, pickled onions, serrano pepper, and radish.  Remember the necessity for crunch?  That honor went to the radish.  But unlike the chicken tacos, carne asadas traditionally give you the opportunity for presenting a much bolder flavor profile.  There was a lime tang in the beef, a touch of heat in the chili sauce, a pungent tang in the radish, and another dimension of pungency in the pickled onions.\\n\\nIt's like the cook realized how much freedom he had to be in-your-face with the carne asada and absolutely went to town with it.  He used three different varieties of pungent and tangy and made them all sing in harmony.  Mere words can't express how amazing it is to bite into the carne asada and enjoy the first blast of flavor, let alone chew the food and release even MORE flavor afterwards.  If the pungency ever got out of hand, there was a large slice of creamy avocado on each taco to mellow it all out.\\n\\nThis was a delivery order, by the way, delivered by the happiest delivery driver I've ever met.  (Little wonder if his employer is feeding him).  I can't imagine how fresh this stuff tastes at the restaurant.  Not only did I put down the box smiling from ear to ear, but I learned a lot about thinking out of the box with taco toppings.  I might have to start frequenting shelves at Star Market other than the ones containing cilantro and poblanos."},{"name":"Bubor Cha Cha","address":"45 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"We haven't been here in quite a few years and it seemed like they have changed their menu.

The meals came out at different times and with white toast instead of wheat and no ketchup for the home fries. We were finally able to get our server's attention to get some ketchup but it was too late to get the toast right. My husband had to ask another server to refill his coffee because ours didn't offer and when we did ask her to, she still never got around to it. The simple syrup never came. Half way through the meal we asked about the simple syrup for the iced tea which we ordered prior to placing our food order.  The server told us the kitchen got too busy so they can't make it. Had we not asked, we'd not have known. We then asked to change the untouched tea to apple juice. When the check came there was a charge for the apple juice AND the $2.75 tea. We asked the server to take that off as we only ordered it because we were promised syrup.  The total bill was $88 plus by the way.

If you decide to go to breakfast on a weekend, you may want to consider 'pre-gaming' it with a banana or some toast because it is very likely it will turn into brunch. I didn't pay too much attention to how long the three of us waited but it was a good hour in half before we were seated. \\n\\nSaying Portland dwellers are breakfast people is an understatement, easy. It was nice Jam offered a complimentary coffee station with little mugs, unfortunately I didn't discover it until later and thought everyone waiting around happen to bring theirs along from home...again another Portland thing I have seen quite often. \\n\\nThe inside is very unique; big windows allows for an abundance of natural lighting. A large mirror stands above the bar and it's fun to watch all the action behind the counter. I ordered the Curry Tofu Scrabble and I didn't care too much for it because it was way over-salted and had a ton of raisins. It looked like three little Sunmaid raisin boxes exploded on my plate. The best part was actually the hash browns and the squeezable jab in a bottle, no need to fuss with a knife.\\n\\nPrice to portions wise everything is a great deal, just be careful what you order.

My husband is a big fan of the sticky buns *when they're fresh* but often they're dry and hard and you wonder how long they've been sitting in the tray. I usually get a bagel, the lox and cream cheese with capers, onions, and lemons is delicious and comes with a side of ripple chips and a pickle spear. I also really enjoy the bagel and cream cheese schmears, and Solly's doesn't skimp on the cream cheese which makes me really happy (I don't think there can ever be too much cream cheese). The eggels are also really good. \\n\\nThe service is the main reason for the lower rating. Every time we come to Solly's the entire staff is new. It makes me wonder what the management is like at this place, to end up with such incredibly high turnover. The staff are also unfriendly and unhelpful for the most part. It's rare to get a smile, and they are extremely slow even when there are more people behind the counter than there are customers. \\n\\nFor example, yesterday I ordered a schmear. The girl behind the counter took down my name and gave us a placard to take back to our table to wait for our order. We waited, and waited, and waited. The place was dead when we ordered, so I couldn't understand how it could take that long to toast a bagel and put some cream cheese on it. Finally, after my husband had finished his sticky bun and coffee, he went to the counter to ask. He saw my order just sitting on the counter, and asked someone if this was the smoked salmon schmear we ordered. He asked her twice and got soundly ignored, so he just took it. It was tasty, but the abysmal service really doesn't suit the \\"mom and pop shop\\" vibe that Solly's is supposed to embody."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Good food, but overly priced.

I use the term \\"Mexican food\\" loosely because after my first few bites, I swore the flavor profiles of some items -- like the rice or house salsa -- tasted more Cuban or Caribbean than South of the Border.  That wasn't just my opinion either, an authentic Mexican in my dinner party agreed with me, too.  HOWEVER, the menu does offer a few redeeming drop-dead delicious dishes that I would definitely return to enjoy (like, for example, the fried oyster tacos or their \\"bocaditos\\").\\n\\nThus, my recommendation to anyone who decides to eat here:  avoid the combo platters which pair the tacos with the traditional Tex-Mex serving of rice & beans.  The beans have an odd texture, color, and unpalatable flavor, and a tinge of insipid rice lingers on your tongue long after you swallow.  It's almost like they just threw these sides together, or added them to appease white folk who expect a serving with every \\"Mexican\\" meal.  Instead, opt to get an appetizer, salad, or  \\"bocadito,\\" then buy any tacos you want individually √† la carte.  Mixing and matching like this won't even cost that much more than it would to buy the pre-packed taco plate in the first place, maybe a $5 difference, and the extra money you spend will save you some major dissatisfaction later on when you leave.  \\n\\nAlso, the drinks here really underwellmed me, even for a downtown location.  Wayyyy overpriced, esp. when you compare the size and quality to other restaurants in the immediate vicinity.  Overall, not bad if you just want to have one or two drinks with supper to whet your appetite before bar-hopping downtown, but definitely not a place I would purposely go just to get a margarita & socialize with friends.\\n\\nOne Yelper considered this place \\"upscale.\\" But a more appropriate term is \\"hipster.\\"  Although the atmosphere & ambiance achieve their goal and create a superficial affluent setting for the 30-something year old clientele, the real proof of \\"upscale\\" always returns to the the price & quality of the food ... and for the most part the standards for both are pretty low here.  They don't even make the guacamole table side like one expects in an \\"upscale\\" place that serves a more contemporary or extravagantly expensive Mexican cuisine.  Perhaps they would have been better to classify themselves as a Criollo cantina which would have given them a more poetic license to offer their exotic & eclectic specialties without confining them to limit their presentation and execution as \\"Mexican.\\""},{"name":"Short Bus Subs","address":"4209 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Food and service was great.

However, yesterday's experience was sorely lacking, with broken health code violations to spare.\\n\\nAt 5 pm on August 14th (if any owners or managers of The Park read this, I urge you to please check your schedules and see who these staff members were), my S.O. and I showed up for drinks and food. The evening started off with another guest, a woman who was either mentally ill or on some pretty intense drugs (I'm not being facetious, there was something truly wrong with her), causing a disruption on the patio. She stood near another guest and kept yelling at him that his dog was staring at her. He kept responding that it was not his dog, and to leave him alone. (There aren't many ways to respond to someone yelling at you to stop a random dog from staring at them.) Then she walked over to a wall and began conversing with it agitatedly (you can't make this stuff up, people). After her conversation with the wall, this guest came back and again began accusing the same man of, I suppose, allowing a dog to stare at her.\\n\\nOne would suppose that at some point management would come over and ask the disruptive guest to leave, but instead the wait staff gathered around her and were talking to her, they seemed to know her. The staff themselves all looked like they hadn't slept (or showered) in days, and spent most of our visit standing in a group off to the side talking to each other, instead of doing their jobs.\\n\\nA busboy went around, collecting dishes and clearing tables, and then immdiately dug his dirty hands into the container of garnishes at the bar, pulling out orange slices and eating them, and proclaiming for all to hear, \\"I'm not even supposed to be up here!\\" \\n\\nWe had already ordered food, unfortunately, and when it came out, there was a long hair draped across our plate. We told the bartender, who went and got someone (I would assume a manager or shift leader). The man who came out kept asking us what we wanted him to do about the hair. \\"What's wrong, you don't like it?\\" (the food, I presume, not the hair). We told him that we just wanted to let him know it was there, and he responded, \\"So, are you trying to get me to take it off your bill?\\" I assume that most restaurants have a policy in place for what to do when there is a hair in someone's food, instead of having the guest decide how a manager should handle it. We reiterated that we were just letting him know, and in the end we weren't charged for it.\\n\\nAll in all, the place was a train wreck yesterday, and no one was willing or able to do anything about it."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"TL;DR: Go to Neptune Oyster and leave your name and phone number with the hostess.

There are maybe 10-15 tables downstairs, a nice big beautiful copper topped bar, and a beautiful balcony with about 6 tables. It is big enough that I don't think you would NEED a reservation Sunday-Thursday, but I would call ahead for Friday/Saturday just in case. The decor is not nearly as over the top/kitschy/eclectic as Le Pig, and it feels very grown up and cute. Romantic. French bistro. It feels accessible and inviting.

The jelly was also spectacular.\\n\\nThe burger was as delicious as the one at Le Pig, but a little different.

Clam chowdah and seafood--yes. But pulled pork and brisket--ehh maybe? Located in Davis square, this place is off the main drag. When you stroll around you'll see some very crunchy places, which makes a bbq joint seem out of place. The sign is old and rustic- a true sign of no frills bbq. The checkered tablecloths were a very nice touch. The beer selection is fantastic as well. We ordered hush puppies and corn fritters to start. The hush puppies were great! Cooked to perfection. The corn fritters were served in a maple syrup sauce which was a nice compliment. \\n\\nNow - the BBQ. Decided to go with the brisket sandwich. Came with two sides so I had mac and cheese and potato salad. They put sauces on the table, but I wanted to try it without any sauce. First bite was amazing! Extremely tender and moist. The outside was charred to perfectly and I could take the smoke. I was quite impressed! I added some BBQ sauce which complimented the beef very nicely. My friend ordered the St. Louis style ribs. I tried one and it was a bit dry, but nonetheless very very tasty. The char on the outside was exactly right. \\n\\nIf you're looking for southern style BBQ... This place has got it!

We also ordered a \\"Reggie Deluxe\\" which had an egg, fried chicken, bacon, and cheese topped with gravy. And of course we also ordered \\"The Moneyball\\" which was a biscuits and gravy with an egg. \\n\\nThe biscuits are soft and moist. They also maintain their integrity when you bite or cut into them. They don't break up too much like biscuits are known to do. They have multiple types of gravy on the menu but I believe we had sausage gravy on our biscuits. The gravy taste sawmill style and was a little sweet for my taste but it brought the other ingredients together nicely. A surprising ingredient was the apple butter which really complimented the chicken and bacon on the Chatfield biscuit. \\n\\nThe biscuits are what make the meal.

Flying Saucer Pizza is a Sci-Fi themed pizza shop and although i was hoping for an out of this world experience, what i was got was a bit more down to earth.  When we arrived the place was full and we literally got the last two seats in near the bar.  Along the walls are lots of portraits of famous Science Fiction Characters. Perhaps a little bit cheesy but when you're at a pizza place I guess some cheese is good. To start our meal I ordered myself a drink. I don't actually remember the name of it, but I was hoping for something resembling a Mojito...what I got was perhaps the worst alcoholic beverage i have ever tasted...kinda like a mix of NyQuil, Toothpaste, Pepsi, Seltzer Water and Mint. I tried with all the Galactic powers I could muster but I could not finish it. Thankfully, the pizza arrived. We decided to order the Nick Fury (probably named after someone semi famous). It came with a white sauce topped with Mac and Cheese, Buffalo Chicken Tenders, three cheese blend, scallions, bacon, sriracha, and we added a ranch drizzle. You have your choice of fresh dough's here and we decided to do a beer dough.  The Pizza was good, the mac and cheese was creamy, the chicken was crispy and the hot sauce was just the right amount of heat. The Ranch was homemade with a heavy dill flavor which i really liked.  Even though I could see it, I honestly could not taste the bacon at all on the pizza and there was a bit to many scallions on it which overpowered the other flavors a bit. The dough was also cooked to a nice crispiness on the bottom but was a tad on the dry side.

That is what the sugar brioche did to me.  It literally took me back 20 years to winter days when I got to go to work with my mom since school was called off for snow.  As a treat and incentive to behave, she always took us to a little bakery and I got the sugar brioche.

Location. Location. And what a location for this \\"bistro\\". Off the affluent Park Avenue in Winter Park and tucked in an alley reminiscent of Southern France and Italy. A beautiful little nook.\\n\\nHowever, that's as far as the \\"bistro\\" moniker goes. And, I have to admit, this kind of ticks me off. This is a restaurant. Not a bistro. You can dress up the pig but it's still just a pig. Just because it's named a \\"bistro\\" doesn't make it one and, in my opinion, is an insult originating from the marketing team aimed directly at an ignorant public.\\n\\nBistros are small, smell like garlic and coffee, serve exquisite pastries and bring carafes of wine with baguettes and olive oil. They also offer fresh ingredients with local flavor and entr√©es which speak to the region. None of which are present here.\\n\\nThis restaurant seems to have an identity crisis. Creole? Island? New age pan-American? Trailer-trash chic? Whatever it is, it isn't American (traditional). And there is certainly nothing French or Italian about it.\\n\\nI ordered the conch fritters as an appetizer. Yeah, Conch fritters. At a \\"bistro\\".\\n \\nRight.\\n \\nBut I did so because I haven't had Conch in a while. I also went ahead and ordered the Conch burger because I was intrigued, with a side of orzo pasta salad and a spicy bloody Mary. My guest ordered a filet mignon sandwich with fries.\\n\\nBloody Marys have become something of a predictive metric to me, and I wouldn't know till later how accurate this one was. While it had flavor, it was certainly not spicy, but I was informed I could increase the heat by shaking one of the table offerings in it. In other words; if I wanted flavor, I'd have to do it myself.\\n\\nSuch was the case with everything that followed. In fact, If I wanted to get my entr√©e in a timely manner I should have gone into the kitchen and made it myself. But, first things first.\\n\\nThe conch fritters were floppy and not well bound. I know some people may like it like this but Fritters shouldn't fall apart when held sideways -as these did. I don't care if it's the Chef's \\"take\\" on it or not. Fritters are not floppers! Call them something else or get the recipe right. No lemon was supplied, shredded lettuce just to make the plate look big, and the cocktail sauce was nothing special- perhaps even store bought.\\n\\nI could tell the Chef was not interested in delivering a little thing called flavor because, while the seasoning was well balanced, it was balanced to the conservative (lowest common denominator) side. It's as if the chef was afraid to venture beyond the safety of old-person's food. Yet one look at the menu would tell you flavor SHOULD be included!\\n\\nThis didn't bode well for the Conch burger, but I figured I'd wait before jumping to any conclusion. So we waited. And waited. And FRICKIN waited. It was 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon and it took the kitchen 35 minutes for our order?\\n\\nCome ON!\\n\\nI was just about to ask for the check, when the food arrived with apologies, but a hollow excuse.\\n\\nThe Conch burger was simply a larger fritter put on a bun with a tomato slice and shredded lettuce. The bun wasn't even warm, and the remoulade was tasteless and runny when I would have preferred the store-bought cocktail sauce (if given the option). \\n\\nHowever, the orzo pasta salad was very nice and the French fries were hot and didn't look or taste bagged either. The slices of cucumber in the salad, touch of lemon and perfect preparation of the orzo itself made me think one thing; the sous chef or prep cook needs to leave this place before they too sell their souls to the commercial land of flavorless foodage, or have their passion beaten out of them by a Chef who obviously has lost their palate and desire to find it again.\\n\\nWhen I asked about the filet mignon sandwich my guest shrugged and made a \\"meh\\" face. \\"The sauce is pretty good\\".\\n\\nWell, there you have it. The sides and my guests sauce were good. The fritters and burger were floppy and dangerously close to bland. So, as my Bloody Mary metric seems to hold true; if I wanted flavor I should have done it myself.\\n\\nFor the inexcusable amount of time, for the unremarkable, almost insulting food, for the pretentiousness of this \\"bistro\\" I can't bring myself to give it anything higher than a two."},{"name":"Muchas Gracias","address":"11500 NE 76th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"New to the area and live close to here so I thought I would try it out!

Bored and watching TV, I suddenly had a craving for soup, more specifically, clam chowdaaaaah. I attempted to remember when the last time I had it was and that was at the end of October in Boston at Neptune's. So I started to reminisce about experience there...(insert dream ripples and harp music...)\\n\\nI walked into the restaurant, the place was small and crowded. Few gentlemen in suits in front of me and I was worried I wouldn't be able to get seated in time since I had about an hour to eat before I needed to get a cab back to Logan to fly back to California. Hostess approached me and said she had a bar seat available and a big smile formed on my face. I sat down at the bar and looked at the numerous selection of oysters in ice at the oyster bar. Looked over the menu, but really i already had in mind on what I wanted to order based on friends' recommendations.\\n\\nSummerside Oysters, New England style clam chowder, and the lobster roll with hot butter.\\n\\nOysters came out first, freshly shucked right in front of me. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/neptune-oyster-boston?select=lJ_1IlIJVK__briDJECSSA#lJ_1IlIJVK__briDJECSSA) I drizzled a little of lemon over all of them and slurped the first oyster in one quick gulp. Suddenly, Lionel Richie's Hello popped into my mind, why? \\"Hello, is it me you're looking for?\\" YES! YES IT IS! I've been looking for the perfect oyster and now that I've found you, I wanted to kiss/engulf you a thousand times! Golloped the next one with a dash of the red sauce and the sweetness of the sauce even brought out the sweetness of the oyster even more. A minute later, the whole dozen was gone and I didn't know what to do with myself, twitching already like a crack fiend in need of the next hit.\\n\\nLuckily, the chowder came out before I had to resort to prostituting my rotund body for more oyster money. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/neptune-oyster-boston?select=0G2iFDY672D4VI_RqZpyvw#0G2iFDY672D4VI_RqZpyvw) The chowder was amazing. It was light and the freshness of the ingredients just bursted in your mouth. Just a dash of pepper and that was all I needed to compliment the chowder. Clams were plentiful and you just know that these clams were from cold waters.\\n\\nFinished that in about a minute and a half, would've been faster had I just thrown caution and my tongue to the wind to just down the hot chowder. The last order took a while to come out, I kept looking at my watch and started to worry that I might have to bypass cannolis from Maria's and just head back to Logan (#FatKidProblems). But then suddenly...(this next part was all in slow motion).\\n\\nA sweet aroma caught my nose and my heard turned. I saw my server come out of the back kitchen holding a plate on a tray. I squint my beady little eyes and tried to make out what was on this place. I could actually see the buttery smell arising off the place and making a streamline arrow towards my nose. She is taking forever to walk along the L shaped bar counter towards my end. Then she plates it down in front of me and all at once the sweetness of the toasted soft roll, the large fat chunks of perfectly cooked red lobster tail, and the dripping hot butter attacked my nose and a pool of saliva formed in my mouth. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/neptune-oyster-boston?select=o69CZ5ikF8xlmc43a8BlTg#o69CZ5ikF8xlmc43a8BlTg) That picture does not do it one bit of justice nor will any of the meaningless words I have written or about to write. The roll was oh so toasty on the outside, perfect crunch at first, then followed by the soft sweet inside. Then I hit the barrier of rich, aromatic, hot butter and what glorious butter flavor it was. Finally the lobster meat: succulent, juicy, tender, hot, sickly, and ripe, it may my taste buds dance the Lambada, you know? The Forbidden Dance? Yes, the roll was in sync with my taste buds in a perfect harmony. It was beautiful and unfortunately ended too quickly.\\n\\nI looked down at the empty plate, tears building up in my eyes, and wanted to order more. However, my flight time was approaching and so I sent for the check. During the meantime, i devoured the delicious crunchy fries that came with my lobster roll. I thanked the server for delivering Heaven to me on a plate, bid adieu, and went off on my cannoli quest.\\n\\nNow I snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity. I'm in my cold house and yearning for Neptune's warm buttery lobster roll. Why do we have to be on opposite ends of the United States? Oh well, 'til next time our paths cross again. As for tonight, I will find you in my dreams once more oh sweet baby lobster Jesus."},{"name":"Halfway Cafe","address":"200 S Franklin St","city":"Holbrook","stars":"2.5","text":"The one and ONLY good thing about Halfway is it's bar.

You expect the Rat Pack to walk through the door at any moment. The low-light at Clyde's is tactile and envelopes you as the jazz wafts through the air.\\n\\nA guy walked up to our table and started talking to my eleven year old daughter who had just graduated from grade school. He was funny and ribbing her a bit. We all joined in the conversation and about five minutes later, the introductions came. His name was Clyde, the owner, wow...what a nice guy.\\n\\nWe had the New York Black & Bleu and the ribs. Both were excellent. We wanted a steak, so we opt'ed for the prime rib tips appetizer to see what the fuss was all about...most awesome. Clyde even comp'd a brownie hot fudge sunday for my daughters graduation...and it was great!\\n\\nIn the spirit of this being an old school steakhouse, it does lack the pretentiousness that many people seem to crave when they go out these days.

When we finally got the bartender's attention he told us to stand \\"right here\\" and the host would be with us when he got back.  When we were finally seated the host filled our waters and left us there.  By the time the server finally made it to our table we had decided on our wine, our appetizers, our entr√©es and had even googled tasting notes for the wine.  We told him that if he was ready we could give him our entire order.  He agreed and took our order.  He came back 5 minutes later to let us know that they had just 86d the meatballs we ordered.  No big deal.  He then came back a few minutes later to let us know that they were also out of the wine we ordered.  Whatever, we ordered a different bottle.  About 10 minutes later we finally receive our wine.  5 minutes later, here comes our appetizer... along with our entrees.  When we told the food runner he told us that it all came in on the same ticket and that we had to speak with our server!  By the time the server made it over to check on us we had finished the appetizer and the one entree that wasn't too cold to eat.  We asked him to heat up the hanger steak so we could finish our meal.  Now imagine how surprised we were when they actually heated up the same dish and brought it back to us.  It was now to well done to enjoy.  We asked for our tab and when it finally came the appetizer they had 86d was still on there.  We couldn't get anyone's attention to get it corrected.  When we saw our server getting ready to open a bottle of wine for the table next to us I decided enough was enough.  I left the table to go and find the manager.  When I finally found him I let him know what our experience was like and that all I wanted was to have our check corrected so we could leave.  He merely said that he had no support staff and that they were too busy because of scoutmob!

Now, when it comes to pie, any kind of pie, i take matters very seriously.  Key Lime is all about the consistency- firm, not too firm, definitely not that gelatinous, radioactive color and no weird soapy after taste that too much artificial lime can produce.  Blue Star gets it right with their effort and they give you a honking huge piece too (one slice was WAAAAAYYY enough for my old man and i to split).  I give this pie 4.5 stars with the improvement in the whipped topping, which could be a little more fresh.\\nAs for the Blue Star in general- great comfort food when you need it.  I go here to get meatloaf when i gotsta have meatloaf and don't feel like cooking it.  The lunch specials are traditional and well priced.

He did think one other might be better for oysters (B&G Oysters) but I was chasing the lobster roll dream.\\n\\nI started with four Island Creek oysters ($2.50 an oyster/ $10 total) and then the lobster roll ($25). Did I say something about this not being a fancy pants meal? Yeah, well, it was definitely getting there.\\n\\nHeck, the fish tacos here are $23! Pretty outrageous. Of course, once I got there, I was highly attracted to the idea of the sturgeon with lentils but no, I couldn't leave without that lobster roll.

And for those who have mentioned the prices are a bargain, well, it's simply not true.  Meat loaf -- or at least a meat loaf sandwich -- should not cost almost $10!  And the meat loaf plate is over $12.  Other items are equally overpriced, I feel.  They just aren't that good, either.\\n\\nService is good, although when we mentioned that the lights over our table were not turned on, we were told that they had burned out.

The toy area is up on a little raised platform with traffic cones surrounding it. There's a little bench next to it so you can sit while your little one plays.

Fresh oysters and yellowfin tuna and swordfish were had along with martini's and a great Tasmanian pinot noir. Service at the bar was attentive and exceptional. The seafood beats any other fish house in Boston hands down for freshness. Although the place is small and crowded, there was a great foodie vibe about the place - everyone here was grooving on the food. There are no reservations to be had here and if you come at a busy time, you will likely have to deal with the ad hoc system of getting a table since there is no host person handling the door.

With 45 minutes to kill, we went shopping at the cute boutiques in the area...the time flew by!\\n\\nI had the biscuit and gravy special--the biscuit was buttery and flaky on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. There was just the right amount of gravy, and the scrambled eggs, sausage and cheese tasted great. The grits were just ok--nothing spectacular. My friend had the pancakes and chicken sausage and was very happy. \\n\\nBig perk: you get muffins and a biscuit while you're waiting for your food! Our server was perky without being obnoxious and except for being a little slow to refill the coffee, she was great.

We had our choice of seating locations, and service was again great. Hot bread while we waited for our food, great wine recommendations. I got the flatbread with sausage and the mac and cheese--I could have made a meal with just the flatbread. The mac and cheese was good, but not spectacular. The bf got the meatloaf and it was fantastic! Moist, flavorful with a great sauce. I'd wanted to try dessert, but we were just too stuffed! Murphy's may become a go-to spot for me.\\n\\nUpdated update: holy moley, you have to try the Chicken Spinach Bacon Burger. It's heavenly.

Nice patio, big screen projector and tons of other screens, spacious, etc.\\n\\n-I have *on some occasions* received excellent customer service here.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n-This place is dirty. Literally every single time I've been here (half a dozen times so far) I've observed that the tables I've sat at could definitely use a good wipe. I saw this mentioned by another reviewer and a manager responding that it was cleaned nightly and had good scores from the health inspector. To that I would say that that has little bearing on the level of upkeep in the seating areas throughout the day, which is clearly unsatisfactory.\\n\\n-Service is inconsistent. As I mentioned, I have received great service here at times, but there have been other times that nobody has come to take a drink order for 20 minutes after I've been seated, or I've had to flag down staff in order to pay because they didn't come over to take payment for a significant amount of time after I was ready to leave.\\n\\nOne thing I want to mention is that I am not a sports fan and have never attended this location on a game night, so it's been relatively slow every time I've been here.

Nothing on the owner's part was done to meet the neighbors or build business relations. So there's that. \\n\\nI really wanted to love this place. I told people about the Mazagran, instagrammed it, asked about the furniture (which I can afford, but I will never give that much money to these people). \\n\\nWhen they first opened I let them know that I do website design and Internet marketing for small businesses, they basically ignored me.

Even though this place is well tucked away, the word is out and for a Friday night this place was almost at maximum capacity with patrons. That was a really good sign.

The Jungle Noodle, the Mr. gives it 5/5 star flavorful.  It was good. He ordered 2 star spice which was just right for the dish and his american palate spice level.  The tom yum fried rice , I was excited to try it because it was highly recommended by another Yelper. I expected to be more flavorful that what it was, but it was still good.  We added soy sauce to it and asked for extra lime wedges. It just wasn't exploding with flavor.  \\nThey don't have this listed on the online menu but they have Khao Soi. It is not spelled the exact same way but you know it is the Chiang mai Noodle  as per the Khow shy or suey menu listing. They serve it with the toppings, traditionally served on the side, already on it. (i.e. the shallots, fried noodles, pickled things.) They forgot to bring the lime but they were so busy so I asked for extra wedges later.  Missing was the chili paste. It was flavorful enough without it.  I asked for a spice of 4 but a S.E. Asian spice level as I can eat habenero peppers raw.  So it was still mild to medium to me. \\nStill good. I think that you can get a noodle option with this. I didn't order one so they served it with the rice noodle instead of the egg noodle that I am use to. I want to come here again and try more things.

Could barely get our 5 course meal without sitting for 3 hours. Now 3 hours wouldn't be bad for how Imperial Fez used to be because the entertainment was worth sitting that long. Last night we had one dancer who did not interact with crowd much, dance long, or make the occasion great as in the past. At one time you had to take shoes off before entering the main room for eating. Now they allow shoes so I had to endure the lady next to our table pulling shoes on and off with shoes just sitting next to us. Not worth the hundreds of dollars you will spend!!  Needs new management or something different to get it back to how it use to be.  Won't be a returning customer and will be spreading the word to friends.

The fish was flaky and freshly cooked. I feel like I'm describing a table service item. We also ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger. It was a basic burger, nothing special.

Given all the reviews that mentioned a long wait, I made sure to get there just before 6pm to avoid the dinner rush and was immediately seated in one of two remaining tables.\\n\\nWe started with a sampling of oysters from the raw bar, all of which were fresh and delicious. My boyfriend enjoyed the nutty finish of the Summersides so much that he ordered another two for himself. I ordered the blue crab cocktail, which was around $15-18 market price, expecting the usual not-too-little-but-not-generous Manhattan helping of lump crab with cocktail sauce on the side given the price. I was pleasantly surprised when the waiter delivered a heaping bowlful of crab meat, and was even more astounded by the flavor: amazingly fresh crab with a spicy kick of what I believe was horseradish. Just recalling the dish now, I'm salivating and lamenting the fact that I can't have it for lunch today.\\n\\nFor the entree, my boyfriend decided to try the vitello tonnato sandwich. The combination of tuna tartare, veal, and spicy mustard was intriguing on paper, and the sandwich itself did not disappoint - a single bite was an explosion of flavor so surprising, very different but incredibly delicious. I had the lobster roll hot with butter, as recommended by many of the reviews here on Yelp, and it was as flavorful and fulfilling as I imagined it would be. If there's one thing Boston does right, it's lobster, as no matter where I went during my trip, the lobster was always juicy, fresh, and well-cooked, and Neptune's lobster roll was no exception. I also appreciated that they weren't stingy with the lobster, as that seems to be a trend with a lot of places that serve lobster rolls.\\n\\nOverall I was very moved by my dinner there, so much so that I'm writing a wordy out-of-town Yelp review, which I rarely do. If I lived in Boston, there's no doubt I'd be a regular here, regardless of the wait. The next time I'm in town, Neptune will be one of my first stops. And maybe my second.

The sky was cloudy, the streets were a bit gray, and the only thing that sounded good to us was a long walk and the thought of good food and wine.  We went back after with a friend to celebrate her birthday, and were not disappointed.  Here is our tale.\\n\\nOf course, Neptune Oyster is centered on the raw bar.  Not only in what the name of the place alludes to, either: the raw bar IS, in fact, Neptune's window dressing.  That's right:  their rawbaristas are right in the window, facing the street, with oyster knife in hand and plenty of neatly labeled shellfish selections in front of them to pluck and pry open as the orders come in.  So, you'd figure it better be good right?  It is.\\n\\nShellfish \\n\\nOysters:  We started with a dozen oysters and four shrimp cocktail.  The oysters were excellent, as good as one will find in the city of Boston.  Plump, cold, and briny, these oysters were expertly opened, meaning every drop of their precious liquor remained, from opening to transport to their placement in front of us.  I can't tell Yelpers out there how many times I order oysters and wonder where that liquor has gone.  \\n\\nWith the oysters were the traditional accompaniments:  lemon wedges, ketchup and grated horseradish, and a mignonette.  Great suggestion from our waiter to take a few shallots from the mignonette to place on top of the oysters rather than sloshing mignonette into a given shell--it is vinegar after all and I find the sharp taste can drive a spike right through the delicate flavor of an oyster.  Much appreciated suggestion, Vinny.  \\n\\nShrimp:  Is there anything ever much to say about shrimp cocktail?  It's often bland, often tastes like the shrimp were defrosted that day, and one never knows which disgusting shrimp farm in Suriname or Florida or Thailand or Mexico produced what may be genetically modified animals.  Well, the shrimp were delicious at Neptune.  I didn't ask about their origin or if they were cooked in a fish stock or similar concoction, but they were incredibly plump, very flavorful, and totally satisfying.  If these shrimp were frozen once, and there's a good chance they were, they didn't taste it.  And if they did come from some shrimp farm somewhere, it was a good farm.\\n\\nApps and Entrees\\n\\nClam Chowder: really good.  If you like chowders you can stand your spoon up in, this chowder ain't for you.  If you like delicate, but very flavorful chowder, then you'll want to order this.  The chowder is made to order at Neptune, confirmed upon asking.  So, onions and celery presumably hit hot butter in a pan a few minutes before you get your bowl; clams are added; clam juice, maybe some lemon, a few chopped potatoes, and finished with some cream.  I'm not sure what else could be in there, but essentially this was a very clean, very flavorful, extremely enjoyable bowl of chowder.  Really fantastic.\\n\\nYellowtail Hamachi Tartar: excellent.  Clean, cut perfectly, and flavored wonderfully with kimchi, cucumber, lime, and sea salt.  Not overpowering at all.  Refreshing and utterly delectable.\\n\\n\\nLobster roll and fries:  Having eaten hundreds of lobster rolls between New York City and Bar Harbor Maine, I can happily say Neptune's is up there among the best.  Have it with mayo or with hot butter--either way, you'll be happy.  The brioche bun is sweet and buttery, the lobster perfectly cooked, and the accompanying fries are not to be left behind.  What else is there to say?  This is a dish that relies on ingredients.  The execution is important, but no variation in assembly will really affect your lobster roll enjoyment if the lobster is super-fresh and cooked perfectly.  End of story.  And go with the melted butter version...\\n\\nScallops with hazelnuts, blue cheese, and pomegranate: another great dish.  A little skimpy for $30, but really a great dish.  Scallops were perfectly cooked.  Flavor combinations excellent.  Execution spot-on.  \\n\\nWe'll be back to try the other entrees.  The grilled whole Branzino sounds great, as does the vitello tonato sandwich.  And there's more...\\n\\nService:  Casual, informative, fun.  They are not in your face and not aloof either.  They're right there with answers to your questions.  Knowledge of the wine list was good and recommendations were appreciated.\\n\\nGet yourself to Neptune Oyster.  \\n\\nFour stars."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I have waited over a year or so to eat here and when my soon to be Sister in law wanted to meet up for Easter I was excited!

I think I died and went to lobster roll heaven! It was soooooo delicious and all that I hoped it would be! (Thanks Leighann F. for the rec) But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's rewind. It was a dark, stormy Sunday night in Boston. The last thing I wanted to do was to go outside but since I was leaving Boston the next day, I knew Sunday dinner was my last chance to eat at Neptune Oyster. In a struggle between my mind and my stomach, my stomach won as it nearly always does. Hence the reason why I find it so hard to diet... but that's another topic for another time. My friend and I braved the heavy downpour and schedule changes in the T, and journeyed to the \\"best seafood restaurant in Boston.\\" The horrid weather turned out to be a blessing in disguise because the restaurant wasn't busy at dinnertime and there was almost no wait to be seated.\\n\\nNeptune Oyster could probably thrive by serving just their famous lobster rolls, but they also have an awesome, extensive raw bar. I love how the raw bar menu comes as a paper checklist with descriptions of the size, salt content, and finish of each type of oyster - descriptive enough to make anyone feel like an oyster pro. I was tempted to order one of each type of oyster but I restrained myself so that I would have tummy space for the coming lobster roll. We decided on an oyster each of the Wellfleet (MA), Summerside (PEI), and Kumamoto (WA) oysters. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y2w6rFaO0XEiG5mFfOsiFA?select=Be1zv40u4RUzcUU1TbCY6A They were all really fresh and a great appetizer before the Maine event...\\n\\n... the Maine Lobster Roll! I had it hot with butter instead of cold with mayo. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y2w6rFaO0XEiG5mFfOsiFA?select=SMtGg2WGYK8fXgvfJQWblw  The giant lobster roll was absolute perfection; the lobster meat was buttery, fresh, plump, juicy, drool-worthy... need I go on? The bread roll was toasty warm and somehow managed to hold in the mountain of lobster meat. It also comes with a side of tasty battered fries in case you still have room in your tummy after the lobster roll.\\n\\nNext time I visit Boston I want to give the cold mayo lobster roll at Neptune a try. But in the meantime, the hot butter lobster roll at Neptune is a serious contender for the \\"Last Meal on Earth\\" slot in my Yelp profile."},{"name":"Chago's Caribbean Cuisine","address":"7301 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We just moved to Houston (Mon√©t and Yoshi) from Hawaii, and decided take take a trip to Austin today, wow!!!

In fact, the restaurant wasn't nearly half full and we didn't really need an advance registration, but I didn't know better since it was our first trip. The service was just great - no complaints at all. The prices are exceptionally high and our menu selections were not that fabulous. I had the haddock. It was great until I got to the red sauce on top. My husband had the shrimp fettuccini which was just ok. My younger son had the flat iron steak and it was good, but my older son had a cheeseburger which was subpar to a Wendy's burger.

For 2 items ordered, the total unexpected overcharge was around $3. The manager did not bother to give an explanation. The bartender merely said they add $1 for takeout, but that's not what showed up on the bill. I'm pretty sure it is illegal for a restaurant to state one price on the online bill and then charge you a much higher price when you get there for the pick up.

And after a dry spell I usually make up my fried-food void @ Fried & True.  I love the their quality and diversity, the batter they use is excellent and their food never has that greasy or oily effect, it's always very crispy and delectable.  It's literally some of the best fried food I've ever had.   \\n\\nI've made my way down the menu, here's the low down: \\n\\n- Fried Oreos are da BOMB!  The best!  Not greasy, puffy and toasty and very tasty.  I even brought some into work to share w/ the compadres, and warmed them up in the toaster (perfect!).  They went nuts - -gone in 60 seconds.  \\n\\n- Corn Dog Combo was off the charts!  The corn dog was large marge, they use Nathan's Hot Dogs (the best!), and the batter is crispy and crunchy, not soft and greasy.  The fries were fantastic - - and they give you a boatload with the order.  Get the combo as it comes w/ a drink and saves you some dough.   \\n\\n- Fried Pickles:  the best damn fried pickles I've EVER had.  EVER!  It's not the thin sliced chips w/ cheap breading that falls off - oh no - these are hefty dill spears coated in the signature batter and fried golden brown.  Dipped in their ranch sauce it really hits the spot - - it's really the best as I am impressed.  \\n\\n- Fried Nutella + Marshmallow Sandwich - - holy smokes that was probably the most richest and decadent item I've had since I could remember.  You get the salty, crunchy, crispy, then savory and sweet all in one.  A great change of pace and I had leftovers the next day - just warmed it up in the toaster oven and it was good as new.  I was floored by this concoction.  \\n\\n- Chocolate Covered Bacon is the BEST!  Hands down!  Why?  It's all about the bacon and the execution I tell ya.  The bacon is thick and crispy and robust, not chewy or greasy, and it's a thick chocolate coating all over as it all comes together like a sweet-n-salty party in your mouth.  I'm telling you it's the best and I can't get enough of it - - they always sell out.  \\n\\n-  I fell in love with the Dublin Tart Lemonade - - oh my I can't get enough of that sweet n tart soft drink!  You can't have just one.  \\n\\nI missed out on the Fried Camembert but there's always something new on the menu to entice you.  I love (owner) Ariel's passion and creativity - - nothing is off limits as she tests the boundaries and everything she makes is high impact, quality good, and without any of that greasy after taste.  \\n\\nI think that's why I like them so much - - unique, game changing, quality food, flawless execution, and over-the-top friendly customer service.  Ariel and her husband are always a delight to talk to as they enjoy getting to know their customers and want to develop a relationship.  You show up and order and find yourself wrapped up in a friendly conversation, it's always a delightful visit.  And don't forget to bring your dog as Ariel doubles as a Dog Genealogist - - forget those high priced & unreliable Dog DNA tests, she's the Real McCoy with over a decade of experience.  \\n\\nYou show up with an empty stomach and a dog with an identify crisis and leave having experienced the best damn fried cuisine and knowing your canine's ancestry and breed!!

When it was finally our turn to be seated, they brought us over to the counter. The place is tiny, and very clean. That's awesome when there's seafood involved. The lobster roll can be served hot with drawn butter, or as a cold lobster salad with mayo. I went for the hot. Yummmmm. The fries were great, too.  Not that I needed them what with all of the lobster meat. You get what you pay for. I also opted for a bowl of the clam chowder--creamy and delicious. But also heavy with the lobster roll. My gluttonous meal had been preceded by a few snacks while I was waiting, so I wasn't able to finish all of my lobster roll. But I'll be back for more. The drink menu was also good because it had a nice selection of wines and beers. Plus, they have a whole slew of other items on the menu that I can't wait to try out. \\n\\nThe window display is pretty and features a lot of lemons. The blues and yellows complemented the space nicely and showcased their seafood well.  \\nal businesses."},{"name":"Scampo","address":"215 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This was one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had. Our bartender and waitress Lisa was as sharp as can be, remembered every detail and even anticipated our needs.\\n\\nOn Christmas Eve night my sister and I went for drinks and dinner. Lisa kept my sister's wine glass full (which is a blessing and a curse hahaha: hangover from hell). And when we jokingly commented that our order of oysters only had three (how do we share that?!) Lisa never even said a word, but a fourth oyster showed up minutes, maybe even seconds later. And over the course of our dinner, Lisa observed my sister getting emotional over having missed a recent milestone in my life, so she had the kitchen send out a complimentary plate of cookies with congratulations written in chocolate icing. \\n\\nThe service that night was above and beyond.

We met up with another couple and sat out on the patio. If it weren't for the nice weather outside and the pleasant company and conversation it would've been a real drag of a dinner. \\n\\nThe first drag was the service, while it was far from the worst I'd ever had it was definitely somewhere between ok and bad. It was in the last hour and a half or so of them being open and that might have affected it, but it's not like we walked in with a half hour to go and the place was ready to close or anything. Late guest treatment aside I also didn't feel confident that our waitress understood us even or was familiar with their own menu. She got three out of four orders right though.\\n\\nThe second drag was the food. Bland, as bland can be and dry to boot. I don't have ridiculously high standards for tex-mex food, moist and flavorful is all I ask; our food was neither. \\n\\nMy wife's carnitas somehow became beef cubes instead of pork; incredibly tough chewy flavorless beef cubes at that. My chicken quesadilla's only flavor came from the gooey melted cheese surrounding the dry pieces of cardboard masquerading as chicken. I will say my chile relleno was ok, but nothing to write home about. Some of the desserts looked tempting, but we opted to try Orange Leaf next door instead. \\n\\nBottom line: If you're looking for good tex-mex this isn't it, if you want to have a few margaritas after work though, you could do worse I suppose."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Bomb!!!!!

Where is the best place to get one? Neptune Oyster! BUT, if you're not ready to fork over some $$$ for delicious seafood, this might not be the spot for you. Honestly, Neptune's 4.5 star rating already speaks for itself. Patrons come from all over and line up very early in the afternoon to enjoy the delicious food Neptune has to offer. \\n\\nLOBSTAH ROLL\\nI was so excited to try seafood in Boston and see how it differed from seafood from the West Coast. A lot of my friends were raving about the delicious lobster roll here and I was definitely not disappointed. For $30, you can either get the lobster roll hot with butter or cold with mayo. Personally, you can't really go wrong with lobster and butter so I had to try it this way. It warmed my heart, I absolutely loved it. The lobster was sweet and they did not skimp on portions. The bun absorbed all that delicious buttery lobster flavor, it was awesome! It comes with fries, so very easy to share with one other person. \\n\\nSEAFOOD CIOPPINO\\nMy sister and I wanted something warm to help us out with the Boston cold winds, so we tried the Seafood Cioppino ($30). It came with mussels, local fish, salmon, shrimp and clams. Unlike other Cioppino that I've had, this was served with a bed of rice pilaf. It was just the thing we needed to warm ourselves after braving the cold for days. \\n\\nRAW BAR\\nThey call this place Neptune Oyster because they have great oysters available from all over. I honestly love West Coast oysters like Kusshis and Kumamotos, but since I'm visiting the East Coast, why not try some of theirs? I enjoyed the Well Fleet ($2.90) and Katama Bay ($2.90) oysters a lot, but I didn't get the \\"popcorn\\" finish they talked about. Still meaty, salty and fresh. Cherrystone Clams ($2.50) are also delicious, both sweet and meaty, they're some of my favorites as well. I saw a lot of pictures of their seafood cocktails and I was very interested in trying the Japanese Octopus. It was perfectly citrus-y, the octopus meat was sweet and it was from Japan. Awesome find, I'm so glad I got to eat it. This is really the perfect place for seafood lovers. \\n\\nSERVICE/WAIT\\nWe arrived on a Friday afternoon at 11am, 30 minutes before they opened. There was already a line forming outside and my sister and I hoped that we would be seated during the first round. Fortunately, when the doors opened and people slowly made their way in, there were two seats left at the bar. Those in line after me were told the wait was going to be anywhere between an hour to an hour and a half. We were so lucky! Service was great and I loved sitting at the bar because you were able to watch the servers shuck the oysters and prepare the raw bar options.\\n\\nI really can't rave enough about this place. I highly recommend it for those who are visiting Boston and passing by, or even to locals. Yes, it's expensive, but you're paying for high quality and fresh seafood, something you can't get very often. BALL OUT, drop extra moolah for that experience, it's really worth it.

I had the coq au vin, which was delicious if not just a hair underseasoned. The escargot and tartar was delicious and our server was attentive and thoroughly knew the menu and made some solid wine suggestions. My dad ended up getting the schnitzel (instead of the sweetbreads) which was a fantastic second choice and my mom got the rack of lamb which she said was the best she's had in a very long time.

Going in blind? How stressful! I decided to go with the Spanakopita (spinach pie). It came with a Greek salad. The salad dressing was nice and light, and the spinach itself was yummy. Having gone back several times (and trying other family member's dishes), I can also recommend the Stuffed Green Peppers, the Greek Style Lamb Chops, and the Baked Lamb is so soft, you don't need a knife to eat it!\\n\\nNow we have been waited on by the same lovely waitress every time, and she always remembers the three generations of my family (maybe it's because my father and grandfather look freakishly alike).

I arrived around 9pm on a Sunday night. The line was out the door. When you get there, check in with the hostess. Whenever I dine alone, I encounter friendlier service and this place was no exception. The hostess found me a seat at the bar as soon as something freed up, ahead of the other parties. \\n\\nSunday is fish tacos day, but by 9pm, they had run out of fish tacos. Sad face. I got an oyster card which lists all of the in-stock oysters, its origin, and description. I opted for 6 East Coast oysters from MA and PEI. I appreciated the descriptions; there wasn't an oyster that I didn't like! \\n\\nI got the lobster roll as my main. You can get it warm with butter or cold with mayo. I went with the warm because I often feel that places obscure the flavor or quantity of lobster with mayo. For $25, I don't think you can get a better lobster roll in NYC (and I know this is Boston, but unfortunately my lobster roll baseline is from NYC). The lightly toasted roll was brimming with big chunks of lobster. The fries on the side were also perfectly salted and in my opinion, the perfect consistency. \\n\\nI went again the following night, around 5:40pm. I really wanted to try the cold lobster roll, but ended up going with the special of the day, the lobster spaghettini ($36). For those of you who are worried about portion size, you can share with another person. Also, unlike most places, there are probably more chunks of lobster in here than spaghetti!

Sipping on $2 fresh blueberry lemonade and sweet tea makes the wait a lot better.  The owners, their son, and their niece were running the place.  Everyone was as friendly as could be.  All of the food looked tasty and fresh.  We ordered the Cruz Control sandwich (to share) and the corn puppies.  The Cruz Control sandwich was good but could have been improved upon.  The taste was mostly great-- the ham, bread, pickles, chipotle mayo-- delicious.  There were two problems though: the bread was overly greasy and there was too much pork (who the heck complains about too much pork?).  Really, less pork would have made for a more balanced sandwich.  I wanted to be able to taste the ham, pickles, etc.  Some bites were all pork.  And, if I'm being honest, the pork itself did not hold its own with regard to flavor.  So, I'm being nit picky, but I feel as if this sandwich could be a slam dunk with very minor improvements made.  The corn puppies were good, fresh, and hot.  The chipotle dip they were served with was the same one that came on our sandwich... so we had a lot of repetitive flavors (our fault).

Salmon was too dry to eat, probably having sat under heat lamps for too long.  It's a small dining room, so the staff must to be very talented to avoid eye contact with customers for such extended periods.  Most annoying:  service deserved 15% at best, but 17% tip was slipped in--then when the credit card slip arrived there was just the total and a line for gratuity like it hadn't been included.

Next door is a Thurman's To-Go option which alleviates that extended wait time, but I would recommend calling ahead and picking it up as opposed to walking in and ordering as your wait time will be a minimum of a half hour.

Their lobster roll is comprised of chilled lobster meat, lemon butter, Luke's secret seasoning, a dollop of mayo, and a hot toasty bun----- absolute perfection!!!\\nI also appreciate the protein to carbs ratio of their lobster roll. Their bun is basically just a small piece of toast, but it comes with whooping 1/4 lb of lobster meat! Mr A and I shared 3 lobster rolls and we didn't feel guilty for eating all of the bread at all:) \\nTheir lobster bisque was hearty and comforting. Even though it was on the creamier side of the spectrum, quite a lot of lobster meat was blended into it. \\n\\nP.S. Forget about spending an extra $5 on the lobster tail. Unlike the lobster meat in the lobster roll, the lobster tail was bland and not worth the $5 price tag in my opinion."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Had to wait about 3 hours on a Saturday night before getting a table. It was worth the wait. The place is not that big and it gets VERY crowded. I would suggest making reservations early (they don't take reservations over the phone) because they were turning people away at 8pm because their wait list was so long.\\n\\nWe ordered the hot lobster roll ($25) and comes with fries. The lobster roll was amazing ridiculous! The warm bun and sweet succulent lobster. I'd wait here for a table anytime! I'm usually a crab person, but this trip moved lobster right up there with Alaskan king crab! \\nThe raw bar was awesome too. They have a pretty large selection of different types of oysters. The oysters are shucked right behind the bar and if you're lucky enough to get a seat at the bar where they're shucking the oysters, it's something worth seeing. \\n\\nOysters that we tried included: Kumamoto, Kusshi, Katama Bay, Summerside and Bees River. All were good except for the Kusshi. It's supposed to have a cucumber flavor but it had a bitter aftertaste. The ranking for the oysters: Kumamoto, Summerside, Katama Bay, Bees River, and Kusshi. I really like the Kumamoto because it was small and plump and very creamy. Very delicious!\\n\\nAlthough we went to another place that had $1 oysters the night before, these oysters are fresh and range between $2.50-close to $3 per oyster. We were disappointed that they ran out of sea urchin. Being from Chicago, it would have been nice to try fresh sea urchin since we don't have the luxury of trying it fresh out here.

They're ranch dressing is amazing!!! But every time I've brought my hubby-guy, it's been mediocre at best. Why would you do this, The Park? I hear so many good things about your sister (brother? Are you a masculine restaurant?) restaurant up north.\\n\\nWhen HG and I went together for the first time, I can't remember the food itself, but I do remember feeling uncomfortable about some of the parts that I was eating, and remember picking around certain areas of the plate. I also remember HG not liking it as much as I did when I went for the first time, so when he recommended it a few nights ago, I was surprised! I was also starving and couldn't make it another mile down the road, so we chose The Park!\\n\\nJust as last time, it was loud on the patio, but only because the patrons were talking and apparently the restaurant wanted to be sure the music could be heard over the loud patrons. We got an order of Chips and 4 Dips (Yay happy hour prices!), I ordered the original Park burger (beef) with grilled broccoli, and Hubby-Guy ordered the same with chicken and a salad with ranch dressing.\\n\\nThe chips and salad came out around the same time. The chips and salsas were okay. The chips were crispy in their paper bag, and the guacamole was a little brown. The queso had a layer of skin on it, and the salsas tasted a little off. It looked like they had been plated earlier in the day and were just brought out because we ordered it. It wasn't as bad as my HG's salad! The bits of shredded red cabbage on top were dried out and brown, and the lettuce was coated in a thin layer of ranch, which was beginning to turn transparent. Just how long ago was this salad assembled? This was definitely NOT freshly tossed, and my worst fear was that it had been sent back once before.\\n\\nThe waitress exchanged it, telling us that it was fresh, but the cabbage just oxidizes fast...Yes, cabbage oxidizes, but not within 3 minutes of cutting it, which is what should have been happening instead of it sitting out in the open and drying out for who knows how long.\\n\\nThe burgers were good, but the \\"grilled\\" broccoli didn't look grilled and was served in a puddle of water that had black flecks in it. The broccoli itself tasted grilled but was hot in the middle of the dish and cold on the outside. MICROWAVED! Where's Gordon Ramsay when you need him!?\\n\\nI don't like the way they handle their food there; it's disgusting, and I still can't shake the feeling that they reuse and re-heat their food.

I ordered the Thurman Burger, which was much bigger than I expected. It had a burger patty about an inch thick with ham piled on top, with just about any toppings you can imagine smothered in cheese. The meat was a tiny bit underseasoned but it still tasted great along with everything else on it. I would definitely consider it the best burger I've had in a long time and would go back again.

Also for the mirrored glass on the doors in the ladies room; being able to see someone wash their hands while they couldn't see you pee was a little creepy at first, but a cool idea all the same.\\n\\nFour-and-a-half stars for the naan kofta sliders. They lose half a star because the menu didn't say they had mayo on them, so I had to scrape it off. Four-and-a-half stars also for the roasted garlic and spinach naan. The dipping sauce which accompanied the naan, the cilantro-mint chutney, had pulverized nuts incorporated into it, making it more like a pesto. Very interesting, and quite tasty.\\n\\nFour stars for the dirty martinis, both gin and vodka.\\n\\nThree stars for the potato-chorizo samosas. They had more cranberries in them than chorizo (I found six specks of chorizo total, two in each samosa. Yes, I looked. Shush). They weren't bad, but I couldn't taste any chorizo at all.\\n\\nTwo stars for the chili-tequila mussels. They were quite good, but half our shells were empty, and the meat that was supposed to be inside couldn't even be found hanging out in the broth. Two stars for the MoMos. We had really high hopes for those; they sounded like the most delicious things on the menu. But they had as much flavor as rice paper rolled around rice paper. The spicy tomato-peanut chutney which accompanied them was not spicy, nor did it contain even a hint of tomato. Two stars for the cocktail menu, which offers only the sickly-sweetest looking drinks.\\n\\nOne star for the fries which accompanied the naan kofta sliders. I'm pretty sure they were Ore Ida fries fresh from the freezer, and the ketchup was less ketchup and more no-name catsup. Feh.\\n\\nFinally, half a star for the waiter, who took his sweet time with us. We ordered our appetizers (the MoMos and the naan) but said we weren't yet decided on the main dishes. Our drinks arrived, sometime later our appetizer arrived, but our waiter didn't reappear to take our order. We tried to flag him down a few times, but he averted his eyes. He finally returned when we'd finished our appetizers nearly half an hour before. When it was time for us to get our check, he didn't walk it over to our table. He reached over the bar and kept calling and motioning for me to come and get it from him. He tried the same thing to return the check to us for my boyfriend to sign, but when neither of us ever stood, he huffed and walked it over to us himself."},{"name":"Chuck E.

I was put off with the foods delivery to the table. I was about to give them high praise for the size of the portions until I realized they had hidden extra rice underneath the rack of ribs making it seem as if there was more bang to the buck.

Then the whole thing is baked & topped with a WALNUT CREAM BRANDY SAUCE!  I don't eat there as often as I used to, but this dish never fails.  If ya go, ya gotta check it out.  But I warn you: you may not be able to order anything else from that point forward, like me; then YOU might become a \\"Rellenoholic\\" too!  But trust me, that's not necessarily a BAD thing.\\n\\nThey're also known for their salsa.  Don't walk out the door without trying it.\\n\\nI don't know if it's just my browser or their website, but for me, at least, their 'site is acting finicky.

It took the waiter at least 10 minutes to take our drink order, his excuse being that another patron was yelling at him...strike two.  We finally ordered our meals.  I ordered the Haddock which came with mashed potato and tomatoes.  The presentation was awful and the fish had a strong odor when it was brought to the table, although it tasted ok.  The potatoes were absolutely disgusting - tasted like the powdered ones from the box but worse, ewwww, and the tomatoes were too.

My biggest enemy is probably that I routinely host Korean BBQ diners in my home and sometimes just have an impromptu BBQ for me and my wife...it is so easy and cheap to do at home with the assistance of our over abundance of Asian markets who prep most things for you, especially an Hmart, Gmart, or other Korean market. It probably helps that I bought a burner and bbq pan a few years back but even then those cost together what one meat dish cost here. I can't digest public Korean BBQ, so I just stopped in for a bowl of kimchee jjigae. The banchan was good, the stew was alright...there's better in this town. It looks as if someone invested a lot of money in renaming and rebranding this place only to charge you for the right to eat here because it now looks like a hip and trendy Korean night spot reminiscent of some of the ones you would find in Los Angeles. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate my meal here or the service (which was great) or the atmosphere...I just think they are trying too hard to be more in a town where so many Korean restaurants already do better with less.

It's the food, albeit an almost line-by-line recreation of any other menu, that sets it apart from those chain restaurants. \\n\\nLa Casita is a small place with limited parking.  It's best to go around three in the afternoon to ensure you get a parking spot and a table with no wait.  The best thing about La Casita is that aside from Fiesta Jalisco, they have the best English-speaking staff I've encountered. And they're friendly!  When I went the last time with a friend of mine, we got there when it was a peak time, but our waiter was still attentive.  I ordered the chimichanga (of course) and he got a seafood burrito of some sort.  Most entrees come with beans and rice, and they start you off with chips and salsa.  My favorite part about La Casita is that if you ask, they will give you the spicy super hot salsa.  Mix this with their house salsa and yum yum yum you've got yourself a winner.  I enjoy their chimichangas more than most other places because they make two mini chimichangas and serve them side by side on a bed of lettuce and drench them with queso blanco.  There's nothing like cutting through a film of melted cheese into the crisp shell and releasing the flavorful meat on the inside of a La Casita chimichanga.\\n\\nIn general, La Casita is a nice place to go if you're tasting for some Mexican food on a Tuesday night.

I really did. But instead I felt cheated. After not seeing my friend for over a month, we were both visiting during the weekend for a concert, and we could not wait to have hotpot together again. We went to the Richmond location in the past, and had a pretty good time despite not being able to speak Mandarin. We were originally supposed to go to that location again, but I mistakenly suggested we should go to this location instead since we were already nearby. \\n\\nAt first I thought we would have a better time here, and I tried holding onto that belief until I finally realized that they weren't giving us the right amount of food we ordered.\\n\\nAnd this is where I felt cheated. We had AYCE (All you can eat), yet they weren't even giving us the right amounts that we were asking for. I first thought they just had smaller portions than the Richmond location, and that it was our fault for not ordering more. But then once second round came, and the amounts of stuff we got were not only lessened but also randomized by what we ordered, I realized that this was definitely not our fault. Some of the stuff we ordered didn't even show up at all. What we had was definitely not worth the 30 bucks, and it was barely \\"all you can eat\\". \\n\\nIf you can't speak Mandarin, or don't have a friend who speak it, don't bother coming. They don't make you feel welcomed nor really care about you. Our table was pretty much empty, while everyone else that were Mandarin speakers had full tables of food. The servers only stop to pick up empty plates, and give your bill but nothing else.

There is a trend in Oregon food to reexamine and rethink traditional and simple food.  Given that Oregon has some of the best local food in the country it is perplexing to me that Oregonian restaurants would complicate it so much.  Little Bird was this meal - over complicated and over thought with flavors so overwhelming that the central piece of each dish was lost.  For example, the escargot lay on a thick bed of fennel.  Fennel is a strong ingredient.  It so overwhelms the snails that their delicate flavors are lost.  And, if you eat the snails alone they were unseasoned.  The steak tartar was layered with a sauce so strong that the taste of the steak was lost. The meal goes on and on like this.  So on and on that while the chef has the option to do as they like we would not come back."},{"name":"Halal Bros","address":"2712 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I was pretty psyched about this place because of all the hype my friends gave it, so I decided to give it a try. I didn't know what to get but knew I wanted a wrap, so I decided to get the special they had of the day which was the lamb kabab.\\n\\nWhen I ordered, I asked the cashier what was inside the kabab since I don't really tomatoes and what not. She told me there was lettuce, onions, and tomatoes, so I asked her to only put the lettuce inside with my kabab since I don't like raw onions or tomatoes. My boyfriend got the beef shawarma, and we also ordered hummus, an extra pita bread, and fries with the sauces on the side. After I finished paying, I looked at my receipt and saw she charged me for the lamb kabab on rice. When I went back to the counter to tell her, she said she would just change it to the kabab. I'm not sure how much the price difference is, but I feel like $9 for a lamb kabab is p pricey.\\n\\nWhen I got my food, she forgot to give us the sauce on the side for the fries. Once I got home, I was pretty disappointed that the wraps weren't labeled. I basically opened it and hopped it was mine. Once I took the first bite of my lamb kabab, of course, there were onions, tomatoes, as well as cucumbers in my wrap. This would be absolutely horrific if I was actually allergic to any of those instead of just disliking it. Not only did the cashier get my order wrong and charge me for the lamb kebab over rice, she still got my order wrong and it had the onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers in there. As for the beef shawarma wrap, the meat was cold. It was so strange, but it was. It also didn't come with lettuce or anything. It was just the beef shawarma, tomatoes, and sauce. 2 stars. My boyfriend didn't even finish it because it was so below par (and he usually finishes everything including my food). The fries were okay. It wasn't crispy. It was p soft and p thick. The only thing I actually enjoyed was the hummus and pita bread. It had a nice flavor and creamy texture.\\n\\nTbh, the lamb kebab wasn't too bad, but I won't come back again because my order was wrong, the beef shawarma was cold, and the cashier honestly didn't pay attention to anything I said or asked for.

All of them tasted fantastic!!! The kimchi fried rice was totally different from the ones in Vancouver and Coquitlam. The kimchi fried rice was spicy but we could manage it. The restaurant used some dried kimchi/veggies to cook with the rice. They also put an egg with sunny side up on top of the fried rice. Great food!! The soup base of Gamjatang was really good that it was totally different from the ones out there. The beef nubiany was served on a hot pan. The beef was dry by itself, but if we dipped it in the sauce, it tasted better. Other than all these food above, their side dishes such as kimchi, slices of fish cakes, potatoes with soy sauce and bean sprouts were excellent! I wouldn't know how to describe all these delicious food to you unless you tried them yourselves.

The time between the courses was too long and we were left wondering where the heck our food was. Throughout the meal, we had to ask for refills on our beverages. She never checked on us during the meal nor did she seem even remotely interested in even the most basic level of politeness. She abruptly interrupted my conversation with my friend by very rudely demanding to know where her boyfriend was... we both calmly explained that he was washing his hands and she didn't seem to like that answer. \\n\\nFood: The salads were bland and over dressed, the appetizers were greasy. But when it came to the signature Prime Rib, it was essentially inedible. It looked like a boiled loaf of extruded beef and surely tasted like it too. The texture was undeniably sponge-like. Why they felt that need to serve the prime rib table side (when there is nothing appetizing about watching a beef loaf being dipped in overly salty beef bouillon), I will never know. It was awful. I brought the leftovers home to give my dog, but truthfully, I think its beneath her. \\n\\nBottom line... Food was awful, service was abysmal.

We had a group of 8. yes, that is a big table but not THAT big. They couldn't figure out who our waiter was so every few minutes we had a new person asking us what we wanted... which we had already ordered 3 waiters ago. It took about 30 minutes just to get our first drink.  Once we got our food, we didn't see a waiter for about an hour. No one refilled our drinks except for the waters.  \\nFinally at the end, my friend (the one celebrating her birthday) didn't even want a dessert, she was just ready to leave. But we couldn't get a check. All the waiters were right behind our table folding silverware in napkins and flirting. Yes, flirting. \\nFinally someone brought the check and we got out of there. \\nIt's unfortunate that this was our experience because other times i had been there before and it was ok. \\nthis experience just left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Came to boston for a weekend visit.

I can see why you chose it, since I am already trying to figure out another time to come back here!\\n\\nYou walk into this tiny 28 seating restaurant which from the outside looks like some hole-in-the-wall joint, bu you know the moment you enter Bondir that you are in for a treat. It is one room with a sitting area in front with a fireplace during the winter helps to warm your soul before their food does, and in the fall when I just went, it has some truly delightful candles that just create this completely inviting atmosphere for fine dining. \\n\\nBut it isn't really fine dining--yes the food is fine and divine and all that, but the servers are not dressed up despite the white linens on the tables. Their wine list does have quite the price mark up on it, but that's how the story goes for most restaurants in Boston. My mom and I started with a soup and salad...and that soup is what will forever make me want to eat here.\\n\\nIt was butternut squash with bee pollen, carmelized shallots, and  a melted spiced marshmellow on top. My god. That soup has to be the most perfect soup ever made. I even asked the server about the spices so I can attempt to recreate it at home, it was simply amazing. Their spiced poached beet salad served with fresh garden herbs was also just a lovely beginning to our meal. We then split two half size entrees (this was more than enough food for us despite our server's recommendation of more!) of a roasted chicken that was so moist and that skin was roasted to perfection--it sat on top of a cornmeal cake with this squash and these green beans that would make any veggie lover sing out with joy. Plus it was topped with these mini ripe vine tomatoes that were just perfect. I got the rabbit canon which was served with butcher blood red grits. I wasn't sure what to expect but then we got the plate, and there it was--blood on  the grits! I know this sounds gross, but it honestly all worked together so well. The rabbit was so so good, kidneys and all ha ha Yup that is how incredible inventive they are here. They use all the parts of the animals that they can, and it still just looks and tastes like pure art. \\n\\nWe ended with their house made hot chocolate which honestly should have been served hotter, but their apple trifle surely made up for that! This torched meringue topping that tasted like whipped heaven on top of these apples sitting on this spice cake that tasted like it had a little rum soaked into it--either that or I was drunk and in love with this place!

I actually kept my expectations low, because Murphy's is famous for its brunch (not dinner), so I was pleasantly surprised.\\n\\nWe had a reservation for 7 PM on Saturday. Quickly left my car for the complimentary valet (don't forget to tip your valet attendants) and headed inside. When we arrived, the host explained that there was no indoor seating available and asked if outdoor (covered and heated) was okay. Eager to eat as soon as possible, we agreed. The outdoor seating was pretty warm. Although, try to avoid sitting near potential draft areas, because my girlfriend was a bit chilly. \\n\\nLet me preface this by explaining how little we usually eat at restaurants. We can share an appetizer and one entree and be content to full. If we order two entrees, one of us will definitely take something back home. But we were ambitious at Murphy's and ordered: Flash Fried Calamari, Kansas City Strip Steak, Saturday Scallops special, and the Dessert Trio. As soon as we ordered our appetizer and mains, we assumed that there would be leftovers. But no... We ate it all.\\n\\nFlash Fried Calamari: She said it was the best calamari she ever had. I thought it was delicious, but not the best ever. I honestly like the frozen calamari at Costco better... It is the best calamari I've had at an American restaurant, though.\\n\\nKansas City Strip Steak: Any steak makes me happy, so I was happy. The steak was cooked as requested, medium rare, and it was delicious. Not the best steak ever, but great for a non-steakhouse. The cheesy potatoes that came with the steak was 10/10. So simple, but delicious.\\n\\nScallops: I don't know why, but the flavors in the dish reminded me of Thai food (or some Asian food). A good balance of sweet and savory. Not mindblowing, but I recommend it for anyone who likes seafood and slight Asian flavors.\\n\\nDessert Trio: My favorite part of the meal. Oh my gosh... We were already full by the end of the main course, but there's always room for some dessert. If you haven't had their desserts, get the Dessert Trio! It's a good sample of three desserts: bonzo cake, tollhouse pie, vanilla bean panna cotta. ALL OF IT WAS HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH. The bonzo cake is very rich and heavy and great for chocolate lovers. The tollhouse pie was my personal favorite, lighter than expected (but still full of chocolate, fat, and sugar) and reminded me of a seriously decked out chocolate chip cookie a la mode. Finally, the vanilla bean panna cotta was great. I didn't expect much from the panna cotta, but it was really good with the sweetened diced pears on the side (recommended for fans of fruity desserts).\\n\\nService was pretty good throughout. Our server forgot the specials and apologized as he used his \\"cheat sheet\\", but who cares? He was friendly and our food came out in a timely manner. Dinner at Murphy's makes me want to try their brunch. Whatever meal I go for next, I'll be having dessert in some manner."},{"name":"Bubor Cha Cha","address":"45 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"The first experience is ok, 3 star, the attitude is a little rude though, but right, it's Chinatown, what can you expect.

The glasses for the soda is HUGE, which is nice (though the server gave me diet when I asked for regular. Yuck! She was apologetic and switched it out for me though). \\n\\nI just don't feel right giving this place more than three stars, because after all... it's *Hooters*.
