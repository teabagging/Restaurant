They have quite a few yummy options which made it hard for me to decide. I allowed my stomach to choose and of course I got more than I could eat... mac and cheese, potato salad, and corn. They also had dessert station with banana pudding, pies, peach cobbler and more. I choose to pass on the desserts but they looked great.  \\n\\nNext stop... Meat choices. They had a variety of smoked bbq meats to choose from. I choose the brisket, beef ribs, and sausage. As I walked over to my picnic table with a huge smile on my face, I couldnt help to think... Wow, I'm about to make that rib disappear. \\n\\nThe food was awesome. The meats were tender, well flavored, with 3 choices of bbq sauce spicy, original, and sweet. The sides were all delicious. The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy, potato salad was fresh, flavorful, and had a nice tang.

My boyfriend did one of the combo/specials that gave him a sandwich popover with egg and ham, a savory popover (we did cheese) and a drink. He said the ham was delicious, fried really nicely, but the egg was average and the sandwich could have used some cheese.

We got to sit right in front of the kitchen, front-row seats to the constant hustle and bustle of line cooks and sous chefs working the floor.\\n\\nIn order of what was served...\\n\\nGrilled Strawberries\\nDefinitely an interesting texture take on strawberries with snap pea and chevre. I was a fan.\\n\\nPig Skin Noodles\\nThese were quite good, with an added kick from the hot sauce blended with shrimp and scallops. I could've eaten a giant bowl of these.\\n\\nGrilled Carrot\\nA nicely prepared dish - not one of the standouts, but definitely tasty.\\n\\nPoached Red Snapper\\nYou cannot go wrong with koji butter, no matter what you do. Pair this decadent koji butter with a perfect piece of poached red snapper and you have an extraordinarily savory, delicious dish.\\n\\nParley Croissant\\nQuite, quite good. The bone marrow has more of a foie gras-like texture but still butter, rich and so, so good. The Parsley Croissant was flaky and delectable. \\n\\nBlackened Octopus\\nAnother great dish. The pork fried rice was amazing. The octopus was well flavored and nicely tender.\\n\\nFried Chicken\\nLike candy, with its skin coated with smoked fish caramel. The pickles were a nice touch.\\n\\nDuck\\nThis was the one dish that I expected just a bit more from. Definitely a great piece of duck, but could have been a bit softer. Beet and strawberry were great additions though.\\n\\nGrapefruit Sorbet\\nExtremely refreshing, with the combination of jasmine and beet. Mmmm.\\n\\nPeanut Monte Blanc\\nSeeing this on the menu, I was a little worried that this would be really sweet - with ingredients like honey, dark chocolate and ginger - but it was absolutely perfect. A little nutty, a little crunchy. So good.\\n\\nIt's a dinner that will take up most of your evening - it lasted roughly 2.5 hours - but it was really quite nice.

It actually has REAL pumpkin in it, and doesn't just taste syrupy sweet. You can also get it as a pumpkin chai, if you don't want the espresso.\\n- Free WiFi!\\n\\nThings to note:\\n\\n- It always feels really hot inside here to me, and I'm normally chilly.\\n- No breakfast sammiches, but there's plenty of grub from the MoJoe Lounge next door.\\n- A little slower at preparing the drinks than 'Bux, but if the line over there is long, you'll still save time with the slower prep here.\\n\\n\\nI love how all the Cup O' Joes around town have a different vibe.

And the house flour tortillas had such great chew to them.  My son said he would kill to eat that chicken. \\n\\nThe Texas red tamale I would put up there as one of the best tamales I have eatin.  I have had a lot and I would put it up there with rick Baylee's at frontera grill Chicago. \\n\\nWe also tried the hamachi crudo, the slow cooked beef rib, the root beer float,  the cobbler and the pickled juice pairing with bourbon, mescal and a anise   It was playful and fun.  \\n\\nChef Adams has put together a outstanding menu and a great cozy room. With definite hints of him from the antique fly rods and bamboo fishing baskets to his  well done chef. Well done\\n\\n\\nWe decided on lunch before leaving town.

So when we brought it to their attention, they made the drink problem right, but wanted to argue about the difference in the kids meals. We were told the computers had been updated and somehow that made it all ok. So after arguing back and forth the manager finally corrected it. The point is not the .30, but the fact that the manager argued with us when the menu clearly stated the kids meals were 3.89. We will eat here again, but we will be double checking our receipt. Silly me, I like to pay what the stated price is."},{"name":"Sea Level Oyster Bar","address":"94 Wharf St","city":"Salem","stars":"4","text":"Besides the beautiful view the amount of seafood in the seafood platter was dismal at best while the quality was up there at $32 a platter cut it included more than 5 scallops 3 shrimp 8 Clams but a decent piece of haddock get twice as much for the same amount Essex Seafood Golden Corral spot Salem witch still got the biggest and best around dube's"},{"name":"Signal Station Pizza","address":"8302 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Not too impressed.

Luckily we got a beef rib to share and each a pork rib so we had plenty of edible food, and neither type of rib requires sauce because both hold up without. The mac n cheese was also yummy - creamy and homemade tasting.

The setting is festive, airy, comfy, and clean, the service is quick, and the food isn't bad. \\n\\nWe really liked the \\"mardi gras\\" theming of the seating area, complete with some awesome mask collections. In addition to being quite comfortable, this particular food court seems to have even more attendants than normal to help clear your plates. They also have restrooms right next to the seating area, which is super convenient (only a few Disney quick service restaurants have this). \\n\\nAs for the food: the gumbo was quite tasty, and full of meat. The famous beignets were definitely amazing, and absolutely worth a trip (you can easily get here from any of the parks by a quick bus ride, or Disney Springs by a very pleasant water taxi ride). Not only did they taste great, but they were HUGE (and Mickey shaped, of course!) The one dish that was a big disappointment was the jambalaya: it was almost all rice (very little meat or veggies) and fairly tasteless.

Owing slightly to the dim sum concept, there are no carts, but for the menu you get a paper sheet and a pen to fill out your selections. I recommend coming here with a larger group than just two so you can try more of the huge list of great dishes, because the two of us got way too much and were beyond stuffed:\\n\\n- Dan Dan Noodles ($8)\\n- Tea Smoked Ribs ($7)\\n- Wok-Roasted Chinese Sausage Omelet ($7)\\n- General Myer's Chicken Wings ($6)\\n- Kimchee Fried Quinoa Bowl ($8)\\n- Mama Chang's Pork & Chive Dumplings ($6 for 3)\\n- Asian Braised Beef Stuffed Bao ($5 for 1)\\n- Nirvana Chicken Stuffed Bao ($5 for 1)\\n- Fried Egg Banh Mi with Sweet Soy Glazed Bacon ($6)\\n\\nThat's an embarrassing amount of food, and too much to even try to describe in a Yelp review. I kept on finding myself rushing to finish the last dumpling or wing just to make enough room on the table for all of the food. The dumplings and bao were pretty good, but the Chinese Sausage Omelet and the Fried Egg Banh Mi were the real standouts. The ribs and wings were also quite tasty, and really juicy. The Quinoa Bowl was very interesting and different from what you normally find even in a fusion place, but it was not good as the Genmai Fried Rice, which we got the previous time when we came for dinner.\\n\\nAnother reason this is better than your usual dim sum is that there is dessert like Chocolate Peanut Butter Layer Cake ($8). This was pretty good, but not quite peanut buttery enough for me, and I expected more considering the Chang of Myers + Chang is the woman that runs Flour, home of some of the greatest sweets I've ever had.\\n\\nThis is a really fun, trendy spot, though the crowd can be quite different depending on when you come. For brunch, there were tons of families with little kids, while it was much more filled with adults at dinner. The service was perfect too, making for a perfectly enjoyable meal.\\n\\nI'll definitely be back next time I'm in Boston.

I love the way the drinks are all lined up in the ice, ready for the taking. \\n\\nLet's not forget how great the actual food is. Starting with the sides, I love the green beans and mac & cheese. They rock. Follow those up with a banana pudding, and it is time to grab some meat. I always over-order here. Oh well. The Beef rib is pricey,  but fabulous. My staple is 1/4 pound brisket, 1/4 turkey, and a jalapeno cheddar sausage link. I always recommend to eat turkey and white meat chicken first, or else they seem to dry out. \\n\\nFinally, to the condiments, sauces, and drinks. These are a must: slice of white bread, side of pickles and onions, and a sweet tea. I like that tables aren't supposed to be reserved.

So, about Desta.....\\n\\nAmbience: Nice sized restaurant, set off a side street. Tons of seating, though it's TIGHT! You'll get to know your neighboring table, for sure. The restaurant is well let, at least downstairs. Upstairs is a bit dim, we had to use our phones for light.  Most of the tables are 2-4 tops, half booth, half chair.\\n\\nService: Note, if you go on a weekend, be prepared to wait, usually 45-60 minutes. Once you get seated the service is good. You may end up flagging a server down for a refill, but that's about it. This place is extremely busy, and very popular,  rightfully so. \\n\\nThe food: All the yums! I love this place. If you're  a newbie, don't be afraid to ask for help deciphering the menu. There's everything from rare beef to the most amazing vegetable platter ever. Literally something for everyone. \\nTip: add awaze sauce to your protein. It's a spicy, tangy, wonderful sauce that enhances any dish.\\nAs a pescatarian, my go to is the grouper tibs, mixed with rice and awaze sauce (good lawd it's good). Regarding sides I love their mushroom stew (you have to ask for it), miser (red lentil stew) and cabbage. \\nMy BF is vegetarian and swears by the veggie platter. It's huge!

When Google maps directed us into the mall, my husband nearly reversed back out of the parking lot.  But we soldiered on, and it paid off.\\n\\nSeated outside, we were comfortable and cool due to the strong ceiling fans.  The landscaping at the mall is nice, and made for as nice of a mall dining experience as you could hope for.  A couple servers fought over us, but we ended up with William.  William was awesome but ZOMG there is no need to go over the entire menu with people who are literate adults.  We already knew what we wanted to order and had to listen to explanations of all, oh, 500 menu categories.  And it's not a confusing menu!  I feel bad for complaining, and I assume William probably gets a shitload of idiotic questions that have necessitated this thorough explanation, or the manager makes the servers do this.  \\n\\nWe went with the blackened tuna nachos, which have crab rangoon dip, some nice rare tuna, guac, tomatoes, and microgreens atop wonton skins.  Fear not!  The combination of cream cheese and tuna is not gross and the entire thing works really well.  For our entree we split a sushi plate they call the Double Deuce.  It had some nigiri, Cali rolls and spicy tuna rolls, and it was all fresh and delicious.  I'm a sushi n00b and really picky, and the tuna was awesome.  It wasn't minced all to hell and covered in spicy mayo like it is at most places.\\n\\nI don't know how often we'll be dining at Perimeter Mall, but if we have occasion too again I'd definitely go back to The Cowfish.

I'll vouch for the white sangria if you're looking for something alcoholic.\\n\\nFor being such a busy place, the tapas come out at a good rate.

If you don't, you will be waiting a long time.\\n\\nAs I said, the menu changes constantly.  Some of the tapas they rotate in are great, but some of them miss the mark.  Notably, there used to be a carrot-based tapa that I was not a fan of (it might be back in the rotation at this point).  It was extremely vinegary, to the point where my body tried to stop me from eating it.  It was hard to swallow because of the sheer amount of vinegar.

The thing is the prices raised a lot but the quality didn't. My parents say the price doesn't matter because having dim sum's purpose is to spend a lot of time together while eating slowly.

There was no sauce, no basil.  The man delivering was very kind and went back to get the basil  But it was of no use.  Adding dried up basil to a flavorless crust pizza and no sauce was nothing more than just a pie of \\nbaked flour with a very small amount of unripened tomatoes was useless. \\n\\nI feel badly for not writing a glowing review...the pizza the owner cooked was awesome but the one last night deserved less than one star. \\n\\nI will possibly order again it the owner is there, but if he isn't I will walk out and go someplace else.

I was lucky and found a parking spot around the corner, but they do have 4-5 parking spots beside the building.\\n\\nWe started with the Les Fleurs du Mal ros√© for me and the chardonnay for my friend. The ros√© was light and sweet, a perfect way to start the evening. \\n\\nFor the appetizer, we shared the salade de ch√®vre chaud: warm goat cheese, brie and crostini, walnuts, beets, and fresh greens. Everything complimented each other very well. I'm not a huge fan of brie, finding it a bit salty and overpowering, but with the beets this was really delicious.\\n\\nWe shared two mains. The first was the canard confit: confit duck on a warm salad of sarladaise potatoes, goat cheese, spinach and port jus. The duck skin was crispy and the meat was moist. But the star of the show for the both of us was the potatoes. It was so flavourful, probably thyme, and melted in your mouth. It was so good we wanted to order another portion of it!\\n\\nWe also shared the filet de boeuf grill√©: beef tenderloin, potato gratin and glazed vegetables, and chose the red wine shallot jus. The portion was sizable, the tenderloin was cooked perfectly at medium rare, and the vegetables went very well with the wine sauce.\\n\\nFor dessert, we had the cr√®me br√ªl√©e.

This restaurant was around the corner from our hotel so we found it as we were just walking around. The decor and vibe are on point!! Bright colors, plush seating and pillows, candles and cool low lighting. Modern Turkish music and art gave this little place the perfect ambience. I would definitely come back for drinks to just chill with friends. \\n\\nThey gave us bread and oil to start - I LOVE Italian food so of course I was comparing it to that, and the Italian version has more flavor to me with the garlic and cheese. But this version was lighter and didnt have me full before my order even came, so I liked that. I also ordered the Cool as a Cuke cocktail  (gin, rosemary, cucumber) - now THAT had flavor! So good I had another! \\n\\nI had the beef mousaka...it was just okay. The flavors were decent but it was very mushy (its kind of like a Shepard's pie with the layers) and I needed more texture. My son had some prawn dish with rice veggies and a tomato based sauce - he ate it all! I was shocked! I tasted his and didn't like it, it was very fishy tasting, but prawns aren't really my thing. \\n\\nOverall it was a great little spot and I'm glad we tried Turkish food for the first time!

Don't wait till the last minute. By  7 p.m. Saturday,  the restaurant was packed.  (Note that there are a series of tables- for- two that are one on top of the other; it would be my preference to sit elsewhere.)\\n\\nParking:  You can drive around the residential neighborhood behind the restaurant looking for street parking, or spend $2 + tip for valet.\\n\\nService:  Friendly and impeccable.  Yanni, our server, was terrific.  \\n\\nWine:  I'm not a wine-sophisticate, but I know that I generally like cabs, malbec and shiraz.  As Yanni said, I could get malbec  at 'any Kroger,' but how often does one have the opportunity to try Greek wine?!  With our $45 limit, Yanni steered us to a Mythic River wine of Peloponnese -- a red with good body and full flavor.  The wine list is extensive, with prices starting in the high $30 range.\\n\\nMenu:  There are two prix fixe menus.   For $32 per person, you can order 5 meze (tapas-size) dishes with 3 spreads.  OR, you can opt for the 4 meze/3 spread + whole fish dinner @ $44.  While I wanted all meze, my husband thought we'd leave hungry.  Kyma is known for fish, so we decided to go (ahem) full hog.  For those undecided, we realized mid-meal that with the right choices, you will be fully satisfied with a meal of appetizers.\\n\\nOur Meze/Spread Choices: The kitchen erred -- in our favor! -- so we got the opportunity to try all four spreads  (You can read the choices on Kyma's menu.)  I thought each was okay -- but none bowled me over. (A word to the wise: don't fill up on spreads & pita; there are such good things to come.)  Note that the meze are broken into 4 price points, but the prix fixe,  you can order whichever you'd like at no extra cost.  I recommend our choices:  Musssels Trahana (a HUGE portion with a thick flavorful sauce that's more like a side), Grilled Octopus (a signature dish, reminiscent of marinated pork or chicken.  Delicious!), Baby Calamari (melt-in-your-mouth tender),  Spicy Lamb Pie in Phyllo  (Yummy -- and I'm not a fan of lamb.)\\n\\nFish:  It was a toss up between skate and lavarki.  Yanni -- ever so helpful -- steered us to the lavraki, akin to sea bass, which is  popular  in Greece.  The fish arrived deboned and topped with capers.  Our extra squirt of lemon brought out the flavor.  Verrrrry good! . The side was an interesting combination of quinoa and kale.\\n\\nDessert: Greek desserts are a treat, and despite being full, T and I shared a pastry.  I told Yanni that I once lived in Astoria (a very Greek area in NY) and my favorite was a phyllo and custard dessert.  It was katafi, which Yanni pointed out is not prepared at Kyma the way I had it in Queens.  He recommended another custard pastry -- sorry, I don't know the name -- which was soooooooo good. T. ended his meal with a cup of thick and delicious, sludge-on-the-bottom, sweet Greek coffee. \\n                                                               * * * * \\n\\nThis was indeed a wonderful evening.

The beef rib was ginormous!! That was salty but... If you dip it in one of their delicious bbq sauces, it evens it out. \\n\\nMy only regret is not eating on site and trying their delicious sides as well. We did get a peach cobbler and ate that on the spot but it was ok. I wouldn't recommend that. Just stick to the brisket and beef ribs-you can't go wrong with that.

We did this because Joe the owner responded to my review and honestly wanted a chance to earn our business back.  He offered his contact info and a gift card which was a great thing to do.  I didn't contact him or take him up on his gift card as I didn't want to appear that he had bought this review.\\n\\nToday the food was great.  We had chicken and waffles and it was excellent.  It was cooked properly, came out warm and had the proportions we were previously used to. \\n\\nThe service was top notch too.  Friendly hostess, attentive server, attentive water/coffee refill guy.  I also was particularly impressed that Joe the owner was there hustling along with his crew.  He brought our food to us and was quite friendly.  I did not identify myself as a previously concerned yelp reviewer, because I didn't want to make it about me.  Instead, I observed and enjoyed his restaurant and am now putting the earth back on axis with this review.  Babica has regained its crown and is one of our favorites.  Thank you Joe and Team Babica.\\n\\nOn another note, I spent some time reading some of the other reviews on here.  It seems that a common theme is the wait time for a table.  For me this is the sign of a good restaurant.  If you don't want to wait, come early or don't come.  But please don't wait and then complain about it. Or worse, wait get yourself in a Hangry mood (hungry + angry) and then have a biased view of your experience,  as for waiting time, the clock should start once you are seated and then give the team a fair chance to deliver excellence.  Just saying...\\n\\nThanks again...\\n\\n\\nORIGiNAL POST:  It used to be our favorite place, but recent changes in the food will not be bringing us back.  I'm guessing there must have been changes in the kitchen management because it shows.  \\n\\nFirst off, the old chicken and waffles used to come with two pieces of chicken, two waffles, a fruit cup and some amazing mousse.  This was the prized dish at the restaurant.  Recently the dish now comes with three waffles, one small piece of chicken, a substandard mousse and no fruit cup.  When we asked about it, we were first told the dish hadn't changed.  Then the story changed to we stopped serving the fruit cup because nobody ate the fruit.  When asked why they reduced the chicken to one piece they denied it ever had two.  So basically they have down graded what they served and kept the high price.\\n\\nThe other dish that was once a favorite but has had similar treatment is the quinoa avocado bowl.  They eliminated the pomegranate as a key ingredient and doubled the onion (making it inedible).  When asked about the change in the ingredients the server denied it.  Then when it was was pointed out on the menu that the dish contained pomegranate they said oh, I guess we did change it.  \\n\\nI gave it two stars because they did take off the quinoa avocado bowl off our bill.  \\n\\nBut i should  give it 1 star to catch the attention of the Buck family that their once amazing restaurant is no longer amazing.  Please bring back the food and/or the people who used to make it amazing. \\n\\nFor reference, histor I would have given this restaurant a 6 star rating if I could."},{"name":"The COOP: A Southern Affair","address":"610 W Morse Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"First time I went here with my kids Londonandsydney dot com.

We entered the restaurant and no one was at the hostess stand. We wandered around until finally someone seated us. Our waiter came by just to let us know he would be back in a few minutes.\\n\\nIt was lunchtime, and we all ordered the unlimited soup and salad lunch deal. We figured that soups and salads would be straightforward and quick - wrong! It took 15 minutes before the soups and salads finally came out.\\n\\nThe lobster bisque was ice cold, and I fail to believe it had any lobster in it. The texture was gritty. We sent it back and it was returned to us at the same temperature. My \\"Bibb & Bleu\\" salad did not have a single piece of Bibb lettuce (clearly iceberg and romaine), not a single piece of bleu cheese (just a bland creamy dressing); the \\"prosciutto\\" in the salad consisted of one small piece of burnt bacon.\\n\\nWe asked for refills on everything (wishful thinking it would be better the second time around), and again it took 15 minutes.

Maybe three or four other tables with diners. I think they had only one guy working in the kitchen.\\n\\nWe let the manager know about our disappointing experience. She explained that the lobster bisque was not served in a hot bowl because it needed to be in a different type of bowl.

The decor was very modern and had a hipster feel to it; it was very white, clean and simple. There was a guide that explained social media and donuts on the wall, which was very cute, and a little paragraph about Blue Star donuts and how it's made. The kitchen is right in front of you, so you can see the people working in the back, taking time to embellish each donut right. \\n\\nWe ordered the passionfruit with coconut nibs, chocolate almond ganache, hazelnut dulce de creme, maple bacon, lemon poppy, and blueberry bourbon and basil. After ordering, you wait at the side until your name is called, and your donuts come stacked in two layers (which got really messy, as the frosting would get all over the place.)\\n\\nPassionfruit and coconut- it was sweet and fruity, but very light. definitely more unique than typical donuts. \\n\\nChocolate almond ganache- again, very light. All the donuts here are not very heavy; they were really fluffy and chewy, which I found to be perfect for breakfast. The chocolate was not too sweet and the almond added a good crunch to the donut.\\n\\nHazelnut dulce de creme- this was a little bit heavier, and made with a cake dough. The dulce de leche had a nice taste, but didnt really taste the hazelnut. Overall not bad. \\n\\nMaple bacon- the best. MUST ORDER. They use real maple with tiny bits of bacon, and combined with the fluffy donut, omfg. I have tried maple bacon donuts everywhere, and never really liked it as it wasn't really done right. But this one was.. the best I've ever had. The bacon wasn't overwhelming or too salty, and the mixture of both... yum.\\n\\nLemon poppy- tasted exactly like how its supposed to. Yum.\\n\\nBlueberry bourbon and basil- my second favorite- the blueberry frosting got all over the place, but the flavor was perfect. I can't really explain it, but this is definitely another must try. \\n\\nDonuts here are definitely done right- the four of us shared six donuts and we killed everything. Total came out to be around $22 with two drinks, which is kind of pricey, but it is well worth it.

So good for you, Terry Black's!! You did it with that brisket! The moment we were asked at the meat cutting station (cafeteria style starting with sides) if we wanted a fatty cut you all had my respect. That brisket though! Mmmm, I'll come back for that. Moving on, equally glorious is that cornbread! Legit the best I've had - but I'm new to Texas. Also loved their beans, mac & cheese and cream corn. Pickles, onions and bread off to the side with silverware (back to the left of the meat cutting), napkins are paper towel rolls at the table, where you also find the sauces. You'll have shared seating spaces, that honestly don't appear to be adequate for the line! We got a nice end spot. We found parking out front, with a few people leaving. And then there seemed to be a parking lot as well, but don't hold me to it. Seems like it could get even more crowded in good weather. Don't be surprised by a wait - but the brisket alone is worth it!

The food is really delicious and provides for a number of excellent dishes. Complete with a full service bar with awesome waiters and awesome bartenders. If you are going to the park then I highly recommended you make a reservation if you have a party larger than 2, because there is usually a wait. However if you are about 1, 2, or 3 people, then definitely going to sit at the bar is an option for you to eat. Complete with full service and they are very quick to attend to you. The bartenders will meet and exceed all the needs that you have and get you all the attention you need, along with still fulfilling their duties. Overall and by far the dishes are delicious and can be seen as authentic, but they're not exactly very large and filling in nature. Average price runs about general Disney prices so for 2 people we spent roughly $75 for 2 people. This was inclusive of adult beverage drinks and regular drinks, an appetizer and a meal.

And I love tacos! I have been to both the West Midtown location and the Inman park locations. For the West Midtown location, the primary mode of parking is valet but I have never done valet as I have always been lucky enough to find street parking which is hard with all the new restaurants and establishments nearby. The interior of Bartaco is fun Caribbean style with a feel good environment. My favorite thing is to come to Bartaco on nice days like yesterday and sit outside and enjoy the good food and company.  Their tacos portions are on the smaller side (about 3 bites per taco) but the quality, taste and fresh ingredients make every bite amazing and worth every dollar! \\n\\nTheir guacamole is so fresh you can see and taste the chunks of avocado, probably one of the best guacamoles I have had at restaurants here in Atlanta (and I have high standards for guacamole as my husband makes a banging good guac!). Their Mexican corn is also delicious, who doesn't love Mexican corn with all the cream and cheese. Yummmmm. Today we tried the ahi poke bowl and it was good! I lived in Hawaii for 2 years and I have had some of the best poke there and this one definitely rises to the challenge, the sauce was just perfect with the right amount of each ingredient and the tuna was fresh . What stands out the most for me in Bar Taco is their margaritas and Tacos!!! OMG sometimes I just crave their tacos and drinks! My favorite non-meat tacos in order are the oyster (my husband always orders 3 for himself!), Baja Fish, and Shrimp. Each one has unique sauce and veggies associated with it. It never disappoints. I couldn't have a margarita today but everyone at my table shared a pitcher of Jalapeno Margarita and it was the rave. At about $50 it easily satisfies 5 people so $10 a person is very reasonable. We finished our meal with Churros and chocolate dipping sauce! It is really good I love that they make the chocolate sauce in house. I had a question about the sauce and how they got it to that consistency and the chef actually came out and talked to our table about and told us that they have special order the chocolate to make the sauce in house, does not get better than homemade chocolate sauce.  Lastly, the service is on point! All the servers are friendly, willing to answer questions and give good suggestions. I talked to the manager after our meal to tell him the great job his staff did and ask about reserving for a big family get together. He took the time to talk to me about different catering options and the possibility of reserving space.

It is located right in downtown and easy to fine. There is plenty of seating outside and in with your standard BBQ options. The highlights for me were the Turkey, Brisket, and MAC and Cheese. Great flavor but a little pricey for TX BBQ but  we are all in downtown so it was expected. The pinto beans, peach cobbler , and pecan pie were disappointing. Not awful but just bland.

This market is a good attempt at an authentic German Christmas Market.  While you normally would not pay just to enter a market, I'm assuming there are quite some logistics and overhead associated with putting something like this on.\\n\\nYes, prices are high.  If you have ever been to Germany, you will know that stuff is not cheap and hand-crafted items even more costly.  Add to that the effort of getting these items over here from Germany, the cost is bound to go up.\\n\\nFood was not amazing, but good enough for a tasty treat.  Ambiance was great, people were milling about happily with their Gluhwein and Feuerzangenbowle in hand, listening to Christmas music.  I would definitely come back."},{"name":"Aurora Venezuelan Food","address":"10901 Domain Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"I've had better Venezuelan food from at least two other food trucks than here. While I think this truck corners the market in the Domain area (no competition really, at this time), I found the monstrous triplets burger to be desiring of better preparation. The three different kinds of meats were overcooked. The buns were lifeless, not buttered and seemingly not toasted either. It just served the purpose of soaking up the sauces, the runny egg yolk, and any meat juices that had been drained out. At least the medley of flavors were good together. It would have been amazing if there was more care put into it. \\n\\nI also tried the pabell√≥n empanada but it too was missing something. The empanada shredded beef filling tasted too sweet, especially with the plantains. I was surprised there was no cheese in it - it would have made the filling better.\\n\\nThe teque√±os (cheese sticks) were good. Try it with the guasacaca (avocado/cilantro) sauce or the garlic ajo sauce. The sauces at this truck were great. \\n\\nI liked that this truck had fruit juices to drink, of the brand jugome, a fruit juice truck on South 1st, that offers a tasty mix of tropical fruits. I very much loved the pineapple & passion fruit combo for the drink."},{"name":"Phoebe's Diner","address":"533 W Oltorf St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great little diner.

Found out shortly after that Yuji was ill, apparently had a sudden nose bleed, the servers caring for their boss was thinking of closing early(later on in the meal other ppl showed up at the door and Yuji told the servers that it's fine, let them in, however you can tell he didn't look that great.\\n\\nNow to get onto the food reviews.\\n\\nShiso Saba roll:  Interesting mixture, can't taste the saltiness of the saba, the shiso overpowers it, I liked it, but not sure everyone would.\\n\\nTobiko with quail egg:  Small, but very delicious, make sure you break up the egg in your mouth and let it mix with the rest of the sushi for the best experience and taste.\\n\\nDeluxe Assorted Sashimi:  Smaller pieces than some other places, my only complaint about this.  The aji with chopped green onions on top was excellent, the onions completely removed any \\"fishy\\" taste that aji sometimes has.\\n\\nMarinated Tuna:  This appetizer was amazing, my gf found it had too much wasabi in the marinade, however I found it to be perfect.  Make sure you eat each piece with some of the sprouts(forgot what kind of sprouts they are).\\n\\nUnagi nigori:  Melted in my mouth, so fatty, so oily...soooooo good!\\n\\nEngawa(Halibut):  This was my favorite dish, we ordered 2 pieces of Engawa nigori, however I wish we ordered more, it has a firmer texture than most other fishes, similar to ika but not as chewy. First bite and it felt like butter came out of the fish, the rest of the piece was bathed in a smooth texture in my mouth, completely tantalized my taste buds!\\n\\nI strongly suggest checking this place out, however make sure you're not in any rush as the service is slower(Yuji's the only chef) and the servers manually calculate the bill(double checks everything with the menu).  Their English is very limited so be patient.  Go here to experience the sushi, experience the taste, don't go here if you're in a rush and plan to be served like you would at Miku."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Seeing all the great reviews, I really wanted to like this place... unfortunately, the food was just not that great.\\n\\nFood: 2/5\\nService: 4/5\\n\\nFirst off, their menu is incredibly expensive for what you get. Charging $19 for something like fried rice is quite unsettling. \\n\\nBraised Pork Belly Buns: These were my favorite course; the pork belly melted in my mouth and came with a nice hoisin sauce. Buns were fluffy and tasty.\\n\\nLemony Shrimp Dumplings: These were all right. They did come with a nice sauce, but the sauce was a little too solid (felt more like a slaw than a dipping sauce). \\n\\nTwice-Cooked Lamb Belly Stirfry: Lamb belly tasted great, rich with flavor.   Unfortunately, for a $19 dish there is really not that much lamb included. Furthermore, the dish was way too saucy and as a result way too salty.\\n\\nPan-Roasted Soy Glazed Salmon: The salmon came with a very aesthetic crust and looks seared to perfection. However, the crust did not come apart no matter how much I tried to cut it. After biting into it, I realized it was tough like denim. It literally felt like I was eating someone's jeans. The salmon itself was delicious. The rice underneath was also soaked in sauce and way too salty.\\n\\nWe came to celebrate my birthday, and they did do a nice job of treating us. We had a reserved table with a \\"Happy birthday\\" sign. The lemony shrimp dumplings were provided for us on the house, which was much appreciated! Our waitress seemed in a rush and not too attentive. Nonetheless, I am pretty satisfied with the service.\\n\\nIn summary, the prices are sky-high considering the quality of the food provided. It is a nice location and it feels like they have a lot of potential with their fusion menu, but it's just not there yet."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My daughter and I stopped for lunch on our way to the airport.

I was pretty tempted to try their Glengoyne 18 year, but decide not tonight. \\n\\nThe food consists of your standard Mediterranean/Turkish fare. You can get kebabs and entrees. \\n\\nOne of the things on the menu is their Mixed Kebab Platter. It is enough for 4-6 people. If you have 4 hungry people and want mounds of protein, this is the platter to get. \\n\\nThe Mixed Kebab Platter comes with Beef (where you can choose the temp), chicken, lamb, and Doner. This is one of the few places in Atlanta where you can get Doner. Doner is very similar to Gyros. They cut it from the rotisserie into thin slices. The other meats were in big chunks that you can cut.\\n\\nUnderneath all the meat was the rice, soaking up the meat juice. The rice was perfectly cooked, buttery, and delicious.  It also came with 3 sauces to dip your meat in and some big chunks of tomato and peppers.\\n\\nFor appetizer, we tried their Baba Ganoush and hummus. They seemed to be freshly made in the kitchen. They were both good and creamy.\\n\\nThe Baba Ganoush is made from roasted eggplant so you can taste the smokiness. Instead of pita, it came with bread. I think the bread is given to everyone complimentary with olive oil. So I would've preferred a hot, freshly made pita, but the bread worked. \\n\\nThe service was friendly and great.

The bun was soft and tasted fresh baked. The French fries had just the right amount of crunch and were seasoned well. I enjoyed a Nutella Shake, that was topped with marshmallows. They even top them with nitrogen for a cool blast. Love it! \\n\\nNext time we visit, we hope to stop on to try new items off the menu. Thanks again for having us!"},{"name":"Babette's Cafe","address":"573 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've been to Babette's twice in the (almost) 5 years I have lived in Atlanta.  After my first visit I vowed \\"never again\\".  However, I have been craving cassoulet and Babette's is the only restaurant I could find with it on the menu this fall.  So, my husband and I gave it another try.  The tiny bar was full (read: 6 people) and the main restaurant was booked.  So, they put us on the patio which is covered and enclosed and heated.  The patio was lovely.  They struggled to keep the heat consistent...but they tried and I appreciate that.  \\n\\nIn a nutshell:  if you have been to France in recent memory or you know what good french food is (not back in 1970 during your gap year and you really can't recall what true french food is):  avoid this place at all costs.  It will disappoint and you will be left with a whole in your gastronomic heart.\\n\\nHere's how I will break it down:  Food, Wine, Service\\n\\nFood:  First trip, I went specifically because I was craving Beef Bourgignon.  What I got was tasteless beef stew that was more southern the french.  Last night:  I went specifically for the Cassoulet.  But, my husband was about 15 minutes before me so I ordered the Tuna Crudo.  It was ceviche.  No flavor of tuna...just lime flavored brownish cubes.  It was pathetic and not worth a second bite.  It went unfinished. The baguette was good.  But the butter could have used some sea salt.  That didn't stop me from making an entire meal out of the bread.  Because the \\"cassoulet\\" came next.  It kind of looked like cassoulet.  But it definitely didn't have that beautiful harvest essence.  It smelled flat.  That uniquely cassoulet flavor...that warms your cockles and makes your heart sing.  Ya, this didn't have that.  It had the right ingredients:  white beans, duck, lamb, pork, sausage.  But it had none of the flavor.  That great crunchy bread crumb topping was just soggy bread goo.  If I'd wanted miscellaneous meat stew, this would have done it (with more than few pinches of salt to give it flavor).  But I wanted to Cassoulet.  And this was not it.  I ate bread.  Somewhere in Carcassonne a french grandmother wept.  \\n\\nWine:  While waiting for my husband I really wanted a Coup du Champagne.  But at this \\"french\\" restaurant there was no champagne by the glass.  NO CHAMPAGNE BY THE GLASS.  However, I could get a mother luvin' prosecco!!!!!!  Somewhere in Reims a monk just fainted.  I ordered a french chardonnay and it was decent.  However, when my husband arrived and ordered a glass, and I switched to Rose to go with my pending \\"cassoulet\\". The rose was quite nice.  Dry and crisp but with a full nose.  \\n\\nService:  The owner kindly tried to adjust the temperature for us. But the waitress was gruff (and not in that charming french way).  As way of example:  the waitress brought our wine, not on a tray, but she held them both with her fists by the stems like a frau would hold a stein of beer (as opposed to holding the stem with her fingertips).  The optics were shocking in any restaurant let alone a french restaurant.  Somewhere in Paris a waiter just said \\"bof!\\" and clicked his heal as he turned and walked away defiantly.  And another example:  The cassoulet arrived:  It was presented with sarcasm \\"to say this dish is hot is an understatement...but I trust you two to be adults and to know to put your spoon in and then let it cool. It was just boiling you know.\\"...I can't make this up.  It's not fair to call her rude.  But unrefined and inconsistent with french dining would be accurate.  I'm sure she's nice. \\n\\nFrench dining is about atmosphere (which I think they approached closely enough), food (a two time miss), wine (no champagne by the glass, quelle horreur!) and service that is reverent.  \\n\\nI would have given this two stars but the Yelp definition of two stars is \\"Meh, I've had better\\".  As a family restaurant this would be considered Meh.  But as a french restaurant this is definitely \\"Eek, I think not.\\""},{"name":"Les Faux Bourgeois","address":"663 E 15th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant.

So close, yet so far away. \\n\\nThe filet medallions were good, but not as flavorful and as tenderly cooked as my previous steak at Eddie V's. The Brussels sprouts were over cooked and a bit too charred. The halibut was not as flavorful as the first time our friend got it. \\n\\nAll in all the experience was great, the staff was awesome, and the food is more than decent.

Therefore, I really don't think I can vouch for authenticity when it comes to cuisine, but I absolutely stand by my claim that The Clay Pit's Kabuli Chicken is one of the most delicious chicken dishes I've tasted. EVER (caps, bold, and at least 3 exclamation marks!). \\n\\nAre the dish's origins rooted in India or Afghanistan? I'm not sure, but The Clay Pit's self-proclaimed 'contemporary Indian' umbrella is probably how they get around the international influences that pepper their menu. And anyway - we're all influenced by existing brilliant ideas across all disciplines, no?\\n\\nAfter getting acquainted with my mango lassi (made from yogurt, water and flavored with loads of fresh mango pulp), the server delivered standard naan for me and a gluten-free flatbread (tandoori roti) for my friend. Emily was so impressed with the roti, and couldn't help but wonder aloud, \\"how have the Americans not yet mastered a satisfying gluten-free 'bread'?\\" Additionally, The Clay Pit's menu is stacked with gluten-free choices that are actually labeled as such. Most Indian restaurants naturally have a decent selection of wheat-free dishes, but going the extra step to clearly label was appreciated by my gluten-sensitive girlfriend.\\n\\nBy the time our Kabuli Chicken came out, we shouldn't have had enough remaining stomach real estate to finish the dish, but that's exactly what we did. Every. Last. Morsel. This specialty of the house is made by taking boneless chicken, cooking it in a korma sauce comprised of cashew-almond-pistachio cream sauce, garlic, shredded coconut and lemon and then infusing it with a paste of pureed nuts, raisins and cherries. This isn't an every day dish as it's outrageously rich, but this adventure in culinary hedonism is one your taste buds won't soon forget. Just writing the words makes me pine in pain!\\n\\nThe Clay Pit effortlessly dazzles with a sophisticated menu, well-curated wine list and a soft ambiance that's equally perfect for a date or catch-up session with an old friend. The only 'meh' about our experience? The service... though it was capable, it was less than friendly. But that's okay because I can live without smiles but I cannot, will not live without my Kabuli Chicken!\\n\\n$28/each including taxes and tip with bread, entrees, raita and a glass of wine and mango lassi."},{"name":"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse","address":"10515 N Mopac Expy","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I've been to the south BJ's location before (and one in Colorado) but I really enjoy this north one more for some reason. \\n\\nMy girlfriends and I went on a random Thursday around 6:45pm. The restaurant was surprisingly full, all the bar tables were full, and there was about a 10 minute wait to be seated which wasn't bad at all. We were promptly taken to our table which wasn't a booth but didn't feel like we were exposed like it sometimes feels when you're in the middle of a dining room.\\n\\nOur server was a little soft spoken but, in my opinion, hit all her marks in offering drinks, apps, etc. The girls and I were in the \\"trying\\" mood so we opted for quite a few things! Oh and we were there in time for happy hour which were a few bucks off beers and cocktails but none of that struck our fancy that time.\\n\\nFirst, we got a sample of the Berry Cider (hard cider!) and decided to get a pitcher of that. It was very delicious and tasted like berry champagne actually!\\n\\nThen we shared the appetizer sampler of mozzerella sticks (standard), spinach and artichoke dip with tortilla chips (actually very very tasty), avocado egg rolls (not bad), and the santa fe egg rolls (yummy). \\n\\nThe menu is very extensive but all looked great! I would find it hard to believe if someone didn't find something they liked here. So, our app plates were all cleared away and it actually took a little while for our entrees to come out but it wasn't too long that anyone said anything- but I know the girls were all thinking it too. I got the fish and chips which were tasty but were a little over fried (they were fried past the golden color and were a little more brown). I opted to try both fries- the thin and the wedge and both were good. The wedge fries reminded me of the fries from KFC. My friend got the parmesean crusted chicken and white cheddar mashed potatoes and she really enjoyed it and said they were some of the best potatoes she'd ever had. My other friends split the Mediterranean pizza and said they loved it as well. \\n\\nAfter our food was boxed up by the server tableside (nice touch), we ordered dessert. We split the oven baked beignet topped with strawberries, whipped cream, and a side of vanilla ice ceam. We also shared the red velvet cookie thingie (the actual name escapes me) which was also topped with ice cream. \\n\\nBy the end, needless to say, we were stuffed, satisfied, and probably had a pretty happy server since she probably wasn't expecting 4 girls to give her the ideal ordering experience from top to bottom! \\n\\nAll in all, I liked the food, the atmosphere is high energy, and there were all sorts of peole- couples, groups of friends, families, business associates, etc. I'll definitely keep BJ's on my list of places to take all of the above mentioned parties when in a bind!"},{"name":"Pintxo Pincho Tapas Bar","address":"385 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"Had the paella there today. the shrimp was not fresh, not cleaned and undercooked.

We figured she would probably take their drink order and then ours. WRONG. She took their drink order and left. We then thought that another server would probably take us. WRONG again. Another server came out and went to greet another party of two that had been seated more than five minutes after us. We still waited patiently as the server took the party of 4's FOOD order and then watched her go back inside. \\n\\nAt this point, after waiting almost 10 minutes at the table, we decided that we were not interested in giving our money (much less a tip) to an establishment that can't follow a simple procedure for picking up/greeting tables.

As we placed our order for a cheese and a pepperoni slice with some soda just the smells of the place were making me even hungrier.  Only complaint is my usual one, these guys went to a lot of trouble making a cool, hip spot with canned soda in a cooler instead of the old eight spout vender, and still they had only two diet options, Coke and Pepsi.  If you are trying to be hip and trendy try mixed it up with the low cal options!  Diet Dr Pepper, Diet Mountain Dew, Diet Root Beer... go nuts!  \\n\\nTwo huge slices of pizza came up from behind the counter.  We took seats outside the roll up doors and enjoyed the night air.

The brisket was very tender and smoky, though I really wanted it to be moister and fattier. The creamed corn was a bit of a let down since the corn was overcooked so it was pretty mushy. The bbq sauce was also a let down- very sweet and no depth/complexity. However, the brisket was pretty decent and a great price-  would certainly eat it again!"},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Woweeee wow wow. This place is a symbol of decadence. I have shared a gourdough's donut or two from the trailer before, and had the salty balls here once, but I had never embarked on their savory menu until a couple weeks ago. We had some friends in town from Toronto, and we figured this was the perfect place to take them to treat them to some good ol' 'Merican excess. \\n\\nI ordered the MotherClucker, which is the donut with fried chicken tenders on top and honey butter on the side. I actually wasn't really expecting much. I'm not sure why, since I know they have great reviews, but I just sort of expected their speciality to be the donuts/dessert. The fried chicken tenders were actually some of the best I've had. They're so tender and crispy and the flavor of the batter/chicken is just right. The honey butter was divine, and it was actually a fantastic meal. You can overdo it quickly here, but I found that having this plus sharing a dessert with four people left me feeling not to terrible after. They have really tasty mixed drinks, as well. \\n\\nThe salty balls were the perfect dessert for our small group. Plentiful enough for everyone to share and didn't require cutting anything up - some of the dessert donuts can be messy and loaded and not as easy to share. It's also like all of my favorite things in one dessert- donut holes, cream cheese icing, salted butter caramel sauce, and salty sweet roasted peanuts. It might very well land on my list of things I'd request for my last meal if I had the misfortune of ending up on death row. \\n\\nTwo in our group were too full from the general vacation eating to have anything big, so they had salads, which were really fresh looking and both of them enjoyed their meals. One salad came with a garlic donut which may or may not have been described as a garlic bread game changer. \\n\\nThe last of us had the chicken fried steak donut and that was just... nuts. It looked amazing, and she gave me a small piece of the steak and it was excellent. I'm by no means an expert on CFS (i had it once at the moonshine sunday buffet and that's it), but all I know is that one tasted good and if I had a hankering, I'd consider going to Gourdough's to quell the craving. \\n\\nWhile it's not a place you can go on the regular (unless you have great self control), it's a really unique joint that I'm glad we have in this town. And if you want to have just a balls to the wall unhealthy meal, this is one of the best options around. The food is of such good quality that it somehow lessens the guilt a bit - or at least makes the binge feel actually worth it."},{"name":"Don Pollo Bar & Grill","address":"1851 Corporate Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"1.5","text":"I've never had anything but a positive experience at don pollo. \\nIt's always packed and filled with people who enjoy both food and drink but also relaxed dancing. \\nI have never felt uncomfortable or out of place here.

We doctored it ourselves with limes from our margaritas and table salt and some salsa on the table. We ordered enchiladas; green and mole.

Note that most of the dim sum is otherwise kind of pricy.\\n\\nOne week later, we decided on a whim to go check it out. We got the just after 10am, and waited 10 minutes for a table.\\n\\nTip Two: Call to reserve ahead of time if you can. It'll definitely minimize your wait, and if you're trying to get in before the cut off time, they'll let you know whether you'll make it or not.\\n\\nWe sat down, and began ordering away. A good thing about the restaurant is that the food is paper ordered - a good indication that your food is always fresh and hasn't been circulating on a cart all morning. The downside: the order sheet is in Chinese.\\n\\nTip Three: they have an order book of all their dim sum with English translations. Added bonus: the translations are fairly accurate and don't have bad Chingrish.\\n\\nOur order: lobster dumplings ($$), golden creamy custard buns ($), enoki prawn rice roll ($), shrimp spring roll ($), whole abalone/chicken bun ($), deep fried squid tentacles ($$), shredded chicken with jelly fish ($$).  Our bill for 2 people came out to under $45, but we only ate a third of our dishes, and brought the rest home.\\n\\nTip Four: don't get the prawn rice roll.

And as a result competition is fierce and food quality is guaranteed! For our stop along the Feast Asian Dining Festival,  we decided on their signature dish, xiaolongbao, and stir fried rice cakes. Of course, when coming to Shanghainese places having xiaolongbao is a must. To up the notch we had the crab meat and pork XLB. The juices that were hidden inside these little delights are surely love at first sip! Followed by a bite of the dumping you taste clearly the crab meat and pork that pairs so well together. The Feastival signature dish, their egg whites and shrimp on broccoli is cooked well and when you mix in the egg yolk and black vinegar this imitation crab dish will give you a surprising mix of flavours and texture. The rice cakes with beef are stir fried well with the seasoning and is a good carb dish to combine with the rest of the food we have. The service from restaurant staff is quite friendly coming from a Chinese restaurant and the restaurant is spacious and inviting to stay.

Freshly made mochi-texture pancakes are filled with chocolate syrup. This is the best spot to satisfy some sweet tooth out there.\\n\\nWunderBar\\nYou can now enjoy a sip of the seasonal cocktails with some bites in this warm and cozy new attraction. I found the Charcuterie board is in good value, and this is just the perfect place to rest and get some warmth.\\n\\nBon Macaron Patisserie\\nAnother famous macaron shop also arrives to this year's Christmas Market.

We tried both fry options, parmesan truffle and green queso. I wouldnt mind eating those as my last meal on Earth-just saying.  The burgers were consumed too quickly to take a picture but take my word flr it, we're already craving another.  There are plenty of options to create the burger of your dreams. I personally like that most of the menu items are from local farms. \\nAs we passed the large bar area, we entered the drink station and kitchen/ ordering counter. Employees were ready to answer any questions you have and offer samples of the horseradish based sassy sauce, queso, etc. \\nIt got pretty hot in line as we approached the   Kitchen so we kicked up our drink options. We ordered a house margarita and were impressed with the taste of the house tequila. We were informed that their well options are more like a call level.

My husband and I had the cold chicken noodles and the spicy fried shrimp, (for the life of me cannot remember the name) which we got off of the Happy Hour Menu. We also had some of the \\"fancier, more expensive\\" sushi which was also fantastic. I definitely think if you're going for sushi, go for the more elaborate and expensive sushi. Because, the second time we visited, we had the spicy tuna roll and it was extremely bland. We were trying to be frugal this time around. Also, we wanted to try a different type of noodle, so we asked the waitress which to try. She told us she always recommends the Dan Dan and her customers always love it. Between the bland, boring Tuna Roll and the extremely fatty/oily Dan Dan noodles, my husband and I left frustrated we didn't just order what we had ordered in the past. Stick with what you know.

Hostess and waitstaff are very friendly and attentive. \\n\\nMy first impression of the menu is that there's a lot of eclectic choices some with more of a Moroccan flair than others. It is weird how much bacon is on the menu. Never experienced that in any restaurant claiming to be Moroccan inspired since it's not a food typically eaten in Morocco. However I enjoyed what I ordered. The lamb meatballs were very flavorful and the tomato stew definitely had a kick to it. It was a sizable portion but not over the top. Just perfect. Also ordered the side of potatoes with smoked cheddar and lemon aioli. The lemon aioli was probably the best I've ever had. The Harissa burger was very tasty and different. Served on a type of flat bread with the ground beef inside and the veggies on top and a nice side of baba ghanouj. Really enjoyed this dish. Different and perfect portions. For dessert I had small waffles. They are soft with just a touch of crispy around the edges. Sprinkled with a little powdered sugar. Chose a side of dark chocolate and mixed berry compote. Best waffle ever! The chai latte was also probably the best I've ever had in taste and presentation. Loved all the cinnamon they sprinkled on top. \\n\\nThe prices were a little higher than I had expected but not ridiculous.

Yelp/Google says open til midnight, and their own submission to @portlandmercury says 11:30. A sign on the door, which was still wide open, said \\"We're sorry but we have stopped seating for the night.\\" There was no indication of how long ago they stopped, so not even going in, we asked the server standing at the POS if even though they weren't seating folks, were we still able to grab a couple #burgers and peace out? The response she gave us was a two-fingered salute and then she went back to whatever she was doing. Couldn't even be bothered to acknowledge us with words, or even a polite non-verbal response. The smugness was thicker than the Bar Maven burger. This spot is out of the way. It's a destination stop in relationship to #burgerweek2018. And now, so what if I didn't get their burger? I'll never know if their food is any good. I will never go check them out. And I would encourage anyone else to do the same. It's been a minute since any place has treated me with such a lack of customer service. Nevermind that even if the burger had been garbage, we would have been singing the praises of this spot. A simple \\"Sorry, no\\" would have sufficed. The rudeness of this server, who couldn't be bothered to acknowledge potential customers, has so soured my taste for them that I'm taking the time to let you know about it.

It was our last place to try before getting on the road and heading back to Dallas. We originally went to Franklin's and were told they were just about out of food upon walking up the stairs to the entrance. I must say Franklin's running out of food worked in our favor because Terry's was nothing short of delicious. \\n\\nI have heard several times that Austin as the best barbecue in Texas, so when I planned a mini family vacay, barbecue was number one on my food list. I had a brisket sandwich, creamy corn, green beans and peach cobbler. Let me say that if you haven't been to Texas, expect portion sizes to be well over decent. \\n\\nThe brisket melted in my mouth. I watched the guy cut the brisket in front of me as I was telling him what I wanted, and the way he was cutting the brisket made it quite obvious that it was going to be good. It had just enough flavor to where it wasn't overwhelming with flavor, yet I was still able to appreciate the tenderness of the brisket with every chew. \\n\\nThe creamy corn was nothing I had ever tasted before. It is the definition of creamy, so if creamy is not your thing, I would not recommend the corn. It's sweet without losing the taste of the corn. The green beans were standard. They were good considering I feel it is very difficult to mess up green beans. \\n\\nMy favorite dessert is peach cobbler, and I'm not sure what possessed me to even taste the peach cobbler because I'm very picky about it, but even having saved it because I was so full, hours after getting back to Dallas I finally tried it and I was very impressed! Neither the crust nor the peaches were overpowering each other. There was nothing that I felt that could have been added to it, or taken from it. \\n\\nOverall my time at Terry Black's was a success. The line was long upon arrival, however, it moves pretty quickly. The staff is nice and helpful. The seating is open-seating, so the only down fall about that is if you have a large party (mine had 10), you'll most likely have to wait for enough seating to open up. There is outdoor seating as well.\\n\\nIf you're in Austin, I definitely recommend trying this place, rather you're a barbecue fan or not!

Our server after seeing I clearly had straw came over placed the straw on the table. I told her no thank I have one already her reply was, \\"I'm sorry I was to slow for you\\".  Then it was my order, of eggs scrambled hard the same as my peer.  After receiving my plate, and my peer sent the sunny side over easy extra hard back our server comes over and says to me, \\"I wrote down you said something else....\\" at this point enough I requested to speak to a manager.

All I knew is that olives are pretty much the key essential item in Greece. Then one day, my sister bragged about how she went over to her Greek friend's house and had all kinds of delicious food. I got jealous, so I dragged my boyfriend to Kyma, the only Greek restaurant I know of in Atlanta.\\n\\nSadly and stupidly, I forgot to make a reservation, so we ended up waiting for 30 minutes.  While waiting, we were just staring at the cars outside of restaurant. It felt like I came to a motor-show.

My 30 minute wait was totally worth my time.\\n\\nSince it was our first time having Greek food, we wanted to taste little bit of everything. So we chose to do Mezes Tasting. We ordered Saganaki, Spanakopita, Kefte, Avgolemono, and Romaine Lettuce Salad. Greek spreads are complimentary with Mezes Tasting. We enjoyed everything but the Avgolemono and salad. They were simply too tangy and sour. We do love trying new and different things, but this was just too much. For dessert, we ordered traditional Greek cookies. They were all delicious, but not as unique as I thought they would be.\\n\\nI would definitely go back to Kyma to dine again. It's a lovely restaurant and heavenly food.

However taking off two stars for problems encountered due to poor service and misunderstanding of ADA laws by one of your employees.\\nWe met our daughter and her boyfriend there to celebrate her birthday. We drove from San Antonio because it is her favorite BBQ place. We chose a time between lunch and dinner to make it easier for me. I have some disabilities and find it easier not to be in large crowds. When we got there, there was about a 15 minute wait. There were six of us and waiting in line would have been very hard on me. I also had recent hand surgery and could not carry a tray anyway. We were ordering family size portions of meat and some sides. My daughter was worried about me so she found a table that could accommodate the size of our group. It had not even been cleaned yet. She asked me to sit there while they were getting the food. A few minutes later, a busboy (man) came up and immediately asked me why I was there without food. Before I could even explain completely he interrupted and said \\"I guess you couldn't read the sign\\", and motioned to the sign at the end of the table. I explained to him that I was disabled, my family was already in line to get our food and he said \\"That's not the same as having your food already\\". He then told me I should get up and wait on the bench nearer to the line and walked away. He did clean the table. I texted my husband to find out if they had already ordered and my husband told me they were next in line. Just then the employee came back with two women who already had their food and told them to sit at my table. There were two booths open by this time, which were smaller and would have been better for two women, while we had six in our party. The women looked confused. One asked if it was community dining because I was there and he said \\"She shouldn't be here because she doesn't have food yet\\". I explained again that I was disabled and my family was already getting food. The ladies looked sympathetic and said \\"that's okay, stay right there\\" and went into one of the booths. When the rest of my family got to the table (about 7 minutes after he told me to leave), they were so upset that we probably would have left if we were not so hungry and did not already have our food. My husband and daughters really wanted to get desert but did not want to get it until we finished the lunch. My husband thought he could go back and get desert and bypass the line but when he tried that he was told that you could bypass the line only if you are going back for more meat or sides. So y'all missed out on our desert order and we moved our party to Amy's ice cream. By the way, I am 61 years old, can walk but have mobility problems and a chronic leg wound which I am not supposed to stand on for more than a few minutes. I walk with a limp and have balance problems. Getting up and down is hard for me and my right hand is completely bandaged because of my recent surgery and a finger amputation. I don't like to take advantage of my situation and it was very embarrassing to have to explain my situation more than once. The customers were much more understanding than your employee who should be educated in ADA requirements. The next time our daughter wants us to meet her for lunch or dinner in Austin I guess we will need to find a full service restaurant that is more accommodating to disabled diners.\\nJeannette Gonzales, San Antonio TX"},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"With all the talk about long waits, we came thirty minutes before a weekday opening at 7:30 AM.

We have heard so many people rave about their pizza.\\n\\nThe major things to note are Halwani is kind of hidden off of Grandview Avenue, almost behind the Big Lots, blink and you could easily miss it.  Next, the hours are a little different than your typical restaurant.  They are open Tuesday through Saturday, but they do not open until 5pm (later than normal), but they stay open until 3:30am, so if you are looking for a late night bite after a night out....Halwani's is your place.  They also deliver, in case you can't drive late at night, they will bring you your pizza.\\n\\nNow, if you have ever heard of Halwani Cuisine, than I am certain you have heard someone recommend their Tandoori Chicken pizza.  It has Indian hot sauce, marinated grilled chicken, Indian Tandoori spices, and jalapenos on it.  This particular pizza has to be one of their best sellers.  So of course, I had to order it.  I was a little concerned that it may be too hot for me, but when in Rome.  \\n\\nWe choose take out.  When we got our pizzas home they were still warm.  I took one bite into my Tandoori Chicken Pizza and I knew my mouth was in for a party.  So many flavors happening all at once.

I really did like the flavor, I just couldn't take it after a while.  I ended up being hungry but unable to finish my pieces of pizza.  Maybe I'm a wimp.\\n\\nWe also ordered the cheezy garlic bread, and if I were you, I would skip ordering that.  Or if Halwani reads this, they will realize there is huge room for improvement since their pizzas are sooo good, so maybe they will improve the garlic bread?\\n\\nOverall I would say that Halwani is the perfect late night pizza place.

First off, the service was awful. We did not have reservations so we put our names down and they said it was a 30 minute wait, which was expected, so we put our names down and they said they would text us. We got a text that our table was ready so we returned to the restaurant and went to the host stand. She was frazzled because she had just given our table away to a different group so we had to wait longer. This was extremely frustrating. We finally got seated and it took 15 minutes to get water and have our order get taken. Bad service overall. \\n\\nIn regards to the food, I was not impressed. The best thing we had was the Caprese salad, simply because of the fact that they were fresh heirloom tomatoes which were delicious. The lobster fra diavolo was overpriced and very hard to eat. The lobster came in half a shell, which they should have mentioned on the menu because it was a very fussy food. The rest of the seafood was decent, however, I really enjoyed the spicy red sauce. The pizzaiola was plain and tasted like something you could get anywhere. The chicken did not have much flavor and it seemed like minimum effort was put into the dish. We got the lobster fettuccine in the spicy red sauce instead of the pink cream sauce. The lobster itself was fresh and had a good taste, but the pasty was over cooked and chewy. \\n\\nBoth lobster dishes were $36, which was overpriced in my opinion.\\n\\nDefinitely would not recommend going here, there are a lot of restaurants in this particular area, so I would go somewhere else."},{"name":"Bijou Cafe","address":"132 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I had originally planned to go to Mother's Bistro, but there was an hour wait there so this was my backup.

The proximity helps of course but I am a fan of the good food, cleanliness, and warm atmosphere.\\n\\nI feel there are good reviews already about the quality of food here so I will concentrate on the staff and service. It is operated and I am assuming owned by a Greek family of three. Aside from the father, mother, daughter, and chef I have seen no one else working there. That, however, is a big reason I keep coming back. They make an effort to get to know everyone regardless, it seems, if they believe they will ever see you again or not. I can testify to this as I often study there (free WiFi I might add) and I see them display the same warm and welcoming demeanor to everyone that enters. I've always loved these so called \\"mom and pop\\" businesses and this place has only reinforced my belief.\\n\\nThe only reason I give it 4/5 is because of the hours. As I hinted at I used to study here, used to because when they first opened they had longer hours but have since cut down. It is understandable I suppose as, I have explained, it appears that only the family and one chef works there. Ever since the hours have been changed I find it harder and harder to have a chance to come in. I believe it is especially unfortunate that this place is closed on Sundays as that would be the PERFECT time for such a place to be open.

I said no thanks, I still have plenty. Soon after that, I was asked again. No thanks, I still have plenty. Then, as I was still shoving food in my mouth, she asked if my husband and I wanted boxes. He said yes, I said nothing. (Can you just let me eat?) She boxed his food and then stood next to me, watching me eat. (Awkward) She asked if I wanted her to come back later with a box. I told her I had only had my salad for 10 min and that I would just finish eating (I was a little annoyed by then).  Then, the server said not to be rushed, we can take our time, because they don't need the table. (Gee, what a relief.

Overall, tasty and reasonably priced food, great drink selection and friendly service."},{"name":"Rafiki Bistro","address":"1682 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"So I saw the crappy reviews, but I knew something maybe you didn't - THOSE reviews are for the OLD Rafiki.   The new Rafiki has a new chef, a new menu (French Provencal), a brilliant staff, and a planet (and flavor) conscious attitude.\\n\\nThere are two kinds of places that you want to go back to over and over again.  The first is an intimate space, for yourself and a friend or a date, where you know what you like and you savour your meal, maybe share an item or two.  The second is the kind of place you'd go with a group, share everything, talk and toast and laugh and dine.  Rafiki, I think, manages to be both places.\\n\\nOn this experience, I came items with a modest group, which allowed us to share and try a lot of different menu items.  Let me break them down for you:\\n\\nClassic French Onion Soup - I shall not lie, this was not my favorite onion soup ever.  I like my onion soup to be beefy and heavy and rich and this was not that.   This managed to have all the elements of comfort food and still somehow be light and lovely.  So, you know, it's not my favorite ever, but it's still really damned good, and, probably, more authentic than the heavy stew I often crave.\\n\\nPetite Cassoulet (with duck confit, andouille sausage, white beans, and a little homemade soda bread biscuit) - Already, here, I'm picking up a theme that you'll see me repeat item after item.   This is a stew.  More specifically, a sausage and bean stew.  Had I made this at home it would have been also delicious, but it would have also been a heavy brick that would sink to the pit of your stomach and insist on being the meal itself.  Despite being all sausage and beans and thick and stewy, the petite cassoulet also managed to be airy and gentle on your palate and your stomach, which works out well, because you're going to want to eat your main course.\\n\\nTuna Tartare (which citrus and other yumminess) - This was a palate cleanser and, also, delightful.  Twas simple and, yes, light.\\n\\nPolenta Napolean - Of the starters, this was my favorite.   The flavors here were simultaneously simple and complex.  I literally fought with one of my dining companions over the last bite (think \\"hungry Hungry Hippos,\\" seriously, that's the comment that was made from another)!\\n\\nPan-Seared Duck Breast - Oh my.   Dude.  I don't even like duck.  This was like a steak.  A sweet and savory pile of deliciousness that luckily landed in my mouth.  While so many of the dishes that I expected to be heavy turned out to be light, this dish I expected to be light, and it was pleasantly rich and filling instead.   I am rethinking my future desires to order duck.\\n\\nSeared Scallops - The part I likes best about this was the grapefruit salad.  Citrus is a strong trend in the foods and it definitely lends itself well to seafood.   While my least favorite of the entrees, it was still very good.\\n\\nHandmade Gnocchi Filled with Goat Cheese - Dear Boyfriend, I am really really really really really really really sorry I didn't order an extra plate of these for takeout to bring home to you.  You're not angry with me because you just DON'T KNOW what you missed, but when I bring you here and feed you this, your anger will be retroactive and, for that, I am sorry in advance.  Oh.  My.  Effing.  God.   These things are giant, filled with wonderful goat cheese, and then... then.. FRIED.\\n\\nFor dessert we were lucky enough to sample something not yet on the menu - a stacked crepe cake with layers of marscapone cheese in a citrus raspberry sauce.  This thing starts off tart and just barely sweet but finishes in your mouth as rich and buttery while still, somehow, being (*surprise!*)... light.\\n\\nThe cocktails we sipped through the evening were well crafted (or well poured - if wine - and I appreciate the correct glassware choices) and the staff  was all delightful.\\n\\nIt was a slow night, so our entire group had an opportunity to chat with the co-owner Dan, Chef Jeff Burgess, and several other staff members, many who I missed because I fell into a long and engaging conversation with Dan who's passion for getting the right ingredients from the right sources is legitimately inspired (also, this dude is mad interesting, so if you've got a chance for a chat, take it).   Chef Jeff was also passionate about his work and took the time to explain what goes into every bite.\\n\\nOkay, so this place is not cheap, but for upscale French dining with as many locally sourced seasonal ingredients reasonably possible (sometimes, you know, flavor comes first), it's really inexpensive for what you're getting, and, also, worth every penny.\\n\\nI will absolutely be back."},{"name":"Babica Hen Cafe","address":"15964 Boones Ferry Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"The Bloody Mary flights oh my!\\n\\nFood is great.

I'm don't think I will every forget that first bite... these tacos are legit!!!! MUST TRY. \\n\\nThe fish taco here is also pretty damn good. Sometimes a fish taco can lack flavor as typically tilapia is a bland fish, but this was far from that However, the Al Pastor taco was a bit disappointing. \\n\\nNext to the pick up point is a little table where you collect sauce. One is green, the other is red and there is also a salsa. I've had both green and red said with Mexican food before but there are something else. So punchy and full of flavor.

Couldn't even bear to look at the half left on my plate.  \\n\\nHubby and I were thrilled to take advantage of their Labor Day special, buy one entree, get the second free.

He was attentive and professional and inventive as well.  When I said I liked the scallop app but not the black bean sauce it comes with, he had them bring out 3 little ramekins of different sauces for me to dip em in.  When we orderd \\"Fries\\" he heard \\"Rice\\" and then insisted we keep the rice and still brought out the fries as well and ended up not charging for either!  He was amazing and as a side note:  He looks a little like Vince Young.  yum.\\n\\nSo yeah, after our app, I had the snapper with Jonah crab (sitting in a butter sauce), the creamed spinach almondine (really creamy good), the crab fried rice (again very buttery and saucey but we were so glad for that mistake.  It was fabulous!) and the french fries.   I think I just threw up in my mouth a little.  Having a litte Post Gustatory Distress Syndrome.  Hubby ordered the prime rib which arrived on the bone, perfectly cooked.  Hubby was very very happy.  \\n\\nOverall, I would give it 3 stars as the food (at least that I had) was fairly one-note and that note was butter.

To be fair, I did quite enjoy everything at Medina - the decor, the service, the food, it was all pretty good. The fact is though, that after waiting for an hour to get in, I expect everything to be better than \\"pretty good,\\" and it just didn't quite get to that level.\\n\\nAfter reading so many rave reviews, I came here with a pretty good idea of what I wanted to try - the lavender latte, and also waffles FOR SURE. I also got the salmon fume, which came presented like two open-faced sandwiches - basically just two pieces of bread topped with salad and avocado and smoked salmon cream cheese and one egg. It was a pretty light breakfast, but definitely very delicious. I do wish there was just more in terms of quantity though, and especially with the egg... like only one seemed a bit stingy to me. But the smoked salmon cream was so flavourful and satisfying and went well with the egg on the one piece of bread it was on.\\n\\nMy friend got the paella, which looked really good and looked a lot more filling than my dish. I tried a bit, and while I think it was good, it was way too spicy for me with the spicy salsa and the spicy chorizo.\\n\\nEveryone raves about the waffles here, but to me they were just good and not amazing. Like yes, they were pretty fluffy and moist, but I think I actually would have preferred a little more crunch around the edges. And neither of the sauces I tried really stood out to me that much. The lavender flavour didn't really come through that much in the milk chocolate lavender sauce, although you could kind of smell it a bit. And the consistency of the white chocolate pistachio rosewater was just odd and surprisingly watery... it kind of reminded me of condensed milk actually. I could actually taste a light rosewater flavour, which I enjoyed, but overall I wasn't wowed.\\n\\nSame with the lavender latte - nothing special for me, I could barely taste the lavender at all, so it was disappointing.\\n\\nMedina is not a bad place for brunch, and I wouldn't be opposed to coming back if the wait time wasn't so long.

Honestly, I couldn't find a single flaw in Veracruz All Natural's taco game. The tortillas were doughy without being undercooked. They had the perfect pliability. The size was right.

The chicken curry was fantastic and they kept refilling the rice whenever it was getting low so attentiveness was on point. \\n\\nWe had a whole issue trying to split the bill but the waiter was very patient with us and when we almost overpaid by a few cents, he brought it to our attention. At one point when we were there, a guy in crutches came in and the only available table was far away. I couldn't quite hear what the waiter said but at the guy responded with something along the lines of, thanks so much but we'll be okay. It seems the waiter was trying to come up with a solution, which is a very kind gesture. \\n\\nGreat people, and just checked online and they say there's free delivery within a 2 mile radius.

First off, there was plenty of parking.  This is no longer a small thing in Austin.  There have been many times when I've wanted to go to a certain place, but gave up when I couldn't find a place to park.\\n\\n2nd thing: it felt comfortable when I walked in. Lots of space, lots of tables, an area of sauces and rubs you could buy (plus T-shirts).  There were signs directing you where to go and what to do; I appreciated that.  The feeling of comfort--that's not a small thing, either.  Some call it feng shui, I just call it good design.  \\n\\n3rd thing: You start with an area of sides.  You grab a tray; there are to-go containers and lids conveniently on the top of the hot & cold serving areas.  I got small containers of mac & cheese, creamed corn, and cole slaw.  There was a no-nonsense woman there keeping the serving trays full, neat & clean, and answering questions when needed.  There were lots of choices of sides; you can look at the online menu to see them all.  I like beans & I like rice, but I wasn't going to waste belly space on those that night.\\n\\n4th thing: then, someone directs you to the next counter than has 3 areas of people slicing meat and ringing you up.  I got 3 thick slices of brisket and a full link of jalape√±o & cheese sausage.  They wrapped it all up nicely and put it in a bag for me.  That turned out to be enough for 2 meals for me.  The total was around $20.\\n\\nI'm a single guy.  I cook for myself a lot. Sometimes it's really good, sometimes it just makes me not be hungry any more.  I appreciate good food, but c',mon, even mediocre brisket isn't bad.  This was exceptionally good.  As I took my first bite, I said \\"whoa, that's good\\" to my TV.  I'm hardly ever moved to talk to my TV, so that's an indication how good it was.  I enjoyed every bite.  And the leftovers were just as good the next night.\\n\\nOne thing I'd change is to replace the styrofoam to-go containers with something a little more environmentally friendly.  But, that's a minor thing compared to the quality of the food, and certainly won't make me reject this place as one of my favorites for BBQ."},{"name":"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse","address":"10515 N Mopac Expy","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I have tried to always give BJs some leniency because I know how much pressure corporate puts on the local employees.

That being said they have been terrible several times and have made no attempt to care at all so now I might as well say what I want. \\n\\nI have had managers argue with me over steak temperature here. I would understand if you have been a real steakhouse manager, but BJs can barely get chicken right so no manager from BJs gets to talk down to me. Also here is a crazy concept: cook to order! If your client wants their food that they are paying for cooked a certain way then why not just do that? On my last visit even the waitress admitted that she noticed, other staff notice and customers often comment on how steaks are over cooked. \\n\\nThis last time around we got placed on the back burner while the waitress tended to a twenty plus top. She easily could have squeezed us in, but chose not to. She said she called for help, but help never came. We never saw a manager. What kind of manager lets his staff struggle like that? Only one that needs to be fired. \\n\\nI know to ask ahead of time if an item is on the menu, in this situation the pork chop. She confirms it is available then 25 minutes later tells me its not. Twenty five minutes later! No manager. At that point the lazy worthless manage should be fired because BJs used to have standards which I guess they have dropped.

It wasn't hard to find a table on a Thursday night but I could definitely picture this place getting crowded on a Friday or Saturday night, during happy hour etc...TV's everywhere to watch the game, good crowd!\\n\\nOnly 3.2 Miles from the Sam Adams Brewery, you know you're getting some fresh stuff!  Ooooh, I love Boston!!  Ordered the buffalo wings, 1 pound (10 wings) for about $6.95 or 2 pounds (20 wings) for $9.95...good stuff!, good quality wings...plenty of meat on them, good texture, good taste (although the spicy wasn't - wish they could deliver some heat!).\\n\\nSeeing the menu was filled with attempts at Mexican food like burritos & fajitas, as well as BBQ like ribs, etc, the BBQ Brisket seemed pretty safe...and it was, no better or worse than that though.  The portions where huge, even for a guy like me who usually cleans his plate.  My buddy got the fajitas, which arrived on 3 plates...yeah, that was too much food too...\\n\\nService wasn't great, and trying to pay the check wasn't good at all...we met some friends there later in the night who wanted to split their part of the check...\\"Please put the Blue Moon and the margarita on this card...\\" - so the waitress brought another blue moon and another margarita, took my cash to cover the entire bill and couldn't fix it without 30 minutes of waiting and headache...she blamed us because SHE didn't understand, that's really bad customer service.  After all that, we still ended up losing money on the transaction, we just gave up and checked out McGreevy's on the next block.\\n\\nSpeaking of the service, some of the waitresses there are dressed in daisy dukes and tight t-shirts...its just a shame none of them are attractive :( the bartenders were pretty cute though, wearing fitted tank tops which were just as seasonally inappropriate as their tans :)\\n\\nBottom line, follow the rules...have some beer, have some wings, don't make the bill too complicated...you'll have a great night!!"},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Marginally good food, Poor services and a Limited menu\\n\\nI have lived in East Boston all my life and can say, Stay Away!!!!"},{"name":"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse","address":"10515 N Mopac Expy","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Pretty good.

Always the fatty brisket. It is AMAZING.  It is on the salty side so be prepared to get a punch of seasoning on your first bite. It's always cooked perfectly and I always leave satisfied. I like to make a brisket sandwich with white bread, a load of pickles, brisket (of course) and a ton of the sweet bbq sauce. Trust me, your life will be changed by this combination of deliciousness. \\n\\nThe sides never look appetizing to me. I've only tried the Mexican rice which is really good. Some of my visitors have tried the coleslaw and the green beans and enjoyed both. \\n\\nBecause I don't eat the sides, I really wish there was a line for people who just want meat. The line is usually out the door and is often slowed down immensely by people choosing their sides, deciding on the size, and leisurely scooping their choices because the sides are set up cafeteria or buffet style.

I really had high hopes for this place since A. I live so close to it and B. They took over Forest Cafe which was amazing. Unfortunately, now I'm pretty sad Forest Cafe is gone. \\n\\nI started off with the Chai Latte which was awesome. I think i will return for a to-go coffee before work one day because its the only thing I enjoyed. As I sat at the bar, I realized the ledge was a little too big, while my legs were too cramped. Not a good start for someone who's 6'2. It also took them a while to realize I was there and hand me a menu, a lil annoying. Finally I ordered the chicken burger stuffed with harvarti cheese, sauteed onions and garlic aioli. The bartender  asked if I wanted fries, sweet potato fries or a mixed salad with that. As soon as I ordered the fries, the bartender started to rave about how good they were--Raising a critical foodies expectations is a no-no. \\n\\nGiven that I was only 1 of about 6 patrons at the time, I thought my burger would come out fairly quickly, at most 15 minutes. It took about 30, and the bartender apologized due to how backed up the kitchen was (BS). The burger had was not stuffed with cheese, didn't have the tomato the bartender said came with it, the onions were raw not sauteed, and there was no aioli in sight. I had to send it back for at least the tomato and aioli, I had no patience to mention the cheese or onions. Yet, I did come back quickly with an apology from the chef. \\n\\nAnd now the taste of the dish.  The fries were brown, soggy and flavorless. Another bartender said, \\"arent the fries just amazing?\\" I replied with a request for salt. The burger was a little dry and over spiced. All the juice seemed to have soaked the bottom bun, making me wish I had asked for the cheese. \\n\\nHonestly, this place is about 3 days old so I will probably give them another chance, maybe over dinner.

Thankfully they were able to immediately provide us a two seater since everyone ahead of us had a bigger party.\\n\\nFood: I went with The Boylston which is a generous portion of haddock on some of the softest brioche I've ever had the pleasure of sinking my teeth into, creamy avocado mayo, lettuce, tomato, and a side of chipotle slaw. The sandwich was very well proportioned and had a double layer of fish which was definitely needed considering the thickness of the bread. The real standout for me though was the chipotle slaw, creamy, crunchy, a slow pleasant buildup of heat/spice on your taste buds. I always appreciate when a place goes out of their way on the sides/ secondary part of the dish. If they nail this I've found it means respect is given to everything they offer.  My lady got the Regal Regis, again super impressive on all accounts, packed with delicious marinated flank steak and accompanied by a respectable side of potato salad. We also got a  1/2 order of their Onion rings which was certainly big enough for two people assuming they each have their own separate meal. I love onion rings of all shapes and sizes, but the wife is very persnickety when it comes to onion rings. She rarely likes them, but decided to humor me because she's just awesome that way. She was super impressed with the flavor, the lack of greasiness, and the fact that she didn't experience heartburn after the fact (she said 1st time that she can remember not getting heartburn after onion rings).\\nAmbiance/Service: The place has outside seating with big umbrellas that would be quite nice on a cool day. Inside there are plenty of pedestal tables and tables again the wall with booth seating on the wall side. Our waitress was friendly, but efficient (not overly chatty) which I'm sure was appreciated by everyone given how busy they were.

Although it was my least fave, it was still really good; I'm just not a fan of the kick at the end for my donut. \\n2) Blueberry Bourbon Basil- fresh to death, this was my favorite. It was my pick too! The flavor was so fresh and non-artificial, you could get the hints of basil after the blueberry flavor. Amazing. \\n3) Passion Fruit w/ Chocolate Nibs- flavors are in your face, not artificial again but tart. Each bite was a flavorful kick. I couldn't really notice the chocolate too much. \\n\\nStumptown coffee available. \\nSeating in the windows to people watch and the donut making was so open. It was very cool.

Everyone was so kind and made sure to explain what each dish and the dressing was as they brought it to the table, and always made sure we were doing ok! The music and lighting was just right as well. The restaurant itself may seem a tad small, but that is due to the sheer number of people in there at all times- it is always busy! Which means the food is super great. Sirae genuinely cares about her customers, her service, and her job which made this a top notch experience.

Really good value for the amount of wings in a serving and they were tasty too. The wings were a touch bloody on the inside which was a little off putting. They had a great crunch to them though and the skin was perfect, I would have just deep fried them a little longer to make sure the center wasn't slimy.

My friend ordered Saumon Fum√©, which was supposed to be a popular dish, but we didn't understand why it was so popular. I didn't taste the salmon as much as I wanted to and the bread was a little tough to cut. After our entrees, we ordered Belgian waffles and I was really disappointed in it as soon as I cut the waffles with my knife. I already knew from that point that was waffles weren't cooked fully as there was no crisp and crunchy sound. As soon as I bit into it, the batter was mushy. I thought they were known for their Belgian waffles, but they were a disappointment and failed to their expectations.

This is some of the best food I've ever tasted. I've tried everything on the menu, and it's all fantastic. The pork belly buns are truly the best I've ever had. They totally blow East Side King out of the water. Each bun contains a really generous portion of wonderfully marinated pork, with the perfect blend of sweet and savory. You'll be glad that you get two with each order, because you won't want to stop after the first one. The finely chopped peanuts, cilantro, and pickled veggies make this to die for. Their Braised Pork Rice has a delicate, clean flavor that just waltzes its way down your mouth. The Chicken Bites melt in your mouth as well, pleasantly set off by the slightly sweet and crunchy coating. \\n\\nThe boba milk tea my not be what you typically expect \\"bubble tea\\" to be like--it's not super-sweet, which apparently is a more authentic, and I actually prefer it. It would be nice to have more flavors offered in the future. \\n\\nAlex and Shirley work really hard to give excellent service. So hard, in fact, that you may have to wait a little while to get your food. It's part of the growing process, and I'm sure they'll get that streamlined in the future. These guys make it worth it--often they've offered free water, thrown in extra treats and even boba tea if the wait is excessive. Besides, if you can wait four hours for barbecue at Franklin's, you can certainly wait 20 minutes to an hour (depending on food availability--this stuff will sell out!) for food that you're hard pressed to find anywhere else around here. \\n\\nHaving known these guys for a while and knowing what other tasty creations Shirley has cooked up, it's definitely worth coming back again and again to not only more of the core menu but to see what other options get thrown into the mix."},{"name":"Pier 6 Boston Waterfront","address":"1 8th St","city":"Charlestown","stars":"3.5","text":"My grandson raved about his experience there a few weeks ago, so we decided to go for lunch.

However, given all the different Asian influences all kinda mushed together in the menu, some great (Taiwanese and regional Chinese) some meh (Indonesian, Thai, Korean), altogether, this menu strikes me as \\"jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none.\\" Multiple visits, multiple dishes and no dish has ever made me want to come back for seconds, and in some cases, the dish gave me the case of Sad-Eater-Face (I'm looking at you too fake nasi goreng. SIGH). The thing about eating street food in Asia, whether it is in Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia or Thailand, is that the best street hawkers make a business of selling a total of ONE main dish that they're known for and whatever that dish is, it is perfect. The hawkers just don't survive if they are mediocre b/c competition is cut throat. \\n\\nBut, one may argue, Myers & Chang is different--a trendy full-service restaurant that serves lots of white people with disposable income in Boston, a city that has lots of exceptionally shitty Chinese food in general. And yes, to people that haven't had the food and flavors from the original places of origin, Myers & Chang is an upgrade to the sick sad world of Asian food specifically in Boston.

They arrange a number of cold salads on the left hand side, which included a cabbage slaw, chickpea kale salad, a pickled \\"kimchi-like\\" side dish (maybe to go along with the veggie momos?), a spicy chili oil- bitter melon side dish, and more. I got to try a little bit of everything and they were all very fresh and considerately made! \\n\\nHot items included curry chicken, basmati rice, potato + cauliflower curry, chicken + mushroom, double-cooked pork with a braised chayote, veggie momos, steamed tofu + napa cappage, and a lo-main noodle-like item with peanut sauce. All were really delicious and appropriately seasoned (not salty or really greasy like how most awful Chinese buffets can be). I've never had Tibetan food before and this was a nice, inoffensive introduction. \\n\\nFinally, you had the option of eating freshly-cut fruits for dessert. Overall, an excellent spread of choices that allow meat-eaters and vegetarians to find tasty and suitable options! The bill came out to a little under $16 per person which I think is definitely reasonable since I came out of there STUFFED!\\n\\nOf note, the wait staff were VERY attentive to our tables, cleaning plates and refilling our cups of water frequently and kindly (totally non-intrusive or bothersome)!

Its all small plates and the menu changes frequently based on seasonal items. You won't find the menu online so just go. They have a few items that are always there. We usually get the bread and butter, flank steak, and greens off the regular menu and then pick out a bunch of veggies and meat items from their other menu. The portions can be rather small, which is why we love it so much, as we can order a ton of different items. The wine list is extensive and we always joke about how they probably just pull some wine from a box (they don't) but the wine is a bit of a let down. Dessert is amazing! They usually have a red velvet cake, almond cake and chocolate cake (among others) sitting on the counter. For me personally, that's my perfect dessert. We love this place and will keep coming back.

I've never had a bad burger here and the fries/tots are delicious. Service is always slow though- think 15 minutes to get your milkshake because the server has to make them not an expo. \\n\\nFor service: The first time we went it was really busy and we didn't wait to long for anything, just didn't get drink refills or the check for a long time. The 2nd time we went there was literally 2 other tables in the restaurant and we didn't get a server for 20 minutes- considering you get sat by a hostess this is hard to believe. Once we did get a server she forgot about us and we had to ask the manager to grab her, but he ended up giving us a new server completely. And to top it all off we had a 2 for 1 burger coupon (dining out passbook) and they wouldn't accept it. We had one for the first visit and used it without an issue, but the second visit they wouldn't take it- we had 2 passbooks because we got a few for Christmas. \\nThis last visit was a Saturday night, we had a reservation and were sat promptly. The drinks and boozy milkshake came almost right away, but the one non boozy milkshake took 15 minutes to get and only came after I reminded the server. Then when our order came out there was so much confusion from the kitchen of what food belonged to our table. They set a burger and tots down, walked away, came back, took it back because it didn't belong to our table, and then I watched them take it to a different table. I've been a server before and I would never leave someone else's food at a table, walk away and then take it to a different table.\\n\\nFood and drink: The boozy milkshakes are great, and a few select non-boozy ones are also good.

As I was walking through the neighborhood, I found Myers + Chang and decided to stop here for lunch. I heard fabulous things about their ramen and even though their tea-smoked ribs looked amazing, I choose to order the shrimp and tofu ramen. The ramen was not what I expected. First, the noodles honestly looked like it came from an instant ramen package. It also tasted like instant ramen so my guess is that it is not fresh ramen. Second, the broth had this unique but rather weird flavor to it. At times it tasted sour and other spoonfuls offered a taste of lime or sesame. The ingredients didn't seem to mix together well. I asked the waitress why the broth tasted a little bit sour and she credited it to the fermented tofu that was in the soup. Overall, it was an interesting concept but I don't think I will ever crave for this bowl of ramen. \\n\\nThe decor is spectacular and I felt so comfortable lounging around and enjoying their tea. The staff was really friendly in the beginning but service was rather spotty throughout my meal.

Even though the portions are on the smaller side, you only need a taste of this lasagna to truly appreciate La Quercia's authentic Italian fare.  \\n\\nWe also really enjoyed trying the different wines imported from Italy.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable of their extensive list of wines and we got to try a few wines that we would normally not be able to order at other restaurants.\\n\\nEven though La Quercia is a bit far away from the hustle and bustle of downtown, it is definitely worth making the trek out to the West side for some excellent fine dining!

However, when some out of Town friends decided to drop their name on the waiting list on their way to church, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try this place out. \\n\\nThere was a handful of interesting dishes on the menu I was tempted to try, so I asked the waitress what some of the favorites were.  Her first suggestion of three was the saumon fume, so I decided to give that a go.  However, when it came, it was underwhelming, small, and just wasn't my favorite taste profile. The smoked salmon was nice tho.  \\n\\nMy three other friends really enjoyed their meat and mushroom fricassee tho.  Everything was gone on all our plates, and we still had room to try a waffle.  I tend to like my waffles with a little crispy edge to them, so I didn't like the texture of these waffles as much as I would have but the flavor was nice.  The white chocolate pistachio rose water sauce was pretty faint... I could barely taste much of it, but I really enjoyed the passion fruit and salted caramel sauce way better.  My friend was excited to try earnest ice cream and saw it on the menu, but for $2, we were expecting more than a miniscule scoop of ice cream the size of a pat of butter... She liked it, but felt a little jipped by the serving size.  \\n\\nOne thing I will say is that I really did appreciate the service here.  From the receptionist who gave my party the benefit of the doubt and seated them when I was driving around in circles trying to find parking to our waitress who was awesome and pre-divided up the bill for us to make things easier. There was even some neat \\"you are loved\\" papers, which apparently is an art experiment by a local artist, which greet you at the door and are sometimes delivered with your check.   \\n\\nParking wise: There's a lot of construction going on these days near the restaurant, so street parking is quite hard to find, but there is a parking garage below the restaurant - as far as I know there's no validation and the rates are $4-8 an hour.

Perhaps you may have went there in times past, and you have fond memories of the cheesy, bold colors and lots of sports team merchandise decorating the walls. \\n\\nWhether you were a fan of Sidelines or not, that place no longer exists and has been replaced with a very similar restaurant that has gotten a makeover from the folks at Bar Rescue. The ownership has remained the same, but aside of the name change, a few other things got a makeover and they have a renewed focus on quality food and great drinks.\\n\\nFor starters, the bold yellow, white and red colors of Sidelines were muted to a much warmer, more sophisticated colors to match the restaurant's new name and brand: Lake House.\\n\\nThe excessive sports memorabilia has been replaced with fishing decor and photos. If you are a die hard sports fan, like myself, don't worry, they still have plenty of TV screens, and plan on having specials for the upcoming football season as well as various other sporting events.\\n\\nThe redesigned interior features warm, wood tones reflective of the residential feel Jon Taffer sought, according to Laura Rhoades, the show's production designer. The bar is wrapped in shiny corrugated metal and topped with a warm wood counter. Above the bar hang three large televisions. \\n\\nDuring the Bar Rescue makeover, Jon Taffer changed the name of Sidelines Bar & Grill to Lake House Bar & Grill and the bar has kept the name. The reviews since the makeover are a mixed bag of positive and negative reviews. \\n\\nI stopped in for a visit in the beginning of August with three guests. My overall impression was a positive one. We all really enjoyed the food, and the bartender made us some serious drinks that are comparable to ones I've had at fine establishments that are in the $12.00 and up range for fine custom cocktails. \\n\\nInside is very spacious with plenty of tables and seating, and a nice wrap around bar, but if the weather is permitting, they have a great outdoor patio with a wood deck and picnic tables to enjoy as well.\\n\\nOur bartender Johnathan made some serious cocktails at the bar. We started our night off with a drink he calls the The Orange Blossom with Bombay Sapphire Gin, muddled orange, mint, orange bitters, simple syrup, and basil flower. This was very fresh and very Florida.\\n\\nThe fried mushrooms here are great bar food fare, and they actually use whole mushrooms, as opposed to the little caps most restaurants use. They are served with a horseradish dipping sauce and were pretty tasty.\\n\\nYou can't go wrong with potato skins fried nice and crispy and topped with lots of bacon at Lakehouse Bar and Grill. \\n\\n Although this drink does not have an official name yet, We debated calling it the \\"Wet Cucumber\\" this was also a super refreshing drink with Bombay Sapphire Gin, mint, fresh cucumber, and very rare mini cucumbers in the bottom. This was another top notch cocktail from our bartender.\\n\\nOne of our guests ordered the Garlic Parmesan Wings. One of the things I like about the wings here, is that they are full size and not those little baby wings some people try to pass off. These had a great flavor and were crispy and tender all at once.\\n\\nBurgers here, are a specialty. They have quite a few varieties, but the Lakehouse Burger was on point, as it should be, since it's the namesake burger. This was cooked perfectly to a medium temperature and topped with ham, bacon, sauteed onions, banana peppers, mozzarella cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions and thousand island dressing. I always love a burger that is cooked to perfection and is a little messy. \\n\\n Garlic Hot wings were pretty delicious also. Fried up nice and still fell off the bone.\\n\\nAs part of the Bar Rescue makeover, they have some other items on the menu more than just burgers and wings.

This blew my mind because You don't normally think of a restaurant that has a drive thru, has top quality, fresh delicious food.  \\n\\nIf you've never tried Ethiopian food, my boyfriend said he would compare it to a mix between Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine. For starters we ordered the beef smabusa and  gomen dip. Sambusa reminded me of an egroll with Indian flavors and the gomen dip like hummus. Would recommend both. \\n\\nBeing my first try  we wanted to try a little bit of everything so we opted for the \\"meat lovers\\" platter for 36 dollars. What a steal! Easily feed 3. Worth it even if you have to take it to go (btw it reheats nicely as leftovers!) The meat was so flavorful,  juicy  and tender. For the meat lovers you get to choose ANY three meats and they do not skimp on the portion of meat. The meats to choose from are : lamb, ribeye, filet mignon, chicken, tilapia, salmon, ground beeef, shrimp, chicken.  We got chicken, lamb, and ribeye. \\n\\nTried the Ethiopian honey wine and it was too honey forward and sweet for me. My boyfriend was happy they had one of his favorite beers \\"red stripe\\"  and reasonably priced. The Ethiopian bread is called injera, it is a spongy soft flatbread  of sorts. You use it to pick up everything with your hands to get a bite of everything.  We were asked if we wanted to eat with utensils and being my first Ethiopian restaurant I wanted the true dining experience and excuse to use my hands to eat and not be frowned upon. The  sides we had were the potatoe stew, miser( red lentil stew), rice, tomato Fitfit( which is there spongy bread  cooked in tomatoe sauce).  Loved the lentil stew and even got extra to go for 1.50. Did not like the \\"fitfit\\" I liked the acidity of the liquid the bread was soaked in but it just tasted like wet  soggy bread to me."},{"name":"Prosperity Pie Shoppe","address":"7814 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Beautiful space, adorable staff, and delicious treats: hooray!

We luckily snagged a booth near the window, in fact it wasn't too busy for 6pm on a Sunday so we almost had our pick of the place and prepared to feast. It was my girlfriends first time at the spot so we decided to do the Grand Feast - a 3 course sampling platter with Hummus, Baba Ganooj, salad, prawns, beef and chicken for two, plus more for $48. Everything was so good, not to mention filling, we ended up leaving with a midnight snack and lunch for the next day. Loved all the flavours and attention to detail; it was clear that the dishes were prepared, plated and served with care. \\n\\nThe high point of the meal for me was probably the Najib's special, I've read that this is one of Nuba's signature dishes and tried it at another location only to be slightly disappointed (it's deep fried and was kind of burnt last try). After trying it again at the Waldorf location I see what all the fuss is about, so randomly - so good! It's deep-fried Cauliflower tossed with lemon and sea salt, I know my explanation won't do it justice but I highly recommend giving it a chance if you ever make your way to this location. The low point for us was the Baba Ganooj , we generally really like Baba Ganooj and anything with eggplant so I'm not sure what went wrong this time. We both just thought it was a bit off. Luckily for me I had an amazing Caesar with killer garnish to wash it down with so all was forgotten.\\n\\nDefinitely check this place out if you're in the neighborhood!

We ended up coming back on a Monday.  As with most restaurants, Mondays are pretty slow.  We basically had the place to ourselves.\\n\\nThe restaurant is dimly lit, with a nice date night feel to it.  Because the tables are somewhat close together you can hear your neighbor's conversations.  Also you can clearly hear the 80's lounge music coming from the bar area that is next door.\\n\\nSince it was only my family and three other customers, service was good. The menu offers traditonal Thai and Chinese dishes. They have reasonable lunch specials and good appetizer prices.  I think the entree prices are slightly higher priced than other restaurants I've eaten at.\\n\\nI ordered the Pla Jian (fried tilapia w/minced pork) and the rest of the family  ordered lo mein and combination fried rice.  The fried rice, is some of the best I've ever had and my tilapia dish was delicious. the food was very fresh. The only downfall was the waitress brought my dish out last instead of with everyone elses.  It was worth the few minutes wait.\\n\\nAn interesting thing happened that has nothing to do with the review of this restaurant, but I'm going to share anyway.  Throughout our meal there was a single male customer I kept making eye contact with, kinda was a little unnerving. Anyway, when we went to pay (we went over the value of the groupon) the waitress said she had something to tell us, she handed me a note from the lone diner, that said he could see the love in our family and it made him think of his family. He wanted to pay for our dinner! Awww, how sweet is that?!  Shame on me for passing judgement on this man!\\n\\nOkay, if I'm going to share the sweet part, I must share the not so sweet parts.  Deep sigh.... There was a long hair on my rice.  I know for sure that it was not mine and luckily it wasn't intertwined in the rice, so it could of just fell on there right?  I told our waitress and she was so distraught over it, I felt bad.  She immediately, replaced my rice.  Honestly, hair in food does not bother me that much (don't judge me!) it can't kill you!

The service was very good as the waitstaff and hostess was very attentive.  \\n\\nThe menu had a very good selection as well, however, I was disappointed in the portion sizes of the meals - - for dinner they brought out very big plates w/ tiny portions, and based on the price it I did not feel like it was the best bang for the buck.  \\n\\nThe ambience and atmosphere is very nice, low keyed, dark, and comfortable.  There's a small bar area as well.  They usually have a 1/2 off appetizer special at which you have to sit at the bar area, and last time a group of us went it was difficult to seat any more than 4 together.  The waitress also didn't forewarn us as to which appetizers were half off (she gave us the wrong menu) so we ended up ordering a few that were regular price.  \\n\\nIt was the first time I had been to their half off appetizer deal (yes, virgin) and the manager (at this location) could have handled the situation in a more professional and mature manner.  Regardless, no complaints about the quality of the food as it was very good and the half off special makes it a more reasonable deal.  \\n\\nI will eventually go back to Eddie V's in the future, however, only for the appetizer deal and not for dinner since I don't feel it's economical.  The food is good, and if you don't mind paying a little more for a little less then by all means you may enjoy them.

As a result, the service was very attentive and considerate. There's an indoor seating area, which we chose due to the slightly cold weather, as well as an outdoor area. There's a fire pit if you're lucky, as well as a couple of \\"private\\" heated rooms, so take your pick.\\n\\nStarting with the food, it's slightly pricey, but nothing too outlandish, and trust me, it's worth it. They're generous with the tzatziki, which immediately won over my girlfriend's heart, and they have all your other standard starters as well. For the main entry, their signature is a gigantic Roasted Lamb Shank that's dripping in juice and peels right off the bone. My personal favorite is the Lamb Shwarma, which was absolutely incredible. Also noteworthy was the Beer Tenderloin La Zeez. The waitstaff was extra nice and brought out the dipping sauces for us to try; despite my high tolerance for spice, here's a fair warning--the roasted habanero is extra-spicy. Almost all the plates come with an extra side of tzatziki. The cherry on top is the fact that it's BYOB; even with a group of 10 and multiple bottles of wine and beer, the entire corking fee was still just 3 bucks. So stock up at Twin Liquors before making the trek out here, and thank me later.\\n\\nSince we were all too stuffed for dessert, after dinner, we took the party outside for some good old-fashioned hookah. If you're not in the mood for that, the outside ambiance is nice too. The BYOB still applies, and you can sit and chill with music and belly dancing.

The menu is pretty basic. There are 3 options for broth type: Miso, Shio and Shoyu. We love the miso broth. There are 9 ramen choices that includes toppings. There is also a choice to add additional toppings. Pick your broth, ramen and extra toppings if you want. If you are hungry or can eat a lot, go big with a large or super size it. Who can say no to more noodles and broth?\\n\\nMy husband enjoys the Deluxe Ryoma Ramen in a super size and I have been ordering the Corn Butter Ramen in a regular size. We also enjoy the gyoza and Chashu Rice Bowl under the appetizer section. Large pieces of pork on a bed of rice and drizzle with a Smokey flavored soy sauce all over. Everything we have tried so far has been oh so delicious. The noodles is cooked to perfection and the miso broth is addicting. The pork is smooth and tender. \\n\\nThis is my favorite hot spot for ramen in Beaverton. There is ample parking for customers. The best time to is right when they open for lunch or dinner to avoid the wait. There is also a large Japanese grocery/gift store next door called Uwajimaya. \\n\\nThanks for reading!"},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"After 3 days in Denver we were craving BBQ when we landed in the ATX. Reading the Texas Monthly article on the top 50 BBQ joints in Texas probably had something to do with it too! We decided to head to Barton Springs to chow down. It was around 7 on a Friday and they were doin a business. It smelled like smoke house meat perfection! Probably 20 people ahead of us in line but it moved quick. First up was their sides bar, self serve. I told myself I'd get the slaw and the greens beans. I decided I also needed the potato salad and mini banana pudding, BOTH totally worth it. The man friend got the creamed corn and mac n cheese and I admit I ate half of his sides too. Next stop was the meat selection. I love me some pig so went with sausage, jalape√±os cheese sausage to be exact. It was great. My counter part went with his go to brisket and a couple pork ribs which, as you can probably guess by now I also nibbled off of. Love that they have 3 different sauces to choose from on the tables and offer both indoor and outdoor seating so you can people watch! To top it all off, sweet tea for the win!

On top of organization, their food is also tasty. The servers are extremely nice and never had a problem with them. They greet you and have exceptional mannerism - a rarity at Asian buffets such as this.\\n\\nFor just about $14 (including tax) on weekends, this place is surely worth it.  Their sushi looks fresh and the rice they use actually doesn't look dried out. They have a lot of variety of sushi including tempura rolls. However,  It's safe to say that most of the rolls are 75% rice. In addition to the sushi, they serve tasteful miso soup, which is a rarity at an Asian buffet. \\n\\nOther worthy mentions of their selection is the Korean bbq short ribs and dessert bar.\\n\\nIf I'm ever in the mood for an Asian buffet, I'm definitely coming back here again."},{"name":"Eddie V's Prime Seafood","address":"9400 B Arboretum Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"You really can't go wrong with the Sunday Brunch here.

Damn your tastiness! My wallet cries!\\n\\nThe chicken and the sides were astonishing. Most restaurants, when packed or rushed, reduce the quality of the food to the point where going to a fast food chain would have been a better choice.

The slaw's cabbages were thinly sliced to bring more sauce flavor, but still retain the crunch, in every bite you took! And the chicken!!!! Good fried chicken stay crispy even after some time has passed. IT WAS STILL HOT &  CRUNCHY EVEN AFTER 20 MINUTES!!!! Well seasoned, spiceful, and still moist! They have the cooking time and recipe to an art here. \\n\\nHats off to this establishment.

I ordered the shroom burger, which they fry the mushroom and is stuff with cheese. The cheese part is a hit or miss. At times, I thought it was great. And later, I kind of got too used to it and wished that I could have taken it out. In general, there's plenty of seating and throughout my time, workers would walk around with either free samples to try one of their drinks or milkshake.

Delicious butter though, and served nice and soft instead of ice hard. Nice wines by the glass and cocktails on the menu, tasty and well served.\\n\\nService was overall very good, though food servers should know who ordered what instead of calling out each dish when they arrive and asking where it goes.

I can never quite put my finger on what the mix is, but it's definitely a mix that heavily focuses on salty and medium on the savory side. It's good. It's Taiwanese chicken and it's dope as hell. I've also been to two different night markets in Taipei that same semester and well.. yeah this place is pretty authentic, if you care about that sort of stuff.\\n\\nIn addition, the tofu fries are quite good too. I made my order to go both times I've been here, and each time I open the tofu fries they're a bit soggy from the steam trapped in the foil. Now I know it's not their fault for putting the foil on to keep it hot, but I wonder if the fries are actually supposed to be nice and firm to dip in the sauce. They give you toothpicks to eat this with and what I usually do is skewer the tofu bites the long way and dip the sauce in that manner. The sauce by the way is HEAVENLY. It has some sriracha chipotle mayo themes in it and again, I can't quite pin the exact recipe, but it's a nice balance of sweet, sour, and savory.\\n\\nI've gotten both the chicken and tofu bites both times I was here and the total comes out to I think $10. My main complaint is that that's a bit pricey, though specifically I mean the chicken, which is around $6.

New restaurant? Nope. Free food? Nope. George Clooney in the building? I wish. Normally in America I'd question the long line and think 'hype,' but this is Canada, and Canadians aren't stupid.\\n\\nThe original Danbo shop opened in 2000 in the town of Chikushino located halfway between Kurume on the southern island of Kyushu and Hakata in the Fukuoka Prefecture, the epicenter of Tonkotsu-style ramen. They focused on quality and taste and soon word spread, and so did they--all over Japan. This Robson store is one of four in North America (the others are in Seattle, Brooklyn, and a second in the Kitsilano area of Vancouver).\\n\\nThe ramen here is build-your-own and customizable to the hilt, which aside from the exceptional taste of the broth, is Danbo's biggest claim to fame. In most ramen shops I've been to, you can choose your protein or vegetal toppings. Here you pick everything from noodle thickness and firmness to the amount of lard, richness, and spice in the broth. At first, the level of choice was overwhelming. If the thought of endless possibilities makes you run for the hills, just order 'standard everything' and call it a day. Normally I advocate for the purveyor to dictate the vision for how their food should taste, but in this case, it was kind of cool to granulize, particularly to control the lard. I went with a 'light' quantity of that but you have up to an 'extra rich' on the Richter Scale. To quote the late great Julia Child, \\"fat gives things flavor.\\" Over time it can also cause a coronary, so everything in moderation is my motto.\\n\\nSimply put, my order of Miso Rekka Ramen was superb, arriving prepared with chashu (pork), scallions, and a dollop of their top-secret homemade karadare (spicy sauce). \\"Rekka Ramen\\" means that an additional layer of Ichimi Togarashi Powder gets added, which did its job to bring extra heat while not overpowering the flavor of the broth. Speaking of broth, Danbo's is based on a starter Tonkotsu pork broth and was savory without being salty or oily. The miso ramen builds on the base by using a blend of two types of traditional Japanese miso. Swirled within the broth were super fresh and firm thin noodles that had a nice chew. Meanwhile the locally sourced Yakibuta Chashu pork had both crisp and melt-in-your-mouth tender textures. Collectively, it was umami heaven, and in addition to being tasty, I imagine this hot bowl of happiness works well when Vancouver is sporting negative temperatures.\\n\\nWanting to experience more magical porky savoriness, we also shared an order of Chashu Pork Donburi, served as a small bowl of white rice topped with small chunks of tender pork belly. The braised chashu boasted even layers of meat and fat topped by fresh scallions and a savory sauce. This was a satisfying side dish and served to reinforce the high brought on by the ramen. Just when you don't think it can get any better, it does. \\n\\nThe catch at reaching ramen utopia is that you have to wait, but typical of ramen shops, rest assured that the food here is efficiently served and the line moves quickly. Unlike the fast-casual places where there's one register open just to create a line and thus the appearance of popularity, this is a full-scale sit-down place that's turning over tables as fast as possible. After all, you sit, slurp, pay, and leave.\\n\\nThis is easily the best ramen I've had up to now and puts everything I have back at home squarely in the 'this is crap' category. In this case, the ramen at the end of the rainbow is well worth waiting for."},{"name":"To Dine For Eatery","address":"333 Terminal Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"This place catches your attention with that huge \\"best burger in town\\" poster.

We visited on a Tuesday for lunch and had the place mostly to ourselves.\\n\\nSushi combos are available, but most will likely opt to order individual pieces of nigiri off the menu. The fish selection changes on a regular basis, so you might not find sushi staples like tako (octopus) or tamago (egg) depending on when you go. \\n\\nOverall the fish quality was good. This is well-prepared sushi, no question about it. The individual pieces are a bit small (comparable in size to Octopus' Garden), so you may not leave with a completely full belly.  \\n\\nOur first round of nigiri (hamachi, aji, maguro, ikura) tasted great. The second round took a step in the wrong direction. Subsequent hamachi and aji pieces were very cold - a surefire sign that chef Yuji had run out of supply and had to pull some from the icebox. The same held true for the rice on our second set of nigiri which was too warm and barely held together while eating. Better pacing and prep is a must to ensure that customers aren't eating frozen fish and hot rice.\\n\\nSingle nigiri pieces are priced anywhere from $1.25 to over $3.5. While many reviewers have labeled Sushi by Yuji \\"inexpensive,\\" I can't quite agree. This is around the price of an average kaiten sushi (conveyer belt sushi) restaurant in Japan. $15 will get you around 4-5 pieces at lunch. You won't be full, you will order more and the price will climb even higher. I think the price is reasonable considering the fish quality, but yelpers expecting a real bargain should dine elsewhere. \\n\\nAs many reviewers have noted the service needs a bit of work. Both chef Yuji and the waitress (I didn't catch her name) seem very friendly and kind. However, curiously the service isn't very good. By the end of our meal my gf and I were the only ones left in the restaurant. Yet, the waitress busied herself by inexplicably filling large ziplock bags with coins at the front register rather than returning to take our order. \\n \\nWere I still living in Japan, I would just shout a hearty \\"sumimasen\\" to get her attention, but this somehow feels rude and inappropriate in Canada. I wish the service was a bit better.

I would recommend it to people who live in the area. I made the longish journey all the way from Kits specifically for lunch and was a bit disappointed overall.

Not the greatest pizza, but I managed to figure out how to get a big pie with two toppings from them for 20 bucks with tax.  Sometimes burnt but edible, sometimes not.  Then one day I got a ground beef and onion pizza that had RED HAIR in the pizza.  Called them, they swapped it out - Manager even knew who's hair it was!  Even excused the fact they wanted the pizza back, making me wonder were they recycling the slices for the next day.  \\n\\nWent on with them.  Left and came back.  Ordered my regular pie.  This time with a honey lemonade.  Delivery Driver is three hours late.  Drinks my beverage.  I call them back and tell them he's drinking my drink - I see him polishing it off as he's bringing my food out the car.  Has the nerve to give me a Minute Maid Lemonade bottled 16 oz in compensation, uh what?  Pizza is ALSO WRONG and NOT MY ORDER.  Manager steps in again.  Takes another two hours for my food to come.  Driver gives me my money back and tip and informs me Mojo is NEVER delivering to my location or block AGAIN.  I call the restaraunt and they won't answer - I know they have caller ID so I call from my other number and surprise, surprise they ANSWER.\\n\\nIt's not that great to put up with such foolishness.

I came during breakfast on the weekend. There was a nice line that went by quickly. They have breakfast that ends at 2pm. They also have ongoing lunch menu. I decided to order the country fried steak with smashed potatoes and mac n cheese. The steak was a little chewy but the crust was amazing. It  was a huge portion and lots of gravy like i like it. The smashed potatoes were smooth and creamy but had bits that were not cooked all the way. Mac n cheese i had no complaints, cheesy and tangy. The biscuits were soft buttery and a coat of honey on top. \\n\\nMy fianc√© had the coop combo with 2 eggs 2 pancakes, potatoes toast and quarter chicken. He was very happy he could substitute the pork options for chicken. It was a well rounded meal that he ate in a flash. I also partaked in the honey and maple syrup which was sweet and smoky maple flavor. The only issue was the pancake had the middle portion still gooey bc not cooked all the way.  Plus sweet ice tea was amazing as usual. The breakfast you order separately at the front which took awhile compared to the precooked sides. I would definitely come again to try a chicken pot pie.

The ambiance is great both at the bar or at the dinning room. Their cocktails are great and they offer a quite descent wine menu. The service is excellent. I've been there several times and I always thought they did a good job taking care of the customer.  In terms of food, I honestly think they are above average. Could it be better? Yes, but still they are above average.\\n\\nHaving said that, I have to say that in my last visit the experience was not that great. Everything I mentioned above regarding the service, the ambiance and the wine applies. But in terms of food, the experience was slightly different. Certainly not disappointing, but simply not that great. Here's what my girlfriend and I ordered:\\n\\n.- Patatas bravas: In my opinion, the potatoes were a little bit overcooked, meaning that they were a little drier than you would expect them to be. The salsa brava was good. Not that spicy but overall it delivered a nice flavor. \\n\\n.- Pan con tomate: Perfect! Nothing to say here... you would expect to get a slide of bread with tomato... and I guess that technically this is what you get... but they elevate it in a way that you wouldn't expect.\\n\\n.- Eggplant caponata: Certainly not bad but... I would say they used some sugar in the recipe and... that's so unfortunate... I would say it would be much better if they simply forget about the sugar...\\n\\n.-  Paella de mariscos: Not bad... but not the best one ever.... The rice was properly cooked, but the paella was missing something... I am not exactly sure what it was, but it was a little bit blend... Also, even if the rice was properly cooked, it was not crispy (ideally, you want to have some crispiness when having a paella... that is one of the differences between paella and any other rice recipe). Another characteristic of paella is the \\"socarrat\\", that crispy part you get in the bottom of the paella... Well, that was also missing.

I came hungry all the way from NJ and their tasting menu satisfied all five of my taste buds. The shiitake dumpling should be their first dish on the menu. The umami bomb that it was, opened my palate for the culinary sensory satisfaction that I embarked on for that night. I must note that the dry aged Akaushi ribeye, was the best piece of beef I have ever had. Cooked and seasoned to perfection, and finished in a flavorful bath of more beefy goodness.\\n\\nEvery dish had the right balance of flavor and the progression from lite to heavy was played out to perfection. I believe the quality of the food would not have been the same, if it had not been for the excellent service provided, which shined on its own. The staff was attentive in every manner and very warm and welcoming for my first visit to Austin. I was able to enjoy my tasting never feeling rushed, and was humbled when Nick (Executive Sous Chef) took the time to quickly side bar with me on the life of a chef, and my experience thus far. The staff made it a memorable experience, and I will be a regular every time a visit Austin. \\n\\nSidenote: The best seat in the house during a cold chilly night, if dining solo, is right in front of the wood burning grill. The warmth and smell of burning wood, makes it a cozy spot to enjoy a good meal, and well made cocktail.

Thankfully we at least had that \\"snack\\" because it was at least 30 minutes until our food showed up. And while I know it was a Friday night it really wasn't packed especially since most of the people were there at the bar and there weren't many plates coming out at all (so either they weren't ordering or the kitchen is mighty slow).\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered a chicken philly sandwich which was also tiny and he said not that great. He also wanted to know why it took that long to give him his food for such a small and bad amount.\\n\\nHis son ordered the chicken tender basket and while the actual tenders were good the fries were clearly fried in old oil as you could taste them heavily in the fries so of course his son ate none of it.\\n\\nI ordered the \\"frog\\" burger and here is the strange thing, I asked for the burger to be cooked medium. Yet somehow only HALF the burger was medium (pretty close to medium rare) and the other half was well done, I wasn't even aware that was possible. Also I ordered there fried onion petals and its clear either the onions had freezer burn or the batter was off somehow. \\n\\nDid order two desserts and they were fine but again for such a small amount (ordered the brownie one) it was 5 bucks. \\n\\nThe waitress came to our table several times and kept telling us our food would be out shortly because it was obvious it was no where near done and as time slipped by she seemed more and more nervous. \\n\\nSo for three drinks, a small appetizer, three horrible entrees that took entirely too long and two small desserts we paid over $50. We originally were going to go to Chili's but they were packed and I know for a cheaper price you can get a lot more food there. We should have just waited! Unfortunately the experience followed us home because all of our stomachs were hurting shortly after we got home. \\n\\nI know this is a long review but I am just really disappointed in this place and I have no idea how they are still open.

And naturally, I hear rave reviews about it from just about everybody I know.  While it's great to get recommendations from friends, it's also probably not a great idea to set expectations so high.  I went to Hopdoddy expecting this to be the most epic, life-changing burger experience of my existence (as my friends had led me to believe).  And go figure- it wasn't.  But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy my burger, but the overall experience could have gone over better.\\n\\nI went for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon with a group of coworkers.  We were all Hopdoddy first-timers and weren't quite sure where to go or how this whole thing was supposed to go down.  As soon as we walked in, one of the employees (hostess? waitress? I don't really know what her job was) asked how many would be in our party, and proceeded to reserve a table for us.  But we couldn't sit there until after we went to the front and waited in line to order.\\n\\nI was the first one from my group to finally decide on a burger, so I stepped up to the counter.  After I finished ordering, I handed the cashier my credit card to pay.  She told me she would take everybody's order first, and then get payment.  From each one of us.  Separately- which meant all of us had to wait around near the counter and in front of all the other people in line, and then step back up one at a time to pay.  Individually!  This part was a mess, and I didn't understand the point.\\n\\nThe burger itself was pretty good.  I went with the buffalo bill, which came with ground buffalo, blue cheese, bacon, and hot sauce.  Things got messy- sauces and cheeses and gooey-ness were dripping down my hands with every bite.  And as always, the best supporting actor award goes to Bacon, which really does make everything better.  Pair that with some blue cheese and you're on your way to a perfect flavor combo.  I also liked that the burger wasn't enormous- I found that the portion was just right.  \\n\\nI was tempted by several other menu choices, so I wouldn't mind another visit to Hopdoddy on my next trip to Austin.  Maybe I'll take somebody who wants to foot the bill though."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"First time visitors.\\nExcellent service, Excellent Burgers!\\nThe Sweet ToT Pot is amazing!"},{"name":"Verde Cocina","address":"524 NW 14th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I just stopped in for lunch for the first time after walking by it for a few years.

Recently the restaurant is under new management and has been spruced up quite a bit with a modern interior (previously it was a bit garish in bright \\"Greek\\" blue and white - also the huge ficus trees under the skylight have been removed). Luckily the food is every bit as good as it was 20 years ago.\\n\\nChris' Pizza House is a Greek style pizza restaurant. I think I first encountered this style while living in Florida and indeed, the first time I took my friend Eric to Chris' he called it \\"a treasure\\" - Eric is originally from the Daytona Beach area. Athens Pizza is another Greek style pizza establishment, with a bit more menu options. What you'll find here are pizzas with a bit thicker crust that are a bit airier than neapolitan, more like a soft flat-bread. They can be had with gyro meat, feta cheese and delicious kalamata olives which changes the flavor composition quite a bit. The salads also feature similar compositions and a quite handy Greek-style dressing. You'll also find the typical gyro wrap and plate options you'd except of your typical Greek restaurant. All here are quite good.\\n\\nHonestly, I usually come to this location for the pizza or gyro so I can't tell you much about the other Greek options. I expect the souvlaki and mousaka to be quite good, if the pizzas and gyros are any indication. The lunch deals here are also quite good and affordable and there's plenty of parking (the shopping center is quite large and busy), although the parking is a bit haphazard with weird throughways, probably due to the site being reconfigured over many years. Chris' is also a great source for takeout food.\\n\\nMy preference is to split a salad and have either a veggie or Chris' Special Pie (Pepperoni, Hamburger, Sausage, Feta Cheese, Mushrooms, Peppers, Onions).

If you're wondering why it's popping up like mushrooms after the rain, wonder no more.  Just venture into one, and you'll soon see why.  For one thing, it's single-handedly lowering the gas price of its immediate vicinity, by 5-10 cents on average - and that's on all 3 grades, instead of the \\"loss leader\\" games that some stations play (does that not irritate you as much as it irritates me?)  For another, the staff is more polite and better trained, and the store, bigger, more pleasant, and offer WAY more choices than most any other gas station/convenience store you've seen.  The \\"high tech\\" ordering is designed to cut down lines, but it's only as effective as the users in front of you are familiar with how it works.  With so many things going for this chain, you may have reason to think that they name it 'Wawa' because of the loud howls of distress made by rival stores when they move into an area, and you won't be too far wrong: except they're thus named because they're based in Wawa, Pa.  BTW, it's pronounced more to rhyme less with 'Ah!\\" than \\"Awe!\\" - which works, too, I suppose.  \\n\\nThat said, while their coffee price (and quality) is very good, some of their other food and beverage choices are not inexpensive, and they're not always good (e.g., the smoothies tend to have way too much ice, and they're not blended thoroughly - at least it's true of this store which I frequent the most these days).  Offsetting the high price are some generous coupons from the receipts that keep you coming back.  If Pastor Joel (Northland) is mentioning your store in his sermon, you're a somebody, Wawa! \\n\\nMy one other complaint is their lack of paper towel option and the sole use of these ultra-loud hand dryers with the unfortunate brand name of Xlerator - this is a bit of a peeve of mine.  As much of a tree-hugger as I am, I vote for hand-drying OPTIONS.  Use dryers PROMINENTLY by all means, but do offer paper towels - (like Costco does (not to mention that their Dyson \\"Blade\\" dryers, 3x more expensive than Xlerators, are also quieter).  There are times when paper is the only good option (think, splashing your face or cleaning up a messy kid - what, I have to use TOILET paper to wipe her mouth?).  Second, these outrageous contraptions that are over 100 decibels should be banned because they're so freaking loud.  Folks will just find ANOTHER excuse not to wash their hands.  And when it's your own staff, and they're PREPARING FOOD AND DRINKS! ... that's just not a good combination.

My friend and I order the ceviche and poke as an appetizer. The ceviche was okay but I had a friend from El Salvador who would make it all the time so it's truly hard to compete... but the tuna poke was phenomenal!! As for the tacos, we ordered the duck, lobster, shrimp (still bite size but hey, I get it) pork belly, fish, chorizo as well as sides of corn and slaw. The knock it out the park tacos were the lobster (even though I'm not a fan of hard shelled tacos) DUCK (OMG yum ) fish (loved the light batter) and my friend adored the chorizo taco!! The corn was just as amazing as before and the slaw was still meh! What made me review the establishment 5 stars was of course the food and service (being better than Inman Park) but for the mere fact that I actually got to meet Elisa (or Elise.. don't judge me) in person and I also spoke to the manager on staff! For an establishment to take my review in all sincerity with hopes of rectification, is a place I would loved to have continued business with! Thanks to the entire staff :)"},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"FLOP burger boutique....

It wasn't the spicyness that made them inedible, either; it was the taste of it in general. There were also hardly any noodles in the dish -- it was mostly meat, and the noodles that did make it in the dish were all broken and very short. Broken noodles to me indicate being overcooked. So many people raved about these noodles in the reviews, and I don't understand why.\\n\\nAll in all, this place was very underwhelming and overpriced.

The decor of the location is super cute and is nice for a cooler day because of the garage style doors and outdoor seating. \\n\\nBecause of their offerings, I decided to order two of their tacos and their corn side off the cob. I will start off by saying that the tacos are very small so depending on how hungry you are you will need at least two. I personally didn't see anything too special about the spicy chorizo or fried oyster taco I got, just okay flavor and both came out room temp. \\n\\nService was a bit lacking from the time we came to the restaurant. We were seated right away but our waitress just wasn't very helpful and was borderline rude at times. She only took half our tables drink orders when she came by, which was weird. Two people at our table had to call her back to put in their order after she tried to run away. We also felt like we were being rushed out even though the restaurant was basically empty. \\n\\nThe redeeming factor here is the margaritas. I'm a huge fan of the fact that they use freshly squeezed juice rather than sugary mixes. They also offer a wide range of flavors from jalape√±o to strawberry to regular.

One downside: the sides are no longer self-serve.

The chargrilled oysters, while not as awesome as those you get in NO, were seasoned well and had a slight char flavor.  The PoBoy was also seasoned perfectly, not salty and not bland.  The French Bread seemed to be very fresh and was soft yet crusty.  Since I'm not drinking for the time being, we didn't try any of the daiquiris or cocktails but they did look rather refreshing.  They even offer sealed to-go bottles for those who want to take their drinks home as well as gallons of their daiquiri flavors.

A line up formed soon after and there was probably a 20-30 minute wait depending on the size of the party? \\n\\nOnce seated, expect for the waiter/waitress to approach your table soon afterwards.  There are 10 hotpot options to choose from and then a number of add on's that you can request for at an additional cost.\\n\\nMy friends and I all ordered #7, Tomato Veggie, All Veggie. If you are vegetarian, this is the only option that you have and they have a limited amount, so call in advance to check if they still have stock or come early!\\n\\nUpon ordering, it took about 10 minutes for our food to come. That was when the fun began! Here's the thing about hotpot: if the food isn't cooked properly, you don't need to wait for it to be sent back or whatever, you get to throw it back in and let it cook longer! \\n\\nAt the same time, you also take ownership for how badly your food may taste if you're terrible at determining when something is ready. Prepare yourselves adequately if you choose to tackle this mission. \\n\\nMinor details: the fire for two of our hotpot died and they relit it quite quickly for us -- just wave someone down! After perhaps half an hour, somebody came by to ask if we wanted the fire to be put out to avoid having the bottom burn. Aside from that, no actual check ups or refilling water from the waiters/waitresses.\\n\\nCustomer Service: 3/5 -- didn't really check in on us, which wasn't a problem as we took initiative to wave people down. However, they did forget certain things that we ordered and the waitress seemed very short with us (she seemed to spend more time chatting with other employees). Ergo, the 3/5. \\n\\nFood: 5/5 -- absolutely amazing!

You basically have to walk to the back of the \\"house/cafe\\" to the coffee bar/ register area. We were awkwardly greeted by an older man, whom I can only assume was a manger or owner. He was not very friendly and seemed like he didn't understand anything we said. We asked for a table for 4, preferably on the porch since it was a beautiful summer morning. Again, he awkwardly replied as if no one had ever asked him this question before. And then a woman, assuming she was the cook, came out and abruptly stated \\"it's gonna be at least 20 minutes before any food comes out\\" Ooooookkkkk. So do you want to serve us or not?? That's what I was thinking, but didn't say anything. \\nThe older man/ server said it would be 5 min for a table outside.

I had only been once before (then known as Terra Grille) and I ate there on my first day in Atlanta.  Edamame, yummy burgers - it was a treat, but for whatever reason I never went back.\\n\\nFast forward 6 years and now that I'm into wine and good eats, I thought it was worth the trip to check out the facelift on what I thought was a great place.\\n\\nWe went on a Friday night with no reservations.  Friday was calling for rain so we didn't even ask to sit outside, which looked amazingly beautiful, even with storm clouds overhead.  The little room off the patio looked perfect for a party - definitely worth remembering!!!\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is completely different and actually has a sushi restaurant kind of feel, in that the kitchen is open, the lighting is dim, and booths dominate the floor.  I give 5 stars worth of credit for the stellar playlist, which not only featured KT Tunstall and Norah Jones, but my fave lesser-known jazz vocalist, Melody Gardot.  Perfect.  \\n\\nOne bonus of Terra is that since its a wine bar, there are loads of wines to sample before settling in on what you'll have with dinner.  I felt like the sommelier was very attentive to what I enjoyed in a wine and definitely steered me in the right direction to a lovely sangiovese.\\n\\nI wasn't entirely hungry and made the mistake of letting my hubby (and the waiter) talk me into the buffalo meatloaf.  This isn't something I'd normally order or even make at home so the choice was rather odd, especially  when the halibut special sounded so good.  In the end, I thought the meatloaf was bland and that the pepper sauce poured over it was the attempt to make up for the lack of flavor.  In addition, somehow our appetizer order of edamame got confused as my side item, which was supposed to be sauteed spinach.  Not a huge deal since I wasn't hungry, but meh.\\n\\nHubby's lamb burger was heavy on the mint and not so heavy on the flavor.  The side salad was massive and the homemade dressing was the best thing of the night.\\n\\nThe homemade key lime pie was HUGE and delicious.  Best I've had in Atlanta, for sure!\\n\\nIn sum, I think this is a place to go to for drinks and an app.  Our bill came close to $100 for two glasses of wine, two entrees, a dessert, and tip.  Ouch.  For the price versus the quality of the food, its just not worth it to me to pay that when there are comparable restaurants closeby (Haven and Kaleidiscope) where I would have been much happier at almost spending $100 on Friday night's dinner for two.\\n\\nMinus the mess-up on our order, I found the staff to be super friendly.  My water was always filled and it seemed as if both the manager and owner were on staff that night to make sure everything was perfect.\\n\\nTheir website features specials which are worth checking out.\\n\\nFinally, I asked our waiter what the deal was on patio reservations since the website seems a bit odd about the process.  Here it is:  first come, first served.  You can call ahead and they will try to seat you out there if they can, but you may have to wait.  If you're a group of 6 or more, they'll take your credit card info to secure your reservation.  They want you to show up or else get to charge you for the wasted space.\\n\\nAll in all, I'd give it another shot for lunch or for drinks on the patio..."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Since we were tourists, and we were in Portland, I wanted to go to Voodoo Doughnuts.

The place is pretty tiny, but nicely and simply decorated, with free parking available around the restaurant. It was a warm night, so they had the A/C on high, which made dining here a little on the chilly side. We decided to order alla famiglia (sharing 3 apps, 2 pastas, 1 main and 1 dessert) for $50 per person. The party two tables from us got the same dishes as we did, so we were able to get a preview of what was coming. We were served:\\n\\n1st course: asparagus, egg, cotto. The egg was like an Italian version of egg salad, and it was pretty good. This was a light way to start the meal (they also offer good bread and olive oil with your meal).\\n\\n2nd course: goat cheese and roasted beets. Although decent, this dish was my least favorite since they topped it with brown sugar, making everything too sweet.\\n\\n3rd course: salmon crostini, smoked salmon, grapefruit, sea asparagus. This was my favorite appetizer: I loved both preparations of the salmon, especially the smoked version. I wished the appetizer was bigger.\\n\\n4th course: gnocchi, fava beans, mushroom sauce. This was the best of the pasta courses. The gnocchi were light, and the mushroom sauce was really tasty.\\n\\n5th course: pasta sheets with pork ragu: I also liked this dish, but the gnocchi won out for me. The pasta was light and fresh, and the ragu was good, though.\\n\\n6th course: hangar steak with greens, pine nuts and parmesan. By this time, I was getting full, so having a light main course was good. The meat was nicely prepared medium rare.\\n\\n7th course: lemon custard (?) with macerated cherries. Again, this was a good and light way to end the meal (lemon taste was nice and refreshing).\\n\\nI would skip this place if you are in a hurry: our dinner ended up taking over 2 hours (there were some 10-15 minute waits between courses). The service was good, although our main server was busy with a larger party the whole night. Overall, the price of the meal was decent for the quality, and you will leave full but not stuffed.

Everyone we interacted with was very kind, highly attentive, and seemed to genuinely love their work.

We loved the various textures in the dish. \\n\\nThe beef tartar was also very good. The carraway seeded crackers paired nicely with the creaminess of the meat and spread. \\n\\nAlso, the mushroom dumplings were fantastic. So many flavors to take in at once. We loved how they \\"popped\\" in our mouths and the sake and vinegar really worked well with the creaminess of the rest of the dish. \\n\\nThe Misses: We didn't love the fried eggplant. It was a pretty dish but the eggplant was very tough and hard to chew. Also, the breading was too coarse and the dish had a very one note vibe. Nothing stood out. \\n\\nUnfortunately, both of our \\"main\\" dishes weren't great. The blackened redfish and quail missed the mark. The crust on the redfish was overly burnt and the rest of fish was very dry. The quail had no discernable taste beyond charcoal and the spice of the stuffing. \\n\\nThe biggest miss was the noise. We were celebrating my wife's birthday and sat behind a large table (10 or so) of seemingly very intoxicated people. They broke glasses, had an altercation of some sort at one point, and were borderline yelling the entire night. Honestly, it ruined our experience.

I was JAZZED when I saw that a southern BBQ themed restaurant was coming to my near-in 'hood. Offering FRIED CHICKEN, no less! Before they opened, some of those nose prints on the window were mine and I liked what I saw. A LOT of thought and expense went into the decor and the space is quite pleasing. We had reports from a friend (who is a nearby business owner and thus got invited to a pre-grand-opening dinner extravaganza) that led us to believe this place would be DA BOOM that we hoped it would be.\\n\\nWe first visited a couple of weeks after opening. I had fried chicken. Ronda had a salad that (supposedly) included fried chicken. My fried chicken was good - not great. Easily 3+ stars. Ronda's salad had these chickeny looking things on top that certainly couldn't have held up in court as the fried chicken described on the menu. We questioned the server and got an overly involved explanation about the impossibility of providing what she expected (read: what was described on the menu). My friend had this very salad at the pre-soir√©e and, in fact, has had it subsequently and assures us there was bona fide fried chicken involved both times. I totally believe her. Maybe we were there on a bad night when the serving staff had instructions to defend the shortcomings. I decided to wait to review.\\n\\nSecond visit, I had catfish and Ronda had some sides My catfish was OK. My experience with catfish is that it can be sweet or it can be what I describe as \\"weedy\\". This was a bit on the weedy side, though still OK. Ronda's coleslaw was very good. the beans were MEH. She ordered the onion rings because we saw a plate of them delivered to someone else on our previous visit and they looked great. What Ronda received looked nothing like what we had seen previously. These rings and the portion were much smaller and much overcooked. Inconsistency might be a theme at SWK (so your results might vary;-) Still, I decided to wait to review as I had yet to taste the meat.\\n\\nTonight we went back for thirds and we shared the meat platter that includes ribs, chicken, hot links, pulled pork and brisket. This is only available as a \\"for two\\" platter (why's that?!?). For the two sides we chose mac & cheese and collards. Starting there, the mac & cheese was forgettable. Is there cheese in there? The collards were OK. The high point of the meat offerings was definitely the pulled pork - four star stuff. The brisket was good, though a bit dry. The ribs (baby back) weren't bad, but a bit overloaded with a too-salty rub. The hot links were OK. The chicken was barely recognizable as such due to whatever spice infusing technique they employed before (over)cooking.\\n\\nI can no longer wait to review. Service all three times was uninspired (to put it kindly). Food and decor I've described above. In some ways it's a relief that I'm done with SWK. I gave them what I consider to be a really fair shot and I don't need to go back.

Although it wasn't much, annual pass-holders got a 10% discount I believe at this spot. Of course on Thanksgiving, you unlikely will get seated right away so we had to come back an hour later to get seated which was okay since it was very easy to kill time at a theme park and we weren't super hungry to eat elsewhere. I got the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Ahi Nachos. The Chicken Tikka Masala was pretty good, the breast meat wasn't overcooked and nice and tender and the gravy was very flavorful with some heat. The naan was pretty good as well including the basmati rice. Of course the cost of the same dish at an Indian spot is much cheaper I kept in mind that it was in a theme park so you will have to pay theme park pricing. No complaints with this dish, would order again if I dined here again. To my surprise was the Ahi Nachos, I initially thought it was going to be 3-4 small tacos with Ahi chunks in it but it ended up being a huge platter of nacho chips and greens with generous chunks of Ahi. It was under the appetizer category so I didn't think the portion would be this grand which worked out very well for us. I would definitely order this one again, the fish was not fishy (fresh), generous portions, and the flavoring was on the spot. I believe it was either french dressing or thousand island dressing drizzled over the dish with good flavor. \\n\\nI would come here again if I wanted a dine-in restaurant to eat."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I don't normally eat donuts, but when I do, I eat an old fashioned buttermilk donut (and I'm not above the store-bought ones).

It was off to a good start. That's about where it ended. \\n\\nOnce we were seated, no one came by to collect our drink or appetizer orders. Eventually, I would say maybe 10 minutes later, someone who wasn't our server (he made sure to let us know that he was just helping her our, and wasn't our actual server) came by to bring us waters. Annoying, not the end of the world, but enough to make me second guess the choice of dining here. \\n\\nA little while later, the server came by. She collected our appetizer order and drink order. We had a couple of questions about the menu -- what was in a couple of the dishes, and which sauces were the hottest on the wings. Initially she said she didn't know, but seemed to decide that the Korean sauce was the hottest choice between when we ask, and when we ordered. (She was wrong, lol). \\n\\nThe appetizer came out -- Gardein boneless chicken wings with Korean Sauce --  and some mystery dipping sauce that tasted somewhere between hummus and ranch. Not great. Pretty flavorless. More importantly, not spicy. This was a disappointment. Instead of complaining, my guest and I ate them, left the mystery sauce, and thought we might do better with the main course. This time, we were wrong (specifically me, but my guest had some complaints, too). \\n\\nI ordered Gardein Chicken Fried Rice with veg. My company ordered a Beyond Burger with a salad. Again, my dish was mostly flavorless with overcooked rice. The veg were good, I will say that. I liked the asparagus and fungus in the dish. Everything else I could have done with you. My company ordered balsamic dressing for their salad, and instead got no dressing. Not the end of the world (again), but if you didn't have it, why would you offer it (or, more likely, if you forgot it, why wouldn't you bring it on the side)?\\n\\nFor me, the most annoying part was paying the bill. We asked to split the appetizer, and the server said, \\"Oh, I have to ask if we can even do that.\\" If you can split the tab in two, of course you can hit the bottom that says \\"split item\\" on the POS computer. This annoyed me. When she came back and said she couldn't do it, I grew more annoyed. I told her to put it on my tab and when to hand her my card. Instead of taking it, she directed me to pay using the tablet attached to the table. I cannot verbalize how cheezy that is. If I wanted a Chili's experience, don't you think I'da just gone to Chili's? \\n\\nThat aside, I thought poorly of it. They bill it as a convenience, but it isn't; in fact, it is an excuse to be lazy and an inconvenience. That, coupled with the long wait for our actual server, bland food, lack of menu knowledge and the unwillingness to accommodate leads me to leave a 1 star review. It is surprising to me that a place that is this bad is at a place like the battery. It is just like Chili's, just more expensive, with worse food and bad service. \\n\\n1/5. 0/5 will try again. \\n\\n-Nicolas"},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"451 S Goldenrod Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"1.5","text":"Terrible service. 28 minutes to get food for dine in.

A too-small slice of pork belly, moderate fatty and flavored with 5-Spice, but more steaky in texture than melt-in-you-mouth tender.  While the meat was small but good, the rest of the dish left me unimpressed.  A liberal slap of Hoisin, a bit of lettuce, and was there actually some pickles hidden in there?  I didn't notice.  Sort of pathetic compared to the original inspiration.  And the waitress admitted they purchased their buns.  Come on, your owner is a James Beard Award-winning baker and these are one of the easiest things in the world to bake.  Even this Irishman makes better at home!

Although I did find the crunchy texture a bit off-putting (was there finely ground peanuts in the sauce?).  Never had it with raw mung beans before, but I liked that textural element.  Mushrooms too.  Supposedly the spiciest thing on the menu, but for you spice-nicks this was only moderately spicy and not particularly mala.  My favorite dish.\\n\\nSHRIMP + TOFU NOODLE SOUP ($13): Ramen noodles, fermented tofu, farm egg\\n~A good sized bowl, this would probably be fairly satisfying on a cold day, if it weren't for that HVAC lol.

The wait was 1.5 hours, so we decided to come back early Tuesday morning. \\n\\nWe only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table on Tuesday, but I was really surprised there was even a wait then! They used to be owned by the owner of Chambar, which we had been to a couple days before, so the menu was similar. I ordered the breakfast paella and it was SO SO good. I don't usually like chorizo, but it was really flavorful and a little spicy. I'm so happy I ordered it. My boyfriend got the smoked salmon spread with avocado on focaccia and I tried it and it was also so bomb. Then we got waffles, of course, with mixed berry sauce and raspberry caramel sauce. Both sauces were amazing, and even more amazing together.\\n\\nI would highly recommend this place and everything we got."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"THE BEST barbecue I have ever had!

I tried 3 items on my very first visit. I was inspired also by the loving couple who owned the restaurant.\\n\\nPositives: The location is cool. Although parking is limited, there was easy access to Public Parking behind the restaurant. I saw a sign as I was leaving the lot that stated \\"permit\\" parking was allowed for four hours. So I was hopeful that this sign was a thing of the past.\\n\\nThe bartender, a female, was cordial. However, I noticed that the server stations were located behind the bar & there was an iPad or two being used. My biggest concern was exactly what happened -the bartender stepped away (because she did not write my order down) to ask me for a second time what I ordered. At that moment, a waitress with blond hair starts typing in an order. I immediately saw problems with this. Bartenders need their own station & servers need their own. Just old school waiter tips.\\n\\nNegatives: There was a young guy --employee--who apparently was there to get that money. He actually said he had 2 1/2 hours to go. I interpreted that as I looked on that he needed tasks to do. Thankfully a server came by and followed up with the bartender's suggestion that he asked everyone if the needed water. I sat at the bar and was not offered a water by anyone. He was told to do that twice. He was also told to clean up tables. He definitely was a novice at feeling the crowd and what they needed.\\n\\nThe food: I honestly can say that the wings were above board & so were the shrimp. However, the portion size -5 shrimp & 3 wings was way too small for the price. Unfortunately, the egg rolls tasted funny to me. They just didn't seem fresh. I'm sorry but I threw them out.\\n\\nI am not a person that lives on absolutes. I believe I will give the restaurant a second chance. It is my hope that they make improvements. The employees need to act like they want to be there. They could smile a lot more and treat each moment as an opportunity to please the customer."},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This was my second visit and both visits were good, but not outstanding.

I love fried pickles and these were more tempura-style, which I would definitely recommend.\\n\\nMy friend had the roadhouse burger with bbq sauce and crispy onion straws. He ordered it medium and it was delivered medium. He said it was a good burger, but was missing more sauce.\\n\\nI had the North Hills roll and it was fine, but it was not superior sushi.

One of the only places to eat and have a drink around the Amtrak station is Wilf's, so I decided to go in and have a drink. Decent reviews on Yelp seemed like a good environment so gave it a shot. \\nAs soon as I walked in it was a little off as the bartender/server was almost hostile when I walked into the bar. Almost as if I was inconveniencing her. She would not speak to me or check in on for literally 40 mins at a time. There were 4-5 tables of people around me throughout my stay and she would check in on those tables 2-3 times before checking in on me once. Also the entire time I was there I was never given a food menu. Everyone else was given a food menu (even others sitting at the bar) and they were all told what the specials were. I was never given the time of day.\\nI never go towards racism but it just seemed so overt here. I was the only minority in the building and I was the only one getting ignored. Reading the other reviews I keep seeing a name pop up of Joanne, not sure if this was her. 40's-50's darker curly hair, but did not see a name tag. \\nI really wanted to leave but there is nothing else around that is convient.

There's a nice variety of side dishes to enjoy with your meal.

My wife had a coupon given to her because she works nearby. She said it was good so I wanted to try it out.\\n\\nVery crisp decor. Inside and outside eating. You have three big screen televisions to see your menu. I'm not sure that's a brilliant cost saving idea. I would expect chalkboards or similar. Either way, I like that you can see them make everything behind the glass windows. As they put the fixings on you get to add things or subtract.\\n\\nI had the Big Kahuna which was very tasty. It was filled with flavor and even though I was extremely hungry it filled me up (which I thought it wouldn't). I got the standard combo with drink and chips. The soda fountain I really liked because the ice dispenser gives you crushed ice. I find that drinking root beer requires crushed ice to get it super cold (more surface area on the ice). Not a lot of places do crushed ice.\\n\\nThe price was right too. You can get a kid meal for under $4. The total bill for four people was under $25. But then we decided to get dessert which was the kloob nika which was filled with fresh fruit, whipped creme and some chocolate drizzled on the top, which knocked us up to over $32 for the dinner.\\n\\nOver all I think it was a awesome meal. Being intolerant of gluten I was worried but I didn't have the same problems I have when eating a sub or other bread heavy meals.\\n\\nI'll definitely go back but will need to make sure to try each item on the menu.

Their chicken was amazingly seasoned and crispy. Omg the skin is sooooooo good. And it was actualllyyy kind of spicy which is rare in these parts.
