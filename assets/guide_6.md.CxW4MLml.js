They definitely don't cheat you on the shrimp. The shrimp were plump and plentiful. We both had enough leftovers for a full meal the next day.

I ordered a King's feast which was $38.99 which came with 2 crab leg clusters which were cold, 12 jumbo shrimp although a good size seemed like they sat in boiling water for hours as it had a grainy, mushy texture, a bit of extremely thin sliced sausage and a bunch of potatoes (only good part of this meal.

You then get an option of sauce in in which we ordered the shabang for the feast and the garlic for the crawfish. HORRIFIC!! Both sauces tasted the same and drowning in raw flour which gave EVERYTHING a sandy texture. We ordered a side of hush puppies but it was served to us as an appetizer. Not bad but I've done better with a bag of frozen ones popped in the toaster oven. They boasted about the great 10% discount but I wouldn't go again even if they comped my meal. Everything was served on styrofoam plates, and cups, no crab leg forks, and the bathroom was disgusting. So much so that I completely understand why they have 2 clean sink areas on the outside so you can wash up after the mess. They truly need to close down and regroup, maybe even hired a management analyst. Oh yeah, the couple that sat right next to us griped about their dining experience too. They had leftover cups and plates from their meal to which the gentleman touched all over and instead of throwing it out they placed it back behind the counter with the other supply ready for another victim (customer).

We don't live in Atlanta, but come every couple months for a weekend and usually always trying to go somewhere new and different.  This time, I decided to return to the best meal I have ever had in Atlanta to see if it has stood the test of time and the verdict...absolutely YES!!!  Aria offers a truly wonderful dining experience.  From the moment you walk in and greet you, take you to the small but oh so sexy bar to get you set up with drinks, and escort you to your table, you know from the first moments their patrons matter to them.  Both wife and I started with a perfect fresh, simple, perfectly executed salad with arugula and escarole, spiced pecans, plums and wonderfully simple lemon vinaigrette.  For my entree I had the most succulent, fall off the bone lamb shank over a smooth polenta and roasted vegatables.  A wonderful start to fall.  Wife had the most beautiful, perfectly cooked scallops that had a great crust and melted in your mouth.  We finished with a shared desert of a warm apple tart with vanilla ice cream.  Sweet apples cooked into a great crust.  Its a beautiful restaurant with a romantic atmosphere.  Service is perfect.  Helpful, but not pushy and always there to help.  It is a place for a special night as it is pricey, but 5 star meals like this are and Aria deserves every star it gets.  Can't wait to go back.\\n\\n\\nJust a quick update.  Went again on a quick weekend visit to ATL.  I will say it again...one of the best dining experiences you will have ANYWHERE!  From the moment you walk into the restaurant you are greeted graciously and with a smile.  From helping you at the bar, to showing you to your table, everything is done with class and graciousness.  Not fou fou or uppity, but just treating you with the right amount of care and thoughtfulness.  No wonder they are nominated for a James Beard award for best service.  They are always there to help, but not in your face.  Just always in the background making sure you have everything you need.  New forks and knives just appear quietly without interruption, but are there.  \\n\\nAnd the food...just sheer perfection.  Had the arugula salad with just the right amount of Parmagiana regiano on top and a light lemon dressing.  My wife had a celery soup that had no cream, but was so rich and delicious, with black truffles that it was divine.  For entree I had the scallops which were perfectly cooked and although only 4, they were so big, I could not even finish the last one.  It was served with a beautiful mixture of peas and greens.  Wife had the lemon sole with a light Panko crust with capers and lemon buerre blanc sauce.  DELicious.  TOpped it all off with the apple tart served warm with just the right of ginger to cut through the sweetness.  The  crust was more like a cookie type crust and not pastry which I just loved.\\n\\nThis restaurant has never let me down, and I promise you it will only light up your life.

It wasn't planned, and we didn't have any reservations, so there was a 15 min wait for our seats for a party of 4. This place is in the midtown area of ATL. This is a nice small restaurant (of being compact, but they have an upstairs). There's an outside seating area by the walk way, inside area near the bar, and upstairs. The environment is very intimate and would be great for dates or a woman's night out.\\n\\nOur server was pretty cool and down to earth. She checked on us quite a bit, and took really good care of us. So I was very pleased with the service.\\n\\nIt looks like they offer a lot of good variety seasonally by looking at the pictures here on yelp. But The menu options for this season were ok, a little different than what I'm used to.  But it did cause me to order something out the ordinary.\\n\\nI ordered the Springer Mountain Farms Fried Chicken dish which came with collard greens and red bliss mash potatoes that were made from scratch and the table shared (Chef's Special) a bowl of purple rice with fresh green and purple carrots (was a weird dish, but tasted better than it looked). Apparently, after doing some short research I come to find that purple rice does have a few health benefits. Such as containing high levels of Antioxidants, has the ability to reduce inflammatory responses in the body, improves the health of your heart, lowers blood pressure, improves your digestive system, regulates blood sugar levels, and more. \\n\\nThe Fried chicken was GREAT....I'm a fried chicken connoisseur, I cook my own fried chicken by using my grand mothers special recipe passed down from generation to generation. So I know good fried chicken when I taste it..(even though its not better than mine :-)).  The chicken was cooked perfectly, and was nice and moist. It was crispy, and the texture was fresh. It had great flavor, and it was balanced well throughout the chicken. \\n\\nAnd of course, the mash potatoes was a great side to accommodate the fried chicken. It had great flavor, and was nice and creamy. Overall this place was pretty good and the environment classy. I would definitely come back here, and I'm interested in trying another dish. I would give 4.5 out of 5, due to the menu selection. But everyone in my party was pleased and really enjoyed every dish that was ordered...and my family KNOWs good food like BO KNOWS Football!!! lol ."},{"name":"Century House Restaurant","address":"235 Andover St","city":"Peabody","stars":"3","text":"This is painful to write since I have been eating here since the 1970s.

And when we heard it would be revamped Mexican, we were overjoyed.\\n\\nBut unfortunately, our experience left us completely disappointed.\\n\\nFor starters, the ambiance is nice.  They've done a good job renovating the interior into a nice space.  And in our view, it's the best spot in the Village - right on the corner of the busiest streets - which should be great for business.\\n\\nThe staff also were friendly, accommodating, and attentive.  No complaints there.\\n\\nNow to the food.  We started with the chips & guac, and as a previous reviewer said, the chips definitely tasted store-bought and the guac had almost no flavor.  We didn't even finish ours, which says a lot coming from our family.  The appetizer also seemed a bit overpriced at $7 for what you get.\\n\\nWe also got the carnitas taco plate.  The appearance of the dish was trendy.  But the flavor just wasn't there!  Neither the rice nor the beans had any seasoning.  And again, as a previous reviewer has said, the kale salad was odd.  It had chewy pieces in it that we eventually decided were bits of dates - quite frankly, a very strange ingredient to put into Mexican food.  We also were disappointed that you had to order a plate of all of the same tacos, rather than be able to mix & match different types of tacos to be able to sample a variety.  In our mind, a taqueria should allow you to enjoy tacos - and lots of different types in one sitting.\\n\\nWe also tried a braised beef taco bowl.  Again, the flavor was completely lacking and it seemed easy enough to make at home given that the dish lacked complex seasonings that are traditionally part of Mexican cuisine.  And at $14 for both the taco plate and the taco bowl, we just felt that they should have been better.\\n\\nWe hold out hope that Casa Vaca will succeed.  But it will take a serious revamping of their cooking for us to return.  Perhaps a visit to some of the other popular (and tasty) Mexican restaurants in town, like Por Que No or Teote, would serve to spice up the creativity and flavors of Casa Vaca's food."},{"name":"Sweet Tomatoes Pizza","address":"320 Chestnut St","city":"Needham","stars":"3.5","text":"I hope my wife or mom don't read this.

I really can't recall the meal I had due to my main mission, which was to enjoy drinks! I had a bit of everything including two of the Santos Dulce, the Passion Picante, and a few shots. I must say that all of my drinks were very delicious. My guest and I were the only ones enjoying drinks. There was also a group of older women sitting next to us that ordered a tall pitcher of Margarita and got quite tickled! Which I thought was awesome. \\n\\nOverall the establishment was clean and on a scale from 1-10 the staff were about as pleasant as a 6 given the fact that they were super busy. However it looks as if they are always super busy. If I had to give any advice to this restaurant it would be to make sure that they are well staffed during peek hours. We sat at the bar and the only unpleasant thing about our visit was that the service was highly rushed. The bartender did not take the time out to really connect with her patrons. The drinks were made with extreme speed due to the fact that she seemed to have to make drinks for the entire restaurant. From time to time a server would make their own drinks (for their customers) at a section to left side of the bar. \\n\\nWhen I visit an restaurant, more specifically a bar. I enjoy sitting down and chatting with my guest.

It's obvious that the owner is passionate and knowledgeable about all kinds of tea, and she was very helpful at making flavor suggestions.  I ended up going with Brazilian Guava and she also made me a special blend of silver needle white tea and lavender.  Both are great!  \\n\\nIn addition to loose leaf teas, hot tea, iced tea, bubble tea (yes, bubble tea), scones with lemon curd & clotted cream, munchies, cookies, etc are also available for purchase.

We got a bottle of wine, crab cakes, muscles in broth that came with bread and butter, and the fish dinner including mashed potatoes and veggies.

I might be biased because I've had better chicken in korea and la but the chicken here wasn't something I'd go out of my way to get. We also ordered the corn cheese which they completely forgot about, I think they said the kitchen didn't receive the order or smth like that. It wasn't a huge problem but rather a minor inconvenience. Again it tasted just okay but for 11-12 bucks I expected more and it was gone in an instant.\\n\\nAs for their drinks we ordered the strawberry soju and the rice wine. I'm not gonna lie, the strawberry soju was delicious but I can tell there was barely any soju. Might as well just call it a strawberry drink instead. I wouldn't order this if you were looking to get turnt.. nor the yogurt \\"soju\\".\\n\\nNow their service..... I can tell most of the workers hate their lives or atleast it looks like it. I get it, you're stuck working while other people are drunk and having fun with their friends but don't be such a debbie downer. There are other jobs out there that don't deal with drunks btw. Normally I wouldn't care but I think my friends were affected by it and felt a bit down and it just made the overall night less enjoyable. I'm sure if you were a non korean you would think they're being racist but trust, the workers hate everyone equally haha. There were a few workers that seemed aight, one girl was singing along to the songs while working and didn't have resting bitch face/ look at me like I personally insulted her or smth. I wish I could have tipped her and only her. When I went to go up to pay the girl was giving me a hard time because we split it 3 ways and one person was paying cash but needed change and I was paying for me and a friend by card. I think she thought I was drunk, which I wasn't and wasn't listening to me. When I corrected her math and told her to charge this amount for card she finally understood me. I would have tipped more but she just made me not want to tip anything. PSA: to the workers there if you don't treat people like shit, they will usually tip better, not always, but usually people are more generous if they actually like you.\\n\\nEither way this place will surely always have business esp amongst the korean crowd. I went like 2 days after NYE on a tuesday and it was still very crowded. The atmosphere was loud and bustling which can be exciting and I loved the music that they played, I kept jamming and singing along to it (Unlike at Pocha across the street that literally kept playing the same 10 songs over and over). But the service was a turn off. I mean if you make the experience a bit better people will want to come back. However this place should be super fun if you go with a good group of people because this place gets lit.

Googled and found Maraya.  While you can see the restaurant from OBT and Sand Lake, the entrance is off of neither, you've got to get to that lane that runs parallel to both.  The parking lot was spacious and completely empty.  We chose what looked like the entrance, and discovered it was not. On our way to the opposite side of the building, someone came out and let us in a side door (yes, those are entirely one-way glazed windows, and yes, they can see you from inside the building).  We were the only table in a vast and dark restaurant (looks like they might have large parties or banquets here).  It was very awkward.  Our server might've been the chef/owner's husband or relatively and I believe the only other staff person there.  It truly is like walking into someone's home and having the lady of the house make you  a meal.  The menu was limited in items, we started with Babaganoush and an off-menu offering, homemade Lebanese stuffed grape leaves, we were told they were very special and they do not offer them all the time.  I also had the Maraya's Signature Combo, falafel, hummus, and tabbouleh.  My dining companions had the Chicken Kabab and Kefta Kabab.  The other three entrees did not seem to fit in (Eggplant Parmagiana, Chicken Picata, Fish Parisienne).  The babaganoush was creamy and smooth, icy cold, mildly seasoned.  Pita were Lebanese-style, thin and chewy. The dolmades were long and thick, rather dry, but tasty, rice somewhat underdone, also stone cold.  The Falafel were piping hot out of a fat fryer, very, very darkly browned, well-seasoned, super crunchy and went very well with the smooth hummus (to moisten things up a bit) and the tart and fresh tabbouleh (to brighten the rest).  The kababs were both rather on the small side and dry.  We were cajoled into getting Baklava for dessert, we were told these were also homemade and very special.  They were fine specimens, very sticky (I was afraid I was going to lose a crown), not so much crunchy as the phyllo has heavily soaked in the honey syrup.  The gentleman was very nice but not talkative or easily affable.  The lady of the house came out for a brief visit to check on us, also not really a people person.  It seemed very awkward all around for us at least.  While were there another couple came in who were apparently regulars, whew, relieving us of undue concentrated attention.  I'm glad for them there are regulars, perhaps we will try it again."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"A foodie staple in Columbus!

We received a text message when our table was ready.  DH and I split the Loaded Pizza.  The pizza was delicious and contained all of the ingredients listed on the menu - and it was fortunately not too heavy with toppings, as one might expect.   We also had the beet and spinach and candied walnut salad.  The salad would have great if the beets had been cooked for a few more minutes (two people who also tasted our salad both agreed with me).  As it were, they were crunchy.   Our other guests chose the Gorganzola burgers, which received rave reviews.  Beware though as they are loaded with garlic!  The service was excellent and great pains were taken to ensure that our water glasses were always full.  \\n\\nNote: Our salad came first, and they were late giving us our Fries (which were supposed to be shared by all), and we were getting impatient!

Recommendations: Blue Oyster Sandwich, Impossible Meatballs, Menino Soy BLT, rosemary fries, Peruvian potato salad, Mexican coffee (it is small and expensive but tasty). Cons:  they do not customize anything... you can ask for them to leave out an ingredient but they try to make things automated to make the process quicker for their workers/ foolproof is the explanation I was given by corporate.. So you can't get a jusst (faux) egg with another type  of egg sandwich like the impossible sausage. They only do soft boiled eggs for most of their sandwiches (soft boiled eggs gross me out), the portions are not that big and the prices are a little on the steep side. Also, you have to pay attention because the menu is rotated seasonally and different locations offer different items based on demand so you must check out the menu the day you go and the exact location to be sure they have what you want. So the food is made from veggies but make no mistake, these are not low calorie, healthy options (tasty, yes!) and many are fried, breaded and slathered in tasty sauces.

Both were small appetizer sized, but surprisingly very filling. The smoked fish dip was mostly fish and not a lot of filler; went well with the crisps/crackers that came with it. Although the smoked pig tails was much smaller than I expected it to be (esp for $16!), but had amazing flavors. Sweet, salty, smoky, savory, it was all there. The grits were as good as any I've gotten in the south, and I especially loved the cheese crisps and poached egg, which added another layer of creaminess.\\n\\nThe space is fantastic--lots of different seating options and the bar is huge.

I am pretty sure the manager/owner stopped caring about this restaurant and is running it into the ground. \\n\\nI was excited to try Appetito since I have always heard good things about it. I was drooling when I checked out the menu online, and it clearly said that they have a honey roasted duck with mashed potatoes, which I was 100% going to get. \\n\\nWhen I walked into the restaurant they had a picture of the roasted duck leg as well with an award next to it and it looked so good. \\n\\nThe hostess seemed high. She slowly walked us to our table, and then lit a candle in front of us, which wasn't a huge deal but I was surprised they didn't just do it beforehand considering the restaurant was pretty empty and they weren't that busy. She handed us two sticky/old menus. I noticed that they had gotten rid of the duck leg on the menu, which is deceiving considering that they had it listed online. \\n\\nBefore we started ordering our waitress came over dressed in jeans and a regular shirt. She told us she had just gotten to work and would be right back because she needed to change since she just got there. I felt like that was weird but I didn't mind that much. I ordered a diet coke and when the waitress came over, she informed me that they were out of straws... HOW does a restaurant run of straws? The restaurant is also located ONE block away from Walgreens, so I do not know why they did not just go and pick some up. \\n\\nPrevious reviews also said that this restaurant gives you a good spread for the bread at the beginning. Instead, we just got some stale bread and plain butter. Also not a huge deal breaker considering it was free, but I was disappointed by not getting the yummy \\"spread.\\" \\n\\nFor our appetizer we ordered the mozzarella/tomato/basil/proscuitto dish. When it came out, it looked like a flimsy attempt at a dish with ONE basil leaf on top. It was pathetic. The tomato slices were so sloppy it looked like a ten-year old had cut them. The dish was decent, but it just looked like food I could have easily made myself for $2, and I don't know why it was the most expensive appetizer on the menu (normally $11). Even my boyfriend who rarely complains looked at it and was like \\"umm...\\"\\n\\nFor entrees, I ordered the pasta with linguine, basil cream sauce, saut√©ed chicken, broccoli rabe, and mushrooms. My boyfriend got the trout. While we were waiting, another waitress told the couple next to us that they were out of pumpkin pie. She said that the owner had gone out to the market to pick up more ingredients/supplies but was not sure what time he would be back. It seemed like a bizarre excuse. The couple asked if they could just get $7.95 taken off of their bill. Instead of just doing that, the waitress said she could not and wrote them a voucher to come back next time for dessert. I would've been annoyed if I were them because I would not have wanted to come back just for dessert.\\n\\nThe entrees came out and my pasta was good. I find it hard to mess up pasta though and since I'm not Italian, I am usually satisfied with most pasta dishes. My boyfriend's trout was horrendous though. It tasted very dry. His mashed potatoes were also very bland. Meanwhile as we are munching through dinner, the table next to us ordered a salad and the waitress came over and said \\"Sorry we are out of asparagus.\\" At that point I looked at my boyfriend and went, \\"Jeez... are they out of EVERYTHING?\\"\\n\\nFinally for dessert, the waitress tells us the choices are a warm chocolate pudding cake, or cheesecake. We ordered the pudding cake.  Of course, 5 minutes later, our waitress comes back and says, \\"I'm sorry we actually don't have the pudding cake, but we do have apple pie, cheesecake, or pumpkin pie.\\" SERIOUSLY? 20 minutes ago they didn't have pumpkin pie and now they do? It was so obvious that they had bought these desserts from the market. We went for the cheesecake and when it came out, our suspicions were proven when the dessert DID taste like a store bought cake. 100%. \\n\\nTo make matters worse, their credit card machine was not working. Luckily my boyfriend had cash on him.\\n\\nAlso, the other waitress seemed nice to her tables, BUT every time she walked by our table I heard her SIGH loudly like she was so irritated. It made me very uncomfortable.\\n\\nSO, overall, despite my pasta being good, Appetito was a terrible experience. HOW on Earth do they run a restaurant when they are out of everything? No straws, no asparagus, no dessert, no duck leg, no working credit card machine... This place needs to CLOSE immediately. What waste of space."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Franklins BBQ in Austin Texas k√∂nnte man auch als BBQ Heaven bezeichnen !

I loved the verdant spinach risotto it was served with. Also, the roasted parsnips had a natural sweetness and wonderful texture.\\n\\nWe opted for caramel apple toffee pudding served with fresh cream and almonds, and buttermilk chess pie with blueberry compote. I really enjoyed the desserts. They were just the right amount of indulgence and not overly saccharine. \\n\\nSCK Midtown does not have its own lot or valet parking.

They do however bring cornbread before the entree's appear.\\n\\nI had fried chicken, all dark and creamed corn. She had the quail and mashed potatoes. We split the mac n cheese.\\n\\nCornbread- 2 pieces of what has to be bacon drippings and a mother's love. That's the only way to describe this slice of heaven. We ordered a second batch. I would've asked for another but that woulda been greedy and selfish. I'm cool with that. \\n\\nQuail - simply delish! The honey was a very nice touch. \\nMac & Cheese - really it was to rich for me. I took maybe three bites and handed it to the Gods because I'm not worthy. \\nCreamy Fried Corn - I will sell a toe for this. Seriously. The big one. Creamy. Slightly sweet and savory. \\nMashed potatoes swimming in butter and your grandmother's kisses\\nFried Chicken- My granny's spirit was in the kitchen cooking this chicken. I almost went back there looking for her.\\n\\nAfter all of this we were full but then a table across from us had dessert brought out. They do this to trick you. At this point we had to do the whole kit and kaboodle. We ordered the lemon tart to split.\\n\\nOne bite and my stomach so no more please. It was delicious but at that point to much for me. I shall enjoy it tonight as a treat!\\n\\nAll this to say, we made reservations on the way out the door for our next visit. \\n\\nTips.\\n1. Go hungry\\n2. Go early\\n3. Bring some friends along\\n4.

I was not disappointed when I arrived. The building was really easy to find and had really cute decor all around. It's a bright green building. You can't miss it. \\n\\nUpon entering, I was greeted by the knowledgeable and friendly staff. The best part was, it smelled like heaven. The first thing you see is the giant case of freshly baked goods. There was such a wide variety! They had cheesecakes, faux-reos and even crack pies! I ended up getting a crack pie and fell in love. It was perfectly creamy and crunchy. I honestly don't even remember what was in it anymore, but I wish I had gotten five of them. \\n\\nThe menu was very simple. There are the regular menu items and there is another menu of the daily specials. The waitress told me that sometimes things in the specials menu are never remade, so if you like it, you should get it. I ended up getting a Seven Benedict (two fluffy biscuits, with an egg over easy, applewood smoked bacon, a fried green tomato and hollandaise) and the Roll in the Hayyyy which is a special hash brown casserole with an over easy egg, Canadian bacon, hollandaise, and a spicy bacon biscuit. The food came out super fast and it was all incredibly decadent and delicious. Definitely the best treat yoself meal in Orlando!\\n\\nMake sure to not have anything productive to do afterwards because you will possibly pass out after your meal. It is all worth it though. Luckily, I got the Nutella Tervo, (coffee, a shot of espresso, Nutella, and condensed milk) which is a weekend special. It was so smooth and was not too sweet. \\n\\nThe space itself was very intimate. There is seating for about twenty five people inside and twenty people outside. We didn't have anywhere to sit, so we got our breakfast to go. \\n\\nOverall, I give this place four stars. Although the food and baked goods were delicious, it is pretty impossible to get a place to sit. The ambience is just so nice in there, so it was really disappointing to have to take our food home to eat. \\n\\nJust make sure to come super early and wear light clothing just in case you have to sit outside.

I would go as far as to say it's my favorite BBQ spot in Atlanta.  The negative review comes from my personal feeling on waiting to eat food.  One Saturday we were meeting friends for lunch.  We got there at 11:30 and had to wait an hour just to sit down. On a Wednesday we went for a late dinner (7:00) and had to wait over an hour, by the time we sat down they were out of everything but Brisket and chicken.  We got in the last order of chopped brisket and next thing you know they are out of chicken wings.  \\nWhile the food is good, the wait is not.  It would be nice if they had invested some money into making their patio usable in the rain.  Or if they opened a second location to help disperse some of the traffic. \\nParking is also a HUGE negative for me. Usually we have to park pretty far away and the parking lot is nowhere close to having enough space.  \\nThe good thing is, after all these years, the BBQ is still great.

I was very disappointed when I found out the buns are not toasted. But on the bright side the tater tots were amazing. Cooked to a perfect crisp.

Oh my god.\\" After several minutes of being reassured that our table would be ready soon, we were finally seated in a secluded section in the back. There is also some outdoor seating that looks really cute. I can imagine having brunch out there when the weather is nice.\\n\\nTheir drinks are really good. I got the B&B Hurricane and it was right up my alley. If you like sweet and fruity drinks, that one is perfect.\\n\\nAs for the food, our server told us this place was \\"tapas style\\" and she recommended 1-2 plates per person to share. We started with 4 plates and kept a menu in case we wanted to order more, but we ended up being full after those 4 plates. We ordered the warm honey glazed biscuits, New Orleans BBQ shrimp, house special buttermilk fried chicken wings tossed with sweet & spicy sauce (plus white BBQ sauce on the side), and New Orleans style street corn.\\n\\nI would 100000% recommend the biscuits and the street corn. The biscuits come with a smoked cinnamon butter and pimento cheese spread- both of these spreads were so good and paired well with the biscuits. The street corn is cobs of corn smothered in spicy garlic mayo and ranch rinds. I love anything involving corn or garlic so I'm pretty biased but this was really good. It's kind of messy to eat, so just be warned... you might feel a little self conscious eating this on a first date or something. But honestly it's so good, just order it anyway!! You won't regret it.\\n\\nThe wings were a little lackluster in my opinion. When I think of fried chicken, I think of a crunchy exterior. I don't know if it's the sweet and spicy sauce coating the outside that caused it to become soggy, but it had no crunch at all. In terms of taste, it was just okay. We got the white BBQ on the side because we had never tried it before and we weren't sure what it would taste like. Our server told us it was a mayo-based sauce that kind of tasted like ranch, and that was a pretty accurate description. \\n\\nThe BBQ shrimp was a little salty but overall I liked the flavor, but it comes with grits that were too watery for my liking. The grits kind of ruined the dish for me but if they just had the shrimp without any grits I could probably eat an entire plate by myself.\\n\\nIt's dark inside (which is why I only have 2 photos to share and they're not good quality) but our table had a little candle, which I thought was a nice touch. The atmosphere in here is definitely interesting and they put a lot of thought into the decor. It does give off a NOLA vibe.

My sushi was pretty decent - not the highest grade sushi fish rating, but pretty close. I really enjoyed the pickled cucumber - perfect blend of sweet and sour in the pickling sauce. I wish they'd been more generous in the serving of the sweet potato fries, cause those were also tasty. The edamame were edamame - hard to mess up but I do wish a more earthy and sweeter salt was used for the seasoning. \\n\\nThe one thing I wish we'd asked for earlier were some sauces to try out! They'd 4 kinds that Frank bought out to us, and it might have made my dry veggie burger more palatable. \\n\\nBtw, we also ordered a milkshake \\"Yuzu Lemonade - $13.00\\" and shared that between the 3 of us - this was massively filling and quite delicious.\\n\\nOne other quirky thing - if it's your bday, the waitstaff come out and serenade you with gongs! Actually massive gongs - I guess that's the hat-tip to Japan! It was very unexpected and cute.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed the food and the service was absolutely fantastic- so definitely will return when back in the area. Recommend! \\n\\nYelp 158/ 2018"},{"name":"The Oakwood Canadian Bistro","address":"2741 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The bartender has considerable knowledge about the menu and also had considerable knowledge when picking out a bottle of wine.

My husband ordered the meatloaf that was wrapped in bacon.  It wouldn't have been my first pick but was probably the best meatloaf I've had.  Very tender and the bacon was rendered and crispy.  The sides were the sweet potatoes, grits, roasted turnips, pole beans and the collard greens.  I did not care for the pole beans as I found them to be too mushy.

The venue is located near the intersection of Robinson and Primrose in the Milk District. It is a smaller location with limited parking, so you may need to drive around to park during busier times.

My wife originally was going to order the famous 7th Trimester, but she decided to get the Seven Benedict instead, so I decided to order the 7th Trimester. It is an Eggs Benedict dish covered with mac & cheese (another common Atlanta dish). After ordering, we sat down at some very tight-knit booths and waited for our order. Most of the people at the restaurant were regulars and very willing to talk to us about 7 Bites and brunch in general in Orlando.\\n\\nOur food arrived about 5-10 minutes later. We both liked our food, but my wife loved hers much more than I did. The 7th Trimester is tasty in general, but they include/depend on waayyy too much mac & cheese for the dish. It would probably benefit them both financially and quality-wise to keep it to more of a 50/50 composition. \\n\\nAs we were about to leave, a small berry cheesecake caught my eye. I decided to order one (since each one was a little expensive at something like $6-$8) and take it with me to try.

However, they have a ton of baked goods, so I am very willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and try it again.\\n\\nOverall, while my experience was a little closer to 3 star than 4 star, 7 Bites does provide an excellent and unique brunch experience that reminds me of the Atlanta scene, so I would definitely recommend giving them a try."},{"name":"Mo Cha Tea House","address":"12520 SW Farmington Rd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I like the boba here and the prices aren't too bad, but I only come on days where I have nothing to do after.

I thought nothing of it at first until he did it to my friend while she was about to flip to the page. \\n\\nSecondly, you see my water is out... I didn't want to keep throwing back alcohol waiting on my food but you continuously walk past our table and help everyone else. We sat right at the front door, the very first booth next to the salad stand.. you have to pass us to get to the other side where you're serving the others. I'm patient, so I just brush it off thinking maybe he has a big party. No, this man would look at us the whole time we ate with no drink and keep walking right past. It got bad the hostess (the MVP of our afternoon) kept refilling it for us bc she was bored and would look around seeing we weren't getting a refill. To make matters worse he would have the jugs of water and tea in his hand and getting his attention sure as hell didn't work.\\n\\nThird, the appetizer tasted better than my whole meal. I wanted to cry when it was all gone.. that dirty rice didn't have any type of flavor.. & don't get me started on that \\"sweet potato\\" that tasted like cardboard. I wish I took a picture of what my plate looked afterwards.. my Bourbon Salmon was hitting the spot, but I really love sweet potatoes. \\n\\nConclusion, this man got a $5 tip from me. My bill was $28.72 and I would've given $10 if he would've brought our checks back to us. Why do I have to call your manager over for my card and receipt back? Why do you walk past our table and NOT give my debit card and bill? So guess what, my friend didn't even tip him. I have friends who work and food service and it's okay to have a bad day.. but when I see you being overly friendly to everyone else BUT us, and then you ignore our service... yeah buddy that's not about to happen. \\n\\nI WON'T BE BACK!"},{"name":"Moojo","address":"630 Ralph Ablanedo Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"What a cool place right on the UT campus!

Nothing. We can all add our anecdotal evidence to either lend credence to the claim that the famous Franklin Barbecue line is worth it or to make a case that it is not. I'm not going to get into that argument because that's one I don't see ever getting resolved.\\n\\nWhat I can tell you is my experience of the food. \\nBut I'll start off with just a little bit of my naivety when it came to trying to beat the Franklin Barbecue line. Here's me on a Saturday evening in Austin watching the fine folks tailgate for the Longhorns game thinking there would be a lot of pounding heads and snoring fans that wouldn't get up early and fresh on a Sunday morning to make it to this famous institution. So naive.\\n\\nSo we walked into the parking lot at the (relatively) late time of just after 8 AM and there were already about 60 people ahead of me, some having breakfast, some doing push ups, some just spread out on a lean bit of grass, some shifting from one side to another to avoid the ray of sunshine that suddenly poked out of the clouds and into their faces. \\nThere were some websites I looked at that said any time after 8 on a weekend and you probably won't eat. I'd say there are too many scary stories about the Franklin Barbecue line and I don't want to speculate about how some people working the stories for these sites and blogs can aggregate enough data to make claims that like that, but this piece of advice was definitely not the case for me and the long line of people after me.\\n\\nWe had a wait until about 12PM (just in time for alcohol sales on a Sunday in Texas) to get to place my order. \\nI decided on a half pound each of the brisket (all fatty please and no lean), pork ribs and sausage (Half a pound is approximately 3 links - got 2 of the regular and one with the cheese). \\nAlso got a side of the potato salad and some bread to mop up.\\nOh and an Austin Beerworks Peacemaker to wash it all down.\\n\\nI was so glad that the temperature was mild and not too hot to be uncomfortable that I was able to take my food out on the patio. What I was not glad and was feeling guilty about was that the ever stretching line now had access to watch me eat while they waited. I avoided eye contact and didn't glance up from my food.\\n\\nThe brisket as so many, many reviews will tell you is really, really good. Meat candy. That bark. That smoke ring. Fatty brisket, so tender, it fell apart on my fork and melted in my mouth. I'm still salivating thinking about it.\\nThe pork ribs were also on point, and that seasoning and bark were something else. I've eaten my fair share of ribs and I've never had one with a crust that perfect.\\nThe sausages were not a home run for me, they had a great snap back but were not as moist/juicy as I would have liked.\\nThe potato salad was also not the best I've ever had, but I like the taste of mustard and I was not there to eat potato salad. \\n\\nI'll judge on meat. And their BBQ sauces which I thought were excellent. Although the meat definitely didn't need that.\\nI usually cringe when I read the term \\"meat candy\\" because it's overdone and NOT cutesy. \\n\\nAnd I've already used it twice in this review.

They had a wonderful flavor, cheddar and chive (I believe) and they were cooked to perfection.  (This coming from a Texas girl who grew up eating grits all of her life.)  The Nutella coffee was the shot of happiness and sunshine I needed after paying my civic duty.  Dang! It was amazingly tasty and pleasing.  Mmm..mmm..MMM!

We decided to share several dishes. For lighter dishes we had the kale salad, roasted carrots and grilled broccoli. All of the dishes were delicious but let me tell you...the carrots and broccoli were out of this world. The carrots were roasted in a sweet glaze and on top of a Parmesan custard. The custard was salty and nutty and lended the perfect soft texture to the tender carrots. The broccoli was charred to perfection and on top of a hummus with toasted seeds. The hummus was the flavourful and heart and the ideal addition to the Smokey vegetable. For meat dishes we had the salmon and pork belly. The Salmon was cooked perfectly and on top of roasted potatoes with some sort of mystery pur√©e that lended to the smooth fish. The pork belly was crispy and atop a corn grit.

(note:  other specials clock in at $7.99 and under)\\n\\nThe soup was awesome and flavorful.  I really enjoyed the samosas and sauces too.  The veggie curry was so good, even Hubby ate it! The chicken tikka masala was yummy and well-spiced, although the sauce was a bit thick for my liking.  I would still highly recommend it; its just not the best CTM I've ever had - at least it wasn't swimming in oil or greasy!  Truly - it was good!   The garlic naan, however, was hands down the BEST garlic naan I've ever enjoyed.  I see from other reviewers that I'm not alone in this proclamation!  I would return just to eat the garlic naan.  \\n\\nI didn't come close to finishing my lunch and actually skipped out on the dessert as a result.

I used to come here weekly back in those days, but kinda fell off the radar once I no longer worked nearby. I was in the area today and decided to stop by my favorite Georgia Rib Joint.\\n\\nIt's been about 5 years, but I was surprised and happy to see they now take credit cards!!! Although that didn't really matter since I brought cash. My next surprise was there was absolutely no line. It felt a little weird to walk right in and straight to the counter to place my order. That has never happened before. And my final surprise was more of a disappointment. The chicken and fish shack next door was no longer open for business :-(\\n\\nFor the sake of reviewing, I sampled my meal prior to leaving and taking it home for later consumption. I must say I was a little disappointed with FM ribs for the very first time. They were the usual fall off the bone tender, however, they seemed to be missing something that I can't quite put my finger on. I think it had to do with the meat quality, or perhaps my ribs were overheated and that could account for the strange texture with my 1/2 slab ($10.95). Still better than most, I reluctantly give them a 4 when my taste buds are arguing a 3-star is more appropriate. The Mac and Cheese ($2) was great and so were the collard greens ($1.50).

We went here as a birthday celebration for our grandmother (5 people). \\n\\nPros: The staff was friendly, our server was extremely nice, even with the busyness of the restaurant. She told us her recommendations when we asked, as well as told us what the popular dishes were. The food tasted really good, and seemed to be well prepared. The portions were okay. I had the \\"lite\\" portion of the salmon, which was the perfect amount for a light eater like me when paired with the soup of the day (extra $) and the mediterranean appetizer. The Caramel Appletini I had was delicious and tasted like desert (how I had hoped), and the huckleberry mule my boyfriend had was also very good. \\n\\nCons: There were not a lot of options in my opinion, and most of the options I had noticed were not very vegan friendly, but I don't always eat vegan so I opted to get fish instead of a heavy pork dish. However, I had bites of my tablemate's food and they were all very good tasting. The restaurant was pretty loud so it was hard to hear ourselves and our server when talking to each other. And the biggest con to me was the expense for what we got. Everything was very highly priced, and I feel like it could have been more food for the price we paid, but I do not go to many places like this except on special occasions. \\n\\nOverall, I would recommend it if you have a nice occasion where you want something tasty but aren't picky, and have a large pocketbook."},{"name":"Pallookaville Fine Foods","address":"17N Avondale Plz","city":"Avondale Estates","stars":"3.5","text":"My Midwestern-born-and-raised SO says this place isn't better than the county fair. Never having been to one, I'll just have to take his word on that. \\n\\nWe both agreed, though, that Pallookaville was pretty disappointing. The food wasn't impressive, it was barely just okay. And it pains me to say that because the service was just fantastic. So four stars for service and two stars for food make three stars. \\n\\nI had the corndogula (beef frank while my SO had the cornleone (Italian sausage). The meat on both was good, but I didn't quite care for the batter. Such a bummer. It tasted off, like it'd been fried in old oil or burnt oil or something. I'm no expert on frying, but I'm pretty sure that's where the problem was. \\n\\nWe also split a pork burger, which was...fine, I guess? We got the smallest one, the 1/4 pound. It was probably the most unremarkable thing I've eaten all week. Not to say it was bad. Just...boring. \\n\\nAnd then there was the fries. They were soggy, bland, and the cheddar cheese we got with them came in clumps on top. This was fine for the few minutes the cheese was still deliciously melty. But once it cooled and hardened a bit, I had to hold the cheese down on my fry and then pry the piece of cheese from the larger blob. I feel like this could have been fixed by either using shredded cheese, or even better, a cheddar sauce (which honestly, is what I was expecting). I will say that the \\"Graveyard Dirt\\" seasoning, of which there is a shaker on each table, helped a lot with the fries. \\n\\nThe best thing I had was the Mexican chocolate milkshake. It was really good, with cinnamon, granulated sugar, and a bit of cayenne to tickle your throat. I actually ordered the shake to go, anticipating being stuffed to the brim with food. I was, but the lure of the shake was too strong, and I definitely started in on it on the way home. \\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier, the service was great. From the hostess to the bartender to the server, everyone was friendly and really enthusiastic. We got there right at the end of the dinner rush and they were able to get the finished tables cleaned pretty quickly. After around 8:30 (on a Monday), the place cleared out quite a bit. \\n\\nA couple of other notes, the bathroom is single-occupant, brightly lit and clean. There is a smallish parking lot behind the restaurant. \\n\\nI wouldn't mind coming back and trying some of the other menu offerings. My SO, however, doesn't feel the same way and in fact, is now hellbent on taking me to an actual county fair.

My BF ordered the two pieces chicken and waffle. It was big. The waffle was really good. I actually really enjoyed that over my own meal. The chickens once again had a lot of fries battered. We also ordered the praline bacon. It's caramelized with pecans, brown sugar and cayenne. That was the star of our meal for me. It came with three pieces.

Sadly, my experience with these tacos the handful of times I've been there has been mediocre at best.

By the time I unwrap the foil and take a bite, the potatoes and eggs have fused into a lukewarm homogenous mass that fills the stomach but fails to touch the soul. Much the same for the sausage and egg and other combinations, but the potato/egg combo has a special power to transform into a gut bomb after a few hours in a warming tray.\\n\\nThe location is good and the parking is perfect (what other downtown eatery actually has parking available and unfilled?), but the food needs help.

It's fun and casual and totally \\"Disney \\", although technically not related to Walt Disney world, but you know what I mean; the sensory overload and high prices typical of a lot of establishments in the Orlando area. Anyway, I started with the Grapefruit Smash drink, which was light and refreshing. We shared a sushi roll and the Trufffle burger and the candy bar ice cream cake. Everyone at the table was very happy with their food. The service was attentive and friendly. The food arrived at an appropriate time and we never felt rushed. This is located in the middle of all of the Universal shops and restaurants and it's a really fun area. Would definitely recommend!"},{"name":"Revival","address":"129 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Pros: southern hospitality; cute southern home setting\\nCons: food was too salty or undercooked (see pictures of our red pork chop), we were never offered or given tea or coffee with our family meal; poor value of family meals if you have a party larger than 2\\n\\nEhhhh...I have been looking forward to trying Revivial and finally got around to it when we had some friends visiting. Our group of six adults got the family style meal, which is $42 a person. This is the worst decision that we ever made. The sell is that you pick an entree and dessert and they \\"fill\\" the table with hors d'oeuvres, trimmings, corn bread, tea and coffee. \\n\\nHere are the things that the don't tell you: 1) there is a $5 upcharge for any higher priced entree, 2) hors d'oeuvres is one finger sandwich per person and a small portion of the shared kale salad 3) there are five trimmings that they choose to include with the family meal. The NUMBER and SIZE of the five trimmings are the same regardless of whether you have 2 people in your party or 6. You do not have any control over which trimmings are chosen. Also, the trimmings they chose are pretty much the five cheapest trimmings offered.\\n\\nThe family meal is a horrible value. If you do the math, you \\"break even\\" if you are a party of 2 but you could have done the exact same thing and chosen the trimmings you wanted. IF you are a party larger than 2, DON'T DO THE FAMILY MEAL. You are better off if you ordered everything individually. You can trust me or do the math and you will understand what I mean. \\n\\nThoughts about the food...we were a group of 6 so we pretty much ordered and tried everything on the menu. Here are my thoughts: \\n-toasted deviled ham tea sandwiches with pickled vegetables: nice and crisp bread but the sandwich (just ham and bread) was drenched in oil. We got one small tea sandwich per person. The pickled vegetables were sour but I'm not generally a fan of pickled veggies anyway. PASS!\\n-kale salad with apples, charred onion, and cheese: the paring of the apples and cheese with the kale was excellent. The charred onion was undercooked so it was not very good. OK\\n-fried chicken: you get three small pieces. it was good and not too oily. Don't expect traditional home style fried chicken - it is more of an upscale fried chicken. OK\\n-cornmeal fried catfish: thin white fish with a green sauce on top. This was done well, even for people that may not normally like fish. GOOD\\n-potato pancake: it was a simple dish but it was done well. nice vegetarian option. GOOD\\n-Bone-in pork chop: BAD BAD BAD it was very chewy and tasted a little weird but we thought it was because it didn't mix well with everything that we were having. When we had a chance to take a look at it in better lighting, it turns out that the entire pork chop tasted weird because it was UNDERCOOKED. It is tricky because it is covered in BBQ sauce so you can't really tell that it is RAW when you are in the restaurant with the dim yellow lighting. All of the guys ordered this dish so I hope our guests don't end up with food poisoning from consuming raw meat!!! PASS\\n-smoked collard greens: salty salty salty. couldn't taste anything but the salt. PASS\\n-mac n' cheese: gooey cheese lathered over macaroni. GOOD\\n-fried fingerling potatoes: nice and crispy duck-fat fries. bit salty but decent. OK\\n-roasted cauliflower: it was chopped up cauliflower. more on the plain side. nothing remarkable about this side. OK\\n-red peas and rice: moist and flavorful. OK\\n-triple chocolate tart with candied orange: rich and decadent OK\\n-lemon icebox pie: crossover of a lemon meringue pie and key lime pie. it was amazing. GOOD\\n-gingerbread cake with cream cheese ice cream: warm spice cake and the ice cream is a nice complement; works if you like \\"spice\\" OK\\n-fried apple pie with vanilla ice cream: Flaky turnover crust with apple filling. touted as the best dessert but it was just ok. OK\\n\\nThe good things about Revivial: the restaurant is set in a giant Southern style home so it is very quaint and has southern charm. You do get a great sense of Southern hospitality here.\\n\\nWe were with a group of friends that were visiting Atlanta for the first time so we didn't want to ruin the meal by complaining about our undercooked entree or the missing tea/coffee. Overall, this was just not a good experience and I recommend that you save yourself the misery and enjoy dinner somewhere else or come here and order your dinner a la carte."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

We would have got ribs because they were behemoths going by on plates, but they ran out right as we were ordering. Somewhat devastating but I guess I pushed through since we cleaned our plates in like 30 seconds. Also, the macaroni and cheese was better than I'm used to at my local South Carolina BBQ places too.

The staff was EXTREMELY friendly and helpful.  I just have heartburn about their price points. I ordered the snow crab legs to go - Cajun style and very spicy. You pay by the cluster rather than pounds, so I took a gamble and ordered.  I felt like I got ripped off b/c the 2 clusters I got could not have been more than a pound. So $26 later plus tip, I go home to eat the overcooked snow crab legs that were messy as hell.  This is not the first place that served them extry wet in a bag...maybe its a trend now?

Close to North Station / TD Garden, it's a comfy medium-sized place with a friendly vibe and a bar. Bar is decent sized and there's maybe about 20 tables in there. The lighting when we went in was pretty dark but it was suitable. At one point, a whole row of lights was turned on and it got VERY bright. After a few minutes, they were turned off and it was definitely better. It didn't get too busy or too loud and there were lots of space.\\n\\nI got the fried chicken sandwich and my boyfriend got the burger. The price seemed a bit high but we later found out it's because they automatically added on $2 fries. If you don't want fries or the pickle and just want the main food, be sure to ask for no fries. I'm really not a fries person at all and find that most restaurant fries are too thick and aren't salted well enough. These fries however, were bomb. I ate every one. I was also afraid that the chicken would be kind of dry and before it came out, was almost regretting not getting a burger. After seeing and tasting it though, was very satisfied with what I got. There was a lot of sauce, spicy mayo I think, on it and at times I couldn't even really taste the actual chicken, which I was fine with. The slaw was amazing and the combination just tasted so great. When I finally did taste the chicken, it wasn't dry at all; very juicy. No complaints about the burger either and  it was just delicious as well.\\n\\nService was good and the staff were friendly and attentive. Good atmosphere, comfy seats and some screens to watch games on.

Place is clean and staff was friendly. I like that you can pick and create your own version of the dish. The meat was not bad and the veggies were fresh and plentiful. I don't think it was as good as just going to an Asian or Thai restaurant like I typically would. There were  about 5 sauces to pick from but I didn't know what to pick or how the different sauces to choose from tasted  - maybe they should have some way to sample the sauces. They did say that I can add any sauce, seasoning and ingredients that I want to create whatever sauce I want but I am not a chef and do not know how to make great sauces so how do I know what to tell them to add or add - I wouldn't  know if I was even crafting something I would like? I think just choosing  your own protein and vegetables is great but  would just like some more choices of fresh premade sauces so I don't need to bring in my own recipe  to make something like a cashew chicken with a peanut sauce. The fried spring roll was a little doughy with not much in it so I don't think I would order it again but everything else was ok including the price and portions. \\n\\nI liked it ok but for some reason not really sure if care if I go back. I think I could have gotten more of what I liked with better sauce ordering off a menu at one of my other goto places. I'd say it is a great lunch option and worth giving it a try.

It took us a few months of visiting WDW to find this little tequila bar, but once we did, we made sure to stop by here every time we came to Epcot. There's a lot to be said about this bar, but to summarize, this is a wonderful little place to get out of the heat and away from the crowds of the World Showcase and enjoy some very tasty margaritas and wonderful Mexican snacks. Here's some more detail about why we grew to love this place so much:\\n\\n1) The setting: because this little bar is tucked back inside of the Mexico building, it's always very calm, cool, quiet, and peaceful, even when the rest of the World Showcase is packed with people and the sun is blazing down. There can be a line to get in, but we have almost always been able to sit right down at a table. Within minutes, we were relaxing with cool drinks while waiting for the park to calm down. \\n\\n2) The drinks: absolutely amazing. The margaritas here are a BIG step up from the grab-and-go margarita hut that's located outside of the Mexico building, with premium tequila and much better flavors. However, the prices aren't really that much different than the hut outside, so for basically the added cost of a tip, you'll get a much better drink (the best margaritas in all of WDW I would say) AND a cool table to drink it at. We especially like the \\"Wild One,\\" but all of them are good.\\n\\n3) The food: just chips and dips, but really good chips and dips. We always get the chips and salsa, and then just keep refilling the chips (I think it's $2 per refill). It's a great snack for the middle of the afternoon!\\n\\n4) Service is always quick and friendly, just like you would expect from Disney. \\n\\nIf you are in WDW and looking for a cool spot to take a load off AND drink some really, really good margaritas, make a bee-line for the Mexico building and check this place out!"},{"name":"King Cajun Crawfish | Colonial","address":"9728 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"We were passing through the area around dinner time and I was starving so we pulled into the first place we saw that looked tempting and pho was on my mind that night.  When we first walked in, there were only 2 tables occupied and it was around 8pm on a Saturday night, definitely not a good sign in my mind...  Then we settled in and I pulled out my trusty Yelp app and to my shock and slight horror, saw a 2.5 star Yelp rating on the place.  We would normally never stop at a 2.5 star Yelp rating location but it was too late, we had already ordered and again I was starving.  So I thought, ok, just suck it up, eat what you can and get out as fast as we could...  I ordered the beef ball pho and the fresh roll.  To my surprise, both items were pleasantly descent.  The broth in the pho was... gulp... dare I say it? better than some other places in Orlando.  Though I generally don't consider Orlando to be a place that has very good pho (even though there are a ton of pho places).  In my mind, the king is still in Tampa, read my other reviews if you want to find out which place that is... trust me, the place is good...  But I digress, the service at Pho 80 was pretty good, our waitress was very attentive and in general, the service very good.  Overall, I didn't think this place deserved a 2.5 star Yelp rating, not sure why there are more than expected number of 1-star ratings of this place.  Maybe it used to be much better and people are disappointed now? not sure... nonetheless, I would say this is more of a 3-3.5 star place.  As we sat there and had dinner, the restaurant filled up nicely to more than half full... maybe people in the general area just like to eat later in the night?

Jake's has been one of Portland's best and most Iconic restaurants for over 100 years. Sadly, my review today is not so good. We ordered their Margarita's which are some of the best anywhere! Then  an order of Steamed Mussels, fantastic as usual! Then things went south. We both had the Blue Plate Special Fish and Chips. The Cole Slaw was dry, bland and almost no dressing. The Cod was sliced lengthwise thin, then breaded with Panko. The breading was way over the top, and over fried. We probably should have sent it back, but didn't.  The taste was 80% Panko breading bordering on burned, hard as a rock. Fish and Chips is always a risky menu item to order anywhere, because many restaurants are so in love with either Panko breading or Beer Batters, that the fish gets lost. The Cod should be the star of the dish, not buried. At home, I simply dip the Cod pieces (an Inch thick) into egg wash and then shake in a sack of regular flour, salt, pepper, a little garlic powder, and a few shakes of smoked paprika. So simple, and so much better! Results in a very thin, crispy crust and makes the fish itself shine! I've fixed this for family and friends many times and they all say it's better than any restaurant. Get a clue Jakes! You can do so much better than what we experienced today. We still love you, but will steer clear of your fried fish items in the future! Hope someone from the restaurant actually sees this review. I've been a loyal customer for 60 years!

I ordered my food several weeks ago to try out their pre-order. I ended up going straight to picking up my order out and around Franklin's main line. I went in briefly just to actually look at the decor and get a feel for the ambiance. Was very impressed and i will also like to mention the staff is attentive and polite.\\n\\nNow to the food, how can i describe this 50/50 ratio of heaven. The pepper hits your face with a bat and the salt is the ice to cool down the swelling. Damn this stuff is good. The turkey was moiste and crusted perfectly. The brisket was smoked to perfection with a smoke ring to die for. The sweetness of the wood seaps out of the fat. Everything was cooked to my liking. My 2 favorites so far are the ribs and the brisket in that order. I had to try all the bbq sauces and they all are very tasty if you like ketchup based sauce. \\n\\nAll in all i loved the food. I ate it for 3 days straight.  Did i mention i got to meet Franklin himself. Shook our hands with a side of some brief conversation.  Just shows his humility and dedication to his striving business. Will most definitely come back and taste more food on thier menu.

Don't order this on a first date.\\n\\nI haven't had the chance to try their other options, but my sister said that the one time she strayed away from her usual chickpea fritter order at Clover, she regretted it, so I don't think I'll be trying anything else anytime soon. \\n\\nTwo other things I loved on my visits:\\n-They are clearly focused on environment and sustainability\\n-Free seltzer water!"},{"name":"Tia's Waterfront","address":"200 Atlantic Ave, Fl 1","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Stopped in for some apps, inside was full so had to sit outside but still had a nice table.

We did wait quite some time before receiving our food and our server came by to tell us that our order had accidentally been missed and that she would take our drinks off of our bill. Unfortunately when the French toast arrived it wasn't even warm. What I was most impressed with besides the delicious food was how the general manager handled it. He came by to apologize and assured us that he was going to make sure the next order was hot. Once it arrived it was worth the wait as it was delicious.

Perfectly seasoned, I drool just thinking about them\\n-The Kale Salad - what's so special about a Kale salad, you ask? The pistachio dressing! My mother-in-law loved this salad as well, and we looked up the recipe immediately afterwards. It was a great complement to the other heavier dishes we ordered\\n-Cinnamon Roll, Breakfast Skillet, and a side of bacon - all these were good, just not as memorable as the first three. \\n\\nYou do have to share some dishes for brunch as the dishes were small, so I probably wouldn't be able to afford coming here all the time, but it was a wonderful place to visit for brunch and probably my favorite in Harvard Square."},{"name":"Jim Adams Farm & Table","address":"2011 Bolton Rd NW, Ste 109","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Found this hidden gem right by my apartment.

They delivered with the wrong flavor on my crust.  Thinking it was a small issue, I called and informed the of the mistake, explaining that I wouldn't normally call in but I was pregnant (laughing it off as a craving).  The person on the phone spoke with me in a condescending way and told me to hold the pizza for the driver.  With no apology, he said I'd have to wait another 45 minutes, then hung up on me as I was speaking.  So I called back and told them I would drive there instead.  I drove up there and was pretty upset about the way the issue was handled.  The manager tried to snatch the \\"mistake\\" pizza from my hand then when I refused, he went ahead and made me a correct pizza.  When I thought the isue was over, I took the new-right pizza home.  I felt something was wrong when I noticed the employees watching as I walked to my car and backed out of the parking lot.  My husband noticed painted words on the back of my car.  I don't think I can post the words, but rhymes with \\"runt\\" meant derogatory towards women.  So we drove back and filed a police report.  As we waited for the police to arrive, the manager came out of the store yelling and asking if we were trying to start trouble.  He, of course, told the police none of his employees painted on my car.  A few days later, I called the corporate number.  I spoke with \\"Jack\\" the franchise rep who informed me that he can't force his franchise owner to call me and there is nothing he can do.  It has been 3 weeks now and I have not heard back from anyone at Hungry Howies (corporate or store level).  We tried to wash off the paint with water and a non-abrasive Toyo-Gaurd cleaner, but it has scratched up my car.  The damage to my car is close to $500.  P.S.

Even still, we were able to get some \\"brunchy\\" things on the lunch menu and it was still a very enjoyable meal.\\n\\nSETTING: This is a garden level restaurant so you walk downstairs to enter. The dining room feels somewhat like New Orleans with the tile floors and how the tables are set-up. You are close to other diners but not uncomfortably so.\\n\\nFOOD: I would describe the menu as Southern small plates. They have classic Southern dishes like fried chicken and the best damn biscuits you will ever eat. We ordered 4 to share amongst us two which ended up being more than enough because the portion sizes were larger than most other small plates restaurants in the city.\\n\\nFRIED CHICKEN - They call this their \\"house special\\" and I can see why. I had the boneless fried thighs with the Nashville hot seasoning and these were some of the moistest pieces of fried chicken I've ever eaten. Definitely go with the thighs when you order the fried chicken here.\\n\\nWARM HONEY GLAZED BISCUIT - Son of a biscuit, these were damn good. I'm not a big biscuit lover but these, without a doubt, the best I have ever had. They are both sweet and salty (with the honey and salt) and warm on the inside. I could have eaten these alone. But then they give you smoked cinnamon butter and pimento cheese spread on the side (you choose your mood, sweet or savory) and these make them that much better. I INSIST that you get these when you come.\\n\\nAHI TUNA TARTARE - We got this because my friend wanted something on the healthier side. It was good, not great, but the portion size was very generous. Tuna came on top of a deviled egg salad.\\n\\nOverall, I can't wait to come back to Buttermilk and Bourbon to try more things (like the beignets and the bread pudding), both because of the flavors and quality of the food and because of the portion sizes given the prices. I thought they were really reasonable.\\n\\nA couple things I didn't love:\\n- Even before we ordered, the waiter brought over the chef-owner's cookbook for us to buy. Asking us to do that was an odd request in my opinion at any time but before the meal was even odder. Wait until after we eat!\\n- They didn't have any milk alternatives (almond, soy etc.) which was not great for my friend who didn't want to drink cow's milk"},{"name":"Taco Cabana","address":"20445 Ih 35","city":"Kyle","stars":"1.5","text":"We love Taco Cabana, especially their breakfast tacos, but this location is in need of an intervention.

However, I remember the incredible service my waiter provided and the beautiful interior design. So I went back - something I never do if I was disappointed by the restaurant previously.\\n\\nOnce again, did I mention the ambiance?

David was our waiter for the night and he provided AMAZING service. Undoubtedly one of the best services I've gotten in a long time.\\n\\nThe only thing that's keeping me away from giving South City Kitchen five stars is the food. I warned you earlier: I'm not the typical southern gal. Perhaps I don't appreciate southern cooking, but I wasn't blown away by the dishes. I actually asked the chef to make my Catfish dish not too salty - an ultimate no-no in southern kitchen. Yeah, I know.  Chef probably got my order and thought, \\"WTF?\\" Nonetheless, he did it! I had a dish that wasn't too salty! I really appreciated that. We ordered a full, 4-course meal - from appetizer to dessert. Among all that, the She-Crab Soup, Mac & Cheese, and Banana Pudding were my favorites.\\n\\nI don't know southern cooking that well, but I think South City Kitchen successfully captured the essence of southern cooking.

I almost regret ordering it because I'm gonna be so bummed when I go back and it's not there.\\n\\nThe drinks: definitely some room for improvement. I ordered the red sangria and it was so sugary and watered down with ice, I couldn't finish it. I couldn't taste any red wine in my glass. I ordered a glass of the house red instead, which was okay. It tastes exactly how you would expect a $5 glass of red wine to taste, so I have no complaints.\\n\\nThe service: EXCELLENT. Our server was clearly busy but hauled ass the whole time, and was very polite, attentive, and sweet. She thanked us for our patience since she had a huge table to work at the same time (the same crowd who overflowed and stood next to us). She was wonderful.\\n\\nOh, also, they do have a bouncer who checks IDs at the door even if you're just there for food.

Everything (okay, almost everything) about this place is tacky and ugly. Concrete walls painted green and blue. Too much HOTD merchandise on display. Specials on dry-erase boards instead of chalkboards. Plastic menu covers, menu printed on green paper. Bar covered in thick drippy chipped polyurethane. Tables are the redeeming factor, thick slabs of wood, nothing fancy but real and substantial. Constant train noise, too loud to talk over, like every 20 or 30 minutes (no big deal, kinda funny and charming). In spite of all the flaws, it's not a gross place to hang out. It's got its own vibe that isn't entirely without charm, but really needs a bit of remodeling. Strangely, it actually looks kinda nice outside. Nothing fancy, but decent. Tip: sit at the bar facing north or west, and you'll have a nice view of downtown. \\nSERVICE:\\nShockingly good, or shockingly bad, or somewhere in between. Some servers clearly don't know much about beer. Some servers don't present themselves professionally. \\nFOOD: \\nBar snacks. Sometimes decent. Brussells sprouts are good, bread is good (Little T or Roman Candle). Some items are inedible. Even the soup varies wildly, from damn-good to \\"you've gotta be kidding me\\". \\nBEER:\\nMost products on tap are mediocre. The rotating \\"from the wood\\" (barrel aged) selection is where they shine. Or bottles. At their best, HOTD is virtually the best in Portland, certainly in the top 5. Most common complaint is inconsistent carbonation, batch variation, and serving temperature (draught is quite chilly, while cellared bottles are a bit warm). \\nPRESENTATION:\\nNice glassware, and food is presented well, for what it is. \\nPRICE/VALUE:\\nPrepare to be shocked. Sample checks for two, from my visits: $50 for just beer, $80 with food. There are some budget options, so don't be leery of walking in the door if you don't want to spend a lot, but to get the full HOTD treatment will require more money than any brewpub in Portland, including Cascade. Best value is a glass of the \\"from the wood\\" selection, which is $9 for 12oz. That's a lot, but less than you'd pay for a bottle of the same product.   \\nRESTROOMS: \\nno paper towels + door opens in = not acceptable\\nOVERALL: \\nIn spite of all the criticisms above, this place has a special place in my heart.

Its as good as it gets. Came here about a couple years back and the first time I came, we got here at about 7am and waited till about 12:30-1:00 pm before we got seated with our food.  This time, me and a buddy of mine got here at 9:00 am and got seated around 1:45 pm for food (The estimate time they give you during the wait in line is usually pretty darn accurate).  But they did a pre-order food check and by the time they got to us, they said beef ribs and turkey are the two things that are most likely out.... Fast forward 4 and a half hours later, both meats still in stock!! WOOHOOO.  I do recommend people waiting in line here for the Franklin's BBQ experience. There are limited portable chairs under the stairs if you get there early enough to get it, otherwise you can bring your own.  They start serving beer and stuff at about 9 or 10 AM? Lost track of time when they said it lol.  But definitely its a good experience to just talk to different people and whatnot.  Especially cool when both times I went, people that we've spoken to weren't even from Austin.  Definitely anything on the menu is the GOOD, like GOOD GOOD.  My favorite is definitely the beef ribs but I believe they only serve that on Saturday? Correct me if I am wrong, but that's what one of the servers told us when we went two years back.  The coffee truck is no longer there, but as of now they are in the process of having their own little coffee stand.

We were immediately greeted by a woman that gave us directions and helped direct us where to go.  It was very appreciated because I was pretty lost as to where to go and what to do. We both went with the #1 since it seems to be the most popular.  We both got it hot.  It turns out that the $1.50 extra per bowl paid for a side of sauce that you add to the bowl.  That's great because you get to make it as spicy as you want but it seemed like that should be included in the price.  Next time, we'll just order one and share it.

The sushi is top notch. Sam, the owner, always goes and gets the freshest fish he can find personally. (I am a tuna fan so I am always asking what he has for me. Cheeky I know. Hehe)\\n\\n2. The service is fast and friendly. Even when I order take out, it never takes longer than 15 minutes.

The place is newly renovated top to bottom and is very clean and cozy.\\n\\n4. The prices are very reasonable which is a plus for any good sushi place.\\n\\nMy suggestions, if you decide to check the place out:\\n\\n- Edamame (They have a big portion for 2 or 3)\\n- Crunchy Maki (My personal favorite)\\n- Spicy (or plain) Chu Toro Tuna (If available)\\n- Spicy tempura Maki (House Special about 12 pcs.)\\n- Louisiana Maki\\n- Spicy Yellow Tail\\n\\nHappy Eating!"},{"name":"Barrel & Boar Creekside","address":"121 Mill St","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4","text":"First time I've tried this place.

First of all the beef was braised perfectly. You could see the streaks of perfectly cooked beef with a pink center.  But the real star here was the Pear Kimchi and Candied Ginger Aioli. The sweetness and bite of those two combined with the savory beef juice created an unreal flavor combination that the soft taco shell absorbed so nicely. A perfect start to the meal. \\n\\nFor entrees my girlfriend got the Tilapia which she loved and I even tried (non-fish eater so I won't go into detail). I got the Friend Chicken and Waffles which I had been told by my friend were \\"the best I've ever had\\". Expectations were high...and they were EXCEEDED. First, the chicken was seasoned perfectly, a stunning crispy crunch with each bite while so moist and juice inside. The waffle was crisp on the outside while fluffy inside with a truly inspirational cinnamon honey butter that just sent my tastebuds into nirvana. The drizzle of Sriracha Bourbon sauce was a nice little final kick that kept you guessing.  Clean plate club: achieved. \\n\\nDespite my level of satisfaction everything was so good that I forced myself to have dessert. I got the sticky toffee bread pudding and my oh my what a treat. I'm not sure what bread was used but seemed like a challah or brioche as it held its form while absorbing the sauce.

There is a station that has water and traditional Italian condiments including the peppers to bite before you take a bite of the pizza.  They are spicy, oily and a little gummy in texture so you may not like them if that doesn't appeal to you but they do add a level of flavor to the pizza.\\n\\nI enjoyed the calzone the best in flavor, texture and cooking quality.

When you get there everyone is drinking and having a blast. While you sit and wait the bbq seeps deeply into your skin. Marinating you like a chicken during wing week. As the door opens at 12, the smell peels you apart like ribs that have been smoking for 24 hours. By the time you hit the door you are so hungry and so pumped that a morsel of cat poop would be like meat from the gods. You're getting closer and closer. You see yourself approaching the counter. Wonder hits your head. You've been prepared for this monumental moment your entire life yet you can't seem to remember what you want, where you are, or who you are. At this point you've been salivating for so long you feel dehydrated. The cotton feel in your mouth is quickly being replenished by the moisturizing smell of thinly sliced, smoking hot brisket. Your here. The line is over, the wait is done, your dreams are now reality. \\"What can I get you\\" asks brisket god Aaron Franklin himself. Following your instincts you order 5 lbs of brisket, 5 lbs of ribs, half a turkey, and some pulled pork. Aaron tosses you a piece of burnt end for the wait.

Got a call back 16 minutes later saying \\"don't touch the food my driver is coming to get it\\" and hung up. Called him back and asked him why he hung up on me \\"we're too busy here.\\" I tried to explain that we didn't have the full meal to pick up, he swore and sent his driver anyways. He then proceeded to call back multiple times yelling and swearing that he wanted the missing items because he refunded me through GrubHub for the full meal (didn't total more than 5 dollars) and was coming to get them. He then personally texted me 4 pictures of the returned food trying to prove it was cooked. He threatened to call the police multiple times and to get his lawyer involved, even after we offered to physically come down to the store and pay him the money for the missing items numerous times. Had he stayed on the initial phone call instead of hanging up and told us that he was refunding us/coming to get the food, none of this would have happened. He only stopped calling once I called the police! No food is worth such disgusting and disrespectful service. Never again will we or our friends order from him."},{"name":"Seasons & Regions Seafood Grill","address":"6660 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Been here twice already and they never disappoint.

For us, the ramen was hit or miss. We ordered the shoyu (ol skool) and the tonkotsu original. The shoyu ramen was actually really good--it had great flavor and wasn't overly salty or oily. The tonkotsu on the other hand was definitely not our favorite. To us, the broth had a seemingly bacon-y flavor that just wasn't all that appealing. \\n\\nOn the plus side I do think that they have really great toppings for their ramen, especially the chashu. Unlike most places where you get a thin, flimsy slice of pork, Tatsuya's chashu is a nice fat piece of pork with great flavor. \\n\\nPricing-wise it seem on par with most other ramen shops in the area.

Easily enough for two meals. Dogie bags are not uncommon here. We found the menu to be a little restrictive but always saw 1 or 2 items that we would be interested in eating.

Not really comfortable to eat a less than cheap meal with sweat continuing to form on your brow. Not sure if the air was broken, they don't have a/c, or it was just too hot outside for their system to handle the necessary capacity. \\n\\nThey have a nice size bar with ample seating if you are not able to get a table on a walk in or short notice.

We asked for her chicken parm and pasta to have \\"lite sauce.\\" They really didn't comply and when we asked them to replace the pasta we were told they needed to purchase more pasta if we wanted since it was homemade.

He told us this is how we should order it going forward.

Upon entering the restaurant, my guest and I noticed instantaneously that the A.C. unit was not functioning. Accordingly, with the temperature being over 90 degrees outside, the inside of the establishment was a bit uncomfortable. \\nWe ordered two different flavors of wings, a side of macaroni and cheese the half-pasta dish, two teas and an adult Hi-C. \\n\\nThe Macaroni and cheese: \\nThe noodles on this dish were overcooked. Usually when one makes a macaroni dish, it is advisable that noodles are under cooked as to not become al dente. This is because unlike pasta salad, most good macaroni and cheese undergoes two types of cooking: the pasta gets boiled, then once the sauce and a few more ingredients are added, it gets baked in a casserole dish. However, this macaroni was not only overcooked but it lacked any taste and therefore did not get eaten. \\n\\nThe half-pasta dish: \\nThis dish was al dente but this dish had very little flavor and based upon the taste of this dish, it seemed as of the sausages and the shrimp were thrown into the dish as an afterthought (specifically the shrimp and sausages lacked any  flavor complexity).  \\n\\nThe wings: \\nOf the two wing choices, one was better than the other. The breaded wings were definitely better than the sauced wings. \\n\\nThe staff here was friendly, but based upon food quality and a failing a.c. system, I would not return."},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"11B Allstate Rd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"2","text":"I've avoided this particular Olive Garden for an particularly long time because its known history of awful service and suspicious never-ordered items appearing on checks. \\n\\nI had not been to Olive Garden in over 3 years. A couple days ago my boyfriend and I decided to give it another chance and hoped that things had improved. It was a Friday night around 8:30 and the restaurant was full. There were at least 3 or 4 groups of people already waiting. We were told the wait would be 10-15 min and thankfully it was exactly that.\\n\\nWe were seated in the booth seats closest to the kitchen. We looked at our menu for only a minute before our server came and asked to start us off with drinks. We ordered a coke and peach-raspberry iced tea, and continued to look at the menu. 10 seconds later, I realized our server was still standing there. Awkward. I looked up at her and she said \\"Do you need a few minutes to decide what you want?\\" --- Yes. Yes, we would. What was the rush? We just sat down.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the Steak Gorgonzola Alfredo and I had the Chicken Scampi. As usual, there was bread sticks, soup and salad to start. The boyfriend had the minestrone soup and I had the salad. While the salad was fine, the soup was SALTY. The bread sticks were soft but the butter or oil with whatever seasoning that was on top was SALTY. Our entrees took some time to come out which we didn't mind too much because we had some food and it was busy. My Chicken Scampi was served to me on this HUGE plate. My dish didn't even cover 75% of the plate. However, taste-wise it turned out to be okay, nothing fantastic, the chicken was a bit on the salty side. My veggies were in strips that were half a foot long which I found strange, I suppose the cooks were getting lazy. My boyfriend didn't enjoy his Steak Gorgonzola too much. There were 4 pieces of steak and although he requested that his steak be cooked medium, the steak was cooked well-done, medium-well at best. Being the nice guy that he is, he decided not to send it back because 1) our server was running around and 2) he wanted to eat. \\n\\nConsidering everything that I ate had salt everywhere, it wasn't the most enjoyable dinner. Just think if you had at this restaurant on a regular basis, you'd probably have a heart attack early in life.  \\n\\nThe prices at Olive Garden are high for a chain restaurant and the quality of food that they serve. However, they do serve you a soup or a salad with bread sticks with every entree so I suppose that makes up the slightly higher prices. Service was better this time around but I probably won't return to Olive Garden anytime soon."},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"3663 Bee Caves Rd, Ste 4A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We really enjoy eating at Blue Dahlia in Westlake.

Did not complete my mission.  It shouldn't be difficult to order a drink on a Sunday afternoon in a dead bar.  But for some reason, the bartender at Christopher's couldn't handle life.\\n\\nThe place was basically dead, and the wifey and I chose to post up at the bar as per our M.O.  The bar kind of wraps around a wall and we sat at the end near the bathrooms, almost on the other side of the wall just barely in view of the bartender (only because a large party of 6 was wrapping up and leaving so we gave them some space).  The bartender did greet us when we sat down and gave us menus, so she definitely knew we were there.  She was basically dressed in workout clothes - yoga pants and a cotton tank - which should have indicated her level of commitment to her job right away.  \\n\\nWe had our drink choices selected in seconds, but unfortunately the bartender had wandered back to the other side of the bar and proceeded to ignore us while she made drinks and gabbed with her friends at the other end of the bar.  A number of EXCUSE ME's and hand waving didn't work at getting her attention.  9 minutes had passed since we sat down and were greeted, and I had to use the restroom really badly, so I told my wife to order my beer for me if the bartender came by.\\n\\nI got back to the bar and my wife miraculously had her \\"cocktail\\" in front of her (more about that later), but I had no beer.  I sat down and watched the bartender continue to ignore us, still gabbing and making drinks for her friends at the other end of the bar.  Another 5 minutes had passed, for a total of 15 minutes in Christopher's with 0 service - so I literally got out of my seat, walked to the other end of the bar, stood behind her friends, jumped up and down waving my hands.  The bartender then acknowledged my presence - another miracle - and said \\"Oh, you wanted the Peak Organic, right?\\"  No, I don't want a beer from you anymore.  I want you to come over to our end of the bar.\\n\\nMy wife had ordered a mimosa and got a flute filled with oj and a splash of sparkling wine.  It was opaque orange and no indication of effervescence.  I don't understand a bartender that makes a shitty mimosa.  A toddler could make a proper mimosa.  \\"Oops, sorry mommy, I spilled some of my oj into your champagne!\\"  So I showed the bartender her ridiculous excuse for a drink, and she had the gonads to argue with me!  \\"I DEFINITELY put champagne in that!\\"  Oh really?  Where do you see champagne in that glass?  If there were champagne, would I be able to do this?  \\n\\nI then took down the whole glass of oj in one big gulp, threw $3 down on the bar for the glass of oj, and left for Tavern in the Square across the street, which had a more upbeat atmosphere with people watching the Sox game and talking, where the bartender made proper drinks and gave us great service, and where we proceeded to spend the next 2 hours and $60."},{"name":"Tasty Burger","address":"1301 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Just went here for a little hang over cute and by golley it did just that, right in the middle of down town Boston this place is a find, grabbed some onion rings and the tasty burger and I was blown away, cured hangover , delicious foodgreat atmospherethis place has everything you need and more..."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

To my surprise, other than the extremely slow service.... everything else went well and the food was delicious! \\n\\nWe waited for a really long time to get seated... but I saw many open seats around - not sure why. It also took a really long time for us to get our food. So I was starving and, um, probably a little impatient. :)\\n\\nWe tried the normal ribeye $19.99 (4/5) in medium rare. Right, I won't be expecting the same meat quality as if we had gone to a fine dining steakhouse. But their ribeye for this pricing, meat quality was good - tasted fresh, tender, and cooked just about right. We also tried the Hickory Bourbon Salmon $17.99 (5/5) Very very yummy, I would totally recommend. It was not too saucy and the salmon was also fresh and nicely prepared. On top of these, I was also impressed with their sides. Steamed broccoli came with a light buttery flavor. Dirty rice was delicious. I loved the grilled zucchini and the seasoning. The asparagus was equally amazing. I honestly left with a satisfied stomach and some of you probably know that I am rather picky with food. \\n\\nService-wise, a lot of room for them to improve.

Our group walked in on a whim, and it wasn't too busy so we were seated without a reservation. Our server was fantastic! I don't know his name, but he was efficient, helpful, and attentive while giving us plenty of privacy and space to talk. The food exceeded expectations. We had the breakfast tacos, omelet (which comes with potatoes and a warm tortilla), and huevos rancheros, all of which were perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. The only minor issue was that the bench seating wasn't particularly comfortable, but that could be a personal preference as well. If Yelp provided half stars, I would give this a 4.5 rating."},{"name":"Buttermilk & Bourbon","address":"160 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"An unbelievable amazing experience on numerous levels. I don't even know where to begin! Here goes:\\n\\nRegarding food: everything was so amazingly fresh, the only way it could have been fresher is if my table was closer to, or in the kitchen! I'd ordered the Tuna Tartare and Boneless Tenders, with the Beignets for dessert. \\n\\nThe Tuna Tartare was great! The Tuna was allowed to shine on it's own, with just a little help from it's friends: lime juice and muffaletta relish. Herbs were a nice touch too! Also, at first bite it seemed like they went a little overboard on the lime, but that passed quickly, perhaps it was a little drizzle that hadn't even had a chance to fully sink in yet. The crackers it came with were great as well! They were just study enough to hold the tuna without the crunch of a pita chip. As such, it didn't create a competing texture or flavor.  \\n\\nRegarding the deviled egg salad: while it was perfectly fine taste-wise, I did feel that it was as little unnecessary in the dish. Then again, I am a bit of a purist when it comes to tartares. My advice: have the egg salad on the side as opposed to at the base of the tuna. This would allow people to taste (and mix it, if they dare) at will, no longer having to get through all the tuna. \\n\\nThen there were the chicken tenders (boneless fried thighs, if you want to get technical)... I'm surprised I've not been dreaming about these things. I opted for the \\"Nashville Hot\\" variety (this is a dry rub) and had some White BBQ sauce (served on the side). While I would have liked to be able to try one hot and one not (because I mix and match everything but my socks), this was not possible. Anyways, regardless of whether they were mixed or matched, the chicken knocked my socks off. Sometimes simplicity is best, this was simple, yet divinely elevated! \\n\\nFirst, the chicken itself was breaded and cooked perfectly. It was fresh as can be, and the meat was moist and incredibly tender, especially for something boneless! It had just the right amount of breading which added a wonderful level crispness without being akin to a \\"Jacked\\" Doritos chip. Likewise, the ratio of bread to chicken was just right, and the salt level was on-point. \\n\\nThe Nashville Hot dry rub was great! It brought just enough heat for flavor, without having me chugging down a cask of water. It paired even better with the white BBQ sauce, which I lack the words to describe, other than savory! It added whole new dimension without taking away flavor from either the chicken or the rub on it. I want to say it has a ranch base, but if I'm right, comparing each to this sauce would be like comparing a Model T Ford to a Lamborghini Aventador... they're just on different planes altogether! \\n\\nI wish I could try the biscuits, but a plate of four would have been too much, and I didn't feel like taking a doggy-bag.\\n\\nBecause there's always room for dessert (no, seriously, look up the science) I went for some Beignets. Amazing as well! They had just the gentlest crust imaginable, and a soft, airy, amd gooey (in a good way). Like fried dough elevated by ten stories, also, not at all greasy or oily! I opted for the chocolate as well, which was great and balanced in terms of sweet and bitter. The beignets can hold their own just fine without. I'm just not one to say \\"no\\" to chocolate.\\n\\nThen there's the drinks: I started with a Whodi Smash, and had the Mango No. 5 for my second.  \\n\\nWhodi Smash was extremely well balanced in all respects. It was just in the middle of sweet and sour, and similarly in the middle of being spirit forward, and spirit hidden, or whatever the opposite of spirit forward is. Just really well rounded and not overdone. \\n\\nMango No. 5 brough the heat! I was curious about black-pepper infused Vodka, and I was impressed with what I tasted. Like the Whodi Smash, it was very well balanced, only with the added dimension of having aforementioned heat, which wasn't over the top. \\n\\nValue is incredible! When I hear \\"tapas\\" I usually think of too much money for a amount of food half the size of my fist. Here though, you get a much enough food that two plates was enough to fill me up, and I can eat! Considering the amount and quality of experience, I had no problem splurging a little. \\n\\nThe service was awesome! My server, Sarah, was very nice and extremely knowledgeable in the restaurant's offerings. It was clear she wanted me (and other guests) to have a great experience. She and the waitstaff were extremely friendly and attentive. Food also came out wicked fast!\\n\\nThe vibe in here is cool, with the different rooms having different themes!"},{"name":"Ramen Tatsu-Ya","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 126","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Not too impressed \\n\\nI appreciate small menus because it usually means that restaurant specializes in something and is pretty good at it.

But I was most disappointed about the broth. Usually I eat my ramen with a spoon full or broth, but this was just too oily and greasy. On top of that, there wasn't too much flavoring over that either. Maybe it was just that batch? \\n\\nRecommendations: \\n+ Get one spicy bomb and share it with your group.

We love the small, welcoming space, the friendly, easygoing staff and, most importantly, the delicious homemade food. If I were Italian I'd probably compare it to my Nonna's kitchen, but alas I am not. \\n\\nDespite what you may think about an unassuming Italian restaurant in Medford, make a reservation. Doesn't matter what night of the week it is, it will be incredibly difficult if not impossible to get a table without one. Also keep in mind they are closed on Sundays AND Mondays. \\n\\nNow back to that delicious food. As many others have noted, there isn't a menu here. Your server will run through the list of available pastas, sauces, proteins, veggies, appetizers and specials. The possibilities are endless! This can feel a bit overwhelming for me so I usually come in already having an idea of what I'll get, or I'll simply ask the server for a recommendation. Typically 1 out of the 5-10 types of pastas is made in-house so that's almost always what I choose. Most recently I got the seafood fra diavlo over housemade fusilli. It was fantastic and the portion was huge! The two of us also shared two appetizers because we couldn't settle on just one - arancini and clams casino. Both great. There's also complimentary bread. Needless to say, we had way too much food but it didn't stop us from joining the clean plate club - what can I say, when the food is that good how are you expected to put your fork down?!\\n\\nGive Nappi's a visit, you'll definitely come back for more.

The meat portion size was okay and I guess within normal range of most BBQ restaurants. The restaurant itself was nice, spacious with tables & booths and a couple of TVs! \\n\\nUnfortunately the food was awfully bland! The turkey and brisket had no flavor to it and the same can be said of the  potato salad and pinto beans! I was excited to try this place out, but was let down by the taste of the food. It's almost like it was not seasoned at all. Maybe I went on a day where the prep cook forgot to season the food! Also the bar with the pickles and onions had nets flying around it which was interesting as the place was pretty clean. The AC was running and the fans were on which probably attributed to my food getting cold fast, \\n\\nI placed a picture of the food so you can see how good it looks; looks can be deceiving! As far as the price I paid the meal was almost $17 for for the 2 meat plate and a drink which sounds about right for what I got.

Kimchi on a burger for me is never something I imagined until today. My only request, more kimchi (it's that good).

Maybe it was tasty, to people who enjoy eating live cows, but for those of us who prefer cooked meat, it was not ideal.  \\n\\nThe restaurant advertises that they cook the burgers \\"medium\\" and that if you want it cooked more, you need to ask.  I assumed that \\"medium\\" actually meant \\"cooked\\", so I did not specify.  For example, at UBurger (which is better), they advertise the same thing, but their burgers are COOKED.  I ate here with a group of friends, and everyone's burger was under-cooked (i.e. pink/purple colored).  Stupidly, we all ate our burgers and we are all now concerned that we will be sick by tomorrow.  Let's hope we are wrong.  Two of my friends requested that the burgers be cooked more when they ordered.  One of them got what she asked for, the other got a pink burger.  \\n\\nThe \\"hand cut\\" fries are decent, but I would not call them great.  They were very greasy (as were the onion rings).

Mostly wine, hence being an Italian Restaurant.  We sat at the end of the bar near the front door.\\n\\nDecor was simple, with many tables set up in a classic European setup. (As many table as you can cram into one area.) Makes it awkward for someone to walk through without bumping someone sitting.\\n\\nOne turn off right away were the stacks of pizza boxes on the back wall. Made it feel like a sub shop. Simple cloth material partition to hide that would be more appropriate.  So that takes away from the atmosphere.  There is definitely room for improvement.\\nBathrooms were dimly lit, and not clean.  Men's room sink was falling off the wall.  \\nAnd a light switch right next to the sink at sink level.  \\nCan you say code violation.

They are not home made, these appear to be restaurant service packed. breading and filling ate too consistent. But tasty never the less.  Definitely order them.\\n\\nWe both split the Chicken Marsala. Marsala sauce was very good. Good flavor and not at all starchy, as most places.  Chicken was tender and moist. Cooked perfectly. But for the price, I would have expected fresh mushrooms, not pre-sliced or canned. a bit spongy in texture.\\nAnd the Fusilli were outstanding. \\n\\nWe had dessert as well. Tiramisu was interesting.  Server in a glass desert cup.  Not the correct presentation for this Italian staple.  Tends to dry out the top layer, making the surface tough.

You have probably heard plenty of stories of Franklin's Barbecue.  As a long time Austin resident, I made the trek to Franklin's and here is my timeline of events.  \\n\\nSunday, Feb 2014 day\\nArrive at 7:25am, got 20th spot in line \\n7:45am, prob a solid 60 people in line\\n8:20am, now about 100+ people waiting in line.  \\nMajority of people bring camping folding chairs.  Some people bring coolers.  Its a mild foggy Feb day as people patiently wait till 11am when the store opens.  \\n9:00am, 2 Franklin employees walk down the line with a clipboard asking how much meat you plan to buy.  There is only so much meat in the smoker, so they try to get to the count to someone in back of the line.  Anyone waiting pass that person will likely strike out with no food.  \\n10:45am, people start putting their chairs up, and you see a few parties in line have friends join them who just recently get there.  Few line cutters sure, but the meat order list already came in around 9\\n11:00am, doors open, people start to file in.  \\n11:20am, from my 20th spot, now ordering time\\n\\nI order a split of fatty and lean brisket with also a single pork rib. Interesting that no beef rib is served here.  My friend grabs the brisket plate which comes with two sides. They hand you the customary starter brisket bite to get your senses going.  \\n\\nThe brisket is tender, smoked ring flavored meat, and a 18hr charred bark.  It has that deep long cooked smoked flavor that is the institution of this restaurant.  I tasted more smoke flavor than salt/pepper flavor in this brisket meat. I think I prefer the more high peppery brisket at other spots.  The pork rib I thought was amazing.  It was so well cooked, it easily fell off the bone.  Pork rib is very juicy, peppered, and quite tender rib meat.  I also really enjoyed the BBQ sauce they had available.  It was very little sugar flavor in it with a bit of spice seasoning.  They offer beans, coleslaw, and potato salad, but why waste space with getting sides?. They also offer serve pies such as Banana pudding, Key Lime, or Pecan (if you are still hungry).  Plenty of table seating indoors and outdoors.  \\n\\nI will close out my review by giving the most important statement: This was NOT the best brisket I have ever had!  LA BBQ I feel deserves best brisket award.  Also was missing out on the beef rib.  Trust me, I dont think Franklin will be hurting in business because I said their brisket is 2nd place.  I tried bbq all around Austin and much of central TX.  There is some amazing pit masters in this area.  Franklin's BBQ is at the head of their craft.  The story of a small tiny trailer of 4 people, making brisket in 2008 or so, and has now boomed to a mecca for BBQ enthusiasts.  A surreal story for sure. This is perfection in BBQ pitmaster cooking.  \\n\\nFor the tourists that visit the Austin, TX area, there is amazing BBQ in this city.  If you feel adventurous and will wait in 3hr+ line, go to Franklin's.  Lines not as bad during the week also.  You will get to experience an amazing take on barbecue.

It was burnt to the sides of the container and kind of greasy. I ended up taking it home but throwing it out later. \\n\\nAnother thing that's pretty disappointing is their drinks. Now, I know not to order cocktails from places like this because it's more mixer and juice then actual liquor. There are less than a handful full of chain restaurant/family establishments I'd order drinks with liquor in it from. They hike up the prices and give you diabetes in a cup. Though, I thought this time I'd try a sangria, I mean, it's wine, didn't think you could get too stingy on that. Clearly I was wrong. It was peach sangria and kid you not, they had threw some of those gross canned peaches in that drink and tried to call it a sangria. Lol. It was so sugary. It was pretty gross! \\n\\nThe only reason we went was because of the Veterans Day meal they do, my husband likes to eat there on that day. Other than that, I wouldn't step foot back into an Applebee's. They put a bad taste in my mouth a couple years ago when we were 15 minutes early for happy hour and ordered a ton of appetizers (they're half off on HH) and the waitress didn't even mention it to us. Like she could of said, \\"hey I can take your drink orders if you guys want to wait about 10-15 minutes it will be happy hour\\". No normal person orders over $60 in appetizers. She knew we thought it was happy hour. \\n\\nI was annoyed after that incident.

Now indulgence may be par for the course in Portland (home to bacon fest and Pine State), but Screen Door also represents something much more significant: regional food done right. Many chefs in Portland can do French/Northwest/New American style food quite well here, but when it comes to replicating specialty foods from other American regions, it always seems to be done wrong. Not here. Screen Door does southern food right. In fact, between Pine State and Screen Door, I haven't had much in the way of legit southern fare in PDX, and I lament it. \\n\\nI have been going to SD for breakfast on and off for years. The only thing that keeps me away is the line - which is horrendously long. Were it open for brunch on weekdays I would likely hit it more often (and I'd be 100lb heavier), but alas, I value my hours (and my not-yet-critical cholesterol levels) enough to avoid the waits here most weekends. The stand-outs on the breakfast menu range from Eggs Sardou (benedict with spinach and an artichoke heart in place of ham), breakfast corn dogs, bananas foster french toast, a mile-high stack of chicken and waffles, various delicious hashes, grits and praline bacon (aka meat candy). There's no question that one breakfast here has enough calories for a full day's worth of strenuous activity. Oh, and everything tastes even better than you're imagining while reading this review. \\n\\nI finally ventured in for dinner the other night, and found it to be... well... like breakfast, but dark out. The line was ridiculously long, with waits ranging beyond an hour. The menu is as enticing if not moreso than the breakfast menu, with brisket, fried chicken, shrimp & grits and similar offerings ranging from $10-$19 (for the special NY steak). They also have a whole selection of special local organic sides each week, and a \\"Screen Door Plate\\" entree which just lets you select 3 from the long list of amazing sides (mac n cheese, blackened catfish, greens, etc) or the organics list. My wife usually has to ask for special accommodation to get a plate full of sides (she likes to sample) and she was in heaven with this option. My fish (with melted leeks and braised spinach over potatoes and red pepper sauce) was divine. The side of broccoli, potato and smoked cheddar gratin reminded me that magic (and possibly unicorns) still exist in the word. And the Mac n Cheese? Baked and divine. \\n\\nThe only real misses at Screen Door are the cocktails. While creative, they're not executed well. But honestly, the quality of the food could light up any shadow cast by this miss. \\n\\nAs to the service, SD runs like an incredibly well oiled machine. The abuse that these folks must endure from hungry patrons waiting for extended periods of time (especially for brunch) does not show in their demeanor. At all. I've never had anything but smiling, friendly, efficient service here. Once when they accidentally skipped us on the list the host made sure an order of hush-puppies (perfectly done, at that) was waiting at our table once we were up for a sit. \\n\\nThese folks truly do run a 5-star operation here, and the fact that they can process the masses that come here without hiccups in food quality (never had a bad meal) or service (never had bad service) is honestly astounding to me.

They really need to redecorate or at least reupholster the seats. From our table we could see a booth seat ripped and torn. There was a whole wall covered in scuff marks from the chairs from the bottom to the top of the wall and all the top of the chairs were scuffed up as well. The meal was just alright. The whole baby octopus appetizer was interesting. I ordered the spicy volcano roll and it did not live up to its name. It was supposed to have crawfish and lobster but it was only made with krab and fake crab at that. It wasn't spicy at all and they put so much tobiko on it that it was like they were trying to hide something with the taste of tobiko. What saved our meal was that my fianc√© loved his roll lobster crunch roll because it had actual lobster and eel. The service was atrocious.

When he was at his other table, he didn't even glance in our direction. My fianc√© had to stand up and wave his arm to finally get the server's attention to bring us our check. It became such a joke that we made a bet about whether or not he would ask us how our meal was. Need less to say I lost that bet because he dropped off the check without a word and walked away. The poor manager looked like the only one that was working. She bussed an entire table for a party of 8 while two other servers stood nearby \\"adjusting\\" their apron and playing with their hair. She then proceeded to sit down and fold napkins while our server sat in front of her on his cell phone! On his phone! Instead of checking on us or any of his other tables in the restaurant. I felt bad for the manager."},{"name":"No Mas!

The food here is really good. There are plenty of seats to choose from, both inside and outside the cafe. The lines may seem pretty long but they quickly take each order and suprisingly, the food comes out in a nice timely manner and served fresh and hot. \\n\\nWhat to order here: \\nI highly recommend their 1/2 Rotisserie Chicken, their chicken is a slow-roasted rotisserie chicken served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Each bite is full of flavor, so incredibly juicy. Their chicken nuggets and fries are really good here too, my nephew devoured every bite. They have really good salads as well and each bite is nice and crisp from all their fresh veggies. \\n\\nSo if you're looking for a good spot to get a quick, delicious bite to eat, then definitely eat at Cosmic Ray's. The food is solid and will satisfy all your needs.

I thought for $12 I would get fry's with it but they are extra. My son ordered soup and a burger, the burger had to go back to get cook as did mine. The third time he sent it back he told them to keep it. His soup was cold, not from waiting to eat it, it came that way but he was so hungry he ate it cold.

This place is cute and situated just across the water near the I-5 interchange.  I don't mind going for a walk in this area of Portland having relocated from the Midwest and having been here in the area for a few years now.  This coffee shop fits in very well with the adjacent businesses and is an area of Portland that it often featured in Portland Monthly. \\n\\nThere were a few people there when I arrived.  The atmosphere was really laid back yet a bit on the business casual side.  If you're a local think parts of the Pearl district without being overly pretentious.  The customer base seemed very laid back still a bit on the business casual side.  \\n\\nI was greeted by the front counter guy that was nice and represented Portland very well as artsy and creative.  When I began to place my order I noticed you get to choose between a drip coffee, pour over, or type of espresso to go with one of the drinks.  Their expresso offerings are on rotation.\\n\\nToday I went with the Columbia Monteblanco by cirque as a base to my mocha with oat milk.  This coffee shop is completely vegan so the milk options are non diary.  I got an onion bagel with tofutti (vegan) and a chai pumpkin slice (vegan). Both were really good as well as the drink.  \\n\\nI got a carry out this morning but would go here on a date, meet up, to do work, or even relax.  The atmosphere is a bit on the business casual side so again if you don't like areas like the Pearl district you may not feel as great about the coffee shop and area.  \\n\\nSince this business focuses on specialty coffee it wasn't a big deal that I recently now have a bagel expectation of add ons like lettuce tomato and seasoning.

We waited about 30 minutes to sit down on a Friday morning. We sat in the covered outside seating near the road. We started off with the Bloody Mary's, Praline Bacon, and the Sausage Gumbo.\\n\\nBLOODY MARY - Great Flavor! It did not come very spicy so you might have to ask for a little extra kick! Or just pour down of their habanero sauce and mix that in. You get Okra, Lemon, and an olive. The best part was the flavored salt mixture they coated around the ring of the glass. Very tasty. \\n\\nPRALINE BACON - The bacon was a little too sweet for me. There was too much praline and maple sugar to truly enjoy the savory nature of the bacon. It comes with three prices of bacon but this was a dish I would have been okay having one bite of. \\n\\nSAUSAGE GUMBO - Well done. A scrumptious little cup of gumbo topped with white rice. It was a percent little starter to the rest of my meal.\\n\\nThen we moved into the main courses. I had the screen door chicken basket. I have heard amazing things about their chicken and waffles but I don't personally like chicken and waffles (I know, don't shoot me!) Honestly the chicken and waffles looks phenomenal and one of the girls we came with was blown away. \\n\\nCHICKEN BASKET - There was the option of wings, drumsticks, or fried chicken strips. The waitress recommended the drumsticks but I was having wings later that day and decided to go with the fried chicken strips instead. I am glad I decided to try the chicken they are known for. It was superb! The fried breading around the chicken was light and flaky and the chicken melted in my mouth. It came with a buttermilk ranch (that was a little dill heavy), crystal hot sauce (goes great mixed with the ranch), and a homemade habanero sauce to add a little kick if you like it spicy. \\n\\nShrimp Po Boy - My girlfriend got this and boy were we surprised! The portion was huge! We were so excited to eat that we forgot to take pictures at the beginning g of the meal. The pictures shown are our meals half eaten. She loved the Po' boy! There was so much shrimp and dressings in the sandwich she needed more sauce so we poured the ranch and crystal sauce on it... great decision. \\n\\nOverall an amazing experience \\n\\nCONS - I think this place could be getting a 5 star rating based off of dishes alone but there were a few things that threw me off. \\n\\n1. The French fries! All of the dishes looked amazing and did not disappoint... but the French fries were elementary at best. They did not have a lot of flavor and were a little soggy. They honestly reminded me of some fast food style French fry. Their only redeeming quality was the ketchup.\\n\\n2. The bacon seemed like it was more sugar and praline than it was bacon.

Tried ordering a burger, they said they can't serve it around breakfast time, so then tried ordering a sandwich, also a no-go... Annoyed, I asked for whatever had the most meat and the waitress recommended an American (or something) omelet that's served with steak.  Not a fan of omelets but better than nothing.  Omelet comes and there's ZERO meat in it...  Confused, I asked the waitress \\"where's the meat?\\" and it turns out the guy that made it just started working there today (according to him) and messed it up.  So now I have to wait there and get my food when the rest of my party is almost done with theirs and rush the meal, which is never fun.\\n\\nThe messed up order and lack of options isn't what really pissed me off though.  When the right order finally came, there was still barely any meat there (I expected something bursting in the seams with steak), which was probably for the best because whatever pieces I was able to fish out had absolutely no flavor... none.  That steak's never even been in the same zip code as marinade.  The omelet itself?  Yep, you guessed, zero.0 flavor, no salt, garlic powder, nothing.  Home fries?  A tiny bit of flavor, but not nearly enough and they were nice and mushy to boot.  At least the vegetables inside the omelet were perfectly seasoned... err, no, no they were not.  I had to order a side of bacon and bbq sauce to be able to eat that tasteless pile of crap.\\n\\nIn the end, this was one of the most disappointing meals I've ever had, especially since I had high expectations.  There're few things more frustrating than investing time/effort in going out to eat and ending up with a belly full of flavorless, hastily put together chicken feed.  I can't imagine anyone enjoying those omelets without drenching it sauce/dressing.

The BBQ tofu was okay (mine is better at home).  The pasta in the Mac and cheeze was way overcooked and mushy.  \\nWhen there are so many other veg friendly restaurants in PDX, I can't see myself going back."},{"name":"No Mas!

We saw this spot on our drive in so we had to try it. We found parking with no problem! Also, this place is a pretty big restaurant! They have outside seating on a grassy area, patio seating, bar seating, up stairs and downstairs seating. With that said we had no problems getting a table. We sat inside downstairs. We received chips and dipping salsas for each individual person (I have never seen this done before unless asked and I liked it). I ordered the cucumber Margarita but didn't read the whole description and later discovered it was a spicy margarita. It was muddled very well and tasted good but it was too spicy for me. I asked our waitress if the bartender could remove the spices and just have the cucumbers. The pre made mix they use for the cucumber margarita already is already spicy, so they couldn't remove all the spices but removing the added spices brought down the spicy factory a noche! For a meal I ordered the chicken quesadilla which I really enjoyed! My cousin got a large bowl of queso and meat which was delicious as well!

We chose the romesco sauce, which is an almond red pepper sauce.  Our chicken was juicy and flavorful, and went well with the creamy romesco sauce.  I would say a quarter chicken is good for one person if you're not eating anything else, but was great for sharing since we were trying other food items in the market. \\n\\nPollo Bravo is known for their chicken, so that's what to get here.

Personally I am a giant fan of their brownies, as not only are they gluten-free and vegan, but they also are free of bean flour/sorghum (which although gluten-free, I find a lot harder to digest than white rice flour which BBB uses). BBB always lists all their ingredients on the labels of their products, which is handy.

She states that this chef's restaurant has the best Chinese food outside of China.  How could we miss out on the opportunity to try such highly praised food?\\n\\nThe location is somewhat new and in a nondescript part of Richmond.  We weren't hungry and the restaurant looked empty save for about two tables of people, so we drove elsewhere first and then returned.  The place was pretty crowded, though there were still empty tables.  The hostess, who has very limited English skills and required the help of the waiter/host, told us that they were booked for the night as well as the next day.  Since we noticed they serve lunch until 5, we made a reservation for lunch.  We were disappointed bc the dinner set menu is what we had really wanted to try, as it is discounted heavily - half off plus another 25%!  Please note that you will need to bring cash as there is a 10% additional charge for credit/debit cards.\\n\\nThe next day, we arrived late for our lunch.  I asked the waiter if it was too late, but he said it wasn't and seated us promptly.  To our surprise, he handed us a dinner menu.  Yay - we managed to try dinner there after all.  They have three set menus to choose from; the first was ruled out bc it's for a minimum of four people.  We decided on the more expensive of the latter two.  We found out later that if you come early enough, sometimes they will allow you to order one of each set menu (rather than everyone having to order the same).  The table next to us was able to do this, though it was too late for us.  \\n\\n-Black Chicken Bouillon Soup - This was a clear soup w/ bits of berkshire pork, Japanese sea cucumber, and cabbage.\\n-Beef Carpaccio - This came in a glass cup with citrus foam, peeled grapes, some bib lettuce, longan, and aoli - it looked like a fancy salad.  Good flavor and nice presentation.\\n-Shrimp Salad - My friend chose this instead of the Beef.  It was very similar except it came with five sweet shrimp and a mango dressing.\\n-Curry Abalone Shell w/ Stuffing - The dish came with a blaze of fire and once the fire was out, they took it back and brought it back out on a different plate.  I noticed that when it got busy, they simply brought out the abalone minus the fire.  Anyways, this was really good - the curry was a little spicy but the stuffing had abalone, prawns, scallops and crab.\\n-Lobster w/ Egg Whites and Truffle Oil - The lobster (1.5 pounds) was fresh and basically killed just before making this dish.  The egg whites were extremely fluffy (what is the secret??) and everything was drizzled in a yummy truffle oil.  \\n-Abalone with an Organic Cauliflower Citrus Vinaigrette - I didn't eat much of this bc I don't like abalone straight up.  It was pretty tender, though.\\n-Zen Pizza - This was actually really good.  It had pieces of proscuitto, fig jam, and gruyere cheese on house made dough.  It had a nice sweet flavor that paired well with the proscuitto, which was surprisingly not salty.\\n-Tahitian vanilla Bean Panna Cotta with Berry Compote - This was also good, but then again, panna cotta is very easy to make at home (and cheap).\\n\\nI have to say that the food was not necessarily Chinese (unless you call pizza Chinese) but most everything was delicious.  I usually stay far away from abalone and lobster, but for the most part, I enjoyed the way the food was prepared.  \\n\\nI can see why people would complain about service bc after a few hours, the place was packed with only the male waiter and female hostess running around.  We didn't find the waiter rude - he described all our dishes to us and was pleasant.  Of course we did notice he spent more time w/ us at the beginning when there were only two-three tables, but as it got busier, so did he, which was understandable.  We did have to wait a long time for our bill after our almost 3-hour meal, but the two were running around the place.  I'd definitely recommend the food, but make reservations!

At first, I wasn't so sure I wanted to come here, because of the way it looks and all.. but it was worth every dollar I spent here!\\n\\nWhat we ordered:\\n\\nBeef Short Rib - $38/9-inch, bone in beef rib with our salt and pepper rub \\nCombo Plate Fried Okra - $18\\nSweet Tea - $1.95\\nCole Slaw - $5\\n\\nThe short rib just fell off the bone and it tasted so delicious with or without the barbecue sauce! So I've tried both sauces.. the spicy and regular.. I liked both but enjoyed the regular one more than the spicy one! It also came with either sliced beef brisket. We got it sliced. So all the combos and plates come with white bread with 2 sides (of your choice). For my sides I had collard greens and chili mac. Chili mac tasted ok and I don't think I'll get it, again.. but the collard greens I enjoyed very much!\\n\\nThe combo plate fried okra tasted alright, because I'm not a fan of okra much.. my siblings loved it! I forgot which sides they ordered for that meal.\\n\\nThe sweet tea tasted really refreshing and sweet (of course.. it's sweet tea)!!! And the cole slaw was just alright..

My wife and I are from the Bay Area and we really enjoy visiting PDX for the all the yummy places to eat and drink.  PDX is a good spot to do marathon eating and drinking for a couple days!  Screen Door is always a MUST when we are in town.  Aside from the long lines and the possible extended time to find parking this place really is a gem.  We have learned to come early to beat the dinner rush so our last visit was perfect, very little wait time.  Like most people, I am less than impatient when it comes to waiting at restaurants but if you have to wait for a bit, they have a little bar area where you can grab a fancy or simple drink.  My wife ordered a Whiskey Flight on our last visit, and I'd have to say that may have been the moment that converted her into Whiskey lover lol \\n\\nEvery time we have went to Screen Door is has been for dinner.  The restaurant is very quaint a little bigger than you would think just by looking at it from the outside.  It can feel like a bit of a rush hour because the servers are really moving making sure to turn tables quickly.  While we were waiting to be seated I remember just watching everyone working it was like a well-oiled machine.  The service has always been good, attentive, friendly, non-intrusive for the most part.  I am that weirdo that needs my personal space when I'm eating so it does feel a little cramped but it is also understandable because of the never-ending line of patrons (for Screen Door, I suck it up lol)  On to the food!\\n\\nOn our last visit we ordered:\\n-Chicken tenders - Very moist and highly recommended.\\n-Ribeye with greens & cheesy potato - Cooked perfectly and sides really complimented it.\\n-Hazelnut custard pie - Rich and decadent! \\n\\nI feel like they have a rotating menu which can be good and bad because if you come into town they may not have your favorite dish but it is also an opportunity to try something new.  I felt the portion of food was equivalent to the price which is always nice.  The worst feeling is when the plate gets set down in front of you and you're like \\"That's it!?\\" lol  I haven't felt that here.

You can't beat the price ($1.95-$4.95) or the generous portions of food you get! Four of us ordered a pint of beer each and:\\n\\n1.

Two side-mac n' cheese and onion rings porfavor. So I was happy while waiting. It smelled awesome in there, new digs all around me. Me likes. Food comes out looking pretty awesome. The brisket is chopped into huge meaty (or so I thought) chunks. Mac N' Cheese is actually shells n' cheese. And the onion rings are huge, the way I like em'.\\n\\nSo here's what it boils down to. The brisket was so fatty. Too fatty. Heart attack fatty. It was really well prepared too, so that was my first disappointment. The mac n' cheese was actually really good, but not out of this world. Lastly, the onion rings. The first few were awesome but as I got to the bottom of the stack, I noticed they were getting greasier and soggier. Sure enough, there was a huge reservoir of oil at the base of the stack. I mean enough that you could easily take a spoon and scoop up 3-4 spoon fulls.

He died because of it.\\n\\nIn the blog post mentioned above this woman talks of her rights , what she deserves in regard to 'service', and how meanly she was treated because of the incident.

I tried multiple times to post what really happened since she was 'in the bathroom at the time', however my posts are deleted.\\n\\nI feel sorry for her dog, her children, and anyone else that has to deal with her entitlement issues.  I feel sorry that she sees her self as 'not  cool ' like the employees at Ristretto on 42nd.  \\n\\nI would like to thank those who work at the dog friendly coffee shop, and protect the majority of us by banning dogs with aggression issues.  It makes my morning to have a quick chat with the friendly baristas.    I am hoping this can be posted somewhere where they and others can read about what actually happened that morning.  Because I love dogs, I hope the lady will work with her pet and keep him out of situations that set this dog up to fail, for it is not the worlds responsibility to manage other people's pets.\\nMelynda Jackson\\nMelynda.666@gmail.com"},{"name":"Madhouse Sports Bar & Grill","address":"5280 Old National Hwy","city":"College Park","stars":"3.5","text":"Went for the NBA finals.

However, after this show I was a bit underwhelmed as an adult audience member. The theatre portion of the experience may just be overdone. There's a pre-show that was quite lengthy and the actual show that made me feel a little bored.My favorite part of the whole experience was the lobby area equipped with the bar and the selection of  hors d'oeuvres that were served by the waiters before being seated for the show and dinner. The reason I gave this experience 4 stars is because the food was delicious!!!! Other dinner shows have great theatrics but poor food quality in terms of taste and flavor. The best part of the main show was performed by the mermaid and green pirate ÔøΩ? Everything else just seemed a little kiddie Peter panish, but is good for folks with small children. The seating is also very comfortable here, which made my experience as an adult more endurable. Lastly it took a long time to get salad dressing for my salad because the other tables were not passing it down. I would prefer that they provide a small cup of dressing or maybe a saucer on each table with dressing to expedite the wait period. They also provide pitchers of water and coke on each table which was convenient. Upon arriving you're asked to stand in front of a green screen while they take your picture just like before you get on a cruise . The only downside to this is that they don't tell you the prices up front and try to sell you a photo package during the show with a flashlight . This was a bit bothersome given I was selected to help during the show as an audience member and was unable to get out of my booth to complete the task when signaled because the staff was  discussing the photo package with someone on the end of the booth, whom I needed to move to get out.

We loved the speakeasy feel of the place, and the rotating chefs creating menus from all of over the world makes this a unique place to visit that can't ever become boring. What I think is so special about this South End Speakeasy is that they showcase up-and-coming chefs, giving them a place to be creative.\\n\\nOur menu was created by Humaari which had a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern vibe. We originally had a reservation for 6, in which case, for a set price, the chef will prepare dishes to share specially for your group. Sadly, 4 our crew's flights were cancelled, so it was just my husband and me. Our server recommended ordering several to share plates, so we started with the Grilled Black Mission Figs. A perfect size for sharing, this delicious dish was definitely our favorite. We also shared the Marinated Summer Vegetables hummus- I HIGHLY recommend this. It was so fresh, we were licking the plate clean. They will replace your pita, too, if you run out. The Chickpea Crepes were next. The dish, served with baba ganoush, red onion, ramp pesto and maras, was tasty, extremely savory. I thought this would be my favorite, but it probably ranked number four for me. This might be because it got forgotten and we didn't get it until we were tired, full, and ready to leave. There were other options that included meats, but we find we love to eat vegetarian when it comes to Mediterranean meals. \\n\\nMy husband had the Ghost Hunter cocktail which he loved. I started with the Persian Summer, which reads like a dark and stormy, but is extremely sweet. I followed it with the Into the Wild, which was polar opposite: earthy and savory. I preferred the latter with our meal.\\n\\nOur service was extremely slow. The tables to our left and right turned over twice before we were able to leave, and we were not eating slowly or trying to stay up all night. Be prepared to be patient.  We had a wonderful time, but our expectations were a little dampened when we weren't able to do the 6 person tasting meal."},{"name":"Tapestry","address":"69 Kilmarnock St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"If you're in the Fenway area, Tapestry is an okay place to check out for a drink.

However, when she saw that the sushi dish had all except 1 1/2 pieces left, and asked if we would like to take them home, we said no thank you, and she made no inquiry as to why we didn't eat the dish.

The parking here is pretty bad. The options you have is the $15 parking with no attendant across the street, or hitting a jackpot in getting a spot on the street. Anyways, luckily we did hit the jackpot and we got a spot on the street and paid $4 for 2 hours.\\n\\nAnyways, this is what we ordered:\\n\\nShe-Crab Soup \\nBourbon Cured Salmon\\nCrab cake\\nChicken and waffles\\n\\nBy far, I would definitely recommend to get the She-Crab Soup. the soup was absolutely creamy and wonderful to eat. The crab they placed in the soup was neat as it was chilled, but it was a wonderful surprise. \\n\\nI would suggest to skip the bourbon cured salmon. It didn't really hit the spot, and to be honest I didn't really taste the bourbon. The title is a bit misleading and it should be \\"lightly flavored bourbon cured salmon.\\" Anyways, yeah, the bourbon soaking of the salmon didn't do much as much as the flavor.\\n\\nEntr√©es were good! I ordered the crab cake the pur√©e was tasty and flavorful and perfect to mix with the crab cake. Resting on top was a nice sunny side egg, and was great in mixing in the pur√©e.\\n\\nThe chicken and waffles were good as well. I mean, that's what they're known for. The chicken was pretty seasoned, but I think the reason for that was that it was to mix with the syrup and because of the syrup gives you that chicken to a sweet and salty tingly sensation in your mouth. The waffle was also great, but I feel like it was a little spongy. In my mind Belgian waffles aren't as spongy, but the waffle wasn't bad.\\n\\nAll in all, it wasn't bad and I'm a fan. One thing that everyone will see though is that South City isn't a reasonable priced place. I wouldn't say it's worth it, but at the same time once in a while is great. My total came around to be $90-100 with the tip included for 4 dishes and a mimosa (the waiter was amazing). It's a great place to try out if you're looking for a brunch spot and you're within walking distance.

Having seen the menu online I was confused to the lack of categories for dishes. Our waiter informed us that the restaurant aims to create a sharing environment where plates are medium sized, making 1 and 1/2 plates per person the recommended portion. My group of three decided to split a dish and then each order our own with sharing implied, which worked well for us. \\n\\nAll the dishes we had were truly some of the most unique food I've ever experience. We had:\\n- Raw Pumpkin Salad with Ricotta Salata and Pine Nuts. This was easily my favorite because of how each ingredient stood out and meshed together. I would highly recommend and am curious to see how the other yummy sounding salads compare.\\n- Pickled Corn Pancakes. I'm not sure how well the pickling comes through, but I found that these were much sweeter than I expected and heartier, yet fluffy as well. They're a twist on a pancake rather than on cornbread. \\n- Cinnamon Roll. I've never had a cinnamon roll as fluffy and crusty as this one. It's served straight from the kitchen in a small cast iron pan and isn't drowned in sugar like other places tend to do.\\n- Sausage and Potato Skillet and Croissant Toad in the Hole. The two others I was with ordered these. The skillet dish was larger and heartier than the rest of the meal and the croissant dish was also sweeter than expected but balanced by a salty gravy. \\n\\nThe restaurant changes its menu regularly so these items may not still be available. From what I've seen the chef makes an effort to include menu items suited to dietary restrictions regularly.\\n\\nMy only complaint is how difficult it was to hear anything our waiter was saying, but that might have been a consequence of our location.

My dish was just big enough that I could finish, but I was to be stuffed for the rest of the day. That's okay with me, because it makes the price tag worth it. But unfortunately, because of the taste, the overall dish was a bust. The shrimp were tiny (why is shrimp even in the name of the dish) and didn't taste worthwhile. The grits were good, but I'm generally tolerant of all kinds of grits because I'm a huge fan, so that doesn't say much. The biscuit was pretty bland.\\n\\nI also tried the pancakes and the bacon.

I do not like this method, especially, when there are only two people at a table. They need to do better with timing and bring out plates at the same time.\\nNow back to Apres Diem, when my plate was brought out (well after my friend's), another lady brought out my plate and explained that the sandwich has cheese in it. They could not remove it because all the portobello sandwiches were prepped in the morning (eek!!). I also noticed that the bread had cheese baked into it as well. Then she proceeded to ask me if this would be alright. I said no and ordered something else (avocado and hummus sandwich with fries, minus cheese). What blows my mind is that no one thought to explain this to me, before cooking the entree?? Nonetheless, they were apologetic and even returned shortly after with my original fries stating I could go ahead and eat on those while I wait for a new sandwich to be prepared.\\nAfter all that, the sandwich and fries were just so-so. The revolving staff (three different people served our table and our original waitress came back at a later time and asked for our order again, when she supposedly had already put our order in) and subpar food was enough to overshadow the good drink and prime location."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Really good BBQ, but I was got there before the lines doing field tech work for the COA.

Time flies when you are reviewing restaurants, am I right?\\n\\nWell, Bruno's. I can't comment on the taste of their burgers because we didn't try them, but I can say they were expensive. We hoped to get a meal and a drink, but the prices really surprised us. I know there are some upscale restaurants in Lynn (Blue Ox, for example) but given the location we kinda thought it would be more \\"downscale\\" (like their bathrooms are. Just sayin.)\\n\\nWe did get fries with cheese and bacon, which we enjoyed. We were there with one other customer, so service was quick. Oh, and no light beer on draft. So that's a minus 1 for beer and minus 1 for prices/bathrooms. If you want to charge $17 for a burger, the bathroom should be nicer than what you would find in a dingy dive bar. $20 for 2 beers and fries...I think we'll stick with the low key, reasonably priced, nicer bathroom places we have enjoyed in Lynn."},{"name":"Clover Food Lab","address":"5 Cambridge Ctr","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Time it takes Starbucks to make an iced coffee: 30s\\nTime it takes Clover to make an iced coffee: 15 min\\n\\nYou might say I'm not appreciating the full complexity of the coffee making experience that Clover delivers to customers.

That's totally something I would do, I mean, I've been know to drive 2 hours just for a good dinner, only to drive back afterwards. That all being said, for some reason I really didn't care about Franklin's, however, my FIANC√â was completely intrigued so HE WOKE UP at the ass crack of dawn (on Super Bowl Sunday) to get a spot in the line we were warned about since getting to Austin.... He got there at 7:15am, and updated me every hour about his progress... And he finally got the goods ($165 worth!) at 11:18am and they were being throw back in our faces by noon (he brought everything home- WHAT A KEEPER, I KNOW!) \\n\\nPart of the reason why I didn't give two shits about this place is because...\\nA. On their website it said that they didn't have any turkey at this time. While sure I may at least take a tiny bite of brisket crust just so I can review it, I wasn't about to pound two pounds worth of the fatty stuff... After all, I didn't have a death wish. \\nB. Even if Franklin's did have turkey, I have experienced Smoked Turkey before and I really wasn't much of a fan... \\n\\nTo my surprise though, when my fianc√© opened the SOAKING WET PACKAGE OF MEAT... There laid 1.5 pounds of smoked turkey breast. Did I mention how my fianc√© is a effing KEEPER?! He totally read my mind because even though I was being passive aggressive about not caring as to whether or not Franklin's had turkey.... I secretly REALLY WANTED TO TRY IT...\\n\\nAnd try it I did! I ate AN ENTIRE POUND of the white meat, while standing up at the counter, with my hands... And paired it with the pickled onions & pickles. \\n\\nYes. Why yes, this was probably some of the best turkey I've ever had... Minus that one time I got some roasted turkey at Whole Foods in LA, where I wound up confessing to all my Facebook friends that I was to marry it... No status update on this meat. The turkey obviously tasted smoky, but not disgustingly smoky (I hate that flavor) and also tasted a bit like brisket because it was stewing in brisket fat while being transported to the house... Mmmm!\\n\\nYou all probably give ZERO Fs about the turkey though, after all BBQ is all about the brisket. Well, my fianc√© said point blank: It's not the best I've ever had... Definitely NOT worth the wait and freezing \\"my balls off\\" for four hours. The crust wasn't crusty enough and he said that it was pretty inconsistent. That being said: he about fainted when he tried the Pecan Pie... \\n\\nThe reason why Franklin's is rated nearly perfect on Yelp is because their marketing is ON POINT! Creating HYPE about a place only entices people to want to check it out more... And I was told the people working at Franklin's are incredibly nice, so that helps!\\n\\nSure the food was tasty, and I definitely finished off the turkey later that evening... But I don't think I'd ever have it again... There are PLENTY OF OTHER BBQ JOINTS in Austin that are just as good, if not better, where you also don't have to wait.\\n\\nHow should I THANK MY FIANC√â for going for it though? He's a trooper!!"},{"name":"The Greenery Creamery","address":"420 E Church St, Unit 112","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"My first impression of the space, was that it reminded me of a hip ice cream parlor up north.

The ice cream is really sweet and the additional toppings/cookies/brownies/waffles just make it unbearably sweet. I prefer fruity flavors to chocolatey, sweet ones but they only have strawberry (probably to complement the cookies/baked goods). I had the caramel pretzel flavor last time I went and it was insanely sweet. The consistency was a bit grainy and not smooth, which was odd.

We had spent most of the day in the park and looked to grab a quick dinner before heading back to the room for the night. \\n\\nOur group had been very excited to try this restaurant because half of us loved burgers and half of us loved sushi. Unfortunately our service took away from the experience for everyone. \\n\\nWe waited about 15 minutes for our table and were seated outside overlooking CityWalk. Upon sitting down no one came over to greet us. Waiters came around us but no one seemed to pay any attention that we were there. It was difficult to get anyone's attention but finally after about 20 minutes our Waitor came over, Michael. We quickly ordered our drinks and food since we had plenty of time to ponder over the menu. After this our waiter was no where to be found. We waited a long time for our food. Tables that had been seated after us had finished and left and we had not even received our food. \\n\\nOur food was finally brought out by someone other than Michael, who still was not around. One person in our group asked for a side of mayonnaise for her burger. The food runners said they would return with it, but never did. We looked around for our waiter to put in another request but he never came over. We asked another waiter for a side of mayonnaise after telling him it was never received and yet the request still went unfulfilled. \\n\\nAside from the service, two of our friends ordered the Bento Boxes which they told us they very much enjoyed and would recommend. The rest of our burgers were dry and hard and the fries were ice cold. Upon finishing our meals Michael had still not returned. He was standing in the corner talking to other waiters and even with multiple exchanges of eye contact, did not come over. We asked another waiter if he could get our check and he said he would find ours and ask. He finally returned without the check, which we requested again and explained the other requests that had not been fulfilled. He was unapologetic and went off to get the bill. We wound up having to pay with cash and leave it on the table because once again, he never returned.\\n\\nThe experience ruined this place for us as a whole.

Since it was literally just myself and my wife eating, we opted to get a wide variety since we knew we could not destroy all 5 lbs.\\n\\nWe got 2 lbs of pork ribs, 1 lb of brisket, 1 lb of pulled pork, and 1 lb of sausage.\\n\\nThe online ordering system doesn't allow you to get the beef ribs, which was a huge disappointment.\\n\\nOur pick up time was about 12:15, however, even though you pre-order it takes about 30+ minutes to get your order prepared after checking in and paying off your balance.  I was hoping I could get it right away without any wait, but 30 is fine compared to having to try waiting in the regular line.\\n\\nAfter getting all the food, we actually found some friends in Austin that was reluctant (insert sarcasm) to help eat our 5 lbs of meat.\\n\\nTo start off the pork ribs were absolutely the best I had ever had! The brisket was very good, we got extra moist, but I've others that were as comparable (ie: Killen's in Houston and La BBQ in Austin), the pulled pork and sausage was good but nothing to rave about, I did skip out on sides.  I did get a chance to try all 3 of the sauces.  I liked their straight forward classic and the coffee, was not much of a fan of the vinegar one.\\n\\nTLDR Version:\\n\\nPork Ribs - EXCELLENT\\nPre Order - Saves time."},{"name":"Dang's Thai Kitchen","address":"670 N State St","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"Great Kua Tender Beef!

Instead i was greeted with possibly the most home-like, wonderful experience i have ever had. I walked up to Franklin around 9 am, way later than it is recommended, and found the line already fully formed, beyond the building, and just shy of the coffee stand. I was waiting about 10 minutes before i was graciously offered a fold out chair, i was very thankful for this, for i knew i had about 3 more hours to go. While in line, i not only met some very nice people, enjoyed an ice cold beverage (yes you can get out of line to get coffee or beer) and learned so much while sweating in the sun. It was an experience i'll never forget. By the time the line began moving, it felt like no time before i was inside, picking through 'merch' and deciding what to order. Of course i went with a little of everything and even took some back to where i was staying. To say Franklin BBQ's food is good is a true understatement. It truly is: true Texas BBQ. From the sauces, to the seasoning (yes, just salt and pepper) from the first bite, to the final full and exhausted breath, its enjoyed thoroughly. Of course i will be going back, but i also can't wait for others to have the experience i had so we can discuss and talk about how great and magical that place truly is.

I have probably eaten here 7-8 times and have found that the food is more underwhelming with each visit and one of the most annoying things is the rather paltry, skimpy portions of important parts of just about any entree.   \\nSpecifically today, my wife ordered their Orange chicken salad and found that they were really cheap on the amount of chicken they added to the dish, choosing instead to enhance their offering by depositing about a quarter pound of fried won-ton skins  (instead of a generous and appropriate amount of chicken).  This issue has not historically been limited to this one salad.  I have had other salads and find that they do the same thing.  Skimp, skimp, skimp.  It would not be such an issue if the prices were a bit more reasonable but with the 14.99 price, I would think it would not be too much to ask to have the signature item be more evident and obvious.  It wasn't.\\nI ordered from their weekend brunch menu and had the farmer's scramble which had egg, asparagus, white cheddar and mushroom.  I added bacon for 3.00 extra and also asked for sourdough toast (an option on their menu).  The scramble was also served with yukon gold potatoes.  When it arrived at our table, I found that the eggs were fairly well prepared, but I was not able to taste much evidence of any white cheddar and there were hardly any potatoes on my plate(and those that were there were overcooked and mushy).  The side of bacon was only two slices of thin sliced bacon that was sort of dumped on top of my scramble and it was not really very well cooked and was limp and very greasy.  The sourdough toast was cold and there was not even one actual piece of bread on my plate.  \\nWell, in my view, this place is not going to be very near the top of my list unless they get their act together.  If you're going to charge what you charge,  you need to not be skimpy with the important parts of the meal and you will find that people will likely gravitate to your competitors as there are other places that make far better sandwiches and burgers and charge less.  If they charge more, they at least are generous with the portions.  My prediction is that Twigs will not last more than a couple of years because they are morphing into much more of what a typical chain is and are now on the edge of mediocre."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Very traditional buttermilk fried chicken with a modern twist.

The burger is definitely pretty overwhelming, but goes nicely with the cool, refreshing potato salad. This genius idea needs to be on more menus.\\n\\n- Sweet & Sour Yodas ($3.50)\\nThis is what they call their brussels sprouts, which were incredible and among the best I've ever had. Lightly fried and glazed with apricot vinegar and curry spices, this was another dish you wouldn't find at any other ramen joints, but was a very welcome find.\\n\\n- Pork Chashu Rice Bowl ($4 with ramen combo)\\nAt just $4 with the purchase of ramen, I couldn't resist trying this, and it was indeed a bargain. It's a healthy sized bowl of excellent rice topped with plenty of soft, delicious chashu. This is a great side dish if you would like to opt for the more traditional ramen restaurant offerings.\\n\\n- Mi-So-Hot Ramen ($10)\\nIncredible. This large bowl, topped with ground pork, napa cabbage, bean sprouts and a perfect soft boiled egg, was one of the most satisfying I've ever had. I knew I needed to try the Tonkotsu broth, so instead of getting just the Original, I went with this one, which added some great heat to it. Not only was the broth incredibly rich and flavorful, but the noodles were outstanding too. They have flavor \\"bombs\\" that you can add to any bowl, but I don't see the need since the broth itself is already so great.\\n\\n- Tsukemen ($12)\\nI like ramen piping hot, so I usually don't order Tsukemen, since it means eating your noodles lukewarm, at best, by the time they've been dipped. I overheard everyone on line raving about this though, so I was intrigued, and I was very happy to have tried it. The dipping broth was so thick that it really coated the noodles well when dipped. There was also a nice, fatty piece of pork and a great soft boiled egg along with the noodles, which made this another really great bowl of ramen.\\n\\n- Almond Tofu ($2)\\nDessert was the one misstep here. This was a little block of silken tofu with a few orange slices beneath it, which made for a pretty unpleasant flavor combination. There is no need to order desser though with all this great food, so just skip this.\\n\\nThis is some legit ramen. Don't forget to try the amazing small bites too though.

Waiter Thomas is very attentive and knowledgeable, was able to help give pointers on the menu. Seemed very genuine and set a great atmosphere. Stuck with the staple, and couldn't be more happy! Sweet potato waffles are tasty and not overpowering and the chicken on top was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I will say the spice in the chicken crust can be slightly overwhelming but I like it. I will warn newcomers that the 1 piece chicken and waffles will keep you satisfied, the 2 and 3 piece options are reserved for the hulk or a small village.

It reminded me a lot of Serendipity in New York. It's a very small restaurant so I'm glad I made reservations. We were seated immediately but the restaurant didn't get really busy until about 7pm. The menu is really overwhelming and had a little bit of everything. The thing I didn't like about the menu is that they don't describe what liquors or garnishes are put in their drinks. For someone with a cinnamon allergy that's pretty important! I asked our server if the root beer or the German chocolate drinks had cinnamon or if he knew of any I should stay away from. He said without checking with anyone that I was fine with the root beer but would get back with me about the German chocolate....he never did. And I skipped a second drink because it seemed he didn't take my allergy very seriously. I will say the root beer mixed drink was delicious. \\n\\nI made a mistake with my meal, I should have just gotten a burger or pasta dish, instead I got Nutella pancakes. I was really excited I could get breakfast for dinner! They were good pancakes loaded with Nutella but just way too sweet for me. I couldn't even eat half of them. We sat with our plates untouched for more than 30 minutes before the server came to check on us and ask if we needed anything else. That was way too long! And it's not like he wasn't near by, he was all over the two tables next to us. We definitely felt ignored. Despite this we were having a good time and decided to get dessert. I got a frozen hot chocolate and it was amazing! It was just as good as serendipity!\\n\\nThe service could have been better but everything I had was good. The restaurant is very loud and apparently is the place to be to celebrate birthdays where all the servers come clap, the lights go down and the music goes even louder for a few minutes. We saw so many celebrations we didn't have the heart to tell our server we were celebrating a birthday as well. There is a bar to sit at inside and you can also order ice cream and desserts from the candy shop. The candy shop doesn't have prices on anything but the magnets, key chains and signature lollipops ($26!!!!!). What really turned me off though was someone had dropped chicken wings on the floor of the shop and no one was picking them up! A manager actually walked by them twice! Shook his head and headed into the restaurant! It says a lot about a place when the manager isn't even stepping up and leaves it for someone else to pick up.

The host/bartender (couldn't tell which) was glued to her phone at least 2 minutes before noticing customers had arrived. That was incredibly off putting as this is our first impression of the restaurant. The table she offered us was way in the back of the noisiest little room of the restaurant, where all but one party in the entire restaurant was packed into. \\n\\nI did notice the bar had a really nice selection of Japanese whisky, scotch, aperitifs, and more, but we decided against the bar since we had already been ignored lol. \\n\\nWe had the calamari app which was obviously frozen, possibly freezer burned- it was dry in a way I didn't realize fried food could be. Breading and sauce were nice- food was obviously in the window too long or burned. There were fried gherkins and cornichons included in here and it threw me off guessing if the next one would be sweet, or sour and briney.\\n\\nWe had seen many nice pictures of entrees on Yelp and none of them were on the menu due to the menu changing frequently. Not a big deal, but would've been nice to know ahead of time. Entrees came out and I could tell they had the potential to be good, but I was really disappointed! It seemed so thrown together. I had the Siam Chicken with brown rice, sauce was sweet and portion was huge for lunch. Chicken wasn't bad but the dish as a whole felt soggy. The stemmy parsley garnish was more of a nuisance. Plates were messy. My partner had the Prik Khing Beef and it was such a weird crispy texture for beef; not fit for an entree. Would be better as an app maybe? Idk. Both dishes had pineapple and it was obviously not fresh. The plates were loaded with veggies which I appreciated because they weren't overlooked and quite possibly he saving grace to the edibility of our lunch. \\n\\nOrdinarily I wouldn't pick apart a visit like this, but working in the industry, I can tell when a place isn't too worried about the standard of their food and service due to being overwhelmed by business. At some point, you should know better. Judging on their reviews, they do, and maybe didn't care this day. Your customers can tell when you're understaffed. Our waitress was literally running around her whole shift. \\n\\nTLDR; if you like mediocre Asian food, maybe there's a cheaper option somewhere else.

Coming down from Seattle, I was aware of Portland's brunch culture. Worried that it would be difficult to get a seat here (lots of brunch places don't take reservations, including Screen Door), I called in before heading over. They gave us an estimate of about an hour for a party of 6, but did offer to put us down on the waitlist before arriving, which was really nice! We stayed across the border, so it took us half an hour to get to the place. Lo and behold, half an hour after arriving, we got our table. That being said, the restaurant was quite crowded, with a cluster of people surrounding the entrance, all of them waiting for their table.\\n\\nWe were seated outdoors, but passing through the restaurant, I can say that the interior was really comfy and inviting. The wooden decor felt like a bit of a throwback but also felt a bit homey and welcoming for the meal we were about to have. The outdoor seating was also quite comfortable, we were streetside under a shady patio to protect us from the heat of the Portland summer.\\n\\nThe service here was really friendly and casual, not much else to say here. What was surprising was that the food came pretty quickly considering how busy the restaurant was! We ordered a lot of food, so the speed of service did not disappoint.\\n\\nThe first thing to come out were two orders of praline-crusted bacon. I tried a bit of just the pralines without any meat. Let me just say that the flavor of the bacon was incredibly present. The first thing that hit was the sweetness of the sugar and pralines, but then the smokiness and fattiness of the bacon followed. It was a great blend of sweet and savory. Biting into the bacon was great. I think it was really smart of them to not go for a super crispy bacon strip, because the pralines already provide the crunch. This bacon was a little thicker than what you'd probably make at home, but it was still very fatty and tender. That being said, I could only eat one strip because this thing is HEAVY. The sweetness of the crust and the fat of the bacon can be a bit overwhelming, so I don't recommend eating it all at once. Take your time with the bacon and savor it, 3 strips is plenty!\\n\\nMy friend and I split two dishes: chicken and waffles, and fried oyster Eggs Benedict. We got 3 pieces of chicken, and let me start off by saying that 3 pieces of chicken was too many pieces of chicken. The chicken is BIG. We could've done with just two pieces between us. But that's not a complaint at all! The more the merrier, after all.\\n\\nThis chicken is GOOD. The seasoning on the batter would put those \\"11 herbs and spices\\" to shame; there's so much flavor in the batter! You can see specks of seasoning and flavors in the batter. You get hit with a lot of pepper, but also a bit of heat. The meat was quite juicy and tender. Chicken breast can easily dry out with fried chicken, and white meat isn't my favorite, but this was cooked so well! The strong flavors of the batter works wonders when contrasted with the syrup they give and a dab of their house hot sauce. THE HOT SAUCE. It was simple, I think just some peppers with vinegar, but it cuts the heaviness of the fried chicken without sacrificing its flavor. Add a bit of that sweet potato waffle and you've got yourself a great bite. Speaking of which, let's talk about the waffle! The waffle batter they used was a step above lots of other waffles you get at brunch restaurants. Soft and fluffy, and the use of sweet potato gave it some depth and variance to the flavor. My friend and I also argued over whether it was ginger or cinnamon that we tasted in the waffle (I say cinnamon), but regardless, this waffle is exciting! Again, it played an excellent contrast to the savory chicken, and the syrup brought it all together. Sweet enough to be a bridge between the two flavors, but not too much as to overwhelm the yin and yang of the two main parts of the dish.\\n\\nThe fried oysters and Eggs Benedict was also quite good. This was the first time I've ever tried fried oysters, and I can definitely say it's something I'll come back to. There wasn't too much funky flavor to the oyster, and the cornmeal batter didn't take anything away from the oyster. The benedict was nice and standard, egg was cooked perfectly. The only problem I had was that the hollandaise sauce was a bit thick, but that might be because I let it sit for a bit, so the sauce set a bit. And the GRITS! They are addictive. The cheddar flavor with the consistency of the grits makes it taste like mac and cheese, but it's like a porridge. I could eat only that and maybe some bacon and be satisfied.\\n\\nI came with high expectations of this place, and they definitely met them. I don't often have brunch, especially Southern brunch, so this was an amazing treat. I'll definitely be coming back again for those chicken and waffles.

She laughs and says well good luck I've been here for a about 10\\nMin and no one has even taken my order yet. When all three employees approach NOT ONE employee knew of such a number. Oh and by the by NOT ONE EMPLOYEE spoke English except the teen cashier.( another customer walks in turns out he too is coming from the drive thrust while listening to my exchange he leaves and states well that explains ) I ask when is a manager going to be on duty. I'm told NEXT WEEK. I ask how is that possible who will be doing your deposits, or tallies, and closing and opening the main store. The teen says well the manager is on vacation. I ask ok what about store managers, shift mangers. You have non of those. He tells me no. WHAT!!!!!

They are open 24/7. My first visit was because I Googled for an emergency pet hospital that was still open at 9 or 10 at night and found ivg MetroWest in Natick. I took my cat here when he became extremely confused and I thought he was dying. He was probably age 14 at the time. They were able to see me after a short wait and took him in the back room and got a urine sample well I waited. It turned out he had a urinary tract infection which is what made him confused. They gave me some medicine and he was fine a few days later. The vet visit was not cheap because it was an emergency visit probably around $300 but that included the medicine that he needed to take to clear up his infection.\\n\\nAt the end of 2015 I had to take my female 17 year old cat in to have her put to sleep because one of her organs were shutting down possibly her kidneys which I was told is common in elderly cats. She stopped eating food suddenly and within a few weeks she had lost all her muscle mass and could barely walk so I knew she had to be put down because it was nothing else anyone could do. I went to ivg Metrowest because they cost exactly the same as my local vet for putting a pet down but it's more convenient to go to ivg Metrowest for euthanasia because you don't need an appointment you can go in any day you want and you just call them about an hour beforehand to let them know you're coming in. I had a new job where I was working every day and worked that Saturday and had to work Monday so I spent Sunday with my cat and took her Sunday evening to put her down. They were very nice and they put you in a private room that has couches.\\nIt is now July 2017 and a few days ago my other, almost 19 year old cat (sibling of the cat I already put down) needed to be put down. I chose ivg MetroWest put him down because I knew about their process and that it's much more convenient to bring your pet here then to make a scheduled appointment with your local vet. I don't like the idea of scheduling appointment I want to just have time with my cat and then when I'm ready take the cat and go and not have to worry about being somewhere at an exact time. \\nIn January of 2016 the same cat had a fall down the stairs and needed emergency surgery to remove one of his front legs due to the fall. It was 11 p.m. During the week so again this cat that had the UTI previously I knew I could take him to ivg Metrowest. They kept him overnight and made sure to consult the radiologist to find out if they could fix his leg or amputate. It turns out I had to be amputated but even in his elderly age they were able to keep him alive and provided such good care that he lived from January of 2016 to July 2017 missing his left front leg. He was still able to get around and was able to live a long full life.\\nI would recommend going here if you have an emergency with your pet or you know you need to put your pet to sleep."},{"name":"B√°nh M√¨ Tr√®s Bon","address":"1840-4720 McClelland Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"4","text":"A cute little family owned Vietnamese restaurant in Richmond, Canada.

Ribs, sauce, both are unique, alone or together. And the nice thing is, you can enjoy them either way! Yep, when you order ribs at Fat Matt's, you're getting a distinct rib flavor (alone if you want), or a distinct rib flavor with a sweet, but spicy, sauce that's not quite like one you've had before. Here it is:\\n\\nFACTORS: Food, Price, Service, Location/Parking, Accessibility/Atmosphere/Decor.\\n\\nFOOD: I had the Rib Sandwich with a side of rum baked beans and collared greens. \\n\\nRib Sandwich: as mentioned, the ribs are fantastic. I'm not big on the idea of a rib sandwich, though, because it's incredibly difficult to actual eat it as a sandwich (you know, due to the massive rib bones that run through the meat). But I know it's \\"a thing\\" so I digress. Anyways, at the very least I would have hoped that the bread would have been something a little more special. From what I could see and taste, it was your run of the mill white bread that hurt the aesthetics of these nationally acclaimed ribs. So I just took the bread away. The RIBS themselves were absolutely amazing. They were quite close to falling of the bone, and on the outside they were slightly charred which added a sharp Smokey flavor to the meat. The SAUCE - you can add it, or not, you'll enjoy the ribs either way. I added it, and it could be a little too sweet or spicy depending on how much you much you slather on. \\n\\nRum Baked Beans: I thought these were good, but I didn't feel the \\"speciality\\" that they were supposed to bring. They weren't too far off from a can of Bush's sweet baked beans from Kroger it seemed. Maybe it was just my batch that felt that way, or something is wrong with my tastebuds (just kidding! You can trust my reviews ;P).\\n\\nCollared Greens: Now, I actually dislike collared greens in general, so it wasn't a great idea for me to order them. As I expected, I didn't enjoy them, and kind of had to force myself to eat them. HOWEVER, as far as collared greens go, I disliked these the least -- so that must mean they're good for you collared-green lovers out there. Ultimately, if you don't like collared greens, don't expect these to change the way you thought about them. \\n\\nPRICE: The prices here are on par with the going rate for the top BBQ joints in Atlanta, but there is a massive price differential between the rib sandwich (the cheapest) and the actual racks of ribs. You're almost forced to get the rib sandwich if you have to stick to a budget when eating out, which I thought was a bummer. I got the rib sandwich because of this price differential, but would have rather had something else. You get what you pay for, I guess. Also, the sides cost a little more than I'd personally value them at--I'd rather have just ordered a 1/4 rack in retrospect. The ribs in the rib sandwich alone though are worth the ~$8 you'll drop on them--at least to try.\\n\\nSERVICE: the service was great -- the girl who took our order was super nice, as was the manager. This isn't the type of place where you're waited on, but the staff made their rounds and cleared tables and while they're out on the floor they would frequently ask whether we needed anything. They also know little facts and tidbits about the history of Fat Matt's -- so feel free to inquire - they're more than happy to answer it seems. \\n\\nLOCATION/PARKING: the location is is very busy -- the street is two lanes--so depending on the time of day, it will be tough to get into the parking lot. If you do get into the parking lot, it will be tough to find parking--even at 10:30pm on a weekday I snagged the last spot in the lot at the time. \\n\\nACCESSIBILITY/ATMOSPHERE/DECOR: The parking lot is leveled well, there are no stairs or obstacles of that sort, and I didn't really identify any real obstacles to entry. The only thing to note is that the restaurant is very small and it may be difficult to maneuver inside, especially if it is busy. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is fine -- the only artificial lighting they have are red lights, which I wasn't a fan of. But during the day the massive windows ought to allow a lot of natural light. \\n\\nDecor -- I thought the decor was appropriate -- this is a historic, famous, quasi-hole-in-the-wall kind of rib joint. It's exactly as I imagined it would be, and it was exactly what suits it. \\n\\nOVERALL: I'd highly recommend Fat Matt's as some of the best ribs I've ever had--if you can get in, and aren't glued to a  less than $10 budget, treat yourself here--chances are that you won't regret it!"},{"name":"Sweet Masterpiece Wine Bar & Bistro","address":"922 NW Davis St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm so glad these reviews are typed out and not spoken, because I assure you if you had to hear people talk about this place that you couldn't understand a word they were saying as the involuntary drool gushes from their mouths.\\n\\nThey've got an incredible variety of delicious treats, including Vegan Cheesecake (yeah I don't know how they did that one either).

I'm not a fan of calamari but I always try it. The coating and sauce were awesome and my husband devoured it. He was impressed. The arancini type balls were ok. Only 3 per order but they were good. I wouldn't order them again. The bruschetta was a single piece. I loved the flavors but I think if they made that meat crispy it would be out of this world. The $8 Zucca Burger was a slider on the Happy Hour menu. I had asked if it came with fries and was told no so I was surprised when it arrived with fries. I had told the waiter that I didn't want fries. I've recently developed an allergy of sorts to potatoes so that was pure torture.

So when the host was showing us to a table we saw a bunch of nice comfy looking booths to relax in .

So happy we only ordered 3 dishes because we could barely finish I can't imagine having double the amount of food we ate. They had dollar cotuit oysters that were served with a nice light vinaigrette. They were SO fresh plump and delicious. Some of the best oysters I had all year. We also got the ricotta toast which was the best thing we ate all night. It could have passed as dessert with how creamy, sweet, and decadent it was. They had a cavatelli on the menu with a veal bolognese but neither of us eat red meat so they changed it to have maitake mushrooms and it was unreal. Everything melted in my mouth. Our last dish was the fried chicken. While it was good, it was forgettable compared to our first two dishes. Lots of crunch but not enough meat. My friend asked if we could have both the bbq sauce and ranch to try with the fried chicken they waiter said of course but didn't inform us it would cost extra.

Franklins allowed me to realize my dream of having brisket for breakfast, lunch, dinner and breakfast again all consecutively. \\n\\nI pre-ordered a few weeks before coming to Austin - 3lbs of brisket, 1lbs of ribs, and 1lbs of sausage links. This was to be shared between 2 people. This is definitely too much food for a single meal between two adults. However, it's a 5lb minimum for preorders and allows you to skip the line. Some might argue the line is part of the experience, and I'm sure it's a grand time! But we only had a couple days in Austin and didn't want to spend half a day waiting in line. \\n\\nBrisket:\\nThe brisket is probably one of the best pieces of any meat I've had. \\nSUPER TENDER AND SOFT. Holding a brisket slice up, you can see the meat falling apart and all the fat fully rendered. It also had an excellent smoke ring - super flavourful part. The bark of the brisket is not burnt (like most other BBQ places I've been to) but has a nice crust around it. \\n\\nRibs:\\nAgain, I dunno how Aaron does it. The ribs are smoked for 6-7 hours, and there's just the most amazing bark on it. Nothing is burnt, just smoked perfectly to a nice crust.

Most of my memories here have been positive (mostly weekday night drinks on celebratory occasions), but my most recent experience with the remarkably poor service left me with such a negative impression of Border Cafe as a whole.\\n\\nWe came for drinks on a Friday night for my bachelorette party and the process of getting a table was the worst that I had ever experienced. The hostess was rude and the process was incredibly disorganized. I was among the first 3 people in our party to check-in to put our name down for a table. They gave us a buzzer but wouldn't let us have a time estimate until everyone arrived. Once everyone (8 people total) arrived, we were added to the end of the wait list, even though 3 of us had been waiting there already. We were quoted a 40-50 minute wait time and one person went down the street to grab a bite. 30 minutes later, they were ready for us and so I called my friend to come back. Literally about a minute later, the hostess was insisting that she had to give our table away even though 7/8 of us were there. My friend came back within 5 minutes but they gave our table away. Needless to say, it was a sour start to the night and I'll definitely be looking for a new place to celebrate (even though I do still like their margaritas)."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Looks like I was reviewing Screen Door every year, and then I missed 2012...and now it's almost 2014.

For starters, I ordered the Grilled Calamari and Octopus Salad, which consisted of baby spinach, spring onion, and orange supremes tossed in a citron butter, topped with grilled calamari and octopus, and garnished with crispy kale. I liked how tender the calamari and octopus were. The salad dressing was quite interesting - buttery, creamy, and salty. For dinner, I ordered the Miso-Sake Glazed Haddock, which was served with ginger sauteed sugar snap peas and topped with furikake - tempura crisps. I've never had a tastier haddock. In my opinion, it had a stronger sweet miso taste than a sake taste. The ginger-scallion flavor of the sauteed sugar snap peas reminded me of my parents home cooking.

Naturally we ordered a waffle which my friend doused with some table-side syrup. Not being raised in the USA I am unfamiliar with such syrupy goodness ways and therefore I stayed simple with plain butter on my half.

Anyway, they transformed from a meat market to meat market serving lunch and now to this restaurant.  Wonderful friendly people.  But the food is why we come.  After reading some of the bad reviews about this place - I had to put my review in to try to answer a few critics.\\n\\nAs stated many times, BYOB, cash only, no menu, be sure to make a reservation.  Seen several reviewers on Yelp and Tripadvisor saying they have no menu so they can charge whatever price they want.  Well, I do not believe that is why they have no menu (they do have a lunch menu with prices if you really need to see something with a $ on it).  You can almost order anything you want in a typical Italian place - so there is no menu because they can make pretty much anything you want. If you need suggestions or have no idea what to order in an Italian restaurant - they are glad to tell you what your options are.\\n\\nI go there with family or guys night for dinner.  Everybody is happy.  Portions are very generous.  We almost always leave with leftovers.\\n\\nHighly recommend the Joey  shrimp appetizer.  I usually order the veal and eggplant parm with fusilli.  Always delicious.  Careful you cheap people who think this place is expensive - I think they charge a few $ extra for the homemade fusilli...so don't order fusilli if you are on a real tight budget and don't want to pay a little extra for pasta that you pretty much never get anywhere else (see rant below).\\n\\n...which leads me to the people who complain this is expensive.  Where are you eating this quality food for around $20-22 for a veal dish?  Joey shrimp is not cheap.  I think it is $13-14 but it feeds 4 people as an appetizer!  Desserts (they do not make these) are very good and very reasonable priced at $5.  I would love to know where these other complainers are eating this much good food at these prices.  So if you complain about Nappi - tell us where you like to go eat so we can all try it and see what you are talking about.  And, you can being your own wine in - so you are saving at least 100% of the cost of your bottle of wine by going there."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Fantastic food and a fun lunch environment.

That changed when I went to Franklin BBQ and had the best Brisket in my life.\\n\\nWe got here at 7:15 am on a normal Friday morning and were the about 30 people from the front of the line. Franklin doesn't open until 11 am, so we were equipped for the long haul with some coffee and a cooler of beer.  There are some chairs under the back stairs that you can use while waiting, but most people bring there own chairs. \\nPro tip: If you can make it within the first 50 people, you will be rewarded with shade, else you will have to bring and umbrella cause that Texas sun and heat is no joke.\\n\\nOnce all the waiting was over, we got down to business.  We got 3 pounds of brisket, 2 pounds of ribs, 1 pound of turkey, and 1/2 pound of sausage.  They threw in some pulled pork in honor of the bachelor. \\n\\nThe Verdict: IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!\\n\\nThat was the best brisket I have ever had.  We got it moist (fatty), and it just melted in your mouth, leaving behind the essences of rendered fat and smoke so good you might not want to wash it down.  I mean, if you were to wait in line and got 3 pounds of just Brisket, it is still worth it.\\n\\nNow that doesn't mean you should overlook the other contenders here.  They are all heavyweights.  The ribs are fall of the bone pork ribs that have one of the best seasonings I've tasted on ribs.  One or two of these will start willing you up, so I wouldn't go too hard on them. The Turkey I'm a little mixed about.  They drop it into this buttery gravy things right before serving it to you.  It looks so good as its getting slathered that you can help but drool. The first couple of tastes were delicious, but as the turkey gets cold, it starts to feel dry.  I guess you should it first and fast.  The sausages were good, but you can never go wrong with sausage (most of the time), and they didn't go wrong here, but it was on par with other sausages.  The pulled pork was a bonus, and although flavor was really good, it was a tad dry.  Maybe its because the Moist brisket lives up to its name so well, it just makes everything else seem dry.\\n\\nOverall don't get me wrong, I am not being critical, because at the end of the day, it was the best darn bbq I've ever had!

The ring-o-seasonings around the brisket penetrated and tenderized the beef leaving it smokey, salty and beautifully flavored. \\n\\nAs for the sides, I think the Fox Bros need to rethink calling them that, because these \\"sides\\" could easily stand on their own.

On the contrary, I enjoyed every bite of it, the seasoning was perfect! \\n\\nThe waffles were astounding!

We live only a few blocks away from the location. \\n\\nThe place was very nice, with whitewashed wood flooring and accents and great window seating. The overall ambiance was both welcoming and thoughtful. \\n\\nWe ordered the brick toast dessert and shared it among us. It was a generous size, and enjoyable. Nothing remarkable or unusual about it - basically a cross between a strawberry shortcake and an ice cream sundae.\\n\\nWe asked for some water (it was 95F outside) and were pointed to styrofoam cups and a pitcher of ice water. The ice was a nice touch, but the tiny and environmentally-unfriendly styrofoam cups were rather appalling. It's hard to believe in this day and age - and especially in our eco-friendly Pacific NW - that styrofoam be used. But I was thirsty, and I bit the bullet and poured four ice waters in dainty styrofoam cups.\\n\\nThen we walked over to the table, and I admired the woodwork. When I put my finger on what I thought was a knot hole, it turned out to be a puddle of dried chocolate syrup that was left uncleaned. I then noticed the table itself was dirty, along with the four tall chairs, and asked the young lady behind the counter for something to clean up the mess. She obliged and indicated she will clean it up, which she did. Without any acknowledgment nor apologies. This was somewhat stunning to me.\\n\\nThe parking lot was also a bit of a cluster. Why are there diagonal spaces when there are two points of exit/entry? Make them straight-aligned spaces so that vehicles pulling in or exiting from either side of the small parking lot don't have to contort their vehicles to fit into the parking spaces. As we were sitting there enjoying our dessert, I noticed several folks trying to park there with quite a bit of struggle. It probably didn't help that the vehicles were medium to large SUVs. It was like watching a reality show on people parking big vehicles in ill-conceived parking spaces.\\n\\nThe entire experience was underwhelming. The staff was polite, but rather oblivious to their obligation of cleaning tables after customers leave. During our stay I noticed two other tables that were not cleaned up after the respective patrons left. It's a small venue of less than a dozen small tables, and there is really no excuse not to be on top of such obvious matters.\\n\\nThis was our first time there, and I plan on stopping by again to see if my previous visit was a gross aberration or the norm at Mo Cha Tea House.

If it's a popular artist you're planning to see, I recommend getting here pretty early as the line gets long and wraps around the building.

Their menu changes up frequently but one thing is for sure-everything here is amazing.\\n\\nTheir plates are small and meant to be shared. This is great for eating purposes-abit heavy on the wallet but the food and service here is truly worth it.\\n\\nOf note was the charred broccoli that elicited a highly positive response even from my broccoli averse BF. I love that places in the states have picked up on pork belly as a trend and A&H's version is perfect. Crispy skin, tender meat and fat. You might have to flip it over to cut through it though.\\n\\nTheir brunch menu is the most original I have seen in the Boston area. No eggs benedict here (although if you'd like poached eggs, the Smoked Pig Tail comes with one...).  All of their dishes here are fantastic but in particular I'd recommend the pickled corn pancakes and the wild mushroom frittata that had me asking for more!\\n\\nYou can't go wrong here but...it may be tricky if you're vegetarian since many of their dishes incorporate animal fats."},{"name":"La Moule","address":"2500 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My boyfriend and I showed up around 8pm for dinner. It wasn't packed, but it was busy. On a warm evening, there were people seated outside and on the inside there were two rooms with seating. The side with the bar was probably a little too darkly lit, but the lights illuminating the bottles at the bar made the whole space sparkle. \\n\\nWe ordered two different whiskey drinks and they were delicious. I also got the Bamboo Noir which for it's small size packed a punch. We had chose our dishes, but when I asked the waitress for recommendations she suggested an even better combo. We followed her recommendation with the au saffron moule bowl and the steak and frites to share. It was plenty of food for two people and as the waitress had said, the fries were delicious when dipped into the mussel broth. All of the flavors melted deliciously over my tongue and the steak was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nThis is really an awesome place to go!"},{"name":"Mario's Restaurant","address":"347 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"We went in on a Saturday for a post graduation meal.

Had a group of 9 people and maybe because we were the only big group waiting at that time so we got luck out for a shorter wait, 15mins :)))  \\n\\nI do recommend to bring a group, 6 is a good size.  Why?  Come on! So you can try more food and easier for restaurant like this to accommodate and most likely the group don't need to get split up.   \\n\\nMY FAVORITES:\\n\\nRib eye!   It's a taste bud enhancer!  I got medium rare and it came out perfect!   You can taste the char and the oily bone marrow in one bite!  I never had bone marrow over steak and this ultimately gives a different satisfaction and over quilty feeling but it's all worth it, LOL.  I would share this dish with another person so you can try the next one.\\n\\nFried Chicken Pork Belly!   It's an appetizer portion so perfect to share a few other on the list.  The chicken looks dry but oh boy!  it's an extremely moist meat.  Imagine eating chicken and pork belly at the same time.  This is the taste!  you don't see the pork belly meat, but you can taste it when you bite into the fried chicken.   Take a piece of chicken, topped it with a little bit of the green tomato jam and some roasted corn bread, now put the whole thing in your mouth!  Your taste bud will give your mouth a wow satisfaction. \\n\\nBrisket!   Share that too!   it's a big portion.  I can't explain enough about the dishes here.

Major recommendation!\\n\\nFor salads, I recommend the Caesar Salad. I got a pizza, which is hard because I don't eat cheese. That being said, I'm not the best person to judge; however, I didn't love the crust. Portion sizes are good though.\\n\\nThe feel in Sonsie is quite romantic and intimate.

Some of my favorite people are elderly. I can't think of any at the moment, but that's beside the point! That said, for some reason, it's usually a bad sign when you're at a restaurant and most of the tables around you are filled with older people. I always find myself hoping that maybe they are here because this place has history and it means something to them. Unfortunately, this never seems to be the case. They always seem to be there because their tastebuds died sometime around the time Matlock was still a relavant TV show.\\n\\nI had the \\"Dungeness Crab Leg Saute\\" which was described to me by our waitress as, \\"The Cadillac of crab dishes\\". I don't particularly care for Cadillacs, but I think I knew what she was trying to say and I was pretty excited! This $45.99 plate of perfection was going to blow the nips right off of my chest! I am profoundly sorry to inform everyone that my nips are still intact and there wasn't even a slight movement. It was remarkably bland and extremely disappointing. It was served with a dome of plain white rice and stalks of asparagaus with julienned carrots over the top. I think they might have been boiled briefly in water. Perhaps this dish was good a decade or 2 ago, but for the price, it just doesn't make sense in my opinion. Avoid at all costs.\\n\\nMy wife, being from Louisiana, had the \\"Cajun Chicken and Shrimp Fettuccini\\" which, for $24.50, was fine. Maybe we are biased, due to our exposure to Cajun food, but this isn't anything special. It was around a 5/10. The dish was a little bland and greasy, which seemed like a problem with execution more than anything else.\\n\\nThe drinks were good, the service was great! The manager was also kind enough to stop by and, after asking how our food was, didn't charge us for the crab dish I barely touched.\\n\\nAll joking aside, the reason we go out is to enjoy good food.

You can barely get a combo at a price like that anywhere else in the city!\\n\\nFirst, the pulled pork sandwich is delicious. The portion of meat on the bun is substantial and generous for the price. The meat is high quality, but less chunky than many other places. It's more finely chopped and shredded. It's got a bit of a Brunswick stew flavor which actually works very well for it. I am a sauce girl, and it needed no extra sauce. I would actually advise eating it immediately so prevent the bun from becoming soggy or falling apart. A+ pulled pork sandwich. Maybe not the fanciest I've ever had, but it reminds me of the sandwiches I can get back home, near Savannah. Very classic, simple, and tasty Georgia barbecue.\\n\\nI will be back (probably several times per month). My husband and I have been pinching pennies as of late to save for a house, and I was thrilled to find that we could eat here for less than the price of a couple of coffees at Starbucks.

However i was confuaed by this EXTREMELY small place. First the furniture is old rikety wobbely junk. Tables are cover with pick nik themed plastic tablecloths. Soda is given to you with a can which I didnt think was acceptable for a place where they charge $20.00+ per dish. I called ahead to see how busy and was told not to come until a half hour later because they were so busy. Yet we were already close and walked by to see only 4 tables were taken! Far from busy...this probably has to do with how crazy slow the one waitress is. The coffee/rinse sink/dirty rag and cleaser station is right out in the dining area with you, above these itams are some delapitated cabinets from the early 70's or earlier. (particle board ) Ok so the food as I said is over priced. I had bolognese that was not saucy but rather ribbon noodles with a ground meat mixture which I think was orignially in a pink sauce. No taste at all to this. Husband had this \\"famous chicken parm/eggplant Ursala. They pounded the living daylights out of the chicken so it was paper thin. My guess is to stretch the meat cost. The sauce on it was watery as the pictures posted ahows and funniest part was getting a teacup saucer plate of penne to go with it.  Brings to mind a sub shop...chick parm not on a pasta?? Iam Italiam, I had hoped to have a good authentic Italian meal made for ME for once but this place was not good on any level. Oh, and expect a \\"surprise\\"salad that they never tell you is coming. Seems as if the waitress enjoys just trotting over to your table and plopping it down then announcing \\"Ohhh this comes with every dish\\". As she'd done this to two other tables. Be warned the vinagarrette used is very sour. Again they are nice,but I guessing this place was once a gem and theyve not updated and have made cut backs on things they shouldnt have. Grandma Ursala is roaming around doing far too much in her golden years IMO. Worst 70.00 ever spent! STAY AWAY do yourself the favor. Food is close to disgusting.
