I got the vegan Chicago dog and it was good. I've had better vegan hot dogs, but I think they use a non soy based one so it was only meh, but I appreciate the effort. The toppings were awesome and redeemed the whole hot dog. My husband had two meaty concoctions, one from the extensive menu and the other he chose topping himself, including full size onion rings. He LOVED it and they had good beer selections so it was overall a great experience. I would also say it was good for a plant based diet as there are a lot of topping options.

Right when you walk in the door, it is very apparent that whoever decorated the shop took a lot of time and effort to do so. It is cute and offers a lot of space to hang out and enjoy the food. We ordered the savory mini crepes, the banh mi jambon, and the salad rolls with Vietnamese coffee and the French earl grey for drinks.  The savory mini crepes were our favorite part of the meal. The center was soft while the outside was perfectly crisped. The filling consisted of shrimp, pork, and fried onion. The fish sauce was also very food and wasn't too overwhelming. The banh mi jambon was only missing the bate which honestly does take away from its overall taste.  Without the usual bate, it seemed like your common banh mi.  I must say the bread was baked to perfection, the outside had just the right amount of crisp although my boyfriend felt it was more on the toasted side. The banh mi was also a little small in comparison to other places. The pickled carrots and daikon were cut very thinly, which we don't prefer because it takes away the crunch which adds texture to the bahn mi. Salad rolls are probably one of the easiest things to make but the sauce is always the deciding factor for me. I thought the sauce was good but it was missing some spice. The rolls were filled with the usual lettuce and bean sprouts along with shrimp and pork.  Overall, we had a very enjoyable experience. The atmosphere was very welcoming and every corner of the shop was aesthetically pleasing. The plating for the food was also done very well. I especially loved the way they plated the savory mini crepes on the wooden board.

However, this server's attitude was blatantly sour. My mom cracked a few jokes to lighten the mood and he barely responded at all. She asked for the specials and he said, \\"they're on the sheet\\" and tossed her the menu. In addition, she ordered a martini and it was clearly watered down. All of us at the table tasted it because we never return drinks. However, she decided to ask if he could have the bartender make another, and instead he brought over another shot of vodka AND charged us extra for it. For a place like this, we were disappointed. Even lower end restaurants would have at least made her one more drink before charging anything extra. The service industry sucks (I know), but you can't treat people like that. Aside from the service, the food was decent. The mussels were absolutely fantastic. We were bummed overall at our first experience but will be giving it another shot."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

They come out in they line to talk to you including the owner. They give you a heads up on when you will eat and out time was spot on.

The brisket OMG there is a reason this place is sold out daily. The pork ribs were amazing! The pulled pork was 3rd! The turkey was good but seemed dry. And I'm not big on sausage and this didn't seem to change my mind. The beans were great and so was the potato salad.

Of course, I called to talk to a manager but for the 20 + minutes of being placed on hold (4 times), there was no one to complain or talk to.

For the vegetarian diner, there was the option to get the savory bread pudding without ham.  Bread pudding came with hollandaise  sauce.  Very good and filling.  They do serve the food on metal baking sheets, that can tend to suck the heat away from your entree, leaving it cold if you're a slow eater.\\nLots of lovely desserts set out on the counter.  Prices ranging from $3-6 per item.  We got the salted caramel cookie bar for $3 and it was large enough to split between the two of us.  The chocolate stout cake with peanut butter frosting and bacon crumbles was tempting for $6, but we didn't have enough room for such a large piece of cake.  Maybe next time we'll go back just to pick up a dessert.\\nPrices are reasonable for the quality of the food.  16 oz. hot coffee was $1.75.\\nProprietors were super nice - we were the only ones in there first thing in the morning and they took the time to explain the whole menu to us. \\nI can see seating being an issue if the place gets busy.

We both got French Onion Soup and I could taste bits of raw onions that were not simmered in it. Totally unappetizing.

The cocktails are interesting and priced within competition for other restaurants (I always think cocktails are a little pricey so..) at $10-$12 each. The menu changes frequently and is on the upscale side. I wasn't very hungry so I ordered a cup of the She-Crab soup ($6) and the Georgia Peach salad ($11). The crab soup was AMAZING. I was almost licking the cup so good. I wish I had gotten the bowl! The salad on the other hand... I was not a fan. It was probably my mistake in that I thought this was an actual salad when in reality its a wheatberry dish with a little bit of arugula. I wasn't the biggest fan.

Oh, and I hear there normal burgers are good also :)On the menu is also a wide selection of pasta, mexican (burittos), and traditional grille (salmon, chicken, etc).  I don't think i've ever tried the mexican entres, but I do remember that the pasta, while tasty, had too much sauce going on.  All the portions are more than generous, however if you are feeling like an Entree, I recomend the Tofu Bufallo Wings or the Yuppie Nachos.  The Tofu Wings are delicious, with the tangy sauce right on.  The Yuppie Nachos are nachos and (goats) cheese with sun dried tomatoes, avocados, and other, well, yuppie toppings thrown on.The Ambiance is lovely, ask to sit by the fire.

A few minutes later, my drink arrived. It was love at first sip.

One was enough to put me in a very happy place. Next time I'm bringing a designated driver! Also got an order of chips and guacamole. Super fresh and nicely seasoned guac with fresh & hot chips.

However... I was so incredibly surprised how amazing this place is!First, the bad: there is beer, but not too crazy of a selection. And only one cider. And it comes in a can. Sigh...OK, now the good... and there is a lot of good here! The most shocking and pleasing thing besides the food was the off-street parking. I repeat: FREE OFF-STREET PARKING. In Fenway, that is absolutely unheard of! We parked at a meter, figuring that was our only option, and as we approached and saw the nearly-empty lot, we were noticeably shocked.Next, the food. I ordered my gorgonzola burger with bacon bun-less, fearful that I'd be kicked out for doing so; however, if you are anti-grains or gluten-free, they're 100% cool with it and call it a \\"wrap\\". Another awesome thing about the burger is that they're not scared of making it pink in the middle. Though I like medium-rare burgers, having a fast-food-esque burger made medium is close enough and MUCH better than the well-done hockey pucks at other joints.I was hesitant to order cheese fries because I figured they would be the usual flash-frozen fries with the neon orange goop pumped on top. However, I was shocked to see that the cheese sauce they use definitely has a roux base - that means MADE FROM SCRATCH, folks! (If I'm wrong about this, I'll kiss the person that proves me wrong. I'm THAT certain.) The other folks in our group ordered the 50/50 fries and onion rings. I am not a huge onion fan and dislike most onion rings, but Tasty Burgers' are more like thin, crispy, heavenly onion straws... and they're amazing.Just based on the food and beer, Tasty Burger is a four-star place; but with off-street parking, it just put the whole experience over the top.

On Mondays, Cypress has a $5 half philly with fries. Sounded good since I wasn't really hungry so I ordered that and so did my friends. It was a lot bigger than any of us expected and I couldn't finish mines. The fries were handcut and really good. The Philly was good as well.Mmmmmmm dessert. They feature sublime doughnuts and since I have yet to make it there I decided to order one here. They had a glazed sublime doughnut with ice cream and my friend ordered the apple fritter with ice cream.

Let's push the envelope and hope that there isn't a line at 10am... What the heck? We only live once, why not push the envelope?\\nAs we walked up to the corner establishment, there were approx 15people ahead of us.  Doesn't anyone work at 10am on a Monday morning... or is this place worth playing hooky?  \\nI will have to admit... it just might be worth playing hooky.The atmosphere is upbeat, the host is on his game, maneuvering guests and tables without missing a beat.  It was actually a pleasure to wait, as I was able to observe just how smoothly and efficiently everyone worked together to ensure each and every customer got the absolute best for their buck. We are a soup to nuts kind of a family... so we just have to try a bit of everything.  \\nWe started off with the hush puppies, swimming in a wonderful syrup.  This would tide us over until our ginormous meals arrived.  We planned on this being our only meal of the day, so please don't judge. I had the Chicken and Waffles, still not sure why I thought it was a good idea to have two pieces of fried chicken at 10 am... but I did and I enjoyed every bite.  The chicken was battered with a delicious hint of black pepper.  Crispy and tender.  Piping hot on top of my wonderful waffle that somehow got lost during my adoration for my chicken. My husband had the Louisiana Red Hot Link Po Boy.... and OMG.... I was hoping we would go 50/50 on this.  It was hands down, the best plate at the table.  Spicy, tasty, and delicious to the very last bite.  Not for the weak of heart, it's got a kick, it's filling, it's fattening, and it's oH SO WORTH IT. Yum Yum Yum.  Side dish of cheddar grits to accompany, and I would have been happy with that alone.  Rich and flavorful.  My son inhaled his Praline Bacon Waffle, I'm not sure how to describe it other than it was gone in less than 5 minutes.  No shares, I'm afraid.  However, he tells me that it was the most delicious breakfast item he has ever tasted.  I'd take his word for it, he's a foodie in his own right. Lastly, my daughter had the Spiced Apple Rhubarb Biscuit.  The biscuit was light, the apple rhubarb was a perfect blend of sweet and tart, and it was topped with a delicious vanilla whipped cream.  I'm more of a savory person, but that alongside my fried chicken paired well.  The vibe in this place is nothing but positive.  Every employee seems to truly enjoy their role in the success of The Screen Door, and it shows.  This establishment is well worth the wait, even if you are rushing to get to PDX.

Once we were seated, we placed our orders for drinks and food very quickly. After ordering, our waitor essentially vanished. He also walked around to every table in his section to refill their water twice and just didn't even glance at our table, all with empty waters. We had to ask for more water several times and we also had to ask him to bring out the bread. Once our food finally came after a 30-45 minute wait, it was all cold and one person in our party with a gluten allergy had home fries on his plate, which he had asked to have left off (since they use the frier for bread products as well he can't eat them), when he corrected them, they just took the place in the back and brushed off the home fries, which was obviously because of the crumbs left on the plate...not a way to handle a food allergy. I have been to Masa before and enjoyed their food, but after the mediocre food and the service, I don't plan to go back anytime soon.

The price at first seems a bit steep for tickets, but once you've taken in a full meal (soup/salad, drinks, entree, dessert) and a pre-show, show, and afterparty complete with photo opps with the actors and dancing, you'll appreciate just how much goes into the entire experience.  The pre-show essentially sets the stage for the events of the main show, and keeps the audience entertained while waiting for things to begin.  Appetizers are even served while watching and waiting, or perusing the small stores around the \\"foyer\\".  The main show is pretty good, consisting of a neat story, several small-scale pyrotechnics, fight scenes, a few comedic actors/scenarios, and impressive acrobatics - all while you enjoy a very tasty meal with surprisingly filling portions.  The show is also largely interactive, with quite a number of audience members (kids and teens mostly) joining in to do such things as take the pirate's oath, and raising the sails on the ship.  And of course the auditorium is segmented by color so that you can root for your color's pirate representative at all times during the show, with as much screaming as possible. :)  The wait staff (wenches - lol) work extremely hard to keep things as seemless as possible, while being incredibly-attentive to the needs of parents that need a drink at this point during the day/evening's festivities. (lol)The after-party basically consists of party music playing while the teens goof off and dance around, parents shop with their kids for pirate gear, and everyone else takes advantage of photo opps with the actors.  This was the point at which I became the most impressed with the Pirates Dinner Adventure.  I've never seen performers so sincerely thankful and appreciative of those attending their show before this.  Although I'm more than certain they were all extremely tired from their respective performances, they still found the time to say thanks OVER and OVER again, and take pictures that showed actual real enjoyment for what they do.  Absolutely impressive!  I'd definitely go back just to support their efforts, and probably will next time we're in Orlando.So, verdict: pricey? - yes; entertaining? - yep; worth the time and money? - definitely; will your kids enjoy it? - judging from the screams and how many new pirates walked out of the place, I'd say that's a safe \\"certainly\\".

Get outta here El Jefe's, you ain't no boss of nuthin'.And you particularly, all the way to Mexican hell and back, do not appreciate Boloco. You're wooden tabled, houtsauce-slewin', sombrero hangin' Mexican. You look over at this goofball offering the likes of buffalo chicken burritos or mango smoothies and you just wanna throw up. How many burrito joints do we need, and how inauthentic can a burrito get? You swear Boloco's is so unmexican it'd prefer the winters to be twice as long.But you're not worried cuz students love you. You don't give em reservations. You force them to wait thill their whole party is there. You make em wait 45 minutes with a crowded bar and 2 feet of personal space to fill the time and they STILL KEEP coming back. The HUDS strike didn't even bump your clientele at all because you were already always fully filled every night. You ate Harvard kids like Harvard kids ate guac.

We grabbed a table by the window and our server Scott was a delight.We started with the oysters (because it's summer in New England) and moved on to the crispy duck wings, green bean salad, and mussels. Everything was fantastic but I have to say, the duck wings were by far one of the best things I've eaten. They were perfectly cooked and we probably could've ordered at least two more orders.

I'm surprised to see such positive feedback.I am a big fan of Mexican food and was anxious to try the new place in town. Unfortunately, the whole experience of Jalapenos is mediocre at best.It is definitely pricey compared to other local Mexican fare, but they are going for that higher end sit-down dinner market (like Zaccolo did so well) so that's fine. Unfortunately the food doesn't really warrant the price.Pretty much everything was bland and underwhelming, from the apps to the entrees and sides.The service was good, but I think the atmosphere was pretty bland as well. I agree that it is very clean and bright, and that's great, but I would expect a bit more of a festive decor. Instead it feels  more like an empty pale yellow dining hall.If you're looking for some Mexican take-out, Anna's is a much better choice. If you want a great sit-down meal with great atmosphere to match, you can't beat The Border Cafe.

On 12/17/17 we invited some friends from out of town to join us at Dang's for \\"good thai food\\". Upon arriving, i waited a few minutes for someone to show up from inside the kitchen to seat us. We were not greeted graciously as in past times, when i mentioned that it was a party of 4 adults and 5 kids under 5, the hostess seemed a bit irritated as she walked off to set up the table. Our order was taken eventually and we requested a split bill. Our food arrived one entree at a time and spaced apart by minutes (we found this odd since there were other employees occupying an empty table in the dining area and you would think that they had enough employees who could bring out all the entrees out at or around the same time). The soup that my wife ordered required a an additional amount of cilantro and we attempted to flag down our waitress a few times without any luck. Our beverages were not refilled and we were not asked if we wanted a refill. We eventually got a \\"how was everything\\" after we were done with our meal....At this point we had to leave and requested our check. The split check never arrived as \\"split\\", they added incorrect items on the one check that was given to us. The cherry on top of this horrible dining experience was the mandatory gratuity for parties of 6 or larger. When i asked how little kids ( two 3 year olds, one five year old, and two infants) are considered as being part of a party of 6 or larger, i was given a cold and non conforming answer of \\"thats how it is, we need to give them seats and water too\\". I notified the waitress that we never got refills, our food arrived late and not together, and we did not receive proper customer service. Not once was i apologized too, treated as a paying customer, treated with respect, treated as though repeat business was a priority, etc etc. I had no problem paying the tip even though treating infants as paying customers doesn't make sense to me. However i firmly believe that any person providing a service and who expects a tip, needs to earn that \\"tip\\". \\nIf you, the owner of this establishment are reading this, you have lost a loyal repeat customer due to employees that lack brain matter between their ears in regards to how to treat customers. I was very offended and your hostess up front, that closed our check out, was able to get me from frustrated to outright pissed off by the time i walked out. I will go out of my way to give my money to any another \\"thai food\\" establishment vs ever returning to yours. \\nTo anyone that reads this, the food here is good, not great, the service was okay the previous times we dined here, this last time was horrible..the one time we brought guests with us.

I got the veggie burger with cheez, and It was good. Really, not bad, but nothing I'm writing my mom about. I thought the sauce really made the burger, which isn't exactly a rave. I didn't think It was a good value for what was charged. The fries were awesome (even though I chickened out of trying the Black-n-white fries covered in the mysterious squid ink)!

And remember folks, the cost of living in Tokyo is many, MANY times that of of Austin.  So, unless Tatsu-Ya's noodles are infused with gold and the pigs they use produce Wagyu-like pork, there is absolutely no reason for the ridiculous menu prices!)Or, maybe it was the fact that it was so damn hot inside, I was about to strip naked and eat my overly salted tonkatsu ramen buck-naked...\\n(Again, hard to explain the ridiculous prices when you're cutting out A/C from your budget, right Tatsu-Ya?)... but, the overall Tatsu-Ya experience was extremely underwhelming.

The sides are pretty dope too, fox-aroni is a house classic you must try and the frito pie is just fun to eat, kind of just tastes like wet Fritos and chili but it's fun to eat I guess. if you are gonna try \\" Atlanta BBQ \\" this is the spot, the only place in ATL that has some originality and can help you achieve meat coma satisfaction.

I should mention this is the most expensive item on the menu. I had mentioned at the last several times I came in, and inevitably the vegetables are charred on the outside and raw on the inside. So today I went in and asked to substitute a side of vegetables (which is always very good and only cost a few dollars on the menu) for the skewer of vegetables, and the kitchen said no. I asked to speak to a manager and he said that his boss was also present and that the answer was no. The border Caf√© is always busy and benefit from its proximity to Harvard - clearly they can afford to not give a crap about an individual customer's legitimate complaint (the manager acknowledge my legitimate complaint but said he couldn't do anything).

Just had it this past weekend, and it was pretty amazing - I'd say on par with Craigie's, depending on your mood. Fried cheese is surprisingly an outstanding addition, and that patty must have a healthy helping of short rib. Wish the chips on the side were fries, but that feels nitpicky in light of the awesomeness burger. I had been before, which was more of a 3.5 star experience. Some stuff was great, like the octopus and pork belly, others were fine, like the \\"snacks,\\" and one, the squid ink pasta, was a total miss - and I love squid ink pasta.

I have passed this place at 8PM at night, and the line is past the post office next door. The restaurant itself is very small, so word to the wise - go at an off-peak time if you don't have the time or patience to wait! I did notice the greeter would not sit incomplete parties, so take note. I sat at the bar, and the bartender was constantly asking if people needed anything else. The gyoza ($4) were not very good, and that is why I give three stars. The texture of the pork seemed odd compared to all other pot stickers I have made or tried. The color of the pork was very pale and tasteless. In addition, the gyoza, although you get six of them, were very small. I would suggest skipping the gyoza altogether.If I was judging based on the ramen alone, I would have given four stars. I ordered the mi-so-not ramen noodle soup ($9). The broth was delicious! The noodles were the right consistency, the egg was probably my favorite (yolk semi-cooked in true Japanese fashion), and the pork was just right. The flavors melded together beautifully, and I can see why people stand in long lines. It is very uncommon to find a strict, Japanese noodle shop. It's common to find a Japanese restaurant with sushi, fish entrees, soba, udon, etc., but I am very glad I found this place. For the two items I ordered, the total was $14.07 including tax, which isn't bad for dinner.

Entrees mostly are in the $14 - $23 range; considering the fact that they come with a soup or salad and a lot of those options are seafood, you can really appreciate the reasonable price. Most recently I had the Hazelnut Chicken and Pear Brandy Sauce, and I would recommend it. The alcoholic beverages are a bit pricey. I did try a sip of my sister's Peach Tea-Tini and I really liked it. The restaurant is small. Very small. (Cozy!) Just like their parking lot. They allow you to call ahead, but no reservations. I keep lucking out by parking in their main lot, but they do have overflow parking across the street at the Jewish Community Center if you can't find a space. Part of their restaurant seating is a covered patio, but they have some outdoor heaters, so it is actually pretty comfortable out there.

I like the shawarmas at Rami's just a little bit better for the following reasons:First- I believe it's turkey meat that is rotating on the upright spit. Secondly- They put it in a pita instead of a roll up which allows for more food to be stuffed in. Thirdly- They include hommous and different pickled veggies from the ones used at Shawarma King's, and they use purple cabbage which gives a good texture with the sauce. Fourth- I don't believe they use onions in their shawarma which Shawarma King does, or maybe its parsley that Shawarma King uses and Rami's doesn't, or maybe neither of them use onions or parsley, but something taste like onions and parsley at Shawarma King that doesn't at Rami's. That's really about it. You have to be careful when eating their shawarma because they kind of fall apart sometimes and drip sauce and meat juice toward the end. I suggest not over doing it with the hot sauce even though it is good as it will easily over power the rest of the flavors that are worth tasting.If you get your meal to eat in for some reason they put it in this funny hard plastic reusable basket that is a little awkward, I wish they'd just give me a plate. But I never feel comfortable asking since guys who work there never seem friendly in the least, but that could be unfair of me to say because they speak with accents that throw me off context wise.  I also have no idea if they really use turkey meat (sometimes their meat has grissel in it, i'm not sure if turkeys contain grissel). That could just be something I thought they told me when I asked for a lamb shawarma while wasted, which brings me to the reasons I dislike Rami's:First- It's family orientated. That's annoying; I don't want to acknowledge that people under 20 and over 30 even exist in this world until I accidentally have a child of my own.Second- It's religiously orientated. How a god who doesn't exist manages to keep me from getting the specialty food that I covet on a Saturday is an A&E Mysteries of the Bible special that I'd pay to have Leonard Nimoy narrate so I could listen to it while walking the extra half mile to Shawarma King. Third- Rami's is expensive. It's probably because Brookline is an upscale neighborhood where people walk dogs and don't throw their cigarette butts on the ground. I assume its Kosher and that means its preventing them from putting cheese on it and creating the Philly-cheese-shawarma-bomb which might let them do enough volume in sales to subsidize the price per unit to be a little more affordable while fulfilling my cheesy fantasies."},{"name":"Moonshine 152","address":"152 Dorchester Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Once again, Southie comes through with some innovative, fun food!

When i've had it, the broth was a lot more \\"clean\\" tasting, if that makes sense. This broth was very overpowering and didn't let the noodles and toppings shine as much as they should have.I should have been paying more attention, too: the portions are HUGE. My husband and I could have easily shared one order and gone home really full. We asked for to go containers and our waitress told us they discouraged that because the noodles' texture wouldn't be as good in even just a few hours. Yeah...but I hate to throw food away! I totally get where they're coming from. They were different the next day but they were still good. We brought home the kids' leftovers, too. At no point did they ever get soggy and mushy---a testament to their noodle making expertise! Now we know better and if we go again, we'll share.Drinks are bottled (no soda fountain refills) but they have a generous variety. The atmosphere was good though crowded, and everything was clean.

Yes, we pulled up a chair and got in line at 7:45 am on a Wednesday, about 20 people in front of us and we were eating by 11:30am. It's a long wait if you have that attitude, but you to think of it as an experience, it's fun! Get to know the people you're sitting around, if you're shy, it's BYOB... so you can loosen up a bit! The staff is fantastic and has everything under control while wearing smiles on their faces. A staff member came through the line around 9am to take a tally on what people were interested in having to make sure they had enough for everyone in line. When we got to the counter, the guy behind the counter was super friendly. He small talked with us about our Texas road trip and didn't slow down one bit. We ordered 2lbs of brisket to go (which they wrap for you) 1lb to eat there, 1/4 lb ribs and 1/4 pulled pork. Based on reviews, we also got the Bourbon banana pie, so worth it! I'm sure going to miss Franklin BBQ, it's no surprise it's rated the best in the country! Good thing we still have a couple of pounds to take with us when we leave Austin!"},{"name":"Fox Bros.

I had actually come here fully planning on having their eggs benedict (as I've heard really good things about them), but changed my mind.  I plan on returning to try the eggs benedict, but next time I will be sure to ask for the prix-fix menu and save a few bucks.  Also, the molasses butter for the cornbread is amazing.

We were pre-warned about the wait time and neither of us had been there before. We waited 45 min - hour in line before we were in the door and had to wait a short time after that to reach the counter. The place is tiny - there were a few tables to seat two around the perimeter, one large communal table, and then seats at the bar. You order your meal at a counter that has the menu behind it, prior to getting to the area to order, the drinks that are offered are located to your right with prices - this was a plus since we were asked what we wanted to drink prior to getting to the counter to order and we were able to drink while waiting.We were offered a table or a seat at the bar while in line, initially, we chose a table - there were a few open. The hostess saw a couple jump to a table they hadn't been told they could sit at, and she had to sort of corral them back to the spot they were originally given. She came back to us and apologized, and explained that she had some sort of mix up and our only seating option was at the bar - no biggie - she just had to corral the two people sitting at the bar further down so we could sit together. After we ordered, it took all of about 5 minutes to get our food. I chose the #1 Tonkotsu Original my friend ordered the special. I have never had \\"authentic\\" ramen before. My meal was larger than I expected. The broth was pretty good, albeit, pretty salty, but I rarely eat food containing salt, so I think it's a \\"it's not you, it's me\\" situation; the pork belly was in tiny slivers, but it was a semi-reasonable amount and not amazing, but not bad; and there was a decent amount of noodles, which tasted, looked like, and had the consistency of angel hair. I was full before I was even halfway done due to how rich everything was. For my two beers and my ramen, I think I paid around $15 before the tip, which is pretty cheap.  Unfortunately, their take-home boxes (for the ramen - it was a Styrofoam cylinder with plastic wrap at the top and a rubber band - no lid) seemed like they would cause spillage in the car, and the food (although good) was not worth the risk, so I didn't even bother. Ordering a second beer was slightly difficult since there were no waiters and the people behind the counter seemed immensely busy. We eventually got their attention, though it was so loud, they grabbed me the wrong beer - not an issue and they were very polite. The line to get to the counter was directly to my left, so I had people watching me eat, staring into my bowl, and talking about the food I had the entire time - all about a foot or less than a foot (when they leaned in) away from me and my food. I felt like I was on display, which made me very uncomfortable - and I don't like people leaning in close to see what I am eating. After my friend had finished and I was still drinking my second beer and I was still nibbling on my meal, the staff kept coming over, asking if we were done, and trying to take my bowl. We would notice them staring at us, coming over and looking across the bar at our bowls, and my beer, looking pretty impatient. We hadn't even been there for too long and it looked like people were still being seated, we weren't holding up business. We chose to ignore them. Part of going to a restaurant with a friend is to sit, relax, and have conversation while eating and drinking what you paid for right? You don't want to be rushed if you already had to stand for 45+ minutes. That seems like a no-brainer. All in all, the Ramen was good, worth the wait, but not worth the possibility of spilling in the car if you choose to take it home - the food alone, I would give about a 4. The atmosphere, however, the feeling of being rushed, and getting gawked at by hungry patrons and impatient staff, was not something I was too thrilled about. The staff were actually very polite, until we sat there longer than I guess they expected, but honestly, they can shove it, I was still eating and drinking the food and beer I paid for and relaxing after standing forever in line just to get in.  I would probably go back if a friend really wanted to go, but I wouldn't initiate."},{"name":"Hei La Moon","address":"88 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Probably one of the best Dim Sum places in Chinatown.

Most of what I had was good, others were so so, and some was great.  Its Midtown restaurant week, so i took the opportunity to sample some of their most popular menu items for $25.  I love that deal!Starter: She-Crab Soup.  To be honest, a little disappointing.  Not a lot of flavor, and too much cream.  Main: Meatloaf w/ mashed potatoes, cauliflower, and spinach.  The meatloaf was pretty good, but the cauliflower and spinach side was AMAZING!.  I could have eaten a whole plate of just that.  Very buttery and interestingly seasoned.  They made me involuntarily close my eyes when eating them.Dessert: White Chocolate Cheesecake Bread Pudding.  Mmmmm....Service was good.  Although they messed up our reservation, they quickly opened up another table to accommodate our party of 6.Atmosphere:  Modern Southern.  I like the big glass enclosed porch.  Great opportunities for people watching, between the Jersey Shore D-bags filing into Flip Flops and the Sassed Up Skanks (aka Bachelorette Parties) waiting in line at Opera.  I like that this place serves quality Southern food in an upscale, modern space.  Good place to take a date for Southern food.

The line started at the door, but it didn't take that long to get our orders in and the food in our tummies.  The inside is pretty small and the concept is for you to order at the bar, the waitresses choose seats for you to sit at, and give you a number to put on the table.   There's a long benched table that you share with other people, bar tables, and separate tables and we were assigned to sit at the long benched table.\\nI don't think you get a specific waiter or waitress because every time we needed something it was a different person that serviced us.  While standing in line, they ask you if you want any drinks before you order your meal and if you want just water you have to get it yourselves at the table in the back.  I felt like everything was self served besides the part where they bring your food out.As always, the food that I ordered was shared between 2 people because I like to try everything!  I went with what most yelp reviewers got which is the hi lighted things and they usually work out pretty well for me.\\n--MI-SO-HOT (4/5) Broth was fantastic, I added Chashu because it comes with the ground pork.  The ramen wasn't spicy at all, the egg wasn't marinated like all the other reviews said but overall the ramen was good, flavoring was all there, broth was thick, rich, and I enjoyed it better than I've had at Jinya.  \\n--Gyoza - (2/5) Basic, not missing out on much.  I guess dumplings are just dumplings, no dumplings have surprised me yet, felt like I could have bought these frozen and made it at home myself.\\n--Munchie Katsu Slider - (3.5/5) One of the hi-lights which I thought was alright, the patty was really crispy like they deep fried it, not well seasoned I feel.  The Hawaiian bread is probably what makes most of it.\\n--Sweet & Sour Yodas - (3.5/5) Super strong aroma, and it flares all the way to my nostrils.  They're pretty tasty, but it was too drenched in the vinaigrette sauce.When I am back in town I will come back if I was really craving for ramen, but there are so many other places that are calling out my name to try before I come back again.

I made the fiscally irresponsible decision to get a little of everything from a good many well-rated bbq places.Franklin's was on another level against all the competition!I stood in line for quite some time, maybe 2 hours, and even then i was out the door, down the stairs, in line with the back corner of the building when I arrived. But even the wait was an experience. Everyone was in a great mood and though strangers, everyone chatted over this and that to pass the time. This was a joyous protein trek for all. The sidewalk may as well have been slick with salivation.It was also reassuring that they go down the line and tally everyones' intended order quantities to let those at the back of the line know what they should expect to have run out by the time they get to the front. Thankfully all the important items were in plentiful supply.Then it was time to eat. The meat was out of this world. I tried ribs and brisket (fat and lean). Flavorsome, tender, juicy with rendered fat; I've never had anything like it, anywhere else. I really can't critique it other than to admit that for some tastes such as my wife's she much preferred the leaner end of the brisket as the liquefied fat was too much for her palate and stomach. Fat is flavor though as they say, so this place played well into my proclivities.

Keeping in mind that it's meant to be a fun place for food and friends - not a 5-star venue with impeccable service - know that their pasta dishes, salads, and desserts have been favorites of mine. This is saying a lot as I generally don't like salad or bread pudding - both which I happily order at Sonsie.

I had the seared duck breast, which was cooked exactly perfectly. The sides were equally good. The restaurant is very comfortable, a great contrast to the cold sleek new buildings all around. It seems that maybe it was an older converted house? Seating was broken up so a few tables here, a group over there, plus there's an upstairs. It really lent to an intimate vibe.

This is the perfect place for my husband and I to visit as he loves Cajun/Southern spicy food and I love organic/locally grown/vegetarian options.  We waited until my folks were in town who also love Cajun/Southern food and I am happy that we did as everyone loved their food!  Both my husband and my mom ordered the jambalaya.  The both really loved it, in fact my husband commented several times during the meal how good it was.  He does not do that often so, that automatically places Screen Door high up on my radar.  I did not taste the jambalaya but from what both my mom and husband said it was decently spicy, had a nice smoky flavor to it and the sausage was actually good.  The portions were fairly large, neither of them finished it.  Both my step dad and I ordered the much talked about Screen Door plate which is any three side dishes or any three items from the organics menu along with a piece of corn bread.  My step dad got the catfish, the cucumber salad, and the melon salad.  He enjoyed everything, he did mention that the catfish was quite crispy though but aside from that he did not have any complaints.  I ordered the cucumber salad, the melon salad, and the summer squash salad.  Everything was delicious and the portions were all quite large.  I couldn't finish everything.  The cucumber salad was light, had a nice sweetness to it, and the ingredients all meshed together well.  It had different kinds of tomatoes, a bit of shredded cheese, and cucumbers of course.  I am not sure what else is in it, the most recent organics menu isn't online yet but it was all fresh, tasty, and quite good.  My step dad enjoyed it, he said it was different than what he was expecting but overall he enjoyed it.  The melon said was completely different than what both my step dad and I were expecting but it was fantastic.  I think I expected the normal chunks or melon balls type deal but this was completely different.  It was slices of both watermelon and another type of melon that had a bit of salt on them.  I wasn't super excited about the sea salt but it did draw out the flavors a bit more which was nice.  I loved the bits of fresh mint that were on the salad, that was my favorite part.  The summer squash salad was one of the more interesting/unique dishes I have had in quite a while.  It was strips of squash, zucchini, and tomatoes in this light cheese sauce.  Now, normally the words light and cheese sauce do not normally go together but somehow they pulled it off.  I am not sure what all of the ingredients are but it was nice...it wasn't thick like some cheese sauces are, this was quite nice, not heavy at all.  I enjoyed it, it was really great.  My husband rarely gives restaurants five stars, so last night when he declared Screen Door five stars I was more than happy to both agree and write the review right away!  Screen Door was really fantastic, I can't wait to go back.  I would especially love to go back and sample to mac and cheese on a day when I wouldn't get a disappointed glance from mom about the amount of calories I was ingesting!  Because we all know, thinking about the fat/calories in mac and cheese ruins it for you, right????"},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is a four star place !

The girl behind the counter was very accommodating and made my pizza(?) to order.

Doner Kebab uses the same familiar Doner method to cook their meat. the key is that the meat is not OVERcooked. it is tender and savory, but because it is cooked \\"just right,\\" it lacks the crispy edges that I am used to. in the future, I may see if it is possible to request the meat a little more well done.the pita was something spectacularly new for me. accustomed to flatter, almost overbaked pitas, I was unprepared for how awesome it is to have one of these sandwiches served in a soft, fluffy-hot, fresh-from-the-oven pita. the other ingredients, also, were fresher and crispier than I was used to. and the spicy yogurt adds some welcome kick to the meat, which seemed otherwise underseasoned. the result is a Doner that feels almost health-conscious. like a 3rd generation butcher who confesses to you in a moment of weakness that he has been a vegetarian lo these long, agonizing years.fans of the Great American Gyro can check this place out for something a little different. fans of greasy, lunch counter Doners, as well. and everyone else should check this place out just because. their menu contains a whole lot more than just this sandwich, and I plan to give the other items my attention in the near future.edit: OH! like traditional Doner places, they're open late. some ridiculous morning hours. the gentleman at the register told me what they were, and I promptly forgot. if you can't find them in some other review here, just call and ask. there is no better time for a kebab than in the wee hours after a night of self-abusive drinking."},{"name":"Bandini Pizza & Pasta","address":"3107 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Great place for cheap and fast delivery in north Portland.

Another 15 minutes pass before our starter arrived WITH our entrees. The server barely responded and offered no recourse when we said we had asked for the Calamari first.

I would even consider going on BOTH Saturday and Sunday in one weekend. The fact that they have a Saturday brunch is reason enough for a first-timer to consider Masa.\\nAt Fiesta Brunch you get a starter, an entree to which you can add meat ( including salmon) or avocado, and bottomless coffee. Oh! You, also, get two different corn breads with three different spreads to snack on before your meal gets there.\\nFor brunch, I recommend the Huevos rancheros (so does the staff) if you're stuck choosing between four great options. I added avocado to mine, and it was great. For a starter, I had the plantain empanada... Which was basically the only option that made sense... To me, a plantain lover.\\nAside from brunch, I did go to Masa for Valentine's Day this year. Service was incredible, the atmosphere was great, and the food was just as good looking as it was tasting. I would rave about the things I had on Valentine's Day (the sea bass was phenomenal), but they had a special menu for the day.

Firstly the gd line is ridiculous. The place is not new, they totally artificially create it to hype it up. The noodles are good, the broth is good, the cha su is good. The people working there are A holes. The guy seating us totally was taken aback by the thought of us having a stroller and basically felt totally put out. He almost threw a fit. Second it's full of the scuzziest aging elitist hipsters Austin has to offer, sorry I offended you with my collard shirt I will get a tattoo sleeve before I go back. Third everyone rushes you out of there, you can't even enjoy your bowl because you are being pressured into getting up and making room for the next person. This isn't bustling Tokyo where commuters are trying to jam into train and scaf there noodle lunch down in 3 min flat, it's Austin. That being said I will probably go back at some point so don't spit in my food. It's passable for authenticity. \\nThe trend for all new restaurants in central is a huge ass line and a 2 hour wait, this place follows suit. The shop is a bit fancy for the strip mall it's in, and priced a bit high. The broth was very porky, however  too much garlic. I'm GF so my wife was doing the eating (I just a spoonful of broth). Ramen is her thing, like a fiend to his dope, like drunkard to his wine, my wife will have lust for the lure of the ramen. RIP Johnny Cash. She liked the broth and ramen, however the char siu was meager, like 1 piece that was half fat... The egg looked amazing and was. As for those with gluten allergies, looks like you will have to drink your dinner in the form of $3 house sake.

We had plans to visit Salt Lick but weren't able to travel because of the hurricane. Stubb's ended up being the closest BBQ joint to our hotel, so it was a no brainer to visit for a bbq fix before we left town.I ordered a brisket sandwich with cole slaw and mac and cheese on the side. The brisket was super juicy and flavorful but was a little too fatty and the bun was a bit soggy. The cole slaw was pretty standard but unfortunately the mac and cheese was lackluster. It was really cold and tasted like frozen mac and cheese. I'd definitely return for some drinks and live music (the concert schedule looked dope). However, for some real authentic Texas BBQ I'd probably venture elsewhere. Hopefully next time I find myself in Austin there is no hurricane and I can do that.

I could probably drink 5 of these if dinner was longer.APPETIZERS\\nSmoked Pork Belly was one of my favorites for the meal. It had a BBQ flavor to it and some sweetness from honey. The collard greens were super strong, but not strong enough to overpower the pork belly. It definitely goes well together and I appreciate the chef combining the two together as it's something I'd never try.The fried green tomatoes were pretty good. They weren't the best I've ever had, and at times, I didn't realize the goat cheese was on the side so I missed that part of it. If you share these appetizers, make sure that you get the goat cheese mixed in!ENTREES\\nAll I remember reading was: \\"My entree was the buttermilk fried chicken and it was the best fried chicken of my life.\\" Unfortunately, the chicken didn't quite meet expectation. The chicken itself was really tender, but the breading was a bit too crumbly for me. I can definitely see how people would enjoy it, though, and it's definitely worth a shot if you've never gotten it.The Pan-Seared Georgia Trout was my absolute favorite. I didn't think I'd come here and put fish on the top of my list, but they did such a good job searing the outside, removing the scales, and complimenting it with some baby bok choy and white carrots. The fish on the inside was tender and the mixture of flavor in your mouth was heavenly.DESSERTS\\nBanana Pudding didn't have anything super special to it. It was good. But I wouldn't be stuffing my face with it if someone put it in front of me.BY FAR, the BEST DESSERT was the signature Pecan Pie with a hint of ice cream on the side. Oh man, I'm not a pecan pie fan but SCK made me a fan of it! It's got a crust that stays together yet mixes well with the pecan in the center. Mix it with the ice cream and your tongue will be dancing.The only other thing I'd mention is the service got a little bit slow at points. Certainly, they did a good job of replacing plates, keeping our drinks filled, but I would have liked a shorter wait in between the main entrees and dessert ordering.

If you've never had real ramen before then this place will surely blow your mind, not to mention your tastebuds. If you've tasted the best of the best however, the ramen itself will simply be okay, and that's what it's really about isn't it, the ramen noodles? Perhaps you'll pardon me for being too passionate about ramen, but truly good ramen has personality. And I either like my ramen bari-kata or silky smooth depending on my mood and choice of broth. And I don't know but I'd say this ramen was cooked up for an American palette. The broth however was rich and delicious as it should be. I went with the Miso-Not, added corn and brussel sprouts (an absolute must). I also tried the Original which was easier to slurp, a simpler soup I would say (I would add the corn bomb which has butter) but still very good.The ramen shops in New York City and LA, where ramen is almost a religion, have spoiled me silly.

However, I took away one star because parking is horrible. They don't really have a big parking lot and once that is full, it's either you have to find street parking (in a really busy area), pay and park at a lot around the restaurant, or wait until someone comes out and gives up there parking space. So parking is a drag. Also, on busy days, ie the weekends (including friday) it gets super busy and the wait times can be up to 2 hours so just be cautious if you're starving and can't wait this might not be the place for you.

I also overheard the guy (the owner I think?) tell someone they don't make their tempeh bacon in house and use a packaged product you can get at any grocery store. Kinda disappointing. The flavor of the burger was good, though, and the fries were GREAT! A little overseasoned perhaps (I am kinda sensitive to salt though) but whatever the seasoning was was delish. The peanut butter shake deserves four and a half stars.... that thing was good.

When I asked where the food was they realized the error. The food came about 6 mins after that. Everything was lukewarm except the fried chicken. Needless to say...the potato salad was bland(this was to replace the collard greens that I hated) ,the collard greens were sweet instead of savory, the mac and cheese had crumbled bbq chips as a topper(gross) and even the corn bread wasn't warm. The one great thing was the Arnold Palmer the iced tea/lemonade ratio was perfect. The most disappointing part of all was that all I recieved for the error/mediocre food was a lousy apology from the other really nice server who was covering for Alyssa. We still gave a 20%tip because Alyssa was good,however not good enough to make me forget the suckiness of everything else. Sidebar:the restaurant was almost empty. I'm afraid to go back at all let alone during a busy time. BTW the two stars are because the chicken was hot, well seasoned, and good portions. The other star is for Alyssa."},{"name":"La Mezcaleria","address":"1622 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"sip don't shootI love it when I go to a restaurant and the servers teach me something new. They do that because they know what they're serving. As Papa GG always said - knowledge is power.La Mezcaleria is using their power responsibly - influencing the masses with their awesome eats and even better shooters. Sorry, they insist you sip mezcal. Course no one in my family sips or nibbles. Mezcal is a spirit distilled from steamed hearts of various species of agaves while tequila is a distilled beverage only made from the blue agave plant.It's a small space so seating is limited and it gets busy. Luckily they take reservations for parties of six or more.It's a cute restaurant, long wood bar in the centre in front of an open kitchen area, hanging plants, and drop dome lights. The service is borderline - our server was strong out of the gate, then fizzled fast. If a trio of mezcal shooters isn't for you, the cocktails are amazing. We got two starters to share. The guacamole is made-to-order and was tastier than the ceviche. The sister and I shared the enchiladas clasicas ($12) and the four meat tacos ($9.50):DE CACHETE (braised beef cheeks)\\nCARNITA (pork confit with pickled red onions)\\nPOLLO CON MOLE (chicken with mole)\\nAL PASTOR (pork marinated in achiote chilli and pineapple)De cachete was the clear winner. It was pass the taco - take a bite, move to the next. I wanted to stop when I got to the beef cheek. So damn good.I did not like dessert. It got lost somewhere between a flan and custard. Good flavours, poor texture.La Mezcaleria may be new (opened just this year) but it should be around a while - well-priced traditional Mexican food with a focus on local, organic and sustainable ingredients, plus kick ass cocktails and a lively laid-back venue.

We showed up at about 1, I had a reservation...the hostess wanted to seat us outside, but I asked if we waited could we be seated at what looked to be an open table. My friends were running late since they were not used to Austin traffic and I believe the marathon was happening this weekend, so roads were closed off, etc. They showed up a half hour later, I asked if we could hold our table since the entire party had to be seated and she tried to send us outside again but I said inside would be better since it was a bit blustery.Anyways, we got some bloody marys while waiting. They were pricey at $8 and small but tasty and spicy. I liked the bacon garnish. The entire space inside was very hipster but neat and the outside seating would be very enjoyable on a nice day. They had a live DJ for part of the time we were there. It is in a slightly ghetto area at the end of the block that you can tell is on it's way to being gentrified. There is an interesting looking brewery next door which we wanted to check out but they were having a private event.Friends finally showed up and again the hostess wanted to seat us outside even though there were two free tables at this point. She started getting nasty and unfriendly for whatever reason, but we got seated. Our waitress was not very good, she was pretty inattentive but seemed to maybe be stretched thin so we will give her the benefit of the doubt.One of the party ordered the pork belly which they were out of so they comped his meal which was very nice, he got the fried chicken. We also tried the pork tacos, stuffed avocado and a side of the biscuits. They also got a few more cocktails, the mule was good, but the strawberry basil drink and sangria were weak apparently. So this is why this place only gets 3 stars, the food and drinks are overpriced for what you get. I am not sure if the hipsters flocking there have caused the inflated prices but we got half of an avocado with a small scoop of crab meat, a small egg and some gluey cheese for $15. The biscuits were dollar sized and the gravy was good but the biscuits were dry. The fried chicken was overdone and not very good, they just had the fried chicken at Bacon and said it was far superior. That was the only portion that I would say is larger than normal. The food also took about 45 minutes to come and the waitress apologized a few times for the delay. We did get our water filled quite regularly by the water boy though so that was nice, but we did have a pitcher of water on the table as well...but kudos for ensuring we are hydrated.So afterwards, my friends were still hungry and got some stuffed egg rolls at the food truck that set up behind the building. I believe that the cost of the ingredients that went into what we got versus what we paid was a bit unreasonable. It would be one thing if the food was out of this world stellar, but it was just OK and nothing too memorable.As we were leaving, the hostess did not thank us for coming...instead she gave us the nastiest look on the planet which was pretty uncalled for. I will pass on coming here for dinner, but I guess since there is not much else in the area it is a good option for those that don't want to venture out as much."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Fancy!

The best falafel in my mind can be found in Jordan, Palestine and Israel.  Rami's is real Israeli falafel and shawarma.  And it is up to par.  The food is fresh, tasty and in good quantity.\\nThe cons:  The price is a bit too high.  I would come back more often if the price was a bit lower.  There is no amba (which is a mango based dressing), that they once used to have and I happen to really like.  It would also be nice to be able to add tahini on your own (from personal containers) as the middle of the pita is often lacking when the tehini is only put on top when the dish is prepared.\\nThe pros: The falafel is really good and so is the shawarma. The staff were very friendly.

That was a mistake. At Dirty Frank's, the more unhealthy it sounds the more delicious it is. Make sure you get their Chili cheese fries. They're amazing. Do NOT get the Sauerkraut Dog or the Brisket and Slaw dog. They are dry and disappointing. If you don't want a really messy dog, the Chicago dog is a delicious choice. It wasn't the most amazing Chicago dog I've ever had but I liked it. The Seoul Dog is good, but not that Spicy. Just get anything that sounds messy and is covered in cheese or sauce and you will love it. FYI there may be a line out the door, but that's for people waiting on tables.

When I placed my order, you can see her open a fridge, and pop a couple things into a microwave. Everything tastes pretty good, so I can't imagine how good it is fresh. She hands out the dinner menu, so it's pretty expensive. If you ask nicely, she can make you a pita wrap for more cheaper option ($6?). It's still expensive, but the flavors almost match the price.So I get it now. I'd like to come during dinner one time, and see what it really should be like.

I called and was able to have them hold a table for the seven of us and we got there about 545pm. We placed our orders and took us about an hour to get our food but we got appetizers so we were ok. We ordered the hush puppies and the fried okra both of which were AMAZING. Combined we ordered the following dinners; smoked brisket, fried chicken, shrimp and grits, chicken wings and the pulled pork. \\n     The brisket was smoked to perfection, I subbed the baked beans for the mashed and corn bread for the slaw. The corn bread was very lack luster, cold and hard which was a bit of a surprise but the mashed was awesome. The fried chicken was awesome as well when he menu said breast and thigh I didn't realize that it was going to be boneless the slaw was terrible runny like the cabbage had milk poured over it. The pulled pork was tough as shoe leather but they managed to choke it down. The shrimp and grits were ok nothing to write home about and the shrimp needed to be deveined. The chicken wings were outstanding and I would get them again. Over all food wise I would probably go back but if u have read this far wait till u hear the rest. \\n     So like I said there were seven of us and we split the bill three ways no big deal.  They added the gratuity in already ok no biggie. Two of us pay with a card and one with cash. Mind you the bill was over $150. The waiter comes back to my parents who paid with cash and said excuse me ur 10cents short. I was appalled not that my parents made the mistake of shorting 10cents fine we owed that but what's 10cents on a $150 bill. At the end my parents gave him another buck because they were in the wrong by accident.

It's nice to have a place in town that you can tell is homemade, and the cooks are very detail oriented, as you can see because the flat top is right in the middle of the restaurant. Each burger is made to order ingredient by ingredient, and it shows in the food.The only reason that Flat Patties didn't get 5 stars is because the burgers have the tendency to be a little on the salty side, but that's totally fine when you can wash it down with one of the draft beers they have on tap!"},{"name":"Milestone 229","address":"229 Civic Center Dr","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"For atmosphere I give it 5 stars.

However, in this case I am serious. This is the best brisket I have ever eaten. I heard a rumor that this place once donated their brisket to mouth cancer patients that had a hard time chewing as a great source of protein. I wouldn't be surprised if that was the truth. Brisket jello. When they took the chunk of meat out, and placed it to be cut, you could literally see it moving around in the same way you would see a jello mold move around. I was stoked. The wait: We were told to wake up early and get there, and I was a little skeptical as it was a week day. I mean who lines up at 6:00AM on a weekday for brisket? So...we decided to plan our arrival around 7:30 hr just to be safe. We heard the place sells out every day, so we wanted to make sure we didn't miss out. Our actual arrival time was 8:15, and sure enough we were around 50th spot in the line...crazy. I spoke to the couple at the start of the line, and they made me aware they had been there since 5:30AM. Short while later, the brisket tally began. A young lady walked around to each person in line to get a tally of what people planned to order. She informed us that in our current position, we would be served around 12:45PM. She was pretty accurate, but we ended up getting served around 12:00 PM. We ordered some sausage, ribs, and the brisket. Sausage and ribs were delicious, but the brisket took the prize. Nice pink smoke ring, tender as can be, and worth every second of the wait. We took about two of the four pounds we ordered home, and plan on making some breakfast tacos with the leftovers! BBQ x 2. I recommend everyone to at least give this a shot once if you have the time, and are in the area.The wait is fun. People drink, play cards, guitar, etc. It's like a pregame for the BBQ Superbowl.

The restaurants at CityWalk should be accustomed to high traffic, so the long wait was inexcusable. I was very disappointed because I was really looking forward to the experience. The server admitted that she noticed the tables around us had already received their food, despite being seated after us. The reason: the kitchen lost our ticket.

Service was so spotty, I had a tough time finding our waitress the whole night. We ordered a ton of dishes, none of which impressed me. I also asked for a glass of white wine, she poured me one which was so sweet it tasted like grape juice, so I asked for another white, she said they only had one other white, it was bland, nothing great. In terms of dishes...They brought out some fresh cold green beans to start which were okay, they were fresh at least. Then we had the chips and onion dip, it was good, but how can you go wrong here? The dip did taste very farm to table. The pickled verrill farm corn pancakes were my favorite dish, but very breakfast tasting. The corn pancakes come in a maple brown sugar with tons of popcorn and shishito peppers. The grilled farm potatoes were okay, not bad, they came in a cream like sauce and definitely tasted like they put bacon bits on top. Whole grilled mackerel...such a Russian/Polish dish in my opinion, it's a whole grilled fish with some cold veggies on the side. Definitely an acquired taste. The seared Japanese eggplant was good, but they brought it out last and I was really full towards the end of the meal. The combination of flavors was very unique. The shaved NY steak carpaccio looked pretty good, but I didn't eat it, it was cut very thin and had mushrooms and bread crumbs on top. My friends were raving about the pork belly on top of grits. I did try to the grits and I liked the grits.All and all I'm giving it 2 stars as the service was terrible and the food just didn't 'wow me' the way I wanted it to.

I've been to restaurants that are actually busy and I have received better service. When we got our food we did not even have silverware instead of apologizing for the inconvenience she blamed the host and said \\"oh really?

Refill for our water or drinks forget that she did not even ask us until she realized we had to get the utensils ourselves. Even after requesting silverware the waitress took 5 minutes and spoke to other tables before bringing us any. The fajitas we had weren't even fajitas. It was just oven chicken cut in pieces, fried fish, and steak cooked separately and out together. The food was too salty. The fajitas weren't even sizzling at all.

Mettle is firing on all cylinders. I had eaten there before with my girlfriend's dad and the menu was a little too exotic for his Ft. Worth personality. I heard they rolled out a new menu aimed at featuring more traditional entrees. I'm not usually into traditional, so I was wondering if it took away the personality I enjoyed the time before. At first glance everything seemed pretty simple. But when it arrived it was a totally new spin on entrees that seemed traditional. Tom had the a grilled iceberg salad which was off the charts. They grill the lettuce and serve it on a wood plank like grilled fish might be served and layer in some pork belly with blue cheese dressing. It tasted like it was cooked over a campfire. I'm not sure what kind of stove they have in the kitchen, but it made for a new twist on a salad that doesn't normally peak my interest. It will be an appetizer every time I go from now on. Angela had beef bourginon, which sounded like an boring order, but it was bursting with flavor. Alex had a Vegan dish and was convinced it wasn't vegan because the sauce was so rich...I gather that's not common for Vegan dishes and a good thing. I had red fish in coconut milk with beats. We grew beats in the garden last winter and I'm totally going to reproduce this in the kitchen next year. For the variety of diets sitting at the table (2 paleos and a vegan) it was awesome that everybody walked away completely impressed.

There was black pepper infused in it and I hate black pepper. It might've said on the menu that it had black pepper, but I didn't know the bun would be so concentrated with it. It completely ruined my meal so I just ate the fried cod and bacon on it's own. The regular fries were once again bland and soggy. I really don't recommend coming here for food.

Everything is big in this restaurant - the restaurant itself, the drinking cups, the margaritas, the entrees.One star for the good food, one star for the good atmosphere, one star for cheap price, one star for the good drinks.Only four stars because of how heavy everything is.

If I could give this location no stars, I would. I visited this location around 3:30PM and here are a few things that I have to say:- The young lady working the counter was friendly. I ordered two cupcakes and a pint of milk ($9.00 and I tipped $3.00).- I ordered The Classic and the John Lemon. After paying and tipping, I was told that they were out of The Classic. So, I ordered the Double Dose and the John Lemon. I was sooooooooooo disappointed when I got home. The Double Dose was very underwhelming and dry. The John Lemon was worse!!!! This cupcake was an insult to John Lennon. I bit into it and it literally broke in half. Maybe they use a bad recipe or sell cupcakes that are two weeks old. Who knows?! I would have been better off getting my cupcake fix from HEB. I didn't even bother to finish them. They have a new home in the trash...Moving forward, I will stick to Sprinkles or Remedy Cupcakery. Hey, Cupcake is more like No, Cupcake for me.

I think some of the reviews were unfair - they say the food is good but give 1 or 2 stars? My advice to you is that if you are one of those uptight, complainy-complainensteins, you should do yourself and the rest of us yelpers a favor and just skip this place. This is one of my regular places for Mexican food. I usually get the gordita plate, or the special of the day. They have daily specials every day of the week. Enchiladas are good, rice and beans are always edible too. This place is alot cheaper than El Ranchito down the street, and I think it has better food, and definitely prettier waitresses. \\nOh, and the place has a drive thru which is nice, you just have to know what you are ordering because the menu listed on drive thru is outdated. \\nThis place needs to get their liquor license and I would be in there a lot more."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"As the time neared for my first trek to Franklin Barbecue, I was getting grouchier and grouchier.  \\"What is it with everyone in Austin going to all the same places and crowding everything up?!?\\"  \\"Will it be worth the wait?!?\\"  And so on...  This morning, after a 1.5 mile walk from my house, we joined the line at around 10:15 am awaiting their 11:00 opening.  Fortunately, our part of the line was shaded and the people in line were all pretty cool.  By the time I made it inside and got the meat, it was almost a two hour wait.When I got up to the counter, I was REALLY impressed with not only the beauty of the meat, but also the friendliness of the owner.  He was great.  I watched as he pulled out slab after slab of juicy meat for the folks ahead of me in line.  I'd heard it was good...  But, I've never seen BBQ look THIS good!I ordered 1/2 lb of fatty brisket, 4 ribs, one sausage, cole slaw and a lemon chess pie.  I grabbed some iced tea, napkins and pickles and headed outside to where my table awaited.  The brisket was pretty good.  I'm always meh about brisket, even though I eat enough of it, and this was some of the better I've had.  The ribs were crazy good.  The sausage was excellent.  The cole slaw was good but not as good as Salt Lick's (my favorite any where).  I liked their regular BBQ sauce a lot.  It was a bit tangy/spicy and complemented the meat quite well, although frankly, the ribs and sausage were perfect without it.The lemon chess pie, made elsewhere, was the perfect ending to the meal and very tasty.Was it worth the wait?

There are several booths and tables, including this cute little end booth for two where you sit on adjacent sides instead of across from each other.  The bar area is nice and large, and though it wasn't terribly crowded, it seemed like it had a good capacity. When I was there they were serving a full bar and a limited appetizer menu only. The servers were all very pleasant, and since no one was officially assigned to tables, they all asked us if we had been helped and if they could get us anything. Our server told us that all the food was homemade. We tried the spinach artichoke dip, made with white wine. It was flavorful, had large fresh chunks of artichokes, and the white wine base was noticeable. Then since they were out of the Margherita pizza, we tried the fries, which to me were just plain old steak fries. Would have been better with cheese. Drinks were relatively prompt considering, and well mixed. Some of the servers were obviously new and learning new drinks (ours didn't know how to make my signature drink, the Irish car bomb), but they all seemed eager to figure things out.

The cafe looked really cool, it was a nice day, the windows were wide open and it was nice and bright and relaxed.  However, this was a nice dinner with my mom so I opted for the dining room.  We were sat at a nice quaint table for two.  Our server came up and she was adorably cute, friendly but not fake, and she paced everything perfectly throughout our visit.  The menu had great options... like someone else said, everything from brick oven pizza to elaborate meals of steak and fish.  We started with a garden salad with fried goat cheese.  SO GOOD.  Nice touch, good start.  I had a fun refreshing pomegranate Bellini and my mother had a martini.  Both good.  My mother ordered the duck and I ordered the wok charred salmon.

But if I hadn't eaten it I would have been missing out because both of our meals were superb.  My mother RAVED about her duck.  And let me tell you, she is quite the chef herself, so the fact that she was so impressed with her meal speaks volumes, I think.  We each had a glass of wine with our meal, which was whatever the server recommended... very good.

Finding a place to sit however, well . . . Good Luck!The pot pies have a deliciously flaky puff pastry crust that folds over a mug, bowl or large ramekin depending on which type you buy, and the creative fillings run the gamut from traditional chicken to local favorites like crab, prawn, lamb or scallop. There are at least 10 different pot pies to choose from and easily as many (if not more) sweet pies offered. Be warned however, that the pot pies are baked in batches, so you might want to choose a back-up in case the one you want is not available at the time that you order.I picked up a chicken pot pie, a blackberry pie (a la mode of course,) a butter tart, and a mincemeat tart.The pot pie was rich and hearty with generous pieces of chicken and celery. If you are looking for comfort food, then this is definitely your pie. My only wish would be for at least twice the amount of crust, but I suppose that wrapping the entire bowl in a crust of puff pastry would be silly . . . right?. (OK, so when you are writing about food and you start to salivate, then you know it was really good! Well, I'm salivating!) The pastry with the gravy is really that good!The tarts were very good (especially the butter tart,) but  the blackberry pie was just average in my opinion . . . I know that I am a snob when it comes to food, but the blackberry filling was a little to thick and dry for my taste. In all fairness, blackberry season was about 3 weeks away and I had, just a few days earlier, devoured a few dozen fresh off the vine in northern California, but still! I also asked for the pie to be heated, but it barely hit tepid, and the ice cream didn't even begin to melt (or soften) at all.The house-made lemonade was very good, and although I didn't try any, I noticed that they made quite a few fresh fruit smoothies.Without a doubt, I will eat here again! I can quite happily imagine passing quite a few rainy afternoons sitting in front of the windows overlooking both the city and False Creek while chasing away a chill with a hot pot pie (or two!) As to those cherished sunny summer afternoons, hopefully the next pie will be better!** on a side note - A LA Mode sells their plastic utensils for either a dime or quarter each, so if you just bought some cheese or pate from Oyama . . . here is the place to grab the utensils.

Trust me, if I had the 40 acres and mule, I'd be glad to cough them up so you didn't have to shlep french fries.  But life has not been that kind to me.  So here's the deal:  I'm the harried business casual wearing frequent flier, you are the person that as quickly as possible lobs empty (and plentiful) calories into the bag and tosses it in my general direction.This was just a huge epic fail.

Yes please!!! After reading several fellow yelpers' reviews about this place, I absolutely had to check it out when visiting Portland. Luckily, I was able to go on my last day visiting the city and I'm so happy that I was able to go I went on a Tuesday so there was barely a wait....less than 3 minutes. This was music to my ears since I've heard that Screen Door's patrons have waited over an hour and a half for brunch. We ordered one of their well known specials, fried chicken and sweet potato waffles, as well as bananas foster french toast. The latter was essentially dessert for breakfast - it consisted of griddled brioche soaked in rich vanilla custard with cinnamon, bananas, and whipped cream. Needless to say, we had filled our \\"dessert\\" quota for the day after that dish. As for the fried chicken and sweet potato waffles...oh boy, excuse me while I wipe the drool off my face as I write up this review. It was one of the best chicken and waffles that I've had in awhile. The chicken was incredibly juicy with a beautiful, crispy, and flavorful coating of skin and the sweet potato waffle was a yummy medium of sweetness to balance the savory chicken. I highly recommend this dish if you're a fan of chicken and waffles because it will definitely hit the spot! Overall, this is definitely worth trying! Even if you're not a huge chicken and waffles fan, you're guaranteed to find an item on the menu that will suit your tastes. The staff are very nice with helpful recommendations depending on your tastes.

The details: My friend and I arrived at 6pm for happy hour.  We were one of just a few tables there at the time.  We got our drinks in a reasonable amount of time, but our server, Karen, took over 20 minutes (after dropping off our drinks) to come back to get our appetizer order.  The beers were warm, but I'm not one to complain about something minor like that.  The food took 30 minutes to arrive, and when it did, she dropped it off and literally ran off...and she had dropped off a wrong item.  The other item that we did in fact order was cold.  When we finally got her attention, she did put in the correct order for us, which arrived a while later (also cold).  At this point we were out of drinks and wanted to order another.  It was a bit busier, but there were still empty tables in the restaurant.  This is when our server was walking to another table and spilled an entire tray of drinks down my back and all over my purse.  Like, I'm talking probably 8 beers.  I was soaked.  My purse was full of beer.  Nobody offered me a towel to clean off with.  Karen just picked up the glasses from the ground and ran off.  I used the few napkins on the table to try to sop up the beer.  Someone else came along a few minutes earlier to wipe down the table, but she didn't say anything to me or my friend. We finally got our second round of drinks, which again, were warm.When the check came, it was incorrect.  I tried for about 10 minutes to get our server's attention to get this corrected, but she was MIA.  I finally gave up and just paid the incorrect price.I'd like for a manager to message me on here.  I couldn't believe the horrible service, and my purse still smells like beer.  And I thought it was pretty crappy that after I had an entire tray of drinks poured down my back, there was no effort to say sorry...couldn't you have given me my appetizer for free?

Staff kept coming around with drinks and were super friendly.

I have been to Blacks, Lulling Salt Lick etc. No way to describe the amount it was better than those places! My wife, the vegetarian, tried it and went to the dark side for a meal and all 5 of us said it might be the single best taste we have ever had.Met Aaron Franklin. Wow, what a nice guy. Always smiling and super friendly. He went to each person and table and asked how it was. Very humble and friendly. Talked to all of my kids. Reminds me of Thomas Keller of French Laundry and Per Se fame. Food unlike any place in the world. His BBQ was as good as the French Laundry's food only it was BBQ. These two need to go into business together. Sauces were great but none needed. Ill put them on my food at home.

The inside of the restaurant is very loud and cramped. It has a more upscale vibe, but seems far too similar to the quick-service cafeteria hubs that are within the theme parks. We were seated nearly on top of the two other tables on either side of us. Our server, Steve, was very friendly and remarkably efficient considering how busy the restaurant was. Our drinks never went empty, and he provided recommendations from every category on the menu.I ordered the Rise and Swine burger, and my wife ordered a bento box. We also ordered the crab rangoon dip as an appetizer. The dip was delicious, full of crab meat and temperature hot. Served with it was light, crisp wontons which were topped with a sweet chili sauce. The wontons were good enough without the dip. My burger was cooked appropriately and came out piping hot. The Black Forest ham was sliced thicker than I expected, the egg cooked appropriately sunny-side-up, the cheese melted, and the vegetables were fresh. Overall the taste was very good, but the burger was extremely messy. My wife was not a fan of the bento box. It came with a below-average burger slider, and a sushi roll that was not up to par with restaurants that would charge less for it.I found the French fries that came with my meal to be exemplary. Crisp, crunchy outside, with a soft pillowy inside. My wife loves the edamame that came in her bento box.I understand the audience they are going for is tourists and families that don't know any better, but I really have no reason to return.

It was very busy for a Wednesday night with a short wait for a table and this is a good indicator of its popularity. My favorite part of this restaurant is the atmosphere. The building has an older, dimly lit, historic feel to it and is very cozy. I loved our little table for two tucked away in the corner. A little candle was in the window next to us and it provided a perfect romantic backdrop on a rainy summer evening. We started our dinner with fried calamari as an appetizer and it was quite good. I went with the grilled salmon dinner as a healthier option after splurging on the fried calamari. The salmon was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of crisp to the outside. The side dishes, however, were a little disappointing.  I have given risotto a chance in the past, but I am not a big fan.  Their risotto creation mixed with kale and corn may be appealing to some, but is not my thing. It was accompanied by parsnip pur√©e which tasted okay, but paired next to the risotto it all seemed very mushy. I would have loved a side of rice and asparagus instead.

Definitely a great place to go if you're looking for some cheap bites.  Everything started off fine.  Got in our drink and food orders.  Drinks came out pretty quickly. Food kind of took a while.  And as time went on we started to see our server come outside less and less to where she was almost non existent.  We ended up waiting for twenty minutes to finally grab her and ask for our check.  Then at least another twenty minutes went by before she came out to get our cards to pay for it.  If I was a lesser person, I could have easily dined and ditched and have been long gone before she'd have even noticed.

In town for two evenings, this was dinner for the first night.Made a reservation for 6, but when I arrived at 5:30, the place was empty. By the time I left, there were just a couple of tables dining.I went the traditional southern route with my dinner, which was suggested by my attentive and wonderful server, Nick.Drink: South City Cosmo. They were out of the advertised Absolut in the drink and substituted Absolut Citron in its place, which tasted great to me. A+Appetizer: Fried Green Tomatoes with Goat Cheese. Crispy, cheesy, TASTY! A+Dinner: Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Garlic Collard Greens and Mashed Potatoes. I asked before I ordered if the chicken was boneless and was told it was. Apparently it was semi-boneless because I had bones, but it was still very good. The seasoning was perfect, and the breading was hot and crispy. \\nGarlic Collard Greens were amazing as well, so I'm sure they were loaded with pork fat to give it that great southern flavor.

The answer according to our friends over at Foster Burger is \\"pretty damn good.\\"  The only downside is that you have to pay a pretty good amount for it.  Not to worry though, because on the scale of cost vs. pleasure everything balances out.  They have lots of \\"add on\\" options that will cost you more money, but really the basic burger is good (although I usually add the bacon, my friend swears by the beets).  They do table service and have a little bar/counter as well.  I find the service to be top notch, but I have never eaten there at peak hours so it may get more hectic at those times.  The wait for your food once you've ordered isn't very long and I am usually absorbed in the rock n roll posters on the walls until it arrives.  Take a minute to savor the perfection of your burger, the way it looks, smells, sounds, etc.  Because once you start eating it may be hard to stop, these things are delicious. The burgers tend to be pretty sloppy, but thats how these things are supposed to be, although to be fair I have not yet needed to surrender to the knife and fork tactic, but about half way through I always feel it could become a reality.  The fries are crispy and delicious and they serve plenty of them, so you don't need to worry.  They have booze, but I have never indulged because when I am at Foster Burger all I want is burger.  And fries.

Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I discovered No Mas Cantina in the winter of 2007-2008.  None of my friends had any idea about the Castleberry Hill neighborhood, let alone about this restaurant.  I don't know how I discovered it, or why I decided to go to brunch, but from that moment on it became a frequent stop for me and my friends.  We went plenty of times, usually just for a good hearty breakfast but we also held a bridal shower here and I even took my Mom here when she was visiting for Mother's Day one year!  Many of my best memories in Atlanta take place at No Mas, so I decided this was the perfect place to go with a group of girls for brunch over my bachelorette weekend.The restaurant is exactly as I had remembered it.  It's a huge, huge space and it's never crowded.  We always wondered how they stay open, and I think it must be that it's much more popular for dinner.  But the space is GORGEOUS!  You walk in and are immediately blown away by the bright colors, authentic d√©cor, beautiful paintings and intricately designed wood furniture.  It does not at ALL feel like you are in downtown Atlanta; it feels like you are at a Latin American getaway.  The Mexican brunch menu is pretty much what you would imagine - the dish options are heavy on the salsa, crema and chorizo.  I ordered the chilaquiles without beans (it comes with corn tortillas cooked in salsa verde, topped with 2 eggs, queso fresco and crema Mexicana), which I don't think I had ever ordered in the past (I usually stuck with the Southwest omelette).  I so totally regret straying from what I know, because I was so underwhelmed by this dish that I was served at a place that I hold so dear to my heart.  There were way too many chips compared to the other components of the dish, and it felt overly salty.  I kick myself for that.  We also checked in on Yelp and got a free appetizer of the queso blanco, which is big and delicious, as always.  (They give you complimentary salsa and chips for brunch, too, and the salsa is pretty great... not overly spicy and has quite a lot of smokiness to it, which is somewhat unusual.)  My sister ordered the No Mas! Original Capirotada French Toast, which she loved.  It's a bread pudding that is made with cinnamon, apples and raisins, that is then sliced and prepared as French toast and is topped with honey and whipped cream.  It is obviously quite decadent, and it was presented beautifully on the plate.  If you have a sweet tooth, you would probably really dig this.... it's basically dessert for breakfast.  And, finally, the drinks!  They have a lot of cool coffees and hot chocolates, and also a few good choices for mimosa flavors.  I got a mango mimosa, and it was very good.They have a store in the back of the restaurant called No Mas Hacienda which is really, really cool.  I know they have their own Yelp review page, but I feel like I should just mention it here because it makes coming to No Mas more of an event, rather than just a place to grab some grub.  They sell everything and it's all really cool - jewelry, purses, furniture, barware, arts and crafts, etc.  The vast majority of it is homemade, and most of it looks distinctly Mexican / Latin.  I purchased some really cool homemade Frida Kahlo earrings there many years ago that I still wear to this day, and, I discovered, that they still sell!  And finally, the garden area.  This didn't exist when I used to be a regular, not that I did any gardening back then, anyway.  They sell all kinds of handmade terra cotta pots and planters that are just gorgeous and SO inexpensive!!!  They have every size, including some pots that were literally just a smidge smaller than I am.  And they look very well made.  One of my friends tried everything she could think of to get some back to her apartment in NYC but shipping costs a flat rate of $200, which is steep for pots that are very much not that expensive.  If you are looking for any type of pots or planters and you live in the area or can drive the stuff home, you should probably go here immediately.I know I'll be back to No Mas, and I encourage this big ole beautiful restaurant to keep on keepin on.  I'm going to throw it out there that this is probably the best brunch in downtown Atlanta, so it's a great spot for tourists who leave and thereafter go to some of the big tourist attractions.  And also Mexican brunch is so legit - so much delicious flavor!  Just skip the chilaquiles like I should have.  *Smacks forehead*"},{"name":"Rovente Pizzeria","address":"3240 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Hey listen, The pizza was GREAT!

BISq really blew me away (and my husband, and the two friends we've been with).This is everything I want in a wine bar: beautifully curated if esoteric list--I worked in wine for years and I guarantee you will want help sorting it--with lots of affordable options.Gorgeous, warm, inviting atmosphere and AMAZING bites.Beer list is clever and brief. The aim here seems to be hand-picked, delicious beverages that rotate out frequently, rather than a constant huge selection. As of April 2016 they are only serving beer and wine, so if you absolutely need a martini you should start at Bergamot's bar and then walk over here :) Bergamot, BISq's sister restaurant, is my go-to special eats place. BISq exec chef Dan Bazzinotti was sous at Bergamot for years and brings that level of finesse to this more casual venture, with his own flair of course.The charcuterie is the star of the venue, and is...I just...I can't...go eat it. EAT IT ALL. Think you don't like head cheese? You will like Dan's version, which melts in your mouth where it isn't pleasantly chewy. Think you don't like whipped lardo? You will like Dan's, which is magically creamy and light without feeling greasy. You probably already like mortadella and pate and whatnot, but you'll like his more. The rest of the menu is fun and well-executed. I'd say the biggest challenge, if you go for a full meal vs. a snack with your beverage, is getting a balanced-feeling meal since much of the food is quite rich and protein-heavy. That IS the perfect profile for a night out drinking, though! Don't miss $1 oysters, expertly shucked and with a dreamily light mignonette, on Mondays *and* Tuesdays. Having only been twice to date, I don't know if I can make a reliable statement about service. The team is well informed, above and beyond friendly, and loving their jobs. On my second visit we did have a clearly in-training waiter who was not up (yet) to the Bergamot team standard but the front of house and bar staff - Felipe, Luis, and Aaron, all outstanding - made sure we were nevertheless well taken care of.Thrilled to have BISq in my hood!

We waited. 20 minutes on line (at 5:freaking:30, and they open at 5). We waited 15 minutes for the food. It was the passionate, romantic, I-will-be-right-here-waiting-for-you moment Richard Marx cried about. The slider came out first, and it didn't go down without a fight.

The egg was perfect in the way that newborn babies are perfect. The noodles: magic. I wish I could say it wasn't great. That the line going out the door, and the fools suffering for it, were all part of a culture gone awry, unable to focus on the pressing issues that should render it impossible to make such silly sacrifices for food.

Down those stairs, you will be warped to the Lower East Side of New York City or at least it feels that way. Super upbeat modern feel. Not exactly my kind of vibe but I'm ok with it. I ate here couple times, and the menu is almost always incomprehensible to me. It's super innovative and modern. Up to this point, it should have been at least a four-star review, but it's not. Most of the food I had here is only partially good. What does that mean? It is always those very sophisticated dish with many subcomponents. Not all of those subcomponents are good. Croissant toad in the hole, for example, has nice delicious filling in the hole, but the bread is not really croissant but it's some toasted buttery bread. Biscuit sandwich has the best biscuit but the rest of the dish is just OK. Pig's tails with cheesy grit is good but only for the grit. You get the idea. Our servers suggest that the food can be done family style to be shared. But nope. None of it is really easily sharable e.g. soft-boiled eggs, grits, etc. I mentioned that to the server after we got our food, and she sort-of snapped back at me. I never demand any attentive service, but my rule is that no server should insult me. I don't think that's too much to ask. For restaurants at this caliber, I don't expect that to happen. If you want to experience innovative modern cuisine, this is probably the place for you. But I guess I am not enough sophisticated enough to enjoy this place.

Woke the family up at 4am, leaving @5 and heading to Austin for some BBQ!\\nWon't bore u with the drive, and won't even brag about how awesome the crowd was when we made it to Franklins.  I will let u know we made it by 7am and had a pretty good spot, and it true if ur not in line by 9-9:30 u might as well reschedule. So finally 11:00! Doors open tell every one to put up their chairs, n blankets and whatnots.  Even though the doors are open ur still gonna wait another 45mins to hr that is if u get there close to 6-7am(depending on your spot in line of course).  Well we finally get to the counter, and by the way I have my wife, and my 14yr old son with me and I finally get to order! I order a beef rib (sold by bone only) normally 4 lbs! It's huge!!, .5lb lean brisket .5 of moist, 1lb of sausage and pork ribs, .25 of turkey, tipsey Texan, beans and potatoes salad, couple sweet teas, pecan pies, lemon tart, and key lime... whew!\\n I'll start by saying I have it 4 stars because certain things wer awesome, I mean really awesome, but the Texan sandwich wasn't that great.  The c slaw I didn't like and I think that ruined it for me.  The sausage tasted better the next day maybe because of the competition it was up against the previous day.  The beef rib was good, the size was more impressive than the taste I think, the lean brisket was delicious, but the stars of the show was the moist brisket and the pork ribs!!! My goodness!! \\n So to close when I go back because I will b back, I'm loading up on moist brisket, pork ribs, and sausage because it was so good that following day, allong with the sweet tea and the pecan pies!!

The cocktails are simply top notch. Seriously, I will go back at some point just to grab a drink and some of the house pickled green beans. The food was good but not quite five star. The dishes were a bit hit or miss. When I say hit or miss I mean some were AMAZING and some were merely good. I didn't try any bad dishes there I was just disappointed by some of the flavor combinations. For example, the charbroiled oysters weren't bad but there was just too much going on in the dish flavor wise making the oysters feel like an after thought in the flavor profile. That being said I would absolutely go to Alden and Harlow again.

It is small but pleasant and nicely decorated.  There is a small counter. There are pastries and artisan chocolates you can purchase.  Service was relaxed but friendly.  Place was basically empty on a Monday morning.I had the highly reviewed blue corn pancakes.  They were good, but nothing special. They tasted good, but they didn't seem unique.  Also had one potato cake which was actually just a small portion of shredded potatoes.  They could've been crispy, but were kind of limp and soggy without much flavor.  Got 2 orders of their bacon, which was regular supermarket style bacon - nothing fancy.  You did get a lot, so one order is enough.  They have mimosas that you can get with OJ or other juices like mango.  I got the mango mimosas and they were great.  The cafe Cubano I also ordered was decent, though was missing the lemon rind it should have to be a true Cuban espresso.UPDATE:  Just tried the cajete blondie, the mango pie, and the cheesecake brownie.

Anyone married for good amount of time would have known, even though she was being honest, there should be a backup plan. The Oakwood was previously recommended to us several times by friends as a great place to go.  As a result, we called the Oakwood and explained my situation, and even with a big table coming in later in the night, they would make sure we could get a table for my wife's special day. This was just the tip of the great experience we had the Oakwood.As the name suggests, The Oakwood specializes in Canadian inspired dishes that are elevated to provide a \\"more elegant experience\\". Even with this said, the Oakwood dishes are comfort-like foods and are typically in a tapas format (smaller and meant to be shared). Between the two of us, we tried 4 different dishes and were to a point of almost uncomfortably full (since we just couldn't stop eating the great dishes)!Two dishes that really stood out were: \\n1) The Poutine - large amounts of cheese curds and slow roasted beef brisket over a skillet of hand-made french fries smothered in gravy for $10 is something certainly not to be passed up!\\n2) Pot of local mussels - in a creamy, but light tomato broth with corn bread crustinies for ~$15 were fantastically fresh and packed full of flavour.Due to the large table that came in during our dinner, the server was running around quite a bit. However, I would not say our service was severely hindered, but instead was as good as you could expect for so many people in a restaurant on a Wednesday night. Since it was my wife's birthday, the manager even came over twice to make sure things were going well. The first time the manager came over (during waiting for our first dish), the manager came over to wish my wife a happy birthday and asked how the drinks were.  I really liked my beer (Pilsner from the 4 Winds Brewery), but my wife was ok with her wine. The manager sensing that she liked but did not love her wine, changed out her glass for a different wine and made sure it was full. I was really impressed by this, as I haven't had a restaurant ever offer to exchange wines even with several sips already taken from a glass. After our last dish, the waiter offered a free dessert for my wife since it was her birthday. We were so full, we decided to pass. So, a few minutes later, the manager came over and convinced us she needed a free dessert to share. I know my wife was, but I was also so happy we fit the the maple creme caramel, as it was incredibly tasty and will bring me back.Overall, the experience at the Oakwood was great for food and service. I have recommended the Oakwood to several people and each one of them have thanked us for the recommendation (with some making several trips).  If you're looking for a sit down experience for a special night, or with a group of friends to enjoy great food, great service and good drinks, I highly recommend you give the Oakwood a try.A solid 5 out of 5."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Masa, you are sneaky. Very, very sneaky. B\\nBut sneakiness aside, I think your bargains are great. After going there for brunch and happy hour, my tummy and wallet thanks you profusely. Brunch- the website advertises for the $7.95 Saturday brunch that includes a starter, main, and either coffee or tea but when my friends and I got there they only handed out the regular brunch menus. We had to specifically ask for the Saturday brunch menu on a Saturday, or else we would not have gotten it!Sneaky. But the food was excellent! My caramelized plantain empanada starter could have been dessert and the heurvos rancheros were tasty. The choice of coffee or tea allow non-coffee drinkers like myself some selection. My friends loved the spicy Bloody Mary and the Eggs Benedict while I  really like the elaborate hanging chandelier and the placement of mirrors to brighten up the whole restaurant. Happy Hour (limited to the bar area only)- they didn't have the $5 sangria that Yelpers had mentioned but they had a Cinco de Mayo special for a $5 Masarita, which was essentially margarita-esque. Now the sneaky part is that the 50 cents tapas only applied if you get the one of everything combo plate. Which was perfectly acceptable for me as a dinner entree, but I have friends who can't tolerate or have allergies to certain foods and had to order off the $1 tapas selection during happy hour. Nevertheless the cheesy empanada, pulled pork egg roll, and the taquitos were great.

Sitting in the Fenway area, many Red Sox fans come here looking for a quick bite to eat either before/after a game and are satisfied with the prices. The other foot traffic arises from late nights out. Tasty Burger is located by a movie theater, the House of Blues, and a nightclub. After a night out in the Fenway area, the place is busy, though you do not wait long for a table. The seating inside is usually plentiful, with classic steel tables and chairs comfortably seating tables of four. However, if you'd prefer not to sit down (or you're in a rush) there is an outdoor pickup window. There is a bar that houses plenty of beers and assorted drinks, as well as multiple TVs. In the back of the restaurant is a pool table, perfect for passing the time with friends or conversing with the tables around. The late night crowd is extremely friendly, as are the servers. They are always moving and cheerful.The burgers are good! Are they the best burgers in Boston? No, they are not.

We also got complimentary pickles and onions on the side that customers could help themselves to. They provide you with thick paper to line tables with to avoid the mess.

The indoor stage is TINY and not exactly what Stubb's is known for, but all that resulted was a great, intimate show with decent drink prices and a relatively considerate crowd.My main complaint about Stubb's, though? Their attitude toward cameras. If they catch you with one at the door, you're busted until you return it to your car. No taking out the batteries or film - it's gone. At my first Stubb's show, my friend jammed our cameras down the front of her pants to get them in.Once you have one in, they're sort of weird about it. Have your camera out when a security guy comes by? He'll ask you to put it up or turn off your flash. The only way to avoid trouble is to keep everything short.

The bartender is always on top of keeping my root beer and whiskey at the ready.

If you're looking for a place to try some new cocktails and enjoy some of the best decor and ambiance you can find in Allston, you should definitely go here.Our server, Jeanette, was simply amazing. She suggested drinks for my girlfriend that were spot on, she was incredibly attentive, she ensured everything came out just right (it did), and she was overall really friendly and knowledgeable about the drink and food menus. She's about as good as it gets when it comes to service at a place like this. This of course made the food and drinks even better. Both cocktails we ordered were delicious (and strong). The Szechuan Beef was flavorful and just the right amount of spicy and our desert (the Shanghai Donuts I believe?) was also sweet and ginger-y and just the icing on the cake.If there's any reason not to go here, it's probably because you're a vegetarian. My girlfriend is, and there's just one thing on the menu, entree-wise that she can have, and there's no protein in it.  We'd both love to go here again for dinner, but until there's more than lo mein with veggies (which were good BTW) to choose from, it's going to be a tough sell for anything more than a drink spot for me."},{"name":"Zucca Italian Ristorante","address":"808 Main St","city":"Louisville","stars":"4","text":"Rock solid food and service.

Their pulled pork is some of the best in town, their ribs are off the chain, and their fatty brisket can hold it's own. And that's the only reason to drag yourself to Franklin's. Like previous reviews, the line moves extremely slowly, they run out of food really quickly, their sides are subpar, and the areas a bit dirty. If you go just for the food and early enough, you'll pat yourself on the back.You definitely need to get their before 12 or 1230 because you probably won't get any ribs, and that's half the reason for going to Franklin's. Their two meat plate with two sides plus a soda comes out to $10 and some change. There's enough food for 1.5 meals for me so I look at it as two $5 glorious meals. =) I'm not a big fan of the espresso bbq sauce, but the sweet and pork do their jobs. The BBQ is good enough without sauce so it doesn't really bother me that much. Also, the sides are really disappointing to me. The beans and potato salad are passable but their cole slaw is just no good. The biggest reason I gave Franklin's a 4 instead of 5 was their logistics. Like other people have mentioned, it takes an extremely long time to get served. The guys work fast, but there needs to be another window or something. Everytime I go I end up waiting close to an hour before I eat. Also, they have a big problem with flies.

They'll bring your food to you whether you're in-house, next door, or on the patio. Service was quick, as well.I chose a grilled-tempeh burger with avocado and a side of pickle chips. The tempeh tasted great, very much like a fish sandwich. The light breading on the pickles left them actually pickle-flavored. Good buns and I liked the chocolate shake the spouse ordered.

The concept is simple, the drinks are strong, and the execution is fantastic. My favorites are the waffle with bacon baked in + praline-crusted bacon. I like bacon, okay? The cat head biscuit sandwich, chicken & waffles, and biscuits & gravy are other fantastic choices. Be prepared for portions that are bigger than your head, but you won't regret strolling out like you need to loosen your belt a notch.The one suggestion I would make is to avoid sitting at the bar, if you can help it (or if you can put off eating for that long).

It's a great sushi option in the Watertown area, and I prefer it in quality over New Ginza, which is right down the street.  The customer service is excellent, the sushi is fresh and tasty, and the prices are good.  And they deliver, which is a huge plus. I've been going here for years and the food quality has been consistently good. Their lunch specials are a great option, and my usual go-tos are any of the Spicy Crunchy Maki (yellowtail, tuna, salmon) the Black Forest Maki (deep fried sweet potato ... mmmmm), and the Seaweed Salad.  Super Fusion has a bright, clean, cozy, very casual atmosphere.  I am a big sushi fan; I have eaten my share of questionable grocery store sushi, extremely expensive fancy schmancy sushi that I can afford but once a year, and sushi at the famed Tokyo Fish Market in Japan during my worldly travels ... based on that swath of raw fish experience, this place holds up pretty well against the bajillion other sushi joints I've eaten at within the same price range.  Would this be my absolute favorite go-to sushi place if I didn't live down the street?  No, probably not.  There are a few places I like a little bit more in the greater Boston area, mainly for their darker atmosphere and wider roll selection / flavor combos.

I was informed that they are changing the menu to make it more like a fast food restaurant. If that is the case, the the price should match the amount of food you receive.

I went ahead and made a reservation due to the high tourist traffic in the area. On arrival we showed up 15 minutes early and was asked to come back 30 minutes later. The place wasn't busy at all and a party that walked in with no reservation went directly to a table which I thought was weird but oh well. Once we returned we were taken to our table and waited 20 minutes for a waitress to stop by and take our order. The hostess actually noticed we didn't have drinks on our table and asked if anyone stopped by at that point she went to make sure someone took care of us which was nice of her to do. I did notice that the floors were pretty dirty as we were walking to our table which was surprising for it not being too busy and most of the staff was just hanging out around the bar. As others have stated this place does not have a kids menu. We had to order our daughter a 16 dollar entree that she barely touched. The specialty (60oz) drinks are pretty pricey (31.00) but they do recommend that it should be shared as it contains roughly 5 drinks which isn't too bad when you compare it to the cost of one mixed drink. The kicker is that the non-alcoholic version is 24.00 which is definitely unreasonable. Once our order was placed the food didn't take long to come out and was hot on arrival. We had the pizza burger and the mac and cheese burger which was pretty tasty but nothing to write home about. The best thing about this place is the milkshake. I had a regular chocolate shake which was very good and my daughter had the Nutella shake which was the best!

It's fun, has good food at great prices, and I never fail to have a generally good time here.  I've been going to one Border Cafe or another since the late 80's and after 20+ years I still get that happy feeling when I walk in the door.Warm, salty chips and spicy salsa.  The best damn fajitas in the area in my opinion due to their simplicity: A sizzling hot skillet, a pile of skirt steak strips, an even bigger pile of onions, and paprika sprinkled on top.  Damn near perfection.  They taste like meat and onions, not like a ton of overpowering sauce or guacamole or whatever else comes oozing out of the fajitas you get at some random place in a suburban mall.  And the \\"jambalaya\\" (actually dry brown rice with chunks of \\"andouille\\" and chicken in it) has me totally hooked.  I don't think I'd even like real jambalaya anymore.If you're looking for someplace that serves tamales just like your great-grandma used to make by hand this probably isn't the place.

Today was that day. If i want this experience in Richmond I go to Ninkazu for Lunch for $10.95.Now let's give you the Lowdown on this sushi joint:Classic lunch selection of sushi items. It has everything that you'd expect from AYCE lunch.   Now it doesn't have much hot food and more baller items but at $10.95 what are you expecting.  If you want more items then stick to Dinner or Late Night.  I cannot comment on how good the dinner AYCE menu is cause I have not gone in years.  Quality: Above average for all you can eat standards. I do like that their rolls and rice under the nigiri sushi isn't bogged down by an excessive amount of rice.  Hot food such as tonkatsu and chicken wings, actually comes out hot on your table.  Would have been nice if they had a limited supply of sashimi, but again we have to look to the price. Service: My last two visits, the timing of the food has been spot on.  Only took 3 minutes before the Miso soup, Sunomono were on the table.  2 minutes later the rolls and nigiri came out.  5 minutes later the hot food came.  I like how it is fast here as I like to keep my workday lunches as short as possible. Presentation and Seating.  Very open concept, lots of space.  Large windows and lots of natural light overlooking Aberdeen and Vancouver.  Several large round tables if you want to have a group lunch/dinner.  Accessability: Parking lot sucks.  Seems to be always full by 11:45 and it is a tight lot with lots of confusion.  You may want to just park at the Aberdeen parking lot (can be stressful too), and walk on over.   Monday - Thursday i've never had to wait for a table, however Friday's tend to get busy so you may want to come early or do reso's if thats possible.Ninkazu for me has always met my expecations for lunch AYCE and has been consistent with service, so thats why its gets the 4 stars."},{"name":"Acropol Greek Restaurant","address":"2942 Broadway W","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The service is fantastic.

The bread to start off your brunch is fantastic...really good slices of a sweet roll.  I have found some food items to be so-so and some to be pretty good...nothing spectacular.  Service has left much to be desired each time I've eaten here, but dinner service was better than the three brunches I've had there.

There's really not much to say about these place except they serve possibly the most awesome/amazing sushi in town. Fairly big rolls + ridiculously cheap/affordable prices = bang for your buck. Today, we will be reviewing Sushi Town's location in Burnaby, on Hastings Street.Mangodise Roll - $4.95 (7/7)\\nIf you're a fan of California Roll's, you will be a fan of this. It's essentially a California Roll with Ebi on top, topped off with some special yellow coloured Japanese mayo. We'll take this over the regular California Roll any day. Soya sauce? Who needs that! You can eat this roll as is, as it is packed with so many delicious flavours.Awesome Roll - $6.95 (6/7)\\nUnlike Sushi Nanaimo (who gives you an option to substitute the bonito flakes for the yam chips) and Sushiholic, this Awesome Roll comes topped with bonito flakes. Again, the Awesome Roll is like your basic California Roll but with masago on the inside. Outside comes with an overwhelming (in a good way) amount of toppings such as: salmon, green onion, more masago, and of course, bonito. This combination may not look presentable and/or appetizing/appealing, but this roll, my readers, will blow. your. mind. Guaranteed. The taste is indescribable. It tastes just simply AWESOME. Don't go to Sushi Town without ordering this. Again, soya sauce is unneeded. In fact, try it WITHOUT the soya sauce so your tastebuds can experience the awesomeness that is this roll in all its glory.Spicy Chopped Scallop Roll - $3.95 (4/7)\\nThis roll was nothing out of the ordinary. Just your typical spicy chopped scallop roll. Soya sauce may be needed.Sushi Town has about 4 locations total across the Lower Mainland, so be sure to give them a visit. If you've heard about/tried Sushi Garden, then you will definitely like this as it is the same. Service may be slightly better, but don't count on it.

So we tried to have our friends sit at the table next to ours and she said no way. That table isn't authorized for them. She forced them in the corner until another party left. Then they could join our table by pulling up a table the same size right next to it? The restaurant wasn't that full.Then after awhile two of our friends had to go, and she started freaking out. Then a few people didn't want to order food, just drinks and she said we can't do that (most people at our table were getting food). Her manager would fire her and she needs this job. Things like this kept happening. We'd ask for a minor small request, like hey could we get another beer and she'd freak saying we need to order more food. People were eating, I don't get it. Maybe the manager really is this strict, but SERIOUSLY! I used to work in food service and am seriously SUPER tolerant of bad service, but this was so bad I couldn't bear it.

Mostly due to inconsistency of food -- bbq pork buns were decent but not as good as I remembered them last time (quality/flavor of pork was a bit off this time). Deep fried pork rice ball was super savory but drenched in oil, rendering it a dish you can only have 2-3 bites of before feeling sick. Shrimp rice sheets had less than ideal texture and flavor this time compared to last visit, but still good. Not the best service (definitely very pushy trying to get you to buy different things) but given the price it's still worth a trip back for some authentic dim sum. Would still say it's probably one of the best in town and plan to return."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The fries were terrible but the service was great.

As attested by thousands, the brisket and all the other meats are seriously good. But I have seen lines growing longer and the prices creeping skyward every time I visit. I am happy that Franklin is getting more recognition but I think it is at the cost of some of the old and loyal customers who are getting turned off by the longer wait and higher prices. Prices have nearly doubled over last 4 years. The mixed plate used to cost $8.75. Now it's $16. Brisket went up from $11 to $17.

Every time I come in, they are willing to let me taste both the cheese and salami and they offer great selections for pairing options. There is a wine shop in the back as well, so if you need to complete a wine and cheese night, it's a one stop shop. I have also gotten some of their sandwiches for lunch, all have been very tasty and heated up quickly, despite being very busy.

I recommend making reservations, which I did about a week or two prior to my visit. The restaurant is in a cute house and really feels like you're visiting someone for a traditional Southern dinner. It's a little on the loud side, but I guess that's what you get at a popular place!We opted to get a bottle of pinot noir, which was very reasonably priced ($56 at the restaurant vs $40 retail). We then chose the family style menu so that we could try as many dishes as possible. The toasted deviled ham tea sandwich came first with a side of pickled vegetables (carrots, onions and tomato). DELICIOUS. This was hand's down one of my favorite dishes of the night. Then came the kale salad, which included slice of apples. The apples were cooked down in a way that made them feel like dessert. This dish was another one of my favorites. For our main entrees, we chose the fried chicken and the bacon-wrapped meatloaf because, seriously, how can you not chose something that's wrapped in bacon? I wasn't the biggest fan of the chicken, but I really enjoyed the meatloaf. As sides, they brought a diverse grouping of field peas, mac and cheese, green cabbage with ham, collards, and cream corn. My favorite from this grouping had to be the field peas--loved the mixture of butter and dill.At this point, we were stuffed but dessert came next and we opted for the chocolate cake and apple pie. In all honesty, this was not the highlight of the night. The dishes were just too large and heavy for me. Maybe I would feel differently if they were smaller portions, but it was a bit overwhelming. Needless to say, we didn't finish them.Revival is a great option if you love Southern cooking. Kevin Gillespie was able to capture his vision for replicating a \\"Southern supper at grandma's house\\". Personally, I prefer Gunshow because it's more on the \\"foodie\\" side, but I did really enjoy my meal.

I hate eating in theme parks. Food is overpriced, subpar and there are rarely any enticing options for vegans. I usually end up eating French fries and then hate myself. And then I'm hungry again an hour later because I'm desperate for something nutritious. We ate lunch around 3pm, taking a break from the crowds and lines at Universal. We were seated immediately in one of the large semi circular booths by the bar, which was nice. It's very open, airy and has an unexpected trendy atmosphere. There's plenty of patio seating as well, though it was a little too chilly that day to dine al fresco. I can see where this would be a cool spot to hang at nighttime (though don't quote me on that, because I have no idea what the crowd would be like). There are not that many vegan options on the menu but you really only need one when the veggie burger is THIS phenomenal. You're reading that right! It is one of the best I've ever had. You'll like it if you don't like the veggie burgers that try to be meat, as this one features actual vegetables and grains and is served nice and crispy on a bun piled high with all that you want on a burger. It really just blew me away. Make sure you go up and enjoy the strange Japanese/English lesson they pipe into the bathrooms. Also, you'll see just how huge this place really is because there's another bar and yet more seating on the third level.They have quite the cocktail list, too (adult milkshakes, if that's your thing).

Nothing. Dessert? Belgian waffles! (What??)It's cramped. It's a mess. It's beyond absurd. It's bonoPIZZA.We parked next to the building that houses the restaurant and opened the eponymously labeled door. And found that this was in fact the BACK door to Bono Pizza. A moment's awkwardness at our mistake was allayed by the pizza chef, who guided us past the diminutive oven to the opposite side of the bar. We migrated to the lone large table once another party left. The four of us had plenty of room there, but we were the only bigger party that could have sat in the dining area. Out of seats? They have lawn chairs. I'm not kidding.No drinks, huh? We walked into the attached store and bought some Tr√∂egs Nugget Nectar.

Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. Every forkful of those dense liege-style waffles blew us to tiny bits before we could count to three. At that moment I offered my services to the kitchen as official Bono plate washer (and by \\"wash\\" I meant with my tongue).We put our dollars down and waddled back out the rear door, fatter and happier for not a lot of money, shocked at how well we'd just eaten at a little hole in the side of a liquor store.It's an experience.

I really thought the first year I ate there the corn was fresh off the cob. I finally got the courage to ask the waitstaff last week and the response was \\"yes it's canned  but the chefs saut√© it in butter first.\\" Yikes I knew it cuz my mom used to open a can of corn for dinner several times a week and well, it just has that really canned flavor and no amount of butter or saut√©ing can hide that!

More Like 'First to Cuisine'.http://www.flickr.com/photos/tatsuuuu/sets/72157624735741785/Within the last year, Boston had it's first and only restaurant serving Dongbei Cuisine, Unique Chinese Food, which is ramping up again in Allston after a brief but brilliant stint in Cambridge. On a vague early-bird tip from Chowhound, I ran over to Golden Garden, because frankly I have Death Star accuracy when it comes to Chinese food. Heck, I've pulled up Google Map street images of strip-mall Chinese places in NJ and sent family members to confirm hunches. No where on the menu does Golden Garden speak of \\"Dongbei\\" and in fact the only specialties proclaimed are Sichuan, this year's hot regional cuisine. (Eh, I'm over it for now.) Wading through several pages of Amero-Sino fare and, yes, you would easily confuse this place for \\"100% takeout\\", funny riff from the CH tip, or a wanna-be sichuan place. Throw on the mala sauce and we're all good, right? Hellz no.Garlic accounts more than chili in Dongbei and the first hint was \\"Cucumber with Fresh Garlic\\" and then \\"Green Bean Noodle with Spicy Sauce\\". The starch noodles made from, yes, green beans, is shared with the Sichuan province, but Cucumbers and Garlic are a distinctively Dongbei starter. I had a silent fist-pump moment to myself and looked up to see the very friendly server, waiting for my order. \\"You're from Dongbei, aren't you?\\" \\"Yes! Are you Korean?\\" \\"Ha ha, no, and I don't need a fork, thank you, but I love your food!\\"Needless to say I did. Dishes you need to try: Cucumber with Garlic (garlic on your breath for hours), Lamb Teriyaki (actually it will be skewers, cumin flavored), Dumplings of any kind, right up there with the many specialists in town, the Vegetable Leek Pie is the best edition I've had so far, the Green Bean Noodles, Sauteed Potato with Sour Sauce, any Offal dish, any Lamb dish, and I wouldn't doubt their technique or interpretation with the Szechuan (Sichuan) section including the classic Jin Gu Fish Fillets. These guys aren't just a new category (for us) of food, they can cook. The warm attentive service is the polar opposite of what you expect from \\"The Cold North\\", another nickname for what is in fact Manchuria. They even carry brown rice, although not sorghum or millet, interesting alternative 'supergrains' (RNA complete proteins) that flourish there.For more information on Manchurian or Dongbei Cuisine, a small snippet published in the Spring 2009 edition of Gastronomica by Prof. Jacqueline M. Newman can be found here:\\nhttp://bit.ly/aRWujc"},{"name":"Sweet Masterpiece Wine Bar & Bistro","address":"922 NW Davis St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Would've been a perfect 10...expect we had a server in training.\\nDon't let that stop you though, the chocolate is still divine!

I still considered this option out of some kind of spiritual culinary duty, but ultimately could not bring myself to do so.Declining that option, we all opted for the combo to avoid having to compromise on choices. The range of options was surprisingly wide, from rolls and nigiri to unagi don and various hot appetizers. The presence of \\"chirashi\\" as an item led me to believe that everything was going to be miniaturized and raised concerns that I might not even have enough food.I was flat-out wrong.Either I'm going soft in my thinner years or the crunchy salmon karaage, mini-chirashi and savory ton katsu was, on top of the miso soup and salad bearing the standard Japanese dresing, far more like a large dinner than a lunch.

I am assuming that they are from friends of the employees or owners that have provided them. I have been a couple times (one bad experience shouldn't stop you from trying again; I used to be in the restaurant industry and think everyone deserves a fair chance), so I went after my first bad experience hoping for the best. That was a mistake... although the server was very friendly, that was the only good thing about the restaurant. Upon entering, the non-smiling host asked if we had reservations. I need to preface that statement with the fact the restaurant was not crowded or busy in the slightest. After letting him know we didn't, we proceeded to be treated with attitude and told that it would be about a 20-30 minute wait (remember, the restaurant was not busy and had entire sections of tables without people in them). Again, I get it, short-staffed, sections closed, etc... life happens, however, that doesn't excuse poor treatment. So, we patiently wait to be seated (we were a party of six as my family was in from out of town and the restaurant was one family member's suggestion). Once seated, the server came to the table about ten minutes after we arrived. Although waiting, she was a delight and very friendly. So, I remembered from the prior experience that I was not a huge fan of the food itself. Odd spice pairings that left something to be desired, warm but not hot food, and lackluster sides. This time I decided to try the ribs. Again, waiting waiting waiting, the food finally arrives and it was okay at best. The seasoning was an issue again, the BBQ sauce choices weren't great, and warm but not hot food, but the worst part was that half of the ribs were so full of fat or over cooked ribs it was inedible. I get it, people have different tastes and that's perfectly fine, I am only speaking from my point of view. I am not a picky eater, I actually rarely cook and always want to root for the local restaurant over the chains, but Barrel and Boar is not one of them. The bright, friendly server became non-existent after our food was delivered and I basically threw half of my food away because I couldn't eat it. For those who love it, great, but I feel it necessary to speak on behalf of those of us who haven't had a great experience and hope it gets remedied for the restaurant's sake. It's a great location, but without some management or staff changes both front and back of the house, I don't know how it can last. Both times I have been, the lack of patrons speaks to this."},{"name":"Cypress Street Pint & Plate","address":"817 W Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I went to cypress for lunch.

The wait staff has their act together way better most places & most who've been there long know me by name.  The early and later Happy Hours.  The pickup window and oft-needed overflow parking across the street.  The fresh ingredients brought in from the owner's farm/garden, along with seasonal heirloom tomato starts.  A large variety of seafood and standard menu items at reasonable prices.Con: I recently stopped for Mon wine tasting and to think about what to do for dinner.  10min into the wine tasting, @3rd of 4 available tastes, I was approached by a blond woman who announced herself as the manager (I had not met before or recognize) and 'We don't allow people to stand there and chat with the wine steward, so if you don't buy a glass or wine or get a table, you're going to have to leave.'  There was no attempt at hospitality or grace, it was emphatic and about Now, the same attitude an unruly drunk would rightly receive.  I was astonished and replied 'In all my decades of coming here I've never been approached like this at any restaurant.'  I was asked again what I'm going to do.  I said 'I'm only on my 3rd of 4 tastings, so don't know what I want to do, can I at least taste all 4?'  She turned and chatted with the wine server while I finished the 3rd & 4th tastes.  She asked again what I'm going to do, again emphasizing the ultimatum.  I said 'I don't know what I'm going to do, I have errands to run before eating and I want to look at the Happy Hour menu for maybe later.'  I picked up a wine drawing entry slip and headed to the bar & reviewed the Happy Hour menu, where I also told the wait staff what happened, my thoughts about it ('If that's kind of hospitality here now, sorry but I won't be back') and filled out the slip.  I handed the slip the the manager on my way out and told her to take me off their emailing list.Some context: The wine server is not an employee, but an outside distributor or winery rep, who's job includes casually explaining the wine, exchanging perceptions and creating a relaxed tasting - tastings aren't slamming events.  She wasn't part of the exchange.  There were no other people at the tasting station and on occasion there's been 8+ people tasting, so crowding was not an issue.  I've never seen management approach anyone at their tasting event.  I have on occasion bought up to a bottle of wine from the tasting and had dinner there with it.Bottom line: Outrageous hospitality, inexcusable and a shame because otherwise I like the place. I'll be telling my homeowner friends in the neighborhood about this and won't be back.

I'm a pretty big guy and I just had a killer workout so I decided to reward/replenish myself w/their \\"Menace II Society.\\" The very pleasant young lady behind the window let me know that it'd be a little while, 10-12 minutes, because there were a few sandwiches ordered before mine. Fine by me. I'd been waiting days for this thing. She called out my order quicker than I expected and due to the in climate weather, I decided to walk as fast as I could home to devour my breakfast. It was fantastic. I've been making my own BB's for years and I judge a professionally made one by whether or not I'd be able to easily recreate it or not. Technically, I could, but the wide variety of ingredients would make it very impractical. It had everything you could want. Granted, I did douse it in hot sauce, so that might be my only piece of constructive criticism. I noticed a jar of Sriracha there, so NBD. I have a pretty huge appetite and this put me in my place. Easily could've been two meals for most folks. Not only was the food fantastic, but the service, and price were great as well. I can't wait to consume the rest of the menu.

I have two grandmothers from the south and grew up eating soul food. In other words, I love fried chicken. Sorry Grandma, but South City Kitchen has THE best fried chicken I have ever tasted in my life. I mean that. My wife and I visited Atlanta and decided that South City Kitchen would be dinner on Friday night. I made a great choice. After reading so many reviews on the fried chicken, I decided to see what the hype was about. The chicken is marinated for a full day and then brined. After that it's fried golden brown. The seasoning was on point. One sink of your teeth into it will provide a burst of juiciness, a wave of carefully crafted flavor and a delightful crunch of flaky, crispy crust. Perfection on a plate is what I call it. If there is one recommendation I have, it's too order the fish without the jus. There is nothing worse than wet chicken crust. The collard greens were seasoned just right. They were not soggy or too crunchy. They were a great consistency and texture in my book. The cornbread with real corn kernels made for a great pairing. I can't even remember what my wife ordered, but I do remember tasting it and saying how delicious it was. All I know is, once we made out back to Texas, she told me, \\"I can't wait to go back to Atlanta to get some more of that chicken\\"!The chef when came out and chatted with us for a few minutes. She recommended Antico Pizza for lunch, which was awesome and will be my next review. She was very hospitable.

The lemon curd fritters looked pretty darn good at the next table and I was tempted, but knew it would be too much food. The food was excellent and the portions were outrageous! Really no one person should eat that much food! The chicken was meaty with a peppery breading that paired well with the syrup. The sweet potato base made an otherwise standard waffle a step up and it was very tasty! The biscuit on my husband's order with thick and fluffy and the sausage gravy perfect!

Fajita Feast ($36) - while there is plenty of meat (they got the chicken, steak, and shrimp), the quality of the food was poor. The steak was cooked VERY well done, and had little flavor. The sides for the fajitas were extremely small (about 1/2 cup of rice and 1/2 cup of beans to share). Steak Salad ($17)- Essentially just lettuce with slices of steak on top. Like the steak from the Fajitas, the steak was very overcooked and extremely tough to chew. This sounds silly, but I literally left the meal with a sore jaw.

We had a great dinner there last week. Actually the best kind of dinner, which is \\"order one of everything on the menu.\\" We did just that (and two of some things!) for our group of eight. After a few strike outs, we were delighted to find that Wink and Nod could accommodate our large group for a walk-in on Weds night. The ambiance was cool and dim, quiet enough to hear each other but not awkwardly empty. (We noticed a lot of swipe right situations around us, seems like a good place for a second or third date on a weeknight.)We were celebrating with a gluten-free gal, so you can imagine our delight when we learned that EVERYTHING on the menu was gluten free - even the calamari, made with tapioca batter! (As one of the fortunate gluten-tolerant folks, I can assure you that nothing was weird and I wouldn't have noticed it was gluten free.) Highlights for us were probably the cauliflower gratin and the chicken (though we were disappointed by the chicken's serving size, one leg for $28). We also loved the mushrooms and the brussel sprouts. The flank steak and other dishes I'm failing to remember were all fine. The only dish that wasn't scraped clean was a frisee-heavy salad. Everything was exceptionally flavorful and I would certainly return if the same group was going to be in the kitchen.My only word of caution, I'd stick to wine (or whisky!), as my last review from ~four years ago seems to still be accurate re: cocktails. The ones my friends had were all made with great intentions, but often fell a little flat and some were just too sweet."},{"name":"Masa","address":"439 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I adore this funky southwestern restaurant in the South End.

Full stop. It's available on Wednesdays and Saturdays. It's so good, that I almost don't go on days other than those. That being said, the chicken mole and the pollo fantastico are also amazing.The atmosphere is fun and the service is quick (except for lunch) and friendly. The only downside is that there is almost always a shortage of parking.I really appreciate the whole wheat flour tortillas--it's hard to find places that offer that.The salsas are amazing. In particular, the do√±a is one of the best salsas I've ever had. It looks green and creamy like it might just be a cilantro cream sauce, but it's deceptively hot and delicious. I'd buy it by the quart if I could.My last suggestion is that you should get 3 tacos instead of the blue plate special (which is 2 tacos, rice, beans and a small salad). I find that the price is about the same, but that the third taco is more food and tastier than rice, beans and salad."},{"name":"Zabu Chicken","address":"1635 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Great selection of chicken dishes.

We arrived around 7 PM and had no trouble getting a table. Our waitress was very nice and attentiveThe venue is very hip. There are large tables that can seat 4-5 people, as well as couple smaller tables and seats at the bar. The food was a truckload of smoky, meaty heaven. We ordered the \\"Serves 4 Souls\\" set which, as the name suggests, is meant to serve 4 people. Let me tell you that this could comfortably feed 5 hungry eaters! Three of us ended up bringing home leftovers. Not one of us left with even a millimeter of empty belly after that meal.The cornbread was probably my favorite part. However, for the diehard carnivores, the ribs and pulled pork were the winning meat selections of the evening. I thought the chicken was very tender, but nothing that special. I hate super-soft pasta in my Mac n' Cheese, so this one was pretty underwhelming. All of the sauces are mild except (of course) the Fiery sauce. That one left a distinct burn on the tongue for a few seconds.

Go here!It's right next to Lake Davis in the upscale Thornton Park area, ten minutes from the downtown hype. Very peaceful. You can eat and walk down to the lake and watch the HUGE geese block the suburban traffic.If you love outdoor seating and lounging about then this is for you. Almost the entire place is outside (only three or four tiny tables inside and inside is small). They have generic drinks (sodas, water) and then they have specialty bottled beer that you can buy as singles. It's a good place to go if you want to try a new beer but not buy a six pack. It's animal friendly so a lot of people have their pets laying out with them on the patio. They also have a hipster vibe with posters up inside of upcoming art events and fliers from locals laying around. The people who work there walk around with no dress code and tattoos showing but its a carefree vibe. The parking is terrible - maybe ten parking spots at most (a few in front and a few in back). They have street parking around Lake Davis which is across the street if they run out of space.The food was healthy and reasonably priced. The menu has super cheap breakfast prices but I went for lunch. I had the 903 Market Chicken Wrap and it was good and huge. It had mango, pecans, bleu cheese on spring mix and, outside of being almost too sweet, it had the right amount of crunch and contrast with the cheese and the sweet fruit.Only thing Im conflicted on is Im not sure why people should leave tips because they dont have a waitress - the lady who rings you up hands you the food, you fill your own drinks and then you throw your food away like in a fast food joint."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Great vibe and fantastic food.

My co-workers and I would take a leisurely lunch, pick up sandwiches, and head to the nearby lake to lounge and de-stress on our lunch hour.  Good times.So, when the hubs suggested we stop by 903 Mills Market for breakfast/brunch this past Sunday, I was excited to revisit this great spot.  This gem of a shop is nestled in its neighborhood locale, and offers a family (and pet) friendly venue, with indoor and outdoor seating.We started our visit with some 903 Queso and tortilla chips.  Sometimes, queso is queso...but I really enjoyed the great mix of flavors in 903‚Ä≤s special cheese and salsa blend.  I would definitely get this again!The hubs chose an omelito.  This pressed burrito wrap contained eggs, peppers, sausage, onions and cheese.  He also ordered a \\"potato cake\\" (hash brown).I chose the \\"Crazy Bird\\" sandwich.  Hot turkey, bacon, melted cheddar cheese, lettuce and mayo on sourdough bread usually make up this sandwich, but since we were having breakfast/brunch I added an egg.  Really enjoyed this.  You can choose your bread and customize your sandwich options as well.They carry a large selection of beverages and had a small case of cookies and cupcakes available.P.S.

So far, as I'm writing this review, i've been there more than once and it is crazy busy but the line is not as long as the farmers market though. They do offer like more bakery items and espresso drinks in addition to their bagels. The problem I have is that it takes forever for the line to move. Both times, i've waited more than 15 minutes just standing but people doesn't seem to be ordering extensive orders. They definitely need a better system of taking orders and making the line moves fast. That has definitely been one of the reasons I haven't gone back.

We got the beef tataki and crispy duck mooshi for appetizers. The latter was particularly good - you wrap your own duck crepes with avocado, sauce, and other toppings.  Our group got a sushi boat and samplers to share. Everything was incredibly fresh including the uni and well presented. The fish were well cut and there were some interesting pairings like nigiri with lightly seared toro with olive oil and microgreens. The dessert wasn't excuted as well as everything else; the matcha crepe cake edges were dry and the cream filling was reduced probrably from sitting in the fridge. It came with ice cream and fruit and was good but would have been excellent if the cake was fresh.

Nota Bene: nothing is perfect, but Yelp doesn't offer scoring of quarters or halves so be it.In my cross-country odyssey for some of the best BBQ the states have to offer, I would have to say that Franklin's BBQ in Austin is by far the best I've experienced to date, if not just for the food but the entire experience.My fellow cohorts and I walked from our hotel through some parts of the \\"hood\\" to our destination and arrived around 8:30.  The place did not open until 11am.  We were still about 10th in line with some of the customers already sitting in their picnic chairs on the stairs leading to the 2-story shack of a restaurant.  We were greeted with cans of popular local beers on ice...it was early, but what the hell.I recon'd the small place...hidden smoke pit behind some bushes, nice little picnic area on the 2nd floor right outside the entrance with BBQ sauce bottles with no labels (nice touch).  I walked inside and asked if I could order a soda.  They said Yelp yourself to the soda fountain machine with no charge (extra brownie point).  One of the cooks came by and told me they'd be a little late with the meat, since they had a late night gig.  Yes, they are apparently all wanna-be musicians.I walked over to \\"The Chair Guy\\" across the street, an interesting unemployed self-entrepreneur that hawks pink picnic chairs with small umbrellas for rent at $5 a piece.  The line started getting longer.  By 9:30 it was overflowing through the parking lot, and within fifteen minutes, people were standing and waiting around the next block.  It was quite unreal.  I have pics to prove it!The place finally opened, and we walked in. The BBQ smell hit us immediately through the opened doors, as we walked up the stairs.  Waiting in line and hearing the loud chatter ahead of us was exciting.  T-shirts on the shelved walls were for sale at the usual tourist prices.  Getting up to the counter (TIP: be nice to the cutter...s/he decides what cuts of meat you will be eating and paying for...and at $15+ a lb).Ordered 1/2 lb of brisket, 1 lb of beef rib (one rib) and 1/2 lb of turkey.  The brisket was unreal.  Melt in your mouth was an understatement...even with the layer of fat, but at those prices..who cares.  The charred salt/pepper dry rub was lovingly covered with the nice carmelized cider/juice spray.  It was like how BBQ was meant to be. The 1 lb of beef rib was a bit much...the fat layer was a bit too thick.  It was like biting into a nice tender piece of prime rib with all the fat and but then too much...could not finish.  Turkey was as tender and flavorful as I ever had.  The brisket though...wow...when they pulled it out of the warming oven to cut, it had that wonderful, slightly curved bend in it when picked up like it was perfectly ready...and it was...damn...but...Be sure they charge you the correct poundage of meat (note earlier TIP re the cutter) or you might get slightly overcharged like I was.Overall, the best damn BBQ I've had...better than La BBQ (nice sister-bbq trailer break off also in Austin) and definitely better than Kansas City....  Dirty, nasty, rude and loud Arthur Bryant's BBQ that was beyond dry and drenched in sauce...also the Arthur fries were a joke; forget the overpriced chain-wanna-be-like Fiorella's Jack Stack BBQ, and the quick, rude, order-your-shit-n-go gas station Oklahoma Joe's BBQ in Kansas City.I would wait another 2.5 hrs and then some with the nice experience I received at Franklin's BBQ just to come back over those others...and, oh, their amazing, mouth-watering brisket."},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"At 6pm they allow you sit in the cafe and order off the dinner menu.

I honestly believe that the higher star reviews must be planted by insiders because unless you're a child I just don't see how you could've really enjoyed the show and the food.To begin with, as soon as you arrive you realize you're going to get ripped off.  The first hint of that is their attempt to charge you $3 to park.  Huh? Really?  Yup but we drove right into a spot and never paid.  Purchasing your ticket is where the real fun begins...$25 upgrade for this, $7 upgrade for that, etc, etc.  We, thankfully, didn't pay for any upgrades and took the standard ticket with the standard food.  ANY UPGRADES ARE A WASTE OF MONEY NO MATTER HOW THEY TRY TO \\"SELL\\" YOU ON IT. For the pre-show, there is a cash bar which is probably why they tell you to get there so early...so you spend more money at the bar.  It's certainly not for the pass around food because that was pure crap...chicken wings, meatball, vegetables and cut up chicken fingers all courtesy of your local frozen food section.So they seat you by color and this where the fun begins.  We ask for our beer and are told they stopped including beer around 3 months ago, even though the brochures and advertisements all claimed that it was included.  There's no sign or anything by the ticket window announcing this so we speak to our waiter.  He gives us a little wink and says if you complain to the manager, he'll include it.  Miraculously, without the manager ever coming over 2 pitchers of beer arrive.  The whole thing stinks like BS and I believe they're simply trying to rip off the tourists who are too timid to complain.The food is terrible but I honestly didn't expect much.  I guess it actually wasn't even as terrible as I thought it would be...Yay!Now for the show...it was actually pretty good for kids and the actors all try really hard.  If it wasn't for them, I would've given this 0 stars.  It's boring for adults but I can honestly say that my 10 year old loved it and was picked to go on stage.

Up until this fall, I loved the Border Cafe for these very virtues. Fabulous, not overly-sweet margaritas, oh-so-fresh deep fried tortilla chips, amazing corn and black bean empanadas with red pepper sauce that makes me drool even in a fleeting thoughts. Kind staff. Efficiency. Everyone leaves happy and full. This fall, a group of friends met around 5:30 PM at the Border Cafe bar, ready to celebrate a birthday. In our quest to arrange a table (which, for the record, took over 2 hours), my dear friend was introduced to the new owner of the restaurant chain. He explained his quest to \\"healthify\\" the restaurant. Most noticeably, the chips were of a lower quality (less deep-fried, which is indeed healthier) and the margaritas went from a quality crafted drink to what tastes like a melted frozen margarita bucket. They were so sweet I could hardly finish my first drink. The bartenders receive props for this evening, because as we spent over two hours waiting for a table at the bar, we requested less sweet margaritas and they crafted a finely fresh-lime squeezed margaritas. Who does NOT receive props is the new owner. Upon making the comment to him that we weren't fond of the new drink mixture, he said, \\"well, maybe you should drink more then it wouldn't really matter, would it?\\" Inappropriate? Unquestionably. I'm still in mourning of the Border cafe of past. The corn and black bean empanadas with that mouth watering red pepper sauce are still blessedly the same, but the spirit of the restaurant is gone for me, with leadership prepared to take advantage of what he assumes is a clientele with apathetic tastebuds, only patronizing the restaurant to get drunk."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I was pretty jazzed when I found this place just around the corner from my hotel, but it was pretty disappointing. There were lots of super creative-looking hot dogs on the menu and maybe I just didn't order the right one, but my Whoa Nelly (hot dog topped with brisket and BBQ sauce) was not very good at all. The dog itself was unimpressive, the brisket was not flavorful, and the sauce was cloyingly sweet.

I'm from San Francisco.  I grew up eating Dim Sum.  I moved to Boston in August and so far have generally been disappointed by the quality of the Dim Sum here.  Until that is, I found Hei La Moon.  This place competes with the very best Dim Sum places in SF both in terms of the quality of the dishes as well as the price (about $10 per person).  For the uninitiated:  prepare to wait in line for a long time before you get seated; prepare for the waitstaff not speaking english (they don't really need to since 90% of the clientele are chinese anyway); prepare to eat things without knowing ahead of time what's in it.  Warning: If your idea of good chinese food is sweet and sour chicken, egg rolls and pot-stickers, you better stick to places that specialize in those things because you'll probably be disappointed by all the chicken feet and tripe.For Dim Sum afficionados:  try to show up early if possible, because after about 12:30 the variety of dishes starts to decline (we showed up at 12 and there were no more char siu bau); also, if you like fried turnip cake: unfortunately it's a little mushy here, but it's worth forgoing this one dish because all the others are so phenomenal."},{"name":"Alden & Harlow","address":"40 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"The menu is brief, but challenging due to extreme creativity.

The pork belly was only okay, with too few grits to make an impression, but the macerated grapes were a delicious enhancement. My favorite dishes were the most filling, an angel hair pasta with a nutty pesto sauce, and a roasted potato side with a rich cream sauce.

Apparently they have been coming to this place over and over, and I can see why.It was a mildly busy Sunday today, but our party of 5 was seated pretty quickly. While waiting in the entrance area, we thought it felt pretty loud, but after we sat down (further into the restaurant but not in the basement), it was a perfect mix of lively atmosphere and audibility of your conversation. It took a little while for our food to come out, during which we hopelessly overate on their chips and great salsa. But when it finally arrived, it was actually hot and surprisingly well-made. Certainly this place is \\"not special\\" as other reviewers said, but I appreciated how these were the type of \\"simple dishes well made\\" which I love so much in home-cooking. Personally I think there is nothing greater than that. We had a blackened chicken fajita with rice & beans, a blackened catfish fajita with jambalaya, and something else which I have now forgotten. Both fajitas were delicious - the tortillas are soft and warm, and the meats well-seasoned and juicy. I had guacamole for my fajita but sauces were totally not necessary because everything else tasty enough on its own. Only the jambalaya was a little bland, but that is alright. It also appears that their lemon margaritas are pretty nice.Service was average, but it's not like you would come here for that.

We ordered a supreme pizza and mozz sticks. Mozzarella sticks are good. The supreme pizza had a decently tasting filling. But the crust leaves a lot to desire.

Not joking or exaggerating when I say there were consistent areas of pepperoni that were stacked 8-10 deep on top of each other. \\nWe ordered this to-go. I asked them to make half supreme and the other half pepperoni.

All of it was steamed and soggy and tasteless.  No sauces were ever offered, we finally got some off a service cart.  We tried nearly everything on the cart, and mostly found it to be partially cooked and soggy sausages, shrimp that was tasteless, and salty fried rice as well as some uneatable gray meat that was mostly bones and gristle.

I'm not sure if service was a bit slow and unfriendly because they were so busy during their openning time but I was getting antsy waiting to get my orders in, drinks, and food. Maple Praline Bacon: bacon with maple and coat with nuts. It was good but I've had better and felt that the bacon can be a bit more crisp. 4/5Waffle and Chicken: Giant pieces of chicken (3) on top of a waffle. It was quite intimidating when the plate arrived. Crispy chicken, however, it was a bit bland and dry.  The waffle was good but nothing special. 3/5Farm Grits: warm and savory cheesy grits with poached eggs on top. I found the extra giant piece of ham in the plate a bit distracting. I think if it was a thicker ham chopped into smaller pieces would be easier to eat.

I've eaten 3 different burgers from their menu, as well as their fries and their onion strings.  Overall, the food I've eaten here has been good.  The burgers hot and juicy, the friest and onions crispy.\\nThe onion burger is absolutely delicious.  Perhaps their caramelized onions could stand a bit less sugar added, but the sandwich has a ton of flavor and it works.\\nThe blue collar is battered and fried with honey mustard.  The batter is sweet, and goes surprisingly well with the burger and honey mustard flavors, though I would've liked more honey mustard.\\nThe third burger I had was the mushroom burger.  It was the least impressive of the three, particularly because I ordered an onion burger and received this instead, despite thrice confirming that i had ordered an onion burger.   I'm pretty sure the mushrooms came from a can - which isn't really awful, but I'm not partial to canned shrooms.  The cheese was nice and melted, though, and the burger cooked nicely so that it was still a bit pink and juicy.\\nI said that I ordered an onion burger, though.  I mentioned this on twitter once i got home.  i found out that tasty burger has a twitter presence @tastyburgerusa.  This led me to believe that they read and address customer complaints.  Perhaps I am spoiled by Boloco's John Pepper, but I digress.  I would've just brushed off the lack of reply as the company or owners as not paying much attention to twitter, but they have tweeted a few times since my complaint, the first tweet only three minutes later.  After reading some of the other reviews, I do not expect to receive much in the way of friendly and helpful customer service.\\nSince Tasty Burger is so close to my house, I might still go back.  The first time I went, they had gotten my brother's order wrong - forgetting the bacon he asked for - but they made up for it by comping his burger.  Overall I'm not unhappy with the place, and their recipes are inspired and delicious. I want to try the rest of the menu, including the \\"all the way\\" hot dog, which is 1/2 pound with two burger patties, chile, and cheese.  wow.\\nif these guys shape up the customer service a bit i might change my review to four or five stars.  the burgers i've had when they got my order right were definitely worth the money.  oh.  and beer!i've since gone back to tasty burger a few times.  i still think the food is delicious, but it's hit or miss.  sometimes it's awesome, sometimes its just bland.  it's never awful, though.  but there is still something lacking in the customer service.  for a brand new place, i'd expect a lot more charm.  are the employees at the window already so jaded with their jobs in the fast food service that they can't offer a little hospitality?  i'll still eat there.  it's so close to my home.  and it is usually tasty."},{"name":"The Oakwood Canadian Bistro","address":"2741 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This place is meant for a group of friends.

The fajitas (I got the one with blackened chicken) was tasty but then again, I usually am not too picky about my fajitas.  When it's warm and sizzling and placed right in front of you with a beautiful plate of condiments, who can resist, even if the taste is just above average?We went around lunchtime and were in and out within an hour.

My usual gripe with miso ramen broth is that the main flavor profile is usually just salt, but this.... oh this was so much more. The noodles were again, cooked to perfection.

It overlooks Bicentennial park with great views of the Scioto Mile Fountain.  The Fountain was off given that its gotten a tad chilly, but it is still just as beautiful.  Since the restaurant is all glass and is circular in shape, it provides a great view no matter where you sit.Okay enough about the location...(although this alone has convinced me to come again when its warm so I can sit outside and enjoy the views!)Even with a fairly large party of 10, our food came quite quickly!  I ended up ordering the Christian's Eggs Benedict even though I only recently started eating eggs again (long story, but I couldn't eat eggs for the longest time due to a traumatizing experience getting sick on them as a child).  I've never had poached eggs, but OMG the eggs on top of the cheddar biscuit was delicious!  The only thing I didn't like about my meal was that the collard greens were really salty.The other members of my party ordered Eggs Benedict, Belgian Waffles, Huevos Rancheros, and French Toast.

AAH MAH GAWD! Boy does it live up to the \\"best-BBQ-on-the-entire-planet\\" hype. Although Franklin's opens it's doors at 11AM, I was informed by a true Austinite well before my trip that I would need to be in line by 9:45AM to be guaranteed food. I √ºber'd from my hotel and made it by 10AM - lucky enough to be TWO people in line before the cut off or \\"last man standing\\" (as is Franklin's tradition). Last man standing is also known as the last person in line to be guaranteed meat. You are welcome to wait after that person but you run the risk of not getting fed. Being told at 10AM that you won't eat until 3PM led many to abandon the cause. Especially those, like myself, unprepared for the long wait, sans folding chair and cooler of beverages/snacks. Luckily, a kind Texan took me under his wing and offered me an extra chair and a beer (complete with koozie). This bonding and waiting, waiting and bonding is all part of the Franklin BBQ experience! Franklin's trusty staff checked on us sporadically, selling cold beers and fielding questions about the BBQ (i.e. \\"What type of of wood does Franklin's use?\\" Answer: Oak!) And then, for those even considering giving up at the halfway point, they presented their secret weapon: sausage samples! \\"Sausage wraps\\" = a nice chunk of juicy, flavorful sausage wrapped in a piece of white bread. I never expected this to be so amazingly delicious. If there was ever a doubt about the wait, that tasty morsel solidified my steadfastness.By the time my newfound friends and I approached the counter to order, we felt like giddy children awaiting santa. I was beyond THRILLED to find they had not yet run out of ribs and I was able to order the ribs/brisket combo plate. They'll ask how you like your brisket (more fatty or more lean). Not to fret should you not know, they'll gladly give you a bit of both! Colleagues and friends urged me to try their signature espresso/molasses sauce so I did. It was very good. Very very good. But the thing is, this meat is so tender, so juicy and flavorful. Just downright delicious on its own that it doesn't require a thing! I did enjoy some of my brisket on bread with pickles though.

She was quite good and she was very welcoming of the Armenian and other patrons who were eager to share the dance floor.

He was super helpful and very friendly. They had beers and some cocktails here. I snagged one of each. The cocktail was fantastic. The beer was good. As I mentioned in my previous room it's cool to see an eatery like this that serves well made cocktails as well. That's not why you come here though. You come here for the Bocadillo de Lomo, which is rotisserie pork loin, griddled manchego, caramelized onion, and romesco. It's pork loin is stewed in chicken broth for over 24 hours!

Made fresh daily they sell them for $0.80 a piece, but catch Lan or her daughter in a good mood close to closing time and they'll play \\"Let's Make A Deal!\\".  Sometimes negotiations get intense, but we always end up laughing since it's all fun and games.  They don't like to waste food and are always willing to offer a deal as opposed to throwing good food away.   Not only are the egg rolls quite awesome, but Lan's spicy fish sauce is so tasty.  I'm not typically a fan of nuoc cham or nuoc mam, but their daughter told me to try it since it's homemade and I was floored.  It wasn't as fishy, had a spicy kick to it, and it was salty yet tasty.  Great for dipping I always ask for it now.  And on a final note:  Lan makes the best damn Pho I have ever had.  It's not on the menu, but I asked about Pho one day and she offered it make some for me and my mom.  I was so impressed w/ how tasty it was, their daughter told me it was MSG-free - - no way!!!

Little Woodrows is very much located off Slaughter, West of I-35 - but in the South Park Meadows shopping complex, so I suppose that's where this address comes from. Confusing. Meh.Okay, what I love about this place: I win here. Me + Beer + Washers = Happy Me. If I'm playing in the dark at THIS Little Woodrow's location, I can't lose. It's been proven over and over and over and has almost led to a divorce. If we play at Red's I suck... in my back yard, I suck. But here, I'm gold. I have also never paid for a drink here... because I drink here with my husband. But it's still cool to say. And still a win for me. This joint supports local art - at the bidding of local radio. And then I win things. Little Woodrow's South Park Meadows was one of a number of bars who hosted a live painting competition for Blue Moon sponsored by 101x where artists showed up and painted on site, under a time limit, according to the criteria, then by a popular vote, one winner was awarded, and the top three for the night moved on in a vote-based competition. It was an amazing experience to participate in, but the best impression I got from it was the bar's willingness to host & accommodate artists - with our prima donna attitudes, with our angst, with our sloshy, spilly oil paints on their tables and fire pits. They were great. Other than that event, I've frequented the bar a lot over the past year. The manager is extremely involved and very customer-service oriented. The girls can be moody - but what do you expect in a bar completely staffed with chicks in their 20's. Every once in a while there's going to be a hybrid episode of Jersey Shore meets The Wannabe Housewives of South Austin / North Buda. That's just how chick drama goes. That aside, I've never had a probelm with price, with service, with an overall experience. Food is available of the pizza nature, supplied by an adjoining restaurant, but you can order it right there at your table. Overall - 3 stars for general staisfaction, 5 stars because I won a grand after competing in that art event,  and I LOVE that they support the local arts in general. 3 stars for general staff; 5 stars for the manager. 5 stars for having washer pits & pool, but 3 stars for overall environment on the inside, which is kinda spread out with ginormous booths and not exactly great group-seating environment when it comes for comfort. My brain says that averages to 4 stars.

The poor residents of the street next to Fox brothers have to endure Fox Brother's customers parallel park all along their street. This is a HUGE pet peeve of mine when Atlanta restaurants don't factor enough parking spots for their restaurant and intrude on the neighborhoods. At least offer valet for god sakes.2. We arrived at 1:40 on a Saturday and still had to wait 20 minutes. If I'm waiting 20 minutes for BBQ (given the variety of BBQ places in Atlanta), this better be FANTASTIC bbq. Sadly, it was not (read on).2. I got the Pulled Pork plate and the pork was BARELY pulled. It was basically chunks of pork. I also got the mac and cheese side which was good but the Brunswick stew was the worst I've had in all of Atlanta. None of the ingredients in the sides seemed fresh. Everything looked like it was made out of canned goods (corn, green beans, etc)To sum it up, there are better places in Atlanta to eat BBQ.

That said, nothing prepared me for coming by on a Saturday morning near opening time and seeing a line that was more than 4 hours long (and probably the back fifth or so was told that they were outta luck). So my fiancee and I made plans to get there by 8:30 AM on Sunday - surely there would be more people hung over from partying it up Saturday night, right? Wrong - the line was even longer earlier, with our projected serving time being in the 1-1:15 PM range. That's pretty insane, but people here are devoted - there's even a guy renting out lawn chairs for you to sit on (which I was very grateful for). It was nice that, after opening but while we were still waiting, we all got a sample of the delicious sausage that is made in-house, but nothing beats actually getting your plate of food (and a local craft in a chilled glass) after waiting nearly 5 hours.Given the insane amount of time people are willing to wait for the 'cue, it's no surprise that, at least of the meats available at the time (they had run out of turkey and pulled pork by then), they were incredibly delicious and by far the best BBQ I've been privileged to enjoy. Both the brisket and the ribs are by far the best I've had. The brisket gets all the attention; you can get either a lean cut or (my recommendation) the juicy, fatty slices, but both just fall apart as you cut into them, and the fat just adds loads of flavor to it. The meat on the ribs also just falls right off - easily the most succulent ribs I've seen - and the rub on the meat is delicious, with a bit of spice and a good dose of pepper as well. I loaded both up with the sweeter BBQ sauce available, both of which added a nice dash of flavor to what is already healthfully-seasoned meat. As for the sides - to be honest, not really anything special. The slaw is pretty standard, and works well as a lighter side to the heaviness of all the meat. The potato salad is indistinguishable from your garden-variety version from a deli, but the beans are the best side here, as they're laced with some of that smoked beef that adds a nice punch of flavor.Is the food here delicious? Yes, absolutely so. That said, the line seems to be even longer than it was in some postings I read across the Internet...it's not something I'd do in-person that often. If you live nearby, ordering a ton of meat for pickup seems like the smartest way to go. That said, it's something doing at least once, and definitely bring a group of friends, some lawn chairs, and a few beers to keep yourself entertained while you enjoy the sunrise from the parking lot next to Franklin's."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I'm dating myself but I remember when this was the Oxford Ale House.

The food is so much better than any other Japanese restaurants in the area - Symphony Sushi, Ichiban Yakitori and many more of those pretty sub-par sushi restaurants on Newbury. I had always passed Sushiemon without giving it a second thought and I am so glad that I decided to go in one day for a bowl of udon. The place is very small, and I'm quite sure that the owners/chefs are actually Japanese (which is quite uncommon surprisingly for many \\"Japanese\\" places in Boston). The food is simple and very true to original Japanese flavors. Although they do have fusion rolls on the menu, they don't drench it with some mayo sauce to mask all the flavors of real sushi. I would continue to rave about the place, but it's such a gem that I don't want the place to be too busy for me to not get a table whenever I want...

The food is decent - fresh, well-prepared, if not inspiring or adventurous. Service was professional, courteous and responsive. The coffee leaves a bit to be desired. Visiting in part on recommendation, and certainly in light of favorable pricing and placement (quite close to the Hyne's  convention center station on the green line), expectations were tempered. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a soft spoken gentleman in traditional black and white server's dress, and offered a table by the window (we still had our bags from the airport). The place filled up quickly, but service kept apace and while it was lively, it never became raucous. The actual food and drink, though, hit a less pleasing middle ground. The cappuccini came out more like latte; the cheddar jalapeno biscuit breakfast sandwich was flavorful but without bite; the potatoes served alongside the eggs and ham were decently seasoned but had a denser texture and less lively onion than one might expect from large-dice hash browns and the small-dice fruit salad left a little bit wanting in the melon department (though the blueberries were excellent). The eggs were without fault, though, and the general presentation was respectable - despite my inability to photograph it well. Kudos to the young woman who waited on us for finding me fresh jalapeno to accompany my breakfast - the kitchen seemed surprised by the request, but she was back with one sliced and ready to go in no time.

It was a huge piece of meat with no bone. Now I know most of you must be wondering what I'm complaining about but if you know Southern food, they never serve fried chicken without the bone it, that's what keeps it moist and adds flavor. The chicken was dry and tasteless, the same went for most of the other food we ordered (sides and an app). We left most of the food on our plates.

They had nigiri with shrimp, salmon and tuna. Delish. They also had a bunch of Chinese fair. However the rice was really good, hibachi style with just the egg and carrots. The chinese stuff was okay, not my thing. But then, like the fatso I am I also came back for hibachi. The service was good, the hibachi man was great and entertaining (though he did have us catch food in our mouths which I HATE). I have to say the hibachi food wasn't that good in my opinion.

The swordfish was over seasoned, the fish and chips were cod instead of halibut (it was halibut season and the high price would warrant halibut).  The steak, clam chowder, and crawfish ettouffe was good. The food seemed very chain quality, but with a nicer presentation.  The restaurant was very busy by 6:30 on a Wednesday and also quite loud.

And being the Mississippi boy I am, that is quite the accomplishment.  :-DHad a small group, so we ordered the Pit-boss BBQ Sampler, which was (1) smoked beef sausage, (2-3) fried chicken wings, (2) sweet and spicy wings, (2) bbq spare ribs, a half-rack of baby back ribs, a small portion of cubed beef, and a small portion of pulled pork.  You also got little side samples, almost like dipping sauce cup sizes of the side - which included: beans, cole slaw, potato salad, mac-n-cheese, collard greens, and 2 good sized pieces of cornbread.I LOVED everything off the meat plate, and by plate I mean pizza dish with a cookie sheet on top of it (which is how all the plates are).  My favorite being the spare ribs.  They had a nice char on the outside, but were still good and tender.  Nice dry rub coated on top of them, and you had a choice of sauces to poor over them as well, I went with the Pit-Boss  bbq sauce, which is a spin on traditional (tomato based) BBQ sauce.  It was perfection together.The fried chicken wings were fantastic, so I can only imagine the fried chicken platter (with full size chicken pieces - lol) is just as amazing.The pulled pork has a nice flavor, and was very tender.  I couldn't decide between the pit-boss and the sweet sauce for the pulled pork, pitt-boss had a good flavor, but wasn't sweet enough to really highlight the pork... and the sweet was a bit tangy, so it kind or 'overwhelmed' the pork.  I did a mix of both and it gave it a good flavor - but honestly the pork is good on its own too.My only complaint, really corrected itself.  When we were first seated the lady promptly took our drink orders (but they had home made sweet tea - Fantastic!!).  When she brought our drinks back she said our server would be right with us.  We waited a few moments then another female came by to asked if we had put in our orders yet, we replied we were still waiting to order, and she informed us she would grab our server.\\nA few minutes later... the same female who took our drink orders, came back for our food orders... and things finally got rolling and no more problems.Other then the initial delay for placing an order, service was great.

The restaurant itself is beautiful  and the view is spectacular.  We had a reservation and were promptly seated at a table right next to the floor to ceiling window.  Our waitress greeted us promptly and took our drink order right away. When she returned with two generous glasses of Chardonay ($8 each) she explained a bit about the menu and told us about the nightly specials.  We ended up ordering a tomato and mozzarella salad to share, the pretzel bread.  I had the pulled pork pizza and my partner had the Ohio walleye.  The pretzel bread and salad came out within a few minutes.  The bread was exactly what you would expect, warm, delicious and just the right amount of crunchy pretzel salt.  Without us even asking she split the tomato salad.  It was plenty to share each of us had 3 or 4 slices of tomato, and an equal number of slices of tasty fresh mozzarella.  The tomatos looked great for it being so late in the season.  The salad tasted good, but the tomatoes were very vinegary almost like they were marinated in some sort of salad dressing to the point where the tomato flavor didn't come through at all.  The walleye was a nice generous portion and was perfectly cooked.  The \\"creamed corn\\" was more whole kernels of corn with some peppers and other extras kind of mixed in.  There was also a puree of some sort on the plate that we couldn't quite figure out.  The asparagus was well cooked and tasty.  Overall the dish was good, but not great.  The pulled pork pizza was reminiscent of the ubiquitous bbq chicken pizza on every menu, but the sauce was tasty and the crust nice and crunchy.  The pulled pork was a nice change of pace.  Overall the food was solid, the service attentive, and the atmosphere was just great.

The actual dog is somewhat forgettable. Its not particularly tasty and is on par with what you could get at a food truck or street stand. They say its Vienna all beef dogs, so I'll take them at their word. Where they excel is in their toppings, which surpass all others in sheer selection, creativity, and quality. For example, the Slappy Pappy includes bacon, cheddar, sour cream, and french fries. Or the Zippity Zam, with the sriracha and red peppers. The poppyseed buns add uniqueness to an already impressive hotdog.On a Friday or Saturday night this place gets BUSY. Some of it is spillover from the very popular 16-bit bar next door, but people in Columbus looking for hotdogs seem to come to Frank's. The indoor seating is very limited, so expect to eat out in the street - as hotdogs were intended to be enjoyed!

I'm talking about a basement bathrooms with buckets for trash, scrounge up your own table settings kind of place.  But doesn't that add to the experience?I've only been during peak hours (be sure to come hungry and before church lets out!), but the food then seems fresh and surprisingly free of gratuitous grease.  Case in point: the turnip cakes are fried up to order on a little griddle on wheels.  (Turnip cakes, you might say?  don't miss them!  They're crispy and fluffy with little bits of Chinese sausage mixed... my mouth is watering!)  Sieu mai, har gow, and other dumplings are stand-bys.  The long, thick noodles with shrimp are another hit, and I could lap up the sauce.  I'll probably skip the pork buns next time.I'm always too full to sample from the pastry cart, but it doesn't look like a highlight... if those egg tarts and jello cubes really look tempting to you, try to stick it out for one of the many Chinese bakeries nearby or go for a bowl of their cold tapioca (it comes around in a huge silver vat).Stamp after stamp after stamp always seems to add up to an impossibly low total (around $10/person).

Our group of 9 arrived just before dinnertime and though there were several other folks eating here, we were seated quickly. I wanted to inhale all the different types of meat so I got the Stubb's Major which comes with three meats and two sides. I got the pulled pork, brisket, and ribs. The ribs were the best I thought and the pulled pork was a close second. The meat is super tender and flavorful even without any of the sauce. Out of the three, the brisket was my least favorite just because it was on the drier side compared to the other two. If I had nothing to compare it to, I think I would've liked it more. I also tried my friend's sausage which was quite good as well. For the sides I got the collard greens which I really liked and the mac n cheese which I thought was pretty standard, nothing too special, though I liked that they used shells. We also tried some appetizers including the fried green tomatoes, jalapeno poppers, and the potato skins. None were particularly crazy outstanding but I liked that the outside crisp on all three was done well and that it didn't make the tomatoes or jalapenos on the inside too soggy.

It's a small shop with a big following, so get there early or expect a wait.  The good news is that if you enjoy a quality bowl of ramen, you won't be disappointed.  My Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - It's a small shop in a shopping strip, and here's a roped off area for people to stand outside in line.  Once you get into the restaurant, you'll find a charming space with lots of natural wood, giving it a distinct Japanese feel.  Before you place your ramen order, you'll also get a chance to order a number of Japanese drinks & snacks.  1 Star.Service - The one item I want to highlight is the staff & Ramen Tatsu-Ya do a great job keeping things moving & orderly.  Upon entering we gave them the # of people in are party, ordered, and proceeded to take our seat.  They were efficient, food came out fast, and there were multiple on hand to help clear the area.  It all is part of the well-oiled machine to get people in & out via being efficient, not by rushing you.  1 Star.Food - While I am by no means a ramen expert, I enjoyed my \\"Old Skool\\" ramen.  The menu was limited during my Saturday lunch visit, but the ramen was soft, the broth was balanced, the pork belly was melt in your mouth tender, but the marinated egg was my favorite.  This semi hard-boiled egg stay together instead of having runny yolk.  I actually preferred this type of egg.  Over all it was over too quickly, as when I got to the bottom I wanted more.  It's not cheap either, but you are paying for a quality bowl.  I even liked it better than Ippudo in NYC.  1  1/2 Star.Will I Return? - Probably.  I don't live in Austin and so I have to carefully select where I go. My experience was great, but a return visit would have to depend on multiple factors (e.g. how long is the wait at Franklin's or la barbecue).  Those lucky enough to live in Austin and who want a darn good bowl of ramen should go here immediately.   1/2 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\\n1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\\n2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.

The interior is very spacious and well decorated. It was quite busy for 5:15pm (considering they open at 5pm), which I took as a sign of their popularity. Service was quick throughout the entire meal and the servers were attentive.My party of 6 ordered 6 dishes. None of us were particularly hungry since our reservation was so early, so we were okay with that number of dishes. I would recommend ~2 dishes per person for a normal group. Instead of bread and butter, they serve pickled green beans as a complimentary appetizer which had a delightfully acidic bite to them.- Savory monkey bread with garlic, parsley, and bianco sardo ($8): One of their small bites, and probably my least favorite dish of the night. The monkey bread was all dough and the dish itself didn't have much flavor - felt like chewing a Pillsbury biscuit.\\n- Charred broccoli with butternut squash hummus, bianco sardo, and cashews ($13): Delicious, even for a devout carnivore like me. The broccoli was salted and crispy, and paired wonderfully with the bed of hummus that it was served on.\\n- Ubiquitous kale salad with creamy pistachio dressing, honey, and fennel ($12): Probably my least favorite of the vegetarian dishes that we ordered. The portion size was quite large compared to the other dishes, but again I felt that there was a lack of flavor to the salad. I would have preferred more dressing.\\n- Crispy baby bok choy with egg, walnuts, hot colatura, and garlic dip ($14): The egg was amazing. It was poached to perfection and when broken, the yolk ran out and mixed with the bok choy to add creaminess to the flavor. The baby bok choy was baked to a crisp almost like kale chips, and had a strong charred flavor. I really enjoyed this dish.\\n- Grilled octopus with oil cured halloumi, grilled bread, citrus, and sunflower seed aioli ($17): A little on the expensive side for the portion. The octopus is served on a slice of toasted bread which was quite delicious, but probably would not order again for the price.\\n- Crispy Berkshire pork belly with grilled kumquat vinaigrette and Anson Mills grits ($16): Delicious. The pork belly is tender and melts in your mouth, with an extremely crispy piece of skin on top (warning: this is very difficult to cut if you are trying to share). The addition of the kumquats add a nice brightness to the dish. My only complaint is that the grease from the pork belly tends to soak into the grits and to make them more greasy than normal.\\n- 2x secret burgers ($16 each): My favorite dish of the night. Their secret burgers are amazing - definitely get here early if you want to order one because they only make a limited number per night and can sell out within an hour and a half of opening. I love the substitution of a crispy cheddar wafer instead of your standard melted cheddar cheese on top of the meat, and the creamy dressing pairs perfectly with the acidity of the pickled cucumber topping. The burger is served with a side of house-made chips.Overall, service was impeccable (5/5), ambiance was great for a date night or fancy dinner out (5/5), and food was delicious (4/5), although there were some hits and misses. I think it is a little expensive for the amount of food that you get, so I took off a star for value (3/5)."},{"name":"No Mas!

After 40 min at the bar (no comp drink for the screw up), 2 of 3 two-seater tables were cleared and we're waiting for the 3rd to clear. It cleared and the mgr, Mario?,  went and sat 2 people who just arrived at the table. When I spoke up, he said \\"let me do my job, that table isn't even the same height as the other 2\\".  Why the tables had to be the same height to eat is beyond me. So we wait another 10 min for the last table of 2 to be cleared so we can push 3 tables together. Guess what, that last table of 2 wasn't the same height either, so he made us wait the add 10 min for nothing.About the place: it's chaotic and loud. He's obviously short staffed. Took forever to get drinks or water replenished.Waitress: she was lovely. she was the one positive of the night.Food: No complaints from anyone and I had the haddock special, which was very good. They served us one basket of bread and one small platter of dipping oils for 6 people. Had to ask for an additional one so the other end of the tables could enjoy some as well.Dessert: they push the crepes, so we tried it. Big mistake! Why they have crepes in an Italian restaurant is beyond me, but we fell for it, and we got basically 2 rubber pancakes which were inedible.

I recognize that this is a cardinal sin when you're going to a rib place, but I was raised in a vegetarian household and I sometimes still deal with whore-in-church levels of guilt when it comes to eating delicious, delicious animals. Such is life.THIS WAS WORTH IT. I might have licked the bones. My best friend was in town from Boston, and she really wanted good barbecue. I'm a shut-in, and as a recent transplant to ATL, I hadn't yet found a place to bring people for barbecue. Yelp and a couple buddies didn't disappoint, and pointed me to Fat Matt's. We rolled up, and it smelled like the world's best meaty, smoky campfire when we got out of the car. The menu was simple, and delicious looking. Bestie got half a rack of ribs (I swear I've never seen her SO HAPPY about a meal) and I got a rib sandwich, hoping that someone else would pick the meat off the bones for me. That didn't happen, and I wasn't even sad. THESE RIBS CHANGED MY LIFE.I don't even know how to describe how much I hate picking/biting/cutting meat off of bones, but I didn't even care. These ribs were delicious. The sauce was great, but the ribs didn't need the sauce. I'm surprised at some of the reviews saying the meat was too fatty or not flavorful, because I'm heinously picky about ribs. They need to be worth the effort for me to bother, and these were definitely worth the effort.One of my buddies came along and got the chopped pork sandwich and some chicken, which I also took bites of, and it was fracking delicious as well. If I could live the rest of my days in that shack, slowly growing morbidly obese on their food, I wouldn't even be sad. Between all of us, we tried to rum baked beans, collard greens, mac and cheese, brunswick stew, and potato salad. I couldn't even pick a favorite side, because they were all amazing. GO HERE.

Being from out of town I drove around the shopping center a couple times. Anyways, it's a small shop, so you wait outside but there is a pokestop so it makes time go by a little quicker. But the line moves relatively fast. 5 stars go to the waitress, we had a party of 10 and we're happy to break apart to get seated quicker, but she did a great job to help us get seated together without additional wait time. The food, I'm not a huge taken guy, more of a pho person, but this may have been one of the better ramen places I've eaten at. Main issue with ramen is that you pay $15ish for a bowl vs pho at $8-9. I got the #1 with seaweed, egg, and porkbelly, might be like $9 + 1.5, +1.5, +3. Somewhere in that range. I would say the broth was ok, I like it a little bit saltier than what it was.

I felt the service and atmosphere to be quite charming. This little shop was very busy when a friend and I arrived but they seated us and took our order promptly. The wait for the food was not long either.We shared the Party Tray Titanic which seemed like a great price for what it came with - assorted sashimi, nigiri and two rolls (Snow White Roll, Rainbow Roll). The sashimi was decent - I really enjoyed the mackerel and the salmon. However the experience was ruined with half frozen tuna sashimi.The nigiri came next. Fish quality aside, the rice was very warm and lacked seasoning. The fish pieces were too thick and did not wrap around the rice as nigiri should and the peices were missing wasabi between the fish and rice. The warm rice was very off-putting.The two rolls were very unimpressive. It was disappointing to finish off the dinner like this! The   Snow White Roll felt like an experiment that didn't quite hit the mark. The coconut and mango sauce was too strong and made the fish eggs useless as the flavour was completely masked by the sweetness. The Rainbow Roll was not rolled correctly and fell apart quick. I have had rainbow rolls before and this was the plainest version I've had. Again, the rice was warm and off-putting.The service was nice and very attentive - I tipped well but really wished I could give them a review in person. I want this place to succeed and perhaps we should have taken the hint when most other patrons were having ramen and rice bowls instead.

So when I saw the Austinist post extolling the virtues of hot & crunchy chicken cones at The Mighty Cone, I decided I needed to check it out, pronto.The Mighty Cone is housed in a trailer just down the way from Hey Cupcake on South Congress.  Not surprisingly given its modest quarters, the menu is fairly limited - eight types of cones (including two dessert cones), sliders in one meat and one veggie incarnation, Blue Bell shakes, and chili-dusted fries.  I couldn't find a menu online before I headed over there, so I snapped a pic of it while I was there and posted it here in case you're the sort that needs to figure out your game plan beforehand.Based on the gushing about the hot & crunchy chicken cone on the Austinist, I ordered one of those, and couldn't resist also getting a hot & crunchy shrimp cone and an order of fries to share so I could sample those, as well.  A pic of all three is posted above.  These are more or less tacos that have been rolled to fit into a white paper cone.  I loved the batter, which is a mixture of sesame seeds, almonds, chili flakes, sea salt, sugar, and corn flakes.  Both the chicken and the shrimp cones were drizzled with an ancho chile aioli and garnished with mango-jalapeno coleslaw.  Tasty overall, to be sure, but I found myself wishing that either the cones or the fries would deliver a bit more of a kick; I didn't find either particularly spicy and had definitely expected them to be given all the heat in the descriptions.  I also thought the portion sizes were much too small given the price.  Yes, this is food brought to us by the same folks as the considerably more upscale Hudson's on the Bend, but when you're serving what basically amounts to tacos (albeit creatively packaged and beautifully described) out of a trailer, you've got a fair amount of serious competition in this city.  I had one and a half cones, half an order of fries, and a bottled water - my half amounting to right around $10 not including tax - and I wasn't really full afterwards.I think this is a fun concept, and I'm generally a fan of gourmet-styled food in casual surroundings, but the price combined with the moderate portion sizes does give me pause.  I'll probably be back, but I'll likely reserve my visits for days when my appetite isn't quite so mighty."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Awesome place to have mexican food!

Lucky for us there is a snow storm going on, so we didn't have to wait a single minute.  I had us listed for 8:30pm on a Friday night.  My boyfriend and I showed up at 8:15, and the host took us to our table.  He made it a point to let us know that you usually would not be seated unless your entire party arrived.  Everyone else showed up between 8:30-8:45 and it was not an issue due to the lack of crowd (the restaurant was still pleasantly filled but not full).The decor and ambience is dark yet cozy.  Yes, you are very close to other tables and diners etc.  The server was nice because it's her job-to-be-nice type of nice.  Amongst the 7 of us, there were 2 orders of Burgers, 2 Screen Door Plates, 1 Fried Chicken, 1 Braised Pork, 1 Trout Pecan.  I enjoyed my pork dish very much, super rich and flavorful and filling.  I picked at the fried chicken, which was good but far from the best I've had like some people here claim.  The chicken is huge because it is 75% batter.  The greens were soggy and bland, I've had much better.   My friend enjoyed the trout, but I had a bite and found it bland.   One person loved his burger, the other said it was so-so.

Come on, Tim, Austin is a beer city, you can do a lot better than that.I recommend the fettine to start, paper thin slices of various interesting meats. Get the trio and try all three types. Very light and won't fill you up. The deviled crab was somehow light and rich at the same time with lots of crab meat stuffed into the little shells. Boar ribs were tiny but mighty, with a slightly sweet BBQ sauce that perfectly matched the game.  We tried elk sliders with foie gras, served on brioche buns. The meat to bun ratio was off (too much bread) but the flavor match of buttery foie gras with lean, gamey elk was perfect. We finished the starters with a lovely, crisp shaved vegetable salad. It was a nice break to wake up your taste buds.For entrees, we had the stuffed tenderloin (the best value for your money - lots of food and total meat yum), wagyu skirt steak (heavenly tender), elk (a real winner - outrageous flavor and played beautifully). Had the carrot side dish. Biggest freaking carrots I ever saw. Looked like yams. Unique mix of flavors.Our table server was very professional, knowledgeable, and attentive. What you'd expect at a place like this. Dinner with drinks, tax, and tip ran $100 a head. We even got a glimpse of Mr. Tim Love himself. He looks better in person than on TV."},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Joe's Crab Shack-I mean jakes famous crawfish. We made it as our last stop in Oregon. We made it just in time for the butt of happy hour. We ordered the triple berry margarita which was very berry. Not much alcohol. So tasted like a smoothie. I did like the touch of sugar on the rim. We had the calamari. A slight bit too salty. But nice and crunchy. And they use the bigger squid. They give two sauces, marinara and an Asian sauce. I like the marinara much better. We then also had the salmon cake. My bf was very skeptic. I was too but I was willing to give it a try. Many places I. The bay use bread as a filler and don't really use the seafood in the cake. I'm glad Portland proved us wrong again! Mostly salmon! So fresh and tasty. It came with tartar sauce. We had to ask for another serving of lemon. We were being jipped with baby wedges. Then we finally received our clam chowder. Of course we wanted to compare this last thing to SF. I'd have to say, it was pretty good but hands down, SF has it locked. The difference was, it was more meaty. More bacon, not much clam. It also was creamy but not buttery. But still good. Service was a bit lacking. There were only two ladies handling the bar section. They did have their hands full. We weren't getting much attention. Also, they were getting confused at who ordered what. Definitely add more people around happy hour. It also took awhile to receive our orders."},{"name":"Appetito","address":"761 Beacon St","city":"Newton","stars":"2","text":"I honestly don't even know where to start with Appetito... my inlaws had a Groupon, so they invited us to dine with them before a hockey game. We arrived just past 6pm and ordered two beers and two glasses of wine. Our waitress went behind the bar and then loudly proclaimed that she couldnt find her wine key and thus could not open the beer (it was a Longtrail). Ever prepared, bf and I both have keychain bottle openers so that crisis was averted.After securing our drinks, we ordered two appetizers, the mussels and the antipasto. Everything seemed fine until our waitress came flying into the restaurant from outside and started loudly telling her colleague about a confrontation she'd just had with the owner of the nail salon next door. As she filled up our water, she apologized for being jittery and then went on the regale us with neighborhood gossip involving a lit cigarette and a basement fire and possible retaliation. What in the ever-loving hell?! It's a small Itialian restaurant and all, but this is Newton, not New Jersey!Our apps came out and I cut up what looked suspiciously like bruschetta. MIL and I both commented that it didn't look like antipasto, but the men reminded us we'd been told it wasn't like \\"regular\\" antipasti so we went with it....until our waitress reappeared with a plate of pasta with chicken and veg on top and said, \\"you guys ordered bruschetta?\\" Huh?! Apparently we'd been delivered the wrong app, but thankfully it was no big deal. She put down the antipasto salad and the men snagged her and ordered two more beers -- and were then promptly informed that there was not a single beer left in the place but a case of Sam Winter bottles. Uh...ok.There was a significant timelapse between our apps being cleared and our entrees being served which, after reading the reviews, wasn't surprising. The food came out and was actually ok for the most part; two chicken parms, a mushroom lasagna and chicken cutlets with artichoke hearts are tough to screw up. I do have to note, though, that the vegetables in my chicken dish were almost raw. If I wanted crunchy carrots and raw summer squash, I'd order a salad. We were crunched for time so ordered dessert to go -- 2 slices of generic, store-bought cheesecake.This is where it gets particularly good: after watching my FIL count out the cash for the bill (along with an overly generous tip, in my opinion, given the whole \\"haha fire!\\" incident), we left the restaurant to go to the game. A block down the street, we hear, 'HEY! WAIT\\" and turn to see our waitress sprinting toward us -- IN THE RAIN -- with a wad of cash in her hands. \\"You didn't tip me!\\" wasn't really what I was expecting, but those are the exact words that came out of her mouth. My FIL proceeded to tell her that he most certainly did leave a tip, and over $20 at that. She proceeded to wave his money in his face while we just stood there with our jaws dropped. At that point, we were getting soaked, so rather than argue with her he just gave her money while she tried to convince him that she \\"really isn't like that but...\\" and tried to get his cell phone number \\"in case the money turned up somewhere.\\" WHAT?!Even with the appetizer snafu, the lack of beer, the undercooked vegetables and the generic dessert, I probably would have given Appetito two stars because the food itself was fine for the most part. The whole \\"chasing us down the street to demand a gratuity that is actually a reward for good service\\" bit, however, can't be justified. If you're looking for Italian food, head to the North End or, I dunno, even Bertucci's.

AMAZING! I once had the fortune of meeting some very friendly locals on the beach in Rome. They cooked up what they described as a very typical spaghetti dish on an open fire in a big pot on the beach. Onions, tomatoes, garlic and some herbs was about all that went in there but OMG, it was amazing. Super simple and tasty. Nothing like the overloaded, greasy, brick in the stomach, Italian that is often served up at American Italian restaurants. Lorenzo's is very much identical to what I experienced of Italian food in Italy.My favorite dish: the spaghetti! Oh and the bread always rocks.

No free chips and salsa either, which is poor form. Instead you get a shot of beef broth, which is a nice gesture, but it's not enough to stick in your eye (as my grandpa would say).

That said, I do believe my review is an accurate representation of my experience here.The last time I went to Red Lobster was quite a sad affair.  It was several years ago, and with an ex-girlfriend.  The food was quite poor and the service was average.  This time around, I had much better company - myself.  I was in town for a conference, had decided to go bowling my last night and walked over to Red Lobster for dinner as it was close.I sat at the bar and was greeted by Eddie the bartender.  Eddie was great, and he gets 5 stars.  He was friendly, attentive, and made a great mojito.   I ordered some food and enjoyed my drink.The ultimate feast that I ordered was quite tasty.  It was a tad slow coming out I felt, though Eddie made sure I had everything else I needed and checked on the food for me. I was quite pleased to see a marked improvement over my previous Red Lobster outing.  The missing star is for what I perceive to be the lacking value in the meal - while it was good, it was probably more than I would like to pay for what I received, though I did not go hungry.

Despite its limited hours, it's always a treat to get some southern breakfast comfort food in one of the coolest parts of the city. I've tried a few things here and here's some highlights (with one big lowlight):7th Trimester: Make sure you're super hungry, because you won't want to put down your fork. It starts with a sturdy yet fluffy cheddar chive biscuit base, topped with an over medium egg, two slices of bacon, and ends with their five cheese Mac and Cheese with a potato chip crumble. The egg yolk mixes nicely with the zingy Mac and Cheese sauce. The Mac and cheese also makes a great dish for lunch if you wish to order that by itself (which is what I did today!) :)Shrimp & grits: This is one of their most recent specials, and I always look for it when they announce their weekend specials on their Facebook page every week. Shrimp and grits is one of my all time favorite brunch dishes and they do it right. They start again with their famous biscuit base, a shrimp cake (think of a crab cake, but, you know, with shrimp), a savory tomato jam and an over medium egg sitting on a pile of cheddar chive grits. The shrimp cake was cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the yolk was a great way to tie the ingredients together. My favorite part of it is the grits because they're thick, yet not gritty (pardon the pun), and creamy, but not runny. Make sure you like them on Facebook to stay informed! I'm looking forward to trying some different dishes. Orange blossom sweet tea: It smells and tastes like a warm Florida summer day, running through fields of orange groves. As you can imagine, it's a dream. Oatmeal cream pie: This is one of my favorite childhood treats, and it made me happy to see it in the bakery. The oatmeal cookies were thick, moist, and cakey. The frosting was loaded with sugar in the best possible way. It was made with lots of love, and it's taken everything in me to try different things other than this. I'll be sure to buy it again. Swiss cake roll: I saw a review that gave this low marks for being dry, and I wanted to try this childhood favorite for myself. It breaks my heart to say it, but I have to agree with the other reviewer who said this. Not only was the cake very dry, but the frosting inside was runny and flavorless. I took one bite and tossed it out, and I wish I'd ordered an oatmeal cream pie. All in all, this place is great, and I look forward to trying that signature dark chocolate & salted caramel pie, among their other treats and specials! The workers are very kind people, and despite the small size of the restaurant, it feels very homey. PS: don't park in the Courteous Communications lot. They WILL tow, and if the restaurant parking doesn't pan out, you can park at the park across the street, and that seems okay. Keep doing good, Se7en Bites (although if you could make that Swiss cake roll better, I'd appreciate it)."},{"name":"Cocotte","address":"2930 NE Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Competition is tough in Portland....They better get their act together.

He said they had a large party arriving at 7....They never showed.  Same  situation someone else wrote about earlier on Yelp.  The smoked salmon salad was O.k.  The Pearl bread was outstanding along with the garlic butter.  I ordered the Poulet Cocotte.  It was good, and I enjoyed the faro along with it.  My husband ordered the bouillabaisse...first there was no taste of Pernod in the soup, and the mussels were not fresh so they brought some new ones but they just didn't taste right..so he didn't eat them.

We were tired and hungry. When we saw the name of the restaurant, \\"Cowfish\\", we just had to check it out! When we get to the door, a nice young lady greeted us with her device. She checked and said we can get a table in 60 mins. That was a good sign for us, it means they were busy. We waited and they called us in a about 60 minutes later. We headed up the stairs and greeted the host, who quickly sat us at the outside patio. Our server, who was also a trainer, promptly welcomed us. --on a side note-- We had a long day at the park, and nature decided to take its course. After we were seated and ordered, I left for the restrooms. It's located on the top floor. As I made my way up, I was noticed some funny paintings on the wall, like a replica of the Mona Lisa, but Japanese. Once in the bathroom, I was impressed by the cleanliness and the privacy the stall provided. As I was doing my business, I notice the speakers were playing a tape of funny one liners from various characters. Some were even in other languages. The bathroom experience was enjoyable. --end of side note--Their menu is extensive, with a different variety of sushi and burgers. It took us a while to decide on what we wanted to order. I ended up with the \\"rise and swine\\" with sweet potato fries as a substitute while my buddies had the bento box. The food came out 15 minutes later, and it was amazing. The portion was big, with my burger sitting perfectly on the left of the plate and the fries on the right. Potato fries were definitely one of the better fries I've had. Crunchy on the edges, but nice and soft on the inside. The burger itself was spectacular. The rise and swine is composed of breakfast food such as sunny side up egg, bacon, ham, and cheese. The beef patty was cooked exactly to the way I wanted. The onion bun was great too, with onions cooked on top of the bun, adding a nice touch. Overall, my experience with the restaurant was great. It is definitely one of the better ones in Orlando, better than the ones inside the theme parks!

I actually might walk over there and get one right now...The coffee is awesome too (with lots of options), and it is a lot less confusing and pressure-inducing to order and hang out here than City Feed.

It has a more intimate lounge area in addition to the regular dining hall and its large bar area.  The entire interior is tasteful and gets very, very dim after the sunset, usually saturated with the combined volume of conversations.  It reminds me of those club-like food places around buckhead, except Apres Diem is more subdued and the crowd artsier.   Patio is huge but austere and the view can boast of not much other than movie goers--you also can't really see the pretty wait staffs (apparently a big draw) sitting on the patio. Menu is unexciting to the point of suspicious laziness, as other than the entrees most items are simple variations of plain old bar food.  The sandwiches are especially uninspiring, featuring perhaps too simply prepared meat and fish adorned with little else (lettuce and tomatoes on ALL sandwiches).  Entree selection is small, even with specials added to considerations, but at least are well made.  These do not stray very far from straightforward preparations of free range chicken, bass, rock shrimp (if that), pork loins and filet.   They often have a special mussels appetizer that is a great deal.  Not only is the portion massive but the mussels are plump and juicy.  The broth used is one of the spiciest for a dish of its kind, and is worth a try.  Drink list is satisfactory.  More than 10 beers are on tap that even includes a hefe weizen.

When it occurred, it was well-executed (except for one billing error), but the problem was that we weren't attended to often enough. There was at least a 10-minute wait before anyone approached our table, so bad impression right at the start. Also, after we received our corrected check, it was about 30 minutes before we flagged someone down to run the credit card. We had long finished our wine by then, so there was no reason for us to linger. I should point out that the restaurant was not busy.

We requested patio seats but were told that the whole party had to be present to be seated. After waiting for about 10 minutes, they seated us anyways, even though the whole party wasn't present, which was nice. The patio has a really nice view of the Boston skyline. It's pretty well lit too. I got the strawberry mule drink to start. It was really sweet, which isn't my cup of tea but if you like sweet drinks then go for it. I started off with the whole wheat orecchiette with chorizo, broccoli rabe, ricotta, and fennel. I didn't like the dish at all. It had no flavor to it. It tasted like all the ingredients were thrown on the dish and a spoonful of ricotta was put on top of it all. It wasn't a cohesive dish.I got the duck breast with whipped sweet potatoes, collard greens, bacon and peach mostarda. I thought the duck was a little too dry but the skin was really crispy which was good. The real star of this dish was the whipped sweet potato. It was really good and this is coming from someone who is not a huge fan of sweet potato. My friend got the lobster carbonara and it literally tasted like packaged chicken ramen noodles that we all used to binge eat in college. It was really salty and it wasn't in a carbonara sauce. Carbonara sauce is reminiscent of an Alfredo sauce. I'm not sure what kind of sauce Art Bar used but it made the dish taste like salty ramen noodles. I got the matcha honey suckle cake with saut√©ed peaches for dessert. It sounded so good on the menu, but it wasn't good at all. The cake was super dry and really unappealing. I love desserts so I was pretty disappointed. Also, parking is not free! You still have to pay $15 after validation.... Totally NOT worth it for Art Bar. You could pay that price for valet parking at a nicer restaurant in Boston. The space is really nice, especially out on the patio. The service was pretty good.

As it was, I was in charge of ordering chinese food for an office event. I read the reviews first, so thanks for steering me toward the Orange Beef and the garlic green beans. They were tasty. Everything else was about on par with most chinese places-bland but that's what you plan on for the most part. One of my co-workers is allergic to onions, Hunan Pearl promised that nothing would have any onions, and two of the dishes had mass amounts of onion. My main complaint is that the portions for take out, at least for lunch, are tiny. In general, you expect to get a lot for your money at chinese places, and here one meal was one tiny chinese container. That's half-way acceptable with meat dishes I suppose, although not very comparative to other chinese places where you could feed 2-3 people with one take out meal. Here, I ordered 10 lunch specials for 6 people, and it was all eaten up. Maybe the portions would be bigger eating in, but I'd expect one lunch special to fill up at least one person. I mean, I paid $7 for a container of broccoli that wasn't even full, and was about 30 cents worth of broccoli, about 1/4 pound. Same with the green beans, but at least they were good, and I will be replicating them at home.

The restaurant is located in the Castleberry Hill neighborhood adjacent to downtown Atlanta. It's a cool spot with parking behind the restaurant. The decor is colorful and the outdoor seating is spacious. For a meal, I had to settle for sides of Spinach, Rice, and Beans as I saw nothing on the menu that was vegan friendly even though Mexican food is usually the easiest to make Vegan. My cousin's wife is also Vegan and ordered sides before I placed mine so I knew I was not overlooking anything. My wife loved her steak burrito and other family members liked their choices as well. Service was okay but slow as several of us could not catch up with the server towards the end to get our bills. This was the first time I have gone to a non-friendly Vegan Mexican establishment. A simple option of a Bean Burrito or anything would go along ways.

We made reservations well in advance, and the restaurant was waiting on us when we arrived.  I was a bit nervous when it became apparent that we only had one server, but we need not have worried.  He handled it like a champ.  Because of the size of the party, we ordered off of the family style menu which allowed everyone to pick their own entree and dessert, while the appetizers and sides were chosen by the kitchen.  Everything was paced well (not an easy feat with that many people), and the bar staff was on top of our drink orders.  I'd guess that a third of our bill was mixed drinks, and I don't recall anyone waiting too long for new drinks to be made.  Definitely order an old fashioned.  Several of us are bourbon/old fashioned snobs, and theirs was great.  The food was good--though definitely stop your heart butter and bacon laden.  Between our party people had chicken casserole, steak, pork chop, catfish, and fried chicken.  While some liked their entrees better than others, the style allowed everyone to sample each other's food as desired.  The desserts were amazing, but be prepared to hate yourself the next morning.  The fried strawberry pie was my favorite.  Revival isn't somewhere I could eat often, but thats due to the heaviness of the food, not the quality.

This burger and fries FAR exceeded my expectations - the best ever - my husband and I both thought so, and he's very hard to please.  The meat is amazing - you can taste all the pork fatback, the veggies are pickled, the jalapenos roasted, and they make their own bread which is a bun that stands up to the messy oozing meat and sauce.

The outside was slightly crispy and the inside had a great texture. You get to choose between 3 dipping sauces.There are 2 kinds of burger patties - one is a breaded tempeh burger and the other is a more traditional veggie burger.

Their patio on a nice spring day, for instance. The fact that Dekalb Ave and I-20 aren't as loud as you might suspect. Their beer selection, even. Nice. But I can't even restrain myself from immediately getting to the brisket.Their sliced brisket is a hymn to the meat gods. Best in Atlanta. Best I've ever had, personally. The slow-smoked meat is tender and forthright, and perfectly complemented by the cracked-peppercorn spice rub. It's quite a fatty cut, but don't be turned off by the relative size of fat and leanness as that fat is so perfectly rendered that it melts in your mouth. This holy trinity, simple and honest, is so perfect to me that it doesn't need any sauce. Maybe just a touch wouldn't hurt. I want to set up a security camera, though, to publicly shame those who drown it in sauce or worse yet, cut off all that beautiful fat.I'm not a huge fan of ribs, so I've never had them here. Their pinto beans are top-notch (also slow-cooked to a perfect texture and well-spiced, but not vegetarian), Brunswick stew is pretty good, and fried pickles are tasty. Not surprisingly, the corned beef is very well-brined too, though the Russian dressing leaves a little to be desired. For me and my restaurant goals, Fox Bros gets five stars, but beware: it's not a big restaurant and their parking lot is even smaller. There is quite likely to be a wait, and you may do better parking in the neighborhood and walking a block. I've had a server that goofed on side-item orders, as well as a dining companion whose order wasn't put in at all.

Portions are rather small but the food is so rich and satisfying that I think it's actually the perfect amount. First, we got the torched avocado toast with peekytoe crab, \\"kalette\\" and cauliflower kimchee, and poached egg on top. This was such a fun dish! The toast is thick and buttery, and you should eat it quickly because it does get a little soggy from the weight of all the goodies atop. Though the crab is supposed to be the shining star, I loved the kimchee! It seemed more like a slaw to me, but it was fresh and just acidic enough to balance out the rest of the rich dish. Again, the portion wassmall (only one piece of toast), but it was filling. I also had the seasonal panzanella salad, which came with a plethora of lightly dressed veggies, included roasted broccoli and green beans, and huge chunks of grilled halloumi cheese. This was actually a good-sized salad, and I love the fun mix of ingredients. There are only two things that I would change, but they are more personal preferences than actual issues with the restaurant. First, the place itself is dim (it's mostly below ground), except for a tiny section of tables near the windows. It has an intimidate and cozy vibe, but I prefer some sunlight for brunch. Second, everything is intended for sharing, and the dishes come out as they are prepared in the kitchen, so in a staggered manner.

I visited this slightly hidden restaurant with a friend later last night after reading the reviews before me. We were greeted by a young man, which I presume to be their son. After settling down, we ordered a BBQ platter and a platter of noodles. The food was decent as it wasn't as over spiced or salted compared to other Korean BBQ places I've been to. The bill was just over $20 for 2 people, which is definitely good. To add to our experience, as we were eating there were a constant stream of people coming into the restaurant even at around 8:30pm.

We went on a Saturday. Got there around 6:30-6:45 am and were told we would be eating around 12-12:30. I want to say there were roughly 50 people ahead of us. I suggest a good breakfast beforehand and bringing snacks. There is a CVS right in front if you need to get something while waiting. I strongly suggest bringing your own chairs because while they do have quite a few to lend out, they went extremely fast! The restaurant also opens up their restrooms, but there can be a wait as there are only 2 to use. Now for the food! OMG. It was AMAZING! I am generally not a big BBQ person and tend to be very picky, but the \\"moist\\" brisket was perfect! We also got the turkey and beef ribs which were just as good.

They have a breakfast and lunch menu, which they serve both all day, and in my opinion, I prefer the breakfast side. My favorite would have to be their 7th Trimester. If you love Mac and Cheese and Eggs Benedict, then this is what you need to get. On the lunch side, I would recommend their Chicken Salad sandwich. It was amazing and the bread never got soggy, so every bite has a great crisp to it from the bread. But what I really come here for is their Aqua Fresca. It's their refreshing drink that changes daily. My favorite is the Watermelon Mint Limemade. I love watermelon and this drink made me love them even more. It's crazy addictive. You'll end up buying a second one. The place is really great to eat with friends. When I come here with my group, we would each order something different from the menu and share with each other. If you're not all about sharing, that's fine too, but you'll find yourself drooling over one of your friend's meal.

Chock full of grilled eggplant, hummus, tahini sauce, hardboiled egg, greens and mango pickle, this would be a great way to start almost any day (it is, apparently, a traditional Iraqi Jewish breakfast).  Into the pita I tuck the cart's ubiquitous side of red onion, kalamatas, parsley, and pepperoncini for added crunch (leaving the pickle spear for dessert).  It's seven bucks, and it fills me up for half a day.  And I'm a pig (seriously.

Late night starts at 9:30 and gets busy fast so make sure to get there by about 9ish if you don't want to wait.

We're not salad people but we scarfed it up. Appetizer: THE FRIED CHICKEN. They were amazing. Absolutely the standout of the meal. They were just voted best in Boston so if you come here and don't get them you're missing out. Crispy fried on the outside, moist to the point of falling off the bones on the inside. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. I'm not kidding. Get the chicken.Entrees: We shared the brisket nachos and the haddock. The brisket nachos were OK, not as good as we had hoped. Too much gloopy sour cream on top which made everything a little soggy. The haddock was delicious. It came with snap peas and fried tempura bits, and the consistency of everything with the kick of the ginger glaze made for a very enjoyable bite.Dessert: Double chocolate bread pudding. Again, just OK. For something good advertised as double chocolate, it really wasn't that chocolatey. The dulce de Leche sauce on top was tasty though.Drinks: My boyfriend had a couple beers and I got the Buffalo Buffalo which I loved.

It's not quite up to the high standards of the rest of the place.  In fact I prefer to be seated in the rooms off to the side, away from the hostess/greeting area.

The rib meat is so tender that it literally holds onto dear life on the bone.  The sauce is also always perfect.   It's kinda vinegary, spicy, and sweet at the same time.  I've been to Community, Fox Bros, and Heirloom, and yeah they're good, but they really don't hold a candle to Fat Matt's.  Where else can you get as many slices of white bread as you want to make a little rib sandwich?  Perfect combo= meat, coleslaw, BBQ sauce, and a dash of hot sauce.  Yum.The meal is nicely complimented with the live band in the evenings and a pitcher of beer to share.   All the sides are pretty solid, and my two favorites would be the collards and the coleslaw. (But I also would never turn away their baked beans, potatoes, or Brunswick stew).Downside would be the limited parking, although even when it is crowded, you can always find a spot. (They have a chicken place next door you can park at, too.) I don't really consider this a downside, but the space can be small for some people.

We ordered a ton of food including a couple appetizers (Texas fries, fried pickles). My husband and I shared the everything platter which included 4 types of meat and 2 sides for $29.First of all, I really loved the ribs. Their ribs did not need any sauce as they were delicious on their own. Nicely seasoned, meat stays on the bone when you pick it up but slides off easily when you bite into it. I liked the pulled pork as well as the wings (super flavorful, tasted a bit on the vinegary side). Brisket was pretty good too, would've been better if they were slightly fattier slices. We didn't see sausage on the menu but apparently jalapeno cheddar sausage was a special?The Texas fries were loaded with brisket (you get to pick which meat to use as topping), cheese, bbq sauce, jalapenos. It was good but I didn't eat that much of it since I'm not much of a \\"loaded fries\\" person. Liked the fried pickles (sliced thinly, perpendicularly to the length of the pickle)Sides: slaw -- very much liked this; super simple slaw with simple flavors. Chili mac - the meat in the chili was pretty fine; think I would've wanted something chunkier. Mac part was mac n cheese.

A piece of cheesecake or regular cake is $6.00. For a PIECE. That translates to a dollar a bite. If there are at least 10 pieces cut from one cake (and there are more than 10, I'm sure) that makes your assigned value to a whole cake or cheesecake about $60! I bought 2 items to at least try them first and give them the benefit of a doubt if the were superlative, spectacular and the best I'd ever had...sorry, NO. Not by a long shot. Look at the neighborhood you are in and think about if artists, musicians, young college kids, or young families can really afford the indulgence of a $6 piece of cake on a regular basis. I suspect once people get over the novelty they will move to the next thing, so I would think about some price adjustments if you want to have a regular clientele. I, for one, was left with a very bad taste in my mouth feeling duped into spending so much for so little. You don't really want your customers to have buyer's remorse, do you? I am not trying to hate, the food is obviously worthy and good, just not at a level where you can expect so much for it. The renovation looks great. I do have one more comment about service, though. Madame owner: If you have started a transaction with me and we are in the middle of an order, do not turn your focus away to another customer's who has already been served and is just walking up to the counter to get something else. You cut me off in mid-sentence and did not return to me for almost 2 minutes while you did things for him.

The typical steamed pork buns (char siu bau), egg custard tarts (daan taat), and tofu dessert (dou fu fa) were all very tasty.  But it fell short in a few places.  First, the shrimp dumpling (har gow) was all white.  The outer dumpling skin is translucent for a reason - so you can see the pinkness of the shrimp.  They basically washed out the color in the shrimp.  Second was the Chinese sticky rice (law mei fan), one of my personal favorite dishes.  But not here.  It was served to us room temperature, dry, and a lot whiter than it should have been, which means they didn't use enough flavoring/seasoning.  Upon tasting it, I was right.  The upside is that the service was right on point.  They were very quick about clearing our table of the empty dishes and refilling our teapot.  And they were also very attentive to items we wanted to eat and were willing to get it for us instead of us having to wait for the carts to come around.

I didn't drink much of it anyways since I care more about the noodles and toppings. I felt like the toppings were a bit lacking. The pork was SO good, but unfortunately they give you one. I also wish it would come with pickled veggies and corn. They are add ons which i think is a bit ridiculous. At Kome they have it included in the price!

Although called a seafood grill, they have plenty of landlubber grub, too and dishes of German, Thai, Mexican, Japanese and Italian descent.  I got the jagermaster chicken with German pancakes and homemade Sauerkraut.  The schnitzel was covered in a brown mushroom and onion sauce.  Besides being a little light on the sauerkraut, which was very good, I found the dish to v=be very tasty.  Soup or salad came with the dish, which went for $13.90.  Quite reasonable.  I had a very tasty spinach salad as my side.  My companion had a caesar salad, which came with choice of topping.  She had shrimp, which were fresh.  However, the salad was very dry, i.e. not much dressing, but the waitress was happy to bring more gratis.Service was spotty.  Purdee much what others have said: they have  lot of help, but sometimes aren't responsive.  Our main waitress wasn't terribly friendly to us, possibly because we ordered no drinks (I heard her  tlking up a group of four next to us who were ordering drinks; nor was she particularly attentive.  An assistant serverette was quite friendly and attentive.  The so-so service and the dry salad led to me docking one star in my grade.Parking can get crowded, but they have extra parking across the street.  They also have take-out -- and a drive-up window, no less; I suspect the place was a hamburger joint in a previous incarnation.The crowd was fairly mature, but it certainly wasn't just old folks.  It is certainly not old-folk food.Didn't have any, but as part of their local schtick, they serve a lot of local spirits, if that is your bag.Will be returning and do recommend it to young and old, and inbetweeners.

One of the things I appreciate is that if you go here as a single diner, you're seated as quickly and your meal arrives with the same speed (fast) as the part of ten beside you.  I don't know how they do that but they do and I appreciate it.  It's a loud place but that's fine.  The waitstaff is wonderfully trained and extremely efficient. They work together and if one server is busy elsewhere, another brings your drink., another brings your chips and -- finally -- your meal.  It's possible to be in and out in 45 minutes at lunch time.  It's not a fancy place at all and there are babies crying and people screaming but that's the way it should be for a Mexican restaurant.  My only complaint is the food can be very salty and / or greasy.  If you order an enchilada, take my advice and ask for it to be light on the cheese; it will still have way more cheese than you want but you won't have to scoop it off.  I usually get the gumbo and chicken fajitas.

The crowd was mixed, ranging from families celebrating children's birthdays (the band sang happy birthday to a little girl maybe 6 years old) to couples, to large groups of hung over (but well mannered) guys singing along with the band.  The music was fantastic.  Gospel, blues, with a little bit of funkiness.  I felt like I was in NOLA.  The food was pretty good too (I would say 4 stars on the food) and coupled with a make your own Bloody Mary bar...it was perfect.  The food was a buffet consisting of enchiladas, fried catfish, biscuits, gravy, brisket, fruit, etc.  Other than the fried catfish, nothing was amazing, but still very good.

The first time was amazing; it deserved four stars, at least! The burger was amazingly flavorful and actually cooked, and the fries were crisp and salty. The bun was soft. The service was good, though it seemed obvious to me our waitress had never waitressed before. I got a regular Foster Burger with aged cheddar, which was amazing, especially because the cheese was fresh grated, so it was rich and fresh and flavorful and perfectly melty. Then there was the second time. The time I brought my friends to this amazing new burger joint. The time we had to wait for a table for like an hour. And to be honest, that wait was the best part of the evening because they had free popcorn. So we finally got our food, though only half of us actually got what we ordered, and all of us took a bite of our burgers first. That is, those of us that could actually bite into them. The bottom bun on all of our burgers was rock hard. And I mean Rock.Hard. It was literally difficult to bite through, it was so hard. I'm pretty sure it was like they had them sitting in a toaster on low (or something) for hours, so it never toasts but turns into a rock, instead. Whatever; moving on. Although none of us asked to have our burgers cooked any certain way, they all came at different temperatures, some more raw that I would have felt comfortable eating, personally, and some with no pink at all. I got the same thing I did the first time, with the cheddar, which was no longer shredded and tasty, but was pre-sliced and flavorless. I don't know what happened. I felt duped into bringing my friends and embarrassing myself by bragging about how tasty and worth the $$ it is. We would have complained to the waitress we had, but she never came back and we were so starving we just said screw it and ate half of everything before she returned with the check. Honestly, the only thing that is keeping this review from having no stars (if it were possible) was the first trip, which according to the other reviews I've read was a miracle.

Not really sure what was Southwest-y about them, but he did enjoy them.

I thought it would be too sweet, but nope! perfect amount of sweet, nutty, salty.

Cypress Street Pint & Plate is located on 6th Street between West Peachtree and Peachtree Streets down the block from CVS and next to Atwood's Pizza Cafe.  This bar is good for seating medium sized to large sized groups (8-10 people) inside or on the patio.  If you're coming solo, there's ample space at the bar as well.  Interior of the restaurant has plenty of televisions to watch your favorite game.  My only complaint is that the inside of the restaurant is fairly loud so it's hard to hear conversations.  Cypress hosts weekly trivia and has brunch or late night specials on other days.On the Menu: Cypress's menu consists of appetizers, burgers, salads, sandwiches, \\"Midtown favorites\\", and sides.  In addition to common appetizers such as pub fries, quesadillas, and chicken wings, there are unique appetizers that include fried mushrooms, poutine, and sweet potato nachos.  Burgers only come in 4 varieties - the first is plain, the second is black bean, and the third has fried pickles.  The fourth though is really cool - it consists of a \\"bun\\" of 2 Sublime donuts (one of favorite donuts in Atlanta) with a bacon cheeseburger inside.  For the \\"Midtown favorites\\", choose between fish and chips, fried chicken, shrimp and grits, or salmon.  The sandwiches are a cheesesteak, a gyro, a Buffalo chicken sandwich, or a BBQ pork sandwich.  Salads have bases of lettuce, arugula, or kale and can be supplemented with chicken, shrimp, or salmon for a nominal surcharge.  The beer and drink menu is bigger than the food menu.What I Tried:  \\nSweetWater Fried Mushrooms ($9) - These are a tasty fried snack.  Both of the sauces (creole mustard mayo and spicy mayo) were delicious.  The appetizer is easily sharable between 2-3 people.Black Bean Burger ($10) - Solid 4-star burger in my book.  The bun for my black bean burger was warm and fresh.  The patty itself was a bit mushy.  Guacamole and pico de gallo enhanced flavor to the burger without making it either soggy or too salty.  The pepper jack cheese was mild.  I thought the burger was appropriately sized for $10 and comes with a fairly generous portion of fries.  The fries are thin cut and medium on the greasy scale.Verdict: Although the volume inside the restaurant can make conversations difficult, the atmosphere is great for a beer and some decent bar food.  I really like the outdoor patio and the beer selection is excellent.  Not a bad choice to enjoy a summer day with a group of friends in Midtown."},{"name":"Tokyo Japanese Steak House","address":"250 Granite St","city":"Braintree","stars":"3","text":"In terms of the teppanyaki experience, the food itself rates only 3 stars--portions border on the small side, and the quality of ingredients is only so-so--but this is pretty typical of all the teppanyaki places I've tried, including Benihana. It's the chef assigned to your table that makes all the difference. Our group was large (14 people) so we were seated around two grills and had two chefs. One side had a riotously funny, knee-slapping good time, while the other side ate silently and looked on in envy after politely clapping for their chef, who was not at all engaging and performed the obligatory tricks without any real showmanship or vigor. I was stuck with the dull chef, and I suspect he gave me the wrong cut of beef because filet mignon is NOT supposed to be so difficult to chew. Teppanyaki is also more fun if the people you're dining with are lively and engaged, because the chef feeds off the energy of his spectators. So, pick your dining companions carefully! We also tried out the hotpot, which we found more tasty and a better value. The majority of the platters are priced at $12 or $17, and with a large group, we ordered various platters so we could share. From among the choices of broth, the tonkatsu was the stand-out. Miso was decent, and the tom yum a bit on the spicy side. The ingredients were fresh. The salmon was particularly fine - it looked like it bordered on sashimi-quality. We came here on weeknights, and business was probably slower than the weekend traffic. Service was efficient and not chatty; I have no complaints.The restaurant's interior is huge, sleek, and modern. I was very impressed by how attractive it is.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"August 2018.\\nI was in Atlanta for the International Woodworking Expo. I always look for top restaurants as well as something I can't typically get at home in Central PA - like the pastrami made in the NYC Jewish delis. My pre-trip research picked Fox Brothers BBQ and Louisiana Bistreaux as my 2 special food stops. My first day at the Expo, I wandered the trade show, skipping lunch and planning to, as I am a big fan of BBQ, head over to Fox's after 2pm. I could smell the hickory smoke walking across the parking lot - it whet my appetite. I arrived around 3:00 to about a third full restaurant - no waiting. Inside, is a working man's neighborhood bar atmosphere - perfect for a BBQ joint. Most of the items on the menu seemed delicious so I got help from, Tiffany, my waitress and bartender. I settled on the beef brisket sandwich and, in season, they serve local batter-dipped fried okra. I chose both. Your beef can be served three different ways - chopped, sliced lean, and sliced with fat. I chose the latter. The sandwich arrived and was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, The okra was crisp and tangy. I was in heaven.We started smoking meat at home last summer - I bought a MAK 1 grill. None of the brisket I've smoked comes close to what I got at Fox Brothers.They sell meat to go, so I bought a pound each of the beef brisket and the pulled pork. I also bought 2 links of the smoked jalepeno-cheddar sausage. Only half of the sausage actually made it home. Ha ha ha.In the rarest of events, because I like to try different places while traveling, I cancelled my trip to Louisiana Bistreaux the next day and went back to Fox brothers for more of their beef brisket. A wise choice. This time I tried the Texas fries along with my sandwich.This is THE best place I know to go for BBQ - bar none."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Phenomenal.

The food tastes great, and it's got kind of an experimental tex-mex thing going on, mild salsas, lots of flavor overall.

I appreciate that.The drinks are strong, the Cadillac is tasty,and the prices aren't bad at all, I always get my bill expecting to pay more than I do.My Only Complaint (which means three stars intstead of 4): Everything  is a Cheese Blob.  I don't see why \\"mexican food\\" means drown it in melty cheddar and jack cheese (the authenticity argument is moot in this case, so don't start it). I am always scraping it off to some degree so that I can see what I'm eating underneath the amorphous dairy mass. If you get enchiladas, chile rellenos (which already have cheese inside, so search me), or anything like that with sauce and cheese on top, you aren't quite sure if you got what you ordered until you excavate a bit.Overall, it's got a kind of Chevy's action going on, but much much better, with decent vegetarian options, tasty food and great prices; I am never sad when someone recommends we go there.

I was very amazed with his bartending skills as he made this cool drink in front of us, complete with flames and burning sugar.We ordered the chicken and waffels, the corned beef hash and the biscuits and gravy.  They were ALL amazing, just as everyone had already commented.  The chicken and waffels were very delicious, the chicken had a tinge of peppery flavor and the waffels were fluffy and delicious.  The corned beef hash was also amazing and probably one of the best I've tried ever.  It was mixed with potatoes and was so well flavored.  The biscuits and gravy was also super yummy, with lots of gravy.  I was super glad that we split those 3 dishes, because the biscuits and gravy went AMAZINGLY well with the corned beef hash, I wish they had a combo of those 2!  And the chicken and waffels was a great addition.I highly recommened this place and I wish we had one like it back in my hometown.

Nobody is open past midnight?!) when I came in on a Monday night. Super hungry and super thirsty, Condados was my only option, and I am so glad it was! They have really decent prices for margaritas and although the kitchen was closed on Monday night, they still provided my group chips and salsa. When I came here Tuesday night (yes, you heard right, I came hear twice back-to-back), I even tried the tacos and they were amazing! You can actually make your own tacos by choosing the tortilla, the meat, toppings, etc. and they are all super affordable! I know that sometimes when people think tacos, they think of the tiny street tacos that are approximately 3\\" in diameter. WRONG! These are normal size tacos (6\\") so if you think about ordering six, reconsider! You may only need 2-3, that's how packed these tacos are. Dominica was our server and she was amazing - super attentive, funny, and just seemed to have a great personality.

I've had another salmon dish there with asparagus, ch√®vre dumplings, and smoked salmon, which was definitely made for salmon lovers like me. I've also had brunch there once, which I hope they start doing again, because that was great as well.

Also, when they give your bill, they throw in a pack of madeleines, which I think is an awesome (and delicious) touch. So yes, I love this restaurant a lot. I'll definitely be back. If you haven't tried them yet, you should most definitely give them a chance. Your tastebuds will thank you."},{"name":"Saffron","address":"3616 Far W Blvd, Ste 113","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Very good! Very authentic.

It was a nice day to sit outside. Took longer than usual to have someone take our drink order and finally order our entrees. The mussels for the app were amazing. Not impressed that much with the ahi. I thought it was pretty overpriced for what you get. A little overrated if you ask me."},{"name":"Black Fire Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"8594 Palm Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"My husband & I are very particular about our restaurant choices, because we value great quality food. This place delivered and exceeded our expectations! All of the meats were cooked & seasoned just right, the salad bar was really great quality and then to top it all off, the docc de leche cheesecake was fantastic! This is a 7 month young restaurant and should be the go to Brazilian place in Orlando!"},{"name":"DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana","address":"8000 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"So much to like: location, parking, greeting from Jimmy, scamorza (for touch-of-wood flavor, genius!), toppings, salads, self-locating buzzers.Please consider: Glassware. Please provide glass, not miserable plastic cups for the bottles of wine we're buying. Silverware. 'nuff said. We want a real place, where we come, on purpose, to eat and drink. Plastic is not good enough and doesn't fit. Don't blame the franchise, Jimmy! Make it as good as it can be!"},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I have been going here for 20 years and never once was I disappointed!  my favorite is the NW salmon saute, and my husbands favorite is the Bouillabaisse!  the bread here is incredible,  the desserts to die for,  and the drinks always great,  check out the hidden bar way way in the back in the last room in the very back,  its a sweet spot in this iconic Portland restaurant"},{"name":"Tasty Burger","address":"1301 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"In my experience, it wasn't terrible here. The man who served us was friendly. And we sat outside. The food was average in my opinion. Not anything I'd go out of my way to get. More like if I was in the area and wanted to grab some food, I wouldn't be against going.  It didn't strike me as anything out of this world or amazing. Pretty much an average burger and fries that you could pretty much get anywhere. I mean it's better than McDonald's or burger King obviously. But I wouldn't call it amazing."},{"name":"Nirvana Cafe","address":"510 SE Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"sweet people, comfortable and aesthetic environment, delicious food and drinks reasonably priced.  i really like and appreciate the laid-back atmosphere, the way they get things right for you or redo them, the wonderful sometimes funky art on the wall, the no-pressure-hang-out-and-enjoy-yourself ambience.  and across the street from a bookstore, which is heaven for me.  i recommend nirvana for its mellowness and tasty, varied menu.  try the nirvana smoothie - it really tastes like - well, nirvana!"},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Breakfast here is amazing. I got the Benedict with potatoes and boyfriend got the southern , both were fabulous. Suggest getting it to-go because its very small and kind of awkward with how quiet it was (maybe needs some music?) But don't let that stop u from trying it out. Also the iced coffee and iced tea are a must try. Didn't get a chance to check out the baked goods but definitely would give them a try if you have room."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(i=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return i.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],j={key:0},R={key:1};function H(i,e,s,f,r,n){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",O,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>r.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,r.searchQuery]])]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(n.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),o("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",j,"See more"))],8,N)):w("",!0)])}const L=c(F,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-7340a23c"]]),Y=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/37.md","filePath":"glossary/37.md"}'),G={name:"glossary/37.md"},Q=Object.assign(G,{setup(i){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(L)]))}});export{Y as __pageData,Q as default};
