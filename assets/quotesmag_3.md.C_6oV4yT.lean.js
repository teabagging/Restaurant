So they're doing the same amount of vodka as a regular mule, and topping it off with a smaller amount of ginger beer. The ginger beer--Cock n' Bull--is my favorite! It must be an Oregon product because it is in every bar. Anyway, it was a strong drink so some may say it's worth the money. I drink Moscow mules for the taste and fizz so the serving size was a little disappointing to me. Oh well!My boyfriend had a pretty pink drink, called a Rawhide. It was boozy.

I asked for suggestions that would best represent Chef Gabe's award winning style and my server suggested the trout (grilled and served on top of roasted squash and pears with toasted pecans and topped with a curried aioli.)  Wow!  Trout is actually one of my least favorite fish choices but this was superb and the flavors exploded in my mouth.  Thank you Kristin for that suggestion!Knowing I was going with the trout, Kristin had several wine suggestions and let me sample three with me choosing the one she suggested all along.  It was tasty!  I was surprised how large the portion of food was (which was a nice surprise) yet had my heart set on trying a dessert all along.  I opted to try a seasonal one in the cranberry upside down cake with ice cream.   it was delicious: light and the right size for 1-2 folks.

The Villa Restaurant in Wayland, wood panels and all, is fantastic.First off, there was a huge line to get seated on a Sunday night. The line moved fairly quickly, and the staff did not seem flustered, as they're probably used to it. Once we did get a booth, our waitress was courteous and friendly, if not a bit overwhelmed (totally not her fault, there were a billion people and the old women next to us were complaining about EVERYTHING). As for the food, holy crap. I loved everything we got - garlic bread and mozzerella sticks were perfect and CHEESY, and the marinara sauce was fantastic - not tons of chunks of random junk in it. For a meal, I ordered a pepperoni pizza (original right? I know, I wasn't in an adventurous mood) and when it came, it had a generous amount of roni, cheese, and grease (deeelicious). My faithful companion ordered lobster ravioli, which he said was delicious as well, and rightfully so at the price of $19 for a small serving. Overall, this place was great. Go for the food and the atmosphere, not the actual decor. Also, ladies, there are two bathroom stalls, one of which is blocked by the sink, and the other of which does not lock entirely. Embrace it."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Yes. You can't go wrong with a few freshly shucked oysters and a hot lobster roll here.

The service is good and speedy.My only gripe(s) is the size of the venue, which inevitably leads to long lines. That paired with no reservations equals long wait times. Worth it, yes for the first few visits, but not for a regular basis. Parking in the north end can be trick especially if theres an event going on at the Garden.

And smart people can see through the facade of a nice front, they want the substance. Lampligher, in my opinion has it.The beer: Lamplighter has an eclectic selection of beers that can please the palate of just about anyone. They have their crowd pleasers, such as my favorite, Ele, a saison that is as textbook saison as you will ever find. However, they also push the envelope and are willing to experiment with styles that other places might wait to see if the jury is out on it yet or not (for example single hopped orion 7 beers...the absolute worst in my book). The snacks: They're free.  5 $tars already for thatHave not checked out their coffeeshop by day...but do check out their brewery if you are a fan of trying out different styles of beer."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Dad and I went here last night for dinner to celebrate his birthday.

It was like an art piece - staying so still even though it had to cover a mound of fried chicken covered in gravy and cheese and egg. There's nothing else I could think of ordering on the menu except the Reggie Deluxe.  You cannot possibly go wrong with adding an egg to anything in your life.

I have ordered other things from Pine State, but my taste buds always silently chastise me for depriving them of the one thing they desire.  The Reggie Deluxe is a perfectly crafted arrangement of biscuit, cheese, bacon, fried chicken, more biscuit and gravy.  Speaking of gravy...  you should probably get extra.  It's almost mandatory if you want to keep the ratio of all the components of the Reggie Deluxe in balance to the last bite.

The broth was also too oily in my opinion. We also tried out the miso ramen, but similar to the chicken one, it left us feeling disappointed. It was very mediocre and lacks the complexity that you can find at other Ramen places, for much less. The price was also a bit pricey in my opinion. Total came up to $31 all up for 2 bowls of ramen.

A tiny building filled to the max by this owner operated coffeeshop. The owner is very passionate about coffee and has opted for the single origin route on his espresso. Offers several different beans to choose from. I ordered an espresso and a cortado. The espresso was in the style of G&B in LA: a lot of punch but somehow thin and not blessed with a ton of complexity. Crema is non existent, which is always a bummer for me. But this can be the risk of single origin: it takes a pretty phenomenal and possibly slightly green bean to get healthy crema and a complex flavor profile, but you can risk some sourness going for it that way. I also wonder if the temperature of the water was a little off as I've used the simonelli he has here before and it can be inconsistent at times. The cortado, however was excellent. The presentation was cool in a ceramic, one of kind cup and the ratio they used (perhaps slightly less milk to espresso than I've had elsewhere), really worked with the espresso, which shone with no more than 2oz of milk. While I didn't enjoy the espresso, the cortado definitely worked for me and I'll be back.

We'd heard about this place, there was a little buzz, so we got dressed up and hopped on the T to the Hynes stop (green line). So there's #1: easy to get toI said \\"were\\" going to have dinner & drinks here because, while at first having teensy cutesy burgers and martinis sounded great, once we got there and compared the size of the prices with the size of the burgers and the size of our wallets, we backed off on getting our eat on at this place.It is EXTREMELY dark in this place. Good for a date, or a night out with your homegirllzzzzzz. The walls of fire are cool, the tables and booths are cozy. The bar is EASY TO ACCESS - THANK GOD! Waitstaff is friendly and fit right in with the atmosphere. We definitely got a Sex & the City vibe from this place and would like to go back and nibble on those tiny burgers when we have more money and less appetite. I do NOT recommend just \\"getting a beer\\" and enjoying the mood. This place is known for martinis - let the bartenders use their talent for something other than opening your Heineken! We tried three different martinis - the Lemon Drop (this was mine, so friggin' great, like candy!), the Pink Panther (cranberry juice, Peach Schapps and some other thing), and the Apple Martini (don't remember what was in this one). They were all very very good, though and, like all the martinis, priced from $10.25 - $11.00. The good thing is that they give you the shaker with the rest of your martini along with your full glass, so really, you're getting a good drink and a half for your money.Wait for a table was 45 minutes, we got one in 30 minutes, but passed it on the next party, since we'd gotten our drinks and planned to go to The Otherside for a real dinner.

Also, thinking it would be authentic with a Japanese kitchen staff and ownership.  Therefore, this review was painful to write, in hopes of changes.  I am a world traveler and have eaten in all types of places, to include decades living in Japan.\\nBottomline, this is the worst Japanese-owned restaurant I have ever been to in Atlanta and the world.  The only thing somewhat good was the half Japanese waitress who did average work (which was exceptional relative to everyone else there) and appeared the only one that cared...and had a smile.  Not asking much, but if you feel that your visit - especially a new and first customer - is not appreciated (not asking for a welcome party - just simple gestures), then the business is going to die and honestly, the place \\"felt\\" it was already, dead, if not going out of business.\\nThe ramen was packaged.  The pork was the one pork slice that came with a packaged ramen...why, because the additional 2 slices that were ordered, was fresher and did not look like the one slice that came with a packaged ramen.  \\nEven the tempura shrimp, was packaged/frozen kind.  Probably to save costs, usually, bean sprouts are put in, but cabbage was put in...never ever ate at a ramen place that put cabbage - can get away with unsuspecting  non-Japanese, but not so.  For the price you pay, not worth it.  Better to go to Shoya, period.  The yakitori sauce was weak and not good.  Again, the worst I tasted.  The chicken, though, tasted fresh, but it is the sauce that counts on Yakitoris.  Sushi, extremely small and can see, trying to give very little.  Shoya will give 3-5 times the size more and fresh.  The owner, the older Japanse lady, had a nagging heavy smoker's cough while preparing food and never smiled.  The grill hood fan was probably out and that was the reason they kept the front door wide open and allowed the very cold air to come in and freeze the few that were inside.  Need to get it fixed.  Demeanor was angry, unhappy and tired.  Fair enough, maybe so, some of us are, due to life circumstances, but then, get out of the business and stop giving people unhappy experiences when they took the time and spent their money at your place.  Yes, they probably will say they do not need my money.  But that is just the point.  The waitress should find a better and happier place to work.

Dinner can be extremely expensive and totally mediocre. They have several tv's on which they play video compilations and live concerts. You never know what your are going to get...which is part of the fun. I've seen a lot of videos here. Some of the live concerts: Dolly Parton, Liza Minelli, Bette Midler, Celine Dion, Dead or Alive, Kandy Kane, Barry White, A Night at the Apollo...some of the video comps: Whitney Houston, George Michael, Bronski Beat (my favorite), Pet Shop Boys. \\nThose are just some I remember, but they probably have a couple hundred DVDs they'll play.

I wanted to head down Hawthorne and randomly stop at anyplace I had never tried, never heard of, and would never just go to if I was thinking about it.And, since it was Saturday night around 9:30, I wanted to park fairly close to it due to some large boxes in the back of my truck.Pulled into a parking space outside of two establishments, one of which was Jam.  A live band was playing inside and it looked spacious and had food.  I decided that this was it.Holy hell, did the gods of random shine down on me for this one!  Lucey, our waitress for the evening, came to us immediately and told us to sit anywhere.  A few people were already inside, listening to the live band, which was sort of jazz fusion group with big west african influences due to the hand percussion.  Very lively, very loud, very energetic, and pretty good for the tone of our night.So Lucey (as I believe I read the name on our check, though there might be a superfluous \\"e,\\" but I'm pretty sure this was it) got to us immediately, read off the beer list as loud as she could, and we ordered beers. I mention Lucey a number of times because she was fabulous.  Tattoos, piercings, stretched and gauged ear lobes, and incredibly nice and helpful.  She was the quintessential Portland person that will make or break a location.  My friend ordered a Rueben and I went with the Sweet Jesus, after deciding to vary from just a normal burger.Sweet Jesus!  I'll mention the Rueben, which my friend said was the best she had ever had.  It was huge, with a massive plate of fries.The Sweet Jesus.  A waffle cut in half, with an obscenely large fried chicken breast on top, with cheese, bacon, and a peach jalepeno jam.  I held off the maple mayo, but if anything would make me try mayo, that would probably do it.The size of this thing was massive.  I don't believe I've ever been served a larger plate and portion of food, ever.  Maybe a pizza once.  The chicken was very hot, and obviously just cooked.  The cheese was wonderfully melty, the bacon was crisp and plentiful.  The jam hits you at just the right point, providing a smooth, tangy taste that kicks in after the savory bacon and egg.  And the waffle!  I've never had chicken and waffles before, but I have had just waffles.  Probably one of the best I've ever encountered.  Warm, crisp on the outside, but super flaky and delicious when it hits the tongue, so awesome it almost melts on contact.Again, Lucey was on top of things, coming back several times to check on us and bring us fresh beers.  When I asked for the check, she was there quickly with it, and, again, quickly returned to pick it up.    The place started picking up around 10:30 when we headed out.  II could see it getting slammed.  I never would have guessed this as a breakfast place from the outside, though their breakfast menu is huge.   It looks like a bar with  a music venue, but their food is out of this world.

An added bonus is that they source locally and target only what's in season, which gives you a good-for-the-planet feel-good that makes you (slightly) less guilty when you inhale their fabulous fois gras.We found the restaurant, which is very unassuming from the outside, to be cozy and welcoming and the waitstaff--once we'd all warmed up a bit and we had a few exchanges in a now-lubricated French--were truly exceptional.  They took great care of us, giving helpful steers when requested and giving us good information about how long things would take as one of our party had a time deadline.I'm a devoted foodie who will be forever grateful to Bondir for delighting me with new ways to enjoy old favorites (dehydrated kalamata olives) and serving up some extraordinary new food items I'd never heard of.

As of today they have 173 reviews and a 4.5 star rating. That should be a sign in itself that if you're nearby and hungry, go here!But I'll go ahead and throw in my two cents. JJ's Grille is just dang tasty. I really think this is because it's family owned and it seems like the founders, (JJ and his mom, maybe others), are always present overseeing the food preparation and the service.They have two main flavors of rice, beans, cooked vegetables and toppings that you combine to create the bowl or burrito of your dreams. You move along the different items and someone adds them to your bowl or burrito as you like. From a more Mediterranean standpoint they have things like lentils and rice, tabbouleh, feta and tzatziki to choose from. On the Latin American side of things there is Fiesta Rice, black beans, pico de gallo and cheddar cheese. You can add fresh guacamole for an up-charge, and I always do. The guac is so fresh and delicious.  Oh and hot sauce, don't forget that. It's made in house and is just right for spicy lovers. You don't have to stick to one range of flavors. If you want you can mix and match between the different options.As far as meats, they're very juicy and flavorful. They have pork, beef and chicken. I would totally recommend the pork, but if you're like me and on a sort of health kick, then go for the chicken. It's fabulous. They have beer and wine which would be a nice compliment to one of the bowls or burritos. I also like that, as others have noted, most of the serve ware is compostable, not plastic. If the great food isn't enough to keep me coming back, I also like the people working there.

The fried green tomatoes were okay at best and the only real flavor came from the elote garnish. It seemed like hey forgot to actually season the tomato. The calamari...sure...we'll call it that. We got our burgers and they were pretty okay, you'll have no problem inhaling them if you're like us and just got off a flight. My biggest issue with the whole place was that it was JUST okay for being super expensive. $20 per burger with a ton of fries that you won't finish. All in all, our bill came out to $78 for really not worth it food. You're better off going to a quick service station.Also...the water tastes like licking a toad.

It just never struck me as a really good spot, it was just convenient.  They have a decent beer selection, but their drafts are pretty much the same price as bottles, which I don't really get.

The cherry stones are a nice throwback to my childhood. They do razor clams as well as anybody not named my Grandma. All of the crudos I've had there have been fresh and delicious. (Scallop, snapper, etc.) On Tuesday the special is sea urchin bucatini and it is ridiculous. It's very rich. Pancetta, sea urchin, peas and butter. For dessert, since they don't have dessert I had the Johnny Cakes: cornmeal pancakes with honey butter, smoked blue fish, and sturgeon caviar. It's super sweet & savory.

Really it's 3.5 but in this case I rounded up. The wait staff were really nice, wore Christmas hats, and removed our plates promptly.Lets start with the raw fish because that's always the star of the show and where the money is worth. Slabs of raw fish placed out on the counter, yet something was left to be desired. I must admit the surf clam and white tuna were good. However, the salmon wasn't a buttery goodness, the red tuna tasted like nothing like the salmon and at some point a batch came out dry and still icy, and the eel had...bones. :( that was my first emoticon written in all my reviews because finding bones in eel is a traumatizing experience. The rolls were interesting, pretty in fact as you can see in the pictures I posted, tasty but too cold for satisfaction since the rice had gone cold from sitting in the plates. Something that must be accepted since it is after all a buffet. I enjoyed the sweet potato and strangely that's the only one I remember on my palette. The sweet heart roll had a strange texture but was a great idea. They had the usual spider and dragon maki and others as well. The fish on the sushi were slightly better than just plain slab of fish.The hot foods were decent. Since it was a Saturday there was lobster. The steak was great and flavorful! I was surprised, it was tender and juicy cub ones. Lots of veggies, fried seafood, and a rice and noodle dish. There were also soup stations and am udon noodle station. lots of other raw foods like salads, marinated pieces of raw fish, oysters cooked and raw, king crab, and cocktail shrimp. Dessert was interesting. Fondue, ice cream, and assorted cakes and fruit. All in all, it's a similar arrangement like Minado as others have been saying and I'm pretty sure I didn't eat $40 bucks worth of food. For 6 people the bill came to be around $198, so per person including 15% tip it was $38. Quite an expensive experience. But if you want to try it for dinner look for a coupon in the college student coupon book, online, or just go for lunch when they first open at 11 or so something.I enjoyed my meal but I would probably prefer going to yamatos because their fish tastes and seems fresher even though there is a limited number of special rolls that you can order without paying an extra $1."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here on Saturday after seeing the reviews on Yelp and I wasn't disappointed.

We then told her this is our first time there and if she could offer any recommendations. She said the food portions there are smaller than average so you'll probably want to order an appetizer or a few meals to share.We wound up ordering a caprese salad and the meatballs ($12 for 3 meatballs I think is a little high...). The meatballs were delicious but the salad was just cut up mozzarella and tomatoes. No balsamic or anything so it tasted pretty bland. I even heard the table next to me say the same thing and requested some balsamic.Then comes our dinner. I had the baked cod my husband had a steak. The steak, medium rare, was extremely rare in the middle. And the potatoes were pretty bland. My fish was also raw in the middle and could have used some salt and pepper. The waitress apologized to us multiple times (not her fault, we understand). And took the cod off the total. We ended the meal with a glass of wine...and lo and behold there was a fly floating in it (that could have actually come from the bottle itself).Not a great first experience and for the price you pay for food there I'd expect better. However, they are constantly changing their menu to accommodate in season supplies available and I don't think the kitchen can handle such frequent changes in the menu...how can you perfect something if the menu always changes?

Not just a little schnitzel. Or a popular dish schnitzel. But ALL schnitzel. Still, Seven Hens was overall pretty good. Filling a niche in the lack of schnitzel based eateries in Sandy Springs, and perhaps everywhere, you could choose to get your schnitzel as a plate, or in a sandwich. Plates came with two sides, and there were a number to choose from. Sandwiches came by themselves unless you opted for a combo with fries and drink and an up-charge. They offered a number of pre-made geographically influenced options, from the traditional German to an asian influence, as well as the choice to \\"make your own\\" schnitzel, which allowed you to choose your own spices, sauces and topping. I opted for a traditional german schnitzel plate, with coleslaw and sweet potato fries as my sides. The schnitzel itself was very good. Fried well with a nice crispy exterior and moist interior. It was topped with beer sauerkraut and came with a dill caper sauce. The sauerkraut was decent, but the sauce was amazing. So good I was dipping my fries in to get every last bit. The sweet potato fries were crinkle cut and thin and not really my cup of tea, though my boyfriend really enjoyed them. Unfortunately, the coleslaw was, odd, and tasted like it was made with mustard instead of mayo. I can see how the extra tang of the mustard may have been good, but it just ended up tasting sour and strange and very underwhelming. I also tried either the Indian or Chinese schnitzel sandwich that my boyfriend ordered, but it wasn't very memorable, clearly, since I can't even remember which one he ate! Overall, the schnitzel was good. In it's original German form, it was very good. I'll probably be back here for more, and not just because there's a scoutmob for 50% off and I like cheap food."},{"name":"Thai Chili Basil","address":"373 Washington St","city":"Braintree","stars":"3.5","text":"Visited for first time.

And I swear the shiitake mushrooms made it feel less heavy...(was this my imagination)\\n-The biscuit is SOO good. nice crispy crust and soft fluffy insides.

I was left without any gravy to accompany the biscuit and fried chicken, and scraping the plate to catch whatever was left (wow this sounds incredibly sad...)

There are so many other flavors that the egg got lost so you could just get the Reggie. \\n-You have to pay extra money for extra gravy. I don't know how much more, but after sitting at my seat having hungrily waited for my plate to arrive, it was a little to late to have the patience or willpower to stand in line for more gravy as the hot food sat in front of me.

I was disappointed that there was no specialty drinks on the menu. We split a bowl of the Clam Chowder. The description said that it was not as thick and creamy as the traditional New England Clam Chowder. It was thinner and more watery but it still had fresh flavor and the clams tasted good. We both ordered the lobster roll sandwich. There was the option to get it either hot or cold. My husband ordered his cold and I got mine hot. I thought mine tasted very good at first, but they put so much butter on it the roll started getting soggy and falling apart. I also stared to feel somewhat sick afterwards from all the butter. My husband's cold lobster roll was a little better, but he really wasn't amazed either. We were expecting our meals to be better, especially for the price that they cost. It was better than a lobster roll we could get in Pennsylvania most likely, but for New England I was expecting it to be amazing.

Anything w/ scallops they do is pretty much a sure fire bet, but I think their Paella dish is amazing as well.The only thing I don't love is their wine list but it's pretty authentic as far as I can tell.

They're unpretentious, knowledgeable about the menu, and extremely patient.  The cocktails are fun, creative, and totally unique.  The prices are $7-$11 per cocktail, like you could expect, but it's one of the few places where I actually feel like it's worth the price.  I enjoyed the Horse's Neck quite a bit.  At $7 it's a steal.  Every dish but one (the seared tuna) was absolutely fantastic.  Flavorful, inspired, and served warm with a full explanation of the the plate.  The lamb chops and polenta were out of this world. My boyfriend loved the skirt steak.  We sent back the seared tuna and they immediately took it off our bill, 86ed it from the menu, and offered us two free deserts in compensation.  Could you ask for better management in this situation?  Don't think so.  It's definitely a \\"small plate\\" kind of restaurant.  Don't expect to order one dish and leave with a to-go box; it's not that kind of place.

Kit Kats, Twix included), which was cute. And helpful when you've been waiting forever.THE WAIT: About an hour around 3pm on a Sunday. I guess there's no lunch or dinner rush. It's just constant all the time. We did almost the entire Freedom Trail in that time. Another option is the Paul Revere house nearby - which can fill up to 30 minutes if you ask the docents a lot of questions.THE COST: $100 before tax/tip for 2 beers, 2 starters, 2 entrees.THE SERVICE: Great, no complaints.APPETIZERS\\n* Uni Toast ($4) - 4.5 stars\\nExcellent! I love uni, and this is a great spread on fantastic toast. Definitely a lighter texture of uni than you'd get on sushi or pasta, but still very flavor-intensive and heavy like a butter.* Neptune Johnnycake (honey, butter, Boston smoked trout, sturgeon caviar. $17) - 3 stars\\nThis was very unique to be sure, with sweet and savory seafood flavors mixed, but it was quite heavy! I wasn't too hungry and wanted a smaller dish for my meal, but the cake was a bit much, sitting in a layer of oil. The flavors are intriguing together but didn't work out as amazingly as I'd hoped. I wouldn't recommend this unless you are absolutely in love with some parts of this dish.SANDWICHES\\n* Maine Lobster Roll (toasted roll, hot w/ butter or cold w/ mayo. $29) - 5 stars\\nAmazing. You get a crazy amount of lobster, and it is incredibly fresh and delicious. I tried both hot and cold versions and they're good in their own ways. The hot version has much less flavoring/sauce than lobster rolls from other restaurants, but I like that there's much more focus on the classic taste of the lobster.

I can never say \\"NO\\" to a piece of raw fish (given that it's Sushi-grade). I was craving for ramen AND sushi. I didn't feel like venturing far into Portland and was looking for something local (in the suburbs). Mio Sushi (a Portland, Oregon chain) was on my bookmarks and decided to check it out one afternoon. I was not greeted with an \\"Irasshaimase,\\" (which means \\"Welcome!\\" or in other words, \\"I welcome your business\\"). But the employees were Asian, so I wasn't quite sure if this place was legit-ly ran by Japanese (not sure about the other locations).Side Note: My pet peeve, if places don't greet you by \\"Irasshaimase\\" then it's probably not an authentic Japanese owned sushi joint (my personal rule of thumb)[decor]\\nThe place seems clean, but since the building is a bit old, it may need a little makeover. You can sit at the sushi bar (limited spots) or at the tables (many spots). [devour]\\n*SASHIMI COMBO ($6.95 for HH; **3.5 STARS**)\\nThis included two pieces of each type of fish: tuna, salmon, and white fish. Each fish was sliced to an appropriate size and tasted like butter. My only gripe was that the happy hour price of the six piece sashimi was just as much as their happy hour roll prices, where you would get more pieces if you ordered a roll. For someone who is avoiding the rice and just wants the fish, it could be a pretty penny. But since this venue talks the talk about being \\"sustainable\\" - perhaps that is what you're paying for.*MIO RAMEN ($7.95) with CHICKEN (add $2; **1 STAR**)\\nI should've known NOT to order the ramen since their name emphasizes on \\"sushi\\" after all. That's my bad I guess. I got something that I could've made better at home. The broth was bland. The chicken was over-cooked. The ramen noodles pretty much tasted like instant-top-ramen. They also had broccoli in the ramen. And last time I checked, broccoli wasn't something that was Japanese home grown (Just sayin'). [drank]\\n*HOT GREEN TEA - I usually drink hot green tea when I consume sushi. I was told it is good for digestion (probably my mother told me that). Nonetheless, the green tea was your typical run-of-the-mill green tea. No surprises here.

Since moving here 3 years ago it's been my wife and I's \\"go to\\" for special occasions and just really great food. However, the past few times we've visited the has looked great but been bland, under seasoned, and/or over cooked. Tonight our salmon was dry, the hot chicken sandwich had no flavor and little spice, the champagne vinaigrette was the consistency of mayonnaise with no flavor. Service has gone down too. Tonight we asked for some lemon with our salmon and the server asked if we wanted lemon juice or slices... what we got was 3 circular slices of lemon in a glass from the bar. Apparently, according to our server, the new chef Ben started about 3 months ago (when we first noticed changes) and he was their 5th chef in a year and a half. Many of the staples of their formerly delicious menu are now gone too. The pickle chips (they have spears now but they're not as good), the buttermilk chicken sandwich, great dressings, etc. The fried chicken last month was dry, flavorless, and our server spilled an entire plate of food on our table and tried scooping the food back into the plate for us to eat before we asked for a new serving. We'll be taking a break from visiting KH5. Hope they can turn things around. Previous review: Never had a bad meal here. The fried pickles changed my life. The buttermilk chicken sandwich is a revelation. And their winter menu had a hanger steak with chimichuri that I still dream about. Don't walk. Run.

I went through the drive-thru and ordered a garden salad bagel with Garlic and Herb Cream Cheese. The woman taking my order did not understand and I told her three different times, the same order.  No big deal....or so I thought.  I received my order only to realize halfway down the street I got a dry bagel with some vegetables thrown in.  No cream cheese.  So I turned around and went back.  Instead of waiting thru the long line in the drive-up, I went in and asked once again, to have garlic herb cream cheese on the bagel. (Fourth Time)  The girl who took my order stated \\"i should have asked for it.\\" and walked away.  Now, keep in mind, I repeated myself three different times during the original ordering process in the drive up.  On top of that, the girl actually WROTE IT ON THE BAG WHEN SHE TOOK MY ORDER! \\"GRDN W/GRLC HERB CRM CHEESE\\"  At this point a manager came over and I advised her of the cream cheese debacle and showed her the bag. She called the employee back who took my order and asked her \\"did he say garlic and herb cream cheese?\\"  She said \\"No, I just wrote that on the bag, I just added that in\\" The manager looks to me and says:   \\"You must have not said it or she would have put it on.\\"  ..........Honestly, I was in disbelief.  So your employee wrote \\"grlc herb crm cheese\\" on my bag 'just because\\"? Right.At this point I didn't even care, I just wanted my bagel and cream cheese and to get the hell out of there.  The girl offers to remake it for me (Finally some Customer Service), but remakes it with PLAIN cream cheese.  I advised AGAIN (Fifth Time)...I asked for garlic and herb cream cheese.  She continued to argue and stated \\"You should have told me you wanted it.\\" ???? THE WHOLE REASON I CAME IN THE STORE WAS TO GET SOME DAMN GARLIC AND HERB CREAM CHEESE!  At that point I asked for it on the side, told her I would do it myself, and left.Horrible Customer Service.  Why on earth would you argue with a customer over .25 cents worth of cream cheese?  Who OWNS this place?You lost another customer Bagel World.

When I got there the place had 2 tables filled and it made the place look a little bare.  I should have taken this as a hint of what was to come.  I had the basic burger (includes lettuce, tomato, pickles) with additional toppings (.69 cents each) of jalapenos, tillamook cheddar, and bacon.  The bacon came out to be about 8.00 dollars, which isn't so bad if you want a quality burger.  My buddy got the french dip.  The food finally comes out and I take the first bite out of my highly anticipated burger.  My own hype of the burger was completely over from what I got.  I got a burger that was piping hot, which is good, but the burger patty seasoning was way over done.  There was too much salt and too much pepper on it.  Also with the added bacon it made it ever more salty.  The other ingredients tasted quite good.  I really wish the burger patty wasn't such a let down.  Every bite I took was extremely hard to swallow.  Good thing I ordered a cola.  My friend said the french dip was alright, not the best he's had.  It looked pretty bland and the roast beef was unappealing and lacking.  I love french dips, and this one was one that I would not order.  The service was a little slow, but that could amount to that there was only 2 people working.  1 in the kitchen, 1 doing the waitressing.  It was around 3 or 4 so I guess people were either on break or this is the usual staffing they have since it's the slow hours.   Once we did get seated the service wasn't too bad.

It was pretty packed, but that's because there aren't that many seats. A handful of two person tables, and a few larger ones. I ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen. Came out in a little over 5 minutes. It was hot (temperature wise), but not scorching. Spice was, I would say it definitely registers, maybe 4/10. Again, right amount, and not going to get in the way of being able to eat it. Broth is flavorful, the noodles were tender but maybe just a tad rubbery feeling. Serving bowl is pretty large. If you eat the whole thing, you're going to be stuffed. I got a water as my drink, so I spent less than $10.Next trip was dinner time on a Sunday. Hardly anyone in there, just another couple on a date and another gentleman by himself. I noticed that most of the people were not eating the sushi, so I guess they keep coming back for the cooked dishes too. This time I got a yakitori 5 piece appetizer-- chicken cooked on skewers, 3 were regular and 2 had grilled veggies. I would recommend the veggie one because the extra crunch and flavors were a nice addition. The chicken itself was tender, and the sauce was delicious. Unfortunately, it didn't quite seep into the meat and you were left with the flavor mostly on the surface of the meat. Decided to get the regular pork tonkatsu this time, and it too was really good. Flavor was savory and balanced, not too salty. It made you want to keep taking slurp after slurp. The service was decent, nothing outstanding in either direction. I believe the staff there is genuinely Japanese, which is always a plus if you're wanting Japanese food. It's quite unassuming from the outside, and there's not really a whole lot in that shopping center.

I ordered the BBQ Mutha Clucker, nice idea but excuted really bad. The bbq sauce is out of a can, the crust was decent, but once again, meh...the really problem was the assembly, the blue cheese, the onions and a big glop of bbq sauce was all thrown in the middle of the pie, yuck...Made for three really powerful blue cheese slices...The \\"chicken\\" was really tiny and was overpowered by everything else on the pizza, except for the one slice that was nothing but chicken.  \\nThe beer selection is nice and pints were served quickly, althogh our server reminded us three times that happy hour is over and the beers were regular price. We got that, we still wanted the beers. We were the only one of four tables in the place last night (rain) yet we had three different people serve us..a beer runner, a manager and our server, who wanted to tell us the beer was now more expensive again.

Perfectly cooked rice, absolutely perfect levels of salty, sweet, sour, and spice, a gorgeous crispy fried egg still liquid in the middle, beautiful fragrant herbs, crisp cold veggies - this place is all about the precision execution.

I found the chicken to be pretty spicy.The downsides for me were the value for what you're getting. Both meat dishes were $17.95 each and for that price, it should have been loaded with meat. Instead, there was a lot of veggie fillers and very little meat. With that being said, the japchae and seafood pancake have great value for money - the portions for these dishes are quite generous.

It is sugar overload so definitely worth splitting it with a friend or two (or consume the whole thing over the span of 2 hours if you're like me). They are also quick to run out of these depending on the day so definitely go in early to grab one!But, if you are allergic to nuts, their cinnamon rolls are a close second to the sticky buns. The dough is light and airy, and the glaze is not overly sweet. One of the best cinnamon rolls I've had!Berry Bread Pudding: I went wanting to try something different from the usual Sticky Bun I get. So, I decided to get the Berry Bread Pudding (given that I love berries). This bread pudding was not too sweet and the berries gave it a sweet, tart freshness.

The grits were covered in a runny tomato based sauce which made them runny also. The andouille  sausage tasted like dish soap. My friend could not finish her corned beef hash due to runny and overpowering horseradish sauce. YUCK!!!!!  I do want to mention the cinnamon roll we shared was excellent.

The chips were freshly fried, but not long enough. They were soft. The lobster wasn't real, it tasted like fake Krab and the bacon looked like they used bacon bits from a jar. Wasnt bad, but certainly not worth $11 and definitley not lobster. The other app was the shrimp and grits. It was served with a tomato sauce which I found unique from any other shrimp and grits Ive had, not really in a good way. The blackened shrimp served with it were delicious. It wasnt bad, but I doubt I would order again, and I love shrimp and grits. For our entrees we both had the Crab cakes with crawfish etoufee. The crab cakes were stocked full of crab, but with the canned claw meat. The etoufee didn't taste like it was made fresh and it was served luke warm at best. It was served with what tasted like frozen veggies. For $29, I would expect A LOT better ingredients and more flavor.

Unfortunately this wasn't the case. To begin with, our anniversary was never acknowledged, even though when making the online reservation it asked for special requests and I said it was our anniversary. No special dessert offered, not even a \\"Happy Anniversary\\" from the hostess or waitstaff. Nothing! Last year we went to Davios for our anniversary dinner and were made to feel very special. Almost went back there and probably should have. More on this later. \\nWhen we were seated there was a red wine stain on the white tablecloth, which made me wonder if the table had been cleaned. When the waitress noticed it she said \\"oh how did that get there?\\" but didn't offer to change it. I felt that she was accusing us, even though we were not drinking red wine.\\nWhen ordering our meals we both asked for slight changes which we were assured was \\"no problem\\". I asked for the peppercorn sauce on the side with my swordfish and my husband switched out the potato offered with his steak fritte for pommes frites. Both our meals arrived without these changes. An oversight? Twice? I will say that the server apologized and made the changes promptly. On a more positive note...both our meals were absolutely delicious.\\nOur issues were definitely with the poor service. Our waitress seemed inexperienced, was inattentive and not the least bit friendly. We had to wave her down several times to refill water glasses.\\nSo after this disappointing Anniversary dinner...I received an email from the Gaslight asking for a review. I sent the review stating all of our issues. A few days later I had a voicemail from one of the owners saying he was sorry they \\"dropped the ball\\" by not acknowledging our Anniversary.

I had the crawfish etoufee, with sides of dirty rice and the potatoes. So. Stinking. GOOD. Well seasoned potatoes that didn't argue with my etoufee but complimented it just right, the dirty rice was bright and peppy, and I asked for a 5/10 on the spice of my etoufee and it was just about right for me, enough heat at the end that I could taste it, but not enough to obliterate  my palate. The crawfish were perfect, tender and you could actually TASTE them!!!!  Perfectly made, and each entree was cooked to order.  Takes a little longer but worth it, worth it, worth it!!!  So cheap, stupid delicious. The jambalaya full order will feed one person for three meals easily, so consider this before going all out and ordering the full sized :). If you leave this place hungry it's because you weren't trying. And every bit of food I had was perfect. We will be coming back, often and with glee. This is seriously some of the best Creole I have eaten, including places in Louisiana.  The sweet tea that is local that they serve here is great too!!

The Chef chatted with us for a minute when he wasn't working 8 pans. :) Southern hospitality all the way. The Ambiance: This is designed as a take out place, so if you are looking for a sit down restaurant, move along. They do have some seats and we ate in.  If you are a snob and feel uncomfortable in an ethnically and economically diverse neighborhood, also move along.  You might be approached by a homeless person, but you're not going to get stabbed. People keep saying they wouldn't go there at night, and I guess I get that, it's not a 'nice' area in that there are empty buildings and some run down homes. It's not Easton Mall.  But it's also not like it's in a war zone or there were muggings and drive by shootings occurring at lunch. It's not like folks were shooting up in the parking lot. Seemed like most urban areas that had a manufacturing base, a little run down, in need of some TLC and new opportunities. I'm super irritated when people confuse the terms \\"run down\\" and \\"dirty\\". the front counter is a little beat up, and the floors could use a coat of paint. But this place is clean! It's a KITCHEN. There should be the occasional bits of food or flour on the floor, cause folks are working.

The impossible long wait (during brunch, at least); the pretentious ingredients on the menu, half of which I've never heard of; the minimalistic urban chic decor; the \\"small plates\\" and tapas-style dining; oh, and it's expensive. But god damn, is the food good. Like really good. Like the food is so good, I'm overlooking all of this nonsense and saying yes, this is among my favorite restaurants in Portland.The problem area is brunch, frankly. Roll up on the weekend and expect to wait an hour or more. The steak and eggs (yes, steak and eggs, everyone) is one of my favorite dishes in the city. The cornmeal pancake... the jalapeno butter... the chunks of medium rare steak... the cheddar eggs. It's almost worth the wait. Almost. I'll take someone from out of town here for brunch for the Portland experience, and the food makes it worth it, but it's hard to justify it otherwise. Even though it's good.Fortunately, dinner is an easier meal to get to here, and the dinner menu has it all over Tasty-N-Sons. It's steak focused, most of the steak is excellent, but the star of the menu (believe it or not) is the Brazilian fish stew. I see that skeptical look on your face, but trust me: it's awesome. Just order it and you can thank me later. Still, the steaks are solid. It's not quite Mastro's, but their cut selection is wide and interesting, their adornments are delicious, and their meat is at least on par with Laurelhurst (which, let's face it, is pretty damned good).  I'm in love with their radicchio salad (I prefer this version to its Tasty-N-Sons counterpart).

It's in a small strip mall near Reed and Henderson in UA. So glad we found it!Cibo has a smaller dining room, but it seems like a more upscale, neighborhood restaurant.We started with the Arancini, mainly because it seemed different than your typical appetizer. It was delicious! You get two fried spheres- it's homemade mozzarella wrapped in proscuiotto wrapped in saffron risotto and fried, served with a slightly spicy roasted red pepper sauce. My husband got the herb grilled Lombatello steak, which came with balsamic onions, roasted potato slices, a fresh arugula-tomato salad and a mint pesto. Everything on the plate was absolutely amazing. 'Nuff said!I went with their special of the night- good ole' spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs had a lot of flavor and I really liked the sauce, which was similar to the spicy roasted red pepper sauce that came with the appetizer. We ended with the Bonet ala Piedmontese, which our waiter nicely pronounced for me! It was a chocolate espresso custard with an amaretti cookie crust, topped with caramel and some whipped cream. It wasn't my favorite dessert, but I loved the creativity. My husband really liked it. Our waiter was friendly, but not too much so. He was extremely knowledgeable about the food, how it was prepared and what it tasted like. He really seemed to have a passion for the food they were serving.He asked how we found Cibo and said he wanted to make us regulars! One of the managers also stopped by to ask how our dinner was.

There are no changing tables, and when I asked if they had somewhere that I could change my 4 month old, the girl just kept saying \\"I don't know.\\" She had no suggestions, didn't ask anyone else, and when I asked if no one had ever needed to change their baby there before she said \\"I guess not.\\" No empathy or consideration for my situation. For someone working in the service industry, she sucks at customer service.

I asked the bartender if he could make me something else.  I was feeling like a pear martini or something pear like.   He said \\"no..I can only make what is on the menu\\".  I'm pretty certain a bartender at the 99 would have responded better than that.  We settled for something he \\"could\\" make on the drink menu.  A few minutes later I was perusing the top shelf scotch when another quite lovely bartender asked if I had questions.  We chatted a bit and he gave me a lesson on Scotch 101 and shared with me that he came over from England 20 years ago.  he even told me he was going to see his mom on Mothers Day.  I then asked if we could order food at the bar (our server never offered).  He responded \\"absolutely, here is a menu\\".  This bartender was handling a section of the bar to our immediate right as well as the service bar yet he still had time to chat with us and even provide a high level of service.  I'm quite sure he would have made me any cocktail my heart desired.  I will visit again but I will certainly not sit in the section with \\"said\\" bartender.

Surprised to learn how big Lincoln Tavern was - looks like they bought out the storefront on the opposite side of the block, and just knocked out the back wall. Also surprised to learn how loud Lincoln Tavern was. This got worse after 10pm, when the lights were dimmed to better attract their target demographic.Pizza was good. Not Area 4 (Cambridge) good, but certainly at the Mangia/Upper Crust level. A winner was the butternut squash/blue cheese pizza, which was a terrific blend of sweet/savory sophisticated enough to be suitable for adults. Crust was good; I wonder if they use the same starter used for the table bread, which was spectacular. If they don't, they should consider it.Entrees were okay. Fried chicken was certainly crispy, but not quite paradigm changing. Hanger steak was cooked to perfection; unfortunately, while the steak was restaurant quality for sure, it lacked that sweet beefy punch that really premium meats offer - such as at the Butcher Shop (South End), or pretty much anywhere in Chicago.The upside to such a large restaurant is that they could easily accommodate at 17-person dinner reservation with two days notice.\\"I'd like a yearly audit of how much money I spend here!\\"\\n- overheard from a 20-something Red Sox hat-wearing Broskie smoking outside"},{"name":"Don Pedro","address":"5900 NE 4th Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"You know I have driven by this place a thousand times but it didn't look appealing to me.

Certainly.So, the first time I had the chicken supreme. Yum. Not too spicy - even with their infamous salsa verde. And let me tell ya somethin' - it was indeed supreme. Yeah, baby. To be honest, Efrain's had me at hello - or rather at the guacamole. You know, it wasn't anything fancy - but sure tasted great and looked nothing like the kryptonite green fake guac I once (ONCE) endured at Las Delicias. Let me talk about this salsa verde for a moment though...my dining partner loves it so much that during the ol' college days, they would purchase gallons of it and have it shipped to Oregon or travel with it on the plane.

The margs there rock - and i consider myself to be a bit of a margarita aficionado. I was feeling pretty crazy that night, so I went all out with the chicken chimichanga. Deep fried goodness. Heck yeah! The \\"changa\\" arrived and once again - thrilled. We also ordered a veggie taco - which by the way - are delicious and massive. I mixed my rice in with the beans and I was well on my way to a happy stomach. Oh and the margs - did I mention that they're great? Because they are.The service there has also been consistent - friendly, accurate and just what you would expect at a place like Efrain's. I can't wait to go back! And you know what?

A bunch of lettuce with a couple shaves of onion and hearts of palm, overripe tomatoes and cucumber. $15!! Before being served, I was informed that the avocados weren't ripe, so did I want a substitution...what??!! I said okay, more bacon. I'm given the salad, with no extra bacon, then a few minutes later, the chicken that they forgot to put on the salad...again what??!! The Skillet Pesto ($13) was inedible and had to be returned (which they took off the bill). The plate looked as if someone actual just threw up the food; watery, horrible mess!

We ate here last year around Thanksgiving and it was one of the better experiences I have had in Austin in terms of fine dining.  The atmosphere is a cute little house with an upscale vibe.  Our waiter was incredibly helpful especially since we were pretty inept in determining which European wine to order.  Service was top notch the entire time.  The food was all perfectly prepared and delish.  We are heading back again this weekend so I will be sure to update with specific dishes.  And, I will be certain to knock stars if this experience does not match my first.  However, I am sure it will because this restaurant is a favorite of several of my Austinites friends.Update - It pains me to do this, but I had to knock a star.  My first experience at Zoot was five star, the second was less than three but I still think the food deserves praise.  I was with Russell P. and three others who ordered the NY strip.  It came out and we were convinced that it was the tasting menu portion and this was an accident.  It was not.  They do not list their ridiculously tiny (for the price) portions on the menu.  4 oz. does not cut it.  The food is still stellar but this time our service was horrible.  Our waitress was so quiet you could not hear a thing she said and almost seemed terrified to do her job.  One salad was late to the table and they forgot pepper until I asked.  The support staff was great but all in all, this was a disappointing experience...one I probably will not have again."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"(+) The Reggie biscuit sandwich\\n(+) Hash browns\\n(-) waited about 30 minutes to order\\n \\nDo you ever crave biscuits and gravy? The simplicity of it makes it so great, but I have great news. Pine State Biscuits not only offers your signature biscuits and gravy, but also serves biscuits sandwiches and other hearty breakfast foods. Pine State Biscuits is one of those \\"have to go\\" places when visiting Portland. Here are the rest of my thoughts:\\n \\nFood: I ordered \\"The Reggie\\" biscuit sandwich. One of the popular sandwiches on the menu, between the two biscuits are a hefty piece of fried chicken, slices of bacon, cheese, and gravy oozing out of the sandwich. The gravy has a kick to it, but was the x-factor in the sandwich. The piece of fried chicken was tender and the size of the chicken extended beyond the diameter of the biscuits. The bacon and cheese didn't need to be there, but they just completed the sandwich.  My girlfriend ordered \\"The McIsey\\" biscuit sandwich. This unique take of a biscuit sandwich also comes with fried chicken, pickles, mustard, and Bee Local honey. I was taken back at the sauce that made the chicken taste so much better. The honey sweetened the mustard and created this sauce that tasted really good with the biscuit. We also ordered a side of hash browns. Look at the picture I took, but two people definitely could share it. The hash browns were so tasty because they were cooked in a thin layer, so both sides (top and bottom) were extra crispy, and there was lots of butter. There is no need for ketchup; the hash browns already have enough flavor.\\n \\nAmbiance: Pine State Biscuits is a order first, then grab your table and eat type of restaurant. There is usually a line out the door because there isn't much room to create a line inside the restaurant. Don't worry, there is a heat lamp right above the over hang where people usually stand to wait. There are a few barstool/ tables inside the restaurant, but most of the guests are seated in an outdoor covered patio like seating. Don't worry about being cold, because the patio room is insulted and there is a heater that makes everything better. I would recommend seating outside because it is pretty noisy inside. You have guests walking back and forth and that can be distracting in a way. \\n \\nService: Everyone you encounter is friendly. Once you order, you are given a number so the servers can find where you are seating. The servers call out the food item, but I wish they told us where to find utensils and things of that nature. You have to pick up your own utensils, but the napkins are located on the tables. You also have to bus your own table. There is a tub where you can put your dirty dishes. \\n \\nParking: Park on the streets nearby. We found a spot on one of the side streets.\\n \\nOverall, I would recommend anyone who is visiting Portland to try Pine State Biscuits. If you love breakfast, definitely come here because they have a bunch of new things you have never even heard of. Like who has ever thought of making biscuits sandwiches in the first place? When I come back, I want to try the Hash ups, which is hash browns, but it topped with grilled onions, mushrooms, melted cheese, and you can add any meat. Doesn't that sound so great?"},{"name":"Wai Wai Restaurant","address":"26 Oxford St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"this place always astonishes me\\nthe food is real good, especially since it actually tastes like 'home cooking' and the prices are unbeateable!\\nif you don't mind the poor decor, the fact that you might be the only people there (and the place is only like 6 four-tops!), and that you won't get that great of service then this place is for you!\\nplus it's always an adventure to venture deeper into chinatown!"},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great atmosphere.

I added the Real Maple syrup which was a good idea as the regualr syrup did not have as much flavor as I would have liked. What I got was two plates FULL of food (YUM)! Didn't finish the pancakes as there were a lot of potatoes. The omlette was rather large and delicious. Very good deal for about $25 for th two of us considering the amount of food. Coffee was very good also. My wife and I sat in the back in a corner booth and the first thing I noticed was that the rather large air intake in the ceiling looks like it hadn't been cleaned in a LONG time. LOTS of dust.

We ordered the Korean fried chicken, bi biim bop and the steak and cheesy eggs with cornbread pancake. Everything was really good, however the steak with the cheesy eggs and cornbread pancake was amaaazing. That hands down was one of the best brunch dish I have tasted in a long time. The steak was seasoned perfectly, and the pancake was soft and buttery. The waitress said the Korean fried chicken is the most popular dish. It is very flavorful and tasted great with the rice and pickled veggies on the side. I would try this if you feel a little more adventurous. The bi bim bop came with slices of pork belly which was tasty, but I would have chosen the other two dishes than the bi bim bop dish.

Franks, I thought was OK until you actually go into the place. The Counter Help, ignorant, the place itself, dark and dirty... Where I come from its for one of 2 reasons, one they are just lazy and it is dirty, 2 there is some shady stuff going on. I think those two fall in line here... But this post is about the pizza... If I could power my car with the grease that was on it, I would be there every day... getting back to the counter help, and tip to the owner/wife/whatever... if you screw something up, and you know it, don't argue and blame the Customer... it's not the Customers fault... If you cannot hear what the customer is ordering, maybe, just maybe, you should either pay closer attention and shut your trap while taking the order, or tell the others around you to shut the hell up so you can take the order... either of them would do....One last thing... your pizza is not the greatest, and you really need to understand that. At the same time, take a look around the neighborhood, and try to stay in line with neighborhood pricing... The post before mine, Sherri S. same thing happened here... I ordered 2 pizzas, got one, price $16.49... The pizza itself looked like a 10 inch pizza?  A 10 inch pizza where I come from is a small, not a large... I could order a small with EVERYTHING I imaginable that I could think of where I grew up; and it still would not cost $16.49. I could have gone down the street, to Papa Gino's and got 3 better pizzas for the same price.... and I would have gotten a smile there... Coming from me, that is a complement to Papa Gino's... a Franchise chain....So to all of you out there, cut through the parking lot, around the back of the building out to route 53, take a left at the first set of lights, on the left, Papa Gino's... and if you keep going straight about a mile maybe two, you will come upon Capone's...

We notified the waitress, and although she offered to correct the mistake, by the time she came back with the news, we weren't in the mood for more nachos.We ordered something else, and the rest of the meal was okay...although the music volume and selection was very unappealing.In the past, servers and managers would go the extra mile to make us feel important and taken care of. As a result, we've spent thousands of $$ at their establishment over the years. This time, however, we were told that because we ate some of the chips (and ordered guacamole), we would be charged for nachos and guacamole. Even though we voiced our displeasure, we were informed that the manager said that was the best they could do. Overall, the discount we received for the major mistake was about $2. The money issue was not the most disappointing -- it was being left with the feeling like we're not important to them as customers. We were left with a bad taste in our mouths, and because of that, will probably never go back to The Local for a night out.Hopefully this was a very limited experience for their customers, but I noticed that all servers and managers had changed. Maybe this is their new customer-service policy?"},{"name":"Caf√© Kathmandu","address":"2779 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I was quite surprised by how tasty everything was.

The temp outside was the SAME as the temp inside. So I don't know if the AC was even ON. DRINKS: Beer list is decent. Glad to see some quality bottles. I should've just stuck with the beer.People raved about the strength of the cocktails. I should hope they were strong b/c the Specialty cocktails were a bit expensive. I've been to other \\"same\\" lounges that were significantly less. I even had a bit of an issue with a Specialty Cocktail that was $8 on the menu, got my receipt and it was $9+. It rung up as $9 then there was tax. I just brushed it off and figured I don't quibble about the extra $1. Pointless at that moment. It was delicious though. So that was a plus. The bartender was nice enough to give me a small coke for free at the end of the night  since I was driving home. FOOD: I got there late so I didn't get to meet my friends for food. The menu looks delicious though and I look forward to coming back and trying a bunch of entrees. OVERALL: Aside from the cocktail prices and lack of AC, the place was nice.

The food and drink were delicious, but I will say that the only reason this review doesn't have 5 stars is the price of the food. The cioppino was $39, and honestly I think it was about $5-10 too much for the quality of the food.

I really really do. But it just fell short. Not even short. Flat, flat on its face in the middle of MSG with a sold out crowd. I love the concept of farm to table and the whole vibe of the restaurant is right up my alley. Let's get to my usual breakdown so I can explain.The Decor: At a glance Scratch gives off this great hipster chic vibe without trying to hard. I love the vintage touches and textiles. Plus all the knick knacks are quite touching. However the execution of the decor fell short for me because while appealing to the eye it wasn't comfortable to dine. The room was warm to me from the start and I did hear other tables complaining about the temperature. With such a small space it's interesting to me that they couldn't provide enough either ventilation or a/c. The seating was also very uncomfortable. From the textiles to the textures the seating was scratchy, no pun intended, and hard. It didn't make for good seating at all.The Service: In the beginning I was nicely greeted by the bartender and seated very quickly. After a few minutes I was pleasantly welcomed by my waiter who, after allowing us to browse, took our order promptly... and that was the last time I saw my waiter before my check was delivered. Each server that visited our table was very friendly, they just didn't come by except to drop off our food. Speaking of, for such a small place we sat with dirty plates on our table for quite sometime before we had to flag someone down to take our plates. If i were going to rate the service alone I would sadly give them a 2/5 just because I feel like giving one star is just plain rude.The Food: My mother said if I can't say anything nice, I shouldn't say anything at all. But my mother isn't on yelp so I can say what I want. The food, while high in quality, was terrible. I mean really really bad. The chicken was salty, the corn lacked rounded flavor and seemed unripe (is that the correct term), just everything was missing the mark. I had such huge expectations and I just felt deflated, underwhelmed, disappointed, and every sad adjective that you can say. I did give them a star for presentation. Because if there is one area they did perfectly was presentation of the food. The  chef really showed their refinement and attention to detail in the execution of the presentation.Overall I wouldn't come back or recommend Scratch to anyone. I've talked to other people and it seems they're either a hit or miss. I guess I just went on one of the very big MISS days"},{"name":"Fratelli","address":"1230 Nw Hoyt St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Next door to Oba & looks like a wine bar.

Every time we've been in, the wait staff seems stressed and like it is annoying to have customers dining with them- not the impression you want to give.

It was so full of flavor, it needed no salsa (which was lackluster) or hot sauce. Every bite produced a deep growl of primal satisfaction.

I'll wait until it's near me.\\" \\"$17 for lunch from a food truck? I'll do it when I get paid.\\" \\"They probably don't use a lot of lobster, so I don't know... And it IS a food truck, after all. How well can they manage lobster? We'll see.\\" \\"I'M NOT LEAVING BED TODAY.\\" All of these sentences were among the endless list of lame ass excuses that prevented me from GETTING THAT LOBSTER ROLL. And who paid the price? This guy. The lobster is perfect. I'll dare to use the word succulent, and I hate that word because it makes me feel weird. The chunks of meat are rather large and they keep shredded scraps to a minimum. They use a lot of meat as it was practically falling out of the bun. I ordered the Maine style roll, which is the cold version dressed with their homemade mayo, seasoning, and scallions. The bun is delicious in and of itself. The mayonnaise isn't overwhelming and lets the meat be the star that it is. The scallions are an accent, which is what they're meant to be. I'm going to say hands down that this is the best lobster roll I've ever had. And like someone who would say something like that, I'll follow it up with the sentence \\"and I've had a lot of lobster rolls.\\" Garbo's knows their product and thank god for that. The slaw that comes on the side is some of the most refreshing slaw that I've ever had. I'm not really sure how they accomplished that, but kudos to them because usually I find it a take-it-or-leave-it type of thing. It's a bonus, of course, if they're nearby, but Garbo's is worth making the journey to. It's a filling, satisfying meal that also has the benefit of being obscenely delectable. As far as pricing goes, it's actually a total deal considering the amount and quality that you're getting.

Lebowski knows darn sure what he is doing back there. The burgers are the perfect amount of juicy. The bun is buttered and flavorful.

The main thing going for it is that the seafood is ridiculously fresh. I guess for a place with such high ratings my expectations were a little high. We started with a dozen oysters from around the Massachusetts and Canada ways, which were good and fresh. The oysters were followed by an anchovy dish and a hamachi crudo dish - both were delicious. The crab bisque was very flavorful, but I would have liked a lot more crab - it felt like there may have been the equivalent of only one crab leg. The lobster roll in butter was packed with lobster, but seemed plain. I know most lobster rolls are plain, but I would have liked a fun seasoning or some sort of twist to be added. The food was good - I would give the anchovies and the hamachi 4 stars, but the other dishes 3.5 stars.

The teriyaki  chicken tips over brown rice is a great healthy alternative to eating fried foods and quite tasty.

We chose to go to Tasty n Alder on a Sunday night based upon the reviews we saw here on Yelp. Unfortunately, the restaurant we dined at did not seem to reflect the glowing reviews. When we came in the door, nobody greeted us. Staff passed by the entrance but never looked up or even acknowledged us. It took over 5 minutes before we were asked: \\"how many?\\" The staff here could not have been more impersonal. They seemed bothered to answer questions, serve and wait on our table. Having grown up in Portland, it was a surreal experience, especially for a place like this that is not cheap by PDX standards. The quality of service does not match the prices. A little warmth goes a long way. And then the small portions of food for $15-$24 a pop arrived. Completely underwhelming. It was honestly, just \\"okay.\\" Outside of the Duck, Duck Potatoes, not one of us in our party enjoyed what we had ordered. And to make matters worse, one member of our party had symptoms of food poisoning the following day after having the scallops. She can't be certain it was that dish, but she was the only one who had it. Maybe we caught the kitchen and staff on a bad night, but the mediocre food quality, poor service and $30 per person made for a very disappointing experience. Note to owners: train your staff!

I was immediately greeted upon my arrival and offered a variety of samples. I ended up going for the Cookies n' Cream, which I thought was pretty tasty. All of the ice cream here is coconut milk based and sweetened with agave. Out of the several different flavors I sampled, I could taste the coconut in all of them, so if you're not a fan of cocounut, you most likely won't like FoMu. Obviously there's not much they can do about that though and I'm not complaining -- I love coconut! Surprisingly, they don't have a coconut flavor but if they did, I'd totally order it. **HINT HINT** **WINK WINK**At the end of the day, I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to go to FoMu again, but if I was in the area, which I normally am, I'd totally be down for some vegan ice cream.

Even though you have to wait an extra 15 minutes for the hot stone bowl, do it!! It comes with some carrots, peas, and black beans cooked in, which was a nice surprise. The stone bowl also crisps up the edges of the rice for a nice texture. Don't worry about scraping the rice off the sides of the bowl, just pour your soup in to loosen things up!Side note on the side dishes (hah!): the cucumbers and bean sprouts were both really good!

But I honestly thought their sushi was bad (even if it is super duper cheap.)  We went there on a whim with our in-laws for dinner and from the start, it seemed to be a good place.  It was bustling with lots of younger groups of teens, early 20s, along with a few famiiies, so I'm thinking 'great - this place is going to be good.'  Was I ever mistaken.  We ordered some sashimi and some rolls - I think two different types of tempura rolls.  Honestly, it's impossible to go wrong with an sushi that has fried bits of this or that in it.  The tuna and salmon sashimi on the other hand was AWFUL.  When it arrived on its little chop board, each sashimi piece was huge and probably a 1/2 inch thick.  Ok, that's a little strange - normally sashimi is small and kind of melts in your mouth, but whateves, I'm open to something different.  After taking the first few bits and asking for a fork and a knife because we actually had to cut the sashimi, I was over it and slightly disgusted.  Who's ever heard of needing to cut sashimi with a knife and chew it like a piece of steak?!  Later on, when we wanted refills on our tea (mind you, it was only our second refill), we had to waive our server down for about 10 minutes before she would even look in our direction.  So hmmmmm...I'm not such a fan of this place.In full disclosure, we do normally go to Sushi Town for middle of the road sushi or if we're feeling a bit more spendy we'll go to AKA To-Bo, which is our favorite place.

I read the rave reviews, had friends that loved it and couldn't wait to get in. This was going to be the highlight of my dining experience. Oh boy was I let down. We only had to wait for 45 minutes because we got in right as they open. We were seated at the bar. A word of caution, you are cramped at the bar and of course, everyone is bumping into you moving back and forth in the restaurant. It's really packed and I noticed there were not a lot of locals in the restaurant. This place seemed to cater to the tourist crowd. So time for moment of truth. I wanted to have what everyone is raving about. I ordered the clam chowder and lobster roll. The chowder had a great taste, plenty of potatoes and clams but was really salty. The famous hot lobster roll was well... underwhelming. Yes it's a ton of lobster meat but it was rubbery, overcooked meat. I felt like I was chewing forever just to eat the sandwich. No taste either on the lobster. It was hot bland mess. My mom couldn't even finish it because the lobster was so chewy. The best part of the dish were the fries and that's even a stretch. I really feel for the price tag of $92 (soup, lobster roll and one beer), I should have a meal that was edible. I don't mind paying extra for a meal but it has to be good. Complete disaster! I could go to Union St and get a better, tastier lobster roll. The one bright spot was our waitress. She was such a sweetie. Filling up our water and apologizing for how long our food was taking in the kitchen. I only wish her excitement could match the quality of food being served. This is an one and done. I tried it but I won't be back.

For our party of 7 it was about a 4 hour wait.The best thing at Neptune Oyster was their lobster roll. They packed the roll with so much lobster that it was overflowing. It was so warm and buttery! (We ordered a second round!) The fried clams were also a favorite of the group. I'm a huge fan of clam chowder, but their clam chowder was a bit too watery for my liking. Not creamy and chunky enough. :(But I'm pretty sure that the lobster roll was and still is the best lobster roll the 7 of us has ever had. We were all still talking about it weeks later.

Their grilled cheese appetizer was phenomenal and enough food for a meal in and of itself. It also came out to about $4. So, for $7, I could have a fantastic dinner with a fantastic drink. That alone is worth 4 stars. I had the panko crusted chicken & my wife had their hamburger, both of which were excellent. Portions were ample, bordering on ridiculous. Prices were fair, particularly considering said ridiculous portions and the general quality of the meal. Service was fine, whatever, I was too distracted by the mountain of french fries to take much of an impression. I'll be back.Shame on those of you who gave this restaurant a lesser rating!

So I order the veggie burrito, with the usual complaint (see bad point #2) but half way through this bad boy, hmmmmm, that tastes just like a piece of chicken... Yep. Somehow they managed to get a piece of chicken in my veggie burrito. Now I'm not super pissed about this, but if I was a vegetarian or vegan, I'd be FURIOUS! Its all about quality control and these guys get a big fat D- on it, bringing me to my next point...FIGURE OUT YOUR DAMN RICE SITUATION! I swear every time I eat here, there is HARD semi-cooked rice in my burrito. WTF? It hurts my teeth, and tarnishes my eating experience. Some times its better than others, but its there, consistently.Now the GOOD...Burrito construction is top notch. B+ They manage to get cheese and guac and all the good stuff in every bite. Its also a decent sized burrito which is nice. Not the biggest, but a fair size. (Small burritos piss me off)Taste is good. B- Flavorful, a little on the dry side, but good enough. The veggies are cooked well, not too mushy, but not raw either. I like that they put some crisp lettuce in the burrito to give a bit of a nice crispy texture too. They also do this in their meat burritos.The NEUTRAL.Cost/Value $7.35 for a veggie burrito ain't cheap. but its not the biggest rip off either. Not a deal breaker, and if indeed they are using some sort of local organic produce, the cost is justified. If they are just going to some low quality store like Safeway or something, it should be cheaper.All in all Aprisa is decent. Not worth going out of your way, but if you are in the area, and want something to eat (and something thats much CLEANER than the constantly DIRTY Robo Taco & the WAY over-rated Los Gorditos) This might be your place."},{"name":"La Casita","address":"1355 Bethel Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"My husband and I love La Casita!

I know you're used to getting disrespected by those horrible know-it-all New Yorkers but here comes some real feedback.  I've been to Biba, and Lockes when Lydia was in charge.  I've had high regard for her cuisine, but with Scampo, I think she has sullied her great reputation.  This is a second rate sellout/ let's just make money on my name restaurant.  Like Bobby Flay?  Mario Batali?   Here's why.Service.  Earnest, nice, but not real professional.  Attitude is prized over efficiency or knowledge here apparently.  I'm not saying our server was bad, she was wonderful and nice and friendly, but not trained to be knowledgeable.  We ordered two bottles of the same wine, and only one was poured for tasting.  I had to grab the second one, drain a glass, and taste it.  Same with the third.Food. \\nScampo is proud of their breads.  Our table of eight ordered three of them.  First, the ciccio, which was reasonably tasty because of the cheese filling and truffle oil but gummy and stick to your mouth.  Basically mediocre. Not cuisine, not even comfort food decently prepared.Second, the crispy pizza-like toppings on naan.  Fusion cuisine?  No, just a typical Italian tomato and cheese and herb deal on a naan.  No real attempt to create something interesting, just a mishmash.  But it was ok.  And that's the main reason this restaurant works.  Stuff here is \\"ok\\".Third, another crispy \\"bread\\" with a topping of prosciutto, arugula, balsamic, and a hint of anchovy.  This restaurant may be trying to do interesting things but in this case the combinations do not work at all.  The anchovy with prosciutto and balsamic, they just clashed.  It's almost as if the Olive Garden Creative Directors work here and decided to come up with a few random Italian ingredients to throw together.  Yay!!On to the salad.  I ordered the arugula salad.  Unfortunately the bitterness of the arugula was heightened like a skyscraper by the bitterness of the endive on the plate.  Again, the Olive Garden people said, \\"hey let's do bitter with more bitter, cool!\\"  Let's also dress it with so much salad dressing that our customers will actually eat a salad.  Aarrrggghhhh.On to the \\"special.\\"  The Bronzino with soft shell crabs.  Yay!  In season!  Now I've had soft shell crabs a LOT, being from Philly, a hop skip and a jump from the Chesapeake  (and I'm also formerly from Boston) and i gotta tell ya, these were young and tender and decently cooked.  But they weren't seasoned!!!  Blander than i have ever had!  No spice, no salt, no acid to make them interesting.  The Bronzino was cooked ok, maybe a tiny bit dry, and again, where was the citrus, the acid, the herbs, the anything?  Accompanied by an avocado pur√©e which had no seasoning and an eggplant pur√©e which had no seasoning, and you get the idea.  Mush.  No varying texture or flavor.  Colors were unappetizing.  Remember, eggplant and avocado are mild.  And mushy.  So was the fish. And the crab.   FAIL.  Baby food.Checked with a couple of my dinner mates.  Two folks that love Italian food.  Scampo has a lot of Italian-inspired stuff on the menu.  He said his pasta was overcooked, and his carbonara was tasteless.  She had the steak.  Decently cooked, but the dish was plain.This is the Margaritaville of Lydia Shire and Boston should be embarassed and Lydia should rethink this whole sorry affair.  Even the martini glasses are stupid looking.  Gah.But hey, there's nothing \\"wrong\\" with it.  Because a mediocre, happy place is usually cool.

They gave a pretty big portion of the salad but it dry and not saucy enough - I like it saucy. haha. The chicken udon was quite delicious. The broth was rich in flavourful (wasn't very salty either), the chicken was soft although there wasn't much given, but it was enough for me.

Whenever I am at a new pho spot, I always sip a few spoon fulls of the broth before adding in any condiments and it literally just tasted like watered down beef broth with like a hint of herby-spice aroma.

Sure enough, the very polite hostess said it would be a while, but took our cell number so she could call us when there was a table. Perfect! After not too long we got a call and rushed back. We were seated at the Chef's Table, which I was pretty stoked on - I love watching food being prepared, and the guys cooking seemed to be having a ball while also moving faster than I could see!Our server was unfortunately a bit odd... I really do get it, when you're saying the same thing 50 times a day it gets pretty tiring, but I'm all about authenticity, and that wasn't it. I don't quite know how to explain it, but our service throughout felt stilted, and as though our presence were something of an inconvenience.There weren't a ton of veggie and GF options for Bestie which was unfortunate, and definitely made it hard to share anything. We both got the Potatoes Bravas (hers veggie - watch out, they're made with lard!) and I also got the fried egg and bacon biscuit. Bestie asked for a side of mayo with hers (because yum!) and our server said \\"well we don't allow substitutions, or add anything to our dishes, but I can bring you a side order\\" - isn't that the same thing? Maybe I'm confused. The potatoes came out pretty quickly, which was good, and we definitely enjoyed them. My sandwich took a very long time, however; our server did eventually notice that I hadn't received it yet and went to check - it arrived shortly after. The sandwich was great, the bacon delicious, but by the time it came I'd already gorged myself on potatoes and was about ready to burst!The food was really great, but something about the experience just left me a bit cold.

Comes with fries * 9.49Cooking Style/Temp: medium, griddledAdditions/Subtractions: swapped cheddar for bleu cheese dressingBurger: 2.75\\nHuge burger, with a super fine grind. fresh and hand-formed patty. the meat was really salty, i could still taste the salt 20 minutes later. I ordered it medium but should've gotten medium rare as it was pretty dry inside.Bun: 4\\nReally nice sesame seed white bun, lightly toasted. had good texture and held up pretty well until the end. not too many buns would hang with a burger that big.Toppings: 3.5\\nThe bacon was exceptional, crunchy-chewy and it probably amplified the saltiness of the burger. the lettuce tomato and pickles were all fresh, crisp and very good. for some reason though, i really couldnt taste the bbq sauce or the blue cheese. i missed the tang of the sauce and the funk of the bleu cheese. i the creaminess of the dressing was there, but it lacked that flavor punch that i love of that combo. Accoutrements: 4\\nThe Fries were fantastic. Great outer crunch and fluffy inner texture. Also, definitely try the deep fried pretzel bites. they were super good. small but good draft beer selection. Had a magic hat #9 and a great lakes elliot ness. Atmosphere: 3\\nGoing at lunch on a Thursday seemed like a decent time to go, and it wasn't super crowded, but we were still left with an hour wait. A few people even gave up and left. The surrounding neighborhood reminded me of the east side of Newport, and parking can be tricky. I cant imagine what this place is like on a busy night. The bar/dining area is small, cozy and dark, with lots of epherma collected from over the years. My favorite piece was a sticker that says \\"No Lot Lizards\\" If you dont know what a lot lizard is, look it up. Service was pretty good, but they were a little over the top with the Beer/ID thing. I need 2 IDs to get 2 beers? What if i feel like double fisting?Overall: 3.45\\nAt first I was pretty disappointed by the whole experience, but upon further reflection, The Thurman Cafe was pretty good. I wasn't a life altering event, but a solid, above average neighborhood burger joint. I wasn't super hungry, and we were leaving town right after eating so the long wait coupled with the dread of a 2 hour drive with a giant burger resting in my stomach left me less than enthusiastic. This is definitely the place to come when you want a giant burger, and they have lots of enticing options.

This chipotle is always, I mean always busy.  The bad times started about a month ago. Waiting in line with 5 people ahead of us, and it took 20 minutes to get a burrito bowl, come on! You're not even having to roll the damn thing, it's scooped into a bowl!!! So I sent a friendly email to corporate, saying jeez tiny portions, long wait and no one there seemed to care.\\nI got a gift card for a free burrito, ohhhh boy! I go back to redeem that free burrito, and much to my amazement, the line is up to the door and doubled back onto itself. Jeez, maybe you should have more than 2 people working at 6 pm at night?!?!? So 25 minutes later and a few PhDs of the line, a new not so friendly email to the corporate office and I've decided that I am done with chipotle for a while.\\nLie and behold a coupon for buy one get one free shows up, bring the thrifty people we are, we head back. Make a plan, go right after work, 5:15- can't be too many people there then right? Wrong! That same scenario where the line is doubled back onto itself. So we walk in at 5:30, the wait is no lie,30 minutes!!!! How does that happen when everything is made ahead and in a steam table? So after 20 minute we get close to the spot to order and what do we see? 6 people and 2 managers setting up a training demo, 2 people working the line and a cashier.... So you guys decide that yes, let's train 6 new employees at 5:30 at night, and take up 2 managers time. So thus chipotle is known for the small portions and un-fair treatment of what you get size wise. I get up to the line, eager, it's lime a hot restaurant that you've been wanting to eat at, and the guy scoops a legit 1/2 cup of rice in the bowl.... Come on dude! You can raise your prices and then skimp out on servings, especially since it's only thus one chipotle! \\nFinally go to cash out and I asked, why have 6 trainees and 2 managers doing nothing? I get the coined BS answer of how they're so busy and they are hiring more blah blah blah.... I'm sure if Steve Ells were to walk through the door, those managers would've tabled the training until, say there wasn't a 30 minute wait for a damn burrito with pre-made ingredients. I think it'd be worth the drive to downtown, pay to park and get better service at the other chipotle! Here's a thought, maybe open another store, close by. There like 4 Starbucks in a 4 blink radius,they know people will go, take a hint from another millennial fav Chipotle and open a new store!"},{"name":"Lebowski's Grill","address":"8909 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I got a chili burger with american cheese and seasoned french fries.

After much internet research, we settled on Little Bird Bistro, because of Gabriel Rucker's reputation and the fact it had a late night menu.The staff seemed a little aloof, but they were friendly. We ordered an assortment of dishes (when we go to restaurants like this, we order what we think \\"looks good\\", which usually results in a ton of food), and I asked the waitress to send it out however she thought fit. She did, and we both appreciated the pacing of the meal.Our food, in order of how it came out: pumpkin soup and butter lettuce salad, charcuterie plate, le pigeon burger and goat cheese gnocchi. The food was excellent, but the highlights were the pumpkin soup (it was a seasonal special, but to die for, and if it is available when you go, definitely get a cup) and the goat cheese gnocchi. The gnocchi were bigger than I am used to and shaped a little differently (more like tubes), but so delicious. The charcuterie plate had some highs (chicken liver mousse) and lows (the terrine), and the salad and burger were both well made, but not everything is going to be a stand out winner. I thought the price was good too -- compared to what we have spent at comparable restaurants in other cities, this was on the more reasonable side."},{"name":"Il Mulino New York Lounge","address":"1200 Epcot Resorts Blvd","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"3.5","text":"Was staying at the Dolphin last week for a conference, so had the opportunity to try a few of the options at the Dolphin/Swan resort.  Underwhelming across the board is an understatement.  For the prices that you pay the food is not good.  Trattoria II Mulino is beautifully decorated, very modern and clean.  We had the meatballs and calamari for appetizers.  Dry, overcooked meatballs - needed way more sauce and still might have been dry and the fried calamari was no different than you can get at a bar appetizer that came in frozen, went into the fryer, certainly nothing special.  I ordered the Carbonara.  $22 for basically buttered noodles.  A couple of slivers of pancetta on the top (not enough to flavor anything - to small to even taste) were limp and unimpressive.   The pasta was cold and wasn't even salted.  I was expecting a rich, garlicky, creamy, eggy, cheesy dish and got under seasoned, cold noodles in a puddle of grease.  Can't even call it a sauce in good conscience.  It was a business dinner, so I ate it and didn't complain, but had I not been with a client it would have gone back to the kitchen.  One in our party got the chicken parmesean - he said that he'd had better at Olive Garden.  Olive garden, should never win an Italian food battle.  My client got the ribeye - definitely the best dish at the table, cooked and seasoned well.  Honestly the only thing that saved them from a one star review.  But it isn't an Italian dish - a steak shouldn't be the best thing about dinner at an Italian restaurant."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Heads up: although the actual bowl of pho is smaller than usual (comparing size S between this place and others) they give you SO much meat relative to other restaurants.

Nestled aside a corporate park right off the Cornell exit on US-26, Papa's is a family restaurant through and through.  It's the place to be for kid-friendly dining, without your children contracting the some weird variant of the hanta virus, an all too typical aftermath of an evening at Chuck E Cheese's.The most noticeable thing about Papa's is the gigantic enclosed playroom in the center, filled with tunnels, slides, climbing, ball pits, and even a miniature merry go-round and Ferris wheel.  It's built for kids 8-10 and under, so video games are nonexistent, unless you count the solitary crane game and \\"lucky chicken\\" toy-in-a-plastic-egg machine.A bonus for parents, other than being able to watch your kids play through the Plexiglas windows, is the small but nice variety of local brews on tap.  After all, what would any respectable Oregon pizzeria be without that?Now the down side, and unfortunately it's a big one.  I suppose you could blame it on the healthy amount of competition from the quality pizzerias here and around Stumptown, but the chow at Papa's falls short -- way short actually.  The pizza (crust and sauce specifically) is bland and uninspired, and I've quite frankly made better sandwiches in my kitchen after an all-night Ouzo bender.

I am not generally a fan of mole but since they were voted to have the best one in Austin I snuck a couple of taste from their plates and was very impressed and almost jealous that I did not order it.

Unfortunately the meat was just poor quality,  tough,   chewy and dry.  At most churrascarias, they ask how done you like your meat,  here they don't ask,  but i think it is because they aren't cooked to a specific doneness.  I admit i didn't try the salad bar because i typically stick with just the meat,  some of the dishes did look really good,  so i should have tried them. \\nThey didn't have the cheese bread most places have,  which is also a negative,  also no grilled pineapple.

It's the kind of location you'd more likely expect to find an accountant's office, or a law firm.The interior is a little worn; I'm assuming it's inherited from whatever restaurant/bar occupied the space before the Hungry Soul Cafe did.  Which isn't a bad thing; between the decor, and the cheery welcoming demeanor of all the waitstaff, I had the overall impression of eating at a friend's grandmother's house.Which brings me to the food.  Hungry Soul Cafe offers a full menu, but I went there for their daily specials.  On any given day they have at least two entrees, which reflect the cooking heritages of the husband and wife proprietors; respectively, traditional Hungarian cooking, and soul food.I confess that the day I went I didn't even bother to consider the Hungarian entree; rather, I went with the Southern-fried chicken with mac & cheese and collard greens.  It was a good-sized plate of food, enough for a filling lunch without making me need a nap afterwards - two pieces of fried chicken, and generous helpings of both sides.  The mac & cheese & collard greens were both solid, but it was really the fried chicken that was the star of the show - tender and juicy, with a beautiful flavorful crust.  If I have a complaint, it's that the chicken was white meat (I prefer dark) and deboned, but they're serving the downtown lunch crowd, so I guess you can't make people gnaw on bone-in fried chicken when they're wearing business suits.  Other specials include gumbo, and shrimp & grits, so check out the specials menu on their website to see what's served on which day.

Writing on the truck said something that resembles \\"Portuguese\\". The menu mentioned a Portuguese sausage and chicken in piri piri sauce tacos. The rest of the menu read like a five star restaurant at a destination far and away, yet exotic. Where am I?The lively and smiling lady in front of the truck was kind enough to answer some heat questions and we placed an order. Anything to drink? Why of course, what's there? Oh the usual Coke and Guarana, a Brazilian soda which tastes citrusy and cools the palate. Bring on the Guarana.Stepping aside so others can order we were assured that our order would be right up. Service? Yes, we were also offered to check out the bottled Piri Piri Sauce for sale. Oh yes, the chef makes and bottles his own sauce. After tasting the sauce I challenge anyone who swears by Tobasco and Siracha to give this a tingle. What kind of operation was this?Walaaa, few minutes later, our names were being called, not that she needed to, because the lovely lady knew who ordered what. She was already walking over to us, with handfuls of a sight to behold. She even remembered that we should grab our sodas.Portuguese Sausage was spicy, bold, semi hard, and full of flavors. Piri Piri Chicken had a smooth buttery spiciness that hits just at the right level. The flavors and textures of these simple dishes packed an amazing bundle of joy to my heart. Tacos were firm and pliable, held together very well.The blast from piri piri caught my attention. I tasted these flavors before. But where? The Chef's name on the truck was stinging my eyes. No shame in my game. I Googled him. Oh yea, I did taste Chef Chico's fine food before, at Cocina 214. This just goes to show when one door closes another opens.Lesson for all who dares to try their hand at food truckery:1. Notice the lady at the front of the truck? She takes an order, keeps the waiting guests engaged, and delivers the food. Great Service. Check!2. Notice the food container? A simple open cavity to hold and display food. Can be eaten out of very easily. Can catch falling parts out of mouth. Check!3. Notice the simple items? Straight forward food, big bold flavors, not too much dressing up. Check!Lessons learn? Great food AND service wins hands down every day all day long, in a fine dining establishment or on the streets. Ladies and gents there ends the lesson. It does not get any better than this. Just when I was ready to throw in the towel on food trucks altogether, this fine truck rolls in.

Everything one who appreciates a sushi restaurant that specializes in the belt form of delivery.The price was right on. Yes you have to make sure you're aware there are plenty of colors of plates but everything is in full view so you can tell what you're working with. Sushi trains aren't really a \\"sharing\\" atmosphere, so I'm not sure why people are so pressed about the 3 per plate instead of whatever other number they deem more acceptable. Sushi rolls tend to be made into 6 pieces, so you're essentially getting half a roll in that aspect. It's still a nice deal.It's so well organized. I was excited to see the way the conveyer belt was set up. They actually have cards that will tell you what the roll you're grabbing is. There's much more variety and a bit fresher than most other places that try to pull the train off. It's nice not to be stuck with just Cali rolls with random amounts of spicy mayo squirted on. We came on a slow day without anyone else around, the service was attentive and swift. They would check on us just enough, we weren't forgotten but weren't being pushed along.

It was a Friday night around 6:30 p.m., and we were sure that there would be a wait to get seated anywhere. We were pleasantly surprised to see an almost empty restaurant. By \\"empty,\\" I mean that there weren't a lot of guests, but TONS of staff members.After 4 different hostesses tried to figure out where we should sit, we sat down and started to look over the menu-- well, we TRIED to look over the menu. The entire thing was in Italian-- not just a few words or phrases, but just about everything was in Italian. The waitress (more on her later) offered to help translate or answer any questions, but Google was way more helpful.As a vegetarian, I was appalled at the lack of meatless options. Almost everything is covered in pork or beef. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Pizza not because I actually wanted it, but because it was one of the only options that wasn't laced with sausage. Oh, and don't even think about asking for a meatless version of any of the entrees - at the top of the menu, there's a strict note about Nino's policy to \\"decline all substitutions.\\"Our waitress was... odd. She spoke in a high-pitched baby voice that was a bit condescending. She must have stopped by our table at least 5 or 6 times in a 20-minute span to check on us. While I appreciate the effort, my boyfriend and I wanted nothing more than to enjoy our meal without being interrupted every 3 minutes.This also goes for the busboys/busgirls. Every time we took ONE sip from our water glasses, they were immediately topped off. That sounds great at first, but after 10 non-necessary refills, we had to hold back the urge to say, \\"we're fine, seriously.\\"All in all, the food was delicious. The choices were limited and confusing, but the end result was tasty. To avoid having your dinner ruined by the bored, tip-hungry,  and overbooked staff, I recommend ordering take-out.

The food is divided up into hot entrees, some cold salad-type dishes, sushi, and desert (fruit, ice cream, chocolate fountain).  They have a pretty good variety of different dishes that they rotate in--particularly hot entrees--so if you come back on another day, chances are pretty good there will be different things to try compared to the last time you came.The food is good, although not spectacular.  There are many varieties of sushi, but it's dominated by rolls, and it feels a little bit like how Taco Bell makes many different foods by combining similar ingredients in different ways.  For example, there are often lots of variations of a shrimp tempura roll.  It's tasty though, and they rarely run low, so you can be satisfied.  I like their hot entrees quite a bit, and there's often a nice steamed/fried fish dish and a bunch of tasty cooked meat dishes.  Though it's a \\"Japanese\\" restaurant, it's run by Chinese people, so the flavors will skew towards that.  Service is generally attentive enough to keep your table clear of used plates.I usually go for lunch, which I think offers a much better value than the dinner prices, since it's ok by me to not have things like crab legs.  The decor is pretty nice for a place like this, and there's plenty of tables, so I've never needed to wait for a seat."},{"name":"Imperial Fez","address":"2285 Peahtree Rd NE, Ste 102","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Good food,  great atmosphere, and unique experience.

We tried all the apps and everything was delicious. Beer list is huge and extensive! \\nThe reason I deducted a star is the bar lost my credit card. We were asked to give our cards in advance so we could have separate checks (bonus), however when we went to cash out, mine was missing. I understand things happen, however I don't totally agree with how the manager handled it. Instead of offering to wipe my tab b/c of the inconvenience they have now caused me, he mentioned if they found it they would run the card for the amount of my tab with no tip included. (gee, thanks). Mind you, we had spent hundreds of dollars total and my portion was under $40. Also, had he offered to do that, I would have paid cash right then. Instead, as any responsible credit card holder would, I cancelled the card and ordered a replacement. I'm sure the card will be found, but I don't want to find out too late someone picked it up and decided to ring up a huge bill down the street. When I mentioned to the manager I was planning to cancel the card immediately and no, you would not be able to run it later if you find it, he tried to talk me out of it, saying it most likely was behind the bar or stuck in the waitress' apron. I can appreciate you don't want to hand out freebies, however it was your mistake and sometimes you just have to suck it up for the customer. Unfortunately this is not the first time this has happened to me, however in the other instance, they immediately offered to not charge us our bill (over $100) and apologized profusely. It's the small things that will keep me coming back.\\nOverall a great experience and I will most likely return in the future for the beer and food, but I will not be offering up my card to hold our tab!"},{"name":"Aprisa Mexican Cuisine","address":"2311 SE 8th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"In general, before ordering/going to restaurants, I do a fair share of research.

The taste is good and its unlike anything I've ever tasted but I don't know if that's a good thing because I won't be back here. I can see why people like this place especially if your vegan. But if your someone who goes to farms to eat fresh ice cream I think you will be disappointed unless you come here expecting to try something you have never tasted before. Now, I've had the vanilla and couldn't finish it in a bad way. Yesterday I tried the lavender and loaded cookie one. The lavender taste was there but wayyy too sweet for me. The cookie one tasted great until the ice cream melts in your mouth and it feels like dipping cookies in coconut flavored water instead of milk. I walked out getting neither. I never do that, I'm not the type of person to try stuff without actually getting it, until now I suppose.

Disappointed to say bad service failed to live up to the standard of the food here. We were expecting the long wait to be seated but were not expecting the long wait for our orders. Came to enjoy a late brunch. The brunch crowd was starting to thin as we were seated. We ordered drinks, 2 small apps, and 2 large plates. 20 minutes go by... our drink orders failed to show up. We hunt down a waitress (could not find our waiter) to ask for our drinks. Another 15-20 minutes of waiting... our first small plate arrives (half a small apple). Tasty. Another 15-20 minutes of waiting... our 2nd plate arrives (1 piece french toast) - enjoyed it. Looking forward to something more substantial.More waiting... about 45 minutes... still missing 2 large plates... getting hungry... look around aimlessly wait staff ignore us.Spot our original waiter who comes over with our bill asks if we're ready to pay. Tell him we haven't received our 2 large plates - point out the bill lists our missing orders. Waiter says he thought all plates came out (he did not check on us this entire time... only took our order and brought bill). Apologizes and offers to write off our drinks.We want to leave... ask to pay for food we received. Waiter brings bill - proceeds to chat with coworkers in front of us. We try to catch his attention but he fails to pick up our tab. Restaurant is sparse - so he doesn't seem busy with service.We're now at 2 hours total for drinks, half an apple, and 1 piece of french toast... Walked over our bill to a nearby waitress, she runs it at cash register right next to our original waiter. Original waiter continues to ignore us and keep chatting with coworker in front of us. Does not acknowledge as we walk out.Tasty food.... but the horrible service has turned us away from returning here. Went to nearby food trucks for a full meal after.

From the decor to the food, this place brings a piece of New Orleans to central Florida and I mean that literally! The place is decorated with pieces of mardi gras floats and jazz concert art and post Katrina doors. I couldn't be more thankful for its existence since it's the first place I've been able to go that curbs my craving without having to drive 10 hours to New Orleans to get the authentic stuff. And trust me, we've done it! I'll just list my favorite dishes, but feel free to explore the menu, I've rarely been disappointed. Apps: fried green tomatoes, fried cheese plank, seafood gumbo, chicken and andouille sausage gumbo... it's all tasty and well made. My favorite has to be the barbeque shrimp! It's so flavorful, spicy, juicy, and the perfect complement to an ice cold beer. It brings me back to the big easy instantly! It's served with a loaf of French bread and who doesn't love cleaning up a bowl of deliciousness with bread? As for my favorite entree, it has to be the shrimp and grits. It's amazing! The grits are cheesy and creamy, the sauteed onions are flavorful, the shrimp is perfectly cooked every time, and the red wine sauce is savory and rich. Yummm!I've tried the eggplant tchoupitoulas, which reminds me of eggplant parm with a spicier sauce and while its good, its not especially memorable. I prefer the eggplant parm po boy if you are vegetarian or in the mood for eggplant. I love the shrimp √©touff√©e but my boyfriend always finds it too fishy so I avoid ordering it because we usually share meals. He would also give Tibby's 5 solid starts and would say his favorites are the chicken pontchartrain, cajun shrimp pasta, and shrimp and grits, of course! I think what sets this restaurant on par with some of the higher end restaurants on Park Ave and as one of my favorites is that Tibby's is so consistently solid. It's like they have robots working in the kitchen! I don't know how they do it because every piece of shrimp is always perfectly cooked, never slightly over or under done, and always juicy and fresh! The seasoning always brings me back to New Orleans!There are a few cons, but I'm not going to dock any stars for them because they don't prevent me from loving my experience. First, I can't help but order one of those giant frosty beer chalices filled with Abita purple haze draft. However, I feel they don't clean the pipes often because there is always this weird, slightly old and grimy taste to it that isn't inherent to the beer. By the time I finish guzzling down the chalice, this doesn't bother me as much, but I hope it gets better in the future. I have to remember to stick with bottle beers but those chalices are just so fun. My second con is that I don't enjoy any of the sides. I never find the fries cooked well and I've had much better jambalaya. I'm not sure why the sides never live up to the apps or entrees, but at this point, I just avoid ordering them. If I order a po boy, I just opt to get the full versus the half with a side. As for dessert, you have to get the beignets! I just visited cafe du monde three weeks ago, and I actually prefer the ones at Tibby's. The are lighter, smaller size bites and how can you possibly go wrong with fried dough covered in powdered sugar?!The bread pudding is also delicious, but pretty heavy, so I would stick with beignets unless you've saved a lot of room for dessert."},{"name":"Kokoro Ramen","address":"5695 Victoria Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This place has been anywhere between a 2 to a 4, so I'll have to settle for a 3...  The first time I came here the ramen was great; the noodles were cooked well and the service friendly. the second time however, the chashu meat was about 2 millimeters thick, with 2 of these twoonie sized morsels. This is completely different from what is displayed on their window. It's the incredible shrinking meat. Also, the ramen was stuck in a clump at the bottom of the bowl... and this is a ramen place!?! The soup is good though, and the lady there is nice. But I wouldn't go there again after being ripped off in that way. Seriously, the 2 slices of chashu in ramen is only about 25 cents if you buy it from a store, so they are saving what- 15 cents on a $15 dish? So over that 1% saving out of cheapness they alienate a returning customer. Cheap cheap cheap."},{"name":"Baba's","address":"2515 Summit St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Really good breakfast sandwiches! Have an option for vegetarians.

I appreciated that. The vibe was classy, warm, and food-forward, as their open kitchen greets you with perfect Italian scents and sounds. Excellent start!Thereafter we were shown to a table while we had to wait longer than desired to order our drinks. It happened to be happy hour. Excellent! They have a great one! My Limoncello Peach Mojito was almost too good. I may have had to order a second just to make sure I really enjoyed it ;). Our first server got sent home, didn't say goodbye, but then we were completely taken care of by Jamie. She was a complete sweet heart; a star server imho. Unlike many servers, I could tell she wanted to make a quality impression and genuinely WANTED us to have a great experience.The Brussel sprouts were lacking in flavour which was a first, as I've had them many times and have always been overly impressed with their delicious lemon, parmesan features. Jamie ended up taking them off the bill which was very kind and unexpected. Points to them for going above and beyond. My spaghetti and meat sauce was nothing special, as the robust smells did not match the boring flavours. Although the noodles were cooked al dente, the chef could easily have more fun with this recipe. From what I know, however, many people love this style of Italian food with subtle, easy flavours. Each to their own.Our food adventure here was short lived, as we mainly came to indulge in their delicious beverages.

Alas I am older now and was hoping to see more in the way of art.  The collection is pretty pathetic for such an arty city, but it is displayed in an accessible way and since it was a Sunday, didn't cost me anything to see.  Each gallery on the second floor has a theme - \\"Love and War\\" \\"City Life\\" \\"Monet and Friends\\" etc. - which works well in displaying their tiny collection in a larger context.  It's a well-executed art sampler.

The four large projector screens on the walls show a bazillion different images coming at you from all angles. There's even a creepy animated music video that's played every five minutes. Probably most disturbing is the weird image of Stonehenge being ripped apart and put back together over and over again at 500 miles per hour.But I digress. In terms of overall space, Mantra is amazing. The bar is huge and the dance floor can more than accommodate a large crowd. This is one club where it's actually possible to get through the night without having someones 3-inch stiletto heel driven through your foot. It's also relatively easy to get a drink at the bar. There's no need to throw elbows to get close enough to get the bartenders attention. Because we were attending a private Birthday Party, we also got to use this large \\"hookah hut\\" near the back. It was made from intertwining wood beams that curved all the way to the ceiling and had wraparound seating on the inside. It was a nice private area that has probably seen some scandalous acts. If those cushions could talk, they'd say \\"burn me\\". Unfortunately, Mantra goes downhill from there. The fact that they charge $20.00 cover should be considered an act of rape. I know plenty of clubs charge that amount, but once you get in, you're obviously going to have yourself some booze. And what does that amount to? A $15.00 Gin and Tonic in a plastic dixie cup!!! Fenway Park beer prices just got a little bit better.Of course the only thing that could have saved this place was having a good DJ. Unfortunately they forgot to hire one. It was easily the worst techno/trance I've ever heard. Apparently I wasn't the only one that thought so. Up until about 12:30 am, there was literally no one dancing. Everyone was just standing around trying to look cool. The douche factor was at an all-time high and rising.

The pizza here is traditional Midwest style. Thin crispy crust cut in to squares.  I am normally a fan of lots of cheese but Cardos doesn't use a whole lot, but it works the Pep is decently spicy, and the sauce is sweet with just the right amount. Only real complaint is if you order anything with more then one toppings the toppings are on top of the cheese, and they slide around a bit if you aren't careful. That being said they do really throw on the toppings which is nice. The veggies some of them anyway, like the green peppers taste fresh and have a nice crisp snap to them.They don't have a huge dining room, but they do have a good selection of soda available for cheap for take out.

Really delicious gravy! Fairly priced too."},{"name":"West End Grill","address":"63 Mazzeo Dr","city":"Randolph","stars":"4","text":"Ok so this is a difficult one to write, the only way I can do this is by writing the pros and cons:Pros - they have a few items that are on the menu that are pure bliss. The short ribs, bolognese rigatoni, Tuscan eggplant salad & the clam chowder are simply the best thing ever!!!! They know these recipes and each time I have had them it has been spectacular! The wait staff is really nice and friendly, and one manager is super sweet as well. If I was craving the above I would definitely order to go, because it is worth it.Cons - now for the bad, and why as a whole I will never be going back again. So those dishes that I described as other worldly, well that's it. They change their menu so much it is ridiculous, and evident in the cooking technique with their food. Instead of beautiful grill marks and a nice grill flavor, you get chard food that has parts that are way under cooked, or way over cooked. They don't know how to grill shrimp. I ordered some tonight and the way it was cooked makes it seem like the \\"chef\\" has no clue as what they are doing. Half of the shrimp appeared raw and hardly looked like it touched the grill, and the other half looked like they landed in charcoal and were so over cooked it was like chewing on rubber. I had said something to a manager and her response was tiger prawns all cook differently and that's just how it is. I'm sorry but I cook tiger prawns often, and that is wrong; secondly the half that looked like charcoal were obviously cooked improperly which leads me to believe someone didn't go to culinary school. So with the changing of their menu, which seems like every other month, along with their specials twice daily; they have no clue how to cook the food. The other issue is how long you wait once your seated to get service. This has been an issue ever since I had started going to this place trying to give it another chance; but alas they just don't know how to manage their wait staff. Apparently, their staff memorizes your order, which gets screwed up often; and what happened to me tonight. Word of advice, your not a high end restaurant, have your servers write their orders down! After the mishap with a salad, it took them 45 minutes to get my order to me, meanwhile my partner had completed his meal and was ready to go. Furthermore, I order another ice tea, 15 minutes later I assume the waitress remembered my order and brought it to me. Fast forward to the bill and I look down and nothing was comped and or a partial discount for their screw up.  Every Time I have come here there has always been an issue. I kept giving them chances because of the few items on their menu that are amazing; but after trying something new I realized they are not that great. This review is directed toward management and to the \\"chefs\\" at this establishment. The wait staff can only do so much and what is requested of them by management. One of the first things about a restaurant is you need to make sure you have a solid menu and that you know how to cook and prepare food/ingredients. The other thing is making sure the demands you place on your waitstaff are attainable; and stop changing your menu all the time!!!!! You are not Gordon Ramsey or an Iron Chef.....this place has potential, but needs A LOT of help...."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Our favorite brunch place ever.

My sister said I had to have a Lobster roll while I was in town and this was THE place to get one. I was a bit deterred by the $25 price tag on a sandwich, but decided it was worth a try since I was visiting. In hindsight, I am so glad I made that decision.Luckily, we had arrived at an opportune time and the wait was a little over 10 minutes. In the meantime, I was treated to watching the workers shuck oysters through the window. The interior of the restaurant is humble in size, but what they lack in square footage is made up for in qualify seafood.We ordered some oysters from the raw bar as starters while we waited for our lobster roll and yellowfin tuna. Unfortunately, razor clams were not being served that day, so we decided on a mix of west and east coast oysters. Flavorsome oysters with a taste like they had just been plucked from the ocean. Very briny with a hint of sweetness when biting in.Then the moment of truth arrived: My lobster roll arrived. I ordered it hot with butter and, to my extreme delight, they chef had drenched my lobster roll with it. It was just like a french dipped sandwich. I dove in and was overcome with flavors. The rich butter and the delicate lobster meat coming together on a roll meant to vessel this combination directly to my taste buds. I can now define my life to before and after having this lobster roll. If there it only one thing you could do while visiting Boston, this had better be it!Overall, it was an impressive experience. Come early or be prepared to wait if you come down during busy times. Also be prepared to pay a pretty penny when the bill comes. However, the experience and the high quality seafood is well worth it.

It was actually better than Cracker Barrel's & I was pleasantly surprised!! Plus, get this, it was $7.65 for all that!!! My mom ordered the French toast meal & it was 4 pieces of fluffy challah French toast with 2 eggs & bacon. My mom said it was the best French toast she's had in a very long time anywhere! There are 2 reasons why I can't give this restaurant 5 stars: #1-my breakfast was served 6 minutes before my mom's & I literally asked 2 different servers to check on it. One server went in the back then came out & started counting money rather than making eye contact with me & at least acknowledge it will be right out. Our server walked by & said, \\"Oh, you still don't have your French Toast?\\" as she walked over & took another guest's order. As she walked past again I asked her if she could go check it out. Finally, a minute later she brought it out. My mother said it was worth the wait & it's not then end of the world but I am a firm believer in food being delivered at the same time. I guess since its a small establishment they figure just bring out the good that is ready but I don't really agree. #2-our waitress had sooooo much perfume on that when she walked by I could actually taste it. Literally. I am someone who thinks servers should not have cologne or perfume on but that's neither here nor there, but if you are wearing it...can you not bathe in it please?!

The following review is based entirely upon several cheeses, two tapas, and two desserts. THE PROS:\\nthis avocado and goat cheese tapa that was accompanied with beet and citrus vinaigrette. my friend didn't like it because she felt ripped off paying 8 dollars for half an avocado, and there is definitely some validity to that statement- it wasn't really prepared, it was kind of just assembled. however, the combination of the flavors was absolutely delicious. could i make it at home? probably. would i have thought to do so on my own? no way.\\nwe sat on the patio and it was absolute beautiful out. gorgeous restaurant in general.\\nall the food was obviously very tasty. it's a good restaurant. \\nour server was very nice. i always take note of this, because as 18-20 year olds eating out, it is often not the case.\\ni was happy to find that it didn't feel awkward at all to skip the entree. THE CONS:\\nthe pricing can be argued on some of the dishes, as per the avocado and goat cheese discussion above.\\nthe flan was a little too cinnamon-y.  I still ate it, but my dining partner was not a fan. this was particularly irksome because we asked the server what her favorite dessert was and she pointed us to the flan. afterward, she asked how we were enjoying our desserts and my friend commented that she was enjoying hers, but found my flan had a little too much cinnamon. the server then replied that she felt exactly the same way and found it overpowering. it kind of made me doubt my decision to order off her recommendation.\\nshe also forgot one of our cheeses, and we had to reorder from someone else, meaning it came at the same time as our tapas. considering that we were at a little two-seater on the patio, it was a bit tough to maneuver. I would definitely go back to Barcelona, but it would take a lot more to get me to veer off the tapas menu and pay for real entrees- the tapas were absolutely good enough to get again, but not great enough to convince me that i need to shell out an extra $30 for the full experience. all in all a lovely restaurant."},{"name":"Splash Ultra Lounge & Burger Bar","address":"150 Kneeland St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"What Angie said below is SO TRUE.

Served.Trekking through the rain (and as an LA local, we aren't used to this) we found Tasty n Alder after a 15 minute walk (aka rain run) through the city (while scoping for shelter that could not only warm us up from the weather, but from the inside out). It was our first and last night during our day trip after 3+ hours of driving on a Monday night during the storm, where this spot was looking lively. Our waiting time was told to be 30-40 minutes for the two of us, but we were seated bar-front of the chefs just moments later. Our server, Sarah, was outstanding. Welcoming, throughly knowledgeable with excellent recommendations, she was able to serve us just what we were looking for in the sweetest manner.I ordered the Lamb Chops (2, from Cattail Creek Farm--neat how they label where each list of meat is from) which is presented atop eggplant puree and pistachio, potatoes and flowered with pomegranate seeds. Flavorful and cooked medium rare, with the eggplant puree being a subtle yet creamy dip, did me just right. My girlfriend ordered the Wagyu Skirt Steak (from Snake River Farms) and said it was the best she's ever had. We also shared a side of Duck Duck Potatoes which carried a rich sauce, and topped with an egg, as well as a side of Saigon Brussels Sprouts and oh my gooooodness those were sweet and amazing!

We were here to celebrate our last night out on vacation and were very thankful to be able to experience a moment here to share (and devour). The Chef, Shawn, treated us to a complimentary dish of Iberico Pork Skirt Steak, where he mentioned that the meat was from Fermin, Spain, and only located in two restaurants in the world. Insane and amazing, I've never had anything like it. Gratefulness points, exceeding the limit! After my lamb chops, I was feeling a little meat addicted and joked about how I needed to order more because that dish hit the spot, and the Universe (aka Chef Shawn) answered! (Still salivating, and debating if I should move to Portland.)Let's not forget: dessert. We HAD to order for a full experience after killing it with the first two courses. Third time's the charm, right? We each ordered one Chocolate Potato Doughnut placed on a plate of cr√®me anglaise. I'm not a doughnut person, but let's just say I was ready to order a dozen boxed up for my flight home to LA the next day (if I didn't finish them on my drive back to Seattle, of course). Oh, so tempting.Tasty and Alder, thank you for topping off my Portland experience--enriching my soul from the inside out.

Period. Done. I can stop the review here.

A combination you may not have considered made with quality ingredients and a staff that streams you in and out without consequence. Even at lunch, in the hectic throes of everyone demanding their meal, the staff is kind and treat you like a real person with a smile on their face, even if you're barking orders at them (I don't do this, but I've seen them beaming through some hangry demands).Their Boston Cream Pie is $5, and not a sandwich, but I want to call it out so you can realize that every bite of it makes you appreciate your life. I literally cried eating a piece once, inspiration from tiramisu making it into the desert as well.So go and grab a bite.

We were clearly not wanted there and didn't want to stay. Around 2:09 Dayma returns with our food and we asked her \\"does this restaurant normally shut down the restaurant with guest still inside?\\". She the responds by telling us \\"the restaurant closes at 2 a.m. And out company license does not allow us to stay running past the alloted time\\". We chose not to argue with her, we asked for our check and left. My order was also rang in incorrectly. I ordered a small bone in order of wings with all drums and hot sauce.

I agree that the Specialty Maki was very expensive but that's been my experience in pretty much every sushi place I've ever eaten. I have no doubt they would have been delicious as well but I wasn't really sure if it was worth paying $10 for specialty instead of $5 or $6 for a standard maki.

Out of the three or four times that I've visited Tibby's, only once have the beignets actually been cooked correctly.

Though there's not a kid's menu, they do have tacos a-la-carte, and some of the appetizers aren't too spicy, so kids can handle.  They were fine sitting out on the porch with us for a (relatively) leisurely dinner.  There are plenty of neighborhood folks who bring their kids there, too, so it can't be all bad.

The french dressing was odd, and another sauce/condiment would have made this better.  The bacon was crisp, and surprisingly good quality.For the price (almost $7), this wasn't worth it.  No drink or chips, as that would set me at $10.  Very expensive for what it was.  I was also shocked at how expensive their salads are.  Again, if the food is good, high prices are fair.  But for my little, meciocre wrap, this was not worth it.  I suppose it's one of those places of convenience---literally nothing else within a block for a sandwich, so I guess a lot of people eat here who work right by because it was busy.

We offered 3 times to push over and share our table with another group of customers, but she ignored us and demanded us to order our entrees in a very RUDE manner constantly!

Our server was truly top notch - friendly, helpful, we never had empty water, etc. We will go back based on the service alone. The food was good - I liked the relatively simple menu that focused on small plates, the boils and po boys. Since it was just two of us, we didn't opt for the boil (this time that is... we will likely be back with at least another person or a group and go a little more crazy). We had the coke ribs and garlic noodles to start - and both were quite tasty. I will also add that the portion sizes were generous for the price too. We both love po boys so we opted for two shrimp ones - one with the shoestring fries and the other with the onion rings. It was great. It was a little salt heavy is my only complaint. But the shrimp portion was generous, the bread was amazing and the fries were crispy. So I was a happy camper. The drinks were good too. The cucumber drink was awesome and refreshing on a really hot day and they had a great wine selection as well. We will definitely be back.

Their Kung Pow Calamari is a good example. The tempura-style with a great a lovely presentation is a great start for a group of four or five. The sushi options are also impressive and were worth getting as well. Their green salad has amazing dressing (I actually had it while trying to finish our dessert because I liked it so much!). Their salmon entree was small but quite filling. I was not very impressed with their halibut fish and chips. I felt like the quality was more of Burgerville than anything else (however, Burgerville does make good fish and chips but they are not pretty). The best dessert I had was this upside down apple pie. The view is also a great plus; if you have visitors and want to really impress them and show them Portland from up-in-the-air, get a window seat.

A burger joint that is becoming known as one of the best in the country.The Thurman Cafe is located in the German Village which is a mammoth 233 acre historical community filled with German-inspired merriment. I love everything German and am especially partial to German women but didn't have any luck roping one in while I was in town. Maybe they were turned off by me kicking it in the sex help section of The Book Loft or having a massively sloppy cheeseburger and fries for dinner or maybe I just got no game. Either way I left town empty-handed : /Anyway, Thurman's completely lived up to the hype. I went for the Jack Cheese Burger which was smothered in sauteed onions and jack cheese. All their burgers feature 3/4 pounds of happiness err beef and all their burgers seem to be under $10 which is ridiculously inexpensive considering how money they actually are. There are numerous different burgers to fill your belly with and all of them are as creative as they are tasty. Equally as good are the thick hand cut french fries which were maybe the best I've ever had in my life.The Thurman Cafe is a tiny establishment and the wait can be somewhat long. I went on a Tuesday night and still waited for over 30 minutes. But it's well worth sticking around for.

Truly a promising sign of things to come!  Next came our salads (one butter lettuce, and the other beet) which we complemented (at Tom's suggestion) with the grilled lamb belly appetizer.  Not the first thing you might think of to have with a salad, but the velvety, yet crisp, lamb proved to be just the right counterpoint to both salads (despite their being quite different from one another).  But wait, there's more!Our entrees continued the decadent theme of the meal; portobello mushroom gnocchi and duck confit with orange glaze.  The gnocchi was wonderfully flavorful, light in texture, and browned on all sides, while the duck was thoroughly luxurious (as you might expect from confit) with the most insanely crisp skin I've ever encountered; it practically shattered under the fork!  Amazing...And yes, there was desert too!  We shared the Chocolat-Caramel Croquant Marmelade (another recommendation from Tom).  This thing was just ridiculous...  A layered creation, reminiscent of a Napoleon, this classically presented masterpiece paired a single layer of dense, milk chocolate iced cream with an equally thick one of caramel iced cream.  Atop and beneath were dark chocolate covered cookies that were unbelievably thin and crispy; the contrasting textures were a delight.  Alongside was a drizzle of intensely flavored orange (or perhaps cumquat) marmelade with several very small chunks of fruit.  What seemed at first to be mere garnish, proved to be the most amazing accent note to an already fabulous chorus of flavors; simply brilliant!I honestly cannot say enough good things about this restaurant, their staff, and the astounding menu.  You owe it to yourself to try this place at least once.  I cannot even imagine how the \\"big sister\\" Le Pigeon restaurant could possibly be better..!!"},{"name":"Lincoln Tavern and Restaurant","address":"425 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"In neighborhoods or towns where there isn't much great food, restaurants that are just \\"very good\\" get ratings that are higher than they deserve.  That's the case with Lincoln Tavern. It's probably the best pizza in Southie (actually I don't know for sure), but it's far from the best pizza spot in Boston which has been mentioned online in various websites.  For the best, go to Santarpio's or to Posto for slightly better Neopolitan style than Lincoln Tavern, or even Otto or Upper Crust.  Yes, they did Neopolitan style pretty well, but I've had better in the Boston area and there are several other drawbacks to this place.  Such as...  1) They were clever with the Lincoln Log buckets for kids, but the kid size portions were bigger than one adult could eat, and our usually adventurous kids wouldn't eat it because they use a very pungent cheese (maybe the owner/manager doesn't have any kids and just doesn't get it). 2) It is SO FREAKIN loud in there, even at 5pm.  I think they might want it that way - the drinking area is equal to the table area.  3) The service was nice when we could find our server, but our table sat with dirty plates for a very long time, multiple times, despite all the staff running around, the drinks took forever to arrive, and we had to roam the restaurant to try to find our waitress for anything, we wondered if she was on a break or maybe just lost in the cavernous space. So, not going back to Lincoln since I don't live in Southie, but if you live in Southie and the above doesn't bother you, I'd recommend walking by a lot and see if there's any time of day when it's not really loud."},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Someone recommend this place because it's sort of a staple here in Austin and I was driving through and thought I'd check it out.

We also tried the Neptune burger which included fried oysters. It was delicious but still second tier to the lobster roll. We filled out our meal with the Scallops, Cioppino, and Lobster Spaghettini. The broth in the Cioppino was so so good with the bread they gave out. The Scallops were so tender (but small portion), and the sauce on the Spaghettini was perfect. This place is a must try if in Boston. The staff is really friendly, as they called us 10 min in advance when we were up in line and squeezed us in at the end of the night.

A craft beer aficionado myself, a word to you Bostonians: you've got it GOOD in that realm. Quit yer bitchin'. :)First off, one of my fellow diners hit the nail on the head when he said that you really need to study this beer menu and prepare for the midterm before you arrive. It's *that* big. The menu identifies the brewery, the name, the style of beer, and the location of that brewery (there were even some from Boulder, CO on there). There's not much in the realm of liquor or wine here, but that's not why you go to a place that is clearly a beer lover's paradise, now is it?There's tons of outdoor seating in the form of picnic tables, which are great, and then there's indoor seating like booths and whatnot. Be forewarned, if you sit inside, it's kind of dark. Our server had no problem discussing beer tastes with us and bringing over samples to try. I found a new Pumpkin Ale I like thanks to her. The food though? Oh em gee, amazing! At least the burger that I had was. Incredibly juicy, big, and seasoned really well. I plan on having another when I come back. The fries were also amazing and cooked exactly as I like them.For 4 people who all ordered entrees and a couple beer refills, the final bill of $92ish before tip was not bad at all. Again, this coming from a New Yorker who's used to a much larger bill, but seriously, totally worth the price for what you get! And this is within walking distance of Margot G's apartment. Perfect! And if you think it couldn't get any better, it does! There's a craft beer and wine store right next door, so if you find something you like in American Craft, you can probably find a 4 or 6-pack of it in the store."},{"name":"Halal Bros","address":"2712 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I've loved this place since its food truck days, and watching them open up a restaurant and then expand it even further due to such success makes me so happy! This is one of the only halal chicken over rice joints that actually compares to the New York halal guys on 53rd and 6th, in fact I'm always going back and forth over which one is better, and still can't give you an answer to that with any sort of confidence. Halal bro's has improved dramatically over the years in my opinion, as if that was even possible. I definitely think the basmati rice has become more flavorful, and the meat is now more juicy and tender. The white sauce is on point, and my taste buds are unable to distinguish it from the original white sauce from New York. My only suggestion would be to make the red sauce a bit spicier, because I always find myself craving a little more heat as I think of the New York red sauce which has a major kick. I have tried several variations of the meat over rice here with several different types of protein, but my favorite is the lamb/beef gyro + chicken kebab over rice. I prefer the chicken kebab to the chopped chicken because the marinade makes it so much more flavorful and juicy. Other variations that are also really good include combo over rice, kofta over rice, and shawarma....I guess you really can't go wrong!"},{"name":"Pizza Hut","address":"2021B E Riverside Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"This location and its employees are a joke, I honestly wish I could give a no star review. The only pizza I ordered from Pizza Hut was the cherry bombshell pizza ( which I guess they don't promote anymore). After waiting for 30 minutes for our pizza as we watched 3 different employees sit at a table wile the restaurant wasn't busy (we watched a pizza sit in the hot box for 10 minutes only to realize that it was ours when they eventually called the name out) it was the wrong pizza and had nothing but cherrie peppers on it. We explained that this wasn't what we had ordered and tried to explain the pizza and the ingredients. The lady we spoke to seemed to get the idea. After another 25 minutes roll by we get a new pizza and we find that she had rung up a completely different specialty pizza claiming that they don't serve the cherry bombshell anymore and that this was the closest thing to it. I explained that this was not what I wanted and was nothing like what I explained. I even pointed out that the pizza I wanted was clearly displayed on a poster outside of the store. A couple days later I called the location trying to correct the problem for future customers. I spoke with a manager by the name of nick who had no interest in solving the problem or listening to what I had to say he explained that they don't carry that pizza and my question was: why wasn't I informed and why wasn't I asked what I wanted. The conversation was a very stressful and rude argument and I finally just hung up out of frustration. He told me that if I'm unhappy then they just won't provide me service. I brought up the fact that the yelp reviews weren't so good for this location and was told that he didn't care and it's mostly because people want to complain.

They really know their seafood and spend time answering your questions. Your oysters come out so quickly that you can comfortably order them in multiple courses, giving you the opportunity to try something new and then really pile them on once you know you're a fan, or switch to others if its not your fancy.The interior is a little cramped, but with the friendly atmosphere you really won't notice.

I got the warm lobster roll which costs 27 dollars which was actually really reasonable for a lobster roll, boston chowda does one for 29.99 with no fancy table or waiter. The lobster roll came on a huge hoagie bun, which was completely soggy and hard to eat. As soon as i lifted the roll all the contents of the lobster fell onto the plate because the bread was too soggy and split in half.... it was like that one kitchen nightmares episode with gordon ramsay yelling at the cook for making a giant soggy lobster roll. The taste was decent though, you get a lot of lobster but i didn't really eat the bread. I just used a fork and ate all the lobster since the bread was inedible.

I'm not a fan of the no-substitutions policy in the restaurant business.That having been said they're okay with some deletions, which was important to me as a vegetarian when I wanted the Cheddar Biscuit with Fried Egg, and without the bacon. They were willing to eliminate the bacon (though not give something else in its place), and actually took $2 off the price of the dish because it didn't have bacon, which tempered my dislike of the \\"no substitutions\\" policy a bit. It was a good butter-based biscuit, and hearty, though the biscuit at the next table seemed fluffier than mine. (I get biscuit envy sometimes.)My wife had the Radicchio Salad with Six Minute Eggs, Green Goddess Dressing and a side of Avocado (again with no bacon.) She liked this.We also had a side of maple yams which was two big yams but not so much maple flavor. It was more of a savory dish than I'd hoped for with the word \\"maple\\" in it. (My wife disagreed) but we both thought the cumin flavor overwhelmed the rest of the dish.The service was fast which was great so we could leave and have coffee across the street and move on with our day.There are a lot of other options, suitable for vegetarians, on the menu for brunch which looked appealing. (Chocolate Potato Doughnut with Creme Anglaise, Cast Iron Frittata with smoked cauliflower, cartelized onion and jack cheese are a few standouts) so if we were back in Portland we'd give it another try though this experience didn't leave it standing out above the other places we had brunch in town."},{"name":"Cappy's Tavern","address":"11 Wolcott Ct","city":"Hyde Park","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in for lunch.

And so, the foodie travels continued!The three of us ordered a trio of oyster twins, one of which I've forgotten the name of (it wasn't that delicious, but was okay), the nice Martha's vineyard ones, and the west coast Kumamoto? Something that sounded Japanese, at least. All were nice and fresh, although I personally did not enjoy the west coast ones. We also tried the clam chowder and hamachi, both of which were quite good. The chowder really has real clams in it, and you can even see them, which is refreshing. I loved the sauce the hamachi was in...the flavors melded quite nicely.And, yes, the lobster rolls. We had one cold and one hot. In each the chunks of lobster were so huge and so succulent that I nearly couldn't believe it. Really, really, delicious. Between the hot and the cold, I lean slightly to the hot, as the hot butter all over lobster and soaking into the roll is really delicious, not to say that cold mayo isn't good. It just kind of depends on the mood. The thing is though, they're $25/roll...so...if I were on my own, suddenly craving lobster roll, I'd probably go to Alive and Kicking for something more affordable. The fries with the lobster rolls were almost good too, but really too salty. Really, really salty.

Corvallis and Bend locations. I was just a kid then, so this was my first time where I have a serious opinion on the place. First off if you have kids, then this is an ideal place for you to take them as they have an indoor play area. its separate from the restaurant so even if a group of adults want to come here they won't be bothered by kids - to a point - there will still be kids in the dining area who have a hard time staying in their seats but thats more of a parenting issue then a restaurant issue. Came here with my family. - 5 of us total -  We had a large pepperoni and pineapple pizza. They all had soda, I haven't had a beer in a while so i decided to get one. A widmer - it was pretty good. The pizza was just that - a pizza. nothing special. Little gessy. Had to ask for a water cup just to wash down the grease and dryness.. The pizzas are made to order in an \\"open kitchen\\"  behind the counter.  Prices were somewhat ok. A bit expensive for a \\"all you can eat\\" salad bar - $6.19 or $3.49 for one time only.In all the only time I may be back is if I'm with someone who has kids who invites me along. Other then that I won't be back."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Best lobster roll I've ever had.

The place at first glance was clean and organized.We ordered an appetizer plate and two individual hot pots. Apparently you get complimentary plum juice with each order of hot pot. I know it's complimentary but the plum juice was just plain disgusting. Maybe it was a bad batch but it tasted burnt and bitter and I felt my mouth dry up after my first cautious sip. The food came out fairly quickly but I reckon it's because of the late hour and there were only a few tables occupied. The appetizer plate was good (we got the pork ear). It was mildly spiced and if there was any MSG in it I couldn't detect it. The hot pot portions are rather small (only a few pieces of fatty beef + lamb shoulder, three chicken wings, 4 pieces of sweet potato, three small prawns, a few stalks of enoki mushrooms, 6 pieces of lettuce + cabbage, and two small bowls of white noodles for two orders of hot pot). The broth was nice and savory though.As for the service this place is terrible. The manager on duty was very attentive to the table next to us (they were her friends I suspect, as she was coming and going and making small talk with them as well as EATING AND DRINKING with them standing at their table). The other two servers would ignore us even after I made eye contact with them and raised my hand to get their attention. All in all based on my experience, I would say it is not worth the money. To be fair maybe it was just bad timing but I will definitely not be coming back.

The barbecue is very solid, at times it can be a little dry but for the most part it's good.  I think you need the sauce for it, without it you're going to notice the dryness of the meat more than normal.  But all in all, this is a solid place to eat.

They were still setting up inside, but commonnnnn, can you at least let us in so we could wait indoors??Once they opened, 5 mins AFTER the stated open time (I knowwww, I usually wouldn't mind, but the waiting in the rain sucks), I told the hostess we had reservations and she seated us promptly, right by the window so we could people watch. :) The waitress came by shortly to take our drink order, and when we told her tap water would be fine for now, she gave us a rude \\"OKAY.\\" JT ordered the prix fixe with butter lettuce and crab cakes. It was decent. Nothing to write home about. I ordered soup of the day, which was a duck soup and the roasted bone marrow, served with squid ink flatbread. It was THE MOST SALTY AND OILY bone marrow I've ever had. I ended up only eating barely half of it, because I didn't want to waste it. When the waitress came back to take JT's dessert order, she asked if she could get the macaroons to go since we had a plane to catch. I wanted to order another 2 dozen for the cohorts back at work, and she gave me a weird look like \\"did you really just order 2 dozen more?\\"  and had me repeat myself.

The decor was really cool - tons of chandeliers, deco art, concrete walls, and a hysterical \\"live nudes\\" neon sign directing you to the bathrooms, but they also had large projectors playing music videos that weren't connected to the actual music and were mostly wildly distracting. It was also much more difficult than it should have been to get a waiter's attention, even just to initially order. The food on their menu is excellent, but, again, some kinks to work out. We had the Bootleg Special boil for 4 and the flavors were awesome. The sauce has a spicy kick and MOUNDS of garlic. However, the special had two tiny chunks of corn on the cob and only a few tiny potatoes. We were left with tons of sauce and had to request bread (oh gosh order the bread - it's toasted, yet fluffy and soft) to soak it up. Stuff like having 4 chunks of corn cob in a dish for 4 and just automatically adding in a bit more potato or bringing/offering bread would really make this a 5 Star experience. Especially at the price points. The chocolate hazelnut beignets were ok, but the sauce really just made them soggy.

One a rainy Thursday evening in January, the place was packed with a line of damp hopefuls down the block. Once we made the cut to go inside, it was a pretty chaotic scene, with a line for the pierogi as well as a dance to get through and order at the bar. Despite the difficulties, the staff were smiling and efficient throughout. Beer is the perf pierogi pairing, and we ordered flights to sample various beers with the 5 different pierogi. We even lucked out and got spaces at the front table, which made the experience much more enjoyable (and less messy).My second trip was on a Saturday afternoon. After learning that Lamplighter is BYOF (and there was no food pop-up that day), we decided to get some delish Caribbean food from Izzy's a few blocks away. Walking in with our large paper bags of food, it took some maneuvering in the crowded space, but we eventually landed at the stools around the back table. We ordered drinks: flights, pours (both small and large), cold brew coffees, kombucha. We played board games: Pictionary, Exploding Kittens, Cards Against Humanity. We asked for the free bar snacks (Cheez-its and Smartpop) and poured ourselves water to keep hydrated. We even made some new friends who shared their homemade snacks with us! Saturday afternoon turned into Saturday night, and after nearly 7 hours, we finally arose from our stools.There are very few places where I would want to spend half a day in the same spot. But from snack options to games, Lamplighter makes it easy. Not to mention, the beer is REALLY GOOD. The ones I've enjoyed most are the Prop 4 and Group Theory. They're always adding new brews, so I've found that the flights and small pours are the way to go to get a taste of their variety (and it's pretty dang affordable too)! And when you need to wake up/hydrate/not get too drunk, they offer tasty non-alcoholic options as well.

I have a feeling a lot of people experience this momentary confusion before finding the restaurant, and it is unnecessary and an easy fix. When we finally walked into the restaurant, we were given a buzzer and told that it would be a few minutes. So of course, we wandered over to the bar. The bartender was a super energetic guy. He seemed to be doing a million things at once but that didn't stop him from being charming and eager to please. My fianc√©e ordered a chocolate martini. It was a little on the strong side but otherwise very good and came with a peppermint swizzle stick.I didn't have a drink at the bar so maybe that made the wait seem longer than it was. But it was at least 20 minutes (probably closer to 25) before our buzzer finally went off. It seemed kind of excessive as we had made reservations five months ago. When we sat at our table, things got better fast. Our waiter was a wackadoodle kinda guy who cracked corny jokes throughout the meal. He was cool though and extremely attentive. At one point, he was walking by and saw that our water glasses were empty. I heard him mutter \\"water!\\" and then I watched as he ran away to fetch the pitcher. He brought it to our table promptly and apologized for letting our glasses get so low. We didn't mind at all. He was on top of everything though he appeared to be very busy. I have a feeling the waiters at Narcoossee's work a lot of tables. Their plates, ergo, are full.Speaking of full plates [obvious transition], ours were full of seafood. For an appetizer, I got the crab cakes. They were easily much better than the crab cakes we got a few days earlier at Flying Fish Caf√©. No contest. Narcoosee's crab cakes were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle--delicious all around. They came with a sweet potato salad that was a little too filling for an appetizer, for my tastes, but still very good. The fianc√©e had a porcini mushroom soup that she loved. Her only complaint was that she wished it could have been a little hotter. But she did enjoy it more than the mushroom soup at Artist Point, and that's saying a lot!For dinner, I ordered twin, butter-poached lobster tails. The fianc√©e ordered the Fettuccine Scampi and, as we always do, we planned on splitting both dishes. Our on-top-of-his-game waiter heard us discussing this fact and went ahead and split them for us behind the scenes. What a nice touch! What followed was probably the best and worst of both worlds. The lobster at Narcoossee's is fresh from Maine and it is magnificent. I vacation in Maine each year and I've eaten a good deal of Maine lobster in my time. To anyone who questions whether or not this is truly Maine lobster, I can affirm that it is. It is succulent and delicious! They also crack the tails open for you so you don't have to worry about wearing a silly bib or getting the juices all over your nice evening wear. Just enjoy. A word of warning though--the lobster is mad crazy expensive. You can get lobster way cheaper in Maine. But you're not in Maine are you? You're in Orlando. No worries if you have the Disney Deluxe Dining Plan!As amazing as the lobster was, my fianc√©e's meal, sadly, was a different story. The fettuccine scampi, though split into two bowls for convenience, was no good. The pasta was rubbery, probably overcooked, and had little to no flavor. The shrimp was okay, but again, not much flavor there. There were a few small bits of lobster in it that tasted nowhere near as good as my tails. Neither of us ate very much of her meal as we both devoured the lobster. The lobster was so good, in fact, that we didn't mind (too much) that we were ignoring most of the flavorless fettuccine failure. [Sidenote: I do not condone wasting food.]Usually, a dinner experience this divided would be reason enough to give only three stars. But Narcoossee's is a beautiful restaurant with a happy view of Cinderella's Castle off in the distance, over the water. And the firework presentation is a must-see from either your table or from the dock just outside the restaurant. Oh, and the baked chocolate mousse dessert is an excellent finish."},{"name":"Patrizi's","address":"2307 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm in no position to comment on the authenticity of the food. I am in a position, however, to say that Patrizi's is dishing out some damn fine (dare I say perfect) food: fresh, verdant, not greasy, makes your tongue do the happy dance. A far departure from what you find at a typical Italian joint--Patrizi's is focused on super fresh, super simple, but super flavorful food. If you think you've had pesto, you haven't. Have it here and you'll know what I'm talking about. And get a meatball. You can thank me later. If you think you've had carbonara....you have NOT had carbonara. One a low-carb diet? Screw it. This pasta is the best you'll likely ever taste. And double screw it by getting the crostini (three large pieces of homemade bread with three different toppings). The menu is small...so should you be so lucky as to come with a small group, you should try to get a taste of everything. They now have an expanded seating area that is covered and more comfortable than Butterfly's picnic tables.

Maybe it was looking at Yelp before we arrived: 1870+ reviews and 4.5 stars sets the bar pretty high. Conversely, Pine State has about 550 reviews. For one: the water tastes bad. The water or the cups they use taste like chevre. I looked around the restaurant and no one was drinking their water, save for one person who was also drinking a bloody mary. The water or the cups were nasty. There was white depositing on the rims of the water cups. We're supposed to bring an advanced palate to this culinary expedition and the cups taste like old goat? We referred to the drinks in GPM for the rest of the meal, goats per million. We ordered the banana bread with foie gras for starters, being told it was \\"family style\\" and \\"like tapas\\"...those seem like two different concepts to me, either large portions meant to share, or small plates. It was the latter style. Banana bread was okay, good even. The foie gras, we thought it would be moussey, buttery, savory, light and creamy. Instead it was like a hunk of bacon fat, sinewy and gelatinous plopped on the bread. Two slices of bread, 3 plops of foie gras, $15. Okay. We thought once the hash (tasty something, with breaded oysters) arrived we'd be wowed. It took about a half hour to get the omelette or whatever it was called. Scrambled eggs, a biscuit, a cream sauce with dill, 4 oysters breaded. Between the banana bread and the abysmal wait, we ordered coffee, which was decent, from Water Ave. It was served in a glass mug which didn't seem to be a great insulator but looked cool. Okay, the cream sauce on the eggs was trascendant. I loved it so much and I promptly bought dill that day to cook with. But the eggs were just okay, the oysters were extra fishy (like they weren't fresh?) and savory, it overpowered the dish, maybe a lemon squeeze would have toned the harshness down, but overall we were just left feeling blase. Nothing blew our minds. The service was okay, but busy. Sitting at the bar in the first group ushered in at 9am, we felt the bar standers burning a hole in our backs, and plates. Liked the music, enjoyed the display of liquor and the bathroom wallpaper. Didn't like: the food, the prices, the water. Sorry, too many good places to toss $50 on a breakfast and leave hungry. Try Jam, Pine State, Bertie Lou's, Cheryl's, Off the Waffle, Fried Egg I'm In Love, Broder, Petite Provence, Zell's or Coquine. But skip Tasty and Alder.

We ordered the following, Radicchio Salad, The Cheese Board, Cedar Plank Salmon, Grilled Spanish Octopus, Duck Duck Potatoes, The Flat Iron Washimi Wagyu Steak w/ Sherry Glaze, And The Kobe Ribeye A4 Japan. The Octopus and Salmon were cooked to perfection, and both would just melt in your mouth. The two steaks were without a doubt the finest steaks ever eaten by our party. The Salad and Cheese Board were an excellent pairing with a nice Red Wine. And last but not least, the deserts.

They were presented beautifully and Japanese style in a tray. The filling of the shumai was tasty but a tad too salty and crumbly for my liking as I was expecting a traditional Chinese shumai that is more densely packed. The fox udon had a great underlying broth but was a little overwhelmed by the saltiness of the soy sauce. The udon was too stiff, unlike a classic udon that has a more chewy consistency. It wasn't terrible but also not impressive. Udon is pretty hard to come by in downtown so I appreciate the location and got my cravings for udon satisfied.

I found this place not to long ago and was blown away with the drink prices!! You do NOT find drinks priced like this, $2.50 PBR/HighLife tall boys... $3 mix drinks and $3.50 drafts (all drafts are $3.50 on Sunday ) the drink prices alone are worth making this place a regular visit.  420 at $3.50 Seriously!!  The food has been GREAT every meal, the stew was spot on and Wednesdays is $5 Burger n Fries !! There is always a good special for lunch and dinner. I've never waiting more than 15 minutes on my food from time of order. I've eaten here with friends and they all love the food!!  GREAT SERVICE! The place is kind of small but the staff is on top of it. I've only sat at the bar which is HUGE and nice. The bartenders are super friendly and love hooking you up. I don't see the \\"bad\\" service and \\"long wait time\\" that people are talking about. This place is a new hot spot and I would suggest getting there and trying it yourself!! Over all for East Atlanta Village, if your wanting to avoid a dirty or dive bar you can not find a better place!! Across the street from the Earl and my personal thoughts, The Elder Tree holds the title as the Best spot in EAV, even beating the Earl and Graveyard hands down. The pub is CLEAN, bathrooms are CLEAN, you get draft out of glasses and not plastic, bartenders are happy and eager to pour you a drink and there is parking in the back!! If your a smoker there is smoking on the front patio !!   This is my place."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is maybe one of the best brunches around.

There was even a bit of a mixup with the coupon deal that technically they could have turned away, but they honored it. The server made sure to tell us the gratuity was on the bill.

The dessert which included dark chocolate and kumquats was lovely. Finally, the wine list is fantastic as well, although I would add a rich cab to their by-the-glass list. Hell, maybe next time I go to Little Bird, my wish will be granted! I wouldn't be surprised, but I would be delighted."},{"name":"Clerys","address":"113 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"The only bar I know that has an identity crisis, but that does help it cater to a diverse group.Upstairs has a nice lounge that will flood with Hancock and Pru employees any night of the week.  It also has a solid bar area that was recently renovated, but one short trip downstairs and you are in a basement night club.  The music is usually solid and it's dark enough to not care who's grinding up on you so you know you are in for a good time.Hint: On popular nights the downstairs will pack up quickly after opening.

Sat at the bar, and the evening started well. First cocktail was reasonable, bar the need to feel I needed to wave my hands at the bartender to get his attention. Ordered the steak and fries, which came out piping hot and was delicious. To go with this, asked the bartender for a recommendation of a red wine. He suggested a glass, and on first taste I could immediately tell the wine was not good. Asked him to taste, and he tasted himself, and proceeded to tell me I was wrong and the wine was fine. I ordered another wine, I know when wine is not good. No attention during my meal, or checkin from the bartender despite him standing in front of me the whole meal. After dinner, the bill came before any comments. Checked it, and it looked fine, around $50. I ordered a coffee, and he ran my card. The receipt was returned to be signed $110. Asked for the bill again...with some disdain, he looked at me and proceeded. And he then realized he had over charged my card. He promptly tore up the receipt, despite me asking to keep a copy. The he charged my card again, and said he voided the previous charge with very little apology. When asked for the confirmation receipt for voiding the charge..he could not present it and stated he didn't know how to print it. This whole debate was on going in front of other guests. Finally a more sincerely apology. But by this time I was tired of this attempt to disregard the mistakes that had spoiled my dinner. I walked out disappointed, and as I passed the manager, he seemed oblivious to the event despite him apparently needing to void the mistaken charge. Poor form, your bartender should take a waiters course, and loose the attitude as it's not helping the restaurant in any way."},{"name":"Taqueria Star","address":"343 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I tried this after reading all of the rave reviews and was left a little dumbfound. I frequently preface my reviews by saying I'm a vegetarian so my food choices may be a little different. The al pastor tacos seem to be what everyone raves about and, well, I don't eat no al pastor. I ordered the spinach and then some other potato and bell pepper taco. I asked for both without cheese b/c most of the cheese that comes on tacos is hardly worth eating (IMHO). Both tacos were pretty spicy which I didn't mind. I would imagine someone w/ only a moderate spice tolerance would have found it inedible. Both were so loaded with some type of brown sauce that it made the tortillas soggy. The salsas were okay and I can see the appeal of them, but there is a little grocery store on Cameron Rd called La Michoacana (it's a chain but I haven't tried the others) that sells tacos and has a red and green salsa that would spank these salsa's a** . I applaud them for having so many non-meat choices. They probably have about 5 or so tacos to choose from--which is a lot for a truck in a liquor store parking lot. In the end I'll say this place was okay and that is truly about the best I can say for it. I don't imagine that I'll ever go here again.

It was difficult to serve that way, but the primary problem (apart from being undercooked and tasting incredibly fishy due to the butter) was that the steak was very grisly.  I tried cutting my half to get to what meat there was but gave up in frustration.  We thought about sending it back but by this point our dinner companions were halfway through their entrees, and we didn't want to start eating as they were done.

Every single thing I tried was excellent. Ceviche was my favorite appetizer (although the mushrooms swimming in melted cheese - not sure what that was called -was a close second). The ceviche came in very small diced pieces all piled together - perfect if you want a bit of everything in each bite, and I didn't once reach for a chip - just ate with a fork. My steak was phenomenal, and I would say that even if it wasn't topped with goat cheese, butter, and lump crab. I will be dreaming about this for days. the meat was so tender you could have ditched the steak knife, and that crab topping was worth every penny of the 49 it cost to add on. I asked for a veggie instead of rice and beans and got spinach sauteed up with some pico de gallo, garlic and lemon. Unique and tasty. I know it's uncharacteristic but I do not have any feedback on the margs, as I wasn't drinking. that's one reason I'm reserving a star. I also am holding a star back because while this seems like a really nice place and all with quality food, a $35 plate seems a bit overpriced, especially for a place playing the UT game on a big screen. I thought the service for a large party was very good as well; accurate and speedy.

We arrived and as expected it was busy, but not too busy. We were told that it would be a few minutes wait and we stationed ourselves to the side of the bar. This was my first time visiting the location since it was Vinny T's and thought the decor was quite an improvement; however, it was probably the ONLY improvement. After fifteen minutes of waiting another party walked in and was served immediately. We thought this was strange but assumed that maybe they had reservations. The host came over to us again and told us it would just a few more minutes. At this point we were getting a little annoyed because the wait was longer than he originally had said and we were all starving, especially my friend who had just ran the marathon. After about ten more minutes of waiting and watching others being served food another employee came up to us and told that the kitchen was closed and we would be unable to order food providing no further explanation. I seriously thought he was trying to be funny because why would they have had us wait if the kitchen was closing soon. It was not late either... we probably arrived around 8:00PM and I think this is a pretty acceptable time to eat dinner... but maybe that's just me. Needless to say, we were extremely frustrated and upset with the customer service we experienced here. I wished we had asked to speak with a manager but as I said before we were all exhausted and hungry. I don't think it's too much to ask for a restaurant's kitchen to stay open past 8PM... in fact the hours on their website say they are open until 2AM.

I was defaulted to try the cinnamon sugar donut, which was SO delicious.  This coming from a person who's had numerous fresh cinnamon sugar cider donuts at apple farms in the Northeast...this one ranks amongst the top of the list!  I returned amidst giant long lines, and after a couple tries, I also tried the blueberry, salted caramel cake, bacon, and toasted almond...all but the bacon being $2 each.  I think I like the almond one the best...it also seems like the coconut is the last to go in the bakery case, so I skipped getting that one for now, figuring I'll try it another time when they are out of the other kinds.Since they just opened, the space is sparse but clean and fresh.  There is one employee who takes the orders and manages the cash register...two others fill the orders, while others bus tables and continually refill the glass case with doughnuts.

It's 'Connecticut'-style, as they say: lots and lots of large chunks of fresh Maine lobster meat drizzled with hot drawn butter on a fresh and perfectly toasted roll. It's a large lobster roll; you could easily split it and the pile of fresh cut french fries with which it's served with a friend. The oysters are choice as well. They have varieties from various regions along the North Eastern coast, including Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick. My husband enjoys the Neptune burger, complete with a fried oyster atop a perfectly cooked-to-order medium-rare beef patty. Insane.

Came with my fambam at 4 pm on a Sunday and it was still packed (I really don't know why). The restaurant is small to begin with and there's only 6-7 tables plus the bar area. Waiters weren't super friendly when we walked it. It took a while to get their attention and the waiter who ended up seating us had the most miserable face I've ever seen -  I feel like her pet probably passed away recently or something. We only waited 15 minutes (which is nothing compared to the hours my friends have waited when they came) before getting to sit at a super crammed booth in the back. My mom and dad are HUGE oyster fanatics. I used to be too, but then when I was 13, I ate 36 oysters in one sitting and I could never look/smell/eat an oyster again. It was one of the saddest defeats in my eating history. Anyways, my parents ordered all the oysters on the raw menu as well as the clams. My sister - a huge foodie as well - ordered a Lobster Roll. She told me she had stalked it on Yelp for weeks leading up to her trip to Boston. And I ordered the clam chowder based on Yelp reviews. Food came within 20 minutes. I personally didn't have the oysters, but my parents tried all of them. I trust my parents' food critique just because they are huge foodies and the ones that introduced me to good food in the 626 WOOHOO. Anyways, they said the oysters were fresh but were just as good as the ones you can get for 99 cents at any oyster bar. It wasn't special. They said Neptune was probably popular because it had such a great variety of oysters- like there was 20 types of oysters on the menu. Are there even that many species of oysters? And they all looked the same too. I did muster up the courage and try the clams. The two types of clams, Littleneck and Cherrystone. Honestly, they tasted the same to me. Both were pretty salty - I felt like I was drinking the ocean. But once you got past that gross saltiness, the clams were pretty yummy, chewy, and rich. \\nThe clam chowder was good - nothing extraordinary. It was light, rich, and actually had a lot of clams in it. The lobster roll was HUGE. For $25, it was a pretty good deal. My sister refused to talk to me once it came, so I'm guessing she loved it. I had a bite and the lobster was SO good. Fresh, sweet, and chewy. I think Neptune is def overhyped. It's a good place to eat, but I don't get why people would wait more than an hour for this place.

Not true. 1 piece of fish, a couple scallops, a couple mussels, some beans, no carbs. It was disappointingly small and the flavor wasn't anything special.

Then our appetizers came out pretty fast after we ordered, so I thought we would be okay.Then the waiting began. It took an hour before we got our entrees. It got to the point where I was just tired of being apologized to. Also, during most of the waiting, we were sitting there with empty drinks. The food was decent, but the service was so awful, and the whole ordeal was so embarrassing, that I would never want to waste my time in Chago's again. They tried to make things better by taking maybe 5 dollars off the bill and giving us a free dessert, which after wasting close to two hours of my night there, seemed pretty lame. But, even if they had given us the whole meal for free, I doubt we would have gone back.

Why do so many of my reviews start out that way? I guess I'm just an optimist. The atmosphere was classy, and when we started with darned good chips and salsa my hopes improved. The chips are thick and crispy, with a nice salsa. We were seated near the backdoor, which on this cold night was problematic, as I was hit with an arctic blast every time someone opened the door. That was terrible, I had to put my coat back on. Minus one for poor air control. And the place was almost empty when we arrived (although overflowing when we finished), so we could have sat somewhere more climate-controlled.At the waiter's suggestion we started with the shrimp appetizer, bocaditos, basically shrimp with sauce on a tortilla. At about $2.50 per shrimp regular price, just under $2 per shrimp at happy hour, this seemed very pricey. Tasty, but probably not worth the price. They also had a special of a carnitas plate for two, which we decided to try. It was ok, nothing special. The pulled pork was pretty salty, but the texture was fine, it wasn't overly dry. The skimpy condiments included a tiny scoop of guacamole, about a teaspoon of shredded cheese, some picked veggies, and a nice sauce. You could make your own little tacos, which was fun, but I've had much better carnitas tacos at multiple taco trailers in town for about 1/5 the price.  The plate included a side of rice and beans, and I didn't particularly like either one. They had kind of a funny taste to me (but were better reheated for lunch the next day for some reason). I used the leftover pork to make a mac & cheese dish which I think was better than the tacos. We were also largely ignored by the waitstaff, we had to practically jump up and down to get attention. It took years to get our bill and pay when we were ready to leave. He also forgot things we asked for a couple of times. Overall, this is another trendy Mexican place with upscale prices and midscale food. For my money, I'd rather eat at Torchy's."},{"name":"Taqueria Los Rayos","address":"3473 Clairmont Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Decent tacos.

The other two, particularly the lengua, were a bit bland. Beef tongue isn't the most exciting taco meat to begin with, so it generally needs help. Three tacos make a good meal for an average person.Two very popular squeeze-bottle sauces at the table - one mild green sauce, one somewhat hotter red sauce. Hard to judge the service. I was there with a party of about twenty Yelpers. Our server did well to handle us all, efficiently taking orders. The food came out fairly quickly, as I'd expect from a BuHi taqueria. No one was sure how we were to pay, so we all eventually queued up at the register and told the server what we each had. Maybe with a normal size group they deliver the check to the table.

But Mondays are usually our low key days off, to be able to enjoy our own conversation, and not have someone else's voice rattling in my ear. We ordered the duck duck steak, and the cowboy breakfast. I definitely was surprised at the small size of my plate. It was the size of a salad plate for the duck duck steak. To my surprise, it was actually just enough.

The waitresses were always incredibly nice. Both times that I have been I have been given $25 gift certificates to come back which are in my opinion, nice gestures by the restaurant.All in all I think its a great spot for a good meal.

On the downside, it was impossible to get window seats, many patrons were aggressive about seating and there were even people hovering to push eaters out as quickly as possible.  My recommendation to the staff or owners would be: find a way to queue the window seats or most desirable seating.  I know, part of happy hour is the \\"free for all\\" seating style, but Portland City Grill markets itself as an elegant place, and I think the atmosphere would really reflect that if there weren't fights breaking out over where to sit, or people disturbing current eaters in hopes of stealing their tables.  Trust me on this one PCG: Get some kind of order in there and no one will ever regret coming here!Other than that, the food was good.  My husband was a bit sad his steak sandwich was on the small end, but I reminded him it was happy hour and that these were more sample-sized than the regular dinner menu.  He pointed out Ruth's Chris Steakhouse does a larger steak sandwich for happy hour for cheaper, and it's true, they do - but really what you are paying for here is the view.  And for the majority of you, it will be an obscured view, a view tainted by the arguing patrons, the hoards of people hovering, and the waiters trying desperately to restore order.  We sat by a piano, not knowing music was to come.  Had the pianist not come this would have been more of a three-star experience, but he really appeased us from the lack of a view.  He asked us (and other diners seated around the piano) if we had any requests.  We jokingly asked if he knew Creep by Radiohead, or any hip hop/r&b songs.  We didn't know what he'd bring to the table! Jill Scott, Marky Mark, and of course he knew 90s pop songs galore.  He played musical numbers and 70s ballads.  He played rag time and he played Spanish love songs.  He truly knew every number and even got people singing along.  He was the best.The pianist came on about 5 so that's good to know for you Sunday visitors.Other than that, our experience was fine - but I wouldn't go again unless I could request seating or even stand in a specifc queue for window seating.  I wouldn't mind standing longer, waiting longer, paying more, or really doing anything coherent and civilized in order to have my turn.  But whatever they have going on right now: it is antithetical to fine-dining.  It makes the restaurant look bad, it makes the owners look careless, and it makes the experience undesirable.  I would not take guests here - they would be so disappointed.  I would not have the nerve to fight someone for a seat and would pay more to be seated somewhere in a restaurant that respected my businesses and took control of it's customer base.Again, this applies strictly to the bar area and happy hour.  If you dine in and are ready to pay their exorbitant prices, you (might) be able to reserve a seat by a window.  I'm tempted to do it, but the quality of the happy hour didn't suggest to me I should come back for dinner."},{"name":"J.

I never will again waste my money on bad boring food that is several steps above Frozen TV dinners!

The chunks of lobster were plentiful on the buttered bun with each of the pieces lightly buttered. What was lacking was the heat (temperature) of the lobster itself. If the lobster chunks were even slightly more heated, it would have been a home run! Besides the temperature, the lobster was also not de-veined with little 'poop' strings in my roll, ew ew ew.Delicious fries also comes along with this dish that seemed to be double fried for your tasting pleasure.

And this is just my opinion. It's a popular place and people still flock there, so my opinion makes no difference. Anywho, the food isn't impressive, sadly. It's actually just ok. I had blueberry pancakes recently and I was bummed that the blueberries in the pancakes were not good. They had no flavor and the syrup unfortunately wasn't sweet enough to mask the flavorlessness. My partner seemed to enjoy his pancakes, though. However, he was devastated to learn that the pies there are not fresh. The look on his face was like he was 5 years old and someone told him Sinterklaas (Dutch Santa) doesn't exist. (Note, he is more bothered by the pie thing than I am.) The atmosphere is ok, but the noise level is so high, we had to sit next to each other in the booth because we were practically having to shout across the table to hear each other. It's also very chilly in there and I always have to remember to bring a coat or sweater, otherwise I freeze my @$$ off. I'm not giving this place less than 3 stars, though, because their Magnolia Mud is amazing, and the servers and staff are always very friendly and accommodating. Next time I'll just be sure to get the Mud or their desserts and try to get seated on the patio. (We asked for patio but for some reason they sat us inside.

Then come to find out there was an event, but still Splash is big enough to accommodated their private party and leave us girls with breathing room. We went off to a smaller room with a pool table and large white bar. It was very leisurely we were basically there by ourselves drank, danced, and had such a great time without having to wait for a drink or food (free buffet).

The food was hot and seasoned well. We had Spinach dip.  I had the Steak Maui (the ribeye) and Mac n Cheese.  My husband had the baby back  ribs, smashed potatoes, and creamed spinach.  The creme br√ªl√©e www excellent.  I had a caramel latte with a sugar crystal stirrer.  Their raspberry martini with grey goose was delish.  They give you a little flask with extra in it so you can fill your glass up a 2nd time.  This place reminds me of Houston's with more lightening.  It's quieter as well.  My husband said J Alexander 's ribs are better than Houston's because their ribs are bigger and they give you more sauce.   I did miss having their Huevos rolls.

Can I just tell you that the bartenders are phenomenal?   Well, yes they are. Tell them what kind of drinks you like and they will suggest something delicious that will be  right up your alley.  They make all the old standbys fabulously as well, like my favorite, the very retro Sidecar.  But tonight I wanted wine and before my friend arrived to join me the lovely bartender and I discussed my wine preferences.  The great thing is Scampo bartenders do not stint on tasting and so she let me try out a  number of wines she thought I might like. Ultimately she steered me to a luscious Gavi di Gavi which is a great white wine from the Piedmont area of Italy.  Delicious, yummy, fantastic..Gavi di Gavi I love you. While I was drinking my wine, I noticed the bartender mixing up a drink that was so pink and pretty I had to ask her what it was.  What she did, love bunny that she was, was to make a little extra to give me.  It was a strawberry, prosecco and balsamic vinegar something or other...Yes, I said balsamic vinegar.  Hello!  It was delicious!!  So, guess what I'm ordering next time I belly up to the Scampo bar?\\nI forget what it was called, but those are the 3 ingredients my friends. Trust me on this.When my friend arrived she ordered a nice Montepulciano and we chatted it up.  We eventually ordered some food and I had a delectable spinach gnocchi that was light, airy, luscious and did not, as some ill-prepared gnocchi sometimes does, sit like a lead boot in my stomach. My friend ordered a  ravioli dish that she thought was perfection and felt was also nice and light although I am aware that \\"light\\" and \\"ravioli\\" could seem oxymoronic.  So here you have it, another in a series of great after work Scampo bar \\"meetings\\" for me that provided great relaxation and enjoyment and really did not break the bank. Thank you Scampo, Lydia Shire and all you fantabulous bartenders. xoxo"},{"name":"La Grotta Ristorante Italiano","address":"2637 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The atmosphere at this cozy little Italian restaurant makes me feel like I'm at my grandmother's house for Sunday supper. And if my grandmother had been Italian then I'm sure this is how the food would have tasted! The menu was very authentic, with great choices for appetizers, pasta, fish and meat. Plus they serve grassini along with the bread... those crunchy breadsticks bring me back to Italy in an instant. Tonight I chose the cappellini with pancetta, shrimp, tomatoes, kalamata olives and capers in an olio sauce. The pasta was cooked very well and the flavors were very well balanced. I actually expected a salty dish but the way the olives were cooked they mellowed out the flavor almost to sweetness. I had the pinot grigio by the glass (its the only on on the list though I forget the label). It was standard not very impressing but went well with my food. For dessert I wanted to have the lemon sorbet but after I ordered the waiter came back and told me they were out. I wasn't in the mood for any of their other desserts, although my fellow diners got the ricotta cheesecake and the mango, raspberry, and pistache sorbets/gelato , respectively and everything looked great. I had a bite of the mango sorbet and it was tasty. All in all it was a nice night out and a good dinner.

We felt a little like an afterthought, but it wasn't anything to really get up in arms about.I ordered sparkling water and our server brought me bottled spring water instead. I brought it to his attention and he excused himself to go find a bottle of sparkling water. He returned five minutes later, and explained that he was confused because they were out of San Pellegrino and he offered me a Topo Chico.My friend ordered the omelette and I ordered the open faced egg sandwich. About 20 minutes later, we had to ask ourselves why our dishes were taking so long to get to us. Egg dishes can't take that long to prepare and cook, right? It was 2:30 PM. Maybe our server could feel our restlessness because he approached us to say that our dishes were on our way out \\"right at that moment\\". I was enjoying my meal and was maybe 1/3 of the way through when I saw what looked like mold on the crust of the bread. Are you joking? Did I just eat MOLD? I asked my friend if that's what it looked like to her and she said yes. It was absolutely mold. I was served, and had eaten, moldy rye bread.When I told my server he looked at it closer and said to me, \\"Let me check this with someone.\\" A manager came and spoke with us, but just to tell us that they would make me another meal. In this time, my friend finished her meal and we did not have time to stay, so I said I would take the sandwich to go. It took them 5 minutes to prepare the second time around, go figure. They gave me the \\"neighborhood discount\\" for my \\"inconveniences\\", which ended up being about $1.50 off of my meal. Is this how you feel like you should cater to guests? The way that management dealt with the issue is inexcusable. I felt like they didn't want to acknowledge the mold or believe that it could happen; I got a bunch of half hearted excuses about how their bread is fresh and stays in house for only two days before it is tossed. Why am I still left paying for poor food and poor service? What else back there has gone bad and has been sent out?As we left, we spotted one of the managers smoking behind the restaurant.

Got the chance to see the Fairmont strut its stuff under pressure. Much like Boston itself, the Fairmont kept its cool and continued with business as best they could under very trying times. Way to go Boston and Fairmont.Only one restaurant in the Fairmont Copley Square - the OAK Long Bar + Kitchen - and it is a good one. On the day of the lockdown in the city, probably half the Fairmont staff couldn't get to work, so many of its staffers were pressed into jobs they were not as familiar with - but all-in-all the Fairmont performed very nicely. Restaurant service slowed markedly because of the staff shortages, but service continued throughout the day. The OAK Long Bar + Kitchen may have slowed down but it never missed a beat. By the end of the lockdown day the restaurant was beginning to run short of some food items, but it redid its menu and kept serving all day. Having no place to go, we ate every meal there. Our threesome had breakfast of eggs benedict, brioche French toast, and yogurt/croissant ... a lite lunch of crab cake, mac + cheese with truffle & duck fat fries, and a small charcuterie of cornichons/olives/jam/meats/cheeses ... dinner was hamburgers all around as the kitchen started running out of food. With but one exception - the charcuterie - all the food was nicely prepared and tasty. The only problem with the charcuterie was the cheeses were exceptionally strong. Maybe that was just our taste. Also tried the clam chowder - very good.The restaurant does not take reservations, so plan ahead. This is not a place, even under normal circumstances, to drop in for lunch and have a quick beer and burger. You slow down here and linger a bit. That said, it is really a happening place and especially so in the evening. People meet at the Long Bar before hitting the town for the night or to just mingle and meet with friends. The Long Bar - all 60-some feet of it - is a nice draw for the hotel. Drinks were very nice - in size and price. They don't require your first-born son for a cocktail.

The butter one may be a bit more delicious in my opinion, especially during the winter months since it can warm you up, but kudos to the the mayo roll too. It is surprisingly light, as it is far more lightly tossed in mayo than other lobster rolls I have had in the past.We sat and talked with our table mates and Vinny through 2 bottles of wine (great selection), and then Vinny treated us to an appertif (which sadly, I cannot remember the name of) it was dark pink (almost red) and delicious.

While these are three of the most important characteristics of quality in a restaurant, they are probably even more important when it comes to a sushi place.  By its nature, it must be beautiful, have great flavors that are complementary and the seafood HAS to be fresh.  We ordered a Magic Roll and a King Lobster roll off their Special Roll menu.  In both cases the flavor was excellent, particularly the tempura lobster and asparagus combination.  Technique was outstanding with crisp tempura, tightly rolled, and beautifully portioned.Lows:  One tiny soy sauce souffl√© cup for us to share.  C'mon, put in one PER ORDER.  Two special rolls = Two soy sauce souffl√© cups.  The bag was nicely packed and stapled shut when I picked up the order so I really couldn't have checked it otherwise.  It may seem like a tiny thing, but we didn't have enough soy sauce, so the last couple of bites felt incomplete.Overall:  I like including my kids when my wife and I go out to eat.  While they will venture into interesting foods from time to time, sushi is NOT an area they've been open to explore yet.  And since there really isn't a sushi form of chicken fingers (opportunity perhaps?), we tend to order sushi to go vs. eating in.  This is our second order from Mikado and both times, it's been fantastic.  And since we're picking up, we haven't had to deal with the service issues other reviewers have experienced.Finally, I believe you can tell a great sushi place by the quality of their Wasabi.  In general, my philosophy is that greatness is found in the details.  And while Mikado knocks it out of the park with the detail they apply to their sushi, it is refreshing to see that they apply the same care to their Wasabi.  Now if I could just get them to add the second cup of soy sauce..."},{"name":"Revolution Doughnuts","address":"908 W College Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"This place is awesome.

Now to be fair this is because of how busy they are. Next the waiting area for coffee was very cramped. Once again this was because of how busy they were so it's hard to fault them for this.So the 3rd reason for only 4 stars is petty and selfish on my part hoping people will see they do not have a perfect 5 star overall score and decided not to risk it and go to Krispy Kream.

Huge selection of Gluten free, organic, and international food. The Wegmans App is amazing.

Excellent customer service. Wegmans doesn't just say it, they live it. Ask any team member and they are happy to help you find something. Not sure what to buy? Ask.

The mac & cheese was better than I remember having there in the past and the fries were hot.  The serving was enough.  Myself and my guest both had fries with our meals - we should not have to ask for ketchup.  The table next to us (same server) also needed ketchup and borrowed ours.

Located in the Brookhaven shopping center with Publix, Costco, Jefe's and other place, Hobnob has seemingly secured its place, relatively fast, in the Brookhaven \\"must go' list. Unlike its Midtown sister location, this place has a clear separation between bar and dining area, and also boasts more inside seating. A patio is available, but it is scarce as it is decently small. To make the outside size seem less noticeable, there are rolling doors that open the bar area directly up to the patio, as well as a bar being \\"walk up\\" available for those sitting there. The inside is much larger than its sister restaurant and includes many booths, tables and a decently open-air kitchen that allows the patron to see what exactly is going on. Enough about the layout, down to the food. I originally fell in love with Hobnob bc of the lamb burger, but at this location I have branched out and fell in love with a few things...the first being the \\"three little piggies\\" pizza.

Parking was on the street within the surrounding neighborhood, and there was a light drizzle and it was only 45 degrees.  Was I going to be circling the block, only to trudge miles to experience a trendy letdown?  Luckily parking wasn't bad, we found a space readily, but do keep in mind we were there on a Monday, around 9:30 a.m.Our group that day was HUGE - 16 people total.  I think everyone ordered a different entree.  My choice was the daily special, Asparagus Eggs Benedict with basil hollindaise and a balsamic vinaigrette drizzle.  As items rolled out, every last entree was impressive!  Grand Mariner French Toast was my friend's entree, huge and fluffy.  She swore she was only going to eat part but at the end couldn't bear to leave any behind!  My friend across the table had the Corned Beef Hash, and it had such huge portions she couldn't get through even half of it.  That one could easily be shared between two people, especially if you wanted to get a single of their pancakes, which I really wanted to sample, but knew I wouldn't have room for.I was going to be busy the rest of the day wandering around, so I knew Eggs Benedict was going to be the right size for me.  I'm a little odd for preferring my eggs more well done, not hard boiled but no runny yolks, and when I cut it open I saw the cook had nailed it perfectly.  My first bite of the sauce was overwhelming - the fresh herbs, the asparagus done just right, cooked but still firm, almost crisp.  It was absolutely the best Benedict that I have ever had, and worth every penny.The restaurant was loud (just the way it was built, tall ceilings, no carpet and the amount of people visiting there) and the service was fine.  Our party was so huge I wasn't expecting a lot in terms of personalized service, but he was able to deliver food promptly and separate our checks properly.  I don't think anyone in our party was disappointed visiting there, except for me, because I don't live in Portland and I'll never be able to come back and try another item or one of the fancy flavored Mimosas.  Bittersweet indeed.  Food was absolutely fantastic, it was a bit loud, so not for the hard of hearing or folks that want a really quiet, calm space (unless they have slow moments, which I imagine may happen in more \\"off\\" hours?) but that's about the only negative I could say about anything.  Honestly I'd say if the food quality is this high consistently, finding a dull moment there is probably going to be a challenge.

I come here when I want a quiet dinner, a taco or two with a (special) friend. The atmosphere of this place makes it feel upscale, and it has a nice patio overlooking the creek, but mercifully, you can get out of there with a pretty reasonably priced meal. Taco plates are a good bet and the tacos are creative and spunky. Attention hungry lumberjack types: the portions here are small-ish. I think the portions are perfect but if you are looking for a giant plate overflowing with food, probably don't go here. That said, I haven't tried a lot of different entrees, maybe some are bigger.

The views are really spectacular and the draw of this place is certainly the vista as you gaze out over the river and cityscape. The decor is traditional and inviting and the layout permits a large perimeter of window tables from which to take in the city. It's a good thing Portland City Grill has a lock on arguably the best real estate in this charming Northwest city because the food does not measure up to the atmosphere here. The service is welcoming and on point. I had a steak salad which was top sirloin sliced and done medium rare resting on a wedge of ice berg lettuce with a cheesy vinaigrette dressing and a few measly cherry tomatoes.  Meat was cooked nicely and the bleu cheese in the salad paired nicely. The bits of bacon were a bit fatty for my liking but overall the dish was fine. My husband's ahi tuna nicoise was a much better choice-ingredients were fresh and the flavors were balanced. We passed on dessert as the Creme br√ªl√©e ordered by a neighboring table looked like something out of a diner. Tip: they'll validate your parking in the area garages  where the restaurant is designated. Nice touch. Overall, this place meets expectations in the way of atmosphere if you want a great city view. Bathrooms are super clean and nicely appointed. Best to come here for a cocktail or beer during an early happy hour to watch the sun shine over the many River bridges than to dine on their mediocre food served by a staff that is pleasant and tries really hard.

The cashier suggested the chicken and avocado wrap.  She said it was her favorite.  Now, I usually stick with what people recommend since they've usually tasted everything and know what's good and what isn't etc.  However, the wrap was pretty plain to me.  It tasted like something I could get at a deli.  The drinks were good though.  I ordered a homemade chai tea which was great.  It was a bit spicy but I asked for soy milk so it was sweet too.  I would definitely stick to more of the breakfast items at this cafe.

Pull out your fingernails instead, cut your losses and save a lot of money.  You really don't need to read any more; but, here it is for those gluttons of punishment...Service = Neglectful and resentful.  \\nWe were not allowed to order anything except the full course meals with preselected salad sampler, appetizer of minced meat, the entree, and dessert.  We were punished for not all coming in the restaurant at the same time and had to wait 30 extra minutes to give our beverage order.  No rosewater handwashing service, instead we had forks thrown (I'm not being dramatic here) down to us.  Our table of 4 received the same amount of salad, appetizer and dessert that the tables of 2 received,  even though we paid twice as much for our food.  We were scolded when we reminded our waiter that we never received our appetizer.  The server must have known how bad the food would be because he never checked on us, not even to see if we wanted another drink.  The tea \\"service\\" consisted of his angrily dashing (still not being dramatic) fragrant water at us, slopping some tea in our glasses and telling us to make a wish  (we all privately wished to be magically transported to another restaurant).  Atmosphere = Dirty and Dingy.  \\nAt one point, perhaps 7 years ago when  2 of us last came here, the fabric was clean and magical.  It doesn't appear to have been cleaned or changed out since then.  Though the restaurant was packed and bustling with excitement at first, by the time the dancer came out most of the patrons were so sour  from disappointment and starvation, it seemed to have affected her performance.  So sad for her.  She didn't even bother to come around for tips.Food =  Just plain bad.\\nThe small sample of salads was  received eagerly by starving patrons.  The appetizer was cold, because we eventually got it after our entree.  The entrees were each accompanied by a lovely pool of oil.  The chicken was mostly skin and fat and the lamb shank was more grizzle than meat.  I rescued my drowning prawns.  Dessert was julianned pieces of canned fruit and a sample of some unidentified filo based pastry.  The tea was actually water and simple syrup.  And for all this pleasure including 1 beer per person, we paid a little over $280 and signed over our next born children (o.k. the child part is dramatic- but, dang!  this place was EXPENSIVE).

The place was packed and we were seated almost immediately, next to a very large table of twenty or so. The service was attentive despite competing with the twenty-top and a packed house.The food was outstanding.I started with the oyster bocaditos which reminded me of Chef Garrido's signature dish when he was at the helm of Jeffrey's. The oysters were perfect. My bff started with an  ala carte brisket taco that I did not taste but about which she raved. Both of us were inspired to choose chicken enchiladas with habanero cream sauce and we were rewarded with utter deliciousness. The cream sauce was not too heavy or too spicy; it was just right. I opted for no rice so I can't comment there but the beans that accompanied my entree were perfect. I didn't know beans could taste like that and I'm generally a fan of beans. Both my friend and I opted for \\"half\\" orders of the enchilada plate, which was technically two-thirds since apparently the full portion comes with three enchiladas. Our server stated that most items on the menu could be served in either smaller or larger portions depending on the selection which I appreciate as it allowed us to taste a couple of things. The on-the-rocks Hornitos margaritas we had were the best I've had in years. Not too sweet, clearly fresh and way too easy to drink. My rating here would have been five stars but for the only drawback: the noise. We had a lot of catching up to do and I felt like we spent most of the evening yelling back and forth because it was so loud. It's not clear to me if the restaurant is always that loud or ithe volume should be chalked up to our seating next to a large & celebratory table on a pre-holiday busy Saturday night.

Some of the meals we've really enjoyed: BURGERS, scallops, short ribs, and salmon.  For drinks, I'm always getting their version of the Moscow Mule.  Both the nutella flatbread and the peanut butter chocolate cake have been worthy desserts. The only (slightly) negative experience:  Just before the holidays we brought the mother and father-in-law here.  The wait time was crazy as there was a big party taking up the back, and it was a little loud for their taste (aka old ears).  However, the food was awesome and that saved the night!

There was a thatchy sort of covering, large picture windows affording a view of the lovely tropical gardens outside, old brick, sconces, ceiling fans -- a total visual delight, save  for one faux pas:  I'm no interior designer, but I don't think I'd be going out on a limb to say that brightly-colored artificial flowers never work in any decorating scheme.I began with a very nice shrimp 'n grits starter, in a tomato sauce (not a roux, a sauce), and my main entree was crawfish etouffee, made with lots of flavor, like the good lord intended.  My last crawfish etouffee was curiously de-flavored.  I won't mention the name of the restaurant, but it starts with Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen.  (By the way, there was little or no music playing at the Bistro, such a nice alternative to that other unnamed place, where we kept asking them to please turn the music down to a comfy level.)It was a good day, made even better by the birthday party of nine sitting at the next table, who occasionally made some suggestive remarks and hand gestures.

Music, drinks, vibe, food, etc. Though those days have long since gone, Sound Table comes real close to bringing them back. That's probably because Jeff and Karl were a part of the places, the music, and the experiences I'm reminiscing about. Yes, Atlanta used to have a very real and very viable dance music scene. But beyond simply a cool place with good music, Sound Table also offers good food and good drinks too. I go for the drinks and the dancing, but the earlier crowd I'm sure would enjoy a meal as well. Couple of caveats though. The ergonomics of the place are fairly brutal, especially before the tables in the back are moves for the dance floor. It's a narrow space not unlike any standard joint you'd find in NYC. Also, the specialty drinks aren't cheap and you get more ice than liquor. Finally, if you want to go to a steamroom for free, just go dancing at Sound Table in the Summer...it's HOT.  Having said all that, they do have one if the best sound systems in Atlanta. Almost every club owner in Atlanta should go there and educate themselves cause most of what you hear music on in this city is garbage. The crowd is real diverse too, so anyone will feel at home. Check the place...house heads especially."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The hype on this place is somewhat overrated but a great seafood meal can still be found here.

I sat at the bar and the servers/bartenders were nice enough but not overly informative with the menu. Crudo of the day.......they didn't offer, I had to ask.  \\"Do you have any questions about the menu?\\".....didn't hear that question, had to bring them up myself. Their work space behind the bar is incredibly cramped and confining so I'm cutting them slack. I would definitely NOT work in that space myself so I give them credit.\\n              Food....ordered the buttermilk johnnycake with smoked trout tartare and California sturgeon caviar because I had seen it on a CookingChannel episode of Unique Eats. Very tastey. Loved the smoked trout tartare. The proportions were off though. Way to much pancake to fish ratio. The dish would be much more balanced with either less johnnycake or more trout tartare. The entr√©e was the North End Ciopinno with lobster (lobster is an optional choice but come on.......if you're going to do it, do it right!) Visually appealing and delicious. It could have been just a bit more spicier for my taste but that's a minor caveat.  It comes with saffron rice but I opted not to have the rice since I'm not a fan of saffron and why fill up on all that starchy rice when you have all that amazing seafood and delicious broth?\\n              Overall a great place, despite the cramped quarters (Be prepared to make friends with your neighbors) Definitely recommended.

Thankfully, that was a few years ago.I will say, however, the place has had a face lift, and the newly painted walls are gorgeous. The walls used to be darker, and it made the interior look dank and dusty, so the new renovations look great!On the other hand, I did notice an increase in the amount of chotchkies lying around the place, and that made the newly-renovated Bistro look like my grandmother's living room.

An old high school friend and I decided to try to beat the Friday night dinner rush and showed up at the restaurant at 5 PM. As soon as I walked in, I realized why the place is known for its wait - the restaurant is tiny! There were probably a maximum of 30-40 seats in the whole place, and this was with minimal open floor space. Regardless, I had heard too much about the lobster roll to walk away and the waitress was kind enough to take down our cell number so we didn't need to wait in the restaurant. About 10-15 minutes later, a surprisingly short wait, we got a call and headed back to be seated at the bar. First we started with a single oyster each - my friend got one from MA and I got one from NB (described as med size, med salt, with a champagne finish). Neither of us are really oyster connoisseurs so I can't say if the oysters were very different from the fresh ones I had just eaten at the Haymarket outside but unless my tastes become much more sophisticated, I probably won't be paying $2.70 for an oyster again. I had a small debate over whether I should try the cioppino but ultimately followed through with my original plan to order the hot butter lobster roll with a side of salad rather than fries. The very first bite was DELICIOUS, meaty, buttery, warm, and good. However, I have to question the $25 price. I haven't had many lobster rolls so I'm not sure how this one compares but I hardly think that substituting mayo with butter and heating the roll a bit should constitute a doubling in price. Adding butter generally makes everything taste good - so I wonder how difficult this actually is to make with the right ingredients. Also, the butter seeped into the bread and made the bottom half a bit soggy. Perhaps toasting the bread would help with this problem. Finally, the salad that came with it had a pretty presentation of lettuce leaves arranged as a flower but the vinaigrette was overwhelmingly salty.All that aside, I still really enjoyed my experience at Neptune Oyster and was very sad to come to the end of my lobster roll. For those of you who love fresh seafood cooked well and aren't afraid to pay a premium for it, I have no doubt that Neptune Oyster can provide."},{"name":"Mio Sushi","address":"1255 NW 185th Ave","city":"Aloha","stars":"4","text":"Don't know if they've changed things since I went (only went once as that was enough), but this place was not worth going to for sushi or anything else Japanese food related.While not bad, the sushi definitely left much to be desired.  If I order tai, which is a very light flavored fish, DO NOT PUT SIRACHA ON IT.  If I want to do it, that's up to me, but don't decide for me, unless you were trying to hide sub-par fish and if that was the case then congrats because I didn't taste the fish at all.I ordered Ramen (which IIRC at the time was about $7-8) and what I got was a bowl of Maruchan Ramen (you know the one, it sells for $0.10/package).  I've had Ramen in Korean owned restaurants before and some of it can be decent, but this was BY FAR the worst attempt I've seen.  It was the worst Ramen in a restaurant that I've EVER had.I'm sorry if my review of this place is dated but I won't ever go back despite decent service.  Many others may enjoy this type of restaurant but I have a problem with the twist on the flavors here, too much siracha and other sauces to hide the flavors sushi is supposed to have.

The prices are through the roof and you don't get service that matches a 200+ dollar bill.  As locals who really, really want to love this place, we like the oysters and food, but never fail to get a better value at Mare, Bricco, Lucca, Pomodoro or Carmen.

My boyfriend and I arrived around 11:30, thinking we were being smart to bypass the lunch rush but  man were we wrong. Long line, seats full and the restaurant is quite small, fitting 20-25 people. With how crowded it was, we ended up putting our names down for a 1-1.5 hour wait. We've been wanting to come here for a long time, so we waited the full time, and stalled at the Boston Public Market for some coffee just across the street. But if you want to eat here by 12pm, especially on the weekend, definitely come around 11AM to get ahead in line. The food here is no doubt incredibly fresh and cooked well. You can even see someone shucking the oysters right in front of the restaurant window. We ordered four different kinds of oysters, fried clams, the scallops and the cioppino. The fried clams came out first were really juicy, breaded really well, and overall tasty. The oysters were SO GOOD. Refreshing and flavorful, those oysters set the standard of how all oysters should dream to be. My absolute favorite part of the meal was the scallops. The combination of the tender scallops, smokey bacon, corn, pea tendrils, and sauce were amazing. It was a wonderfully balanced dish with flavors that worked harmoniously together. My boyfriend had the cioppino which was pretty much the sea itself with lobster, shrimp, salmon, mussels, clams, white fish, and rice in a spicy broth. I wish I could've tried, but since I'm allergic to shrimp, I had to taste it vicariously by how he described it.If you're in Boston, I would definitely come here at least once!

That sounded less appetizing, yet I was intrigued enough to order it.  To my surprise, I really enjoyed it.  It wasn't \\"warm\\" like soup or a pasta dish, but rather vegetables and croutons at room temperature, which suited the flavors and ingredients well.  The pasta for 2 included four different pastas and my favorite, hands down, was the noodles with some mouth-watering truffle cream sauce.

After requesting a reservation, I received an email back stating that my reservation was confirmed along with a code for entry. We arrived at the exact time of the reservation. When I gave the host my name, he says, \\"If a table becomes available, I'll let you know.\\" I was a little confused about that statement since my reservation was confirmed. We then proceeded to grab a drink at the bar. After standing at the bar for 20 minutes without being acknowledged, finally a waitress comes by and I asked if she could answer a few questions and take my drink order. She was very polite and helpful. She took our order. We waited another 15 minutes or so, and finally got our drinks. Just as my friend told me, the cocktails were amazing - that was the only good part about this experience. While still waiting for a table, we saw 3 people get seated. I saw the same waitress again and asked if she could check on our table. I saw her in passing again and asked for an update, and she said there was nothing available. My boyfriend saw there were 2 open seats at a table, and decided to walk up and ask the group was anyone sitting there. The lady replies, \\"I don't mind if you sit here, but the rest of our group would.\\" I was shocked! I then decided to close our tab and leave. The crowd was very alt-right and pretentious. The inattentive staff was definitely not much help. I guess we didn't \\"fit the mold\\". Needless to say, I will not be going back, and I certainly will not recommend this place to anyone.

I went there at 5 pm to try to get on time for my wife and I to eat at 6:45. They said it was an hour wait so we should not start waiting. I returned at 5:40 and they then said an hour wait so I went on the waiting list trying to be clear that my wife would arrive at 6:45. They then called at 6:25 to say I had 10 minutes to get to my table or I would lose my spot. So I went back and got to the bottom of the line at 6:30 where they said it would be a 1.5 to 2 hr wait. I get that it is important to work within their constraints for seating but at the same time I think their position of \\"tough luck\\" is a major insult to people who are honestly trying hard to work within their constraints.

The environment is a typical American sports bar layout with the added benefit of having covered outdoor space to avoid the direct assault of an Austin summer.

The food isn't always prepared consistently and lacks any originality.  But the biggest challenge for this restaurant / bar is their service.

There are times that friends and I have arrived at the bar and will wait over 15 - 20 minutes to be acknowledged before even placing an order whole the bar staff is chatting with other staff or searching their cell phones.  Even on slow nights you get the feeling that the staff is inconvenienced by your presence.  It is equally clear that the management staff has grown tired or apathetic to the situation.  I would encourage you to explore other options around Austin that are much more customer centric."},{"name":"Moe's Southwest Grill","address":"863 Ponce De Leon Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"ThIs location and their employees are amazing.

We waited for about an hour to be seated, which we expected, and was consistent with what the hostess advised us of when we arrived. It was nice that they offer free coffee while you wait, even if it was a little sour tasting. But, nothing a lot of cream can't fix though :)I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken. It looked and tasted like I could've  gone to a hole-in-the-wall takeout place and gotten the same thing for half the price. Greasy fried hunks of dark meat chicken with a slightly spicy, bright red-orange sauce all over. Also, on the menu it states the dish has \\"eggs two ways\\" but there was only one egg on top, only one way--fried. Maybe I missed #2? The pickles on the side however were delicious!! I would've been happier with just a bowl of those!Some of the other dishes we ordered included the sauteed spinach (very good), frittata (very small for the price), cowboy breakfast (the steak was cooked perfectly), and enchiladas (meh).The best part of the meal was my cocktail, which was some sort of champagne and gin concoction--though it took nearly a half hour to receive once I ordered it. One last note is that apart from the hostess and one nice girl cleaning tables, the waitstaff and service we received were awful. Our waitress was not at all helpful when one of my friend's had some menu questions, and she had an attitude of not even caring about our table and never came to check on us. When she delivered dishes she'd drop them on the table without saying anything or really looking at us and walk away. The food service was also strange and slow. We were told everything is served family style and brought to the table as it's ready. Okay, sure, that's fine. Our first few dishes came out in a reasonable amount of time and then we waited nearly an hour for the last two, as we watched other tables seated well after our party get served plate after plate. TL, DR: Mediocre food and terrible service.

New owners? I came in without calling on The Saturday after thanksgiving - I made the same mistake yesterday and found them closed. Call ahead! You cannot expect the consistency you would from other restaurants. Seeing they were out of their cinnamon rolls I asked when they would have them and the answer I got was, \\"our baker is back there now but we don't know what she is baking.\\" This was delivered as if I should be excited by such a mystery. Obviously missing the humor in this I asked if she could find out or \\"if it is a secret?\\" She looked startled by my desire to know and said she could. Five minutes later she came back to say tonight or tomorrow. Still seems like a secret where customers are not allowed to know the specifics. I asked if they could be more specific so that I could know when to come tomorrow. They told me after they did a few things they would return to the baker to get an answer. After waiting in a mostly empty restaurant for another ten minutes the manager (I'm assuming) came to tell me they only do cinnamon rolls on Mondays and Thursdays and since they ran out Wednesday and Thursday was a holiday it would be Monday before they would have them. No apology. No coupon to come back. No, \\"how about a ...\\" She delivered the news and nearly literally ran away. Poor planning around a holiday that leaves many of us entertaining gf family all week and worse yet, just terrible customer service. Hire better and train better.

In fact, the lamb shank (specially priced on Thursdays) was the tastiest cut of lamb I've ever put in my mouth.  The three-course meal was put together pretty well.  Lentil soup arrived first with flat bread.  It was hot and flavorful.  The salad had quite an array of vegetables, some grilled, some uncooked.  My date and I enjoyed 90% of it.  The lamb stole the show.  It was juicy, perfectly spiced, and extremely tender.  Heavenly.  I would go back just for that.The atmosphere is fun, albeit a little tacky.  The floor seating is comfortable and it is a welcoming change to sit low and eat at your knees.  Feels like a picnic.  A hookah compliments the seating arrangement perfectly where you can sink down to the floor and melt while you puff shisha.  The dancers are talented and put on an entertaining show, but the music sounds cheesy.  It's a bass-thumping cheap techno beat with a Morrocan overlay.  Not a huge fan.  Something a little less intense and more authentic would suit the place better.  The low lighting is good for the ambience, but bad for reading menus.  Finally, our waiter spoke very quietly and seemed to be reading the preparations and ingredients from a proctor.

I've eaten here a couple times to make sure the first time wasn't an unusual experience.Today's experience was pretty bad, though. My first time the only good part of the meal was the French toast, so that's what I went back there for, promising my friend some delicious, buttery, slightly crisped on the outside, French toast. What we got was not even fully cooked, nor had the batter reached the center, so we had slightly egged bread. We both tasted it, and I immediately asked for the check, which I promptly received, paid, and left. Our server never once asked if anything was wrong, or wondered why we left our table of food veritably untouched. Edit: I have a theory, I think too many restaurants are hiding under their house-made sauces and compotes, and aren't really focused on the quality of the core food they are cooking. In this case, Tasty offers their French toast with a rhubarb sauce that we requested on the side. Perhaps a less discerning diner would eat the slightly egged bread with rhubarb sauce and consider it a tasty dish.Other notes, when asked questions about the menu, our server seemed both confused and annoyed that we would even consider to ask a question about how something is made or presented, or what specifically might go in it. I won't rant about their silly waiting procedure, other than to say it is laughably inefficient, but, hey, it's not my business to run. One bright note, there's one particular server working here who is super nice and quite awesome. Sadly, we weren't able to keep him for our own, who knows, we might have stayed and eaten. Portland seems to be obsessed with an incestuous need to love what it loves and not an objective palette to discern some really incredible restaurants from some overrated, overhyped, line-inspired, food-places.

The staff has always been fantastic, and if you're offended by someone because they're tired and you came in 30 minutes before closing, then that's your own fault.

If we could give 2 1/2 we would have.  The place isn't that big but we went around 8pm on a Friday night and there were plenty of tables.  The place was bright and clean, when we walked in we were told to seat ourselves.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited for over 5mins for someone to even acknowledge us.  Each time the server walked by our table we had such high hopes they would say something to us, maybe say 'be with you in a minute' or even take our drink order but 3 passes and nothing.   When the server finally came to our table we were ready to order.We both ordered the classic wuburger and I got a raspberry lime rickey.   Ok first, you have 2 glasses at your table and the server brought over a bottle of water for us.  We weren't offered any ice and the water was room temperature, really?  It was also a pretty hot night out too.  Second I got my raspberry lime rickey and it was the worse one I have ever had.  There was no lime wedge and if there was raspberry it was just a dash of it.  I wish I had taken a picture of the drink because I'm sure just by the light, light pink shade you would never think it was a raspberry lime rickey (at least there was ice in it).Our burgers arrived promptly. which was probably the highlight of the evening.  The vessel used to serve the burgers in, what is that?  It's this metal 'basket' that is just wide enough for the burger and lined with wax paper, really? that's it?  It may sound like a trifle thing but I dont want to have to maneuver how I'm going to put my burger down when I need to put it down.Taste wise, burgers were just a regular burger, nothing special.  Fries were tasty and sadly the potato salad was pretty disgusting.   It had this sour taste to it which made me think it was old or they just dont know how to make potato salad.  Though this is the only dedicated burger place in the area we will not be returning when we can easily make the same burger at home.As always, never take my word for it and try it yourself."},{"name":"Lincoln Tavern and Restaurant","address":"425 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Waitress was on top of things.\\nTruffled fries was ok.\\nTruffled mac and cheese with braised ribs were ok.\\nKobe sliders came with baby pickles were delicious.

PCG doesn't promise window seats, but my parents ended up preferring where they sat, as we were all able to sit and face outside in the booth, and see everything in the restaurant, and the view outside.  The team at Portland City Grill also decorated the table with a great card, some rose petals, and mini happy anniversary signs.  It was so awesome.  My parents have never been to a restaurant like this before.  They live in a small town, do not travel much, and have never seen anything like this, ever.  It was fun to share a great restaurant with them, coach them on the menu, and teach them about the waiters, tipping, etc.We ordered a ridiculous size steak that came with sides, a salad, and dessert for all of us to enjoy at one lump price.  It was all fantastic, as it allowed me to enjoy the medium rare meat I wanted (close to the bone), and my parents to enjoy the medium well meat they like.

Not a huge portion, which is perfect for dessert purposes, but a perfectly seasoned and cooked steak which has a small amount of a delicious garlicky sauce on it, with perfect thin cut, crisp fries.  I am no fan of beef, but it was so amazing, I actually ordered it the 2nd time we went.  I had the Lobster Cobb salad on my first visit, which was delicious.  Nicole, our server both times, let me substitute a mixed salad for the fries with my steak, and it was huge and had a traditional french vinaigrette on it.  So good.  My husband had the special manhattan the first visit, in fact he had 2 they were so good.  Since it was a bit much although I was driving, the second visit we had some Perrier Jouet, by the glass.  So rare you can find it by the glass. For dessert, both times, I had the Lemon Mousse.  Holy cow, each bite was a bit of heaven.  The first visit my husband had berries in champagne whipped cream, which was amazing, the second he had the strawberry short cake.

We went on a road trip and went thru portland at the beginning and luckily ate here. On our way back we went thru Portland and made sure to go back. I'd say this restaurant usually has a wait. However, the times they quote are accurate and they do call you if they say they will. Given they handle it well the wait time is a non issue.At every table there corn nuts there when you're seated. They're delicious- perfect amount of saltiness and spicy. They leave water jugs at your table so you can refill as needed if the server isn't near- huge plus.  Both times our servers were informative and overall great servers. All the staff we encountered seemed friendly, but not over the top.We sat at the bar table in front of the kitchen. The kitchen is open so it's cool to watch them making the food. Their bathroom wasn't anything fancy, but it was clean and well lit and did it's job. Only issue I can point out is there are some tables in the middle of the restaurant that are two separate tables placed very close together. The tables are separated by a few inches so it kind of seems like you're dining with the people at the neighbouring table. This could be fine if it's you're thing, but if you're looking for something more private I wouldn't recommend those seats. We asked to be moved from there at the beginning and they were accommodating.I don't really like tapas. Their menu is nice because there are enough options that could be an entree on their own that you don't have to do tapas. But if you want to do tapas there are great options for that too. The first time we went we ordered (between two of us) the alder burger (comes with fries), goat cheese dumplings, and the house made pasta beef ragu. That was too much food- we could have done without the burger. The pasta was incredible- good texture, flavourful, great portion size, and fair price. The dumplings come with toast. The toast tastes good dipped in the tomato sauce. I didn't try any of the burger but it looked good. We went back the second time and had the steakhouse brownie. It was good and I would have it again. But, it was nothing incredibly unique. The goat caramel was tasty- I had it on the side which I'd recommend so you can control the amount of sweetness.

Give them a try, just because, they don't look like what we are accustomed, don't shun them without trying them."},{"name":"Hudson FC International Sports Pub","address":"4058 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Brookhaven","stars":"4","text":"Delicious and great selection of beers on draught. I had a delish portobello sandwich and my husband had bangers and mash. The sausage was so good that we asked the chef - who came to our table to ask how our food was - where it was from...A few minutes later, he came back with printed info about the sausage provider. So nice! Love that - feels like the \\"local\\" - we will be back."},{"name":"Wai Wai Restaurant","address":"26 Oxford St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious Chinese food. Great hole in the wall type of restaurant. Bathroom was super clean so that means they are clean with their food. Great service. Price super affordable."},{"name":"Chili's","address":"12181 E Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"We received a gift card recently and I was UGH. My last experience at this location was terrible a few years ago. We went last Sunday for lunch and WOW! New menus, GREAT food, and great service.  If you have written off Chili's give it a replay. Our whole party was VERY impressed! We are going back tonight!"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I know many of my other friends are charmed by this place but I'm not. I've tried it several times and just don't see the appeal. The line is usually long, there main cashier has a major attitude problem, and I don't think the price is that great (for goodness sake a biscuit is basically flour and water!) While I can't deny the biscuits are delicious (and their jam is even better), its not worth the trouble for me. I can make something equally good in my kitchen."},{"name":"Big Time Street Food","address":"805 E Washington St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Omg! The food is always AMAZING. BEST burger in Thornton Park! I've also tried and been very impressed with the hot dog, waffle fries, & cheese curds!!! Can't wait to try the cheesesteak. Incredibly helpful and kind staff as well. So nice to order your food and have a drink at Burtons bar while you wait!!! This is a great addition to Thornton Park."},{"name":"Refuge Cafe","address":"155 Brighton Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"It's Sunday morning. I'm hungry, lady friend is near death post dance-off pants-off kinda eve. What's the right answer? Takeout. I haven't dropped by this corner since the good ol' days of Allston cafe when I was partial to their breakfast burrito. When in Rome. I rocked the nostalgia hoping for a solid burrito and then asked the pivotal question: what's right for a bedridden friend? I took a shot in the dark ordering the recommended sandwich and was solidly pleased. Two round pieces of crispy bacon, two eggs, a healthy portion of avocado and spicy mayo on nice wheat toast. It was zesty and made me a believer. The burrito held up its side of the equation as well - stuffed to the brim with sausage, cheese, peppers, onions and the taste of pure kindness. Honestly, rock this corner spot out. Free wifi makes it a spot to spend an afternoon."},{"name":"House of Louie","address":"331 NW Davis St","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"House of Louie is one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in Portland and is based in Chinatown.
