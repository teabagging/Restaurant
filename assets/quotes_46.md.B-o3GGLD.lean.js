Sad. Sad. I am so very sad. First, please allow me to set the stage. CIs has been a favorite bar of mine for many many years! I have gone out of my way for the music and very good food. My husband & I had our first date there 7 years ago. We decided we wanted to hear Lisa Mann a few weeks ago, so we dressed up to go dancing. We were there for many hours, enjoying the music and having beverages. The waitress appeared rude from the get go. I didn't think it was necessarily directed towards us or about us. But maybe. She never denied us drinks, nor indicated we were over doing it. My husband tends to be on the loud side, especially as he enjoys adult beverages. We were never rude, disrespectful or in anyway inappropriate. We had just ordered food to go, as we were wrapping up our even...when the waitress SNAPPED. She ran up to our table chest bumping my husband, screaming & spitting in his face all the while pointing her finger within a hair of his face. She screamed that we needed to leave \\"HER\\" bar now. And that we were \\"NOT GOING TO ACT LIKE THAT IN HER BAR!\\" We were so stunned, we didn't know what to do. We hadn't \\"done\\" anything! She had rallied 4 regulars to come up behind her that had postured themselves for this confrontation. My husband is a big man. When a 6'4\\" African-American man stands up angered by this treatment, all hell breaks loose. As it would when anyone is falsely being accused of something they hadn't done.  We still don't get what happened. The waitress accused my husband of calling her a bitch, which NEVER happened. But who are the police going to believe the solo black guy in a white community bar, hardly. Or the white tweeker waitress & her loyal regulars? I know what you must be thinking? There are 2 sides to every story. I get that. And probably that this couldn't be as simple as stated above. It really was!! My husband was wronged! I never expected treatment such as that from Tualatin. Shame on you. So very disappointed in one of my most favorite bars, in all of this area has done such an injustice.

No, but it's remarkably better than Villa Pizza in Johnstown, has a more extensive menu, dine-in seating, a fountain soda machine, and a cooler containing Resch's cakes! Also worth mentioning are the prices - very, very reasonable. The food and the interior has changed very little from when I was a kid, and I appreciate that. Admittedly, part of my four star rating is because I love the nostalgia factor. I have many happy childhood memories from here. It's also nice that I can take my son here for dinner and not break the bank. Also a big plus that there are other options on the menu besides pizza and subs.

We were quite disappointed by the service. We ordered several dishes to start but the dishes were served one at a time with 10 minutes in between. It was ridiculous! We ended up with one dish on the lazy susan making its rounds between 10 people for about 10 minutes before the next one was brought out.. then another dish. 10 minutes later, another dish. It was a painful and unbelievably slow service. Finally they brought out the main entrees after 45 minutes later.

While driving to our new house back in August, I noticed that something was going into this location and it wasn't until a few weeks after that that a sign went up to tell us exactly what it was.  \\n\\nBurger joints are becoming a dime a dozen in areas like Somerville but the 'burbs NEED places like this.  Simple, fresh ingredients in a casual setting with great service to boot.  All of these things happen with Woo-burgah and I'm happy to now call this our go-to burger joint.  \\n\\nMy only complaint is the two doors, one that will drop you off right in front of the ordering counter and the other leaves you in a confusing spot.  I figured it out fairly quickly on our first visit but I tend to see so many customers confused about what to do.  Sit down for table service?  No, I don't think that ever happens.  Funnel customers in to a queue line better somehow.  Everything else about the place is great, they have 1950'ish d√©cor, complete with the vinyl, two-toned seats.  The service has been outstanding, friendly greetings and everyone seems competent and knowledgeable.  \\n\\nI can't remember if I'm asked how I want the burger cooked or not but it has always been juicy and flavorful, never dry.  I have gotten the wu-sauce on my burger every time and don't think I can have it any other way.  Forget bacon, I just want to bathe in this stuff.  It's a lot like the Golden Arches (tm) Special Sauce (tm) but you know....better because it doesn't have 30 ingredients in it.  The waffle fries here are an added bonus over your typical shoe strings, always crispy and perfectly seasoned.  Get the cheese on them, in my humble opinion.  \\n\\nNot only are they our local burger place now but we have also stopped in for the Richardson's frappes, spectacular on a warm day.  I think they have about 15-20 flavors to choose from and I like that you can get combos in the frappes themselves.

I forgot his name, but he was GREAT. He was attentive, cordial, and genuinely great all around. \\n\\nThe pear cocktail that was recommended was delish! The bf agreed as well even though he isn't really into alcohol. This is a must have under the cocktail section if you're digging something sweet. It was sweet, but not like candy sweet btw. \\n\\nWe ordered the kangaroo as the appetizer. This was delish: medium rare that was juicy and tasty. It was the most exotic on the menu and a pretty good portion size for sharing. \\n\\nThe bf chose the fish and grits (simply put). It was good. The grits tasted ordinary without the fish, but with this combo, it was good. It's sort of like shrimp and grits twist. The portion size was decent as well. \\n\\nI chose the pork. Mine was a tad over salted, and I am usually the person to complain that something isn't seasoned enough. The underlying hash brown looking items was good as well. It was good nonetheless, but I wished they could have provided an accompanying side to offset the pork's saltiness. The entr√©e was good regardless, and I would recommend it.\\n\\nFor dessert, we finished it off with the popcorn ice cream. I thought it was going to be one measly scoop, but it came out in a tall ice cream cup that had \\"Happy Anniversary\\" written on it. Way to go in making our sort of anniversary date great. The caramelized popcorn that accompanied the ice cream gave the sweet ice cream a different taste. \\n\\nI heard there is a garden out back for browsing, but the cold weather coupled with the drizzly rain didn't permit us to a browse.

Little acts like that by a server can make such a huge difference in a guest's opinion of a restaurant.\\n\\nI had the 2 piece white meat but substituted potato salad for slaw. My husband had the tenders. We were both blown away! Chicken was crunchy, juicy, and so tasty. I am a fan of spicy foods, and although this chicken includes cayenne in its recipe, I barely noticed it. The tenders, Rah said, were a little less spicy, and my husband really liked them. All the side dishes were very good, too.\\n\\nWe met the owner/manager, Billy, who was just lovely. He was so pleased that we were so happy with our first visit and that it will definitely not be our last!\\n\\nThe only change I'd make is to the napkins.

One time I drove around to see what was going on inside since no orders were being taken for 15 minutes with 4+ cars in the drive-thru and one lady was sweeping with earphones in... not even paying attention or helping with orders or food.

It is just when the first thing that happens is waiting as the two front of house members have no system in place for new guests.Other than a sign that say's \\"Wait to be seated even at the bar.\\" This would be okay in a bustling establishment with patrons taking up place and needing reservations or even busy night of walk ins. \\n\\nBut this was not as it had more of a quality of a morgue with the quiet not so happy faces of the customers eating and half the establishment empty. All of this is concerning but not unusual so I trudged on. From here things did the usual Portland thing of being adequate but not good. Be it the appetizer that had gravy that looked more white vomit on cheap frozen fries.\\n\\nThe gravy wasn't a really nice creamy sausage or white country gravy that usually comes with gravy fries that adorn menus through out the South. This would be okay if it wasn't covered in paprika to try and mask the bland under peppered and salted gravy. To the fore mentioned frozen French fries that where not even salted before being drenched in the vomit gravy. \\n\\nSadly because of the gravy situation on the fries I had the pleasure of having it again a few minutes later with the mashed potatoes that came with my fried chicken dinner. Which mind you was odd to me. When I see fried chicken on a menu that does not detail boneless chicken. I expect bone in chicken well folks Sckavone's does not do that. They do have listed a boneless chicken option as well.\\n\\nSo maybe this is a oversight or just bad menu planning. But needless to say that was a disappointment. The second part of this sad mess was the chicken was over cooked dry and barely palatable. Hoping for a reprieve from something I tried the mixed veggies. Which not only made me ask for some herbs and butter. But also some talent in the kitchen as this was sad on multiple fronts. Be it in the flavor to how some parts where soggy and others totally fine. As if they have a container that they reheat the veggies in or keep them warm and add to them as the day goes.\\n\\nEither which I couldn't enjoy them. Now we get to the potatoes which where just plain no salt, pepper, barely milk and butter potatoes. That as Southern girl I felt truly insulted as these where not only disgusting they had the vomit gravy that did not help at all. My wife's meal was only different in not having the crappy gravy and getting a meatloaf that was decent. \\n\\nNot great as it was more Italian with a marinara sauce on top and presented with American sides like the aforementioned potatoes and mixed veggies. In this case its a total lack of food knowledge. This meal would be so much better with a side salad and spaghetti. As it would play on the fun nature that you have already started. Could even call it New Age Spaghetti and Meatballs. \\n\\nWith that said the meatloaf was the only thing I enjoyed and even then it was not to great. I do not know about their breakfast and brunch food and deals. I can honestly say to stay away for their dinner as you can get better from your kitchen and a little help from a oven a packed meals."},{"name":"The Hawthorne","address":"500A Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"My husband and I don't go as often as we did when we lived in Fenway, but it's an amazing cocktail bar with great small plates.

I would have preferred to have been charged $145 for the meal in advance--it seemed a bit petty to charge for tea and coffee during the meal although if i ordered alcohol, I'd have understood the additional charge.

The service has been great every time I've gone. \\n\\nThe first time I came to visit Canoe was with my boyfriend for our anniversary, and we had reservations which probably weren't necessary because our anniversary was on a Sunday, and there was plenty of seating. The table we were seated at wasn't very secluded for a romantic dinner (we were seated in the middle isle underneath what felt like spotlights), but we're not really ones to complain so we just decided to make the best of our evening. That is not why I'm giving them 3 stars though. It almost pains me to give them 3 stars because the staff is so friendly, and they were nice enough to write \\"happy anniversary\\" on our dessert, but unfortunately the food was just not up to par. Their menu does have quite a few unique dishes, and we decided to try the kangaroo loin. That wasn't too terrible, but it tasted very gamy and it was very chewy. I felt like I really had to chew it for a good while in order to get it down. As for the entrees, I suppose it's my fault for not venturing out too much, but I really wanted a steak (because who doesn't love steak, am I right?) I decided to order the NY strip, and unfortunately there wasn't much to the NY strip, but again that could be my fault for not venturing out and trying something different. My boyfriend ordered the pheasant, and honestly I think the pheasant may have just saved this review because it was the one thing that we have had there that was quite delicious. It had all the right flavors, and it was very tender. We ordered the creme brulee for dessert, and again they were so kind as to write \\"happy anniversary\\" when it was brought out. The creme brulee was nice, but honestly I've had better. It wasn't as creamy as others that I've had, but again it wasn't too bad.\\n\\nOur second visit was with friends from out of town for brunch. Again, the service was excellent, but unfortunately my thoughts on the food did not change. Because my boyfriend and I generally share our meals when we go out, so I decided to get something more along the lines of breakfast, and he got something more along the lines of lunch. I got the breakfast platter (I believe it's called the Riverside), and it comes with bacon, scrambled eggs, hash browns, and french toast. It was just your typical breakfast platter, so it's really hard to mess that up in my opinion. It's nothing out of the ordinary, so there's not much to share about it. My boyfriend ordered the duck and beef burger. Let me tell you---I've never had a greasier burger in my life. For such a pricey burger, I honestly would have expected so much more. The bottom bun was pretty much soaked with grease, so it was spongy, and it felt uncomfortable to eat. I've honestly had a better burger at Farm Burger for half the price. \\n\\nAs far as parking goes, it is valet only, so I would keep that in mind if you're someone like me who never carries cash on them.\\n\\nSo overall, I would say the food is just OK, but very overpriced for what the quality of the food you're getting.

My husband and I went last night and were very disappointed.  Our first waitress was great, very attentive.  We usually order the Angus burger but we both decided to try the fish and ships.  Should have stuck with the burger.  The batter was very thick and heavy and had no flavor at all.  The fish inside was lukewarm.  Usually, with fish and chips, the fish is very hot since it has been deep fried.  Would not order again.  Our waitress said she was leaving and intro'd us to our new waitress.  We ordered another beer and it was served quickly.....but then we never saw our waitress again.  We tried to get her attention a few times for our check but didn't succeed.  Finally, we saw the hostess and she brought our check and cashed us out.  The worst part about the whole evening was we reeked like smoke when we left. I was wearing a suit jacket that I had just picked up from the cleaners.  Today it still smells like smoke.

Really good. Beef bulgogi noodle soup. Incredibly flavourful and aromatic soup and beef, along the lines of Pearl Castle's signature beef noodle. 5 stars.\\n\\nDeep fried pork cutlet (big don katsu, #28). Huge; 2 pork cutlets instead of 1; well cooked (fried) with bbq sauce drizzled on each slice. rice was good (not over or under cooked), but could've used a sauce for the rice. Still, double the portion for about $2 more than the typical don katsu; both cutlets were high quality meat with no fat or gristle. The fries and salad (like Asian cole slaw) were also good. The fries, fresh and crispy, were great dipped into the vinaigrette for the seafood pancake. \\nOverall 4.25, but 5 star bang for the buck.\\n\\nKorean seafood pancake (#14). Tastes exactly how we expect a seafood pancake to taste; also as oily as we expect. 4 stars.\\n\\nOverall, would definitly come back. 1st impression: 8.9/10, 4.5 stars.

It was funny to look around and see people using their iPhone flashlights. Also seems you'd want to add more light to appreciate the food artistry and presentation. Or maybe I just need learn how to see better at night, haha. \\n\\nOtherwise wow, the food. And the service too - honestly I expected the staff to be elitist but our server was so warm and friendly and I deeply appreciated that he was able to adjust to add an extra half order for the dishes that had just 2 pieces since we were a party of 3.\\n\\nSPICY TUNA CRISPY RICE - $18 (5 pcs)\\nSpicy tuna sits on a bed of crispy sushi rice, and topped w/ a tiny jalapeno slice. Great starter, loved the combo of spicy and crunchy. For this app, our server was kind enough to add a 6th piece for our party of 3.\\n\\nCHUTORO NIGIRI - $16 (2 pcs) ... plus $8 for one more\\nI knew I wanted to order the Otoro ... something to melt in my mouth. Our server recommended I try the Chutoro instead b/c it's not something I can always get -- it's a medium fatty tuna and yep, melted in my mouth. \\n\\nSAKE AIOLI NIGIRI - $14 (2 pcs) ... plus $7 for one more\\nCured Scottish salmon with garlic aioli, lime, caviar, and cracked pepper. They recommended we eat in one bite and no soy sauce. Whoa explosion of flavor in my mouth. Definitely no extra saltiness needed. Yum.\\n\\nHURRICANE ROLL - $20 (8 pcs)\\nAhh this was a good choice among the rolls. Spicy salmon and cucumber topped with salmon, yellowtail, and avocado. Filling too :)\\n\\nGRILLED BLACK COD MISOYAKI - $29 (3 oz)\\nFrom the Yelp reviews, I knew I wanted to try the black cod or sea bass - we went for the black cod. Oh wow, fish was so good and the sauce was yummy ... on the sweet side in case you don't like sweet. I love sweet. However a very long gap in time waiting for this cod -- our server said this dish takes a long time to prepare. Also ordered a little bowl of white rice ... haha can't believe they charge for white rice ($4).\\n\\nLOBSTER TOBAN-YAKI - $32\\nThe Yelp reviews also raved about this one - what a great finish to our evening. Also something different from all the sushi. The lobster chunks are already cooked and then then they spread this garlic/soy/lemon butter on the hot plate and then the lobster chunks soak in this beautiful yummy sauce and stays really hot b/c of the flame below. What a delicious treat - may be my favorite dish of the evening!\\n\\nOverall enjoyed trying the different dishes. Next time I'd like to try one of the Omakase, Anago (sea eel) and Chilean Sea Bass Yu-An Yaki. \\n\\nFYI valet is $10 but $2 if you get your ticket validated by UMI.

The sweet potato waffles weren't overly sweet and the perfect compliment to the chicken. My only complaint is that the waffles came out about 5-8 minutes before the chicken, so they lost any crispiness since they sat in maple syrup while we waited for the chicken to come out of the kitchen. The stuffed corn cakes were the biggest surprise and hit of the meal. It's their skillet cornbread that is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a rhubarb jam for a tartness (please add more of this) and a house-made ricotta that had a nice, mild flavor and smooth texture.

We were told it would be a 30-40 minutes wait, too late to eat and still get to he theatre in time, but we happened upon a table in the bar that was just being vacated by a very nice young couple ... we're in!\\n\\nI ordered a Clearly An Imperial Ale (IBU 70, ABV 6.7 - $5.75), but was not particularly hoppy about the snifter it came in.

DRAT!\\n\\nWe decided on an IPA Pretzel, coming with melted Monterey Jack Cheese Sauce and Black Butte Porter Stone Ground Mustard ($10.50) as an appetizer. The pretzel was piping hot, straight out of the oven, crispy outside and soft inside, but the cheese sauce was lukewarm and a bit of a bummer.\\n\\nI tried to order another beer before our meals arrived, having asked three servers that had come by over a ten minute period to drop off the pretzel, fill our waters, and so on, but they all told me I had to wait for the bar staff. About 10 minutes later, a male server finally came by with another snifter half-full of the same IPA, but I told him that I had planned to order their Extrafjordinary Porter ($6.25). He took the IPA back, giving me a strange look as if the faux pas was somehow my fault. The porter arrived a few minutes later and everything was copacetic.\\n\\nI ordered the Pub Burger w/ Bacon and Garlic Fries ($18.25) and my wife the Black Butte Porter Mac & Cheese ($15.75). My burger was quite tasty, coming on a toasted brioche bun along with a side of fries covered with garlic sauce and an unknown grated cheese. The fries were also lukewarm and the garlic sauce a tad chilly, another QC problem and the third (cold pretzel sauce and wrong beer) in our short time there. My wife's Mac & Cheese came with some very odd looking pasta and there was hardly enough cheese sauce to coat the pasta. The presentation was OK, but there were drops of extra cheese sauce scattered around the rim of the bowl. It was also extremely bland with not enough sauce and very little flavor - QC problem #4. The server was nice enough to remove the Mac & Cheese from our bill, a very nice gesture, after we told him about the lack of flavor in the dish.\\n\\nThe ambiance of the large room was quite pleasant, reminiscent of the Pacific Northwest with lots of carved oak, open doorways, tall windows, and old photos and paintings on the walls. We had a decent meal and enjoyed the space, but the problems and positives resulted in a zero sum outcome and a very middle of the road rating from me.\\n\\nCombatCritic Gives Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House 5 Bombs Out Of 10 ...

The fish was moist, but the batter was flavorless, and I learned that Gaffer's doesn't use salt in any of their food.  I also think that the oil could have been just a wee bit hotter, in order to crisp the batter while keeping the fish moist.\\nCole slaw:  Hmmm.  I put a fork in it, and strings of mucilage were pervasive.  I'm a biologist, and my first thought was that this was microbial filaments.  I tasted it, but there was nothing wrong with the slaw, except it had no flavor at all.  I did a bit of research, and here is what I currently think:  Gaffer's is trying to make its food as healthy as possible, so no trans fats, no salting, and I'm sure there are other efforts; I applaud them.  I did find that when one works to remove fat from mayonnaise, one addition is chia mucilage to give it proper mouthfeel.  I'm guessing those strings of mucilage came from chia seeds.

I always like to try something new when I go, so this time I tried the BLT Benedict on gluten free bread. My bacon was burnt and my poached eggs were poached hard, not smooth and runny like I expect with a Benedict. Two other guests at my table ordered the new carnitas cornbread bowl, which looked delicious, fresh, colorful and abundant in the photo on the app. What they got was a sad looking bowl of beans with burnt cornbread and rotten Pico. The lime crema and cotija cheese were nonexistent, and to top it off, one guest's eggs were poached hard as well. \\n\\nWe all agreed we didn't want to send anything back because we had been there for a while and we were starving, but we did mention the overcooked eggs to the server.  When we brought it up, her response was \\"yea the eggs can be tricky.\\" Not an apology, just an excuse blaming the eggs. It's a breakfast place, the eggs should be the #1 thing you get right! We asked for new eggs, but the server she said she would have to take the whole meal back and have it remade. We said we were ok if she could just bring a side of eggs and her response was, \\"well it'll be a while.\\" I don't understand why it would take a while to recook eggs that were served incorrectly and then be reluctant to redo them. There was just no attempt to recover or correct the situation, which was more annoying than the messed up food. \\n\\nRegardless, after the last few experiences and especially this one, I think we'll be checking out one of the many other breakfast spots in the area.

Worst pho soup base I ever tasted. You know why? TOO much star anise! Overwhelmed the soup taste. The noodles and other ingredients were fine BUT the defining characteristic of any good pho is their soup base and Pho 2000 failed. The biggest tip off is that the viet locals that were already eating there, were only ordering the fried catfish and 7 course beef. None of the locals eating at that time ordered any pho at all which should have been a signal.\\nThe final nail in the coffin is the overcharge on our bill. Either Pho 2000 didn't update their menu or they are adding ~$1 - 0.50 on everything just because. Please see attached photo. Its very dishonest if business menu prices don't reflect what they charge consumers. They added $ to every noodle we ordered.

Traffic was a little tricky as to be expected and desire living in Buckhead, Umi was a little tricky to find. The GPS does not warn you to turn right off of Peachtree to get to the valet parking (shared with chops, $2) but if you miss it you can take the next right and cut through. Maybe try throwing Chops in the GPS. Not sure of that's better.\\n\\nAnyway, we arrived to Umi at 6:25pm and were greeted and seated promptly. It was pretty dark (hence the bad quality pics) but I liked the vibe. It was good for a birthday dinner date with my fiance. I will say the tables for 2 were pretty close together and even bring a size 2 I had to squeeze into the booth. I did see a much larger gentleman try to get out and the neighboring table had to move their table so he could get by. Awkward.\\n\\nThe service was great, I didn't catch their names but we had a very pleasant and attentive woman and man taking care of us. They were very knowledgeable with the menu and asked our preferences to make sure we would like what we ordered (\\"do you like ginger, this has a strong ginger taste\\" etc. We ordered the spicy tuna crispy rice, seared diver scallops, rock shrimp tempura, hurricane roll, and the lobster crunch box. Everything was so amazing. The fish tasted fresh and I loved all the flavors they used. We devoured it all and were very impressed.\\n\\nFor dessert we had the chocolate bento box which was a molten chocolate cake with green tea ice cream. They even threw a candle on top for my birthday. The cake was amazing. I think the phrase that came out of my fiance mouth was something like \\"this is like eating a cloud\\" because it was so light and airy. Not too sweet either which I appreciate since I don't eat many sweets.\\n\\n I think Umi is worth the money.

Anyways, I came in tonight and ordered the calamari and some chicken trio plate. The 3 pieces of chicken were each about the size of a McDonald's hamburger patty. The first of the 3 was dried out, but I ate it. I started eating the 2nd one and it was dried out, so I stopped after 2 little bites. The 3rd was dried out too, so I stopped after one bite. I ate the pasta and pushed the plate away. The server came over and asked if I wanted a box. I said no. It's too dried out to eat. For $25 dollars for some small pieces of chicken, it shouldn't be dried out. The taste wasn't even anything special. I'd even venture to say it was sub par. She asked if I wanted something else. I said no. 2 other tables were complaining about their food, so I didnt have faith in getting something that's worth eating. She said how about free dessert? I said no. The woman in front of me didn't even eat her dessert after she ordered it. I saw the server take away a plate from their table with what looked like an entire piece of dessert. The calamari was ok, but again, sub par and very very small pieces, mostly breaded crumbs with little meat in it. The Caesar salad was swimming in dressing. The pasta was, again, also sub par.

Bryant M. told me I'd like their bacon so I didn't ask for it to be left off my turkey sandwich, but it was way overcooked and almost burnt so i picked off the crumbled mess as best I could and Steven S. added it to his sandwich because that doesn't bother him.

It's wonderfully decorated. The menu looks fantastic, and it has a lot of history. \\n\\n The service is less than stellar however. As well as the food usually comes out cold . It's a fairly high priced restaurant. But, I feel like they just want to push alcohol on everyone. \\n The first time we tried it, we were a party of five. We did  have to ask for drink refills and coffee refills. But, the food was warm and very good.\\n Ever since that time and the food has just been OK. Except the last time. My clam chowder soup was room temperature cold, not even warm and even my doughnut burger had been left to sit where it was cold when they brought it out to me .\\n\\n20 Minutes later when the server came back to ask you how your food was and you tell them it's all cold. He looked at me like it Is supposed  to be cold ?  He did offer to send it back to heat it. But, never let food out of your sight once you have to return it.\\n Why did any of it come out cold, to begin with? \\n So no thank you ,I would just like it to go. 15 minutes later when he came back with a To Go box, I have now wasted over an hour in the restaurant and still really hadn't eaten anything but,a few bites because everything was cold.\\nThis Place could be really spectacular and fun.

It had the modern, open kitchen (and fireworks view)of California Grill, combined with the sophistication of a non-Disney steakhouse that we love in the Bull and Bear. \\n\\nWe looked forward to our reservation for weeks. And the meal started off wonderfully -craft cocktails on the terrace, watching fireworks at the Magic Kingdom. Our appetizers were delicious. Sadly, the meal fell flat on its face after that. \\n\\nMy husband ordered the ribeye, the ala carte price is $69. The cut of steak he got was worse than Outback. He ordered it medium, and it came out bloody rare on the inside. Our server agreed, it was under-cooked and of course took it for correction. I hate when faced with this dilemma -eat my entree while it's hot, or wait for him? I decided to eat my fish, which was superb. But since the side dishes were shared, by the time his steak returned to the table, our side dishes were cold. And his steak? Ugh. I'm not exaggerating, it was more than 50% gristle. We realize a rib eye isn't a lean cut, but this was nothing but gristle. At $69, they should be ashamed. \\n\\nIn full disclosure, they comped our dessert -one small shared order of churros. But we weren't looking for free food, we would have gladly paid for quality, which sadly we didn't receive.\\n\\nAs a follow up, I had requested that a manager call us the next day. I requested this through Open Table, where we had made our reservation, and also by calling the restaurant directly.  No one has reached out to us.  I can only conclude that Capa cares more about their captive audience of hotel guests, vs locals that might actually return if the experience were better.\\n\\nIf this review were based only on my husband's steak, and the lack of response from the restaurant, it would be one star.  The extra star in this case is for the appetizers, drinks, and atmosphere of the restaurant.  The steak should have never been served, but I realize mistakes happen.  The lack of follow up, however, is inexcusable."},{"name":"Bar Louie Polaris","address":"1611 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"Just ordered the California club.

Great to see him and he's given me a heads up on all the good stuff. Good time so far. \\nWell the California club was outstanding the chicken was nice and thick and the bacon was a nice touch along with the condiments. The french fries were nice and I like how they come in the little cup. My experience has found that when you put fries in a tin cup they stay hot much longer. Plus what's cool about it you can put ketchup down amongst them. An the long toothpick they stick the club sandwich together with can be used as a skewer to get your french fries. That way you don't get ketchup all over your fingers. There are several burger selections n a seafood selection I want to try next. Lots of good drinks here and the menu was nice.  Food I think is reasonably priced compared to similar style restaurants.  Bartenders were great and attentive.  I would definitely recommend this place whether it's for happy hour with half-price drinks and really reasonable appetizers or a nice dinner or lunch even if it is worth checking out.

It sounds funny, but I honestly just wanted to go somewhere for onion rings. So when I saw these delicious beauties come out, I was super excited. The batter to onion ratio was excellent and I loved how crispy they were. One of the best onion rings I've had. \\n\\nMy boyfriend's meal was overall okay. He thought the burger was good. Nothing extraordinary but a good burger that you can't complain about. Very big portions, so he couldn't finish it! One of the biggest complaints of the whole night was the coleslaw.

It is so clear that they are trying to be a fancier version of Olive Garden but its just not working. \\n\\nCustomer Service\\nI don't really have anything good or bad to say in this regard. It was average. \\n\\nFood\\nI had chicken Alfredo with a side of garlic broccoli. Let me tell you, I have  never seen such plain white chicken in my entire life (okay i have, I know some Karen's but still...) add some pepper at the bare minimum.  It was so unfavorable and while not terrible dry, because it didn't have any seasoning it felt like a task to chew it. The pasta itself was cooked alright, it was little squishy but nothing horrible. The Alfredo source itself was also very unflavorful, though better than the chicken. It was okay once you put tons of parmesan  cheese  but just barely. \\n\\nThe broccoli was the only thing on my plate that had been seasoned at all, though not enough garlic, just a lot of salt. \\n\\nAt the end of my meal I had chocolate cake for dessert and that was fine. It certainly wasn't the best piece of cake I've ever had but no complaints.\\n\\nPrice\\nHonestly the food was bad so automatically its going to feel overprice.

A few lots you can park in as well.\\n\\nWe got: \\n\\nKimchi scallion pancake(2/5)- this wasn't so crispy compared to other ones I've had before.

While it was refreshing, I wouldn't order this again. Waiting staff didn't give us scissors to cut the noodles either...\\n\\nBibim-bap (2/5)- nothing to write home about. It was a good size portion, but lacked a lot of flavor. \\n\\nStir-fried kimchi with pork (3/5): flavorful with a lot of sauce, but not a lot of pork.

Not vegetarian friendly since I only saw one vegetarian roll on the menu, unless they take special requests. Must make a reservation!! \\n\\nParking/Location: After reviewing yelp reviews we realized you can park across Chopt in the parking lot. I believe there was a sign that said no parking from 10pm-6am (maybe). They do offer valet also. The restaurant is located at the end of the strip and easy to miss. \\n\\nAmbience/Service: We had a reservation and were seated right away. Initially, we had this table with a wall directly next to me. After sitting for 5 minutes, I had to ask to change tables because it was too claustrophobic for me. Tables are very close to each other so be prepared for major eavesdropping. The overall ambience is romantic and upscale. Service overall was phenomenal. You get a new plate after each item. I think we got about 3-4 new plates! Overall staff was all very friendly and helpful. \\n\\nFood/Drinks: We started off with their hot house sake and it was deliciousness!! We ordered two appetizers, the yellowtail jalape√±o and the spicy tuna rice. However, we got the tuna carpaccio instead of the yellowtail jalape√±o. We both took a bite and were amazed at the flavor of the dish but realized it was tuna and not yellowtail so we informed our waitress. She obviously corrected the problem pretty quickly and we realized we should've kept the tuna dish! Haha! The yellowtail jalape√±o was light and fresh tasting but we enjoyed the tuna a bit more. The spicy rice tuna was pretty good when dipped in soy sauce and siracha. It had a unique texture to it since the rice is fried on the outside but overall a good app to try. The menu is very extensive from nigiri, sashimi, to house rolls and specialty rolls. We ordered the hurricane/American tuna roll/ and the shrimp tempura roll. They were all very good and each roll had a unique taste. One thing about this place...the fish is fresh and I'm not a fan of fresh fish sometimes because it taste too fishy. But this place knows how to make a good sushi roll! We stuck to sake so did not get to explore much of the drink menu. \\n\\nCheck your tab--they charged us for the tuna carpaccio even though we did not order it. \\n\\nIt is probably the freshest sushi with the right flavor combinations but on the pricey side.

Still, it's worth it!\\n\\nEach dish is made for sharing, so bring your friends. Items on the menu range between $5 to $10 I believe, the average is about $8 a plate. I suggest ordering as you go. For example, order 3 dishes to start with and then go from there. The food looks small on the plate, but it's pretty filling. We ordered the Korean twice fried chicken, pad Thai, roti canai, Singaporean chili soft crab, and the mango sticky rice. Korean fried chicken and roti canai were our favorites. Roti canai is a must if you go here. The curry dipping sauce is so unique and unlike any curry that I've had. \\n\\nA lot of yummy southeast Asian, Korean, and Cantonese style food on the menu. My goal is to master their whole menu. I'm serious.

It's so cool!\\n\\nI accidentally came here a few weeks ago on a Sunday afternoon with my best friend and my mother after I realized Licha's Cantina was closed.  I was sad because I really wanted my mom to try that watermelon jalape√±o margarita at Licha's.  However, my sadness was short-lived after a nice lady suggested we try The Tamale House instead.  I remembered driving by it a bunch of times so I knew just where to go.  We arrived shortly after leaving Licha's, and it just felt right outside.  It's like the only place on East 6th with a FOR REAL parking lot since Nuevo Le√≥n went away.  It's just really attractive, and I feel like they have a new and cool sign.  Once inside, guess what.  Still felt right!  If they offered table service I would have given this place five stars, but they don't.  They have great service anyhow, but it's just a tad casual.  No matter!  Great tacos!!!!  Drinks??  They may not have a fancy drink menu, but the bartender can make ANYTHING awesome.  For instance I was like \\"Uh can you do like a skinny margarita??\\"  Yeah I'm that girl...  The answer was yes.  The answer was yes, and also, they made the margarita spicy at my request.  They also added a chile/ salt rim at my request.  I love you.

A different female bartender with white hair was as rude as they come. When I asked if they had hot food she instantly got an attitude. Not sure why that was a hard or unreasonable question. When I told her I just wanted something hot like soup because it was cold she tossed a menu at me and said very rudely. Umm I bet you can probably find hot on here and walked away to make our drinks.

This was prepared differently than the other versions.  I can't say that I was a fan.  Parts were good, but I just didn't care for those flavors together.  I ate one ravioli and a couple bites of rabbit.  $30 wasted.  Since the very first time I went to Canoe, I have raved about their rabbit.  I won't be doing that again, unless I am reminiscing about how good it used to be.  \\n\\nMy friend had the trout and substituted the sides for potatoes and spinach.

We went in on a weeknight, shortly after it had first opened for business.  The place looks small from the outside, and even smaller inside.  Seeing as it was new to the area, it was rather crowded, but the people moved quickly.  One thing Apopka definitely has is a few good local choices for breakfast (Robinsons comes to mind). \\n\\nI'll give Waffle House credit, they worked hard and fast, but there were quite a few inexperienced servers there due to it just opening.  It was very clean, the cleanest I have ever seen a Waffle House, but I did notice that there were signs that things could get messy quickly.  Being open 24 hours a day is a big plus, but the waffle maker looked like it had already worked 24 straight hours, as waffle batter was all over the place.  \\n\\nOverall, I can't say I'd choose this over other breakfast options in Apopka, but for the convenience of a 24 hour a day dine in restaurant, it fits the bill.  I would also add that even though prices seemed fairly low, the overall expense was a bit higher than expected.  I guess getting those hash browns loaded up will do that to you."},{"name":"Waffle House","address":"5565 Northside Dr","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I'm normally anti Waffle House but this location is clean!

The restaurant has valet parking and is located in a courtyard right next door  to the restaurant, Atlas. Umi has an intimate dining space with a bar area and sushi bar seating, as well. The quality of the sushi at Umi is some of the best I have ever had. One thing to keep in mind is that Umi cares so much about the quality of the food that they are giving to customers that they do not allow take out or containers for leftovers. Therefore, make sure to order what you are sure you can eat in the restaurant and do not rely on taking food home. I appreciate Umi's emphasis on ensuring the quality of their food is always upheld. \\n\\nThings I like: The quality of the sushi at Umi is absolutely incredible. I have never had a bad dish here. For appetizer you must order the Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice, it is so delicious and unique to Umi. Definitely a customer favorite and worth a try. I have also enjoyed the Nigiri Samplers (they have 8 and 12 piece options) and the Typhoon Roll is also delicious. You cannot go wrong with any sushi dishes that they have. The desserts at Umi are also great and my personal favorite is the Green Tea Souffl√©. However, you need to call before you go to Umi to reserve many of their desserts. Make sure to do this if you are interested in any of their specialty dessert dishes! Additionally, I enjoy how easy it is to make a reservation for Umi on Open Table. \\n\\nThings I didn't like: Umi definitely has quality sushi, but it also adds up on the check. However, I do think the quality of the sushi is worth the price. Umi's intimate environment also makes it a bit of tight seating between tables and this also makes the restaurant rather loud. Additionally, there is no self-parking available at Umi and you must valet park your car. \\n\\nOverall, Umi is my favorite spot for sushi in Atlanta and although it is pricey, it is very worth it to me.

But there's always option to have it less sweet by a percentage. I interchangeably go for that for the avocado taro smoothie if I'm feeling more on the hungry side and need something more filling. What's also really nice about this place is all their drink prices already include a free topping of boba, or even pineapple chunks which is something I'm sure no other place offers.

They do have a walk up counter for beverages, so you can order your coffee and wake up while you wait for your table to be ready.  They just add your drink to your table order once you are seated.  The iced toddy was incredible and I was at an all time caffeinated high once we were seated at the bar to order our food.  It was great to see all the action taking place behind the bar.  The servers are friendly, but worker bees, they have everything down to a science and it's definitely hard at the bar to get their attention as they are so focused on their tasks.  Once you order, the food comes out at super speed.  I had the scrambler, and it was delicious.  The menu has a lot to choose from, and they have paper menus available for you to review while you wait, so once you are seated you are ready to go.  It's about simple home cooked goodness here, nothing fancy, and actually quite a nice break from all the foodie Austin spots. Your credit card will also agree with you on that point.  While it's not foodie, they do have fresh food, even their Ketchup was all natural - high fructose corn syrup free- awesome touch! My friend comes here often as it's her neighborhood hangout, and they knew her.  She mentioned it's always the same friendly staff.  While they don't have mimosas, they have a lot of love and good food for a good price."},{"name":"K Restaurant","address":"100 Lynn St","city":"Peabody","stars":"5","text":"The kitchen is the cleanest kitchen I ever seen!!!

The first good sign, the door had not closed behind us before we were greeted cheerfully by one of the servers, and a manager(?) / hostess followed in 5 second with menus and a table. We were offered and served coffee right away and our order was taken promptly. I ordered the 2x4, 2 eggs, 2pancakes, 2 slices of bacon and two sausage links. I asked for my bacon extra crispy, as close to burned as possible. It came out very crisp, and I Wes happy, the eggs were perfect, the pancakes were fluffy, yet had some substance, and the sausage flavorful. My friend had the quiche of the day, and was impressed that such was even offered in a neighborhood diner, and he ate every bite, a good sign in itself, but he was still talking about it the next day. All through, service was friendly an efficient, our coffee cups were never empty. The crowd seemed to be largely locals, known to the staff. While no one was seated there, two small tables were set outside the restaurant, one of them had a bowl of water , presumably a dog-friendly gesture.

It will close at the end of May.  Open your arms and say hello to the new EM Gourmet brick and mortar located on Spring Hill Lane in Pflugerville.  Diana Nguyen has finally opened her kitchen.  I don't think Pflugerville will be the same with this lady in town.\\n\\nDiana will still be serving all the things you came to love from her little stand.  Now that her kitchen is open, she will be able to expand her offerings and create more as she goes along.  EM Gourmet isn't just for deserts anymore.  The kitchen is new, and, Diana has lots to do.  Not a challenge for this lady, who started her own business at the age of 12 in a refugee camp in the Philippines. \\n\\nDiana is a focused and driven business person.  While the kitchen is opening and evolving slowly, Diana is planning and strategizing.  She will be focusing more attention to Boba Teas and teaching her love for cooking.  She has a menu that is posted on her website, but, if you go there she will have the daily deals on the chalkboard by the register.  I stopped by today, and, got to have a little one-on-one chat with Diana.  She is a very friendly lady who is more than eager to share her passion of cooking, and, her dream to be successful.\\n\\nOn my visit today I ordered the Vietnamese Rice Crepes with a light fish sauce for dipping.   The crepes were stuffed with pork, black mushrooms and diced onions.  I fell in love with these.  I actually like these more than spring rolls.  Yes, I have a new favorite.  Next, I ordered the house made vegetable pickles.  Lord have mercy!  I would love to buy these by the jar full and take them to work for snacking on.  For my soup I chose the Asparagus Egg Drop.  Definitely the best egg drop soup I've ever had.\\n\\nFor my main course I ordered the three colored rice.  Rice is offered steamed or fried.  I chose fried.  You're probably wondering, what makes this dish three colored?  It's the meat that is skewered and laid on top of the rice.  Chicken, pork, and, shrimp.  Those are the three colors. The fried rice wasn't anything outstanding.  It was simply fried rice, until I poured some of my light fish sauce over it.  That was a neat find.  The meats were tasty and flavorful.  I would definitely do this dish again.  I got all this food for just $14.00!  That's a meal deal!\\n\\nEverything on the menu is under $10 with tax included!  EM Gourmet is also vegan friendly, and, does not use MSG.  The menu for this place is definitely inviting as they have starters that includes some interesting options like curry chicken wings and curry puff chicken.  They also offer a selection of Banh Mi's, dried noodle dishes, and, rice dishes.  Also to be found on the menu are some breakfast options, Vietnamese deserts, coffees, and, teas.\\n\\nDiana plans to hire High School students and mold them into individuals that are creative and talented.  What do I mean?  She wants a staff that can be interactive with her in the kitchen.  She wants to help them think outside the box, and, help her create new ideas for the menu.  Oh to be 18 again!  I would so be filling out my application.  I'm excited for Diana, and, I hope she succeeds.

Walking in it's super cute, but there were maybe only two other tables filled (this was a Friday around 1pm). We were seated fairly quickly, but everything after that was a bit of a mess... I wanted to rate this one star, but felt it would do a little bit of a disservice since the entire experience wasn't completely bad. \\nOur server was nice, though his demeanor was very strange for what I'd typically expect and seemed like he came in running straight from break.. actually felt like maybe the entire staff was on break? From the time we were seated to his arrival felt like an unusual amount of time considering there were maybe two other tables. We put our drink orders in at the same time as our food (plenty of time passed between being sat and placing orders) and it took an HOUR for our food to come out, which is shocking because it was a bowl of bisque, a side of Brussels sprouts, a chicken club sandwich and a flatbread. Lunch shouldn't take an hour just for the food to come out, and rather shocking since 1 hour lunch breaks for most people is pretty standard if not generous. Luckily we weren't on a lunch break and could stand for our time to be wasted. It is also worth mentioning plenty of people take medicines that require food to be eaten with it, otherwise nausea might be experienced. Without diving into details, most people have a certain expectation that food will be arriving at lunchtime within a reasonable window to avoid nausea and City Winery failed to meet that expectation. \\nOnce our food came out, the bisque was served without a spoon, which okay fine people forget things... except no one was to be found to obtain a spoon... got up and found our own spoons at the serving station. All in all the meal with drinks was 100$ and we didn't feel like we got the $100 lunch we paid for. The service was extremely slow and we had to get our own spoons, and conveyed our disappointment in an amicable manner to the manager. She was very nice and offered to compensate a portion. We weren't looking for a handout but it was still nice of her to do. All of us really enjoyed our food once it came, which is why I rated this higher than 1 star. I advise not coming at lunchtime - Atlanta has so many better offerings for lunch bites than City Winery.

After we talked about it, I have kept in touch with her for 9 years- which seems to be a hard thing to do for me these days!  I was in town, and I told her to pick a place where we could eat/catch up.  She suggested H Harper, as she told me it had a great selection of bourbon.\\n\\nThat is all she had to say- was sold on that sole word.  So, off we went.  I saw on the site they had valet, but when I got there- there wasn't any.  But I am totally cool with that.  There was plenty of parking.  I also did not realize this place was right off of the BeltLine as well (which explained the biker and pet friendly patio).  The weather was nice that night, slightly windy, but not cold.  So, we decided to eat outside.  \\n\\nWe got a cocktail menu and food menu to check over, and there was a LOT to go over.  Hell, I don't even think I had a chance to view it all!  I was trying to keep a menu (cmon, you and I both know I wasn't going to only order 1 drink....)- but the waitress damn took it!  Grrr...  After that, I tried to order by memory or just keep asking her what the hell was on the list.

I think I took pics of them...\\n\\nThe pimento cheese was kind of underwhelming.  It was like 4-5 pieces of toast with the spread and some okra.  I mean- I could have eaten like 30 pieces!\\n\\nThe pork then came, and overall it was a pretty solid piece of meat, but I wish it was seasoned just a little more thoroughly.  It did fill me up, however.  My friend swears by the cheeseburger- she says it is her favorite menu item.\\n\\nIt was then time for dessert.  I couldn't pass up on a slice of red velvet (ladies, that's the secret to my heart)- so we got it and shared.  It was pretty decent, but not worth writing home about.  \\n\\nIf you like bourbon and cocktails, this place is worth checking out.

When I returned to the restaurant, a little annoyed, I said that they should probably make some bigger signs that say cash only since a lot of people don't carry cash these days. The owner (I think) came from around back and said the credit card companies charge him too much. I assured him the charge was nothing compared to the atm fee and inconvenience it caused me and he shrugged his shoulders. I then paid for my water and coffee (which had been poured already) and reminded him that the restaurant was empty and he should probably come up with ways to being more people in, not drive them away.

The Groupon voucher redemption was quick and painless, and the server warned us to get ready to be served a lot of food. Despite the warning, we still managed to order two rather large draft beers.\\n\\nA comfortable 10-15 minute wait later, our appies started to come in - deep fried pickles, cornbread with cinnamon honey butter and hush puppies. \\n\\nThe deep fried pickles were interesting for sure - dill pickles (that you typically get with a sandwich) lightly battered and fried. It came with a chipotle aoli. I think the flavour of the dill pickles themselves pretty overwhelmed all the other flavours for me, but the batter was very light and crispy. Large portion (we got like 5).\\n\\nThe cornbread and hush puppies came together. I love corn bread, but this one was just too dry. The butter helped a bit, but it still didn't really quite save it. The hush puppies on the other hand was excellent - they tasted pretty fresh, and I loved the sweet and spicy kick it had.\\nWe tried our best to finish the 2 slices of cornbread and 4 hush puppies.\\n\\nThe meat platter came next while we were playing catchup with the appies. There were pork ribs, brisket, BBQ chicken, and a pulled pork sandwich, as well as navy beans, fries and coleslaw as sides.\\n\\nI'd say that the meats were decent. They all had a smoky flavour to it, but if I were to be honest, they all kind of started to taste the same. I do recall some pieces of meat were a bit dry (probably the brisket).. but the homemade BBQ sauce helped. The chicken was more moist. The pulled pork was ok. The navy beans I thought were really good though.. probably because I tasted cumin in it, and I love cumin! :) The fries were really good too, if not a bit too salty..\\n\\nService was friendly!\\n\\nI'd say for the prices we paid, this restaurant was definitely worth the visit.

Even if you follow a paleo, keto, or simply healthy lifestyle, you can find something on the menu. I had the paleo bowl and was a big fan. This veggie-forward dish was slightly sweet because of the beets, red peppers, and sweet potatoes. The smoked salmon was also SO good and while the dish itself wasn't huge, it had a great amount of salmon! We also got the smoked salmon avocado toast. Again, the portion of salmon was hearty and filling. Squeeze a little lemon on top and it brings out all the great, fresh flavors. \\n\\nOther great things about the place? Parking was easy and free (an Atlanta rarity) and the menu options plentiful. There were many other drinks and food items that I would love to go back and try (Cardamom vanilla latte? Sweet potato spice bowl?). There was also a mix of people working on laptops, people with kids, and people enjoying brunch with friends, so its space and atmosphere are quite versatile. The downside(s)? It's new and popular so seating can be hard to come by during peak hours. It can be a tad pricey, but the quality was overall very good.\\n\\nWith that said, I highly recommend the Cold Brew Bar for the coffee enthusiast!"},{"name":"Nikki Sushi & Steak","address":"15135 SW Barrows Rd, Ste 145","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"My husband and I went on a date here today.

My friend and I came on a weekday afternoon and the restaurant was busy, however, the line moved quick. The restaurant has seating downstairs and upstairs so you can eat in.\\n \\nThe style of the ordering process is similar to Subway's. You order at the front and you follow the food attendant down the \\"assembly line\\" until you reach the cashier at the end. I ordered an Avocado Taco Salad for around $10.50 excluding tax and portion was generous. It was so jampacked that it was hard to reach the ingredients at the bottom of the bowl. I liked how fresh all the ingredients were and you can see them grilling meat in the back so ingredients should be fresh. My salad had cheese, cherry tomatoes, taco chips, grilled chicken, avocado, and mixed vegetables. I really enjoyed the salad. However, I wished the ingredients were more incorporated because the avocado and chicken were deep down at the bottom of the bowl and hard to get to. My taco chips also got a little soggy. My friend built his own salad bowl and although portion looks a little smaller, he equally enjoyed his dish. I only wished the restaurant uses glass cups instead of plastic cups for sit in diners. \\n \\nThis is one place in downtown that I will definitely return to if I want a healthy lunch!"},{"name":"Grainmaker","address":"248 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I ordered the chicken taco which was good.

I then grabbed some of the complimentary water (thanks), but it was offered next to a stack of disposable plastic cups. I really expected a more eco-friendly approach, especially considering the location of your shop.

After leaving their neighbor down the street for some more appropriate Saturday night music (jukebox with great tunes) we found ourselves a booth after ordering drinks at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and the atmosphere is laid back. The patio was packed and nowhere to sit, which was fine with me since I had no intention of adding to my impressive number of mosquito bites on my legs. \\n\\nThe beer selection is decent and boasts some local delicious beers. There were TVs that were playing the World Cup, along with baseball, all sound turned off. We had a great time inside (in the AC) and ordered several rounds. At one point, I decided to forgo my healthy eating trek and had every desire to experience Gourmand's to its fullest: by ordering The Cleopatra sandwich, my visit was complete. We shared this sandwich and we both liked it. I want to try the Cheesehead next. \\n\\nNote: My only beef is the fact that the only server never acknowledged us, brought us menus or water or NOTHING. He passed by us a zillion times. We ordered our 3 rounds of drinks at the bar (each time), along with the sandwich, and we went in search of a menu for ourselves since it was never offered. I have no issue with getting up myself, but I would have been happier if it wasn't so blatantly obvious how much we were ignored. It would have been better if he just wasn't there at all, in my opinion. So Gourmand's, do yourself a favor and don't offer any service at all, then maybe I wouldn't have been so offended during the 2-3 hours we were there. He even kept serving a dude that was obviously super wasted and should not have been continued to be served alcohol due to his inability to even walk straight.\\n\\nI'm going to give the benefit of the doubt because I do intend on returning, and I assume that it was just a fluke thing that maybe we were too invisible to be seen or maybe I should have dressed like a hobo."},{"name":"The Hawthorne","address":"500A Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I visited Boston and was looking for a place to catch up with some friends.

Now as we were paying the bill out of curiosity I asked our waitress what was in the drinks and she told me she didn't know. When she came back after running my card, I asked her who made them and that is when she admitted that the bartender was busy and she had made our drinks herself.  That's a huge issue with me because she couldn't even tell me what alcohol was in the drink. We left and didn't speak to management as I felt like I was going to die, but that's absolutely not right. If the bartender is busy then just tell us. Don't make a drink for someone if you don't even know what you are putting in it.

The restaurant itself makes you feel like you are in the dining room of a ship; lots of old hardwood paneling and built-in seating. The menu is limited, with brisket, pulled pork, chili, and some side dishes to choose from. The meat itself is very flavorful, and while you really don't need any condiments, the carolina mustard bbq was worth trying. I found the cornbread to be more on the dry side, but cornbread can be divisive! My only request is if maybe they had some additional non-fried veggie side dishes, like green beans or even baked beans. Also, a more legible sign on the front of the building would make it easier to spot from the road. \\n\\nThe staff is friendly and the food is super tasty.

If you are going to charge premium prices for Caribbean food then prepare it at a premium level. I ordered Curry Goat. What I was served tasted great but it was tough and full of bones. At this level of price the meat should have been boneless and tender. I also ordered a small bowl of soup. It was excellent but the portion size was not in line with their pricing and there was very little actual substance to the soup.

Don't come to this place if you're not hungry!! :) \\nThis is my favorite brunch spot and I luckily live half a mile away, which can be dangerous. They have a large selection of all the typical brunch items you'd like-- eggs, omelettes, egg benedicts, pancakes, french toast, etc. and from my experience you can't go wrong with any of them. Most brunch places I know are only good at making either the savory OR the sweet items, while others try to make really unique items at the risk of it being overpriced and mediocre. I think Ball Square is *consistently* good at making solid, classic brunch food. This place does have huge portions, so either come hungry, split a plate or take some home.\\n\\n2. Be sure to take into consideration wait times on weekends--  during popular brunch times there tends to be a very long line out the door. No reservations, and you and your party have to be physically present in order to get the table when you're up next. Otherwise I've never had an issue with seating on weekdays or late (past brunch rush times) on weekends. \\n\\nTo credit this restaurant and the staff, I have come during busy weekend brunch times and during slow downtimes, and we've always gotten attentive, warm and timely service. It seems the waiters/waitresses are all friendly and happy (or at least okay?) working there which always elevates my appreciation for the restaurant. \\n\\nCons? I love coffee with brunch and I just don't like their drip coffee, which would be fine if I could pay less for just a small cup rather than than $4 for unlimited.

Finally tried the White Chili: some sort of greenish slurry, baby food consistency sauce with large chunks of dry pork in it. Not a huge fan and actually left me a bit confused. Not at all what I expect for a white chili. No worries though.

It's normally very hard for a waitress to be able to keep my glass continually full of the beverage that I'm drinking and I usually find myself having to flag down a waitress at any given restaurant several times during my meal in order to get the drink refilled because I'm constantly finishing my drink and left with nothing to wash my food down with.  This wasn't the case at Jack Allen's. It was a packed house and the waitress was still coming by every 3-5 minutes and keeping my glass constantly full. LOL she even made the comment after about the 6th refill in a 20 minute period, \\"challenge accepted\\" hahahaha I thought that was pretty funny  and showed incredible service at a restaurant that was fully packed and extra busy. I wish I had gotten her name because she did an excellent job and needs some \\"dap\\" thrown her way. I highly recommend going to Jack Allen's and getting anything off of the menu.

When I go to Ruth's Chris I want to be able to focus on my beautiful wife, not listen to other people's conversation because we were sitting almost on top of them, and the resaurant was sparesly occupied. \\nMy steak was up to par for Ruth's Chris. It was cooked to my specification and met my high standards for Ruth's Chris. However, the shrimp on top of my steak was over cooked and lacked taste. My wife commented that the Hell's Kitchen guy would have chewed this cook out for serving crispy grilled shrimp. She is right. I have had much better prepeared shrimp at any number of average restaurants. \\nThe service was poorly lacking. We are accustomed to Ruth's Chris servers being OVERLY attentive. Our waiter was sorely lacking in this area. He took too long in brining us our check, refilling our drinks, etc. He would tell us that he would be right back and that meant a good 10 minutes right back.

We were all surprised at how large the fillet appeared as it hung off of the bun a good three inches on both sides.  The trouble with that is that this means you have a lot of chicken without all of the elements of the sandwich and because the fillet was pounded so flat, it got really dry after frying and I got more breading than chicken with each bite.

I am vegan and always appreciated that they have a vegan sausage on the menu.\\n\\nThe first time I ordered it, it came out with the caramel sauce on the side. Judging from the consistency of the sauce, I had a weird feeling it wasn't vegan so I set it aside and didn't eat it. The second time I ordered it, our waitress told us that the caramel sauce that comes on the side is not vegan so if we are vegan to avoid the sauce. My fiance and I (both vegans) were confused as to why they would have a non-vegan sauce accompany a dish listed as vegan, especially when the sauce is in the description under the \\"vegan\\" item. Our waitress told us she was vegan, too, so that's the only reason she knew. We were thankful to her for the information and asked for it to not be included with our order. \\n\\nI don't particularly enjoy the vegan sausage - I mean, it's just a blob of fried food for gods sake (why the hell is it fried, btw), but it is food that I can eat when others want to eat there, so it works on a rare occasion. The third time I went, I ordered a side of fruit and a side of pickles because I didn't want to mess with the sausage again. It was fine. I mean, it was fruit and pickles. There's really no way to screw that up. \\n\\nHowever, I just learned that the chef at this restaurant *INTENTIONALLY* puts butter in the \\"vegan\\" caramel sauce as a big F-U to vegans, whom apparently he hates. He has told multiple employees about this, and it is a former employee who told me this was the case. \\n\\nI am APPALLED to learn that a restaurant in this day and age would be so shockingly irresponsible and engage in such highly unethical business practices. Dairy allergies can be extremely serious and I have to wonder if the chef considered the fact that some people are vegan due to health complications, not because they don't want to eat meat, eggs, and dairy. I would venture not or else he would not have decided to risk his entire livelihood and business just to get off on messing with vegans, who, by the way, are still paying to patronize your business. I am shocked, disgusted, and will be sure to NEVER eat here again and tell every one I know, omni or not, about the abhorrent business practices being applied here."},{"name":"Giraffe Japanese Deli","address":"81 SE Yamhill St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"solid curry and pretty good pastries."},{"name":"Du Kuh Bee","address":"12590 SW 1st St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"After an 8-hour drive from around Eureka, California, we got into Portland around 9pm.

Wings, salmon and salads were of very good quality.  The highlight was the lamb lollipops.  Holy schnickey's.  As good as I have ever had, which is saying something!  Do not hesitate to stop in!  A terrific place with great service.  Mucho recommended."},{"name":"Houston's Restaurant","address":"3321 Lenox Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Service was great. The food and wine menu was excellent. I ordered the salmon which came with a lentil vinaigrette, broccoli, and mashed potatoes. The salmon was perfectly cooked. It was crispy on the outside and juicy and flaky on the inside. The vinaigrette was delicious. I wish I had more. The mashed potatoes were bland and the broccoli had Romano cheese and lemon on it which weren't to my liking, but I didn't order the salmon for the sides. My boyfriend ordered the double cut pork chop. It looked to be cooked perfectly. He savoured every last bite of it. He also really enjoyed the red cabbage that came with his pork. We shared a bottle of Drylands Sauv Blanc. It was a great accompaniment to our meals."},{"name":"Casa Mia Cucina Italiana","address":"261 Washington St","city":"Marblehead","stars":"4.5","text":"Our dinner last night was amazing. We arrived on a Friday night with no reservation hoping to get to a show in 45 minutes. The host directed us to the bar which is small but comfortable. \\n\\nAll the employees at the bar and milling around were wonderful - respectful, kind and attentive. And very busy. This place was hopping. It seems like THE place to go for a lot of locals. \\n\\nMy husband ordered a garden salad and liked it but he's not a huge fan of what he calls funky lettuce.  He's more of a romaine guy and it was green leaf lettuce! That said it looked very good. \\n\\nThe amazing part, and it was truly amazing, was our entrees. He ordered the Carbonara sauce and I ordered the Amatriciana which is a spicy red sauce but I had them hold the cheese and hold the meat since I'm vegan. The homemade pasta was incredibly rich and satisfying. The sauce was worth crying over. \\n\\nThe menu is varied and so there are other items we might try next time but we cannot even imagine getting something other than the perfection we had last night. \\n\\nWhen we left the host and maybe owner thanked us for coming and they were so grateful that we enjoyed ourselves. \\n\\nIt was truly a wonderful dining experience. We don't go to Marblehead often but I think that's about to change!"},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The menu is pretty limited on vegan options- and I was less than impressed along with the rest of my party.

If you're starving this might not be the place to go as each dish ranges between about $7-$12 in small portions. However, if you're sharing with another person it's a little more reasonable. Waited about 20 min after ordering our food and it was not packed at all. I suppose the plus side to that is the food was fresh! Overall decent place to eat some Asian food"},{"name":"Quincy Market","address":"4 S Market St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I had two very different experiences here based on what time I went to Quincy Market. The whole block with Quincy Market, Faneuil Hall and South Market is 100% touristy, but it's got great food and can be really fun when you're trying to push through the crowd. I came here one time during prime time lunch hour around noon and it was literally people shuffling an inch a minute to get anywhere. I wasn't in a hurry and wanted to look at everything so that was fine. However I came back again at an off time around 3PM and wow what a difference!! I could run the entire length of Quincy Market back and forth and it was a completely different experience. Definitely loved the less crowded feel. \\n\\nThe various different foods were amazing and overwhelming at the same time. There were at least three different food stations that had the classic lobster rolls and clam chowder bread bowls but there were plenty of other cuisines including Chinese, Italian, Mexican, Japanese. There were also tons of dessert places ranging from baked goods to frozen yogurt and gelato. There's also the much needed coffee stops and a delicious smoothie station."},{"name":"Houston's Restaurant","address":"3321 Lenox Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This was by far the best burger I have ever had!!!!

We were sadly disappointed.\\nIt is a bit overpriced for the quality and portions. Many of the sauces tasted like they had the same base but were only slightly altered depending on the recipe.\\nI do think that if you are not very familiar with Asian food you may not notice that the cooking is subpar so it could be enjoyable and a way to try some new cuisine without having copious amounts of each dish. \\nWe were there for happy hour and it wasn't too busy.

The center hall has a lobby area where musicians were playing music and tables and benches to eat food, as well as food stalls that extend out from the lobby in both directions. Parallel to this hall are shopping vendors, selling everything from little trinkets to clothing items. It was a very cute market, where we strolled through the vendors, and spent some time listening to the music as we ate terrific gelato.\\n\\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to try any of the food here, but there was so much variety all in one place!

There is outdoor seating if you want it (but ask when you reserve!). \\n\\nWe went here for brunch. I recommend going with a group that's ok with sharing food because the setup of their menu encourages it. \\n\\nWe tried the sticky bun (GET THIS) and it was incredible. The pastry was flaky and buttery, but interestingly there's not much of anything sticky - it is mostly a dry bun with a small about of toasted pecans on it. \\n\\nWe also split the half spicy half regular chicken and waffles. The chicken was moist inside and crispy outside like it should be, but I wish it had a lighter crust. The waffle, on the other hand, was super disappointing. It seemed like an afterthought. It was dry and not flavorful at all. I'd go back and try something else instead. \\n\\nThe cocktails were creative, intriguing, and unique.

I was wary because at the time I had not had good sushi since I moved here several months prior.  However, we decided to give it a shot.  We sat at the bar and watched the chef prepare the sushi.  She informed us that they have REAL wasabi (sadly rare- this is the only place I've ever had it) and gave us an extensive lesson on wasabi, how to prepare it, why it is so expensive and hard to come by, etc.  She was also extremely knowledgeable about all other things sushi.  And of course, you get the best service when you're sitting at the bar:-)  Everything was of the highest quality and tasted phenomenal.\\n\\nWent back there tonight with a larger party and at a much busier time, and although the food was again of the highest quality, one of our party had to wait a considerable amount of time for his food (you can read his review of it below!), so with some hesitation I give it four stars- really, 4.5 would be ideal (I know, I'm such a woman).

I knew he was rude but I still had to pretend nice for ordering food because i didn't want to spoil my date with my friends. When I order Peking duck, it took 45 minutes to be served.

She gave us attitude when we were ordering and didn't have any knowledge about the menu. You can tell she literally did not want to serve us or was uninterested. The food was mediocre. My husband ordered the katsu don and it was very bland. I asked the server for sauce that goes into the katsu don because the food was very bland and she was like they don't use a sauce in the katsu don and in the end she brought out teriyaki sauce so clearly there was a sauce. At the end of the night she gave us the bill and charged us $0.50 for the sauce and didn't even mention it would be an extra charge. If they had good customer service that bowl would have been free of charge. I didn't want to leave her a tip at all but the tip was included in our meal so we had no choice.

The decor of this place is Disney Quality--amazing, truly aesthetically pleasing. Just like a restaurant in Andapur should be, at least how I imagine it to look like. The service was incredible and attentive, and were just amazing in building the atmosphere and making sure the experience was great. No complaints there. The issue that my group encountered was the food itself. \\n\\nNow, water in Disney already tastes weird--like sulfur--so that doesn't need to be really covered. However, the food itself needs to be addressed. We ordered the Korean Beef, the Dim Sum Platter, the Lemon-Grass Chicken, a bowl of Wonton Soup, and the Kobe Beef Burger. \\n\\nWe started with the Dim Sum and the Wonton Soup. The Wonton Soup was bland, with bbq beef inside the Wonton, which clashed with the cup-o-noodle like broth (description provided by teen at table, who is very acquainted with cup-o-noodle). The Dim Sum was pretty okay, really gummy in texture and premade/over cooked(?). It was marketed as a \\"For Two\\" plate, but you only got three shu mai, two char siu bao, and two pot stickers. Definitely not enough for two people to share for a meal. The char siu bao were odd and were filled with bbq pork. That isn't that strange in and of itself, but it was incredibly sweet, like hoisin sauce and honey. Disappointing, and nothing like the char siu bao that you would get from a Chinese market or shop. \\n\\nThe mains came out shortly after--again, service was prompt and friendly, despite how busy it was. The Lemon-Grass Chicken was okay, a bit dry (we had asked for it medium and it came out well) but the flavor was killer, as were the side vegetables. The side rice was super undercooked, very dry and crunchy. The Kobe Burger was delicious and huge, incredibly flavorful, with crispy house string fries. They bungled his side though, he asked for the mushroom chutney and they gave him the cucumber slaw. Didn't bother to send it back.\\n\\nThe failure of the evening--and I don't say this lightly--was the Korean BBQ Beef. It was sickeningly sweet, like an overdone Sweet and Sour AmerChinese food. Claimed it would be spicy, not even a little bit so. There was no hint of \\"Korean\\" in the flavor, and I was rather nauseated by the intense sugar and honey flavor. The cloying flavor completely overrode the paltry flavor of the accompanying garlic noodles. The meat itself was soft and well cooked, but two bites in and I had to stop. \\n\\nPerhaps the overdone sweetness will appeal to some, but to someone who darn well KNOWS her Korean food and does not enjoy sweets, this was a disgusting mess to ingest. \\n\\nBreakdown: Food-2/5 (\\"Korean\\" BBQ-0/5), Decor-5/5, Service-4/5, Location-Disney/5, Price-2/5. Normally this would average out to around a 3 or 4, but the quality of the food in combination with needing a reservation and the price (~$30 a person) dropped this down to a 2. \\n\\nI can safely say that I won't be back.\\n\\nUPDATE: After leaving this review in the survey Y&Y sent after the meal, they contacted me to apologize and follow up on what I highlighted. Again, service was extraordinary, and it was great to see them following up on customer concerns. Kudos to the restaurant manager Tom! The service really is what kept this from a 1 star review."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My review is about one item on the menu:\\"Crispy chicken sandwich\\".

We were greeted by a friendly hostess who told us it was a 20-45min wait. We asked if they did take out and she said yes so she gave us a menu. As we sat to look over the menu she then told us she could seat us. We were fine with that since we were hungry. We got sat and we were familiar with the concept because we've been to similar places. We opted for sushi and not hot pot. The prices were on the higher end, but the quality was definitely very poor. The sushi on the conveyor belt was not fresh at all and lacked options. Also some plates only served 3 pieces of sushi for half the price of a full. But honestly just order from the menu. The conveyor belt is not worth it. The worst part is that it took forever to get our sushi that we ordered. They did let us know they were busy, but would not check on us to see how we were doing.

Came here with 4 other people for Sunday brunch and no one left satisfied. Service was perfectly fine, but quite honestly this food is nothing spectacular, which is quite surprising considering how expensive everything was.\\nI got the quail and waffles, an interesting play on a popular dish. Very well plated but quite mediocre beyond that. The entire dish was the same flavor, just a slight sweetness to the grits, waffle, quail, and eggs. The waffles was too small and the quail of course had too many bones. It's not that I don't enjoy quail, but it doesn't quite make sense to use it in this kind of dish. If you really want to come here and leave somewhat full you should get this.\\nTwo people got the breakfast tacos, which had their house cured goat bacon in it. I think it's awesome when a restaurant rotates its menu and cures its own meats, but this goat bacon was beyond disgusting. The bacon was half cartilage half salt. Impossible to chew and way too salty to enjoy.\\nTwo people got the eggs Benedict and I honestly felt so sorry for them. Unless there was gold in there, that was the most overpriced dish I have ever encountered in my life. Two golf ball sized benedicts on a plate of greens is ridiculous. If it was the best eggs benedict anyone has tasted in their lives then the price could be somewhat understandable, but it was just nasty.\\nTLDR: cute place but absolutely no substance."},{"name":"Long John Silver's","address":"1560 Vfw Pkwy","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"1.5","text":"Stay away!

Recently, I heard of a new place that they opened up in New Westminster called Highlight by Re-Up BBQ, which takes aim at the breakfast-obsessed people with offerings of biscuits, pancakes, and sandwiches all enhanced with their usual BBQ offerings.\\n\\nColour me intrigued because it was enough to encourage me to visit and see for myself. I ordered the Chicken and Biscuits with Country Style Gravy ($12.95). Despite it not being overly busy, I found that it took a while for the food to come out. When it did finally arrive to my table, I was quite pleased.\\n\\nThe fried chicken comes with 2 pieces of bone-in leg and thigh perched on top of soft buttermilk biscuits. The freshly fried chicken had a nice, crispy skin and, overall, I thought this was a good dish with the slight tartness of the pickled radish and the savory gravy... can't go wrong with gravy.\\n\\nI was impressed enough by my first visit that I decided to return a couple of weeks later to try their Fried Chicken Benny ($14.95) which is a similar dish (ie. fried chicken served on buttermilk biscuits) but with the addition of poached eggs and a side of hash browns. This time, I had to go to the front counter to order and it took about 14 minutes for my food to come out. On first appearances, things looked good.\\n\\nHowever, when I went to cut into the poached eggs, I was disappointed that they were over-cooked. I know that this is a \\"first world problem\\" but this dish really needed the runny yolk because the chicken was a bit over-cooked as well and the combination of the dry chicken meat and buttermilk biscuit makes this difficult to eat. Definitely not as good as the chicken and biscuits that I had on my first visit. To be fair, the biscuits themselves were still pretty good... nice and fluffy. But the chicken meat was dry and chewy on the inside (they used boneless chicken in this dish). If the yolk was runny or if there was some gravy that went along with this dish, it probably could have been saved. \\n\\nI figured I should come back and give them another try to see if the issue with the over-cooked poached eggs was just a one-off so the next time I visited, I tried their Beef Brisket Hash ($14.95). Served on a skillet with potato nuggets, onions, green pepper, corn, roasted cherry tomatoes and topped with two poached eggs... I was pleasantly surprised by the yellow runny yolk that oozed from the egg once I popped it. The beef brisket was cubed up and deliciously tender. Overall, a pretty good hash dish. The online menu said that it's served with a traditional gravy but I didn't notice a gravy (that would have really kicked this dish up a notch).\\n\\nI came back for a revisit in late August to try their Spicy Fried Chicken Sandwich with Fries ($9.95 + $2.50). They claim that this is the sandwich that made Re-Up BBQ famous and I can see why. It's a really good fried chicken sandwich with the right amount of spiciness that you can feel the heat in your mouth but not overpowering. They layer the crispy fried-chicken with bacon (thank you) and cheddar and slather on some guacamole, chipotle mayo, and bbq sauce onto the kaiser bun. The fries need work tho. I also feel like they need to work on their service as it's often disjointed, especially when it's busy (I saw one party that left after they had been sitting and waiting for service).\\n\\nOn my next revisit in October, I tried their Re-up Smoked Bacon Basic Breakfast ($14.95 + $2.50 for a side of fruit salad). As I've probably mentioned previously, I've had slow/sketchy service here in the past and, unfortunately, today was not going to be any different. It took 15 minutes just to take my order - but this was because she kept taking the orders for people who came in after me. Seriously... someone came in after me, had their order taken, and their food delivered to their table before she came back to take my order. And it's not that I didn't try to flag her down either. Okay, enough of this ranting.\\n\\nTake my advice, skip the fruit salad as it was very basic with just a mix of chunks of apple, strawberry, and orange slices. To be fair, the breakfast was actually quite good. You get pimento cheese buttermilk biscuits topped with eggs along with hash browns, pit beans, and bacon. It would have been nice if they asked how I wanted my eggs prepared but the over-easy eggs turned out nicely with a runny yolk on the inside. The pit beans were really good and had a bold and smokey flavour.\\n\\nAs for service, I was never checked-in on, no water refill, or even just a stop by to see if everything was okay (which I heard her do for the other diners).\\n\\nOverall, I have really mixed feelings about this place. Generally speaking, most of the food items I've tried here have been pretty good. However, their service (or lack thereof) leaves a lot to be desired."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I'm giving it 3 stars due to service not food quality.

I suggest you try them sometime! \\n\\nI came by myself early on a Friday night. It took awhile for me to receive my order and for my server to acknowledge I was finished and ready for my check.

If this is you- don't worry. There are plenty of tables. The place was not even half full by 830. \\nStarted with the saganaki, which is a cheese that comes flaming with ouzo. It was recommended to me by a colleague and I've had it at other Greek restaurants. It was tasty, but just as expected. They serve it with a small loaf of homemade bread. We asked for a side of butter and got those little individually plastic gold wrapped butters. Lol. I was hoping for a little ramekin or whipped butter. Pipe dream. \\nNext, we had the octopus. It is marinated and then charred on the grill. It is served with sliced tomatoes with feta cheese and olives. It was delicious. For $22.95, it was a small portion. This dish is more costly than some of their entrees, and a lot less food. \\nI had a glass of Greek red wine with my dinner. It was ok. Tasted like grape juice. Nothing fancy. I ordered the papootsakia, a stuffed eggplant dish with a b√©chamel sauce. My date had the gyro plate which had a ton of onions and tzaziki sauce. Yum! We split everything half and half. I enjoyed both dishes, my date didn't like the sweetness of the b√©chamel sauce on my dish. \\nAfter dinner, I had a Greek stout beer while we chatted. I loved it. I should've had two of those instead of the wine. But the abv is low, something like 5.8%. \\nThe waitress may have been bored. She was all over our table at the beginning and the end and throughout. In the beginning, I felt a little hurried to place my order. As if she needed to turn our table over. In the middle I was happy because she was attentive. However, she as trying to grab my date's plate before he was finished sopping all the sauce with the bread. That was a little annoying. It doesn't hurt to leave some plates for a few minutes. At the end, I was in no hurry to pay while we were enjoying our time so I had to stop her from grabbing the empty check. \\nOverall, great food. Overpriced.

That lady was extremely nice till money was exchanged, then she acted like asking for anything else was beneath her.\\n\\nI would say the food is decent, like all other teriyaki places in the couve, but once again prices are to high, and the attitude was terrible. \\n\\nMy girl friend asked for just egg rolls, and she treated her poorly, cause all she wanted was 2 egg rolls, and not two orders of egg rolls.\\n\\nI order a kids meal, cause lets face it, that's about all we need in a meal, and when the order was ready, she said in a humiliating tone, here is your child's meal.\\n\\nLove how people today, can be so politely angry, and when someone who has experienced enough life to understand when someone is being mean, calls em out on it, they try to hide behind the fact they did not react in a emotional way, even though their response shows disrespect. \\n\\nOnce again the food is good, but the prices are to high, and if you shop in a way that meets your waistline or budget, they will be angry they had to sell you something for less then 10 dollars. \\n\\nPeople would make alot more money in life if the offered enough of a reason to entice people to return daily, if not several times a day, cause lets face it, who really wants to cook anymore.\\n\\nIf you look at some other countries, the prices are so affordable, people eat out every meal. That will never happen in america, cause everyone wants so much money now, rather then realizing small amounts more often means more money, then asking for a large amount one time.\\n\\nIn your head when you are eatting out from time to time, calculate food cost lol.

I can't speak to any \\"authenticity\\" of the food because I haven't been to the regions they hail from, but I can say that everything I ate tasted really great and they have some non-seafood options that looked really tasty.\\n\\nI had a steak dish with rice and beans--they were not refried beans, which surprised me, but they were tasty.. almost like spicy barbecue beans. The rice was seriously awesome. (I know, usually you don't rave about rice, right? But I could have eaten more of it for sure.) The steak was good and slathered in a spicy salsa. The dish came with a side of guacamole and corn tortilla quesadillas.\\n\\nMy husband had a mixed seafood dish that he liked a lot (I didn't try it because, yeah, no seafood.) \\n\\nI do wish, for the price point, that the salsa they serve initially was a little better. (I know, it's a weird thing to nitpick but... it's the first thing you eat and I would love to see better salsas overall in Mexican restaurants). My food was great but the cut of steak was around the same grade as carne asada, so $15-ish is a tiny bit steep for the dish. The price point is just a little higher than I would want to pay on the regular for Mexican food, but don't make a mistake--the food is delish and I think it's worth it, we're just frugal and don't often pay that much to eat out.\\n\\nPlus, also, since they have a lot of seafood and that's expensive to stock, I get it. However, since I don't eat that, I can't speak to the quality of it.\\n\\nI also really liked the service. I could tell our server was a little new to serving, but he was really attentive and did a good job. The person who brought out our food seemed like she might be a manager or owner and she was fantastic.

The chicken on the pizza was already cold, it was cut by what seemed to be someone suffering from vertigo and just overall terrible taste. Ended up walking down the road and ordering another pizza cause ours was so disgusting. Looking through these reviews it looks like half of them are fakes cause this place it either getting 1 or 2 stars of 4 or 5.

There's a real Austin vibe here, sort of funky and cool and hipster at the same time.  Ordered a pair of the most popular tamales, the pork and the chicken tomatillo with a dash of mole sauce on one.  I say 'dash' because it was ladled with enough sauce for both tamales!\\n\\nThe mole sauce has a neat smokiness that compliments the masa that cradles the meat inside.  It turns everything almost creamy!  Surprisingly, I found the pork one okay, but a little dry even with the sauce.  On the other hand, the chicken tomatillo is one of the best tamales I've had, hands down!\\n\\nOne last note - I spotted a little doorway labeled 'Somewhere In Time' off to the side of the dining room.  Out of curiosity, I went inside and met the lady who runs SiT and owns T.H.E. with her kids!  As of March 2019 SiT has been open a month, it's a vintage clothing, shoes, and purse shop.

One of the best sushi spots in Atlanta. Expect to drop a lot of money on one meal though. This would be a fantastic date night spot if you are really trying to impress. I think sitting at the sushi bar is the best experience because you can interact with the sushi chefs and see how they prepare the food. \\n\\nFOOD: There are 3 tiers of Omakase here, and Umi is the lowest at about $80 (then Miyabi, and Ito-kase the most expensive). Umi started with miso soup and appetizers. For appetizers, we got the Tuna Carpaccio and the Yellowtail Jalape√±o. I liked the Tuna Carpaccio better and I thought every element on the dish was very tasty. \\n\\nThen we got the sashimi plate. Everything was super fresh. After that, we got the hot plates, the Sea Bass and the Black Cod. (Both great!) Then we got the nigiri plate, which was my favorite. There were some flavorful combinations. My personal favorite was the salmon and caviar nigiri. One nigiri was some sort of clam that I have never seen before and I was kind of apprehensive about eating it. \\n\\nI was so full at this point and I was pretty happy when dessert came. I believe they change up the desserts, but we got served the Black Sesame Pannacotta. It was very light on the sweetness and came with gold flakes on top. I thought it had a beautiful presentation. \\n\\nOTHER: Service from the sushi chefs are great, but I felt service from the servers was a bit lacking. I'm sure it's because they are really busy though, since they have to serve so many dishes to us. The interior feels really upscale and is dimly lit. \\n\\nPARKING: Umi shares a Valet Parking area with Chops Lobster Bar. Then you have to walk a bit. Umi is kind of hard to locate, but it has a wooden door. \\n\\nOVERALL: Best part of Umi is the experience. It's really fun to get served so many different dishes. I would make sure you have enough time to really savor the food and Omakase (if you are doing it). We came about 1.5 hours before closing so we were stuffing ourselves pretty quickly, but I would say ideally you would want 2-3 hours to enjoy everything without rushing!

He was even better at forecasting the outcome of the NBA Finals. The Cavs were down 2-1 at the time and he said he thought they were going to pull it off. They lost Game 4 that night. I thought to myself, \\"That server at Soul Vegetarian jinxed it. What a dummy.\\" Then, of course, the Cavs came back to win three straight games and get the NBA Championship. That server is now a genius and a Nostradamus as far as I'm concerned. \\n\\nWhenever I'm back in Atlanta, I'm going to come back in and check out this place if only because it left behind such great memories."},{"name":"gusto!","address":"782 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I totally love this place!

This was my first time in, but not the birthday girl's. I used Open Table to make the reservation and left the note that we were celebrating a birthday. \\n\\nUpon arriving, there is no actual parking, only valet. So make sure you bring some cash. Not to pay for valet, but to tip the valet, as parking is free. Once we handed over the keys to valet we walked inside. After checking in, the hostess immediately wished the birthday girl 'happy birthday'. Points right there. I've booked on Open Table before and left a note on there, as I did this time, however no one said 'happy birthday', 'happy anniversary' or whatever the celebration note was. Nice to see that Canoe is a step above the others in this area. The hostess informed us that our table near the water was being prepared. During that time our coats were taken.\\n\\nAs we walked further into the restaurant, it's dimly lit w/ cozy booths throughout the restaurant. Canoe comes off as casual formal, but plenty of people were in t-shirts and ball caps. This is def a good place for a date night, anniversary and any sort of celebration. \\n\\nOnce seated we looked over the menu. I was severely impressed w/ their selection of food. The Peppercorn Crusted Kangaroo appetizer jumped out at me immediately. It's VERY rare to find kangaroo on any menu in the states. So to see it here, it was a must have. It was not a let down at all. Highly recommended, especially if you've never had it. Brought me back to my days in Oz. The other app we selected was the Jerked Australian Octopus. Typically octopus can be made where it's very chewy. Not here. It was spot on. I love octopus and if it's on a menu, I'm ordering it. Another highly recommended dish to have. \\n\\nFor our entrees, the birthday girl selected the trout as one of the specials they had last night. I on the hand had the Rosemary Marinated Australian Lamb Loin (Chipotle \\"Merguez,\\" Minted Parsnip Tortellini, Rapini). It was SO tender and flavorful. \\n\\nI doubt you could go wrong w/ any selection here at Canoe. This place is a great gem for the Atlanta area. It's been on my radar for awhile now and I'm glad I finally got to come in to enjoy what it has to offer. If you've never been, I HIGHLY recommend you go, whether you're a local or tourist.

The first thing that struck me was the open and beautiful space with two large rooms, high ceilings and a gorgeous wood burning fireplace in the back room, not to mention two large bar areas.  \\n\\nNoticed it was Sunday Sinatra night and the staff quickly accommodated me without a reservation.  I was then led to a basement supper club which was very cool!  An entirely different but just as fun vibe from upstairs.  Ordered an arugula pecorino salad and rigatoni bolognese which were both delicious!  Enjoyed my meal while listening to Rich DiMare and the Ron Poster trio.  They were terrific and so authentic with the Sinatra sound!  I had such a great experience that I ended up reserving a table for 6 for St. Patrick's Day brunch a week later. \\n\\nCapo did not disappoint!  Even though it was an insane day and not the most well behaved clientele,  the staff did a tremendous job!  Professional , efficient, friendly and respectful despite some of the behavior they had to deal with.  \\n\\nOur server, Stephanie,  was wonderful!  We stayed for hours and she was so attentive and helpful even though she was crazy busy that day.  She brought us our own \\"mimosa bar\\" which included a huge bottle of Prosecco along with a variety of juices to choose from that were kept right on our table.  We started with a few appetizers,  the avocado tomato toast and zeppoles (ricotta doughnuts!) were especially noteworthy as were a number of items that my friends ordered such as the tiramisu pancakes (yum!), the Nutella banana French toast and the Capo meatballs oh and of course their parmigiana fries!  All so delicious!  My friends are still talking about what a great brunch and amazing time they had that day!\\n\\nA special shout out to Adam who was staffing the entrance to the Supper Club venue that day where Joshua Tree, a U2 cover band were playing. ( who btw, were fantastic!)  Adam was extremely pleasant and helpful. I witnessed him handling in a very firm but respectful way a number of customers who were becoming a bit too inebriated to really enjoy the show.

One space. Seemingly one kitchen. Two dining rooms designed to foster the illusion these are two separate places. Different menus with items from one being \\"unavailable\\" at the other.\\n\\nTwo-Headed-Giant restaurants are mostly about management trying to squeeze two market niches out of the same space. If it was about maximum service, you could get any dish in either of the two places.\\n\\nHalcyon is a coffee place with light snacks.\\n\\nHalcyon Downtown has a huge advantage that Halcyon Mueller does not have.\\n\\nIt is sitting on some of the coolest real estate on Fourth Street - the crazy building with the sidewalk you have to reach using stairs.\\n\\nHowever, net of location, location, location, Halcyon actually succeeds at the challenge of delivering on multiple niches.\\n\\nThey are a not bad coffee place by day. They are not a bad bar by night. \\n\\nThey are a SPECTACULAR bar if you go there for adult milkshakes by night. Theirs are among the best in Austin.\\n\\nMy idea of a super-duper special treat downtown is to finish a night of drinking elsewhere with a grand finale of an adult dessert shake at Halcyon. My inner four year old and forty year old are both ecstatic.\\n\\nThe Fourth Street Magic Pixie Fairy Dust does not transfer to Mueller -\\n\\nand it certainly does not transfer to Stella's.\\n\\nStella's at Mueller is pizza and beer at afternoon and night, brunch by morning and noon. \\n\\nThis is hard to pull off because it takes completely different skills to do a brunch place and a pizza place.\\n\\nThis is a review of the brunch place. \\n\\nFor all I know the pizza and beer are perfectly lovely, although a lot of Yelpers are down on the pizza too.\\n\\nBrunch is not impressive.\\n\\nIronically, one of the weakest points was the coffee.\\n\\nThey advertise the coffee as coming from Halcyon.\\n\\nThe cup of coffee I got was undrinkable and had to be sent back.\\n\\nThis is the curse of the neglected coffee pot. \\n\\nA lot of coffee houses concentrate on espresso drinks which are totally labor intensive. This can allow people not to pay attention to what is going on with the drip percolator which is sitting there minding its own business. The coffee in the coffee urn can get pretty old.\\n\\nMy breakfast was fried eggs with speck, wild mushrooms and potatoes. They use speck and wild mushrooms to justify a healthy price markup on the dish. They do not use speck and wild mushrooms because they taste any better than ham and supermarket mushrooms.\\n\\nThis dish tasted like nothing.\\n\\nFrankly, all of the dishes on the menu were of the \\"elaborate\\" nature designed to make your brunch as Stella's \\"a special destination\\".\\n\\nMaking dishes complicated is easy.\\n\\nMaking them good is something else.\\n\\nOften the use of plain simple garden-variety ingredients is necessary to make dishes taste good.\\n\\nThis dish could have massively benefited from something like scallions, or something like green pepper, or something like celery.\\n\\nThey could have even used plain old mushrooms rather then fancy ones but sauteed them for half an hour rather than a minimalist turn in the skillet. Long cooked mushrooms caramelize and soak up butter taste.\\n\\nBut scallions, green pepper or celery don't sound cool on the menu and don't sell. Sauteing your mushrooms for half an hour is actual work and that doesn't sell anything either.\\n\\nStella's is all about creating a menu that \\"sounds\\" good.\\n\\nI would rather have a menu that tastes good.\\n\\nSo this two-headed giant is a no-headed-giant.\\n\\nIf I am at Mueller, I would rather do my eating at Vert's and my drinking at the Alamo Drafthouse."},{"name":"Stella Public House","address":"1905 Aldrich St, Ste 110","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food.

Simply put, the food doesn't knock my socks off and service is inconsistent.  Perhaps my expectations are too high.  I was expecting Bistro Niko to blow me away like Kyma or Veni Vidi Vici, two excellent Buckhead Life restaurants.  Instead, it's let me down like Atlanta Fish Market.\\n\\nFrench cuisine is supposed to be among the best in the world, so one would expect Bistro Niko to bring it.  Charcuterie (meats, cheeses), chicken, steak, duck, lamb chops, and seafood (raw oysters, mussels) make up a big part of the menu.  Most appetizers are about $10-12 each and entrees are about $20-30+ each.  I've tried the following:\\n\\nEscargots \\"en croute\\" - garlic butter, puff pastry\\nMussels \\"Le Coze\\" - white wine, shallots, cream & parsley\\n12-ounce ribeye with Cafe de Paris butter (made of 23 herbs) and fries\\nMonk fish with spinach, fennel, mashed potatoes, and Parmesan cream sauce\\nCreme Brulee a la Vanille - vanilla custard, hard caramel crust\\nProfiteroles - choux pastry, vanilla ice cream, bitter chocolate sauce, almonds\\n\\nThe escargots (snails) and mussels are delicious.  Each dish comes in two sizes.  If sharing, I recommend ordering a dozen escargots and/or a small order of mussels for every 2-3 people.\\n\\nThe escargots are soaked in a super rich, garlic butter sauce.  I'm convinced the only reason the puff pastry exists is to help offset the heaviness of the butter.  The butter is so tasty I like to dip the table bread into it.  The escargots themselves are fresh and plump.  Each escargot has its own compartment on the serving platter and this version of escargots is probably the oiliest one I've had yet.  I could do without the breading, but with that much butter... maybe not.\\n\\nLike the escargots, the mussels are also quite fresh.  There's no fishy or briny taste, though you may occasionally run into bit of shell.  The white wine and cream sauce is light, yet full of flavor.  It's yet another fine sauce to dip bread into.  The thinly sliced and cooked shallots are delicate and provide additional texture.\\n\\nBoth the ribeye and the monk fish are specials not available on the regular menu.  I like having my steaks cooked medium to retain some of the meat's juiciness and flavor.  The ribeye was sort of a letdown because, while nice, thick, and hearty, it was still a bit too tough, despite the meat being slightly pink throughout.  I do like the generous portion size.\\n\\nI'm not sure what's up with the Cafe de Paris butter.  It's made out of 23 herbs, spices, and other ingredients.  It doesn't taste like butter, but more like a coarse, mustardy condiment.  Perhaps most of the \\"butter\\" part has melted into the ribeye by the time it hits the table, but even so, it didn't taste like it.  The ribeye is accompanied with a side of plain, thick French fries, which aren't bad.\\n\\nThe monk fish is a white fish that's light and subtle in flavor.  This dish is creamy because of the mashed potatoes and Parmesan cream sauce.  The sauce provides good flavor for the fish and gives the cooked spinach a creamed effect.  The mashed potatoes are soft and savory.  A bit of fennel sprouts are placed atop the fish.  This is a basic dish with not a lot of pizzazz or wow factor.  Not that a dish needs that to be good, but I was expecting more out of monk fish.\\n\\nConsider splitting the desserts with others.  The creme brulee is a nice dessert.  Smooth, sweet, and delectable.  I'm not a fan of the profiteroles because of the choux pastry.  It's bland, soggy, and lifeless.  Maybe the profiteroles I had sat out too long and the ice cream melted into the dough.  The ice cream and chocolate is fine, though.\\n\\nWhile the servers are friendly, service can be painstakingly slow.\\n\\nValet is $2 (gratuity not included)."},{"name":"Du Kuh Bee","address":"12590 SW 1st St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I have been wanting to try this place for the last couple years.

Last night, after I was denied food at Colosso, I decided to stop here on the way home for some take-out curry.  Boy am I glad I did. \\n\\nBai Yok sits in a little converted house on 82nd right next to a transmission shop and across the street from an Elementary school.  It's a little oasis in an otherwise transitional/industrial area.  The space inside is small, but they have a little patio outside that looks like it would be a really nice place to sit on a summer night and listen to the lulling sounds of 82nd.... well, anyway, I look forward to eating-in sometime.\\n\\nThe green curry I got was simply divine.  Like E-San used to make, before it went to hell.  A nice, hearty, perfectly spiced coconut milk and curry gravy with bamboo shoots, peppers, chicken, eggplant, and basil.  Not too thick, but not too thin... this porridge is just right.  Medium spicy = HOT, but perfectly so. I was sweating, but the heat did not overtake or shroud out the deep and complex flavor of the curry.  I could tell this was made with love. \\n\\nI decided to make a return visit today for some to-go lunch... with curry that good, I had to try the noodles.  OMG! The Phad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) are the best I have had in Portland, hands down.  The flavors of the wok combined with a distinct array of spices to provide that perfect mix of salty, fishy, chili, um yum goodness.  With a squeeze of lime on top and a pinch of fresh bean sprouts mixed in, this wide-noodle dish famous for being served late night to drunks in Thailand seriously made my day.  I will be returning often for the Phad Kee Mao. Nobody else in Portland can seem to get this one right. Thank you Bai Yok.\\n\\nThe only thing I guess I could complain about is the price for the lunch portion of the curry. The dinner portion is large, and for $9, is a deal. The lunch portion for $6.5 is not so big... and not such a great deal.  The noodles were plenty for the price. If I were going to come back for lunch curry, I would just order the dinner portion and pay the $3 more... you get twice as much for only an extra $3, and you could easily make 2 meals out of one portion.  \\n\\nI know I should wait until I have sampled more of the menu before giving this place 5-stars, but a sample of two very different dishes is enough for me to proclaim that I really, really like this place. It really should be a 4.5 stars, because the ambiance leaves a bit to be deserved, but because the food is so good, I am going to round up instead of round down.\\n\\nSo don't go to this place looking for a swank, 5-star atmosphere... go for the Thai food.

They even cut them in half and griddle them - which ramps it up to a perfect 10.  Only two negatives were service was a bit rushed and not very friendly - although we saw other tables were having a different experience so assuming it is the luck of the draw and the restrooms appear to have no AC - which could be a huge issue during the summer.

The bowl was gigantic, and the broth was outstanding.  The pork was out of this world delicious, with a very melty fat strip and some outstanding seasoning.  I was actually surprised by the volume of pork they give you as well; it was more than I was expecting by several pieces.\\n\\nThe veggies were a bit overpowering, though, and the pickled carrots, though delicious, threw off the overall flavor for me a bit in a slightly sweet way.

Sometimes, it has an amalgamous quality, but these were quite an exception.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the seasonal entree, the Korean meatballs.  These were also quite larger than expected, and also very delightfully seasoned and prepared.  I think it also suffered from an overabundance of vegetation, but there is no fault in the sheer quantity of food on the plate.  Also, the ingredients were very fresh and flavorful, so it's hard to call that a drawback.  I'd probably order this, honestly, that's how good it was.\\n\\nThe service was fantastic, and the server made some fine recommendations on both drinks and dishes.

They had a rope to tie your pup while you go in and order, a couple dog bowls and a water station outside which I really liked. \\n\\nBUT the MOSQUITOES... so Atlanta has mosquitos, everyone knows this. Especially this time of year. As soon as I walked onto the patio, no exaggeration, I didn't even get a chance to sit down before I was getting bit by mosquitos. By the time I ordered my drink and sat down, I had about 10 mosquito bites. There are soooo many ways to prevent this, from spraying outside so it prevents mosquitos in the first place, placing mosquito repellent plants outside, or even offering very inexpensive mosquito repellent bracelets outside for guests to wear while they're outside... so many options. If I'm paying $10 for a coffee or $12 for a smoothie, I expect the peace of mind I can actually sit and enjoy it without being attacked. \\n\\nSo yes go, but unless you wear bug spray every day, or carry it with you, plan on sitting inside."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Love the beer.

A strip mall very very far away from most in Austin.  \\n\\nI really should just give 5 stars for the calamari.  My wife was the first to introduce me to this tasty squiddy goodness years ago, but she hasn't had it since our San Francisco trip years ago, right before her gluten allergy diagnosis.  They were unfortunately out of all shrimp entrees, and a fish course.  The chicken stri.. errr... goujons would make \\"the Colonel\\" blush.  And when she saw chicken parm on the menu, she immediately salivated.  It did not disappoint, and as her favorite dish that is high praise.  The mac and cheese was also 5* worthy (and should be the side that comes with everything!  Mashed potatoes I can do at home).  The beignets are a satisfying crispy/gooey ending to the night.\\n\\nService was reaaaallly slow.  Maybe that's part of the European plan.  I've never had an app arrive before we ordered our mains.  Or maybe they were just slammed because of folks coming out for the nearby Willie concert.  Either way, we got there by 6:30, and spent about 2+ hours there.  Oh, and we almost didn't get a table.  I'll call ahead from now on.\\n\\nChef seems really personable, and obviously cares because this is a labor of love for him.  While we dined there, there were a few generations of his family dining there, including GF mom(-in-law, I think).   Staff was friendly, helpful with wines, etc.  I'm hopeful the decor is in a state of transition.  It is loud and echoey, and the opposite of intimate.  Facing a parking lot and a playground doesn't really lend to a fine dining experience.  Curtains and other things to soften the look might go a long way.  Heck, there's one blank wall with track lights spotlighting it. Partner with a local artist or two and get something hanging there!\\n\\nFor those who have severe allergies to gluten, this place is a invaluable. There is NO chance for cross-contamination.

I hate giving poor review especially since there are so few South Indian specific restaurants around greater Boston.. but the quality at this restaurant has gone down a lot, and I've been visiting here for many years. I'm not picky at all but there are minimum expectations in South Indian food - like the proportion of tamarind to sambar spice. Sambar is not tamarind soup. Madhu Vada is supposed to be light with smooth exterior texture. Oil used should be fresh. The medhu vada I ordered was dense and hard inside, and it's exterior surface texture could work great as an exfoliant. I ordered medhu vada and rava dosa. My heart is sinking like the medhu vada will .. waiting for what is going to happen to that quintessential South Indian dish - Rava dosa.\\n\\nEDIT: Rava dosa arrived after 40 minutes. They said it would take 20 but since me and my friend ordered one each .. 40 minutes seems about right. It was as dry as the bones of that T-Rex at British Museum. Rava dosa needs to be thin and crisp and when it is cold it chokes. It's a one star review and I'm giving two stars because their previous chefs were good and I enjoyed their food then.\\n\\nThis food is not South Indian.

All she wanted was a lobster roll by the water. Happy to say that she was very pleased with her food. But, other than that, we were definitely not overwhelmed at all by any other aspect. \\n\\n1) Lack of parking is a big down side. Street parking on the beach in the summer is very tough. \\n\\n2) Since it is the summer, it was fairly hot that day. No air conditioning in the restaurant made it very uncomfortable, not only for our party but others who apparently had mentioned something.

My grandmother was very happy with it and actually finished the full roll. She usually takes some home with her. \\nScallops with Parmesan shrimp risotto: The scallops were just okay. And the risotto was way too crunchy. Others who ordered the same confirmed this. The risotto should never have left the kitchen in that way. \\nCheesecake for dessert:  Not sure what type it was but, I don't think it should be listed in the menu as \\"chef's daily preparation\\".

Forgive me cause I have a ZZ Top beard) even though it is a few blocks away.\\n\\nThe Lady had the wedge salad and enjoyed it greatly. Based on a recommendation, I had the Green Chile Cheeseburger, cooked rare, with a side of Jalapenos to twitch it up a bit. Now we are talking my language. It came with fries and I opted for the 1/2 regular and 1/2 sweet potato fries. Good choice.\\n\\nWe did not have any booze and stayed with the simple life for our first visit.  I was surprised how much this place had changed from when we went there 3 restaurants ago.  We arrived at 1100 on the dot. We were seated immediately and our non-booze drinks arrived in minutes. As we had already looked at the menu, and based upon that and recommendations, I took time to take some photos of the inside and patio/bar.\\n\\nShortly thereafter, our food arrived, hot and in my case cooked perfectly. The Lady's wedge salad was nicely laid out and she loved it. My burger and fries were spot-on. It is to be noted that they have a list of every ingredient in everything served for reference on allergies, and for the first time a wait-staff person informed us correctly, but still said they would check again as the Lady is highly allergic to MSG. All was well. Our server was exceptional.  Drinks were refilled quickly and before we could even ask, without any additional charge.\\n\\nBy 1145 the place was full. The crowd was mostly slightly older than the hipster places and sports bars. By 1200 there was no more parking, except for the valet, which I believe is tip only.\\n\\nAs this was only our first visit, I have to put down 4 stars at this time as another visit is needed, try a couple of more items and most likely it will then jump up to five.

Only downside this visit was that we had to wait about 10 minutes after our reservation time to be seated. I understand because this restaurant is super busy on Friday nights. But it was still kind of bummer, especially considering our service for the rest of the night was on the slower side.\\n\\nMy first visit, we sat at the sushi bar and I would absolutely recommend the sushi bar over a table for a better experience. The dining area is much louder and you get a more personal experience and faster service at the sushi bar. For the drink I got a Moscow Mule and it's a basic but good! There are 3 tiers of Omakase here. I tried the Umi (currently $100) last time and tried the 2nd tier Miyabi (currently $145) this time. I liked the selections for the Miyabi more. But there isn't too much of a difference in the quantity of food. \\n\\nFor the Miyabi, I got\\n-Tuna Tartare: Amazing, really beautiful presentation. I love the sweetness of the fruit pieces in there. It complements it really well. The quail egg was a really wonderful touch. It comes in half a shell and they recommend you pour it on and mix everything up.\\n-Spicy Rock Shrimp: Really good but I was expecting more. But still really wonderful, creamy, and has a kick.\\n-Sashimi Plate: I loved all the selections. Salmon and toro are my favorites. The hamachi was wonderful as well. You really have to LOVE raw fish to finish this as it is a lot! Only one I didn't finish was the firefly squid. I personally wasn't a fan.\\n-Sea bass: So tender and flavorful. The decor was on fire as well so that was a nice touch. \\n-Nigiri Plate: I really, really liked this nigiri selection more than the Umi nigiri selection. 3 of them had caviar on top. My favorite is the sake (salmon) with aioli and caviar. Like I would do a lot of things to eat more of that. It was amazing and I'm still thinking about it. I enjoyed all of them. Probably liked the one with the shiso leaf the least. \\n-Lemon Pannacotta: I actually liked this one more than the black sesame pannacotta from last time. As it was tart and sweet at the same time. Bf preferred the black sesame one. This one had a smaller gold flake than last time. I love the gold flake as it gives it a nice presentation and looks wonderful! \\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed the selections for Miyabi more than the Umi. However, I preferred the bar experience more than the table. I liked talking to the chef and seeing them prepare it. I also felt like service was much quicker as at the sushi bar, we were given the next course as soon as we finished. At the table, we had to wait a bit between courses. Umi closes at 11:30, but we weren't served our final course or finished until 12 am. There were still some others left inside until that time as well. We are super quick eaters so we were trying to eat fast to compensate for the wait times between courses. We didn't want to keep anyone there after their closing time! \\n\\nThe wait times were a bummer, but we were always kept updated on the status of the courses so I felt the service was pretty friendly and communicative. Food is amazing as always. Many sushi places are actually not Japanese-owned, and this place you can tell is Japanese owned and they take quality seriously. Probably my favorite sushi place in Atlanta. \\n\\nAlso: parking is valet near Chops Lobster Bar! Across from Whole Foods. Walk up the stairs and take a left. Umi is the wooden door. Love the interior. Dim lighting. Sushi bar is more lit for better quality photos.

I have lived on the street close to two years, and this is my fav. spot to grab a beer in Austin, do Sunday brunch, and now enjoy pork ribs.  \\n\\nThe 200 beer selection is ridiculous.  Some of favs are Saint Bernardus and Pumpkinator.  I have some tips or feedback below that could help you out on your next visit as I frequent the establishment.\\n\\nThe Bangers Restaurant Food (Smokehouse BBQ review below) to me has been good, but never completely blown me away.  Come into happy hour for $5 brats and you can't lose.  Pretzel and Mac and Cheese are good.  Ask for there Sausage of the Month - they do some awesome stuff.\\n\\nThe brunch on Sunday is awesome come at 9:30-45AM or you run the risk not getting seated and then the wait balloons to 2 hours because everybody drinks Manmosas, watches the band, and doesn't want to leave.  Also if you do sit down for Sunday brunch try to place your order by the time the waitress first comes to take your drink orders - you will save at least 30 minutes because your orders will get caught up in everybody that is placing there orders at the same time.  \\n\\nYou can order directly from the Smokehouse BBQ then sit on the right side of the establishment, if you are facing rainey street, or stand and watch the band.  Getting early and sitting down is good if you plan on having a lot of people but if you are solo, or with under 3 people, I would recommend waking up later and just standing and eating.  Or finding a table on the right side which faces rainey street for great people watching.\\n\\nBusy Sunday Brunch: Last Sunday, I showed up at 10:45AM and it was already a 2 hour wait.  Also,I would try to not get a table directly in front of the band as it is way to loud to hear anybody on your table talking.  The best seats are 3 or 4 tables in front of the band.  The last tables by the BBQ pit are the ones you want.\\n\\nSMOKEHOUSE BBQ REVIEW (The Ribs): What is making me actually write this review is a shoutout to the BBQ Smokehouse that opened several months ago when they opened up the right side of the establishment where they have 100 more beers, private parties, and tables with no waiters.\\n\\nIn the Austin area, I have been to Franklins, Terry Blacks, La Barbeque, Louie Mueller, Coopers, The Salt Lick, SLAB BBQ, Kerlins BBQ, Micklewaits, Rudys, and Valentine's.  I love Terry Blacks for the moist brisket, but there pork ribs don't blow my mind.    My fav. pork rib in the city is now the Bangers Smokehouse.  \\n\\nThere Memphis sauce and even there spicy mustard go crazy good with the dry rub pork rib.  What I think elevates there pork rib status is basically its not like most places pork ribs that are heavily salt/pepper seasoned and greasy.  It is a dry rub that isn't supergreasy.  I don't know how they do it, but its awesome.  It makes you actually want to revisit because you aren't greased out for weeks on pork ribs.   Also, there sauce game is on point specifically the Memphis Sauce and the Spicy Mustard Sauce.  Load up on those pickles too!\\n\\nThere Bourbon and Coffee Bacon Steaks are awesome, and there flagship is there chopped pulled pork sandwich with a pork rind.  What makes this place great is how short the line is, it places you off Rainey Street with a great patio environment, and the brass band on Sunday is really the best place to do brunch in Austin right now.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and head to the smokeshop it is open 1PM Thursday and Friday; 11AM Saturday and Sunday.  They sell out of ribs fast so don't risk it just show when they open or close to it.  A whole rack of full sized ribs run 26$ which is around 15 bone ribs.  You can get 3 bone ribs for 6$.  I mean seriously that would run me like 11-13$ at some bbq places if they actually weighed it out!  The can be a wait, but Bangers patio environment, sauce game, and dry-rub non-greasy ribs has elevated this place to the best place to get pork ribs in the city.  Do not wait 1-3 hours to go get bbq only to go to Rainey later.  Do it all in one shot and still get the best ribs in the game.  Grab a beer too - you have 200 to choose from though.\\n\\nIf somebody that is ever visiting wants pork ribs more then brisket, but doesn't want to wait 45 minutes then this is a no brainer.  Take them to Bangers Smokehouse and enjoy the best patio, pork ribs, and beer selection available.\\n\\nOverall I would do the Smokehouse BBQ over the actual menu items.  The sides are good from the Smokehouse BBQ: Sweet Potatoe bacon, Mac and Cheese, Collard Greens and more.

We've gone round searching and hunting for bossam as delicate and tender as this for months so you don't have to. It melts in your mouth, the fat and pork is perfectly seasoned and comes with the right amount of sides to give it that lettuce wrap that extra oomph. The secret star of the night was the white fish and tofu soup, it was so clean that I'd rank it higher than So Hyang (and I love So Hyang). Dig around the bowl and you'll be surprised to find squid, clams, shrimp, egg and of course semi-firm tofu . Mr. Smol wouldn't leave until the bowl was empty despite being stuffed from the bossam. Finally their kimbap friends, oof I love me some good kimbap (probably even MORE than sushi which is hard cause I love me some quality omegas) is beautiful. Honestly speaking, it's the second best kimbap I've ever had at a restaurant. It was so delicious we ordered an extra to go even though we couldn't finish everything  for lunch the next day. We tried the traditional kimbap with beef and without (which substituted beef for imitation crab) and I'd recommend opting for beef over crab for an extra dollar. If anyone is going to @_samsoonie_  grab me some kimbap to go please . The meal was ~$68-70 after tip and tax which I would say is value. May I add we came in 1 hour before closing and the food still tasted .

The bibimbap stone bowl was nice and hot(be careful) and the gochujang provided at the table added a nice spicy touch. My bulgogi platter was filled with the most tender, well seasoned beef and perfectly cooked rice. The mandu(potstickers) were perfectly crisp.

There is a self serve water machine and tea dispenser with barely tea(a traditional Korean beverage that helps with digestion).

Simply put - I am easy to please. I require good migas (which can be hard to pull off), good house coffee and beyond edible tortillas. So when my friend proclaimed to know where to get some of the best migas in town, I was skeptical. This caf√© is worth the drive for you non northies. Neither one of us lives north and for my southie friend to drive up here JUST for this place, you know it must be good. And worth the wait. Because you WILL wait here. This business is not new, and yes it is in an uninspiring strip mall next to ACC. But do not be fooled by this. \\n\\nThis little caf√© is busting at the seams. We waited outside for maybe 30 minutes (do not let this scare you) for a table for 2, for quite a late breakfast. They sell all different varieties of coffee beans. Had the house blend of the day, which was the East Timor. My bottomless cup was divine! I prefer bold blends and this did not disappoint. I expect upon my next visit I will have to purchase some of their beans for the house. Also on my must try list are some of the vast array of other coffee drinks. \\n\\nThey serve breakfast all day. If you are not a breakfast person, there are plenty of other options which I will need to try next time I want something other than migas...which might be never for this creature of habit. I perused the menu and found many intriguing vegetarian options, along with other seemingly health-concious choices.\\n\\nThe service was friendly, the food is fantastic. I devoured my hashbrowns - probably my most favorite hashbrowns ever. They made them just the way I like: Deliciously crunchy & shredded. The ranchero sauce is the kind I REQUIRE for my migas. Only two other places in town that I have been to serve this kind (THE RIGHT KIND) with their migas. Thinly based, no chunks whatsoever, and the right amount of spice.

His Mother, my Ex also lives in Marietta and his older brother lives just east of Buckhead.\\n\\nCalled my Ex and asked if she was sitting down when I told her that Amy and I had made contact and it was time to bring everyone in. She and her BF, my wife and I met at Ruby Tuesdays in Marietta and I shared some of the emails that Amy and I had written each other along with some photographs.  Not only did we have a Daughter but a soon to be 10 year old Grandson we did not know about as well as a Son-in-Law.\\n\\nShe took the information and went home and made packets for each of the boys and I looked up Restaurants in the Buckhead Area.  Chris the son in Buckhead had to work that Sunday afternoon so it needed to be there.\\n\\nFound Joy online and we agreed to meet at 10:30 am.  The address that I had was an old address and we did not find it out till we got there but a couple of calls and we got the right address on Peachtree which was only a little under one mile.\\n\\nWe all got to Joy and parked in the garage behind and met on the front steps. They knew something was up but not sure so the level of tension was high.\\n\\nWalked in and asked for a table for 8. Took just a couple of minutes and even thought they were busy, we were seated in about 10 minutes which I thought was great service.\\n\\nThe 8 consisted on my Ex-Wife Louise, BF Norm, Eldest Son Chris, Youngest Son Brian and the two Grandsons, Dylan and Tyler and or course, my wife Susan and myself.\\n\\nMost of us started with either Coffee of Juice for the young ones. By The Way, the Coffee is outstanding.\\n\\nFrom around the table, we ordered quite a selection including Biscuits and Gravy, Breakfast Burrito, Build Your Own Omelet, Chicken and Egg and two orders of thick Bacon. The Grandson's got what they loved and that was Pancakes.\\n\\nWhile we waited for Breakfast/Brunch Louise the Boys and Myself adjourned to the benches out side where we could talk and hear each other.  Restaurant is rather loud\\n\\nI started the presentation with going back till when their Mother and I were in College and in love and things got out of hand one night and nine months later, a baby came into the world.\\n\\nBrian in shock and some anger, yelled out,  'You mean I've got a Brother or Sister out there somewhere?\\"  I calmly replied, her name is Amy and here is a folder that I want you to read when you calm down.\\n\\nHe was hurt, not by the fact that he had a sister but rather by the fact that we had not told him earlier which is understandable but there was never a good time to tell him or his Brother.\\n\\nNorm and Susan had entertained Dylan and Tyler while we were outside.\\n\\nTiming was excellent because within just a couple of minutes of coming back in, Breakfast came out.\\n\\nI had the Chicken and Egg and ti was excellent. I thing Susan had the Biscuits and Gravy another excellent choice.

They must have an incompetent manager, because these people were swamped and couldn't keep up.\\n\\nThey were proud to let me know that they did not honor happy hour prices in the dining room, only the bar!  WTF?!  Seriously?  It was a 10 minute wait every time I went to the bar.  It took 50 minutes for us to get our food.  I ordered the Irish Stew and others ordered salad, and pork tenderloin.  \\n\\nThe Irish Stew was a complete disaster!  I don't know what this chef was thinking, but, he fucked this dish up so bad.  Irish Stew is a very non-complicated stew.  It is based on root vegetables and either a Guinness broth or red wine.  I make this stew quite often.  I'm certainly not an expert in the kitchen, but, I can whip up a mean stew.  Mostly, this stew is popular with Lamb or Mutton.  I use Lamb, but, here in the good ole USA beef is more popular.\\n\\nThe stew came with beef, a runny broth, a few chunks of over cooked carrot, and, soda bread.  A friend of mine told me it looked like diarrhea.  I agree.  It was indescribably horrible.  The beef had that cheap greasy meat flavor that you can't get rid of.  I ended up throwing it up.  The only reason I ate it was because I needed food on the belly, and, it had taken so long to get the first order there was no way I was gonna wait for something else.\\n\\nThe pork tenderloins looked and tasted more like over dried chicken.  Everyone was disappointed with their food, which, made the night very uncomfortable.  Remember, this was my bff's last night, and, it went straight to Hell.  Luckily enough she has a garlic allergy, so, she is very restricted on choices. I got her a salad which was satisfying and tasty.\\n\\nI have no desire to go back to NXNW.  Not just because of the major disaster on St Pat's Day, but, also because I have been here several times before.  The food is always sub-par.  Nothing to make you wanna come back.

The steak sandwich my husband ordered had a fried egg, good quality strak and had a pepper and onion topping that stood out. The fries are very good here as well, though they are a dollar up-charge. The meals come with chips otherwise. You can also upgrade to a side salad for  $2 extra. \\n\\nThe beer list here is pretty large and had some less common options.

I quit ordering the burgers, but a close friend pines for them.\\n\\nI go back for my co-workers who dig it, but not as often as Pho Saigon, where I'm behind on rent (see previous review). \\n\\nFirst, NXNW is a brewery and restaurant, so you're missing out on half the offering if you don't DRINK THE BEER.. in my opinion, the better half. The lambic (cherry beer) is excellent. The burgers, the pizza, not so much. The spicy chicken sandwich: good but often dry. The lamb appetizer: great, but poor value. The skillet cornbread appetizer is entree-sized, so while tasty, I've had it once, and had to eat it myself and throw some away; it doesn't have the sex appeal to pass a vote among my dining companions for another go.\\n\\nThings to order:\\nThe beef tri-tip special on Thursday, the sirloin any time. Today I had the lamb (Friday special) for the first time, and though I approve of the sauce with golden raisins and the polenta, the lamb, while fair, doesn't eclipse the sirloin, which is essentially the same setup, cheaper, every day.\\n\\nThe co-workers are into the calamari appetizer and the fries. I don't see the point of the calamari, which tastes like fried batter, or fried batter and dipping sauce, but I acknowledge that I'm the outlier. The fries are very crisp (almost; correct answer: \\"pliable\\") and rigid with garlic (correct answer: \\"not covered with frickin' garlic\\"). \\n\\nAsk to sit outside on the back patio on pleasant days; feed the cat if he's still around. That's one lucky cat. Nothing special about the bloody mary, but for brunch the baked egg-and-bean dish (not shown on their internet menu) is decent, though you'll want to negotiate a hostage swap with someone who got the poached eggs with crab cakes.\\n\\nService has varied, but I'd say it's good on 4/5 visits. The cherry beer and the sirloin make for a good meal, also 4/5. Overall, the food gets a 3, the beer a 5, so I feel good about a 4 for NXNW. Think of it as a 5 overcooked and drowned in garlic.

We decided that next time we'll order one extra because there was way more curry sauce than bread and each roti was perfect for one person. \\n\\nLettuce Wraps (tofu): We LOVED these.

Their main dishes are always accompanied with the right sides-fresh vegetables, risotto, rice.\\n\\nFavourites:\\n\\nSALT SPRING ISLAND HONEY MUSSELS -chardonnay . tomato . shallots and fresh herbs. These fresh herbs that they're using really gives this dish a kick. Mussels are plump and fresh, and slowly simmered. \\n\\nTEMPURA PRAWNS -kabosu marinated ahi tuna. This came with several pieces of sushi. Not the best sushi ever, but decent enough. The prawns here are lightly battered, with a nice drizzle of mango vinagarette. \\n\\nWATERFRONT FRESH SEAFOOD CHOWDER -mussels . clams . fresh seafood . chorizo-Chorizo adds something different to the typical seafood chowder. This is almost like a bouillabaise. Highly recommended. \\n\\nDUNGENESS CRAB BISQUE -tarragon cream. Something different than the typical lobster bisque. \\n\\nSEARED WILD SALMON -wilted peppercress and arugula . tomato . roof top honey bacon, truffle vinaigrette. Can't go wrong with this dish. They do their salmon just right. \\n\\nROOF TOP HONEY ROASTED FREE RANGE CHICKEN BREAST -this will most likely be the best chicken breast you've ever had. The flavour of the chicken is retained, and it's juicy and tender. The light flavour of honey is infused within the meat. \\n\\nJUMBO PRAWNS AND SEARED SCALLOPS -applewood smoked bacon risotto. braised cavalo nero. My all time favourite dish. Jumbo prawns, with fresh seared scallops? Best thing ever. The scallops are always cooked just right, never overcooked. Risotto has slight hint of the smoked bacon flavour, cooked to the perfect consistency. A good portion too. \\n\\nDessert: I once tried this chocolate mint dome. For all you chocolate mint lovers-come here just to try this. You will not be disappointed. The perfect balance of chocolate and mint, all in one dome shaped treat. \\n\\nThey indicate which dishes are \\"Fairmont Lifestyle Cuisine\\", where they use nutritionally balanced ingredients. Also, they are part of the Ocean Wise program, which contributes to sustainable seafood.\\n\\n\\nWe also come here for Easter brunch. It's pricey but in my opinion worth every single penny. There's nothing like spending the Easter Sunday with great company and great food.  The food selection is always good, fresh salad, innovative On a sad not, they used to have crepes suzette station, made to order. They're the best I've ever had. Carmalized sugar, fresh orange juice, Grand mariner.....the sweet orange and warm crepes..with the liquid sugar oozing out...I'm salivating as I'm writing. \\n\\nFood is always fresh. Wine list is extensive. Service is great. Prices are a little higher, but you're getting your money's worth.  Always a treat."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I had a four hour wait for my flight, so wanted to get a decent breakfast. I checked out all the offerings and this sounded good - omelet platter with bacon and hash browns. I watched as they put together other people's order - in a styrofoam box with plastic silverware/napkin in a plastic carry bag. My order came up, so I grabbed my coffee and went to the back of the dining area. Opened the bag. No silverware or napkin. Had to go back up front for it. Opened the styrofoam container.

The trip itself was great because I got to see my friends from back East which also included my college roommate and mother.  Happy times! I had not quite decided on where I was going to have my official dinner party so I started looking upon my arrival.  \\n\\nI decided I was not going to do the standard steakhouse, seafood, etc; all of those I can get about anywhere or cook myself.  I decided on French. The few times I have had French cuisine I was pleased.  As I look through my fav reservation site I came across several options in various locations.  My favorite part of the greater Atlanta area is Buckhead so based on the location, reviews and menu I selected Bistro Niko. \\n\\nWe arrived and we were are pleased with the initial feel of the place.  It was trendy yet still managed to be upscale and not stuffy, perfect.  We were able to combine fine dining and fun.  Our waiter was a genuine Frenchman with a great attitude and very attentive.  My friend had trouble seeing the menu and our waiter brought out a box of assorted reading glasses for him to choose from so he could read the menu.  We ordered wine and appetizers to begin; the wine was kept chill in a bag full of ice vs the standard silver bucket; I liked the idea and will be using for my own parties.  The main courses we ordered were all perfect.  My mother had trouble deciding on her meal and the waiter helped her decided (very patient) and also told her if she was not satisfied to simply raise her hand and he would remove it and let her order something else.  He was a gem.  When her food came out he was so curious as to her response he stood away but kept and eye on her to see her reaction after the first bite.  Sure enough ass soon as she bit and swallowed he was right there to see what she thought.  She loved it.  \\n\\nThe other patrons around us were also very nice and chatty; in a good way.  And everyone looked good.  For entertainment Dwight from Atlanta Housewives was there in all his glory dressed like Prince taking pics with whomever asked.  I decided it was my birthday and I looked way more fab than he did so if any pictures were getting taken w him it would be because he wanted to take a pic with me.  ;-) \\n\\nAt the end of our dinner I was presented with a really cute birthday cream puff ice-cream thingy w a candle.  It was really yum and enough to be shared among the three of us.  Unfortunately one of my friends had an allergic reaction to something in her food and lost her voice and was a bit swollen.  But when she went to the restroom she ran into Dr. Sanjay Gupta. I told here she should have asked him for his opinion...that way we could also see if he was a real doctor, LOL.  \\n\\nOverall I had fun, food was good, atmosphere great, service excellent.

We did have to wait an hour and a half before getting seated, but I did know about the popularity of this place, especially for Sunday brunch. The good thing is that they do have an indoor waiting area where you can order drinks and three snacks: baked pretzels, jar of pickles, or pig skin. I'm not sure if the snacks are seasonal, but those were our options. Fun fact: I totally didn't realize that its a law that you have to order food with any alcoholic beverage before 12 PM! The pretzel was a pretty decent size and came with both honey mustard and a cheese dip which was pretty good. \\n\\nThe atmosphere of Banger's is great. They had live music which was awesome and just what I needed, playing awesome songs from J. Cole to Maroon 5. There was a huge variety of beers and wine to choose from, I believe our server said there were around 200 options! It was quite overwhelming to look through the various drink menus, but our server was great at helping me choose what I wanted- I ended up drinking a seasonal peach beer which was ok (keep in mind, I am in no way, shape or form a beer lover!). My friend ordered a drink called something around the lines of New Holland's dragon milk which I loved! It has such a strong flavor but it's so toasty and smooth, it kinda gave me a coffee flavor. Definitely something I did not expect to like. I also loved how they wrote where each beer was brewed on the menu. \\n\\nFor food, this is definitely NOT vegetarian friendly, but what do you expect? I ordered the chicken apple sage sausage which was phenomenal. Super savory and juicy with just a pinch of sweetness but not too overpowering. The fries were alright, nothing special. However, I was disappointed at the lack of biscuits on the menu, haha. \\n\\nOverall, this place gets 4 stars.

I used to live in Manhattan, where tasting menus were often an excuse for charging incredibly high prices, especially with paired wines.  But Staplehouse also had an a la carte menu, so we decided to forge ahead and see what happened.  Wow, are we glad we went!!\\n\\nFirst of all, the a la carte menu just went from one fabulous dish to an even better one.  The dishes are bigger than a tapa, but designed to share like tapas.  We started with a few vegetable appetizers (one of which was garnished with beef fat that was aerated into a whipped cream consistency) and ended with the amazing beef cheeks.  I knew I'd have to create a distraction so the my girlfriend could tilt the bowl up and lick the plate.  Fortunately, the waiter had seen the look in her eyes before and casually dropped off a dish of bread for sopping.  \\"No judgment\\" he said.  Embarrassment averted.\\n\\nWe were trying to be good about desserts (by not ordering them) but the only one on the list casually described: \\"chocolate, coconut, almond\\" and nothing else.  We were intrigued, and ordered one.  It was so freaking good!!  Like a deconstructed almond joy made by the hand of an angel, but...better!  The perfect finish to an incredible meal. \\n\\nWe are going back--soon--for the tasting menu.  And we'll go back agin and again.  What an amazing experience and in a terrific, chill setting.

The line does nothing but talk amongst themselves, with the quick \\"want black beans or pinto bleans?\\" and then are still not paying attention to you as they'll forget of have to ask you again. Today, the man who bagged up my tacos was having a full blown not work appropriate conversation with a girl 3 people down, took his sweet time bagging my food AND THEN basically tossed the bag in my direction without even looking at me.\\n\\nI've also tried avoiding these people all together and ordered online. The online ordering process itself is relatively smooth. I ordered my food 20 minutes before it said it would be ready. I walked down there and the cashier, same dimwitted blonde I've encountered too many times, said that she had no idea there were any orders waiting and then passive aggressively blamed the kitchen staff... awkward. about 40min after I had ordered my food it came out of the kitchen. After the bags were handed to me the blonde said \\"Oh, by the way we ran out of lettuce, I hope that's ok...?\\" First of all, that should have been mentioned earlier, secondly what kind of kitchen manager allows his restaurant to run out of lettuce during lunch when lettuce is generally a vital part of the food served....???????\\n\\nWhen I asked to speak to the manager, a man who was dressed and carried himself very poorly emerged from the back and had a very lax attitude about the whole thing.

For the record I was raised on good ol H.J. Heinz Tomato Ketchup and considered it the gold standard until I had Dai Due's Beet Ketchup. I'm not sure how they make it because #1 I didn't ask and #2 I really don't care.

There wasn't really enough meat either where I felt like I was getting a proper portion of protein. On the flip side though the sauce combination in the Teriyaki bowl was amazing. If I was a rice person I would have devoured it because every bite was scrumptious. The salads though are pretty good and truly do represent the idea of fresh and healthy. Normally though they add a little too much dressing so I ask for it on the side to prevent the overload.

The sandwich was like you'd get in Japan, with the egg cooked on the softer side and the cutlet doused with a good dosage of bulldog/tonkatsu sauce.

Heard rave reviews about the lamb, so I got a grain/greens bowl with the braised lamb, harissa, tzatziki, and red pepper eggplant dips, lots of veggies, and the green harissa sauce and sriracha yogurt sauces.   \\n\\nThe bowl overall is a decent amount of food.  A bit less than Chipotle, but seems like slightly higher quality ingredients.  The lamb was good, but not really discernable as lamb and tasted more like pulled beef, the portion was quite small, especially considering the upcharge for it.  The chicken looked awesome and more flavorful and satisfying having been grilled and I think I'd give that a try next time.   The sauces were put on pretty sparsely, and could definitely have used a bit more of those at the end.  The grain/greens base is a bit on the blander side, but filling.\\n\\nThe harissa was quite spicy and flavorful which I really liked, and the dips were good, but also portioned quite small.  Pita was average, and not really as good as I hoped.   A bit dry around the edges.\\n\\nOverall, it does feel like a healthier, slightly more expensive and fairly flavorful mediterrannean style chipotle.

Comparable to Ray's on the River. The front is your traditional restaurant with heavy wood and glass frames. At the door is the hostess, where you check-in for your reservation. There is a full bar near the entrance. And you walk through the bar to the rest of the dining area. It's smaller than Ray's on the River. The view is AMAZING. The back is facing the river. Literally on the water - you can even splash water. The area to the water is a small patch. There's outdoor seating or a tent to host outdoor party. Well lit at night. Now back to the indoor. It's surrounded by glass windows with wooden frames. I really dig such traditional look. Old and classy. Dimly lit. The tables are closely packed. It's very busy and buzzing noise of conversations and everyone having a good time. If you see my other reviews, you'll see that I don't rave about the ambience as much as I have for Canoe. That tells you how impressive their ambience is! \\n\\nTbh, the 4 star is for ambience. For food only I would rate them 2 or 3. I feel guilty because everyone I know just simply LOVED canoe. But for me, it was all about the ambience and not much for the food. But then again they change their menu very often, as per our server, so there's a chance the night I went the chef was just not feeling it. However, I compared our menu with the online version and 80% of the food choices matched. So, I would say give it a shot to find it out for yourself. \\n\\nReview: As I said, food was basic for the price charged. Let's start with the drinks - the rock on the mountain was a bourbon drink. It was strong! So was on the line. So the drinks are good. \\n\\nBecause it was Valentine's Day/night, it was so busy that we waited around in the bar as our table was not ready by our reservation time. We hadn't even get ourselves seated and our server was rushing us to place our order for appetizer, main course and desert. They had so many people waiting that it felt very commercial and business for them and no nice service. I would expect the restaurant management to not over-reserve. Also, after so many years they would know how to prepare for special nights. So, that sure was a turn-off. We had gone to enjoy and our table was not ready until 40 mins after our reservation time and we were being rushed. \\n\\nNext, server comes in with a basket of fresh bread that's made in the house. But wait - you can't have the basket of bread, you pick which one you want and they give you a slice! So, you are spending good money here and they won't spare an extra piece of bread. That was odd! \\n\\nFor appetizer we had calamari. Well seasoned and deep fried with bok choy and other veggies. This was the best item. \\n\\nThen cane my steak. The only option was filet mignon. I like ribeye. I'd like options to pick the cut of meat I want. They lost me there. My steak was okay. Nothing to brag about quality or differentiating their steak from other steak places. It came with mashed potato. I don't know about you, but I like mashed smooth buttery mashed potato. I don't like clumps and my mashed potato had a Strong smell of potato like it hadn't been boiled all the way. Steak also cane with green beans. Can we get some classier veggies - like asparagus? So, steak was below par. \\n\\nThen let's talk about the seafood pasta. It was dry. Lacked flavor and sauce. Also below par. \\n\\nBut I must give credit to the other server, who took us in the back and took pictures. Very nice guy! \\n\\nAll in all, spend a special day over at Canoe with your loved ones and enjoy the view. But don't expect the food to blow your mind off.

We simply went for fondue since we know she can have the gluten free sausage and fondue. When we ordered we asked the waiter to separate the bread from the sausage and bring a separate bowl to put some of the cheese in and explained why it was necessary. When he asked us if we were ordering anything else we said nothing more at the moment. He curtly said 'ok' with a sarcastic smile on his face effectively pissing me off immediately and made my sister feel awful for something she has no control over which pisses me off even more. \\n\\nThroughout the meal he was rude and when he brought me another water I said thank you and he just turned around without looking at me or saying a thing. Fed up I got up and talked to a manager about how he was curt with us but with every other table he felt he could get a big tip out of because they'll have a larger bill he was all smiles and jokes. \\n\\nShe said how she was surprised because he's been here since the restaurant opened, I'm sorry but that has no effect on how good of a waiter someone is! He's been there way too long and if I'm the first person to speak up about his attitude then that's just sad. But then again, this place is just sad now so maybe it works."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The food is really great here, and everyone is very nice.

Willys Woodfired Pizza & Pub","address":"Progress Ridge Townsquare, 12345 SW Horizon Blvd, Ste 61","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2.5","text":"I love the concept & really want  to see this succeed as it is in my backyard.  It is located in the trendy Progress Ridge shopping area  (It's right across from Big Al's - which I am also set to review soon).  \\n\\nThe development houses a bunch of nice little shops, a Cineteopia and a New Seasons as well as, well, a bunch of places I haven't gone to quite yet.\\n\\nI have wavered between 2 stars and 3 stars because if you compare this place to the  other places nearby (Big Al's, Vinetopia, Fudruckers and such) it is the cream of the, er, crop.  Don't forget this is a pricey part of Tigard/Beaverton being the back side of Bull Mt.  I've tried it a total of 4 times since I began this review (I am fast to try it, slow to write it) and I am definitely sure it is......DRUM ROLL.....between 2 and 2.5 stars.\\n\\nDarn it!!  I see so much here, want to be more than just the DUCHESS of this place at 4 measly visits, but I can see they need to address some important things.\\n\\n1ST VISIT:  My fiance and I stopped in for a mid eve dinner (715pm).  Professional and attractive staff.  Bustling night with sun peeking in the floor to ceiling windows that face the reservoir.  \\n\\n1ST IMPRESSION:  SOME SERIOUS MONEY WAS PUT INTO THE PLACE\\n\\nWe were seated close to a sunny window - a too sunny window if you can believe that - so bad I had to ask to be moved as the shades didn't block the sun from the table.   No biggie, still quite excited to be here.  The manager tried to pull down a shade, but it didn't cover any of the light, so we moved.  \\n\\nMenus were presented, choices were perused and eliminated.  Quite pleased with the menu, though some descriptions were a bit vague (weird flatbreads).  But the choice for starters was done - Bacon Wrapped Chorizo Filled Jalapenos won out!   The price was a 12 dollars crazy for only 4 of these tasty (HOT) treats!  Still, would pay the price to enjoy them again.  The cider/balsamic reduction that is drizzled over these little babies is really yummy, too.  Wow, this is looking pretty decent.\\n\\nI asked the friendly (but quite new - 2nd day) waiter if he had any recommendations, but he was unable to help.  So I went with a Chicken Marsala with fresh roasted veg and pasta.  The dishes both were well presented and freshly made. Too bad his arrived 5 minutes before mine. \\n\\nBUT - It looked so good I forgot all about the delay.\\n\\nLet me tell you, the veg part of my dish was incredible - fresh brussel sprouts (I adore!) mushrooms and more seasoned and roasted to perfection.  The chicken was cooked perfectly - tender & moist - and it was such a let down that the Marsala sauce was SO sweet (waaaay waay too much Marsala) such that I was not eating at all and my partner was thoroughly enjoying his.  I tried to just eat it but I could not.  Dan asked for the manager (same guy again) and I explained my predicament -the very excellent quality the side components of the dish, but it seemed that no one tasted the sauce before it was sent out.  The manager said he was a trained chef and he knew that their sauce was too sweet - ? - if you know why wouldn't you change it?  \\n\\nHowever, he was apologetic and the second order I placed was good - fish tacos - fresh, flavorful - quality, but not fantastic.  Price were uneven - some too high, but service was friendly.   We overall had a nice night and if I had written my review then I would probably have given it 3 stars.  But, instead, I went back again 3 more times (I so want to like it, I really do) and each time there was some LARGE oversight mixed in with otherwise good things. (LARGE OVERSIGHT examples:  Sitting in bar and being ignored by 3 employees and 1 manager to the point that I had to get out of my seat and walk the five feet to the bar to place my order!.  Diff visit - waiting 15 minutes for a takeout box for my leftover pizza and being given a tiny box that wouldn't hold 1 piece?  I had to wait another 5 minutes for the correct box.   A seeming inability to pull off one service for me and my dining companions (a varied group) without some sort of hitch.  Each time it went terribly wrong I ended up talking to the same manager - who acts like he's never met me before?\\n\\nI get the feeling that the manager/staff could use some training and a lot more spot checking (tasting - please taste) would really help this place reach it's potential.  If they got it together I can easily see a four star rating, but I find this place frustrating because I see how much money and time the owner has invested and the lack of polished execution is what will keep it from succeeding expectations.    Please pay attention to the details.  They really are what make or break you.  Given the price point, the consistency and service needs to improve."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Very friendly waitstaff.

Not the perfect space with reviews (who is) and has a great collection of items (I also have been craving hot dogs) so I was excited to order through Yelp (first time doing that too). After hearing a friend speak of a bad experience using Doordash I should have understood what the cosmos was telling me. Placed the order at 12:47 and called 14:09 to find out the order was not submitted through delivery.com who contracted another courier system (4th entity in the process) for ordering and delivery. I called the number provided from delivery.com for contacting Jake's regarding the order.....I think the call center was international (yeah creating jobs?). Whomever was answering their phones was flustered and should not be in that position. The gentleman shared he was the only person taking calls for the delivery system, unfortunately the operator was not well versed in the skills of exaggerations as I asked if that was a feasible excuse for an order placed over an hour ago. As one would guess, there was no reply to that. I asked if the gentleman could cancel the order as he seemed confused on how to complete that process, so I ended the call quite frustrated and still hungry. Call to delivery.com to share my experience with them through Yelp, ball was passed to the \\"local\\" vendor, asked (no I demanded) for a prompt refund (thank you PayPal for looking after your customers).

It's smothered with mustard and an overwhelming thick hot dog bun. The bread sorta ruins the experience of eating it. We also ordered jalape√±o Mac and cheese which was a good side, but nothing crazy. The poutine was great but a let-down, it's not like actual poutine because it lacks the cheese curds.

I sat at the bar which is just around the kitchen and I loved the experience. As the place is famous for their hand pulled noodles, I got the hand pulled noodles with tofu and veggies! \\n\\nIt did take a little bit for the food to come out but it passed by really nicely over some warm sake and chefs-watching. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the flavor was excellent! I'm sure I will be returning back here soon to try more items on their menu!"},{"name":"Du Kuh Bee","address":"12590 SW 1st St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"I felt like I had left Oregon. Quaint, full of people eating exotic food ( ok, it was squid), with wonderful smells, and a busy, crazy kitchen.Just watching the people in the kitchen work made our visit a happy one.\\n\\nWhat an awesome little place. \\n\\nWe lucked out and walked right in and got a table, no wait, on a Saturday night about 6:30 after a long day of soccer. We also parked on the street right in front of the door.\\n\\nI felt like karma was smiling on us. \\n\\nWe were HUNNNNNNNNNNNNNGRY. \\n\\nYeah, I know everyone else has reviewed it. I don't care, I want to too. \\n\\nI do have a warning, if you have kids with you who are not always up for spicy food, make sure you stress the \\"NOT SPICY\\" part, we felt like we had, but all of our food had some heat. Luckily, Princess rallied, but she drank a TON of water. \\n\\nOur verdict?\\n\\nBraised pork shortribs:A+. Come with onions, mushrooms, sauce. YUM. Hubby groused about the bones but I noticed he ate more of these than I did. \\n\\nChicken Noodles: A- ( I agree with others, skip the chicken, it's about the noodles, a minus for two slivers of chicken, maybe three). Chewy goodness.\\n\\nPork Dumplings: A +succulent, delicious. Our kid was like, WHAT IS THAT with great and embarrassing suspicion, but after she ate one she lunged at the others. Fortunately there are 9 on the plate.\\n\\nSpicy Cucumber Salad: B ( too spicy, it about killed us, maybe we're wussy, but too hot for gringos even  us spice eating gringos, although I pondered that if we'd had beer it might have gone better for us). It was beautiful to look at, but we couldn't finish it, way heavy on the chiles. \\n\\nRice: Necessary, A ( needed for Pork Shortrib\\"s  delicious precious liquid, which initially ended up on my shirt, and I tried to lick it off... ok, not really, but I could have if no one was looking, the rice was a nice way to scoop that up).\\n\\nThis was fun. At first, Princess was like ,\\" EWWW yucky, EWWW spicy\\" ( and I frankly wanted to kill her, ok, not really, but she annoyed me) but then she caught sight of  the man pulling noodles and got a cute little spoon to eat her rice with and was busy stuffing dumplings in her mouth, and she settled in. Thank heavens. ( Oh,ok, I will admit it. We promised her some mudslide ice cream and Dr. Who when we got home and that totally helped). \\n\\nAs we left, passing the line of grateful people waiting outside ( yeah, a table freed up!), she reflected,\\" that was a decent adventure, mom\\". \\n\\nCool. \\n\\nP.S. our  cute little water bottle was frozen solid but they were quick to bring us a new one and made sure it was full the whole time, which was a good thing. They also brought my kid a fork when I thought she wanted one. ( turns out she didn't and made a good attempt with the slippery chopsticks, but I liked how they handled that request and all of our others so efficiently)."},{"name":"Mission on the Bay","address":"141 Humphrey St","city":"Swampscott","stars":"3.5","text":"Good food, great views, & solid service.

And waited. We looked upon what was supposedly \\"ice cream\\" but it looked more like fecal matter, if you ask me. Regardless, the ice cream fell on the counter to which this villain of an employee responded with picking it back up and placing it onto my dogshit ice cream. I asked for a 'to go' cup and the incompetent employees were incapable of even doing so.

However, they specifically created an individual 3 course menu that was offered between January 15th to February 3rd at $30 per person. And since KTBs was an amazing hit, the restaurant decided to keep the concept of a 3 course menu that will be based on seasonal ingredients in addition to their shared plates! Prices are set to $42 per person and on Wednesdays, only $30 per person! Could you ask for a better hump day treat?\\n\\nCASTAWAY $19\\nOne of the signature drinks consisted of coconut rum, grapefruit aperitif, lime, olive brine, pineapple foam and a message in a bottle. This was a light and refreshing cocktail, the novelty was super cute and it definitely brightened up our rainy evening. Castaway was one of those drinks that you want to keep ordering and ordering!\\n\\nLOLLIWOOD NORTH $13\\nAnother signature drink consisted of a glass of joieblend noble blend, lychee liquor, elderflower and a cranberry popsicle. Yes, a cranberry popsicle! Again, this was another novelty drink that tasted great.  \\n\\nLARB AFFAIR\\nOne of the two available appetizers was the ahi tuna ceviche with roasted rice, kefir lime oil and rice paper crisps. A fusion of Thai and Latin American, the fresh ceviche was well executed and there was a nice kick from the chilli as well as a good balance of acidity. I really enjoyed the rice paper chips too.\\n\\nA DIFFERENT BEET\\nThe other appetizer was the beet carpaccio. The perfectly thin slices of beet were sweet and tender, and paired well with the small dollops of orange cashew cream. In additional, the sweet mandarin oranges brightened up the dish and there was a nice crunch from the pepitas.\\n\\nBELLY-TO-BELLY 3.0\\nOne of the entrees we chose was the br√ªl√©ed kakuni smoked pork belly. And honest to truth I am not a fan of ordering pork belly at a restaurant because from many of my previous experiences, it was rarely well executed. Although in this case, the pork belly tasted AMAZING. The pork belly was well rendered and melted in the mouth, including the lean portion. On top of that, the smokiness was just right and did not overwhelm. The side of kabocha rice tasted very flavourful with the buttered salted egg yolk as well and the pickled apples along with daikon were a refreshing touch.\\n\\nUNI-VERSAL PASTA XO EDITION\\nThe other entree we chose was the sea urchin pasta served with house xo saut√©ed prawns, which was uni heaven. The al dente squid ink pasta had a nice bite, chewiness, and soaked up the rich sea urchin cream. I especially like how you can taste the squid ink in the pasta too. There was also plenty of ooomph with the addition of tobiko and nori, and when you pair it with XO saut√©ed prawns it was definitely a Hong Kong and Japanese fusion plate. As for the buttery prawns, it was perfectly cooked, exhibited a nice snap, and the xo was on point. We made sure there was nothing remaining on the plate, not a single drop!\\n\\nOther options for entrees are Cheeky Business: star anise braised beef cheeks and Buried Treasure: miso braised vegetables (cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts and broccoli).\\n\\nLUV U SO MATCHA\\nFor dessert, one of the two options was the matcha cheese tartlet (also available in full size for additional $5.00). The buttery tartlet exhibited a nice crunch along with a rich matcha cheese filling that consisted of just the right amount of sweetness. The raspberry coulis was a nice combination as well and more places should offer it, who else is over the matcha and red bean mix?! There was also a crispy element from the white chocolate pearls.\\n\\nPOT OF GOLD\\nThe other dessert option was a dark chocolate pot de creme with lemon Chantilly and wild blueberry compote, which was rich as well as decadent and did not overwhelm. I loved the additions of in-house honey combs for that hint of extra sweetness too.\\n\\nIf you could not tell, I truly enjoyed every plate. And it is rare for me to enjoy every single dish at a restaurant. The Rise Eatery is an underrated restaurant in my opinion and when looking at their regular menu, even the prices are a steal! How could I have not known of them before? From the food puns and nicely thought out menu to well executed food, I could not stop raving about The Rise Eatery for like weeks after my visit and would actually be back!\\n\\nPOSITIVES \\n- Carefully thought out dishes\\n- Well executed food\\n- Great prices\\n\\nNEGATIVES \\n- Like usual seasonal items, some dishes will only be available when in season"},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Went there for my birthday and would never go back.

Not wanting to be rude, I agreed to go along and decided I'd just politely keep my opinions to myself.\\n\\nBoy, was I pleasantly surprised! We got the meat platter, which has brisket, pulled pork, ribs (both beef and pork), and chicken. Everything was absolutely delicious...seasoned well, nice and smoky, and tender to the point of falling off the bone. Our platter was supposed to feed 4-5. We had a hungry party of 5, and had enough leftovers to eat again the following night. \\n\\nThe bbq sauce was delicious...tangy and not too sweet, and served on the side (as it should be, in my opinion...too many places smother everything in sickly sweet sauce). For sides we were served cornbread, hush puppies, cole slaw, beans, and fries. All were delicious and prepared to perfection, my favorite part being that the cornbread and hush puppies were only lightly sweetened (but served with honey butter for those who like more sweetness).\\n\\nSadly, I had to leave Vancouver yesterday, and I don't know when I'll be able to return.

This past week, I left the office early and had nowhere to be fast - Mr. Grill was my only stop that afternoon.  I hold a high standard for taco trucks, thanks to being baptized into the food truck world by some incredible people on the west coast. Because of this, I was a bit skeptical walking up to Mr. Grill. It's a food truck called Mr. Grill in the corner of a used car lot on Georgesville Rd. You know what they say - books & covers and whatnot. My reservations quickly dissipated when I noticed two gentlemen of Latin ethnicity devouring a pile of what looked like authentic Mexican tacos on a table to the side. Giddy up.  \\n\\nFirst impression at the truck - very solid menu with about eight varieties of tacos, including carne, pollo, carnitas, al pastor, and lengua, as well as 10-12 other of the usual staples (burritos, quesadillas, tortas, tamales, etc). They accept cash only, which is a negative for me. I know some people wave this as a flag of \\"old school\\" or \\"authenticity,\\" but in today's world and the plethora of flexible & portable card readers, some soft of digital payment platform is a must. The truck also carried several posters/flyers for future events where I assume the truck will be present. Most notable - a poorly-designed flyer for a Mexican-themed rodeo of sorts. This is my kind of place. \\n\\nI wanted to get something that would give me a sense of the quality on my first visit to Mr. Grille and went with a couple of tacos al pastor, which is a very old Mexican pork preparation with strong Middle Eastern (namely Lebanese) influences - if that makes sense.  It's great for sampling the quality of tacos because it has to be prepared just right to maintain proper moisture, has a very particular & intense flavor profile, and requires careful balance with the other ingredients. Total cost of my two tacos al pastor was $3.00.  THREE FREAKING DOLLARS!  Bargain City. The woman who took my order, I assume was the owner/operator, and was what you would expect from a taco truck - polite with a sense of urgency. \\n\\nIt was a random time of the afternoon, so it wasn't overly crowded and only took a few minutes to get my tacos. I hated refusing sauce, but I wanted to try the tacos in their basic form, so as not to mask mediocre tacos with great sauce or the inverse.  Anyways - shut up and get to the point already.\\n\\n\\nTORTILLA: appeared to be a 4-5\\" white corn tortilla, warmed on a flat top\\nA quality tortilla should never be the focal point - it's a vehicle to carry the passengers. It should be light, soft, and just the right amount of char from warming on the grill, pan, or flat top. A great tortilla should go unnoticed with a good taco, while a bad tortilla will quickly rear its ugly head. This was just about spot-on.  Light, soft, not too big, not too small, and warmed perfectly.\\n\\nTHE MEAT:  pork, prepared al pastor style\\nThe pork was extremely moist and exploded with flavor. Executed wonderfully; very tender. Strong flavors coming through - lots of garlic and adobo. I do wish there was more trace of pineapple. Regardless, the pork was very good.\\n\\nSECONDARIES: lettuce, sliced tomato, quartered lime, and radishes.  \\nLettuce appeared to be iceberg, which is pretty meh, but it was fresh and crisp. \\nTomato was a thin half-slice in lieu of diced and was a nice surprise - very fresh and clean. Sliced radish was the real winner. Perfect addition & a dead giveaway on authenticity.\\nI'll definitely add some of their pickled onions next time, as I think those are a must on tacos.\\n\\nTHE SAUCE: I believe they had both a chile rojo and a verde sauce\\nAgain - I passed on these so I could get a better taste of the tacos themselves. I'm a sauce freak and will not likely do that again. The red sauce looked to be a smoked chile and tomato-based sauce and the gentlemen at the table may have eaten it in a soup bowl if permitted. Another patron asked for the verde, which I believe was either a more mild-to-medium tomatillo or avacado sauce.\\nEDIT:  They have a smoky rojo sauce - likely chipotle-chile based, which I would describe as medium heat, a verde tomatillo sauce, which is mild, and an creamy verde avacado sauce, which is surprisingly hot.\\n\\nThe Good:  The food, the menu, the authenticity, the stuff that is most important.\\nThe Bad:  Cash only and the parking is very limited.\\nThe Ugly:  Nothing.\\n\\nOverall - this was a hit and I'll surely be back. While the name doesn't scream \\"authentic Mexican taco truck,\\" the menu, the ingredients, and the preparation certainly do. I will be going by that area later today and would be shocked if I don't stop for some la lengua tacos.

After eating here five times, I can say eating here makes me a very happy person and every time I go, I leave feeling better about the world.\\n\\nJust as Americans once thought that Mexican food was tacos and burritos, too many now think that Japanese food is a dragon roll and a slab of tuna on a ball of rice.

If you do desire the more common rolls and sushi you have seen elsewhere, they do have that as well, but I implore you to experiment.\\n\\nThe only reason I didn't go 5 stars is that the service and dining room arent quite at the level that a 5 star establishment needs to provide.

Everything was spot on. I don't usually like cheese, but it somehow paired so well with the ribs in an addicting way, giving a rich and full satisfying taste. Noodles weren't too salty (my pet peeve) and were cooked perfectly. The noodles tasted even better with the ribs. \\n\\nTotally try the alcohol when you visit too. I was so into that plum wine that I tried to find it at a Korean supermarket market right after (I'll save you a trip; they don't carry that brand). \\n\\nI can't wait to come back. The price is a little high for casual eats, but I feel like the dishes are well worth it. Definitely will try to visit again on an off day so I can skip the line."},{"name":"CAVA","address":"515 Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I wish the my had CAVAs where I am from!!

It's a no frills spot but the service and food were on point. I am giving this place 5 stars despite our order of fried okra not being put in. The server was apologetic and we didn't need the okra after all. I ordered the 3 piece dark with baked beans and collard greens and my sis got the 3piece dark with bakes beans and potato salad. The sides were yummy- they had some of the best baked beans I've ever had. Definitely worth trying. The chicken was just so damn good. It was flavorful, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and the perfect level of spiciness for me. It was a bit too spicy for my sister but she still loved it!\\n\\nThe establishment was clean and more spacious than I thought it would be.

They weren't very busy but it's probably because the sign said closed even though they weren't. We had the pulled pork pancakes & the brisket Hash, both of which were delish. The 3-stack pancakes were fluffy and not sweet & there were pulled pork between the stacks. The brisket in the hash was tender and smoky.

There was about a 5 min wait for 4 people, not bad on a holiday weekend. After our waitress took our drink orders, she brought two small places of baked goods. The mini double chocolate chip muffin was particularly tasty. Based on reviews, I ordered Shrimp & Grits, which lived up to my high expectations. Only (minor) complain is that the tails were still on the shrimp. I understand keeping the shell probably helps with flavor while cooking but when eating it with grits, having the tail on can get a little messy (I'm pretty good with splitting off shrimp tails with my knife and fork but could only use the plate they brought the muffins on and because the shrimp were already covered in grits, it left grits covered tails all over our shared plate, which wasn't ideal).\\n\\nMeanwhile, My husband got the pancakes with a side of bacon. He really enjoyed the pancakes but the bacon was baked so if you're like us, you'll think it only mediocre. His brother got the biscuit and gravy, which he loved but couldn't finish because it was a huge portion. I had a bite and I can see why it's so popular--create combo of ingredients. My sister-in-law got the avocado toast, which she said is one of the top 10 brunch dishes she's ever had. I had the bite and the avocado was very fresh and well seasoned (the dish was also a nice, light choice for those looking for something a little different). Her egg was poached to a medium, which she didn't ask for but liked because she doesn't like her eggs too runny. We all also got coffee, which was good. Finally, service was fast and efficient.\\n\\nNet net, one of my top 3 fav brunch places in Atlanta."},{"name":"Mission on the Bay","address":"141 Humphrey St","city":"Swampscott","stars":"3.5","text":"Always reliable for a good piece of fish or steak.

I was hesitant to go because this Gator's always disappoints, especially because I live by the Gators in Waterford Lakes and it is always great. However I decided to go to see some old friends and it was Wednesday so they had all you can eat wings. \\n\\nWhen we first got there there was no parking near by and had to park in the parking lot next door and when we tried getting Into the restaurant it was completed packed outside in front of the door. I couldn't tell what was going on but there was a huge crowd doing something that Gators was sponsoring and we had to go through the mess to get inside. I have no problem with them doing events and what not but just poor logistics on their part.\\n\\nNow for when we finally managed to squeeze in. We met up with our friends who already had a table. We put in drink orders as soon as we could but didn't receive our drinks for about 10 minutes. And we didn't even get to put in our food orders during that wait. Our server forgot my soda completely. It was difficult to get our servers attention and she rarely came to the table. We put in orders for all you can eat wings and waited 25 minutes before asking our waitress why we were waiting so long when the tables next to us came after and yet had their orders. The service continued to be slow and very disorganized.\\n\\nSo sum up I would not recommend this Gators. While they have great deals it is not worth the service. The ambiance is loud and you don't feel like you're cared about. Definitely will be visiting the Waterford Lakes location next time."},{"name":"Stella Public House","address":"1905 Aldrich St, Ste 110","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"$8 bucks for a bomb pizza and beers on draft as cheap as $3 during happy hour all day Monday. \\n\\nWhat's not to love? \\n\\nSounds like this place went through some growing pains earlier but when we went yesterday night the food was on point.\\n\\nI got the Bee Sting and my friend went with the Prosciutto Arugula.

I loved the potato pur√©e. It was soooooooooo good.\\n\\nI wanted a light not too filling dish and so I got recommended to get the Steak Au Poivre. This dish was very lite and filled with an equal balance of meats and veggies. I loved it. It was simple and delicious. What made this unique was a hard crispy layer of pepper.

I've tried the Tom Yum Noodle Soup and Boat Noodle Soup (both have flavorful broths) as well as the Sukothai (I do agree that it feels like it's missing some oil or some kind of sauce but hey this is the only place in Boston I know that serves this dish and it's also pretty Instagrammable). \\n\\nDuring my most recent visit, I decided to get the duck breast just cuz I was impressed by the presentation when the party next to me got it. I have a picture of it attached to my review (look at that how nice that looks ). The food tasted as good as it looks. The soft boiled eggs were marinated properly, the broccolini was roasted nicely, and the duck breast was good too. The wait staff was also nice and gave me some veggies when I said I didn't eat rice. \\n\\nFor me, Cha Yen easily reaches that tier of high quality Thai restaurants in Boston. It's a place you can bring a date to or bring some friends from out of town to. It's not mind blowing (hence the four stars) but I haven't found that 5 star Thai restaurant just yet."},{"name":"The Lansdowne Pub","address":"9 Lansdowne St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Horrible experience here.

I have now eaten here three times, and each of those times has left me feeling slightly ill. It's definitely shame on me, but the location and feel of this little smokehouse is so cool I kept wanting to give it another shot. I ate here today for my third time, and even asked for my brisket to be lean. They said it was no problem, but 1/2 of the meat they served me was nasty fat. On my first review I commented on the fried okra not being good, however this time it was good. The unfortunate part is that it is now 4 hours after my lunch, and once again my stomach is upset. I really wanted to like this place because it's in a great little town, and like I said earlier, it's got such a cool little vibe.   Three strikes and you're out Harry and Larry's.

Flavor could defiantly be better with the lamb gyro I had (meat was burnt) but the fries are real yum. But the service is absolutely terrible. The elder gentlemen who works there (who said he's Nick) is very rude and the other staff in the kitchen kind of follows his attitude. Example for one of these things...We had ordered the combo, he filled my entire cup with ice to the top, I had about 5 sips of my coke and then asked if I can please grab another refill please but with out any ice this time since they filled it to the top , and he had told me in a very rude manner \\"50 cents!!! I don't do free refills here. This ISNT McDonald's.\\" I had then looked at him real confused because he didn't even give me a chance to speak before shooing me off and then said \\"BYE!...BYEEE!\\" and waved his hand directly in front of my face.
