We were sat right next to a party of 22 (yes, you read that right).  They were VERY LOUD... and Steelers fans, but I don't hold that against them.  \\n\\nAnyway, point is, our server visited us once in the first 15 minutes to apologize for not visiting us (what?).  He had that large party, but he probably shouldn't have had any others while dealing with them.  He clearly spent way too much time with that one group, though likely that was no real fault of his own.  (The party was pretty rude, just for the record... very ignorant of other patrons).\\n\\nWe were just about done, when we caught the eye of a server.  We asked to switch tables, and they apologized profusely and reseated us right away.  Our original server clearly was embarrassed and contrite about the situation, but again, I really don't blame him.  If anyone, I blame the hostess or a manager for not dedicating him solely to that one table.  He clearly didn't have time for anyone else, but that's not really his fault.\\n\\nOkay, so, we got a seat in the quieter (by a decibel) main dining room, and the experience only went uphill from there.  First of all, the place is pretty gorgeous.  I love the design of the main hall, with an incredibly high ceiling and large pizza ovens named after volcanoes.  Neat.  \\n\\nWe saw a short video of one of the chefs there making a basic Margherita pizza, and it looked really good.  I definitely wanted to try that, but we also ordered one with a couple of meat toppings.  (Spicy sausage and pancetta is TOTALLY the way to go, btw).  I'm glad we got them both, because they were awesome!  \\n\\nThe pizzas were everything we were hoping for: a nice, fairly thin crust, but with a decent doughy perimeter; solid sauce; and tasty cheese.  I couldn't have asked for more.  This was perfect.\\n\\nWe started with the fried stuffed artichoke and I hope that stays on the menu as well.  It was small for the price, but really tasty.  The kid had the friend mozzarella, but it wasn't her immediate favorite.  So, we tried it too.  Good, but not the best I'd ever had.  \\n\\nIt was really busy that night, though I'm sure it's like that all the time.  I think that's almost a bit of a shame, because this could be a really romantic place.  Maybe that's not in the cards for Epcot, so at the very least, it's hopefully a sign this place will stay for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nThe food was solid (great pizza), the drinks were tasty, the service was decent (food came out after a VERY long time for supposedly a 90-second pizza cooking time), and the place is TOO LOUD in all the dining areas.  Also, the lobby is swarmed with people waiting for a table, and newly checked in patrons are instructed to 'wait in the lobby' (figure this out, folks).\\n\\nBut, otherwise, it was totally worth it.  It's definitely pricier than you'll find elsewhere, but the quality is totally there, and it's Disney.  You know you're paying a little more here.  Also, if you opt for a large (or the metro mezzo!) size, you'll save some beaucoup bucks.\\n\\nOverall, for me at least, worth the four stars, but only just.  I'm not holding the loud large party against them; on the contrary, their response was ideal and appropriate.  But, it's so loud and crowded, and the price point is a little higher than I'd expect for pizza (not to mention the other entrees).

Our visit was also only a few weeks after opening so I'm sure things will smooth out a bit over the next few weeks. With that being said, the only real bumps in our dining experience were primarily with inconsistency and quality coming out of the bar. The rest of our experience, from service to food, was fairly good.\\n\\nOverall, I was happy with the quality of the food. We started with drinks, which were a challenge for the bar it seemed. The first drink, French 77, was not prepared well - it didn't taste anything like a French 77 should, and whatever champagne they used made it taste more like beer than a cocktail. We sent the drink back and ordered a house special raspberry cocktail. The first was great! The second, same drink, tasted nothing like the first, and not in a good way. Not wanting to send back another drink since the bar looked like it was in the weeds, we forced it down with some mussels.\\n\\nFor the first course, we had the charcuterie board. It was huge with such a wide selection of meats. It was a bit heavy on the terrines and pate but overall very good. The second course we ordered was my all time favorite preparation of mussels - Les moules marini√®res! They were delicious, soft, and flavorful. They had been cleaned and prepped well before cooking in the classic, but delicious, wine-shallot-butter sauce. We finished every last one and used an extra mini-loaf or two of bread to sop up the broth.\\n\\nFor our main course, we ordered the Dover sole meuniere with homemade gnocchi. I'll start with the good - the gnocchi was amazing. They texture and smoky flavor of the grilled gnocchi in the cream sauce and wild mushrooms - wow! However, the Dover sole was a bit disappointing. Everything was seasoned and prepared just right. It was just way overdone. The manager came out to present the whole fish before filleting and serving, but that entire process took much longer than designed. The person doing the filleting was new and butchered the filet (please don't train on your customers, train in the kitchen). I felt bad for this sole - he was destined for such tender greatness but fell to the dry and tough despair of bad execution.\\n\\nOur dessert course lifted our souls though - warm beignets covered in powdered sugar with a luscious dipping sauce - probably as good as you can find this side of Cafe Du Monde. Nothing more to be said about them.\\n\\nI blame the missteps of this visit on being new, and I probably should have waited a few months before trying, but I love French cafes so I had to try.

I would describe it as fishy, peppery and spicy. It was too fishy for me but apparently most folks dig it. \\n\\nFried Sweet Potato Balls $5.5 These are amazing. The perfect blend of sweet potato-honey, sweetness. Crispy fried outside and warm gooey inside. I wanted more.\\n \\nSalt and Pepper Chicken $5.5 This was also a hit. Everyone at our table loved it.  These aren't your frozen chicken nuggets, instead imagine a crispy nugget with the right seasonings of pepper with a spicy kick at the end. \\n\\nNext came the reason I dined here. The Bao! I can only descirbe these as a doughy, soft  mini sandwich. \\nPork belly bao $4.5 This was my favorite. The right blend of pork belly meat with a soft bread that melts when you touch it. \\n\\nDirty bao $5 This came next. I wasn't a fan of it but my friends liked theirs. It had a cold coleslaw type topping with a sweet sauce and chicken. I just wasn't into the sauce or the cold topping. \\n\\nI plan to try more things and update my review. I gave 3 stars because I had more things I didn't like than I did like. Though what I liked, I loved. Also, if you are hungover (like I was) it won't hit the spot and they don't serve alcohol."},{"name":"Taco Loco Mexican Grill","address":"44 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I've been planning on going there b/c I heard it was good food.

I enjoyed the Prosecco, and a glass of Sancerre. The cocktails are on deck for my next visit, but the Figawi looks amazing!\\n\\nI enjoyed the calamari for a starter; it was light, crisp and with a hint of heat. I followed up with the crab and avocado salad, and was pleasantly surprised with the hearts of palm and grapefruit. So light and refreshing! I really considered it my evening palate cleanser. \\n\\nMy dinner selection was a hearty one: Long Island Duck Breast accompanied by crab fried rice, and a kumquat marmalade that was the perfect touch to the dish. It was a light burst of flavor to tame the salty nature of any duck dish (read: not a salty dish, but duck in and of itself is salty! I would order again for certain.).\\n\\nI'm not generally a dessert person, but I was craving a hint of chocolate. I'd heard about the chocolate rangoons, but alas, they were all out. Fortunately, our server, Ricardo, was able to recommend the chocolate creme brulee, and I will say that my chocolate craving was met beyond expectation.\\n\\nYes, when the restaurant is full it can be a little noisy, but the openness of the venue adds to its chic character.

In fact, I can say with all sincerity, it was the worst baked good I have ever purchased, anywhere. It was honestly probably five days old; so hard and stale I couldn't even bite into it. The bottom looked and tasted like burnt pizza crust. It tasted like whoever made it, definitely screwed it up somehow. It was like an old, flavorless crust of bread. No sweetness, no apple, no flavor and hard as a rock. I called to let the staff know because I figured it was an unfortunate fluke mistake. After very politely explaining what happened, the clerk apologized. Then promptly hung up on me. I wasn't rude or unpleasant or even upset in any way. I just figured they would want to know because they shouldn't be selling it. I also know that this location just opened recently and thought maybe the baker made a mistake, no big deal. But after being dismissed in that way, I will never return. I love Blue Star doughnuts. It's a quality artisan product that is a really special treat...but customer service goes a really long way.

Unlike other experiences where they were five or ten minutes late, BHOP was early! I love this restaurant, not to mention the great food! Sure, the food isn't always five stars, but it's a local restaurant with amazing staff and service. Their pizza is great and much better taste-wise and price-wise than any food chain like Dominos or Papa Ginos.

However, even though the recommendation came from a fellow meat lover, I was a little skeptical -- right off the bat, the Rib House had two strikes against it.  First, Boulder, Colorado is not widely known as a carnivore's Mecca and it contains about as many fruits and nuts per capita as the Bay Area.  Second, every time I've gone by it, the place has been just about empty.  Regardless, I was hungry so I took the plunge.\\n\\nI ordered the Illegal Ribs and Boneless Ribs platter, with the hot bbq sauce (they offer mild, medium, hot, and \\"flaming\\" or something like that).  Yes, the ribs fell off the bone, because they were legit hardwood smoked and had none of the chalkiness or mealiness that can betray time spent steaming in an oven.  This meat had some of the nicest smoky outer crust (or bark) that I've experienced.  There was no excess gristle or fat on either cut of meat.  Truly tender, not a hint of stringiness.  Succulent.  Quality meat.  \\n\\nAlthough the meat could easily stand on its own, the sauce that accompanies it is equally well done.  The hot was delicious, a little tomatoey and a little spicy, and bold enough to step to the meat.  I also had cole slaw, which was homemade, crisp, and bright, providing a welcome contrast with the meat/sauce pair; and the fried okra, perfectly breaded and fried and served with ranch dressing.  \\n\\nMy dining companion had ribs, brisket, and pork.  I tried the brisket and pork, and while it was decent enough, there's probably a reason this place is called RIB House.\\n\\nMy only bone to pick with this place was the stale white rolls they served with the meat.  Those rolls were shameful and I don't know where they even find them.  What's stopping these guys from getting a load of Wonderbread or Texas Toast, KC style, every couple days instead?  Some nice, soft, chewy bread to soak up some sauce and grease would have been the fifth star on this review.\\n\\nBottom line here, I've spent a good chunk of time in KC for work and I'd venture that Rib House has what it takes to go toe-to-toe with that whole scene."},{"name":"Villa Mexico","address":"296 Cambridge St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This burrito joint in a gas station is good to go.

Here are my thoughts on the dining experience.\\n\\nWe made a reservation for 12:15 unsure of how busy it was. Turns out, the reservation was a great idea, as it was a busy day. We had to wait some time as it appeared to be only one bartender and one server with at least 8+ tables filled with customers.\\n\\nWe were seated by a fantastic window table and given 2 special menus and 2 regular menus. We had a to wait a while for our server to come over; it was obvious the place was understaffed.\\n\\nEventually we ordered our food and waited. It took approx 30+ minutes for our food to arrive. By then, my colleagues and I were really annoyed and hungry. I think the bartender picked up on it, as he came over to ask us how were were and how the food was; offering us a desert to make up for the time. We explained we had to return to the office, so he packaged our treats (complimentary, for the delay).\\n\\nThe food was great. My colleague ordered the lamb burger (I think), which came with mixed green salad and mixed potatoes. The burger looked great and was covered with baked brie.\\n\\nMy other two colleagues had the curry vegetable stew that smelled amazing. Both agreed it was fantastic; but did note it would have been nice with some rice or such.\\n\\nI had the smoked chicken club sandwich came with mixed green salad and mixed potatoes. It was fantastic... mind you, there was a lot of avocado, but was great.\\n\\nOverall, the service was slow, but the staff made a sincere effort to make up for it.

I have heard a lot of love/hate stories about Trudy's  but wanted to check it out myself. \\n\\nMet up with some family here over the weekend while in town. The patio out back was really cute and lovely. We were a table of 5 and they only brought out 1 basket of chips at a time. Not even a large basket. They were relatively small considering what one might get at a typical Mexican joint. The salsa was pretty legit though. I liked the green and another one that appeared to be some kind of roasted salsa mixed with green? I had 2 Mango margaritas that were really good and rivaled my favorite place in San Antonio. \\n\\nI ordered the Smoked Chicken Enchiladas Suizas. Very good. I loved the tender chicken and the creamy sauce that came on top. The black refried beans were to die for. I would have liked to have extra of those instead of the mexican rice. I added an extra side of the Mexican street corn which was a joke. It was a tiny quarter of corn sprinkled with chili powder and parmesan on a huge stick. ($2) My waitress asked if I would like to upgrade to an extra enchilada for $1 I asked her if my plate only came with one and she said yes. (it actually came with 2 so I ordered extra for nothing)\\nMy husband ordered a burrito with a Chipotle sauce that was way too spicy.  So he picked out the meat and was still starving after that and had to orderer a Chicken Quesadilla. My sister in law needed some milk because the sauce on her place was also way too spicy. She asked for a glass of milk  (which was brought out in a shot glass) and was charged $2. My brother in law asked for some extra green sauce and was also charged a dollar or two. No one else in my party seemed to love or rave about the food. \\n\\nTheir prices aren't terribly unreasonable but I think they try and make up for that  by nickeling and dimeing you every time you make a request. Our waitress also seemed quite frazzled by our table of 5. She constantly forgot items and didn't even refill our water glasses. \\n\\nOver all I had a good time, but I am on the fence."},{"name":"Brick & Fire","address":"1621 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Celebrating my temporary bachelor life for one more night, I thought pizza would be a propos, especially as my husband tends not to want to eat these \\"bad\\" foods.  So, it's late-ish, 9pm, I'm starving, I drive by this place often, I'm thinking something close and local and this is my chance.\\n\\nSo, the menu has a variety of specialty pizzas, seem somewhat inspired, but not completely original as this meme of themed pizzas has been a bit overdone.  I chose to go with a fairly simple Bianca adding pepperoni and spinach.  $12 + $2 per extra topping, so $17 and change with tax.   So, not cheap, but their website photos are appealing and the other yelpers seem convinced.   \\n\\nI did a carry-out and the person said only 15-20 minutes, pretty quick, right?  Perhaps too quick, because what they forgot to do was cook the pizza adequately.  The edges of the dough had turned to crust with some nice browning, but not fully around.  I'm guessing the semi-brown edge was the cook's metric, but this was a miscalculation.  \\n\\nThe dough hadn't quite turned into crust yet on the bottom, so the pie was bit gooshy and didn't succeed to hold up the mounds and mounds and mounds and mounds and mounds and mounds and mounds and mounds of the different cheeses.  I understand what a Bianca is and the menu described the cheeses, so this was no surprise.  With regard to the ingredients (and not the time in the oven), I just think that the precept of \\"less is more\\" would have done this pie a lot of good, and even perhaps the bottom of the pizza would have survived.  I ended up turning on my own oven and cooking it more to create some structure....that pizza stone finally came in handy.\\n\\nThat said, the pizza's flavor was good, but this was negated by the avalanche of cheeses.  The pepperoni were very tasty, but at $2 for the add-on, I'd expect to hit more than 4 or slices.  The same for the $2 spinach add-on.  \\n\\nYou can have all the best ingredients, the best ideas, and even the highest prices, but if you cannot master ratios and equilibrium of these items, you cannot  craft flavors and excellence that people are dying to come back and pay for.   \\n\\nI won't rule out coming back here again, but I would most definitely order cautiously and with special instructions."},{"name":"Kiku Sushi","address":"4986 Kingsway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"Kikku is my favourite sushi place in burnaby area.

There are thin layers of sliced avocados covered the top of the sushi, this makes their avocado roll very special. It's beautiful and yum. I haven't seen any other sushi places do the same for their avocado rolls. \\nTheir veggie rolls are quite good too. Many sushi shops make their veggie rolls extra big with lots shredded carrots, white cabbage, etc.... Make those so hard to put in to mouth and almost tasteless. Kikku's veggie rolls are better; they make them not super big so you can put it in mouth without making it too messy. The flavour is also better than other places. I feel that they make their sushis with good care and passion. \\nRice is the important part for sushis, and Kikku's rice is very decent too. They mix their rice with just enough sugar and vinegar. The rice for me is quite tasty. \\nThe only thing I would complain is the air circulation there. After every time I dine there, my clothes got food smell attached to them. \\nThe service there is quite welcoming and friendly.

Walked in after a movie (it's in a large Atlanta version of an outdoor mall).  The bartender, Megan, was cute and friendly.  She asks everyone they're name.  She is also good for the owners, as she is very good as a pusher of more drinks. Every time she notices you are 1/4 near the end, she hits you up for a new one.  And it works for most I saw.  So, owner, she's good.\\n\\nThe bad.  This is not an Irish bar. Ever since Angela's Ashes, every place wants to be an Irish bar. Unfortunately, none of them make Irish food. It's all Shepard's Pie, fish and chips, and then nachos and buffalo wings. Booo!  Where is the Guinness Stew?\\n\\nAlso, I noticed the manager was pissed drunk (and I went in at 1:45 pm).  He tried to get me to play a 1 dollar game where you have to roll 5 dice and get them all the same to win the jar (which was 700 bucks). Even the workers are so desperate they play it. I did not.  He tells me people won 1400 dollars.  I hear, that means 1400 people put in a buck before it paid out to someone - bad odds / not to mention the odds of getting five dice to come up exact is almost nil - the lottery has better odds).  I don't gamble, and didn't today either.  Sadly, some waitresses did.  Don't they need their tips?  When asked I found out the bar has been open 1 year and it has only paid out twice.  Nice.  Might as well wipe your butt with the cash.\\n\\nWorse, was that Megan - who is a decent and well-trained bartender, as well as very attractive to male customers with talk and interaction (I witnessed at least 3 people try to hit on her while I was there) - she has some problems.  She is a chatty Kathy.  Good bartenders like her make good drinks and move drinks. She does both exceptionally.  Great bartenders are listeners; not talkers.  She needs to pull it back and let people talk to her. Then they will interact more.\\n\\nWorse was that I had 4 half and half's - half Guinness / Half Harp.  Glad they knew what it was. As you get into arguments countrywide about Harp or Bass in this drink, even though a Guinness/Bass is a Black and Tan.  The problem is she makes the drink - very well, and well trained with Guinness, but then she goes on to talk and talk and talk with other people. My first one was already fully mixed by the time she gave it to me, and I was right next to the tap in a seat with four people there. The second one was perfect cause the drunk manager saw it sitting there and gave it to me on time. The third was already mixing. By the last one, I demanded a repour and she fucking flipped out, saying she'd get in trouble. WTF do I care? I pay for my drinks.  Shut up and make them right. Then we can be the best of friends. Otherwise, don't expect me to pay for what you can't stay focused on.\\n\\nDidn't eat anything. So no food review.  Though nothing looked good on the menu.  Oh, and they use Pandora for music, which is horrible. It's an Irish bar. Program The Pogues, Dropkick Murphy's, and Flogging Molly's, with some Rolling Stones, maybe some Iggy Pop, and The Who.  Something normal and decent everyone can like. Something that adds mood.  The music when I came in was horrible blues music I can't even place or remember. Then we got a chunk of 90's early Seattle grunge I have heard to death at this point in my life. I think one Rolling Stones song came on before I left. Otherwise, the music was unbearable.  I was going to leave a couple drinks earlier and should've, but Meg is good at hitting you up on a refill while you are on the phone with an emergency phone call or not paying attention - give her props for this, boss."},{"name":"Pho Jasmine Restaurant","address":"714 N Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We had vegetarian pho and spring rolls with peanut sauce.

So I went back today to give them another try and what I got was overcooked dry and fibery. OH what happend to my ribs!?\\nService was not good. We ordered our food and 35 minutes later it came to the table. One order of a Hot Sausage sandwich was forgotten. It was another 10 minutes to get it to the table. a total of 45 minutes which pretty much exhausted our lunch break. Now if they were busy I would be a little more understanding, but 5 workers behind the counter and we were the only ones in the place that had not gotten their food at the time the order was placed. 2 people came in and got to go orders while were were waiting but that was it.

The salad was a good size and looked great until we realized the plastic back holding the container was melted.  The salad and dressing was very warm and inedible.  When we ordered I also asked for a water and inquired about the size of the bottle, was told it was 20 ounces; upon arrival it was a small bottle, so the driver gave me my money back for it.

Well since then a guy joined a foodie group I help to manage and has been prodding me to come check out the food Barnie's now offers. Today I finally managed to drop by and he was in the kitchen so after finally getting to meet face to face I told him to select what he thought we'd like and good bad or indifferent I will share my experience with the group.

They are topped with tomato sauce, goat cheese and salsa verde. I would love to say there was something to nit pick but there wasn't. There was a nice crust on the meatballs, they were perfectly cooked. The tomato sauce and salsa verde went beautifully with it and the bread that was paired with it was a perfect match. \\n\\nNext up was the Tacos de Carnitas and one word describes them...  WOW \\nI have been to Mexican restaurants that could not make the Tacos de Carnita this good. The pork was flavorful and very tender. There was just the right amount of toppings to bring the flavors together. Well done..\\n\\nLast up was the Caprese Sandwich with a side of the pickled veggies. The rosemary Foccacia was delicious and toasted just right. The tomatoes and mozzarella were fresh and flavorful but the pesto was the hidden star. I have to say that it was better than my own pesto so I will have to find out what his secret is. The pickled veggies were beet/pickles/onion and my wife only managed one bite. The pickles tasted like the bread and butter pickles my aunt used to make when I was a small boy. \\n\\nI took a sip of mama's Latte and as usual, Barnie's has the latte thing down pat.

I've only been to Disney once other than this visit, and of all the countries to eat in Epcot we chose to eat in Italy. Based on reservation availability, this is where we ended up, and based on the reviews I couldn't wait all day for this dinner. This was hands down the worst meal I had throughout my entire Disney trip and an even bigger let down. I got lobster ravioli that was absolutely disgusting - I literally did not know you could mess up raviolis. It was nothing more than maybe 6 raviolis with not lobster meat but what tasted like crabmeat in it in a \\"creamy\\" sauce that I can only compare to the Spaghettios sauce except way less flavor. We waited for quite some time prior to getting our meal in which we had to ask(?) for bread...I found this bizarre as I'm paying $30 for a lobster ravioli dish, I shouldn't have to ask for bread with my meal? Not sure why this is the norm at this restaurant. The dessert was also nothing desirable other than the gelato that came with it was tasty but seriously, how can you screw up ice cream? My mom got the pizza which I had high hopes for after tasting my disgusting lobster raviolis but again, sauce had no taste on the pizza - you can find better at Bertucci's. A huge disappointment; with the endless dining opportunities in Epcot I absolutely will not be returning and HIGHLY recommend that if you're on the fence to skip it and choose another restaurant in Italy or Epcot that's more consistent with better food, pricing, and service. The $140 bill and tasteless food with a restaurant that chooses to nickel and dime you by giving small portions and making you ask for bread with a meal you're paying for is not a returning restaurant in my book."},{"name":"Grand Day Cafe","address":"1284 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"We are from Indy.

Best bao I've had in Atlanta, way better than Miso Izakaya's even. lots of cilantro and pickled vegetable chunks. This was so balanced and the pork belly was melt in your mouth delicious. The bao bread is made fresh in house and you can tell. It's so deliciously soft and perfect. \\n\\nBeef Noodle Soup: I don't have to go to buford anymore for my beef noodle soup fix. These noodles were so flavorful. I split it with a friend and put some in a separate bowl without soup and it was still delicious and perfectly seasoned. The noodles also are chewy which all good noodles need to be and the chinese jie lan (broccoli) was perfectly cooked and plentiful. The beef was also lean and tender and a good portion for a beef noodle soup. They also put pickled vegetable chunks and green onion in it which is a nice touch. \\n\\nOxtail: This was our least favorite of the meal. The oxtail came with white rice and jie lan. The oxtail was cooked well but the sauce was too sweet. I wouldn't get this dish again. \\n\\nMeat Fried Rice: This was good standard fried rice, nothing special but the taiwanese sausage was delicious and apparently this is the only place on the east coast that has fresh taiwanese sausage. \\n\\nIce cream bao: This is an ice cream sandwich with a  friend bao shell as the outside. My friend got this and I had a bite and it was delicious! The fried bao tastes like a fresh light donut and wrapped around cold Jake's salted caramel ice cream, it's a delicious salty sweet hot cold end to a meal. \\n\\nOverall, this is one of the best asian meals I've had in Atlanta period.

I'm not sure if it was the food, the quiet corner we had in foyer/patio area all to ourselves, or the wonderfully amazing woman I had just met, but the night was unforgettable. The appetizer plates we shared were great and very diverse (we wanted to try everything we possibly could) and drinks flowed like Dionysus himself was sitting at the table. Time flew by like nothing and we ended up closing the place and stumbling home for a game of competitive scrabble. Seriously the best first date ever. That woman and I are now married and I'd like to think a bit of that credit does go to Locus for the amazing night...\\n\\nNow hearing this story, this should merit 5 stars, no? Sure it should! but unfortunately my yelp brothers and sisters this was our last great outing at Locus to date...\\n\\nThis isn't saying that we haven't tried since either. My wife and I WANT to love this place again, to experience that first time and fall back in love with the place that brought us together. We've tried time and time again and made various attempts at different times of the day (brunch, dinner, late night drinks) and there always seems to be something...off...whenever we are there. \\n\\n\\nThe Good:\\nThe atmosphere is very chill, not too loud so you can't hear the people with you and can be very intimate with their booths and seating if you just want a drink with the pals. The (what we believe are) owners are great, very friendly and greet you as if they know you and are welcoming you into their home. Music changes quite a bit, from 'hipster stuff' to house loops, it really depends on the time and the day, but it's still quiet enough that it doesn't drown out conversation so that's a plus. Drink specials are amazing for late night and they have some unique Cocktails and Martinis.\\n\\nThe Bad: \\nNot sure what has happened in the last little while but the service has gone downhill on a steady decline. It seems that the overall staff could care less that you were there or not, I don't know if aloof is the right word to describe many of our times there but I'm going to use it anyway. Our last trip was for brunch and we had to pull our waitress aside and remind her about our coffees after waiting 20 minutes and watching other cups whiz past us to other tables. Her reply: 'oh, did you order coffees?'. Yup, you even explaining they didn't have drip coffee and only had Americano's (but thanks for letting us know, apparently they are bad for not communicating this as well). The food can really be hit or miss. They've definitely shrunk down the menu since our first date as most of the unique appetizers/share plates that we loved are gone and although it has been getting better in the last couple trips it still isn't what it was. For the main dishes it's usually one of us walking out happy and the other having something that we didn't like about the dish that was served. From dry as a bone fish, to overly fatty lamb, to cold sides I guess we've seen it all. Again on the last trip our eggs on my benny were solid (after asking for medium) and we didn't want to complain as we had already waited 40-50 minutes for the food (granted it was busy but still).\\n\\nThe Ugly:\\nNothing to put here really, I guess some of the art for sale on the walls can be iffy but I'm not going to judge, just because it isn't my cup of tea doesn't mean it's bad...I'm really just more of a Clint Eastwood Fan and wanted this to work...\\n\\n\\nSo have I been soured by the experiences after our first date? Sure have. Will I be coming back? Absolutely, albeit less frequent then what we'd like to.

Good salad, although the dressing was a bit strong, good shepherd's pie, tasty scone.  The not as good things:  The staff was kind of hot and cold.  Pleasant enough at first, but seemingly more interested in helping some people than others, and testy when questioned.  The menu was limited.  I was looking forward to the chicken pie, but it wasn't ready yet.  At 12:30 on a weekday.  When I left at 1:20, still wasn't ready.  Some of the other stuff seemed to be missing as well.  Also, coffee refills aren't free, a fact that was not immediately apparent.\\n\\nSo, in summary, I love the concept.  It's unique and fun and useful.

The farro salad was a nice balance between the chewy grain and pine nuts and the creamy sweet roasted squash. Parsley added a bitter note that I was less a fan of but that's generally how I feel about parsley. A little goes a long way. The sandwich had a lot going on between the cranberry bread outside and the thanksgiving dinner inspired fillings. The thing that got a little lost in translation was actually the turkey but I still enjoyed the sandwich. \\n\\nMy mango infused tea was very refreshing and I loved that they brought a mini pitcher with extra along to the table when it was served.

It's not dingy, or grubby, it's fucking dirty.  Any surface that gets touched is shellacked with grease, and the vinyl booths are torn and taped in places.  The walls are covered with movie posters and tons of graffiti.  It's like eating in a rock venue's bathroom.  Better yet, it's like eating in a restaurant straight out of the 'Fallout' universe, for those of you familiar with those post-apocalyptic games.\\nAt this point you might be asking, why the 4 stars?  Well, the food is good.  Nothing fancy, eggs, toast, hashbrowns and breakfast meat.  The very definition of a serviceable diner breakfast.  Coffee is cheap but gets the job done.  It's true what I read in other reviews, you have to get your own water and coffee, but you know what?  I found I actually preferred this method.  I could get coffee when I wanted it, and in the portion I wanted.  I wish more restaurants used this system, after trying it.  I personally find it annoying when servers come by and top off your cup when you aren't paying attention, thereby screwing up your milk/sugar/coffee proportions.  Also, the plates and silverware were actually very clean, throwing off the whole 'greasy spoon' expectation.\\nThe bottom line is that it's a filling breakfast for $2.95, in a city that practically pulls the money out of your pocket."},{"name":"Bar Louie Plaza on University","address":"4100 N Alafaya Trl, Ste 167 & 173","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This is the best bar in town!!

That being said, the broths are delicious and fragrant but heavy. I wonder how much MSG is in these broths.\\n\\nThe milky one is seasoned well and the spicy one is def spicy. What's good about this place is that you don't need a dipping sauce because the broth is so flavorful and concentrated that it will infuse whatever you are cooking, whether it is a meat, veggie, seafood, noodle.\\n\\nThe food was all solid. I just wish it was a bit less heavy, and they had a better ventilation system. Better yet, it'd be nice if they gave bags to put our coats in them so they don't absorb the smell. \\n\\nOverall, if you're craving something to soothe your soul, then this place is for you.

It always seemed like one of those things not really worth all the extra planning into the trip.  If you aren't staying at Fort Wilderness you need to basically go to a park to get there, or leave a park to go and come back.  This to me just didn't seem worth it, but boy was I wrong.  Did I mention after the show they will also take you back to a park OR your resort?  This is a great feature... despite the work getting there. \\n\\nNow, keep in mind that this is a popular attraction.  You need to make reservations well in advance, and give yourself time to get over to the show.  I would recommend about 45 minutes to get there even from Magic Kingdom in terms of waiting for the bus, checking in, etc.  This is another \\"Signature\\" experience and will cost you 2 Points. Again, this is why I always recommend the Deluxe Dinging Plan to people... who wants to have to pick and choose between the best places to go?\\n\\nThe Magical (Pros): \\n\\nLet's start with the obvious question.  Is the food good?  The food is actually very good.  Now, I love BBQ and I look at it this way... if you are a diehard BBQ person it isn't going to rock your socks, and if you hate BBQ style food it isn't going to rock your socks, BUT if you get those occasional cravings for decent ribs, chicken, and all the fixin's then your palate will be satisfied.  It's all you can eat, and served family style.  We didn't need any refills as the initial servings were more than enough.  Come hungry!  \\n\\nIf you drink beer or wine (Sangria too) this is the time and place.  First, it makes the show seem that much better :), but more over it is included in the price.  This is a RARE find in Disney.  So if you're on a tight budget, this makes this worth the extra price to get that included. \\n\\nFor dessert you get Strawberry Shortcake.  This is not one of my favorite desserts traditionally... I wouldn't seek it out on a menu, but here it fits the bill nicely and is delicious. \\n\\nThe show itself is campy, silly, and all around fun.  I don't know that we will be seeing the Hoop-Dee Do Revue Broadway Cast coming to a city near you any time soon (although rule nothing out with Disney), but the show does what it is meant to do.  It get's the audience involved, and remind you why you are all in Disney... to have a good time as a family. When going into the show you also get a family photo that can be purchased, or linked to your Memory Maker Account to download and print when you get home. \\n\\nOne last note is about the \\"Western Style\\" town built up around Pioneer Hall where the show is held.  It feels like you are on the set of an old Western Movie... if not actually in the Old West yourself (or at least Hollywood's take on it).  I always give Disney Kudos for stretching the imagination and taking you on incredible journeys of the mind.  I have never stayed at Fort Wilderness, but on my visits here it makes me want to consider a stay among the many resorts I love on property. \\n\\nThe Wicked (Cons):\\n\\nCheck-in is a bit frustrating.  There are often a lot of people at the show.  There is a window to check in, but then you also have to check in somewhere around the front of the building.  So there are basically two lines to go to one place, and it's confusing who is in line for what.  To add to the confusion there is a 3rd line for a Photo-Op, which by the way is one of the better Photo's in Disney. \\n\\nOnce inside everything feels a bit rushed, but that has to do with getting the show started.  It just feels like a cattle call getting everyone to their seat, and I am not sure there is much that can be done about that.\\n\\nFor those of you will strollers, stroller parking is also kind of odd.  We parked our stroller up on a deck where a cast member told us to put it, but it seemed out of place, and I was worried it would get moved or worse disappear.  I would highly recommend for place like this a better clear stroller parking designation (ideally covered with all that Florida Rain). \\n\\nIn the End:\\n\\nThis is worth the trip, and the points.  We had considered not doing it again for our next trip, but then I realized I would be crazy to not go back.  The food and entertainment are great, and I feel like it's one of the meals that really brings your whole family together for a good time."},{"name":"Amsterdam Cafe","address":"502 Amsterdam Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"The food is good and at a reasonable price.. it's not a nonsmoking location and leave your phobias at home for a great burger.."},{"name":"Taste","address":"717 W Smith St","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Taste is a unique, modern restaurant that serves appetizer portions of all of their dishes also known as tapas. A TRUE tapas dish can really only be found in Spain or Spanish inspired eateries. The food found in taste does not fall into this category HOWEVER their food is pretty good...a little fancy, but tasty.\\n\\nSince all dishes are tapas, the idea is to order several, about 3 to 4 dishes each, and share. Although this could be tough because the portions are not very big and may not go very far. I suggest getting one or two solely for yourself and maybe one or two to share this way everyone gets enough to eat.\\n\\nTo start I would go with the tapenade trio which consists of kalamata and black olive, roasted red pepper and roasted garlic spreads and is served with crisp breads. The spreads are all very good, with just the right amount of flavor and consistency. Surprisingly, the flavors mesh well and compliment one another. If you like goat cheese, this spread is also very good to start off with.\\n\\nOut of the salads the wilted spinach is probably the better choice among them. It's very simple, and light leaving room for what's to come. Personally, I would skip the salads if you can. The choices are not that great and their other dishes definitely hold precedence over the salads.\\n\\nFrom the \\"sea creatures\\" section of the menu, the seared sea scallops are a winner. These too are very simply made with just a hint of chipotle and they're served very simply as well. A close second is the Ahi tuna tartar...if you can handle raw fish that is.\\n\\nThere is a small section of Taste's menu that features \\"full size portions\\"...but, in my opinion, they're not much bigger than the rest of the dishes. The Argentinean marinated beef tenderloin is the best option here...good flavor and presentation.\\n\\nFor dessert, definitely go with the chocolate bread pudding...because it's pretty amazing and will more than satisfy that sweet tooth that always creeps up at the end of a meal. PLUS the sangria is MUST to go with your meal or enjoy after.\\n\\nThe decor and ambiance of Taste is what I love most...even more than the food. It's perfect for a romantic date or just to sit back and relax with a glass of vino. Art work adorns the walls along with bright colors that are toned down by the dim lighting. On certain nights of the week they feature a comedy troop that is pretty entertaining and funny.\\n\\nOverall, not bad...not a place that I would recommend going to often, but it's a nice change from you're everyday food fare."},{"name":"Casa Chapala","address":"3010 W Anderson Ln, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is why I should ALWAYS yelp a place before I go.\\n\\nFirst, let me state that the service was good.  The waitress was nice, and everything was brought out in a timely manner (with exception of the check).  The atmosphere was quite Mexican estauranty. I commented that I felt as if I was on the set of The Three Amigos.  It's almost as if a Mexican Restaurant was bulemic.  It took in all the Mexican restaurant shtick it could, then vomited it in Casa Chapala. So, they got their point across.  \\n\\nI was a bit annoyed at the get go.  Upon sitting down, we opened the menu (which was really strangely heavy).  I nearly fell over!  For the most part, this restaurant is expensive.  I would say the majority of the items on the menu are over $13.  There were quite a few $15-$23 items.  It isn't something I expected at 3 in the afternoon in a restaurant sitting next to a Merle Norman in a shopping strip.  It was freaking pricey.  Too pricey! \\n\\nUpon further inspection, both the boy and I found a combination meal for $9.  We both went for it.  Ordering it was very confusing.  It all said pick a filling and a sauce.  But, that really wasn't how it worked at all.  I felt a bit retarded after ordering.  How the waitress explained it made no sense at all, so boyfriend ended up doing almost the same thing.  But, we got our order across eventually.\\n\\nI ordered a chili relleno (as it is my favorite thing on earth) and a bean and cheese chimichanga.  He got a chimichanga with chicken and an enchilada.  Somehow, in the kitchen, I received his chicken   chimichanga on my plate, and he got my bean and cheese.  That was a bit of a surprise since I am a vegetarian.  So, chomping into it, I was a little thrown off.  We switched the chimichangas with each other.  How they mixed up items on plates is beyond me.  I guess it was a mistake that is easily made when ordering two similar items, but it shouldn't be.\\n\\nBoyfriend was munching on said chimichanga, and kept pulling out bones.  Lots of them!  Long, pointy ones.  Small round ones.  One was very much a choking hazard.  (I have pictures of them if you want to see!). This is just not cool!  Not at all.  \\n\\nThe food was okay.  They did make the salsa table side.  It was okay.  The bean dip was good, but it was just refried beans.  Boyfriend thought the charro beans were way too salty.  He couldn't eat them.  (and please note we aren't those crazy picky people).  He didn't even bring them home in a to go box.  And, I am all about to go boxes.  I paid, I'm taking it home!  I may be thrifty, but I'm not very picky.\\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't go back.  The food was decent, but not that great.  And, for really just a plate of beans and cheese and chicken bones and salty beans, $30 should not be spent.  It was really too expensive for what it was.\\n\\nWe didn't say anything about the food mix up or the bones.  It takes a whole lot to get me to complain.  We did have food to take home, so the portions where good.  They kept up with drinks and asked if we wanted more chips and salsa.  That was cool.  But, we probably won't go back.\\n\\nAlso, this is just a personal gripe about restaurants (and this one did it).  The place is empty.  Why do you just sit me somewhere?  Why don't you say \\"Booth or table?\\"  We got a booth which is fine, but I am an ample girl with a very amble bosom.  At my height, if a booth is a bit of a smaller one, my boobs sit right on the table which may be fun for some too look at, but it ain't fun for me!  These booths where normal sized, but why not ask?  Don't you want your customers to be comfortable?  It's awkward for everyone when you have to set my plate in the middle of the table because these grand old knockers are taking up my side of the table.  So, please servers, ask!  Not everyone likes boobies in their salsa.\\n\\nAll in all it was 3 star food, 3.5 star service, but with the prices, mix up, bones, and salt, I give it two stars."},{"name":"JoLa Cafe","address":"5915 SW Corbett Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I have been to JoLa Cafe a handful of times in the last few months and each time has been excellent.

I definitely thought the cream filled donuts were really well executed and it was very clear that someone had taken the time to balance the delicacy of the top of the donut flavor with the filling. The Valrhona-cream balanced a dark chocolate with a light cream. It was a solid donut. The berry-peanut butter was really pretty impressive because the peanut was powdered and it gave the texture and sense of a real peanut butter and jelly sandwich when you bit into it, and even with the slight stickiness of your tough to the roof of your mouth with the dryness of the powdered peanut, which was very neat. The olive oil orange donut was a cake and while the taste was unique I've had better cake donuts- the texture and taste of the cake was rather ordinary aside from the orange flavor. \\n\\nI would go here for the donut adventure and I would probably continue to go for this reason if I lived nearby- the culinary adventure and delight when surprised by texture and sensation combined. \\n\\nWhy I routinely search out donut shops is that I once had a fantastic donut that was a cinnamon and nutmeg cake donut in Williamsburg Brooklyn about 12 years ago. It sent me on a quest to try to remake that donut myself and to find such amazing donut dough that the simplest donut is memorable years later.

The pizza CAN be very tasty when it is done right and you order at the restaurant. However, forget about delivery. I've never had my order show up in the time promised (often waiting upwards of 90 minutes) and it is often also incorrect and because of the long delivery time, cold. I really do like their pizza when it's made right (maybe 2/3 of the time) but I've had it with the crap shoot. When it's right, it's good, but often it's burnt, sparsely topped, or just not made as ordered. Frankly, their pizza is too expensive to continue to order and hope for the best. Allow me to relate my most recent experience, which is not entirely unusual, but this time was handled by the staff horribly. \\n\\nI called and ordered a small pizza on wheat crust with a salad and was quoted a 45 minute delivery time by the woman who took my order. I called back after an hour and fifteen minutes to find out where it was and talked to the same woman who said the driver had left and would be at my house any minute. The driver showed up 15 minutes later, and already being 45 minutes late, couldn't be bothered to come to the second floor where my apartment is. \\n\\nWhile the toppings were correct, my pizza was made on the wrong crust. I called the restaurant and a young man answered the phone. I told him that not only was my pizza 45 minutes late, but it was not made on the crust I ordered. He asked what the ticket said, which is really irrelevant, because I don't really have any control over what the ticket says, nor did I have a copy of it. He said he could send out another pizza. I remarked that I didn't want to wait another 90 minutes and he said, \\"so, what are you just calling to complain?\\" I asked for the manager and he said he was the kitchen manager. I said no, I did not want another pizza, once again citing the very long delivery time, and that it was very frustrating to get the wrong pizza after so much time had passed. He did not offer to refund my money and was frankly quite rude. I told him I would not be returning to Upper Crust (and I will not be). He said \\"Thank you, god bless, have a nice day.\\" It was very clear he did not care that my pizza was late and wrong, and his barely feigned politeness was incredibly off-putting. \\n\\nThe pizza being late and wrong is nothing new, but the \\"kitchen manager\\" clearly did not give two sh**ts and was not in the least bit successful at hiding his contempt behind polite words. That is a first. In the past, they've usually made some kind of effort to correct their mistakes. Many months back, they had a nasty habit of sending out salads that were browned and slimy in the middle. (That hasn't happened recently.) But when it did, they were usually pretty quick in getting a replacement out, and very apologetic. \\n\\nI actually have a $20 coupon from a past disaster that I didn't have on me today. Not only will I never order from or visit Upper Crust again, but I will not even use the $20 coupon, because it's just that much of a hassle. It's unfortunate, because if they make the pizza right, it's really good. But as I said before, it just costs too much to order and cross my fingers hoping it will be right."},{"name":"Happy's Bar & Kitchen","address":"1363 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Great food selection and awesome drinks too!

Ok onto the food... Bad, tasteless, cold when served, portions were adequate though, but who cares about portions when the food isn't good.  I had the Chicken Rosa, very bland and the breading on the chicken was burned.  My tablemates also reported that their meals (Veal Marsala,, Veal Picatta and Pasta Primivera) were equally disappointing.

Worked with another man....he seemed very confused and the food was not as good. The chicken wings barely had sauce on them, the large side of fries was smaller than the small size we had ordered last time. The ribs were just warm, not hot.

I thought it was food truck but instead it was smallish restaurant with limited seating. We saw some people dine in but we also saw a lot of people picking up their orders to go. If you go to their website online you have that option to order and pick up. \\n\\nBased upon looking at the menu at any Thai restaurant I looked for the most peppers since I love spice. I landed on Gang Keaw Wan aka green curry. I opted for getting chicken as my protein and explained to the waitress that I wanted it super spicy, aka Thai spicy. She gave me a strange look (I get this all the time because I look like your typical crazy white girl) but she agreed she will have them make it Thai spicy for me.  My husband opted for the pad cashew chicken meal since he is trying to eat a little healthier. While we waited for our meals we ordered shrimp spring rolls to dine on. \\n\\nThe spring rolls are described as: Choice of shrimp or tofu with vermicelli and vegetables (green leaf, carrots, cucumber, and cilantro), wrapped in fresh rice paper and served with tamarind sauce. The presentation was pretty but was not a fan of the tamarind sauce. We like a nice spicy peanut sauce with spring rolls.\\n\\nNow on to the meals, the green curry was spicy like I like it. I could have added more chili but I wanted a flavorful spice and that is what was given to me. The portion size was huge and took over half of my meal home for lunch the next day. My palate was dancing the whole time while I was eating the meal. I love the fact it met my current dietary restriction of no dairy (they use coconut milk) and the dish was gluten free. Please note that gluten-free items are labeled on the menu. My husband said his meal was good but wish he would have ordered his normal pad thai. \\n\\nWe ordered mango sticky rice to go and shared later that evening. The mango sticky rice was only okay. I think it would have tasted better if we ate it while it was fresh and not a few hours later. Plus to be honest if you ever been to Thailand like I have, you will know that the food and their fruit is 10x better there."},{"name":"Trudy's North Star","address":"8820 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Didn't expect much from Trudy's to be honest.

The potatoes laced with pulled short rib was almost sweet, but was just the right counterpoint to the acidic bite of the saut√©ed greens.  The pork shank with beans, arugula pesto and bacon gastrique  was savoury and hearty, the pork done well and falling from the bone.  The duck was likewise well prepared, while the smoked mushrooms and celery root puree created a robustness somewhat uncommon of many duck plates.\\n\\nThe desserts are quite nice, particularly the grapefruit sorbet.

The menu was very expansive, but pictures helped me (the dim sum novice) find it more accessible.  The food came out piping hot, flavorful, and delicious.  My favorite was the roasted pork, which we couldn't stop eating.  The prawn eggroll (while greasy) was also satisfying and yummy.  The only miss food-wise for us was the prawn noodle soup.  It was a little too fishy and the smell was a bit off putting.  Other than that we would definitely eat everything else again.  \\n\\nOne thing to note is that we had to specifically ask for a dim sum menu.  Initially we were given something totally different.  If we hadn't asked we really would have missed out.  There was also a little confusion around paying.

The corn cakes are definitely unique. The flavor is really good and had a nice balance of savory and sweet. Our food came out almost instantly after we ordered. Looks like they also have local beers, sodas, and wine. The atmosphere was lively but not overly crowded. The only bad thing I have to say is that I was a bit disappointed by the prices for a fast-casual place. Each corn cake is $7-8 and pretty darn small (i.e. taco-sized).

For a dairy-free ice cream shop, Nada-moo gets 4 stars. But for a general ice cream shop, I give it a 3. \\n\\nI love coconut. I really do! I love coconut water, coconut flakes, all the coconut things. However, all of the ice cream flavors are overwhelmingly coconutty. And it was making me nutty! With the medium sized cone, you are able to get two flavors...so I thought oh what the heck, might as well right? Not always.\\n\\nI had their oreo and brownie chocolate flavors. It was so strange to get the heavy coconut flavors in as well, since I wanted a more rich and darker treat to end my night. The other flavors were so intriguing, but after tasting them, they all came out to be overly floral or tropical.\\n\\nI wouldn't necessarily choose Nada-moo as my go to ice cream store. However, they did a great job decorating the exterior with sprinkles/jimmies, and put extra touches in their merch shop and inside seating. Extra cherries on top for that!

I have had the talapia salad and the talapia dinner in my two experiences. My husband got the portabella burger on what was my second trip. The salad was only 7.50 and had a good size portion of fish but the lettuce, dressing and \\"seasonal vegetables\\" (which was shredded carrot and sliced cucumber) were about the portion size of a small side salad. Rip off. I also agree with the other reviewer that the Cesar dressing is weird and bleh. \\n\\nThe talapia dinner was pretty gross. The side salad it came with was mainly the gross bitter and typically discarded ends of iceberg lettuce. Again, the fish portion was good. it came with two hush puppies, which are supposed to be \\"the best in the world\\" but were not very good. Oddly sweet. I prefer ones that I made at home, so that's telling you something (I have made them once!). I am pretty sure the mashed potatoes were instant because they were tasteless and looked like cafeteria food. Oh and it came with grilled vegetables which was a little less than 1/4 cup of chard that tasted weird and funny and tangy (not southern style vinegar tangy-weird tangy). That was the dinner plate, don't think you are getting that much food like it lets on. \\n\\nThe portabella burger was  terrible. It was super tiny, not even twice the size of a slider, and was dry, meaning no condiments, no spread they claimed came on it. The fries were those frozen kind you buy in a bag at the grocery store for 2 dollars. \\n\\nThe actual place is nice and clean and well decorated. The service is pathetic and the kids serving look like they would rather be anywhere else. Oh, and I don't think they have the right to call themselves a bistro when they serve pre-made cafeteria grade food.

Reservations usually get swooped up 180 days in advance, so if you plan on eating here during your vacation, it's a good idea to put in a reservation as soon as possible. If you did not check far enough in advance, there is always a chance that someone will cancel their reservation! Check the Disney World App vigilantly under the dining reservations tab to see if any show up! Lunch times are also a bit easier to get a hold of, however during lunch time your dining party will not get a character meet and greet with the Beast... \\n\\nStaff: The cast members at BOG have always been pleasant and they always do their best to accommodate you. However, this is a pretty busy restaurant so you won't be getting super personalized attention. Once you order at the kiosk, the cast members will bring the food to your table by either tracking your MagicBand or the MagicRose. You are in charge of getting your own silverware, napkins, and drinks, the cast members are not required to bring you these items. \\n\\nAtmosphere: BOG is my favorite restaurant in Magic Kingdom. If anyone in your vacation party is a Beauty and the Beast fan, this restaurant cannot be missed. The food is subpar but the beauty of the main dining room more than makes up for it. The main dining room resembles the hall where Belle and the Beast dance and its gorgeous. If you choose to sit in this dining room, try to sit in the middle of the room, and not right by the window. If you sit by the window you won't be able to appreciate the falling snow effects and it takes away a little bit from the full experience. The Beast's lair is a dining room that has very dim lighting, thunder sound effects, and evokes a feeling of mystery. The enchanted rose can also be found in here and it makes for a fun photo-op. The Rose Gallery is a brightly lit dining room that makes you feel like you're inside a Beauty and the Beast themed music box. There are beautiful tapestries that hang on the Rose Gallery's walls and there's a huge rotating figuring of Belle and the Beast in the center of the room which, again, is an amazing photo-op. If not for the drop dead gorgeous dining rooms, I'd only rate BOG 3 stars, but it deserves that extra star for the ambience of the restaurant itself. \\n\\nFood: I was pleasantly surprised by the vegetable quiche the first time I ordered it. There had been a hidden mickey (formed by the mushrooms) inside of my quiche, and I thought that added such a cute touch to the dish itself. The second time I ordered it, there was no hidden mickey so I think it was just a happy accident the first time around. The quiche itself is mediocre, the toast or bread like item they serve with it was a 1/10 for me. The Master's Cupcake - which features \\"The Grey Stuff\\" as the frosting element on top is delicious. It's fun to eat because of it's appearance in the original movie and it gives you a chance to connect with the movie. The strawberry cream cheese cupcakes and lemon meringue cupcakes were also delectable, but if you're only willing to try one, I'd recommend the master's cupcake. \\n\\nRestroom: Numerous stalls, clean."},{"name":"Frasca Food and Wine","address":"1738 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"It was a prix fixe menu on the night we went, and there was also a recommended wine pairing menu.\\n\\nService was excellent and a major reason for my four star rating.

They were not quite ready for us yet, and walked us over to their sister pizzeria for a glass of wine.  When our table was ready, the host came to get us and carried our wines back to Frasca to start our meal; a very good first impression. Service was attentive throughout our meal.\\n\\nThere were four courses on the prix fixe menu.\\n   * Starter: Root veggie salad paired with Wieninger blended white of mostly veitliner (four stars)\\n   * Primi: Pasta with prosciutto, capers and tomato sauce paired with Costello Chianti Classico (three stars)\\n   * Secondi: Lamb meatball with polenta, brocollini and smoked mozzarella paired with Galardi blended red (three stars)\\n   * Dolce: White cake with vanilla ice cream (two stars)\\n\\nTo wrap up our meal, we also ordered a cheese plate with all Italian cheeses -- a blue, a pecorino and a triple cream.\\n\\nMy favorite dish of the evening was the root veggie salad. With sliced roasted carrots, small caramelized diced turnips, mixed greens (arugula, italian parsley), grated hard-boiled egg and dressing made with bocquerones (white marinated anchovies), it was the perfect balance of flavors and textures.  I like a small amount of anchovies in salad dressing since it adds a nice umami element.\\n\\nWeininger was a good pairing -- dry and fruitier than veitliners I normally drink.\\n\\nPasta was OK.  Pasta was perfectly cooked.  I forgot the specific name, but they were like thicker, shorter pappardelle.  Capers were a nice briny element along with prosciutto.  Tomato sauce was a fresher marinara style.\\n\\nCostello Chianti Classico was not a great chianti, and it was also not a very good pairing.  Sweetness from the tomatoes really brought out the bitterness from tannins in this wine overwhelming both food and wine.\\n\\nLamb meatball was ginormous, flavorful and well made.  Polenta was moist and I love brocollini.  I think the melted smoked mozzarella was not really needed.\\n\\nGalardi blended red was my favorite wine of the evening.  It was also well paired with the lamb meatball.\\n\\nDessert was a white cake layered with frosting that had the texture of white chocolate; kind of like a better butter frosting.

Before I go into a detailed review, here is the experience: bland and tasteless food, overcooked eggs, long wait times, poor customer service. Also, this review is from a month ago.\\n\\nGoing in I was excited that there was a vegetarian restaurant with such high reviews so decided to go in with 5 of my friends for a girls night. We were seated immediately as there were only 2 other tables (a family of 4 and a group of 5). Once seated we all ordered drinks and water, and everything started going downhill from here. The waitress served us three glasses of water and then completely forgot. After constant reminding, we got the remaining 3 glasses of water about 20 minutes later and our drinks arrived almost 35 minutes after ordering. If it was a busy night I would have totally understood but the barkeep was mingling with a table next to us and the restaurant was quite empty. That should have been the first warning sign, but we ginored it in favor of the trying out the food. While waiting for the drinks we decided to go ahead and place the food order and amongst us, we got the nest, the citizen power bowl, a fry basket, shakshuka, the homestyle burger, citizen burger and the assam burger. We ordered the basket of fries as an appetizer and we got them after a wait of an hour and 20 minutes..our food came out at 20 minutes before the fries. We had to constantly keep reminding the waitress, the chef when she dropped of our burgers and entrees and even the manager at one point(I'm assuming manager as the lady was asking the tables around us how the food was). \\n\\nMoving on to the food: We waited over an hour for the food and with the missing appetizer, it was a long and miserable wait.\\n\\nThe nest: described as poached egg on a fried vegetable strings and a bed of greens (the menu seems to be updates to say wilted kale as I'm writing this review) The eggs were completely overcooked and the field of greens was a bed of kale without any dressing or seasoning. For a menu that has poached eggs in many of it's dishes, its disappointing and underwhelming that it was over cooked, not slightly, the yolk was completely cooked. The whole dish was bland and under seasoned and eating a bed of kale (very fresh..not wilted) without any dressing is a horrible experience. I mentioned this to the waitress and she said she would have the kitchen make some more eggs and this took another 30+ minutes of wait.  When I got the replacement eggs, one was once again overcooked and the other was semi over cooked. At this point, I gave up and just asked for salsa and hot sauce and tried to go through the kale. They really need to get chefs who can cook poached eggs or have some sort of sauce or dressing to go with the nest.\\n\\nBurgers: Once again, all of them were under seasoned and very underwhelming. The assam burger which is supposed to have indian curry spices, the curry flavor was missing. They were all dry and a little dash of salt by the chef would have made a whole world of difference. \\n\\nPower bowl: ehh.. it's a salad, nothing impressive \\nShaksuka: Like all the other dished, bland and flavorless. \\n\\nService: There seemed to be 2 waitresses and getting any refills was at least a 15 minute wait, even for water and soda. Trying to get our waitress attention or honest answers to the wait times was draining. She seemed nice but I don't know if she was new or not, but it was frustrating with the long wait times and the staff continually telling us the food will be right out and repeating it every 20-30 minutes. \\n\\nI had really high hopes for this restaurant and I'm glad so many people love it but I would never go back in the near future nor recommend it to any of my friends. It has potential but there are a lot of kinks that need to be worked out."},{"name":"Sabrozon Fresh Mexican Restaurant & Catering","address":"17770 Pilkington Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4.5","text":"What is this amazing place?!? \\n\\nFirst time customer.

They don't crowd the table but they do pay attention to drinks and when the food begins to be completed by the table. The food options are NOT good and overly prized. You can meet the beast in the library and he even walks around to announce his arrival but it's a quick little wave to the room, not even long enough to pull out a phone and take a picture. The second time for dinner definitely pulled us from going ever again. They had changed their portion sizes and taken away items from the menu that we came back for.

It was our go to wing place. We routinely order online and pickup food to go. Twice in the past they have told us they did not receive our order when it printed and asked if we wanted to wait. I chose to wait both times for my food and was there an extra twenty minutes. Tonight (11/16/15) I ordered online and my wife stopped to pick up our food. They informed her they did not receive our order. I had an email confirmation, my card had been charged, and my wife saw an unacknowledged order laying on the printer behind the desk when the employee checked. She was given the option to wait for our food. Tonight she was unable to do that and asked for a refund. The employee working originally told her that it would just go back to our card since he did not complete the order. He then said he is unsure if that is how it works and instructed her to return when a manager was in for a refund. He did not even give her a time frame as to when managers are in store. This is unacceptable, we should not be expected to return to the store an extra time to be reimbursed for an order we did not receive because of the employees mistake. I understand that mistakes happen, but there is no excuse for being unaccommodating and flippant towards customers. I will be disputing this charges with my credit card company and we do not plan to order from Wingstop again."},{"name":"The Mission Bar & Grill","address":"724 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"My first time at The Mission was about a week ago, and I didn't know what I was missing!

Well, a few drinks and a very gracious and excellent bar experience later with their extremely knowledgeable bartenders - one named Bill, I remember - we did get a seat outside.  But, first a quick note about the bar.\\n\\nI think I've only been to a few restaurant bars in any city with such excellent bar-tending service.  Bill told us more than any person should know about tonic, gin and vodka.  He mixed us drinks just to try them and also let us taste test some spirits to fully appreciate the flavors of our beverages.    Even while we waited, the manager/owner shared a small amuse bouche with the four of us to keep us satiated.  It was a delicious treat.  We could have stayed at the bar having a blast all night. \\n\\nBut, we did move to a table outdoors on the patio on a beautiful, breezy evening, where the wait staff proved to be as impeccable and knowledgeable about our food choices.  He chilled our Chianti to a perfect temperature and gave us honest and informative insight on the menu.  \\n\\nI think when it was all said and done, we were at Fino for around 4 and a half hours having the best time.

Of all the chaats I enjoyed the Dahi Puri and Papri chaat.  \\n\\nThe chaat come with ample mint chutney, yogurt sauce and tamarind chutney it tends to be more sweeter than other restaurants versions but they are good nonetheless.  There is plenty to share and they are refreshingly cold when served.  \\n\\nFrom the main dishes I highly suggest the chicken biryani, a rice dish layered with sauce, chicken, and vegetables that comes out fluffy,  spicy,  and so good.  The chicken is not abundant in the dish and mostly has small bones with very little meat but the focus is more on the rice for the dish.   \\n\\nI also recommend the chicken tikka boti, which is a boneless version of the chicken tikka (red grilled chicken) that is served widely in most Indian restaurants. It comes straight off the girl,  its spiced deliciously with warm buttery naan and a yogurt\\nMint chutney sauce on the side, definitely a good dish. \\n\\nThey have a variety of dishes that are traditional meals as well as American diner type meals like philly sandwiches, chicken clubs, fried chicken etc. They seem to be good as well. \\n\\nVery big dining area, with a prayer room for Muslim patrons and very nice and attentive staff.

I was NOT expecting to find good gumbo in this place. I just happened to be shopping nearby, realized I had missed lunch, and dropped in to grab a quick sandwich.  The daily special is 1/2 a sandwich and your choice of soup du jour or salad for $7.99. I got the 1/2 club (for an additional $1) on white and a cup of chicken gumbo.  I figured it would probably be some watered down, slightly Cajun flavored soup that bore no resemblance to actual gumbo, but at least it would be lighter than the other option - loaded baked potato soup.\\n\\nOf course, as soon as my meal arrived at the table, I could see that the contents of the soup bowl bore a remarkable likeness to real gumbo: dark, brown, thick stew with big chunks of chicken & andouille sausage, okra, peppers, etc.  I had to taste that stuff straight away -- oh, heavens! Don't you just love a pleasant surprise? That first spoonful was so dang delicious, I just kept eating until the bowl was empty, my poor sandwich sitting there with an accusatory frowny face that whined, \\"Hey, what about me? Sniff, sniff. I want to go to the party in your tummy, too.\\"\\n\\nThe club (with ham, bacon, turkey, swiss, provolone, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and bacon-tomato dressing) wasn't bad, either, although a tad dry in the first few bites until I reached the mayo & dressing.

Definitely recommend if you like fatty parts! Honestly anything fried is pretty phenomenal. Pickled vegetables did not disappoint either.\\nLast but not least the beef noodle soup was very yummy.

Well, not that the location is bad (29th and Guadalupe basically), it's that the strip mall that it is located in is kinda weird. It's more of an office park with a few shops and the restaurant up on the second floor. Very odd. Regardless, don't let this stop you. If you came here 3+ years ago and had terrible food, don't let this stop you either. That chef is long gone and the replacement is stellar. Still here are the great patio lounge area, the outdoor dining area, the comfortable interior and the award wining wine list. FINO also has absolutely fantastic food, offbeat service (in a good way) and some of the most incredible hand mixed cocktails in town. \\n\\nWhile you wait for your table, grab a seat in one of the comfortable couches on the patio and have one of their fantastic cocktails. The bartender changes the menu often and takes things very serious with locally sourced ingredients, fresh squeezed juices and specialty liquors. The menu will certainly have numerous items you've never seen or tried (even if you are a hardcore boozer like myself), so try something new. Classics are available upon request if he has the ingredients available (they make one of the best sidecars in Austin here - with cognac of course). Sangria is also fresh made and delicious.  If you are a fan of hand crafted cocktails, you will be in lala land here, almost all at $10 or less.\\n\\nThe menu claims to be Mediterranean but isn't typical of that type of restaurant for the most part. There are a wide variety of unusual selections on most evenings, but rest assured that everything will be terrific. Sea bass is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, flatiron steak is melt in your mouth good, paella (for two) is served in the more traditional style with crispy rice at the bottom and dry sausage on top. Soups, salads and appetizers are also very strong.   I often come here, look at the menu and think that nothing sounds good.   Don't know why I do this, but whatever I order, I'm always absolutely delighted with.\\n\\nService is strong but not over the top kiss your ass. Your server will have a personality and will show it, which I tend to find appealing. \\n\\nThey've recently added brunch to the menu - no buffet, but plenty of solid options to get your day started. \\n\\nValue is very good for the quality of the food. Don't be fooled by the location - you will enjoy your meal here. The patio is extremely pleasant in the evening.

It's a bit more of a process because you essentially have to make your own wraps, but its so worth it. \\n\\nLunch time rush can get pretty crowded so if you are going for lunch make sure you get there early or after the rush. But they are pretty quick with their service so tables clear out fast."},{"name":"Chile Verde","address":"4852 Sawmill Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Above and beyond any food considerations, we got the best service EVER.

I wish they wouldn't have moved to prix fixe. It's the reason I won't return, even though I loved my first two experiences.\\n\\nThe main dining room (the ballroom) is gorgeous and where I always asked to sit. Our second time there, I requested to be at the far end along the windows, where you can enjoy the \\"snow\\" falling outside, and it was my favorite experience. The rose garden room feels like a generic and inelegant dining hall to me. The west wing room is dark and theatrical, with lightning cracking and thunder rumbling, and the famous magic rose situated nearby. I find the lights to the kitchen (and the noise) take away a little from the overall experience, however.\\n\\nThe Beast is available for pictures during dinner service. He makes a grand entrance after his scheduled breaks and greets each dining room (to a heavy stream of applause) before heading back to the library. It's a really fun addition that adds a bit of magic to dinner time.\\n\\nBack to the prix fixe menu, I simply don't think it's a good value if you're visiting multiple times wanting to try different offerings. We don't always want dessert either, so having that factored into the mandatory price is a downside. The new dessert platter is a set variety of three mini desserts. While the white chocolate cup shaped like Chip is cute, the novelty is not enough to sustain my interest in receiving it over and over again for every meal. Surely, they'll mix up what's included from time to time, but BOG's desserts aren't the best in the park, in my opinion. I don't want to eat them, so I certainly don't want to pay for them. The \\"grey stuff\\" is not that delicious.\\n\\nDuring our last visit, we sent my husband's filet back four times, due to it being improperly cooked. The final time they brought it back, we noticed they hadn't even prepared him a fresh steak. They had incinerated the last steak and served it to us black on the outside and gray on the inside. We were astounded the manager would even present it to us, as a point of pride. We ended up getting his meal comped and a fast pass for our table, but my husband was only able to finally eat his entree after an entire hour had gone by and everyone had finished their meals.\\n\\nThat being said, the main reason we won't be back is due to the prix fixe menu. I still recommend you go, if you haven't been, but advise you to do the math when selecting your dinner options to ensure you are getting the best value. Also, don't settle for anything less than perfect. Yes, you're at Disney, but that doesn't mean BOG holds itself to higher standards than any other restaurant. You're a paying customer and shelling out a ton of money. Don't be afraid to speak up if poor food or service is ruining your magical Disney experience. That is still paramount to their culture, and they'll make good when they mess up. \\n\\nI'm still giving BOG four stars despite my dislike of the new menu and our filet fiasco, because I love the ambience of the restaurant and think first-timers will enjoy their experience here. If you haven't booked a table six months in advance, don't worry! Keep refreshing the booking site nearer to your vacation. Spots open up all the time for various group sizes. I wouldn't bother calling to beg them for a table. Refreshing the website is your absolute best bet."},{"name":"Casa Chapala","address":"3010 W Anderson Ln, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Without having tried a BITE of their food I have to give this darling little establishment a huge shout out for the kindness of their staff.

The highlights are of course the deep-fried wild sockeye salmon (fresh, flaky, and not too oily), the organic rice and quinoa (fluffy consistency), and the avocado slices (rich and buttery). The salsa provided on the side is a must as well - it surprisingly works to elevate the burrito even more! \\n\\nVALUE: If you order the Salmon Tempura Burrito separately, it is already $11.95, so why not add a bit more for an organic salad (leafy greens topped with avocado and a tangy sauce) and a choice of pop (cane sugar cola, black cherry, or Perrier) as well?

That being said, I was so so happy to find this bakery and finally be able to satisfy that sweets craving I had from seeing all the gluten-filled Mickey Mouse cupcakes at our resort and at all the parks. My husband and I shared two Samoa donuts, a mini apple pie, cinnamon roll, lemon tea cake, and a cookie bar. They were all amazing and you could barely tell they were gluten free...also, don't judge our sweets consumption lol it was vacation and we ate all that over a week's time."},{"name":"The Consulate","address":"10 10th St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"So mad!!

We booked about a month ahead and got in just fine!\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant includes three themed dining rooms -- the main ballroom, the west wing and the Beast's library.

Overall, it's a fun experience, but don't expect the best gourmet dinner you've ever had. The food is pretty decent, but the point of dining here is definitely the experience.

Their food menu is French-inspired, and they accommodate all dietary needs. The chef came to our table for my gluten allergy, and he was able to serve me a delicious dish of sauteed shrimp and scallops. My boyfriend ordered the braised pork and said it was excellent. We considered ordering an app; however, they brought us a ton of bread (both glutinous and gluten-free).\\n\\nOur food came quickly, but I felt a little rushed. I think they were really trying to get guests in-and-out quickly, because of the wait and massive list of reservations. It would have been nice to enjoy another glass of wine after dinner, but we did have the rest of the park to see.\\n\\nIf you have kids, this location is a little pricey and they may not want to sit still for a three-course meal.

That's why this Burgerville is so confusing to me. To preface, I come to this location pretty often, as it's within walking distance from my house. I can see where they wanted to go with the concept, but the execution doesn't reflect what it wants to be. It's right in between being a sit down restaurant and being a walk in fast food joint, but doesn't commit either way. There is an awkward podium and a worker with an iPad ready to take your order. Depending on the day, the employee will either have you order from them at the podium or sit you down (I feel like the employees are even confused about this still). I don't really mind the limited menu, but the service should probably be quicker for having such paired down prep work. After you're done, you bus your own table.\\n\\nIt's a new process for Burgerville, so i'm sure it's a lot of trial and error with making things more efficient and having adequate staffing.

I ate here for breakfast, so no Beast, which was fine as I used the reservation to get in the park early and before the crowds.  \\nI liked the fact that it was Quick Service and could order ahead of time.  I ordered the kids French toast.  It was actually pretty tasty and I liked the fact that I got some fruit with it, too.  It was pretty pricy for breakfast ($14).  I also ordered the Masters Cupcake so I could get the Grey Stuff - it was ok,  it sure I see all of the hype.  \\nIf you pre-order, you get to jump past a few people and the ordering kiosks.  It was pretty cool how they can find where you are sitting as it is open seating once you are in the dining room.  The pastry plate they bring you is pretty darn good, too.  Too much for one person, so I shared mine with a table next to me that had 3 boys.  \\nFor me, eating here for breakfast was a once and done - glad I did it, though."},{"name":"Fresh To Order","address":"860 Peachtree St NE, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is more of a 4.5 star review, but I'll round up since I really really like f2o.  I've been several times for lunch.  No complaints at all, but I feel like this place would be absolutely fantastic with just a few small changes.  \\n    All of the food I've had has been delicious.  Especially the soup.  Very well seasoned and always fresh tasting.  I'm a fan of the corn chowder and I'll definitely be trying some of the others soon.  The salad menu has plenty of variety since you can choose from several different salads, a handful of dressings, and you can opt to add protein.  (I have my eye on the grilled shrimp.) \\n    I just wish the soup and sandwich menu had a similar level of variety.  Don't get me wrong, everything's really good already, I just feel like a few more items or some rotating daily soups/sandwiches would really take it to the next level.

I sat at the high top bar area with a friend and the bartender waited on us. We were starving and the service at the bar isn't the fastest, as we all know, so I was concerned about the wait time. What really helped was the trivia game that was played while we were there. It was great being entertained while waiting for our food. Unfortunately, our appetizer, the mellow balls, was not good. Because of the name, I expected round balls; instead they looked more like pillows. Due to the poor technical skills,( they were inconsistent in size), so some of the \\"balls\\" were hard and inedible. On the pizza side, the crust was the star of the show, however, I felt that the crust lacked thickness to withstand  the amount of toppings.

Sounds precarious, but it all holds up very nicely with little mess on the hands.   There are also burritos, which feature all sorts of delicious, health-conscious Japanese fixings within an actual tortilla; the tempura yam and tempeh preserves their crispiness nicely within the burrito's folds.  Kurumucho's salads are also prepared with nice touches:  densely packed with finely chopped ingredients and tossed in a balanced, tangy-sweet sesame dressing, offering a range of flavor in each bite. These dishes, even if they lean much more towards the Japanese side than the Mexican side, work out incredibly well, and make for a splendid lunchtime treat or takeout dinner. \\n\\nThe sushi selection in Vancouver is so enormous, and of such great quality, that it's easy to overdose and feel like a different spin on things from time to time.

Not exactly sure, but they did have a dinner menu on their updated website.\\n\\nThe menu did not list the steak sando as having horseradish mayo (see previous review). I was stoked! Alas, when I got my sandwich, it was slathered on thick as well as the mustard. I should have clarified that the sandwich did not have the mayo, but as it was not listed on the menu, I didn't think I had to. Anyway, the flavors just don't mesh.

Where else can diners have a quiet and relaxing meal that's accompanied by the picturesque feel of having the Boston Harbor in the background?\\n\\nI'll avoid going into detail about the ambiance or decor of the establishment as seating was done outdoors.  For those in Boston during a sunny warm summer day, take a seat outside facing the Boston Harbor, the tranquil and relaxed feel will put anyone at ease.\\n\\nThe Food...\\n\\nFried Clam Roll:  If the review can be summed up in one term, it would be the following...  FRIED!  The excessive and overzealous use of batter on the clams took away from the natural meatiness of the clam's composition.  Further consumption of the clam roll will render an endless boundary of fried batter encasement making the clams almost undetectable.  From the few clams that were discovered, the natural sweetness of the clams was no longer present.  Furthermore, the texture of the clams appeared to be almost rubbery.  One praise that should be rendered, despite the excessively fried texture of the clams, the roll itself was not exasperating oil.  Furthermore, the perfect amount of sea salt used in the application made the roll enjoyable to consume.\\n\\nLobster Roll: Mashed Lobster Meat is combined with a generous serving of diced celery, mayo and sea salt.  Upon consumption, patrons will find that the meatiness of Chart House's rendition is subtle compared to a traditional lobster roll.  The large chunks common in this application was nowhere to be found.  Perhaps this was the intent of Chart House, as the texture of the lobster worked remarkably well with the celery and mayo used in the construction of this roll.  Furthermore, the natural sweetness of the lobster was amplified by the earthiness of the celery and creaminess of the butter.  The mild hint of salt used in the application further elevated the meatiness and sweetness of the lobster.  From a construction standpoint, the Chart House's Lobster Roll stands out as being well executed.  Although the flavors are subdued, it was nevertheless a good rendition of the classic New Hampshire export.\\n\\nWithin 45 minutes, lunch was complete!  Although the Fried Clam Roll left much to be desired, the Lobster Roll was able to make up for the Clam Roll's downfall.

They seem to be going less of a concept, I think, and doing more straight forward food.  We started with a bunch of the small plates.  Normally I'm not a big fan of small plates, because, they are, as the name suggests, small, and I hate paying $10 for something I get one bite of.  Their small plates, however, are  actually a good size for sharing, and there was plenty of each to go around the table.  The mac and cheese was delicious, and the local sweet corn was a knockout (I was kind of surprised that corn could be that good, to be honest.).  The fried oysters were really well done.  For mains, I had the lamb which was cooked perfectly and was so well seasoned.  It was served over sauteed kale, which made me feel virtuous.  My dining companions had the snapper and the boneless fried chicken, which were both really good too.  Another surprising standout, the biscuit that came with the chicken...crazy good!   For dessert we shared the deconstructed oreos and cheesecake.  The cheesecake was good, but I am in love with the oreos.  They have such a rich cocoa flavor, and they are just such a great treat.

But this felt like a restaurant designed by people who had never been to a restaurant.  In order to order and receive our food, we had to interact with 6 different people in ways that mostly made absolutely no sense. \\n\\nWhen you check in, you divide your party up by check and each party gets a plastic rose and a menu. You're then funneled into another line, where you're told a bunch of warnings about how you will be ordering your food from a terminal and how the rose is involved in the process (it's all wrong, though.) You eventually get to another host, who separates each party and sends them to different terminals.  You throw the instructions out the window, and a third host takes your order verbally and scans your rose.  (At this point, after we've left, I still have no idea why the rose was scanned.)\\n\\nYou're then instructed to go find a table and sit with your rose and receipt. Eventually, a fourth person comes by, and picks up your receipts, reads them, and writes down what you've ordered. I have no idea why we did the whole thing about the rose and the  ordering from a person at a terminal, considering we essentially just had a waitress come to our table and take our order - you know, what normally happens at a restaurant.\\n\\nThis person leaves and does not return. There's another bad handoff to the person bringing our food (all food is carted around the place on little trolleys - don't know why we couldn't just order from the trolley person at this point..) who does not know what we've ordered, and has to read all our receipts to find out, match them to his set of receipts, and then give us the right dishes. \\n\\nAs we start to eat, a sixth person comes by and collects our roses, first asking if we are waiting on any food. Apparently, as she tells us, the rose is to indicate we're still waiting on food. Weird, and we're not sure why the roses had to be scanned, or why they were never picked up, but whatever. \\n\\nThen, later, the _same_ woman comes by again and asks us if we've received all of our food. This was apparently NOT what the roses were for, since she'd already taken them and asked us at that time. \\n\\nIf you want to have a hard-to-reserve (180 days in advance?

So if you are walking in, please don't forget to jot down your name, otherwise you might not be seated for a long time. This restaurant is small but they can still manage to sit approximately 40 people within the restaurant. They have 3-4 booth seating along the right hand side of the wall and the rest are just regular table seating. Also, during dinner hours they do get pretty busy so if you don't want to wait, you can always order take out. They offer a 10% discount if you order take out too!\\n\\n\\nWe ordered the Chicken Karage ($6.25). I feel like the flavor was average and could've used a bit more flavor. This Chicken Karage is not boneless, so it is chicken wings and drums. \\n\\nFor sushi rolls, we ordered Oshinko Roll-pickled radish ($2.25), Negitoro Roll ($2.95), Salmon Avocado Roll ($3.95), Alaska Roll ($4.75)  & chopped scallop roll ($4.45).\\n\\nFor all their regular rolls, I thought they were average.\\n\\nWe decided to order one of their special rolls to try.

He says HWBBQ is about as good as it gets in these here parts.\\n\\nThe place is a little tricky to find. Watch for Home Depot on the east side of 82nd. It's in a building in their parking lot. You cannot see it from the street.\\n\\nThe place is curiously upscale, in appearance, for a Que joint.\\n\\nI grabbed a deuce by a window and parked it. It didn't take me long to pick a half rack of Baby Back Ribs, Baked Beans, Collard Greens and Cornbread. My pretty and vivacious server, Toni, brought me three bottles of Sauce; Mild, Medium and Hot. She warned me off the Hot and expressed a preference for the Mild. I pinkie tested each and found them all very good.\\n\\nThe Cornbread is served with Butter and Honey. It's so sweet and cake-like that the Honey was not necessary. It is much like that found at Bo-Mack's in Albany. Wonderful! The Ribs were excellent. HW uses a good dry rub and they would have been just fine Sauceless, but I used all three Sauces sparingly and to good effect. They used Navy and Kidneys in the Beans. They were sweet with Molasses and tangy with Mustard and Vinegar resulting in a superior end product. The Collard Greens were not bad and the addition of Bacon and Rib Meat enhanced their flavor. I always compare Collard Greens with those I used to get at the Smokin' Swine BBQ trailer. So far none have measured up.\\n\\nThe food was mostly outstanding. The service was good.

There are no men in aprons with huge knives cutting huge slabs of meat on wooden cutting boards.  Just waiters and waitresses walking around in their white aprons that go all the way to the floor (like P.F. Changs).  But when they brought us menus...they were paper with typical BBQ food choices!  BBQ brisket sandwiches, chopped pork sandwiches, etc.  I thought it was a bit overpriced but some might disagree.  The food was ok but to me there was nothing special about it.  They had a stage so I'm assuming they have music on certain nights.  If you want to try this place for yourself I would recommend going when there's a band playing so it will distract you from everything else you might seem confused about.

We also had garlic prawns, but nothing special to write about.    Love the decor and the staff is nice.\\nI had a salad of the spinach variety and it was light and tasty.  Baby spinach leaves were used, nice.  Goat cheese was nice (if  you like it).  My friend had a steak but it was average and compared to being \\"not as good as the Keg\\" in Richmond.  It was a bit overcooked.  So when it was resting it cooked through, maybe they didn't take it off the grill early enough.  It was tasty though.  The guys had Mahi Mahi.  Cmon guys, Mahi Mahi?

My girlfriend had the salmon and it was prepared to her specifications, which is kind of bland with no seasoning or sauces on it. I had the shrimp, which was in a garlic sauce, which was a little too rich for me, but most people would like it this way. If anything was deficient, it would have been the service.

When you do order the half-and-half broth combo, make sure to mix in a generous portion of non-spicy broth to the spicy one to tone it down. Treat your stomach right and it will do the same for you.\\n\\nOn that note. On a cold, rainy day when you are feeling like warming up with some delicious food cooked in flavorful broth, head on over to Happy Lab Hot Pot. Or when it's warm and clear out, but you're still craving hot pot, it's also a good time to head on over to this restaurant located in Central Square. \\n\\nThey have two delicious broth options. One is a flavorful rich broth that will be enjoyable before and after it reaches your stomach. The other is a hellfire that will turn all your food into lava once it reaches your stomach. But once mixed, those two broths make one amazing combination of flavor and heat, which goes well with their fresh veggies and the variety of meat options that they offer. \\n\\nTwo things that would make this place even better would be for faster service and for them to have few more broth options."},{"name":"Taco Loco Mexican Grill","address":"44 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Amazing Mexican food and their burritos are yum!

I've called Orlando home off and on for 15 years and during that time have patronized just about every sushi place there is. For the past few years whenever my wife was in the mood for sushi she forced me to go to Ginza, they have great hibachi but very bland sushi. Today I Yelped for sushi and decided on Mikado in Metro West, we arrived at 4:30pm just as they opened for dinner, we were the only customers at the time and were greeted promptly and chose to sit at the sushi bar. I ordered their Out of Control roll and my wife got the King California roll, the Out of Control roll could have been the centerfold in Sushi magazine, it was amazing, delicious and a warm, cozy burst of comforting goodness to the mouth and senses. The King crab roll was what a California roll should taste like but boring compared to the many delectable choices on the menu. I should also mention the Miso soups were as good as they get and the salad with ginger dressing was a delight to the taste buds. I also ordered a tuna nigiri to see just how fresh the tuna is in its naked state and i was not disappointed, it was melt in your mouth goodness that you can bite in half without worrying about having to tug at it with your teeth to get it in two bites.\\n\\nThe sushi chef then presented us with a freshly cut arrangement of oranges with umbrellas in them for being the first guests of the evening, they were juicy and delish and a great way to cleanse the palates in the end. I drank green tea while my wife had a delicious unfiltered sake. I would have liked to have gone for lunch for the lower prices but we had the urge for sushi and I just had to try Mikados, the above items set me back almost 50 dollars, very expensive in my book and compared to places of equal or superior quality in Japan, Thailand, Vegas and yes even Reno, Nevada I could have gotten more for half the price. I miss the revolving sushi bars I first encountered in Tokyo and have only ever encountered stateside in Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington where you can eat each roll for a dollar. Not as elaborate as the signature rolls at Mikados but easily as fresh and still extremely satisfying. mikados will have to be a once a month treat and only if I can get there before 3:30pm next time. So if you don't mind Amura, Kobe or Seito pricing do yourself a favor and take your mouth to sushi taste bud heaven at Mikado."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"So the food here is yummy--better than most Magic Kingdom restaurants you'll stumble upon.

Had a wait of about twenty minutes, which was not bad at all considering how packed the place was and that it was a Saturday night. When we were first sat it appeared our assigned waiter may have been in the weeds a bit so another immediately jumped in and said she would help us until he could, which was very much appreciated and respectable. We have all waited tables before so this was a good sign of a very teamwork oriented business to us. We all ordered drinks and the Strawberry Margaritas were on special (4.50-woo-hoo!) so that is what we had and they were delicious! Even with the amount of food I ate I still felt pretty, er, nice.;) We ordered the queso and it was delicious! Loved the salsa, too. Just very satisfied by the appetizers.\\n\\n Then came the most delicious thing EVER. I will say that most of the time when something has been built up for me, be it a food item, film, tv show, anything, I always tend to feel a bit disappointed when I finally get to try it, since there is no human way possible it could ever live up to its gloried hype. Well, the Stuffed Avocado is NOT one of those things. I could not, and still cannot, believe how incredibly delicious it was. I could have ordered two more of them and kept them coming like bar drinks it was so good. Just the right amount of spiciness with the sauce and there was a surprising amount of chicken and cheese inside. It was one of those meals that is satisfying from start to finish, and I have had a constant craving for it ever since. My husband had the fish tacos and was satisfied, but not blown away, saying they weren't authentic, though he has tried fish tacos at every possible location we have ever visited (including Costa Rica and Southern Cali) so this is a difficult feat for anyone to accomplish. My friends had the vegetarian version of the stuffed avocado (still amazing, of course) and the Tejanas Enchiladas (said they were great) and the Portabella Quesadillas (which they were crazy about).\\n\\nThe waiter we were originally supposed to start with came out with our apps, and was constantly there to check on us afterwards, always making sure we had drinks on time and in a friendly way.

Their food is fairly average on most fronts.  The curry is about what you would expect, if not a little watery.  The pad thai is served in a large heap and is generally unremarkable, but fits the bill.  But Thai Passion has one, unwavering positive leaning in its direction: it's crazy convenient.\\n\\nThe 7th street location makes it one of the best places to eat if you're caught on foot in the area or working downtown.  Likewise, their carryout is fast and reliable.  Where Thai Passion really scores is its late-night hours (they stay open until 3 AM!).  For night owls like myself, a 1 AM curry craving would be otherwise unheeded, but Thai Passion makes it possible.  The atmosphere is pseudo-fancy and the restaurant is very clean and large, with Asian-themed art and a fish tank that greets you at the door.\\n\\nThe location and hours also makes Thai Passion ideal for post-drinking munchies.  It's a welcome place to drift after a night on 6th or 5th or anywhere, for that matter.  Effectively, this is sort of the theme of Thai Passion: when it's convenient or you're desperate, it's perfect.  Just don't plan on making a night out of it, because you may be disappointed.\\n\\nThai Passion is a bit of a misnomer, because there are other Thai places in Austin to be much more passionate about, at least taste-wise.

Yes, we shared a bite - how can you not? Sadly, the flat-iron steak I ordered (medium-rare) looked much better than it was. There were two portions of beef on the plate. The first was flavorful, very unevenly cooked and very difficult to cut. There were several bands of gristle I had to work through. One end was a solid medium-well and the other end teetered at barely seared. Interesting. The second hunk of beef was just a bad piece of meat. It was almost solid gristle and fat and was completely raw on the inside. I started in on it and just couldn't do it. I called the waiter and showed him the cut of meat and he immediately winced. You didn't really have to explain much when you saw the meat. He took the plate away and a not-so-short 10 minutes later (my partners had finished their meals) brought me another portion. This cut was better but was on the raw end of medium rare.  I'm not squeamish and I do like medium rare but completely rare is not my preference. I wasn't about to complain again. The conversation was flowing, the service was absolutely stellar. The person cooking the flat-iron steak is the one that really gets my 3 star rating. First rule is to not send out hunks of fatty gristle. Second rule is to cook the steak correctly - especially when it's your second try.  Bummer.\\n\\n\\nOops.

I'm not as big a frico fan as everyone else, but it's yummy in an extra-special homefries way. But it's the pastas and mains where the artistry of what they are doing comes through. Lachlan has an amazing touch with ingredients, bringing forth the essences of foods and revealing their charms in combination with one another. For several visits I kept ordering the Long Farm pork with cherries--I can taste the delicate spice and the tender, juicy meat still. And if tomatoes are on the menu, they are always sublime, likeable ripe tomato just picked off the vine and eaten while you are standing in the garden. I don't know how he and his cooking staff do it, but it's brilliant. \\n\\nI have lots of friends with special dietary needs and Frasca's staff have always been accommodating. (It helps them, of course, if you call ahead and tell them any of these in advance.) \\n\\nThe wines are stellar here and the staff so very knowledgeable that it is worth splurging--if you tell them what you like, they will always help you find a great wine. \\n\\nOne of the things that sets Frasca apart from other fine-dining establishments is their attention to detail. They keep a customer database, which means they not only remember you from previous visits but they also know what you like. Every time we've dined there, we've felt special, and not just because we're willing to spend a lot on a meal.

I also found out they do not actually dispose of old eggs, but use them to make \\"batter\\" or something of the sort.  The cooks are wearing gloves but are constantly wiping on their dirty apron, which is rubbing up against counters and stove tops, then going back to handling food.

It was not busy nor crowded in here, and they had plenty of people working.  Well, half were working, and half didn't seem to be doing much of anything.

The salad of farm greens, peaches, and tendrils were lightly dressed. Almost flavorless but was salvaged by the sweet ripe peach chunks. The tagliatelle was hearty and comforting, earthy from the thyme and rich from the fontina. The pork loin was a little dry and overcooked, the arugula was the highlight of the dish, tossed with some sort of balsamic reduction, cutting sharply through the indulgent meat and hearty beans. I always feel like tiramisu is a cop out as a dessert, simple, straightforward, easily assembled hours ahead of time, no real ingenuity required. The only deviation from the norm were the bing cherries, ripe and bursting with flavorful juices. \\n\\nThe service was also careless and sub par. Mom and I opted out of the wine pairings, server forgot and brought over red wine glasses. Returned moments later to retrieve.

My bill was $15.90 for a large pho and a vegetable curry noodle soup. I circled the $15.90 that was printed on the receipt and I even wrote it again in the total area and circled it again. Then, I added some cash to the tip jar. After dinner, I happened to be online perusing my bank account and noticed that my account has been charged $17.49 by Pho Jasmine. Being a math teacher, I used my acute addition and multiplication skills and noticed that Pho Jasmine decided to add another 10% to my bill, apparently for their tip? \\n\\nHey ladies, I already tipped you! Not because your service is amazing. Not because you're extra friendly. I tipped you because I have been a server and I know that servers rely on their tips. I also know that cash tips are way more awesome than card tips because you get to take them home at the end of the night. In fact, that is exactly why I tipped you with cash and left the receipt tip space blank. Oh, by the way, I know you saw me put your tip in the tip jar because you were watching me struggle to fit the cash in the jar. So, this means you are ripping me off $1.59 because A) you deserved more than that, B) by the time I left you forgot I already tipped you? I really don't care which it is. It's called theft.

My noodles was inconsistent, a quarter of it was undercooked so it textur was hard. The meat did contain the essence of Bun Bo Hue with the different type of meat (Pork Hock, Ham, Beef). Spicy rating of 5 not too hot and not too mild. Would have been perfect except for the sweetness.

This location, just north of the Brookwood Interchange, has been popular with folks in the neighborhood for years.  It's a good place to come for reasonably priced Mexican food and drink specials.\\n\\nThis place is slightly nicer than the typical casual Mexican eatery.  I'd say it's on par with La Parrilla, another Atlanta Mexican chain.  Because the restaurant is often busy, the atmosphere is energetic, lively, and sometimes loud.  A lot of Tech students like to come here.  There's an outdoor patio which is a good place to eat when the weather is nice.  I like it because it's tucked away in the back, away from noise of Peachtree Rd.\\n\\nI've been for dinner on a few different occasions.  At dinnertime, you can expect to spend about $10-15 each for most entrees.  Lunch specials (Monday-Friday, 11am-3pm) are no more than $8.50 apiece and there's a Sunday brunch buffet that starts at 11am and lasts well into the afternoon (4pm).  The restaurant always seems to be running various specials, such as $8.99 fajita night (normally $13+).\\n\\nI've tried a handful of items including some dips (cheese, beef & cheese, and guacamole), fajitas, Tampiquena steak, and some of the combos involving tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and tamales.  In general, everything is decent.\\n\\nI do like the chips and salsa.  The chips seem fresh, aren't too oily, and the salsa isn't runny.  The cheese dips are flavorful and rather thick.  I probably like the guac dip the best.  It seems freshly made from ripe avocados.\\n\\nThe fajitas are very filling.  I like to get the steak fajitas.  Chicken and shrimp are available as well.  The steak strips are served still sizzling with onions and green bell pepper.  Sides include shredded lettuce, guac, sour cream, salsa, rice, beans, and corn or flour tortillas.  I prefer flour tortillas for both taste and texture (smoother and softer).\\n\\nThe quality is the steak is OK and isn't rubbery nor old.  The same can be said for the Tampiquena steak, which is an 8-ounce ribeye.  The steak is marinated well so it's quite savory and sufficiently tender.  I ordered it cooked medium.  It'd be nice if the portion size for the steak was bigger, but only because it tastes good.\\n\\nThe combos are par for the course when it comes to Mexican food.  The combo plates come out super fast and are loaded with melted cheese.  While not bad, I'd steer clear of the combos menu and order one of El Azteca's specials instead.  You'll probably be happier as the combos tend to be pretty generic.\\n\\nService is fine.  It can get slow on busier nights.\\n\\nFree parking is available in the rear."},{"name":"Canton Buddha","address":"2900 Peachtree Rd NW, Ste 115","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Excellent food, I recommend the Hunan chicken with fried or white rice!!!

I put more effort into this review than the Mission apparently puts into making their food.\\n\\nAnyway, I will assume the rest of your food is equally suspect, overpriced, and boring.

I really really want to like this place, but they often make it difficult. The constant menu changing and price increases are very frustrating (about 4x of them in 3 years). In their most recent one, they  took fajita and chilie relleno burritos off of the menu (arguably their best burritos) and although they will still make them, they charge 10$ for them now (before this they were 7$). I find it odd that this is 2$ more then their steak or chicken burritos. charging 2$ more for a burrito that contains only vegetables compared to a burrito with steak or chicken doesn't make sense to me.  Furthermore, although the burritos on average taste good, about 1/3 of the time i get a burrito that is extremely soggy or is outright the wrong order.  \\n\\nAfter their new menu rework and price increase, i am still willing to get takeout here, but as a customer i expect better consistency.

I find them adorable.  Munchkin cats, mini cupcakes, teacup pigs, baby carrots, little people. I squeal and giggle and bounce over them. I am the embodiment of that Family Guy clip about asian girls with the 'tiny phone, tiny dog, tiny purse, *looks down shirt* TINY EVERYTHING!!!' This is a huge reason why I love Teatro. So many tiny little plates of orgasmic deliciousness and epic awesomeness.  \\n\\nA few of the standouts: \\n\\nThe eggplant rollatini with ricotta, tomato and basil. Sweet Raptor Jesus. This may be the most delicious appetizer I have ever had in my entire life. I would probably eat eggplant out of a dumpster, so there was no way I WASN'T going to like this dish, but the bubbling, oozing assortment of cheese and ricotta and fresh tomato is at once simple, but incredibly delicious and memorable. I would order three plates of it if I wasn't concerned about making a spectacle of myself. (NOTE: while lots of the dishes are little, do not make the mistake of thinking they are not filling! An appetizer split with a friend, and one of the small entrees will do ya just fine!)\\n\\nAlso noteworthy is the spinach and mascarpone ravioli with creme fraiche and parsley, the wild mushroom risotto (both cheesy deliciousness hitherto unknown to man) and the truffle oil and parmesan fries. Oh and the calamari. GET the calamari.\\n\\nThe white grape cosmo is so far my favorite drink at Teatro. Extremely refreshing, perfect for a scorching hot Boston night :) They have a creative cocktail menu, great selection of beers and an extensive wine list as well.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is gorgeous and trendy, while still classic looking and refined. Service is excellent, the staff friendly and always ready with a recommendation.  \\n\\nTeatro is right on Tremont, directly next to Loews Theater, yet I've never had to wait for a table or a spot at the bar. It truly is a little gem hiding in plain sight."},{"name":"Sabrozon Fresh Mexican Restaurant & Catering","address":"17770 Pilkington Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is run by really nice people, but the food is not that great.

His response was 'I guess the customer is always right. Never mind what I heard or didn't hear, you must be right.' Then he said that because of me he had to throw out most of the sandwich he had made since he thought it was a regular 12 inch.

The tables were large enough that you didn't feel crowded and there was also enough room between the tables so that you didn't have to squeeze through. The dance floor was a little small for that many people, but everyone packed in and even danced in the areas between the tables.  \\n\\nThe highlight of the evening was the Eddie Palino band. They played a great mix of songs from the 60's to the 2010's and mixed up enough slow dances with faster paced numbers.  The musicians performed very well, and the trio singing were very good.  I'd give them 4 stars!  They were a lot of fun to listen to and they kept things moving.  My only complaint was that they stopped just after midnight.  I would have liked to have stayed for more.\\n\\nThe food was less spectacular.  The caesar salad tasted like it was freshly prepared with large portions of parmesan cheese shaved on top.\\n\\nThe Pasta Valentino was also very good.  The portion was large and it was warm when served.  The Valentino sauce was very much like a carbonara sauce and was very tasty.  \\n\\nMy Beef Medallions were also good.  Tender and cooked medium, they had a brown gravy that was seasoned well and complimented the meat.  Other people at my table were less impressed with the beef medallions.  They said that they were tough and overcooked.\\n\\nThe Shrimp Caruso was not very good.  It looked like shrimp in creamed corn (and unfortunately, looked as though someone had thrown up on the plate).  The shrimp were way overcooked and rubbery and the sauce didn't really have any flavor to it.  Most people at my table did not eat their portions.\\n\\nThe cheesy mashed potatoes that finished the main course had good flavor, but they were very runny.  \\n\\nThe Tiramisu was very nice as the final course for the evening and was very flavorful.\\n\\nService was a mix.  The waitress who took our drink orders was wonderful and kept up happy banter with us.  It seemed as though she were the only waitress taking drink orders in the room, but she was as prompt as could be expected with that large of a room.  The assisting wait staff were mixed.  Our water glasses were filled quickly and often. \\n\\nOverall, we had a very nice time at La Scala (this was our first time there for the New Year's Eve party).  I was disappointed in the food as I had expected better quality and preparation from them.   I doubt that we will go back next year."},{"name":"ReelHouse Boston","address":"6 New St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Only went there for drinks, which were good.

I have never had a positive or pleasant experience with him. Just last week, I ordered a spinach bagel with herb and garlic cream cheese. I asked for lettuce and onion on it. The bagel and flavored cream cheese comes to 1.96, and extra veggies (if they even charge you- sometimes they don't) are .47 cents each. When I went to pay, he charged me for a \\"garden vegetable salad bagel\\", $4.00. I said no it is not, it is a bagel with cream cheese and extra veggies. He told me no, was persistent, and said if anyone has been charging me otherwise, they are wrong. Now a garden vegetable salad sandwich includes deli cheese and ALL vegetables/pickles (about 7- you choose). It is a clearly different item from having cream cheese. So according to the MENU, charge me the bagel and cream cheese + extras. Don't make up some comparison that I ordered a veggie sandwich. OR change your menu. I handed him back the bagel because I wasn't going to be overcharged for it. \\n\\nThe people inside also are not the most professional or friendly. I witnesses two workers making fun of a man ordering bacon on his cream cheese bagel, right in front of him. Of course, they were not doing this in English.

Lots of tea choices from Blacks to Greens to Rooibos and more. You have the option for making each tea a latt√© version of it as well with a 75 cent charge for each tea latt√© you order. On your table, you have the option to add white and brown sugar cubes and honey. The waitress will ask if you want any cream or milk with your tea as well. The waitress also pours your tea for you but there were times when they would spill the tea and create a puddle under your cup... nice gesture but it's okay to let us pour and not make a mess. Anyway, onto the teas...!\\n\\nHeavenly Cream was a black tea with a vanilla focus. It was creamy and had a smooth, rich vanilla flavour! With a little milk and brown sugar it was even more delightful! \\n\\nTake Me to Neverland was another black tea with nice hints of chocolate and peppermint. It was sweet, rich tea but the peppermint almost made it refreshing. At the end of our meal they gave us a sample of this tea to take home and brew too!\\n\\nIt was such a pleasure to sample all my other girlfriends tea as well but the waitress was more than welcoming to change our teapots if we wanted to try another tea. Endless teas... a dream come true!\\n\\nThe food wasn't as good as I thought it would be. My favourites were the savories. Curried egg-salad sandwich had a mild sweet curry that was balanced well with the egg and cucumber. The Everything Bagel had everything to make it delicious - can't go wrong with smoked salmon! The scones were dense and chewy, with the jam it was pretty good but the top part of the scone had WAY too many sugar crystals. Sadly the 7-layer chocolate cake didn't live up to the hype I read about... it wasn't cakey at all, it was more of a super rich chocolate fudge. I was expecting cake and was left disappointed. All of the other sweets were just too sweet and I didn't finish most of them.\\n\\nOverall, the tea and service was really good but the food was hit or miss. In the end, I have other high tea places I'd rather go to for slightly less in price, but maybe coming here for just a tea and savory item might be a better choice for me next time I'm here."},{"name":"Frasca Food and Wine","address":"1738 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"This truly is as good as it gets.

I wanted something different to eat for lunch that day, besides the Happy Teriyaki food, which is also on Sandy Boulevard. And, I was tired of my other lunch choices-microwaved canned ravioli, or brown-bag-leftovers.\\n\\nI hesitated to walk in, since I don't really like bar and grill joints much.\\nBut I was feeling bold that day. Once inside, I was tantalized by the smell of food being cooked. It smelled  strongly of grilled steak, onion-rings, and a hint of something garlicky-perhaps spaghetti or pizza. \\n\\nBeing famished, I grabbed a menu from the bar, and sat down at a small, cozy booth in the corner. A waitress appeared quickly, and told me that they had daily lunch specials. On that day (Friday), the special was a grilled ham-n-cheese sandwich, with your choice of sides-fries,\\npotato-salad, or cole-slaw. I said yes, and chose cole-slaw for my side dish. \\n\\nMy sandwich was hearty. It featured thick-sliced ham, and gooey, melted American cheese. It came with a few sweet-pickle chips, which were a delicious garnishment. The cole-slaw was in a small plastic cup. It was tasty, but a bit on the watery side. The soup of the day, was clam chowder, featured every Friday. I had a cup with my lunch, and was hooked from that day on. Their chowder is rich and creamy.  It seethes with juicy, tender clams, and big chunks of vegetables.\\n\\nThe decor is a bit run-down, but not seedy. It's brightly-lit for a bar, and\\nhas some cheery wallpaper. This place has been around for a while, and the retro-factor has it's charm. No one could say it's a flashy, yuppified bar-it reeks of well-worn, corner-bar character. \\n\\nThe Blue Diamond allows smoking indoors, which I didn't like. I'm a dedicated non-smoker. So, after that first visit, I always got my food to go. Their food is above-average, especially their clam chowder (which is way, way, above average). I recommend the Blue Diamond.

You do get many food options. There is a slight African theme and some exotic flavors, but everything really tastes the same.  They do not have French fries for the kids. But they will be happy to bring you a plate for an additional 6.00.  Which is crazy considering you can go next door to Mara and get them yourself for half that price.  There are no characters or special experiences here.  However, they charge just as much as the character buffets.   It is loud, crowded and expensive.   The longest lines of any Disney buffet. Unless you really like to eat large amounts of food or taste many dishes go to Jiko for a more authentic experience.   Better Disney buffet can be had at chef Mickey and you get to meet the core crew or Germany for a fun show and big beers."},{"name":"Via Napoli","address":"EPCOT World Showcase - Italian Pavilion, 1510 Avenue of the Stars","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Quality Neapolitan-style pizza with Florentine-style service.\\n\\nWe skipped appetizers (although I did get a limonata, which I expected to be sparkling and was... not.

This hefty roll of your choice of 3 things (I split 2 with a friend, so I tried half of each) definitely fills you up and has high quality taste and homemade love written all over it. I really liked the combo of manchacado (shredded beef), eggs and potato. There's not a ton of beef there, but it flavors it just enough for that wow factor.

We were so excited to see that we had one in GA to go to.  Unfortunately, this turned into one of those \\"Live and learn\\" situations. We came in with our kids to share our eating experience. This was NOTHING like the one we had tried before. You come for a great salad bar as well as delicious meats being carved fresh before you upon the flip of the \\"Go\\" card. (in Aruba its a wooden dowel painted on both ends to flip). Green to go and red to stop.  We should have known better when we drove up to the location in a run down parking lot at a run down strip mall.  Still hopeful we entered. After the debate of where to seat a family of 5. we ended up at a table for 4 with a chair in the isle for people to walk into. I was told they can only seat 4 and refused to put 2 tables together. We began with the Salad bar. I was expecting the marinated array of mushrooms, Seafood, fresh mozzarella & tomatoes, abundant selection of olives, seafood chowder etc. that I had at the other. Unfortunately, I had to settle  for unseasoned macaroni & mayo, Lettuce and canned sliced beets. Mushroom soup which contained no mushrooms? was this Campbell's? I would find better food at a Golden Corral with my kids.  OK.. that was gross. onto the meat. I chose the Rare card and we all had cards on green. We waited while someone would actually show up with some meat.  Other comments left by Yelpers could not be any more true regarding the slowness of the staff here. We were each given a \\"Cheese roll\\"? which was the size of a mushroom and we all assumed was raw inside. Could they spare it? I really didn't want to eat the salad bar, it was ridiculous.  Finally some meat showed up. Although my card read Rare, good luck finding it.  I was told that dinner included 16 types of meats. We were lucky to see 6 of them. I finally complained that all we kept getting was Rump beef and chicken.  I demanded some Filet!  Never saw a Ribs, Sausage, etc. The meats they served were very tough and disgustingly enough had to be spit out by all of us throughout the entire meal. There was no Mashed potatoes or Chimichurri sauce or A-1 on the table. Nothing like the Brazilian we were at.  We never had to turn our cards over to Red to stop the carving of meats to the table due to the slowness. We had a couple of bottles of wine which were said to be of a $30 value each but in reality online I found under $10 each.  We then were informed that like it or not we were charged a mandated Gratuity of 18% for our party. This was a Joke considering....  We spent over $200 on this dinner and it was truly nothing like what a Brazilian should be!!! NEVER again.   All I can tell you is do yourself a favor and go to a Texas Roadhouse if you want good meat.

Paired with the meat are baked beans and corn. You finish with an out of this world strawberry shortcake.

We went with the Yueungling and our waiter kept bringing us more unprompted whenever we were below half a jar of our current serving.

It was my first time visting them during normal weekday hours. We walked in to the counter and ordered cappuccinos. The barista asked if it was togo or \\"for here\\", and hence we said \\"for here\\". Yet, we recieved our coffee in the to-go cups. I know this is a very tiny error and I may even seem difficult for bringing it up, but I am a coffee addict, and if I am visiting a coffee shop to sit and enjoy a cup of cappucino, I expect it to be served in a cup, like its suppose to be.\\nIt may be an error on my end for not specifying the barista to serve in cups instead of to-go containers, and hence I would definitely give them another shot. My second issue was that the cappucino simply missed out on the foam. When I opened the to-go cup upon taking my seat, it was simply a coffee with cream (did taste like a cappucino though) without any foam.
