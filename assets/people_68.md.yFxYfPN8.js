I would recommend this place and I would go back again.\\n\\nThe Background:\\nParking is a little hard to find, as far as I can tell the only parking spot nearby is either street (metered) parking or the lot (paid per hour I think.)  The restaurant itself is nicely nestled in the middle of the street and is quite reminiscent of the colonial south.  Inside the building, there are tasteful gold accents and mirrors around the building.\\n\\nThe Positives:\\nThere is a friendly wait staff who has no problem sitting down to help you with your order or providing tourists, like myself, information on places to do and see while in Portland.  While my waitress didn't know much about the tourist attractions, she was nice enough to get someone who did.  He sat down with me and gave me directions and places to visit which I thought was pretty nice.  As for the food, it was pretty tasty and was your run of the mill healthy/upscale breakfast food. I ended up ordering the tofu scramble which was quite a bit of food.  While pretty good, it was a little bit bitter but the ketchup I added over the potatoes definitely balanced it out.\\n\\nThe Negatives:\\nParking for the place can get expensive.  Also, from what I'm told, there can be pretty ridiculous lines to get a seat.

Clearly, whatever flavors were supposed to fuse didn't get put in.   The dan dan noodles were also boring.  There was a spicy kick, but again, no flavor to speak of.

I had a long night of costume making ahead of me so I thought I would take my chances with a mint mocha latte. I like mine not too hot, and more chocolate than most. yummy... They nailed it!

The main dining room (turn left when you enter) is situated on the corner so there is ample lighting coming through the windows. The second area is referred to as The Velvet Lounge or the bar/cafe area (turn right when you enter) which is much cozier. It is decorated with black furniture (10 tables, chairs and booth-like seats), and the general ambiance is in colors of black, white and gold. One wall is exposed brick plastered with several large gilded mirrors. Several chandeliers drop from the ceiling to provide some additional light. There is a bar area with granite counter top which would be a nice place to grab a drink. All-around, it's a very nice place to spend eating any time of the day, breakfast, lunch, dinner or for some drinks.\\n\\nWe stopped here for breakfast after hearing good things about this place. Since the main dining room seemed to be half-filled with mostly business people, we sat in The Velvet Lounge for its cozier ambiance. After following a suggestion from our waitress, we decided to order the French Press Coffee (32 oz. for $6.95), which comes in a large metal carafe. The coffee was quite delicious with a stronger full-bodied flavor. If all you're looking for is a caffeine fix, you'll probably be more than satisfied with the regular coffee, but if you want to go with a stronger coffee, try the French Press Coffee.\\n\\nFor breakfast, I ordered the Greek Frittata ($9.95), an open-faced omelet with fresh spinach, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese & kalamata olives. It was the perfect combination of saltiness from the feta cheese and salty sourness from the olives, and the sweetness of the sun-dried tomatoes. All the ingredients mixed together without overpowering each other, making for a very tasty omelet. On the side, was a serving of potato wedges and whole wheat toast for carbs.\\n\\nI also tried the Biscuit Breakfast ($9.95), consisting of homemade buttermilk biscuits topped with country sausage gravy, and served with two eggs any style. The buttermilk biscuits were crumbly and buttery and served with a very delicious country sausage gravy. The dish was very rich and hearty, which I could easily find myself indulging in, but not on an everyday basis.\\n\\nTable service was also decent, our waitress was not the friendliest but she checked up on us several times through our meal. She also dropped the bill off early in our meal, just in case we were in a rush, but let us know we could take our time.\\n\\nFor breakfast, Mother's Bistro & Bar is a definite bargain: cheap prices with huge portions and quality dishes. If you're in the area, I highly recommend checking this place out for a great dining experience in both ambiance and food."},{"name":"Mr. Bones BBQ","address":"1201 Barbara Jordan Blvd, Ste 1230","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"I don't think I need to go back to Mr. Bones. The hostess wasn't sure what table to seat us at because there was a party in the back, but the whole front of the restaurant was empty. The decision didn't seem that difficult. \\n\\nThey were out of beef ribs, they were out of potato salad, they were out of turkey brisket, they were out of wheat bread, they didn't have hot tea or coffee, they were out of pickles. Every time we asked for something we could only get half because they had run out of everything else. \\n\\nThe beef brisket was dry but the flavor was ok. The BBQ sauce was pretty good. The baby back ribs were ok, also dry and their chicken was also just ok. I ordered stewed okra and tomatoes. The okra was really mushy and overcooked and I kept finding pieces of unchewable stem and onion skin. It was really unpleasant. The dirty rice was fine. Nothing was really amazing except their mashed potatoes, go figure. \\n\\nOur waitress was easily confused. Maybe it was because they were out of half the kitchen, so she had to think about things extra hard, but I don't think \\"We want the family meal, plus a pound of baby back ribs\\" is such a hard concept. Instead she kept telling us that you can't get ribs in the family meal. We tried to explain that we understood that, we wanted the ribs IN ADDITION TO the family meal. I wanted a Big Red from a bottle instead of from the fountain and she kept fighting me \\"but we have it from the soda machine.\\" Yes, I understand you have that, but I also see that you have bottled Big Red, I want the bottled. Yes, I understand that it is more expensive, I still want it. When we paid in cash she counted out the cash we handed her right in front of us.

If I had to pick one, I'd say the Emmylou would be my favorite, but like I said, all of them are good. As for the donuts, I tried all of them. All of the Nutella ones taste very similar after awhile.

Boulder is awesome and if you're traveling because you like staying in nice hotels and taking advantage of their amenities, I'd pick a different city; if you like to explore, want a good location and a good price, and just need a clean and totally serviceable hotel to crash in, this is an awesome option -- would definitely stay here again at these prices.\\n\\n-- I was in a one-bed king room next to the elevator (435).  It was small.  It was renovated (and my 3 coworkers didn't say anything about having un-renovated rooms so I assume all of theirs were too, even though we were on a dirt cheap rate and the hotel was busy).  It was totally clean and pleasant and well designed; I imagine the rooms with two beds are a better option for those concerned about space.\\n\\n-- My favorite thing: the hotel is right on along and awesome jogging/biking trail that goes directly to the gorgeous downtown area (CU Boulder main campus, Pearl Street, library) and in the other direction, out to some of CU-Boulder's other lab facilities.  It's about a 25 minute walk downtown, running along the picturesque Boulder Creek, and I chose to do this every day instead of ubering or looking for public transit.  Gorgeous, safe, and friendly.  Try cutting across the stream to walk through the university campus or get to The Corner.  Google maps' walking directions will show you how to use the path to get where you're going.\\n\\n-- Breakfast was good, very fast, and reasonably priced for full service -- around $13 for eggs/bacon/hash browns/coffee.  Didn't eat any other meals there.\\n\\n-- They use their rec/gym facilities as a gym for Boulder residents, too, and it's not updated but was clean and they do have a ton of options -- indoor pool, outdoor pool, outdoor hot tub, indoor and outdoor tennis courts, basketball courts, weights/treadmills, etc.  \\n\\n-- There was a massive conference going on in town and we were able to get $112/night the week before arriving.  The fact that this was the only (govt per diem rate) hotel available inside the greenway was my reason for suspicion/looking up the Yelp reviews in the first place, but I'm glad we stayed there and not at the chains in Boulder County/Fort Collins, but now I think my concerns were totally unfounded.  Every Boulder resident/worker I talked to knew where it was, that it had been renovated recently, and many had stayed there previously - everyone seemed to have positive impressions of the hotel.\\n\\n-- Shower/bathroom was small but well appointed - vanity with room for personal effects, clean, plenty of towels, hot water was plentiful and quick, and the bathroom had a pocket door to preserve space.\\n\\n-- Noon checkout and automatic-if-requested 1pm checkout was generous considering that they were busy.  3 out of the 4 of us were also able to check in early, around 12:30pm.\\n\\n-- Free Keurig coffee in-room, and an empty minifridge.  No minibar.\\n\\n\\nDownsides:\\n\\n-- Room was certainly on the small side.  Big closet/luggage rack but no drawers.  Fine for just me, and I wouldn't plan on spending much time in a hotel room if in Boulder, but still.\\n\\n-- Everyone was very friendly, but I sometimes had a hard time getting someone on the phone to set a wake up call or ask a question.\\n\\n-- The smoke alarm went off when I showered with the door open.  Not my favorite, but easily remedied and had no trouble if I shut the door. \\n\\n-- One coworker had a room that was over the conference space, which was super far from the front desk; he had trouble finding it the first time.  \\n\\n-- My room didn't have much of a view\\n\\n-- The hotel's not gorgeous from the outside\\n\\n-- Can only exit the hotel via car in one direction, which can make driving directions a little harder\\n\\n-- No easily accessible outlets near the head of the bed (but multiple reading lights)"},{"name":"Pho Thien Vietnamese Cuisine","address":"10041 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Pho was so-so.

The wine sauce it was served with was really nice. The risotto seemed very undercooked. When I'm at a fancy place, I tend to think everything must be good and I never complain...like, maybe I just don't \\"understand\\" the food. It tasted pretty good, but the texture just got to me. I still have it sitting in my fridge, and I don't think I'll ever eat it honestly.\\n\\nMy cousin had a scallops special and my boyfriend had shrimp wrapped in bacon.

I wish I had gotten our waiters name, he was AMAZING. I mean, one of the best waiters we've ever had before. He was so friendly and understanding of her being in a bad mood, he showed us the kids play area (a specific area for kids to play that has books, toys and such ) , he even brought some of the toys and books over for her to play with at the table. She still wasn't feeling it and was throwing the blocks across the room and dropped her crayons a few times on the floor, one of the busboys came by and helped us pick them all up and was SO sweet about it all.

They had an austin-y band (Wild Thing, Christmas songs, stuff they made up on the spot), a guy making balloon hats and animals, a guy dressed as a cow, etc.  It was all very exciting.  The food took a little longer than I expected, but you know, first meal on opening day.  I'll cut them some slack for that.  Our waiter gave us the wrong check, but that was quickly taken care of by a manager who was checking on people.\\n\\nThe food, however, was pretty good.  The burger I had (quacamole, bacon and something else) was just the right size.  Enough meat that you feel like you ate a burger but not too much meat that you're hurting the next day.  Good, well seasoned fries (hand cut so you get the fun, weird little end pieces sometimes), and the mix on the diet cokes was excellent.  I'm a bit of a Diet Coke snob, having had so much of it in the last few years, and maybe it was just because it was all fresh, but it was one of the best fountain Diet Cokes I've ever had.\\n\\nThey have HDTVs around, seating outside next to the playscape, and it's all around a nice little place to have a burger.

There's something about the combination of lemongrass, heavy use of ginger, pungent fish sauce and the like that doesn't quite strike that middle C note on my palette.  In spite of the light and fresh quality of the ingredients their dishes are known for, I've run into too many instances where those ingredients converged into too complex or heavy a result for my liking.  So I was a bit guarded to try another pho joint, which sat just down the street for me.  \\n\\nI was off to a good start with my first impression: I'd agreed to meet my brother and father there for dinner at 6pm, hoping to get a step ahead of the dinner rush, but the place was already packed; I had to fight my way to the far end to snag the last available table.  I was immediately arrested by the wall of aromas as I took in the place, and by the time I sat down and cracked a menu, I'd felt like I'd already eaten.  Looking up, I noticed a majority of the customers were Vietnamese and a few Thai -another good sign of the authenticity of the cuisine.  I'm with Bryant on this: the broth of the pho is my favorite part, especially a light chicken broth, but I was hungry and so on impulse I ordered the beef stew.  I'd inadvertently walked right into all the heavy and pungent elements I usually take care to avoid in eastern cuisine.  It was tasty but hearty enough for two meals, so the next day I pulled a groundhog day and went right back and went with my original choice: the light, the oh-so-simple, the signature noodle pho.  Now we're talking.\\n\\nEastern cuisine restaurants tend to be designed around utility instead of ambience, and Buckeye was no exception.  Clean and bright, but the atmosphere is the company you bring with you.  Oh, and it's loud.  Loud and bustling, like a New York automat, but in a good way.  Service was fast and cordial, but the whole restaurant was split between only two servers who were busting fifty kinds of ass running from table to table, back and forth from the kitchen, without a moment to spare.  Our party had a few questions about the menu, and any hesitation caused them our server to rush off apologetically.  \\"Be right back.\\"  This happened three times -so funny.  Lesson learned: if you go during rush hour and you're on deck, be ready to swing that bat.\\n\\nPrice was fair; I'd say in lockstep with any other pho joint I've seen in town.  The three of us racked up a $30 tab, so very reasonable.\\n\\nMaybe one day I'll come around to Vietnamese.  I love Szechuan, Thai, and some Japanese and Korean.  And when I think that it wasn't that long ago that finding authentic Vietnamese in Columbus was a pipe dream, I have hope that maybe I'm one nudge closer.  Of course, I circled the drain on sushi for 20 years before I decided it wasn't for me.\\n\\nBut I'll always have my pho."},{"name":"MOD Pizza","address":"5840 Roswell Rd","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Not bad.

Probably one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a while. Let me preface this review by explaining that I was here for a friend's birthday party which was about 20 people. This does not, however, mean that the service is allowed to slack by this much. Where to begin? First of all, we were divided into two tables of 10, which is fine, but i think it's a bit unreasonable to take orders from one table and not the other. The result was people ordering their appetizers and meals at different times and food arriving in a haphazard manner. My appetizer of chorizo queso took an hour to arrive, so there were others who had already completed their meals. The italian pizza was grossly oversalted and dry. \\n\\nFurthermore,  my friend had a birthday cake that should have been brought out because the server had put it in the fridge, but at the end of the dinner, no cake. We had to tell the server that it wasn't bill time because we still hadn't had any cake. And when it came to the bill... what a gong- show. How can you possibly keep track of anything when you jump from one person to the next in no particular order? The waitress processed payment from the person across me but then went to the other table and then took the bill from the person next to me and then went back to the other table for a bit and then thought it was all dealt with. I could have gotten away without paying if I didnt wave her down again after she had walked away. \\n\\nAll I have to say is get your act together when dealing with groups YBC! It's not like you don't deal with large groups all the time. Either train your employees to deal with large groups or have more than one server attend to larger groups!"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Loved this place!

Live music on the second floor will have your pulse racing.\\n\\nI was deeply impressed by Casey my waitperson. Even as the pre-6:00 quiet of my visit this past Monday night morphed into a fairly pronounced bustle during dinner hour, I never failed to get the impression he was taking care of me.\\n\\nAnother facet of the restaurant that's very encouraging is what amounts to two separate price brackets depending on which brand of 'cue best suits your budget. If you go for oak smoked, expect to pay in the $12 to $16 range. Oak grilled will cost you anywhere from $24 for the natural hanger steak to $40 for a sampling of dry aged natural bone-in ribeye. Given that I have a appreciation for oak smoked given I was a fan of Mann's Smokehouse BBQ and that, in this case, it seemed the more economically savvy move to make, I went the oak smoked route, specifically the brown sugar & coffee rubbed natural beef brisket. You get your choice of three sauces to slather on it. These are the house sweet 'n' tangy, mustard with black pepper, and habanero. Trust me when I tell you this brisket was divine enough that absolutely nothing is needed to mask the flavor. Tender as can be. Fine marbling. I'd order it again in a heartbeat.\\n\\nThe French green beans with almonds provided a pleasing crunch and zing at first bite. Do be warned though. You won't find that side on the restaurant web site.\\n\\nMy salad choice was their Iceberg Wedge with cherry tomatoes, shaved onions, smoked bacon bits, and buttermilk blue cheese. Deftly presented and very inviting on the tongue. The cheese drizzle won me over.\\n\\nFor dessert I picked the banana cream pie. Another heads-up here. The printable menu says it comes with candied walnuts. Not so. In fact my slice came with hazelnuts. The smokiness blended well with the luscious banana concoction. Sink your teeth into this and you'll know this component of the three squares a day package was given proper conclusion.\\n\\nAustin has much to proud of with its Second Street revitalization. Please make sure you include Lambert's when bragging to your pals. It's a boast well-earned. As the various tables spanning all sorts of age groups would agree, I'm sure."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Excellent in every way.

In fact, Lamberts' facade is so unassuming that in spite of only being a block away from work, it took this self-proclaimed BBQ connoisseur weeks to discover it. The historic building is literally engulfed by ultra-modern surrounding buildings, and looks completely like an old-school general store; which I guess it use to be.\\n\\nBeing hidden-in-plan-sight does not seem to hurt business; I went in for lunch, after 1:00pm, and the place was still packed. I snatched a stool at the bar and ordered the pulled smoked pork Cuban sandwich. The bartender wearing the fancy cowboy shirt was very nice (though probably not an actual cowboy given his footwear choice - converse tennis shoes).\\n\\nThe \\"barbecue\\" was tasty, but a couple of bucks more than I'd like to pay for a sandwich. This place is certainly closer to being \\"fine-dining\\" than it is to being a \\"BBQ joint\\" (most do not serve \\"Rainbow Trout\\" or \\"Mustard and Brown Sugar Crusted Niman Ranch Ribeye\\" for lunch). The menu does contain a more working-class priced Chopped Brisket Sandwich for $8, which I will try on my next visit. And yes, there will be a \\"next visit\\". Lamberts is now on my regular lunch rotation.

Do it. Do it now.\\n\\nAlso, do not bother showing up here after dinner unless you don't mind waiting in line.\\n\\nLet me rewind. We were here earlier in the day, before we even had lunch, and the place was empty. We told ourselves we'd come back at night, and we did.\\n\\nOnly this time, there was a line wrapped around the block. No kidding. It wasn't too bad though, because once you get inside the store, the line kind of split into 5-6 lines. There were lots of people behind the counter, and each of them was very quick. So the wait wasn't actually that bad. In fact, I think we waited around 30 minutes. \\n\\nThat means, though, once you reach the counter, you should know what to order. They aren't rude to you or anything, if you find yourself mulling it over, but it is just best for everyone (including the hordes of dessert-hungry tourists behind you) to just make your selections before you get to the counter. You can pretty much peek inside the glass case when you get closer. That probably means you do not really get a good glimpse of ALL that Mike's has to offer, which is why I suggest going before lunchtime, so you get the place all to yourself (well, almost) and can have time to peruse the selections.\\n\\nSo for us, we happened to be in the section where the Bostom cream pie was housed, so once I spotted it in the case, I made a quick decision and ordered it. I also got the carrot cake and an eclair. Both ginormous.\\n\\nOnce we got our treats, we headed towards the green space that separates Haymarket from North End. We dug into the Boston cream pie first. Between the two of us, that was gone fast. The yellow cake was light and spongy, custard was sweet and decadent, the chocolate icing was just the perfect finish. Carrot cake was next. The cake portion was good, if not a bit dense... the layers of cream cheese frosting were a bit much. There was probably a 2 cm layer of frosting between each layer of cake, not to mention the layer that was covering the whole slice. We ended up removing all the layers but one. It was then that the cake to frosting ratio was perfect. As for the eclair, I didn't break into that until the next day, and unfortunately by then, the pastry shell had hardened quite a bit. But they used the same delicious custard and chocolate icing as the Boston cream pie.\\n\\nYou will see tons of people carrying around Mike's Pastry boxes.

My hopes were almost entirely crushed at this point, but I gave it a fair chance and sampled everything at the table. The sweet and sour pork was some of the worst i've ever had - bland, overcooked, oily. The low mein was also very oily.

If something becomes too hyped I tend to shy away from it. I've never seen ET, Titanic, The Matixs, nor Avatar for example. My reasons vary. Some of it is I fear the bar is set too high for the hyped to meet expectations. And yes, a bit of unjustified egotism maybe present (I think I am just too cool for the masses.) But the main reason is that the hype seems to spread like a zombie epidemic that I want no part of, with a growing mass of followers bellowing, \\"you must take the chicken. Join us. The chicken is our master. Join the takeover. It's blissssss.\\"\\n\\nBe that as it may, I've decided to try it. Of course, being hype adverse puts me squarely in the contrarian category. Being so, I have a secret to share. I totally planned on be the first reviewer to pan the chicken. I was going to be honest of course, but I was going to be nitpicky as hell. If the chicken was good, I was going to find any small, ridiculous, petty reason for 3-stars; excited if I could justify 2; and stoked if I could do the holy grail, drop a 1-bomb.\\n\\nBut I just can't! I can't. What I had this afternoon was like Emperor Constantine seeing a Chicken shape in the sky. It was one of the best, if not the best chicken I have every had. The place reminds me of the food, environment, and style of various chicken, ribs, or pork spots in the OBX North Carolina, where I have vacationed at, or any of the roadside soul and southern food shacks that dot the highways south of Mason-Dixon. With the old, single window shack, the outdoor seating, the gravelly parking lot, and the long line.\\n\\nI ordered white bone-in breast with warm heat. I should have went with hot, as the warm flavor wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. The meat was tender and delicious. The side of Mac was awesome; my mother cooks the best Mac, so I am spoiled and critical of restaurant M&C-- but this is really close to my mother's, very rich and cheesy without going overboard. \\n\\nThe only real grip is the tea was a made a bit strong. It's free though, and was still good, so I won't mark them for it. It's sweet tea--tea with sugar in it.\\n\\nI do love the service and effort they give here. They come outside, hand out menus, and instruct the line how to order. This is something many new places forget--and it helps new customers, like me, feel comfortable. They ran out of wings, something they told us happens everyday ( so take note wings lovers: show up early.) when a few in line started to leave because of this, they gave the disappointed free pudding. Customer service and care like this would have me coming back even if the food was just meh. \\n\\nCome early--a line builds here quick. Though they are organized and things go smoothly, it can still be a 10-minutes or so wait. But it is worth it! Nothing else I can say that others have not except: \\n\\nYou must take the chicken.

I'd def put this as my second favorite happy hour spot after Uchi. The drinks are fine, but the food really stands out.  Most happy hour places scrimp on the happy hour menu, but ALL the bar food and appetizers are half off here!  I'm talking broiled gulf oysters, oak grilled hanger steak, and crispy wild boar ribs to name some of the tasty selections that are on the happy hour.  Happy hour runs everyday from 5 -7, and all day Monday at the bar.  \\n\\nGreat happy hour, but it is usually very crowded.  It is a good idea to make reservations and it is unlikely that you will find seating with a large party during happy hour.  Upstairs they have open seating and a bar, and you can make reservations for tables downstairs.  \\n\\nApart from the value and portion size which surpasses most happy hours, the food is tasty.  I usually order the oak grilled hanger steak which comes with avocado, fried egg, charred jalapeno butter.  I'd say the steak is about 6 oz, and well, it tastes like a good steak, tender and char-grilled to have that yummy carcinogenic flavor.\\n\\nThe waitresses are fantastic here as well.  Let's be frank, when a restaurant is crowded and a waitress is serving the happy hour crowd, it's just human nature that she'll be tired and terse.  I don't know why, but I'm always surprised at how cool the girls that work here are.  Last time, the oysters came out late, and they just comped them for us.  I wanted to be like... please just bring them out late every time. But, got to keep it classy.  Look, perhaps it's just my genes, culture, or that I just never worked in the food industry, who knows, but I tip between 15-17%, and half the time, it makes me cringe because I don't think the level of service deserves that much, but at this place, I'm always so happy to tip at least 20%.  Keep the free food coming.  :)"},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious. Craveable. Unexpected. \\n\\nHave you ever finished a meal and said to yourself, \\"I have to have that again.\\" HCT delivers. \\n\\nIf you are thinking about it, try it. You won't regret it. HCT hits the spot with its tender, juicy, and flavorful chicken 'n sides. Oh the sides...they could be a meal all unto their own. Joe, the head fryer, and co. have set out to bring hot chicken to the north and hit gold. \\n\\nTheir meat is tender, the interplay of the flavors is genius, and I like it a lot. \\n\\nThe white meat and dark meat hot (not holy hot) meals are completely different experiences. The dark is a bit heavier. I usually tend to like darker meat better, but with HTC I really gravitate towards the lighter meat. I get the glorious mac 'n cheese side (which is yum and not to be missed) with the cole slaw and the white meat. It all plays amazingly well with it's side kick--the most amazing homemade ranch you have ever had. \\n\\nPlain and simple: eat hot chicken.  Get the white meat hot chicken with mac'n cheese and cole slaw with a side of HCT ranch and it's pure bliss. You won't regret it. Also, be sure to cash in on their great sweet tea.

I wasn't about to argue with them so we headed off to Mike's.  From the minute you walk into the shop your sense of smell and site are stimulated.

They were YUMMY!  Definitely a treat.\\n\\nThere are no prices listed for the items and according to my friend you could go in on two different occasion, get the same thing and pay to different prices.  Since I have an inquisitive nature I had to test this out.  So, I headed into Mike's on my last day in Boston after I finished up the Freedom Trail, but before I headed off to the airport.  I have to say my friend's theory didn't hold up, but the taste of the cannoli's did.  I actually ended up taking one of them back with me and am I glad I did - my plane home was delayed half an hour on the ground and an hour or so in the air.  I hadn't eaten because I figured I'd get home at a decent hour for my next meal.

(See bottom of review)\\n\\nLet me first say, I've been to the place more times than I can count. Over a dozen times for the past several years.\\n\\nFOOD: I've had lots of things off their menu, never been dissatisfied with anything. Portion sizes are generous, prices are reasonable.\\n\\nSUNDAY BRUNCH: Love the brunch. Great options, great music.\\n\\nMUSIC VENUE: This is my favorite outdoor music venue in Austin. The sound is good, there's plenty of space, conveniently located bars, capacity is around 3200 people. Big shows, small shows, they're all good. I'm pretty much guaranteed to go to a show if it's at Nutty Brown.\\n\\nWhy not 5 stars?\\nCONS: RESTROOMS!!! During a crowded event (example, JABFest 2012, they were pretty much at capacity) they have a total of 11 ladies stalls in 2 different locations. One area has 8, the other 3. The restroom with 8 stalls had 5 that were out of order. 5!!!! Match that with at least 1000 women, the restroom line was easily 30 minutes. Who wants to miss a show for that long EVERYTIME you have to pee? Not fun. They need to maintain their facilities better. Especially during the event (restocking tp, soap, paper towels, making sure \\"accidents\\" were cleaned up)\\nThey do offer port-o-potties, but they're usually in a dim lit area, and rarely have tp.\\n\\nSUGGESTION: Walking paths. Making paths through the concert area would be wonderful. It's so hard to walk through hundreds of people, and a path that's roped off would be great. Especially from the bar by the merch booth, to the restrooms. . Even if the path takes you the \\"long way\\" it would still be better. Maybe one that runs parallel to the stage, but several feet behind the concrete standing area/dance floor, that way during a large crowded event you can get from one side to the other (either to go to the bar, merch booth, restrooms, or just to leave). It would really help the attitude of guests, as some of them can be quite rude and not understanding when you have to push past them to move anywhere.\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY: Go there to eat; Go there for Sunday Brunch; Go there for live music, but try not to use the restrooms during crowded events and expect to step on some toes (literally)."},{"name":"Punjabi Dhaba","address":"225 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Mmm.

It is despite my hatred of almost all fast food joints, I love Golden Chick... so.. so... much. \\nAbout 10 years ago (different golden chick in the DFW area) I use to fake doctor notes (told them I did monthly allergy shots, and they bought it) that I had to leave class early so I can make it all the way over to the other side of town so I could get Golden Chick for lunch while in High School. Even better they did a deal that allowed students of their near by high school to get 50 cents off, and I always lied about that too. \\nThe chicken is magical. Crispy and flavorful batter. Super moist and juicy chicken. I have never felt it was too greasy, or too dry. The real secret however, is you ask for the packets of spice. It is the best spice mix, with a bit of heat and alot of flavor, I have ever found. I put way to much on so it stings a bit and I love the pain. I even know some friends that don't like hot and spicy food, but admit to using a bit of this stuff because it is so good.   Best Chicken Strips Anywhere.  Chick Fil A is the only other fast food I will get, but I seriously can't decide which has better chicken (they are very different, so I get them depending on how I'm feeling).\\nI did stiff you a star however, and I will stick by it. \\nFirst: Golden Chicks in Dallas offer free ice cream (or ice milk, whatever, it is free and delicious) \\nYour fries kind of suck. I'm not the biggest fan of crinkle fries. Once again grew up on these delicious oh so bad for you double fried version. I can't find a single golden Chick that still has those types, but they were the best \\"thicker\\" fries from any fast food joint. Bring these back and bring the trans fat with them, they were good, crinckle are bad and many times soggy.\\nOne time I was here and the Manager called an employee an idiot, right in front of me. I couldn't believe it. He is always very nice to costumers and myself, and he seems to hustle alot... but every time I go back I think of that time.

At one point, the table behind us got up and left because nobody even came over with a menu once they were seated. In a nutshell if I'm paying $14 per drink, I expect it to come with a dash of service; I shouldn't have to flag down my waitress and wait 10 minutes between drinks and I certainly shouldn't have to give my neighbouring table my menu because the waitress is busy drinking beer. The food is meh, but then again it may have been better if it showed up warm. Oh wait, that would require a competent waitress and that's something doesn't exist at Diamond. \\n\\nIf you are in the mood for fancy cocktails and a dim lit bar, check out guilt and co across the street or Chill Winston for great eats!"},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"View is amazing, food is ok.

All other hostess with 4 people already grabbed what's available, so we asked if we can sit at the 6 person table. She told we can't, and we are not allow to go downstairs where there are 50 tables empty. As soon we we sat down at this table with no view, all other hostess started walking people down for the tables with view. Whatever, she has no sense so be it. Then we got our waitress who was clearly high on drugs. When asking her stuff she will response 3 seconds late. We asked for drink refills, never came. Chips refill, nothing. Even checks we waited and waited(no, she wasn't busy). She will look at us and walk by us many times with the stuff we need and still can't remember that we asked. The chicken sandwich was cold. The burger was tasteless. I left totally embarrassed with the type of service. They had a sign stating \\"interview onsite, hire immediately...\\"the type of people they hire and the food don't justify the view. And certainly not worth a $60 lunch bill with a high on drug no service waitress. Seriously, you can go to the side of the restaurant and snap a picture for free. then just run.

The chicken salad is definitely more filling as the chicken is plentiful, versus the ebi which honestly are just a few bland small shrimp that are blanched. If this was ebi mayo style shrimp on top instead I'd give it 5 stars.\\nOverall nothing really stood out. Dry ribs were small portion wise, downed it in a minute.

Cafe Intermezzo also has a few locations around Atlanta, but based on my experiences here, I won't likely be visiting any of those any time soon.\\n\\nI was here on a Monday morning and a Sunday morning. Neither visit went very well. The first trip, I thought I had enough time for a sit-down breakfast. Surely an hour before boarding is luxurious in airport time. I ordered a coffee and a side bowl of grits. My partner ordered an orange juice and an omelette. We waited. I scooted off to the restroom, which is around the corner. When I got back, the coffee and orange juice had still not arrived. Ok, 45 min till boarding. We were finally served with 20 min until boarding. Immediately, we asked for the check and even that took 10 min to process. And on too of it, the coffee was watery and lackluster.\\n\\nOn my second journey through the B concourse, I had less time and a lesson learned, but I wanted a decent coffee. Specifically, I wanted a cappuccino to see if a pulled espresso beverage would taste fresher than the coffee I had before. I ordered a 'cappuccino with an extra shot'. I paid $7. I waited about 3 minutes and the girl called out 'latte'. My fellow attempted coffee drinkers eyed each other and I asked, 'I ordered a cappuccino with an extra shot. Is that what you're calling a latte?' Indeed, it was mine. Now, coffee aficionados will understand the difference. I wanted more foam than milk. So here I sit with a drink that I'm pretty sure is a shot of espresso, topped with milk and weak coffee to fill a medium-sized to-go cup.

The highlight was the potatoes: homestyle, nicely seasoned, and tasty.  Unfortunately, all of our food was lukewarm, as though it had been sitting under the heat lamp for 3-4 minutes.  The french toast was chewy, the potatoes were well into a drying phase, and the toast was beginning to take on the toughened consistency of kevlar.  It didn't help that the salsa was portioned by the tablespoon (c'mon, man, give us a bowl of it to soften up this food!) nor that the ketchup was fermented in the bottle.  Sure, seeing little bubbles in a ketchup bottle looks cool, but the taste is far too kim-chee for me.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and assuring (\\"I'll get that for you right away\\" and \\"No problem - it's done\\") but committed the flaw of not noticing when our coffee cups were empty.

The apres-mass cannoli-craving horde was in full force. Folks were sort of queuing (out the door), only to to be rebuffed by a sales-lady who said that there was no one line, and urged the pastry-crazed patrons to 'push forward' towards the counter. As if they needed any encouragement. Now, if the pastry is good, I don't mind an unpleasant experience to get at it, but this wasn't the case. I decided to be as conservative as possible in my selections (as many of the sweeties looked like monsters from Doctor Who), so I got a ricotta cannoli, a chocolate-ricotta cannoli, and a slice of  tiramisu. When I had settled at a table to take a tentative bite of the plain cannoli, another sales-lady bustled up and asked us if we 'needed anything', and then proceeded to say that 'next time, we should wait to be seated'. Now, there was no signage that I could see that said one had to be seated, and the atmosphere of the place is more that of a rugby scrum than 'wait-for-seats'. Anyway...so, what I expected in a cannoli is a crisply-shattering shell, but these were leaden and greasy, and smelled like fried dough. Disappointing, though the filling was pleasant. Ditto for the tiramisu, which was a blob of slick, greasy buttercream with stale lady-fingers.\\n\\nThe unpleasant experience and the very sub-par pastry made me wonder why this place has so many favorable reviews on Yelp."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"As I was warned by all my friends, this shop was bustling with activity even though we came at close-to-closing.

Not too sweet, but not too strong either. \\n\\nOtherwise, they have such a diverse selection of pastries that you're bound to find something you'll enjoy.

This time the service was horrible!!!!! It looked like there were 4 servers and only 7 tables. After having the servers walk by me and my boyfriend without a \\"I'll be right with you.\\" or even pour us water, pissed me off. We waited for maybe 15 minutes before we had enough. Luckily there were seats at the bar, otherwise we would have left, which is what I wanted to do. The bartender was very attentive and made sure our experience didn't get ruined with the neglect of the servers who were doing a lot of chit-chatting amongst each other. Even the manager on duty was chit-chatting and either texting or doing something on his phone. Granted it was a slow night but very unprofessional. Don't let me see you goof off when you couldn't even wait on me. Again, thank goodness for the bartender who had every seat filled and still managed to make everyone happy. She was the only person who seemed to be busting her butt while the others were even dancing (the manager grabbed one of the waitresses and started to dance a bit). So if you have that much time on your hands, then why weren't you able to even come to my table to offer me water or anything. Instead just blank stares. I even noticed one of the hostesses give us a dirty look once we moved to the bar since she was hanging out with the servers chit-chatting away. When she did go back to the door, I noticed her talking to the manager and pointing at us. I thought maybe the manager would come up and ask if everything was ok. But nothing. He rather chit-chat with the servers and play on his phone. I can't say this enough, thank goodness for the bartender. We ordered the rice balls again (must have) and pizzas (the Bianca with roasted peppers and the meat pizzas). I did enjoy the pizza and was very satisfied with it. We even ordered the creme br√ªl√©e plain. Very good. If it wasn't for the food and the bartender, I would have definitely given this a lot lower rating. But because our experience did get tarnished a bit, I can only give it a 3 star review this time.

I had the sizzling rice soup, Mandarin scallops and kung pao chicken. \\n\\nThe sizzling rice soup had an exciting presentation with the hot, browned rice added to the soup at the table creating a sizzling sound and inviting smell.  The broth had a very light chicken flavor which seemed too insubstantial at first but turned out to be perfect for presenting the flavors of the seafood and rice without getting in the way.  \\n\\nThe kung pao chicken had a solid but not overpowering spiciness and not overly greasy as is too often the case with this dish.  \\n\\nThe highlight though was the Mandarin scallops which were lightly breaded with a spicy, tangy sauce.

The black padded studio-like ceilings are a little incongruous, but definitely not a deal breaker. We thought we had settled on our dishes, when the guy next to us practically inhaled whatever he ordered, then ordered another to go. With that kind of behavior, we obviously needed to have whatever he was having. Turned out it was the featured Mom's goulash - not an appetizing word, but definitely a fantastic dish. It actually made the biscuits and gravy seem a little boring - not bad, just sort of pale in comparison to the tender pork, perfectly spiced sauce and delicate yet hearty spaetzle.

If you do go alone and want any chance of having more than just a nibble of dessert, put your meal together with appetizers.\\n\\nThe \\"problem\\" is you also get a not-stingy amount of fresh bread and probably french fries with your meal. These carbs, on top of large portions on their over-$20 mains, can suddenly overwhelm you with the quantity of food that you will sadly have to pass on dessert.

Veggie options are weak -- pass on the $10.50 veggie roll. Chicken Fricassee was very salty, which is either as intended or a fluke, but either way, watch out and maybe ask the waiter about it first. They will probably go easy on the salt if you ask.\\n\\nOther than this, food was well-prepared and tasty. Poutine was a tad pricey but that peppercorn gravy is star.

Their selection is much more limited but the quality and prices are a little better. For one, they fill their cannolis to order. Something every good bakery should be doing. I found the shell to be a little too on the savory side and the filling to be a little thinner than average but overall it was a very good cannoli and at $2.50 (a dollar less than Mike''s) was a good deal. They had a sign for pumpkin whoopie pies but sadly were out of them. Everything in the glass shelves looked a little subpar to average but I obviously can't judge by looks alone.

When we arrived a few minutes before 5:30, we were told by the hostess that they were running behind and we would have to wait awhile.\\n\\nNow, I've read a few reviews on here for this restaurant and clearly they have trouble keeping reservations. Like Seinfeld said, anyone can take a reservation but keeping one is a different story. It seems to be a pattern with this restaurant, especially when there's an event at the Garden. It seems like the upper management of the restaurant is telling their staff to either overbook reservations or take in walk-ins who do not have reservations or possibly both (probably hoping for cancellations or no-shows). Which is obviously a bad practice and needs to be changed, by the management, so that their floor staff isn't thrown to the wolves.\\n\\nThe hostess was definitely stressed. She was telling some people waiting that they were so slammed, that they could either wait over an hour or find somewhere else to go. She was apologetic and really handled the bad situation well. Clearly, it's not her call to make when it comes to overbooking, but she's the one having to deal with angry guests. And there were a few! A woman waiting with us was SO unbelievably rude to the hostess, it was shocking. Do you really think that the hourly-paid hostess is the problem here? No, ma'am. Complain to management - don't threaten or complain to the poor woman trying to mend the situation.\\n\\nWe were seated at about 5:50, twenty minutes after our reservation. (By the way, the rude woman was seated when we were finishing up our entrees. See what you get when you're unnecessarily mean?) Our waitress, Bianca, was awesome!

In walking up to this place, we noticed a few people outside the door... not too bad.  However, as we walked closer, we peeked into the waiting area and noticed a ton of people waiting.... DOH!  I think that was the only bad thing about our experience there.  It took us about an hour to finally get seated, but the full bar helped us to pass the time away.  \\n\\nIs it me, or do folks in Portland really love their Bloody Mary's?  A ton of people had Bloody Mary's over in the bar side.  In fact, we went to another place for brunch on Sunday and noticed at least 3/4s of the people had a Bloody Mary in hand as well.  Bloody Mary's aren't really my thing, but I digress.  My girlfriend ordered a bellini which was quite tasty... fresh peach puree in a bellini definitely makes a big difference in taste.

Even though I didn't get to try everything on that menu, the food all looked drool-worthy and made me want to come back again.

My wife and I came here on a friend's recommendation, as we liked the idea of inexpensive all-you-can-eat sushi.  I enjoy sushi, but not at the prices I would normally have to pay to get full on it.  So this concept seemed perfect.\\n\\nWe got here on a Saturday afternoon and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table (not bad, considering what we read in the reviews).  Once seated, one of the waiters explained how the system works.  Essentially, for $15/person you are entitled to everything on the menu (including the bbq meats and a huge pot of tea) but are limited to 8 sashimi/person.  To get your food, you simply fill out the little form and hand it to a waiter, who will promptly return with plates full of everything you ordered.  You may request this food as many times as you'd like, but are confined to a 1.5 hour limit.\\n\\nEverything that we ordered was excellent.  All the food seemed very fresh and each item was very tasty.  And we had fun cooking the bbq meats on the little fire right in front of us.\\n\\nNot knowing what to expect, we started with a small order but quickly realized that we were going to have to request more items and fast in order to get our monies worth and abide by the time limit.  One huge note of caution - don't get overzealous in ordering, as they will apparently charge you for not eating all the food you request.  This issue snuck up on us quickly, so we ended up gorging ourselves to avoid leaving food behind.  Next time we'll have a better idea of what to order and how to pace ourselves.  But this is an easy mistake as a first timer.\\n\\nWould I come back?  YES.  It is truly a great deal and certainly has satisfied my sushi cravings for months to come.  Would my wife return?

But I had to go with what they were famous for -- the cannoli's.\\n\\nThe mini cannoli's are not cheap, at $2.50 a pop. They come in either traditional ricotta filling, vanilla, or chocolate, and they are filled into the shell when you order and dusted with powdered sugar. I got one vanilla one and one ricotta one, but liked the traditional ricotta one better. The vanilla tasted a bit artificial to me. \\n\\nThe mini cannoli's are about 2 inches long, so they are shareable between 2 people, but just barely - it's probably big enough for 2 large bites, or 3-4 small bites.

A Chinese restaurant a leisurely 4 minute bike ride from my new house?!?! I discovered this yesterday and would have gone immediately, but I had the sense to call ahead and learned that they are, unfortunately, closed on Sundays. \\n\\nSo today I skipped breakfast and allowed myself to get really hungry for lunch. I rode down Ontario and enjoyed the scenery. Linden might be a high crime area, but strolling through the streets reminds me of suburbia in the '50s. Quaint little houses with neat yards, birds are always chirping, etc. \\n\\nI pulled into the parking lot and found a sign where I could lock my bike. The lot was surprisingly full. I walked in and quickly realized why - a party of at least ten, maybe fifteen were taking up three to four tables to the right.  There were three booths to the left, near the entrance to the restrooms, and some more booths around the corner from the large party. \\n\\nI looked over the menu briefly...standard layout: appetizers, beef, chicken, seafood, vegetarian specials, plus pad thai and other specialties.  I chose an order of the crab rangoon, a good gauge for quality comparisons because it's offered at all Chinese restaurants, and the home style bean curd, with a request for it to be made spicy.\\n\\nI took a seat at a booth around the corner and started playing around on my phone while I waited for my food (forgot my book, darn it).  There were only six booths back here. That totals 9 booths plus the 4 or so tables where the party sat. Each table had it's own squeeze bottle of sweet'n'sour sauce, spicy mustard, sriracha, soy and another mysterious red sauce that had a sweet taste, but was on the spicy side.  \\n\\nFirst my drink came out, then my crab rangoon. Now, the crab rangoon was really interesting. There was way less cream cheese used than most places, making the crab stand out more than any crab rangoon I can think of right off. I don't know if this is a more traditional way to prepare it, or just personal preference of the owners, but I really, really liked it. I expect the crab was still imitation, but the whole texture and flavor of the app was changed by the cream cheese ratio. Very good indeed. Just $2 and change for an order of 4.\\n\\nNot long after, out came my bean curd. It was served with two scoops of white rice and was piping hot. There were onions, broccoli, carrots and celery aplenty, and the bean curd was somewhat disheveled, rather than the perfect little shapes I'm used to elsewhere. I could be wrong, but it felt more homemade. The sauce gave me the same impression. It was thinner than expected, and more flavorful. I ate every last bite.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly and courteous. They seemed genuinely happy to serve their patrons. There were a couple of kids working, but I think they were just there to help out mom and dad. They seemed to be enjoying themselves.\\n\\nAfter all those glowing comments, you might be asking, \\"well, Luke, why the three stars?\\"  While this doesn't deter me at all, the cleanliness of the place leaves a little to be desired. The carpet straight up needs replaced. It's filthy.  Red with a permanent black walkway worn into it.  Better yet, refinish the wood underneath so you can mop instead of vacuuming. That's the ticket. \\n\\nThe ceiling has portions where the wall doesn't meet the ceiling and there is exposed insulation. the walls have these sort of unique, semi-badly drawn paintings adorning it. They too are in desperate need of a wipe down.  I don't get the impression that the restaurant is unsanitary, but I think they might be skipping out on a few of those really thorough cleanings restaurants are supposed to do at least twice a year.\\n\\nI will definitely be back, and I was impressed enough that Yin Yue will probably become a regular option for me.

First off, Chelsea, might look \\"rough\\" but it's harmless, and nothing happens here, everyones going about their day and we love living here, and we are two white gay men, walking around our fluffy white dog, that should give it a perspective. The city is doing a lot of gentrification, with new buildings, shopping areas, and neighborhoods that are drawing in a lot of transplants moving to Boston. Now to the food, we have been dying to try this place since we moved here, we've gone by it several times but just haven't had the time, till now. My partner and I got the thai iced teas, delicious! we got the fresh spring rolls, crispy fried egg rolls and taro balls, all were phenom, particularly the taro balls, they are a must! For dinner I opted for the Crispy Thai Basil Chicken, served with jasmine rice and a salad that the chicken is sliced over. I normally am not a fan of salads on a plate like that, usually a way to take up space and never get eaten. However the salad was a perfect accompaniment to the chicken and rice, it caught the juices from the chicken and made sort of a dressing, it was just delicious and i ate everything and almost the plate. My partner had the sauteed coconut curry lemongrass chicken, and he devoured it and i had a bite and it was quite delish. I was too fixated on my meal to worry about his. We did not get anything for dessert, but no worries we WILL be going back. My only downfall was that they do not accept credit cards, which is an issue for my partner and i because we always use our cards, but we can get over it cause the food makes up for it. The place itself is awesome, the owner plants flowers outside and hanging flower baskets from the juliet balconies, and little tables outside for seating. When you first walk in, it looks like any asian take out place, but go upstairs and you are transported to a fusion of decor, and it works. Open modern space, no one is on top of one another and we felt comfortable and ready to eat. The owner is super nice, talked to us about her dishes, and talked to us a little about ourselves and her passion for her establishment. This is a vietnamese and Thai fusion, so it is slightly different from a quintessential Thai Restaurant. Also I would to add that a previous reviewer wrote about how you can get better thai from a \\"real\\" thai place, honestly, I don't even know what you're talking about because I would like to know what  a \\"real\\" thai place in the USA is, and considering the owner herself looked pretty darn asian to me, I'm gonna say it's authentic.

We took a break from the parks on a Monday around noon. Luckily there was only a short wait & we got to browse the shop while we waited for our table. Our party of 3 decided to just share appetizers in hopes of getting to dessert. We ordered the pork belly sliders, onion rings, apple salad & totchos. The faves were the sliders & the rings. YUM! Too bad the tater tots were not fried extra crispy because with all the cheese & toppings, they ended up just being mushy. I definitely had better loaded tots at Johnny Rocket's & Teddy's Bigger Burgers. With all that food, we were too full for dessert. We headed back to the parks but on our way back to the hotel, we stopped at the take-out counter to try a Strawberry Cheesecake milkshake. THAT was another winner! It wasn't overly sweet but still delicious & we got to keep the mug! yay! At both locations, our orders came out in a reasonable amount of time & at the right temperature.

We weren't adventurous because we need to curb what we've been eating lately, so we went with a chocolate chip cannoli, a Neapolitan (napoleon), and Boston Cr√®me Puff. The cannoli shell was so delicious and fresh tasting, and the cannoli cream with chocolate chips, just to die for. The Neapolitan was good - came apart at every bite, so messy as expected. The boston cr√®me puff was a cr√®me puff with a chocolate shell on top of it. the cr√®me was not overly sweet, and surprisingly the addition of the chocolate on top didn't put it over the top.

I'm not sure why they have such low reviews?! People expecting a French trained celebrity chef? I thought the food was great! I got the chicken enchiladas. They were fresh and light. The sauce was amazing but not overwhelming, the rice was delicious, and the beans were good. It was a different spin on an overdone Mexican dish. Guac was delicious! My husband got the shrimp tacos and he enjoyed them as well, and agreed with me on the guac, beans and rice sides. The salsa and chips came for our appetizer and were great.

Apparently a different random hostesses had grabbed 2 menus and begun to walk away without SAYING A WORD or making any acknowledgement or eye contact towards us to indicate we were to follow her. She came back and rather rudely said \\"hey, you guys are supposed to follow me??\\" Off-putting.

Review was written 11/14/12.\\n\\nI used to tell myself that I wasn't going to bother writing reviews for businesses with over 100 reviews because with that many, they probably don't need my review and who's going to read it anyway? But I suppose it's good to support businesses I like, so here we go.  This review is only for the Somerville location.\\n\\nI think it was only last year that I finally made it into Petsi. I'd previously tasted their pies at a party and thought they were a bit rich for my taste. Because of their name I thought they only made pies so it never occurred to me to go. Then I found out they had other baked goods too!\\n\\nFor a while I was addicted to the raspberry jam filled cornbread muffins but I've moved on. Almost everything I've had was tasty, although sometimes I feel that it's just a touch richer or sweeter than I'd like. Most baked goods are quite large and I often eat half and save the rest for later. Other pastry favorites (in no particular order):\\n\\n* lemon scone - I always ask for ones with more icing!\\n* walnut fudge brownies - like crack and excellent on a bad day\\n* snickerdoodles - melt in your mouth goodness\\n* oatmeal cranberry walnut cookies - chewy & great mouthfeel\\n* cinnamon buns - excellent with a cold glass of milk\\n* sweet potato buns - reminiscent of pumpkin pie\\n* banana bread with pecans - not very banana-y and more like cake\\n\\nThere was one day the bacon cheddar scallion biscuit was calling to me, even though I hate scallions. The girl behind the counter told me she didn't like scallions either and that you couldn't really taste them. Around the outside where the scallions had been dried out, that was true but closer to the center where the scallion was still damp, I could taste it. I did find the outside delicious.\\n\\nI think the only pastries I haven't enjoyed were the blueberry muffins (can't recall what my objection was) & apple walnut cake (just didn't enjoy the flavor). \\n\\nOn the pie front, the pumpkin pie is decent, although a bit softer than I prefer. I like a firm pumpkin pie. I've also had the pumpkin bars and pumpkin whoopie pies which are both delicious but a little too sweet.\\n\\nThis summer I discovered the key lime pie. I never used to like key lime pie but after having it somewhere else I was craving it. Theirs is very thick - almost a cream cheese-like consistency. I wasn't sure what I thought of it at first but I found myself craving it all week. It's a bit heavy so I can usually eat only small slivers at a time. \\n\\nNote that their little pies, while adorable, are very expensive at $7. I haven't weighed them but I'm pretty sure a slice is a better deal (can't remember how much - maybe $4?).  Larger pies are too expensive for me to buy for anything other than special occasions although I will occasionally get a slice. \\n\\nI think I may have once tried a savory pie, but I don't remember which one. All I remember was it it was a bit rich for me and upset my stomach.\\n\\nThey once had mac & cheese in a small pie tin but I've never seen it again.\\n\\nOn the beverage front, I don't drink coffee so can't comment on that. I had the hot chocolate once and found I didn't care for it. I keep trying hot chocolate everywhere, but my favorite after many years is still True Grounds in Ball.\\n\\nThis summer I discovered their ginger lemon iced tea which is absolute heaven on a hot day. Note that the hot ginger lemon tea isn't the same. The iced tea has honey added and tastes much more lemony and gingery. I think the hot tea is from MEM and it doesn't taste much like lemon or ginger to me.  It tastes a bit woody.\\n\\nThe bakery has a homey feel in the ordering area, although this is sometimes offset by brusque staff. There is some seating in a small, dimly-lit room, but it looks cramped. I don't recall ever staying. There are also a couple of benches outside.\\n\\nParking in Somerville is easy for me because I'm a Somerville resident and there's lots of resident parking. I think there is some non-resident parking but I haven't paid much attention to it. There's also the Star Market parking lot which you probably shouldn't park in, but it's never full.\\n\\nCustomer service is a mixed bag. The staff tend to be inconsistent - some are extremely friendly, others are less so; some are really quick and others painfully slow; some can answer your questions about the ingredients in the baked goods while others can't. \\n\\nBottomline, I go for the tasty treats, not the ambience or the service.

Took Yelpers recommendation on Carne Asade Burrito - very good and as big as those from Baja Fresh. Nice, as a guacamole fan, to order chips that come with guac. 3 kinds of salsa: verde, medium, and hot. Didn't try the verde. Hot was not hot at all and quite flavorless. Didn't taste bad, but just didn't hit me. Probably desirable for non-spicy fans but c'mon it's a mexican joint. Medium was quite good although still barely spicy but excellent flavor.\\nRestaurant wasn't grimy as one review indicated, it just looked like they took a worn down Taco Bell and didn't renovate. Not displeased but definitely a fast food establishment.\\nService was not unfriendly rather more ho-hum. More than I could eat. Since I wanted chips with my meal, I was a little disappinted that I had to pay about $3.50 extra to get those.

You don't get the chocolate-covered ones in the display case.  Or the vanilla pudding looking things that just happen to be in a cannoli shell.  Those are for tourists (and non-Italians) who don't know what a cannoli is supposed to look or taste like.  Instead, you go in and ask for a cannoli with nuts.  Then you get freshly-filled cannoli from the back room made with REAL ricotta cheese and green nuts on the ends.  If they don't go into the back room, you aren't getting the right thing (and no, I don't know anyone from Mike's--I just happen to know how to order them).  I grew up in Chicago and when my father came to visit, he smiled and said, \\"Yes, this is what cannoli are supposed to taste like.\\"  Mike's brought him back to his childhood in the old Italian Chicago neighborhood.  If only they were made with goat's milk ricotta (the way they REALLY should be) and it would be pure heaven, according to my dad.   We had a cannoli wedding cake from a Chicago Italian bakery.  I know cannoli.  Mike's makes good cannoli, ESPECIALLY compared to the weak junk that Modern calls a cannoli.  Mike's also makes Italian good cookies and marzipan.  Lobster rolls--eh--would rather eat a cannoli.

We only tried the caramel cannoli, which tasted great and was perfect to share. I'm not sure how many more cannolis I can eat though... They are after all very sweet.

I selected the sauteed grouper for $28, which came with rutabaga puree, tomato butter, and a tomato and cucumber relish.  The fish was cooked very well and tasted delicious.  I was not a fan of the puree at all.

My. God. Why don't I request EVERY Saturday or Sunday off from work to eat HCT? I've been missing out. \\n\\nI'll start with the food. I ordered a bone-in breast, cold. I have an insanely low tolerance for spicy food so I knew anything hotter than that might actually kill me. The chicken was perfection. The bone-in breast was moist, and the skin was crispy and well-seasoned. There was a very small amount of heat, but it was perfect for me. The mac and cheese was creamy, cheesy and delicious. Even though I enjoyed the slaw, I might get double mac when I go back because it was THAT good. \\n\\nOne thing that I think Yelp reviewers have overlooked when reviewing HCT is the ranch dressing. This ranch dressing is amazing. My boyfriend kept giving me weird looks when I was dipping everything in the ranch - pickles, bread, mac and cheese (okay, maybe that was a little strange.) The chicken has tons of flavor and doesn't *need* it, but damn, it is great.\\n\\nI love dessert, so I was excited to try the banana pudding. Do yourself a favor and get two cups. Eat one right after your meal and take one home to eat later when you start craving it again (because you will.) The pudding is thick and full of real banana flavor. The cookie crumbles are sweet and have a crunchy texture next to the whipped cream and pudding. It was such a perfect way to end a fantastic meal. \\n\\nWe are so lucky to have HCT in Columbus.

It wasn't oversalted which is typical of a lot of restaurants and one of my big barometers for food quality.  The guacamole that came with my meal, however,  was a bit too salty.

If I could give 3.5 stars I would since it's not quite a 4 but more than. 3 for sure. We just recently moved here from the Bay Area of California.

I am probably biased because I'm a California girl through and through but this is the truth, for real. Anywho. I wanted to get some pho and saw the pretty good yelp reviews and decided to see if it lived up to the reviews. First off, the place obviously caters to American people not Vietnamese/ Asian people in the sense that the servers are American and the menu is predominantly in English. This differs from what I'm used to and actually had to ask what certain things were since I'm not used to ordering in English (most places the people primarily speak Vietnamese). The place itself it nice and clean which is nice. The iced Vietnamese coffee was really good, strong and sweet but not too sweet. I got the pho with meatballs and rare beef. They have a lot of meatballs (unlike the bay which is a plus!) the broth was pretty good and I finished my whole bowl...and the bowls are pretty huge (they don't have a large or small, just one size). The servers were really nice and accommodated all of our requests pretty quickly. All in all the place was pretty good and I'd go back.

The Bearded Pig is a cafeteria style bbq joint located near the Market Basket in Somerville, i.e. you order and pay at the counter.  I actually prefer cafeteria style because I get to eyeball all the food before ordering, so this is a plus for me.  I do wish I got to see the cold sides too before ordering, but they were covered by a metal hood.\\n\\nWalking in, I noticed immediately that there was no AC, or if there was, it wasn't working very well.  This could be problematic for diners on a hot day.  It was warmer than preferred in there when I walked in, but bearable with the ceiling fans running.\\n\\nSo off to the counter I go, excited for some bbq and some foodgasming to occur, but the food was a resounding.... MEH.  I ordered the half rack of ribs with potato salad and creamy slaw and my cohort ordered the two meat combo with brisket and pulled pork and the mac and cheese and cole slaw for the sides.  The combo also came with a chunk of honey jalapeno corn bread.\\n\\nI'll start with the sides first.  The Mac and Cheese was pretty good.  Much better than at some of the other BBQ places I've tried, for example Sweet Cheeks.  I liked their potato salad too.  It was more of a german style than a traditional style, but that was a plus for me because it wasn't very heavy.  The creamy slaw was bland, it didn't taste like they used salt or seasoned it at all.  To spruce it up, I had to add some of their bbq sauce to it, which made the slaw taste much better.  The corn bread also tasted weird, sweet with a hint of jalapeno (and I mean a hint because I found one speck of jalapeno in the entire chunk we got).  If they're going to go the jalapeno route, they should have definitely made the corn bread more savory than sweet, for example a corn, cheddar, and jalapeno corn bread, if they made that, I bet it would be delicious, but what they offered was again, just meh.\\n\\nThe meat:  The pulled pork here is good, so I would recommend getting that if you plan on trying this place, but the brisket and the ribs were extremely dry and chewy.  I tasted no smoke or flavor whatsoever in the brisket or ribs, and I'm not sure if they were dry and chewy because they didn't cook the meat low and slow, because they overcooked it, or because it was sitting under the heat lamp for too long.  They weren't inedible or unpleasant to eat, but they weren't good either.  I think I've made better ribs at home myself.  I also couldn't really differentiate between the bbq sauces they offered, they all pretty much tasted the same, with the sweet being slightly sweeter than the others.  I tasted no spice or heat whatsoever in their \\"spicy\\" bbq sauce.\\n\\nOverall, it may be worth a try if you're in the area and craving meat, but unless they do some tinkering with the food recipes here, I'd probably opt for another joint for BBQ if what you're looking for is melt-in-your-mouth flavorful meaty goodness."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is STILL one my favorite place for breakfast.

The risotto is made to order, another feat rarely tried in commercial kitchens, and the house-cured meats would make Mario Batali jump out of his Croc's.

One lady said she had been there twice this week, and I had to try the chicken + fish and waffles, so that's what I ordered.  Two huge chicken wings, two fried fish fillets and two of the most tender waffles I've EVER eaten. The fish and chicken were hot, crispy, and perfectly seasoned.

I used to come to this pub with my brother and sister in law. I can say beyond a reasonable doubt that we had experienced racism here. I'm not a person that looks for racism but when it is obvious I will call it what it is. One day a few of us First Nations UBC students sat down and the waitress came over to us and said \\"last week, one of you dine and dashed, if it happens again, I'll call the cops and you'll be banned from here.\\" We were all like \\"we haven't been here in months\\" she said \\"I know faces when I see them and I'm warning you.\\"  None of us had gone to the Hudson's in months. I guess all is coloured folk look alike.\\n\\nLater on that year after exams, my bro, sister in law and I were decompressing after a long exam period. We each had 3 drinks in about an hours time and we were having fun. We were giggling and having fun. The waitress came over to us and said \\"you're cut off. Please pay your bill and leave\\". We looked at her and asked why, and explained we only had the 3 drinks. She looked at us said \\"we don't have to justify why we stop serving people.\\" She continued to serve a table full of inebriated Caucasian's, one of the Caucasian girls was passed out at the next table. When that was brought up she said pay up and go\\" all the while we were nearly sober. We paid up and left, and equated it an uneven racial climate. We were respectful and left. \\n\\nLater on a while later I brought some other indigenous friends from UBC to the Hudson. We sat there for 20 minutes and the waitress served food, didn't ask us if we needed menus, didn't bring us water and when a table of Caucasians sat down some 20 minutes after got there, menus were dropped off promptly.  When we asked the waitress, she said \\"look it's busy, I'll get to you when I get a minute\\" and when she was confronted with serving the other table she rolled her eyes. I asked to speak to a manager and explained what had happened the manager laughed at us and said it was all in our imagination. \\n\\nAfter these three incidents  I realized that there is a great deal of  racism at Hudson's landing pub. It is undeniable and I will never set foot in this racist place ever again. It's a shameful place and is probably a good place if you're not a person of colour.

There were some strong dishes -- the gai lan and kung pao cauliflower were flavorful, even if the portions were small. The mapo dofu was nothing like its namesake dish, too dry, too little sauce, but the tofu was at least nicely crisped.  The chicken feet were more of a gimmick than a real dish and were difficult to eat. The real dud was the congee. It had an artificial taste like it had been made with a packet of Liptons soup mix, was way too salty and the chicken and mushrooms were flavorless. The pickles too -- cabbage with a sweet quick pickle -- were weak compared to all the good pickling going on in town. On the bright side, the service was friendly and mostly attentive (water was left unfilled for a while and a plate was taken away after appetizers and not replaced when the main courses came). The restaurant have a number of unique tea offerings and make a ceremony of it, which is cool, but the tiny cups they served the tea in were pretty ridiculous. The place is hip with a long wait on a Friday night, and it's noisy, but at least the tables have enough room between them to allow for conversation. The prices for the individual dishes seem reasonable at first, but the small portion size means the meal adds up to be fairly expensive. We live nearby and love Chinese food, so we'll probably try it again, but there were a lot of missteps. Overall, it seemed like drunk food to me, the kind of food that tastes best after a night out when you're craving salty junk.

The waitress taking care of us let everyone start their own tabs, and I was REALLY thankful we didn't have to deal with splitting up the bill at the end of the night.

All my email/phone exchanges with staff to set-up the event were promptly handled, and I would reserve a space here again.

That deal for I think...less than $8, was pretty sweet. On average I've noticed pho around here seems to be around $7.25-$7.75 for a small/regular bowl, in the places I've been to. So if you add a banh mi sandwich, which usually ranges from $3-$5 for a 6 incher, that's really a great deal, it's practically like complimentary banh mi. \\n\\nThe banh mi tasted pretty good, and I'd say they proportioned the ingredients quite well to make it work. I personally prefer cucumber julienned, instead of in spear-form, that's just me. \\n\\nYou should order spring rolls for 75 cents too, it's nice and crunchy, although personally I wasn't a fan of the meat or veggie options. Just personal taste though, the meat flavor was too strong for me. \\n\\nI REALLY liked their tofu curry with rice noodles, their tofu is cut up pieces of tofu puffs and soaks up the yellow curry very well, and the flavoring was delish. \\n\\nThe shaking beef was tasty too, although I did carry out--and I imagine it tastes that much better straight from the kitchen. \\n\\nThe least impressive to me was surprisingly...the pho tai. While all the posted pictures of pho looked great, I wonder if I may've just come on the wrong day at the wrong time, because my broth was cloudy with meat \\"dust\\" and not hot enough. It may've been the bottom of the pot since I was coming in about an hour before closing. The meat was slightly thicker than most pho places I've been to, but tasted a bit off even though I buried it underneath pronto.

I consider this often when I visit Punjabi Dhaba.  It is an Indian restaurant!  And there are Indians here!  On both sides of the counter! Logic tells me, this place MUST be authentic!!\\n\\nAnd then I consider the summer night I was lost in Beijing, two weeks into a tour in which every meal consisted of rice and baby bok choy.  I pleeded with the university students who could speak English to direct me to the nearest Pizza Hut.  I alighted upon Pizza Hut:  Beijing, ravenous for a personal pan pizza.  \\n\\nHad the good patrons of Pizza Hut:  Beijing been deluded into thinking that I was eating there because it was authentic American food, they would have been egregiously wrong.  If they had emulated me, taking fork and knife to the pizza, thinking it Truly American to do so, they would have been misled.  I was there, an American in Beijing, eating in Pizza Hut, because I hadn't seen cheese in two weeks.  Ergo, I had not tasted cheese in two weeks.  I missed cheese like something fierce.  Perhaps not the cheese of cows who graze on Chinese rice paddies.  But the stringy cheese on that pizza was good enough for me that hot night in Beijing.\\n\\nFor this reason, I shall no longer be deluded into thinking that natives of Bombay who are eating it at Punjabi Dhaba are indeed unpaid sponsors of this Indian \\"Roadside Highway\\" establishment.  They may, very well, just be dining there because it is \\"good enough.\\"  Albeit not the Punjabi cooking like Mom used to make back home.  \\n\\nAnd PD is good enough.  The meals are cheap - you get a lot on that silver meal tray for sometimes under $6.  Their mango lassis are creamy, just the way I like them.  But sometimes I wonder if I should have just stayed home and nuked some Trader Joe's Indian entrees.  Seriously.  For at least, at home, my kitchen would have been clean.  PD makes no bones about its \\"roadside\\" ambience.  For the love of all things naan, can you spring for a new booth in your upstairs dining room?  Because the duct-taped seating is really not so kitschey.  I always think, for a couple dollars more, I could be eating at an Indian buffet with three bow-tied waiters filling my glass of water every 15 minutes.  And I'm not usually a snob like that.  Maybe I'm just not roadside enough.  Or maybe I just don't know what authenticity entails.  However, if I were far from home and just wanted the taste of saag paneer's cheese chunks in my mouth, I imagine that PD would be my oasis on a hot summer night."},{"name":"Grand View Szechuan Restaurant","address":"4181 Fraser Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Ordered delivery from here for the first time.

Perfect amount for me, but there was chicken on it (which was not on the menu description of this pie) and one piece had a bone in it.  It just wasn't very good.  However, my son loved his spaghetti and meatballs and my salad was not bad, however was missing some ingredients that had been listed in the description online.  So it was just a \\"meh\\" experience for me.

During my visit the staff accomplished something impressive: they efficiently and jovially served our party of nearly 60 out-of-towners in their upstairs area, while working a Friday-night, full house downstairs. So while my experience with the service and menu is atypical-- passed hors d'oeuvres, buffet-style set menu-- so was the work that Lambert's did in pulling off that feat. \\n\\nI started with a Bloody Mary that was right on, well-spiced with horseradish and pepper, with a standard garnish of gherkin, lemon, and lime. It wasn't good enough to have two, so I moved on to Lambert's selection of local beers on tap, including a pilsner by Austin Beerworks. It was a good match for the warm weather, and I like a lighter, crisper beer with the rich, salty foods to come. What I liked was that Lambert's amply staffed the bar and had servers roaming with drinks and food. I never went without a drink, never had my hands full, and never had to queue at the bar. \\n\\nAppetizer highlights included deviled eggs topped with salmon roe and bacon stuffed with quail breast and jalape√±o. Next we had an iceberg wedge, potato salad, fried okra, and of course, some barbecue, which included chicken, pork ribs, and brisket.  I found the brisket to be the stand-out, with beautiful pink smoke rings, and a dark salty tub on the outside. It was melt-in-your-mouth goodness. For desert we had mini coconut cream pies, and a slamming berry cobbler. \\n\\nLambert's did good work, and we all left happy and well fed."},{"name":"Kick Butt Coffee","address":"5775 Airport Blvd, Ste 725","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Long time customer of Kick Butt here.

We walked in and immediately saw a \\"Please wait to be seated\\" sign, so we waited.  Finally a man from behind the counter asked if we wanted a table, we said, \\"yes\\" and pointed out the sign,  Server's response from behind the counter, \\"yeah our sign is weird.  You can sit anywhere you want.\\"  Huh?  What's weird about a normal restaurant sign and why is it up if you want people to seat themselves? \\nHe then pointed to the counter and said if we wanted just slices we would have to order from the glass display case.  He pointed to the chalkboard to show us what's on tap but quickly said that our server will be happy to go over that with us.  So we went to the table and waited.  And waited.  and waited and no server approached us.  I went up to order our slices and was given a number to put on our table.  Same waiter that was serving the tables next to us, yet completely ignoring us, finally brought our slices and was walking away when I asked if I could order a beer.  \\nMy slice had olives and on my first bite, I bit directly onto a hard olive pit.  Ouch...could've cracked a tooth.  I showed my husband and put it aside.  I checked the rest of the slice and didn't see anymore.  On my other slice, I found a hair.  Definitely not my hair.  My husband brought the pit and the hair up to the front to show the server.  He had the nerve to come to the table and say, \\"you have to expect some olive pits on the pizza.  That's just how it is.  I've worked in a lot of restaurants and there's always an olive pit here and there.\\"  Wow!  just wow!  First of all, no, there aren't random olive pits on pizza or in other food that has sliced olives.  For many reasons!  Like, the aforementioned cracking a tooth, or choking to name a couple. \\n Secondly, I have been a waitress in NYC and LA and I NEVER, told a customer with a complaint to basically \\"suck it up.\\"  I would've been fired.  He kept asking if I wanted a different slice but I had lost my appetite.\\nThe only reason I didn't give this place a one-star is because in the end, they did finally refund my money for my two slices.  \\nThey were not rude, but honestly seem a bit clueless about customer service, in a competitive food/customer service industry."},{"name":"Yaletown Brewing Company","address":"1111 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"This is a fun and loud energetic restaurant.

My favorite breakfast item are the ricotta pancakes with a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice , you will not be disappointed.

Fine, you want to serve organ meat in your beef stew?  Great, please do, but don't list brisket on your menu, especially if there is not a sliver of it in there.  Better yet, how about going through the trouble of at least nuking the dang stew if you didn't have any fresh made.  Or even better yet, how about letting me know that you don't have fresh made stew and what I will be getting is something from the fridge and from the bottom of the pot or something?

I told her because they served food and advertised their establishment as a restaurant that I should be able to stay. I asked for a manager, hoping for a more competent employee. He explained to me that they had had an incident in which underage customers were served alcohol and the restaurant had to fire their bartender. Sounds like the restaurant's problem to me if they were dumb enough to serve underage kids. The manager told me I was allowed to sit inside. What is the difference? Food and drinks are served both inside and out on the patio. He did not offer to move our party's table indoors and explained that the rule of 21+ after 9pm was a mix of restaurant/TABC policy. Apparently (as stated by the manager), TABC has such little confidence in Kona Grill that they continue to check in on the restaurant and \\"test\\" them by creating underage drinking scenarios to make sure the restaurant is complying with policy.

Though it's seemingly chaotic, they deal with the demand very efficiently, so much so, that it's hard to tell whether servers are being rude or just efficient.  My suggestion is to step aside (or outside) and make your selection before diving into the line.  You'll be out of there in no time.  \\n\\nAs far as the quality, I'm a mild fan.  Not quite the cult-like level of SF's Tartine Bakery, but Mike's popularity is well deserved.  The selection seems endless, and the canoli taste lively and fresh.  Personally, I'm not a big fan of cannoli, so it's even more impressive that I like Mike's. \\n\\nOn the down side, some cannoli may be a little too sweet, particularly the chocolate or coffee flavored variety, plus cannoli ranging from $2.50 to $4.00 may be too steep.  \\n\\nStill, I like Mike's and the plain ricotta, chocolate and pistachio cream filled cannoli were big hits."},{"name":"Little Donkey","address":"505 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Trendy.

I often refer to it affectionately as \\"frou frou\\" Italian; you aren't going to find traditional preparations for the Italian dishes here (i.e. - lasagne made with spinach pasta, caramelized eggplant in your spaghetti). My most memorable meal here was a work-related dinner because everything was expensed and the wine was flowing.  I have to admit that when I find something I really like I stick to it, and such is the Pansoti de Zucca at Vespaio. You can \\"feel the love\\" that goes into the carefully folded delicate handmade pasta shells that house the creamy butternut squash filling inside, topped with freshly grated parmigiano.  Go ahead and swirl it around in the delicious sage butter brown sauce (think brown sugar). It is very sweet and for some it's dessert enough. You also can't go wrong with the calamari appetizer or the Misticanza salad.  The dessert I had that night was extraordinary; it was described a blood orange soup (some sort of cream sauce, sorbet and fruit).  Although quite full I still scooped up every last bit and didn't offer a taste to anyone....it was that good.  Unfortunately some of their desserts are seasonal and I haven't seen it on the menu again (the Blood Orange sorbet alone is sometimes offered, but it isn't the same dessert I've described).\\n\\nThe red wines offered are mostly Italian and French.  If you aren't familiar with the varietals ask your server for a recommendation; they are usually pretty knowledgeable about their wines. If you want one of the best Napa Valley offerings and have lots of discretionary income, then go long and order the Silver Oak.\\n \\nThe atmosphere depends on where you are seated.  If you have a larger group try for the intimate back room area, which is flanked by built in wine ranks to tempt you.  My least favorite place to be seated is in the tables in the center of the main dining area, which don't offer any privacy and are pretty much in the middle of things, literally.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Vespaio doesn't take reservations unless it's before 6:30 pm.  On a weekend this could mean over an hour wait, so I recommend either going early or don't starve yourself beforehand and plan for the wait. Or see if you can get into Enoteca next door (which shares the same kitchen and has perhaps the best gnocchi dish in town)."},{"name":"Southside Flying Pizza","address":"2702 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm not sure which location I arrived at today, but had a bad experience.

I've been going to Lee's semi-regularly for about 4 years now, and I haven't strayed away from the pho + banh mi combo. I have tried a LOT of different pho from a lot of different places in Atlanta (including multiple places on Buford Highway) and Lee's has my favorite. The beef pho is so flavorful and they put a ton of meet in there! I love a flavorful pho broth and this place definitely does it right. Now their banh mi -- probably my favorite sandwich of all time. Like their pho, the banh mi is packed with meat and served inside a soft baguette. It's literally perfect and tastes phenomenal. I slap a little hoisin sauce on there and let the mouth party begin. They also have an awesome thai tea, but my favorite after-dinner treat to get there is the avocado smoothie with boba. It's got a super subtle taste and isn't sweet - that might not sound appetizing, but it's a must try!! Also, while I've never tried ordering, I believe they have a buy 5 get 1 free banh mi deal or something like that, so if you go with a group (or just want to stock up for the week ;) ), then go for it! If you haven't been to Lee's yet, this place should be your next bucket list spot."},{"name":"Banana Leaf","address":"820 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"If i were to review this restaurant solely on taste, then it is very deserving of the full 5 stars!  \\nhave been a fan of this busy malaysian chain for many years, most recently was at this location for my roomies bday dinner.  \\nas usual, the lobby was packed with people waiting to be seated.  the servers were running to and fro getting out orders and serving hot delicious plates to their tables.  \\nwe had made reservations and ended up waiting for about 15-20 mins, which is quite reasonable considering the high traffic at that time.\\ni had come from a late lunch prior so i regretfully had no room for a meal.  \\ni did however ordered myself the double lychee mango mojito which was strong and tasty!  and i can never go here without having their signature deep fried banana dessert... oh, how everything just tastes better when its deep fried!! \\neveryone had an order of the roti to start...which i had to sample of course.  one of the dishes i always have to order as well when i come here.  the bread is soft and chewy and dipped in their mildly spicey peanut sauce just completes it.  in fact, the roti is delicious on its own.\\nmy room mate had the pineapple fried rice, which is served right out of the pineapple shell!  a delight to the eyes and even more pleasant to the tummy! another dish i have had many times before and always praised.  the pineapples make the normally salty dish have little bites of sweet surprises...much fun! and if you dont like the hot spice of malaysian dishes, this one wont leave your tongue burning.\\nmy other room mate ordered the mango chili prawns.... i have never sampled this before so i had to steal a few off his plate.  i love eating fruit in my mains!! although the dish itself wasnt piping spicey hot, the mango had the perfect balance with calming the chili prawns.  i just love those jumbo prawns...slurp slurp!\\n\\nif i had to rate solely on service, i would probably give 3-4 stars.  not rude, but not exactly stellar.  it's too bad, because the very first time i ever tried banana leaf, the server for our table was so friendly and happy, i fell in love with his jolly nature."},{"name":"Laguna Mexican Street Food & Ice Cream","address":"1980 Hard Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"If I had only ordered the churros this review would have seriously been 5 stars.

So I've been making a point to try all the Ramen Columbus has to offer. My latest adventure has been to here, Menya Ramen. \\n\\nI can say that the Ramen here is Decent. But it could be a lot better. Especially when I compare it to places such as Meshikou or Fukuryu Ramen. The Flavor and broth is just ok. But nothing exciting. It's better than places that serve Ramen, but it's not the star of their menu. But it's no where near as good as the places I mentioned earlier that have Ramen as the main star on their menu. I did not like the noodles that much either. The texture was kind of weird. The only thing I could think of to compare it to would be Campbell's canned chicken noodle soup. When biting down on the noodles all I could think of was how similar the noodles felt. Another thing, my eggs in my Ramen were way overdone. The yolks were basically solid and not runny like they are supposed to be. Also there was virtually no meat in my Ramen. There was a super small piece of meat. All of the ramen places I've been, they have at least two pieces of meat in there for you. Here they only had 1 piece, and it was miniscule. This was very disappointing. I also got dumplings. They were very basic and nothing special, so I won't spend any time here on those. \\n\\nWhen I walked in, the place was unimpressive and bland. Everything looked plain, and the first thing I said to my brother was \\"This place doesn't look that good\\", and he agreed. The menu was plain and as well. It didn't help me get excited to eat there at all. The pictures weren't really that appetizing.\\n\\nThe cashier looked like she didn't want to be there. She just took the order and took your money with a blank expression on her face. Not saying I was upset about it, it just didn't do anything to make me want to come back lol. \\n\\nOverall I probably won't recommend this place. If someone wants ramen, I'm going to recommend somewhere else like the 2 places I mentioned earlier in this review. There was so many things that I didn't really dig, and they can or could do better."},{"name":"Lima Criolla","address":"6406 N Interstate 35 Frontage Rd, Ste 1550","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Love the ceviche!

From Korean Garden to Lee's Tofu House... Hello Chicken is a welcome change. Hello Chicken is a closer option for Korean Fried Chicken than Bonchon in Fayetteville or Thank U Chicken in Duluth.\\n\\nBasically every time I've eaten here, I've ordered the 3-4 person combo (definitely enough for 4 people who eat an average amount. Maybe only 3 if you are a caveman). It's $50 for a TON of food! You get an order of odeng (fish cakes in soup), toppoki, bibimbap/noodles, bulgogi quesadilla and fries, and of course, fried chicken. You get to choose from various options, even the most expensive options from each section, which adds up to be less than ordering each item individually. \\n\\nOdeng is a must - it's warm and perfect - or maybe because I just like soupy things. \\nToppoki was just ok - I think maybe by the time I tried to eat this, I was always stuffed. The cheese toppoki tastes more like the typical toppoki than the bulgogi option - although the bulgogi toppoki is the only mild option. \\nBibimbap is made custom - build your own. Not bad and it's quite a hearty portion. \\nBulgogi Quesadilla is a welcome surprise. I didn't think this was be as good as it was. And the FRIES OMG. They bring me back to Checker's fries. And we all know that Checker's fries are bomb. \\nFried chicken is overall pretty tasty. Not the best I've had but I wasn't complaining.

Our server here had no idea what that meant as evidenced by her exclamation, \\"So you're allergic to bread?!\\" So she had to consult with the chef on everything we ordered, which is fine and much appreciated.\\n\\nWe went here already planning to share an app and entree. At OotB, that is perfectly ok since their servings are huge. We split the Ceasar Salad. The dressing was watery and lacked flavor (which may have come from the anchovies which we opted not to include). I view salad as a vehicle for dressing, so lackluster dressing always disappoints me. However, the roasted red peppers were redeeming. \\n\\nFor an entree, we wanted to order the Baked Sole Special but it was breaded. So we went against our gut instinct and got chicken at a seafood place. The chicken was stuffed with goat cheese and sauteed spinach. It was a bit dry, but the creamy tomato sauce hid that a bit and mixed wonderfully with the goat cheese and spinach. (The sauce was thickened with flour, so I asked for the sauce on the side, which again was accommodated and greatly appreciated.) On the side was a healthy dose of potatoes and sweet potatoes (artfully prepared) and garlicky broccoli which we ate in a flash.\\n\\nWould I go again? My answer is a hesitant \\"no.\\" The food was good, but I've had better at a lower price and in a better environment. There just wasn't anything exciting in the restaurant or on my plate.

Since we opted to utilize most of our money on Disney parks and food there, we looked for discounts on any other places we decided to eat. We located a Groupon and decided to venture on 9/13 at 6p. The food was the typical franchise Mexican quality/taste and the drinks were overpriced and under expectations. \\n\\nFirst off, I'd hate to make this generalization, but it seems that you get treated differently for having a \\"coupon/discount\\"! It's the first question the girl asked we walked in, followed by where we were from. It was also the first question our waitress asked when she came to our table. Now, I'll say this, I know what Senor Frogs is suppose to be an upbeat, lively party type vibe...but this negative review is based solely on our service! I am going to omit our waitresses name, because I don't wish to embarrass her! \\n\\nFirst, she begins to banter about our groupon to make sure we know how it works. She didn't have ANY enthusiasm as I would have expected from my previous visit years back or my fianc√©s visit in Vegas...she explains that the Groupons $40 value can not be used for tip or alcohol. I read the alcohol part...*strike 1* \\n\\nShe asks if we want to order drinks, I mentioned that I would when I could see a menu. (We had just sat down and only had one drink menu...) after a couple minutes, she returned with another drink menu. She began to explain the differences between the 22oz and getting refills at $2 cheaper. As she walked away, I noticed the empty condiment holder (No salt, no pepper, no ketchup...just Chulola hot sauce...other tables had atleast salt and pepper) that said they had a 2-4-1 Happy Hour deal. I was wondering if she was going to mention it on her return. *Strike 2* Seconds later, she returned (No...she NEVER mentioned the 2-4-1 Happy Hour Special), we placed our drink orders and she asked if we were ready to order... mind you, I actually started to time this because she seemed kinda rushy... we had been sitting down for 3 minutes by this time. I mentioned if we could have a moment to look at the menus. She came back what was a minute later, said the bar was making our drinks and if we were ready to order. It has now been 4 minutes since we sat down...I asked my Fianc√© if she wanted any appetizers since I wanted to take my time to look over the menu. She requested queso dip and chips. Away she goes... she comes back 2 minutes later and asked AGAIN if we wanted to order...we hadn't even gotten our appetizers yet! *Strike 3* I again told her I was still looking...\\n\\nThis time instead of her walking around, she stands at the station which was 5 feet from our table and stares at us. The Appetizer came about 2 minutes into the awkward feeling like I was some field mouse being hunted by a falcon...and away she swooped! \\"So are you guys ready to order, or do you need another minute?\\" \\n\\n*Waitress tip* look...I know some people can be ass hats and tip ACCORDING to the amount they have to pay after a discount, and quick table flips right before the dinner \\"rush\\" is how you make your money, but don't be pushy and make people feel they need to \\"hurry up and buy!\\" \\n\\nSo after she again asked, I finally got a little forceful and told her \\"I'll wait until we're finished with our Appetizer!\\"  (which was just dropped off, and I knew if input in a dinner order, it would be out 3 minutes after we order it!) \\n\\nShe gives us some space this time...comes back 3 minutes later (I told you I was timing this now just to see...) and asks if we need anything. Mind you, NONE of this was done with any excitement...but more so like we were bothering her with being there. At this time we just ordered the Mexican platter for 2. She puts in our order and begins to (while standing next to our table in the cleaning station) begins talking to another male waiter about her plans for Saturday night...ughhhh Kids!!!! \\n\\nThe food came out 4 minutes later...we sat down around 602p...it was now 617p. So I can say that the food is rather quick...but wasn't anything special! Reminded me of a distant, lesser liked cousin of Chillis!

Walk in and it is older and dated.  Place has a lot of potential if they were clean it up and freshen it up a bit.  The large fountain/pond when you first walk in the door looks like it would be beautiful if it was up and running properly and full of water.  There was some water and some fish.  The place looked empty.  We stood at the door for a few minutes before the waitress seen us standing there.  The hostess was seated around the corner eating and did not see or hear us.  Um, there is a door alarm that sounds when you walk in the door.  So we are seated at dated tables and booths.  The side of the restaurant with the buffet part was very dark like they did not want to turn the lights on.  There were 2 cold islands, first one with salad stuff, peel and eat shrimp, an ice bin for mussels but nothing in it but ice, and sushi.  Second cold island was all bought desserts like cake, cookies....stuff bought from GFS.  Then there are several hot islands.  Not much seafood for being a seafood buffet for $10.99 a person.  There was some shrimp in dishes and mostly imitation crab, deep fried and breaded tilapia heads, whole shrimp, blue crab (just the legs, no bodies) and limp frog legs.  They had several soups.  Daughter and I both tried the Seafood soup with tofu, water chestnuts, imitation crab, and peas.  We added green onions to it.  Not that great.  Their fried rice was very bland.  Crab Rangoon was pretty good.  The waitress kept plates removed but never refilled drinks and was standing near our booth speaking loudly with the hostess almost the whole time we were there.

But I gave the benefit of the doubt in this case. I'm honestly surprised this place has a 3 star rating. DO NOT GO HERE. The high price of the food (46.95 for buffet) does not accurately reflect the quality of the food. Everything was terrible. The crab legs were terribly salty; so as to encourage customers to eat less I assume. I thought I would be able to find refuge in the mashed potatoes. Wrong, those were the most watery mashed potatoes I have ever eaten in my life. So then I thought let's hope that the dessert will make it all better. Wrong, that was the most sugary and unpleasant dessert I have eaten in a long time. Not to mention that the dessert area is located right next to the bathroom. The last thing I want to see when about to eat is the inside of a bathroom or people walking out of the stalls after emptying out.

The Bearded Pig does not disappoint.  I'm a very happy resident of Somerville right now.  \\n\\nManagement clearly gets what barbecue is all about--they're not pandering, or trying to get away with subpar product, even though many other restaurants do that due to the less-than-robust barbecue scene in New England.  Amazingly, this place does great pulled pork--they use a good rub, the pork gets good smoke penetration, and they've got a very tasty mustard/vinegar sauce to go along with it.  The creamy cole slaw was another highlight, as was the mac and cheese.  I also tried the brisket, which was trimmed of enough fat to make it so you're not chowing down on a half inch of gristle, but had enough left so that it didn't dry out too much in the smoker.\\n\\nHappily, The Bearded Pig also makes its own banana pudding--the most fitting homemade dessert for a barbecue joint, and it also happens to be a personal favorite.  Bananas, custard, NIlla wafers and whipped cream.  Heck yes.

I stopped by here during the weekday for lunch. I had their Poutine Breakfast, as well as their Lemon Tart, Chocolate Tart and Croissant. The Poutine Breakfast (which came with a side salad and some bread and butter) was absolutely fantastic and also quite filling - I'm a big eater and I was actually quite full from the dish alone. Their desserts were also quite tasty. All in all, this is a great restaurant and definitely one that I'd recommend checking out. Do be prepared for waits though, depending on when you visit: the restaurant wasn't busy when I initially arrived at 1:00, but it did quickly fill up and there was actually a small line when I left the place about an hour later.\\n\\nPoutine Breakfast ($14.95):\\n4.5/5\\nThis consisted of fries covered in gravy, onions, scallions, swiss cheese and ham, and topped with a poached egg. The dish was just fantastic. The fries were crispy (until they got soaked in the gravy of course) and well-seasoned, the gravy was flavourful and had pepper in it, which added a nice bit of fragrance and heat. The egg was perfectly cooked, and had a nice runny yolk (which I personally didn't really care for, but sure makes a nice picture). Now I know that this poutine isn't \\"authentic\\" in the sense that they used swiss cheese instead of cheese curds, but I seriously couldn't care less: I love gooey melted cheese. The dish was served with a small side of salad as well as some bread and butter. The bread was just wonderful: crispy on the outside while soft and fluffy on the inside. You can eat it with the butter, but I actually used it to mop up all the leftover gravy from my poutine. The portion was also very good and quite filling; I'm a big eater and I was actually full upon finishing (which doesn't happen very often).\\n\\nLemon Tart ($5):\\n4/5\\nThe curd was creamy and bursting with a great tangy flavour from the lemon. The crust was tender and cut quite easily. It was a little soft and soggy due to the curd, but that didn't really bother me too much.\\n\\nChocolate Tart ($5):\\n4/5\\nThe filling was creamy, dense, rich, with a fantastic bittersweet chocolate flavour. The crust was again tender and cut easily. It was a bit on the blond side, but that didn't really bother me too much. I personally would rather have a slightly underdone crust than a burnt/bitter one.\\n\\nCroissants ($2.25):\\nN/A\\nI didn't actually eat these, I gave them to my mom. She appeared to like them."},{"name":"Asiana Grill","address":"444 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"4.5","text":"I enjoyed this place quite a bit.

If you're going out with a fairly big group of people with varied tastes, you won't be that disappointed. Although, I will say the quality of the Thai and Japanese seemed to be a lot better than the Korean food.\\n\\nI got the red curry with vegetables and I thought it was good, but I also like My Thai Cafe in Brookline, which has superior certified vegan curries. My brother ended up getting some sort of sushi salad and the fish was really fresh, which is good for a smaller place.

The restaurant was very busy, and a bit understaffed for the number of diners, our waitress walked by our table many times as we sat with empty glasses, and was not very knowledgable about how to make certain drinks, so it took a while to get once ordered. Menu is small and fairly pricy to make it a regular place, but great for a one off visit, or for tourists to the island. We started with the clams in a very tasty thai curry (as I was told, since I cannot eat shellfish) and the almond/olive dish, which you can't go wrong with... Amongst our orders were the vegetable dish of the day - a trio of veggies in phyllo - beets, spinach and mushrooms on a bed of greens. The phyllo portion of the dish was very tasty, but the greens were quite greasy, and just that, greens. Addition of pine nuts or cheese would have knocked this dish out of the park. Also the steak and pomme frites - which was very flavourful; the quality of the beef was amazing and cooked to pefection! We ordered the cheese cake with rhubarb compote, which was a great way to end the meal.\\n\\n\\nRecently returned to Leftbank for dinner, and was quite pleased. Started with the dates, stuffed with sausage, wrapped with proscuitto. What can I say, meat, meat and dates?! YUMM!!

My mom ordered the steak and hers was charred all over (well done). The desserts were below average for the cost ($11 for a very tiny chocolate dessert). We planned on ordering the creme br√ªl√©e but were told they no longer serve it. Giving 2 stars only because we ordered the mashed potatoes separately and those were very tasty but they were not worth $9. Overall, not worth over $200 (we have had better meals at the quick services in Disney World). I would suggest using your dining credits elsewhere. Went in 2014 and the menu was so much better.

Veggies schmeggies -- you can eat vegetables some other time. For dessert, I'm a baklava nut. \\n\\nI've had mixed experience when it's come to service, but overall I like the people there.

Two and a half hours total waiting time for a table (which was spent sipping cocktails at Dante across the street) and another two hours waiting for the cheesecakes to arrive to our table! \\n\\nI WISH I was kidding you.\\n\\nNow, I understand that this promotional deal probably caused quite the hullabaloo for the staff at Cheesecake and a table of fourteen threw just another wrench into the mix, but seriously...TWO HOURS for a slice of cheesecake?  Two hours when other tables that sat after us got their slices way before us? Two hours when your entire staff is standing up at the dessert counter goofing off and completely ignoring our table because we met the requirements for auto-gratuity and they were going to get their tip no matter what?!\\n\\nI assume that this corporate promotion was well planned and each chain was well-informed of this event long ago, so my question is how on earth are you not better prepared?

Mike's was packed when we went after dinner one night in the north end, but the line moves pretty quickly!

Pretty cool actually. \\n\\nWe got a few different types of cannoli's and I say stick with the original and if you love chocolate as much as I do still try and say no to the chocolate cannoli because it is just way too rich to handle with all of that ricotta cheese in the center! The other ones we had were perfect though! And they aren't too pricey either. My friend Sarah also got some of their tiramisu and an eclair and she was pretty much in heaven after biting into both of those items too!

Ten minutes later my drink was finally there but it was missing some key ingredients. I asked her about it and she told me they ran out of things.

It took more then 10 minutes after we were sat for the server to come to take our order (although, to be fair, we had our drinks and appetizer from the bar transferred), and occasionally through the night I noticed the less than prompt attention to refilling tea, replacing silverware, etc.\\n\\nBut all in all, still a restaurant well worth trying."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Delicious cannolis!!

He said the Ahi was seasoned with a special, secret blend of spices that a chef/friend of his had invented.

Must admit,  it looks pretty nondescript from the outside. But we were never the kind who judges a pizza place by its appearance :) We asked the manager if it was new, he said they've been there for 3 years. I guess the location is such that it doesn't immediately catch one's eye.  . Ordered an XL half Alfredo Curry and Half Nature's choice. I picked up a paper plate and a Sharpie from the counter for my son to draw on. Kept him occupied throughout the whole dinner!  I also picked up a Menu Flyer and as I read through it, I realized there are several meal deals that they have. I noticed that if you buy an XL specialty pizza, you can get a personal 1 topping pizza free. So when the server came out, we asked him about and he said,  \\"Sure which one do you want? We did find it a bit odd that we weren't told about it at the time of ordering. \\n\\nAnyhow.. the pizza was delicious! You can truly  feel the difference with the use of fresh and natural ingredients. The crust is light and not at all greasy! That's a first for us! The Alfredo curry was our favorite. After a tug of war, I gave up the last slice to my hubby,, sigh.... Don't let the word \\"curry\\" scare you , it isn't spicy ... it's very  , how shall I put it,  subtle & interesting. It doesn't feel very heavy or garlicy either. \\n\\nAfter a while the manager, Brandon came out , chit chatted with us and gave us a loyalty card. We're definitely going back there again!

I have a masters degree and was a bit confused over the menu. It was sort of illegibly written and I had no idea what some items were. Maybe some description on what \\"seitan\\" is would help a newbie like me? If 10-20% of everyday customers are new how do they choose? Obviously the chickpea fritter, since we've all heard if those. The greeter was a bit awkward so I wasn't sure if he knew what everything was or would taste like so I just went ahead with Mr fritter. So here I am, business casual dressed elbow deep in dripping sauce. Would the platter have been less messy? Not sure what it is but maybe. Look, I'm in a CSA, I understand that farm fresh changes daily. But there was no clue or idea or picture of the menu on the website. I look at menus at the local pizza place-clover is even more new and foreign. I sat next to the cook who did ask how it was. Was that the right time to launch into a diatribe of how the pickled onions maybe needed a bit of spice? I just answered that it was good. It was good and I thought that the flavors all held their own and complemented. The strawberry soda was a tad weak but worth the try. My recommendations - have locations post pictures daily of the menu on the website (I'm 32 and don't use twitter if that's your answer). Have someone pull new people aside and ask what they like (spicy, salad, flavor explosion). We went back and told a few co workers about the experience and they didn't seem to be in a rush to visit.

The fruit napoleon was almost too pretty to eat. I also couldn't resist having my first macaroon, which was perfect. And it is a bit expensive, especially for a college student like myself.

Also, they give you a heaping amount of raita too, which is great. Highly recommend for lunch or dinner! Most definitely one of the best Indian restaurants in Boston."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"overrated. very nice people but sllloooowww service and okay food. if more places in Portland were opened on Sunday, probably wouldn't be as popular. bar there helps too, I'm sure."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We've been wanting to come here for quite a while.

It's a Sunday at 8PM and they're out of chicken, Cesar salads, seasoned fries, ice cream, ranch dressing and rice to name a few. There's two waiters and waitresses, one cook, and a manager messing the cook up in the kitchen. The waitress, Pam, was rude and kept rolling her eyes at well, everything. The manager repeatedly remade the same order which lead to two loud confrontations at the counter. Two other tables sent their food back 2+ times and 4 things were wrong with our order for a table of 6. We had cold food, wilted veggies, and missed garlic bread, ranch, and gravy with orders. I ended up with a half wilted salad because they ran out of lettuce and an order of fries. Avoid the place at all costs.

The bar staff did not make it a priority to remove them from in front of us much less greet us, even tho there were about 4 of them.  minus a star.  One bartender finally approached us and i ordered a gin drink with strawberry puree in it and the bf ordered his standard mojito.  Our drinks came.  Mine was garnished with a wilted strawberry on the side of the glass, you know, the berry in the box that you normally wouldn't eat.  Apparently the Hyatt staff has no problem with it.  also, i didn't detect any puree.  If anything it was some boxed strawberry juice.  The bf's drink was lackluster and nothing special.  Neither tasted of alcohol and when i pay $10 for a single drink i want to feel like i at least had alcohol in my glass.\\n\\nThe saving grace of this place was the view from the room.  She had booked a balcony room facing the lake.  It was a great room.  Appointed nicely with amenities you would expect for $259 a night.  If i was just rating the view, it would get 5 stars.

They've recently expanded their dining area, so there is plenty of room to sit now.  Let's break it down:\\n\\nFood: Standards solid, seafood good, adventures are adventures... I encourage branching out.\\n\\nSetting: It reminds me of a ski lodge more than a clubhouse restaurant, and that is always a good time.  They have TV's up, but they are not obtrusive if you go back and sit by the windows.  Also, if you get there in the summer months for dinner, you can watch people try to hit the green on the 9th hole... completely worth it.\\n\\nService:  Service is that service you get between Manchester, NH and Somerville, MA... it's solid, they're nice, but you might hear a \\"too much information\\" story at any moment.  \\n\\nBeers:  They've gotta get that tap and bottle selection improved... this almost fully knocked them down to 3 stars.

We also split the wedge which was tasty as well- I think I needed more bacon though, but the Brussels sprouts we had as a side had plenty! The hanger steak was awesome! Rich and seasoned nicely paired with tomato, avocado and onion on the side. Let's talk Brussels sprouts for a minute. These were seared, crunchy, and in olive oil, chili flake, orange and lemon zest.

The sub, soup, and salad are all priced lower than the ever popular  over priced Panera across the street!!!\\n\\nFor dinner, the sea bass is divine, the chicken Marsala is cooked so perfectly that it is like butter no need for a knife, and the best dish ever- the 4oz filet with spinach, raisins, nutmeg, and potatoes for $15!!!!

Finally something for a more discriminate palate, no chain feel, and charm. And an owner on site and present at all times- just what this city needs!\\n\\n\\nAfter reading some of the reviews here, I am shocked and dismayed that anyone could find it over priced and the food not good.
