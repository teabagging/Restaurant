It came with an egg that was poached...then fried tempura style in panko breadcrumbs. I have to say, that was interesting...and easily the highlight of the meal. The steak tartare was...rough. The meat tasted low quality and it seemed like the spices and other ingredients were being used to disguise the meat's odd flavor. It was definitely much improved by the horseradish spread (because I could no longer taste anything but horseradish), so I spread that on it lavishly. I got a really bad stomachache that night that didn't go away for 24 hours and the tartare was definitely the cause. That's what I get for toughing out the flavor!

Whenever we are sitting on the dining room side and the live music starts, you can forget having any more conversations with the people you are with. This isn't Wembley Stadium - we just want some music in the background. Unless you are friends with the person playing, chances are you didn't go to Hobnob for the music. It's a nice perk to have live music, but let's dial down that volume. \\n2) Bourbon Selection - it's so cool that the bar area is focused around an amazing bourbon selection. However, the menu is confusing (bourbons need be listed Alphabetically) because there is no order today. Also, the menu needs to be updated periodically to remove bourbons you don't carry. Happens every time we go there - we order 3-4 bourbons before we find one they actually have in stock. Finally, please educate your servers AND bartenders regarding the bourbons. There is little to no knowledge of bourbons with anyone who works there. If you don't drink bourbon, you should at least be familiar with what you have at the bar. We asked our server the other day if they had a High West variety and he said, \\"we got a lot of bourbons - take a look at the menu\\" -- seriously?

We didn't and so signed up on the original wait list and THEN realized that we'd be closer to getting fed by signing for the larger space, but by then one of the waitresses was carrying around the original list from space to space, with the mister trailing behind her muttering bits of \\"um hey, can I see that... I just need to... I think we put our names on the wrong...\\"\\n\\nA little confusion at the head, but a faster seat and the same yummy breakfast and morning drinks that Jam is famous for. In a city of veg-friendly menus they still have some of the best non-meat options around, and the new space also serves lunch and dinner (the old corner spot is no longer serving lunch now, only breakfast.) While the old space was cozy and warm (during the summer actually pretty hot!) the new space is far more open and kind of loud. All hard surfaces and 20-ft ceilings and such. Not bad at all, just different.\\n\\nThey probably need to figure out something a little more obvious on the seating list front, but that's a minor quibble. Solid brunch, nice new spot, faster grub, fantastic drinks."},{"name":"Fresh Kitchen","address":"851 N Alafaya Trl, Ste Q-01","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This is like a healthy alternative for chipotle!

I signed into Yelp and realized that I never post the review on Splash. So here it is based on my experience in Sept 2011.\\n\\nI ordered dirty martinis at the bar. The bartender gave me the martinis and said \\"no olives\\" and shrugged her shoulders like she can careless. Last I checked, dirty martini comes with olives and that's the point of the drink! I asked for the olives and she said they ran out downstairs and upstairs have it. Ummm since when it became my job to go to the roof top to get the olives. If I'm paying over $10 a drink, I need better service than this. I didn't go to a somewhat high end lounge to get this type of service. We had a big group and the manager talked us into getting a table service on the roof top and he agreed to let us not stick to a bottle as long as we order a min of $275 which was fine cuz we would easily go over the min. Less than an hour of getting the table, they closed the roof top and we had to go downstairs. How about telling us you're going to close the roof top before selling us the table. Our waitress was nice though, but the other staffs were rude including the bouncers. My friends and I would never go there again. If we want that kind of atmosphere, we're better off at either the W Lounge down the street, or Bond where the service is always great."},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"DAYAM JAM!!

We each had scrambles and were both very pleased.  It was well worth the wait.  Which by the way, the wait sucked... I'd give 5 stars but for the wait, because it could have been shorter. I feel like they aren't utilizing the space to its fullest potential (ie the kids play area could have held another 4 tables and there was at least one table that was set but wasn't being used seemingly due to a lack of chairs).  Maybe they could make the play area a seating area during top hours? We did see 5+ people leave rather than stick around for the wait. Our servers were nice and attentive, coffee cups were never empty. I can't wait to go back and try the grand marnier french toast!"},{"name":"Alpha Global Sushi and Bar","address":"1099 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My friend and I found this place on a lark, while wandering the streets of Vancouver looking for a sushi joint. Without a doubt, one of the finest places I've ever had the pleasure of eating at, and I've eaten at several Japanese excellent places in my lifetime, including Hapa Izakaya in Vancouver, Sushi Sam's in SF, and in Japan itself. I'm not a huge sushi afficianado, but I know what I like. That said, Alpha completely blew me away, and has cemented, in my mind, Vancouver as one of the finest places for sushi and sashimi.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is small, dark and cozy. Good for a couple of friends, or a nice dinner out with a special someone. Or, in my case, a business partner. The waitress was very sweet, friendly and helpful; she made a couple of recommendations that turned out very well.\\n\\nAnyway, where Alpha Sushi really made its mark was with its sashimi. We tried the house specials Tuna Garlic Pepper and Dill Salmon Carpaccio. Both were very unique, something I've never had before, but that also did not overpower the extremely fresh and flavorful fish. Both were thick cut, close to 3/4 inches, served at slightly below room temperature, and just melted in my mouth. I imagine both fish were local and never frozen. I also had the more standard Seared Salmon Sashimi, very lightly seared, served in a light garlic ponzu sauce. \\n\\nAnother standout was the Natto Bomb. The waitress was actually aware enough to warn me about natto, which is a fermented bean, that I'd only heard of, but never tried. I, being the human garbage disposal I am, brushed her off, and demanded, in Homer Simpson-esque style, NATTO! Even my friend tried to warn me, but the sound of \\"tuna, salmon, salmon roe, squid, japanese pickle, green onion, quail egg served on fermented soybeans\\" was like a siren song. The bomb came out in a little bowl, beautifully presented. It was definitely interesting. I had no problems with the fish or the beans, although it did take a little getting used to. The natto was not as strong as suggested, though did have a faint salty, pungent flavor similar to fermented black beans. Mixed together with the other ingredients, it flavored nicely, salty and nose tickling, but without the soy and wasabi.\\n\\nThe other item we had was the tako wasabi, which became a highly sought after dish of mine in Vancouver. It came out very chilled, and very fresh. Standard fare done very well.\\n\\nAll in all, a very enjoyable experience was had at Alpha Sushi. Everything was extremely fresh, nothing tasted like it had ever been frozen, and the fish was seasoned just enough to give all the dishes a distinct flavor without overpowering the natural essence of the fish. I would definitely go back there whenever I am in Vancouver. Prices are slightly higher than the places on Robson, but then again, you do pay for a better quality product. Also, not being on the main strip means fewer lines and a more low key dining experience. Without a doubt, Alpha is one of those experiences that make a city a food destination."},{"name":"Cosmo's Pizza","address":"1325 Broadway St, Ste 108","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"One of the best pizzas I've had!

The homage to \\"old times\\" was nicely executed though, since I did feel as if I was living in an earlier era. I did not understand the purpose of the small cacti plants set up all over the store. They just seem like an odd plant choice, but maybe they are a trend in that particular area. The coffee menu was short and concise, which is totally fine if the quality is top-notch. Brittany was not rude but also not particularly friendly when we placed our order, this didn't really bother me since I wasn't there to make friends.

By the time my girlfriends and I joined them, having completed the race, they had demolished the food. My boyfriend highly recommended his smoked salmon bagel, so I ordered the same -- I opted for a toasted sesame bagel (you have a choice of toasted vs. non-toasted and sesame vs. regular). One friend ordered the same, but with a regular bagel and my other friend got the buttermilk pancakes as well.\\n\\nThey provided a mini-basket of baked goods -- a couple of different muffins and one biscuit. It seemed like an odd assortment to share amongst us. I was too wired to eat any of the baked goods, though my BF commented the biscuit was delicious. \\n\\nMurphy's was expectedly packed due to Summerfest, so service took quite a while. I had to ask for silverware and water. My bagel finally arrived and it was amazing. It came with a slice of cream cheese (big enough to cover the bagel, no spreading needed), two thick slices of tomato, capers, thinly sliced red onion and a generous portion of smoked salmon. I was famished after the race, so I don't know if that had any effect on the taste of my bagel, but it was possibly one of the most delicious things ever. \\n\\nTowards the end of the meal, a male server/employee came up to my boyfriend, who had pulled a chair from a two-top to join us at the table for four, and said that it was a fire hazard to sit in the aisle. Understandable, but it was an unusual situation given that the two boys had eaten first at the table and then us three girls joined later.

It's a bit overrated, and while it's not quite at the level of \\"I'd eat there only as a last resort,\\" I wouldn't make an effort to go to the North End exclusively for it.\\n\\nFirst, Dino's is a fast-food joint much like Il Panino Express on Hanover Street. It serves a lot of subs and pastas. The meal I enjoyed the most there was the veal parm with linguine or ziti (can't remember exactly). The veal was good, the pasta had the right bite, and the sauce was tasty. \\n\\nTheir chicken and broccoli alfredo, however, isn't so great. The chicken doesn't taste that good and is a bit dry. At the price they're asking, around $12, I'd expect tender chicken. The alfredo sauce isn't very flavorful either. I haven't tried their subs, but a friend who did enjoyed them. \\n\\nDino's runs on the expensive side. I've ordered a pasta with meat entree several times and, with a 20 oz. soda, it's come to $15, which is a bit too high for the average quality they offer.\\n\\nTheir seating is also problematic. There's seating for exactly 20 people, with only two two-person tables. All other tables are arranged for four-person parties. This can create difficulty if the two two-person tables are taken, and a two-person party walks in and monopolizes a four-person table, unless of course you're willing to sit right next to people you don't know. (I wouldn't be.)\\n\\nI don't see a reason for heading to the North End only to eat at Dino's. It would be much like traveling to the next county for Burger King.

Coming into the venue, you have a great ambiance set by dimly lit lights, wine bottles set within glass encasements and the slightest Italian vibe that brings together the overall theme. The dress of many of the patrons was business casual or dressier (some with jeans and nicer shirts) and there were both dates and group arrangements at the varied tables. \\n\\nUpon sitting down, our host was quite pleasant, creating small talk about the day and the evening and our glasses of water and bread were set immediately upon sitting. I did note however, that it was odd that they place the slim breadsticks right onto the table vs onto a plate. The spread that was served with the bread was a type of pesto garnished with whole pine nuts. Next to it sat a small cup of sea salt. I found the spread to be too salty itself and the breadsticks to be too bland and light alone. I ordered a dirty martini to start as well. The drink was well made, but the olives are not pitted and I found myself biting down on the pit before I realized the situation. Not fun in the least. \\n\\nThe server was very attentive to our needs throughout the whole meal. We started out with the hungarian mangalica prosciutto w/ anise broiled white peach and sweet ricotta fritters. I actually found the prosciutto to be flavorless and the peach to be quite unappealing and rather bland in taste. The ricottta was also not pleasant and did not pair well with the prosciutto. So overall, I was not happy with this dish. \\n\\nUpon ordering our entrees, the server was quite helpful in creating pairings for our dishes, as the sommelier had the night off. I thought she did well for both of us in her choosing. For my main course, I chose the duck confit with risotto. I thought this plate was very well put together, although the risotto did seem a bit overcooked and was a tad more on the mushy side than anything else. The duck itself was also quite fatty, but there were some good pieces of meet amongst the breast. \\n\\nTo finish the meal, we selected a moscato and a glass of whiskey. I thought that the dessert and cordials list to be well put together overall. \\n\\nOverall, I would say that my meal was subpar at best.

My dining companion's first comment was, \\"the queso tastes like Doritos\\". And you know what? It kinda did. It wasn't spicy at all, which is nothing short of a crime around here. The salsa wasn't horrible, no ketchup sauce or anything... but it wasn't good either. Pretty watery and not spicy at all.

Cheese Bar comes very close to filling the La Laiterie-shaped hole in my life. The cheese selection is delicious and comprehensive, with the cheese board being a must for a meal (visiting last Saturday, the cheese plate was light on the funky and high on subtle flavors--we complemented our board with 1/4 lb. of delicious British bleu). Selections are diverse, and expertly chosen, but tend to be more global in reach than a true locavore Portlander felt entirely comfortable with. Also, the fixed cheese plate (rather than having the option to select N cheeses from a list of X cheeses), might be seen by some as a drawback, no matter how well-chosen the three options are. \\n\\nThe charcuterie plate that accompanied our meal was delicious, generous, and expertly served. As was the bread pudding which was shared to round out our grazing dinner. \\n\\nTwo things could easily be improved at Cheese Bar. 1) Given the choice of 6 excellent taps (on-tap sours, and an abundant bottle selection? Brilliant!), it would be great to have tasting flights of beer on the menu (4-6 beers + 4 cheeses + 3 preserved meats = flavor paradise). Their absence (along with the absence of thoughtful cocktails) is a loss to the establishment. 2) Table service was not that great. Although the fellow manning the cheese case was knowledgeable and friendly, his compatriots manning the bar, and tables were gruff, pushy (it's better form to ask a patron if he'd like another beer, rather than whisking in to clear a glass with a solid two swigs in it from the table--we were trying to savor our meal, bub), and exuded a general lack of hospitality (I'd like to know that the waitstaff is enthusiastic about helping me and my tablemate enjoy our experience--not bored that we're not knocking back round after round). Just hiring a friendly waitress might do the trick for this one.\\n\\nWhich is all to say, visit Cheese Bar (I know I'll be back), but know that this new spot might still be working out some kinks."},{"name":"Lion's Tail","address":"354 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been to a lot of bars in a lot of places.

We had worked out earlier that evening, yet despite both of us being completely famished by the time we arrived, we found the food to be surprisingly inedible. \\n\\nFirst the positives: \\n\\nThey do a good job with the decor. The upstairs is your standard restaurant fare. The downstairs has a more demonic flair; dark lighting with bold, brightly-colored murals on the walls. Pretty memorable. Upon seating, we tasted their sweet and spicy BBQ sauces, which were pretty good. \\n\\nNow the negatives:\\n\\nWe started with a couple of appetizers: corn fritters, a fried chicken breast, and a fried chicken thigh. The fritters and breast came out a few short minutes after ordering, far less time needed to adequately fry food. The chicken was lukewarm, its paper-thin breaded coating largely unseasoned. The smell of the chicken itself reminded me of the inside of an *okay* McDonald's. \\n\\nThe fritters, somehow, were both soggy and hard, and themselves flavorless aside from the deluge of grocery-store-brand syrup. \\n\\nWe could only assume that this food had been under a heat lamp for a while. The waitress assured us that the food is always made fresh, which would be a more appalling scenario given the quality of the food. \\n\\nWe never received the thigh. Presumably it was wherever the chef left their dignity. \\n\\nAfter an extended wait, we finally receive our entrees: An order of baby back ribs, and their famous brisket, with sides of mac & cheese, baked beans, and collard greens.\\n\\nThe ribs were passable, and ultimately ended up being the only food item we actually finished. The sauce covering them was sweet, mildly smokey, sticky. The meat itself was a bit inconsistent. Some bites were the ideal meat-nearly-falling-off-the-bone, while other bites were pretty tough and dry. \\n\\nThe brisket... hoo boy... despite being one of the more expensive menu items, it was by far the worst of the night. Exceptionally dry, with a texture somewhere between corned-beef and an overcooked turkey. The meat itself was completely flavorless, aside from the aggressive liquid-smoke flavor, which overpowered our best attempts to cover up the taste with BBQ sauce. \\n\\nThe collard greens were unremarkable. It was obvious that they were not prepared by a person who had ever eaten authentic collard greens from the south. They were more like \\"stewed collards,\\" if anything. \\n\\nThe Mac & Cheese had a home-made feel, in that I could have just bought the same box of Easy-Mac and added some Velveeta to get the same flavor. \\n\\nThe BBQ baked beans were swimming in a watered-down version of the BBQ sauces at our table. Inedible. \\n\\nWe also ordered corn bread to cover up the flavor of our entrees. The bread had very little corn in it, possibly to match the minimal amount of moisture in the bread. Not good. \\n\\nThe waitress mercifully did not charge us for most of the food we ordered. Notably, she said that there wasn't a manager in the building that night, so perhaps the cooks just felt that they didn't have to do their jobs properly that night. \\n\\nAs for me, I will never go to Redbones again. Hopefully the management puts a little more focus o the kitchen instead of the kitsch."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Everything  was great!!\\nOysters were so fresh, lobster spaghettini and the ribeye were amazing! \\nCan see why this has such high ratings.

It definitely has a more cafeteria and sterile feel than minado.\\n\\nfood critique:\\n\\nHot food: Hot food is definitely not where this restaurant wins out. The seafood fried rice is very plain. Sometimes they have chow foon and its not bad but most of the time they aren't there. The frog legs and calamari can be tough and chewy from sitting out on the buffet. They have roast duck which is fine but definitely doesn't trump good chinese bbq joints. The Chinese Lobster is good and shows because people definitely empty it out fast hence the sign limiting the customers to three pieces at a time which seems petty.\\n\\nThe salad bar and raw bar are pretty standard and nothing special. I can't remember if they did oysters but they do king crab legs.\\n\\nThe sushi is what I come here for. It is just okay. The unagi, salmon, and tuna pieces are puny and not very satisfying. they're more like popcorn poppers. Some of the Makis are pretty good, especially the ones with shrimp tempura. They do get overzealous with the add ons and some rolls are too sweet. One problem you do run into is the names of the sushi have little to do with whats is in it so I find myself eating something and saying \\"whatever I ate was good but I don't remember the name of it. maybe it was a rocket roll? or a rock n roll roll?\\".\\n\\nThe desserts are like all desserts at chinese/ asian owned buffets; tacky and tasteless. I won't detract any stars from it because I have never cared for the desserts and chocolate fountains at these places.\\n\\nThey do have ice cream which isn't bad.\\n\\nAll in all this place is okay.

However, coffee shops to me are about so much more than just the coffee, and Chrome Yellow really misses the mark on the other aspects of operating in a service industry.\\n\\nLike others have mentioned, I've felt like nothing more than a nuisance each time I've ordered. The baristas seem wholly dissatisfied and annoyed at any accommodations being made to a drink (i.e. if I want an extra shot and am paying $7+ for a latte, don't make me feel terrible about it). The inside is also so intensely  minimalist that it feels cold and pretty uninviting, as though they want to you pay for your coffee and get the heck out. The parking out front has only a few spots, and although I'm a major fan of settling in neighborhoods that are up-and-coming, the side street seems sort of unsafe next to Chrome Yellow.\\n\\nI love to see local businesses thrive, so I hope they address these issues.

The other locations (to the best of my knowledge) have avoided the tip option on credit card payments, and the social pressure that goes along with it.  At this location, you now have to choose a tip amount when paying by credit card. This is a little off topic but I'm getting annoyed by fast food and some fast casual restaurants asking for a tip. At traditional dine in restaurants, I usually tip 20-25% because I appreciate the service that I am tipping for.  In this case, you're not allowed to make any changes to pizza toppings because they operate on a fast production model.  You seat yourself. You clean your own tables (at least we do).  You get your own drinks.  Why do you ask for a 20% tip and who am I tipping?  I don't tip at Chick-fil-A yet they have a cashier that takes my order and kitchen staff to prepare the food.   I digress...\\n\\nSummary: great pizza, ample parking, pleasant environment.

Blue Star Cafeteria is able to stay in business only because The Omelettry is so ridiculously popular on the weekends. To paint a picture, it was late Sunday morning, I saw the two hour wait, and then remembered Blue Star. It's just a stones throw away and rarely has a wait, so it seemed like a pretty good alternative. \\n\\nHowever, as I soon found out, my overall dining experience was (just like before) not going to be very good. I'm trying to keep this short and sweet, so I'll do my best to summarize: \\n\\n1) The service was horrendous. Our waiter was able to keep coffee cups full, but not much else. A wrong order and taking an overly long amount of time (10+ minutes) to correct it (which simply involved bringing out an English muffin). \\n\\n2) The food was simply not good enough. I had pancakes, bacon, and coffee. My friend had the French toast. Honestly, I have had better pancakes and French toast at Denny's. And this brings me to the third item... \\n\\n3) $15 for coffee, pancakes, and bacon is simply too expensive. How do they get away with charging these kinds of prices? Obviously morons like me come in and pay it because The Omelettry had a two hour wait! \\n\\nConclusion, I've been burned twice by Blue Star and that's two times too many for me.

There was no room for us to wait in the restaurant either, but for our 30-45 min. wait we just browsed the shops around the area. We didn't have to worry about staying close since they took down our number and called us once our table was ready (this was awesome and I wish more places would use this method!).\\n\\nWe ordered a dozen West Coast Oysters from the raw bar. The names escape me at the moment but the 2 kinds we ordered were delicious and extremely fresh! Then came our main meal - we each decided on ordering the Hot Maine Lobster Roll ($25). At first I was undecided between ordering it cold (served with Mayo) or hot (served with Butter). We asked the waitress what most people order and she said it was pretty much split down the middle and just depends on what you're in the mood for. I finally joined my 2 girls in their hot orders. The Lobster Roll was AMAZING to say the least. It came out on a toasted roll with large heaping pieces of fresh, juicy, delicious Lobster falling out of the roll. The butter made the roll that much more enjoyable! It also came with a side of fries.

If you haven't been down Lamar lately you'd be pleasantly surprised by all of the new developments. Some great bars and restaurants (mostly locally owned) and many more in the coming months. The Outback, across the street just closed, Chili's is gone, and I have to think that The Park (and others like them) are part of the reason national chains don't work so well in an area like South Lamar. Too many good alternatives, and this place is definitely worth checking out. \\n\\nThe Park: It's a Sports Bar, American, with some style. Two beautiful outdoor patios, a nice main area (with a ton of big screens) and a large meeting room. The food is decent and there are some great specials. I particularly like the $5 burger night.

The absolute best of the four was the Cauliflower and Brussels, which was stir-fried in a spicy, salty olive oil.  Humorously, the sauces for my oysters were placed next to the cauliflower dish (well away from my oysters) so we thought that these peculiar sauces were intended for the cauliflower and brussels sprouts.  They certainly tasted good as an accompaniment, but, later, the server was embarrassed that the \\"new guy\\" misplaced the dishes and confused us as to their intent.  \\n\\nAside from this mishap, everything was prepared thoughtfully, the servers were pleasant and talkative and the music was great.

I also work in the service industry and I definitely wouldn't ignore any of my customers, it's pretty rude.  So we decided to leave.  Instead of trying to make it right, all the waitress asked was what was wrong and why we were leaving.  Upon explaining the situation she pretty much acted like she could care less rather than trying to make it right.  Damn I was really looking forward to your chai oatmeal pancakes which are AMAZING.  Had no choice but to leave, I have a feeling it would have only gotten worse.  So I will say this, your food is super tasty but your waitstaff (except Jason with the glasses) could use a few lessons in basic customer service.

Ok... no one calls me that, but I like to think I know good chicken when I taste it. PONKO puts a new spin on the traditional fried chicken strip (think crispy, tender, and slightly sweet) and it's actually really good. For sides I had the fries and the potato salad. The potato was nothing to write home about but the fries were so yummy! I loved the seaweed and sesame seeds as seasoning. I had soda (which you pay for by the can) and my fianc√©e had the tea (which she enjoyed, but if you want a refill expect to pay $1). She also had the carrot cake and I had the chocolate chip and walnut cookie. The cake was great and moist but the cookie is a crispy one.

Once when we got to the patio, again when our food came, and again after we were half way finished with our meal. We had actually packed up the remainder of our meal to go sit in the car with the heat on when the manager finally came to turn on the heat.

The barbecue pork bun was overly sweet, the deep fried seafood dumpling was cold and greasy, but the fried turnip cake was good, as was the egg custard and the veggie low mein.  Unfortunately, the servers neglected to bring a couple of items, including my favorite, shrimp har gow, and when it came time to leave, we asked if they could give it to us to go.  They misunderstood and just took the item off the bill.  They also forgot to bring us water.  Be forewarned that if you go to Chinese restaurants, you will get brusque, indifferent service.  I don't mind, since I prefer that to waitstaff hovering over you and pretending to be your best friend and all.  Just expect service to be minimal, with minimal conversation, and that you must bark out your orders in clear, declarative statements.  But brusqueness is one thing and incompetence is another, and sadly Bubor Cha Cha's service was more on the incompetent side of the spectrum.\\n\\nOn the plus side, I give kudos to the waiter who strategically placed himself between our table and the next one over, effectively blocking the crazy guy who tried to strike up a conversation with me.

The bun the burgers were served were massive and unnecessary for the delicate flavours of the protein.  My colleague's salmon burger was served with raw onions (which was not part of the description on the menu).  So this was returned to the kitchen.  I am not sure who thought the mild taste of salmon would go along with the very strong flavour of raw red onion.

There's a fried lotus chip on the side that was light and delish. The fish itself was done medium and would have preferred it rare but the serving size I got was smaller than a regular entree so that may explain it. The sauce that the tuna was sitting on was a pickled ginger sauce with orchid petals for color. Delicious and pretty! \\n\\nNew Orleans Shrimp - peppery sauce with Parmesan shavings on top on top of grits and sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms and some sort of greens. This dish is a little spicy but the smoothness of the grits offsets it. The grits are heavenly and full of flavor and I could eat a bowl of this all by itself. \\n\\nBig Fin Swordfish - so delicious!

The cornflake coconut chicken was oily, even for a fried item. My friend didn't want me to order it, because she said the other patrons' fried dishes looked like they were being made with old oil, but I did anyway, and it looked like ours was given a new batch of oil. The mango chutney it was served with was surprisingly very spicy - I like spicy things, but let's please label them that way. \\n\\nThe grilled 5-cheese was also EXTREMELY greasy, I thought it had been deep fried it was so greasy and hot.

I think folks have convinced themselves this place is better than it is because it's always \\"crowded\\" and we all know that people don't usually wait in long lines for bad food. \\n\\nHowever it's \\"crowded\\" because it's a shack that doesn't seat more than 20. Again the food was fine (not great, just fine)  but there are other fine places to eat with more room and shorter waits.

I thought that was excessive, but whatever. Went when it said my meal would be done and was told they just \\"must have missed it,\\" and had not even put my order in. The woman at the cash register was a bit snotty and at no point offered an apology--nor a refund, full or partial.\\n\\nFast forward about 30 minutes later and I still don't have my food. I got it after about 35-40 minutes of waiting and expressed my displeasure with one of the employees.

I ordered chicken and they gave me tofu. At this point I called the restaurant and told them and said, all things considered, I should get a refund. The employee told me he did not have the power to do that, but would give my name and number to the manager, who would call me and most likely provide a refund.

We stayed near by the restaurant, so when we woke up, we got to the restaurant around 10 am and the wait was 2 hrs and 45 min.  So we went back to the hotel, checked out and walked around.  Then finally, they called around 1235 pm.  So the approximate wait time is right on the dot which is nice.  Anyhow so the bigger entree I wanted to order for brunch was out. It's wirh egg, biscuit and fried oysters.  So I ended up ordering potato bravas, Korean fried chicken bowl with an egg and bim bop bacon bowl.  It didn't feel like a brunch because of our choices.  I looked around and i saw yummy looking burger, steak and eggs and breakfast sandwiches.  I love the selection they have for brunches.  Not only limited to eggs and omelettes.

I hesitated to go in and mention it because I didn't want to complain, but decided to anyway because I wanted the rest of my burrito. When I told the gentleman who took my order that there was cheese in my burrito, he asked me my order number, went and checked the kitchen ticket, and came back and said you never said no cheese. Now, I distinctly remembered what I said, and relayed it back to him verbatim. He never apologized, and just left me standing there like I was a nuisance. He finally asked if I wanted a new burrito, commenting the one I had been given had been mostly eaten. I said yes, and he rolled his eyes and walked to the kitchen to tell the cook. He came back and I tried to explain that I hadn't tasted or noticed the cheese until then and I wasn't trying to get a free burrito, just what I ordered. He had an attitude the entire time and made me feel like it was my fault.\\n\\nNow to be clear, I'm wasn't angry about the cheese.

To the people complaining about the lack of variety- can you honestly eat everything on the menu? I have ordered almost everything (in one sitting) at Takusan, Yamato, and eaten just about everything at Maki Maki. I'd say it is plenty of food. The size of the sushi seems small, but it really isn't a big deal (pun intended) since you can EAT AS MANY AS YOU WANT. I'd say come earlier if you want to avoid the lines and I'd recommend lunch.\\n\\nI think any place that has all you can eat oysters is not sustainable anyway. I remember at Takusan they pretty much gave up on oysters at dinner time because they can't make money. The dessert selection here is spectacular. I'd have to say my favorite is the mango pudding. As far as it being awkward for eating too much, I pretty much have no shame and will eat until they physically kick me out. I might review the dinner later, but I think I will stick with the lunch buffet. There seems to be a chocolate fountain in the back, but I would probably die from being too fat. I've experienced chocolate fountains at a place called Hokkaido near UCLA, and they seem to be overhyped. Sure they seem great on their own, but I feel like it doesn't really match well with the sushi. \\n\\nThe non-sushi items are pretty good. They have individual plates of fish eggs for some reason that no one seems to get except me. I noticed that this place is probably run by Chinese people so obviously there are going to be Chinese things like roast duck. What I thought was amazing was that they have tonkatsu style fried pork cutlets. I love those things....and they are all you can eat!?!?! There's a station for udon, much like a place called Todai, but I came here to eat the more expensive things.\\n\\nWhat I like about this place is that it is not one of those dubious \\"all you can eat\\" places that are actually \\"all you can order.\\" I'm not going to name names, but it seems like forcing people to wait for the sushi to be prepared while thinking if you can eat 20 more pieces or not will always end up terribly. Oh no, what will we do with all those rolls that we thought we could eat 10 minutes ago but now can't fit in our stomachs? We'll just have to hide the rice somewhere and hope they don't charge us extra for wasting food?!? I kind of hate that business model even though many would argue that the presentation of the food is great for the instagrams. \\n\\nOverall, I recommend this place but maybe not too much since it might get too crowded if a ton of people actually come. Ideally just enough people will come to have it in business while still allowing me to get my food in a timely manner. It is also a lot closer than Minado's or whatever that place is called.

The staff is incredibly friendly, the music is insane (they played 'I Just Can't Wait to Be King' - which is why this review isn't one star), and the location is convenient. The food, however, isn't anything special. I had the Korean Fried Chicken, and when I first got it, I was super pumped. After about three bites, it turned more into work and less into eating. The flavors were average, and it reminded me of those nasty bowls you can get at Kentucky Fried Chicken. My buddy got the frittata, but let's be honest, it was a couple of eggs and some greens. I could have made that dish when I was six. I probably will come back, but only because I love the tapas concept. Still, I feel like this place is trying a bit too hard.

There was no hint, no slight suggestion of the \\"carefully thought out\\" flavours that I have read about anywhere in my dinner. I shudder to think that this place has been called one of the best restaurants in Cambridge. This is certainly not the establishment of a famed chef. My family and I went on a Friday night thinking that this would be a great place to celebrate my family's last night in town and also my graduation. Oh, how wrong we were! \\n\\nAt $72 for a four course prix fixe menu, the food was extremely forgettable so much so I am struggling to recall what I ate (thankfully, I have the horrible habit of taking pictures of everything I eat). For starters, I had ordered chicken-stuffed morels and red treviso. Neither of the starters whet my appetite in the slightest. Then, for the entr√©e, I had the chewiest beef I have ever eaten. I could have cut the beef with a chainsaw and it still wouldn't have sufficed. I did not finish my entr√©e.\\n\\nTowards the end of the evening, my optimistic, na√Øve side held out and I hoped against hope that the dessert would redeem the evening. It didn't. I ordered the chocolate olive sorbet with cherry cake that sounded quite interesting on paper. In reality, all I remember eating was a bizarre concoction of grassy bitter ice cream.

The waitress approached us and was not blatantly rude but she definitely was not hospitable either. She told us that there would be  a two hour wait and proceeded to write our phone number down onto the waiting list. So we left and decided to continue to explore Boston while we waited for her phone call. About two hours later, we were told that a table was being held for us.\\n\\nAs we were walking to the restaurant, there was a  crowd standing on front of the entrance waiting to added onto the waiting list. When the crowd of Caucasian noticed a couple of African American descent walking towards the entrance, they closed ranks and would not let us by. We explained that we were called to come in after being on the waiting list and we were not \\" cutting the line \\". Despite our explanations, we literally had to shove our way in. Once we made it in, after all of the shoving and looks of disgusts, the waitress barely looks at us when she asks us to wait in the corner. We stood in the corner for approximately 20 minutes while she helped every other patron  sign onto the waiting list.\\n\\nWe were seated and a group of Caucasian females looked at us distastefully and proceeded to pick up their purses and pass it to the end of their table that was opposite of my boyfriend and I. We each ordered the clam chowder and lobster roll which were amazing, but would have tasted better if our waitress actually cared about our dining experience and stopped by our table every now and again. Aside from serving us our food, she didn't ask us if we needed anything else or if we were satisfied. We also realized that as the other patrons were leaving and were being replaced with those that were on the waiting list, the waitress made it a point to make sure that every single other table was filled before seating another couple beside us.\\n\\nIn summary, I have never felt so \\" Black\\" in my life. My boyfriend and I are both professionals with a very respectable appearance. I am in part upset with myself for allowing others too make me feel so little. It was very apparent that having those of color in the restaurant was as foreign to them as aliens.

There were three couples and Audrey, which made for an intimate group, without being too large or too small.  We had so much diversity in our food choices, ranging from quaint cheese shops, to public markets, to \\"hidden\\" gems in back  alleys, to large busy bakeries; all were made to feel welcoming because of the special relationship Audrey has with each owner/place.  It is clear that Audrey loves what she does and has a vast knowledge about food, but the part we loved the most was the passion she had for showcasing the people and the area.  This is clearly more than just a job for her.  She is superior to other hired guides.  This is truly where she grew up and what she loves.  In her words, \\"These are my people!\\"   Audrey was also kind and funny and when it was time to go, we wished we had longer.  People compare food tours to a dinner out, but we would argue that this is far more of a shared experience where multiple layers come together to create a memory you will revisit again and again.

Unfortunately, I left incredibly disappointed and almost angry. Read on if you wish to read my experience.\\n\\nMy party of 4 made dinner reservations online. We were running late so we made a courtesy call to let them know we were on our way.  When we arrived, our table was not prepared and it took them more time than needed to seat us. Mind you, the restaurant was half empty and they had a table of 6 and reduced it to 4 for us. I don't understand why this wasn't ready by our reservation time. So we ended up standing by the hostess desk for at least 5 minutes so they can set up something they should have done 15 minutes ago. \\n\\nThen it just went down hill from there. The service we received from our server was less than mediocre, it was terrible. We waited about 10-15 minutes for him to come say hi and get our drink order. We waited so long we were ready to order by the time he got to us. One of our drink orders asked for a side of OJ...You'd expect that a server would return to you and tell you if they were out of something before they actually place the order. Instead, we received the drink without the side of OJ.. We asked him where the OJ was and he said they were out... Should we have known this, we would've changed our order. We didn't say anything...\\n\\nWe asked him about some of the Appetizers that we could share as a party and that were also potentially Vegetarian friendly. He was absolutely ZERO help in describing the italian dishes to us. He basically told us to share a salad. We didn't end up trying anything.\\n\\nI ordered the Lasagna which turned out pretty bad. It was a oily mess that tasted as though it was previously frozen. I'm almost certain it was because the ground beef was the texture of soft dog food. I'd advise against trying this dish at all costs. The texture was terrible and lacked flavour. We wanted some fresh ground pepper but no pepper was offered. In fact, our server never even came to check up on our food. Our waters were empty, our drinks were drank, and we were prepared to just get out of there. I must mention again that the restaurant was half full and he only had 2 other small parties. We watched him walk by many times without acknowledging our existence. We ate what we could and sat around trying to get his attention. He still did not return and even other servers came by to pick up our dirty dishes. We flagged down another server and requested the bill while we watch him just wiping down the bar table and putting glasses away?! WTF?!  We had zero desire to be there any longer.  When our bill dropped, we waited another ten minutes so he could take our payment but we got so fed up that we went up to him to pay. It was by far one of the most horrible experiences I have had at a 'classier' restaurant.  I've received better customer service at McDonald's.\\n\\nIf our service was exceptional, I wouldn't be bothered by the mediocre food and may give this place another try.

MMMMMM !!!!\\n\\nSeveral orgasmic food things can be found on Neptune's menu, including (explanations below):\\n\\n + Clam Chowder                          11.00\\n + Oysters                                        2.30 to 2.80 ea\\n + Sweet Potato Puree                  part of a 31.00 entree\\n + Warm Buttered Lobster Roll   25.00\\n\\nCLAM CHOWDER\\nMilky, not over-creamed, clean crisp taste if you ever thought that was possible of a chowder, definitely not your traditional version, but had all the classic ingredients (clam chunks, potatoes, cream).  Something about the underlying flavor of this dish ROCKED my world.  Perhaps an extra concentrated lobster broth?  Salsify?  What is it??\\n\\nOYSTERS\\nFlying Point, ME - HUGE shell, big and meaty with an earthy mushroom finish; Pemaquid, ME - medium in size with a citrus finish (definitely accurately described by Neptune staff); Sunnyside, PEI - medium in size, mild flavor with a rush of sake at the end (boo-yah!).  My fave was definitely Flying Point.  In my mind, the bigger the better!  And at $2.3 ea, it was a great deal, too!  Pricing the individual oyster is the way to go.  Neptune is king at that.\\n\\nSWEET POTATO PUREE\\nThis special item came with Saturday's special of pork 'n clams.  It was prepared this time with two thick pork chops served over a dollop of the puree and all of this topped with fried clams and julienned apple slaw.  This whole dish was divine, might I add, but the puree was something to behold.  Sweet potato, you think, sweet.  But not this time.  It's sweet was cut with some mystery savory thing and it was light and umami-licious!  A bowl of that stuff aside my lobster roll would put me over the edge!  Speaking of which ...\\n\\nWARM BUTTERED LOBSTER ROLL\\nIf you love lobster, you must get this dish!  Don't be swayed to trying other thingers, because this dish will get your libido rolling!  It's not an impressive size but when has size mattered in life...?  *shrug*  The warm version must be opted for over cold, since, where else can you get a warm lobster roll except in CT??  It's served with thick cut fries (hardly worthwhile).  Ah, but the meat of the lobster is nice and cut into mouthful sized pieces where you can tell which piece is from the tail, knuckle, and claw.  It's drizzled with warm butter which soaks right into the roll.  And all together: salt, butter, meat, and soft roll with a slight char ... WOW I was in heaven!  I consider myself a picky lobster eater but I will return over and over for this treasure.\\n\\nOther things to consider:\\n + The restaurant is small.  The bar is reserved for diners not waiters.  Expect to wait.  There are no reservations.\\n + Some of the other entree options weren't up to par with the flavors of the dishes described above.  \\n + The Vitello Tonnato was bland and difficult to eat.  \\n + The mussels, though very well prepared, were over-dilled.  I'd say stick with the fronds and root, but forget about the seeds.\\n + The salmon was unimpressive in size and cooked quality.  Perhaps slightly over-cooked.\\n + TRY the special for the night.  This isn't your restaurants leftovers.  Think: fresh catch/in season.\\n\\nI SHALL RETURN\\nAll in all, I can't wait to return to try all of the offerings and/or gorge myself in beautifully shucked oysters all day and paired with a Whale's Tale or Geary's Pale Ale."},{"name":"Lebowski's Grill","address":"8909 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"After my workout this morning and then crawling around in the attic forever, I was starving for a burger.

I didn't have any, though, I had a cocktail which was a tad sour for my taste but it was fine.  I ordered the turkey sandwich with garlic fries.  The turkey, rather than being shaved or sliced, was a thick, heavy slab that was pretty dry and didn't have much flavor.  It had a carrot and cabbage slaw that was too thickly grated; it was too heavy and too crunchy for the sandwich, and it didn't contribute much flavor.  The toasted brioche bun was very good.  And the garlic fries were also very good.  Crispy and fresh, with a flavorful garlic seasoning.  The spicy tomato aioli wasn't really very memorable, though.  One of my dinner companions had the tomato soup, which he said was too strongly smoky for his taste, and the layered caesar salad, which was much smaller than he was anticipating.\\n\\nThe new decor is pleasing, if fairly bog-standard for the whole \\"craft beer gastropub\\" trend.

It was between here and Sportello and this place won principally because I thought lunch counter seating was not ideal for a first date. Another time, Barbara. Lydia and her fun hair win this round. \\n\\nWe arrived around 12:30 and the place seemed to fill up throughout our meal. The gent I was with mentioned the crowd had a \\"median age of 60\\". Maybe that's a Friday lunch crowd. It's in the Liberty Hotel, which seems like a fun, chic place that might draw a younger crowd so I have no doubt that the demographic changes.\\n\\nOur server was sweet, but clearly nervous (but not crippling-y so). I asked him about something Riesling-like from their menu and he enlisted the help of the bartender. A lovely young woman came over and we exchanged wine chat and it resulted in her bringing me a taste of two wines (even though I said not to worry about tasting and just to pick one), which I think were the falanghina and the gavi di gavi. Both were delicious, but I picked the one that packed more flavor to play with my palette. My gentleman caller seemed to thoroughly enjoy two glasses of prosecco. \\n\\nNow, for the food. In scoping out places, I thought \\"The pizza here looks smashtastic\\" (Copyright, Andy Hart 2011). So, that's what I went with, specifically the vidalia onion, prosciutto, and pear mostarda pizza. The gent got a caesar salad with grilled chicken. First, the salad was not to be underestimated or yawned at if only for the chicken which was plentiful and looked like it had a nice char going on. That salad deserves a hearty golf clap. The pizza was phenomenal! I don't know if it's possible and/or appropriate for a pizza to melt in your mouth, but that's what this did. Not that you have to worry about a vidalia onion's flavor too much, but it was wonderfully subtle. And the mostarda - how fun! It was candied pieces of pear that carried a spicy kick. I ended up eating only one slice (again, shame on the gent for being a good conversationalist and so dashing), but enjoyed two slices for an afternoon snack, shared one with a friend (who thought it was scrumptious), and have two pieces left for tomorrow. I was thinking I could poach an egg and put it over the top of a slice for breakfast. Think about that: poached egg over arugula, prosciutto, \\"melted\\" vidalia onions, and a thin crispy dough. You're welcome.\\n\\nFor dessert, we shared a dark chocolate cake with vanilla creme anglaise and a salty caramel ice cream. It was so elegantly presented, but not overdone or showy. It was also delicious. \\n\\nThe one thing I have to say is the service was wonderful. Sure, our server was nervous and a little slow on the uptake, but he was very interested in making sure things were going okay. I'm guessing/hoping he was in training. Kudos to him! Aside from him, the service seemed happy to enjoy a joke, but also very serious about what was going on at that place.\\n\\nI would absolutely return, hopefully for dinner.

This however is well deserving one star.\\n\\nI ordered pick up and the service was rather horrible. I was told it would take 10 minutes and I was in a rush as my phone was running out of batteries. It was already set to airplane mode to conserve energy and I needed my phone available during the day.\\n\\nThe customer service was remarkably slow. There was basically one guy working the till and preparing the pizza (I don't think I saw him wash his hands inbetween.)\\n\\nIt wouldn't be a problem if the pizza was made quickly and I could get on with my day but some unusual guy wondered in from Granville Street and started asking a whole bunch of question. Instead of preparing the pizza since the man already started stretching the dough. He decided it was a better decision to go back to the till while I waited on with my half finished pizza.\\n\\nSince it took so long I checked back as I was waiting in the store whether my pizza was ready. Finally the other guy in the back came out and picked up the pizza taking a photo of the pizza with his cellphone for whatever reason before boxing it. \\n\\nOverall, it could have been good but they need better systems and processes in place. The one man shouldn't be handling the pizza making and the till at the same time. If anything, he should have finished making the pizza - which took no more than 2 minutes to dress the toppings and put in the oven - before going back to the till to entertain the man with unusual questions for another 10 minutes while my pizza left there undone. If anything, the other guy in the back could probably have taken the other person coming in while this man finished making my pizza so he didn't go back and forth between the till and food prep.\\n\\nOverall, it's bad customer experience and leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The other guy asking all the unusual questions also ended up leaning over the window seal as the man prepped my pizza adding concerns about hygiene.\\n\\nAt least finish making the pizza you started stretching and put it in the oven so it bakes while you go back to the till.

(Besaw's is a notable exception.) This seemingly \\"fair\\" system can thus result in people standing in the wind or rain or cold for up to an hour or more--and that, combined with travel time, means that The Goods had better be darn worth it.  We've not yet dined at Tasty N Sons in the past due to this issue (coming in from the West Side, we figured it would be a 3-hour lapse between waking and food), but with downtown only 20 minutes away and Tasty N Alder being brand-spanking new (less than 2 weeks old), we figured last Saturday was optimal for brunch and a matinee at Living Room theaters.\\n\\nFirst of all, the setting (the renovated cleaners building) is homey and lovely, with lots of wood; points and props for the luxurious bar, an actual indoor waiting area (though it only has room for about 10 people), and coffee up front.  The cheerful hostess offered to get us a cocktail to start as well as forecasting a 20-30 minute wait; exactly 25 minutes later we were sat in a row banquette--intimate, but maybe a bit squished.  However, if you're willing to wait longer, there are lots of tables alongside the windows, as well as some elevated 2-tops next to the bar--more time, but a bit more wiggle room.  Also, this is not a restaurant for those sensitive to noise; it's not unbearable, but it's sure not a monastary, either.\\n\\nComing in as Tasty newbies, everything was a discovery.  We started with a potato-chocolate doughnut, which was still warm, dusted with sugar and in a pool of creme anglaise.  This was wonderful, but definitely sweet (maybe a little less sugar?), and one was plenty.  A salad with a house-made vinagrette was earthy and satisfying, and very generous portion-wise; also props for leaving off the carrots when requested.  The main course was the biscuit sandwich, which was to die for--gorgeous, flakey biscuits with cheese and egg, and your choice of meat; we ordered the fried chicken breast, which was flavorful and delicious without the ka-pow spice (and 2 hour wait) of Screen Door's.  (It's also cut and shaped to the biscuit, which makes eating a lot easier.)  Future items on the list to try include the baked apple with cheese and lardons, coffee cake (also available as a dessert item), and a spin on Toad-in-the-hole.\\n\\nOddly, the only dischordant notes during brunch involved beverages.  The decaf coffee was noticeably on the weak side (more Justin Bieber than George Clooney, let alone Samuel L. Jackson) but adding a bit of leaded perked it up.  We ordered some bubbly water such as Pellegrino, Perrier, etc; the restaurant doesn't have any, but our server said she'd bring us some club soda--and didn't.  Finally, a grasshopper shake has a satisying creme de menthe flavor, but the consistency (due largely to the alchol) was somewhat thin.  Defintely want to come back for dinner and order an Elizabeth Taylor (made from violets, of course).\\n\\nService was personable and pleasant, if not the warm-hug-feeling you sometimes get at Beesaw's, Byways, or Tin Shed.  (In all fairness, the place was quite busy; however, it's probably only going to get crazier as word of mouth spreads.) Value-wise, we ate all of the above for about $28, which is decent for a downtown brunch place of quality.  (Just going to Biscuits Cafe in the 'burbs will run you around that much these days.) \\n\\nGenerally speaking, we were pleased with our first visit, and hope that the minor kinks get worked out over the next few weeks.  It would be great if Tasty opened at 8 before the crowds came out, but the owner said in an interview that finding good chefs willing to get there at 7 vs. 5 is like night vs. day; at this point, based on the yumminess, I think we're willing to eat a piece of fruit when we wake up, and brave the crowds for a little wait at Tasty N Alder (though the spring rains might change our opinion)."},{"name":"Ichiza Kitchen & Tea House","address":"5411 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I ordered the Lan Zhou and it was delicious and beautifully presented.

I started to have FOMO because I wasn't in the area to enjoy their brunch test kitchen. Finally, I took a long lunch and headed over there on Friday for lunch a.k.a. brunch test kitchen. This place does not disappoint and I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of people that were enjoying their lunch on a Friday.\\n\\nThe Menu: What I really like about this place is that they update their menu every week with their new offerings. I usually find their menu on the Facebook page or on their Instagram stories. I appreciate the early release of the menu so I can make a decision before driving up there. The menu is diverse and provides something for everyone. Personally, I try to get whatever is being tested for that week while most of the time my friends or something more on the tame side.\\n\\nThe location: Since I am always driving, this is not a very easily accessible parking scenario. Since it is in South Boston there are numerous resident only parking and the parking that's for the public it's few and far between. This is just more of a heads up to know that you will not find or very unlikely find a space close to the restaurant. But don't worry, you're better off walking a few blocks since you're going to be gouging on delicious food and drink shortly.\\n\\nThe Food: Since the brunch test kitchen changes every Friday I can only speak to the foods that I have eaten. This week in the spirit of Fall I chose an appetizer of the apple cider donuts. These donuts were more of a cake donut and a lot less fluffy. However, the bacon and pecan brown butter crumble and the whip cream made up for it. The order provided two of the cake donuts and it was a great start before my next course. Since they provide decent size portions I decided to go with another appetizer for my main meal. In the spirit of brunch I decided to get the breakfast dumplings 3rd addition. It's stated that it was Bacon and fried egg aioli, hot sauce and sesame but it just tasted like a regular dumpling to me. Still delicious! But that's the whole point of a test kitchen to see what works and what doesn't. We also ordered the meatball pizza which was cheesy and delicious. But, the center was a bit soggy so it was difficult to pick up the pizza and eat it. I opted for the fork and knife due to the sogginess. \\n\\nThe Drinks: Since I go on my lunch break I can't have alcohol beverages but the virgin Bloody Mary that I had was phenomenal. I love spicy bloody Mary's and  it's very hard to hit my level of spice..... and man they did it! I didn't even need the vodka because it tasted so good! I'm a little obsessed with bloody Mary's and this ranks in my top three of all time and it was virgin! I can't wait to come here in the evening or on the weekends so I can try one of their delicious boozy shakes that make me jealous that I can't drink them While on lunch.\\n\\nCome here on a date, with friends or your family for a great atmosphere and delicious food.

The low ceilings and funky furniture bring a vibe to this small space unlike any other tapas bar or Winter Park restaurant.\\n\\nScratch was perfect for sharing a variety of flavors and cuisines with a friend. Anyone can dish out an \\"Artisanal Cheese Plate\\", but pairing it with berries, house-made fruit preserves and toasted brioche made it memorable.

The real winner though was the Pork Belly    Adobo - tender, juicy and served over black rice and a carrot puree with micro scallions. Scratch did an amazing job delivering culinary forward dishes in a way that you can share and savor with others in your party. Oh and how could I forget about the wine flight?

Because wherever I travel, I'm always looking for the \\"perfect hot dog.\\" Whether traveling with the family on vacation or in a town for an overnight business trip, if I can find a local shop that claims to have great dogs, I'm there! I simply don't understand how I had never run across Barkers until now. Maybe part of the answer is that Atlantan's overwhelming talk about that hot dog travesty sold at the Varsity whenever hot dogs come up in a conversation. Ugh!\\n\\nI can't say I've had everything there is but I've certainly eaten a wide selection. From the standards of great street food in New York, Chicago, and other large cities to mystery concoctions that are locally called hot dogs (A slaw dog w/ ketchup on a toasted bun. Where else but in eastern North Carolina.) \\n\\nBut, what's the worse? Has to be the hot dog from a cart outside  the Tower of London. Visualize a large vienna sausage w/  sugary ketchup on a hard bun. May have been acceptable had it not been ice cold. Hideous.\\n\\nMy favorite? Ted's Hot Dogs in Buffalo, NY. I have never actually flown to Buffalo only to get a hot dog but I have, many times, extended my returning flight to make sure I could get an extra dose of Ted's charcoal grilled, real chili and spicy mustard goodness.\\n\\nSo to backup,  where in all this is Barkers? I place them as a solid #3.  Nationally. Without a doubt they are the best outside of any big city dog I've sampled anywhere in North America and that includes New York, Chicago, D.C, Philadelphia, Toronto, San Francisco, Vancouver, etc. etc.. And exceed in quality the majority of those big city offerings. At the very least Barkers is the best in the southeastern United States.\\n\\nAnd to address the earlier poster about the cost: I bought 2 original chili dogs, fries, and a large root beer for about $10.50. High? Don't think so. I drove 30 miles each way for the experience and the gas cost more than the dogs. Prices are related to competition and success. Barkers  needs to stay in business so we can enjoy their dogs. Charge what the market will bear.\\n\\nI'll definitely be back. After all, a round trip ticket to Buffalo is almost $300, not including the rental car. So $10.50 plus gas is a real deal!\\n\\nJoel Quinn\\nQuinn Companies\\n\\nwww.readysetbackup.com"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Simple concept and great food. \\nYes, there is a line, but who cares if you are in Portland!

To make it even worse, these were some of the tiniest and most expensive sushi in town.  The Westcoast coasts $10 and is absolutely nothing special.  The veggie power has natto and I thought cucumber and avocado would balance it out, but because the rice is not seasoned at all and it was actually made with NO avocados, it was the worst I have ever had.

Over the years, Redbones has gotten too popular to enjoy, because of the wait time to sit.  However, here's a few tips:  order out, if you live nearby.  Go on an off-time.  This is important, especially if you love brisket.  If you get in around 3:30 pm on a weekend, you'll get the brisket right out of the smoker, and you will achieve Nirvana. Imagine the most tender and moist brisket, with all the juices flowing.  The smoky flavor only surpassed by the fact that you can cut it with a fork.   And, you can get seated.\\n\\nIf you go during regular dining hours, go alone, and sit at the counter near the kitchen.  Sure, it's chaotic, and noisy, but the chefs throw tid-bits atcha.  Stay away from the Belgian beers.  The double and triple brews have a real kick to them, and you will get wrecked really quickly.

Charcoal is located next to London Drugs on No.3 Road / Westminster Hwy in Richmond. Before it's time it's predecessor used to be a Korean BBQ resto. Charcoal makes a great place for lunch especially since it doesn't get too brutally busy (dinner time can be quite crowded however) and has plenty of free underground parking. Lunch sets are reasonably priced. 10 bux will get you a fairly generous set. The food here has a creative fusion flare and the menu is quite extensive - japanese fusion, suikiyaki and korean bbq... the photo album consisting of their menu is a nice bonus... see what you are getting into first! Charcoal is clean and seats are comfortable... Some of the food is hit or miss... most of the rolls are variations of the usual suspects: california roll, dynamite roll, dragon roll...\\n\\nTako Wasa...\\nBaby octopus marinated in wasabi sauce... served with seaweed for wrapping / scooping. taka wasa is one of my favorite chilled starters at izakayas but I find it lending towards the salty side.\\n\\nShark Fin Salad...\\nMarinated shark fin (imitation shark fin!) and jellyfish is another refreshing appie to start the meal. Nicely portioned, slightly spicy and tangy.\\n\\nHamachi and Kanpachi Sashimi...\\nThe waitress recommended kanpachi to us since they ran out of tuna toro! =( Although both yellowtail fishes; hamachi flavor and color is more intense compared to kanpanchi... I prefer hamachi more... kanpanchi reminds me to tai sashimi.\\n\\nThe Madness Roll...\\nBasically a California roll topped with tuna, green onion (think negitoro roll filling) and sesame topped with salmon tempura... is average and really nothing special.\\n\\nCharcoal Roll...\\n\\"house\\" roll with tempura prawn (think dynamite roll), spicy tuna, avocado and topped with salmon... this was much tastier than the madness roll...\\n\\nBig Roller Roll...\\nMixture of chopped scallop topped with unagi and avocado... this is a very creamy roll, loaded with ingredients with two kinds of sauce drizzled on top: 1. Tangy thousand island rendition; 2. sweet teriyaki like sauce.\\n\\nChicken Yakisoba...\\nPart of the lunch special menu that came with 4 gyozas and miso soup. Although a good deal for the portion the noodles was way too salty and oily. Gyozas were your average stuffed pork and cabbage.\\n\\nFireballs...\\nTakoyaki of deep fried crab and avocados topped with dried squid bonito flakes... heavy on batter and slightly fishy... I still prefer a traditional takoyaki\\n\\nBacon Kinoko Yakiudon...\\nCreamy pan fried udon with mushrooms, kinoko, bonito flakes...  a sister version to the Mentaiko Yakiudon. Yummy, I usually add some Japanese chili powder for extra seasoning. Sometimes it gets a bit bland.\\n\\nOther notables...\\nSashimi wrap...\\nChopped tuna, salmon and scallop tartar served with seaweed...  supposedly part of the 'secret menu'\\nSoft Shell Crab...\\nThe size of the crab was nice served with ponzu sauce. Perfectly deep fried and seasoned with spicy Japanese chili pepper.\\n\\nAs you can tell I've been here quite a few times... Charcoal's menu has a lot of variety and is reasonably priced, resto is clean and well maintained, centrally located and easily accessible (even by transit)... food is decent and definitely I would rather come here over places like Sushi Town any day.

It didn't seem too packed from the outside but the inside was a totally different story.  We were impressed when we walked in to see the fully stocked bar that towered to the celling.  Our wait wasn't long as originally we asked to sit outside.  However after a short battle with the mosquitoes we opted to head back into the dining area.\\n\\nIt didn't take long to get us seated again.  Our drink orders were taken promptly.  I believe the young lady that helped us was Sandra.  She was very attentive and professional.  We ordered the honey butter croissants, calamari, and oyster shooters as an appetizer.  The croissants melted in your mouth and were even better than California Dreaming.  I didn't have the calamari but I was told that is was very bland.  However the highlight of the appetizers for me were the oyster shooters.  They were raw oysters in a shot glass with pepper vodka, and cocktail sauce served with crackers and lemon.  DELICIOUS!  The oysters were fresh and the taste was outstanding.   Surprisingly my mother's fiance' and sister even tried the shooters and loved them.  It was a shock for us because they're visual eaters.  Sandra was nice enough to bring a nonalcoholic one for my little sister to try.\\n\\nNow, we moved on to the entrees.  I had the chopped barbecue beef rib sandwich, my mother, sister, and mother's fiance' had the beef ribs and my significant other and son had the southwestern pasta.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the food except for my mother.  The ribs were undercooked for her taste however after sending them back she was told they weren't able to cook them any longer without drying them out.  She just ate her baked potato after declining another entree.  The manager was very accommodating and you can tell customer satisfaction is of great importance to them.  The southwestern pasta was ok.  Nothing to really write home about but edible and a huge serving.  My sandwich was pretty good but I couldn't eat a lot after the appetizers.\\n We asked if they do anything to celebrate birthdays and the manager stated they didn't.  But at the end of the meal she gave my mother (for her messed up meal) a choice of desserts and my mother's fiance' a dessert for his birthday.

We visited May 28 and had a late lunch with our great nieces. We have always loved Tibby's and we have our favorites-but this time we tried some new things.  First of all , our server, Jon, was amazing.  I think he is a poet in real life-the way he described some different dishes we asked about was lyrical.  I ended up having his favorite-\\"WHO-DAT\\" CAJUN BLACKENED CHICKEN and he said he would have them make it like he likes it.  The grit cakes were fantastic, extra crispy and on the side which I LOVED.  This way when I took some home, the grit cake did not get soggy.  I loved this dish-the sauce was filled with flavor.  Marty had the shrimp and grits and said it was very good. I do not remember what the nieces had but I do know we all devoured the beignets. I told Jon I did not like when they were overcooked and he said he'd look out for me-he did. We have never had a bad meal here and have loved the food each time.  I am thankful for Jon's recommendation to venture out to new things.  I will say that Jon was the most entertaining, delightful, and caring server we have ever had at Tibby's.

We dined inside, as the dog days were in full effect, but the intimate indoor setting balances out the loss of the patio. Red brick walls and elegant glass art pieces back the booths and tables, and warm lighting bounces against mirrors and spills over hardwood floors. It evokes a certain rustic polish, made more authentic with your first bite of crusty house bread.\\n\\nThey serve this delicious bread partially sliced, with a cup of olive oil and a little tomato paste. The crust has a chewy crunch, and it's sweetly soft enough to stretch as you pull it apart - it's always a highlight for me, no matter the meal. Our waitress was fast, friendly, and delivered absolutely first-class customer service throughout our long lunch, including replenishing our bread basket twice (a big bonus in my book!).\\n\\nWe opted to start with the \\"Barcelona Tapas Seleccion\\", which turned out to be a perfect sampling of Spanish inspired appetizers for two. Our \\"marinated salads\\" included mouth-watering sauteed mushrooms, a refreshing chopped cucumber and tomato salad, and unfortunately a blend of oily artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers that I suspect came straight from a jar. An assortment of spanish olives favored the green variety, and a few contained pits, but they were wonderful. The hummus was surprisingly tasty as well, and the grilled flatbreads served alongside were perfectly crunchy and covered in smoky paprika. But hands down, the high point was the red potato salad - starchy cubes topped with subtle prosciutto, tart pickled onions, and tangy creme fraiche... cold meat and potatoes never tasted so good!\\n\\nHe decided to try the daily special, a fried green tomato BLT with a side of french fries, because he loved the one I'd made at home for him a week before.

I ordered off of their \\"Lunch del Dia\\" menu, an intriguing inexpensive lunch option offering three courses for only $10. My starter salad consisted of spinach, strawberries, creamy chunks of goat cheese, and a citrusy vinaigrette dressing adeptly applied. The side salad of cucumber, tomato, and onion was far too sweet for my tastes, and my crab cake sandwich lacked impact, but overall it was an impressive variety and value.\\n\\nAfter all that, we were satisfied and bordering on stuffed, but what's a birthday without a dessert? I asked for cappuccino and he ordered an espresso, while he scanned the menu and eventually settled on a chocolate bar.

They focus on locally-sourced ingredients, and in our case, apologized for obtaining some of them from outside of New England!  We quickly forgave... Waitstaff provide all the information needed to understand the meals, and the kitchen kept sending out little tasting dishes throughout the meal, keeping up a very nice unbroken pace from start to finish.  The seaweed bread, interesting and very delicious, was one of three types that were served as often as we asked.  The portions, a bit smallish, displayed a creativity and wide assortment of ingredients that at times became confusing due to the tiny portions of each that appeared on the plate.  Overall, though, one can't go wrong with any of the menu dishes, as they all have a delicious story to tell to the mind and the palate.

I had the buffet.  The food was just ok.   I am not much of a salad person,  so I did not try that.   But,  I did have most of the hot items.  Pretty basic selections.  I did like the cheese ravioli,  meat linguini, and some kind of shredded chicken dish.  They had potatoes,  onion rings,  mixed veggies,  sweet plantains,  Yuka,  and a few other not so impressive items.  The chicken soup tasted like it was out of a can.   The part I was really looking forward to was the steak.   I was sadly dissapointed.   If you do the buffet you only get very dry sausage (absolutely  no flavor),  ok chicken and 1 kind of steak that is hard to cut and does not have a good flavor. I have better steak at Golden Corral.  They did say they had ribs but I never saw them.   You have to wait for someone to show at an empty counter to bring the meat from the kitchen.  I like medium and the 2 times I went up,  they only had well done. I had to wait 10 Minutes the first time.   The second they went back and brought out why I wanted.  I really went up 3 times,  they just did not come out the first.  That being said,  the service was excellent!  Our server was very attentive and very friendly.

We also shared the prosciutto breakfast sandwich in focaccia. Not as flavorful as I would've liked it to be and I had to take one side of the bread off to taste the meat and cheese inside.

The slaw had a great crunch and vinegary bite - super refreshing. As for the lobster roll - the bun was buttery and nicely toasted on both sides (as it should be) and there was just a minimal amount of dressing on the lobster which I appreciated a lot. I'm glad that they neither over-seasoned nor over-dressed the lobster meat and I got some decent sized chunks in mine.

That being said, some of the best food comes out of run down hole in the wall restaurants, who focus on food over decor, so I remained optimistic that the food would be outstanding. We ordered the lox eggs Benedict and Love Migas. After 45 minutes the lox eggs Benedict arrived completely cold, as though it had been sitting for a while. 15 minutes later the Love Migas arrived. It was decent, and at least arrived warm, however it lacked the spice and flavor the menu described. The orange juice was super syrupy, as though from a fountain and the coffee luke warm.

We were advised that the only menu for the evening would be their $38.00 special New Year's celebration menu. \\nWhen we arrived there was only two tables occupied. We were sat at a high top which brought mild resistance when we requested a flat table instead. Get the picture now- this place is all but empty. The hostess is telling us all tables are reserved. Duh, we had reservations also and were spot on time for our reserved time! Turns out the one flat top table with no \\"RESERVED\\" sign's party was not to come till 7:40 pm? Hell folks, its only 5:40 ! At least they did accommodate with some persistence.\\n\\nI started out with Chilled Seafood Salad w/ Focaccia Toast points. I was happy to  see the greens were of the \\"specialty weeds\\" category and not iceberg lettuce. The Focaccia stole my attention. The seafood for me, flat in flavors. No citrus notes, no, nothing special.\\n\\nMy complimentary champagne was passed over to a dining companion. I prefer more on the than dry side. (restaurants can't win some times)  The water comes to the table with a slice of cucumber, which I do like,  but again, not all at our table. \\n\\nI may have had ambitious expectations for the Lobster Bisque. Oddly, the Gruyere Cheese Crustini was the highlight for this course! My one special noted request was to be certain the soup comes out HOT. Damn. NOT.\\n\\nWe were then brought a sorbet which is always an unexpected delight.\\n\\nTook a detour into the men's room.  (Calm down now! This is not going to be Too Much Info ) -  I had to chuckle. \\nThere are three picture frames on the wall - but with no pictures. Okay, I was entertained so because I was feeling silly perhaps? Till I turned toward the porcelain fixture. Now this just struck me as odd; that a priority couldn't be made to do something, anything, other than allow the water tank to sit there \\"topless\\" in the wide open? For their \\"Celebration\\" evening, you know? \\nWell turns out, it was a good thing because the handle - wouldn't get the job done. Had to grasp the lever inside the tank and pull the stopper up to complete the \\"task\\" in this area.  Sorry, but this whole experience rated a 1st rate \\"peculiar\\".\\n\\nBack to my table and a high top table aside from us was being served a full rack of BBQ ribs. WTF?? Weren't we told only the special menu was being served this evening? Oh well, I was here for the steak any way,  but one of my dining companions truly has a legitimate gripe on that BS! (guess you can't win in the food service biz - trying to make everyone happy - even when breaking your own rules. Tisk-tisk!)\\n\\nThird course was the Prime Blackened Delmonico! This was a wonderful med-rare piece of well marbled meat and so worth all the oddities and minor upsets and let downs experienced to this point. Though the steak was not \\"blackened\\" in the least - the grill chef did ring all the bells on this one. The cream spinach was wonderfully creamy and \\"de-lish\\" but the Spaghetti Squash (they called it: \\"patty pan squash?\\") was pretty cold.  F-It. Not to worry- this truly PRIME cut 15 oz.  steak and creamed spinach had my total focus, along with a couple of bites of the Guinness Infused Short Ribs and scalloped potatoes next to me -Hell, I was finally in \\"celebrating 2012 calories mode\\" .\\n\\nTo finish up I had the pear tart with ice cream. I can't recall the last time I have had \\"pastry\\" of this sort,  so this was an over welcomed sin to fulfill to it's fullest. Pretty good for a finisher.\\n\\nTo try and sum this place up I'd respectfully say they are coming along, not quite there yet. The wait staff was ample for their small totaled out dining room. All four (or five ?) employees were helpful and good natured. Now one server allowed a strawberry to roll off the salad plate and onto the table (eauuuu!!) and we guessed he simply did not know better to even offer to bring a replacement. \\n\\nNow what is going here? The bill had a generous 20% gratuity added to it which is rarely a good idea IMHO- especially with a party of ONLY FOUR!!?? And this generous donation was not noted on the \\"special menu\\" , so it was a total surprise.  Just sloppy etiquette IMHO.\\nI still added a few more bucks in spite of the bitterness that additional surprise added to the experience cause they worked so diligently. The dining room staff worked hard. \\n\\nThe kitchen staff... what was going on in there? Food out of the kitchen took way too long  between courses in the opinions in our party. Come on, the menu has been set for over a week I bet - so no preparation surprises there, except for the one full rack of BBQ ribs! We ended up ordering bread for the table (surprise!)  just to munch on, which by the time it came out- duh, was not needed.\\n\\nFunny how it was 7:35 when we got up to leave.

For anyone who has ever had a New England lobster or seafood roll, you'd know that it's served on a hot dog or frankfurter bun and that half of that is well... Half!\\n\\nThe Taste of Maine comes with a choice of chips or cole slaw. I opted for the cole slaw. It was a bit weak for my liking, but it was livened up with a bit of sriracha which was conveniently located next to the salt and pepper on the table. \\n\\nAs far as the price, I do agree that it has to do with the fact that the seafood served here is sustainable and traceable, and if that's important to you, then you'll be willing to pay a little extra.

My fiance and I love the place; last time we took the Fung Wah from NYC (NEVER AGAIN!), we got right out of South Station on a cold Saturday night and went right over to Pho Pasteur. The other restaurants with this name (though most, I think, are now \\"Le's Kitchen\\") were related; I think the founder's son took over most of the franchise, and wrecked it (they're still good, but not as good as the original, which is actually the second Chinatown location, as the original had been across the street in the early 90s, but I digress).

They wandered the streets with flashy clothes on with those wanting their services searching back roads and parks for something often obtainable at home.  They catered to the desperate, to the spontaneous, and often you walked away regretting the money spent.  In the past few years, several excellent chefs have adopted the food truck method of gastronomic delivery in an attempt to create a new phenomenon.  They succeeded, and gourmet food trucks spread quickly to nearly every city in North America.  Whether it be sports, concerts, or fairs, like cheap beer and annoying fans, you'd be sure to find them.  Now these street-walking allegories have turned into to full Marvel cinematic superheroes.  Television programs have venerated these entrepreneurs, many of them former head chefs in high-profile establishments that fell on hard times after the recent financial crisis.  Now my hometown (one that often ignores the few food trucks we already have) has received several well-known national mobile canteens, a high point of our Canada Winter Games.  I sampled three such trucks on my first outing but decided to focus mostly on one, the Dougie Dog Diner Truck, manned by none other than Dougie Luv himself.  \\n\\nWait...seriously, that's his name?  Okay, I'll roll with.  GET IT?  Roll...with...the...food truck...\\n\\n... \\n\\n...\\n\\n...\\n\\nAnyways, we waited in line for about fifteen minutes before the boisterous Luv greeted us.  Right from initial views the dogs looked great, but let's be honest here, they weren't cheap.  At $10 a dog, with no side, seat, or beverage, you can score a bigger meal for less at a dozen locations within a five-minute walk.  \\n\\nOn the digital distribution platform Steam, games are sold at full price despite no physical production costs.  This occurs because the company believes customers will pay more for the convenience of not traveling.  With food trucks, they do the same.  Yes, you can get a dog for better value and (let's call it arguably) equal flavor at Costco (seriously, Costco dogs are amazing), but those are WAY over there.  Is it worth hunting down Dougie Dog's Diner Truck?\\n\\nI think so, yes.  I mean, I enjoyed the hell out that hot dog, and Dougie Luv has an authentically electric personality.  I love food trucks.  Have you see the movie Chef--it's fantastic, buy or rent it right now.  But I won't be a blind shill for the chic trend this is.  There's no denying that you're paying more for something because of a momentary indulgence.  The hot dogs are good.  If I lived in a town that fostered these businesses, I would cajole everyone I met to patronize them.  However, I'd be more interested in the true gastronomy served truck-side, the ethnic food, the haute cuisine, the stuff you can't find or make at home easily.  \\n\\nI get the appeal.  I understand the fanatical adoration.  I even appreciate the business acumen.  I just have to acknowledge the truth of the matter:  It's $10 for a hot dog.  They even have one for $100, and you know what, if I had the spare scratch, I'd probably buy one...just for the sake of having done so.  Is that wise?  Obviously not.  It would just be a momentary indulgence....and afterward I'd probably want to have a shower."},{"name":"Dogs On Wheels","address":"","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I've watched their sign go up and down almost every day (except on Monday & Tuesday when they're closed) for the past few months and I finally walked down last week to check them out. I was craving a cupcake and a hotdog, so lucky for me one of the two was within stumbling distance.\\n\\nThey have a cute set-up and everything is retro themed. I met Honey, the owner, and she was really cool and told me about why she started her business. I ordered the $4.99 lunch special, which is two hot dogs, chips, and a drink. I added onions to both, so it came to $6.50, which is still pretty cheap for lunch.\\n\\nShe grills the hot dogs as they're ordered and glass bottle Coca-Cola is served as part of the throwback motif (I LOVE Coke in a cold glass bottle). My only complaint was that they weren't very thick, but Honey explained that she uses a particular brand that is popular in New York. In the end I was convinced that I actually didn't want a meatier dog and that these were better. Also, she makes a special caramelized onion sauce that's really good.\\n\\nShout out to the Atlanta Street Food Coalition! Dogs on Wheels is a member, so you know they prepare and serve food with very high standards.\\n\\nOh, and they even have special dog treats.

Maybe we went on an off night but after reading some of the bad reviews, it seems like we weren't alone in our reasoning. \\n\\nPros: the place is adorable. Loved the atrium and how it was tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Park Ave. \\n\\nFood was ok. Nothing to write home about but no big complaints. The bacon and lobster dish was super fishy though. Lobster isn't supposed to be fishy.. My crab cakes were ok... The flatbreads looked delicious though and I really wished I would have gotten one.\\n\\nCons: the service. We timed it. 20 min (yes, 20 min) from the time we were seated to be greeted. Seriously? Luckily there was about 8 of us and we all were chatting and catching up so it wasn't a huge deal. \\n\\nFrom that point on we saw our server very sporadically. Now, yes, it was a Saturday but they weren't busy at all. Waters barely refilled unless asked, and she never came to check on drinks unless we caught her attention. (We're drinkers, and would have had quite a few if we had actually gotten to order them) A few of my friends got there with time to spare for happy hour drink prices. This included a few liquor drinks and a glass of Cabernet all ordered at the same time. My friend with the cab didn't get happy hour pricing where the others did and our server's excuse was that the happy hour wine went on someone else's tab.. Which it clearly did not. Just be honest and say you forgot to put it in or put it in too late. No big deal but making excuses and blaming it on something that we know for a fact isn't the truth is just dumb. She then went to offer my friend \\"$3 out of her personal money to make up for it\\" which my friend of course declined. At that point it wasn't about the price, just the fact that the server was trying to defend her terrible service. We have all been in the service industry at some point, and are super easy because we understand the things that happen sometimes. This was unacceptable. \\n\\nThe worst part is that she added a 20% auto grat to our tab. It was like she did that before we even ordered because we were a big party just so she could give us bare minimum service.

On further inspection of the drink book after we ordered a drink we saw it said happy hour was from 4-7 and 10-close which our waitress said was 7-10. We also asked about the wings deal to see if it was offered on any amount of wings and our waitress said she would go check but when she came back she gave us the wrong information that was contrary to what we saw online. She rectified the drink and gave us the happy hour price, however we decided to order online instead to get the deal. We accidentally chose a Buffalo Wild Wings down the street which ended up having much better service, was cheaper, and was only a mile away. These two locations are super close, but because one is next to the orlando eye, all the food is up-charged for tourists.

How could we not be pleased - I haven't had the sticky sweet taste of maduros in over 2 years, so when the first side order came and it was a bit on the small side, we immediately asked for another order, and we were good.  Tostones were excellent too, and I was pleased that they had both the rice w/the bean sauce on the side, and the rice w/the pigeon peas, so I went ahead and had both.  Hubby ordered the permil, which he felt was pretty good, but a little dry for his taste.  Overall though, no complaints, and we will be back!\\n\\nA quick note on the pricing - we felt the pricing was very fair, and while the sides may seem like they are a wee bit overpriced, there is more than enough food to fill you up, and our bill was still much lower than what we would have paid for similar quantities of food elsewhere.

Basically, I judge all Vietnamese restaurants off of their lemongrass chicken. Unfair? Yes. But I just love lemongrass chicken THAT much... what else can I say?\\n\\nThe dish was unlike any other lemongrass chicken I have had before - there were bulky veggies saut√©ed with the chicken. I didn't mind since I was starving but it wasn't really something that I particularly enjoyed. The sauce was a bit sour and spicy... good but not great. The chicken pieces were also pretty thin and chewy; not tender or juicy.\\n\\nThe prices are cheap here so if you're looking for a filling meal that won't break your wallet, Pho Pasteur is a good place to go. I should have tried one of my favorite drinks - Vietnamese iced coffee but it was chilly out and I didn't want to hold our party up. Also, I saw a lady drinking what I believe was a Thai milk tea with boba.

It was featured on Man vs. Food and it has been around for ages and there is a definite reason for that.  First of all, the restaurant has nothing but character.  Seated in the lovely German Village, Thurman is in a lovely old building covered with momentos of our wonderful city and the many patrons of the restaurant.  Some of the servers have worked there for years.  In fact, some cocktails are named for employees and can only be ordered on the days those employees are working - that's pretty cool!\\n\\nThe food is insanely good!  Talk about bang for your buck.  You'll see in my photos that the burgers and sandwiches are HUGE.  They're so good, too!  The menu is a little overwhelming because there is just too much to choose from.  I usually eat half of my meal there and take the rest to enjoy later.  And there is NO WAY I could ever eat a Thurminator in one setting.  That sandwich is a spectacle to behold.\\n\\nAnyway, if you are a first timer in Columbus, you need to check out Thurman's because it is seriously an icon.  The reason I don't go there often is it is so popular that you often have to wait for what feels like forever to get a table and the service is often mediocre and slow.

The Belini was a fresh, cheeky libation that would really cool ya off in the hot summer heat if there was any that is...I digress...Cactus Club again wins me over with their gently deep-fried scrumpdillyious Calamari appy adorned with hot jalepenos and peppers bursting with the woody notes of the oak barrel they were fermented in... lip smackin' indeed! \\nThe Calamari expoded with the subtle taste of the sea lightly breaded and fried just until crispy then served hot and fresh. Love it, eat it every visit. It's garnished with fresh, creamy dill dip that works so well with this appy. The Chipotle dip was so-so, unmemorable, more of a nuisance than an enhancement for me. \\n\\nSecond appy was the Louisiana wings. Fried to perfection then just enough  mouth watering Lousiana sauce to create some heat to accompany the tender yet crispy wings flavour. \\n\\nShort ribs were made for sandwiches weren't they? They were served on a long bun with a Ceasar salad that was decent but lacked the creamy salty dressing we all love. We had to ask for extra dressing which was swiftly brought to our table, with a smile and apology,..no big whoop.\\n\\nThe Blackened Creole chicken was on the mark and served with still crunchy, earthy Asparagus nestled on a fluffy, satisfying pillow of mash. The compound cajun/creole butter didn't quite speak to the flavours which it was supposed to lend itself to and was merely an after thought left behind to contemplate it's worthiness....

I felt bad for the butter, It was trying so hard to help, but alas, realizing it was really just butter with spices, it receded within itself and retired, alone and broken hearted... Tsk,tsk... \\n\\nJoyce 's service was  genuinely sweet, casual and attentive. At no point did we feel rushed even though the patrons were in wait mode for a table as the Cactus club was packed to the rustic yet trendy rafters.

Thick, rich cream cheese-like custard filling topped with natural unsweetened whipped cream. A perfect finish to an entree with lotsa heat and spicy flavours. \\n\\nCC's  modern classic atmosphere should appeal to all from teens to boomers with just enough decor to keep it interestingly balanced by ambient noise allowing an intimate social visit over good food... a genuine fun night out with west coast fusion fare and a warm inviting restaurant to host, you should go.... not cheap, but better value, consistency and a more appealing menu than it's competitors across the street.

They have a wide selection of ribs and other barbeque items and the portion are a pretty good side.  \\n\\nWe started off with a half dozen oysters which were surprisingly good considering Redbones isn't a seafood place.  If I did a blind taste test I wouldn't have guessed the oysters came from a rib place.  We also got an order of corn fritters which were good but more like dessert.  With the maple syrup, they reminded me of pancakes.  \\n\\nIn terms of entrees, my husband ordered the Barbeque Belt which has a sampling of several different types of ribs (Memphis, Texas, and Arkansas ribs and sliced brisket...he ordered beans and potato salad as his sides).  I ordered a half rack of baby back ribs with collard greens and mac and cheese as my sides.  Overall, the Texas ribs (beef) were our favorite.  They had a nice smokey flavor and the meat was not dry at all.  The rest of the ribs were all decent (not as tender or as juicy as I like).  Something to know about their ribs is that they are dry ribs that come with different sauces.  Even my baby back ribs did not come with a barbeque sauce already on it.  This wasn't a problem for me and I enjoyed trying different sauces.  My husband and I both agreed that the brisket left a lot to be desired.  Although it was tender, we found it to be very dry and needed to drench it in sauce to eat it.  I've had much better brisket at places like Village Smokehouse in Brookline and Blue Ribbon in Newton and Arlington.\\n\\nThe thing that will probably keep us from being more frequent patrons is the price.  Redbones is very pricey for what it is and I am always a bit shocked by the bill at the end of the night.  I think the two other rib places I mentioned above are a better deal and overall higher quality."},{"name":"Golden Eagle","address":"904 Memorial Dr SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great outdoor space!

Several weeks ago I bought tickets for the Valentines event last night. I spent over $200 between two dinner tickets and a bottle of champagne. Last night we arrived at 8pm which was our scheduled and ticketed time. There was mass pandemonium going on. The two hostesses were running around and basically told me they \\"we're trying to get the 5pm group\\" out of there. The faces on the 5pm crowd looked very upset. It seemed they were waiting for their checks for a very long time. We stood for about 30 minutes. Then finally a hostess gave us drink menus and asked us to sit on the couch to pick a drink. Thirty more minutes later and still no drink or return of the hostess. About ten minutes later they say us at a table. We then sat at the table for another 15 minutes before anyone approached. I then reminded them I pre bought a bottle of champagne. They brought it out finally and I asked to see the menu to which I was told they were missing. At this point I realized none of them were ready for this ticketed event. They didn't even have enough menus which is strange since they only sold so many tickets for each seating. Basically then we waited to receive one menu after someone else already ordered and we put in our order as quick as possible. After it took another 20 minutes for the first course to arrive we got up and left the restaurant. I felt that I paid way too much money to have to deal with such disorganization.

Even the onions and peppers were still raw. No meat juices or nothing at bottom of the container. So I go back in and get ignored a few minutes from the bartender that actually just finished giving me my order (he saw me) just knew I can back to complain and was avoiding me. I asked the hostess to call the manager \\"Jerry\\" for me. He took back the fajitas and reheated them (maybe in the microwave) but now my other food is cold! What's the purpose of ordering out?

He then became incredibly rude, acting  as if I was talking to a wall, ignoring anything I was saying and got a harsh glare in his eyes ....which then made it even MORE uncomfortable.  To  desperately get out of the awkward hell I was in, I finally told him that I was a counselor and, at this point, just hoped he was okay. He then rudely said \\"may I take your order\\".

Yes, it's amazing but if I'm paying 8-10 dollars for a breakfast sandwich, I better have a delightful atmosphere to enjoy it in.  And I'm afraid, at this time, this place doesn't have that.

I really wanted to like it. The atmosphere is pretty nice, though I didn't sit in the bar area I liked how it was set up with the liquor bottles stacked high to the ceiling. Parking can be a little tight but there wasn't much of a wait when we were there. Though we had reservations either way. It was a sunny afternoon so sitting outside was my first thought. We were led to a table right away. The place was pretty busy for a Tuesday around 6:30 but not overwhelmingly so. All in all I was ready to dig in and see what the food was all about. \\n\\nWe were greeted by a server pretty much right away. Drinks were delivered promptly and he was very friendly. Sadly, service throughout the meal seemed to steadily decline as we saw less and less of him. Not sure if it was because we were on the patio and he had more going on inside or what. All in all not a terrible experience service wise but definitely could have been better. I consider myself to be exceptionally patient, so when I get to a point where I have to ask another server to find mine, I'm not too thrilled. But anyway, moving on. \\n\\nI'm a prime rib guy so as soon as I saw it on the menu it was over. We grabbed one each with Caesar salads and the corned beef potato salad. Oh and calamari as an appetizer. \\n\\nBland. This is all I can say about anything that arrived to the table. The calamari was unseasoned, had zero flavor, also came with no lemon which I thought odd. Plenty of places have a hard time getting this dish right so I wasn't too surprised but we worked it out with a little lemon, salt, and pepper. My big disappointment was the prime rib. This is something that for the price should be done fairly well. It was cooked medium as we'd asked but lacked any flavor. It didn't even look very appetizing when it arrived. Longhorn has a better PR, which kind of surprised me. I'd been on a hunt for a decent prime rib in the Atlanta area and this definitely wasn't it. \\n\\nSo in the end, my experience says don't go back here. And I most likely won't.

It was very good.\\n\\nAfter the food runner dropped off the main courses our waiter immediately came to ask how everything was. Since we hadn't even cut into our food yet I replied it looked very good. However, upon biting into my food (which was very delicious) I discovered that it was barely luke warm. \\n\\nI had the lobster tail and sirloin and both were on the cold side. I didn't let that stop me from eating and enjoying the meal and the waiter did not come back to our table again until I had finished every morsel.

Although I attended college a half hour away, I found myself on High Street very often. This was one of my go-to spots, usually late at night. The food wasn't particularly memorable, but the experiences always were. Many good conversations happened here. Lives crossed paths and created connections. Dates occurred. One night when I was feeling sad, someone at the door noticed and tried to cheer me up. Another time, after a friend of mine complimented the waitress' bird necklace; the waitress took her necklace off and gave it to my friend, just like that.

Plain but delicious because it's breakfast food and breakfast is always good. I also got a banana w/ peanut butter sandwich with my croissant last time to stuff my face and it was simple and tasty as well. I think that's what they do well here.

However what I can review is the fact that the bar was NOWHERE near capacity, and yet the bouncer had people waiting out in the cold, letting girls come in who BRIBED their way in (physically handing him money), and then he talked shit at people in the crowd. Whatever, a wait in a line that is longer than most superior venues for drinking and dancing; it's not the worst thing in the world. However, this is the only nightlife location I have EVER been to in this state, this country, or the other countries I've visited, is another line right after that which moves even SLOWER! to get into the downstairs dancing area (the only reason I go out). If I wanted to wait in ludicrous lines all day that never moved all the way until closing then I would go to DisneyWorld.

Unfortunately I have to be honest and say that the service has progressively gotten worse with every experience.  For example in the beginning or honeymoon phase I didn't care that the service was a bit slow as the food and drinks were fairly priced and the food not too bad.  Then we had our first fight.  We ordered our food, waited about half hour and somehow received completely wrong meals. Then we waited another 20 minutes and they got it right.  The manager came over and said our meals would be on the house. We received our bill and they generously took off one dollar.  Wow we were so impressed.  The divorce came when we went as usual on a Wednesday where any burger (including lamb, tuna, bacon etc.) and an imported or domestic beer on tap are $14 dollars.  Don't get too excited though they changed their policy very recently.  Everyone at the table ordered a burger and a beer.  When we received our bills only those that ordered a basic burger or vegetarian burger had a bill for $14.  The rest had bills for over $20.  When I inquired to the manager he said that they changed the deal and we should have noticed on the menu.  We looked in the menu and it said Wednesday-burger and a beer for $14. He told us that this time he would take off the charge for the drink.  His attitude was actually pretty poor.  I was the opposite of impressed as you can tell by the stellar rating.   \\n\\nLastly I will mention that they have also recently changed the menu which means they increased the prices and mixed it up in the kitchen.  Sometimes you shouldn't change a good thing.  The tuna burger I ordered had a thick crust of rubbing seasoning that I had to scrape off as it was way too salty and all I could taste was celery seed.  Also, it was cold in the middle.

Perhaps it's because they use a lighter breading (maybe panko bread crumbs instead of batter?).  Chicken was juicy, sauce had a great taste and wasn't too spicy, and the fries had a nice touch of crushed seaweed sprinkled on top.  \\n\\nWe also ordered a $7 basic box with the Ponko Tenders and original Ponko sauce.

Once a month we get together for lunch at a burger joint around town and then rate it. May's \\"meat-up\\" was at Blue Star Cafeteria.\\n\\nWe had made an exception to our usual second Wednesday of the month meeting time to visit Blue Star on Tuesday for $6 Burgers. Not a bad deal. The only issue with this is nowhere on their website or in store do they specify that it only applies to their Star Burger (although on their website it does say six buck \\"burders\\" [yes i mean burders] all day). We assumed that anything on the menu under the listing of burgers would be available for $6. \\n\\nI ordered the Star Burger with cheese and bacon. It came out fairly quickly and it actually wasn't a bad burger. Not the greatest I've tasted but no bad. I did notice however, that there was no bacon on my burger. Not a big deal, as long as I didn't get charged for it later. It comes with lettuce, tomato, and onion on the side as most burgers do, and I was slightly disappointed that there were no pickles. A friend asked about it but they only have spears, no slices. There was a massive amount of lettuce (my roommate said I could have made a salad) and it wasn't all that great tasting so I ended up leaving it off. Onion and tomato tasted fresh and the cheese was a good addition. The meat was good but it definitely could have used some more salt and pepper and I did apply those generously. The fries were delicious. \\n\\nWhat really holds back Blue Star is the service. I'm not sure if it was our waiter specifically but refills were few and far between. Now going back to the whole $6 burger thing, when we got our bills, mine was $6 as anticipated with additional charges for the bacon and cheese. Since there wasn't bacon on my burger I politely asked that it be taken off my bill. Our server then took everyone's bill back (not just mine) and then returned a little bit later with the change reflected. Another member of our party then noticed that he had been charged for my soda and asked that it would be moved to my check. Yet another member, Clark, mentioned that it was $6 burgers all day and our server explained that it was only the Star Burger that was available at that price. Clark explained that on the website it did not specify that the special only applied to the Star Burger and even then, he had been charged for the Blue Burger (which he had ordered) but was charged $11.95 (full menu price) when the only difference between the Star Burger and the Blue Burger is the bleu cheese and bacon, available as add-ons to the Star Burger for $2.45 combined. Clark could have said he ordered the Star Burger with bleu cheese and bacon and been charged $8.45 rather than the full price. Clark's wife (who has previously written a glowing review on Yelp) had ordered the patty melt (which is under the burger portion of the menu) and she too was charged full price. All of us present agreed that Clark wasn't being particularly annoying in regards to the way he was going about things, simply stating what he had read on the website. Eventually the server begrudgingly took all our checks back (despite 3 of the 4 being correct at this point) and then proceeded to take another, no exageration, 15/20 minutes to get our correct bills to us. We all put our cards with our bills and it took him another 10 minutes to come over to our table to pick them up to run them and took another few minutes to return our checks to sign.\\n\\nI'm not normally someone who skimps on the tip because I know there are a lot of factors that go into the speed of the service but this particular server seemed to be intentionally ignoring us and moving slowly out of spite. I left enough tip to round up to the nearest dollar and left, with decent food in my belly, but a sour taste in my mouth."},{"name":"Lebowski's Grill","address":"8909 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place was amazing.

It also came with fresh cilantro, bean sprouts, peanuts, and thin rice noodle pieces. The meat was very well seasoned and tasted great. The fish sauce on the side complements the meal well.

They opened not too long ago and have already heard good things about this place. So.. I felt I should give it a try. We came at around 6:15 on a Saturday night and I have to say its not that busy. Maybe because its tucked in the small street and people don't know of its existence. \\n\\nI ordered the Chicken and Clam ramen (All my friends ordered the same thing). Options are limited like all ramen restaurants. There broth is unique because its made with clam and chicken. The traditional ramen soup is made out of pork. I got the ramen half and half with chicken and chashu. Not bad. I did find it was a bit salty. At the end, quite thirsty too. Broth thickness is half half. I have to say the chicken is very flavorful and you know they have marinated it before putting it in the soup.\\n\\nDecor is nice. Place is clean. Yes there is wifi here. There is one large tables and a few small tables and so seats are limited. \\n\\nIts competitor is around the corner and I can see that with them not being on a big street with lots of foot traffic would be a challenge.

The sauce is a little tangy and spicy and my favorite part is the garlic taste to it. The garlic noodles and street corn is a must try. When I finished the boil I dipped my noodles into the bootleg sauce and it definitely topped it off for me. The second time I went I ordered the garlic noodles in the bootleg sauce instead of just the regular garlic noodles, and I actually preferred the regular way more because there wasn't enough bootleg sauce. It was better to just get a boil and pour the remaining sauce into the noodles so it wasn't as dry and definitely more flavor. I also dip the garlic fries into the sauce and it's very tasty. The fries itself are very crispy and not overwhelming with the garlic flavor but just enough. The B.S. wings were a little too salty for my taste, probably won't get it again, but I'll definitely try their ribs on coke.  \\n\\nThey now have a \\"4 Play\\" menu (pretty much a happy hour type menu) which is available Monday to Thursday 4-7 PM and it is definitely worth it!

We came on a Saturday at 8pm and it was really packed but we still found a portion of a table, although it did require some hunting. Sadly BYOB is not allowed here, but there are beer and wine options at the counter and a bar inside the restaurant. Outdoor seating is a plus when the weather is nice. We had the San Gennaro which is always amazing, it includes sweet peppers and sausage. The dough was chewy on the inside and crispy outside, maybe slightly burnt for some people (IMO it's perfect that way). There's a little area with Parmesan, spicy peppers, and garlic.

I loved it so much, I would order these exact dishes again if I were here for dinner.\\n\\nNext time, I'm definitely going to try and grab brunch here.\\n\\nI highly recommend you bookmark this place and make it a must go!"},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Approaches the hype in quality, although the prices are kinda ridiculous.  I won't complain about the wait, because if you don't know about that at this point you deserve to suffer.\\n\\nOysters (local) lobster roll, and a few fried clams.  Fried clams were light and a bit uninteresting.  The Oysters were small and tasty, but for about $3.00 each, crazy.  (Best fish guy in East Cambridge sells oysters at $1.50 per retail.  So he's paying a buck each, Neptune may be paying less.  So they're markup is about 200%.  Gouging is gouging.) \\n\\nLobster roll was almost worth the outsized price of $29.  About a pound of meat, lightly dressed and served on a buttered rolll with fries.  Cole slaw would have been a nice touch, but wasn't available.\\n\\nFor a once a year event, okay.  But if you want a working man's roll at a better price without the wait, I'd send you to Yankee Lobster on Drydock.

I guess it's my fault for not specifying, but I kind of think it would be nice if they made sure your order came out right. I also asked for vermicelli on the side and got a plate of rice.

As someone who suffers from a serious condition called Edibles Indecisionosia (the inability to select an entree. there are dozens of us!), it makes for a slightly easier dining experience. Instead of being locked into a singular dish, I can branch out and try a few things that catch my eye. And then my mouth shortly after.\\n\\nAlas at Scratch, the problem is that I want everything. The entire menu is a mouthwatering montage of food. And while each plate is certainly a small bite, it does not come with a small price tag. Usually this kind of disconnect is annoying, but Scratch makes up for it through the sheer quality of their dishes. They are worth their price tags... but it's close.\\n\\nThe d√©cor of Scratch. Holy crap it's awesome. It's like tornado went through an apartment building occupied by a hipster, a hunter, a Chinese immigrant, a surrealist painter, and Morrissey. Except instead of it looking like a chaotic mess... somehow it all fits together into something cozy and intimate. don't know much about interior design, but I think because the place is mostly dark with only a hint of a sultry amber glow allows you to put up anything on the wall and it looks cool. Unfortunately I can't take this approach with my apartment without making myself seem like I want to be Eric Northman from True Blood. The music is equally random. At one point, we definitely heard the Ghostbusters theme song. \\n\\nAlright, food. Let's get this out of the way. If you've been reading reviews, you've probably seen the the pork belly adobo mentioned. I can confirm that it is divine. Midway through eating the small plate, I was in love. But it was followed by a terrible realization. Inevitably, it would be gone. I felt like the boyfriend of a girl who had joined the military and was going off to serve in The War. We are standing there by the bus, and I'm frightened by the though that this might be the last time I'll ever see her. Her caress is delicate, warm, and heartmelting. It brings a tear to my eye. And then she is gone. Yes, the plate is that good.\\n\\nBacking up a bit, we started with a kale salad. Simple, but effective. The dressing was light and delicious, and the greens were farm fresh. After the pork adobo mentioned above, we moved onto the salmon which was a seasonal dish. Yes, this was some of the best salmon I've ever had. Perfectly cooked and seasoned in a way that let the salmon shine on its own. Delectable. While the pork was my favorite dish, the salmon was my date's favorite dish.\\n\\nWe had a couple more small plates, but none topped those two. In addition to the plates, we tried a few of their craft cocktails. They're wine based, so you're not likely to get trashed on them, but they are tasty. I wish I could remember the names of them or what ingredients went into them. In fact, now that I think about it, I couldn't discern half of the words on the menu. That's not really a complaint, though. I suppose I'm just not that worldly yet. We asked the waiter on multiple occasions to help define... you know, what stuff is. I wasn't embarrassed.

I could sorta understand that mentality if you work at Burger King, but PSB is a good gig, in the sense that customers and the Portland food community holds it in high esteem, which means you're participating in something special. Even if you say it's all BS hype and the food isn't really good, you have to admit that from a career standpoint it looks better on a resume than Burger King, right? So why not show a little interest and make the best of it?\\nFOOD: \\nHam was WAY too salty, and tasted a bit off. Imagine a very old piece of ham that was going bad, and somebody decided to cover that up by salting the heck out of it. That's what this ham tasted like. It was actually so vile that my tongue recoiled in horror as soon as contact was made. I'm not exaggerating at all, as soon as I bit into my biscuit I knew something was wrong. Okay then, pull the ham out, eat the rest. Biscuit was kinda bready, like that refrigerated biscuit dough you can buy at the store. Edible, but not worth the calories. (Wow, that's the ultimate \\"first world problem\\", right?). Let's see, \\"biscuit\\" is in the restaurant's name, but they make a fair-to-middling biscuit? Hmm. Blueberry cornmeal pancakes were good. I'd go back for that. Don't worry, they're not overly corny. Apple butter was also good. \\nRegarding the nasty ham: I should disclose that my bad experience was quite some time ago. Maybe the problem was a fluke, or has been rectified. YMMV.  \\nPRICE/VALUE:\\nOkay, gotta admit the $6 pancakes were a steal. Other than that, about average. I saw some items that I thought were too high, but others were right about in line with other places, or occasionally slightly lower than I'd expect. \\nRESTROOMS: \\nSingle occupancy, just one, a bit too close to seating, so watch for that if you're tempted to sit around at the corner at the very end of the counter."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"131 Clarendon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Used to be my coffee and breakfast place on weekends.

We had carpaccio of beef that all four of us agreed was the best we have tasted in a long time.

Artichoke salads were unique and tasty . We all went with traditional Italian entrees. Veal on two, and pastas on the others. Everyone was thrilled with their choice. We dined about three hours and had a blast. My friends are absolutely sold on La Grotta, and felt like they were part of a special club..................Is the place a scene ?

I don't really understand this Boston phenomenon other than it's to be appreciated that you get to at least wait inside with such unforgiving winter weather. Frankly, it's the biggest waste of time.

He checked it out once with his bud and raved about it. Then, one morning on the Today show, we saw that it was named one of the ten best new restaurants in the county by some foodie magazine. With my gf knowing we were visiting months in advance, we made reservations (2-3 months in advance, keep in mind) for a table for 4 on a Friday night. I wasn't sure what to expect a place gets ton of hype; a lot of the times, it's a let down. Plus, on that same list Bondir was one, a local restaurant that is over-hyped made the list, so I was definitely skeptical. \\n\\nWe finally make it on our Friday night, in a torrential downpour. Immediately as we walked in, I notice this place is tiny. It's just a rectangular space, with about 7 or 8 tables on each side. From the looks of it, this place seems to be reservation only. We sit down and are greeted by a super friendly waiter. We decide to go with a few bottles of craft beer and 2 bottles of wine and after some deliberation, we decide to order the whole menu and split everything down the middle. You can either order a full portion or half portion. With our party, we decided to go mostly with half portion and we picked 2 or 3 of the heartier dishes for full portions. \\n\\nNow, I was a bad foodie that night. I definitely didn't write down or catalogue what we ate and since the menu is always changing, I doubt I can find out haha. We ended up having some pork shoulder, skate, berrata, duck, etc. and everything was outstanding. Each dish tasted like a million bucks and was executed perfectly. To top it off, each dish was explained by our waiter too, which was a nice touch. The chef even came out at the end of our meal to chat with us, which was really nice as well. \\n\\nI'm a figidity type of dude. After a few hours of sitting down at dinner, I'm usually itching to get up, but after a few hours of drinking good and eating good, I had no desire to get up!

Between my friend and I we devoured a seaweed salad, tuna rolls, avocado rolls, naruto and an ichiro combo complete with salad and miso soup.  No words can explain the utter contentment we both felt after this meal.

Rolling up, I feared I would be searching a while to park, yet luck was on my side as a spot opened across the street right as we arrived.\\n\\nLike a climber heading to a summit, I too ventured toward my destination.

Both reasonably priced, I had to control the purse strings greatly as the fried Oreos began to sing their siren song to my curiosity. Holding steadfast, we completed the order and waited a short time for the funnel cake's preparation. I delayed my gratification and asked the bacon to arrive at the same time. The wait only heightened the anticipation and was well worth doing so. \\n\\nOne the order was called out, it was show time. My daughter dug in, and a smile as big as Texas stretched across her face. Not having to wait for the rodeo our some other festival event to chow down on funnel cake is a dream.\\n\\nThen came the first bite off candy bacon. No word describes the feel entering that first bite, with the sweet and salty flavors excluding with each delicious crunch. Needless to say, when I saw 3 beautiful strips lying there, I knew that speed would have to take a back seat and the goal this night was to savor each delicious bite.\\n\\nI highly recommend this good park for those who have guests from out of town.

That's always nice. Then it went downhill. The hostess was sitting at her little desk with her face resting on her hand. That did not change during our brief interaction. Barely looking up, she asked if we had a reservation. I looked around. No one waiting and (apparently) plenty of empty tables in the main dining room. I was willing to wait, but she didn't let us know if that was even an option. She pushed the bar on us so off we went. Her face was still resting on her hand.\\n\\nThe bar was reasonably crowded for a Saturday night at 6pm with several open tables. On the other end of the room was an empty large stage for live music. We sat as far away from that as possible.\\n\\nThe guy who waited on us was awesome. He was the best part of the evening. We soon realized, though, the bar was a cacophony of cray. Bartenders yelling, the frantic and loud din thing, etc. I couldn't hear my wife talk. The ambiance was old school with mood lighting and stone walls. A suit of armor greets you when you walk in the door.\\n\\nLong story short, we each had the 10-ounce portion of prime rib. That was $28 each and salad was not included. It was a purchased upgrade. The meal came with Brussels sprouts and a \\"loaded\\" baked potato.\\n\\nWe thought the prime rib was average. Not excellent, but better than we've had at diners. It was served with an extremely weak sauce (we should have asked for horseradish) and an au jus.\\n\\nFor being \\"loaded,\\" the baked potato was very lightly dressed with perhaps one tablespoon of toppings: Butter, sour cream, and we're pretty sure imitation bacon bits. Loaded? Where are the chives? Only a few bites had toppings. The rest of that thing was bone dry.\\n\\nWe both liked our cocktails.\\n\\nOur server and another woman who waited on us were genuinely warm. The rest were limp fish.\\n\\nTo sum up, two 10-ounce prime ribs, two salads, and two cocktails, plus tip, and we were out a cool $100.

The tacos arrived modest and two soft corn tortilla-shelled - which was necessary considering how thin and flimsy the tortillas were.  However, given that I'm a weirdo with my carbs, I separated the tortillas and halved the innards, so basically I made myself four, that's right FOUR tacos.  To be honest, I think I wasn't very hungry after stuffing myself with chips, guac, and salsa, so I did this in order to convince my friend and myself that I had actually consumed two tacos.

You forget sometimes how beautiful Portland really is and there are few places which you can really see most of the city plus Hood and St Helens. We got there at 3:30 PM to secure a \\"rock star\\" booth before the beginning of Happy Hour at 4PM. Had a Grand Scratch margarita for $11.50 and it was quite good.\\n\\nFINALLY it was 4PM and we could order some food. ha ha We ordered the following small plates off of the happy hour menu:\\n\\nCaesar Salad $5.95 - It was pretty good but overdressed. I would order it again but get the dressing on the side. ****\\n\\nPortland City Grill Kung Pao Calamari $11.95 - This was an interesting dish and I liked the flavors. A little too much batter. The squid itself almost gets lost in this dish but it was very enjoyable. It's one of their signature dishes so definitely give it a try. ****\\n\\nCajun Jambalaya $7.95 - This was our least favorite dish although it tasted ok and came with 6 shrimp. The rice was mushy and was plated with a lot of liquid so it was more like congee than jambalaya. It was ok and others really like it but wouldn't order it again. ***\\n\\nCurry Fried Fish and Chips $7.95 - This was our favorite and a good value too. The fish was cooked perfectly. Honestly, I didn't think the curry added much. They used a very mild Indian style curry. Loved the waffle fries. We would definitely order again. *****\\n\\nPetite Mocha Iced Cake $4.95 - They provided this complementary since it was our anniversary and we loved it. ****\\n\\nService: Our wait person was excellent and very attentive. *****\\n\\nVenue: What can I say, it is spectacular. *****\\n\\nThis is a great place for Happy Hour, special occasion or \\"hot date\\". We dressed \\"business casual\\" since it was our anniversary but there were a lot people in shorts and tank tops. It's on our rotation for places we take out of town guests.

We left our number at the front desk and were told that we'd get a call when the table was ready. She said that there was only 1 party ahead of us on the waiting list. We hung around the area until 7pm, when we checked back in with the hostess. She assured us that the table was just about to leave and that we'd be seated shortly. She explained to us that there was only 1 table that could seat all of us together, so we'd be seated soon. \\n\\nAbout 45 minutes later, one of our party went in to use the restaurant and saw that a table of 7 was just getting their food. We didn't hear anything from  them for another 30 minutes, and we waited about 15 minutes to get that hostess's attention. We explained that we'd been waiting for 3 1/2 hours after we'd been told we'd be waiting for about 2 1/2 hours. We said we'd been told that there was only 1 group ahead of us and that we weren't sure why that would lead us to have a 3 1/2 hour wait. \\n\\nThe waitress was dismissive of our concerns and explained that these delays could happen when \\"1 party was 10 minutes late, and the next was 10 minutes behind that, and then the next one was 20 minutes late...\\" We pointed out that we'd been told that there was only 1 party ahead of us when we checked in, and we asked how this could be the case. She dismissed us again and said that it wasn't  their fault. She said that we would be contacted when the current 7-person party was leaving. \\n\\nThe hostess came to us about 5 minutes later to say that the party was asking for the check. We said that we'd decided to leave given the long wait, and the hostess cut us off. She said, \\"Yeah, yeah, okay,\\" and she held up one finger to us as she walked away without talking to us. We waited a few minutes more to see if she would return, and then we left the area. \\n\\nDespite the high quality reported in Yelp reviews, I couldn't discourage people from going here strongly enough. I was appalled at the lack of respect for their patrons. I understand that there can be significant waits for good food, but waiting for an additional hour (on top of an estimated 2 1/2 hour wait) without any communication or understanding from the front-of-house staff is just unacceptable."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Ugh I came here for the first time today and got the snow crab roll.

I found the crustaceans all pretty tasteless, which is generally my opinion of lobster, however, I was disappointed with the crab and shrimp as this has not been my experience in the past. Coleslaw definitely needed to be pickled longer and was very weak. Service was shockingly slow given that there were only 2 people ahead of me. 11 min seemed overkill.

I opted for the Caccio de Pepe half order with a side house salad and dining mate ordered the daily special, anchovy and lemon pasta. We also shared an order of 3 piece bruscetta each topped with a different spread.\\n\\nWith so many delicious vegetarian options, I wasn't sure if I ordered the right dish. I did. The Caccio de Pepe was peppery, oily, cheesy, and delicious with perfectly cooked noodles. I'd heard the side salad was great and OH MY GOD, it sure was. The garlic confit was awesome and the dressing... aaaah. I would definitely come back to get this eact combo. The half order was good for little ole me, but I think some people would probably end this meal a bit hungry.\\n\\nThe anchovy and lemon pasta was also wonderful. Salty, acidic, and exactly what my dining mate wanted- although he said it could use some meat. The noodles, like mine, were perfectly cooked.\\n\\nThe 3 piece bruscetta consisted of one garlic confit, one house made ricotta, and one.. peppery red thing? It was the best one but I have no clue what it was! All were delicious, though, and the bread was very soft unlike alot of bruscetta, which I LOVED.

I figured it may be to try and make them vegan, but that may be giving them too much credit.\\n\\nThe downside here is of course the wait, and what made it worse was seeing so many open tables while everyone was waiting outside for hours.

Upon entering, we found the place about half-full of customers, and it was very active throughout the course of our meal, with new people coming in, and others leaving.  Our first impression - \\"wow, looks like this is a popular place\\".  \\n\\nThe service was good, and despite how busy the two servers were kept, they were always friendly, and accommodating.  Even our several initial questions regarding some of the menu items, were answered without any  hesitation on their part - we felt welcomed, and thought they were being very helpful.  Now to the food, and 'wow', it was tasty!!  \\n\\nWhat we ordered:  and it came with a great selection of banchan - kimchi (sure good, but spicy hot!), pieces of potatoes (don't know how they were prepared, but were sure yummy!), slices of marinated zucchini, and bean sprouts (both yum!) - and tea.  The banchan was 'the' best we've been served at the Korean restaurants we've tried to date!!\\n\\n--  dol sot bibimbab - hot stone bowl rice, with ground beef, an assortment of fresh vegetables, sesame oil, egg, and hot pepper sauce on the side (with some tofu, hot sauce, etc.).    \\n-  ox knee soup - meat & tendon, green onion, and vermicelli noodles, in a  light stock, it came with rice (with a choice of stone bowl or regular steamed), and a side dish of a soya-based sauce.\\n\\nEverything (banchan, entrees, and side dishes of sauces) was so fresh, colourful, well-prepared and presented, and so tasty, and all was served piping-hot to our table.  We appreciated the mild level of spicing of what we ordered - with the hot sauces provided as side-dishes to the entrees, they could then be used as much as desired.  \\n\\nThis was our first taste of these particular dishes, and I believe we ordered well.  I had read much about bibimbab, now after seeing it in-person, and tasting it, can understand why it's such a popular Korean dish - I so enjoyed it!  The soup was good, but not a particular dish I would likely order again.  But for this dining, it seemed to complement the other dish.      \\n\\nJong Ga was a busy little place, but we never once felt rushed, in fact, we felt very relaxed, and took our time to fully-enjoy the meal and dining experience.  And we sure did!!  For us, Jong Ga will definitely be a 'must return to' place!!"},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Absolutely may be the best meal I've ever eaten, and i live in nyc.

It was incredible and the corned beef (in chunks) was, if not the best I've ever had, up there.  We also got a couple of the lemon ricotta pancakes, amazing.
