He leaves us to mull over the menu and wine list for 60 seconds and come back to get our order \\"what can I get you\\" well, a few more minutes would be nice. He came back 3 times in as many minutes. While ordering my father's wife asked if she could exchange her side dish for another \\"you can get whatever you want but'chu gotta pay for it.\\" Not that I was expecting a meal pro-Bono but Joey or Tony or whatever his name was could have rephrased this, I'm just saying.\\n\\nNot bad so far, a bit abrasive and unwelcoming sure but it wasn't until the food came and the server went to hand me my plate and spilled the sauce onto my dress and then walked away after I exclaimed \\"oh my god that just spilled onto my dress\\" and when they took my boyfriend's plate away from him while he was still eating (seriously, he had food in his hand to his mouth) that I was pretty much over the whole experience and wanted to get out of there sans tipping our meathead waiter.\\n\\nWhat bothers me the most is how much I wanted and still want to complain to the management about my now stained vintage 1950's dress and unkind treatment but feel that any business that encourages this type of attitude from their staff is not going to treat me any better.

Since that time back in 2005, I really feel like The Oasis has turned the corner from mediocre weekend spot to dependable gathering point for you and your friends.\\n\\nThe development of everything surrounding the restaurant has struggled financially. The restaurant has always stayed strong though. The developer had large plans to build a domain style shopping paradise. Uncle Billys used to be right next door. I wouldn't have called the BBQ there great enough for the drive though.\\n\\nNow it seems like everything is going well for the restaurant. The parking garage is in. The walkway was built a few years ago. They seem to have also repurposed the Uncle Billy's brewery area for their own 'Oasis brewery'.\\n\\nWe had a group of 15 people for a little friendly gathering. The Oasis doesn't do reservations, but you can call ahead and they really do their best to accommodate your party. We arrived at 7 on a busy Saturday evening. The line had about 75 people in it already. Like a machine, the staff worked through each group. There is a large bar on the 3rd level where everyone ends up drinking while they wait for a table. There is also live music on this level.\\n\\nOur group called ahead the day before and were given a wait time of about an hour to an hour and a half. We were initially disappointed, but then our buzzer started buzzing about 2 minutes later.

I took my husband a month ago for his birthday since I surprised him with a new set of golf clubs. I figured it would be a fun place to take him since I had went to a few corporate events at the tampa location and had a blast. Plus we wanted to have dinner and the food I have had there was amazing before so it was going to be a nice date night/ bday celebration. Boy was I wrong. Checking in was only good part of the experience. They guys at the desk were super nice. Got a bay very quickly and went through all the set up super quick. It was when it came to food and drinks that it was horrible. First off we were there 15 minutes playing before I flagged down the guy who set us up to ask if we had a server. He went and found a manager knowing how long we had been there. Manager comes and takes our order. Order flatbread and a specialty margarita. Let them know if hubby liked it he would order one. After that waiter finally comes by introduces himself and if we need anything else let him know. Well drink was dropped off by someone else hubby liked it so wanted another. Had to go to bar myself to order since server nowhere to be found. At this point I have missed most all of my hubby playing with new clubs because I spent the whole time looking for our server. He would look out way then go in the other door NEVER coming by our bay. At this point I am fuming. A second app we ordered when he introduced himself after the manager came. No flatbread in sight. By this time we only had about 10 min left in our game time. Then about 5 min later flatbread comes out....COLD. it had been sitting somewhere this whole time you couldn't even chew it. Guess what had to go hunt down server again. At this point my hubby is upset and I feel like crying because this was suppose to be his bday outing. I finally track down server and ask him for check as the flatbread isnt edible and I just want to leave. This takes a while as well. Comes back with check and apologizes the food wasn't good. Never that he was non existant. As much as we paid for the darn drinks and golf to just be aggravated the whole time was a let down. I'm surprised the manager never once came back to make sure everything was going smoothly after the rough patch at the beginning. On top of that they email you a survey almost as you are walking out the door. I waited till the next day to fill it out to calm down. Never once did I receive a so sorry for what happened or we will take your feedback and make sure it doesn't happen again. So now I'll leave this review since I am still not over how upset this made me especially since i was trying to make a fun outing for my already stressed out hubby. TAMPA location is way better.

The latke was thick and nicely made with a bit of a crunch to the outside, but ultimately I think the whole thing was too filling for me and I couldn't finish the whole thing. Maybe just too much potato for me. It also came with cut potatoes and 2 small slices of cantaloupe and a few grapes (a little disappointing for the 'fruit' they advertised. I was hoping for a little fruit salad or something). \\n\\nUltimately the food was solid with some innovation from your standard brunch fare, with a great wait staff (in my singular experience).

Whatever. \\nMy frustration level was growing... right when the bartender looks right at me and says that if i want to order a drink i need to do it from over there. and points back at where i had been standing earlier. \\nSo i push my way through the crowd to get back over to that section of the bar, wait another 2:18 (yes, i was counting) and the bartender comes over and asks what i want. \\nI wanted to say \\"Couldnt you have done that 2 minutes ago you dumb bitch!?\\" but instead i order my drinks like a good little customer. \\n\\nShe delivers my bloody mary and mimosa and lets me know that will be $15. \\nlol, at this point im going from annoyed to just plain amused. \\n\\nSo i take the drinks back over to where my GF had scored a seat and i take a drink of my mary when the GF says, \\"wow, you drank that much already?\\"\\nI look down and i am holding a pint glass FULL of tightly packed ice with some bloody mary in the crevasses. \\nI offer her a drink and in one pull the glass goes from half full to completely empty. \\n\\nThe rest of the experience was not much different and i am tired of typing. \\nThe food was ok, the prices were high, and the service was poor. \\n\\nI'll never go back and will go to Tasty and Sons next time i am in town.

For all dessert lovers out there, this place is a dream come true! The outrageousness of the Red Velvet Milkshake in particular captured my attention - who would ever consider combining a very filling milkshake with an ENTIRE regular sized cupcake PLUS whipped cream?!? Seriously, if diabetes was a meal, that'd be it right there.\\n\\nSo what did I order? The Red Velvet Milkshake of course! To be honest, I struggled a lot with the menu because of all the wonderful dessert options, AND this place was smart to include pictures of each specialty milkshake and sundae for visual decision makers, like myself. We came here to have dessert for lunch because we knew it'd take an empty stomach to even attempt to devour these beautiful, sweet treats. I was trying to decide between the Chocolate x5, Red Velvet, or Espresso Buzzzz milkshakes or the Brookies, Cookies & Cream sundae. In the end, with the help of my boyfriend (because I have Analysis Paralysis), the Red Velvet Milkshake won, because let's face it, I just had to try it for the simple fact that it looks so insane! This crazy but alluring milkshake tower consists of vanilla ice cream with chunks of red velvet cake and raspberry sauce in a mason jar, whipped cream with rainbow sprinkles wrapping around the rim of the jar, a red velvet cupcake on top of the milkshake, and a cherry plus a mini chocolate straw at the very top for $12. Has your A1C spiked yet??? I was informed that I could keep the jar after finishing my dessert. The problem was, this monster dessert is ridiculously challenging to complete!! The cupcake wasn't anything amazing. I would have been happily satisfied with just the milkshake, but then this dessert wouldn't have been as attractive. In my last few bites, I was beginning to feel nauseous from the sweetness overload. I probably would have enjoyed the chocolate options more, but then again, it's pretty awesome to be able to say I had this ridiculous dessert.\\n\\nMy boyfriend had the S'mores sundae. It was a marvelous dessert of chocolate ice cream, chocolate sauce, marshmallow cream, graham crackers, and jumbo marshmallow in the form of a giant s'more for $10.50. That marshmallow was nice and ooey gooey. The graham crackers seemed to form a fortress. The whole thing was delicious and was served in a lovely, wavy glass bowl that made me think of mermaids. My boyfriend was extremely full after he finished his dessert.\\n\\nThis place is like something that belongs in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It's really something to admire from both the inside and the outside. You are likely to be greeted by two staff members dressed as Penelope (the \\"creator\\" of the place) and a steampunk robot. There's no denying that the desserts/food are all expensive, but the desserts are worth trying at least once!"},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This restaurant is a must for brunch!

Once I informed my server, she quickly got it taken back to be cooked more. She also gave me more pretzel bread, which is incredible, by the way.

The whole bill was less than $30.\\n\\nAll of us were extremely happy with the meal. We each shared bites and I think particular winners for me were the chickpea fritters, the hummus salad, and the broccoli salad (suprisingly fiesty). My spouse loved the fritters and the german potato salad. My seitan BBQ tasted great but the texture could have been better - I've had seitan that was shredded or docked to give a more 'meat-like' feel. But that was a minor quibble - I ate all of it! \\n\\nAll the ingredients were fresh and well-prepared, and we got our food *very* fast (to be fair, there were just a few other people there).\\n\\nI would make a point of eating here again if (when) I am next in the Burlington mall area during meatime.

I had a HORRIBLE experience and the owners of this restaurant DO NOT care about customer service at all!!\\n\\nI came here with my boyfriend and his daughter for a nice meal because it was close to our house. It was a Thursday evening and there were only 3 other tables in the place, which should've been our first clue. The hostess who greeted us had greasy hair and a giant tattoo on her chest. Very unprofessional.\\n\\nWe sat down and were immediately greeted, which was probably the high point of our experience. We proceeded to order the spicy edamame to start with, and that's where things went downhill. \\n\\nFor our meal, the 3 of us each ordered a sushi roll (my boyfriend and his daughter each ordered a $6 roll off the happy hour menu, while I ordered a more expensive $10 roll off the regular menu). Should be easy, right? NOPE! First, our server brought out the wrong edamame. Instead of the spicy garlic that we ordered, we got the regular version. Second, my roll was completely boring and flavorless. The fish on top was fresh, I'll give it that, but it had no sesame seeds, no sauce, nothing besides fish, rice, and crab filling. That, alone, wouldn't be enough to make me give this place a bad review. It just added to it.\\n\\nThe problem REALLY started when two of us received our sushi rolls, but my boyfriend did not. \\"It'll be right out\\" was the first excuse. 10 minutes later? \\"We got a new inventory, so it'll just be a few more minutes.\\" New inventory? He ordered a Spicy Salmon Roll for goodness sakes! Another 5 minutes after that? Myself and my stepdaughter were both done and STILL no spicy salmon roll. \\"Oh they forgot. I'll have them make it now.\\" To which I replied, \\"you're going to comp this, right?\\" Well, after 5 more minutes (this is 20 minutes after the rest of the food was served) he came out and told us that he took the roll off our ticket. Naturally, I asked when he was going to bring the roll out so that my boyfriend could eat, to which we received a response of \\"if you don't pay for it, I cannot bring it to you.\\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!? YOU screwed up our order!! At that time, we asked for the manager. Another 5 minutes goes by before a lady, who looks like another server, walks up to us and apologizes. Here's the real kicker. She apologizes then proceeds to tell us that THE OWNER SAID THAT UNLESS WE PAY FOR THE ROLL WE CANNOT HAVE IT. This is 25 minutes after the rest of us received our food now. At that point, my boyfriend lost it. The \\"manager\\" then offered to pay out of her own pocket for the roll, which is what ended up happening. \\n\\nNeedless to say, he finally got his roll, 30 minutes later, and when we received our check there was $6 cash in there to cover the roll.\\n\\nSo basically, the owner lost business and receives an HORRIBLE review because of $6.

But once you know who cooks better to your taste, it is manageable, and my favorite dishes are best at Punjabi than most other restaurants in the Boston area, disregarding the price.

The first time we went here, we could not find the place immediately-- it is sort of tucked away.  The inside is typical of sushi places we have been to-- unassuming and simple.   I like it this way because it puts all of the focus on the food.   Whenever we go here, its like a trip to Japan.  The waitstaff is as authentic and genuine as the food.   We always order way too much-- I mean people usually turn to stare at us and when we notice them staring, they simply stare harder and longer.   Its impossible not to over-order.

It was pretty busy at 7pm, we had to wait for a table of 4, but not too long. The bar is cool and the location is awesome. The food was good, but very small plates. I know it's supposed to be for sharing, but for $11 I expect more than 2 tiny fish tacos each the size of my palm. Food and drinks were good, but I would not come back here for the following reasons:\\nAt 7pm the place was blaring with music at a level were talking to the members of your dinner party was impossible. We asked for the music to be lowered just a tiny bit but it never happened. Again if it were 9 or 10 pm on a Friday I would understand, but at 7pm with dinner rush, there really was no need. Another matter that was shocking for a place of this size and location you would think their washrooms would be taken care off. There were only two stalls in the ladies room, and one toilette was broken and filled to the brim with faeces. When I mentioned this to one of the waitresses, to at least put a sign up and lock that door, she said it will be taken care off. an hour later, the door is unmarked and open, the toilette bowl is still full of excrement and not flushing.

First, I want to say working with them on what I considered to be a minor item was actually rather nice as they were honestly interested in making my experience a better one.  I went back this Sunday with family and our food experience was much better.  Keep in mind this place is amazing...the atmosphere....the actors...the waiters....all of it is a ton of fun and the desserts are to die for.  We had the chocolate bread appetizer and it was so hard I couldn't cut it with a knife BUT once I broke it open with my hands I found the insides to be nice and warm and soft and with the butter it was VERY good.  My cousin ordered the Brussel sprouts for an appetizer and though it had an AMAZING taste the Brussel sprouts were undercooked so this is my only word of advice to the Chef....make sure things get fully cooked before you send them out!  It was not a big enough problem to complain as my attention was more on the main entree.  I ordered the Mac and cheese with shrimp and blue crab and it was delightful.  Perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  I was nervous going back as everyone knew I was there on a less than stellar yelp review and I thought it would be reflected in the service we were provided.  We were given kind of a bunk seat (kitchen view....keep in mind I grew up in the restaurant business and know what it means to be seated by the kitchen-but my son liked it and that is all that matters) but the waiter was wonderful and the manager made everything all good again.

I've never really golfed before (with the exception of mini golf) so this was an awesome place to learn. They charge by the hour ($30-50) and the rates are higher depending on what time of day you go. This location has three levels, the higher obviously being the most desirable, so if you're looking to get on the 2nd or 3rd level expect a wait. Even though they have a ton of lanes on each floor this is a very popular new spot and the wait around 10am for these was about 30 minutes for the higher floors. The ambiance is great, think World of Beer meets your local driving range. They have high top tables and some have lounge areas with couches depending on the lane you get. \\n\\nThe lanes have TV's and set of clubs for men and women but you can bring your own clubs if you have them. The concierge staff person will show you to your lane will go through the rules and how-to's if you ask. Then it's game on! A server will come around to take your order for food and drink (they have a full bar) which we did not partake on this occasion. The have different holes with point markers you're supposed to hit the golf balls into - if you're that good. You can play all different types of games that are preloaded on to the computer screen. Kind of reminded me of a super high tech bowling alley console but it automatically records your scores. The balls are somehow tracked for distance, height, speed; it's honestly very very cool.  Despite not being very good I had a blast. They have a full restaurant with bar on their main floor if golfing isn't your thing.

There were two teenage girls working, and we didn't have to wait long to get to the front of the line. First dumb move: we were ordering 4 sandwiches and they toasted each one individually (I know two can be toasted at once, since they always do that at the other location.) Then for an unknown reason, one of the girls could not control her giggling while she tried to make a sandwich. We all looked around and tried to figure out what was so dang funny, but it must've been a private joke between her and herself. The other girl was also making sandwiches, and I believe she took the term \\"Sandwich Artist\\" very seriously. No quick scattering of veggies here, she took each cucumber and tomato slice and laid it out precisely as if time was of no importance whatsoever. (She was wrong, she was actually wasting our time...) \\nWe got a little excited when we noticed the banner saying that in celebration of Leap Year, every purchase would be rewarded with a free cookie. We had four people who ordered four sandwiches so we thought we'd get four cookies, but NOPE! The professional sandwich artist informed me that the promotion was for one cookie per purchase and we were only making one purchase. So four people should share one cookie. I questioned whether we could get four cookies if I paid for each sandwich separately. She said yes. I decided if the company needed to be so frugal, I would not cause them the hardship involved in giving away a few extra cookies. \\nWhile eating my sandwich and making a decision to never return to that Subway, I realized I was chewing on a piece of paper that somehow made it into my sandwich. \\nSeriously, that place did not even deserve one star."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Best brunch in Portland!

The hot apple pie has too much liquor in it so it can be a bit much after a few sips.  Long wait to get a table and waiting area can get really crowded on a wet day.  The tables are very close to one another so not ideal for wanting to have a more private meal.  \\nTips:  Get there early!  We didn't have to wait for a table at all.  The bar looked like a great place to have breakfast too.  If you order the french toast use the marionberry jam that's on the table.  Wow!  No syrup required!  You can sub your toast and potatoes and get french toast on the side if you are looking for a little sweet and savory meal.  Before you leave ask for some more coffee but in a to go cup.  \\nOverall, it was a nice experience and I'd love to try again to see if I can get a better meal this time.

If the business goes out of their way to service us, a customer in turn should be polite and follow a few simple rules, this means:\\n\\nNo talking on a cell phones while in line, or while ordering your food. No exceptions. Always be polite, even when the wait is longer than expected and when calling in oh say a large order, such as 15 cheese steaks and 15 orders of fries, always give them enough time to complete your order before coming. If they say its going to be a 20 minute wait then don't come in 2 minutes after you place the order. \\n\\nWhat ends up happening is the people that were there right before you, or at the same time as you, end up waiting along time because you couldn't listen to directions. \\n\\nI ordered the Italian sub and a drink. They serve Pepsi products, and I much prefer coke, but I like Dr, pepper so I was okay with that. I got the works on the sub, and asked about what they called \\"Italian dressing\\", I asked if it was oil and vinegar\\" She nodded because some shops say Italian dressing which is more like a dressing and some are more like a simple blend of oil and vinegar. This was the former, and if I had known I probably would have left it off or asked for it on the side. \\n\\nThe bread was nothing noteworthy, it was kept together was was a good consistency, but it lacked any texture or crusty outside. \\n\\nThe best part of the sub was the meat and the cheese. The Italian meats,(ham , salami, pepperoni, and what looked like cappicuola) were of good quality and balanced with a perfect spiciness. \\n\\nThe cheese was a pleasant surprise, you could taste it, unlike some provolones, I've had at other sub shops. The cheese made me smile because it was very present on the sub. \\n\\nOne other thing is, that even though you can't see it looks like they hand slice everything from the meats, cheese and even the pickles. \\n\\nI would recommend getting there before the lunch rush(11am-11:30) or after the lunch rush(2pm,5pm), if you are in a hurry or don't like to wait more than 15-20 minutes for a sandwich."},{"name":"India Palace","address":"23 Union Sq","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Pretty decent Indian food in Somerville's Union Sq.

Most of the women were in dresses and heels, including the servers, and the men were in collar shirts and blazers.  I felt underdressed being in a zipped hoodie and leggings, but at least I didn't get that vibe from the attitude of the servers.  They were all really friendly and helpful.  \\n\\nSince the place is known for its small plates/tapas we asked our server for recommendations.  She insisted that we try the Tuna Avocado Salsa Dip, as it was her favorite item.  We also ordered a deluxe sashimi plate, which came with fives sashimis and the Spicy Pork Ishi-Yaki, which was a rice dish that came in a hot stone bowl with minced pork, spicy miso and egg.  I tried the Tokyo Iced Tea, which I didn't find at all alcoholic.  It was refreshing and light yet could not taste any alcohol, so felt it was a waste of money.  The Tuna Avocado Salsa Dip was really good, as our server recommended.  When they bring the dish out, a server actually will compile the chopped pieces of albacore tuna, an entire avocado and tomatoes and onions and make the salsa right in front of you.  It was nice since we would've never known that they use an entire avocado!  And the plantain chips that came with were complementary for the dip, as they weren't salty or overpowering like corn chips.  The fresh albacore and avocado was awesome.  The dishes came out as they were ready, and the second dish was our Spicy Pork Ishi-Yaki, that they again compile up for you, kind of like fried rice.  They mix the rice, spicy miso, tomato, minced pork and the fried egg right in front of you and smear it on the sides of the hot stone bowl, to help it cook more.  The server also warns you to wait at least five minutes until digging in, as the food will continue to cook in the bowl.  And you can see this happening, too.  It was a good dish, that filled up on the heartier side of our dinner.  Although it was tasty, especially with the fried egg, I wish it had been much spicier as the name says.  Our last dish, the deluxe sashimi included three pieces of sockeye salmon, albacore tuna, red tuna, yellowtail and five pieces of scallops.  It was a solid dish, but did not care for the scallop addition.  They weren't whole scallops, but chopped pieces of it.  \\n\\nOverall it was a fun place for dinner with a menu worth checking out.

As soon as I entered the restaurant someone jumped on me and asked whether I want to sit outside or inside, and asked for my name - then she disappeared. In 99.999% of all restaurants I have ever been to (except this very specific Hopdoddy) if someone asks me whether I want to sit outside or inside, I was seated right away or asked to wait for my turn. Here, you fill a cute \\"where do I want to sit\\" survey and wait in line until you make it to the cashier.\\n- The cashier is not a cashier. You can order but you can't pay (why can't I order from my table? who knows? why I can't pay? who knows?). \\n- That cashier (?)/server will greet you with your name, give you a piece of paper and assign you a table (well, that's what the survey is for but I would not hire one more person just to make someone greet me with my name). That cashier/server WILL NOT have any idea about what today's date is, what time it is, or what's included in the happy hour menu. She will keep interrupting the other cashier/server to answer all of your questions. I mean ALL OF THEM.\\n- You'll sit and you'll have a server. That server won't serve your food, someone from the kitchen will bring you your food. What the server is for? Well, you haven't paid yet and someone should take your credit card to where you came from and bring you the receipt back  right? \\n- You'll tell (someone who works there) you sent hopdoddy an email and made some recommendations, but never heard anything back and that someone will respond back by saying \\"yeaaaah, we get a lot of emails.\\" Customer Service 101: Listen to your customers, listen, listen, listen and be respectful.

The cocktail menu is as amazing as everyone says. You honestly can't go wrong: there is something for everyone, whether you like something bright and saccharine, icy and refreshing, or strong and boozy. I plan to continue returning to the Diamond until I have tried every cocktail on the menu, and I expect this will take me a while. \\n\\nI visited the Diamond on a Friday night with a friend at about 11:30pm, and realized as we walked in the door that my bright-eyed, cocktail-hungry, olive-lusting expression didn't match that of my companion, who was somehow already at the time-to-call-a-cab-drunk stage of the evening. Our server politely said, \\"How about some food and a glass of water before you hit the cocktails, eh?\\" while seating us. As I perused the menu (I will talk about the menu in a second, let me finish my story here), my friend was slowly lowering himself onto the table into full on nap mode. I gave him a few shakes and decided to call it quits. The server had already brought me my beloved olives, and I went to find him to say I'd like to pay for those and then drag my companion out to tuck him into a bed more suited to his needs than the table at a somewhat upscale bar. He immediately said there was no need to pay, and that he hoped my friend was doing alright. We scuffled out of there, half upright (I think I was the upright half), tail between our legs, and he thanked us on our way out and said to come back another time. And I will. I've never had someone be so kind and respectful about blatant public wastedness. I've been unceremoniously ejected from scummy bars due to my cohorts acting less drunk than that, and I feel there is really something to be said for showing a bit of respect when you're dragging someone out of a bar by the elbow. \\n\\nSo, thanks, the Diamond, and thanks to the server for the 5 olives I snacked on before we hit the dirt trail. The rest of the food? Well, I have to say this in every review I post: I'm vegetarian, so my opinion on non-vegetarian-friendly menus doesn't really count. The olives are great and I'm sure the meats are too. I'd be stoked to see something more vegetarian friendly, but I am giving this place 5 stars for incredible cocktails and incredible service.

We stopped into Promise pizza in the Great Hills area of Austin. This is their second location in as many years in the Austin area. When we pulled up we were quickly bummed out that there was no tables to eat inside, it's only a carry out and delivery spot. Once we walked in we were greeted nicely by a nice guy that answered our questions the best he could. We were a bit overwhelmed by the choices of the pizza. Where to start, it's like a fucking subway, pick your bread, pick your style, pick your sauce, pick your cheese and pick your toppings. Some would love the options but we are old school, just give us a pepperoni pizza on normal crust, normal style, yes gluten, yes cheese, yes normal red sauce. They had a couple of patio tables and chairs outside for us to wait and relax for our crazy pizza.\\n\\nWhen I get a pizza I just like an ice cold coke with it but you better bring your own if you're the same because they only offer Blue Sky Soda and Honest Tea. I am not going to knock them though, if you're going to go the 'organic' route, than do it fully...and they do.  Our expectations were not high as we watched the kid sheet the dough then run the pizza through a conveyor oven, another Austin pizza place taking the easy road out. When the pizza came out, we had a couple of questions that the kid could not answer, so he got the owner out for us. We were really pleased that the owner took the time to come out and talk with us and even show us some of the ingredients. Nothing to hide, again have to respect that.\\n\\nOnto the pizza, it was baked about as nicely as you can out of a conveyor, the sauce is a little on the sweeter side (which I prefer), the cheese was a nice provolone and mozzarella blend which we found out is some of the most expensive cheese you can buy for a pizza.  Surprisingly the crust (we chose the white over the whole wheat on this day) actually had a crust even after being sheeted. Overall the pizza flavor flowed nicely, it's a good pizza and if you're a health or organic nut then you should be in heaven.  They are one of the places in Austin tackling the gluten-free pizza and they even sell a gluten-free brownie too.  The menu was loaded with really healthy sounding salads, a great selection of calzones, and some awesome looking cinnamon knots among other dessert choices.\\n\\nThis is a good pizza, and we like that they are trying to use good organic ingredients, be as green as possible and they seem to care about the right things"},{"name":"Superica","address":"99 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The steak fajitas alone get them 4*!

Hubby and I usually don't venture out for Puerto Rican since I enjoy cooking it on my own, but we do like to support Local eateries. Upon entering the interior decor is very nice and up to date. I would have liked to see the Orange awnings outside updated to Red to match the Red inside (Not sure anyone else would notice that it's just an observation from someone in hospitality design) The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and types of food served. We ordered the pinchos, the menu states \\"carne\\" or \\"pollo\\" I had to ask them to clarify that the carne was not beef, but in fact pork \\"cerdo\\", which is what we wanted, the carne description threw me off. We ordered churrasco with mofongo, papa rellena, alcapurrias and 2 pinchos. We were told that our dinner would be about 10 minutes because it was coming from the kitchen. Not a problem, again the staff was lovely and we were happy to take a seat. We sat in the booths which sadly were extremely uncomfortable. The previous tenants had similar booths maybe these are the same just reupholstered? I asked for a sample of the carne guisada/beef stew before we sat down the staff was happy to oblige. The meat was seasoned perfectly and nice and soft. We were served the papa rellena and the alcapurrias first. I was glad to see the dishes served one at a time as ready/ almost tapas style. At first observation, I didn't care much for plating of the frituras. They are served on a black square plastic plates and it just wasn't appealing. Half the plate was empty. My recommendation is to serve these items on smaller plates possibly with a little garnish. Maybe a drizzle of mayo ketchup or similar. I think that the food from the kitchen should actually be served on regular ceramic dinnerware instead of the plastic. The alcapurrias were just too thin and small for the $3 each cost. They definitely need to be a bit bigger and meatier. The papa rellena was a good size and very tasty. All items were nice and hot and we appreciated that! I dislike when the food arrives and it's not hot. Next to come out of the kitchen was the pinchos. Wow! These were absolutely amazing. Seasoned to perfection, grilled to perfection, cubes where cut to the perfect size, BBQ drizzle done right not too much and not too little. One suggestion is for the bread have more garlic/ butter brushed, and also to have them be a tad toasty/ warm regardless, this dish is a 10 of 10. Lastly, the churrasco and the mofongo with a side salad/slaw? The churrasco was on the small side, didn't seem like the best cut of meat it was just okay but the $10 cost didn't make me feel cheated. Once again the plating/ presentation needs some fine tuning,  but it was nice and hot and we appreciated that. The mofongo was another story. This was absolutely delicious! Again, just the right amount of garlic, moist and flavorful. We thoroughly enjoyed it. I've had Guavate a few times and I actually like LF's better. So kudos to the chef. They nailed this dish.

He couldn't believe it and offered to give us free banana pudding (which you get free anyway from the yelp check in offer).

They even offered us drumsticks to sample the spices - very kind!\\n\\nAfter this experience, the food lived up to the hype. I got the sandwich with the hot spice level and it was amazing. The slaw on the sandwich was a great combo with the hot spice. Adding the always free and unlimited house ranch and sweet tea put the meal over the top.

But gyokai (usually tonkotsu-gyokai rather than shoyu-gyokai as it is here) can be very good.\\n\\nThis version here at Menya was somewhat disappointiing for the tsukemen purist. The dipping broth was extremely salty; though tsukemen broth is normally salty because it's so concentrated, this version was salty without being particularly concentrated. I could taste some of the shoyu flavor, but even the faintest sense of seafood escaped me. There were generous portions of chunky fatty pork (kakuni) in the broth, which was solid. Unsurprisingly ,the noodles were just oil-covered versions of the thin noodles used in soup ramen, rather than the thicker noodles especially made for tsukemen. That they didn't have both thin and thick noodles was understandable; what was far less understandable (and acceptable) was finding a corner of plasticpak from the pre-packaged noodles stuck to my ajitama egg. Careless preparation. The egg was decently jelly, though small and yellow since it's an American egg.\\n\\nOverall, a flawed facsimile of what tsukemen should taste, best for when you have a huge craving. It's not terrible, but the broth needs work and the kitchen needs to pay more attention. Front of house service, esp. from the Japanese manager was good. The tsukemen also comes with a curry option. I've always considered curry tsukemen to be fairly uninteresting, but maybe the lower bar would make it easy to clear."},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Upstairs in the loft of the North Market sits this gem of a spot.

I also went to Elementary school right next door to Zaftigs and my Brazilian friend Simone's father started off as one of their first head chefs when they first opened.  So Zaftigs and I have history.\\n\\nThe menu: Some of my favorites include The banana stuffed Challah French Toast w/ Date Butter.  Challah is this sweet Jewish bread, how perfect  considering Brookline is a predominantly Jewish town.  The French toast in smothered with Bananas and Strawberries (and blueberries if you ask) of course all upon your request.  I had never had beef salami until I came to Zaftigs, cooked with scrambled eggs, with pear shaped home fries and english muffin.  Can we talk about corn beef hash?  Yes, they make corned beef hash topped with a fried egg (I like mine over medium) and again those delicious pear shaped home fries.  They make fresh squeezed OJ, Grapefruit juice and Pineapple juice that will make your mouth water like the Nile. I could go on and on about my favorite dishes.  Let's talk simplistics, When you are seated you are given a tray of bagel chips with this amazing herb cream cheese, believe me you will ask for them to refurbish you with more!  All of the food has you saying oooh and mmmm.

Wanted to give respect to Bob the owner as well, because he has come so far with his baby.  I remember when he delivered  the lunches we ordered himself.

My experience was nothing short of the finest meal I managed to eat in Austin (and there were no shortage of excellent restaurants during the other days I spent here). For starters, the manager Daniel was incredibly friendly - I have a feeling he treats every new customer like family, because he's quickly able to make you feel welcome, at home and, well, like family. The antipasti were light and perfect to start the palette. My favorite was the fingerling potatoes with a pickle and pickled onion dijon vinagrette prep. Cold served mushrooms were also excellent. \\n\\nThey make a hummous-like spread for their fresh baked bread (either Navy or Fava bean and garlic/olive oil with fresh herbs) that's unreal. I suppose anyone that's eaten there knows there's a garden in their back yard, and I'm pretty sure that at least some of the salad ingredients and herbs come right out of the ground the day you'll eat them. \\n\\nFor entrees I had the Panko crusted oak fired \\"sashimi grade\\" tuna (ahi). I live in Hawaii, so I know a thing or two about sashimi grade tuna. This was the real deal. So much so, that I asked Daniel where they bought their fish - no surprise, from Honolulu fish company (delivered the day after line caught from Oahu). This is the same company that supplies the pacific-fusion restaurant Roy's (among others I'd guess) with all their incredible fresh fish in the islands. The fish and the prep were as good as anything I've ever eaten. Props on the perfectly ripe avocado and arugula cucumber salad to compliment the seared ahi as well.  \\n\\nMy daughter had a butternut squash ravioli spiced with sage and some sort of savory sauce (walnut or pecan based from the looks). The sweetness of the squash and savory flavor of the sauce were a perfect compliment. Being younger and with a little less adventurous palette, she was looking for \\"cheese ravioli\\" - so to see her light up on first bite was a relief, and by that point in the meal, no surprise.\\n\\nBottom line is this: if you live in or are visiting Austin, you need to GO TO THIS RESTAURANT. Every now and then someone gets the right idea about combining foods and keeping things fresh, fairly simple and priced reasonably. Then they package it in a welcoming and well designed environment. Vespaio gets top marks on every aspect for my one visit. They were packed on a Sunday night, so I'm also guessing their regular customers feel the same way. I know I'll be back as soon as I can."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Terrific service and a delicious meal!

Some jive turkey was trying to get creative and wound up with a fast-food sushi experience at best. Call me old fashioned, but when you eat sushi traditional Japanese music in the background is appropriate. Someone had the house music blaring so loud I found myself looking around for some jive turkey DJ with his lid cocked side ways. Why was I looking for a DJ? So I could smack him upside the head with his turntable. \\n\\nThis is more of a typical habachi joint and average at that. I had a couple pieces of your typical sushi rolls but I will say the smokey flavor of Inferno Roll is noteworthy. \\n\\nThis spot will probably impress the younger locals who are living in sin in their first apartment, but not the sushi connoisseur with a discriminating palate. If you are a young hipster, living nearby, you can placate your sushi urge while getting your drink on in this joint.Youngsters these days think screaming over loud music is acceptable for casual dining. \\n\\nThis place is OK, but nothing that will compel me to drive across town."},{"name":"Luke's Inside Out","address":"1109 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I had brunch at Gibson and was able to try this place since they supply the brunch food for them!

You have to start a tab for alcohol or beverages with the bar and then go out to the food truck and pay and get your plates.  I just feel like it is a bit inefficient.\\n\\nThat being said there food for brunch was top notch.  The \\"corn dogs\\" which were actually sausages wrapped in corn dog breading were spot on with a mustard seed dressing that was so delightful that it had to be homemade by them!\\n\\nMy other favorite (and I think everyone else's since it was constantly out) was the BACON!!

She even came and checked on us 3 other times before the game ended, then it came time to pay..... Pretty high bill for just beers, so I asked her about it. The idiot that never served us in the first place, added someone's meal to my tab! So instead of re ringing our tab, she pulled cash out of the register and gave it to me, which was fine.

The queso was my favorite--rich and cheesy, put over the top by a dollop of pepper jam in the center. The salsas were tasty too--the red and green both had a lot of flavor, though the pineapple was a little hard, dry and oddly smoked for my taste.\\n\\nFor dinner, we covered the gamut at our table and tried the enchiladas, the trout tostada, the brassicas salad, the tacos and the venison special.¬†¬†The venison--a play on Hosea's Top Chef winning dish according to our waitress--was perfectly cooked and decadently sauced, my favorite, though it was very rich on its own. The fish on the tostada was a little mushy and therefore my least favorite, but there were no major duds.\\n\\nDessert was well worth ordering--the tangelo custard with quinoa granola and berries was outstanding and the chocolate lava cake was tasty, if slightly underwhelming in its chocolatiness.\\n\\nOverall, I liked that you could go fancy or casual here--options like the tacos and burgers are reasonably priced, but you could also go fancy with a salmon or duck entr√©e.

Not so much this time. We arrived at the Oasis at 8:45 pm and we're told there was a 45 minute wait.  To make the most out of our wait, we went upstairs to a local brewery (that has Fantastic views) and all split a $20 flight of beer which arrived at 8:55. At 8:55 we were also texted by the Oasis saying are table was ready (What? 45 min wait is cut down to 10 min). We told the Oasis to give our table up to the next in line so we could drink the beer we just purchased. They said we would have to come now or we would not be seated b/c restaurant closed at 9:00. I asked them why they told us 45 min wait at 8:45 if restaurant closed at 9:00?  In hindsight, there were plenty of tables available at 8:45 -- the 45 min wait response I believe was to discourage us from coming since they closed at 9. We had to throw out our $20 flight of beer and rush downstairs. We ordered $140 worth of food and drink at the Oasis and I wanted the Oasis Manager, Bill Enney, to simply make us whole on the upstairs beer transaction which he refused to do. Although he comped us queso, I found this gesture inadequate.

I opted instead for a table just across from the bar (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326192277/), where I set up my laptop to check some email why I enjoyed a couple of pints and watched the Winter X-Games on one of the televisions. I chatted for a while with an older couple before ordering, one of whom happened to own a photography store and the other a writer for the Portland daily newspaper, somewhat of a coincidence considering the nature of my hobbies, but I guess it could have happened to anyone in a city so artistically inclined.\\n\\nUp first for me off the taps (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326935284/) was the Copacetic IPA. It had a good bit of cloudiness to it when poured and a lovely burnt orange color (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326925958/). The beer has a relatively heavy amount of bitterness from the hops, particularly the Chinook variety used in this brew, which is initially balanced out somewhat due to the fresh and almost juicy flavors, but eventually just overtakes the beer. There are some really great flavors in here, they just have to fight too hard to stand out. The second beer I decided to try was one of their seasonal offerings, Frosty's Revenge (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326931158/), which rings in at 8% and according to them (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4326937872/) has a bit of Belgian candied sugar added in to the crystal malts. The malt really stands out in this beer, and I actually enjoyed it more than the IPA. Every now and then you would get hints of caramel even some honey, a nice winter warmer for sure. I wish I had read the board closer, as their other seasonal offering, the Sleighjerker, was a chocolatey stout-like ale, one of my favorite styles. \\n\\nAlas, I really only had the time, and the stomach space, to support 2 beers. When I was all packed up and ready to go I encountered yet another incredibly friendly Portland resident, my third real stand-out along with the hostess at Screen Door and the girl working the gates at the Japanese Gardens, this time in the form of the bartender here. He mistakenly only charged me for a single beer, and when I told him that I actually ordered two he told me the second one was on him, just because I was actually honest, nice. I went ahead and tipped him to make up for the difference in the beer I wasn't charged for, because even though I don't believe in karma I might as well get some just in case all the religious folks are right."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Mike's Pastry offers about five different types of cannoli and some other pastries and dessert items including gelato.

It was one of the few sushi places that was open for late lunch in my hood.  Service was great and the ambience was alright.  But right now I'm suffering from some awful indigestion from this place.  \\n\\nWe ordered a couple of miso soups and the Idaka (baby octopus) app to start.  The miso was standard.  But oh... the Idaka.  The presentation was so unappetizing- a circle of baby neon pink octupi around a pile of daikon and pickles.  When the waitress brought them out, I watched these little guys wiggle to the motion of her bouncy steps.  The little octupi still danced around the daikon bonfire as she set the plate down on our table.  I had to stop to take a photo. Funny enough for Instgram- but not appealing enough to eat.  Despite my reservations, I shoveled the little octopus into my mouth whole.  It was sadly overcooked and super chewy.  \\n\\nI'm preggo (again) and was limited to eating cooked rolls.  So we ordered the Tarantula roll (a dressed up spider roll), and some crunchy roll with calamari tempura as well as crab on the inside.  Both rolls were covered in eel sauce.  I've had sushi all around the world and am familiar with the smokey, savory and slightly sweet flavor of eel sauce.  But something about their eel sauce is incredibly off and sickeningly sweet.

The purpose is to make you thirsty and therefore make you drink more. Hence, the name \\"tapas\\" which means \\"to top off.\\" Comparable to say complimentary peanuts or popcorn at the bar. \\n\\nI definitely appreciate how it has evolved into a style of dining where you order small shareable plates and get to try a variety of dishes instead of just one entree. \\n\\nSo my review of Little Donkey: we ordered seven tapas. Just two stood out. The matzoh ball ramen, serious bang for your buck and delicious, no complaints there. And the octopus. It was great! Misleading though. Advertised with tostones as an accompaniment. Which would've been delectable as tostones accompany seafood so well. No tostones though, just fingerling potatoes instead. They are two completely different things. \\n\\nThe foie gras came pretty short. It's a tiny portion served on top of a thick piece of bread. The ratio of foie gras to bread is disappointing. Too much bread that overshadows the foie gras. In fact, I noticed this same trend in other dishes I had like the Wagyu steak tartare. They overcompensate for the tiny portions by filling the plate with some type of bread. \\n\\nThe foie gras burger was good. It wasn't great. I was expecting a thick med rare patty with a slab of foie gras. I did not taste or see the foie gras and the burger was a thin patty slightly over cooked. Again overshadowed by the bun. \\n\\nThe fluke ceviche is delicious but an embarrassingly small portion. You could eat it in one bite. Surprisingly, they offered no bread to camouflage this one. \\n\\nBasically I felt that, like most take on tapas in this region, it's too overpriced for what they're offering. The ingredients are not really that exotic or expensive to begin with. Basically you are paying for the experience, and for a lot of bread.\\n\\nI give it 3 stars cause the ambience is good and my wine was good.

My son was pretty happy with his grilled cheese and fruit cup. His only complaint was that the melon was too soggy, but other than that, at least they can handle a kid's plate. My husband ordered the Philly sandwich, and only ate half because he couldn't figure out what the fermented taste was.

It's more conservative than trendy--my dad booked this place for dinner a few years ago when all our (old and young) relatives were in town for my high school graduation--with seafood and steak staple dishes filling the menu, leaving little room for true culinary innovation, and that's perfectly fine. \\n\\nSETTING: When you walk in, you notice the water cascading down the tiled wall behind the hostess's stand. The main dining room overlooks the Chattahoochee river. While the table we were sitting at positioned two of us looking directly into the setting sun, a shade made an attempt to cover the glare. Patrons wandered in the courtyard outside between the building and the river. \\n\\nSERVICE: Everyone had their act together, naturally. Our waiter introduced himself, and also referenced the names of two other gentlemen that would be \\"the team\\" for tonight. He was around when he needed to be, and wasn't when he didn't need to be. When we asked for more bread, it was brought out promptly. Our appetizer, wine, salad course, and mains were all well-timed. \\n\\nFOOD: To start we got the smoked salmon, which is served as a warm filet (not lox) accompanied with capers and cream cheese (?) and a strong-enough smoked flavor. The sourdough bread they give with the apps was good as well, although nothing to write home about. I ordered the chopped salad, which was generously portioned, and the white beans and--even though I'm not normally a fan of them--olives added a nice touch. I got the BBQ shrimp (an app) for my main, which came as 5 large shrimp marinated in a flavorful BBQ sauce over corn cakes. My mom ordered a steak, which looked pretty huge (I didn't see what size she got), and my dad got the lamb. According to him, the lamb was \\"the best he had eaten since he was in New Zealand.\\" Okay, so apparently they have the best lamb in North America or something. \\n\\nThis ultimately would have been a 5 star experience, except the wine glasses were dirty.

Jackpot!\\n\\nOkay, I should start with saying that I've had a very long-standing aversion to seafood and  most of the other things that make up sushi rolls. But I love food and want to expand my culinary horizons, so I've been trying to eat it every so often. And although the taste and texture still gets to me a bit I have cravings for sushi once in awhile...my appetite is a mystery to me.\\n\\nAnyway, I've been bugging my BF to go with me here. We finally had a good opportunity to when we planned to go to dinner with a friend of mine whose only requirement for dinner that night was that \\"they serve wine\\". Alrighty, Urban Hibachi serves alcohol, yay! Off we went!\\n\\nWe got there and it was decently crowded. A pretty small restaurant actually, but the interior was very nice and trendy. It put the \\"urban\\" in Urban Hibachi. There was some wait for a table as multiple servers and a manager seemed unsure of where we were going to be put. Service isn't the strong point of the restaurant, although they were all fairly friendly. \\n\\nWe sat and immediately some glasses of wine were ordered. So, I'm not a wine person at all. I enjoy mixed drinks and liquor much more than beer or wine. But my BF ordered Plum Wine and OMG that is the stuff. I can't say whether this wine was any more special than wine from anywhere else, but it was quite tasty.\\n\\nWe ordered some appetizers: fried calamari and tempura veggies. Both were average and we could have done without them. I had never had calamari either and I was a little worried; fortunately, it was a painless experience. Just an odd, chewy texture. Not for me really, but not horrible.\\n\\nMy BF and I split the Hawaiian Roll, which comes with coconut shrimp, cream cheese, asparagus, and is wrapped in mango and avocado. It was definitely my favorite of the night. The mango is a great complement to the rest of the flavors being a mild, tropical fruit. I ordered the Rock and Roll for myself even though it had spicy tuna and I'm not much for spicy (I was going all outside the box for myself that night lol). Besides the tuna, it has scallions and masago and comes with a \\"cajun mayo\\" on the side. Very interesting. I was getting a bit full at that point though. \\n\\nMy BF ordered the chicken and steak hibachi dinner and I enjoyed what I sampled off his plate. The meat tasted good and moist, and the noodles he had with it were yummy as well. All of our main platters that night had ingredients that tasted fresh and I enjoyed all the flavors. Overall, the food was really wonderful even though the service was just OK.

We asked if they were planning on staying open a bit longer and he said \\"no.\\"  At this point we would be  a little rushed but might be able to make one trip to the buffet and place an order.  I asked if they might offer a discounted price since we were now going on less than 20 minutes to order.  He simply said \\"no\\" again, he didn't even offer to ask a manager.

There was a good amount of chicken which, I think, make the $6 price point worth it. However, there was something missing... the chicken was dry--overcooked and a bit too charred, for one.

Normally, one would expect the service staff to at least ACKNOWLEDGE the fact that it is sweltering hot inside the restaurant, but nobody did.  \\n\\nI was willing to put up with the heat if the food was good, so we ordered our food despite being slightly uncomfortable.  We waited about 25 minutes for our food to come out.  Again, I can deal with that if the food is good; I'd rather have well-prepared food that takes a little while to prepare than microwaved frozen astronaut food.  \\n\\nAfter checking on us once when we were almost finished with our food, our server literally disappeared for the next 45 minutes.  During that time, we were done eating, and nobody checked on us at all.  When our server finally decided to saunter casually back to our table, the first words to come out of his mouth were, \\"Did you even eat any of it?\\"  No joke.  Not, \\"I'm sorry it's taken me a while to get back here,\\" or, \\"I apologize for the wait.\\"  Just a comment on the amount of food I consumed (which, by the way, is none of his business).\\n\\nBy that point I was incredibly irritated.  When I told our new friend that I had a Groupon, his response was, \\"Argh.\\"  Yes, ARGH.  It appeared that our harbinger of joy had moved on from making condescending remarks about my eating habits to grumbling about a damn Groupon.  He couldn't figure out how to process the Groupon, which I had pulled up on my phone, and without asking, kept pressing buttons with his dirty fingers on my screen.  \\n\\nShockingly, it took him at least another 15 minutes to process our payment.  It should come as no surprise to anyone that we will not be returning.\\n\\nOh, but the cinnamon roll french toast is positively delightful, which is why it gets two stars rather than one."},{"name":"The Diamond","address":"6 Powell Street, 2nd Floor","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a very very hip place to have a cocktail.

The Renaissance has small rooms that are in grave need of upgrades, without those much needed upgrades the rooms look old and tired, and not as clean. As you can see from my photos most of the appliances are outdated, and if they're moved get ready for the dust. I don't know if it is the area or clientele but I have yet to find a solid MCO hotel.

We were up well before 8am, ravenous as usual, and walked a good mile or so anxiously anticipating a delicious meal. Fortunately we got there around 8:30am, which I guess was earlier enough to avoid the line. On our way there, he filled me in on his favorites: the banana stuffed french toast and the Empire Eggs. By the time we got to the restaurant, I was so hungry I didn't even want to bother looking seriously at the other items on the menu, so we decided to split his suggested dishes.\\n\\nOh my goodness, did they deliver. My boyfriend plopped one of the Empire Eggs onto one of the several small plates conveniently set between us (Zaftigs knows sharing is caring!), and I immediately dug in. The Hollandaise sauce atop the perfectly poached egg was delicious, and the smoked salmon and potato pancake (crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside) were the exact tools I needed to sop up the creamy mixture of spilled sauce and yolk. There was some spinach in there too, but who's paying attention to that with the crazy rich business going on elsewhere in this dish?\\n\\nThen came the french toast, topped prettily with strawberries, blueberries, and a dusting of powdered sugar. When I cut into the THICK slice to give the boyfriend a piece, gobs of warm banana in date butter started to ooze out. I had to do a pretty quick maneuver to transfer his half to a plate, lest I lose any of the yummy filling! \\n\\nNow, I really don't like dry foods, so with breakfast goods like pancakes and french toast I usually drown my plate in syrup for both taste and texture. This french toast hardly needed any help! I drizzled a little on the crust where the moistness of the toast ended, but otherwise the stuffing was flavorful and saucy enough to provide me with an excellent sweet-breakfast experience. Yay Zaftigs!\\n\\nP.S. The staff also wear tshirts with fun Jewish breakfast puns like \\"Challah Back\\" and \\"Good Lox\\".

This place is not really my style or what I look for in a coffee shop, but I will correct my post below with 2 points:  The owner really cares about the place and though I don't totally get it, it is a unique business and it is thoughtfully and intentionally done.  Second point- though the coffee wasn't all that good tasting, I give them big points for the fact that it is actually fair trade and organic.  That means a lot and I'm glad they support that kind of industry.  Sorry to the manager who was my barista, also... please smile and be friendly!

But there wasn't really an excuse for his fast-food-drive-through service level of quality.  Actually, that comparison is an insult to fast food service employees around the country as I have frequently witnessed more cheerness and personality there than I did at Kickbutt.  \\n\\nI really just wanted to Kick HIS Butt, to be honest.  He slammed our coffee shots around like he was trying to kick THEIR butts.  His grouchy face and the \\"Tipping is not a place in China.

Modern debate, I buckled down to do some cannoli science and sample two chocolate chip cannoli between the two embattled establishments. What I found seems to back the traditional findings: at Mike's you pay 50 cents more but it is proportionally bigger and has minutely better presentation (aside from the size and different shaped chocolate chips, they appear identical). As the Modern ones aren't pre-filled, their crust is crispier. Whether or not you prefer this is entirely a matter of taste, it really made no difference to me in my enjoyment of the cannoli's. For some reason Mike's seems more \\"fun\\" to be inside of though, as sometimes a gentle chaos is nice. Ultimately, both cannolis are five star worthy, the debate is pointless, and the superior establishment is whichever one has a shorter line when you arrive. I don't know how it happened, maybe some Boston travel book or something, but many tourists seem to think that locals prefer Modern over Mike's, and therefor is the \\"real\\", \\"authentic\\" choice. Maybe it is, and I totally encourage them to think this if it makes them feel better. However, you'll notice that many who have \\"done the science\\" will tell you they are equally great.

From the crust on the bread to the well seasoned and juicy pork, it was a terrific sandwich. Be sure to order the fries inside the sandwich, it really does make a difference in flavor and texture. \\n\\nWe also tried a few entrees, the fried chicken and the seared scallops. The chicken is a southern style breakfast sandwich, served on a buttery biscuit, smothered with gravy, topped with bacon and a beautifully cooked egg. Getting all the ingredients in a single bite is an adventure in texture and flavors. My friend's scallops were well cooked, beautifully seared on the outside, tender, juicy, and sweet on the inside. I also liked the cauliflower the scallops are served on, which had a Mediterranean type seasoning to it. The variety in flavors they feature in their entrees is pretty impressive. Lastly, the chocolate souffle dessert is a perfect ending to any meal. It is rich and deeply chocoloatey but still had the light airiness of a souffle. \\n\\nOverall a great dining experience for a pretty affordable price.

Enough, but not too many,  chocolate chips.  The Country Benny is essentially biscuits and gravy on steroids.  Take a fantastic biscuit and a solid sausage gravy, and add 2 sausage patties and two poached eggs.  Drop in a side of hash browns, and it's a masterpiece. Yeah, it might be a little high in cholesterol...but for something this good it's worth it.  Oh, and the biscuit?  Just. Plain. Great.

Next, we walk up to the front desk to see two smiling faces and the main employee explaining his recommendations to another customer.  The employee quickly turns to us, apologizes that we ha to wait (Dude, we waited like a minute) and we get our name on the list. HOW AWESOME is it that we got text messages letting us know how much time we had to wait/until we are seated. So cool dude.\\n\\nFast forward to getting our orders taken, the waiter was this quirky, funny, professional guy who-although seemed like a walking mess-had his sh*t together. He quickly took our orders with enough time to crack a few jokes.\\n\\nLater on, we even heard him helping another guy (He is a chef) make a \\"complicated order\\" which turned out to be half a blueberry waffle and half a mulberry (?) pancake stack.

I got the Wild Salmon Hash with poached eggs and I was flabbergasted that something could taste so good.

Just like any Mexican restaurant, they bring chips to the table, but bring two salsas, both of which are homemade, and both of which satisfy the taste buds around the table: one smoky, and one a Green salsa. I decided to have the fajitas, because I was feeling a little boring that night. However they were not boring.

A month after your opening we were upset to see that your Yelp reviews weren't looking so hot and thought that maybe the locals were having a hard time getting used to the unique menu that we were already accustomed to.  We visited you a few more times and still received the high level of customer service and good food with fresh ingredients that we have come to expect.

Usually no matter how busy a Noodles location is, you can expect your order to come in around 5-10 minutes.  We waited around 20-25 minutes.  Then when the food came, my girlfriend was given the wrong soup by the same person who took the order.  She was also not given silverware for her food so she had to get up and ask for it while the employee was fixing the soup issue.  Then she noticed that the noodles in her entree were burnt enough to taste it.  As we ate, we heard a couple \\"I'm sorry this took so long\\"s throughout the restaurant as other customer's orders were being delivered.\\n\\nI give 4 stars because I didn't review the first couple times we came...which were all great experiences.

It's a Marriott, so the bed is great, the shampoo is orange-gingerish and the wall art is standardized (however, they did have some local pics...I appreciate that, it helps me to know where I am in the morning).  We were there during 4th of July week, an exceptionally busy (and this year, very HOT) time of year and the air conditioning in the public spaces really could have been adjusted downwards a few ticks, especially during convention-related functions.

He's truly a prince among front desk personel anywhere!\\n\\nValet/Bell Desk:  The valet guys were on the ball as a general rule, directing traffic efficiently, assisting with bags and doing the valet stuff they do so well.  Another shout-out to my buddy Tony who combines his valet career with a budding stand-up routine: funny, friendly and always in a good mood...who wouldn't want to be greeted by someone like him?\\n\\nF&B: Yikes!  This is the one area where this hotel did not shine.

If you're taking pastries to go, you order at the counter and get a box to take. If you want to stay and eat, sit at the tables (there are only a few and you may have to wait a few minutes to snag a table, but well worth that wait) and a server will come to you with a menu.\\n\\nThe Boston cream pie was actually a cupcake, as they didn't have any full pies. It was topped with a chocolate swirl ganache which was very thick and rich. The cake itself was a little dry and unimpressive, but the cream inside was light and creamy. Overall, not a bad cupcake.\\n\\nThe cannoli was SO delicious and definitely was the best thing I had there. We ordered a chocolate dipped cannoli with vanilla custard filling (they have so many options for the shell, filling, and toppings that you can customize). Creamy custard, crunchy shell, no overwhelming sweetness. Everything about this dessert was perfect!\\n\\nI suggest getting a few different things and sharing so that you can taste everything. They also accept cash only, so come prepared!"},{"name":"Masala Dhaba","address":"75 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Well, 4-stars for the fact that they are at a good spot and functioning at times when you really crave for some decent food.

However, there is one exception, a client everyone fights over because their office is located in the North End just around the corner from Massimino's.\\n\\nMassimino's is the kind of restaurant where you always ignore the menu and order one of the daily specials.  Today I walked in for lunch, and 9 of the 11 patrons had all ordered the same dish: it was seafood plate with swordfish, mussels, shrimp and calamari over homemade gnocchi.   There was also a pasta dish, a chicken dish, and a plate with chicken, sausage and veal on the specials menu.\\n\\nMy coworker got the seafood plate, and it looked amazing (three hours later, he's still raving about it as he walks out the door).  I got the chicken (Chicken Roma, I believe).  The chicken was tender and incredibly flavorful.  I was a little disappointed with the sauce on the side of pasta that came with the chicken - it was very thin and watery - but overall I really shouldn't complain.\\n\\nThe big surprise of the afternoon came with the bill.  My chicken was $12.95, reasonable and in fact a little expensive compared to the rest of the menu, but the seafood dish was $13.95.

The building now occupied by Botekim has had several incarnations over the past few years, including two lives as BBQ restaurants.It seems natural a Brazilian Bistro would open here. This neighborhood is Ground Zero for the Brazilian population in metro Atlanta - I have become a huge fan of their cuisine.\\n\\nI was impressed by a lot, but disappointed by a couple of things. I truly hope they can iron out a few kinks that I will chalk up to being brand new, because I want to patronize local businesses and see them succeed.\\n\\nWe pulled up on time and handed the car over to a valet. I'm not crazy about \\"complimentary\\" valet parking. On this night, there was PLENTY of parking available. I'm guessing at some point if they get busy enough, they might need to pack cars in. Definitely not yet. I found the valet completely unecessary - one of those where you can literally see your car as the valet guy goes to \\"retrieve\\" it (read, walks 10 yards).\\n\\nThey've done a nice job re-designing the inside. It has a surprisingly light and classy feel (I say \\"surprisingly\\" because of the aforementioned fact that it just to be a BBQ joint). Plenty of space between the tables. The server was friendly and prompt enough. \\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered wine, and I had a caphirinia, which was pretty good. We ordered a cheese plate appetizer - here's where my nitpicking begins. The menu says it comes with pickles. There were no pickles when it arrived. Mind you, this is not a life-or-death situation, by any means. But when you are deciding on what to pick from a menu, those choices are often driven by what you BELIEVE you will be getting. When you don't get it - it leaves you wondering why (especially when there's no explanation offered). Pickle shortage?\\n\\nI did see another table get the braised beef croquettes as appetizer. I kicked myself! Those looked delicious.\\n\\nOtherwise, the cheeses were tasty. One other thing they may want to consider: Serving a little more bread with the cheeses. With the large amount of spreadable gorgonzola mousse made available, it didn't seem to come with a lot of bread. But hjey, in the end I didn't mind since I'm trying to reduce the carbs. Just sayin'.\\n\\nThen came the entrees: I had the picahna with fries. Delicious. Nice, tender cut of meat. The fries were nothing special, but no real quibble there. My girlfriend had the grilled salmon with a passion fruit glaze and mashed potatoes. She liked hers, as well. \\n\\nNow comes my biggest gripe: The girl ordered a side of grilled asparagus. It was $6. When it arrived, we were in shock. There were about 6-8 tiny, limp asparagus stalks. We looked at each other \\"What? Six bucks for THIS?\\" We had imagined a generous portion that we could share, for $6. Nothing doing. It was about 25 cents worth of asparagus, that they should be charging $2.50-$3 for, max. I'm no entrepeneur, but I'm thinking they need to re-think those prices if they want to succeed.\\n\\nOn to dessert. Another major turnoff when the server promptly announced they do not have flan - one of the choices. I can't remember now, but there was a second dessert she said they didn't have. There were only about 5 or 6 choices, so eliminating two right off the bat was a bit of a turnoff. But worse so when one of them is flan. No fan in a Latin-flavored restaurant? Really? Next thing you know roadside diners will start announcing they have no apple pie. C'mon guys ... you are too new to not have these basics available.\\n\\nWe decicded to have dessert, instead, at the nearby Brazilian Bakery.\\n\\nI would've given this place 4 stars if not for these failings. You shouldn't leave a restaurant disappointed. The restaurants that I rate as 4 or 5 stars please me, from top to bottom. This one didn't. \\n\\nI hope these are nothing but opening kinks that they will work out. They don't seem like fatal flaws - unless they allow them to be.\\n\\nOne last note: The owner and chef came to our table several times to introduce themselves, say hello and check on things. That was a very nice touch. They were both very cordial and welcoming and it seems they are aiming to please their customers.\\n\\nI will most deinitely be going back to give them another try."},{"name":"Pizza Bruno","address":"3990 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I went to this place last week... the garlic knots are the best and the Margarita pizza is great!

They seated my husband and I at a small table that barely had enough room for two plates and our drinks (which made it awkward when they brought more than one plate) and was right next to the front door. This wouldn't be an issue, except they CRAM tables in so that there's barely any room to walk, and I kept getting jostled by people coming back and forth (and had to GET UP AND MOVE for several guests in wheelchairs... the space was too narrow). It was VERY noisy, and the waitress kept coming back every five minutes asking if we were \\"ready for boxes\\", bringing out the courses with hardly a pause in between, and it felt very rushed.\\n\\nThe food was fine, but we expected fantastic. The best thing was probably the poutine, which we split, and our entrees were fine too. My husband had the filet (good, not the best we'd ever had) and I had some sort of porkchop thing at the suggestion of the waitress that was just okay. We had the cappucino cake for desert, and it was VERY sweet... probably too sweet since all you could taste was sugar. But if you don't mind the loud atmosphere and cramped conditions (not exactly romantic), the portions are very large and the food is decent and well prepared... it's just not the mind-blower we had expected based on the ratings."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Review #736 unless someone beats me to it.

Mike's service is quicker than Modern because they have more workers and the cannolis are standardized (i.e., made fresh, but not to order like at Modern). That said, the constant flow of customers must make the workers a bit batty, because our lady at Mike's made 3 mistakes and sent me home with 2 of the wrong cannolis.\\n\\n2. Mike's has more variety with about 10 (I believe) types, and the cannolis are much bigger than those at Modern, though the prices are comparable.\\n\\n3. Mike's plain ricotta filling is far superior to that of Modern.\\n\\n4. The coconut and pistachio cannolis are also great. The chocolate covered and chocolate ricotta cannolis, not so much.\\n\\n5. Though the cannoli is bigger, the shell is not as good at Mike's. Modern's shells are more in keeping with other cannolis I have had previously, and taste better. Mike's instantly reminded me of the fried wantons served at Chinese food restaurants: big bubbles and a fried taste.\\n\\n6. All in all, worth the 30min wait, but I think I prefer Modern over Mike's. If I could marry Mike's ricotta filling to Modern's shell, I think I would have had a perfect cannoli."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is not a review of the food, but the customer service.\\nI have wanted to go to Lamberts for quite some time and have heard only raving reviews of it.

We made sure to call ahead of time and find out if we could be served drinks and bar food. We specifically asked the person (I assume the hostess) who picked up the phone if we could eat at the upstairs bar and she told us that it wasn't a problem and it was on a first-come-first served basis. We got there excited to eat some delicious food after driving around for 20 minutes looking for parking, and instead we were greeted with a blocked off upstairs for a private event and the downstairs bar was full. We could have waited the extra 45 minutes for the restaurant to open, but the fact that we were so blatantly given incorrect information over the phone and then just cast aside and not in any way apologized to or even acknowledged that we were given wrong information just put a VERY bad taste in our mouths for this place.\\nI hear the food is good, but I was very disappointed about the customer service there.

They remind me of how my mom used to make them and these are fluffy and tender fries that are waiting to be dipped in the home made sauces.   The salad is pretty sad however - just iceberg lettuce and some veggies topped off - I recommend skipping the salad and ask for a substitute if possible.    Get the $1.50  2 liter Inca Cola to help wash down all  that goodness too.  It may not be for everyone but it is definitely worth a try.  \\n\\nThere are about 5-6  home made sauces you can dip the food in - the red spicy sauce kicks siracha out of the ballpark.  The garlic cream sauce is also a great alternative to the spicy red sauce.    The green sauce is unique and tastes better mixed with the red sauce.  The whole chickens can and have run out in the past due to the sheer popularity and the price factor.  Luckily it hasn't happened to me yet but I heard other dishes are just delicious too.

The octopus tacos are a perfect serving size for a small/medium lunch. Two tacos are served, each with corn, avocado and cilantro on top of a good amount of octopus meat. There is also chicharron served on the side of the plate for an extra crunchy component. I have a cold, and my taste sensation is not super strong right now. Despite this setback,  I can tell you that the octopus was absolutely incredible. It was juicy and soft and had a great mouth feel. It was absolutely mouth watering.

Disney Springs is a giant outdoor mall. \\n\\nSecondly, aside from all of the shops the only things which peaked my interest were: \\n-the strapped in hot air balloon - $18.00 per adult, which is not bad as far as pricing goes with all things considered. \\n-Cirque du Soleil - Entertainment that stands out.\\n-Parking Garage - I'd rather walk up and down the aisles and check out the cars, design/structure(s), piping, sensors, etc. than the shops.\\n-Miscellaneous bands/dancers performing on the \\"streets\\" - Entertainment that's catchy.\\n-Lego Sculptures\\n-A fake volcano (Rainforest Cafe) (I also have a unique attraction towards lava/volcanoes)\\n-T-Rex and Dinosaur Restaurant w/ the groovy fake octopus moving its tentacles. \\n-Being with my boo at the time.\\n-Accessible by boat and car/bus.\\n\\nWe went to Bongos for dinner.

It took him an additional 4 minutes to bring the drink to the table. The appetizer was guacamole, was overly seasoned with onion but adding lime to it made it tolerable. I ordered chicken fajitas with charro beans. For a restaurant that is categorized as \\"Mexican/Tex-Mex\\".

Perhaps not the best place if you're looking to have a quiet, private conversation.\\n\\nThe sushi was not bad. Not the best I've ever had, but really not bad at all. You had to order piece by piece and pay for any wasted pieces. Pretty neat way to discourage wastefulness, if you ask me. I particularly enjoyed their chicken teriyaki roll. However, the star of the show is the Korean BBQ. Our biggest regret is that we didn't start with the lamb chops from the get-go! Not to say that the chicken BBQ is bad, it's just that the lamb chops truly stole the show.

Then we had to ask our server if we could get margaritas! He never asked for our drink orders. Meanwhile, I ask for another basket of delicious, thin crispy chips.

There was an elongated question and answer session with your front-end staff. My wife was able to decipher what she needed to make informed decisions. You may want to consider a graphical system to denote which items are gluten free or can be prepared gluten free. My daughters order of gluten free hummus with extra carrots arrived with pita, carrots, and no hummus. The staff member did change his gloves and prepared the hummus order again upon request.\\n\\nMy wife and I ordered 2 cups of the potato and leek soup. It promptly arrived burnt. I along with another customer returned the soup for a refund. It was not edible despite its appearance. We enjoyed sitting at the counter until one of the staff routinely delivered hot prepared food items over my daughters head. Several french fries fell on her head. I asked her to stop. She and another staff member did not stop this practice. Staff routinely reached over or adjacent to us to deliver items to other people. the staff is apparently unaware of the liability they are exposing the company to. A better practice would have been to walk around the food station and present the prepared food items to customers at the segment of the live edge countertop between the food prep station and the registers. There are no seats or customers there to spill food on and possibly burn.\\n\\nOur counter seats allowed us to also watch the same staff member prepare french fries by putting potatoes in a press one after the other and have the raw fries fall down a dirty sink backsplash into a dirty sink. They were then scooped up and put into the fryer. This was an unappealing preparation which caused us to get a refund for the 2 orders of french fries the staff had forgotten or lost track of. We also witnessed a customer inquire about his order as well. He asked to omit the rosemary. The staff member replied, we're out of it anyway. This information needed to be disclosed at the point of sale to allow every customer know they were not able to deliver the ingredients listed on the menu.

The service was... strained 2 years ago and things haven't changed much since then. I sympathize with the staff. They appear overworked and overwhelmed. There were only 2 waiters for the entire packed restaurant during peak Sunday (labor shortage?). However, it gets pretty old when your waiter sighs and is exasperated every time you ask for something like water which didn't come until halfway through our meal. The table beside us got so fed up with waiting and incorrect order that they just left. The Korean food was good and prices are on par for Robson Street. The interior looks great and authentic, K-pop music videos on big screen TVs. But the whole dining experience is soured by the service so your party ends up apologizing to each other as you walk out.

A+ rating for Massimino's!!!\\n\\nA special thanks especially to Paul D'Amore and his amazing staff.  It is one of our memorable and unforgettable moments to start our new journey as husband and wife.   We are grateful that there were absolutely no issues from the planning process to the wedding day!!!  In our eyes, the wedding was a hit. Our families tells us it was the \\"best\\" wedding ever!  Maybe they said it to be nice :)  However, to us, it is a great story to share when people asked.     \\n\\nBack to the wedding day...If there were any issues the day of the wedding, Paul and his staff made it seamless and effortless!!   No Bridezilla or Groomzilla tantrums on our end!  Wedding started at 5:30pm and by 6:00pm a case of Tito's were devoured!!  His staff made a liquor run to replenish and it was not at all noticeable!!!  \\n\\nFor my fellow yelpers, especially for those who are interested in having your wedding or an event catered, please read along! If you are too busy, check out our photos!  Have trust issues...just go check out the restaurant and eat as your heart desires!  \\n\\nFrom the onset of the wedding planning process, Paul sat down with my husband and I to go over the menu, options and selections.  As a couple, our vision for the wedding was to focus on food, booze and fun, however, doing so within our budget.  We didn't care for the glitter and glam...and provided Paul our proposed budget (with potential wiggle room to increase if needed).  We asked for his advice as we don't know anything about catering.  \\n\\nHe sat down with us, and compiled a draft proposal of food and pairings after our meeting.  He was patient and straight forward!  Most caterers compile a list without wanting to even meet with you.  He took his time and made it very easy.  After a review of the menu and offers, a tasting was prepared the day we met and did not have to wait!  We have never dine at Massimino's prior to this...and it was at that tasting  where we made a decision.  The food is AMAZING and tasteful.  We are forever in love with Massimino's! \\n\\nTo set the back drop of our wedding,  it was an open bar and we opted for buffet style.  For those who love sit down dinners, that too can be arranged, however, the focus of our wedding was simplicity focusing on the items mentioned early (food and booze).  \\n\\nCocktail Hour:  Two different reds (Rioja & Merlot) and Whites (Chardonnay & Pinot Grigio); all the fixin's for mixed drinks, Vodka. Note: we worked with Paul and asked for the specifics as to what drinks we wanted for our guests. \\n\\nHors D'oeuvres: Stuffed Mushrooms, Bacon wrapped scallops and fried artichokes passed around during cocktail hour\\n\\nPrior to Dinner being served: Warm Bread paired with the special Garlic/pepper infused olive oil was placed at each table with a separate platter of antipasto\\n\\nDinner: Fusilli Matriciana; Pork Ribs (special request) with potato & vinegar peppers; Eggplant Parmigiana, Veal Braciolitini Pizzaiola & Kids Menu (Chicken Fingers & Fries) \\n\\nCake: (5) different styles of cake.  We ordered the cake from a separate entity however, we asked for specifics from the Massimino's team (arrangement, style, coffee selection, etc), and they fulfilled our request. \\n\\nOverall, it was an amazing night and everything was flawless!  Food was great!  Staff was excellent!  We thank the team!   Each anniversary we have, my husband and I frequent Massimino's to relive it! \\n\\nThanks for reading!

Well I was in for a HUGE letdown. I got simple basic rolls, a spicy tuna, and a salmon roll. My biggest issue was the consistency of the rice. It was terrible and not properly cooked. Also the seaweed. Since the rice was a bit on the moist side it made the seaweed wet, and anyone who knows ANYTHING about sushi should know that when seaweed gets damp it also gets chewy. But that wasn't my only problem with the seaweed. It tasted as if they use a cheap brand because it had a very... oceany taste.\\n\\nI find most people get those god awful specialty rolls that are smothered in calories and other things, and those are always well received because I can only guess all that sauce and cheese and what not covers up the fact that the actual sushi is poorly made. So when I buy plain simple rolls it is so glaringly obvious that the ingredients in the sushi are not properly prepared and the sushi doesn't taste good.\\n\\nReally, the only saving grace was the fact that I went during Happy Hour and didn't pay full price for the sushi.\\n\\n-Back story- I am a sushi chef (yes people you don't have to be Asian to be able to make sushi), so I know what a proper roll should look and taste like.

The CM was good too but by the time I started eating it I was already full. \\n\\nFor dessert the kids shared a brownie shake. It was pretty good but I wish I would have gone with Chelsea's suggestion and ordered the Cookie shake. I personally ordered a Vanilla Vodka chocolate martini. It was delicious but definitely strong. I felt like I was sipping on vodka shots and was not able to finish it. Again, I should have followed Chelsea's advice and ordered it before dinner instead of for dessert.

D has said that they are considering a program where they would open any full bottle, sell half of it to you (decanted) and then use the rest as a by-the-glass \\"special\\" on their chalk board. Of course if you really liked that particular wine you could buy the other half and take it home with you.\\n\\nExcept for one table in the front of the space (4-6 people?), seating is either at the bar or at 2-top steel tables. The service was excellent: helpful, responsive and knowledgeable. The noise level was appropriate.\\n\\nIn general, this is a neighborhood kind of place where you would go for a drink and a small plate or two. L and I both agreed that if we lived in the area, we'd be frequent fliers. The wine was quite reasonably priced. It is easy to rack up a pretty serious bill if you survey a lot of the dishes.

I didn't find it on the menu so I told our server that was what I wanted with fries and a matzo ball soup along with a diet black cherry pop.  She seemed a bit confused but wrote it down carefully.  My husband ordered the corned beef hash with eggs, potatoes, toast, and coffee.\\n\\nThe coffee came strong and hot but rather sloppy as half of it ended up in the saucer.  Our meals arrived next and yet I did not have my pop or soup.  That came after I had several bites of my sandwich.  The soup was probably my favorite thing - it was hot with a rich broth, and the matzo ball was not too dense.  Although, this was my first matzo ball soup experience so I have nothing to compare it to honestly.\\n\\nNow the sandwich.  Ummm, is a corned beef sandwich supposed to be cold?  They \\"technically\\" got it right but it just seemed like they slapped it all together with no love.  Where is the warm beef and pastrami?  Where was the melted cheese?  Why were my fries not hot or even warm?  Why was the meat kind of tough and stringy?  I asked my husband how his meal was and he said it was...interesting.  His potatoes weren't that warm either!
