My wife had fish tacos, which were good but much spicier than she expected, and really spicier than she wanted.

That said, even before we were annoying the staff was professional but cold and unfriendly, as if they had been well trained but didn't particularly like their work or working with people.This was true of the waiter and waitress who served us and of the hostess, who was polite but not kind or warm. The staff also seemed not to know about our reservation, which was surprising but didn't cause any real problems.\\n\\nI guess my take-home message is: the food was fine, the service was professional, but I don't know what would motivate me to go there again.\\n\\nA note about how I rate: It seems to me that people mean very different things by the stars they give in a review. Here's what I mean: 5 stars means that a place is exceptional in some way, special even among very good peers; 4 stars means that the place is very good in every relevant category but not outstanding or exceptional; 3 stars means adequate--a place I would go to again but not great; 2 stars means unacceptable--a place I would not go again because it is seriously deficient in some way; 1 star is horrible, that the place  was not only unacceptable in some way but that it was exceptionally, unforgivably bad. In every case my rating is comparing the place reviewed to similar places-- thus an outstanding diner gets a 5 even though on an absolute scale its food might not be as good as that at a gourmet restaurant."},{"name":"Maanas","address":"1335 Cameron Ave","city":"Lewis Center","stars":"3.5","text":"Experience: My friend and I stopped by Sunday night for dinner.. she ordered a mango lassi and chicken tikka masala, and I ordered the veg-corn soup and tandoori roti.

I ordered the veg samosa instead.. our order came out in a timely fashion. Here is the catch: my water was tap water, yuck. My friend sat facing the kitchen and watched the server pour mango lassi in a small glass cup and then fill the rest with water. I suppose that means my friend now has mango lassi to drink, but a watered mango lassi.. just the one act puts suspiscion as to what else they do ok in the kitchen where customers cannot peer through. Dishonest business Always puts me off, no matter the rest of the experience. \\n\\nFood: Tasty! The filling of the veg samosa appetizer is very similar to a chickpea soup my friend makes a lot. A light curry aroma with every mashed potato, carrots & peas wrapped in it's crispy shell. The tikki chicken masala was delicious, and chicken chunks filled a good portion of the dish (though I am one to prefer more sauce than chicken, which in that case was not too much sauce). Price is average, though I might say the main dishes can drop $1/$2. We are looking at ~ $13 for a smaller portion of chicken masala.

After spending weeks eating mediocre food around Marietta, my trust friend Yelp came to my rescue. Canoe looked like a restaurant that you'd find in New York and California. Located in a surprisingly nice area of Atlanta is where you'll find this gem.\\n\\nRight when you pull up, you'll see that the parking lot is incredibly small. Rest assured because the valet service has got you covered. Once you walk in you'll be welcomed with a full bar to your right, and an expansive dining room. The icing on the cake is their outdoors area, which is right next to the water. If you're looking to grab a couple drinks in the evening, what better place to do that then outside? From the countless times that I've dined here, I've developed a hit list of sorts on what I prefer to order every time I stop by.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nJumbo Lump Crab Cake, Yuzu, Napa Cabbage Slaw ($16) - Pretty large crab cake with chunks of crab inside. The yuzu flavor is an incredible complement to this dish\\n\\nGrilled Australian Octopus, Chorizo, Peppers, Horseradish Tomato Broth ($14) - By far my favorite appetizer here. The octopus is grilled to perfection. Chewy with a nice char, and when combined with the tomato broth, it sends you to a state of euphoria\\n\\nPrince Edward Island Mussels, Chili, Peanut, Ginger, Basmati Rice ($14) - Probably one of my less favorite dishes. The muscles are in a nice broth, but not as memorable as the octopus or the crab cake.\\n\\nEntrees:\\nGrilled Breast of Long Island Duckling, Duck Leg and Ginger Pot Sticker, Bok Choy, Ginger Dashi ($27) - Out of all the dishes that I had, this was the smallest in regards to size. Even so, the dashi paired perfectly with the tender duck.\\n\\nSlow Roasted Carolina Rabbit, Swiss Chard - Bacon Ravioli, Sweet Potato, Candied Garlic Sauce ($29) - This has to be the clear winner as far as dishes at Canoe. The rabbit is amazingly cooked and is juicy. Add in their ridiculous bacon ravioli and, Jesus Christ, this dish is what will sell you on Canoe. \\n\\nHickory Grilled 12oz New York Strip, Crushed Fingerling Potato, Asparagus, Black Garlic Butter ($35) - A huge slab of steak. This strip has a nice char to it and has is flavored to perfection. Not too salty for my taste. Asparagus was a little soggy, but that's not a deal breaker. \\n\\nAs far as service goes, the staff is attentive and gives that nice Southern hospitality that I've come to love. Canoe is a great place to have a nice dinner in Atlanta. The ambiance great for dates, as well as a dinner with coworkers.

I shouldn't stress the negatives, though because the scallops were obviously fresh off the boat and DELICIOUS as was the shrimp.  The shoestring fries obviously fried in fresh oil were a guilty pleasure.  My girlfriend had the fried clams which were a very healthy serving at a fair market price that I forget.

I've had better food in Portland, but paired with the beer, it was a great experience!\\n\\nand unlike many, I like the interior.

The mozzarella sticks were over breaded and over cooked and the marina sauce tasted like they dumped it out of a jar a heated it. My sandwich was below average and had bread that was so thick I thought I was having a bread sandwich instead of a chicken sandwich. Additionally there was nearly no mayo or other condiments so between this and the thick bread it was very dry. The fries were just ok. My wife's sandwich was supposed to have Caesar dressing on it, but there was almost none to be found, so it was also far too big and dry to be considered anything but below average.

I am just reiterating that it's not all that good. The food is fine, not great. And the place is undermined by the attitude of the people who work there (who seem to think that if they act as snobs, then it will justify their acting as snobs). The place is pretty expensive and really not all that special. I reiterate my opinion that this is a place where you go for a special event just to spend money. But, if you're looking to do that, go to Miller Union, Empire State South, Bacchanalia (obviously, much more expensive), or even 246 right around the corner (which costs less and is far better).\\n\\nIncidentally, that Bon Appetit named this place one of the best new restaurants in America convinces me that distinction is really just a marketing scheme, which I've long suspected.\\n\\nHere's what I wrote in my first review almost a year ago:\\nMan was I disappointed when I went to Cakes & Ale last night. I've lived in Decatur for more than three years and spend a lot of time at restaurants, but I've never been to Cakes & Ale. So, I went last night and was totally underwhelmed. The food is fine, but given the hype that surrounds this place, it was a major let-down. As an appetizer, I had the fried oysters, which were very, very good. But, it was downhill from there. I has the orechiette, which was so unbelievably overspiced with red pepper flakes that I cannot reliably tell you what it actually tasted like. The lemon, garlic and parsley shrimp were fine, but nothing to get all hot and bothered about. I personally think the comparable dish at Ecco is better. Dessert was fine (the highly recommended donuts with squash ice cream and pumpkin seed brittle).\\n\\nThe bottom line is that the food is fine, but it is very expensive and is a restaurant with a lot of buzz. So, I think it should be better. Something I had (of the four dishes I tried) should have been jump-up-and-down great. Rather, everything was good and fine but not amazing. This is basically one of those places that people go to on their anniversary or Valentine's Day because it's supposed to be good and has a price tag that testifies to that.

Many Japanese places are opened by non-native people. I guess it is easy to learn to make quasi sushi. As a result, I have my rule of thumb to filter out a big majority of these imposter restaurants. The secret is in the names! If a Japanese restaurant is named after a very well known city, place or phrase, there is a 90% chance that is not a Japanese owned restaurants. I stay away from places calling themselves Tokyo, Kyoto, Sushi, etc. that leaves the rest mostly native Japanese owned place such as Toraya, Shiki. There are few exceptions of course, such as Fugaku and Oishii. But these tend to have decent food too. I figured if they can't even come up with an authentic name to represent the restaurant, they may not do well with the food too. After all Japanese people are extremely detail oriented. This would be a good telltale sign.\\n\\nSome of the authentic examples of Shiki are: the owner makes cute simple Ikebana styled flower arrangement for every table daily; the center wall art piece is seasonal which corresponds to the name of this place - Shiki means the four seasons; the Izakaya style was the first of its kind opened years ago in Boston; they offer a New Years special meal just as the way it would have been done in Japan.\\n\\nAs a true Japanese establishment, Shiki's service is always attentive and polite. Some times they can be a little slow if short staffed, but they are always extremely pleasant. \\n\\nThe food is decent. I have eaten at great places in NYC, San Francisco and Asia. Shiki's food is not that spectacular in comparison. But then again I have yet to find a super authentic and tasty Japanese place in Boston.

You are also expected to bus your own table including separating the utensils, plates and trash into separate containers. Not a great experience. For dining out and eating there the experience is not on par with places like Famous Daves. \\n\\nIn summary good quality food but beyond that it has an equivalent service experience very much the same as fast food, but at a much higher price point.

I come here at least once a month for the UCF fights that are pay-per-view. I'd rather spend like $30 on food for my girlfriend and myself than $65 for the fights at home. I have an unpleasant experience every now and again, because of the sometimes just awful staff, but since I'm here so often, I notice that the turnover rate is pretty high, so the bad people don't usually last too long. \\n\\nThe number one thing I get here in the wings. They're dreadfully overpriced, but the quality is usually there, and they have so many dang flavors that I never really get bored of them. Usually, if your sports bar offers fairly priced wings, some of them end up being too small or to fatty. No beuno. You won't have that problem here. \\n\\nThe appetizers are really where it's at, though. They have good ones at good prices, and they have like three different varieties of samplers. I LOVE samplers. They're like sports bar tapas. So good.\\n\\nThe interior is one of the betters ones I've ever seen in a BWW, honestly. There are two giant projectors on the main wall that can be split up into eight separate screens. There are more than enough screens in their outdoor seating. And they're just starting to add in arcade stuff like air hockey and ping pong. Fun stuff. \\n\\nBottom line, I don't ever come here for non-sporting event reasons. I just cant justify the price in those cases. I'm not only paying for good, quality wings when I come here. I come for convenience and a fun atmosphere. As for other sports bars that offer the fights, the only other competition BWW has around these parts, in my opinion, would be Gator's Dockside, but their staff is usually very rude and it's usually worth dealing with them."},{"name":"Pho 2000","address":"198 Adams St","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4","text":"The pho here is fantastic.

I came here because of Creative Loafing burger week and got the Harvey Burger and potato wedges. They were okay, nothing to write home about. It's a kale bone burger with lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, a pickle, mustard, ketchup, and barbecue sauce. I don't typically mix sauces like that on my burgers, but this mix somehow seemed to work. I'm not sure what exactly kale bone is, but it sort of tastes like those Morningstar veggie burgers. Also of note, they serve water room temperature, which again reminded me of summers at my grandmothers house when you come inside after playing outside for hours and you expect ice water and all she gives you a warm cup of water.\\n\\nI'd come back and try other foods, as I lean more towards eating vegetarian anyway.

At first glance it looks like an antique & craft store.  Once inside and as you proceed to walk either around  to the left or the right of all the neat items for sale, you are surprised by this tranquil area where there are 12 tables so elegantly set up.  The beautifully light chandeliers deliver a fancy ambiance paired with the eloquent lace table cloths, mix matched chairs, all the way down to the mix matched tea cups & saucers & silverware it all just takes you away - back to childhood. It's absolutely perfect for a tea party and Diane has the Victorian hats and sashes for playing dress-up while having your spot of tea. Or relax, you'll spend plenty of time looking around their shop for as you look around you'll see something new every time you scan the walls.  \\n\\nTheir hours of operation are Tuesday thru Saturday opening at 11:30am.  Tuesday and Wednesday they close at 4pm. Thursday and Friday they have a Dinner Special which changes weekly and served from 4pm to 8pm.  Saturday they are open until 4pm.\\n\\nOn to Diane's Menu! First and For Most  - all items are home made and all veggies & fruits ARE WASHED before cooked!!!  Something you don't see on menu's of major restaurants or really know for sure they do.  \\n\\nThe MUST ORDER or Specialty of Diane's are her Quiche's and Scones with De Cream!!  Perfectly portioned, priced, and a parade on your taste buds! \\n\\nHer Quiche's are anything but the norm.  Diane serves a deep dish quiche which has more of the content than it does egg. Just to name a couple she cooks up, Portabella Mushroom,  Asparagus, Spinach & Bacon and my favorite is the Chicken, Ham, and Brie Quiche, or should I say pie.  Each bite is full of chicken, ham, and brie, the egg holds it together along with the cheese and the pie crust adds just the perfect texture!  Plus she has some secrets in her cooking. Not only but also she makes sure you get your fruits by serving each dish with at least one piece if not several kinds of fruit, including watermelon, grapes, chocolate covered strawberry, and cantaloupe.  Did I mention you also have your choice of salad?  Pick from her homemade Green Bean & Tomato, Cucumber & Onion, Broccoli Salad, or Potato salad.  \\n\\nDiane's menu also includes homemade soup (changes weekly) and sandwiches.  My favorite soups - Italian Wedding & Homemade Chicken Noodle, oh and Minestrone, and Potato......    It's a hard choice when trying to decide between her homemade egg salad, chicken salad, or tuna salad sandwich.  Deli & pressed sandwiches are available too!  **I'm starting to get hungry now***\\n\\nWhen you come to a tea room you have to have the traditional tea and scone. At Diane's you have plenty of options when choosing a hot tea. Matter of fact there are approximately 40 different ones available.  She serves I think 5 different scones, each comes with it's own serving of devinshire cream and like her Quiche, Diane's scones have a secret to them and you can taste the difference when comparing them to anyone else.  She has a Blueberry, Chocolate Orange Zest Walnut, and my favorite Cranberry Orange Zest...   my mouth is watering now!!!!\\n\\nThursday's & Friday's - the best days of the work week (Friday eve & pay day).... And the two evenings of the week when Diane dishes some of her traditional family dinners such as Cabbage Rolls, Homemade Lasagna, Stuffed Pork Chops, Stuffed Shells, Goulash, Pork Roast, and many more!!!  You have to be on the email list to get the heads up on the weeks special, otherwise be surprised :)\\n\\nThey do offer a handful selection of beer & wine - she has Mimosa's too!\\n\\nAfter writing this up, I know where I am going for lunch today & maybe dinner too! \\n\\nHere I come Diane's Creations & Tea Room!"},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place was unique as was some of their food selections like elk burgers but still American comfort food enough to satisfy any Joe.

Always smiling, attentive and knew the menu well and made great recommendations. We had the Wheel of Nosh for 2 ppl.  4 hors d'oeuvres each on the wheel-loved the tuna tartare with mango, chicken drummette and prawn with spicy XO sauce. All had great flavours.  However, I thought the 4th hors d'oeuvre was odd.  It was a savory macaroon which I didn't really care for and I classify a macaroon a dessert rather than an appetizer.  Overall very creative (on the pricey side), but great Asian fusion twist with great flavours. We also ordered the grilled 8oz AAA striploin.  It was done perfectly medium rare with perfect seasoning. We also had the Shroom (wild mushroom w/udon in silken tofu cream)...very smooth-so good and for $6 really good!  We also ordered the dynamic duo (rice battered brussel sprouts & cauliflower w/some kind of blue cheese crumble) Nicely done, didn't feel heavy and all sorts of flavours came through amazingly. My husband doesn't eat veggies and he ended up eating quite a bit as well. \\nCocktail: My husband ordered the Seoul of Caesar. My husband loves Caesars and has tried all different varieties and sizes all over town.  He thought this one was unfortunately off as it was in a small glass & was expecting more excitement from a $10 Caesar.\\nMy husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and I had added that to the comment section when making the opentable reservation.  I didn't expect anything from the restaurant and even forgot I had made that notation until Alessya brought out a chocolate brownie with fresh raspberry swirl & wished us a happy anniversary.

This particular IHOP, located on Clairmont Rd. near I-85, is packed on weekend mornings.  It's small, so you'll be sitting snug and rather close to your dining companions and neighbors.  It can also get loud.\\n\\nIHOP specializes in pancakes and breakfast foods, but also offers burgers, sandwiches, and salads.  The pancakes are indeed tasty and come in many different varieties from breakfast combos to twists on the traditional pancake.  Examples include the red velvet pancakes and tiramisu pancakes, complete with icing and whipped cream.  Nothing beats the original buttermilk pancakes, though.\\n\\nI usually spring for the classic breakfast meals such as the Pick-A-Pancake combo or the \\"Two x Two x Two\\" combo.  A single order of pancakes comes with 4-5 pancakes, which is a lot pancake for one meal.  I prefer the variety of the combos.  The Pick-A-Pancake combo comes with two pancakes (any style, your choice), two eggs, two pork sausage links (or two strips of bacon), and hash browns.  The Two x Two x Two combo comes with two buttermilk pancakes, two eggs, and two sausage links.\\n\\nIHOP's meals are filling.  They're certainly not healthy, loaded with sugar and grease, but it's a typical, comforting American breakfast.  The pancakes are sufficiently fluffy and flavorful.  The sausage, bacon, and hash browns are a bit salty and oily.  If you want to eat healthy, then order a salad or omelette or try one of the pancakes with fruit, such as the strawberry and banana pancake or the grain and nut pancake with blueberries and banana.\\n\\nThe syrup flows freely here, so be prepared for sticky syrup bottles, sticky silverware, and other sticky surfaces in general.\\n\\nI've tried bites of the Belgian waffles and the French toast.  They're okay and remind me of waffles and French toast you can find at hotel breakfast buffets.  Like the pancakes, they're served in generous portions.  The Belgian waffle is large and can be topped with fruit (do it).  If syrup isn't enough, the French toast is additionally sweetened with powdered sugar and comes with a clump of soft, whipped butter.\\n\\nThey serve crepes too, though I've yet to try any.\\n\\nService is good.

The staff was extremely accommodating, and the per-person price was excellent.   They did a great job.  We asked around at many different places, and they are much more flexible in what they offer by comparison.\\n\\nFood served buffet-style at parties -- cooked en masse and sitting in chafing dishes warmed with sterno cans -- is not so forgiving, but their experience with this sort of event shows.  The staff was very attentive to detail and made sure everything was warm and didn't run out; another example: they were carving a large piece of roasted meat and made sure to carve it in a way so all pieces guests got were nice and medium rare (unless requested more well done).\\n\\nAnyway, the catered food by itself would be about a 3.5-4 (by buffet party food standards) -- it was all very traditional and conventional, but it was appropriate for the occasion.  The extra star is for their value and flexibility.  As I mentioned, we looked at several other places, and for the price we were able to get a much better package.  Event spaces tend to have a much larger minimum ($3-5k min) and other restaurants would most likely have provided just hors d'oeuvres rather than a dinner buffet.  Also, they were extremely flexible and accommodating in the details of our party while most event hosting spaces and restaurants have rather rigid policies for private parties.

When 30-40 minutes ticked by, we saw hungry diners rolling in. It got busier as it got closer to dinner time.\\n\\nThe things we ordered:\\n\\n-Oysters ($0.99/pc-3.5/5): Nice and plump. Doesn't taste the freshest but with some lemon and other condiments, it's just as good as the ones at Joe Fortes\\n\\n-Tan Tan Ramen (3/5-$9.99): Thick creamy broth with quite some spice. The noodles were way overcooked, so I had to minus points for that\\n\\n-Takowasa (3.5/5-$4.99): My first time trying takowasa so nothing to compare it to. I like the texture of the octopus bits. You get a strong hit of wasabi if you eat it on its own but if you roll it in the seaweed, it will mellow out. Not a big fan of this. Just my person preference\\n\\n-Mango California Roll (2/5-$6.99): Though it's happy hour, this price for this quality is a no no. There's no sweetness from the mango and the cali roll was just not up to par\\n\\n-Spicy Tuna (4/5-$5.99): This was the highlight of the night. Must get this! Maybe two even! The tuna was melt in your mouth and the sauce wasn't overpowering. Very refreshing as well.\\n\\n-Chili short ribs (3.5/5-$5.99): Not fall off the bone but it was tender. There's some chili paste smeared on top. One of the tastier dishes of that night\\n\\n-Spicy Calamari (3/5-$5.99): Maybe it was at the end of the meal, but I felt like we got a fairly decent portion of calamari. It wasn't spicy like its name. I did come with a sweet & spicy dipping sauce. They were average\\n\\n-Extensive cocktail menu, though, I felt that the actual menu was downsized a bit. I like how they mention the alcohol percentage for each cocktail so you know what you're getting. Oddly, I ordered the lychee iceberg from the 'virgin mocktails' page with an option to add 2 shots of sake which I did, but I didn't feel the slightest buzz. So....

And the bar is new to the space and it is a good looking bar.  They offer specialty drinks along with the ale and wine they serve, and I guess we should not have gone for something so specialty, because it was obviously hard to make these supposed swanky drinks.  The bartender was about to die behind the bar - and when you are called cakes and ALE, I would suggest you get two bartenders.  The specialty drinks took at least 10 minutes to come out and one was too sour (supposed to be pineapple taste - but was more lemon) and the other one was very nice and fresh- a gin type mojito- but lord, it took less time to drink them than to get them.\\n\\nAs for the food- I felt it was good, but not damn good.  The okra appetizer was by far my favorite and I opted for a greek salad with very fresh tomatoes and the mini-blt apps.  Both were nice.  Two in our group got the 16$ gnocchi and it was very fresh and had nice okra, tomatoes, and corn in it...a good summer-y meal.  Another in our group got the half chicken with polenta. The chicken was extremely moist but then so was the polenta- in fact the polenta was almost soupy and tasted more like buttered grits.  But that was it.  A white dish with no color - chicken and grits.  Could have put a raddish on there or something.  And I know the chef hates me for this, but it looked boring as heck.  \\n\\nThe beers we got were all very good and different (Allagash White, Highland Brew Porter and a Stout of some other name...)and of course, we were not hungry at the end to get a \\"cake\\" - so maybe we missed out on the true meaning of the place...the alcohol and the cakes.

Also, while the crust was quite tasty, it was really too hard to accompany the soft cheese topping and made eating it quite difficult.  The Baklava was ok.

Thankfully, it's about a 10 minute walk from my apartment.\\n\\nThe best way to find Ball Square Cafe is to look for the line of patrons waiting under the heat lamps. You may be skeptical of a semi-long wait outside in the winter, but those heat lamps do their job - often times, I am sweating before I even get inside.\\n\\nOne of my least favorite things about brunch in the city is the wait - if you're going to a decent place, you will wait at least 30 minutes, with nothing to do. Ball Square takes care of you from the second you get there. Have a friend secure your spot in line, and walk inside to the back where there's a huge coffee station with a bunch of roasted flavors, iced coffee, iced tea, and a really fun selection of teas. Take your to-go cups back outside and happily sip while you plan your feast, using the full menu displayed on the windows. The owner, Mike, summons you by party number. I highly recommend going here in pairs. One time, my boyfriend and I completely dodged the wait, passing large groups of Tufts kids. Ha-ha, suckers!!\\n\\nOnce you're inside, and know what you want, there's a mere 10 minutes before your food is served. And it's delicious:\\n- Carmelized banana french toast with homemade whipped cream: pheomenal. fluffy. 4 huge slices.\\n- Get any of the french toasts, you really can't go wrong: banana & cream cheese stuffed, banana & nutella stuffed, and so on.\\n- Celtic Green Omlette: very fresh, although we couldn't find our goat cheese very easily.\\n- I have yet to try the Eggs Benedict dishes but did order a single poached egg that was great.\\n- Veggie sausage: I forgot it was veggie.\\n- Banana Walnut pancakes: a little dry, but order some Vermont maple syrup and you're set.\\n- Corn muffin: we got it grilled, but it was still a too dry\\n\\nYour portions will be big.

The roti canai was really hyped up to be this great, fluffy dish but it honestly looks and tasted like frozen roti prata/canai that you can buy (20 per pack for less than $5) at any Asian store. I expected it to be handmade and was looking forward to a personal rendition of a \\"Roti Canai\\" by the chef but was presented a sad, frozen counterpart. And for $3 for one piece of roti canai and lackluster curry? It was really sad but perhaps it's because I grew up eating actual roti canai and know the difference between which is frozen or handmade. \\nThank goodness I ordered the Laksa which was a satisfactory dish but nothing like what laksa is. The spice level was almost non-existent but I will say that the soup was delicious. The Laksa also came with a generous amount of shrimp, which was good.

The black-and-white square tile and functioning jukebox gives it a slight 50's feel, although truth be told, I discovered it used to be a Latino nightclub. And I'm not really sure if those even existed in the 50's.\\n\\nOur server Kristen brought out our iced teas while I perused the menu. I knew I wanted a sandwich, but I also could not pass up their acclaimed soups. Especially when they're served in bread bowls. Fortunately, they offer a 1/2 Sandwich & Soup combo.  I had been toying with the idea of an \\"Orgy\\" (Warm peppered pastrami, Swiss, coleslaw, Russian dressing, served on marble rye.), but I got distracted by the \\"Second Deadly Sin\\" (Smoked turkey, bacon, Swiss, fried avocado, sprouts, green goddess mayo). It was the fried avocado that convinced me, natch. For my soup, I went with Kristen's recommendation to Errol: the roasted tomato. Errol opted for the \\"Cleopatra\\" (Havarti, marinated artichokes, black olives, poblanos, cucumber, sprouts, avocado, roasted garlic mayo). This comes with a Vegan option with no cheese or mayo, with a hummus substitute. That sounds amazing just typing it. \\n\\nWhen it comes to the sandwich, the first word that comes to mind is \\"fresh\\". The second is \\"delicious\\". The turkey was shaved and stacked perfectly; the bacon and fried avocado mixed beautifully; the sprouts made me feel healthy. The hoagie bread was the right selection for this sandwich (versus white or wheat). \\n\\nEven though I'm a clam chowder fan, and the broccoli beer-cheese soup\\ninfused with Shiner Bock was all but holding me down and force feeding itself to me, I stayed strong and was quite happy with my warm, delectable roasted tomato. This is probably the best tomato soup I've ever had, to be honest. This is the one soup served in a bowl (with an option to pour into a bread bowl), only because--as Kristen explained--its marginally thinner consistency might seep through the bread. And some people's entire world would fall apart if it did, I guess. It did just fine in Errol's bread bowl. In fact, it poured in fabulously.\\n\\nAs we enjoyed our supper, we of course lapsed into our foodie talk. Errol suggested a trip to Barley Swine to order all the desserts. I bookmarked Lenoir and Russian House. Melissa A. showed up and we planned a Saturday brunch after Keri completes the gorilla run. Someone was discussing the merits of vagitarianism (I didn't misspell that) with Deji M. And of course at the head of the table, Keri enjoyed her birthday Orgy.\\n\\nI wouldn't mention my stop in the men's restroom if it hadn't been for a huge billboard over the urinals that read \\"El Lobo Nightclub\\", and depicted a wolf drinking a Corona. Either that was the name of the former Latino club Gourmands now occupies, or they have an incredibly random sense of bathroom decor. \\n\\nThey have purse hooks under the tables. Apparently, this is a big \\"thing\\".\\n\\nOur server was quite attentive, and the manager (owner, maybe?) kept spirits high and thanked us for our business. Conversely, I say thank you to Gourmands. You know. For existing. \\n\\nJason's Deli what? Panera Bread who? There's only one soup and sandwich place for me these days, and I'll drive from NW Austin all the way to E. 7th if I have to to get it. \\n\\n5 Stars...both for the venue and company, of course."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I absolutely looove the Veggie BLT.

I am also not from Boston although I come here on business.  Having written that, I'm afraid First Printer is not a place I plan to return to.\\n\\nWe were greeted very warmly when we came in by the hostess as well as our server.  One minor glitch in our order which was fixed immediately and accurately, which is the sign of good service.\\n\\nThe menu, which our server explained changes regularly -- both because they use ingredients grown within 90 miles of Cambridge and because they have a new chef -- is about 90% seafood.  Being allergic to seafood, this limited my options (I didn't choose the place otherwise would've suggested another place).  But there were several options on what is a pretty short menu from which to choose.\\n\\nOverall, the food was real comfort food -- not a lot of healthy options; there was a mixed green salad and a caesar salad, but that was about it.  I ended up getting a burger with gruyere cheese, which was probably the greasiest burger I've ever had in my life.  Oh, don't get me wrong, it was unbelievably delicious and I ate the whole thing, but aside from being sure I'd have a heart attack on my way back to the office, it was disgusting to try to handle it in front of a group.  Fortunately, I knew them well, but my hands were swimming in grease and my napkin quickly became pretty gross.   I thought the fries were pretty good (someone below didn't care for them), but they were pretty over cooked.  Not burned, just more overcooked than I care for. I will also say that I felt rotten for the rest of the day -- it did a number on my stomach. Nothing amiss with the food, just a ton more grease than I'm accustomed to.\\n\\nOthers in our party had the hush puppies, salad, grilled cheese -- and a blueberry tart a la mode for dessert (I didn't try any of these).  People seemed fine with what they got, but no one was raving as one does at a restaurant when one is really enjoying a given dish or meal.\\n\\nFinally, there weren't that many people around at lunchtime, but it was still challenging to hear each other, so I imagine if you were to go for a meal and it were packed it'd be necessary to shout a bit."},{"name":"Giovanni's Pizza & Roast Beef","address":"62 Maple St","city":"Danvers","stars":"4","text":"Good buffalo chicken calzones that will make you want to diet after you eat it, even if you were starving to death. 4 out of 5, it's pretty damn good for a calzone, but that's all I've had from here.

The veggie burger is out of this world. It will run you about $11 bucks for lunch and about $14 bucks for dinner for the burger. If you do eat meat, trying their veggie burger will make you want to get it every time. The burger is made of oats and a sauce. It has the usual lettuce, tomato, and onion condiments and a hamburger bun with sesame. I only get the fries as my side (it is smaller thin fries) and usually dip it in honey mustard.

I'm surprised it took this many years for another hot pot place to open on Buford Highway ITP (inside the perimeter) considering the humble Mini Hot Pot near Chamblee Tucker Road has been around since 2004 and several popular and successful hot pot places have subsequently opened OTP (outside the perimeter) in Gwinnett County.\\n\\nFor the uninitiated, at Chinese hot pot restaurants, you are served a pot of broth which is heated to a boil on a stove at your table. This is served with a variety of raw meats, vegetables, and other foods which you cook yourself in the broth at the table. It makes for a fun, customizable, and interactive dining experience. Hot pot is popular throughout Asia. Japan has its own version called shabu-shabu.\\n\\nA couple things differentiate Little Sheep from other hot pot restaurants in metro Atlanta such as Mini Hot Pot, J's Mini Hot Pot (formerly Mini Hot Pot 2, same owner), Gom Shabu-Shabu, Shabu & Shabu, and Shabu Shabu Plus.

At the other places, each individual gets his/her own hot pot (hence \\"Mini\\" Hot Pot).\\n\\nNote: Little Sheep, Mini Hot Pot, and J's Mini Hot Pot are Chinese owned and operated. Gom Shabu-Shabu, Shabu & Shabu, and Shabu Shabu Plus are Korean owned and operated.\\n\\nLittle Sheep costs $18.95 (plus tax and tip) per person. A minimum of two people is needed to order (single diners must pay $20.95) and there is a two-hour time limit. I'm not sure how strictly the time limit is enforced and think it's there mainly to prevent excessive abuse of the AYCE format. Two hours is more than enough time to get multiple extra orders in and fill your belly. $18.95 is a good value considering it's AYCE and the menu has a plethora of tasty items to choose from.\\n\\nEvery hot pot starts with the broth. Each pot can be divided into two partitions so you can try two different types of broth per pot. The three broth types are: spicy, \\"nutrition,\\" and and plain. I've tried all three and prefer the spicy and nutrition broths. The spicy broth is the most flavorful and oiliest of the broths. It's dark red in color, presumably made with chili oil, and also contains whole red chilis. Both the nutrition and plain broths are milky white in color. The nutrition broth is prepared with various herbs and vegetables, moreso than the plain broth. The nutrition broth is light and subtly aromatic.\\n\\nMeat options included in the $18.95 AYCE base price are sliced lamb, beef, pork, and chicken breast, beef tripe, pork liver, pork intestine, cuttlefish balls, \\"pork luncheon meat,\\" lamb meatballs, fish fillets (unsure of the type of fish, I think it's tilapia), beef heart, pork heart, and shrimp balls. I like the sliced beef and pork, lamb meatballs, and filling-stuffed cuttlefish balls. I do not recommend the lunch meat. :)\\n\\nOther items such as shrimp, squid, pork blood, cow tongue, scallops, and mussels cost about $3-5 extra each. An egg is $1 extra. At the other places, eggs are included. Also, Little Sheep doesn't carry some ingredients which the other places do such as octopus and lobster tail (Shabu & Shabu) and snow crab leg (J's Mini Hot Pot). However, in the end, I'm not complaining because I think Little Sheep's AYCE is a reasonable deal.\\n\\nThere are over 20 vegetables to choose from including basic vegetables like tomatoes and corn and Asian vegetables such as watercress, pickled veggies, wood ear fungus, winter melon, taro, lotus root, and tung ho (which I like to call Chinese arugula). I don't think there's a bad vegetable on the menu. I'm partial to the wood ears, watercress, and tung ho. Napa cabbage works well in hot pot too.\\n\\nA great thing about Little Sheep are the individual cooked foods you can order that are not part of the hot pot, but included in the AYCE meal. These include xiaolongbao (soup dumplings, \\"steamed soup buns\\" on menu), youtiao (Chinese crullers, \\"fried dough\\" on menu), and other different kinds of dumplings, buns, and pancakes. This makes the AYCE worth it. I recommend the soup buns, scallion pancake, sweet sesame pancake, and red bean paste pancake.\\n\\nCook, experiment, and don't forget to try the sauces.\\n\\nThe restaurant is spacious and clean. I estimate seating capacity is about 80+. Great for groups.\\n\\nOverall, Little Sheep Hot Pot exceeded my expectations in terms of the freshness and quality of food, level of service, and even little things like how well-ventilated and adequately air-conditioned the restaurant is. The service I've experienced has been friendly and attentive."},{"name":"Dosa n Curry","address":"447 Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Ordered delivery from this place. Took about 40 minutes but I knew that when I ordered. Ordered the masala dosa and idli with sambar. The dosa was a bit soggy but that's because it's meant to be eaten as soon as it comes off the tava/stove. The taste was great, def tasted like a dosa should. The sambar was delicious and tangy. The idli was good, too, but the sambar that came with it was very different. It was much thicker and tasted like dal more than sambar.

This restaurant is tucked in a little bit off the street, with lots of people milling about on weekend evenings. The restaurant is located right next to their new bakery, which I'm excited to go back and try. If you want a table, make sure you make a reservation since they don't seem to have space for walk-ins. Tip: If you don't have a reservation, try hovering by the bar. You can order the full dinner menu from the bar! \\n\\nThe menu is ever changing for seasonal ingredients. We started with the conserved tuna with carrot, avocado and coriander. It was light with subtle flavors, which was refreshing because of the Atlanta heat. I had the striped bass baked in parchment paper that came with saffron, tomato, and shell pea salad. Can I just say the presentation was amazing? I've seen the baking-in-parchment paper trick on Top Chef Masters, but it was definitely more impressive in person. The server asked if I wanted it unwrapped for me and then he added the veggies on top. It looked delicious and tasted even more delicious. The striped bass was baked on top of lemon slices and that citrus kick made all the difference. My friend had the pork ribs with polenta and muscadine. I'm not sure I tasted the muscadine, but the creamy polenta balanced out the salt in the pork ribs nicely and the pork ribs were super tender. For dessert we shared the lavender layer cake with raspberry buttercream. The cake tasted just the slightest bit soapy, but if you combined it with the buttercream it really took away that soapiness. I still scarfed down the cake, so obviously it didn't bother me. If we had arrived earlier, I might have opted to get something from their bakery next door.\\n\\nThis place has a great dishes with extremely fresh ingredients.

This place used to be the go-to place in Atlanta for Dim Sum.  As Royal China, there was a lull where the quality of service and food dipped...but I'm glad to say that Royal China is back to where Honto once was.\\n\\nI recently went the Sunday after Christmas for dim sum with a party of 20.  They were able to accomodate our party very quickly.  Before we even got to sit down, we were already bombarded by several dim sum carts.  Now that's service!  We probably spent a good two hours enjoying the food, and we racked up quite a large bill.  Those of you who know understand that dim sum is not that expensive, but we just kept on eating and eating.  We even had two caucasian guests with my Asian family, and they enjoyed the meal.\\n\\nThings that were particularly tasty were the har gow (shrimp dumplings).  They were hot, tender, and very delicious.  The cheong fun (rice noodle roll) were also very good.  We had pork and beef at our table although we did want to try the shrimp.\\n\\nThe only thing we didn't enjoy was this one very young male waiter.  He would acknowledge our requests for things such as more tea, additional plates, forks, etc...but he would never come back to take care of them.  My uncle (a former employee of Honto) had to get up on two occasions to let the owner know that he wasn't on the ball.  It's nice to go when you have people who know people:-)\\n\\nFor those that have never had dim sum, you're going to encounter a lot of pork and shrimp.  If that isn't for you, you should probably stay away.  Think if dim sum as Chinese tapas; small plates for everyone to share.  If this sounds like your cup of tea (pun intended), head on down to Royal China on a Saturday or Sunday morning for a great dining experience."},{"name":"Market Dunya","address":"35 Lebanon St","city":"Malden","stars":"3","text":"Did delivery via Foodler.

Perhaps the fault lies with the fact that my expectations were pretty high based on reviews and posts by friends I had seen online. \\n\\nI walked into Dai Due expecting mind blowing food - the interior of the restaurant itself reaffirmed this belief as it blended a butcher-shop store front with bright white lights that quickly morphed into a cozy, intimate restaurant on the back. It was a very unique image. \\n\\nThe food though wasn't all that unique. We ordered the meat plate, which was delicious - especially the ham (never thought I would say that). I know most people say the ceviche is the way to go so perhaps the mistake is on my part for rejecting what most people recommend. For main course, I had the beef rib served over a bed of kim-chi. The kim chi was neither spicy or sour. It bordered on this semi-sweet taste, which I think is how American's like it because that's also the same way it's served at Whole Foods. The beef rib was huge and easily fell of the bone with a gentle pull, but it tasted like any old beef rib I could get at a BBQ joint in Austin. Lastly, we had the kale au gratin....it was par for the course as well. We finished the meal with a pecan, apple crumble pie. The pie, while delicious, was served cold. I would think warming it up might be better, but it was still good so I can't complain that much. \\n\\nMy girlfriend believes I might've been a victim of high expectations and poor ordering.

The parking lot is plentiful and we didn't have a problem self-parking. Walking in, you could tell that this restaurant is going for a feel of an upscale steakhouse vibe but set in the woods. Everything is very nearly done, and the decorations (complete with long canoe hanging at the entrance) is all to make you feel like you're surrounded by the river. We were seated at a nice big comfortable booth, despite it only being two of us, which was nice as it allowed us to have enough room for our stuff, even though it was a bit of a challenge getting in and out of the booth. Now the service was great - I'd expect a bit more for the prices you pay here, but there was no rudeness and our table staff did their jobs well. Even allowed us to walk outside with our drinks - wish they had lights around the river to see at night - kinda bummed that it was so dark you couldn't see anything. The reason I docked one star though wasn't for the ambience or the service - it was the food.

I feel sorry for these guys having to work in the service industry in Westlake, but I digress...\\n\\nI have been 4 times during lunch and the service experience/observation is consistent when I am with my family (4 people total).\\n\\nOne of the problems that I see is that it seems none of the waitstaff actually \\"own\\" the table. What I mean by that is you'll have one person seat you and take a drink order, a different person may take your food order, a different person may then bring your food. At first that seems great. It seems like you are getting taken care of by the whole restaurant. The big restaurants get this right, BUT where that falls apart here is that if there is a problem or if you need something like a refill, no one is readily available to help you. One person isn't taking the responsibility to ensure your satisfaction during your entire stay.\\n\\nI went in once at 1:30pm, placed my order then saw my \\"waiter\\" take a seat at the bar and start eating a bowl of food.

A nice guy behind the bar helped me get my order correct and glanced a few choice looks to my \\"waiter\\" which unfortunately went unnoticed.\\n\\nThe food is good though and I might go back by myself for the food alone.

The first time we met Chris was for a tasting in December 2016.  Chris's food was delicious.  Everything we tasted was better than the last.  This guy can cook.  We were very excited when we settled on our final menu that include Mediterranean chicken, Beef Tenderloin, Lemon potatoes, street corn and truffle Mac and Cheese.  Chris had catered events at the venue we chose and was aware of the facilities on site. he assured us all would be great.  The food would be served family style to expedite service.  \\nIn the months that followed we had several questions for Chris and some adjustments.  Each time we contacted Chris he seemed annoyed and impatient.  At one point he told us that he wished we had hired a wedding planner.  He often forgot agreement we had made and we had to resend emails we had sent previously to remind him of agreements.\\nOn the day of the event he arrived late and was immediately irritated with the flowers and greenery on the tables, insisting that there wasn't room to place his dishes.  We told him to do his best and that we understood.  It turned out there was plenty of room and his servers did a great job of getting the food to the tables.\\nNow to the food.  First of all everything that came out of the kitchen was cold.  I don't mean simply warm, I mean cold.  I made Chris aware of it immediately.  His response was to tell me that it was hot when it left the kitchen.  You must understand that the trip from the kitchen to the table was about 40 feet.  Certainly not enough time to get cold.  When I questioned his response he simply shrugged his shoulders and walked away.  The quality of the food was poor.  The tenderloin was cooked to death and in tiny thin slices with large strands of grizzle running through it.  It looked awful when it hit the table.  How does this leave the kitchen?  Again when I asked Chris about it, he said some of the tenderloin was not as good as he had hoped. Really???  I asked him if there was any tenderloin left that might be better.  He checked, and came back with piece about the size of a golf ball.  It was as hard as a rock and as dry as a desert.  He would have been better off telling me there wasn't any left.  When I spend this kind of money I expect the quality to be excellent.  At the tasting, the tenderloin was in thick, medium rare slices.  At the wedding we all got gray, dry deli meat.  Just awful.  The chicken was dry and lacked flavor and had none of the olives and artichoke hearts we experienced at the tasting.   Only the truffle mac and cheese tasted like we remembered.  But it was cold.\\nI would highly recommend you avoid using Chris for your catering needs.  He is hard to work with and delivers sub-par results.  I cannot express how disappointed we were in what we served to our guests.\\nWe were even more disappointed in his lack of response or caring about our concerns.  \\nThe only reason i give him two stars is because of his staff.  They were excellent.  They worked fast and were friendly and attentive.  It wasn't their fault the food was cold and awful.  I was especially impressed with the bartender.

The only problem I had was that when you walk in the front door there is no hostess table so there you are in the middle of the room with diners all around you, looking stupid. This place has a lot of really great reviews so I'm willing to try again but for me, this was not a great experience.\\n\\nThis is the first place I've been to that offered a free appetizer with a check-in and we took the hummus. I have to say that it was absolutely delish.  Now, I'm thinking that the reason they did this is so they know who the Yelpers are so they can provide stellar service. Well, the service was friendly but I never got a refill on my water. It's OK because after the lamb and hummus, I was stuffed.  I had the Lamb Kafta and my partner, a calzone. The kafta is a ground lamb with onions that's pressed onto a skewer and served with rice. The lamb was as dry as a bone, kind of under seasoned and it was really boring and somewhat gristly. There was even an occasional bone. They subbed out the rice with more hummus but charged an extra dollar for it. I couldn't understand that. My mate did say the calzone was very good.\\n\\nI love the decor in this place. It's small and very intimate which was OK because it didn't really feel crampy. That can ruin a place for me, when tables are just inches apart from one another. Conversations are private and I like them to stay that way. It feels very Middle Easternish with traditional Lebanese music, light fixtures, etc. The walls were painted with pillars but artwork is scarce.

Even better they have lunch specials available all week!\\n\\nThe dining room looks great and the restaurant has a great ambience. Service is very friendly and improving as time goes on. \\n\\nI like that this place is kid friendly. My son likes being able to take his water home. \\n\\nWe have been here for lunch on a Sunday twice and did take out on a Friday once. I have to admit dining in is way better than take out , though since they are new we won't write them off completely for take out. We just had a not so good experience. Longer than estimated wait (40+ min total). My veggie dumplings were pork. The wings weren't fully cooked. But the eggplant was amazing at least :)\\n\\nWhen we were there last i got the kung pao chicken. It was the best I'd ever had in Boston even though they forgot the peanuts :)\\n\\nAbove when I mentioned I got pork dumplings instead of veggie ...I usually don't like pork hence ordering veggie but when I got them I was hungry and they were better than any other pork dumpling. Something about their wrapping just made it great. Or I was just starving. :$ I just looove the veggie dumplings ! The green wrapping is delicious and the filling reminds me of the homemade dumplings when I lived in China. \\n\\nTheir general gau chicken is way better than their sesame fyi. There is barely flavor to the sesame. The meat quality for both is better than most places. \\n\\nTheir spring rolls aren't so different from other places but delicious none the less. They also make a pretty great miso soup. \\n\\nThey are a coke place which makes coming even more appealing :)\\n\\nWe only got fortune cookies for take out. Would be nice if we got some for dine in !\\n\\nWe will be back again ! I can't wait to try more off the menu. Maybe some baozi next time.

They also serve a super tasty ted pepper hummus. If you like hummus, try it. \\n\\nThe location is on 1st Street in Sanford, a decent sized location. They offer booth and table seating. I only have been during lunch and it is never busy. The wait staff are friendly and not overbearing.

I have to give the guy credit, he was busting his butt while maintaining a positive attitude. Granted, due to being overwhelmingly understaffed on a busy night, we waited in line about 20-30min.\\n\\nThe place is very cute with nice touches but, if you're going to commit to a old-timey soda fountain theme, you have to select music that coincides. Being subjected to Kelly Clarkson and Jason Derulo cheapens the ambiance, unless your target audience is middle schoolers.\\n\\nMy boyfriend got an egg cream, which he said was good, a standard taste that he's very familiar with. Weird thing was that the seltzer water was taken from a can on the self so it was room temperature. This was odd and, unless they're extremely short on available refrigeration space, easily preventable.\\n\\nI got the cheesecake ice cream, which tasted OK but it left a gross film on the inside of my mouth, likely from the ice cream having too high of a butter fat content.

Walking there, I was all grins as I was very excited at the prospect of such a find so near from where I was staying.\\n\\nNow, I'm all about atmosphere. So upon walking in, I was a little underwhelmed by the decor - typical vintage posters framed and smeared with French words, and... that was about it. The lighting was nice and bright, though, and the table I was sat at had a few lovely touches. Window looking out onto the street. Brown paper menu wrapped around the sort of towel my mother uses in our kitchen (we're French, so I suppose they're authentic enough, though they're probably not so different from the kind your mother uses). The blue typography on the menu contrasted well with the brown of the paper, and matched the blue pattern on the towel. On the right side of the table, a terra cotta pot of rosemary.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the service started off on the wrong foot, or no foot at all is perhaps the better term. I waited several minutes before anyone came my way, and even then the waitress with the water pitcher did not stop to fill my water until I watched her pass my table and I had to call after her.\\n\\nI waited a few more minutes for a waiter to approach me, or my area in general. Noone. Finally, the hostess walked by and before she could pass my table as the other waitress did, I politely asked for the waiter assigned to my table. I was growing unhappier by the minute.\\n\\nYet even if the atmosphere and service are borderline, I will generally allow myself to be persuaded by the food, which is, after all, the real reason why I came.\\n\\nAs soon as the waiter arrived, I ordered the much-sought after escargot, followed by a croque madame with greens on the side. I ordered them the only way I knew how - by pronouncing them properly - but the pronunciation seemed to throw him off initially, or perhaps he was new to the establishment, which would explain why it took him a decade to approach me. Either way, it took a couple of tries for him to finally get the order right.\\n\\nAs was expected, I sat there for quite some time, waiting for the food.\\n\\nThe escargots were finally brought out by another waiter. For all the ladies out there, this waiter was rather attractive. Imagine an Orlando Blooms with black hair. It helped that he was attentive and asked me if he could be of further help. I thanked him and he smiled. Why couldn't the service have started off this way ?\\n\\nNow on to serious matters. The escargots were very good. Not the best I have had, but very good still. The dish was piping hot, just the way I like it, and everything looked right. The black dish, the holes, the escargots swimming in oil, tasty burnt bits on the surface, and lemons to lighten the sauce. To my surprise, there were not one but two cloves of garlic under each escargot. Being a garlic lover, that was very appreciated ! And with a squeeze a lemon, the sauce was almost right - though it could have used a little extra something. The texture of the escargot  pleased me well enough - chewy, but firm. They forgot the small fork that comes with it, but quickly redeemed themselves by bringing it out before I could ask for it.\\n\\nOf course, there was no bread to soak up the lovely sauce, so I had to ask for that. I was amused by the fact that my request seemed to have woken up the waitress in charge of the bread - because she eventually went around and served it to every surrounding table, even the newcomers. Shame that it was cold.\\n\\nLater came the croque madam, which left me very disappointed. The bread was thick and far from toasted. The ham and cheese were thrown atop, and a fried egg reigned over the dish. A thick cream ran down one side of the concoction, but not the other, which prompted me to take my knife and smear part of the cream onto the other side. I probably should have left it alone. I knew this was going to be a heavy dish, but I didn't realize they would thicken everything as much as they could. I was relieved by the greens on the side, but upon further inspection, they also were doused in dressing.\\n\\nEverything was so heavy and greasy, that I couldn't eat more than half of it.\\n\\nSigh.\\n\\nSo what started off as a nice sunny walk on Newbury street ended in a resigned stumble in the rain. I wanted so much to like it. But it just wasn't going to happen. I did, though, satisfy my craving for escargot.\\n\\nPerhaps I'll come back and try one of their lighter fares."},{"name":"Oma's Kitchen","address":"2025 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Love Oma's!

The food was not good. There is so much food in the area that IS good, why bother with this place? We ordered the hush puppies, which were over-fried and greasy. And strangely, didn't taste like any hush puppies I've ever had. Bad mouth feel. I only came in because I saw poutine on the menu.  Now, I didn't ask if the fries were made on site, but TGI Friday's potato skins come to mind when I saw the poutine. Poutine only has three ingrediants: fries, brown gravy, and cheese curds. This was potato skins/fries, a few pieces of cheese of the non curd variety, and NO gravy! There were some onions from a French Onion soup.  I can just hear Gordon Ramsey saying \\"such a shame\\". We didn't finish them, or anything else for that matter. My husband ordered a flat bread pizza since we were told that the menu that brought us in from the street was only the brunch menu. It was neither a pizza nor appetizing. There was some strange sundried tomato sauce on the Margherita pizza, and the flatbread tasted stale. Unfinished.

My family has been a huge fan of the Texas Chili Parlor for years. We love the classic feel and the old wood. It used to be my favorite downtown dive. Now I have noticed a shift over the last four years and it has been in the staff. The waiters and waitresses have become slow and grumpy. Lots of them have worked there for a long time and have become complacent and overly confident in there job security. The two waitstaff that I'm thinking of in particular are the long grey haired man and the chubby blonde woman. They were rude and slow as molasses all night. Literally complaining when we asked them refill our drinks. I had ordered a frozen margarita when she took our drink orders and she brought me one 30 minutes later all watery and gross. The old man with long grey hair brought out our food after about 50 minutes, still no refills on waters or drinks. We asked the grey haired man about refills on our drinks he laughed and said we won't let you parish then walks off without taking our empty glasses. As our waitress scurries past yet again with no refills or acknowledgement of our existence, my sister says hey miss and she turns around and glares at us. \\"Could we please get some refills when you get a chance\\" she says to the chubby blonde waitress. The waitress replies with \\"we are not neglecting you, we are prioritizing\\" and walks off. I'm thinking what is going on here, we never said you were, we just want some drinks please. At this points we just feel abused and afraid to ask for anything else for fear of pissing off the plump blonde woman and the unhappy grey haired wizard. Texas Chili Parlor needs new staff and the manager needs to set up server sections to get the most out of his staff and increase customer service.

Complimentary valet is available.\\n\\nFirst Impression and Front of the House: We were greeted by a hostess and were told it would be a 30-45 minute wait. Happy hour was still going and the restaurant was packed to capacity. Interior is clean and decorated well. Indoor seating was limited. No spots left at the bar. Noisy inside.\\n\\nSeating and Appetizers: After seating, we were promptly greeted by the waiter and offered drinks / appetizers. Happy hour was still going on and we started off with the Queso, Salsa, and Chips. The chips were nice and thick with a good crunch. Salsa was a little on the sweet side, but very good. Queso was amazing. If you like Queso, HIGHLY recommend.\\n\\nThe booth we were seated in was very comfortable. Table was a good size and sturdy. Silverware, appetizer plate, and napkins were clean. We did not partake in alcoholic beverages. Water and ice tea were kept full throughout our dining experience.\\n\\n\\nMain Course: We ordered the mac/cheese and the trout. The trout had a slices of apples, salsa, and walnuts on it, which worked really well. However, the fish was DRY!. I really wanted to like this fish, but the dry flesh and moisture sucking material just ruined the dish. The seasonings, apples, and walnuts would've just made this fish taste perfect if the protein was grilled correctly. I really wanted to like this dish, but unfortunately, there was a defect in the dish.\\n\\nThe mac/cheese with chicken was similar. The mac/cheese was excellent. Cheese sauce had a great mix of flavors with a slight smokiness to it. The macaroni was cooked well - moist and great texture. However, the chicken was also DRY. \\n\\nWhat the hell chefs? Why can't you grill your proteins correctly!?!?  I saw endless dishes flying out the kitchen and maybe ours just happened to be substandard.. Maybe it was the full house that lead to leaving the meats on the grill too long. So disappointing! So much potential lost in these dishes.\\n\\nDesert: We had the oatmeal cookie with caramel sauce and mocha ice cream. The combination of the flavors went well together. The mocha ice cream had a very light flavor to it and was delicious when combined with the cookie and caramel sauce. Excellent dish and highly recommended.\\n\\nIn the end, the meal came out to about $30 / pp. I was satisfied with the dining experience, but was expecting more for a restaurant that has a such a high reputation for making excellent food."},{"name":"Vina Pho & Grill","address":"1630 30th St, Ste B","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"Twice out of the last three times I dined there, the food was spoiled.

The Spatzel was good, but the Rouladen was flipping AMAZING.

I've seen more extensive lists, but they covered all the basics and then some. The wines-by-the-glass were more than affordable ($6 for a Pinot Gregio), and they even had half bottles available in some wines.\\n\\nDeserts - Oh. My. GOD. Apple Strudel. Don't ask any questions. If you've ever loved apple deserts, this will be the best you've ever had. Flaky, sweet, cinnamon-y, and full of large fresh apples.

I've been a Fresa's patron and fan since it's original opening.  We were so excited when they opened their second location on south 1st.  It has quickly become a staple for our family, and we have been frequenting the restaurant weekly.  Today, the restaurant treated us exceptionally poorly.  We (myself, my wife, and our two kids) arrived at 9a to have breakfast.  They told us they had no outside tables, and that they possibly could fit us into one table inside.  We sat down, and received no service for the ensuing 15 minutes.  While we were waiting, the restaurant proceeded to seat two couples (who did not have a reservation) outside and immediately provided them service.  It became clear to us that they were discriminating against us because we were a family and less likely to order alcohol during the World Cup.  We asked why the other couples were able to sit outside, and they lied saying they arrived before us.  We told them we watched the couples walk-up ten minutes after our arrival, and they told us they must have accidentally made a mistake (the table was 14 feet from the hostess stand and the restaurant was virtually empty).  They again told us they had no outside tables, although a waitress separately told us that they did have one more.

Now they're in a much bigger, cleaner, and warmer location in a sort of a strip mall, but bigger.  \\n\\nThe evening before I was flying back to SF, my dad told me I could choose any restaurant I wanted to go to.  Which might not seem like that big a deal, unless you know how my dad dines out.  This is a man who generally despises eating out anywhere that involves waiting to be seated or served.  Which pretty much leaves you with fast food and buffets.  So him saying he would go wherever I wanted was a lovely and thoughtful gesture.\\n\\nI decided not to make him suffer too much and chose Jin Wah.  Since dinner time for my parents is generally before 5pm, I knew we wouldn't have to wait to be seated.  Also, the servers there could be ninjas in another life.  No joke.  They take your order, fill your water, bring you tea, serve your food, fill your water, bring you napkins, bring more food, give you your check,  wrap up your leftovers, and fill your water ALL AT THE SAME TIME.  Ok, maybe I exaggerated a little.  But you get my point, right?  I think they have some sort of tag team thing going on, because there always seems to be multiple people helping at the same time.  Crazy fast.\\n\\nI should probably mention the food.  One of my favorite dishes has to be the Pepper-Salted Calamari!  So good!  Deep fried calamari with just the right blend of salt pepper, mixed with grilled onions and jalapeno peppers.  Yum.  We also had the House Special sizzling platter(pan fried noodles with beef, chicken, seafood, and veggies) Mongolian beef, and some spicy beef noodle soup.  Lots of meat.  I was going to order the tasty looking green beans I saw at another table but my dad objected because he thinks I eat too much \\"rabbit food\\" and should eat more meat so I'm not so cold all the time.\\n\\nStick to the specials and non-American sounding dishes.

The conversation stuck out in my head because it was all about the coffee business, the financials of a coffee shop, policy & procedure in a coffee shop, etc.  It was very \\"how can we methodically run this coffee shop to maximize profit\\" and not very \\"owning a coffee shop is my dream job\\".  At one point I even heard a comment along the lines of \\"We pull 2 shots for size X latte but only need 1.

We have been eyeing if for quite some time, and it always comes up on Yelp.  I would have to say that I didn't think that Ginza was as great compared to Fugakyu's sushi and service, but it was still very satisfying.  The two of us haven't had sushi in a while, and we went a little overboard when ordering.  For an appetizer, we had the Ginza Isobe-Age ($6), which includes \\"salmon, white fish, crabstick, flying fish roe, avocado and shiitake mushrooms wrapped in layers, deep fried with tempura batter and topped with special sauce.\\"  In addition to this, we also had the \\"Yaki-hamaguri,\\" which included broiled cherrystone clams ($10).  Both were very good...the cherrystones were huge, too!  Yumm...\\n\\nWhenever we go out for sushi, we always split a bunch of special maki rolls because every restaurant always has an endless amount of choices!  From the regular makimono menu, we ordered the B-52 Maki, which was described as \\"an outrageous combo of yellowtail and crab stick in a double layers tempura roll\\" for $12.  In addition to this, we ordered the following rolls off the Specials Menu: the Norwegian Maki, the Smokey Mountain Maki, and the Volcano Maki.  They were each very different, and I would have to say that the Smokey Maki and Norwegian Maki were my favorites.  They tasted delicious and were smooth to my palette.  The Volcano Maki was the craziest concoction I have ever seen!  It included eight rolls with a type of seafood salad on top (which reminded me of pulled pork, except it was fish).  This order also includes tiny wonton chips cascading on, around, and beside the piled-high rolls...crazyyy.  I have a picture of it that I want to post onYelp once I figure out how!  The taste was only mediocre, though; I preferred to eat our other choices than the Volcano.\\n\\nThe service was a bit slow here, but very friendly.  We were actually the only people in the restaurant when we arrived at 5pm, but a few people trickled in for take-out.  We had this amazing saki that I don't recall the name of...but it was really good!  I'm not a huge saki fan, but I enjoyed it.  \\n\\nOf course our bill was pretty high (the sake ended up being around $35 for our one carafe!), but we expected as much for the food.  Overall, I'm glad I finally went to Ginza, but next time I am in the mood for sushi while in Brookline, I will most likely choose Fugakyu over it.  However, I give bonus points go to Ginza for its outdoor seating.\\n\\nFor my \\"Sushi\\" list: 3.5 stars"},{"name":"City Winery","address":"650 North Ave NE, Ste 201, Ponce City Market","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"We had a great City Winery experience - I was honestly a little concerned because of the mediocre reviews.

The brisket was delicious, kinda hard to stop eating it, but I had to try the ribs too, and those did not disappoint either. The sides of corn and potatoes served their purpose well, and the finale that was the banana pudding was quite amazing. May be one of my favorite banana puddings ever. Other than the pudding, brisket was probably my other favorite. The staff was amiable and the owner also swung by our table to check on our meal, and had some interesting tales about BBQ's history in Texas, current state, and his family's personal history in the BBQ industry.

This place is just what Buckhead needed: a cool sandwich shop which serves super sweet tea, crave-worthy salads, fabulous desserts plus brunch from 9:30 a.m. - 2 p.m. on the weekends.\\n\\nOne of my gripes with Souper Jenny (which I also adore) is the lack of brunch on Saturday. Sure they have Cafe Jonah but I always wanted tomato soup AND grits on the weekends. Can't a girl have her cake and eat it too?\\n\\nWell at Joy Cafe, I did just that. I ordered tomato basil soup, grits with cheese, plus a side salad for my brunch. My sorority sister dining with me ordered her two eggs any style. The biscuit which came out with her brunch was massive! And the bacon was some of the best I've had in Atlanta. We later learned that everything is made from scratch. The biscuits are a family recipe Joy's made since she was 6. All the meats are cured and brined in-house so there's neither Boarshead nor preservatives to be found.\\n\\nSince the joint is less than a year old, Joy herself can be found at her spot 7-days a week. She was so nice to stop by our table, and her husband John is working there right along side her. They even let us sample a chocolate cupcake for dessert. It was absolutely to die for with two kinds of French chocolate! I also brought my husband home a slice of key lime pie which lasted maybe about 90 seconds once I walked through the front door.\\n\\nIn total for two girls to brunch with drinks, tax and tip came out to $30. Albeit for Buckhead that's in the usual range but I'm even more willing to pay $3 for a cupcake to help support this local family business.\\n\\nSo if y'all are looking for an awesome spot for lunch, dinner or bunch on the weekends, and want to know your food is made from scratch by Joy herself, check out Joy Cafe and Bakery.

Granted, the food is Korean and so the price is adjusted accordingly. The bugolgi is passable. I would recommend getting the pork bugolgi. It is arguably the best item on the menu for the price. The ramen dishes are not too good. It is simply packaged ramen that is mixed with soup. These soup noodle dishes seem like items that anyone could simply make at home. The lunch specials are nice though. You can choose two sides and the price is significantly cheaper than the full price meal. Soup is complimentary and tea is offered as well. \\n\\nBonus: After every 10 meals purchased, the customer receives a free lunch special.

This review is really for one thing and one thing only. As these hip kids say, \\"DAT BREADBOWL THO!\\" Gourmands, did you just make me annihilate a whole broccoli and cheese soaked bowl made out of bread? Just bring me out a bread spoon and a bread napkin so I can wipe the broccoli cheese soup off my cheeks and eat the napkin.

My wife had picked the restaurant because she specifically wanted to try their Panang Curry. After waffling a bit, I ended up ordered the Duck Noodle Soup off the happy hour menu, and we both ordered some sushi from the same menu.\\n\\nWe both loved everything we got. The sushi rolls were far bigger than we expected being that they were from the happy hour menu, and discounted. The Noodle Soup was also huge, and I had trouble finishing it.

It doesn't feel like you are dining in a nice restaurant but more like in a cafeteria of university. I almost gave up because I was very hungry and angry about hopeless waiting. Finally, we sit down and have our menu after 45 minutes waiting. I have to say their servers are very experienced. As soon as we sit down, they offered two appetizers as a compensation for long waiting and dishes were brought to our table very quick. One of the free dish is yellow tail in yuzu soy sauce, very delicious. That makes me feel much better emotionally and physically. Overall, the service is good except the waiting, the food is good but it is not an authentic Japanese food.

The stuff added into it is what makes it guacamole. In fact, if you google the definition of 'guacamole', you get this: \\"A dish of mashed avocado mixed with chopped onion, tomatoes, chili peppers, and seasoning.\\" So while i do appreciate a good dollop of avocado in my burrito, this acting like they're somehow superior because they forgot all but one of the ingredients in their guacamole is just... strange.)\\n\\n(Also, if you're a real stickler about cross-contamination, you might not want to eat here.

The pho was a watered down broth, lacking in any robust flavor. It was like they completely forgot to put any of the normal spices into the stock. The Bo Kho was just ok, leaning on the bland side; it did not have the spicy, meaty flavor the dish is supposed to have. The Bun Tom Thit Nuong was really a joke.

The burrata and beet salad was bigger than my head.\\n\\nDo not order the meat and cheese board. You probably have the ingredients right now in your pantry and fridge to compile a nicer meat and cheese board at home in under five minutes. I couldn't believe they served those sulfate-covered dried apricots, jumbo sized craisins, and cold rock-hard beer bread.

The basque inspired tapas while not authentic had some nice Spanish elements. The croquettes were the highlight of the dishes we ordered.  Well prepared, they had a lovely crisp light golden crust with a beautifully creamy and flavorful center. The sauce accompaniment was subtly spiced and had a wonderful complimentary flavor. As they were our first dish, we had high expectations for the rest of the dishes we had ordered; patatas bravas, chorizo, spinach, grilled zucchini and vegetarian empanadas. Unfortunately the rest of the food did not live up to the croquettes. The zucchini was okay, but oily and soggy.  The spinach and empanada filling were both watery and lacked flavor.  The chorizo and patatas bravas were good, but not amazing. The service was pleasant but our waitress was a bit spacey.  She gave the one virgin drink we ordered to the wrong person at the table.  This was discovered after the person that can't drink alcohol had taken a sip of her drink and was slammed with the flavor of tequila.\\nAll in all an okay experience, but we will most likely not return.

It was $16 and worth every penny.  I can't remember the exact cheeses on the plate (there was blue -- I can tell you that), but the portions were big and were accompanied by water crackers, olives, grapes, and honey.  Also, they rotate them (although I didn't ask how often).  \\n-Our server, Oscar, was incredibly nice.  \\n-Wine seemed reasonably priced and whereas some people may not like this, the selection wasn't overwhelmingly huge (I have problems making decisions).   Apparently they rotate these as well (monthly).  \\n\\nWhy I leaned toward three stars:\\n-While Oscar was really nice, he had to check to see which cheeses were on the plate, and he also wasn't sure if the three wines we were choosing between were in stock.  I kind of just feel like that's something you should know offhand, especially at a nice-ish establishment.  \\n-Outside seating isn't the best.  Granted, it's not Apothecary's fault that Burnet Rd. is loud and bus #3 roars by A LOT.  But still, I usually prefer to sit outside when I go out somewhere and I may think twice about doing so at Apothecary.  \\n-I kind of wish they offered wine flights.  Maybe they do and I missed them?  Maybe this isn't the type of place that should?  I don't frequent wine bars too often, so maybe this is a unique feature of one in particular that I went to awhile ago.  \\n\\nI'll definitely go back to Apothecary because overall, I had a really nice visit with my friend, I appreciated the friendly service, and I like that they support local businesses."},{"name":"Bakery Bar","address":"1028 SE Water Avenue","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Not sure how this possibly ended up in the nightlife section, but there ya go...\\n\\nThe Bakery Bar serves up fantastic pastries to accompany their perfectly pulled Stumptown espresso drinks.

Though most of their sandwiches are meat based, the grilled cheese and egg salad are nice additions to the salad for vegetarians. During the winter, their soups are a treat, but again, usually meat based. The pastries are truly special. I switch off between the coconut scone and banana bread in the mornings, but once in a while I'll stop in on my way home for their amazing tarts. \\n\\nOther things to note: They usually make one espresso drink at a time, so be prepared to wait for that perfect latte if you see a line.

Only minor complaint here is the wait time. If you are in a rush, it may not work the best for you to come in. \\n\\nI ordered nan-ban chicken bento (very tasty with the tartar sauce. It's not the typically tartar sauce that you would have elsewhere, which I am not a fan of but theirs was good!), salmon ikura don (sushi rice was so good! And of course the salmon roe and salmon!! Fresh and yummy!), unagi was delicious (not usually a unagi person because I had bad childhood memories but I loved it!), and tacoyaki (my go to order everywhere! Above average here too!). \\n\\nFor the bentos, they have 3 different kinds of rice that you can choose from: white, brown and karen/Japanese mixed rice.

Just a confession here...I don't usually eat much rice for meals; however, I can never resist Japanese rice.

I ate here last night and was greatly impressed with the service, satisfied with the food, but a little confused as to what to make of the ambiance. \\n\\nSETTING: Probably the biggest obstacle this restaurant faces. At the corner of Jonquil and Spring, this area is kind of no-mans-land. The restaurant itself is one half of a strip whose other half is a liquor store, and their store front isn't even visible for eastbound traffic on Spring (I mean you have to really look for this place). You can tell the management has put some effort into sprucing up the place, with a sign out front that are usually intended to catch the attention of foot traffic (as if there is any here...). Once you walk in, there is a bar that lets you see directly into the open kitchen, and you'll notice the white table clothes. Paintings decorate the walls, and there is a little side room with additional dining tables. Maybe its the interiors incongruity with the exterior, but something is off here and I don't know exactly what it is....\\n\\nSERVICE: The service was impeccable. Our waiter (he must have been the manager or related to the manager) was very Italian. He went through the specials with us, answered my mother's questions, and everything was brought out promptly. There was a little snafu with my dish (I'm vegetarian, it came out with meat, more on this later), and he was very apologetic about it, and had the kitchen bring out a meatless version in no time. \\n\\nFOOD: The meal started with bread, which looks like it was pan-grilled, well seasoned with herbs, and cut into small pieces. With the olive oil / balsamic vinaigrette mix put out on the table it was delicious. As in, I-may-come-back-just-for-the-bread good. We ordered the caprese Salad and calamari to start. The caprese was awesome, thick slices of mozz, all the ingredients were fresh. The calamari was light, not too greasy, but I found it a little on the bland side. For my main, I ordered the gnocchi with the vodka sauce. When it came, it had some pork in it... apparently the vodka sauce comes with pork (I didn't know this, other Italian restaurants clearly note meat sauces). I said something as soon as it was set down, and the waiter was super gracious and apologetic about it. Within 5 minutes, he brought out a fresh dish with no meat. The gnocchi itself was pretty good, not amazing, although I was stuffed after eating the apps and bread, so I didn't stand a chance at actually finishing the dish. \\n\\nI would be willing to come back here, but would probably order a different main dish. Given the lack of comparable options the surrounding area has to offer, Mezza Luna is definitely a place to check out if you're nearby. \\n\\nFrom other pictures on Yelp, the place seems like it could have a different feel when its full. I've also heard from neighbors that reservations is the way to go, so maybe its more lively during peak times. I could see this turning into a secret diamond-in-the-rough if you will, if they get enough word-of-mouth attention."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My boyfriend was feeling in a brunch-y mood last weekend, so we hopped on Yelp to see what was nearby and specializing in brunch. When Joy Cafe popped up, I was impressed with its reviews and we decided to give it a go.\\n\\nGood thing we got there a little earlier than anticipated. I expected to have a wait, but this little place was packed to the gills and people were spilling out onto the sidewalk in droves. A very harried looking lady (Joy herself, perhaps?) took our name and we waited along with the rest of the crowd.\\n\\nAlthough I've driven past Joy Cafe many a times on Pharr Rd, I never noticed it in the little strip mall next to Aqua Bistro and caddy corner from the Atlanta Fish Market. It's really unobtrusive - I mean, I got my eyebrows waxed more than once at Posh Nail Salon just a few spaces over from Joy and never realized what it was. The inside is a totally nondescript white, diner-type restaurant except for a pastry case toward the back where you can pick up to-go orders. It's clean looking, if small and cramped when there's a good crowd. \\n\\nThe groups of people waiting for a table in the tiny restaurant, which probably seats forty at most, obviously knew what's up though. And they were right.\\n\\nOnce we got a table and looked at the very attractive brunch menu filled with pancakes, waffles, omelettes, bagels, grits and more, I could see what all the fuss was about. Not knowing how large the portions might be, we threw caution to the wind and I ordered the Greek omelette with spinach, sun dried tomato and feta, hashbrowns and a biscuit, and my boyfriend got pancakes with a side of bacon.\\n\\nWhile we were waiting for our order they brought out a little plate of cinnamon roles and blueberry muffins to slake our appetites - very nice touch, in my opinion. And when the plates came out - holy cow! That was a lot of food! It has been a long time since I've seen an omelette that large and fluffy (it was gigantic), a homemade biscuit which almost matched it in size and a generous portion of homemade hashbrowns to accompany them. My boyfriend's pancakes and bacon were of equally generous portions - 3 dinner plate-sized fluffy pancakes with syrup and 3 think slices of bacon. \\n\\nI made it through half the omelette, a portion of biscuit and half of a pancake before admitting defeat. He had a pancake and then some, most of the other half of the omelette, bacon and a bite of the big biscuit before also surrendering. It was way too much food for us, even with large Sunday-brunch appetites.\\n\\nWhen we rolled ourselves out the door complaining of food comas an hour and a half later, the steady flow of people eating and waiting for tables hadn't ebbed a bit.

Brought to you by the Lyons Group (which owns most of the businesses on Lansdowne Street), The Lansdowne is modeled to resemble an Irish pub both in decor and menu. \\n\\nFor dinner we started by sharing the salmon cakes and mussels -- the latter of which was amazing! Apparently, heavily salted mussels  cooked in a sizzling hot cast iron skillet is well known dish in Florida. I'm not sure how it tastes down South, but the Lansdowne did an amazing job with it. The salmon cakes were tasty as well -- really light, flavorful and very moist (something that I find not all restaurants can accomplish). \\n\\nFor my entree I had the beef guinness pot pie. Rather then the traditional crust I was used to, this pot pie had a separate round disk of crust placed on top of it. While a bit untraditional, it did make breaking into the pie a bit easier and let me choose to just skip eating the top in order to be a wee bit healthier. I also liked that the crust didn't overwhelm the pie. The meat in the pie was actually really tender but there was a little less gravy then I was used to/like and it was a tiny bit saltier then I prefer. If your order a pot pie be sure to try the Irish soda bread that comes with it -- so so good!!\\n\\nI also sampled bits of my friends' dinners. I loved the chicken pot pie and probably would get this next time. The table split a fries with curry sauce and this was a really fun and delicious addition to the meal. \\n\\nI went to dinner with a UK native and she was really excited to see certain menu items from back home -- in particular the fried sausages with homemade \\"chips.\\" While I personally didn't taste them, she said this heart attack on a plate was delicious. \\n\\nWe were really tempted to try and eat dessert but we just couldn't find room. However, I'm going to have to return to try the fried mars bar or the Bailey's cream pots with homemade oatmeal cookies. \\n\\nThe Lansdowne has a pretty nice selection of beers on tap as well as bottled and many Irish whiskeys. I wound up ordering a glass of wine and found the selection to be more then adequate and well priced considering this isn't their main focus. Their bar is actually amazing to look at as well -- it's HUGE! \\n\\nI was told that The Lansdowne is going to have live music and has a drop down screen that can show soccer games/baseball games. The decor is designed to look like a standard Irish pub and it does a nice job of that. Only thing I would encourage them to change is add a few lights over the bathroom mirror -- a girl's gotta do touchups sometimes! \\n\\nI look forward to seeing how this new restaurant fares on Lansdowne Street.

It came hot from the oven in a cast iron skillet, with grilled pita wedges that seemed pretty fresh. The dip itself was a good marriage of savory, tart, creamy, oniony and tomato-y. We only ate a little of it, because our entrees came up so quickly. Oops - we generally like to take our time, but it wasn't  too big a deal. We asked the waitress to wrap it to go. My husband got the evening's special, which was a sirloin steak \\"Oscar.\\" The steak was cooked right - medium rare - and was pretty tender for a sirloin. It came topped with crabmeat in a buttery, lemony bearnaise sauce, and he really enjoyed it. I ordered  the veal parmesan. And - I'm about to lay it on pretty thick - I kid you not it was the best cut of veal I've ever eaten. It was a little thicker than the usual veal parmesan, freshly breaded and fried just right. The marinara tasted freshly prepared and well seasoned, and the dish was topped with shaved parmesan. I had asked for mashed potatoes instead of the standard side of spaghetti, and though the veal came plated with the spaghetti, the waitress quickly brought a side of mashed potatoes. They were just okay (am I the only one on the planet who likes my potatoes really smooth with no lumps??), but the veal more than made up for that. Our meal was accented by a \\"Sinatra martini\\" (dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives) for the hubby, and a creme brulee to share. I wasn't crazy about the recipe, which tasted of almond/amaretto instead of vanilla, but we managed to scrape the ramekin. He agreed with my assessment of this meal as an 8 out of a possible 10 points, but since we are so particular and have probably had only one 10 point restaurant meal ever, that translates into 5 Yelp stars for us. The biggest disappointment came the next evening, when I took out the leftover onion dip to reheat and serve with homemade pork chops. Unfortunately, the waitress put the pita wedges and table bread/butter in the to-go box, but left out the lovely onion dip. Dang. (Overall, the service was very good.)"},{"name":"Oga's Japanese Cuisine","address":"915 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"4","text":"OISHII DESU YO!  This is one of my favourite Japanese restaurants in Mass.  As I noted in a previous post, Wanokura in Milford is right up there as well, although Oga's beats them for hot dishes.  Service, ambiance and food are all fantastic.  The interior appointments are very upscale in contrast to the plain exterior (it's in a stripmall afterall, but then again what on Route 9 ISN'T in a stripmall) and offer an inviting and pleasant atmosphere.  Food quality is outstanding and service is always prompt.  Again, people often overlook the great restaurants in the suburbs but Oga's definately rivals (and more often than not, TOPS) any Japanese restaurant in the city.

The grill show was the worst I've seen, by the way, and I've seen quite a few.  Same with the edamame (choked in salt?!) and the miso soup (read water).\\n\\nThat's alright, time for the check.  We tip 13%.  The waiter brings it back, saying in something that resembles English that we haven't tipped enough.  Nice way to bring a ludicrously below average meal down to a completely ruined experience.

The concept is fast, healthy and convenient. The menu is straight forward and simple but there are enough combination options to where you don't have to get the same thing over and over. Your first choice is your base- rice, lettuce, half and half, or a flatbread wrap. Your second choice is your protein- shrimp, chicken, portabella, or add/sub avocado. Your third choice is \\"your gusto\\" which is what makes Gusto so special. You can choose from six different Gusto's that are each concocted of amazing ingredients. My favorite is the apple curry peanut. It consists of curry peanut sauce, an apple, cabbage, carrot salad in a sriracha ginger dressing and roasted peanuts. The Gusto that you choice is placed atop your base choice for a healthy, flavorful meal. \\n\\nThis location stands where Chow Baby used to on Ponce De Leon. The space has been completely revamped and it is clean and beautiful. They have a nice patio out front and offer local brews like the ever popular Tropicalia, by Creature Comforts.

That being said, the actual event left a LOT to be desired. \\n\\nMy first complaint is about the service. From the minute we sat down, our waitress was making excuses about her poor level of service. It took at least 15 minutes for her to take our drink order and probably another 15 for us to receive them. It wasn't like she was running around with her head cut off, she was strolling, chitchatting...just not doing her job very efficiently. \\n\\nApparently we were seated next to a table full of the manager's friends because she spent the majority of the approx. 2 1/2 hours that we were there talking to them and even sitting down with them for a bit. We only knew she was the manager because when we got the wrong dog three different times and it was still on our bill...our waitress had to ask the woman who had been standing near our table all night long if she could take it off of the ticket. \\n\\nI have to say...I love hot dogs, sausages, basically any meat that comes served in a bun with yummy condiments. I would have been more happy with a grocery store wiener than the one I was served...and could have had 8 of them for less than the price I paid for 1! It just wasn't amazing. It wasn't even memorable. I got it on the pretzel bun which sounded so delectable and just....wasn't. \\n\\nWe had ordered a few apps, too....and while the chili cheese fries were yummy, the pickles I ordered got taken from the table with half of them still in the jar, and the fresh tomatoes were literally just some slices on a plate....for something like $3. Is this what dining out has come to??? I need to get into the restaurant business, if so!\\n\\nLike I said...service was seriously lacking. When we first got our food, two of the dogs were completely wrong....like we-got-someone-else's-order, wrong. The problem was that with dogs, it's hard to tell until you've bitten into it....well, one of them was in the completely wrong bun, so that was obvious...but I digress. When our waitress finally reappeared we let her know the order was incorrect and she brings them out about 20 minutes later, when the rest of us have already finished eating. The second time she bring the one that was in the wrong bun, originally, out in ANOTHER wrong bun. So at this point we just ask if she can just bring us the correct bun and we'll do the switcharoo on our own. \\n\\nSo then we get the ticket and both of the wrong dogs were still on there, even though she'd made a point to say she was taking one of them off (and not the other one, that she screwed up three times) so we just assumed that the one that was screwed thrice would be off, too. Yeah, she had to ask the manager. \\n\\nAnyway....long story short, it was a very long meal of waiting...and waiting and, you guessed it, waiting. I don't feel the need to come back here on my own, but I'm sure someday down the road a friend will suggest it, and hopefully, they'll get to redeem themselves because the whole first experience left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food, awesome customer service and loved the coffee!!!

The chalk board menu has modest prices and no lines...for now. This occasion's big delicious bowl of noodles is the best thing I've had in a while. Phat Phrik Khing , one of the oldest and best Thai Curries which has no Khing or ginger as in the name, nor is it fried in coconut milk like most curry. It's all about chilies, galangal and lemongrass. This version with pork by the Chef's Mom was spot on. Get Larb Moo. The khao niaow powder involved calls for dry frying the sticky rice with galangal and kafir then makes tiny flecks in a miniature wood chipper I'm guessing and gives this pork salad a special mouth feel that crackles the harmonious sweet spicy dish. Thai roti can be savory or sweet. Cha Yen's fry bread croissant pancake with its potatoey peanutty hint of cinnamon and anise accompaniment is a perfect food. Really good flaky outside, soft inside and buttery throughout, Roti with a Massaman dipping elixir was a snack between here and there this morning and proved to be the best bite of the day. (I hear tell of Foy Tong/Golden Threads dessert of the Thai Gods to come and there's the legendary stewed pork shank of Krung Thep to be had...) The corn cake didn't survive the trip home. A point of purchase deep fried friend. I ate it in the car. It was crunchy and delicious with a milky corn center plus the pea nutty sauce.  I will return. Gotta go back and try the everything."},{"name":"Yenching Restaurant","address":"1326 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"2.5","text":"This is the first 1 star review I am ever writing.\\n As a Californian, I don't expect good Asian food anywhere in Boston, especially in Harvard Square. But this place hit lower than my already very low expectations.\\nThe one positive thing I can say about this place is that I found it cleaner than the other Chinese restaurants I have been to. I think it is to appeal to the tourists who visit Harvard Square. They are also a little more English friendly. (Okay so I guess that was more than one positive thing.)\\nIt all starts going downhill from there.  \\nFor one, the food took longer than usual to arrive, although the restaurant was half empty on a Thursday evening. It seemed like they were more focused on getting their take-out orders out, even though there were TIP-PAYING diners waiting to be served. \\nSpeaking of tip: it's included in the bill. You HAVE to tip whatever amount they put on the check. I think it was 18-20%. I believe this is customary for the restaurant regardless of party size (We were a party of 2). I would already have an issue about mandatory tip even if food/service were good, but in this case, it was NOT AT ALL! It took forever to get in our order, it took forever for our food to come out, and we asked for hot sauce 3 times and still never got it! Then when we made an issue of it when we got the bill (with the infuriating mandatory tip that we did not believe the restaurant staff deserved), they looked at us blankly \\ni also noticed that they favor their regulars a LOT. When someone the staff knew came in to eat, he was greeted enthusiastically (while we were not given a greeting, nor even a word--just a gesture to an empty table), his order was taken immediately and his food arrived in a far more timely manner than ours, and before other parties in the restaurant, even though the others had put in their orders earlier than the \\"VIP\\" Not cool. \\nanother negative: dinner here can get expensive! The plates do not come with rice, so you have to order (and pay for it) separately per serving. Tea also comes at an additional price. We were not warned about this when they asked us if we wanted tea or rice. \\n\\nWill not return."},{"name":"Salsa's","address":"118 Dorchester St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"We go to mexico each year for the last 5 years, and when you're not there, this is the place.

The first time, bf and I got our usual standards, spring rolls, pho tai (rare beef) and grilled beef over rice. The food emerged extremely quickly. The grilled meat was a generous serving, the pho broth fine if a bit oily, the garnishes fresh.\\n\\nOn a subsequent visit, a friend got the tofu with Chinese broccoli, light and refreshing yet satisfying in a delicious brown sauce.\\n\\nAnd the third time, we went for the seven courses of beef, a great deal at $15 each for two or $10 for three. This is a really intense eating experience in which you cook two kinds of raw sliced beef in a hot pot while the waitresses bring you yet more beef on skewers, as a meatball and in a rice porridge. On the side are greens, herbs, cucumbers, apples and rice paper, which you use to roll up the beef. Everything was delicious (except for the porridge -- hated this as a kid and still do) and keeping up with the food takes quite a lot of effort!

So when she finally decided to approach our table she asked if we were ready and pulled out her pen and pad. We said yes but had to ask her for the rundown of the specials which she just kind of rolled off her tongue with absolutely zero detail. She never asked us about beverages, I actually asked her if it were okay that we ordered cocktails and once the champagne glass was empty she never asked if we wanted more. We she saw that we had finished our meals she came to the table with the ticket and once again I HAD TO ASK her about desserts. When the other party at my table asked for a menu she told him that there wasn't one available, I know that she could have given him the dinner menu so that he could have chosen a dessert from the bottom of the menu.

Not even other waiters were available for us. I think it took more than 10 minutes for me to finally get a waiter to place an additional order. The order I placed came out, and I saw the bowl of soup sitting on the counter afar. No one picked it up  and brought it to me, and that soup was just sitting there for a while. Our waitress even messed up our bills and had to bring the correct ones.\\n\\nRestaurant was not even busy - it was on a Tuesday night around 9pm when many of the customers already left. \\n\\nAs for the food, do not order the kale salad. Cheese overpowered the dish way too much. Salad itself tasted really bland, and my friends agreed as well. The oyster soup was really good though. \\n\\nI'm not even exaggerating.

I really liked my experience, the food and beer but the one thing that kept bothering me was the parking situation. \\n\\nMy husband and I were in town and we were meeting up with my old roommate Becca. It was a Friday evening at 7:30. I read that the parking situation was a little hairy but I didn't think it would be too bad. Well I was wrong. We got shafted with this. Apparently they only have about 30 or so parking spots and offer \\"free\\" valet parking but accept tips. When I pulled into the parking and had no where to turn I asked the attendant if there was any place I could park my car myself and he said \\"Well I can't recommend any off site parking. The manager has the valet set up because there's only 30 parking spaces. It's free and all you have to do is tip.\\" I looked at my husband, we didn't have any cash. I turned to the attendant \\"Well it looks like I don't have any other choice but to give you my car. I have don't have any cash so what do you suggest I do.\\" The guy didn't answer my question but was already trying to open my car door. I unlocked it and there we were. I surrendered my car and I would just have to figure it out. That was annoying and I was a bit irritated. \\n\\nWe walked and I was pretty impressed by the look of the place. it has a very modern rustic, laid back look. The place has really high ceilings which makes the place very.  open. Becca got their first and said she got a table outside. The hostess walked us to towards the back and through some doors. WOW! There was a really nice outdoor area and there was group performing. What a perfect night. The weather was nice, the music was pretty good and I was in good company. \\n\\nI hadn't seen or talked to Becca in almost a year! There was lots to catch up on. She recently got a promotion and we got married in between the time I last saw here. Our server was so sweet and patient with us when we didn't have any food decisions for her. As far as beer goes I enjoyed my Py Jingo Pale Ale. Great summer beer. When we finally decided on a little bit of food Becca and I got a side Field Green Salad with apples, caramelized walnuts, crumbled blue cheese with aged sherry vinaigrette. We also ordered two appetizers Fried Calamari\\nwith grain mustard sauce and Sausage Stuffed Mushrooms\\na lively blend of fennel sausage, roasted garlic and peppers topped with Parmesan cheese. Everything was so tasty. The stuffed mushrooms were definitely stuffed with a good amount of sausage. Great ratio of mushroom to ratio. Salad was great. It was a nice compliment to our very rich appetizers. I enjoyed this salad so much that I recreated a version of it at home. \\n\\nSo as I said I was going back and forth between 3 and 4 stars. The food was great and the service was outstanding. Becca used to work in restaurants and she mentioned a few times how awesome our server was. The main thing was that she was so patient and pleasant. Oh and as far as my tip for the valet. Becca had a few dollars that she gave me. Thank goodness for her. If she didn't have it then sorry Valet Man no tip for you...Seriously what would you do?\\n\\nThis place has been open since as far back as I could remember.

Not to say that I wasn't pleased with my dining experience, but after reading all these reviews, I expected something extraordinary and out of the norm. However, what I ate here isn't anything that I couldn't have probably gotten at another high scale brunch restaurant. \\n\\nFirst, as suggested by our server, we ordered the Some of Each basket to share with the table. This was unexpectedly good and something that I couldn't order elsewhere. I'm glad our server recommended it. Each pastry had a unique sweet, savory taste. It started off our meal perfectly. I ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict while my sister ordered The Riverside and the others ordered the Duck N Beef burger or the special. \\n\\nAll of us were impressed and pleased with our food with just a few critiques. I thought The Riverside was very pricey for just basic breakfast food. It comes with scrambled eggs, bacon, french toast, and hash browns. $15 for a basic breakfast dish that could be easily made at home or ordered elsewhere for cheaper. Sure it was good, but not any different than any other breakfast location for this particular thing. My dish tasted amazing that I was left wanting more. I wish the salmon had been a little thicker or bigger but it tasted amazing with the poached eggs. Perfect amount of sauce to top it off as well. The common factor I noticed among all our dishes, however, was that everything was either overcooked or intentionally toasty. The English muffin for my benedict was very toasty and crunchy, which may be preferred for some, but I like mine soft. It was kind of hard to cut into. The potatoes were all hard rather than soft. And even the fries were crunchy rather than soft. Still tasty but I wish there was more of an in between. I will say, however, that the fries are really good. Everyone else was very pleased with their dishes. \\n\\nOther details- parking is valet only which is complimentary, but I tipped regardless. Customer service is top notch. Our server was very friendly and attentive. He was quick and personable. He took the time to introduce himself and talk to us even realizing that it was an engagement celebration and brought out dessert unexpectedly at the end of our meal. He came by several times to clean up the table while we ate and even took up the plates and boxed the leftovers for us afterwards."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I first visit to Joy caf√©.

One major thing I do like is that there are no fried foods.  Sure you can get potato chips or Fritos as a side, but no fryer on site.  \\n\\nAs a beer snob (German skunky beers please!), their beer selection could be a bit better, but it doesn't detract from the place.  They don't serve Lonestar or PBR either, which is fine.  Their house margaritas are my favorites in town.  Tasty, tangy, potent.\\n\\nAs far as the staff goes, they're great.  Very friendly and if you go there regularly, you're always greeted a little more warmly than a random patron.\\n\\nFriday an Saturday nights are really good as the place quiets down a little bit after 10PM when the last of the dinner crowd seems to disappear and it's mostly just the \\"locals\\" hanging out.\\n\\nFinally, one of my favorite things about this place is that it doesn't attract hipsters and gutter punks.

Since I was in the area on business I wanted to spend the weekend with her and have the chance to do some sightseeing and catch up on all of the family news.\\n\\nShe, my sister, my Dad and I all converged in Boston, and we went to Osaka restaurant which is near where she lives in Brighton. Osaka is located in Brookline, on Green Street, near the intersection of Harvard and Beacon Streets in an area known as Coolidge Corner.\\n\\nThe restaurant is a classic Japanese Steak House (some would call it a Hibachi-style restaurant) along with a very nice sushi bar. They have several Hibachi dining areas, private function rooms, the sushi bar, and some common dining space.\\n\\nWe opted to sit in one of the Hibachi dining areas but also ordered some sushi as appetizers, so we got to try the best of both worlds. My niece and I split the Tomo roll which was spicy crunchy salmon and mango, all topped with seared salmon, white tuna, avocado, and crispy rice powder and honey wasabi sauce. Very beautiful presentation (see the photo), and quite tasty.\\n\\nFor the main course, we were all entertained as the chef twirled his spatula and dazzled us with his knife skills, all over the hot grill. He whisked through a mountain of veggies, and teased us by flipping diced pieces of veggies into our open mouths. (I'm sure that we looked like trained seals at the Aquarium, but it was great fun!). The chef made the traditional flaming volcano out of onion ring slices (see attached photo), and displayed a great degree of showmanship along with his cooking expertise.\\n\\nI had a plate of seared diver scallops with Fillet Mignon, and that came with a generous amount of fried rice and grilled veggies.\\n\\nThe prices were certainly fair for the quality of the entertainment and the quality of the food.

I ordered the Chicken Shawarma wrap ($6.99) to go. Then I sat there waiting for about 10 minutes, wondering what was going on. I could see the guy behind the counter, but he didn't look like he was doing anything about my order. After a while, I realized he must've been cooking the chicken in the back. After a while I saw him pick up a wrap (not a pita wrap though; some sort of weird hybrid between a tortilla and pita), and then start asking me which toppings I wanted (lettuce, tomatoes, olives, onions). And then he asked me if I wanted mayo or ranch. Stop. I'm sorry, did you say MAYO and RANCH?! Do you think I'm some kind of uncultured buffoon? Hell no, I'm not putting that in my wrap. So I told him no, and started feeling a little off-put. He started wrapping up my order, and I realized I never saw him add tzatziki sauce (which was on the description of my order, and lets be real, basically makes or breaks any Greek-style order). Which I asked him. And he replied, \\"we don't have any\\". We don't have any as in we are out, or as in it has never set foot in our store?? Then he asked me again if I wanted mayo or ranch. Still said no to that one. So I left the place feeling slighted. I feel like that's something he should've said at the beginning. It's quite simple: \\"we don't have any tzatziki sauce, is that okay?\\" Because honestly, I would've gone someplace else! I don't want a dry Chicken chicken Shawarma! Which it was. Don't mistake me, the meat was very good; well-seasoned and tender, but it didn't taste very authentic (not that ranch or mayo would've fixed that ), and every bite I took made me feel like I'd lost an opportunity to eat a delicious meal. It ruined the experience for me. In that regards, I rate the quality and taste of the food (4/5). I've had better, but it was good. And customer service gets a (2/5). That just really hit me hard. Particularly since I'm in town visiting, it's not as if I can just go back next week and get it again, with tzatziki (not that they're guaranteed to have any, since apparently \\"we don't have any\\" is the new ambiguous response\\").

You either had to attempt to look over the counter (which is hard for an individual who is on the shorter side like myself) or ask them to tell you the list. I ended up with the Nutella spread with strawberries and whipped cream. \\n\\nThe reason why I give this place 3/5 stars is that for the price and size of the crepe, I didn't feel like it was worth it. There was barely any strawberries in my crepe! The end product was mainly just crepe batter and Nutella topped with a dollop of whipped cream. This \\"cone\\" type design is unique but you have to eat your crepe fast while it's still hot and crisp otherwise it'll be start sinking and sticking to the paper. There are other places in Vancouver where you can sit down and have a loaded crepe filled with savory or sweet ingredients and it would cost about the same or less (I highly recommend C'est La Vie off 78th, although they're only open weekdays). \\n\\nIn summation, for shop located in the mall this is a quick and fast way to have dessert and be on your way. I probably wouldn't come here again but with some improvements I think Crepes n' Waffles can do well."},{"name":"Habanero Mexican Grill","address":"166 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Been here several times for lunch and dinner .. night time it's pretty packed.

I couldn't really hear people in my group that were sitting a couple seats down from me. The food was tasty, but a tad overpriced. I ordered the breakfast sandwich panini and was expecting a flat, pressed panini. Instead I received a breakfast sandwich on a round bun, so tall I couldn't even fit it in my mouth- even after cutting it in half. It was good all the same but extremely messy. I barely ate the second half of it because it was so difficult to eat given the size of it. My plate did come with home fries (slightly skimped on) that were the highlight. Nicely seasoned and great tasting. I think everyone at my table enjoyed their food. The breakfast sandwich was $14 though! I guess you pay for the ambiance. I ordered the \\"pail of Prosecco\\", which comes with one bottle of Prosecco and 4 different types of juices, for $40. Usually if you're paying that much, you get bottomless mimosas!

The restaurant can hold large parties, and the interior design is by far one of the better ones in the Atlanta area. \\n\\nThe service is impeccable. The wait staff and the hosting staff are very attentive and really serve you very well. \\n\\nI had the pleasure of having a brunch in this restaurant. The pastries were really good, and they were not too sweet. I am not so sure about the price, but I am not a huge fan of sweet things. Some people love the pastries the restaurant serves on Sundays. \\n\\nShe Crab Soup with Jumbo Crab Meat was delicious. It has a full flavor to every bite paired up with lump crab meats. The ingredients were very fresh and good quality. It's a rich creamy soup, and I enjoy rich creamy soups. \\n\\nHouse Smoked Salmon on a Crispy Potato Pancake with Vermont Goat Cheese is a good appetizer. It's not a lot, and it won't feel you up. It has very good qualities though. It's too bad the restaurant only give you three pieces. The salmon goes well with the goat cheese, and the seafood is fresh. The crisp potato pancake was a good texture to the soft and moist salmon. It's very light, and the seasoning on these crispy potato pancakes went very well with the overall smoked salmon and cheese. \\n\\n\\"Crab & Eggs\\" - Jumbo Lump Crabmeat, Soft Scrambled Eggs and Hash Brown Potatoes is an entree that is pretty filling. One thing I did notice is that my taste buds got tired of the flavor half way through. The scrambled eggs with crab meat just started to taste blend or not as exciting anymore. I think if they added something to balance the soft texture with something crispy, it might improve the dish. Additionally, I think if the dish had a contrasting flavor to the egg, it will be better. The crab just became mundane with the egg because they tasted the same with no contrast to each other. \\n\\nOak Roasted Local Chicken with Cheddar Grits, Spiced Escarole, Oven Dried Tomatoes and Natural Jus is a good entree. It's a heavy dish, and you're going to get full. The dish had more of contrast between flavors and the balance was there. The oven dried tomatoes brought the mundane grits out, and the cheese, well cheese makes everything taste good. The chicken was fresh and very well cooked, and I think this was better than the Crab & Eggs. \\n\\nI had the sorbet, and the sorbet was pretty good. I can't comment as much as the other dishes because I am not a huge expert on desserts. But, it's good! \\n\\nOverall, this place was a very good dining experience, and I suggest taking your hot match dot com dates.

Went for happy hour on a Thursday night, and was surprised to see such a large dining facility in the Pearl District; it looks like a large cabin, complete with flannel carpeting haha. I like that you are not restricted to just the bar for happy hour. Service was quite slow, and I understand that she had many tables to attend to, but she definitely projected her disdain for her job at that moment. Specials of the day are ridiculously priced, and I quite enjoyed my Experimental #576 (I think it was). My boyfriend HAD to get the flight and we enjoyed sampling the different kinds, until we ate too much. I can't remember all the names of the beers, but one that stood out was the Human Sacrifice, which oddly enough, tasted like beef jerky to me. BUT being the fatty I am, I do remember the food quite well.\\n\\nSweet and spicy mac and cheese: yum, yum and YUM. I love cavatappi and the cheese sauce to pasta ration was perfect. Rich, but multidimentionally flavored so it isn't just a heavy mess like some mac and cheeses\\n\\nPretzel: the pretzel itself was a little too salty, but the cheese dipping sauce with the mustard was great. I really like their mustard\\n\\nBratwurst: I liked the slaw and the bratwurst was sweet and juicy, but I would have preferred to put the mustard on myself.

It's accompanied by a bowl of white (or coconut) rice and a salad. For a mere $9 it is an absolute steal (remember, this is a lunch special). If I'm famished,  I usually throw down a Roti Canai or a few skewers as well. If I'm in need of a carb injection,  the pineapple or coconut fried rice dishes off the regular menu is always a solid choice. Note that these dishes are served in a REAL pineapple and coconut respectively. Definitely an \\"A\\" for style! These are a bit larger than the lunch special which justifies the $14 price tag.\\n\\nThe dining room itself is also quite new and modern. It feels massive inside with high (20ft) ceilings, large windows, and an abundance of mirrors. The booths are a little uncomfy - there's minimal legroom and the backrests are essentially a vertical wall with minimal cushioning. Nothing experience-ruining however. You can always sit at a table. The one thing that bugs me is that there is no direct door into the mall despite being in it - you have to go around the outside. There's a giant window looking into the mall so people can gawk at you eat if you happen to be on that side.    \\n                             \\nService is usually solid.

Like so many before him, he's obsessed with the Black Butte Porter and wanted to check out restaurant. We came on a weekend night, holiday weekend, and had to wait maybe 45 minutes, which was expected and not a big deal. However, what I DID have an issue was being ignored by not one, but TWO staff at the front desk in quick succession. \\n\\nAfter another customer was helped, she stepped out of line and I stepped up next. The guy at the front pointedly looked around at anything but me, and didn't speak or acknowledge my presence. Finally, I said, \\"Um, can we put our names down?\\" He responded, \\"Go to so-and-so\\", and pointed absently towards the other end of the desk. Okay. I approach So-And-So, who asks, \\"How Many?\\" in the standard fashion. And then, as I'm speaking, he actually turns his head in a complete 180 to watch an attractive girl walk inside and through the restaurant, leaving me standing in maybe 15 seconds of awkward silence, before saying, \\"What's the name\\", that I had already given him, while STILL watching this chick. Dude. I understand the instinct to glance at a passing lady, but you were LITERALLY in the MIDDLE of talking to me. I went outside and when my husband saw the look on my face, said, \\"I have never had such bad service in the first 3 minutes of being in a place, I am astounded right now.\\"\\n\\nWe initially said outside seating was fine, but after the sun set and we got our seats outdoors, it was a bit too chilly for our San-Diego-Bred skins. We apologetically asked our waiter if we could move indoors if something became available, and he agreed no problem and move us inside right away. He was in shorts and looked pretty miserable himself.\\n\\nThis is the part of the night where we adopted our new waitress, Grumpy McSadPants. Maybe she was having an off night, but she appeared visibly frustrated from the get-go. While taking our order, Ms. McSad seemed in a rush to get us to decide and was all frowns. When she asked if I wanted prosciutto on my pizza, I hesitated, saying, \\"... oh, no, that's ok.... well, actually, yes, why would I say that? Who DOESN'T want prosciutto?\\" McSad didn't glance up as she scratched on her notepad before stalking off.\\n\\nI had ordered a hot tea (because I needed to recover from the frigid July air...), and when she returned, I asked her for cream. I guess that was an issue, because she gave me an eye roll, a \\"yeah\\", and rushed off to find it. At this point I realized there was no sugar on the table, but didn't want to bother her by asking. My husband asked anyway once she got back, which didn't even elicit a response- she just walked away and eventually came back with it.\\n\\nThe food ended up being very good. My pizza was delightful, husband had a burger with gruyere that wasn't as strong of a flavor as we anticipated, but was actually cooked to a slightly-pink-medium, which was a plus. And, of course, beeeerzz.\\n\\nHaving worked in customer service and food service particularly for years myself, I think that I am very understanding of what situations restaurants are and are not in control of. Customer Service is a big deal to me, and while none of what transpired was blatantly awful, it was enough to give me an overall bad vibe of the place.

I believe our waiter was Chris and he was super nice and friendly. I was looking through Yelp to see what we should order and you get a free appetizer for checking in (stir-fried lettuce). I wasn't going to use it but Chris saw it on my phone and claimed it for me. It's free so why not right? \\n\\nWe ended up ordering the Siu Yoke (Crispy Pork), Roast Duck, Bulgogi Bahn Mi sliders, and Roti Canai which ended up being more than enough for two people. (darn, i wanted to try the wings too). Oh, I also ordered a grass jelly drink which is one of the cans you can get from your local asian supermarket - they had thai iced tea on the second page of the drink menu which i didn't see until later and i probably would've wanted to order that instead. \\n\\nWhen all the food came, we could barely fit everything on the table, haha. The lettuce appetizer was weird to me. It was just pieces of lettuce stir-fried with mushrooms and oyster sauce I think. It was too salty and I think it would have worked better with some sort of asian veggie rather than lettuce. The Siu Yoke is deep-fried pork belly, definitely not the siu yoke you would get at your regular chinese restaurant. It was interesting to try. I normally don't really like siu yoke anyways so I didn't care too much for it. The roast duck was good! It was the SO's fave dish. The bulgogi bahn me sliders were interesting. I liked them but my favorite was definitely the roti canai.

We could not even finish half of them because of the shitty quality. We decide to get the check and leave. \\n\\nHere comes the extremely FUNNY part! When we received the check, we thought about according to their poor service and food, we would only give them 10% tip, but since it was Chinese New Year Eve, we would like to be kind and give them about 15%. Thinking about that, we left the credit card on the table. When the waitress came back with my credit card, I was told that the tip already been assigned that I only need to sign. And I looked at the number it was more than 20% tip! HOW COULD THEY EVEN THINK THEY DESERVES THAT AMOUNT?! Again, we were totally shocked!

Their spacious outdoor area is shaded by old oaks and the seating is picnic tables. Oh and wait for it.. they have a dog park! Yes, you can bring your well behaved fur babies with you and let them have a little fun too.  The inside has bar seating and a communal set up with picnic tables. Besides the mounted swine the decor is simple and clean.\\n\\nI grabbed a seat at the bar and was impressed with 100+ beers on tap. The beers are listed above the taps on small chalkboard panels. The beer menu is well rounded having a good variety of local beer, craft beers, 2 casks and some gluten free options. They also have a decent, reasonably priced wine selection and serve 2 wines on tap. I ordered a glass of Charles & Charles Cab-Syrah on tap which paired well with my meal. \\n\\nAbout 80% of the sausage is made in house. They also get some select items from Stuffed Cajun Meat Market, Broadleaf sausages and Smokey Denmark. They have some interesting offerings such as chicken tequila habanero, smokey and the boar (with wild boar & garlic) and they have about 4 vegetarian sausages (one is actually vegan). I perused the food menu on line and already knew I was going for the South Texas antelope and venison merguez. With your sausage you get your choice of bread, two toppings and up to two sauces. I went with pumpernickel wheat, caramelized onions, spicy peppers with a side of curry ketchup. The sausage was flavorful, juicy and the hints of red peppers, cinnamon and clove made it mouth watering. The caramelized onions and the pumpernickel wheat complimented the sausage however the peppers were a bit too hot for my liking (I just flicked them off).  I had a bite of the Louisiana Lightening, it was good but consider yourself warned, the heat from this bad boy is no joke.\\n\\nThe beer prices are slightly on the steep side in my opinion but they do run a happy hour which is 1/2 off draft beer. We had to wait a bit for our check as it got busy, considering they just opened I am sure this will improve. The bartender, Jesse, who served us was great to talk to and both knowledgeable about the food menu and the beer.\\n\\nI was overall impressed with the experience and plan to return this week to try new menu items and listen to live music. \\n\\nNote: check out their website for a map indicating where the paid lots and free street parking are available."},{"name":"Quincy Market","address":"4 S Market St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Great for tourists as many many many touristy shops and also for anyone who likes to shop while on vacationing as it has many mall type stores (check their main website for their store directory).

The attention to detail on the wood carvings was remarkable.\\n\\nWe ordered a few Fresh Squeezed IPAs because they're amazing. Crisp, citrusy and slightly hoppy. They sure do go down quick. And they paired perfectly with the homemade pretzel and mustard wings we ordered for snackage. The pretzel was soft, buttery and salty, served with tangy whole-grain mustard and a warm cheese sauce. Yum! \\n\\nThe wings were different but still tasty. Instead of the usual light dredge and a quick flash fry for a crispy coating, they were done buttermilk fried chicken style so they were much thicker, but still wonderfully seasoned and crispy, dressed in a honey maple gastrique.

And, really, I can't think of a better word to describe the simply amazing, impeccable brunch Emily R. and I had at Canoe today. It was - yeah, really - THAT good. \\n\\nI hadn't been to Canoe in quite awhile, and not since the repair-and-reopening, and was delighted when Em suggested it for our brunch meet-up. I'd been wanting to try the brunch I'd heard such good things about, and I honestly think this might be the best brunch-y meal I've had, possibly ever! \\n\\nA recap for you - and if you haven't tried it either, go and go soon - like next Sunday!! - \\n\\nService . . . everyone who works there was most gracious and welcoming and our server Leah was spot-on. Friendly, funny, knowledgeable and just all-around terrific. The kind of server I'd ask for next time I go, to see if I could sit in her section. She and Emily even talked tomato plantings and such, we enjoyed and chatted with her that much! \\n\\nAtmosphere . . . simply lovely. And that is a favorite word and high compliment in my book, for something to be \\"lovely.\\" We went early, about 10:45, and it was just such a pretty day and the restaurant looks wonderful - even the gardens and patio area outside are delightfully lush and blooming, despite the heat we've had this summer. I love a good \\"comeback kid\\" and Canoe's definitely (back) on its game. \\n\\nI've saved the very best for last . . . Food . . . I almost don't know where to start! We pretty much had the most perfect brunch, ever . . . This part definitely gets its own \\"paragraph\\" (or several!).\\n\\nWe started with the warm summer corn soup - smartly, Canoe offers the choice of a half-serving (for only $3.50 - how can you not try it?!) and it is delicious. A bit of avocado and cream and a little parmesan crisp . . . mmmm, yummy. \\n\\nNext, we shared the simply amazing smoked salmon app - with goat cheese and served on a crispy potato \\"cake,\\" this is a dish that I will crave and make a point to return to Canoe just to order. Leah even split it for us on separate plates, each with their own pretty set-up, without being asked. It's those extra touches that make this such a wonderful place! \\n\\nFor our \\"entrees,\\" Emily went with the day's special (which I totally would have ordered if I liked shrimp, because it was just bound to be good) - the shrimp and (Anson Mill) grits. With arugula and several types of beautiful and delicious tomatoes, it was a gorgeous dish that was equally divine to eat! I opted for the fried green tomato \\"benedict\\" and got my eggs scrambled - shamwow!! It was perfect. Served with tiny diced hash browns, haricot verts and a few juicy heirloom tomatoes, my eggs were perfectly scrambled and delicious, everything on the plate was excellent - I didn't even think about touching the salt or pepper! \\n\\nEmily got the chocolate something dessert that looked like a hard-shell chocolate egg waiting to be cracked open, and when she did - voila! - caramel or cream or something inside was revealed and just waiting to be enjoyed. I sampled the Butter Pop ice cream - it even had its own little Cracker Jack topping! - and can honestly say not only was it yummy but totally original. Never have tasted anything like it before! \\n\\nOh, what a nice meal.

I will certainly need to do more research.  \\n\\nI was told that a a measure of good Tom Ka is the type of mushrooms used, maybe so.  This coconut milk with chicken soup is a delicious course to enjoy right after an appetizer.  The mushrooms are large, fresh and whole, I am not sure of the name, I just know that there were plenty.  The dish was delightfully limey with a hint of cilantro.  We opted for the larger portion that comes to the table in a hot pot(with a burner), so don't lean over to get a good whiff or you might find yourself penciling your eyebrows for a month.\\n\\nThe Chicken Satay was a little dry but the peanut sauce and the cucumber sauce were both delectable.  The peanut sauce was thick and savory and complimented the yellow curry on the satay.  The two sauces made me feel like I was getting two appetizers for the price of one.  The cucumber sauce was so different from the peanut sauce and good in its own right.\\n\\nIn my book they get extra points for serving jasmine tea since I haven't been feeling quite up to par lately.  The thai tea looked great but since I don't do the cow milk thing I will just have to take my dining companion's word for it in that it's the best he's had in town.\\n\\nMy entree was the Siamese Duckling.  The dish was piping hot with rice served on the side.  The rice was perfect and held its form, slightly sticky, but not gooey or overcooked.  The duckling was cooked right and was immersed in a slightly onioney spicy gravy with plenty of bok choi and basil leaves and ginger.  I didn't have to pick anything out of the dish that was inedible as with most chopped duck plates, it would seem that someone in the kitchen cared for my food before it was sent, nay, I know that they care.\\n\\nThe dining room was a little sterile and needs something to make it a bit more inviting, possibly more plants.  Although I will say that there is some comfort in seeing the cleanliness around me.  I think it's just the lack of visual interest.  Very good food nonetheless, and the service was timely and the server was helpful and about his business.  It is my hope that the people at Exotic Thai will continue to deliver at the level they are currently, and eventually move to a bigger space in their own building.

Because of our schedules, we decided to get together on a Wednesday ($3 small hot plates) instead. I had a Groupon so we couldn't partake in more than one promotion at a time which was fine since the selection of $3 small plates were of no interest to us.\\n\\nWe ordered several varieties of sushi to satisfy everyone & I have to mention if you're vegetarian I highly recommend the Buddha or Oregon Trail (see photos). The great tasting Buddha has tempura asparagus, green been, sweet potato & shiitake mushroom with a shiitake glaze. The sweet flavor tasting Oregon Trail also has tempura asparagus but with cream cheese, cucumber & an inari laying ever so delicately across each roll.\\n\\nNot vegetarian? Neither am I nor the rest of my party, so an addition to the two veggie rolls we ordered a tempura shrimp (super awesome), a salmon skin (kinda crunchy), spicy tuna (spicy?...agreed), salmon nigiri (personally not a fan) & a sashimi roll (pretty good). Four of us ate a total of nine sushi rolls with not a piece of rice left on the plates. Damn, sushi tastes so good!\\n\\nThis is great sushi but it's expensive (over $65 before Groupon) & that's why when we do meet it's on Happy Hour Tuesdays. The service seems faster at the bar so if you're dining with friends just sit back, relax, eat edamame & drink sake because great sushi takes time to prepare & it's well worth the wait!"},{"name":"Passport Sips & Tapas","address":"59 Washington St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4","text":"I have basically tried the entire menu by now and have yet to have something I did not like.

The pumpkin spice coffee was absolutely superb. It is probably tastier than even my over-the-top Starbucks concoction. \\n\\n3) Make sure that all members in your party are with you before requesting a seat.\\n\\n4) If you get an omelet and have to choose between the chopped potato home fries or Omar's mashed and grilled hash brown... CHOOSE THE MASHED & GRILLED! It was herb-y in the best way...not aggressive, and extremely distinct and memorable. \\n\\n5) If you're trying to decide between this place and its neighbor and rival, choose Ball Square Cafe! I found it to be cleaner, warmer, more welcoming, more fragrant, and more in tune with the little details (that matter)! Ball Square Cafe cares about the customer. I like that in a venue. If you're indifferent then feel free to go next door! \\n\\n6) Whatever you planned on talking about with your party, will be null and void. For 2 hours, all my friends and I did was eat, talk about the food we were eating, and take pictures of food (ours and other folks') ---I haven't seen my friends in a while but we just too impressed with our overall dining experience and our plans to discuss NYE plans, never happened. \\n\\n*Pros:* \\n\\n1) The owner, Mike, knows how he wants his business to run. He runs a tight ship! He has both customer and server/owner etiquette  at the forefront of his mind. He was friendly and even brought my party a complimentary strawberry-shortcake Belgian waffle (just because) that we devoured! \\n\\n2) The food is amazing! I am a stickler for ambiance, food presentation and food taste. Truth be told, I like food that gives a darn! I like food that does an additional mirror check before leaving the kitchen. Not only was the food at Ball Square Cafe delicious, but it was also beautiful! I took pictures of everything! \\n\\n3) What we ordered: \\n\\nNova Smoked Salmon Omelet, \\nArtichoke Omelet, \\nCeltic Omelet\\n\\n5 stars for--- flavor, freshness, fragrance, friendliness, and the familial feel \\n\\n*The Only Con:*\\n\\nIt's too late to add an additional door to keep out the inclement weather, but I wish there was some kind of partition or something to separate the diners from the elements (on such brisk days like today! 27 degrees F!) \\n\\n\\n*I wonder if...*\\n\\n* ...they do outdoor seating in the summer time.

The bread on the bahn mi was lightly toasted, but that translated as stale. The beef bulgogi meat lacked flavor, and was extremely dry.

I was with my good friend Dave and had about 1 hour to kill as there were 2 opening bands for Mastodon which we didn't really care about. We were standing right in front of The Lansdowne and we looked at each other, shrugged our shoulders and went in for a beer. \\nRight away, the staff at the door and the Hostess were very friendly and polite and pointed us onward. It was about 8 PM on a Thursday night and yep, the Red Sox were playing, so there was decent activity outside and inside. We found a couple of open seats at the bar and saddled up.\\nThe bartenders were great. They all were friendly, professional and helpful. WOW, what a concept. I forgot what it was like to actually feel like a welcomed customer! They actually looked you in the eye when they spoke to you and smiled on many occasions. (Hear that Boston Beer Works!?)\\nWe weren't really hungry so we just had a couple of pints of Sam's Red Ale, which was fresh and tasty. They seemed to have a decent selection of bottle and draft beer as well as many food offerings, so we were thinking of heading back in after the show for a bite to eat and another beer.\\nWhen I mentioned we were going next door to the Mastodon concert, one of the bartenders expressed her enthusiasm and jealousy, as she was a fan. She also mentioned that a few guys from Mastodon were in earlier and could be back after the show.\\nPost show: The Lansdowne is cranking and packed, as the Sox game had ended. There was now a cover charge as a live band was playing inside, however the staff at the door recognized us from 3 hours earlier and waved us in no charge. How cool is that? We sat at the bar and had the burger sliders and a beer. The service and food was great overall.\\nAnd yes, Brent from Mastodon sat near us at the bar and had a beer. He looked moody, reflective and tired, so I just gave him a nod and thumbs up for the show which he quietly acknowledged.\\n5 Stars ***** for friendly staff, great food, beer selection, location and atmosphere!"},{"name":"Big Dogs Street Hots","address":"Davie & Marinaside Crescent","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely the BEST hot dogs in Vancouver!

But on this night we had to repeatedly ask for more water, as nobody appeared to be paying attention.   Our water glasses were close to empty most of the night - it was surreal!\\n\\nNext, I've had their delicious prime rib many times over the years and it's usually spot on.  This piece of prime rib was comprised of mainly gristle and fat.

I was trying to eat the soup when our entrees were delivered, and wound up not finishing the soup.

We went out of our way to point out that the side dish was not included on bill.  Our waiter replied that he would just go ahead and comp it, especially since we had experienced some problems during the evening.  Then he realized that \\"he can't take it off the bill since it's in the system already\\", so despite our evening, and pointing out an error, Houston's was unable to comp a $5 side item.  \\n\\nOur waiter was extremely nice and was definitely trying hard.

Their Chirashi Don is okay but more expensive for less fish than the other options. \\nI've had their special rolls and found wafer thin fish on top, which barely adds any flavor and feels not worth the price. \\nI also stopped ordering their tempura to go because they put it straight into the styrofoam with hot oil which melts the container and is probably dangerous. \\nOn occasion I've received the sashimi in a big slab of fish, scored but not cut all the way through. \\nTheir gyoza falls apart as soon as you touch it. \\nGenerally a mixed bag.

Hands down the worst experience with any restaurant/pizzeria/Papa John's ever; congrats to them on that.  \\n\\nHere's how my experience went.  Ordered a pizza with a delivery time of 30 minutes.  45 minutes later I call Papa Johns and wait for 15 minutes for someone to answer the phone (no one even picked up to ask me to hold).  When I explain my pizza never arrived the guy gets me to Raven the manager.  That girl is a mess.  She has several excuses and versions of the story - the pizza hasn't been made, the pizza left an hour ago, etc.  I told her I didn't want a pizza that had been in a car for an hour and that a refund would be fine.  She refuses the refund offers me free breadsticks on my next order.  Not only am I not planning to order from them ever again, but she still hasn't addressed when the pizza is coming.  She then hangs up on me.  Sweet!  I call back, because I have no pizza and no refund, another 10 minutes before someone answers.  The guy that answers puts Matt the manager on the phone.  Matt is possibly a bigger jerk than Raven.  Who do these people think they are?  I'm being treated like I'm the crazy one, but I have no refund and no pizza.  He tells me the driver tried to deliver the pizza, but couldn't get to my building because of construction.  Umm how do they think I get to my building every day?  There is one side street closed off and at least 4 other ways including the main way I can think of to get to the building with zero construction.  But here's what really irks me - NO ONE CALLED ME!  The delivery guy didn't call when he was at my building \\"in construction\\" and the store didn't call once he returned with my pizza.  That's absolutely ridiculous and incredibly shady.  I also didn't receive an e-mail.  It states on their confirmation e-mail if there is a problem with an order they will call you first and e-mail you if you cannot be reached via phone.

Also have a nice fireplace in the middle of the restaurant and a space for live bands outside in an enclosed patio.\\n\\nMy only complaint was that they only allow Happy Hour pricing in the bar area, which is pretty small.  So the bar was PACKED with people on a Wednesday while the more spacious dining room was virtually empty.  It would be nice if they designated a little more space for the Happy Hour.  \\n\\nOne more little tip, if you are a Costco member, you can buy $100 worth of gift cards for NXNW for only $80, so that's like getting 20% off.

Most of the negative reviews were spot on! The service lacked in all areas, I couldn't get my coffee refilled so I took it upon my self to grab it and fill my cup up myself. There seemed to be plenty of staff and they were all walking about but doing what could be debatable. \\n\\nIt's a shame that so many tourists come to visit our lovely city of Portland and hear how wonderful our brunches are, and to come across such establishments that are subpar and leave feeling dissatisfied is quite shameful. Typically I'd just mark this experience off as a loss, but given the $8 parking I just don't want people to leave here with a bad taste in their mouths. On Sundays they only offer the breakfast menu and dinner later in the evening, even though there was it was breakfast they offered some lunch options. The waiter informed us that they were going to be adding even more lunch options to the breakfast menu in the weeks to come.\\n\\nIt is quite possible we did not order their signature dishes, though the dishes we did order should have just been breakfast 101 for the cooks. My wife ordered the waffle and added a fried chicken breast on top, the waffle was undercooked and a bit soggy. The chicken was overly greasy and bland, or maybe we are just spoiled by places like \\"The Screen Door\\", and \\"Pine State Biscuits\\". I ordered the NW Logger which came with bacon, sausage, eggs, hash browns, and pancakes. It was nothing amazing, but it was okay. Tasted like pancakes out of a box and the hash browns were greasy and cool and lacked in the flavor department. Lots of people ordered the creme brule French toast, which looked pretty good. \\n\\nThere were some aspects that I did enjoy, they served Stumptown coffee, provided Portland ketchup, and had Aardvark sauce (yum!)

For $3.70 a slice, the pizza was huge and loaded with ingredients including spinach, mushrooms, fresh garlic and extra cheese.

I had really wanted to try Buttermilk Kitchen, but the 45 minute wait was not worth it.  So, I checked Yelp, and found Joy Cafe nearby.  We decided to check it out.  It's a quaint little cafe, with outdoor and indoor seating.  If you ever watch the Food Network, I saw that they actually had a visit with Guy on Diners, Drive ins, and Dives and were featured on the show.  How cool is that?!?  Their brunch menu consisted of typical brunch foods items like eggs benedict, granola, breakfast burrito, omlettes, sandwiches, pancakes, biscuits, grits, and salads.  But the cool thing was they home-make most everything, including brioche rolls and bagels.  Service was terrific. The waitress started us off with these complimentary mini carrot cake muffins and chocolate chip bars.  The muffins were moist and flavorful, definitely my favorite!  Next came the meal.  I had decided on the Garden, a brioche bun with cheddar scrambled eggs, house hot sauce mayo, spinach, mushroom, caramelized onions, and arugula.  It was very good!  I loved the chipotle-type mayo.  I heard a table nearby ask for their hot sauce, and heard it was homemade, so I asked for a side of it. To me, it wasn't that spicy, and I couldn't pinpoint just what was in it, but it didn't taste as good as their mayonaise.  The only disappointment was the biscuit.  So, I absolutely love a good biscuit, and am obsessed with biscuits in Asheville, NC, because they know how to make amazing breakfast there.  And the biscuit came out large, but quite hard and didn't have any flavor.  Even with butter, it still tasted dry and just not appealing.  And they only had grape jelly.  I was bummed, but hey, I'd still come back and try some other menu items.

So the \\"melt\\" came and we ordered two and only got one , so I started on the first one while my friend was trying his hardest to chew on the sawdust brisket ! The \\"melt\\" had no cheese , when I say no cheese I mean it maybe had 3 strands of grated cheese , and the so called \\"steak\\" was nothing but sliced roast beef , it was a joke !

As soon as we opened the outer set of doors we caught it:  Sort of a damp/mildewy smell.  It permeated the entire restaurant, reminiscent of a vinyl tablecloth wiped with a damp, dirty rag.  What a turnoff, not really sure why we didn't turn around and leave immediately except that we were pretty hungry.  We'd just been on a mission to Ikea and had an hour's drive home so we wanted lunch.  Anyway, once we got used to the idea of dining with this pervasive odor, we actually had a decent meal.  We both ordered a BBQ trio platter and all told had baby backs, St. Louis ribs, smoked sausage, BBQ chicken breast, smoked turkey and 4 different sides.  Amazingly the poultry options were actually more moist than the ribs which is pretty unusual.  The ribs had decent flavor but were by no means falling off the bone tender.  They weren't actually dry, but a little longer on the heat and they might've been.  We both really enjoyed the smoked sausage; it tasted very similar to when we smoke our own at home.  Hubby enjoyed the mac & cheese and I the coleslaw.  We also had the fries and apples.  We shared the ridiculously large chocolate cake and didn't finish it.  Service was fine which is good since each member of the waitstaff only had one table to cover while we were there.  The ladies' room was tidy but the bench in our booth had completely come away from its base and I almost had a mishap.

Today it was lemon-lime with watermelon vodka, but they were out of watermelon vodka by the time I got there, so I tried it with pear instead. Delicious!\\nThe food, however, needs a little work. I love the concepts on the menu but the execution on some of them is poor. This time I ordered the sriracha shrimp tacos. I couldn't really taste the sriracha at all and the pineapple chunks in the salsa were so huge that I wouldn't even really consider it a salsa. Everything was a little dry. The saffron rice was also dry, and the black beans were just plain... they could have used a little spice. My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork hoagie which did not seem to have any sauce on it. He remarked that he'd never had a pulled pork sandwich without BBQ sauce. That would have made it a lot better.\\nThe high point of our meal in terms of the food was the Best Coast quesadilla with pulled pork. The cheese, sour cream and guacamole saved this from being dry like the rest of the meal, and if I return I will be ordering either this or the BBQ Belly quesadilla (which I had last time I went and it was delicious).\\nAs far as the service goes, it was friendly albeit a little slow. There were three servers and only five tables but we still barely saw our server and it took several minutes to cash out.\\nAll in all, this place has some serious potential. They're really close but just missing the mark. I love the idea of having a tiki room in Columbus, but Grass Skirt is not quite up to par with other local restaurants. I would definitely be more inclined to return for food if there were some new menu items that were prepared better. For the price point, the food should be a little better. We spent almost $70 for our entrees and appetizer and one drink each, including tip. I could spend that amount elsewhere and have a better meal.

He told us the lunch special, and was very knowledgeable on the beers available, and what had been blown. I can see how service outside is a little slow, though at the bar no worries.  The food is excellent. All house made sausages, and the lunch special is hard to beat. One of their traditional sausages, a side, and a Texas pint for $8. That is a very good deal. Andouille sausage, kaloche bun, and braised greens. For the sausage and bun, they come with house recommendations as far as type of bun and what it it topped with.  Which is great. Or you can choose your own. The sausage itself was excellent. I thought the greens were very good, though not great. I had some German potato salad as well, which was excellent. Very flavorful, with a good vinegary kick. My buddies Italian sausage look great as well.\\n\\nOn to the beer! Tons of taps. Right at 100, which is ridiculous. Also a cask, that happened to be out. Austin breweries are very well represented, as well is the rest of the state. Close to 30 plus Texas taps. I saw some Firestone Walker on as well. Really an excellent selection all around.

I pulled over to examine the \\"latte\\" to find out they had taken a chi tea bag, put it in luke warm water and poured foam on top. Not only was this NOT a latte, but there was no whip cream so the tea was bland and had hardly any hint of chi. The foam was obviously from skim milk because it tasted horrible.

We arrived around 5pm.   Parking is a bit of a walk but there's lot's of free parking down the side street.   We ordered the sampler appetizer and the bit of everything BBQ to try everything.   The service was awesome and staff friendly.   The decor is how you would expect if you've visited BBQ joints in Texas/Carolina, with lot of family table or booth seating.   There's a fireplace and bar and lots of sports for TVers.   The drinks are bourbon themed and were delicious.\\n\\nThe food is why we were there and was awesome.  Real real BBQ from a BBQ grill - cooked fresh and tasted fresh.   Prices were reasonable for two of us.   I can't wait until the outdoor seating heated opens."},{"name":"Gourmands Neighborhood Pub","address":"2316 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Second deadly sin is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, wow.  The house made pickles, pickled carrots & onions, and the fresh chips were a nice pair. I ordered half the sandwich and a bowl of the beer cheese soup and didn't eat for about 15 hours..so filling.  Think all the bread is homemade, tastes like it anyhow.\\n\\nGot the food \\"to go\\" but looking forward to hanging at this cool establishment.  There's a bar where every seat was full, a pool table in the back... good parking.
