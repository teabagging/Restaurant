Of course I had to visit, since most of the local \\"bbq\\" has been disappointing to a Texas native.  I've now stopped by Wayne's several times,.  The bottom line on Wayne's Smoke Shack is  -- while there are some positives, I am still disappointed.  However, many local folks really like it.\\n\\nI was weaned in Fort Worth on first Walter Jetton's, and then Angelo's BBQ (and more recently Railhead). Then  I spent several decades throughout central Texas, regularly visiting and enjoying all the regional standards. I was a frequent patron of the markets in Luling and Lockhart, and I have repeatedly sampled the goods from each of the places enshrined in the wall photos in Wayne's.  (I really liked the back room at the old Kreuz Market, now Smitty's).  This review is from a sound knowledge base of the important BBQ style Wayne  (correctly) praises.  \\n\\nWhen you enter his shopping center storefront, Wayne cheerfully greets each customer at the cutting board. He seems like a really nice guy, and I bet he has a lot of stories!  He explains the \\"format\\" of getting lunch by the pound, a sensible way that may be new to his customers.  The \\"decor\\" is entirely appropriate -- wooden tables where there is no problem sharing a long table at crowded times.  He really knows the traditions.  You'd almost expect to see knives chained to the tables, like at the old Kreuz.  Proper BBQ is sliced on the spot, and served on butcher paper, and this is the way Wayne does it.  And he sells it 'til its gone:  another proper way to run a BBQ place.\\n\\nFirst, the BBQ:  Brisket - very moist (unusually so).  Wayne offers a choice -- either \\"lean\\" or \\"moist\\" cuts.  This is an unusual distinction in bbq parlance.  The usual distinction is between flat cuts of brisket (universal for slicing) and point cuts of brisket (fattier, marled, and less desirable). When you cook a whole brisket, you get both parts, and of course preferences will vary.  I prefer the flat cut parts; the rest (trimmed) is for chopped beef and for leftovers like chili (which Wayne's does have).  Each time I have been to Wayne's I have been served slices from point cut brisket, and it had been \\"moist\\" but too fatty for my taste.  It is very tender (falls apart), and no knives are needed.  But too much fat for my taste. This is different from decades of experience in Central Texas.  \\n\\nWayne's brisket has disappointingly little flavor -- even repeated shakes of the salt shaker did not make it savory.  There was no detectable smoke flavor or overtones.  There was a nice crust, but the \\"moistness\\" rendered the crust wet and limp -- no bite or \\"mouth-feel\\".  After finishing a half-pound of moist brisket, there remained about 3 ounces of fatty bits and \\"juice\\" (=oil) on the paper. I never left anything on the paper at old Kreuz Market. \\n\\nRibs -- same price as brisket ($14/lb). Wayne asks how many bones. I had 3.   My ribs were brought from a warm-cabinet where they'd been stored.  They were \\"ok\\".  Lots of very tender fall-off-the-bone meat.  Much fat remained, it had not been fully rendered.  Nice crusty-coating, but soggy (moist). Maybe storing bbq wrapped in a warmer can lead to a loss of texture.  The ribs had no flavor at all.  Maybe all the rub was washed off by the \\"moistness\\"?   But the ribs were tender and juicy.\\n\\nSausage -- made from some kind of organic cows I think.  That must be a Boulder necessity.  Bottom line -- the sausage is sausage, but it is not Elgin sausage.  Enough said.  It is good that Wayne has sausage for folks that want it.\\n\\nChicken -- why would anyone go to a Texas BBQ place for chicken?  \\n\\nSides -- sides are not a tradition, so not too important -- baked beans were the worst I have ever had.  I did not finish them. Slaw was OK. I didn't try anything else.  Thanks to Wayne's for having sides for folks that want them.\\n\\nRolls -- These come with the meat -- they're OK, hot, good with butter, a little dough-y but they will certainly keep your belly and backbone from bumping (apologies to Guy Clark).  The last time I was at Wayne's, it was busy lunchtime, and there were no rolls when I was served.  Got some 10 minutes later.  Now, the simple solution would be to imitate a central Texas BBQ place, and have few loaves of white bread or soda crackers right at the counter to served with the meat.  Hot rolls are nice, but white bread would have done the trick nicely.\\n\\nUnanswered (maybe I should have asked) -  where is the meat cooked?  In the central Texas tradition, one sees the meat cooking.  At Wayne's storefront, I saw no evidence of BBQ production.  I guess with clean-air requirements, they would need smoke arrestors and scrubbers on their discharge.  Maybe they cook on-site, but it is not easy to see where or how.  Maybe they cook the meat some non-traditional way.  It is certainly tender, but it has no flavor or smokiness."},{"name":"1886 Chinese Fine Dining","address":"39 Smithe Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"This place only look fancy and located in the new casino downtown.

I am very picky when it comes to my pizzas, so my eyes immediately fell to the \\"build your own pizza\\" side of the menu. There were four options for the crust (white, wheat, multi grain, and veggie), numerous sauce options (ranged from the standard red tomato paste to the more exotic cilantro pesto), and a wide variety of toppings. After assessing my risk (weight gain) /reward (gastronomical fulfillment) profile, I decided to get the 7\\" multigrain crusted pizza with the ground walnut, olive oil, garlic & parmesan sauce, topped with mushrooms and prosciutto.\\n\\nThe pizza itself was extremely delicious but incredibly greasy. I was a big fan of the crust, as it was a bit crispy at the bottom (tasted like a pan-seared pizza!). The ground walnut sauce was awesome; it was brilliantly flavorful and the nuttiness balanced the saltiness of the prosciutto. After finishing my personal sized pizza, I fell into a food coma and ended up taking a nap for 2 hours (so much for my Sunday errands).\\n\\nMy pizza was only about $3 (after using my $5 gift certificate), so I cannot complain about the price.

We haven't been back for a long time because it was so darn embarrassing.\\n\\nI thought, China Bay! (sorry China Bay, it was a risk I had to take).\\n\\nIt's kind of fun inside, and was surprisingly crowded at 11:30 on a Thursday. But we were whisked to a table. Dad was happy because the chairs were padded. (Wong's king didn't have comfy enough chairs and he made a stink last time). We were immediately served iced water with a lemon slice (nice) and hot tea. Also nice.\\n\\nDad chose the dishes, which was annoying. He picked Snow Pea Chicken (yum, fine), and Scallops with Vegetables, which is also a good choice, but an awful lot like Snow Pea Chicken, if you know what I mean.Same sauce, also snow peas. Sigh. The lunch specials are a real deal at  either $5.50  ( vegetarian dishes) and $6.50.

The Tzatziki sauce itself was lacking in that cucumber flavor and was on the runny side, vs. good tzatiki which is usually thick.  The falafel is flat in shape here vs. in a ball as they said it was easier to put in wraps that way.  It had no flavor, and was dry after having sat out in the food heater for a bit.  The dolmades was nothing special, but at least OK.  The best part was the eggplant mixture.  It was greasy but had great flavor and spice.  The salad was OK as well, at least it was good lettuce vs. just iceberg stuff that most of these type of places have.  \\n\\nI wouldn't come here again, but I had a lot of food, didn't need much for dinner that night, for a very cheap price.\\n\\nOne positive is they do have a clearly marked separate Gluten Free menu."},{"name":"Sweet Pepper","address":"559 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is good. \\n\\nit offers really good lunch specials, and a variety of good thai food."},{"name":"North By Northwest Restaurant & Brewery - Stonelake","address":"10010 Capital Of Tx Hwy N","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Food is wonderful and I think it's quite a bargain for what u get, everything on the menu seems unique and interesting, it's a fancier more gourmet version of bj's which I am very fond of as well.

I've been meaning to check out their Portland location since they opened, but wanted to wait until after the buzz died down a bit, then just never really found a good reason to hit them up.\\n\\nDeschutes is housed in an attractive brick building right in the heart of the Pearl, just up the street from the Gerding Theater (nee Portland Armory).  Inside there's an impressive array of wood: intricate carvings, overhead arches, great slabs of lumber in the tabletops and ceilings...It's best not to think about whether an entire forest of old growths gave their lives for all this wood, just enjoy it!\\n\\nAs should be the case in any good brew pub, they have plenty of exclusive beers on tap - many not even available at their flagship location in Bend.  My dad and I split a taster tray, and chose the following beers:\\n\\n1. Buzzsaw Brown: yeah, it's available elsewhere (on tap and bottle), but it's a solid Northwest Brown Ale and my pops had never tried it before.\\n\\n2. Jubelale: Also available elsewhere, but it's nice to try it right from the source and I wanted to compare it with...\\n\\n3. Super Jubel Spiced: basically a bigger Jubel due to additional malt.  Definitely stronger, and the increased ABV completely hid the additional 10 IBUs supposedly packed into the brew.  Overall, I prefer the regular Jubelale\\n\\n4. Black Pearl Ale: A very nice, easy drinking dark ale - I'd like to see the Black Pearl work it's way into the regular Deschutes rotation, but it probably butts a little too close to Black Butte Porter.  I ended up getting a pint of this after we killed the tasters.\\n\\n5. Maple Gold: An \\"experimental golden ale\\" brewed with Munich and Victory specialty malts, and designed to highlight the flavor and aroma of the single experimental hop it's brewed with.  Pops really like this beer, and got a pint of it - but I found it to have too much of a floral, tea-like sweetness.\\n\\n6. Big Red Oak: Basically a double-Cinder Cone, aged 2 months in Oregon Pinot Noir barrels.  This was a very nice, very big beer - and at 10+% and 75 IBUs, it's no surprise they only serve it in snifters (for roughly the same price as a pint of their other brews).  But they don't charge you more for it in the taster tray, so that might be the best way to try this interesting brew.  I really liked it, but wanted something a little lighter with my dinner.\\n\\nSpeaking of dinner, I ordered a pepperoni pizza and was a little disappointed.  It's served on a cracker-thin crust, with very little in the way of cheese or sauce, and I had no problem polishing off the whole thing in one sitting.\\n\\nThere were a few other items on the menu that looked interesting, but most seemed a bit spendy (they gotta pay for all that expensive decor and Pearl-eriffic rent somehow).  My mum went with the traditional fisn 'n chips, and the portion was generous.  Pops had one of the specials - a Buzzsaw Brown Flatiron Steak - he had no complaints!\\n\\nService could have been a bit quicker, especially as the place was nowhere near capacity when we arrived at about 5:30pm, but it didn't interfere with our enjoyment as the we had a lot to catch up on with the fam.\\n\\nWe finished off with a couple deserts - one was a berry meringue thingy that was quite nice, and but the \\"beeramisu\\" was really quite outstanding.\\n\\nDeschutes is another one of those \\"great for taking out of town visitors\\" places; the beers are top notch, and actually not that over priced.  The food was decent, and reasonably priced for the Pearl, but not outstanding and certainly not cheap.\\n\\nFor my money, I'd prefer the homier, quirky neighborhood vibe of a place like Rogue Distillery and Public House (http://www.yelp.com/biz/rogue-ales-public-house-portland#hrid:YEC9ofOliKLKwVcEOPW8GQ), but Deschutes is definitely more visually impressive, and may work better for those occasions where you want a really memorable experience."},{"name":"Dosa n Curry","address":"447 Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"I am SO HERE for this place.

The first is because we were in recently and had truly excellent service from all of the staff we encountered despite the fact that the place was very busy. We arrived at 5:30 and were told a 45 minute wait, which was fine. We went over to the bar and ordered a couple of glasses of wine and then chatted in an empty corner. During that time, I approached the very busy front desk and to ask a question about the menu. I was given some great recommendations in a friendly, unrushed manner. We were seated before the 45 minutes (at least it felt that way). Our server was Daniel G. He provided us with really quick service, addressed a question about the ingredients in the honey mustard by actually asking the kitchen staff and writing it down for us (totally unexpected, but greatly appreciated). At one point I commented to my husband that we had a great server...and that he was soooo cute! After we ordered and were served our dessert, Dan mentioned that he heard my comment and that our dessert was on the house! \\n\\nNow to my second reason for updating this review.

So, I went to Yelp to find out about the restaurant and was surprised by the number of polarized reviews. We were especially concerned about the poor service, rude wait staff and questionable food quality. Nonetheless, we went there today at 11:00 am for Dim Sum.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, we were warmly greeted by every Jin Wah employee who passed us. The restaurant was probably 75% full, but we were quickly seated (and we had a party of 8). Tea and water were both brought as soon as we sat down and the water was fine (no off putting aroma or taste) and the tea was excellent; hot and flavorful with no bitterness that would suggest it had been over-brewed or sitting too long).  And the Dim Sum we had was all very good. It was flavorful and not overly oily or salty.  Service throughout our meal was fast, friendly, and efficient. We rarely waited for any dish, but also never felt rushed.  The food was so good, that I ordered Singapore Noodles to go and had them for dinner. They too were excellent.\\n\\nWe will definitely recommend Jin Wah to our Westside friends, and go back ourselves.

The gravy was watery and without flavor.  The curds were a bit cold.

Our table received prompt water and drink refills, even after we had finished eating and were staying just for chitchat.  The Original took full responsibility when it served my friend an incorrect order.  We noted that a manager personally delivered the corrected order as well as ~special mustard.  My friend's dinner was also comped, which was a nice gesture.  So many places in Portland try so hard to be Portland, that it's nice to go to a place that values its customer service.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is another reason why I would keep coming back here despite its mediocre food.  It's just lovely, chill, and a little bit of modern meets Twin Peaks diner.  The finishing touches they give to their food can seem a little gimmicky, particularly since it's not that great to begin with.  You may think that they could spend their time perfecting their poutine first rather than serving you an adorable stack of miniature pancakes.

We did dinner Friday night and the place was packed, always a good sign. Our table wasn't quite ready so we placed ourselves at the bar (naturally). They do a fantastic French 75 here, very crisp; however, do note they are $13 a pop so it adds up when you have a few with your meal. \\n\\nI love the fact that while the restaurant feels very spacious thanks to the open floor plan, but it's cozy at each table. The atmosphere was lively compare to other BLRG restaurants, which are more traditional (or stuffy). Our waiter greeted us right as we sat down and made a few menu recommendations. We started our meal with the chilled pork shoulder spread and French onion soup. Both were amazing. The pork shoulder spread was seasoned to perfection and the French onion soup, really the best I've ever had (mostly thanks to the giant piece of gruyere on top, mmmm). Friend got the Pailiard de Poulet, which was the perfect dish if you want something light. I, on the other hand, decided on a hearty steak with green peppercorn sauce. However, when the dish got to the table, I was a bit surprised because it was sitting on a plate full of mushroom sauce (I'm allergic). I suppose it was my mistake for not asking but then again it doesn't say anything about mushroom in the dish on the menu. The manager offered to take the dish back for a do-over, but it came back out 2 minutes later it was obvious they just re-plated it without the sauce. Doesn't solve the problem because the bottom of my steak still has mushroom sauce on it. I did not like that because allergy is a serious issue and they just cut corners. I ended up just eating a small piece from the top and gave the rest for my friend to take home. The piece I did have was tasty, the peppercorn sauce has a strong kick so make a note if you can't handle spicy.\\n\\nDesert is a must at any French restaurant. We shared an order of chocolate terrine which was just the right amount of sweetness. \\n\\nDespite the steak incident. I loved everything else I had and service was fantastic.

The menu rotates from time to time, according to what's in season and what they get from the local farmers and markets.\\n\\nTheir mixed drinks are all very tasty, and they have a decent beer selection. I wish it would rotate a bit more often, but they always have a dunkel in bottles that I'm a fan of, so it's sort of my staple.\\n\\nThe wait staff is incredibly attentive, friendly, and fast.

At the end of the meal, you have the opportunity to clear your date's plate from the table, making you look like a thoughtful human being that had a decent upbringing. \\n\\nAND ONTO THE REVIEW\\n\\nThis crazy little self serve hole in the wall happens to be the best Thai food joint in the greater Boston area. \\n\\nIt's cheap, amazingly flavorful, fast and conveniently located at the top end of Boylston Street (also perfect for a mid shopping day recharge since I'm usually the one carrying the bags). \\n\\nAs I have come to learn, when a restaurant is named after a dish, it means that you should order THAT DISH. And this place in no exception. The Pad Thai (I usually get the crispy chicken Pad Thai with extra veggies) is divine. The fried chicken makes it heavy in the way that Chinese food is, but eating the fresh veggies makes me feel better about myself so I get it anyway. \\n\\nPlus as an x-server I appreciate that they ask you to clear your own table, scrape off your plate and put it in the bin.

I have gotten it many times over the years and I have never had it come out bad. From any Uno's location. They seem to have mastered this one!\\n\\nFor our second meal we got the chicken parm! All I can say is WOW! It comes with TWO chicken breasts and a ton of pasta! So much both of us could not have even finished it! The chicken is the best part. Its breaded to perfection. I don't know what they use but its a light bread. Its perfect! The meat sauce was pretty generic and the pasta is well...Pasta! It all combines into a TASTY Chicken parm! Come hungry!\\n\\nSo over all we spent about $50 total. This includes the tip. So for what we got the price was right on and fair! The server was very friendly, helpful, and welcoming. Quick and friendly is all that I can ask for!\\n\\nNow the one thing that I did not like. The menu has changed. I think its for the worst. They took a lot off of the menu. Now this isn't all that bad. They did get more desserts on the menu. Granted we didn't have any. We saw that the peanut butter cup is back! I cant wait to have this again! We will in the near future.

If someone vehemently disagrees, please contact me so I can get over there asap.  Royal China pretty much blends into the rest of the dim sum establishments here in ATL.  I came here with a friend a few Sundays back.  Surprisingly, there was no wait even at noon, although the place was very hoppin'.  They do the carts here just like Oriental Pearl and China Delight.  In terms of dishes that they offer, nothing really stands out in my memory.  I will say the variety here is pretty good, so you get the usual staples and some newer inventions because the chefs got bored.  Watch out for the carts that aren't hot b/c sometimes the stuff sitting on there has been around for a few rotations and it's kinda room temp by the time it gets to your table (example:  haam sui gok).  The one good thing about this place is that it has a cart that freshly pan fries radish cake and rice rolls with little dried shrimpies.  That would probably be the one thing that sets it apart from its competitors.  If you come, definitely check out that cart.\\n\\nOther things:\\n- This place was hella multicultural on the Sunday I went.  You got some East Asians, Southeast Asians, random white people.  Unsure if that correlates to the quality of the food.\\n- Waitstaff is kind of hit or miss with the languages.  It's not certain that they all share one common language to communicate...\\n- Hella parking here, so no worries about that.

We ordered Hush puppies, Pimento Cheese with Popovers, Fried Chicken - spicy, and Biscuits. When in Rome embrace the carbs! The hush puppies arrived first with a block of butter but were too cold to actually melt the butter but the flavor was there. The pimento cheese came next and was lacking something - perhaps the sharp cheddar taste most pimento cheese spreads have. Also only 1 of our 4 popovers was a true popover and hollow on the inside. The other 3 were like bread rolls. We ended up putting the cheese on the hush puppies which was very tasty. Next came the fried chicken - I loved that they allowed you to order all white pieces.

I'm a fan of the thin crust pizza and there are many types to choose from. When it's pizza I go for the buffalo or BBQ.\\n\\nThe Good:\\nPizza: Big slices, thin crust, generous toppings (which they should for the cost) always the right amount of cheese and not overboard with the sauce. Always depends on how you like your pizza though. I knew a girl who was a vegetarian until she tasted the buffalo chicken pizza! Very tasty, I don't think I've ever been disappointed with the food. The subs are very good too, the bread is crunchy and much better than the average sub shop rolls. The parmesan chicken is flavorful and perfectly warm. This place always hits the spot.\\n\\nThe Bad: \\nInconsistent prices in my opinion. What gets me is their poor calculated tax that doesn't make sense for what they say they are charging. $3.25 for anything that isn't cheese (According to the website.. sometimes I feel like it's really $3.75 in the restaurant) Which I understand they can charge that because students will still buy it. But then with tax I really owe them over $4-4.50? (should be around $3.45 for state food tax), but hey I could be wrong maybe they have the right to charge that much, it just seems wrong, I only notice it because it's the steepest amount of \\"tax\\" I've seen anywhere. \\nAlso ordering online prices are different. I remember on their website I planned on buying a specialty pizza, maybe $18 with change (including tax) was listed. But I figured I would call it in instead, but the guy told me it was $19 with change (also including tax).\\n\\nSo there are some weird prices they need to check out, I don't want to feel like I'm being cheated here so advertise correctly. \\n\\nFood-wise much better than the average pizza/sub shop, but there are kinks when it comes to prices."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've been here once before when I was in town and the last time I went, they were at their old location.

(The food is your typical food court style so don't expect 5 star restaurant) but it was still good food. Definitely pricier than other places (a sprite cost almost $4.00) but that was expected as this is a big tourism area.

While working in Portland, my coworker and I say a big sign with the name TOSIS on it. We looked as we drove past and noticed it was a big diner.  After making a few jokes about the name, we thought, \\"Hey, let's go eat there just for kicks!\\"  So we decided to make our last dinner in Portland for the week at Tosis, which happened to be on St. Patrick's Day.\\n\\nWe walked into the restaurant around 7pm, and were pretty much the only ones there.  However, not for long as people started coming in within the hour and the restuarant got packed!  They had a special menu for St. Patrick's Day.  I ordered the Irish Beef Stew, which was beef stew but with green peas for the green effect of the holiday.  I was given salad and bread before my entree arrived.  My coworker, who says he is around 60-ish years old, looked around at the other patrons and told me that I was the youngest person there by 30 years.    Haha.  So this place is frequented by an older clientele.  Must be good if these folks come back often!  \\n\\nMy salad was very basic, as in ice berg lettuce, carrots, and red cabbage.  It came with a small paper dinky cup of my dressing of choice.  The bread was a thick slice of soft loaf bread and had butter on the side.  Basic, yes, but however, it was all still very good. Definitely diner food but definitely yummy!\\n\\nWhen my Irish beef stew came out, I was surprised how much beef and veggies were in it.  I sat for a minute and took it all in.  The aroma was mouthwatering!  I should of saved my bread from earlier so I could sop up the stew juices.  The meat was so tender and veggies a nice \\"cooked but crisp\\", not soggy or mushy.  Mmmmm...\\n\\nAfter we finished our food, we were given a choice of either green jello or tapioca pudding for dessert. Neat!  I opted for the green jello since I was feeling festive.  \\n\\nI think if you are in the Portland area near Tosis, you should stop in.  I found out the name is a Greek name and that they are a Greek restaurant.  But there was nothing Greek about the menu!  Maybe I overlooked it.  You should try whatever specials they have for the day as I feel that this place puts alot of heart and soul into their cooking.  My meal may seem basic to alot of people, but it was one of those times where it's a cold and wet Pacific Northwest day and you want something to comfort you and stick to your ribs.

I'm with a diverse group of co-workers and friends on a Thursday night.  To delve into the details of our socioeconomic backgrounds would edge too close to implying that there's ever an excuse for what we encountered, but I'll just say that we were all behaving like typical  young professional bostonian's relaxing during the work week.  Hell, we were nowhere close to rowdy (as our ability to enter the W sans drama after this debacle would attest).  After standing at the door for a brief moment, the doorman began admitting our group.  Three members of our party are allowed to enter.  When the doorman gets to my friend and co-worker, a benevolent looking chap of African descent, suddenly our fortunes change.  The doorman determines that he, the least animated individual in our party, is too drunk to enter.  \\n\\nHmmm...something seems fishy to me.  Being  directly behind him in line, I ask the doorman why my friend is not allowed to enter.  No response. He refuses to even look at me. It only takes a brief moment for me to put two and two together. At this moment the first three members of our group return to the door to see what was taking us so long to enter.  One of our friends already has a pitcher of beer in his hand, a testament to just how empty the place was inside.  He asks the bouncer the cause for the hold up, and the bouncer responds that my friend is too drunk.  At this point, being the uppity minority I am, I chime in that it probably has more to do with our skin color than our level of intoxication (perhaps not exactly in those words).  To make a short story somewhat shorter, our party split up, we left our friends inside to finish their pitcher, and finished out the night at the W, all the while asking ourselves \\"did that just really happen?\\"\\n\\nAfter reading some of the other reviews on this place, I've noticed similar accounts that had no racial component.  I try pretty hard to avoid playing the race card, and can't remember the last time I felt the urge for a rousing chorus of \\"we shall overcome\\".

The lamb lollipops were a standout-- perfectly cooked, served with a kind of bacon jam for dipping.

They were cooked to perfection here. In fact, everything was cooked to perfection. The bacon was crispy and the eggs were over medium just like I asked for. You may be thinking that none of that is a big deal, but for some reason most breakfast restaurants struggle with these things.

A good thirty minutes passed, when he finally came back and saw that I still hadn't hardly touched my meal. Well. He was shocked when I told him he dropped the ball and blamed it on his phone ringing of the hook. Note: he didn't have any trouble greeting new diners coming in the door and taking their order, out taking their food out to their tables while I still waited for low sodium soy sauce. Also, I agree with another review that said something about a sauce leaving an after taste in my mouth. We ordered a 4 PC veggie egg rolls but after one bite I could tell that these are not freshly made and  left a terrible taste in my mouth. Hubby said his lemon chicken wasn't all that good and the sauce is just lemon and pineapple juice. \\nWe did tell the owner how he needs to change his service, and we won't be back.

It has a variety of little food-stalls where you can stop in and have a meal- anything from Vietnamese to giant waffles- while you shop. From my experience, the food is just okay- I've eaten at the Vietnamese and the Indian food stalls and been slightly disappointed both times. There is certainly better ethnic food available in Columbus as far as I'm concerned, and at a better price value than the food offered at North Market. However, I always make sure to bring money for Jenni's, an ice cream shoppe that offers a variety of unique flavors. Their $5 ice cream sandwiches are totally worth it- two huge, delicious macaroons with a hearty scoop of ice cream in the center. Delicious! The shops themselves offer a really cool variety of new foods to try (again, as long as you can afford to pay the rather high prices). There is a cheese stall that sells a cheese I love called Fromager d'Affinois- it's a double cream that melts in your mouth. I've only ever been able to find it at North Market, but I hope to find it somewhere else at some point because a friend of mine says she has seen it sold in Michigan for far less money than at NM.\\n\\nIn short: North Market is trendy, hip, cool, and offers a nice spectrum of different restaurants, shops, and foods that are all available for your eating pleasure...as long as you can afford it.\\n\\nNORTH MARKET: THE STORES ARE A LITTLE PRICEY, BUT OVERALL IT'S A DARN COOL PLACE."},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I love the food at Java, everything is D-lish, omelettes are awesome!

I really enjoyed the creamy mac and cheese, but I can understand someone who isn't used to nutritional yeast not enjoying it. The collard greens had a ton of flavor, and country baked steak was yummy too. Do keep in mind that the gravy does not microwave well.

After much research into upscale restaurants in the Disney World area, my wife and I decided on Capa.  We chose wisely.  First let me attempt to set the scene.  Capa is located on the 17th floor of the Four Seasons Resort Orlando.  The resort itself is opulent, lavish, beautiful and someplace I will definitely stay in the future.  There are great views of the Disney Property and Capa has outdoor seating where you get a VIP view of the nightly Disney fireworks. Prior to arriving the restaurant called to confirm the reservation, during that call they asked if we were dining for a special occasion, I told them we were celebrating our 30th anniversary.  We arrived about 30 minutes early and were promptly greeted with a \\"happy anniversary \\". We decided to enjoy a drink at the bar.  I had the Buena Vista a jalape√±o infused patron tequila topped with a citrus and salt foam with a sprinkle of espelette.  It was the best margarita I've ever had.  The best part is the Bartender gladly shared the recipe!  At precisely 6:30 the host took us to a more private dining area so we could enjoy our meal.  Capa is a Spanish Steakhouse, that serves Tapas, small plates, entree's from the parrilla, as well as raw bar, salads and accompaniments.  My wife had the Cerdo (pork belly with an apple pistachio sauce) and the Pulpo with charred leeks, fingerling potatoes, and smoked pork cracklings.  I got the Higado, (foie gras with a huckleberry pine syrup on top of toast points) and the Carne a Waygu beef carpaccio.  Every bite was absolutely delicious but the wife and I agree that the best was the Pulpo and the pork belly.  The Pulpo was par-boiled and then flash fried and when paired with the sauce was the best bite we had.  We then enjoyed the Pato, a pan seared duck breast served medium rare, it had a delicious pan sauce and exceeded our expectations.  They then served us a Lemon olive oil cake topped with a sorbet, the plate was presented with \\"Happy Anniversary \\" written in chocolate on the serving plate.  The dessert was on the house.

It wasn't bad, just my impression. Their sake selection was kind of disappointing though. Small, and commonly found. Their top shelf choice is Ty Ku which is a good sake, but nothing special. It's just too common in my opinion.\\n\\nService was good. Our waitress did a good job with recommendations and seemed very knowledgeable about their menu. Attentiveness was good as well. She was quick to clear finished dishes out of our way and was able to take off a badly made Vietnamese iced coffee from our check. \\n\\nThe food was decent overall, and it reminded me of food you can find in the Taiwanese night market in Taipei...just not nearly as awesome. Their curry, which they touted as their specialty, wasn't as impressive as they made it sound. It was rather bland in my opinion. It's pretty close to some Indian curries that I've had, but with less flavor. Here is what we ordered:\\n\\n* Lettuce Wraps w/ Korean Bulgogi Beef - This was really good and both my girlfriend and I enjoyed this. The meat however, wasn't what you expect of bulgogi. Still awesome and would order again.\\n\\n* Springs Rolls - Got this free just for checking in with Yelp . It's really just the typical spring roll you can find at just about any Asian restaurant that serves them. Good, but not mind blowing.\\n\\n* Curry Hawker Meatballs - Didn't find this particularly delicious. The meat seemed over-fried and tasted like chickpeas. The curry sauce it was in was ok. \\n\\n* Roast Duck - This is pretty much a play on Peking duck, except you don't get the flour wrap. I love duck and this didn't disappoint.\\n\\n* Fish Fillet with Black Bean Sauce - This was very good. 'nuff said.\\n\\n*Five Spice Porkettes - I really liked this. Reminds me of the seasoned fried chicken or pork you can at the Taiwanese night markets. I was expecting bigger portions for the price though.\\n\\n* Curry Laska - This would've been a great dish if their curry had more flavor. Still not bad though.\\n\\n* Char Kway Teo - I really liked this dish, but my girlfriend found it too salty. \\n\\n* Mango Sticky Rice dessert - This was a disappointment. The rice was too hard and not sticky enough. They also could've drizzled more of the sweet sauce on it. The mango with sherbet on the top was good though. If you want good mango sticky rice, Thai Basil is the place to go...if only it wasn't seasonal for them.\\n\\nOverall, it was a pleasant dining experience, but not particularly impressive.

The place is pretty small but well appointed- well lit, very clean, and comfortably decorated. Excellent excellent service- the gentleman that greeted us when we arrived (the owner/manager I'm guessing), also checked on us several times during our meal, and recommended the chicken and shrimp in hot pepper sauce to me, which I really enjoyed. My husband got the Orange chicken and his was very tasty as well. My son was sharing between the two of us and the nice man brought him a free egg roll and side of rice like what came with our dishes. Really a nice and thoughtful touch. I had egg drop soup, which was good but hubs and my kiddo both got wonton soup, which was so so tasty. Really yummy clear broth with one wonton, which is pretty standard in my opinion of a lunch sized soup. Prices are maybe $1-$2 more per plate then in Austin but I completely understand the price point. The food arrived very hot and very fresh. Right next door there is a liquor store, and an interesting note is that right now they are byob! I would not hesitate for a second to grab a bottle of wine or a sixer and head over for a tasty meal.

Seriously? If I lived where he did, I'd have not only ate the entire menu by this point, but I'd have the belly to prove it.\\n\\nSUAE expanded to a breakfast menu with homemade English muffins and biscuits. Now that's what I want to see...the word \\"homemade.\\" Yet, with a ravenous abyss for a stomach, the sandwiches always seem to gain the upper hand when ordering.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the Broad St. Bomber when this was a food cart, and it also got rave reviews from my friend. For me, I got the roast pork sandwich ($8.50). Had to channel a bit of Adam Richman here, since he loves DiNic's roast pork in Philly so much.\\n\\nAt SUAE, the roast pork hoagie has extra-thin slices of Carlton Farms roast pork, house-roasted peppers, kale, rapini, provolone, asiago, and parm. The bread used here is toasted up and the sandwich is served with a small container of their roast pork gravy/broth. Did I mention that you get a good half-pound of pork? Protein! I'd have to believe John lets the roast pork cool before slicing it paper-thin; otherwise, it'd fall apart. The slices would then be re-heated in that pork broth. I'm a big fan of peppers, kale, and rapini. All great for your health! John melts the cheese right on the roll, and it acts as a glue to hold everything in place.\\n\\nSUAE gets their bread fresh six days a week (not Mondays) from Pearl Bakery. Especially when toasted, it's one of the best breads I've ever had. Crunchy outside, soft inside. It's well worth the $8.50 you spend.\\n\\nAnd damn, they do breakfast sandwiches now, too. Each are $6. On English muffins or herb biscuits (all house-made). I'm looking forward to trying those. Butternut squash, egg, and maple sausage sounds interesting and awesome.\\n\\nI held off on elite status here last time because I wanted to try the other sandwiches.

I live nearby and eat there quite frequently. My rating in this review reflects the service and communication of the staff at VN during my most recent visit ~9:50PM on Friday July 20th with my family who had just arrived into Atlanta for the weekend. Knowing that VN closes at 10PM and keeping in mind that they make a pizza in like 3 minutes, I figured this would not be a problem. I lined up, waiting patiently to order. When I was finally the next person to order, a lady behind the counter (not the person taking the orders, mind you) starting shouting \\"finito\\" at me. I was just perplexed because I had been waiting in line and no one had said anything about the place shutting down a few minutes ahead of the 10PM mark. I asked the lady what time they close and all she could tell me was \\"well we're closed...the kitchen has shut down.\\" I understand that kitchens have their shut down procedures and they can't keep taking orders but the staff could have handled this much better: 1) Tell customers before they line up that the kitchen has closed so they don't find out when it's their turn to order after having waited. 2) If you've made a customer wait in line, then at least take their order and give them their pizza to go. 3) Don't yell at a customer from across the kitchen...talk politely. 4) If your hours state a 10PM closing time and it's Friday night, be a bit smart and take orders until 10PM.

Why posted hours? Why not just say 11:30 am to -whenever our staff doenst think its worth their time to be here anymore?  I was getting the bums-rush through my dinner, and a *sigh* when my guest ordered another drink from the bar they were already closing up. If you have your hours posted, dont get annoyed when your customers actually believes you, and has  an expectation that those are really your hours.  Having said that  my burger was good, but the food is still all overpriced for what it really is. The staff needs some attitude adjustments, but  that comes from the top down.

We started with the escargot to share which was excellent as always.  Husband went on to order the fish soup and I the rib eye special.  Both entrees came out barely luke warm, my medium rare steak was well done but the major problem was how salty everything was.  I like food on the salty side but this was just inedible.

We thought maybe they had a big party coming but that was never the case. So they sat us in the middle of the small room where the servers had to squeeze to get behind us and the entire time we were there multiple tables stayed opened. I guess I should note perhaps this annoyed us the most bc we sat for an hour and a half waiting for our food while everyone else who seemed to walk in after us got served and we kept having to scrunch into our table to let the waiter get by. We thought maybe bc my boyfriend ordered the shakshuka it took longer, but after 50 min we heard the chef say she was just starting our order. We were in no rush but as I said before it took and hour and a half to get our food and when it did my order came out wrong and cold. My boyfriend shakshuka was delicious but the mushroom tartine that came out was missing half the ingredients and the wrong side. They added an egg to the tartine that was over cooked and that I didn't ask for, I thought maybe they ran out of the other ingredients and just added it! We're pretty laid back people and I guess I should have said something while we were there, but we were starving and we're not in a rush. Then I get the check and THEY CHARGE ME $2 for the egg I didn't ask for! There was no apology for the wait or the incorrect order and cold coffee and our bill was $45.

But everybody on here saying this is the best Mac and cheese they've ever yad, I feel sorry for, because the Mac and cheese is not good. If you know anything at all about GOOD Mac and cheese then you know Gus's isn't good Mac and cheese. The chocolate chess pie is good, the coconut chess pie is better. Overall, the food is grossly overpriced because the portions are SMALL. Because I'd already read reviews that mentioned small portions, I ordered a medium Mac and cheese, it was barely 1/4 cup. Four people ate, between us we had 8 wings, 2 breasts, 2 sides each, 2 pieces of pie, 4 glasses of water and 2 12 oz beers - and our total, before tip, was $70. Again, I can't mention enough how very small the sides portions be are - SO SMALL. We could have just gone another block up and eaten dinner at Vintage Pizza, doubled our beers, and had pizza and salad leftovers  to take home and eat again, tipped our waiter big, and still been under $70.

I've been to Cha Yen several times since this past summer, and I have never been disappointed. The flavors of the meats and vegetables come through nicely and are complemented by the sauces, not overwhelmed by them. The galangal soup is a great start, a good combination of sweet, smooth, and tangy. The grilled shrimp were cooked perfectly, not dry or rubbery... same with the grilled calamari. The Pad Kee Mao is my favorite of the noodle dishes I've tried. I have recommended this restaurant to many friends and brought a few to eat with me (just one table!).

We shared the Jerusalem Rice Dish (with Kalebone), Lentil Burger and Onion Rings. Everything was prepared well and with care but was missing the \\"Soul\\" I expected. The Soul Restaurant has been around a long time, and the flavors of the Lentil Burgers and Kalebone reflect recipes that seem a little blander compared to the newer offerings available to vegetarians.

We wanted to have breakfast somewhere without it taking all day since they had places to be.  So, I hopped on Yelp to look for some nearby places with good reviews (I live in Arlington, so naturally Ball Square Cafe came up).\\n      The reviews were fantastic and it was only about 2 miles from my apartment, so we gave it a try.  Parking took us a good 10-15 minutes, and then we rounded the corner to see a reasonably long line at BSC.  As we were waiting, one of my friends went over to check out the menu at Soundbites (where there was no line, and only one occupied table outside).  Judging by the glare we got from the one waiter outside, I'd say the service over there most definitely does NOT come with a smile - but that's beside the point.\\n      A minute later, the owner/manager of BSC, Mike, came outside, introduced himself and asked us if we wanted anything to drink while we waited.  He stayed and chatted with us until a table opened up, and sat us right down.  He walked away for a minute, and came back with a huge, COMPLIMENTARY fruit bowl, all while thanking us for waiting!!  Mind you, we must have been outside for all of 10 minutes on a gorgeous summer Saturday. \\n      Three of the 4 of us had the avocado & tomato eggs benny, which I HIGHLY recommend.

'Japanese Tapas' is a strange way to put it, but for those who know Japanese food, what Shiki really is is a high-end Izakaya.

This is his only restaurant, so he is there lots of time, and that mens you can count on the quality (That is a common problem for those successful Japanese restaurants in the area, imo)\\n\\nHere is my strategy when I go to those izakaya restaurant. First plan to stay a while, like few hours. So don't go there is you are starving. It won't be fun waiting for an hour for your one thing that your ordered (See other options I gave above). I usually order few fried things and counter with same amount of non-oily things (sappari). So every Katsu, or Karaage, or Kaki Fry (fried oysters, yum), or Ebi-Mayo (drool), order seaweed salad, or sashimi, or sunomono. Get plenty of drinks ahead to go with the meal, so that you don't have to wait for it, it is worst when you run out of drinks... \\n\\nIf you are still hungry at the end, order Onigiri (rice ball) or Ochazuke.

I did what any person would do which was to take it back and kindly ask for a replacement. 60-90 seconds later I get the same tea pot with cold water added to it so now its warm diluted over brewed bitter tea. As a Moroccan tea maker myself I know that between brewing and steeping you need about 4-6 minutes. \\n\\nI can overlook long cook times. I can overlook even as a new restaurant many times they are out of key signature dishes (although I think that is starting to get out of hand now) but what that was is either the employee got offended that I didnt like the tea or didnt feel like redoing the tea, either way its unacceptable. A 5 star rating is great food and great service.  I have had over 6 pots of tea at that place (6 check ins) and its been perfect every time. The loss of a star has nothing to do with the $2.99 pot of tea, but rather how the restaurant handled an unhappy guest. \\n\\nI am giving them the benefit of the doubt by keeping their star rating at 4.

Uptown is simply a bar, you get beer, you get wine, you get a seat, and you get conversation. Simple and easy. Jared and Brian, the two guys who you will normally see here are really friendly, very knowledgeable about a drink, and always willing to have a discussion about it. They've got TVs so you won't miss your game, and if you do get a bit peckish, there's enough food places around the corner you can grab a quick bite and bring it back. \\n\\nThe beer selection is what I am most familiar with, so I will limit my comments to that.  The beer selection is about as fine as you're going to find anywhere, and almost on par with Redlight Redlight, down the street. (Which is arguably the measuring stick for beer selection in Orlando) You have a large selection of various styles of beer, and they update with seasonal beers on draft. Still one of the only places I've found that has ever carried Bombadier on tap. So rare to find here in the States. If you want a quick drink before heading out, or want to sit and knock back a few good and unique brews, this is a good place for it."},{"name":"Fellini's Pizza","address":"4429 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We have been going to Fellini's for years for the house salad and a slice of pizza at all hours.

Four stars?  Three stars?  Four stars?  Really 3-1/2 stars, but Yelp is limiting my options.  Damn you, Yelp!  Guess I'll round up because this place has some personality, and we can all use a little more of that in our dining establishments.\\n\\nI ventured out here for the first time today with some friends who live in this 'hood.  Despite its location in a very unpromising-looking strip mall, the interior of Cafe Java is surprisingly appealing - kind of \\"classic diner meets kokopelli meets off-the-beaten-path modern artist.\\"  I smiled nostalgically when I saw the coffee mug stains on the menu, then laughed when I realized that they were FAKE.  Yes, really - they are actually printed on the menus.  OK, so maybe Cafe Java isn't entirely authentic, but it is at least reminiscent of this place I favored for \\"mornings after\\" during my college days in Ann Arbor, a cozy diner dive that my friends and I affectionately called, simply, \\"Food.\\"  \\n\\nThe huge breakfast plates gracing the tables in front of so many people also brought back memories of my college hangout.  All the big, almost platter-sized dishes covered in eggs, hash browns, bacon, and pancakes had my mouth watering.  Unfortunately, I didn't spot these before I ordered, so I ended up with a swiss mushroom burger + a side of avocado, instead.  It ended up being pretty decent; flavorful and juicy, although the patty was a bit thin.  It came with my choice of sides (Sun chips, Ruffles, cottage cheese w/mandarin oranges, steamed veggies [M-F only, which I thought was a little weird], and I think there were a couple of others that I can't remember right now). \\n\\nDue to a severe lack of sleep from the night before, I also indulged in a big mug of chai.  Tasted all right, but sadly lacking in the richness I seek in a mug of chai.  Why's it so hard to find a good mug of chai in this town?\\n\\nOther notes:  we had a group of seven at 1 pm on a Saturday, and we didn't have to wait at all for a table (there did appear to be a short wait later, but nothing like you might find at one of the more central breakfast locations like Kerbey Lane or Magnolia).  Prices seem slightly high given the quality of the food - my burger + Sun chips + side of avocado was around $8, I think; the special of the day (2 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 2 banana pancakes) was $7.  I could get the same burger for less at Phil's Ice House - and those come with their signature mix of sweet potato & reguiar fries.\\n\\nThere weren't any prices marked on the tab we received, but the woman running the register separated out each group's total and ran three different credit card transactions without batting an eyelash or complaining.  Always nice.\\n\\nBottom line:  I wouldn't make a special trip to go here, but if I were in the neighborhood, I wouldn't hesitate to give Cafe Java another try.  Next time, I'll probably steer myself in the direction of Memory Lane with one of the breakfast plates."},{"name":"Curry and Kabab","address":"7500 Scott Road, suite 117","city":"Surrey","stars":"4.5","text":"Absolutely bang on.

Two of us shared the calamari as an appetizer and it was the best calamari I've ever had. Most places over-bread to the point where it's more fried breading than actual fish, but this calamari had a very light, crispy breading covering tender squid rings that came with a very flavorful red sauce for dipping. But be warned: the dinner meals are BIG, so I would not suggest ordering an appetizer for just two people unless you are both bottomless pits. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we were sad we couldn't finish our amazing food!

The NY deli that was in the same strip has closed, and it was a great place for lunch.  It is so close to my office and it's hard to drive by, but I do now and here is why.\\n1: A bit pricey for what you get.  Other restaurants near by that offer similar items are much cheaper.  The Tuscany sandwich is really good, but usually lacking on the amount of meat and a few dollars more than the other 2 places around the area that offer a similar sandwich.  Yeah, Proscuitto isn't cheap...but really folks!\\n2.  Quality varies.  The first time I had the Tomato soup I was in love, the second time it was edible at best and totally lacking flavor.  Sometimes your sandwich has a decent amount of meat on it, sometimes half the bread will be lacking meat all together. It's a crap shoot!\\n3.  The service and wait times are horrible.

When I told him I had been waiting 30 minutes for a to go order I called in he questioned me.  The girl running the cashier assured him I had, he didn't apologize to me at all.

I understand that they're bowing to the truth that \\"tapas\\" has meaning for people and \\"izakaya\\" does not, although I think \\"small plates\\" has caught on enough that it would work nearly as well as tapas.  But I digress, as usual.  \\n\\nShiki is a lovely, congenial place to get together with a friend or two and nibble on small eats while you talk about life, the universe and everything.  The atmosphere makes the place: decor that is tasteful without being intimidating, lighting that is subdued without making you feel that you're groping in the dark, tables spaced so as to be congenial without being intrusive.  It's just a nice place to spend time.\\n\\nThe food ain't no slouch, either.  If your experience with Japanese food is limited to the basic tempura-teriyaki-and-a-little-sushi, you'll find a few items that are familiar to you; however, the large majority of menu items draw from the larger variety of Japanese cuisine that you won't be seeing at the Benihana.  I had the hamachikama, which, in addition to being a useful \\"can these guys do something other than chicken katsu\\" test, happens to be one of my favorite things in the whole wide world to eat.  The Shiki rendition of hamachikama passed my test with flying colors, and dinner companion and I were off to the races.  The evening's small plates included companion's nabeyaki udon (ok, not so small that), edamame (another good benchmark), a couple orders of nigiri, and a couple other things, still leaving some items (ochazuke, onigiri) that I've got my eye on for a future visit.\\n\\nI would not come here solely for the sushi; our nigiri were quite good, but they weren't worthy of raves, and sushi is clearly not the focus of this restaurant.

The courses were a \\"salad shooter\\", tuna tartare, chicken, and a chocolate cake which they referred to as \\"angel food\\". The restaurant was quite busy (Friday, 2:30pm) but we observed most of the other diners were utilizing their Groupons too, as the offer ends in two days.\\n\\nOK course by course:The \\"salad\\" may have \\"shot\\", but it didn't \\"hit\\". Lettuce juice, diced cucumber & tomato and a touch of feta served in a shot glass. In a word, bland. As I write (Sep 2, 2011), it is the peak of tomato season so really there's no excuse for a mediocre tomato. Yet - truly insipid here. Shame and while I'm not a conspiracy theory, I have to think \\"what a great use of trim from other food, too bad it wasn't enjoyable\\".\\n\\nSecond was the tuna tartare. I kind of liked this, but ahi is not particularly flavorful, and, alas, neither was the avgolemono sauce, which while of perfect consistency, was also lacking any real flavor, particularly the lemon which would have complemented the tuna nicely.\\n\\nChicken: this course was a chicken thigh, heavily marinated, served with orzo pasta in a green pepper. Finally... flavor! But... too much. Maybe it was that our tastebuds had gone to sleep and the chicken marinade was a rude awakening. It just wasn't balanced -- neither with the other courses, nor the other components of the dish. I would complement the sauce accompanying the orzo: \\"tomatoey\\" with a hint of sweetness. At the risk of being too hard on the dish (or is it already too late?) the pepper itself was on the crunchy side. That's a fine way to serve a pepper -- but not a baked pepper dish. Also picking nits, my wife's pepper had one collapsed wall with the goodies spilling out. \\"Who cares?\\" you might ask. If I did that while in culinary school, I'd have gotten the culinary equivalent of a nun's ruler across my knuckles. Plate need to be consistent in a Fine Dining restaurant. My wife's chicken also had a couple of blobs of fat; understandable from thigh meat but unpleasant to encounter.\\n\\nDessert: I liked it. It was a small piece of relatively ordinary chocolate cake (hard to imagine it actually being angel food, as it was fairly dense), with a lovely mousse topping and a small cookie along side. The cookie was supposed to be almond... could have fooled us.\\n\\nService: with the exception of the initial greeting and sit-down, service was pleasant and punctual. Almost to a fault. We may simply have gotten a particularly ebullient server, or perhaps she was just a little too \\"cheery\\" (\\"Oh, excellent!\\", \\"Fantastic!\\"). Smarmy. Regardless, she did a fine job; sometimes two personalities just don't hit it off.\\n\\nAmbiance: the restaurant is attractive enough (that is \\"damning with faint praise\\") but the marble tables are chipped, an inlay on the floor once painted was in need of repair. Orange globe lights overhead shouted \\"The 70s are over! Please change me!\\"\\n\\nConclusion: unlike nearby (and affiliated) Restaurant C, our Groupon introduction to \\"Nu\\" won't bring us back. We got what we paid for, more or less -- a four course lunch for $15. Had I paid the regular price of $29 I'd have been highly disappointed.\\n\\nFinal comment -- please read \\"Chris E.\\" review of 8/22/2011.

They only have them on Saturdays though, so it took us a few weeks to find the time. Came by earlier to grab a dozen.

Glad they gave me a free drink at least since it was taking so long. It gets pretty bad from there. The guys opening the oysters got them out of a wholesale bag and just shucked them on the table there. These oysters had not been cleaned in any way beforehand, and all they did was dip each one into a bin of water. So, you can imagine how muddy that water was after a while. I didn't realize it at the time since it was dark, but when I got home, the two containers they gave me the oysters in were literally full of muddy water.\\n\\nWe ended up rinsing them thoroughly in our sink and putting them on ice, which they somehow also didn't provide on a to-go order. That's when we noticed a LIVE WORM crawling around the empty container. Turns out oyster worms are actually pretty common in oysters that have not been cleaned IN ANY WAY, so they should probably think about cleaning them under running water at least. The oysters tasted fresh enough for 75 cents a piece though, but obviously, if you've ever been to city known for seafood, you've had much better.

I admire how everything seemed to be from scratch. That said, it needs a little more spice.\\n\\nI ordered the corned beef hash and eggs, and was impressed that, true to the waitress's word, it was clearly homemade, rather than the nasty canned stuff so many other places will try to serve. Full of good-sized shreds of corned beef and cubes of potato, it looked inviting. The potatoes had absorbed just the right amount of grease, and the meat was tender and hearty. Unfortunately, it really needed more salt and onions. While they offered Cholula and Tabasco as options for spicing it up, I would have really preferred that it have been spiced in its marinade. Just dousing hash in hot sauce is a good way to get some bites that taste like nothing but sauce and some that are just as bland as before the sauce came to the table.\\n\\nThe eggs I received were overcooked. While part of this I can blame on an error by my server (the receipt said that I'd ordered fried over hard, when in reality, I'd asked for mine poached medium), they weren't even very good for eggs over hard. I like a fried-hard egg sometimes, but these weren't just well-cooked, but dried out. While I didn't taste my friend's huevos rancheros, I noticed that his eggs (ordered over easy) looked to be more over medium. So perhaps the moral of the story is that one should order eggs at Sckavone's a little less cooked than what one would normally get.\\n\\nSckavone's setup lends itself to many social scenarios. It's got a bar-like counter, booths, outdoor picnic tables, and tables of varying size inside. You can order breakfast, lunch, dinner, or drinks. The dining room feels like something in between a diner, a soda fountain, and a bar. While such versatility can easily lead to a place being spread too thin, I get the sense that Sckavone's has been around long enough to handle all of the above with sincere good effort. Even if that effort needs a little more spice a little less cooking-time, I still admire it.\\n\\nIf I come here again, I'll definitely go for something with more onions, peppers, and heat to it. I can tell that Sckavone's puts care into their cooking, but that alone can't overcome blandness. Expect another review sometime soon--I imagine that if I order a different dish, I may find something more representative of the place's thoughtful attitude toward their food and customers."},{"name":"Nu","address":"1661 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I can only think that we must have hit Nu on a weaker-than Sunday morning Brunch day, because I was non-plussed about the meal.

Martinis and wine selection were good. Our salad was good - beets and goat cheese. After our stroll, grounds were nice enough, returning we sat and waited beyond the ten minutes through the bottle of wine and when dinner came it was served on a warm plate, but one entree - the duck looked too rare. The rabbit was unmemorable as I ate it while while my wife waited for the head staff to offer suggestion for meal correction. She declined any further food. We waited and were presented with three complimentary desserts as well as the complementary uneaten duck. Duck looked nothing like the description or restaurant photo.

Even after meticulous comparison, it is impossible to decipher which one applies to your gender. \\n\\nOk fine, you play Japanese Roulette and enter one at random. You've made it to the seat, and you feel like a champ. With great sighs of relief you examine your surroundings. At eye level everything seems up to snuff. Nothing fancy, but this is a family establishment in Natick, you can't be too choosy. But then your eyes wander up and OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT?!? Several ceiling tiles above your head are M.I.A. and the insulation behind them is herniating out, threatening to explode all over your face. Viewer discretion advised, graphic images attached. Thankfully with the crap successfully scared out of you, you wipe and run. Finally you're back at your table for some sushi, that same sushi you've been looking forward to all week. But now the spark is gone, the magic is lost, and your mind wanders back to that bathroom with the dark strange secrets growing within. \\n\\nI recommend eating your sushi with soy sauce."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely loved this place. We went with a large group (10 of us) during the F1 race weekend. The \\"beer hall\\" format of the place makes it a fun, lively, and approachable place for a big group (though it would work really well for smaller groups as well). We were there for a rainy night, so didn't get a chance to enjoy the patio... Next time. :-)\\n\\nAs for the \\"bangers\\", there's a lot of great stuff on the menu. We each had something different, and no one was disappointed. Some of the items on the menu are fairly uninspired (maybe for the less adventurous?), but others are unique and really flavorful. I tried the duck with fig confit (matched to a nice Belgian White) and was super happy. There's also great sides to share; we loved the Poutin and Chili Fries! The beer selection in this place is amazing, and that only would make the trip worthwhile. They have everything from the usual microbrews, to the best european beers, to some great local favorites. \\n\\nTopping it all off, the service is also impeccable; our wait staff helped us find great beers to match our individual tastes and had great food recommendations too. The only slight (very slight) mark against them was when the check came they automatically put on a 20% service charge. Our waitress earned it, but it was slightly off-putting to see something higher than the customary 18%. We probably would've put in the larger amount, so it thankfully wasn't a big deal for us. \\n\\nWe'll certainly be back to Banger's."},{"name":"Cambridgeside Galleria Parking Garage","address":"100 Cambridgeside Pl","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I'm not gonna lie, I park here when I'm going to a Celtics game.

I rated five stars because I loved the food and had a good time, but I still think they could make a few improvements.\\n\\nWe showed up on time for our 7:30 reservation. The restaurant and bar were completely full on a rainy Tuesday night. There isn't anywhere to wait for your table, really, so we stood at the entrance and pondered the drink menu while the hostess checked on our table.  We were seated a few minutes later and our server came by right away (although the small space is so packed with diners, he didn't have anywhere to stand that was visible to both me and my date -- I had to crane my neck and look behind me to talk to him). \\n\\nOur server was quite knowledgeable about the food and drink menu, and was good enough to check with the kitchen about my food allergies to make sure there would be no problems with my order. He gave us the all-clear (although he did mention that sometimes their fryer oil is not changed for a few days, and that lots of dishes are fried in that oil -- meaning that if we'd come on a different night, I would have had to avoid anything fried for fear of my throat closing up). \\n\\nThe server brought us two small slices of bread and some butter. This minimalist take on the bread basket seemed kind of funny to me, but the bread was delicious. \\"Don't fill up on bread,\\" I joked. I could have eaten an entire loaf, but was happy with this little taste.  For an appetizer, we ordered arancini to share. These little rice balls were just amazing. They achieved a certain lightness with a deep-fried ball of carbs, which surprised me. The citrus and fennel pollen really brightened the flavor, and the texture wasn't too dense.\\n\\nI ordered the pan-fried pork chop with fingerling sweet potatoes, kale, and apple salad. Dear god, that pork chop was delicious. The breading was crunchy and substantial. The balance of sweet potatoes, bitter kale, and crunchy apple slaw with tart vinaigrette on the side was also very nice. A wonderful dish for fall. I paired it with the Widmer Cherry Oak Doppelbock, which is a hell of a beer. I was initially concerned about the cherry flavor, but it's understated and blends nicely into the dark, toasty malts. I probably didn't need the full 22 oz. bottle, but I enjoyed it.\\n\\nMy date had the moussaka, which he said was good although not \\"transcendent.\\" He loved the accompanying side salad with feta dressing, though, describing it as \\"the best thing I've tasted in months.\\"\\n\\nNone of the desserts particularly caught our eye, so we skipped that course.  \\n\\nOverall, I had a very pleasant evening. The restaurant was pretty loud when we first arrived, making it hard to hear our server (and occasionally our dining partners), but as people began to trickle out the space felt cozier. If you can dine at an off-peak time, I'd recommend doing so. The food was excellent, and the staff were good about giving a fine dining experience that doesn't feel too stuffy (in some snooty restaurants I get a sense that I don't really belong there... not so at Cakes and Ale).

We were greeted by our server, who was a very pleasant young woman named Alex. She offered to bring our pup a water bowl before we even had to ask, which is always an easy way to win me over. When it came time to order a drink, she could sense our indecisiveness and asked us all the right questions to figure out what she could recommend. And even when she thought she knew what we'd like, she still insisted on bringing us samples first. She wanted to be sure we liked whatever beer we committed to. And when our first beers were drying up, she brought us samples of what she thought we might enjoy next. I think that's pretty standard of TFS waitstaff, and so I just wanted to touch on it because it's such an awesome practice. As for the food, I've never had anything I haven't liked.

Chef/Owner Manita Bunnagitkarn conjured me Suhkothai noodles with an ethereal soft egg and the Thai kitchen sink including premium fish cake, fish ball, peanuts, par-boiled green beans, bean sprouts, scallion, cilantro, dry roasted chili and a little pile of sugar. In Northern Thailand you might find additionally pork rinds, liver and intestines as well as sawtooth coriander, lost on the tummies of Farangia and not missed on this occasion.

Now before I say fresh one more time I'll end this review and tip my hat to hot lips for many years of affordable slices for all the starving artists, college students, skaters, and general young brokeys.

Nice and airy with great flavor, not too hard or crunchy. They have different herb combos for the Focaccia bread as well that I cannot wait to try out when I come back. We also ordered a build your own pizza, 14\\" that was more than enough for two people, and could have easily fed three. The pizza crust was not too thin and not to thick, that \\"Just right\\" kind of crust that holds up to toppings but isn't too bready. The bacon they used on our pizza was quality, real stuff that ended up nicely cripsy not the processed bacon bit stuff you get from other places which was great too. \\n\\nAviator Pizza's food was delicious, the decor is very cool and clean, the restaurant itself is spacious and would be a great place for big groups as the seating style is communal (big tables with benches). I do want to highlight the outstanding customer service at this restaurant- our food was made and delivered within 15 minutes, we were checked on two or three times to see if we needed anything (boxes, more parm/pepper, etc) and at the check out, my BF asked if they gave a military discount, and the cashier kind enough to say \\"no, but we should\\" and graciously gave him a small discount with a smile.

Love the food, love the places, very appreciative of Liz's involvement and support of the community so spare me your need to \\"defend\\" Grass Skirt or Liz, I get it.\\n\\nMy experience was that the menu was just not well executed. It's on the smaller side so you'd think would be easier to nail down, right? It seems like more effort went into theming and generating buzz than food quality.\\n\\nI got the Thai soup, the flavors were delicious but it was served in a small, bamboo bowl that in NO way held heat. Kitschy and on theme? Yes. A good choice for serving hot soup? Absolutely not. My veg spring rolls were greasy and all cabbage. They gave us a sample of the spicy peanut pasta and unanimously we agreed - mediocre. The pasta was too starchy, needed more sauce, the dish needed color like fresh veg and it was served in the same bowl - so it was barely warm. I'd suggest using the bamboo for chargers or cold items and get something more functional for hot stuff.\\n\\nMy party ordered a variety of things and we all felt it was 50/50. The Hawaiian burger sliders and lettuce wraps were good. The cocktail was good but more like a shot in a rocks glass with lots of ice. The soup was cold, the spam sliders were skimpy on the spam (its spam, at least cover the whole bun), the Loco Moco was just OK and there needs to be a few more menu items.  The deal breaker for me was the ventilation or air quality. It reeked of fried food and the flat top. When I left, my clothes and hair smelled like I was working the line in the kitchen. I will gladly put up with that for good food.\\n\\nI hope Grass Skirt does well. I hope they work on execution and focus on the food. I want this place to succeed, for the sake of the area and to hold its own against others. I will definitely give it another shot and hope for better!

The menu is generally modern takes on old style comfort food. Wisely, I ordered two appetizers  and a glass of wine. Crab fritters, lightly fried, with citrus dipping sauce and a bowl of crispy cauliflower with hazelnuts and cheese, drizzled with herbs and balsamic. Both were perfectly prepared.

On Saturday, I didn't actually order anything, but munched on what everybody else ordered.  I tried the queso, salsa, and guacamole with chips.  Queso was excellent and the chips were greasy and crisp, so they were delicious too.  Someone ordered the chicken nachos, which could have had the toppings more spread out in my opinion.  Since I was feeding off others' food, I didn't actually get any toppings except cheese.  I also tried a hot wing... ehhh, see Wild Wing Cafe if you want some good wings.

Horrible, slow service and terrible food.\\n\\nWe come with a group of 9 hungry folks and pretty much know exactly what we want as soon as we arrive. We wait about 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us and take our drink orders, so we go ahead and order a couple bowls of queso and an order of guacamole to get us started along with our drinks. We are hungry. The queso, guac, chips and salsa come out quickly and are delivered by someone who isn't our waitress. Then, we don't see our waitress for more than 15 minutes. Everyone is out of water/tea, and we have eaten all the chips but the queso bowls are still pretty full. The waitress magically appears after 15 minutes, but not to take our dinner orders. We ask for more chips and salsa, but we don't get any. By this time, the queso is cold, there are no chips, and we haven't even placed our dinner order. \\n\\nSo we've been at the restaurant for more than 30 minutes now, and she decides maybe it's time to take our dinner order. The ordering process goes fine, but they don't offer a spicy version of the vegetarian chili. I ask if she could do anything to make it spicier, and she says no. I asked for chopped serrano peppers on the side, and she said she could do that (no idea why that wasn't an option she presented when I requested for additional spiciness, but whatever.) The food took a while, but I took that as a sign that all the chili isn't just sitting pre-prepared in the back, so that didn't bother me. At this point, we've asked for more chips 3 times and more salsa four times, but still haven't received any. \\n\\nWe finally get more chips (no salsa still,) right before our food arrives. No serrano peppers come with my chili, but I remind her and she eventually brings them out. I'm poking around and taking bites of my \\"chili\\" when I notice that there's macaroni in my chili. \\"Okay, maybe they add macaroni in chili,\\" I think to myself. As I keep digging, I notice that at least 50% of the bowl is filled with macaroni, so I ask the waitress, \\"Why is there so much macaroni in my chili?\\" She responds, \\"Why IS there macaroni in there? I'll go check to see if i entered it in wrong...\\" Then, probably another 10-15 minutes later, she returns to tell me that \\"I entered it in correctly, but they just went crazy with the macaroni back there.\\" Um, what? Why would they go crazy with macaroni and fill my chili bowl with it? Needless to say, I am not too thrilled. I could have gone home and made my own macaroni. I came here for chili. Anyway, I bite my tongue and say nice and cordial, but that's the only thing she offers me. I say whatever and just ask for more salsa because the queso is too cold/hard but maybe I can fill myself up with chips and salsa. \\n\\nAfter waiting around for her to come collect our credit cards for a while, everyone loses patience and goes to the bar to close out their tabs. The entire ordeal ends up taking about two hours, which is way too long for just a dinner. The thing that threw me over the edge was when I got charged $0.50 for serrano peppers that I didn't even get to enjoy with my meal since they came out so late. Ugh. \\n\\nI will never, ever return to Texas Chili Parlor.

The menu looked good online, so we headed that way on a somewhat early Saturday evening. \\n\\nFirst up, I feel the pain of the parking situation, It wasn't even prime time yet, but the lot was pretty full. Still, we managed to snag a space and walk in. The wait for a table for 3 was 45 minutes, not too bad. We grabbed a seat in the foyer area and enjoyed the ambiance for a while. It's upscale but not too much so, a bit loud but not overly so. \\n\\nUpon being seated (next to a beautiful stone fireplace), our drink order was taken and delivered within a reasonable timeframe. My house-made hefeweisen was delicious, my stepdaughter's ale was similarly good and my wife's margarita wasn't overly sweet (yay for tart margarita!). As for the food, I'll just lay it out:\\n\\nRoasted Garlic Bulbs with goat cheese and black pepper crostinis - Nicely roasted garlic, served tableside with the server \\"squeezing\\" the garlic onto the bread. The cloves were a beautiful brown, soft enough to be spreadable and went great with the crostini. A very nice dish.\\n\\nSkillet fried cornbread with goat cheese and portabello-cremini mushroom sauce - Wow. OK, let me admit up front that I have a strange fascination with cornbread that is NOT sweet and is super, almost hyper moist. The last time I had something that fit these criteria was at a long defunct place in Dallas back in 1990 or so. But, tonight was the night. This dish was served in a big bowl with the sauce in the bottom, two big but thin squares of cornbread and various sliced mushrooms on top. The cornbread had been cooked to perfection, with nice browning, and it soaked up the sauce to make an absolutely mind-numbingly good texture, and the taste was outstanding. The best appetizer I've had in years, seriously. \\n\\nBeef tenderloin with blue cheese and haystack onions with wild mushroom risotto and merlot butter sauce - OK, upfront, if there was even the slightest misstep in quality, it was the risotto on my plate. The texture came off a bit mushy, almost as if it had sat too long and absorbed too much of its liquid. Still, the taste was good, and I don't eat much rice anyway, so no harm done. The steak, on the other hand, was excellent and cooked exactly the way I ordered (medium rare). The merlot butter sauce was a great accompaniment to the meat, but it didn't need much. A very nice dish.\\n\\nLemon shrimp linguini - My wife ordered this, and I only had a taste, but she enjoyed it. The sundried tomatoes were very hearty and the sauce had a very pleasant flavor. The pasta was a perfect al dente. \\n\\nThe only other service issue (other than everything being a bit slow) was that my stepdaughter's tenderloin that was ordered medium came out about as medium rare as mine. This was rectified with the replacement being a perfect medium (well, as perfect as medium can be, but that's a topic for another time ;) ). \\n\\nAll in all, I don't see the hatin' for this place, except that I do see a lot being taken off for service and prices. I put food quality above all else, and even if it was a bit spendy (it was) and even if the service wasn't perfect (it wasn't), the food, on this visit, was outstanding, and that's why I go out to eat. This place is completely awesome."},{"name":"Gourmands Neighborhood Pub","address":"2316 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Luv this place! Great sandwiches and games in the back.

Someone had recommended the steak frites, but when we asked out waiter about it, he said it's only available in the fall. As an appetizer, he recommended the pretzel or the cheese & meat board. But we ended up ordering the beet & burrata salad to share. It was really good! I loved the nuts and mild burrata cheese with the balsamic vinaigrette. We also split an elk burger & added bacon. It was really good. The garlic fries were super yummy. My husband didn't really like the sauce that came on them, but I liked it.

Only to then go back later for a repeat session and get the polar opposite?   A big letdown?  Well that's how it went w/ Mister Tramp's.  Left a really bad and oily taste in our mouths. \\n\\nIt was UFC Fight Night, the waitress taking $ at the door was short on tact and professionalism.  Her attitude was large marge and customer service wasn't part of her repertoire.  She was such a turn off that I opted not to give them any $ and preferred to sit outside (no charge).   \\n\\nSo when you sit outside here it's like entering the abyss.  The service slows down considerably, the intervals (waitress walk thru) are about every 20+ minutes.  Finally a guy came out saying he was the manager (Ryan).  He was nice, we explained our issues, he apologized, so my friend ordered a beer.  After that he checked up on us twice and that was about it.  Then that sweet waitress came outside and literally bitched us out for not paying cover but watching UFC through the window.  WTF?!?  Everyone else is doing it, why are you singling us out?  Take a chill pill and leave us alone, please.    \\n\\nAbout 45 min goes by where no one stops at our table to see how we're doing.  Yup, 45 min.  Finally a new waiter comes over (long hair guy = LHG) and my friend is less than pleased and asks him \\"oh, are you sure you're still open?\\", at which LHG smirks and gives us a cocky-laced response.  My friend orders onion rings + a water.  15 min later, here comes the rings, but no water.  Also - I think their soups are priced quite high:  $6.99 for a bowl while you can get some sandwiches + fries (on the menu) for the same price. \\n\\nThe rings taste okay, but quite greasy, and these rings are different because they come w/ a surprise:  a pool of oil at the bottom of the basket (see pics).  Maybe the kitchen dude has previous work experience at BP (yeah, bad joke), but it was horrible.  We tell the LHG as he stares at the pool of grease and says (in the same cocky tone) \\"management will be notified\\", then gives us the bill.  And still no water to wash all the oil down.  \\n\\nMy friend Mr. Imbiss said it best:  these guys have a real stand-offish and cocky attitude towards customers.  Poor service, rude ticket girl, nice Ryan, no waitstaff for 45 min, a cocky LHG waiter, a puddle of oil w/ your rings, and no water to wash it down =  next time I'll pay extra to watch UFC somewhere else where I know I'll get quality food and customer service.\\n\\nIn Mr. Tramp's case:  cost does compromise quality."},{"name":"The North Star","address":"222 Friend St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Great place to watch a college football game (or any sporting event, I suppose).\\n\\nWe were here to watch a Mich St football game.

For one thing, very few people want to see a toddler at brunch, especially when most of those people are recovering from a Friday/Saturday night bender and the shrill cries of your children will only serve to make their brunch experience painful. Fortunately Jack Allen's was proclaimed to have a patio, and conveniently, woods nearby for bodies to be concealed if you die of embarrassment/kill someone for making snide remarks.\\n\\nJack Allen's, located in the boonies by Austin standards, was not what I was expecting to find out past Oak Hill. The interior had the warm feeling of a prized hunting lodge mixed with an old ranch house, and the previously mentioned patio was open and inviting. The staff was efficient and friendly, and the whole place felt inviting.\\n\\nBut let's discuss the food...because unless you have some creepy fixation with inanimate objects via object-sexual, you're there for the food. (that's a real thing. I know - crazy, right?)\\n\\nBear in mind this was in regards to their brunch - which consists of a very well appointed breakfast buffet filled with all manner of treats. I focused on savory dishes, as fruit and pastries are for fancy lads - and I am a MAN. So naturally my plate was piled with sausages, green chili pork, bacon, and anything else I could fit in one sweep while carrying a thirty-five pound toddler on one arm.\\n\\nMost of the items on the menu were very tasty (those that I tried). The chicken tenders and sausage in particular stand out as a double thumbs up. Other items, like the enchilada casserole, were dry and disappointing with very little flavor.\\n\\nMy biggest complaint would have to be the process. (Read: Chaos) This buffet is obviously popular, as not long after they opened the doors the place was packed. But this also created a logistical issue. There was no clear flow for the line (which began to be considerable towards the end of our visit) and people were frequently cutting in and out at odd intervals or moving against the flow of traffic. There was also very little space to maneuver, and once freed from the line with your plate(s) in hand, you were required to weave through tables full of blue haired old Texas ladies who chose that PRECISE moment to back their chair up and nearly end up with a plateful of breakfast on their overly-perfumed church blouses.\\n\\nAll in all I'd gladly go back (perhaps next time leaving the toddler at home to fend for himself), keeping an eye out for the church ladies."},{"name":"The Original Dinerant","address":"300 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The French toast is amazing.

I would have wanted a more unique and obvious beer taste with a cheesier flavor. \\n\\nOnto the beer! The beer is really where Deschutes shines, and I would definitely come back for the sampler and try more beers. Every single beer I chose was unique, different, tasty, and had obvious notes. I ordered the black butte porter, nitro obsidian stout, Davis st. Saison, granch ISA, Deschutes brewery, and Foray Belgian IPA. I really enjoyed the Foray Belgian IPA and nitro obsidian stout because the notes really shines through. The chocolate flavor of the stout and the fruity pear flavor of the IPA were so unique because it is difficult to taste notes in many beers, so I appreciated the obvious flavors.

We'd decided on Smokey Bones.\\n\\nThe wait was 45 minutes but it was a Saturday night, so they can't be faulted for that at all. The only thing that can be faulted was the server who upon recognizing a couple in the waiting area, promptly cleaned one of his tables and waited on them. This couple arrived 15 minutes after we did that was so not cool.\\n\\nWe finally get seated, I can't really comment on my server because she didn't leave a lasting impression. \\n\\nThe menu choices for me at this time were limited but I decided on the veggie burger and steamed broccoli (not a vegetarian). The burger was ridiculously good and was only enhanced in flavor with the variety of bbq sauces on the table. The broccoli wasn't steamed longer than 30 seconds but I ate it anyway. \\n\\nMy sister had the turkey burger and it was juicy and flavorful. The only thing she complained about where the slices of the avocado. She thought they could be cut thinner so it wouldn't pop out the sandwich when she took a bite.\\n\\nThe others seemed to regret their food choices. I loved my mixed drink. It was made just the way I like it, so kudos to the bartender, I'm particular about me drinks.\\n\\nWould I go to Smokey Bones again? Yeah, I would like to give them another shot.

The gyudon was wonderful -- it had lean beef and veggies and an egg over white rice. It seemed to me that the toppings were stewed together because the meat was really tender and the veggies and egg had absorbed the tasty gravy. The bowl was served with a little miso soup and salad. The 4 chicken wings were breaded and crispy and were not outstanding but they came with two really good dipping sauces (sweet soy and sweet chilli) and Japanese coleslaw.\\n\\nI will be the first to admit that I am not an expert in Japanese food but I am familiar with it.

I didn't see any jeans or t-shirts or sneakers, unless they were black jeans and expensive soft tailored fit t-shirts. Dressy meaning business casual, a simple dress and sandals, for a guy just no sneakers unless they're like really sleek and dressy (jordans don't count, lol)\\n\\nIt's very loud in there, very loud. This isn't a place to lounge solo and meet people really, you'd easily feel isolated. Its more so for dates-- be it with friends, family, or significant others. \\n\\n\\nTHE SPACE:\\nThe space is small, or maybe just cramped. Good decor and general design, but layout leaves no room for waiting, like none. The bar is small and cramped. It's also very dark in there, making the menus very hard to read, especially since they chose tiny fonts. \\n\\nTHE FOOD:\\nAs others have said, this place is sorta expensive, I guess. Our bill was about $200 + $40. So Basically unless you're being conservative expect to pay about $100 per person. Actually I think our bill was $230 or so total + tip, I forgot about the first drinks we had at the bar.\\n\\nWe ordered a nice variety:\\n\\nfor our Appetizers:\\n- Yellow Tail w/ Jalapeno\\n- Hurricane Roll\\n- Kamikaze Roll\\n\\nIn-Between:\\n- Cucumber and Seaweed Salad\\n- Unagi\\n\\nfor our Main Dish/Hot Dish:\\n- Black Cod\\n- Chilean Sea Bass\\n\\nDesserts:\\n- The chocolate ball that you hit with a mallet \\n- The chocolate lava cake with green tea ice cream. \\n\\nThe rolls were completely lackluster w/ no flavor, I had to ask for sauces to dip them in to add more flavor. The yellowtail was pretty good, and the unagi was good. \\n\\nThe best things we had: cucumber and seaweed salad, black cod, chilean sea bass, and both deserts, particularly the chocolate cake and green tea ice cream (I just wish they gave us more ice cream). I would highly suggest ordering these, the cod and bass melt in your mouth, yum!!!\\n\\nTHE DRINKS:\\n\\"Second Thought\\" (my friend had 3) it has a little soy or wasbi sauce in it. Very different tasting. I wouldn't recommend unless you just like non-sweet different type drinks as my friend does. I tried 3 drinks from their cocktail menu: I can't remember the names, but one was a grapefruit type one, the other was a sweeter one that has sparkling rose in it I think, and I had an Old Fashioned, I know the last one is random, but I got it b/c Zoey Deschenl gets them...  its such a strong drink it almost messed up my buzz. \\n\\nThis is probably where most of our cost added up. These drinks were basically $10-$15/each. That's basically $80 bucks there. So drinking water and only ordered one drink will save you a bit of time. \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE SERVICE:\\nThe hostesses were very sweet. We had two servers, one was cocky and not entirely attentive, but then we also had Hector. Hector was awesome. Hector was a great server.  The manager floats around flirting with everyone, pretty funny, but I know its his job-- he's a cool guy. The bartenders look very cool, I love a hot tatted-up guy, with well groomed hair (+ beard) in well fitting dress clothes. They are serious about what they do and don't give you a smile until they hand you the drink. \\n\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\n I'm glad I experienced the hype. The food was good, the hot dishes (cod and bass) were amazing. The cucumber and seaweed salad was amazing. The chocolate desserts were everything. We had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a table even though we had made reservations (that took 2 weeks to get btw). The service was okay, but made better by Hector. Seating isn't the best at all. You really have to be in a middle table or maybe one of the side booths to properly enjoy the atmosphere. The people are an interesting mix of cool and douche, lol. All in all I'd come back.\\n\\n\\nTIPS:\\n They have written on the menu that they don't give TO GO boxes. So you have to order what you know you can eat there. Make sure your eyes aren't bigger than your stomach!"},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Always love this place.

NOT KIDDING.\\n\\nI have been here about 7 times, so the number one thing I can say is that the sushi is consistently fresh. I'll go over some of my favorites, a few tips, and offer a few areas of improvement (very, very few).\\n\\nParking: Parking in the garage costs ~$10, however, you can get the valet ticket validated making it free (+ tip, of course!). We learned this after like the 5th time of going there. My $50 loss, your gain.\\n\\nHistory: As my favorite yelper has already gone over (Hi Daniel B!), The co-owner, Chef Ito used to work at MF Sushi in Buckhead. The restaurant was designed around his idea of a great sushi restaurant (and boy does he know great sushi). A waitress once told me that he even meticulously picked out the color of the tables. You can see Chef Ito smiling behind the open sushi bar each time you dine. \\n\\nTHE SUSHI: Amazing. All of it. Just amazing. A few of my favorites: Spicy tuna crispy rice starter, very lightly fried and the tuna is extremely flavorful. Tuna carpaccio is a fun twist on a normal carpaccio served with a raw quail egg. I highly recommend the acovado salad, as it's not something you will taste anywhere else, the avocado is cut in half and pitted--in that little hole there is the most tangy, delicious wasabi vinaigrette (not spicy--don't be scared by the wasabi!). Saki aioli (salmon and caviar) and the otoro caviar are MELT IN YOUR mouth--eat as is and don't dip in soy sauce. Trust me. I could go on forever here--you really can't go wrong with anything you order, but I suggest trying at least 1 item from each of the pages (different courses). \\n\\nDessert: We have had all of the dessert that they offer and our favorite is the bento box. A chocolate souffl√© served very warm with green tea ice cream on the side. There is a popular sphere dessert (chocolate sphere with a mallet to crack, inside is a whip cream like mixture with fresh fruit)--not our favorite to be honest, but if it interests you, they only make 12 per night so be sure to reserve during your reservation. They also do hand-brew coffee AT THE TABLE. It's a perfect pairing with dessert\\n\\nPrice: You will spend a pretty penny here (~$80/per person to feel adequately full), but if you love food, and love sushi, it will be the best money you've spent! \\n\\nA few areas of improvement: Service. My first time here I had a great server, she was enthusiastic and extremely attentive. Every other time, service was barely okay. I feel they could also add a few more exciting dessert menu items."},{"name":"Pastamore Ristorante & Market","address":"6000 Universal Blvd, Ste 700","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"Given it's location I gave this 3 stars for breakfast.

I am often loathe to send food back because of the waste factor, but I knew it would get wasted either way since I didn't plan eat it so well done, so I requested the steak be remade.  My server (Patrick) was so kind about it, and not only did it come out quickly, but a manager (Curry) brought it to me himself.  He was quite possibly the nicest and most sincere restaurant manager I have ever come across, making sure I was happy and going above and beyond to ensure that our evening was enjoyable.  Meat being overcooked is never the end of the world, and we would have been back to North By regardless of whether or not we had had exemplary service, but his caring and concerned attitude was so refreshing and appreciated.  This is a restaurant where you not only get great food and drink at a reasonable price, but you are truly treated like a valued individual, not simply a dollar sign with a picky palette.

I wasn't impressed with the taste, nor the presentation. The server was a bit snobby and came off as very condescending as well. And though I would have been fine not knowing this, my date was too gratuitous in informing me that he was spending $300 on me for our first date.

We called well ahead letting them know we were bringing a large group on a weeknight.

We ended up seated at separate tables around the restaurant which stunk since we were hoping to all spend time celebrating a big milestone together. Still not sure why they didn't stick us outside. To amend this, they covered the cost of our appetizers. Unfortunately we purchased ours before 7 so it was half-off the price to begin with, so that really wasn't that impressive.\\n\\nIf I were to return here, it would be for the beer and wine selection. Great selection, reasonably priced, and a really nice outdoor and indoor bar.

We arrived a bit late (stupid ATL traffic) for our dinner reservation, but the hostess didn't give us any flak for it. She offered us either outside or dining room seating but the weather was perfect (not too hot or stifling with a cool breeze thanks to proximity to the river) so we sat outside. \\nThe table was large and sturdy (I hate having to use wobbly furniture), however the table legs were positioned in a way that when you sat, the legs were between your thighs. Not the best or most refined posture for dinner.\\n\\nFor apps, we ordered the sweet potato soup w/ lobster and the mussels. The mussels were delicious and served with a light but flavorful coconut curry and some crusty french bread for dipping. The mussels were very well cleaned, no grittiness there! The only thing, I wish that they had put more of that broth in the bowl!\\nThe soup was my least favorite dish. The texture and flavors really threw me, I think, separately, the soup and lobster would be great, together not so much. It was basically baby food texture with lumps of lobster meat thrown in. \\n\\nOur entrees were the rabbit and the duck and beef burger. The rabbit was everything I remember delicious and well-cooked rabbit to be. I tried explaining it to SO before we arrived and the best explanation I could give was that it is heartier than chicken, with a very subtle gamey taste, like dark meat chicken with tons more flavor. \\nIt was served on a bed of bacon ravioli, which was phenom. \\nAt first glance, I was a bit disappointed because the bowl was soo huge, and my entree not nearly so. But the flavors were out of this world.\\nSO was kind enough to split his burger with me and it was delicious as well! SO was hesitant to order it bc most high end places that offers burgers is kinda a hit and miss. But this burger was perfect. It is a combo of beef and duck, so my palate was going crazy when I ate it in that you can definitely taste the beef and then something else that was crazy good but definitely not beef.\\n\\nFor desert we got the white chocolate coffee tart. It was a great way to end a delicious meal - light and not overly sweet. However, it did come with scone type cookies for those who want more texture and sweetness.\\n\\nThere is also a bar in the back near the river. The bartender was great there. You can also take your drinks and stroll around the property or lounge in the many chairs scattered around. \\n\\nThe service was just exceptional. Our waiter was attentive, but didn't hover and was actually pretty sweet, smiling tons! The hostess had asked us if we were celebrating a special occasion and that info was relayed to our server and the kitchen who drew out Happy Anniversary on our desert table. \\n\\nThe price point is not something that you'd want to just casually stop by and have  a meal, but for a laid back beautiful place to celebrate life's special occasions I definitely recommend Canoe!"},{"name":"Pad Thai Cafe","address":"1116 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"If I lived near this place, I would probably be here a lot.

The pulled pork has been disappointing lately - too strong smoke flavor, too many burnt ends, and grizzle.  When the price increased to $10.95 for a pork sandwich and a couple sides, we thought that was a high price for a small plate of BBQ at lunchtime, yet we kept going to support a local business.  We love BBQ and have eaten at hundreds of BBQ restaurants all over the country so we know good BBQ value.  This last time our pork was also cold as were the sweet potato fries.  We also asked if we could skip the four thick pieces of toast and get one single side BBQ beans (small) in it's place.  As in the past, they refused.  Even most chain restaurants are flexible enough to do a substitute that would, in this case, be at least an equal swap or even more beneficial to the restaurant.

However, it was not until last week that I had a chance to venture into the store and check it out for myself.  Having been to Formaggio Kitchen in Cambridge for cheese and several other good wine stores, I was expecting it to be something perhaps taking their best attributes and taking them a step further for the \\"spirited gourmet\\".   I have a mixed review of this new establishment.  While I found its layout and contents to be well presented, clean and in good variety, I found its staff to be far less than expected.  I found so many of them to be cold and standoffish with little to say about the product and to have a bit of an attitude that makes you not want to purchase.  One gentlemen was there to purchase cheese and was tasting and I caught the young woman waiting on him making a nasty face and mimicking him when she turned her back to him.  Very rude and the other staff members did not offer help and did not have much to say about their products.  At the time, there was a wine tasting going on and the staff member was sitting on a stool and speaking a little about the wine but did not invite people to come over and try some of their wines being displayed.  I think that if I had my choice, I would still go back to Formaggio Kitchen and make my cheese purchases and go to Kappy's and Martignetti's for great recommendations for wines... because there is no air of arrogance and they seem to be more helpful and down to earth at Formaggio Kitchen and Kappy's and Martignetti's.

Before I could finish my statement she told me not to worry about it and that she would take care of it. I then interjected with I can get my wallet from my car and I'll leave my phone here. To which she told me not to do that and that it was okay. Well I went to my car, got my wallet, paid and left her a very nice tip. \\n\\nNow on to the burger. I had the bison burger. Now I've tasted some scrumptious burgers in this city. But this was a bison one. My favorite of those up until this point was Ted's. Not anymore. This bison burger is currently tops in my book. It was seasoned very well and wasn't dry at all which is hard to cook a well done bison burger without it being dry. \\n\\nThis place had a nice vibe to it. Not loud and had pleasing decor."},{"name":"Supernova Vegan","address":"7909 SE 13th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Not usually one to leave a review unless the food and/or service is outstanding.

That should have clued me in to go elsewhere but I thought I'd brave it and eat there anyway.\\n\\nImmediately upon opening the menu, something else struck me. There was a note under the lunch specials that the price of the tuna dishes would increase by $1.00 due to the increase in the market value of tuna and the shortage of tuna.  This should have been warning #2, but I ignored it and thought, fine--it doesn't matter because I wanted udon noodles.  I ordered it and the waitress said they did not have any udon noodles in their kitchen. Hello--its a JAPANESE restaurant, udon is like a staple, isn't it? It's like going to a seafood restaurant and they say they have no more fish. What? So I ordered a rice dish with yellowtail and tuna. It tasted fine but the tuna did not look very fresh--which should have been another sign. But I ignored my instincts again.\\n\\nWithin 5 minutes of returning to my office, my stomach started gurgling and I had major stomach pains. I knew immediately that Shiki was to blame.

Bourbon used to be my liquor of choice but I've strayed the past few years. However, I love ginger beer which is what drew me in. And I'm so glad it did. Highly recommended for the bourbon lovers out there. I also had the Calexico (tanteo jalapeno, pineapple, agave nectar, aztec and chocolate bitters) which was unlike anything I've ever had.

When we entered, there was staff wrapping silverware in napkins seated in a table in front, and there seemed to be as may staff present as customers (about 12).  Later, more staff was seated in the dining area like they were kids hanging out at the mall.  This restaurant is positioning itself to appeal to customers who appreciate a higher quality of entrees.  What is needed here is mature food service professionals to usher in the customers, which is sorely absent.  There are three burgers on the menu, but no beef hamburger.  \\n\\nThe decor includes modern floor tile, fabric covered booths, large pendant lighting, and mostly ceiling to floor windows with no coverings.

We have lived in area for 23 years, That and being a retired chef, people ask me often what I recommend. This is my first review, I have had three really bad experiences with restaurants I have eaten at for years, this week. The food at China Wok used to be the best of the worst since it opened. Ordered tonight 2.10.2013 @ 6:25 pm for delivery. The food was delivered in about 40 minutes. To find all dishes are different. And found also that my diner was left out of the order, even though the person taking my order repeated it 5 times. Called back and asked if their was a new cook or owner, she said owner to find out there was a new owner. Was told things were different. \\" oh yea you can say different\\". Was told I was going to get the order comped, and the manager was going to call me......never did.  I said I just wanted my missing food as well as my wife's food made with the sauce that it used to be made with. Waited 40 minutes waiting. Then called she said \\"we are very busy, haven't started your food yet\\". She told me it was going to be another 20 min. So all together about 1 hr 45 min total. Food arrived wrong, my wife didn't eat and neither did I. I understand change, but the sauce that was served with her dish was a brown mushroom liquid not a sauce. A lot of things are different like I believe the use of a wok. All the dishes seemed steamed/and or poached. My pork was floured then steamed in a liquid, rubbery and gummy. \\n  A suggestion to the owner for a new name, China Yuck.\\n\\nAs of tonight the charges are still on my card, card can't wait to see if they do what they said they were gonna do...... I doubt it.\\n\\nUpdate: 2.14.2013. They did remove my charges for the food. Did not get the call from the mgr like promised. But the damage is already done.

And the best part is, I don't even have to cook. I was introduced to delicious Portland Ketchup for the first time here, and I've never bought from another ketchup brand since. And out of all the places I've tried in PDX, I've probably eaten here the most, and there's a good reason. \\n\\nFirst off, the decor is freakin' sweet. A retro feel, but still classy. You get little tastes of a classic diner here and there, but the modern touches and color scheme brings you back to the 21st century. \\n\\nSo far my favorite time to eat here is for brunch, with my all time favorite food item EVER being their cornmeal bacon batter waffle. Excuse me? Where has this been all of my life? How much of a genius do you have to be to think of combining the delicious taste and texture of cornmeal batter with the amazing-ness of bacon? Typically, whenever I get french toast, waffles, or pancakes, I ALWAYS need some sort of meat or protein component (and let me say that you're just lying to yourself if you don't love \\"accidentally\\" getting maple syrup on your bacon strips). Most of time, that costs extra. Like, $4+ extra for a plate of bacon. And that can get kinda costly. This waffle saves me money, which I gladly use toward their delicious cappuccino or latte. Here are a few other close second favorites:\\n\\nCreme Brulee French Toast: My first dish at The Original. Perfectly cooked and delicious. And those bread slices are HUGE. You definitely don't need any additional sides to fill you up. \\n\\nBiscuit Sandwich: This is definitely one of those \\"If I Had to Choose a Final Meal\\" plates. Very filling. I'm normally not a fan of tomatoes on my sandwich (apparently I'm an idiot and every single time, the tomato gets stuck on the roof of my mouth and I have to use my tongue to get it off but I can't and... I'll just stop rambling now), but the preserved tomato was delicious and really made the sandwich. I'm pretty sure I could eat this dish for every meal of the day. \\n\\nOne of the only complaints we have about the place is The Man complaining about the size of the orange juice. It seems to cost a pretty penny just for a small glass. Maybe I was spoiled being brought up in the Sunshine State where there are orange trees far and wide (not really). But it just seems silly to pay that much when you can just get a carton at the grocery store. \\n\\nSo far this is one of my favorite go-to places. It's not a bad walk to get to (and the walk back home prevents me from getting into a food coma from all of the delicious food).

Now it seems you get two choices when it comes to the food: overcooked or undercooked.\\n\\nThe decline started when the staff turned over about a year or so ago. The pizza crust got thicker, the sauce got watery and the cooking times never seemed right, no matter whether you got a pie or a calzone. As you can imagine, consistency has also become a problem. \\n\\nLast night, for instance, I got the tiniest calzone I'd ever had at Fellini's. It was almost half the size of Nova's calzone and a good quarter of it was just bread, no fillings. As I worked my way through the slightly undercooked hot pocket, I went from bread to mostly cheese to a huge salty clump of pepperoni at the end. And for whatever reason, this seems to be the new norm. It's like whomever makes the calzones is some toppings George Wallace who's vehemently opposed to ingredient integration. \\n\\nThe pizzas have also devolved to a point where I won't even order them anymore. Which is a shame, because I used to love running up here for a pie. The gooey cheese and tangy sauce made Fellini's the best pizza I'd found in Atlanta. Now, however, it's a distant third or fourth on my list. Mostly for all the reasons I stated above. \\n\\nOf course, Fellini's does have some good points and it's those that keep us coming back every now and then. For starters, this Fellini's has a huge covered patio. While the view consists largely of adjacent parking lots, it is nice to be able to sit outside on a pleasant night. Furthermore, Fellini's is pretty cheap, too. Typically, Nova and I can get two calzones and two soft drinks for around $15.\\n\\nTo be honest though, we really only come here now when we can't be bothered to drive more than five minutes for dinner. For us, coming to Fellini's these days is more about convenience than taste.

Even if you specifically ask for it.  Twice.\\n\\nDetails: Today I went to NXNW for lunch with two co-workers.   I ordered the house salad (greens, blue cheese, pecans, apples) with the dressing on the side.  Salad arrived - looked great but the dressing was mixed in.  I noted this to the waiter, who acknowledged that I had asked for the dressing on the side.  But then, instead of taking it back immediately, the waiter just stands there and says, \\"Well.... so... is it OK?\\"  No, it's not, but thanks for putting me on the spot and requiring me to affirmatively reject the salad rather than just taking care of the error without my having to insist and look like a whiner.  \\n\\nSo then for the next 10 minutes I sit there with no food while my co-workers guiltily eat their lunches.  Finally, new salad arrives, and I can't believe it - there is dressing mixed in the salad AGAIN.  By this time, I am starving and I don't want drag out this one-hour workday lunch by another 10 minutes, so I eat  what I can of it.  WAY too much dressing - so I only skim off the top layer of greens - the rest is drowning in dressing and inedible.

My fiance and I were tying up lose ends and we were in the area. He had been talking about it for awhile but we had eaten a late lunch already. We decided to stop in and have a few quick bites just to ck it out and decide from there.. \\n\\nNOTE: This place you probably wont get the same menu all the time, it is constantly changing. SO if you see a pic or post about something you want to try, you may not see it on the menu when you come in. \\n\\nFOOD: \\nVenison ceviche with sweet potato chips - it was ok\\nBeef Tartare - it was good. I've always wanted to try this but the onions (aka shallots) were a bit much for me\\nkale Gratin - the best thing we tried and it was a side\\n\\nSERVICE: she was polite, nice and willing to answer questions. that being said, \\nI felt judged by her. She seemed puzzled that we only ordered those 3 things. Well I didn't feel that I needed to explain myself and tell her about my day and my late lunch etc. I politely said no.......\\n\\nShe explained the plates were small and almost appetizer portion. Ok, that will be fine, we expected that, thank you. (informative as some may genuinely not have known) fine..\\n\\nOnce we were done: we were offered a dessert menu. No thanks - also not eating dessert bc I am getting married in 2 weeks... so.... (again didnt feel the need to share all my life/s details...) \\n \\nShe paused and just stared for a minute... and said \\"um..ok.. well would you like to order more foooood??!?!\\n\\nNo thanks. just the check (like we asked for). If we intended to get dessert or order more food would have done so with no problem. \\n\\nIt was honestly there was nothing else on the menu I wanted to try. The pics I had seen were not on the menu - but I didn't feel the need to tell her that.  Maybe we came on a bad night? Maybe she didn't have enough tables and needed us to order more so she could get more tips? I am not really sure. but to ask and tell me in not so many certain words that I wasn't ordering enough for her I thought was kind of odd on her part. \\n\\nWould I return? Sure I would but I would check out the menu ahead of time... hopefully they put it online so I can see what is available before I get there...:) \\n\\nAMBIANCE: LOVELY! Its a perfect spot for a date nite. Just plan on spending about $50/person and come hungry bc otherwise you might feel awkward for not ordering enough! :O lol"},{"name":"Smashburger","address":"9900 S Interstate 35, Bldg P Ste 900","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"I have been meaning to write this review for a few days. I went to Smashburger on Friday, and I realize they just opened so things may be a little rough. Southpark Meadows is huge, so if you are looking for this place, go to the area near Sam's Club. \\n\\nMy husband and I agreed we won't be back for a few reasons. \\n\\nService - We walked in and the person taking our order at the counter was great. She was cheerful and seemed to be enjoying her job. She was familiar with the menu and willing to make suggestions. After you order and sit down, there is a window where the food comes out and is delivered to your table by an employee. It wasn't very busy, so our order arrived quickly. Unfortunately, I was close to the window, facing it. Throughout my meal, I watched the employee who was standing there waiting to deliver food send text messages on his phone between every order. He was trying to be covert so that another employee walking from the back wouldn't see him, but of course that meant I was subjected to it. He was lucky that when the manager walked out  he had his phone in his pocket. But get this, the manager stood right beside him, pulled out HIS own phone, and started texting. If you can't set an example for your own employees.... Next, I watched another customer bring his food back to the window to let the employee know his order was not correct. He requested a new burger and the employee gave the information to the staff in the back. It looked like they corrected the problem quickly, but a few minutes later the customer was back again because the order STILL wasn't correct. So whatever you do, don't face the window! \\n\\nAtmosphere - When you walk in the first thing you see is the fancy menu screens. The problem is they are impossible to read. I had Lasik recently and an eye exam a few days before my trip to Smashburger verified that my vision is better than 20/20. The menu screens are hung very high on the wall. The names of the burgers are in larger bold print that is readable, but the smaller print that tells you what is on each burger is nearly impossible to read. The customer I mentioned earlier who returned his burger? The first thing he said was, \\"What was supposed to be on the classic?\\" Based on the conversation I heard, I got the feeling that if he could have read the ingredients he would have known to ask that they leave off the onions and tomatoes in the first place. Other than the flashy menu boards, the restaurant looks really sterile. Nothing on the walls, the colors aren't very interesting, and my husband (who usually doesn't notice anything) said that it looked unfinished. Maybe the art hadn't been delivered? Either way, it was more of a fast food atmosphere than a fast casual atmosphere. \\n\\nFood - We like different styles of burgers and we different frequent places like Whataburger, Mighty Fine Burgers and Five Guys. We realize that all of them are different and don't try to compare. Our burgers were just ok and the price was reasonable. We had a classic, a baja, and a kids burger and I tasted all of them. My husband and I both agreed that the classic had WAY too much of the mustard sauce and the baja burger had WAY too much of the baja sauce. It really made it difficult to taste the burger. Hopefully this is something that will be ironed out with more training and experience in the kitchen. The burger I enjoyed the most was the plain and dry cheeseburger I ordered for my five-year-old. Her fries were also very good. My husband and I split the Smash fries and I didn't care for them. They have rosemary on them and that is not a flavor I like much. If I could read the menu better I would have selected something else. My husband enjoyed them and the order was large enough to share."},{"name":"Pho 2000","address":"198 Adams St","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4","text":"I came here Saturday afternoon to have some Pho Beef 2000 and spring rolls.

In Cincinnati it's Findlay Market. In Philly it's Reading terminal. Either way this place is integral to the claim of being a city! The market celebrates diversity in options and is a hub for yuppies and hipsters alike. There is something for everyone here from macaroon to vegan food. I've driven past this place dozens of time but I finally had a chance to stop and it was worth it. There were tons of unique eateries that I'm sure I wouldn't see anywhere else. There were a few familiars but they were heavily outnumbered. There are tons of samples to try of both food and drink. There were also dessert samples. There's a seating area on the second floor which makes this place unique among its contemporaries because I've personally never seen this anywhere else. If you are I.

I know it might be premature to judge early on but this place is currently a let down. Food service is slow, waitress is still sort of in training mode and unsure about a lot of things and doesn't greet customers in a normal manner. I even see them averting customer's call by quickly looking at another direction. I'm only giving it 3 stars and not 2 because the soup noodle is reasonable, in taste and price. It is also lacking some of the food items that Richmond Aberdeen offers...siu mai rice cake - a popular HK style street food and different arrays of dried noodles - one even mixed with a cheese sauce! Delectable!! Bear in mind the aberdeen branch is only a food court stall and they offer even more choices than this full fledged restaurant.Hopefully in time they will upgrade their service, food quality and choices but for now, it's only worth a 2-3 stars rating."},{"name":"Staplehouse","address":"541 Edgewood Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Of course we had pretty high expectations after waiting months to get a reservation. We were quite excited to finally come for dinner. I can't figure out what all the hype is about. The food was not that great, the flavors were not as exciting as we expected - some were even bland. We had one of everything on the menu, so it's not like we didn't try everything! The single item that I did enjoy (which was a single bite) was the Beef Raviolo. It was ok.\\n\\nThe dishes were very small. Intricately put together. It seemed like there was more focus on making the food into art pieces than making the food delicious. And when I say very small - I mean each dish allowed for about a single bite per person (4 people in our group). At $20-36/plate, that's crazy. \\n\\nOverall, we were quite disappointed with the whole dinner. So instead of even risking more disappointment with dessert, we decided to leave and go somewhere else. A wise choice I believe - we went to Krispy Kreme and couldn't have been happier to have more than just a few bites of anything. \\n\\nI will say, the restaurant vibe was alright. We say inside and we did enjoy the service and the atmosphere. The service was very good. Everyone was very attentive to us and every person that brought a dish out to us took the time to explain every detail of the dish.\\n\\nI know the place got voted best new restaurant of 2016, right? But, what was that even based on? I don't feel like that's based on the food.... I don't recommend going to Staplehouse - I'd say, keep a few hundred dollars in your pocket and go somewhere else. Atlanta is full of top notch restaurants kicking out amazing food that won't cost you both arms and both legs. \\n\\nI give the restaurant 1 star, but, added a second because the service was great."},{"name":"Pad Thai Cafe","address":"1116 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Favorite Thai joint in Boston, hands down. (Gonna hit up S&I Thai next week, will keep this updated). Now there's 2 different menus at this place, one for Americans, and the other for Thai people. Fortunately I have friends who read thai so I ordered a few things off the secret menu\\n\\nAmerican Menu:\\n\\nPad Thai- Do I need to say more? This place is named after the dish after all. The normal version, the Tom Young version, and numerous other spin-offs of pad thai are ALL DELICIOUS. You really can't go wrong.\\n\\nCrispy Basil Chicken over rice- Pretty good but also really spicy. Ask for mild if you can't handle spice. If you want to try the chicken and don't want to commit to the whole dish, just get a pad thai/ fried rice with basil crispy chicken add-on. \\n\\nPad See You, Pad Kee Mao- Also really good. Start to notice a pattern yet? lol\\n\\nBa Mee Song Kruang - Really weird. It's like Vietnamese bun, but different. It's also pretty sweet, since they put granulated sugar on it. Worth experiencing once. \\n\\nPork Prik King - Not good. One of the few dishes that I don't like from here.\\n\\nGreen Curry anything - Also not good.\\n\\nFried Rice of any kind- Legit. Seriously, order one and see for yourself. (Best kind was the one with the fried egg on top, Indonesian style I think it was?)\\n\\nSecret Menu:(Since yelp won't allow me to type thai characters, items will be denoted by \\"Section X, item Y\\", which means if you want to try it, you should go to the pad thai cafe website, click on \\"thai menu\\", and find the name of the item that way)\\n\\nYen Ta Four(Section 2 item 10) - Sweet and Sour Pink soup, you gotta try it at least once. Like honestly, when's the last time you drank pink soup? \\n\\nSection 2 Item 9 - Beef or Pork noodle soup. The broth wasn't bad, but overall it wasn't mind blowing. \\n\\nSection 1 Item 3 - Basil and Fried Thousand Year Old Egg. This was pretty bomb. If you have no idea what 1k-yr eggs are, this is a good place to start. \\n\\n\\nPro-tip: If you really want to try the secret thai menu, just copy the name form the website and put it in google images to see if you like how they look, and then either write it down as best as you can or have it on your phone so you can show the name to the waitress when you order.

Ditto with their lasagna.\\n\\nIl Casale is moving in next door, so I'm sure the owners of Mario's aren't so thrilled. But they shouldn't be too worried, if history is any guide. In true \\"Survivor\\" fashion, Mario's outwitted and outlasted the Evil Empire Vinny T's, which was located in Vine Brook Tavern's current space. And I will be clear - Il Casale is no Vinny T's.\\n\\nIn more retailer terms, if Il Casale is the Gap (or Gap-owned premium brand Banana Republic), then Mario's would be Old Navy. Mario's value/bargain basement prices and lower end products and services simply cater to a more price conscious demographic. And if there is another economic draw down/recession - which is inevitable should one subscribe to market cycles - the silver lining is that all of us will most likely trade down to less expensive offerings. Hang in there Mario's...Outwit, Outlast, Outplay."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I would give it a 3.5 star but that's not a option.\\n\\nAsian food a little from every back ground served in small portions.\\n\\nPrice is a little high but how clean and how good the staff is I would say it balances out.\\n\\nFood was good some a little over priced..

I\\n ordered and paid for a burrito bowl with corn  (it includes some tiny green pepper pieces too), and the corn/little peppers were literally frozen (uncooked and frozen as in ice, out of the freezer). \\n\\nI went up and told them that the corn was frozen, and they, instead of acknowledging it, didn't respond until I repeated myself, then called over the manager or overseer, continued ringing people up, and the manager just told me to get back in the long line, order another bowl without the corn, and they would comp it. \\n\\n As I was telling them the food was frozen/uncooked, they still let everyone pay for and buy the frozen corn/veggie mix, and didn't stop or offer to do anything for anyone else who had just gotten to-go foods possibly with the corn. They didn't seem to care that they were serving frozen food in with the rest of the food, and hardly exchanged words with me. No one working the lines seemed to understand that I was having my bowl re-made/comped either-- seemed like very poor communication. \\n. \\nAs far as I know, there was no change to it either, though I hope they went back and cooked it? They had already sold a bunch of to-go orders. \\n It didn't seem like they believed me, they didn't test out the corn in my bowl, and I tried to explain that I didn't mean that it was cold, I meant actually frozen the whole way through. \\n\\nTheir one job is to make sure they're preparing the food right and getting it to the customers, and that does not seem to be this location's goal. I couldn't believe how little they cared and how they treated an easily correctible mistake as something that both wasn't their problem and something I could've been lying about? It makes me worried about if they're cooking their meats thoroughly/consistently. This behavior wouldn't pass in another restaurant. Weird experience-- I had spent nearly 17$ dollars to get my boyfriend a burrito and myself a bowl, and had to wait in the long line twice-- I would've at least liked to know that they weren't putting frozen food in other people's stuff and maybe won't do that again. \\n\\nNot to mention that I fully agree with the previous reviews about the inconsistent portions (my re-made burrito bowl was completely different in portions than the first one), the chicken is often mostly burnt or over-cooked gristle, and my boyfriend's burrito looked just like the picture posted of the half-sized one (and usually the burrito is just falling apart based on how it's been rolled)."},{"name":"Gio's","address":"47 Elm St","city":"Danvers","stars":"3","text":"Typical sub shop but the portions are tiny.

She was attentive and friendly and she was able to answer our questions about both the menu and the wine list.  A+ right there.  After ordering, a bread service comes around, with several bread varieties.  The spicy lavash (?) and the sourdough were both good.  \\n\\nI ordered a glass of wine and we ordered two appetizers to share - the peppercorn crusted kangaroo with mushrooms in jus and the smoked salmon over potato pancakes with goat cheese.\\n\\nThe kangaroo was AWESOME.  The sauce it was in was incredible.  My only complaint is that it wasn't exactly cooked as we wanted it - although the chef recommends a rarer meat, we opted for well done because the thought of eating Roo alive was a little unappetizing.  Per the picture, this came out somewhere between medium and medium well.  Delicious anyway.  Order this.  \\n\\nThe salmon was also good.  The salmon itself was honestly just like regular lox, but the cheese was great.  The potato \\"pancakes\\" were more like potato crisps.  It was good but it wasn't what I was expecting.\\n\\nFor the main course, our party ordered the cod with mussels, clams, mushrooms, and cannelloni beans; the swordfish special with potatoes, mussels, and guanciale; and the salmon with spinach, carrots, and spaghetti squash.\\n\\nThe cod was great.  The sauce it was in was excellent.  We all liked this one.\\n\\nThe swordfish was good, but everything about the dish was a little bland.  Still solid.\\n\\nThe salmon was great as well - the sides that came with it were both tasty.  Again, though, we had an issue with how this was cooked.   We ordered this well done and the fish was cooked unevenly.   Half was probably medium well and the other half was barely medium.  While the dish was good, the cook on it was not correct, which was disappointing.\\n\\nThe desserts were the star of the show.  We ordered the chocolate grotto with caramel and pretzel pieces and the popcorn ice cream sundae.  I just got a new job so the server had the chef write \\"congratulations\\" on one of the dishes.

Speaking of chips, the queso dip here is bomb. And, the portion is enough that you can gorge yourself on a million chips and still have some queso to drink at the end. I went for the build-your-own-bowl because I'm adventurous, but also very conceited to think that something I create would be better than anything on the menu. I mean, it was, but I'm not trying to brag or anything. My husband got an assortment of tacos and thought they were, to quote his mother, \\"super yummy\\". They looked super yummy and he scarfed them down. \\nWe also got Coronaritas that were SO GOOD. Don't ask any questions, just order one next time your there.

I highly recommend at least getting the party platter so you can get some variety. The're not kidding with the spiciness of the octopus but if you like spicy, go ahead and order that. There was a prawn dish that they advertise as award-winning and I thought it tasted good but overcooked. You can also pass on the Nayarit style ceviche, it's not the best. I was thrown off since I've actually been to Nayarit and what I had there versus here was different. My family loooved the lobster mac n cheese enough that it already ran out by the time the plate got to me, so I'll just take their word that it was amazing.

Both these hit the Sushi Tapas mark, tasty, creative raw fish served with a flair.\\n\\nI love bamboo, and you can have bamboo rice instead of white rice with the lunch special. I highly recommend it. The combos are a mix or cooked and raw vegetable and fish. There is a completely vegetarian combo as well. The lunch combos range from $10-16. The Tempura was average, the yam was my favorite, but you know I ate the shrimp first. If I wanted to eat less, I didn't because I had fasted for 20 hours before my doctor's appointment earlier, the combo would have been sufficiently enough food. The miso soup here is a standout it had tofu, bits of fish and seaweed in it. Not the brown water you get at some places. Overall a superior choice for Japanese Sushi that will require you to recalibrate your definitions of this cuisine.\\n\\n* SWPL #79: I quipped about it in talk but it was true; for a large part of lunch I was the only white person and more than half the people were Japanese.

I remember one time, I got this look, like, \\"you are the fucking vile scum of the planet Earth, and are perhaps the greatest asshole of world history. I don't want any more of your filthy money. Nothing is worth watching you degrade yourself any further.\\" And that was on beer number two. \\n\\nAfter beer number four, I slinked out the front to smoke a cig, and since the barfront is made up of two huge glass garage doors, I started doing a little jig so everyone inside could see me. The bouncer, who I hadn't noticed until that exact minute, asked, \\"how's your night going?\\" and I responded \\"it's 3:00 in the afternoon so I have to say it's going pretty well.

I opted for the pork belly BBQ sandwich and a side of kale Cesar slaw. The pork belly was really good, tender and juicy but not fatty. However the kimichi and the beet bbq sauce was too tangy for my taste. Neither really complimented the meat, actually took away from its flavor.

I told him my order, he mumbled a total, I paid, then watched him return to where he appeared from earlier, while crossing my fingers on both hands. I sat at a dirty table (not dirty with crumbs, more grimy) and took in the decor. I soon realized I was sitting in a generic cafeteria, you know, one you would find in a hospital or maybe prison. I noticed the dirt on the floor, walls and base boards as I ate. It's the type of dirt you see in your buddy's shower stall that he never cleans because he figures the water from his daily shower is actually keeping it clean. I hate to admit, but rather than enjoy any food at that point, I couldn't wait to finish and get out of there. I remember the brisket being pretty good, although unfortunately I didn't opt to eat it with the generic 99 cent brown bread they offered sitting to the side in the loaf bag.\\nI watched the employee -for lack of a better word, \\"interact\\"- with other patrons and couldn't believe how any owner would tolerate such an employee, yet alone the presentation of their establishment to carry on in such a way.

The restaurant is on a quiet street in Brookline, not the typical location for a gem like this; it's a one way street and parking is available but you have to be a parking shark to find anything on the block and it was after 9pm on a Saturday night and I still managed to park my party bus (Ford Expedition) on Green Street.\\n\\nUpon entering Osaka, we were greeted and immediately shown to our seats. Water was poured within 90 seconds and the menu's followed thereafter, this was orchestrated very well.

At least 2/3 of the both seating were full with party sizes ranging from 2 - 8 people per seating area enjoying the well light ambiance.   The waitress returned about 5 minutes later where we asked for more time which was my fault; I was observing the crowd, wait staff and the foot traffic and interaction of the staff. \\n\\nWithin a few minutes our order was placed, 5 traditional rolls and 2 specialty rolls and 2 miso soup.

The sushi arraigned in a two rows in an \\"S\\" shape with the 5th roll plated in the center in a pyramid pattern given the plate height. Excellent presentation and I am now kicking myself for not taking pictures to share. The specialty rolls, finally arrived 5-7 minutes later, which I think is a bit too long but was the rolls worth the wait - Hell ya!

I didn't like the brussel sprouts- also due to the jus, but they were overcooked. The creme brulee was fairly good, but I expected more from a French restaurant.\\n\\nMy friend had more complaints than I. She did enjoy her french onion soup. But her mushroom and gruyere cheese tarte didn't go down as well. It was quite greasy and had a kind of funky taste that she didn't think was truffle oil. She ended up sending it back. She swapped it out for the endive salad. Talk about unappetizing. When it was delivered, we were both taken aback. It was the most dull salad I have ever seen. She didn't really enjoy that either, but ate it cause she needed something more to eat and didn't want to try again.\\n\\nSo my friend is done with Bistro Niko now. I would give it another go.

After seating ourselves, we waited almost 10 minutes before receiving glasses of water from the busser. Then, with no waitstaff in sight, we had to find our own menus. A few minutes later one of the two waitresses working at Sunday lunchtime took the order of a nearby table that had arrived after us. Unable to gain her attention, we waited, thinking she'd be right back. About another 10 minutes later, we were finally able to call her attention to our table. She seemed surprised we hadn't been taken care of--she thought the other waitress picked up our table. We placed our drink and food orders, including a chips and queso appetizer. She brought our drinks and some chips and salsa, saying the queso would be right out. We waited... and waited. We reminded her again about the queso as she passed by to welcome another new table. By that time, we also needed sodas and waters refilled and requested those as well. She came back with the other tables drink orders a few minutes later... we reminded her about our empty glasses and missing queso once more, and then she disappeared again. Another table, who sat down after us, got up and left. Other tables appeared to get their orders from the other waitress, and almost an hour in, we were able to tell the second waitress we were leaving.

I'd prob call it something like, \\"modern with a twist\\". There were lots of booths, a wraparound bar, and a tight waiting area. For the size of the restaurant, I thought that both the bar and the waiting area were disproportionate.  Note - that this restaurant is mostly open, so it wasn't designed for silence. Au contraire, it was way too noisy. The open design for the size of the restaurant plus the amount of people causes the noise to become over-amplified.\\n\\nWe were seated comfortably at a corner booth.

To make this recipe at home do the following: Douse spinach in mayonaisse, throw in some walnuts and cranberries, mix thoroughly (so that the mayo is coating everything) then proceed to stuff part of the salad into a lukewarm under-cooked squash. Throw some cold crab on top and serve. \\n\\nStrawberry Bibb Salad, surprisingly not as poorly thought out as the other dishes, an OK dish. however the mixture of heavily smoked uncooked bacon with strawberries is lacking, two people in the party ordered the salad and neither ate the bacon. To clarify, the bacon is heavily smoked (essentially cooked) and is safe to eat, but raw smoked fat has a very unpleasant texture. I am a fervent carnivore and had trouble eating it. \\n\\nHouse Pickle, I ordered this in the hopes that there would be some sort of rhyme or reason to the pickle choices, which was true! But there was no culinary reason whatsoever, it was squash themed because of halloween. Pickled Pumpkin, Acorn Squash and Spaghetti Squash. The pumpkin had a texture similar to very under rip honeydew, with an underwhelming pumpkiny-vinegar aftertaste. The Acorn squash was an abomination and should have been tossed after the experiment first failed, it should never have been put on a menu, simply gross in flavor and texture. The only saving grace on this dish was the Spaghetti Squash which was nicely acidic and decent tasting. \\n\\nQuail and Waffles, a safe bet if you'd actually like to leave the restaurant and not be hungry. I didn't try this dish but from appearance - the quail was oily and poorly breaded, with the breading separating off of the meat with little to no effort, the waffle looked slightly burnt not very appetizing. I was offered to try this dish but refused based on appearance alone. \\n\\nMac & Cheese, this dish really upset me from the get-go, it sounds appealing from the title! Mac & Cheese with Bacon and Truffle? Sign me up! Wait, what? It's *not* truffle you say? It's white truffle oil? Why does it simply say \\"Truffle\\" on the menu? (Yes, for $13 you should not be expecting truffle, but the menu should also NOT simply state \\"truffle\\") For those who don't know what white truffle oil is: White truffle oil is a fragrance created in a lab, it's a mixture of chemicals and olive oil and contains absolutely *NO* truffle whatsoever. It's difficult to digest, smells foul and tastes even worse. It should never be put on food under any circumstances. A good rule of thumb if you're ever in a restaurant and see it on a menu is to leave immediately (sorry hopdoddy, nix it and I'll be back.) \\n\\nTo summarize my review, the food is gross, the restaurant is unethical (menu is lying) and if you intend to go here you should avoid anything made in house.

Again- if you are charging 15 dollars for a polenta plate- even a small one- the polenta itself needs to be well seasoned and more than two tablespoonsful. Not soupy and salty. The ragout should be hot- the items should meld and the egg should be cooked so the white isn't runny. None of the food was awful. It just wasn't good. We won't be back unless just for cocktails."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Nice place, food is not as good as expected though, but still tasty."},{"name":"Southern Sweets Bakery","address":"186 Rio Cir","city":"Decatur","stars":"4.5","text":"Busy for lunch, and if you go and eat there you will see why!

The outside seating is nice, and they do have buckhuter so theres a few pluses.  I've also done trivia there a couple times and tat ranges wildly as well, one time its as if i had wandered into MENSA trivia, and the other there were actually 2 questions that the trivia emcee had the wrong answer to.

And Portland bars and restaurants -- all, as far as local food folklorists can tell, inspired by the Montage -- are equally crazy about the stuff. I should also note that I make the stuff from scratch quite frequently, and I'm pretty thrilled with my recipe. So when I find a new place to get macaroni and cheese made from scratch, I'm both eager and suspicious.\\n\\nVendetta's mac and cheese uses mostly ricotta and mozzarella. Which made for a wonderful, rich, creamy sauce that wasn't a white sauce (something too many mac and cheeses, including the Montage's, employ), but I felt it lacked a little something. Maybe another kind of cheese, or maybe even the addition of green onions on the top would have done it for me. Still, I scarfed the thing down in minutes, so I think they did something right. The side salad was pretty tasty, though they were less than generous with the dressing, which is served on the side by default. Companions ordered the sloppy joe (when was the last time you saw a sloppy joe on a menu?), which garnered a thumbs-up, and the tofu sandwich, which had to be substituted with turkey because they were out of tofu. \\n\\nIn fact, though it was a weeknight, the place was fairly busy and staff seemed a bit overwhelmed. But I liked it enough to go back, and that's a good sign that I owe the place four stars. The chic, slick, post-industrial cleaned-up-warehouse atmosphere (there was a bullethole in the window near our table) isn't for everyone, and it isn't for every night, but the food and drinks are. (There isn't a whole lot on tap, if memory serves, but what they do have is good, and the cocktails do the trick.)"},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Love the area this is in.

I said I was sitting in front of the house and nobody came here but that I saw a car parked a few houses down the street and that might have been her because my phone had died. The guy who answered the phone then said that it was my fault because my phone was dead and she called. As far as I thought delivery guys knock on the doors which if she did she would've known she was on the wrong house, second my address is on the order and if she looked at the houses they all have the numbers posted in front so if she looked she would've known she was at the wrong house. She did call, the phone was dead yeah I guess that's my fault but wow! So the guy said it was my fault and that I don't need to give him an attitude which I wasn't I was questioning what had happened. he was getting out of hand do I asked to speak to a manager at which he replied \\"I am the manager\\" so I said that what kind of service was this that instead of arguing and telling me is my fault he should be trying to remedy this and he said well I can have her go back with the order or refund you the money. I couldn't believe he was talking to a customer like that so I said that and he hung up the phone on me in the middle of my sentence. I called again and this time another guy answered so I said I was talking to the manager and he hung up on me and he said I'm the manager and I didn't hang up on anyone. So I proceeded to tell him what had happened. He was very kind and apologized, his name was Jean and although he was apprehensive about giving me the other guys name, he finally said the name was Joseph.
