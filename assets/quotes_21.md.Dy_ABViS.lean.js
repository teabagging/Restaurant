There is a bar section with sports playing on TV. The whole environment is a bit on the louder side and can get rowdy. We were brought to our tables shortly.\\n\\nIt took us some time to really figure out what we wanted because everything sounded so delicious! I decided on the Yellow Belly Burger.

Highly recommended. \\n\\nDeviled Eggs - a bit hard to find on the menu, but it was fairly inexpensive. The eggs were definitely pretty good. After I got my order, somebody else at the table decided to order one too.\\n\\nRoot Beer Braised Pork Belly - I think our table ordered a bunch of orders of this. One order comes with 2 pretzel breads so it can be split. The pork belly was super tender and juicy. Good flavour and meshes nicely with the mustard and poached egg.\\n\\nObsidian Stout Mac and Cheese - Somebody at the table got this, and I asked for a bite. I remember it being pretty delicious, but very very heavy.\\n\\nSomebody else ordered a flat bread but it wasn't memorable.

I was served a beer within seconds of approaching the bar, while my boyfriend (who ordered later) waited as the bartender served a party of a dozen people standing directly in front of him, and then was told he couldn't stand there and wouldn't be served unless he moved.

They seemed to be striving to mix modern and streamlined with rustic and comfortable but don't quite succeed.  The huge wood carvings looked like an afterthought and clashed with the recovered wood beams, and the green plaid carpet reminded me of a hotel ballroom.\\n\\nOnce we got seated, service was relatively fast and competent.  Our waitress was friendly, and as others have said, the food was okay, but overpriced.  It's basically glorified pub food, and there's better elsewhere.  The burgers (which three of our party ordered) were inconsistently cooked -- they had all been ordered medium, and when the order came, the patties ranged from brick-like to bleeding.\\n\\nA friend of mine asked one of the bartenders if they would have a happy hour in the future.

I asked for the rarest piece and he gave me the end. Totally gray and hard. They had au jus and horseradish sauce. I went back to the table and my BF had a better piece of meat than I did so he shared and I thought I'll wait- maybe that one was overcooked.  Nope. \\n\\nHere's the problem. I get buffets. I know that they have to be prepared in advance and reheated. I know catering.

When we called the restaurant to make reservations, we were told that it's not a large party and they don't take reservations. They also shared that they get busy at 630 so they recommended sending someone early to claim a table. Called multiple times and spoke to different people and they all said the same thing. But when we showed up with 3 adults at 615 we were told that they do NOT seat parties that aren't all there. A manager was called and voiced the same thing to us and refused to sit us until other guests in the waiting area started to pay attention. If your staff is telling customers incorrect info on the phone they clearly need training on your policies but you should also honor what was said. After we were seated, waiters began placing reserved tags on a table, they also set the table with 32 spots. That party arrived and was seated as they arrived. They did not wait until the full party got there. We still haven't figured out how a place that doesn't take reservations, in fact, takes reservations AND has (well used) RESERVED table signs.\\n\\n\\nThe positive: our waiter was fantastic and the food was great. I have a dairy allergy and the waiter doubled checked for me to make sure there was not dairy in what I wanted and offered substitute options for the side item that came with my dish that did include dairy.

The pot roast was tender and served with baby carrots, cipollini onions and creamy mashed potatoes served in a warm little pool of \\"pot liquor\\" jus.

Apparently he is a foodie and serious about great restaurants, and had just dined at Dai Due a few nights prior to our reservation.  The setting is tastefully done in a style that is just-rustic-enough to be trendy now but still relevant in 7 years. The menu changes regularly and is sourced from locally available ingredients.  And the protein offerings beyond the steak, chicken and pork items are REALLY exciting game (elk, venison, boar) that's hunted-and-gathered from the area. (see menu from our dinner pictured).  I'm a sucker for all exotic meats, and promptly ordered the Elk Ceviche.  It came with purple potato chips that were perfectly fried and LIGHT/CRISPY.  The elk was delicious, had an interesting texture and taste and not gamey as I expected.  The citrus marinade was delicate and balanced, and the sprinkle of jalape√±o added an occasional mild kick that was perfection.  We also ordered the beef tartare (delicious), the rib eye (cooked to perfect medium-rare temp) and the supper club special of the day, half a roast chicken with sides.  The extra side dish of charred broccoli & aged goat cheddar was the only dish that disappointed.... the cheese felt disjointed and didn't pair well with the already-hearty charred broc.  The chicken was DELISH, brined just right so the meat was seasoned and moist throughout, with a finishing glaze that made me take down every piece of available skin.  Love that they only serve TX/local beer as well.  The bonus was the butcher shop up front, where you can get venison sausages, hot dogs, ham hocks, venison steaks, etc... I treated myself to the venison dogs & sausage, some dried pig ear treats for our puppy, and a couple jars of their delish Fireman #4 mustard that made the beef tartar so tasty.

When I moved away from the area for a few years, I kept on coming when I came back to town to visit friends and family, including choosing it as the place to celebrate my birthday at a few years ago.  \\n\\nThis year I was in town with my mother the day before my birthday, and she was planning on treating me to dinner and a movie since I was hanging out with other folks on my actual birthday.  The movie that we decided to see was only playing at the Arbor, so we decided to eat at NXNW since it'd been over a year since either of us had been (we'd gone there for brunch on the day that we were shopping for decorations for my wedding last summer).\\n\\nThere were a bunch of cars at the restaurant when we got there so we were worried we wouldn't get a table right away.  But it turned out that all of those folks were there for happy hour, so the main dining room (where happy hour doesn't apply) was prettymuch deserted.  We were seated and ordered drinks.  My mom got coffee and I ordered one of their seasonal beer offerings that sounded good, a Belgian style ale, and we both got waters as well.  \\n\\nOur drinks arrived shortly.  Mine was in a glass similar to a wineglass and was therefore a smaller amount than I was expecting.  I guess maybe it had high alcohol content and that was why?  I liked the first sip of it, but after that it was way too sweet and syrupy -- much heavier than I expect for a Belgian.  So I guess it didn't matter that it was small ... I don't think I even finished it.  My mom liked her coffee okay but had a hard time getting refills from our waitress.  \\n\\nWe'd decided to get calamari as an appetizer.  I don't think I'd had it before at NXNW but I'd thought that I remembered hearing good things about it.  Well, it was not good.  The squid and batter were devoid of any taste whatsoever.  It was squishy and undercooked (the batter was pale, soft, and flaking off).  The sauces for it were okay, but I don't order calamari for the dipping sauce ....\\n\\nHoping for better luck, I decided to be safe and order my old favorite, the burger topped with a combination of blue cheese and cheddar, with a side of garlicky fries.  My mom ordered the duck, which was supposed to come with polenta, but she substituted some of their special mashed potatoes (maybe the carmelized onion ones) for that.  \\n\\nOur food took awhile to come out.  When it did, my mom liked her food well enough.  I tried the duck and it seemed okay ... I'm just not much of a fan of duck.  My hamburger was pretty bad.  It was totally greasy/oily, and had an odd lighter-fluid-ish taste to it.  The blue cheese bits were somehow overwhelmingly salty.  I ended up only eating half of it and not taking the other half home, because I could already tell that it was making me sick.  The fries were fine, though they were in a small portion and were not served hot.\\n\\nWe had been planning to share a dessert for my birthday, but decided to quit while we were ahead.  I won't be seeking this restaurant out anymore for special occasions, and I may not even come back since I'm rarely in the Arboretum area."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We went to Joy Cafe' today for brunch (Easter Sunday).

It's fairly close to where I live, so I was hoping for good results. We were seated quickly but my wife commented that the hostess was not very friendly or outgoing. Chips were delivered quickly with a side of salsa and the server took our drink order. I agree with another reviewers assessment of the salsa. It lacked personality... Pretty much tasted like tomato sauce. I asked the server if they had anything spicier. He brought the heat, and we found that a mix of both was the best combination of texture and flavor.\\n\\nI ordered a Bud Light, which came in at about 3.50, a dollar less that any of the Mexican beers. Not sure that $4.50 is a good value for those, particularly when happy hour prices only apply to the beers on tap. My wife said I should tell them how to make a good margarita. I tasted hers... It was pretty pedestrian.  She was, however, very happy to see something close to her beloved seafood chimichanga on the menu. She ordered the lobster version. I got a taste of this once it arrived. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Instead of providing two chimichangas (which means a lot of tortilla) they should stuff the same amount of lobster into a single tortilla. That would reduce the filler and put the lobster at center stage.\\n\\nThe menu, by the way, is fairly huge with lots of great pics. I had a hard time deciding, but ordered the seafood soup. This offers fish, lobster and shrimp along with a variety of vegetables. It arrived very hot and looked good. In fact, the soup base was excellent. I was very impressed and enjoying every bite. Some of the lustre wore off when I realized I had not seen any seafood yet. After digging around I found about 1 oz of fish in a couple of pieces. I found no shimp and no lobster... unless they were cleverly disguised as carrots, califlower or broccoli. My bowl had plenty of veggies. As I said, the soup was delicious, but I don't pay $16+ for vegetable soup.\\n\\nGranted, this could have been due to an unlucky scoop from the soup cauldron, but that's something the restaurant needs to fix. I told the server of the issue and asked him to pass the info to his manager. He may have, but the manager didn't come to visit and I got to pay full-pop for vegetable soup. Bottom line... The place is clean, the food has potential, and the staff is not terrible. Does that beg for a return trip?\\n\\nI doubt that we will return.

I worked in the industry for almost ten years when I was younger, and I get that there's those busy nights where someone didn't show, so things go wrong. But no one really seemed to care. Here's what happened:\\nMe and four friends arrived around 8 and it was pretty full. We got seated fairly quickly, but waited at least 15 minutes before being acknowledged. A server walked by several times, but no nod or gesture. Finally, someone came to take our drink order, but we were ready to give the whole thing. He did apologize for it being busy and said they were short staffed.He had no pencil, so he left and of course was distracted a few times before returning. We ordered everything with no modifications - mostly appetizers as meals. The drinks came out fairly quickly, but by that time, it had been almost 30 minutes. About 15 more minutes or so, an appetizer came and that person in our party dug into it, with our approval, since we all thought the rest was on the way. Meanwhile our drinks were all empty, except mine which was about 1/4 full. The deliverer disappeared quickly. So, about 20 more minutes go by, still no drinks or anything. This whole time, I see the staff working, but they had no sense of urgency, as if there were just a couple tables going or something. It was bizarre. We were getting upset and  I approached the guy at the bar who was the one that brought us menus. I explained that it had been a long time, and he seemed to know, but just kind of looked up at the ceiling. I paused, assuming he would check the status of something, but... nothing. I said \\"we are about to just walk out at this point\\" and there was really no reaction. I never would want to not leave money, so we pooled some cash together and then argued amongst ourselves about even leaving money at all. One of our party members charged the bill and we left. So weird... Just no concern or anything. Maybe our food was just two minutes away, but no one ever checked or tried to prevent our experience from failing. Maybe our table was the straw that broke the camel's back and everyone working just had it. But, I have been in the weeds before in restaurants and you kind of know that look in people's eyes; no one there did. They just seemed relaxed like they were on downers or something. \\nI had only been to R+D once before, for a drink and appetizer on an early Saturday afternoon.

I've only ever been to Sweetwater at the oddest of hours: Tuesdays at 9:30 am, Thursdays from last class 'til last call, etc. etc. And I've never been disappointed.\\n\\nI will say customers shouldn't be put off by the slow-as-a-snail service. Sometimes, it can take a light year or two to flag your server down for a refill or the check, but that's never really bothered me. (Buy a pitcher and nurse it.) The 'tenders are always friendly, even when the bar is five bodies deep. And though I'm not a huge fan of mixed drinks here, their standard selection of beer is always cold, foamy and relatively cheap. Order anything sweet and you'll probably get asked for your ID again, so stick to simple and strong.\\n\\nAs for food, this place goes above and beyond what it needs to do. The mac 'n cheese is phenomenal, and it comes with garlic bread for optimum soakage of residual cheese. Their grilled cheese is great--though greater with tomato--and comes with really good slurpable tomato soup. Nachos are served on a veritable platter in dinosaur portions, although the jury is out as to their efficacy. (I will always think Boston Beer Works makes a great nacho; sue me.) I don't think I've ever seen anyone dissatisfied with their meal. Sweetwater dishes out really solid bar food, and if you aren't going to drink, you can easily enjoy lunch or dinner. At a slow pace. And it'll be loud.\\n\\nPoints for having Big Buck Hunter. \\n\\nMo' points for having clean bathrooms, although they're located in the basement and therefore, the trek is a dangerous one.

It comes loaded with sliced onions and spring onions, the meat is tender and moist. I am now officially a fan of the roti canai with the spicy curry sauce - two come with the order. You know it was just made because it was super hot and crunchy. The sauce is spicy but compliments the roti. I wanted more but there were other tastes to try. \\nThe calamari was tasty as were the fried green beans.\\nThen we ordered a pad thai, hawker's delight (large pieces of tofu, broccoli, carrots,  peppers and mushrooms in a soy kind of sauce.), Cantonese cod and roast pork. I loved the pad thai before... I loved it again tonight. Wonderfully put together, this is a meal itself. Now if you want some fish, go to the cod.

The guy at the wok starts cooking the meats and then realizes that he's out of noodles when he's almost done. So he turns the heat down on the meat portion, leaving it to simmer for the roughly eight minutes it takes to cook the noodles. He then spends another two to five minutes washing out the pan he just used while. \\n\\nAfter that he throws everything together and it sits on the counter waiting for final packaging by the girl working the counter. Usually for another five minutes. By the time I get the food the meat is very over cooked rubbery and seems to have almost no flavor left. Only the application of soy sauce and teriyaki sauce seems to save it. \\n\\nIn short, it's a step above fast food. It's slightly healthier then fast food. It's in the same price range as fast food. It's got larger default portions then fast food. It takes longer to cook then fast food.

I chose Canoe as the place to spend my birthday. My party was fairly large and we were the last table for our server Bryan. Most times when this happens I feel as though servers are less accommodating and I get the shorter end of the stick when it comes to great service. However, Bryan made our experience absolutely memorable! For our appetizers we ordered: Calamari, Crab Cake, Smoked Salmon and the Charcuterie Plate. There wasn't a single appetizer that was short of amazing. For my entree, I enjoyed the Lamb Shank. The meat was so tender it fell off the bone beautifully. Bryan topped my experience off with the Popcorn Ice Cream Sunday. Such a perfect combination of sweet and salty! The service was absolutely 5 star!

I had ordered some take out for me and a coworker (the cheese ravioli and a think a pizza?) and it was sub par, tiny portions, average taste with a huge price tag. I did not post at this time because I figured being a new restaurant with new staff maybe they are working out the kinks so I did not write them off completely and bash them on yelp. So fast forward to tonight, I am in the mood for Italian and decide to give the take out another shot. I go ahead and order the chicken parm ($17) and a order of roasted cauliflower ($6). I show up to get my food and the people at the hostess station act like they have never gotten a takeout order before, very slow to respond with no confidence that they are going to provide me good food and service. Eventually after a good amount of time out back one of the females comes back with a small, excuse me very small bag with my order in it, having spent almost 30 dollars on food you would figure you would at least get a bag that could hold a half gallon of milk (this could not). I pay with cash and that was another 5 minuets to get my change. I walk out to my car and look in the bag, NO BREAD! What kind of self respecting Italian restaurant doesn't give you bread?!?! Its Italian, if i order bread it should come with a side of bread. I go back in get my bread, another mass confusion moment for the hostess, and im on my way again. I finally get back to my dinner table to check out whats in the bag and hopefully sit down and eat a good meal. FAR FROM IT! So you figure you see entrees on the menu it would be whatever meat they are offering with a side of pasta, pretty standard for Italian restaurants especially with the price tag. But no, it's a la cart at this place, with no mention of it on the menu. Just a little piece of chicken in a box with some sauce and cheese, thats it. 17 dollars they charged me for this BS, AND IT WASNT EVEN GOOD! The chicken was saturated with olive oil, the sauce was watery and blah, cheese is cheese no complaints there. As far as the side of cauliflower I dont know I dont eat that shit, my coworker ate it said it was nothing special. \\n\\nSO, if you want to spend a ton of money on food you could get in a high school cafeteria go to Capo. If you want to deal with sub par staff, go to Capo. If you you just need a moment of absolute dissapointment in your life for whatever reason, go to Capo. \\n\\nI turly hope this review makes you say fuck this place and you decide to go find some REAL Italian food, may I suggest the north end, why you looking for Italian in southie anyways.\\n\\nP.S.

Been here for dinner multiple times and the quality holds consistent every time.  Canoe is tucked away riverside up in Vinings and proves to be a hidden gem that Atlantans have enjoyed for years.  The ambiance of this place makes you feel like your in a nice lodge from its wooden features and open kitchen.  It's a great date spot as well as a place to have a work dinner.  There's something on the menu for everyone and the wine list is one of the best in the city.  You definitely have to make a reservation in advance because it gets very crowded on the weekend so I would recommend making it about a week in advance unless it's for a special occasion (ex. Valentines Day) in which it would probably be 2-3 weeks in advance.  They only offer valet parking as well.\\n\\nOk onto the good stuff, the food.  We went their last Friday night and tried a good amount on the menu.  The menu changes seasonally so there's always something to look forward to no matter when you go.  They get everything local as well which I always think is a plus.  Their menu is focused around game and seafood.  This time the apps were seafood heavy and the mains were more on the game side.  Good mix of both though!\\n\\nWe started off with the Kangaroo Loin and Salmon Chips.  And yes I did say Kangaroo.  While it sounds very strange, it was actually better than what I was expecting.  Tasted similar to a medium rare slice of flank steak.  Seasoned peppery atop a grit cake with bourbon collards.  Good app choice for something different that displays their specialty but I didn't like it as much as the Salmon Chips.  These chips are a signature dish of theirs that's a must!  Delicious smooth smoked salmon atop of a crispy potato cake with a layer of smooth goat cheese in between.  Well balanced flavors and textures to create a refreshingly light and delicious appetizer.\\n\\nI also ordered the marinated golden and red beet salad while our friend ordered the roasted leek and potato soup.  She said her soup was really good but my golden beet salad was the best I've had, which is saying a lot because I pretty much order it whenever I see it on the menu.  First off, it was beautifully plated making it almost too pretty to eat but the best part was the whipped goat cheese it was served atop of.  It looked like a dessert because it was plated as a cylinder with the goat cheese as the base, a layer of the red beets in the middle, and then topped with the golden beets and candied walnuts to top it off.  When you deconstructed it, the salad was actually pretty big in both size and flavor.  I can't get over the creaminess of the whipped goat cheese...it was such a unique flair on a beet salad that I will definitely order it whenever I go back.\\n\\nEntrees consisted of the pork rack and the duck for my boyfriend and I and the rabbit and halibut for our friends.  Pork chop was a generous portion size (prob. 10-12oz with the bone) platted with a squash hash and some type of creamy sauce.  Flavors were well balanced and delightful together but the pork was a little overdone in parts.  Good dish overall though!  My boyfriend couldn't say enough things about the duck and from the bite I had, I get why.  Very tasty duck dish cooked perfectly but it always has been when I order it at Canoe.  Their duck dish is probably on the top of our list of duck entr√©es anywhere.  Our friend's dishes looked very good as well but the rabbit looked pretty rich since it was served with ravioli and a cream sauce.  Not my cup of tea but he seemed to enjoy it!\\n\\nWe rounded out the meal with the Popcorn Ice Cream Sunday, the seasonal sorbet (coconut cream), and the Chocolate Grotto.  You MUST try the Popcorn Sunday because it's out of this world amazing.  Another signature of theirs but I will warn that it's so rich and sugary that it should be split. It's vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce and loads of caramel popcorn sprinkled throughout and on the plate.  We split that while our friends enjoyed the other two desserts.  The bite of the coconut sorbet that I had was just as good as the Sunday though so I want to try that the next time I'm there if they have it.\\n\\nFor drinks, I'd stick to wine.  Extensive wine list that provides options for any taste pallet and sadly the cocktails just aren't that great.  That's the only thing about this place that could use improvement but I love me a glass of wine so I'm happy either way.\\n\\nNext special occasion or night out, highly recommend Canoe because it won't disappoint!"},{"name":"Rio Grande Cantina","address":"3227 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Unfortunately I have tried this place a few times now and have been less than impressed, which stinks because I live in walking distance to it!\\n\\nThe food is your average not-so-great Mexican, but more expensive and the service is super slow (I mean doesn't it take like 2 minutes to make a chicken quesadilla?!)

Upon entrance, we decided to wait 30-45 minutes for an outside table versus barside immediately.  The wait was actually 20 minutes.  We had a great table with a wonderful view of the chattahoochee.  The server gets most of the stars here.  He was friendly, knowledgeable, and just overall great.  We ordered the crab cake app - DELICIOIUS.  Best item I had.  Waiter recommended the rabbit.  I chose that and the hubby ordered the short rib entree.  My rabbit (never having had rabbit before) was... ok.  Like rabbit.  I can see how cowboys of the western days were lean and wiry.  The rabbit leg was about 3/4 my palm over a bed of julienned veggies.  It was ok.  The meat was very nonflavorful which usually means that the accompanied gravy or veggies have a standout flavoring but that was not the case.  It tasted like unseasoned meat with a little au jus and the veggies had no real seasoning.  It was \\"eh\\".  My husbands short rib was tender and delicious.  It was very good.  They placed it over mashed potatoes.  The server recommended a pinot noir that didn't taste as smooth as some I have tasted.  It was ok.  It had a little tang aftertaste that I didn't particularly care for.  The dessert choice was based off of a nearby tables choice.  Their dessert looked very good.  So I ordered the chocolate dome and hubby ordered the apple cobbler.  Not sure what I thought the dome was filled with but I didn't like the fact that when I broke through the super hard shell that there was just a caramelly/creamy filling that filled it about 1/4 of the way up the tennis ball sized dome.  It was ok.  I wish I'd have ordered something else.  Hubby said his apple cobbler wasn't seasoned and wasn't really sweet.  Just tasted like sliced apples.  Said they could've seasoned the breading more also.  More sugar & cinnamon.  To finish, we are not food snobs in the least bit.  I just thought that a top rated restaurant was be infinitely better than it actually was.  I would like to go back and try different entrees and dessert.

There's waaay more  sauce than bread though, so I just used the yummy sauce to flavor some of my other food.  Additional bread is available for $1.50.\\n\\nTom Yum soup ($6):  Got this on my second visit and it was delivered steaming hot to the table.  Filled with chunks of fresh tomato, cucumbers, & bell pepper strips, shrimp, mushrooms, rice noodles, and bean sprouts, this Thai soup's spicy lemon grass broth gave these jaded old taste buds a jolt!\\n\\nRoast Duck Tacos ($5):  Recommended by a fellow Yelper, but I found them uninspired.  My roast duck was served at room temp and there were gristles among the chunks of duck meat in my tortilla.  Another thing: Maybe it's just me, but when I bite into my tacos, I like them to crunch (though NOT with gristle)!  With a few limp strands of green stuff inside, these *didn't.*  And I didn't care much for the brown sauce either.\\n\\nBBQ Pork \\"Char Siu\\" ($4.50):  Several years ago while on vacation in Waikiki, I took Hawaii Food Tours' \\"Hole-in-the-Wall\\" tour of Honolulu.  Our stop in that city's AMAZING Chinatown (which is surely one of the best!) yielded some wonderfully tasty morsels, among them transcendent chunks of warm, bbq char siu marbelled with little ribbons of glistening pork fat.  I've been hoping to find something close to it ever since.  But the cold, dry slices of pork I was served at Hawkers were in no way able to rekindle the love affair I started with the dish I fell in love with in Oahu!\\n\\n5-Spice Calamari ($6.50):  Delivered hot to the table from the fryer -- in an unfortunate puddle of grease.  Making the claim of \\"too much food,\\" I offered them to an unsuspecting fellow diner who seemed thrilled to get them.\\n\\nService:  We were a party of six.  Service was extremely pleasant without being intrusive.  Servers seem used to the fact that people order a little and eat a little, then order some more, so there were frequent visits to the table.  Some dishes -- like the room temp duck tacos -- came immediately, while others -- the deep fried stuff -- took a little longer to arrive.  Our request for separate checks was cheerfully honored.  Water glasses were kept full.  \\n\\nAmbiance:  Clean, light & bright, attractive modern interior like no place else in O-Town, especially in this district.  Noise level: happy chatter. \\n\\nNote to Yelpers:  There is a check-in offer for a free order of vegetarian fried spring rolls with chili sauce.

You should leave immediately and head to one of the places where they can overcharge you for inauthentic \\"organic\\" sushi, like Whole Foods.\\n\\nShiki is about getting really delicious, really incredible Japanese small plates - some of the stuff is a little different but if you give it a chance, you'll realize it's all really tasty and there's a reason practically every other person in the restaurant is speaking Japanese. (Who knew there's actually a sizable Japanese expat community in Boston?)\\n\\nMy favorite thing to get here is the ika natto, or squid with fermented soybean. It's an acquired taste for sure, but once you acclimate, it's one of the best compositions in texture you can get in Boston. The natto becomes sticky and gooey, almost quivering with this funky, earthy, briny flavor. Then, you chew a piece of squid, still chewy but more solid, a more fleshy bite with a snap that I liken to biting through a sausage casing.\\n\\nOther things to order are the tuna-nagaimo tartare, fried oysters, ebi mayo, and the ochazuke with ume cha. The last dish is a really pretty presentation, with a single shiso leaf placed on rice, accompanied by a tea pot containing the broth that you pour over the bowl.\\n\\nThe best deal they have here is definitely the kaiseki lunch. They have three options, differing in portion size, called Plum, Bamboo, and Pine. Pine is the largest and my favorite to order, and it's essentially the prettiest, most varied bento box ever. The last time I was there, I got a bowl of soba, several pieces of sashimi over rice (like a mini chirashi bowl), some really tasty fried bits, and a chawanmushi with bits of clam. \\n\\nIf you're going to Shiki, go with an open mind. The menu is really exciting and varied compared to most sushi places in Boston and it's a great opportunity to see what authentic Japanese food looks like!"},{"name":"Oudom Thai & Sushi","address":"100 S Eola Dr, Ste 105","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This is our favorite Thai restaurant in Orlando.

In addition, I know from a friend that these young ladies have to pass a reasonably thorough beer knowledge exam but their lack of 1st hand beer drinking experience often makes their beer talk seemed strained, like they're reading a corporate mission statement.

The friendly and oddly attractive host seated us promptly.  It was monday night, so it was pretty slow.\\n\\nOur server was absolutely delightful.  She was beautiful and friendly and absolutely delightful to talk to.  Delightful as she was, however, she only had two other tables and she could have been a bit more attentive.  She didn't refill our water glasses at all and we had to wait a long time for the check.  We got everything we needed, but with two other tables, we shouldn't have had to wait as long as we often did.  But again, she was delightful and I might have a crush on her.\\n\\nBeing a German restaurant they had a large selection of beers.  I don't remember what I had, but it was a pilsner of some sort and it was good.  Sadly, they were out of the one I really wanted.  They were out of several of them.\\n\\nThe best part of this experience, rightly so, was the food.  I ordered the jagerschnitzel, and opted for the spaetzle as a side instead of the mashed potatoes.  By the way, my grandma is German.  Very German.  Like, she didn't know \\"hello\\" in English before she came to the USA during WWII.  And she's a damn fine cook.  The spaetzle was every bit as good as what my grandma made, but in all fairness it's freeform egg noodles, so you can hardly go wrong.  The veal was tender and delicious and there was also a side of green beans which were good.  It has been ten years since my grandma was able to cook for me, and of course this didn't compare, but I didn't leave feeling disappointed.  For an Americanized chain restaurant it was actually really good.  Nothing compares to your grandma's cooking, but since I can't have that anymore, this wasn't a bad substitute."},{"name":"The Side Door","address":"425 SE Washington St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great sandwiches!

Despite our 7:30 reservation, had to wait about 25 minutes for our table so got a drink in the back bar. When we sat down, we unfortunately had to deal with a pretty horrible server. Stephanie spoke so softly we could barely hear her. When we asked about the wine jugs, she gave us an attitude when we ordered with a specific wine, didn't realize it was house only (skip it next time, both red and white were not good). We had to ask for bread, twice...and we still never received it. Food was okay; portions were a bit small for appetizers but there is a lot of variety to pick from. I ordered the chicken parm and was going to pay the extra 6 bucks to add pasta too it but unfortunately Stephanie did not put the pasta in the order so I had to wait for my pasta to be brought out while everyone's else's entrees were hot on the table for 10 minutes. She did not apologize for any of her mistakes, in fact, she barely checked on us, but luckily a really kind food runner profusely apologized for the mistake and I would like to think of it as opening weekend jitters.

I was pretty excited seeing a fairly unique spread of offerings here.\\n\\nSurprisingly, this was probably my first bad experience with food at a wine bar.  I had the prosciutto mac and cheese and the smoked chicken and goat cheese crepe.  Both of these options were not terribly expensive, but they sure were mediocre.\\n\\nThe prosciutto mac and cheese advertised truffle oil and goat cheese.  So... prosciutto, goat cheese, truffle oil, and cream sauce... those should definitely constitute something amazing.  Sadly, the large bowl of shell pasta had nothing more than cream and butter.  The sauce was extremely bland, and it had no cheese flavor whatsoever, much less any trace amount of truffle oil.  Also, there were only flecks of prosciutto.\\n\\nThe crepe was slightly better.  The tomato and red pepper coulis was cold; that sucked.  The chicken was warm; that was better.  The crepe was soggy; that sucked.  There was a glob of goat cheese on top; that sucked.  All in all, it was an acceptable crepe, nothing more.  The salad on the side had huge slices of raw red onion, some chopped up red peppers and sun-dried tomatoes, and spoiled mixed greens.  The greens had that off-black silver tint to it.  I am not a fan of bad greens.\\n\\nSo, I guess if you drink for cheap here and get a little inebriated, the food may taste better.  What I had was not good wine food.  I would have given this place a 2, but wine food should be somewhat refined.  Refined this food was not, even if it was affordable."},{"name":"Soul Vegetarian No  2","address":"652 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The food is great but it takes quite a while to receive your order.

First off I will say the wait staff, greaters, and food expediters were wonderful as always.  Sadly though our steaks were mostly gristle which having been a cattle rancher seems impossible for even a cheap Ribeye cut.  The vegetables and potatoes while well made (at some point in the past) seemed old, left over and were served cold.  Even though we came at dinner time I'm fairly certain these were made yesterday, overcooked, then not warmed up enough in a microwave after being in a fridge all day.  To put it bluntly the center of the veges and scallop potatoes were actually served cold.\\n\\nI believe this restaurant is either suffering from success or a really poor cook, and must have a really bad manager procuring steaks.  Even though both steaks were cooked \\"perfectly\\" medium well (one a tad burned due to fat) they were more gristly than a really cheap HEB sirloin.

The first few bites were cooked to perfection however the middle of my steak was extremely pink. I decided that I was not going to complain because the service had been so great and I would just take the remainder to go. When my server came back to the table she realized my steak was not cooked like I asked and was extremely apologetic and pretty much begged for me to send it back so that they could cook it to perfection. Not only did she take my plate back but she insisted on taking my friends plate also to keep their food warm while mine was cooking. When she brought it back she replenished the sides on both of our plates. Also to apologize she brought out three complimentary birthday desserts. My experience here was like none ever before. I give this restaurant five stars. I have dined at many restaurants in the Atlanta area an have not had service as good as this.

In case you ever eat with us ( secret handshake info coming soon), here are some of them.\\n\\nFirst. It's family style. Order to share.Order something everyone likes. Listen to what others order.Don't order weird. If I'm with the people in my family who don't eat  Szechuan eggplant...I don't get it. I pout but I deal.\\n\\nSecond. Everyone chooses one dish. Don't duplicate things. If I choose sweet and sour chicken don't order sweet and sour shrimp. Don't order all dishes with the same protein. Make sure there is a balance of fried to veggies to noodles, etc. \\n\\nFinally. We eat steamed rice, we drink hot tea and iced water, and we use chopsticks. We take the fortune cookie closest to us and we read it aloud. \\n\\nOn this day we got bbq pork ( delicious), fried flat wonton (crunchy), princess chose eggflower soup (pretty standard), sweet and sour chicken (my pick perfect), shrimp lo mein ( too much brown sauce and needed veggies, i chose this on the fly for hubby who checked out ...too much ironman 3 maybe),and tangy pork with wood ear ( bils pick...kinda weird but actually tasty). Steamed rice, which costs extra which cost them a star. I think that is lame. It was good rice. But honestly? Just raise your dishes menu prices by $1.\\n\\nPrincess loved the sweet and sour and the barbecue pork. This is a good family place.I like the nicely folded napkins and the lemon slice in my water, too. \\n\\nMy mom and my aunts on both sides always chose Chinese for special days.

Here's the lowdown:\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\n1) Decor feels right for a mexican restaurant\\n2) They're nice\\n3) They're really close to me\\n4) It's not super expensive.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\n1) Limited menu\\n2) Bland salsa and meat\\n3) The Mole sauce tastes like it's from a can\\n4) It's too expensive for what you get (I realize this conflicts with 4 above :))\\n\\nIf you are a fan of bland Tex-Mex food, this might be the restaurant for you. Let's say you're like my dad and have gone 60+ years without ever eating anything resembling \\"ethnic\\" food. This might be a good gateway into Mexican food without going for something with full-on flavor that might, you know, kill you.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if you already are a fan of Mex/Tex-Mex, and you come here, you will be sad. Please to be going to Tu y Yo instead for some kickass Interior Mexican. If you want straight up Tex-Mex, try Ixtapa in Woburn, which is the current king best this side of the river."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"100+ of different beer type, service is excellent t open and large outdoor seating decided to try this place while in town for a conference overall the experience is awesome"},{"name":"The Soda Fountain","address":"2525 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"What a great new addition to College Park! The shop has a fun retro vibe and is the perfect mix of  classic ice cream parlor and novelty retail experience. The ice cream is locally produced and features both traditional and deliciously unique flavors such as almond marzipan (my favorite!!!!), strawberry basil, chai, and nutella. The lemon thyme peppercorn was not up my alley but is definitely worth a taste. The menu is still in development but already includes some remarkable offerings such as The Elvis (nutella ice cream, peanut butter sauce, whipped cream, and...wait for it...CANDIED BACON), as well as classic sundaes and floats. If you don't have much of a sweet tooth you can still find a variety of unique merchandise to satisfy any shopaholic. Classic snacks like moon pies and Necco wafers, novelty gifts, and retro d√©cor line the walls, which makes the experience even more fun. Last, but certainly not least, the staff there are wonderful, super friendly, and very knowledgeable about the community. They're the best (soda) jerks in town!

Ate here tonight for a regular dinner and was somewhat disappointed/shellshocked upon leaving.  A few things were good--poke and the Buddha roll among them--but the Typhoon roll, one of the most expensive on the menu, was a yucky meld of indistinct fishes and cherry tomatoes marinated in fish sauce, maybe?  Yuck.  When I brought it to the waitress' attention, she was friendly and apologetic enough, but left it on the bill after consulting with the chef.  Needless to say, I'm not impressed by whatever discourteuous logic led them to charge me for the quarter-eaten plate, and I won't be back.

They are average in taste. Skin is thicker than the other famous Shanghai haunts - Din Tai Fung, etc.  It is not bad, just not Michelin star. \\n- Pickled pork fried rice cake. This style of noodles provides a thick chewy texture, similar to gnocchi. The pickled veggie and pork provides a nice tangy zing. This dish reminds me of my mom and is a must order for me every chance I get. \\n- Sichuan beef noodles. Another staple. Similar to Long's. Flavor is Meh. \\n- Pan fried dumplings with leeks. It had a light and subtle garden taste that is brought out by the leeks stuffing. Not heavy, greasy. I like this one. \\n- Shanghai pan fried dumplings. This is its signature dish. Eat this hot so that when you bite into it, the soup is still liquid. It is also nice to have the soup soak into the bun too. Matter of preference. Must order. \\n-Other tips. If you like more kick and spice just ask the server for Doubanjiang, a spicy fermented bean paste that some (like me) add to enhance soup and noodle dishes. \\n- Service is fine and not pretentious, unlike some other places. \\n- Overall: If I stick to ordering what I liked, then it achieves 4 Stars in my books."},{"name":"Nikki Sushi & Steak","address":"15135 SW Barrows Rd, Ste 145","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"Spicy crispy tuna rolls and vegetable green dragon rolls are all I need.

This restaurant uses a model that is becoming more popular (seasonal, local, sustainable), but their execution is top-notch.   It's one thing to have a server tell you that a restaurant cold smokes their own salmon in-house for three days with a variety of spices, it's something else to have to restrain yourself from shoveling that salmon on a potato pancake into your face hole because OHMYGODITISSODELICIOUS.\\n\\nHeracles Strengths:  From the moment we set foot through the door, Canoe offered excellent service.  The food is amazing, but again, the experience is what really put this place over the top.  My date was quite enthusiastic about his shrimp-stuffed calamari with Spanish chorizo, which thankfully kept his fork from straying too often towards my own appetizer of the aforementioned smoked salmon.  He also ordered the trout with salmon tortellini and blue crab b√©chamel, which again, kept him happy and me from being forced to stab him so that only I might eat all of my rabbit with bacon ravioli.  Try the chocolate grotto for dessert.  I was a little wary initially, thinking it might just be another chocolate/sweet/salty dessert, but I could not have been more mistaken.  It has a delicious balance from the rich chocolate and the light mousse.  \\n\\nAphrodite Factor:  TOTALLY a great date night spot.  This is definitely an upscale place, so you don't have to worry about a toddler throwing cheerios at you while you're trying to talk.\\n\\nHermes Rating:  Pacing is everything with a menu like theirs.  We spent about 2 hours enjoying our appetizers, entrees and desserts.  Nothing felt rushed, and we had plenty of time to enjoy each course.  Refills were quick, but not such that you felt like someone was constantly hovering the instant you took a sip.  \\n\\nAchilles Heel:  They have valet? Yes, I know that's not a question, but I really cannot think of any negatives about this experience so I am forced to use a question mark to reflect the change in tone for my internal dialogue when attempting to find a flaw with this place.  It doesn't bother me, but I have friends who find nothing more annoying than being forced into valet service.  \\n\\nLibations:  EXCELLENT cocktails here.  I had the zenzero, which was pleasantly spicy and sweet, without being too overpowering.  Very reminiscent of cocktails I've had at Holeman and Finch.  For a second drink I had the Moscow Mule, also delicious, made from ginger beer and vodka.  Both of my drinks were ginger-based, but very different from each other.  There's an extensive wine and beer selection as well, for those of you who don't like the hard stuff.  \\n\\nOffering:  I hate saying a place is \\"expensive\\" because it makes it sound like it wasn't worth it.

From the outside it doesn't look like much but it's actually a decent size and really popular because the place was packed. The decorations are really cool and I think from local artists as some had prices on them. I wasn't in the mood for pancakes so I ordered OJ and decided to try the Ultimate Migas which comes with Migas, hash, refried beans, and choice of tortillas. The beans WERE SO GOOD. They taste like my Abuelita makes them, and I was astonished that a little place like this had such bomb beans. The whole dish was amazing and I was super satisfied with the the amount of food. I ordered a cafe mocha to go and it was really tasty, the coffee beans are 100% Arabica and locally roasted.

I stuck with a more traditional meat and went with the dak bulgogi, a chicken sausage topped with oyster sauce, sriracha, dried shrimp and a whole bunch of other toppings. It went a little overboard for me, and it was far too difficult to eat (I refused to eat it with a knife and fork, and ended up making a mess...). I also ordered their small poutine, which fell a little flat. They use melted mozzarella instead of cheese curds, and the fries seemed soggy, even before being covered by gravy.

Well, more to the cocktail scene. While I'm happy with my experiences there so far, I would name a few places over this if asked for a recommendation in the area.\\n\\nWhat I like: the bar, the bartenders and the drinks. It really is a beautiful bar and a wonderful cocktail menu. My first time here was after the Oktoberfest parade and while I rarely fly solo, I had heard about the new opening featuring cocktails by Brother Cleve. The place was immediately inviting as I walked  in from the suddenly chilly air. I don't usually notice this, but the windows are really nice and combined with the lighting inside, it was a great setting for a stag drink. I took a while reading over the drinks and the bartender was friendly and patient. Asking for \\"that drink from the Improper\\" was enough to get me going. It was called the Rock Steady and it was really good. Other things ordered since: Fedora, The Nap, Boulevardier, Bossa Nova, Pimms Cup, and Tennesee Tuxedo. All very good as far as I can remember (one stood out but now it's a bit hazy). \\n\\nWhat I didn't like as much: the dining areas. They just feel a bit dark and depressing, especially compared to the much nicer bar area. Red brick walls, plain wooden booths, and stark factory/mining lighting cages give it sort of a back alley feel. \\n\\nThe food: Most of the criticism I've seen so far centered around the food. Pretty much everything we had was good. Honestly, nothing was great, and as I mentioned before, I would send people elsewhere specifically for a nice dinner. The burger was good but was a bit soggy underneath. I still enjoyed it, but if I'm being picky and honestly reviewing a $15 burger, I have to ding them for it. Still, when you take it all together with the experience of the great drinks, it's a positive experience."},{"name":"Steak ‚Äôn Shake","address":"4500 S Highway 17-92","city":"Casselberry","stars":"2.5","text":"Yeah Mon great burgers&notices,can't beat the quality and the prices only beat by Ruby's but it's $6.00 more,great service& friendly Mgmt"},{"name":"Nikki Sushi & Steak","address":"15135 SW Barrows Rd, Ste 145","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"***second visit***\\nExperience was better for lunch.

I would recommend rolls over sashimi dishes.  Still don't know why you have to pay extra for salad and miso soup.  Also, I do like they are open on Sundays for lunch and dinner.  Most Japanese restaurants are closed on Sundays.\\n\\n***first visit***\\nOverall, I was not impressed with this place.  It does fit well with the rest of the restaurants at Progress Ridge.

I don't think that's right when you are trying to be a Japanese restaurant.  Kim Chee ain't Japanese!!!  No miso soup or salad with your entrees.  C'mon!

I'm an aspiring vegetarian but my boyfriend swears by their mushroom cowboy burger and steak burrito.  \\n\\nIf you're looking for a convenient breakfast/lunch spot in downtown Danvers with really fast service, I highly recommend this place.

I Had a classic Reuben on Marble Rye, my partner opted for a traditional bacon cheeseburger. As an appetizer we had Ultimate Nachos which feature Waxys Crisps which are vinegar potato chips (available sepe\\nrately with onion dip) which are kind of like thick cape cod chips- and to die for.

Lamb was melt in your mouth. The sauces--I mixed white garlic with the tomato at his suggestion and it was a really good choice. People with me had the chicken and loved it.

As much as I read reviews, I thought this place could be a good place for sushi/sashimi. I was slightly wrong...this place is really more like Izakaya style and there is no sushi counter to serve. I looked up menu provided along with a few specials...noticed nice selections of Sake. Unfortunately, IMHO, they are overly priced. Also, they should be noted if particular brands are not available on the menu; I ended up asking four different ones until I hit one they had. Anyway, sashimi came with very small portion to begin with...and so was sushi. After ordering what I wanted to eat, price came out almost same as that of O-Ya...this means \\"pricey\\" for me. Though some fish were good, like Hirame and Salmon, Tuna did not make a cut as it was thin and semi-dry...means lost flavor. Engawa (part of Fluke) was prepared poorly. Sweet Shrimp was OK; but no serving of shrimp head fried - which I asked about but waitress simply said not such a thing :(\\nOK if you are looking for Izakaya style place, I think this place is a good place; but just looking for sushi/sashimi for your appetite, I don't think this place will fit for that. Despite many other good reviews, I can only give 2-stars."},{"name":"B2 Cafe","address":"5930 Reg Bug Lake Rd","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"My dad and I ate here for breakfast three or four months ago, and we both thought the food was very disappointing. However, since I live nearby, I thought I'd give it another shot and try the lunch there. My sandwich was ok, but could have been better, especially with Jimmy John's next door and Panera across the street. The positives were that both times I went, we were greeted by a friendly employee, the ambiance in the restaurant itself is nice and I didn't have to wait long for my food. \\n\\nMy main constructive criticism is that better food ingredients need to be used. When we had breakfast there, my dad's scrambled eggs came out in the form of a patty, and it looked and tasted just like the eggs that are microwaved and served in the lobby of the Holiday Inn Express. Additionally, when his bagel came out of the kitchen, he asked for cream cheese and was then told that he'd have to pay extra for that. (Cream cheese should be included in the price of a bagel at any restaurant. That's like ordering a salad and charging extra for the dressing.) \\n\\nThe sandwich that I had today was ok. The deli meat that was used was clearly not of ultra-high quality, and options other than white bread should be available. Overall, the sandwich wasn't bad, just very plain. My side of potato salad was not that great. I have a feeling that it is not prepared onsite and is instead just scooped. \\n\\nAside from that, I would recommend to the management to place prices on the menu on the wall behind the counter and I would also ease up on all of the \\"B2\\" branding in the restaurant. I would take down most of the silly chef logos, because it's almost like the company is screaming the brand at us inside while we're eating. But most importantly, I would focus on improving the quality of the ingredients and the preparation of the food. \\n\\nSo, was it terrible? No. Would I go back? I would like to one day, but I hope the restaurant is able to make some improvements as I don't think the quality of the food was up to par for a sit-down restaurant."},{"name":"Fresa's - South 1st","address":"1703 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"My family and I stumbled in to Fresa's Saturday evening.

My pants and my sons were still wet from the splash pad and we all looked like the last thing we planned for the day was a nice dinner out.  \\n\\nWe walked up to the outdoor hostess stand and observed a much more refined backyard than the one we were accustomed to with Freddie's Place.  When we were asked if we had reservations, we immediately assumed that this would not be the laid back family spot that it once was and started making contingency dinner plans in our minds.  The hostess informed us that it was the soft opening, but assured us that they had plenty of room for walk-ins and urged us to stay.  We were led to our table indoors where we all shuttered at the idea of actually having our kids sit at the table through dinner where there were only a limited number of other seemingly much more well behaved children there.  Just as a waiter delivered water, we decided we should probably just head to Rudy's for some BBQ.  Well, they would have none of it and again assured us that we were welcome.  We decided to give it a shot and we are so thankful that we did.\\n\\nJust as our drinks arrived, friends of ours walked in and were seated next to us.  The meal arrived shortly after and did not dissappoint.  We took the lead of the waiter since we were unfamiliar with the menu.  He ordered quesadillas & horchata for the kids and set the adults up with the steak with chimichurri & anchiote and citrus chicken and guacamole for the table.  Each plate was served with lime, grilled onions, salsa, rice and beans and everything was excellent.  The waiter gave us the choice of several desserts.

It seems like you're getting a great value for $21.99 (I think) because there's such a huge variety of food included: variety of sashimi (including a large shrimp), appetizers (scallop, octopus, etc.), uni and eel over rice, chawanmushi (steamed egg), mini bowl of udon with seaweed, fried tempura shrimp and vegetables, and a few fruits. \\n\\nUnfortunately, it was not executed well in many aspects. \\n\\n1. While they were generous with the ingredients in the chawanmushi, to me it was an epic fail. You can see many bubbles on top of it, which made the texture a little rough. It was also overcooked, so it was a little dense. It was a far cry from what chawanmushi is supposed to be like, which is silky and soft.\\n2. The bowl of udon and fried tempura was lukewarm when served, instead of hot. I tried eating those first because I don't like it when my food isn't piping hot, but discovered that it was not served hot to begin with! \\n3. While the shrimp sashimi was good, I couldn't help but notice that when I picked up the salmon sashimi, it broke into 3 pieces every single time. The fish is pretty fresh, so it must be the way that they handled the fish or perhaps the part of the fish.\\n4. The uni and eel was served over a block of rice that was way too dense. It seemed to be made in a mold as it had very sharp corners. \\n\\nNot only was the food subpar, the service was extremely slow and it was difficult to get hold of a waiter, the only way we could catch a waiter was when they served us something.

Yep, the chefs here do tricks like throwing knives, catching egg shells in their hats etc. \\nYou can choose what kind of meat you want for hibachi- steak, shrimp, scallops, chicken etc. You can also choose between fried rice and white rice- they charge extra for fried rice. I recommend choosing fried rice because the chef will make the fried rice in front of you. White rice- it just comes out of the rice cooker, there is no show to watch. All meals come with salad, miso soup, vegetables (squash, bean sprouts), and shrimp. The chef will prepare the veg and shrimp in front of you. You also get 2 dipping sauces- ginger and mustard. The ginger was good, the mustard one was super super mustardy. If you hate mustard and horseradish, you won't like this dipping sauce.\\n\\nThe portions sizes are huge, so come here hungry. We had a group of people a at our hibachi table, who only wanted to watch the show, but decided to eat sushi instead. Cocktails are reasonable (about $7). You should get the volcano bowl (rum, curacao and fruit juice), I wish they had lit it on fire but they didn't.\\n\\nOverall, a great place to take out of town guests or hibachi-virgins!"},{"name":"Sckavone's","address":"4100 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The food was great!

Unbelievably poor and amateurish service. \\n\\nDetails: I walked in at about 8:30 pm, on a Monday night, and placed an order for carry out. Nothing fancy - 2 entrees and naan. The young girl at the reception, brilliant smile and all, told me \\"45 minutes\\". That seemed like a lot so I asked if there was anything on the menu I could get sooner. She said \\"nope... even if you order just naan, it will take 45 minutes\\". Fine... I had a couple of phone calls to get through so I figured I'd wait in my car 45 minutes. 45 minutes later, at 9:15 I walk in asking about my food, and the girl says she will check. 5 minutes later she has run by me a dozen times, but doesn't offer any update. I ask again, to which she says \\"I'm not the one cooking, but I'll check\\".  She disappears in the kitchen for a while, and I stop the only other staff member in sight - another kid. This kid is obviously fresh off the boat from India, speaks little English and is a complete deer in the headlights. Seemed sweet just like his female colleague, but that's not a quality that was helping me any. He also offers to check. It's now been 55 minutes and no food and no info in sight. \\n\\nI finally ask the boy to get the manager. This is when it gets really bizarre. Kid says \\"manager is in the back. I'll tell him you want to speak to him, but I don't know if he will come out and talk to you\\". Sure enough, manager refuses to come out and talk to me. I ask again and again I'm told he refuses. \\n\\nInstead, I'm told - \\"any minute now. Just waiting for the naans to get done\\". \\n\\nTime goes by... it's nearly 10 pm and everything is either shut or will shut in no time. I give the 2 kids an ultimatum - give me my food, or whatever you have ready, in the next 2 minutes, otherwise I leave. One of them disappears inside the kitchen to check, and the other one gets busy serving other customers. I wait five minutes and neither of them show up with my food, or with info. I have really no choice but to leave, and barely managed to catch Chik-Fil-A before they shut otherwise it would have been cereal for dinner. :)\\n\\nI've seen poor service before. This is in a league of its own. I fault the manager. What he was doing in the back, refusing to talk to an irate customer... is beyond me. Why he has staffed two inexperienced kids in the front of the store, and no one to really manage customer orders or expectations, is another mystery.\\n\\nUltimately, how dare Maanas think it can waste 75 minutes of someone's time and not even have the decency to apologize, or have the person in charge show up for a face to face conversation.

I made a reservation via Open Table (yay!), however you don't receive any points for your reservation (hmmm). Regardless, they did have our table ready upon our arrival - while there is ample indoor and outdoor seating, I would still recommend the reservation to ensure you have a seat ready or in the queue. We were seated indoors and then seemed to be inbetween servers or server areas, so it took a bit for us to get waited on. As a result, we were given free appetizers (boiled peanuts and fried pickles) and my cousin got a beer on the house (and speaking of the beer, they have a varied selection of multiple brews on tap, so lots to consider in terms of mixing flavors and styles with your sausage choice). None of us cared for the peanuts, but we certainly liked the pickles (with a kick!). I then went for the hot dog and it is bigger than the bun - about twice the size - and a nice traditional taste to it. Nothing fancy, but certainly a good hot dog.

Enjoy a wide range of coffees, sandwiches and soups. My personal favorites are the grilled ham and cheese w/ potato salad or the soup du jour.

Not reservation busy, but you should certainly expect a few minutes in the lobby before getting a seat during the peak lunch period. The cafe is quite loud, servers and cooks talking across the bar and to customers. It's really nice actually. I enjoy hearing the cooks talk about their orders and a busy restaurant is usually a happy one. The service could use some work but overall this is a staple of my lunches in Austin. I love this cafe and will continue to be a repeat customer.\\n\\nPersonal favorites: Grilled Ham & Cheese, Lentil Soup, Caramel Macciato or any of their expressos or latte's.

But I live on the West Side. This is a conundrum. \\n\\nTry a new place? \\n\\nOk. \\n\\nIt was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and we wanted to eat outside, so approaching the patio, I asked a server if we could sit at an empty table. No, he said, you have to go in through the hostess station. So we took our limping child ( in an air cast) through the not so close front door, and asked the hostess, she said, well maybe... but... by the time we got near the patio, another family had snagged the last open table. \\n\\nSigh.This made the princess a bit tearful, and the husband launched into grumpyville. \\n\\nThere were empty tables parked next to full ones ( two two tops together, for two people?) so they could have made some arrangements for the three of us, but they didn't offer, and I was tired of the rejection.I didn't push it.

Kid ordered kid's menu nachos, which turned out to be a small pile of chips with melted cheese, a few black beans and a dollop sour cream ( which came with a sprinkle of olives, although not mentioned on the kid's menu), and applesauce, and a beverage for $4.99 even though the kid's menu said $5.99. \\n\\nIf you're going to put olives on a kid's item, you need to mention it.

Allegedly there was roasted garlic, I think... I didn't see any. It wasn't bad. It wasn't great. I think the proscuitto was added after the pizza was cooked, which was unexpected, and the basil leaves were a bit weedy, cut into shreds instead of torn whole like we'd do at home... we love basil, we found that part kinda unappetizing. We also shared a small Caeser salad, which was heavy with dressing, and had some cheddar cheese on it... I don't think there was supposed to be cheddar cheese on it, but husband thought they did it on purpose.The dressing was just ok.It wasn't a beautiful salad.

Whoa, but it was such a great first experience - both taste wise and cultural wise. We got the option for 2 people. \\n\\nThe first course was a mini 'hotpot' type of dish, with lean and thinly sliced beef, it's dipped in this boiling tabletop pot to cook. Then it's wrapped inside thin rice paper, along with different veggies (e.g. Chinese basil, lettuce, bean sprouts, sliced cucumber, apple) and a type of fishsauce). Very light but extremely flavorful combination; the savory taste of the fresh beef with crunchiness of the veggies.\\n\\nThe second course was the same mini pot but 'stir fried' with butter. Similarly prepared beef slices with a spicy marinate, wrapped the same way as the first course. A sizzling twist.\\n\\nThe third course was a type of beef salad, with marinated rare beef slices, peanuts and herbs. I wrapped the slices inside lettuce, the rare beef was extremely tender, well flavored and with only the lettuce, you are able to enjoy the rawness of the dish.\\n\\nThe fourth course was a congee with minced beef. The portion is huge! Enough for at least 5-6 small bowls. And the flavor, the best. It's a congee with light taste of the minced beef, not greasy. It's a perfect dish to be enjoyed between the cold and hot meat courses, true comfort food for the stomach. \\n\\nThe fifth, sixth and seventh dishes came together. One is a type of Vietnamnese meatball which comes with shrimp chips. I had to skip the chips because by this point I was sufficiently full. The meatball itself was delicious, with minimal things beyond meat, the flavor is light and not overwhelming. The herbs and peanuts intertwined inside the meatball adds an additional zesty flavor to it. The second one was a type of sausage wrapped inside banana leaves, I think the leaves help to absorb the oil from the sausage itself. The sausage was well prepared, extremely flavorful, a combination of spicy, sweet and salty, tenderly cooked, the meat is a little less lean than the beef slices, It's one of the heavier dishes in the 7 course meal. The last but not least, it's my favorite, it's a beef-rollup wrapped around a piece of onion. What flavor, the beef was so perfectly prepared, the marinate exquisite. Because it's really a slice of beef wrapped, it doesn't absorb as much oil and does not feel greasy at all. The onion adds an additional crunch and flavoring to the dish. \\n\\nIt's really a 5 star for my food experience here, but I want to reserve that for when I come here again to try more dishes. But it was definitely delicious.\\n\\nOn the other note, the parking is ample in the lot right across the street. The price was very reasonable, we were dying from being over-stuffed (with left overs to take back home) and the price tag was somewhere around $30 for the entire 7 course for 2 people."},{"name":"Umi","address":"3050 Peachtree Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday and everything was amazing!

A blender was on for our ENTIRE dining experience and the acoustics are awful inside the restaurant so it was echoing loudly throughout the restaurant and made it difficult to talk.

Garnished with some cheese, cilantro and onions.

The only other issue was my sandwich (Royal with Brie), was not all I had dreamed it would be. Full disclosure: yes, I still ate it all. The brie used was of high quality, but the roast beef was a bit under-seasoned and the creole mustard was overpoweringly horseradish-iy.

We had high expectations based on the reviews so I want be very specific, both the service and the food were not 4/5-star ratings, yet. \\n\\nThe service - we waited close to 20 minutes for water and then had to wait to place our drink orders; the drink orders came out slowly, individually; i.e. the beer came out and then another 5+ minutes passed before the mixed cocktail appeared. I find it to be a poor customer experience when half the table is served and the others have to wait more than seconds for their order.  I ordered iced tea; the presentation was lovely - carafe of tea, thinly sliced lemon and simple suger...but no spoon! I had to wait too long for the spoon and then they gave me a tablespoon. This may seem petty but it reflects on their commitment to service details; I should have received an iced tea spoon or a teaspoon and not a tablespoon.  (FYI I always use Bacchanalia as the bar in Atlanta to measure outstanding service).\\n\\nThe menu is pretty eclectic and requires explanation of several items in the dishes. Our waiter either didn't know or didn't want to take the time. We wanted to know how it was prepared and presented, you know - garnish or part of the dish, for the most part all we got was 'it is very good.' For appetizer I had the pork rillettes with radish salad; I understood it to be more salad-like but it was bread with a pork pate spread. Had it been described in this manner I would not have ordered it. The 'radish salad' was poor - pieces of wilted lettuce with a few paper thin slices of radish. One person had the frisee salad he thought was good. The fried oysters were said to be good.\\n\\nEntrees - I had the prawn. It was 4 prawns, the size of medium shrimp, not kidding. I was done before the others started eating, oh...don't let me forget it also had a wilted radish salad as garnish.  If prawns are out of season they should have been removed from the menu; I almost regret not speaking up at dinner but I hate to ruin everyone else's evening.  One person had the quail, he thought it was good but not blown away; the menu description sounded as if it came with sides but it did not. One small quail stuffed.  A good waiter would have told us the portions were small and encouraged us to order sides. Our friends enjoyed the shared trout entr√©e but the man said he could have eaten the whole trout. \\n\\nMy favorite dishes were the sides that had David Sweeney written all over them. Fregole (couscous) with black mushrooms and braised cabbage.

From the second we arrived until when we left, we felt not only welcomed, but actually LIKED. The service was exceptional. EXCEPTIONAL. Combined with the delicious food and the comfortable and intimate setting, this was such a great experience for all of us!\\n\\nMy husband and I were attending a conference at Agnes Scott College, and I had made the reservations several weeks in advance, but I was very happy to find we could walk to the restaurant and the beautiful square from the college. We were meeting a friend who lives in Atlanta, whom we get to see about once a year, if that, so we wanted to go somewhere we would feel comfortable and could take and enjoy each other. I couldn't use Open Table to make the reservation; I had to email the restaurant directly and wait for them to respond/confirm, but they did so promptly, and the form on the Website allowed me to say why we would be there, so I requested a comfortable, intimate table for us and our friend. \\n\\nWe were a little early for our reservation but they seated us immediately, even though we were waiting for our friend, which I thought was very \\"humane.\\" When we arrived, they were so friendly -- authentically friendly -- and when our friend arrived, my husband went to escort her to the table, and we had such a great time together all evening.\\n\\nMy husband was a little disappointed, because when I read him the online menu when I was choosing a restaurant, they were offering swordfish (one of his all-time favorite dishes), but when we arrived and were given the menus, they had changed. Also, we were not very hungry, as we had had a good-sized, late lunch. What we didn't know was that the offerings are \\"small plates,\\" so the entrees are not that large, but the waitress told us when we were choosing. I skipped an appetizer and chose the rabbit: rabbit galantine, carrot, fennel puree and purslane. It was absolutely delicious, and our friend, also chose this and absolutely loved it. She is more of a connoisseur of rabbit than I am, as I eat it in restaurants about once every five years, and she will even cook it at home. She thought it was just exquisite. My husband finally settled on the stuffed quail: quail stuffed with ricotta and arugula with polenta and aged balsamic vinegar. Everything tasted so amazing.\\n\\nDuring dinner, we had another service bright spot, aside from our waitress, who was delightful and incredibly attentive and helpful. Our friend wanted salt for her food, and as it wasn't on the table, she gestured to a passing waiter, who wasn't working on our table. She said, \\"I know you aren't working on this table, but I wondered if I could have some salt.\\" The woman brought the salt and said, and I kid you not, it was totally sincere, \\"Ma'am, we are ALL here for you, whatever you need, and please don't hesitate to ask me or anyone else if you need anything else. Anything at all!\\" We were gobsmacked by her friendly helpfulness!\\n\\nFor dessert, I chose the absolutely amazing brioche doughnuts with squash ice cream and pumpkin-seed brittle. The tastes went so well together and were so delightful and innovative. I would eat that again right now if I could get my hands on some! \\n\\nWe were absolutely delighted with every aspect of our visit to Cakes and Ale, and I would recommend it to anyone who was going to be anywhere in the area to dine here. It was perfection!\\n\\nThanks, Cakes & Ale!"},{"name":"Bombay Kitchen Authentic Indian Cuisine","address":"4107 Lawrenceville Hwy","city":"Tucker","stars":"4","text":"Authentic!

I asked why, my server explained they charge 20% on deposit and tax on not only the deposit, but also the tip (this also did not add up).

Very spacious and very very dog friendly. I went on a Saturday afternoon and there were tons of dogs. They even got an area for holding your dog if you don't want to manage them while you're eating/drinking.\\n\\nBanger's is an awesome place for getting beers. They have a wide and expansive selection, with limited and seasonal beers for you beer-junkies. I'm not a beer person, but I ordered a Crispin the Saint apple cider my first time and it has been my favorite since. The prices are very fair.\\n\\nI ordered a Smokey & the Boar. It wasn't exceptional, unfortunately. The sausage casing was very tough and made it hard to chew through it. I love the fact you can add more pepper toppings, the BYFO (burn your face offer) peppers are great, I could still taste it an hour after. My favorite thing about their sausages are the buns. I ALWAYS get the pumpernickel buns. The sweetness combined with the peppers adds a great taste to any sausage, even if my boar one was bland.\\n\\nMy only other issue, other than the tough sausage casing is the portion size. I feel it could be larger, but that's just my opinion. Which reminds me. The Poutine. My God. Once you have had poutine, you can't go back to regular fries. The gravy and cheese curds are sooo good and sooo bad for me. And same with the sausages, the portions of poutine could be larger.

It's not just a German restaurant, a place that does bangers and mash, or a casa de chorizo--they've got a little bit of everything on the menu from merguez to currywurst and it's all fan-freakin'-tastic. \\n\\nThey've got a beer list that rivals Draught House's and a huge dog-friendly outdoor seating area (complete with a dog run!) to boot. It's not as cozy as Draught House and the high ceilings indoor make it pretty loud, but to Banger's credit, it's still all bright, open and clean. There's a small stage outside for live music, which is nice, too. \\n\\nThe only thing that struck me a bit odd was the lack of plain ol' mayo. Aiolis are nice sometimes, but the garlic aioli that came with my currywurst was a bit strong for dipping my leftover fries in, so I just wanted some regular mayo. Nope--just aioli here. I got a side of the onion aioli, which was pretty tasty, but lacked the fluff and substance of the mayonnaise I was craving. Oh well. Then again, when Banger's has fabulous curry ketchup, maybe I don't need mayo after all. I need a pint of curry ketchup! \\n\\nService was a little slow since they're still trying to get the hang of things, but the waitresses seemed to know much of the ins and outs of the beer list, which was impressive given the sheer size of that thing. \\n\\nI'd give this place 42 stars if I could.

The portobello mushroom enchiladas were covered in flour-y tasting Velveeta, and the mushrooms themselves tasted like they had been marinated or cooked in teriyaki sauce. Bizzare. The Mexican rice had little seasoning other than an overwhemling dose of paprika. The Caesar dressing was basically lemon juice and olive oil.

My husband and his friend were still trying to decide about drinks and appetizers though. When we pointed that out he took our entree order and promised to come back for our drink order in a few minutes. 10 or 15 minutes later our entrees arrived, he still hadn't come back to ask about drinks and we had no silverware. It took another few minutes, while our meals were cooling, for us to try to flag him down for utensils.

I ordered the steamed crab, which the menu said was 3 knuckles, but I was served two knuckes and two extra legs. For the price, I expected to receive a full order.

The dessert (turtle sundae) lacked the nuts advertised in the menu. Not sure why but the waiter didn't explain that one. The ice cream tasted freezer-y and the brownies were mediocre at best. \\n\\nI got the crab I was craving, but everything else was so pathetic I wouldn't return.

Just about everything is made in house, including condiments. The spicy pickles were very flavorful, and the heat really builds. If you aren't a fan of spice beware. The cheese curds sadly didn't live up to Wisconsin expectations. They were good, but more like mozzarella bites than cheese curds. The spicy marinara sauce was well spiced and paired well.\\nOn my next trip I dug into the dinner menu. I *highly* recommend the South Texas Antelope & Venison Merguez. It is an north african themed sausage with red wine, red peppers, cinnamon, and cloves. Served on a pumpernickel bun, topped with caramelized onions and curry ketchup. Flavor heaven! I was shocked at how well the flavors balanced; a lot of places are trying to class up dishes with garnishes/sauces and they end up over powering the main course. I also tried the jalapeno cream corn as a side. It was equally delicious, with a very rich flavor. That being said the jalapeno flavor is intense just like the spicy pickles.

We are not slow eaters. They don't tend to your table, and we resorted to getting up to get our own refills half the time. With the appetizer (which took so long to come out), we had no serving plates and we using napkins to hold food. The main meal (brunch, pancakes) was lacking syrup. I got up to ask for syrup.

Note: the \\"homemade dipping sauces\\" that it says it comes with in the description....is ketchup. Just. Ketchup. Ok. \\n- Entr√©e: Country Baked Steak - I got the Luncheon Special which includes the main item + 2 sides. I got sweet potatoes and mac and cheese. I have to admit that all of these items were absolutely delicious. Very filling. The mac and cheese isn't like a traditional type - it is made with nutritional yeast. But it is very satisfying and addictive. \\n- Weekend Brunch Special - This comes with 2 vegan sausages, tofu scramble, and 2 massive pancakes. This was absolutely divine. The sausages were savory and a great texture. The tofu scramble had some of the smokey sausage flavor to it. I'm not even a huge tofu scramble fan but this was good. The pancakes won me over. They are massive so good luck eating it all! Fluffy and sweet. \\n- Cornbread - THIS is a winner. Light, cakey, buttery. They do cornbread so right. \\n- Dessert: Lemon Cake - No. So dry. No flavor to it at all. It's like they just threw random amounts of flour, vegan butter, and sugar in a bowl and called it a day. \\n- Dessert: Carrot Cake -  If you get a cake, do this one!

When it came to dessert I let order it for me and purchased a slice of Cheesecake for her for her  extraordinary service. I later purchased a slice of cheesecake for my customer when I went to pick her up and take her to the Orlando Airport. Before I left the restaurant I asked if Phillip (manager) can come over to my table but he was busy. Instead Pat Casey cam over and introduced himself to and he turned out to be the owner of the restaurant. Pat was very familiar with the Tampa area since he managed a restaurant many years ago in the Tampa area. I hope opens a restaurant in the Tampa area soon. I pointed out that Wesley Chapel and the Trinity area would be a perfect area for his restaurant. Hopefully one will open soon. As for Kimberly she is my server of choice when I return for a visit. Kimberly will do well in anything she puts her mind too.

I ordered the roti which was so delicious and good, loved the curry dipping sauce. I had the chicken egg rolls which were very filling. The wok lettuce was also surprisingly good, the shitake mushrooms were a perfect touch. The edamame and spring rolls were my least favorite. Edamame lacked salt and the beans seemed a touch undercooked. As for the spring rolls they were very bland, i didn't notice the shrimp add-on option til after i ordered. The star dishes of the night were definitely the bbq pork char siu which were tender pieces of pork in a delicious bbq sauce. Also the pork siu yoke which are crispy pieces of pork belly with a hoisan dipping sauce. And finally the duck boa buns. I ordered the purple mango sticky rice which i didn't much care for. I was excited to try this desert but it definitely let me down. I felt as though the rice was undercooked and too hard for a dessert. Overall i would definitely recommend this restaurant.

I was just about to come get you! Sorry about the wait. Here is your table.\\" Fine. I sat and asked her to retrieve my friends who were still outside. When it was apparent she had forgotten I went to get them. The waiter came. I explained our situation, he said he would see what he could do. This would be the last and only sentence he would utter. Food came. Calamari- great. Ravioli- great. Service- ha. After eating the waiter literally dropped the check on our table. When it was returned it was the wrong change and receipt. The manager came by to take away some dirty plates. I again explained, very nicely, the experience we had had and that no one had addressed it. He muttered something about a gift certificate and walked away, scowling. Did we see a gift certificate? No. \\n\\nApparently the cooks are the only people that know how to do anything right here, because the food was good. However, the wait staff and management were completely inept and even rude.

Impossible!! I checked again, yup I was wrong, I have indeed not penned any review of my top favorite restaurant. I still find it hard to believe, what am I thinking?? Totally unacceptable!\\n\\nNeed to set my record right, so here it goes..\\n\\nBistro Niko - a restaurant in Buckhead resembling a Parisian brasserie, a place with grand ceiling and French artwork, a restaurant with excellent food, great service and beautiful ambience (especially during the evening) and a place where I spent a lot of money *sob*. \\n\\nBistro Niko is my favorite restaurant not just cos it is located within walking distance from my home. I usually dine in here every other week. I have a few things in the items which I will normally order. They are (named in order of my favs)\\n1) Duck confit - my #1 fav, always crispy and tender. \\n2) Loup de Mer - sea bass, melted spinach with fingerling potatoes\\n3) Chicken Paillard -grilled and thinly pounded chicken breast\\n4) Saut√©ed Cape Cod Skate Wing - with brown butter, capers, potatoes \\n5) Maine Sea Scallops - when I wanted something light, served with pomme potatoes\\n6) Coq Au Vin - French Classic chicken in red wine, mushrooms, potatoes\\n7) Boeuf Bourguignon - \\"Kobe beef\\" cheeks braised in burgundy wine\\n8) Trout Meuni√®re - saut√©ed trout, brown butter, capers and pomme pur√©e \\n\\nCreme br√ªl√©e here is heavenly, it puts a smile on my face when I eat it. The profiteroles are very good too but I am biased due to my love with creme br√ªl√©e. \\n\\nMy latest visit was with a friend from Milan, Italy. He ordered the steak tartare with fries, and me the deux plats*. He really enjoyed his steak tartare (but I don't think he cared much about those fries) and said it was really good. He asked me to try but errrrr no, I don't really eat anything raw (do not stone me :( ). I asked him to try my duck confit instead, he simply loved it and said he would definitely order that next time. I find many people do not favor any duck dish and would shy away from this, but I say give it a try. The duck is not dry, very tender, flavorful and cooked to perfection. \\n\\n*Deux Plats - the menu has a section called \\"Les Formules\\" which offer deux plats or trois plats which one can order something from one of the hors d'oeuvres, entr√©e or desserts choices. So in my case, I chose the duck confit (entr√©e) with creme br√ªl√©e (desserts) which made up deux plats. Deux is French for two.\\n\\nWe both really enjoyed the meal and we shared the creme br√ªl√©e too. Yes, how generous I am since I usually love to have my creme br√ªl√©e all by myself, haha.. On a serious note, the madeleine that comes with the creme br√ªl√©e has not much buttery taste to it. I rather the restaurant not served the wonderful creme br√ªl√©e with this sad mediocre plain madeleine. The madeleine at Starbucks is much better. \\n\\nSo what else have I miss? Ambience is excellent and service is always great. I never have a bad service here though once two of the servers simply watched me fell from the booth. Thank you guys, for not trying to catch me but simply standing there. I bruised my knees quite badly that time. \\n\\nBistro Niko is definitely a place to go with friends or with a special someone. I highly recommend this place if you have not try it out yet.\\n\\nNote: Valet parking is not complimentary.

Since I haven't had to go through the reservation process, I can't really speak to it, but I believe you have to make reservations at least a month or so out, and they fill up within minutes of opening new reservation blocks.  If you are interested in trying this place out, I recommend doing some research on the best way to snag a reservation.\\n\\nThe menu changes frequently depending on what is in season, but there were a few items that were on the menu both times I visited.  The service was exceptional, with the waitstaff as well as the food runners knowing each detail of the dishes they were serving in order to explain as they delivered the dishes to our table.\\n\\nThe dishes are small to medium sized, and meant to be shared across the table.  They prefer you select all your dishes at once, as they plan the order in which you should have each of the selections.  The timing in which they bring the food is also spot on, allowing you ample time to enjoy each dish before they bring the next.\\n\\nHere are the items I have tried here (but again, they might not be on the menu when you dine here)\\n\\nOctober 1st, 2016:\\n-Grandma Lillian's potato bread - meh, it was ok, there wasn't anything special about this to me\\n-Chicken liver tart, scuppernongs, dill, corn nuts\\n-Shishito peppers, furikake - these were amazing!  unfortunately they were not on the menu the second time around\\n-Blue crab, sunflower, basil, lime, pea shoots - LOVED.  My favorite by far!\\n-Arugula, pistachio, sake bushi, green tomato - nice, fresh salad, on the smaller portion side\\n-Scallops, benne, bok choy, fermented shrimp broth, marigold\\n-White chocolate, peanut miso, olive oil - this was just ok (I enjoyed the dessert below better)\\n\\nNovember 12th, 2016:\\n-Beef, beets, matsutake, fish sauce, anise hyssop\\n-Blue crab, sunflower, lovage, lime, radish - AMAZING.\\n-Sunchokes, fennel, aji dulce, nasturtium\\n-Chestnut tortellini, apple, celery, pea shoots - great, a little rich but portion just right\\n-Persimmon, almond, milk, white chocolate - love this dessert, persimmons were interesting\\n\\nI HIGHLY recommend you start planning your trip to Staplehouse, whether for a special occasion or just to celebrate another amazing restaurant here in Atlanta!"},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I had a day off and decided to try this little cafe.

The second is their pricing--- you pay a lot but get a little, and the rice and naan are NOT included.

We also ordered a salad for $7.00 and found it far inferior to the tasty, free salad that comes with every lunch entree.  The lettuce was limp and brown and the portion was small.

Normally I don't mind a dull server because I know how hard their job can be, but this lady was downright rude. She expected us to know what we wanted to eat before she even took our drink order, and after we actually ordered it took over an hour to get our food because she admittedly forgot to put in the ticket. \\n\\nIf the service wasn't appalling enough, their food certainly did the job. The $25 scallops were frozen and my boyfriend's steak came out cold. I managed to choke down one of the chewy & slimy scallops before pushing my plate away because they were just too sad to eat.

There isn't a dish I have tried yet that I haven't loved. The salads are exceptional. They make a Caesar that will satisfy even the harshest of critics. If you like wood-fired pizza their offerings are delicious. From a traditional Margherita to the kids' favorite, pepperoni, it is pizza done right. Expect some uneven charring and \\"burned\\" spots on the crust because it is truly made in a wood-fired oven, not the chain rolling ovens.  They also have a convenient pizza bar at which you can sit to avoid any potential wait or for the experience of watching the pizzas being made in front of you. They even offer dough balls to the younger kids to play with while you are waiting. \\n\\nIf you are in the mood for a burger, BJ Willy's makes a great one!  You can choose from old favorites and new spins. The appetizers are great and so is the pasta. If you like fish tacos, and are picky like I am, you won't be disappointed. You can buy an entree with two or three and add on additional if you are super hungry.  I haven't had any drinks but the beer selection is good. They have Hoegaarden which is a nice wheat alternative for anyone who enjoys a Blue Moon with an orange (or not).\\n\\nAnyway, we love this place and are very happy that a restaurant with such a diverse menu and great food opened in this restaurant-starved area. One last note:  We have had Mandy as a server on several occasions and she has been nothing short of amazing.

If you're going to be an eatery or drinkery in a high-rent Mecca like the Domain or Triangle, then go with corporate backing and use their formulas for success. This is why you'll be there long after the local venture next door goes under. I'm not saying that's a good or bad thing, I'm just saying that's what is.\\n\\nSo yeah, if you come here expecting the charm and personality of the Draught House, then you really do need a beer. It's also different from Austin's own local chains, like Pour House and Hideout, which I think cater to that \\"Austin Vibe\\" thing. But I also think whatever entity is backing the Flying Saucer knows that you know that, but they're quite happy and willing to accommodate you in their world if you want it. And if you don't, there are lots and lots of people who do.  \\n\\nAm I coming off snarky here? That's not the case at all. I think The Flying Saucer is a great place - it's huge inside, it's bright, it has a great patio, and they're doing exactly what they set out to do: Be a cool and hip venue in a cool and hip environment. I'm not the one to ask if the beer and booze selections are somehow condescending to us local Austin purists, but everyone I was with here enjoyed the choices and had a great time.\\n\\nOne more thing: I actually didn't notice what our server Faith was wearing, which seems to be an issue in several reviews I just read, all I noticed was she had incredibly small and beautiful hands. She surprised me by comping my iced tea, and I surprised her with a large gratuity.

I'm not dissing I'm just saying.  \\n\\nI found the bar overcrowded and a lot of people clamboring for a seat cause I guess there wasn't as much mingling as there should be.  Overcrowding the bar has a tendency to suck up all the space there is for walking around any of the tables.  \\n\\nToo many tables for the space?  Or not enough space?  I think that if they got rid of half of the taps on the wall, they would have needed less room for a fridge, and they could have ended up with more room for seating.  If they wanted to be the popular new kid they should have accounted for as many friends as they were going to have hanging around.  To some this is no problem, personally I like to look around the room.  None of that here.  No one would have really missed the 30 taps and resultant space savings. The percentage of the bar that should be usable space as opposed to what percentage should be dedicated to a stockroom is really driving my opinion of the problems with this bar.\\n\\nI didn't feel like there was any way to get a true feel for the selection unless I was sitting at a booth and looking at the menu.

This place will get more stars from me when I can come in and sit down and try one of the beer trips.

The chef recommends that the quail egg be spread over the tartare and then mixed, it lended a sweet yet creamy taste to the dish. \\n\\nI tasted my friends crispy rice with tuna starter I forget what the name is but it was delicious, a little dense with the rice but I enjoyed the flavors. \\n\\nFor the main course we had a variety of sushi rolls most of which I've forgotten the names of, but the wait staff will definitely explain all of them to you and our waiter Hector explained the whole menu to us and had great recommendations as well.  I ordered the typhoon roll, because it was described as spicy and it was! \\n\\nThe typhoon roll incorporated tuna in the middle and was either topped with salmon or yellowtail alternatively.  The flavors were clean, neutral and spicy with some hits of sriracha.  I liked it but I'll definitely order something else next time. There was a sushi roll with tempura shrimp topped with eel sauce toward bottom right of the house rolls menu and that was pretty popular amongst our group. \\n\\nOverall great service, quality food and a nice atmosphere. I'd definitely recommend it as a treat or fun get together for special occasions."},{"name":"Grumpy Doyle's","address":"530 Main St","city":"Reading","stars":"3","text":"I've been to this bar twice, and both times I was extremely disappointed. The first time, I was carded twice by the same waitress, and the drinks are very over-priced and not as good as they seem in the menu. The second time, I was told there was a certain kind of beer, and when the waitress gave it to me, I discovered it was a different beer. I told the waitress it was not the kind I wanted, and she stood there defending it instead of asking right away if I wanted something else (like most waitresses do at other bars and restaurants). She gave me another beer with a smile, but later, on the bill I found out that I paid for the mix up. At every bar I have been to, if the server messes up, it's on the house.

I ended up getting a brownie Sunday with 2 different flavored ice cream. Coffee and mint chip ice cream surprisingly work really well together. The brownie was delicious and I could tell it was home made. All of the ingredients that went into the Sunday were fresh. I didn't feel like there was anything unauthentic about this place.

Terrible but the mustard seed saved and made it edible.  How do they screw up pork!!\\n\\nThe dressing on my wife's Arugula Salad was average at best.\\n\\nLast \\"Wee Ration\\" was Carrot Sticks + Yogurt Ranch - I love to snack on carrots but they screwed this up too.  There were 5 small carrot sticks on the plate and a watery flavorless yogurt sauce.  You know when you open a new yogurt and it has water on top?

My group of three ordered two hibachi meals and two sushi rolls. The hibachi was nothing special (just tons of soy sauce) though the chef was entertaining enough.  Our sushi never arrived (and I had to ask to get it removed from our bill). I was atually glad that it didn't because others in our party who ordered sushi received it at the same time that we all got our checks which was about 30 minutes after we had all finished the hibachi.

The first impression I had when I walked in the door was that the layout made the space seem much bigger than it seemed when occupied by the former Pizza Pie-er.  Its either pizza magic...or a really good interior designer with a strong sense of feng shui.  But I digress.\\n\\nI walked up to the front counter over which is a chalkboard listing their offerings - and unlike Pizza Pie-er - they have more than just pizza.  However, I was a woman on a mission and quickly focused on the pizza menu located on the wall next to the counter.  There were a ton of options, but I decided to go with a slice of the Garden Pesto pizza which had a pesto base and sliced tomatoes, garlic, mozzarella and feta cheese.  It was a great choice!  The slice was pretty large in size, and unlike many of the pizzas I've had in Boston (I'm from NY), I was able to fold and eat the pizza without an avalanche of grease or toppings falling into my mouth.  The ingredients tasted like they were of good quality and overall I would say this was one of the better slices I've had in a while.\\n\\nI was happy to be told that they take debit cards and there is no minimum to charge, but was a little surprised to see that my single slice was $3.75.  SHEESH!  I thought Whole Foods was a splurge for $2.99 a slice.  The gentleman behind the counter did suggest the special - $5.00 for two gourmet slices - but it wasn't until after I paid that I truly appreciated the bargain.\\n\\nIts nice to finally have a good pizza place in the area - we've been lacking for quite some time.  I'll definitely go back to Il Mondo and maybe try the Buffalo Chicken pizza everyone is raving about, but next time I'll get the two slice special so I feel less guilty about the price point."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Places like this is why Five Guys is growing like crazy.

When I went here a couple weeks ago, there were about 5-7 teams involved-- you're not supposed to have more than 6 per group, but they are not too strict about that.  \\n\\nThe real reason I am yelping about Smokey Bones, though, is for their Chicken Chili Nachos.  These were surprisingly tasty for a chain restaurant.  The platter consisted of fresh tortilla chips covered in chicken and beef chili, red and green onions, tomatoes, sour cream, salsa, lettuce, and cheddar-jack cheese.  The chip to topping proportion was a little off, but I always overload my chips anyway.  The chili tasted pretty good, and I loved all the diced veggies.  I was happy with the nachos, and it was even better that after 9pm, all appetizers are free!  Thus, are nachos were only $5 for a huge platter. Definitely worth it.

I went to Soundbites first because someone recommended it to me, but the service along with the overpriced food really turned me off. Then I decided to try the cafe' next door and I was just flabbergasted at how great everything went. Even as I was standing in a long line, the guy at the door told me I could go in and grab myself some coffee. And the coffee was great! Nice and bold, just the way I like it. Once inside, all the servers are just friendly and always smiling. One of  them in particular kind of reminds me of Ryan Reynolds, and I think he's the firendliest of the bunch. Love the art on the walls- it's like- a little taste of a french cafe' across the Atlantic.

The various tastes, the complexities, the richness, the smokiness, the silkiness, the heat - all words reasonably used to describe the various dishes.

The fact that a party of two can have half--dozen dishes and get out of there for around $40 is real Orlando magic.

After driving through rolling hills and luxe, verdant neighborhoods, we were taken aback by a low key setting.  Keep the faith ya'll...just beyond the free valet parking lies a gorgeously manicured riverfront setting with flawless service, backed by an excellent brunch offering.\\n\\nArriving at 10:30am on a Sunday (opening time), we were able to have our pick of tables and chose to sit outside.  We had a fantastic view of the river and gardens.\\n\\nOur waiter was charming, attentive and full of excellent recommendations.  We let ourselves be guided and soon found ourselves with quite a feast:\\n\\n1. Georgia Pecan Sticky Buns ($6): the love child of a perfect croissant and an exquisite pecan pie, these pastries are definitely the best way to kick off Sunday brunch at Canoe.  The buns are flaky and buttery, topped liberally with chopped pecans and then anointed with honeyed syrup.  Simply divine!\\n\\n2. She-crab Soup with Jumbo Lump Crabmeat and Cream Sherry ($9): served with ample sherry, our waiter did mention that some guests find this soup too rich and although I doubted than anything could be too rich for my taste, this actually was a bit too rich.  The cream portion is unabashed, but I did really enjoy the chunks of sweet, sweet crab.\\n\\n3. House Smoked Salmon on a Crispy Potato Pancake with Vermont Goat Cheese ($12): my advice to you if you want the best possible brunch at Canoe for 2 people would be to order the sticky buns and follow up with the large version of this dish.  Share both, and you'll be in perfect shape (read: fullness) to go on to conquer entrees.  Each bite of the salmon is perfectly balanced and nuanced with the smoked salmon balanced by the creamy goat cheese and crispy, creamy potato.\\n\\n4. Crab & Eggs ($18): a generous mound of lump crabmeat piled on top of soft scrambled eggs all over crispy diced potatoes, drizzled with hollandaise.  What's not to love?\\n\\n5. Steak & Eggs ($18): one of the day's special menu items.  Exactly the same as the Crab and Eggs but with thinly sliced steak instead of crab.  The crab reigned supreme, but this was still tasty.\\n\\nIf you wind up extremely full (like we did), diners are always welcome to enjoy the grounds and take a respite in the ample chairs by the river after settling up.\\n\\nPARTING THOUGHT: If you are one to favor brunch cocktails over views, you might want to make a reservation for later in the day.

Especially in the Spring and Summer.\\n\\nI dropped by last night for dinner and was thrilled with the delightful cilantro vinaigrette dressing and the little brick of joy that is their grits/cheese/pepper thing.  Best of all, their reasonably priced seared tuna was the second best I have had in Atlanta.  (The best was at Paul's, right across the street.)  This tuna was nicely seared, raw in the middle, and had a spicy rub on the outside and no extra salt!  (See my review of Blue Point for salty seared tuna.)  I ate most of the food they handed me, and walked away feeling healthy and satisfied without the bloat and regret that too often accompanies restaurant dinners.\\n\\nThe deck bears special mention.  It really does make this place.  The inside is small and intimate, with booths downstairs and small tables upstairs.  The outside, though, is an expansive porch smattered with the usual kaki-clad Buckhead debris.  They are a fine group, as a whole (hey - I live in Buckhead!  Don't knock it!), but since I was on my motorcycle and way-way-NOT-kaki-clad (see, Marvin the Martian) I elected to ruffle fewer feathers by sitting at a small interior table.\\n\\nSpeaking of feathers, there are birdhouses all over the interior.  I think there is some sort of connection between the birdhouse theme and the Treehouse name.  Not sure what it is, though.  Maybe the Treehouse is like a big birdhouse, but for people?  Maybe because all the pink and baby-blue oxfords on the porch could be mistaken for an aviary of you squint your eyes?\\n\\nThe full bar is nice, and the staff are friendly and gregarious.

We were quite surprised about the options as we didn't consider them to be quite French. Aside from the creme brulee. I still ordered from the menu and got the ceasar, short ribs, and creme brulee. The main part of the salad was OK, but the croutons were delicious. I wonder if they made them in house. Tasted so fresh. The short ribs were like pot roast really. Is that typical? I don't order short ribs. They were so very tender which was nice. Came with green beans, mashed potatoes, and carrots. The sides were a bit underwhelming when it came to flavor and the veggies looked quite boring. But I love how the meat was plated on the mashed potatoes. The creme brulee was a white peach version of this classic dish. I asked in advance if it would be strong or mild, and the waitress told me mild. It was so mild, in fact, that I tasted no peach whatsoever. But I thought it was well executed and quite tasty. Overall, a pretty good meal for less than $30. I had plenty leftover for another day.\\n\\nMy friend ordered escargot, Beef Wellington, and baked Alaska. I tried the latter two items, neither of which I had tried before.

HORRIBLE HOSTESS EXPERIENCE. Great waiter and food. Had a party of 5 with 3 dogs. \\n\\nSERVICE -\\nMy siblings and I wanted to grab a bite here with our 3 dogs. One of us went inside real quick to check if it was okay to have our dogs come eat with us outside. The hostess was incredibly rude and told us there was a 45 minute wait, even though there were a crapload of free tables outside. We talked about it for a bit then finally decided we would like to be put on the \\"waitlist\\". We went up to hostess and told her. Literally one of the staff who was right next to her looks at us confused and says \\"there's no waitlist\\". She quickly says she'll seat us to save her butt. That was just highly unprofessional and left a horrible taste. Like I said, this happened around 12pm on Saturday, May 27. \\n\\nWhat really saved me from hating this place was the excellent waiter we had. He was incredibly friendly and gave awesome suggestions. For example, he gave advice on a beer we were about to order and in the end we ended choosing what he suggested. Can't remember what it was but it was REALLY awesome. He also made great suggestions for sides and was just an overall great waiter. \\n\\nFOOD - \\nWe ordered two large poutines, which is basically fries covered with gravy and cheese. Could use a little bit more seasoning but overall it was great. Definitely recommend one for a group (3-4). I recommend Smokey & the Boar! The Duck, Bacon & Fig and the Dak Bulgogi were pretty good too. I didn't order a beer, but I do recommend ordering one. The food was a decent size. \\n\\nATMOSPHERE - \\nDefinitely casual. There's a pen for your dogs, but you must watch them if they go in. They also provide water for your dogs, which was great. It's pretty hot if you sit outside so try to get a seat under the giant fan, which is more towards the middle section. \\n\\nI don't normally talk about this but the bathroom was cool looking. It's just the soap was like a powder substance, which was confusing but I think you have to \\"activate\\" it using water or something. \\n\\nFINAL NOTE - \\nI would come here again, but occasionally if I wanted to have a casual night with a group of friends. It's pretty pricey. The food was good but it wasn't the best thing I ever had. You don't really get a lot for what you pay for. The waiter was great.

Their menu changes seasonally so you always have something new to look forward to. I also love that they try to incorporate as much local food as possible. They have a full bar as well as a great wine list to accompany your meal. I most recently went here for Valentine's Day with my boyfriend as I find it a great place for a nice romantic meal. As to be expected on Valentine's we had a short wait even though we had reservations but we each ordered drinks at the bar (which were great!) and soon enough our name was called. We were lucky enough to get one of the booths in the back of the restaurant and had an excellent meal. We ordered the Steamed PEI Mussels that is currently on their menu with the Chardonnay Cream sauce and I have to say that these were the best mussels I have ever had. The sauce was SO GOOD that after the mussels were gone my boyfriend and I ate the rest of the sauce with our bread because it was so tastey. I had the Pan-Roasted Mahi for my entree which was delicious and he had the Rabbit Roulade. He wasn't as crazy about his dish, he didn't care for the Kraut on the dish, but I tasted his and thought it was enjoyable.

We're talking -25 degree F with windchill. I and my friends had just finished partying the night before for one's birthday and were hungry for brunch. We messed up with the address to the Thai place so we ended up here as it was unbearable to walk anymore in those atrociously cold winds. \\n\\nI was very skeptical that this place would be any good from the onset, as ethnic restaurants that are not expensive but yet occupy prime real-estate usually aren't. Tricks I learnt from Tyler Cowen.\\n\\nAnyway, so we order a bunch of things like fried rice, some beef stir fry, kung pao chicken and some crab rangoons and dumplings for appetizers\\n\\nThe first thing I tasted was rancid vegetable oil soaking everything - drowning the crisp-less vegetables. The meat had its flavor completely drained out by overcooking in this nasty oil. The wontons (rangoons) similarly mostly tasted of the vegetable oil. The after-taste of every bite of my chicken/beef dishes was the unmistakable clinging of MSG. So I tried to stick to the fried rice instead which was not so bad. It was at least edible though any Chinese family could probably do make one better at home. \\n\\nI love ethnic food - especially Asian food (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai). But I would pay to avoid eating here. This is my first review on Yelp even though I've been a member for a couple years as I'm lazy. But I could NOT let these ridiculous positive reviews stay. Yes the staff is friendly. The main server was even funny and charming. But that is no substitute for edible food. The food here was absolutely atrocious.

The breakfast tacos are good too; the first time I order soyrizo I had to question if it was really vegetarian or was chorizo mistakenly given. The daily chalkboard specials are excellent too. Arriving after 9am expect a wait, but they have an area for self serve coffee so you can chill and wake up, then take to the table for refills plus it can then be added to your tab. \\n\\nThis is a family owned biz with a cafe artful atmosphere and the only downside these days is that \\"Grandma\\" is no longer a staple behind the checkout counter and grandson Phillip is all grow up living his life, but we sometimes spot his dad conversing with customers and the staff is always friendly and helpful.

My only iffy with Hawkers is the amount of oil they cook their food with. It definitely is a place to go when you're looking to spend some major calories.

We didn't eat, so my opinion is based solely on drinks, atmosphere and service.\\n\\nThere are some fantastic decor elements here from the beautiful hand-carved tikis to the amazing hand-made light fixtures, that I wouldn't have been surprised to see in a serious tiki establishment on the West Coast.  Some truly great artwork in this place that is worth seeing if you are a tikiphile, so stop in if you love the art.\\n\\nOverall the atmosphere was ok.  A little too dark for my taste and not great for large groups, but also not terrible.  Unfortunately the music was awful and inappropriate for the theme of the bar, which really detracted from the overall ambiance for me.  But that's an easy fix, and it could have just been the night we were there (a Friday).\\n\\nThe service was solidly mediocre.  Simple things like no greeter at the door, having to ask for water twice before it materialized, and V E R Y long waits for our cocktails even though they were individually mixed from scratch (which should take longer but not this long, especially since they weren't that busy).  And a not-too-friendly waiter didn't help the situation. Honestly, the place lacks the Aloha Spirit.\\n\\nAs for the libations, again, they were ok.  Not bad but not great. The Tikiphile Mai Tai was certainly not a traditional (read Trader Vic's) mai tai, but it was passable for the genre.  I thought the grog was good - well balanced and appropriately tart - a very nice cocktail, indeed but nothing outstanding.  The \\"Tiki Chic\\" menu was a little too chic for this chick, but might appeal to those with a sweet tooth.  Wish I'd had the time to try the Spicy Dark and Stormy (made with Kraken) which sounded quite appealing, and the Zombie, which has gotten some good reviews.  Alas, we were being responsible adults and stopped at two!\\n\\nOverall, I'd give it a C with a note that it has great potential if it just applies itself a little bit."},{"name":"Passport Sips & Tapas","address":"59 Washington St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4","text":"Checked this place out with a friend for the first time last week on a Wednesday. The place is small and it does get busy, but at the time we arrived at 6.30pm there was no problem with seating. The front part of the restaurant has a couple of tables and the bar area, and to the back of that are the tables for dining. Pretty chic yet casual for the South Shore, it wouldn't be out of place in the Back Bay but the pricing is very reasonable.\\n\\nWe were quickly seated and given menus and our waiter (Rob) was very good about explaining the concept of the restaurant - he called it \\"international sharing plates\\". For those of you who know what tapas are this is basically what it is - small plates ranging from $3 to $12 that you share and pick from, but instead of just Spanish the menu has a global influence. You can get larger plates that would be entree size if you decided you wanted that too (paella or peruvian marinated beef to name a couple).\\n\\nWe wanted to try as many things as we could so we ordered a bunch of smaller plates. We had fried octopus, scallops and bacon, mac and cheese with corn and bacon, oven roasted olives (no seeds), Jamaican pork and short rib bolognaise. The octopus was a little drowned in tomato sauce but everything else was excellent. For two people seven sharing plates was plenty. Bill came up to about $80 for two, including a carafe of sangria sangria. The service was excellent!\\n\\nParking is fine on weekdays but during weekend nights I'm sure it gets crowded. They are only open 4-10pm and have a no reservation policy which is understandable given the size of the restaurant, but I couldn't give them five stars because of it. Just come early or come during the week if you can, it's definitely worth it.\\n\\nDefinitely a great find in the area which unfortunately has a dearth of tapas-style cuisine.

I think its nice when the staff is relaxed and they want to be there. \\n\\nA note about the kids menu: my kids are a little older (9, 11) so some kids menus don't serve enough food to fill them up. NXNW kids dishes serve large portions. So if you have more than one kid with you, you might have them check to see if there is something they would be willing to share. On the other hand, if your kiddos are in sports and had early games/ practice then they might be ravenous. In that case, it's a good size meal! \\n\\nWish us luck when we go back to visit our southern Illinois relatives.

The meatballs were a blend of 3 meats... I'm not sure which ones, but since I don't discriminate, it is a moot point.

I told the manager about the mistake and he came back after and told me his gm said the ticket had been put in at 320 and it was only 5 minutes. They ended up giving me 28 cents off and charged me for everything.

Unfortunately I was ultimately disappointed, sad to say.  The service was extremely erratic.  We ordered quickly from a friendly server, and we're quickly served the complimentary bread and butter and our drinks, with meal quick to follow.  I was so bummed out to receive my fettuccine alfredo - my FAVORITE dish - cold on it's plate.  I should have sent it back, but I was literally about to pass out from lack of food, so ate it I did.  Of course our server (previously attentive and polite) was absolutely nowhere to be found at this time.  So I ate my cold, flavorless pasta...NO grating of the parmesan cheese - a must - was ever offered, so seriously annoying I will never get over it.  My husband had to go steal some salt and pepper off another table so I could dress it up a little bit.  Wasn't so terrible, but really, this is a restaurant and serving cold food is just a huge, unforgivable mistake.  I will say that my husband was pleased with his dish...some delicious-looking cheesy baked thing (tortillini, maybe?) and his dish was not flavorless and not cold, he was very pleased with his meal, but of course you need to get both plates on the table with the food hot to receive a decent review from me.  \\n\\nIf you've got high expectations for your fettuccine alfredo, do yourself a favor and go to the Olive Garden.  Sure, it's a chain restaurant.  But they do make their pasta fresh (as does Vinito's) and it's served with a lot more flavor and decent service.  No lack of parmesan cheese grating!  Of course Vinito does offer alfresco dining, which is always nice in FL, owing to our beautiful weather, and like I said, the outside of the place is very appealing, a nice atmosphere that draws you in.  Too bad that they could not follow up with food that was adequately prepared: first rule, serve it hot!    \\n\\nI would actually give them another chance though (since my husband was so pleased with his).  Next time, though, I won't be perishing from hunger, I will be prepared to send it back if they serve me another plate of cold pasta.  Also next time I'll get my server's cell phone number, just in case he wanders off, or quits, or whatever happened to him.  Never saw him again after we ordered!  A different person served the food, and a different person had to issue our check, after we managed to get his attention and ask for it.  I guess we could have just left, I don't think anyone would have noticed.  \\n\\nGo, but be assertive, and make sure you've got everything you need before they pull their vanishing act.  Or maybe just go to another place altogether, hey?

The pizza was good, not bad and not great, but I really enjoyed the salad. The dressing was good, I think I want to try to make something like it myself. Prices seemed totally reasonable.

My.  Gosh.\\n\\nThis place served the best vegan dessert I've ever had (save, perhaps, my own secret recipe coconut pie), and the other available options looked delicious, too.  I got a vegan raspberry-chocolate mousse cake, and it was absolutely divine - not overly sugary or with a margarine-y taste like some other desserts.  It was light, perfect, and delicious - as well as being generously sized.  There were about five or six other vegan options, in their own case, along with an even larger case of non-vegan desserts.\\n\\nThe only downside for a vegan is that there was only one completely vegan sandwich (although it may have been possible to alter the veggie cheeseburger to make it vegan - I didn't ask):  a hummus and veggie sandwich called Eat Your Veggies.  It was good, though, and served on the kind of good, fresh bread you'd expect at a high-quality bakery.

The Decoy features a Chinese menu, as it is indeed Asian folks in the kitchen.  I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken.  This came on a generous platter.  The chicken, onions, and green pepper were tender.  Where it lacked was the sauce as it was rather bland.  At $9.95 the price of the dish was right in the ballpark, while the steak ran around $15.

A limited menu means that they can do everything right. Like REALLY right. Plus, since it's modeled after an olde timey speakeasy, drinks remain the focus.

Attention to detail in the ingredients and subtleties of flavor mean that your drink won't slide out to you seconds after ordering it, but when things are muddled, shaken and stirred, you feel transported back in time. Eighteenth Amendment be damned. The names of the drinks skirt gimmickry and match the theme in a literary way. A nice touch.\\n\\nFood: Saying the menu is simple is doing injustice to the flavors. Make no mistake this is a foodie haven, with reimaginings of well known foods in proper, non-American portions means that you can save some money on food and spend it on drink and not go away feeling like a blimp. The comforting chicken and dumplings were perfect to me and had a depth of flavor that, face it, chicken and dumplings really shouldn't be able to attain. My wife's root salad caused our conversation to stop for about ten minutes thanks to oohs and aahs.\\n\\nShare the lemon chess pie. If you don't you are missing out on one of the top 5 desserts i have ever had in my mouth.

This is a friendly professional place where they care about matching your experience with what you want. Good recommendations are heartfelt and they don't try to hurry you or push you in a particular direction. Service is prompt and frequent without dominating your experience by interruptions.\\n\\nDecor: this is one of the best put together places I've ever been. Remember when i said time travel? This has it in spades, with the thankful exception of the roaring 20s cigarette haze. From the chandeliers to the lightbulbs to the bricks in the wall, this feels ripped right out of last century and plopped right down in one perfect package that, while newish, feels warm and accepting and lived in...even the music and bathrooms seem to match the general vision for HHS. Lighting is on the low side, but not enough to pale your skin and widen your pupils. The decor is just perfect, with enough modernity to not be stale or touristy.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and hit up this watering hole with a small group of friends. Whether you are there just for an interesting drink or for a more social experience, you will be glad you went a bit out of your way for the unique ambiance, food and beverages.

The bread used was not a Torta it was more like a hamburger bun. The under seasoned pork was so over cooked a small child would have chipped their tooth. The broth had good flavor but was too spicy, but bearable. Chef, if you read this take a flight to Guadalajara. Go to Penguinos Torta Ahogada and learn what a proper Torta Ahogada tastes likes. \\n\\nSide dish \\n-----------\\nRoasted potatoes - over cooked and under seasoned. Would it be so hard to throw some salt on the potatoes? Some pieces we could not stick a fork in it. Not because it was under cooked but because they roasted all of the water out of it. \\n\\nCondiments\\n-------------\\nHomemade ketchup - Not what I was expecting, it was more like a tomato salsa rather than a vinegary tomato pur√©e.  \\n\\nHomemade mayo - It was okay. \\n\\nThe chef, if they even have one, is under par.

The good thing was that  on a Saturday night we didn't have to wait, and for a table of 6, we got to choose indoor or outdoor seating. But they give you a complimentary plate of pimento cheese with 4 flatbeds crackers. They claim on their menu that you cant get enough of this so you can order it as an appetizer yet for a table of 6, they can't even bring enough to have everyone try it.  The quail appetizer was good but not worth the $13 it cost. The queso was tasty but such a small portion for the large basket of chips they bring with it. \\nI had the Bacardi limon mojito which was delicious but not Worth $7 a pop!\\nNow for the part I'm not a hundred percent sure how to review... We had a large group. When the bill came the waitress explained that the tip was not included in the check. As the bill was passed along a few of our party automatically included tip so the last person unknowingly just said \\"put the rest on my tab\\" and then they tipped a little at the end. This left our waitress with a 10% tip. Now i must reiterate that i never leave anything less than a 15% tip and it was a complete and total mistake.  We paid our check and got the receipts back and about 15 minutes passed while we just sat and talked at the table. \\nThen the manager comes up and asks how we enjoyed the meal.  We say it was very enjoyable. And then he explains that he asks because we didn't tip our waitress well and he hated doing this to us but he wanted to make sure the service wasn't so bad that we just didn't tip like decent human beings. Of course we were mortified and figured out what the issue was. Then we asked for the check back, left a note for the waitress and tipped her well over 20%.  A part of me commends that manager for sticking up for his employee. But the other part of me is still in shock that this all even happened.

They also make great sweet potato fries; I was shocked by how good they were, but they come with a weird sauce - honey mustard maybe? \\n\\nI also like their wings which in my opinion are not jumbo, but are well cooked and the All-American hot sauce is right on with taste.  It's hot though, so be warned. The lemon pepper wings were bland, so maybe they didn't use enough spice. Please note that I paid 7.95 for six wings. SIX WINGS.  Yeah, I felt robbed.  Real bad. I guess by calling an average sized wing \\"jumbo\\" they believe they can justify this price, but I disagree and won't be ordering these again unless it's \\"wing night.\\" \\n\\nService here has run from horrible to awesome.

I don't remember the dish names, but one was chicken with garbanzos and the other was chicken with turkish spices and citrus (and came with zuccini and squash slices). The chicken with garbanzos was bland. The other chicken dish was barely edible. The combination of flavors was just off in left field somewhere. We ate a few bites and tried to deal with a bad menu selection on our part, but then it was making my belly rumble and I started having fears of food poisoning...  We did not eat very much of this dish.\\n\\nOn the plus side - when we were mostly done the waitress came by and asked if we needed a box and we confessed that the second chicken dish was Not Good. She said we should have said something earlier and she could have replaced the dish with something else. We were actually unsure if this qualified as \\"our problem\\" since we didn't like the dish - or if it was something where we could send it back (which I've never done).\\n\\nEnd result - the waitress took the second entree off our bill - without us even asking. Bonus points for customer service on the part of this waitress. However, next visit I'm gonna stick with the Shwarma.\\n\\nA couple of other notes:\\n- The Labne dip appetizer is a bit of a rip off. For $3.50 they give you a plate of Labne Yogurt with some lemon and chives on top. Nothing special here. Mostly just greek style yogurt.\\n\\n- These guys do have tasty hummus.\\n\\n- They appear to get pita bread from Phoenicia Bakery & Deli. I find this pita to be too thin and chewy for my tastes.

So it's nothing fancy, cafeteria style, not the best Korean food but is sure the best bang for your bucks\\n\\nYou get multi grain rice (taste delish), meat (the pork bulgogi has a lot) or soup if you order one, a miso soup and 2-3 small portions of banchan (side dishes) if you go later in the evening your option might be limited. I also saw that they have a $6.99 lunch special with 2 choices of entrees. I'll check it out later. \\n\\nIf it's your first time I recommend the pork bulgogi. It's their most popular item and my fav so far (grab a Gongcha boba tea too to appreciate yourself yo) the spicy tofu soup and yuk gae jang arent bad but as expected, you wont find much seafood (it's $8 pls) but the hot soup is nice on a cold day\\n\\nI tried the stir fried squid, pretty good but not a lot of squid (again, as expected) and kimchi pork which the pork tasted not hot to me when i first ordered it. There were more kimchi and tofu than pork and it seems like the pork are cooked separately then stir fry with the rest when you order it. Hence, it's not that hot, but it was no way bad. In Hindsight, I should have sent it back but I was hungry and they are always nice so I dont care much. You might be luckier than me if you order it next time, who knows lol\\n\\nThey also have a stamp card, if you get 10 stamps the 11th meal is free! This place is def a healthier choice on campus.

Apparently this establishment does not have the capability to split checks which became a huge debacle. The manager took over for our obviously ill equipped server to deal with the checks. Upon leaving i engaged the manager to make him aware of the terrible service we had received, but he casually brushed it off as if it was no big deal. I suppose a $1000 check isn't very concerning.

It's a shame as I love seafood. Yet I rarely go for it here, as many treks to the beaches have spoiled me. \\nBut when a place fills an interesting niche as Alegria does it raises my interest; Mexican seafood is certainly a novel cuisine, one that is patently obvious when you think of it. \\n\\nOnce anchored on Perimeter Loop in Dublin, Alegrie is now docked in Carriage Place, Bethel among the sea of ethnic fare in the area. It is next to the movie theatre. It was my native voyage there and seemed from the outside to be a typical strip mall quick stop. It is actually more than that. Themed with colorful cartoon plaques hung in front of baby blue lagoon paint and matching chairs, the small space is consistent with the causal-fast food model embarked by Chipotle. Yet it has a bar that serves drafts, mix drinks and tequilas, putting it more in line with a 'spend some time' causal place. \\n\\nI ordered the Fileta Ralleno, a fish fillet stuffed with shrimp, octopus, scallop, crab, and clam meat with vegetables under a mushroom cream. It came with a side of Mexican style fries, and a choice of garlic bread. Served on a white flat place the meals here come in artistic placement.  This dish was very good. The different tastes of the various seafood complimented each other well under the sauce, and gave each bite a diversity, a slightly or drastic different taste from the last. All of them were a pleasant surprise to my tongue and satisfied my seafood craving. Yes it still wasn't as fresh as say Miami or Nagshead but it was superb for C-town. \\n\\nThe bar has Mexican beer on tap. I came during Happy Hour and had a draft Dos XX lager for  1/2 off. They also had Pacifico, Modelo, and Corona Light on tap. Margaritas here look promising, though I didn't partake.   \\n\\nMy four star rating is bordering on 5. Some negatives: the staff was very friendly and helpful, they have a great attitude, but they are still warming up to the processes. I saw a little confusion, although it did not effect my experience at all and it will probably work itself out as they gain more experience or feel for their new surroundings. Kinks are expected. The space can get cramped, although they do have a small patio for extra room. The bar, I felt, was too cramped and gave little space for food and beer. But there is no fatal negs and the staff is hard working.\\n\\nAll in all I loved the place. Note: this is no cheap taco place; my dinner was $15.99 which I think is about right for the quality and quantity of the meal. Add the happy hour Dos XX  (three 16-ounces) with tip and I spent $30. So this is a date, experience, or quality food kind of place.

The atmosphere is very pleasant, and when my wife and I eat here on Sunday evenings we are typically the only people in the restaurant.  I suspect this is because it's a little out of the way and somewhat difficult to find.

I am larger than the average person, but it was still tight for most. The server was nice to begin with.  Now they advertise as going around Asia and serving the best hawker dishes there are.

After that you go for the Laksa....\\n\\nWe ordered the Roti Canai, Hawker Fries, Summer Rolls, Char Kway Teo, and the Curry Laksa. The Roti was excellent, some of the best I have had and the curry dipping sauce was a nice touch. The Fries were good, although nothing spectacular. Summer rolls were decent, but for some reason were quite sticky and fell apart while dipping in the peanut sauce. Much better ones can be had at a number of Vietnamese joints in town. Char Kway Teo was good, but it isn't a hard dish to make. Now on to the Laksa, which was a huge disappointment.  The first negative aspect that I noticed was that the base was very watery, and not sort of thick as it was in other restaurants. Then I tasted the soup, and it was extremely bland with very little hint of spice. A huge disappointment. Oh well, there's always NYC and Cali.\\n\\nMy last impression of the restaurant was the worst one. It was most likely an isolated event with our waitress and it probably won't stop us from visiting the restaurant again. We sat with dirty empty plates(minus the half full Laksa) on our table with empty water cups for a long time, trying to make eye contact with our waitress so she can bring us the check. We finally did get her attention and asked for the check. She headed back for a little bit, and then returned.....to take the order from the table next to us.

And since the main event is The Classic Bowl of Chili, I reckon that this is a good characteristic.  No one ever wanted to set back in a sunlit room chomping on the spicy beast that is Texas Chili.\\n\\nAnd yes, the chili is a fine representation.  As mentioned in other reviews, some of the beans have chili.  Yes, I said that correctly.\\n\\nThe most notable favorite was the Habanero, which they tout as HOT HOT HOT, and I retort with KINDA KINDA KINDA.  If you are a level 4 chili eater like myself, then its *just* the right amount of heat without being stupidly, palate-wrecking overboard.  Good stuff.\\n\\nTheir most popular, as it proclaims on the menu, is the \\"Spicy Chili\\", which is devoid of beans and appears to feature brisket as the protein.  Tasty, but thick.  A sampler bowl is really all that is required.\\n\\nI'm shocked -- SHOCKED -- that the Chili Parlor does not serve cornbread.  This is a situation that could have been remedied over and over and over again.  See, chili tends to become a bit monotonous after several mouthfuls, and the palate would REALLY fucking enjoy some skillet baked cornmeal sweetness.  Dunno, thats just the way I was raised.\\n\\nOverall, a shockingly pleasant experience as icons like these tend to  burn out and fade away."},{"name":"Tinos Greek Cafe","address":"9828 Great Hills Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Pretty good food, family really liked the gyro meat and I loved the chicken.

And yet, The Decoy pulls it off. Burgers? good. Pizza? VERY good. Tacos (on Tuesday)? solid. Chinese? Comfort food!! It's a neighborhood place at its core.\\n\\nThis is a family-run place. You'll find the owner behind the grill, jumping from american pub food to chinese to pizza without missing a beat.  And his wife handles sous chef duties. The hired staff run the gamut from exemplary to tolerable-but-testy from time to time... just like you'd expect at any small, independent, family-run business, in any small town, anywhere. \\n\\nThe Linnton neighborhood residents call The Decoy \\"Linnton's Living Room\\" and that is exactly the ambiance you're going to get.

Our bartender was EXTREMELY knowledgeable and friendly, taking a lot of time to educate us about the different types of cocktails. He expertly listened to my likes and made me an off-the-menu cocktail that was exactly what I wanted. He made my boyfriend (a Sazarac afficionado) a perfect Sazarac. We tried the deviled eggs with Parmesan and bacon, the grilled cheese with hazelnut, and the BLT, all of which were very tasty and freshly prepared.\\n\\nThe bar area is large and comfortable, and although I would prefer to sit there and watch the bartenders at work, there is also a cozy little room with a private bar (perfect for a birthday party), as well as outdoor space.\\n\\nI'm from Manhattan and I frequent cocktail places all the time, and this one definitely blew its Boston competitors out of the water.

However, the ambiance was strange, maybe because the tables were placed too close to each other.  We had to whisper to each other to keep our conversation private. We could smell the dish on the next table. I am 5'3, 110lb and could barely squeeze myself between the tables , I felt my butt hanging over someone's plate as I was trying to sit. Our waitress whose arms were filled with tattoos was polite enough but not friendly at all. The whole place felt cold. None of the waiters smiled. \\nThe menu was very limited and so overpriced we almost walked out. My egg Benedict: eggs over a biscuit with bacon and collard greens, was extremely salted.

The meat was tender, not too \\"lamby\\" and the bread was a perfect compliment. The fries were good.  I had the trout meuniere.  I was sauteed in butter with the skin on.  The skin had a crispy buttery crunch, while the filet inside was tender and flavorful.  It came with green beans and capers and mashed potatoes that were creamy and buttery without being too oily. Portion sizes were appropriate for the price.  Yes, I do like butter.\\n\\nService by Carlos was prompt and helpful.

Even if you're not apt to live it up on the sabbath, this place is a hoot any given time of week. \\n\\nWhat makes Sunday exceptional at Banger's is the live music (and subsequent conga dance lines), the infamous Manmosas, and the effusive energy. Not a time has gone by at this joint where I haven't made friends with the strangers seated on either side of me; this is what makes Austin so unparalleled by any other U.S. city - the ability to mingle at ease and meet awesome people, even if the length of your newfound friendship doesn't surpass the setting sun. And Banger's, well, it's the prime watering hole for bringing all types together (including those of the furry variety - they have a great dog play area in back).\\n\\nThey have a pretty impressive beer selection, and the sausages and sides are great. Personally, I'm a fan of the campy Manmosa - a bottle of champagne topped off with a dash of orange juice for good measure. This place is the Texas version of a Biergarten; casual, lively and a guaranteed good time. Fair warning - this place gets packed when the weather is good, so try to show up early and get over your notion of personal space. Also, if you're the type to get, err, a bit of a sailor's mouth while boozing it up, know that this place frequently has families among its picnic table ranks.\\n\\nAlthough I abhor the idea of this place's wait time further increasing, I definitely recommend adding Banger's to the list of places to take your visiting out-of-towners.
