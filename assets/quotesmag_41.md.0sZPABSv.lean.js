Tons of dipping sauces for your food that isn't easily found at other fast food joints (Garlic, Zulu, Pink, Pineapple, and Chipotle). Try them all as they're all really good.\\n\\nWhat I recommend to eat!\\nGet the chicken burger! This is what I knew them for in their food truck days. It's pretty unique since it has chips, and an assortment of the sauces I listed above, dressed with lettuce and cheese. It's pretty solid overall! I would say the sauces is what sets this burger a part from others!\\n\\nWhat I recommend to drink! \\nThey carry Guarana, which is a delicious Brazilian drink.  Slightly resembles ginger ale. Not to be outdone since it's called Colombian burger they also have Colombiana. It's kind of like Coke, but not! Both are going to quench and satisfy your thirst with a touch of culture.\\n\\nDownsides!\\nPlace is kind of small inside, not a lot of place to sit. There's two tables outside. Stool seating along the hall, and I think two tables at the end of the hall. Don't plan to sit too comfortably.\\nIt can get extremely crowded, with a pretty long line, and lengthy wait for food. Luckily they have a pager system to let you know when your food is up. (Side note, the pager is cool and announces a message in Spanish. Go there to find out what it says haha.)\\nThe meat quality for both chicken and beef is not too bad, but hey! It's fast food."},{"name":"The Storm Crow Tavern","address":"1305 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"It's about bloody time! i bar that caters to NERDS! an absolutely brilliant idea.

Those guys must break a lot of snowmobiles learning to do tricks like that.\\n\\nFood prices were surprisingly reasonable, which might have helped explain the big crowd on a Thursday night.  Once delivered, the food measured up to expectations, and then some.  I had elected to order steak, feeling gunshy after a previous, unpleasent experience with chilli at another restaurant.  My steak was fully satisfactory.  Yum.  In fact, I just finished easting the leftovers for breakfast.  Good stuff, and the cold morning light revealed no unpleasent surprises - just 1/2 of an honest, juicy steak.\\n\\nMy wife ordered chilli as a side to her Asian chicken wrap.  Nervously, I sampled a small taste.  Say!  Not bad!  When she left the table for a moment, I downed the rest.\\n\\nThe staff were friendly, the food was good, and the price was right.

However, we were disgusted by the waiter. We were sitting outside (a party of five) and the two children with us had salads. They couldn't eat the salads because bugs were flying in them. When the waiter saw the unfinished salads (barely eaten to be more accurate) and asked the children's mother if they wanted to take them home, she told him they couldn't because they were full of bugs. Instead of doing anything about it or even expressing any empathy, he just said, \\"Yeah, that's Florida in the summer.\\" VERY off-putting.

One thing that I wish I had done differently, though, would be to order them \\"Hot\\", instead of \\"Medium\\" (my default for a new place, where I don't know their levels of spice). The Medium was pretty mild, in my estimation.\\n\\nAnother thing I can recommend is the queso/chips. While the salsa is not worth messing with, the queso is pretty friggin' good. It's more white cheese than yellow (which I'm used to in TX), and it wasn't very spicy (depite a few large jalapeno slices in it), but it had a very nice flavor to it.

I was originally told that dinner here would cost two dining credits on the Disney Dining Plan, but since it would include appetizer, entree, and desert, it would still be a reasonable choice. We were celebrating a birthday, so I decided...what the heck? Well, as it turned out, OUR standard dining plan was only good for an entree and desert! Grumble, grumble.\\n\\nI should have known we were in for a rocky experience by the snotty answer given to me by the \\"gatekeeper\\" (what's her job anyways?...you still need to go up the ramp to the host/hostess stand) in response to my question of whether wine was included with the meal...well, in the words of Steve Martin, WELL EXCUSE ME!!! This was our first meal on this plan, and considering the cost, I thought it was a reasonable question. And you know what, I never ran into that kind of attitude at the French Laundry or Per Se...and there were no shorts or flip flops at those places either!\\n\\nIn any case, the decor was not particularly memorable...outside the whole exposed timber lodge look, the pastels reminded me of my grandfather's nursing home from the 80's. As a signature restaurant, I expected some degree of sticker shock. But the way the waiter scanned our bands and haughtily informed us we were only entitled to an entree and desert really rubbed me the wrong way. \\n\\nIn any case, the food was certainly not up to par with the price. No amuse bouche... I had a crab cake appetizer (I paid extra for this) consisting of a single thin disk of crab 2.5 inches across which was scorched on the outside, sitting on some sort of orange sauce with a single pickled pepper stuffed with some other orange stuff. If I were to guess, I'd say the sauce was some sort of overly thick remoulade, and the stuffing perhaps a pimento cheese...but I cant be sure. In any case, the crab cake, though mostly free of filler, was dry and stringy, an affront to my Maryland sensibilities. I also had the cedar plank king salmon, presumably a specialty of the restaurant...my piece was rather small and unevenly cooked...half the fillet was nice and moist, rich with the extra fat of the species. The other half, however, was dry, stringy, and tasteless. Sigh...the accompanying couscous was inoffensive, with bits of red pepper and spring English peas. The entire dish was underseasoned. My wife's cheese plate was probably the best dish of the night, but no choice of cheeses was given. She had some version of surf and turf, with a Korean-glazed Pork Belly and a 90's refugee of a seared Tuna fillet. The pork belly was quite tasty, but the tuna was bland and mushy. Our guests had a rather plain salad and shared the cheese plate with my wife. They had the Korean-BBQ-inspired pork loin, and the cedar plank salmon...again, they weren't overwhelmed. My wife ordered a bowl of pasta for our 2 yr old...this arrived adorned solely with butter (we had asked for and belatedly received some grated parmesan...score woohoo!)...this cost me $7!\\n\\nFinally, for desert I had a no-sugar-added blackberry cobbler, but I was served an old, dried out biscuit in a bowl with three blackberries tossed in...uggh. The birthday girl had a nondescript chocolate cake with a flashing plastic Tinkerbell, and the others had some ice cream. \\n\\nWe all split one moderately-priced bottle of wine. The crowning moment for this dinner was when the check came. I had been planning on picking up all the \\"overages\\" on the check since our guest had a birthday...however, our waiter already billed our magic bands to our separate rooms and made such a fuss about fixing it that we just gave up and paid it as it was. Total damage, aside from the two dining service credits each (worth about $80 per person) resulted in overages of about $100 for the four adults and one 2 yr old...estimated total cost about $420. All this for food that was probably considerably worse than Cheesecake Factory food. OMG.

Wife and I went here to breakfast this coupon and had a coupon for 2 breakfast meals for $9.99.  Wife got the veggie scrambler and I got the pancake, eggs, and chicken sausage with potatoes.  Our total was higher than we thought it should have been and asked why and she was like, I don't know...Next (referring to next customer).  We were turned off but it was just a couple bucks, so just went to our seat.  I was a bit turned off by the experience and checked the receipt and it didn't look like the receipt showed what I ordered so I went back to the register and talked with another employee and the manager corrected and retook the order.  Total came too $9.99 and the extra $2 was for potatoes and the order was wrong, it didn't have the eggs in the order.  Meal arrived at the table and all I got was pancakes and the chicken sausage....no eggs.  WTH?  Didn't both going back up the third time and waiting long for the breakfast so we just ate and left for good.  Do now know why it was so difficult to get the order right?  Also, the menu could be clearer...if bread/potatoes or fruit only come with the scramblers, why not make it part of there own menu and not have exclusions?  a bit confusing to someone new.  At the end of it, the pancakes were pretty good but the experience was poor at best.

Although, the last couple of times we didn't really get much of the truffle flavor. But they are still great. We have also tried the shrimp and grits and the lobster tacos. Both were good.\\n\\nBecause we always have appetizers, we usually split the entree between two people. Pub Burger: angus beef, caramelized onions, blue cheese. Ok, so the burger is really good. However, the meat does not have a lot of flavor so a little bit of adobo (ok... salt and pepper then) would not hurt the kitchen. This comes with more truffle fries. Yay! The best part is that when we told them that we were splitting the burger, they actually split it for us in separate plates AND they gave each person a FULL order of truffle fries. How awesome is that!\\n\\nWe have also tried the steak frites which is a flat-iron steak and it comes with truffle fries. Yay!

Despite its corporate and trying-to-be-hip marketing facets, Chipotle is a good option when it's time to get a substantial meal quickly. One thing these stores do really well is to service a large queue of people at a rapid pace. The base price of a burrito or taco dinner is not too stiff, but if you start adding extras (like guacamole) the bottom line can climb painfully. The carnitas and the barbacoa are my favorite meat options and the salsas add a lot of flavor. I ask for all of the red ones. The lettuce is always fresh-looking romaine. It's nice to have the option to drink a beer here, but the food is so rich and big that a beer can easily put you over the threshold into the dull world of the food-coma.

I walked in with two fellow diners without a reservation at 5:10pm and felt unwelcome since we didn't have a reservation. What is this, American Psycho's Dorsia? Besides, does Ravenous Pig refuse to seat people between the hours of 5pm and 7pm because the restaurant was empty - well before the typical evening crowd.\\n\\nWe were seated around 5:30pm and when my friend asked if we could get a booth the hostess declined because, according to her, their booths were specifically requested and reserved (mind you, the restaurant is painfully, obviously empty at 5:30 in the afternoon). As my other friend remarked, way to take the \\"pub\\" out of \\"gastropub\\". Only after we had seated and were given menus did the hostess offer to seat us at the booth after she had checked with the powers-that-be if it was alright. We didn't want to bother moving again so we politely declined.\\n\\nThe food is, as others have mentioned, expensive, unimpressive and served in tiny portions. I ordered the burger and it was fine, just not great and certainly not the best burger in Orlando. I've had comparable off the back of a food truck. The fries were great, I love truffle oil and seasoning and they were delicious.\\n\\nI sampled some of my friend's Pear and Duck Salad although I felt terrible doing so since she literally had only 3 morsels of duck on her plate. Not awful just unsatisfying. With everything I ate I just had this unfulfilled feeling like: that's it?\\n\\nThe shining star of the restaurant was the waiter and I feel terrible that I can't remember his name. He was informative, prompt, patient, friendly and most importantly, unpretentious. He brought out some blueberry brownie bites on the house and really made our dining experience great.\\n\\nI realize The Ravenous Pig is central in Winter Park and has quite the reputation - surely there's not a shortage of customers with deep pockets but seriously, try a little humility on for size because the food and environment just wasn't that great."},{"name":"Frites Fries With Benefits","address":"1011 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I had a spicy buffalo chicken poutine which was more than I expected.

Not long after it opened, I went for lunch. It was pretty empty but the food was excellent and the other tables were buzzing with how much they liked their dishes. The menu was smaller than the downtown location, but still offered plenty of options. The Arepa was as delicious as ever. The place itself was cute inside with wine racks and unique lighting fixtures. \\n\\nI decided to head back for dinner a few weeks ago, and was really surprised when I looked at Yelp to see some negative reviews. After my experience, I have to join the crowd. It was jam-packed on a Friday night but we were able to get the last table. It was extremely loud and hard to carry on a conversation the entire time. My main disappointment was that half of the menu is not available during dinner. I guess they want dinner hours to be more tapas, but I want a big burrito! On top of that, the service was pretty terrible. Our teenage server hid in the corner texting most of the time we were there so there were no drink refills and a long wait for the check. \\n\\nThe food is still great, so that gives them three stars instead of two. I mean, at the end of the day, I still can slather on that cilantro sauce.

While this place doesn't have much in the way of atmosphere, it does have an interesting background because it focuses on sustainable and in season foods. \\n\\nOur server was lovely and showed us the kind of service and hospitality that Disney prides itself on. We started out the meal with fresh bread, and our cocktails (strong!). I shared a Florida peach salad with my mom, and it was fantastic! My fianc√© loved the black bean chili and said it was delicious. \\n\\nFor our entrees, my mom and I both ordered the beef tenderloin. My fianc√© had the flat iron steak, and my mom's girlfriend ordered the chicken. Everyone truly enjoyed their meals. I can't remember the last time I cleaned my plate, but I did this time. What an incredible meal! The steak was perfectly prepared and tasted fantastic, served with delicious marinated mushrooms, a red wine sauce, green beans, and mashed potatoes. I was quite full, but it was so worth every last bite!

It came with fries, which it didn't mention on the menu, so I also ordered some corn bread, which we ate as a dessert, it was quite sweet.  I like sweet corn bread but I def have friends that don't.  My wife had the Mediterranean Plate , which is listed as an appetizer, but was plenty large enough for her to eat as an entree.  She loved it.  There was a small selection of craft beers on tap.

She was so impatient, not wanting to wait more than 5 seconds for anyone to make up their mind.  She would sense someone hesitating, and then say she would come back.  After a couple times, she made it clear she wasn't coming back until we were ALL ready to order.  We were all pushing each other to CHOOSEAGLASSOFWINEALREADY, but then the server wasn't there to answer questions, so that would delay the decision further...  Logistics!  STRESS!\\n\\nAt one point, about 4 of us were ready for a second glass of wine, and we were all getting the same thing we'd had.  Well, we all got the wrong wine -- two of us got something we didn't want, and two of us got something we thought was better.  When we called her back to point out that the wines got mixed up, she denied it, and was clearly not going to fix anything.  She smelled the wines and insisted she had not made a mistake.  The two who accidentally got better wines said they would pay for theirs (even though she had mixed the new wine with the old wine in the same glass) so she finally relented, and brought the correct wine for the other two.  Hot, hot mess.  And when the new wines came out, the men who served them were so nice it felt like they were compensating.  AWKWARD!\\n\\nAnd the paella took a long, long time.  Like an hour from order to fork of hot goodness being consumed.  Despite that, the vegetarian paella was delightful.\\n\\nNot sure I'll go back.

We were apprehensive about the menu but decided to give it a try as we have had nice meals there in the past, with the former chef and former menu.\\n\\nThe arrangement of the food on the plate is beautiful.  Great attention to detail and design.   The gem lettuce with elder flower vinegar and bay shrimp was quite good, but the fava beans with mussels was fair. The duck with fennel was okay, as was the poached halibut. They were not horrible by any means but the blending of flavors and ingredients were strange and rather bland.\\n\\nWe appreciate the ambiance and the service was okay. At the start of the meal, the waiter noticed that the wine glasses were not very clean, and he took them away and replaced them. When he attempted to extract the cork from our Spanish wine tableside, the cork disintegrated; the waiter vanished and returned with a strainer; he strained the wine into a carafe. As a result, we ended up drinking a wine that had pieces of unsightly cork clinging to the sides of the carafe and in our wine.  The waiter brought hot rolls and soft butter; I asked him if he could bring me some hard, cold butter and mentioned that I knew they had cold, hard, wrapped pats of butter in the kitchen as they serve those at the adjoining Castanga Caf√©.  He never brought the butter.\\n\\nThe desserts were marginal.  The baked apple was okay; the rhubarb with accompanying \\"oat cake\\" and some kind of ersatz \\"ice cream\\" was a joke and utterly ridiculous.

We were all arriving at different times so my friend went down around 6:30 pm to save us a table. First mistake - they would only give her a table for 2 (after a 30 min. wait) because the whole party was not there yet. I've heard of this type of policy before but have not experienced it until now. When I arrived I sat with her at the table for 2. When the 3rd person in our party arrived the 2 of them had to share 1 chair as they were \\"having a chair crisis\\", as our waitress put it. I wondered what we were going to do when our 4th came.....they gave us some spiel about putting us back on the waiting list for a table for 4. When we tried to move to another table for 2 that at least had a bench seat, we were aggressively told that we couldn't move there as they had a waiting list and there were other people waiting. Even though we had been there at least 45 minutes with the 2 of them sharing 1 chair. Throughout the night we also sat with empty glasses regularly before someone came to offer to get us refills of our drinks.\\n\\nOur drinks: the R&B East Side Bitter was fine. The Merridale cider my friend had was....well, sweet and fizzy. Cider for the masses, I would call it. It's certainly not indicative of the quality of Merridale ciders I've tried in the past. Very disappointing.\\n\\nOur food: we asked the folks sitting beside us if their chickpea fries were good. They said they weren't so we didn't order them. The French onion soup we got was not very good - too sweet and no depth of flavour. The Lebneh (marinated cheese and olive tapenade) was OK. The cheese was good but the \\"tapenade\\" was just some coarsely chopped olives that someone had added lemon juice to. my friend's bread pudding was cold (like refrigerator cold), and typically it's served as a warm dish. Perhaps the description in the menu should be changed to read \\"cold bread pudding\\".\\n\\nFinally we were moved to another table for 2 but with a bench seat, and provided with the appropriate number of chairs. That was better. The hostess who was originally rude to us was much nicer as well. Our waitress was very nice but it was clear she (and the rest of them) was overwhelmed by how busy it was.\\n\\nThe good:\\nDecor is awesome, lots of board games to choose from, love that they only have local brews on tap (but they really need more than just 5). The big screen tv was showing some cheesy/awesome sci-fi flick - we really enjoyed that! After the dinner rush was over I was very pleased to see a wide variety of people enjoying drinks and board games. Nerds abound!\\n\\nThe verdict:\\nI would give this place another try 'cause I think it has great potential. If they added another 5 - 10 local brews to their selection, gave their staff a bit more customer service training and coaching on how to handle it when it's really busy, put more food items on the menu and worked on the quality of the ones they have, I think this would be a great hangout. If I had a 2nd bad experience I would not return.

As usual, my thanks to Yelp, because if it wasn't for yelp, I would have ended up eating either inside Magic Kingdom (and I wasn't feeling the funnel cake today) or Fuddruckers (don't ask me why Fuddruckers, only G-d can explain these things).\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I love us some Mexican food, so when we were looking for something that wouldn't take forever but would be good and near our hotel, we found this place.\\n\\nLets start with service - fantastic.  Server was wonderful, always seeming to check on us at the right time, had our food quick, was knowledgeable about the menu, had our chips and salsa and refill of our chips and salsa quick, and she said we were adorable (FYI - we are adorable).  I wish I remembered her name because she deserves a shutout, but you, whoever you were, were great.\\n\\nNow the food.  The chips and salsa to start with were yummy.  If the salsa came out of a jar or container, I'd be shocked, because it tasted and looked fresh.  I ordered the fajitas that come with chicken, steak and bacon, topped with some kind of cheese.  Seriously, they should have advertised it as fajitas for 3.  I ate as much as I could without making myself sick and still had a sizeable dinner leftover for later in the week.  And it wasn't just the portion - it was really good.  Best I've had in a while.  I don't know if its the best I ever had, but at worst it was a 4 and the service pushed it to 5.\\n\\nMy girlfriend got a burrito, and this thing should have been advertised as a burrito for 4.  This thing was a big as your arm - provided you have a really long and muscular (or fat, I suppose) arm.  And, she enjoyed hers immensely.  Now, she is a bit more particular about her Mexican food and only went 4 stars, but I loved it.\\n\\nWe came at a good time on a Saturday - it was after the dinner rush, but before the band set up.  They also had a couple of large parties on the way, so we missed the inevitable slow service that comes in a restaurant with lots of large parties, and we were able to talk to each other because the band wasn't playing yet.\\n\\nI don't know if Orlando has a better Mexican place, but if so, I want to go to there,"},{"name":"Beacon Street Tavern","address":"1032 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"Went here last night with a few out of town guests.

This weekend, however, I didn't have any food just a few drinks and an opportunity to enjoy the deck. The food was pretty good, nothing to write home about, but better than your All-American Chain mainstays. The drinks on the other hand, especially they're specialty cocktails, were quite good. A few of us ordered them and could be found passing them around for everyone to try what we had. The inside is nice, much more upscale \\"loungy\\", if that makes any sense, but nice and there's enough soft architecture that it doesn't get too loud.\\n\\nThe wait staff was acceptable--largely the reason it only got three stars instead of four. They came by, but seemingly infrequently, and didn't seem to come by when you might actually need something. For instance, last night we weren't asked if we'd like to order a second round of drinks until they were clearing our meals.\\n\\nIn short: It could definitely work as a date place, the patio being a major draw; the drinks are very good the food is pretty good.

I ordered a steak burrito and a chicken one as well. Unfortunately, the steak was far from being ready and as soon as Ms. Morales noticed this, she comped me the burrito. \\n\\nThat might not sound like a big deal, but the fact that she did it before I got upset about the relatively long wait is what makes it impressive.

You immediately notice a very typical and traditional Tex Mex/Mexican restaurant look with old paintings but if you pay attention,  you'll see the owner loves Willie Nelson. Old Texan comes to my mind and reminds me of my cowboy grandfather who always had his hat, button up shirt, jeans and boots on. He was what the Jim's cartoon looked like if someone drew a cartoon of him.  Even without going down memory lane, I enjoyed it. The restaurant is slightly dark inside with dim lights and the walls have the Austin stone halfway down. The only thing missing is a classic juke box with classic country records.\\n\\nThey play some old country. I don't recall any new music playing which is nice. It adds to the feel. The menu consists of regular items you'd see anywhere as well as personalized menu items. You'll notice the chips seem cheap because they are thin and nearly tasteless.  The salsa had a kick though cold and plain looking. Not much flavor there either. Many restaurants these days serve warm salsa so it was a bit of a surprise to get cold salsa. I was more put off by the chips. The ice tea was nearly flavorless as well. Too weak. Perhaps adding an extra tea bag or two would help.\\n\\nI ordered a three enchiladas plate of three different enchiladas, chicken,  cheese and beef. I was happy to see the chicken enchilada to have freshly cooked vegetables on it with a nice red sauce. They weren't overcooked and had a slight crunch to them, just enough to let me know they were fresh. The cheese and beef enchiladas were of the typical flavor with the gravy on top. Nothing special there but good to know that if I want just some regular enchiladas,  I can come here. \\n\\nWhen you pull the looks and feel of the restaurant with the food, it all comes together.  It's comfortable and calming. My kids even sat still and relaxed. That's hard for them to do."},{"name":"The Ravenous Pig","address":"565 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Maybe we listened to too much hype before we finally tried this place, but our experience was less than stellar.\\n\\nWalking in to a packed house and a loud crowd, we got a couple of draft beers at the bar. Nice little beer list.

Biscuits were great and salads were good.\\n\\nThen the mains. I ordered the beef brisket and my partner ordered lamb over a ravioli-type pasta. Unfortunately, this is where things went awry.\\n\\nMy beef came out lukewarm (it probably sat waiting for my partner's dish). I didn't want to have to wait another 20 minutes, so I didn't say anything. However, this fact going up against our great expectations served to majorly deflate...\\n\\nThe dish itself was inspired but too ambitious. The beef was set over two slices of super sweet cantaloupe. The contrast was too much for my palate, and I ended up shoving the melon to the side. That with the lukewarm dish made it a loser.\\n\\nMy partner's lamb dish suffered a similar fate of sharp contrasts gone wrong. The lamb was stewed and tasty, but served over goat cheese raviolis. Unfortunately the menu did not reveal the pasta was filled with goat cheese- really too strong for my partner's tastes to begin with. Paired with the gaminess of the lamb, it was another lackluster dish.\\n\\nDessert was good, but at this point it would had to have been great to re-inflate our expectations.

At that time I left the hotel and traveled to the airport to make my 4 pm flight back home. Later that night, I went online to check my credit card charges and noticed 2 different charges from the hotel that were charged that day, after I had already checked out.

My credit card number was taken by the hotel purely for incidentals. \\n\\nI immeadiately contacted the hotel to see what these charges were for, and a person at the front desk apologized and said that they didn't have me marked as checked out, and that the extra charges were for the extra price of the room for one night.

Everything has always been wonderful at the aforementioned location and Portland's other location.  However, this afternoon, my wife and I had a rather annoying experience.\\n\\nMy wife and I were inside at a table having drinks for about an hour or so when a waitress that was not our own said to the table behind us that they could have our table when we left for the night.  Unfortunately, the group led by the 38 year old birthday girl with a poor tattoo removal session, proceeded to give my wife the death stare every few minutes while announcing to her group that they would absorb our table once we left.  This made it a little uncomfortable to enjoy our conversation and drinks.  When she started seating guests are our table that was when we got up and just paid our bill and left.\\n\\nOur waitress had no idea this was going on and apologized but the damage was done.  The bar was only about 40% full.  Not sure why they couldn't have been moved to another spot or perhaps made a reservation.  \\n\\nWe definitely felt like our business wasn't appreciated and will not be back to this location.  \\n\\nAnd for the Birthday 'girl'.

It was flavorless, shrimp was almost invisible of how tiny it was. It tasted more like orange water. Yes! The taste of orange was so strong I could only down two bites with the help of my ice tea of course. Where's the tomato? Where's the pico? Most importantly where's the shrimp?\\n\\n The manager walked by and asked me how it was, I summoned my courage and told him nicely it was not to my liking, he gave me a shrug and walked off. Like oh well.. ? Then why the heck would you even ask? He did nothing, didn't offer anything else. He gave me the full bill and shortened me a couple of cents. What a hoodlum.. not only on food but on change. I guess they would have to compensate for no business.\\n\\n \\n Now moving on made the mistake of going back, yes shame on me, but I think everyone deserves a second chance. Ordered my tea and this time I was brought sugar by my nice server OK. Great were doing better. I ordered a chicken tortilla soup. I figured it would be quick and painless. So 40 minutes in I told my server I wanted out, it had taken way too long and I needed to go. She agreed and told me their kitchen was short staffed. So she walks up to the manager ( same guy ) and tells him I've been waiting a long time and just want my check. He refuses to print the check and stands on the kitchen line yelling at the staff? Then they wonder why they're short staffed? I am looking at this in disbelief.\\n\\n\\nHe finally walks up to me with a soup and sets it down in front of me, I tell him I have to go that I don't want it. NOW bare with me, this man walks up to the computer and prints my receipt. YES my receipt with SOUP INCLUDED! I am in loss for words. I didn't even touch the soup! He made me wait until he put the soup in front of me to be able to charge me! What is this? Never iny life have I experienced such behavior, not even from taquerias.

The best tasting dish we ordered was the xiao long bao.\\n\\nHowever, the horrendous review goes to their service, their wait staff, and their attitude.\\n\\nFirst of all, we walk in and the tables are half seated. They seat us at the same table as another family. Fine, we'll take it. But then another table opens up next to us and we ask to be seated there instead. They say it is reserved. Fine, maybe it actually is. 5 minutes later another family walks in, obviously no reservation was made, and they were seated at that table. 1) The wait staff had lied to us 2) Still plenty of other tables were open, no reservations.\\n\\nSecond of all, is it a crime to smile? Do they bark instead of speak? There is a standard to customer service, especially if you expect it to warrant a tip at the end. We got the most hostile reception from their wait staff, they kept walking by our table. I guess they are physically incapable of \\"one moment please.\\"\\n\\nLast of all, they had the gall to expect a tip and make a scene when I did not tip them. A tip should never be expected or required. When the waitress realized i did not tip, in Chinese she said \\"that's rude.\\" And then went on a rant (in Chinese) about how we did not speak Chinese and how I needed to add tip. Excuse me. Since when was tip a mandatory requirement? There needs to be service for there to be tip. Thats my own hard earned money. Who do they think they are?

This was actually one of the few Earl's that I was impressed with which takes a lot considering that I have political issues with the Donnelly Group. The host upon entrance was very friendly, our waitress was sweet and friendly, the music was surprisingly not loud (which means I could actually have a conversation) and the food was actually decent. No matter how little or how much time you spend in one sitting, the experience would be the same. I never order mains 'cause I am an appie person. Appies are easier on the waist and I don't feel sick from filling overload. You get what you pay for in terms of portions.  I ordered tacos and there was at least 1\\" of chicken instead of a pathetic few mm of shredded chicken like some places. When you order a rack of ribs, which were really good, you get a full rack of ribs. My meal was nicely flavored and the chicken nicely marinated. The ribs were well marinated and my good friend's chicken, brie, apple sandwich was to die for. My bill came to a reasonable amount. Although this was a good experience I don't think that I will be coming back. I have a rule of thumb when I am dining: I like to try mom and pop shops and avoid chains in general. There is only so much $$$ to spend in a pay period and so many restaurants in the city to try. \\n\\nThe annoying part is that the washroom is on the top floor, therefore, you have to walk stairs. Unless you've eaten a lot of fat this can be helpful, however, sometimes a girl just needs to take a piss ASAP and not feel as though she is competing in a marathon to get there. \\n\\nOf course the tradition of \\"Earl's Girls\\" was there.

Pretty basic stuff like beef with broccoli, General Tso's chicken, szechwan, etc. You get where I am. That being said, the dishes I've enjoyed in the years I've been going here are consistently flavorful and tasty, and always accompanied by great service. In fact, Winnie's been known to be hanging around and you might catch a tender greeting from her during your visit.\\n\\nIn addition to reliably delicious food, the atmosphere inside Winnie's is charming.

The waitress didn't ask most of our group what they would like for food so most of them didn't end up getting anything. One of the bartenders was extremely rude and wouldn't even ask what you would like to drink when you were getting served but would just look at you. No thank you or anything. Anytime someone would ask for a drink it was as if you were inconveniencing him and he would roll is eyes. I have no idea what his problem was as everyone in our group was very polite to him.

We got off the freeway and were in the Alberta when I searched yelp for nearby breakfast joints and Tin Shed came up with very favorable reviews. I suggested it to my buddy and to the Shed it was. \\n\\nOur timing couldn't have been better because we got one of the last available tables. There are 6 of them on the inside along with a bar, and 9 tables outside with a few of them being picnic tables which can accommodate 6 per. It was a typical chilly Portland morning but we were kept nice and toasty thanks to the outside heaters. I find this a nice touch because not many places in pdx have outside heaters. Another great touch in my opinion is the fact that you serve yourself coffee and water. This saves a lot of time instead of waiting for a server to refill for you. And in this busy establishment, that's a real good thing. \\n\\nAfter perusing the menu for a good 10 minutes, we finally placed our orders. We both opted for the \\"Everything Naughty\\" breakfast. Included is 3 strips of thick, amazingly delicious bacon, 2 free range eggs, a huge homemade biscuit topped with maple bacon gravy (yup, bacon gravy, ya heard me), and a to-die for potato cake (hash). I normally won't say something like this, but this was THE best breakfast I've had in Oregon since moving here 2 years ago! \\n\\nMy only gripe is that the food is sooo good that the it left me wanting more. The portion size is just right for your average eater, but my friend and I are more than \\"average\\" eaters. I honestly could've ate two of those plates because it was that good.

I was disappointed we didn't get bread like most Italian restaurants provide but the waitress was able to get our orders in very quickly. We ordered the grilled calamari to share and then I ordered the shrimp and prosciutto homemade pasta with chili oil. The calamari was really tasty although the mini lentils were very hard to pick up with a fork. The portion was very small for an 8$ appetizer but we were still able to share somewhat between 4 people, with lentils leftover because we could pick them up. My pasta dish was very good. The homemade pasta almost resembled the noodles used in yakisoba. The dish was pan fried with an abundance of shrimp and prosciutto. The portion was tinier compared to the other dishes but the dish was so tasty I savored every bite. I would definitely order it again! I got to taste the pasta pollo as well and was surprised at the creaminess of the dish. The chicken was overlooked and that was a bit disappointing but overall, great dish as well. We then ordered some gelato and boy, was it a good idea! The hazelnut was smooth, the chocolate very rich, and the vanilla just chock full of creamy goodness. I was very impressed four people could share the dessert and still be full afterwards! Overall, the prices were extremely and surprisingly reasonable.

The menu looked great with oysters, interesting sides etc. \\n\\nWe decided we had to try the fried oysters and a wedge for starters and go with the veggie Quesadilla with 3 sides and Camarones Rellenos as the main course. It turned out to be plenty of food. The oysters were out in a flash and were the best oysters I've ever tasted. Lightly breaded with a distinct oyster taste even with the chipotle tarter sauce and green goddess sauces. Priced right at 9.95/dozen with mixed field greens garnish that seemed to be served with everything. This dish will bring me back. The wedge was impressive in size but not much else. not enough dressing for a quarter of a head of iceberg a couple of halved cherry tomatoes, no discernible crumbles and a couple of flakes of bacon. Guys, less lettuce and more other stuff would be far more impressive. Sorry to say that the Camarones Rellenos were equally uninspired. Sounds good, bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with cilantro and jack cheese. Unfortunately they were very small pieces of shrimp, I mean a half of a medium shrimp and mostly bacon. Please don't be stingy at 10.50. Veggie Quesadilla was really good. Husky with a good variety of veggies, it was more than a meal but the sides of truffle fries were limp and just OK. Not sure why the full side of these would be 9.00. The spicy Thai green beans were also just OK. A little too alDente for me. \\n\\nService was wonderful and very quick.

Tonight however, it was exceptionally poor. I drive up to the establishment at 9:20, walk to the door and pull it: it's locked. A couple of the 5 to 6 employees notice me, but get back to their tasks. I look for the hours posted and see that it says they close at 9:30 and the lobby closes 30 minutes prior. Not a problem with that, so I got back in my car, reverse and head towards the drive-through. As I put my car in drive, the lights on the board are then shut off. I proceed to the board where I'm prompted by a female associate that they're closed; there were four cars in front of me and the posted hours say 9:30. I ask if the hours were correct, and she said yes, but the manager told them to close early because they were short staffed. I asked why the four other cars in front of me weren't turned away and she reiterated that they were short staffed. Forgive me, but I don't know why a restaurant would not only have to close the lobby 30 minutes early, but the drive through 10 minutes early as well with 5 or 6 employees on the clock. I asked for the franchise owners phone number, but they'd only give me the 1-800 corporate number. If they want to close before their posted hours, then perhaps they should change their hours.\\n\\nI've always been a big fan of Dairy Queen, but like I said before, this experience isn't atypical at this location.

We chose 2 plates from each of 4 courses.\\n\\nAs our courses arrived, we marveled at the presentation and then were immediately wowed by every single bite. Perfectly prepared, beautifully presented, and wonderfully delicious.\\n\\nOver the next few hours, we shared some amazing dishes. Every one was amazing, the standouts being the sweet and spicy calamari, the sunflower seed risotto, the planked salmon, and the grilled greens. The beef bavette was absolutely stunning and so well prepared, that we had a very difficult time believing it was bavette and not filet mignon. The wine list is impressive as well. We asked the manager about the corkage fee for your own bottles and he indicated it would be $20.\\n\\nThe wonderfully diverse staff was cheerful and excited, and operated very well together. As long as they don't lose that, they will do well.\\n\\nIf they can keep things up, this place is going to be extremely popular. We certainly had one of the best evenings out we've ever had in Portland.\\n\\nOur Heartiest Compliments to the Chef, the Manager and the staff at Swank! Bravo.\\n\\nFrom the pre-launch web site at portlandparamount.com/di...:\\n\\"Swank, will be a lively regional bistro where local flair and classic preparation will meet. Featuring a menu built around local, fresh products and crowd pleasing dishes, Swank will offer breakfast, lunch and dinner 7 days a week. Room service is available for breakfast.\\""},{"name":"Junior Colombian Burger - South Kirkman Road","address":"5389 S Kirkman Rd, Ste 105","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I cant believe this place has any good reviews.

I'm sure it's lovely for parties of 2 and 4, but accomodating a group of 8 \\"foodies\\" is by no means an easy task.   All 8 of us loved every bit of our meal from the cocktail and starters to the wine and dinner.  We will be back.\\n\\nArrival:  we were greated by the friendly hostess who let us know they were setting up our table, and took all of our coats, assuring us it would be just moments.  She was right on target.  We waited less that 10 minutes for our table.\\n\\nAmbiance:  The restaurant is pleasantly small and cozy, with half walls breaking the space in to manageable dining areas.  This helped keep the noise down.   The fireplace and the warm lighting from the open kitchen made it all feel very welcoming.\\nOur table for 8 was a curved banquette that seated 5 comfortably with the other 3 on the opposite side of the table on chairs.\\n\\nStarters:  We began with a drink from their specialty drink menu.  We could tell from the option presented that this menu changed with the seasons (blood oranges are in right now, but not for much longer).  We each had a different drink and each of us loved our selection.  I personally think that this \\"made\\" the meal for us.  Just having a regular cocktail is nice, but these drinks sparked conversation.  We decided to rename one of the drinks (ginger beer, Goslings Rum, blood orange juice) which is a take on the Dark and Stormy called the Storm Front, to \\"Shark and Stormy\\".  Order it and you'll see!\\n\\nWe ordered the Calamari, the meatballs, the mushroom bisque, and the beet salad.  The calamari were light and crispy.  The meatballs were tender and taste.  The bisque was creamy and delicious.  The beet salad was perfectly dressed. \\n\\nWine:  The wine list is varied in both price and region.  Finding a wine that 7 people will all enjoy took about 10 minutes, but we succeeded brilliantly.  The Somelier oversaw our initial taste and pour.  (#8 is a white wine drinker, the rest of us drink red).\\n\\nDinner:  We had a lot of duck fans and not a one of them was disappointed.  The Chestnute bread pudding and Chard were a fabulous accompanyment.

A Colombian colleague brought a tray full of their empanadas to a party and lured us in right there. A meal at La Casona was therefore in the cards. And in case you might be wondering, unlike the piecrust empanadas you may be familiar with, these have a thicker, crunchier outside. Terrific.\\n\\nLa Casona is a pretty humble spot located just off Buford Highway. It never seems to be very busy when I go as the lot has several free spaces, but they must be doing all right. The dining area is quite roomy, so it'd be able to house groups no problem. The ladies working are cordial and attentive.\\n\\nI stick to the bandeja paisa which is excellent since you get heaps of food and a variety of items, and all at a wallet-friendly price tag. The ironically named mini is $11 and the regular sized $13. The only difference is that you get chorizo with the regular platter. The red beans are slightly bland but nothing a little salt can't correct. Rice galore, it's a little buttery too. The chicharron appears to be able to break you teeth in two, but it's really addictive. The menu says the bandeja paisas come with grilled steak but upon ordering, you're also given the option of ground beef. The steak requires a little sawing since it's a tough cut (skirt steak?) but the surface area is reasonable and it's chock full of flavor. I also like the final touches of avocado, a fried egg, and a tiny golden button-like arepa (arepita) which looks more like a cookie than a corn patty. \\n\\nYou definitely won't leave La Casona with any empty feelings in your stomach.

I was sold.\\n\\nInside, the decor is modest and quasi-industrial--though not quite Louisiana or Southern. Not 'steam bar' either for that matter; the guys at the open kitchen up front were assembling sandwiches as an NFL game blared overhead. It's a loud and raucous place, so maybe in that way it felt like a lot of restaurants I have been to in the South--where the food and drink are centre stage.\\n\\nThe beer menu is mediocre, though summery favourites like White Bark and Kronenberg Blanc do make an appearance. \\n\\nWe tried a few of the appetizers and all were very good--a fresh beet salad, a grilled calamari, and a sampling of fresh West Coast oysters. Each were excellent; the beets, paired nicely with walnuts and spring greens, the calamari seasoned with sherry and garlic and pan-seared, and the oysters were paired with a selection of homemade condiments and fresh horseradish.\\n\\nFor our entrees, everyone got the fried chicken--was there any other choice?--and it did not disappoint. Juicy and moist, the crispy skin is lightly dressed with a cajun-honey butter--and the ever-so-slight sweetness of the butter just elevates the chicken one notch further. The secret, I'm sure is the buttermilk though, as this chicken was so juicy and flavourful. I wish I could say the same for the accompaniments on my plate; the mashed potatoes propping up the chicken were like eating wall spackle; dry, gritty, and tasteless. Whatever, that chicken is stupendous.\\n\\nFor desert, we split a cayenne chocolate cake--a paltry serving even at $6--and we enjoyed the slighly spicy taste against the dense chocolate cake, but we were less keen on the 'vanilla whip' floating atop the desert. It was tangy, like a marscapone, but it clashed with the spicy chocolate, and there was too big a dollop to ignore.\\n\\nAll in all, a fun meal--with many great bites. I'd stop back in to Chewie's for more fried chicken and oysters.

I was pleased to note that the wifi didn't require a password--that says something about the place.  It indicates a generosity of spirit.  \\nThe menus is varied, heavy on the south of the border fare, but also replete with a number of salads (all fresh) and burgers (including a few veggie).  There are quite a few vegetarian selections as well.  I recommend the mezza platter, which is middle eastern treat of hummus, falafel, assorted olives, pickled jalapenos,cucumber salad and a hefty serving of warmed pita bread that tastes suspiciously home-made.\\nDot's is well known for it's hand-cut, ample servings of fries--with a multitude of toppings.  If you are low on funds, but want to get out and fill your tummy, a plate of Dot's fries will hold you.  In fact, everything at Dot's is ample, so don't over order.  \\nThe service is friendly and the wait staff embody the attitude.  They dress the way they want, and have real conversations with their customers.  My waitress today was wearing short-shorts, torn stockings. multiple piercings, pretty ink, a halter top and blue streaked hair.  You gotta love it.   \\nDot's has a pretty cool history, it's definitely \\"old Portland,\\" and the hipness of the place is eternal.

As for everyone else, it's fun, it's cool, and the food and drink are above par for a neighborhood joint.  The happy hour (2-7) prices are a major bargain.

Alfredos isn't trying to be anything other than homemade Italian fare that will knock your socks off. And that it does in spades.\\nItalian is high on my taste list, and I try the best places in NYC, SF, LA and the like, so I have a little experience. \\nFirst off we started with the Melon/Prosciutto and Scungilli as appetizers. I have not had a better blend/balance of two tastes in appetizers since I can remember. Both of them blew our mind. I HIGHLY recommend these appetizers. I think it was the sweetest most perfectly ripe cantaloupe I have ever had. If youve never had Scungilli, this is the place to try. It was tossed in a vinaigrette with mushrooms and onions and to die for. This first course was the best part of the food experience in my opinion. Then I had Jumbo Scampi which was like baby lobsters, and she had the Veal \\"Godfather\\" plate  which includes 3 veal medallions done 3 different ways.. Hers came with fresh grilled Zucchini and mine was on angel hair. Again, the straight dope. Home made Italian food with no compromise making no excuses. Bold, tangy, buttery, garlicky in your face kick ass, mouthwatering, scrumptious food.  After leaning back in the booth for a breather, and both of us commenting on how \\"food high\\" we were, (its a term we use for when the food excites our senses so much, it sends endorphins coursing through the veins) we then ordered Espresso and Tiramisu. Again, I was fully floored at how they got the coffee and dessert to blend flavor profiles so well. The Tiramisu was the light, fluffy kind..maybe 3 inches tall with decadent fluffy cream. I had a coffeegasm instantly with the first espresso swill after a forkful of the Tiramisu..Oh my God... I wanted to hug the old Cuban guy and thank him for this wonderful experience he had imparted on us this night.. It was SO worth being seated 30 min after our reservations. (Friday night). I would wait 30 minutes every time I went here and still come back again and again...\\nIn closing... this is an unpolished gem of a restaurant. It is the sexy Italian street kid, who may be rough around the edges, but knows his craft and has a heart full of passion and a way of stirring passion in others. This is a much more \\"raw\\" than \\"refined\\" dining experience.  Experienced eaters know what I mean, and I cherish these gems.

I love you with the fire of a thousand suns, and you shine as brightly in my heart as a thousand full moons.  I am so glad that I live near to you, otherwise I don't know if I ever would've found you -- and that would've been so very very heartbreaking.  Your plantains are the best I've ever had. I frequently dream about them.\\n\\nSeriously, though, come here.  I've never had something that wasn't outstanding.  My friend's family is from Colombia and lives on the South Shore, and El Oriental is the only Latin American restaurant they bother coming into the city for. \\n\\nEl Oriental can get a little busy at night on weekends, but it is worth it.  Their prices are crazy reasonable (1.50 for an empanada!!).  The staff is always superb and very helpful -- once my friend was deciding between two entrees and the waitress let us know that the beef for the beef dish was drier than usual that day, so she'd recommend against it.  I thought it was fabulous that she was so honest!  Also, whenever I order takeout it is ready in the timeframe they give me.\\n\\nappetizers\\n--Empanadas are delicious.  I've found the carne to be better than the pollo, but both are still good.\\n--Cuban pork tamales.  I'm usually not much of a tamales fan and even I have to admit this is tasty.\\n--Fried yuca.  These are like French fries that taste healthier.  I have no idea if they actually are any healthier, but they seem like it, and that's good enough for me.\\n\\nVariety Plates\\n--My favorite is the Ropa Vieja con Pollo (shredded chicken).  You get a large plate of chicken mixed with peppers and onions in delicious red sauce, and then a bigger plate of: black or red beans, white or yellow rice, and fried green or ripe plantains.  Large portions -- I usually get two meals out of this.\\n--My friend gets the Bistec Salteado (steak in sauce) or Lengua en Salsa (beef tongue in sauce) and raves about them.\\n\\nDesserts\\n--Flan. I have no words. If you like flan, get it.  If you don't like flan, get it.  You will enjoy this flan.\\n--Tropical shakes.  They have quite a selection of flavors, and while I can only personally attest to the guava, I'm willing to bet they're all great.  Everything at El Oriental is.\\n\\nLastly, here are the only slight drawbacks I can see\\n--$10 minimum to use credit card\\n--no alcohol\\n--there aren't any large (6+) tables.  I'm sure they have ways to accommodate larger groups, but I'd definitely call ahead to ask."},{"name":"Ranch 616","address":"616 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been going to Ranch 616 for years, a regular of sorts, and there are four reasons why (in no particular order).

They are always plump, perfectly fried with an amazing batter that must have crack as the secret ingredient and, if that weren't enough, they come with two foodgasm worthy dipping sauces as well. \\n\\nThird, they have revolving daily specials that are always creative and fun like a mixed green salad topped with grilled salmon and two crawfish & cream cheese flautas on the side...yeah you read that correctly!

We had never been there before, and we are so glad we did. The prices were great and you just can't go wrong with pasta. We got in line and when it was our turn the general manager, Ken, rewarded us with a free rice crispy treat for following directions! He asked if we had ever been here before, which we hadn't, so he guided us through the many options we had on their menu. You can customize anything on the menu to your liking (and you can even get gluten-free pasta if you're  a celiac!), you just have to ask. All dishes start as a vegetarian dish. And he told us the salads were made with local ingredients. There's nothing better than that. \\nMy sister-in-law ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, I ordered the Wisconsin Mac and Cheese, and my husband couldn't decide between the Japanese Pan Noodles and the Indonesian Peanut Saute. Ken told him that for a dollar more my husband could get both on one plate. We sat down at our table and soon after, Ken served us our plates. He even stuck around to see if my husband liked what he suggested (which he definitely did). I've never had macaroni and cheese as good as this in my life. Everyone loved what they got and we all tried each others dishes. Each were perfect. After we ate, Ken came by again and gave us free desert! I'm assuming it's because we hadn't been there before, but either way, it was a great trip. We tried to tip him, but he refused!

I arrived, stood in the doorway for about five minutes before being pushed out of the way by other customers. The waitress immediately greeted them, but continued to ignore me.

Finally, I just decided that I would walk to the bar where the cashier is, in the hopes that I would be able to flag someone down. But again, I was completely ignored. I said, \\"excuse me, excuse me,\\" over and over, but no one would give me the time of day.

We wanted to squeeze Powell's into the trip too, but having not been there before, I ended up marking the Hawthorn location on our map, rather than the big one downtown.  We had just gotten off a 6am flight, were disappointed about wasting some of our precious time in the city and were HUNGRY!  I'd also looked up a few vegetarian restaurants in the area, but as much as we like hippie chow sometimes, we wanted the non-meat version of an all-American breakfast.  While still parked on Hawthorn St., my husband needed to go across the street to the ATM and I waited in the rental car.  He came back with a smile on his face, saying that there was a nice looking diner across that had veggie sausage on the menu.\\n\\nThe proprietress came out from the kitchen as soon as we entered, seated us at a comfortable table for two by the window and brought menus and water.  The design-your-own omelette with veggie sausage and cheese and hash browns and English muffins on the side sounded like just the ticket and it was!  We requested extra crispy hash browns and they were perfect.  It seemed that the proprietess was also helping in the kitchen, but she was right there if other customers came in or to refill our waters.  All this food which kept us full until well into the evening (including a visit to the big Powell's) set us back only $20 including the tip.\\n\\nWhile we were waiting for our meal to come -- which was less than 10 minutes -- another patron came over and offered us the newspaper he'd finished reading.

What i love about velvet taco is they're open super late and the quality is still good late at night. I also like the creativity of the flavors and how they add herbs and garnishes to their tacos that elevate them. These are by no means traditional tacos and if you want steak fajita or mexican tacos then go to taco deli instead. The tikka chicken is my favorite but it's decently spicy. Ranking the tacos i had it's probably the tikka chicken, annatto shredded pork, falafel, the cuban pig, the rotisserie chicken, the fish and chips, the shrimp and grits, and then the akashi beef one.

The decoration scheme doesn't actually change between day and night, though it seems like it does. It's always a little dark inside, as any good tavern should be; at night the lighting creates an ambiance that goes beyond your average watering hole. There are booths whose back cushions look like they could be something out of Alice in Wonderland, and after nightfall it gives the place an added impression of a boudoir.

Today, unfortunately, I am writing this review based on a really sub-par experience I had.\\n\\nIt was a little bit busier than normal, but, really, only the outside patio was crowded, inside, wasn't full. Got seated, order taken all good. Waitress was polite, but you could see it was a bit hectic for the staff serving.\\n\\nOrdered the fish tacos... and really... by fish, think of a shredded fish, maybe a couple of pinches in each taco. The taste, was ok, due to the fact that it was more of a Salad Taco, you could barely see or feel any fish. So, either rename the dish or, be honest about it. I was served not by my waitress, she brought me the dish without fork nor knife, no napkins. I had to ask. \\n\\nThen, with that, I ordered my second pint (sleeve actually, they don't have pints), since this dish (a SALAD TACO with sprinkled shredded fish) took about 35 minutes to come. The beer never came actually.\\n\\nSo, ended up paying $14+tax on a salad taco, that took 35' to cook, and didn't get my second beer that I've ordered.

All options are available for lunch. So, where does it sit in the Ramen wars. Price-wise about equal to the others (dropped 15$ with tip). Broth is not quite as interesting as Totsuya's Tonkatsku broth, but may satisfy those who find that Michi's can be over-the-top sometimes. Noodles are really nice, though, more like what you get in Japan than some of the others - medium thickness, not too chewy, but not overdone. The one I came had 1/2 Ajitama and Chashu pork; the pork is the real style, but smoked to a crispier level than Tonkatsku's (though there are more pieces). The overall assembly of it was less artful than the others (inc. Kome and Musashinos), but nice all the same. Toasted garlic shone through without being cloying.

First, grab napkins! Second, don't remove the entire wrapper, I believe it's somewhat supposed to be eaten like a burrito, just tear back the beginning of the wrapper and dive in. If you don't, like I didn't, it will fall apart and all the amazing toppings will just seep out and in the end you will need to finish it with a fork. Also, since there is so much added to this burger, I think you need to get no less than a double to make sure the meat is not missed. I made the mistake of getting a single (which is normally a reverse mistake, I almost always get a double) and I really don't remember tasting the meat. The only thing I did not get on it was the mayo or \\"pink\\" which, as I was educated, is mayo/ketchup. I think my favorite topping was the potato chips which gave it great texture. I always used to smash my chips up on my sandwiches and think it was the best thing in the world, I am glad I got to revisit this in my adulthood.\\n\\nI also ordered the empanadas which you didn't really get a choice of what kind so I just went with it. It was 6 mini beef and cheese empanadas and to explain them in a comparison, they were beef McDonalds chicken McNuggets and they were delicious. They also have a sauce bar (which is giving a little too much credit because none of the sauces are labeled) and we discovered the cilantro based one and it was a refreshing spread. \\n\\nThere isn't the best social seating either, its' just long wall type bar space all along the right side of the place. So it's fast food but with pretty good flavor.\\n\\nOverall, it was an experience and I may try it again if I am in the area but I think I would rather have a few drinks in me and I KNOW I am going for the double next time =)"},{"name":"The Matador","address":"1438 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The salsa was phenomenal.

It was a cold and drizzly day so I thought a warm bowl of curry would be the answer to my lunch question. I ordered the golden curry which came with a basket of sticky rice. The curry had potatoes, green beans, eggplant and tofu in it, allegedly... I didn't see any eggplant. I wasn't a fan of the curry. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything I would ever order again. The sticky rice was lukewarm and clumpy (not just sticky). I wish they offered brown rice. I also question the sanitation behind the woven baskets being used to serve rice. Do people stick their forks in the basket after they've eaten from them? I used a separate fork just to scoop out the rice. Do the baskets get washed? I didn't ask, but I was thinking about it as I was eating my meal. I was really disappointed by my curry so I ended up two carts down ordering dessert from another cart afterwards to get the taste of out my mouth. Unfortunately, it's now 6 hours later and I still can taste the curry.

(I think it's because nobody really knows it's there, the menu is mostly set and the price is on the high side for the average tourist.) We were greeted and seated in no time...and served a basket of hot, flaky cheese bread balls. Although they are best when fresh from the oven, my hubs and I were fighting over the last one later in the meal. Hubby ordered the dragonberry mojito and really enjoyed it. \\n\\nWhile we munched, the waiter gave us an idea of how the place works. We could go at any time to the salad bar. Main courses are served \\"rodizio\\" style, which means servers continuously bring South American rotisserie skewers of meats directly from the grill and then slice and serve them tableside. The meats include filet mignon, rib eye, flank steak, bacon wrapped chicken, chicken legs, sausage, roast beef, lamb, pork and the house specialty picanha -- top sirloin. We were given a little dot to flip over as needed: green for \\"bring on the meat!\\" and red for \\"still enjoying the last round.\\" Then we went off to the salad bar. \\n\\nThe salad buffet bar is decent and had some interesting items on it. I saw various types of salads, one of which was green, but without the weed looking type and another was a tasty bowtie pasta salad. Salad toppings were modest, but the dressing was marvelous: mango and a cilantro dressing. Both were nummy. I saw plantains that looked candied, sushi, an awesome cheese selection, black beans, potato mash, rice, prosciutto ham, rolls with yummy herb butter, and more that I either wasn't interested in or can't remember right now. \\n\\nSo back at the table, we began our meaty adventure. The sausage, pork and chicken were tasty, but not as good as the beef. Our favs were the filet mignon and the top sirloin. Some of the rubs on the meat were really great, so I recommend trying to get an end or outer piece. Also, some of the meat was on the rare to medium rare side. I'm a fan, as I think the meat is more flavorful and tender, but it might offend others. \\n\\nThe service was attentive, friendly and helpful, but not invasive. They kept our plates meaty and our glasses full. On a side note regarding the service: I overheard a chef explaining the various dishes on the buffet bar to a customer. Turns out she had food allergies and he was helping her figure out what she could safely eat. The chef insisted on creating a fresh salad for the lady, just to be sure nothing was harmful.

We found El Patron during one of our visits about 4 years back. We make it our mission to visit this restaurant every time we visit Florida, have even driven 2 hrs prior to come here. They used to have this trio salsa that was breathtaking. There must have been a new chief? The salsa has since been taken down from the menu and the new menu is very simple. To start we ordered the Queso, it was good, not $8 good. But that's okay, the chips they give you along with your salsa was disk shaped. Maybe it's an experience to eat with your hands? You have to break them down to chip size, from a taco tortilla size. That's alright, initially they gave you 5 chips along with your salsa. Since we got the Queso, it ran out pretty fast. So we asked more from the boy that gave us our food. Wellll he never came back, so we started working on our food. But didn't want to leave the $8 damn Queso around. So we asked again and lol they gave us 3 chips ...lmao. For $8 f*cking app, do you have to be stingy about them damn chips?? Oyeeee, our waitress came to check on us twice, once when they brought out our drink, made my husbands wrong and the bartender had to ask what I ordered...?!?!?? Why?? Idk.. A different man took our order, and he was kinda grumpy. The food was okay, I can get it anywhere. Along with the $12 drinks. I'm fairly disappointed, the staff was not very friendly. I just can't stand a place that are stingy with their customers. I guess I'm old fashioned, and think treating the customers good is a priority.. Anyways, it feels like an end of an era.

If you've traveled through/lived in Columbus, Ohio, you would understand my feeling of becoming somewhat jaded with really good pizza.  So I thought we'd try something different.... I have read alot of Yelp reviews for other restaurants, and thought we'd see what little pizza shops around have really great reviews.  I wanted to treat her to some phenominal pizza.  I read through \\"Paul\\", \\"Lee\\", and \\"Shaun\\" 's reviews of Rofini's and I though this is definately the place..... a 35 minute drive on a nice sunny day..... pick up a pizza and take it to a park nearby... this'll be great.\\n\\n15 minutes into the drive, I call ahead to order for pick-up.  I ordered a Medium pizza with mushroom and bacon, getting the response... \\"we don't have bacon\\".  Ok, how about \\"Black Olives\\", Then the response came \\"No, we don't have black olives\\".  So we ended up going with Mushroom and ham...  I'm willing to work with that,  Then I ordered some bread sticks..... suprise, suprise...   \\"We only have garlic cheese bread.\\".... total came to $16.  A little on the higher end of the pizza scale, but with the other 3 reviews, I was feeling confident.... maybe this is a little higher end italian kind of thing,\\n\\nWe pulled up outside the strip with the 1970'-esk sign.

For sure the hottet temperature in a pizza place I've experienced.\\n\\nAfter waitng another 10-15minutes (which I didn't mind, --- better to have fresh pizza than one that was left on the warming rack for a while), we took the pizza and bread to a nearby park to eat (no dining room or other seating available at the shop.\\n\\nPizza - traditional round, cut into very small pices in the \\"grid\\" type pattern. Crust - overall-ok, not greasy, not as much like \\"cardboard\\" as other places I've had pizza from in the past. -- I've had worse, had many that were better.  The sauce was slightly sweet, but the pizza was still over-all very bland/tasteless.  But seriously, what kind of \\"5 star - rated\\" pizza place doesn't have bacon OR black olives as toppings?!\\n\\nThe Garlic cheese bread was style a half a loaf of french bread, topped with garlic butter, then coated with cheese and topped with oregano (and/or other spices).

We are used to more expensive pizza, and don't mind it if you feel that you get what you pay for.\\n\\nWhen leaving the park I decided to just dump the extra pizza in the trash can.  Is over-all bland / tastless pizza going to get any better when re-heated?  I doubt it.\\n\\nI have to admit, with the bar set with my top currently with Donatos quality, I feel that even day old leftovers from even any of the national chains - Papa John's, Marco's, and Little Cesars would beat this place hands down, any day."},{"name":"Polaris Grill","address":"1835 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"The Polaris Grill is the bees knees.\\n\\nIt is close to home.

Disney tries really hard. But what a regrettable dinner. \\n\\nFirst, they made us wait several minutes to set up the table. That's generally not a problem. And the kids got to run around the beautiful resort. But when we sat down, the place was empty. Like, totally empty. So you made us wait because? In hindsight, an inauspicious start. \\n\\nFor starters, we ordered the charcuterie platter and the fettuccine.The high point of the night was the charcuterie platter. Phenomenal. The fettuccine? Geez, what a disaster. I still can't make heads or tails what happened there. It was dry pasta. No sauce. No promised farm egg. (At least not that I could locate on the dish.) I'm not sure if they just forgot to finish the plate or if that disaster is what was intended, but it was hardly edible (and we're good eaters). \\n\\nFor entree, I ordered the buffalo strip. Meh. I cook a lot of buffalo at home. One thing you can't say about buffalo is that it is not tender. This just wasn't tender. Not what I expect with bison, particularly not at $49. My daughter's kid-sized steak was also very average. Everyone else seemed to be more or less underwhelmed by the entrees. Steak isn't hard to cook. If you are a steak place and charge what this restaurant charges, it ought to be accomplished at a far higher level. Hell, I do better at home. \\n\\nOn the flip side, the dessert (creme brulee) was very well done; and I found the sides pretty good.\\n\\nThe service was also a little questionable. We had two servers and both disappeared for a long stretch during the meal. I don't need a lot of attention but at least poke your head in every so often. I had also brought a nice bottle of wine to dinner. That bottle must have sat there for 20-25 minutes until they decided to open and pour it. \\n\\nLuckily, Jiko the next evening was a total hit (as usual). If you're going to Disney and want to dine well, go to Jiko or Bluezoo instead. Skip this spot. Sorry, Disney."},{"name":"Noodles & Company","address":"100 NW 10th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I had heard a lot about this fast casual noodle bar and wanted to give it a shot when I was in Portland.

Sometimes, service has been good, with a server who is attentive and quick, but many times I've had servers who are slow and take their time. \\n\\nThe last time we were here, we stated when we arrived that we would be having 7 people in our party. The restaurant was completely empty at 5pm. She walked us over to a 4 top table. I asked if they had larger tables, and she said they did not. I asked if they could push two of the four tops together. Many other restaurants do this for larger parties, and I figured this should not be an issue as the restaurant was empty, and and they wouldn't be losing money on a party, since a 4 top and 3 top would be sat at two different tables if we split up. She said that was not possible. So therefore, for our entire meal, while the four top table next to us that we requested to be pushed to ours sat empty, our party of 7 sat at a table meant for 4, with a few of us eating from our laps. There was no owner present during this time, as I suspect that she would have been appalled at this. The waitress must have been new and inexperienced because she also under-poured our beers, leaving about an inch and a half of space at the top of the glass. It was an unfortunate experience that tainted our view of the restaurant. We'll be back, but will never be back with a large party, which is unfortunate as we spent a good amount of money on food and beer."},{"name":"Boston Tea Stop","address":"54 Jfk St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I absolutely love this place.

I wouldn't call this \\"Mexican\\" food, but more of Americanized Restaurant Mexican food.  We started out with chips and salsa, nothing special. Next we had the \\"SPICY\\" Fried Calamari... SPICY??? Not really. It wasn't even mild, again nothing special. It really tasted like Calamari sprinkled with a little bit of chili powder and cumin.  The \\"Spicy\\" calamari also had breaded red bell peppers. I ordered the Citrus Shrimp Ceviche and Tortilla Soup.. Again, nothing special. It was alright. It supposedly came with Serrano chili's, but I think they took the seeds off because there was no spice to it either. Tortilla Soup was a joke. It barely had any soup. The soup was sitting under a bed of thinly sliced potato chips and shreded chicken. They really need to add more soup, or put it in a bigger bowl. I think I had about 4 sips of the soup and then just had all toppings. We had 2 waitresses which were all friendly. We did encounter two others that weren't our waitresses--- one of the waitresses seemed pretty stuck up. She was the full Vietnamese waitress.

The group I was working with suggested something local before we went out to Boston the next day. I was just excited to go out to eat for the first time in MA. I was excited about the people I was going with, the food, the accents, everything.\\n\\nI think it is a really cute place. From the outside you don't really know what to expect, so I'm sure they have a lot of referral based consumers. I feel like if I was Italian I could have appreciated the decor even more, however I could not relate to anything from the paintings, lamps, lighting..etc. Which is fine, I like to learn new things about different cultures and revisit the \\"old world,\\" from time to time.\\n\\nWe were sat promptly, and it was a little busy for a Tuesday night. Our waiter was cute, but he didn't make any recommendations, explain the specials or the menu. It was a group of 7 women, and we were all talking so that's fine.\\n\\nThe bread was a bit odd, not warm, there was some kind of mushroom on it. The basil oil they served it with was EXCELLENT, that's why I wish the bread was a little tastier.\\n\\nI had the three cheese ravioli which was terrific. The pasta was well done, the sauce could have been a little spicier, and the cheese was creamy. Everyone else's food looked good as well. Two of the girls had penne a la vodka, my only issue with that was too many large uncut vegetables on the plate.\\n\\nOverall though, I had a great time. We stayed past closing and they didn't have a problem. I would definitely come back here.

Across the sector, coffee quality and its preparation techniques have drastically improved but Starbucks has not kept up.

The best in the nation to me is in Breezewood, PA...just saying.)  The condiments at this Starbucks were well stocked and they had those littler green choking hazard things that plug the hole in the coffee cup lid to keep the coffee from spilling. Would that the artisanal coffee houses I love had those little green things. Best Starbucks innovation ever!!! \\n\\nSo why three stars for such a lukewarm review? The customer service was fantastic. Without fail the staff were all so nice, cheerful, and moved with alacrity. Even though the line was long (hello hundreds of obnoxious parents from a huge volleyball tournament), it moved quickly.

She was wrestling with the age old Korean version of the Gordian Knot of Jjajang-myun or Jjam-bbong (they sadly did not have the Jjajja-myun option). She opted for the jjam-bbong, as I knew she would. I ordered the regular old jjajjang-myun and we ordered the sweet and sour pork (tangsooyook). Sadly when our dishes came, it was the kkampoonggi, which we did not order. The waitress double checked, but she said sorry this is what you ordered.\\n\\nI know for a fact we didn't, because we came with the express intent of ordering tangsooyook which we had been craving. The waitress didn't try to make any ammends because she incorrectly assumed that's what we ordered, when I know beyond a shadow of a doubt she's the one that entered the information wrong into the computer.\\n\\nAside from that service was average. Two servers were working, and for a short while both of them went to the back, while customers lined up to get seated for lunch leaving them waiting. The Waitresses seemed busy, and overloaded for the amount of customers they had to deal with. We had to wait to get our water, extra napkins etc. At this point you're better off expecting to wait a bit for extra service.\\n\\nCan't really complain about the food (that I had at least), except my wife noticed the jjam-bbong soup was really salty. Almost to the point where it seems like it's made from a packaged ramen soup base. You know that taste, when you get the bottom of the bowl you take a hearty sip and you can feel the sodium course through your veins. Aside from that she said it was alright. The jjajjang-myun was probably the better entre of the two.\\n\\nFor the two of us it came to roughly $40 after taxes, which in my opinon is very pricey for what you get. I do believe it's half price on weekdays, Monday to Thursday for lunch.Do yourself a favor and visit this place during the week, at lunch."},{"name":"Chewies Steam & Oyster Bar - Kits","address":"2201 W 1st Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Walking inside, \\"Chewies\\" is brimming with people, and chances are you are expected to wait to be seated. The wise, like ourselves make reservations to circumvent the above. The restaurant is linear. We were are given a table in the back, having to step up onto the risen floor to get to it. The space was tight and our conversation was kept to a minimum. We ended in shouting matches, trying to get heard over all the voices enjoying themselves. \\nThe bar was the hub of the place. Not only did it host local craft brews, but behind it was spacing set aside for fresh seafood offerings. Crustaceans and mollusks were put on display, as they chilled on ice. \\nUnfortunately we were unable to enjoy a more immersed conversation with our server. It was a busy night and there was the need to track a separate body down to hail him over. Considering the rowdy crowd tonight and the large party seated in the same section, this was excusable. \\n\\nI love ceasars, and the prospect of getting one a little different than all others is an opportunity I cannot miss. At \\"Chewies\\" they do theirs as a parallel to their seafood, with lemon and horseradish. The grilled prawn was a lovely touch and a fantastic nod to their food and theme. Spicy, tomatoey, heavy on the spiced rim, and with the bite of vodkas hidden. Just the way I like my ceasars. \\n\\nWe had a variety of 4 oysters in a half shell, as seasonally available. Our server explained the difference in tastes and notes in each of the ones that we had selected. I cannot remember the specifics but the two smaller ones were supposedly on the sweeter side. Truth be told I was unable to tell the difference when I added the lemon, horseradish, and home made sauces that accompanied them. I appreciated the effort put into the presentation, if only for 4 half shells. I feel oysters are one of those things you eat for the added prestige and texture, not necessary for the taste. \\n\\n\\nWould I come back? - No. The travel to and hassle in carrying out the elusive parking hunt is enough to discourage the lazy girl in me. The food was good, but nothing I couldn't get else were. I found nothing wow-ed me and nothing left on the menu encouraged a return visit based on curiosity. \\nWould I recommend it? - Yes. It is in a lovely area. And a meal at \\"Chewies\\" would be great after an afternoon at Kits beach. I like their designation as a steam and oyster bar, this gives them a distinction that sets them a part. And they have a great selection of cocktails and speciality brews available to accompany all yours dishes.

I asked for a vegetable to replace the asparagus. Waitress said the asparagus was a \\"garnish\\" so no. The menu describes dish as chicken topped with \\"grilled asparagus\\".  I said that I always ate the asparagus & did not think it was a garnish. She said it was so no replacement & did I still want the dish. HUH? So I got the chicken because I didn't want to have to look at the menu again. But seriously, are you kidding me? Waitress never asked if we wanted refills on our drinks so I'm thinking maybe she was just a bad waitress.

Got the commuter croissant and hazelnut coffee. The commuter croissant breakfast sandwich was quite generous with the portions of bacon and eggs, and the croissant was crispy-- though overall the flavor was just ok. Coffee was fine.

The menu looked really good and we were excited to try this place.  We arrived and were greeted by about 3 or 4 servers who were standing near the entrance.  They were all smiles and pleasant attitudes, so we felt like we were off to a good start.  After being seated, our server gave us a couple of minutes and brought us some water.  We ordered our food and sat back to wait for our appetizers.\\n\\nAfter about 15-20 minutes, our appies arrived.  The prawn & scallop ceviche was very nicely presented in a martini glass garnished with a slice of lime and a deep-fried pita chip (or similar).  It also came with a bowl of multi-coloured tortilla chips.  Weird.  They tasted stale, so we didn't bother with them.  The ceviche was the worst I've ever had.  There were pre-cooked prawns mixed in with the raw scallops and lots of pickled jalapenos, radish and some avocado.  A very odd combination, but we were so hungry we ate it anyway.  The pita chip was the best part.\\n\\nThe spring rolls were arranged on a plate with two dipping sauces and a little mini 'salad' in the middle.  A couple of the spring rolls had been cut up to look nice on the plate - too bad they were lukewarm.  When the server came back, we told her they were almost cold and asked for some hot ones, but when they returned, it was only the old ones (the ones that had been cut up!) re-fired in the deep fryer. Shameful. We ate a couple of bites off the new ones, but left the re-heated ones on the plate.\\n\\nOur entrees took about 15 minutes to arrive after our plates were cleared.  I had the short ribs with mashed potatoes and my friend had the arctic char with rice pilaf.  My veggies consisted of beets and zucchini while hers was a combination of roasted peppers and asparagus.  The veggies were BY FAR the best thing on the plate.  The short ribs actually tasted like stewing beef that hadn't been cooked long enough and looked like a dog's breakfast.  It wasn't seasoned well, and I couldn't put my finger on what it tasted like - but it wasn't very good.  After tasting my friend's over-cooked and greasy char, I really didn't want to send my food back, for fear of getting something worse.  It must have been an off day for me, because normally I would've just refused to eat or pay for such a meal, and another part of me was just really looking forward to the deep-fried banana for dessert.  Who can ruin a deep-fried banana, right?  Hurricane Grill's chef can, that's who.  It was sliced and nicely presented, but it wasn't even warm, let alone hot - as it should've been.  The caramel sauce and ice cream were good, and the banana tasted okay, but it should have been great.  I guess from now on, I'll stick to the Thai restaurants for really good fried bananas.  \\n\\nMy friend's pumpkin 'mousse' tasted like pumpkin pie smushed up, and was nothing like a mousse at all, but it looked pretty in the martini glass.  The gingerbread cookie that came with it was kind of a weird texture, but I guess they are at least consistent in the fact that everything tasted a little bit 'off'.  I give them 8 out of 10 for presentation and 2 out of 10 for taste.  At least the service was good; our water glasses never went empty and our server was very friendly and always smiling.\\n\\nI probably wouldn't go back to the Hurricane Grill, given the fact that the menu was so simple and yet nothing was well-executed.  For the first time in a long time, (and probably the ONLY time in a restaurant) I ate a whole meal because I was hungry and tired, not because I liked the food.  I am giving 2 stars because the service was good, otherwise I'd have given only one."},{"name":"Churrascaria Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"1000 Universal Studios Plz","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I agree, a Brazilian Steakhouse can be hit or miss.

Our server told us that it was actually 1 inch thick medallions, not one piece of meat.  We ordered them medium.  They were 1/4 inch thick and well done.  The meat was just okay and the sauce overpowered the dish.  The mashed potatoes and spinach were good.  The other two people at our table got the ribeye and the pork tenderloin.

I had the duck with pomegranate-port glaze and duck confit sweet potato mash.  It was outstanding: large pieces of juicy duck breast cooked perfectly at a medium.

The venue was a great idea but other than the spectacular view (unfortunately partially obstructed when looking down, by roof supports) the room itself is bland.  The service is first rate, but the food I'm sorry to say is nothing you won't see at at least a handful of other upscale buffet brunches.  Breakfast foods (including cooked to order omelets and waffles), carving table, seafood/cheese/fruit, hot lunchtime dishes, salad and veggies, dessert table.  An interesting addition in three Indian dishes (chicken masala, a lentil dish, and steamed white rice) and Naan bread.  And a dessert table that was a disappointment -- the bite-sized pastries I've seen on party platters at Trader Joe's.  Don't get me wrong, the food was okay but just nothing special.  One good thing, the champagne seemed to be limitless.  But I'm telling you at $66 a head I wanted to be wowed by the cuisine as well as the atmosphere and service, and I wasn't.

I had been wanting to eat here for quite awhile, and invited a friend out for dinner.  First, we arrived with a reservation and the hostess got an attitude with me when I requested a table out of the main pathway to the restrooms.  Our waitress took our order, the food was brought out and we were on our own.  The only other time our waitress came by was to bring our check.  So, I would say the service was way below par.  More importantly, though, was the food.  It was just not good.  The beet and goat cheese salad had about 3 pieces of beet in it.  I could have made a better salad at home.  The garlic shrimp was the best part of the meal, but again was not exceptional.  The biggest disappointment was the lobster paella.  The lobster was in the shell, and when we asked the busboy for something to crack the shell with, he brought a small fork and said they didn't have anything to crack the shell.  If you are going to serve lobster in the shell, at least provide a way to get the meat out.  The rice in the paella was also greasy and gummy and not good.  \\n\\nI will never go back here.

Already, at this early stage, we felt very awkward and conspicuous.It turned out there were only two people working the floor that night. The waitress/bartender/hostess worked her ass off and was running from table to table, trying to keep things afloat. The other employee, who appeared to be only a clueless waiter, kind of wandered the room, occasionally staring at the wait-station computer. Instead of leaving, which we should have done, we decided to order.\\n\\nI got the 12oz ribeye, Caesar salad, and mashed sweet potatoes. \\n\\nThe Caesar was almost dressing-less, the croutons were flaccid (instead of toasted, I think they were just stale), but at least the lettuce was crisp.\\n\\nThe mashed sweet potatoes were bland and flavorless.

What I got was a sad steak that had been seared just enough to get grill marks, and then slapped onto a plate. The only seasoning was a few shakes of dried herbs (what the hell?) and 3 small bits of diced tomatoes. The steak quality seemed rather poor, and the fat was not carmelized in the least. The inside was so rare that I could have made a tartare out of it. I ate the steak, not being one to shy away from raw meat, but it was pathetic.  My wife pointed out that a greasy, side of the road truck stop sizzler could cook a better steak. \\n\\nShe ordered the 8oz sirloin, house salad, and broccoli.\\n\\nHer salad seemed okay. I just turned and asked her, and she said \\"it was fine.\\" \\n\\nHer broccoli was frozen broccoli that had been blanched long enough to bring it back to life. It was otherwise unseasoned.\\n\\nHer sirloin was also fine (and actually cooked medium rare, as she ordered it). However, the \\"blue cheese sauce\\" she ordered on the side was a cruel mockery of real sauces. They must use frozen sauce, or make up a large batch once a week and throw the rest in the cooler. It broke, horribly. It was flavorless, and ended up just putting an oily sheen on anything dipped in it (and what's more appetizing than an oily sheen on your steak?).\\n\\nWe never were offered any corn bread - the other tables seemed to have plenty.\\n\\nIt then took us a long time to cash out. Maybe 10-15 minutes. I don't blame the bartender/waitress, because she was the only person there who seemed to be working, but come on.\\n\\nThey also had live music. It was a guy sitting in the bar with a guitar and harmonic. He was okay, but it was uncomfortably loud, especially for a nearly empty restaurant on a Monday night. I felt kind of bad for him.\\n\\nI enjoy giving my money to local businesses. I really do. But I don't enjoy throwing my money away at a dive steakhouse masquerading as medium-high quality. I half expected Gordon Ramsey to be sitting at another table, complaining about the food. This place just can't justify their prices. The meal was over 50 bucks, and we didn't order any alcohol. If you know anything about food - stay away. Stay far, far away. If you like bland food, bad service, and an uncomfortable atmosphere, go to  some terrible chain restaurant off the interstate.

But the most memorable, was the damn poutine!  We actually came here on a rainy day after lunch at Japadog.  The storefront wasn't busy, but other couples came in as we were finishing up.  The owner is so friendly and an awesome guy to talk to.  After much talk over which item to get, we got the pulled pork and bacon.  The smallest size this one comes in is a regular, which was huge for $9 CAD, but of course we killed it!  \\n\\nThe pulled pork was so tender and everything is better with bacon!  The cheese curds melted from the heat of the gravy (love melted cheese) and the fries were crisp, but of course made a little soggy from the gravy. This one was also double layered. The gravy has a ton of flavor despite being veggie based.  So if you're vegetarian have no fear, you can indulge in poutine!  Besides having all types of poutine options from traditional to asian fusion options like Pad Thai & Kimchi to deep fried poutine, they also specialize in traditional Belgian fries with a wide variety of dipping sauces.  \\n\\nThe place is tiny with a few tables and open late for all the drunken folks.

The concept/location is great but there simply isn't value here.\\nOrdering beers both at the bar and during table service has been consistently poor, it takes awhile to receive the beer and 20% of it is foam. If this place is going to charge $9 per beer, the bartenders need to be better trained.\\nWe were a party of 5 who was sat immediately on a busy Sunday night while smaller-sized parties were quoted 20-30 minute wait times. Service, food and ambience was disappointing. Drinks (wine & beer) consistently arrived 10-15 minutes after ordering them. Food arrived 30 minutes after ordered and appetizers were served along with our entrees. The drunken dry-rubbed wings were very good, cooked crisp with a strong lime taste. The fried chicken salad and chili were also good. The 2 beef burger eaters in our group reported their meals to be fare. $1.50 was charged to add a piece of cheese, really? The accompanying tater tots were boring and mostly tasteless. Finally, to echo other reviews, the acoustics are loud. Overall, maybe a place to go for an occasional beer but there are far better dining options in the South End and other craft-beer on tap establishments within a few blocks of 5HT."},{"name":"Jonae's Island Twist","address":"4775 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy, Ste B","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Spent a week up here in Orlando .

The atmosphere is nice enough, if not exceptional, outstanding, or different from most other upscale American sushi bars in Florida. The service and quality of food is around the same: there was nothing at all to complain about, however, there was nothing really that was unique nor outstanding. The sushi we had was very fresh, made from fish that left no doubt in its quality however most of the rolls on the menu were the same tried and true American sushi variants filled with as many varied ingredients as the chef could stuff in between the nori and rice. This is not the traditional way of doing sushi in Japan, but I guess it's what most people want? \\n\\nThe waitress was fine: I told her that while not in a hurry, per se, we were not planning to linger and she made certain everything was done in a prompt manner. I know my fish and all the fish at the sushi bar (we sat up at the bar) looked impressive in its quality and tasted the same when my sushi dinner ichi meal came. Nothing at all that I could complain over, but again, I would like to see more variants of fish (I know they're hard to source in Florida though) and more rolls and nigiri with an emphasis on the fish itself instead of things like California rolls covered in scallops which are in turn covered in a sauce. One reason why sushi is not cooked is to allow the fish's flavors through, which is pretty much impossible when you throw a strong sauce over the whole affair.\\n\\nI would though strongly suggest this as a fun place to eat post-shopping in Orlando with friends. It's by far one of the better restaurants near the Mall at Millenia. Also, the menu--including non-sushi offerings from the kitchen like chicken or pork katsu--is extensive and their list of sake and other wines is robust."},{"name":"Anne & Bill's Restaurant","address":"1057 Main St, Ste A","city":"Forest Park","stars":"4","text":"My mother and I went here for lunch after sadly discovering that the Oakwood Cafe at the Farmer's Market in Forest Park had closed.

Seriously though, those Big Macs in the ads look so amazing, and so does the sushi at Oppa. Sadly, if you actually buy the sushi you'll be disappointed. You're better off just eating with your eyes for free, and then when you decide to spend some money on real food you can just go elsewhere.\\n\\nThere's so many things that I just didn't enjoy, but comparing the sushi to what a Big Mac ad is to McDonald's is the most accurate way to describe my experience. You know that feeling when the meat patty just looks so succulent and delicious in the ad, but when you actually take a bite of the real thing you have to grab a gulp of Coke because it was so dry you almost choked? That's essentially how I feel right now. \\n\\nThis was quite possibly the worst sushi experience I've ever had. Its one thing if one or two pieces from a roll break down, but if literally every piece breaks when I look at it, its not going to be a good time. I'm not Asian in the most traditional sense, the country that my parents are from (India) just accidently slammed into mainstream Asia, but because my wife is Asian and my chopstick skills are decent. So, let's not blame that. Then there's the scallops that had the texture of mushy peas and the tempura rolls that were hardly crunchy.\\n\\nLook, I get it, with rolls like, \\"Patriots\\" roll and \\"Red Sox\\" roll, you're collectively making all of Boston orgasm at the sight of the respective team colors. However, some of us like our food to taste just as good, if not better, than the way it looks. This isn't an impossible feat, there's plenty of restaurants that live up to their pictures.

My sister reserved the room for my husband and I so that our rooms could be next to each other. When I arrived (a few days after my sister; she was attending a conference) I explained that we were paying for our own room, gave them my credit card and reward number for Marriott and discussed the pricing at $139/night for the double bed standard room. Upon checkout at 1200, the pricing on the bill was $199/night plus taxes. I asked again why was a higher price given and not the advertised price of $139/night. Renee, the front desk staff said that was the conference pricing and tried to change the pricing on the computer because we were not part of the conference and when she could not do it she told me that she would get back to be in a \\"little bit\\" with an answer. I gave her my phone number and email. At 1900 that night, I had not heard from her and called the hotel. I was then put in contact with the front desk manager, Michael Matthews who was incredibly unprofessional. He refused to listen to the situation and told me that he would have to contact Renee the next day when she arrived to work and ask what she told me and if in fact she said that she would change the pricing, she would be in \\"trouble for that.\\" At 1300 the next day, Michael left a message on my phone saying that the room was booked under a conference rate and not a standard rate and there was no way for the pricing to be changed and he said that Renee never said that she would check into the pricing. I am sure she did not admit to this if he was going to reprimand her for helping me the day before. He refused to listen to my reasoning the day before and understand that I had nothing to do with the conference. Also why would the conference pricing be MORE than the pricing listed on their website. Sounds like a way to screw over guests that are attending conferences there. In addition, this hotel charges a \\"resort fee\\" for $25/day for things like transportation to Disney (at very set times that are not flexible), breakfast for kids under 12 for free, \\"high\\" speed internet. This is a complete joke! The high speed internet was the SLOWEST that I have seen in a long time (like dial up). We do not have children under 12. Therefore, the resort fee was a completely not worth it. You can get an Uber for $8-10 to the Disney parks. We wanted to go swimming in the pool. It started sprinkling rain and they blew the horn requiring everyone to get out. There was no inclement weather like thunder or lightening and the pool was closed until the sun was completely out later in the day. Although the buffet breakfast was quite extensive with many options, it was $24/PP. That is a ludicrous price for hotel breakfast. \\n\\nI would highly recommend that no one book a conference here or a personal stay for that matter. There are disney hotels with much better benefits, customer service, and fair pricing, not to mention free transportation. I plan conferences for a major healthcare association and we will NEVER book or a here or at a Marriott after finding out that they are completely unfair with their conference member pricing. The management, specifically Michael should have listened to the customers concerns and come to a middle ground considering I had nothing to do with the conference. He was unprofessional in his demeanor by telephone and the way that he handled this situation. I will most likely also never stay in another Marriott again. I was a loyal customer for many years, but there are many other hotels to choose from when you travel."},{"name":"Caff√© Medici","address":"200 Congress Ave, Ste 2B","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great cortado, done right.

I'm not going to pull any punches and tell you that I would pay full price for any of the entrees, because I think they are vastly over-priced. I say that solely because I cook with a lot of all natural/organic/wild ingredients so I'm pretty used to spending a lot of money for food, but I therefore am pretty familiar with the realistic cost of this type of food. \\nIf you don't care about price, come here. The food is always impeccably cooked. Every steak, scallop, chicken, or pork I've ordered has been perfection as far as appearance and temperature. Flavor profiles are always interesting; the rotation of chefs at Disney is not always a bad thing.\\nAnyways, as this was my first time dining here after a new dietary restriction has gripped my life, I was scared I couldn't eat anything. The chef, Russell, came out and said he would be happy to find some alternatives for me, and after telling him what I would like to have he gave me a couple of replacement options for the dishes I had selected. It was very comforting knowing I could eat the majority of what appealed to me, with only minor changes.\\nA personal note: I love pork. I love all varieties, preparations, styles... give me bacon or chops, I'm happy. The way to my heart, however - well-cooked pork belly. The art of selecting a belly with a good balance of fat and meat is something to be admired, and even further that perfect crunchy crisp that makes my insides melt when I bite into it.\\nArtist Point currently has a pork belly confit that made me glow. It's served with a berry gastrique, and an onion relish, also typically a blintz, of which I could not partake. It didn't need that blintz, in fact it would have just been an impediment in the delight my taste buds were rejoicing in from the dish. Additionally they were offering a beet salad. If this is the first time you're trying beets I wouldn't recommend it, because the dish really honors the purity of beet flavor and texture. If you enjoy beets, do it. They were practically creamy with the dressing in comparison to the bitter accompanying endive. \\nI really enjoyed it.\\nEntrees!  Happy day... the Northwest Trio: buffalo, venison, and wild game sausage. Great flavors, although the venison was gamey in comparison to other venison filets I've had. It was served with little marble potatoes instead of a mashed potato for me, and I really enjoyed the little potatoes. Mashed potatoes would have been too filling with such rich proteins. It also had the same berry gastrique that I'm dying to get the recipe for. \\nWe also ordered a scallop entree. I did not get partake in the accompanying risotto, but from what my dining companions said, I didn't miss anything. I decided to take the risk and try the sauce that lined the edge of the dish. The sauce had a very distinctly asian influence on my palate, a soy and ginger flavor, which in my mind does not favor a creamy mushroom risotto full of pickled onions. When Russell, the chef, offered to replace the risotto with a plain jasmine rice, I feel that it would have been a much better dish. The scallops were cooked perfectly and plainly...a simple scallop seems to be an art these days, so I'm proud to say that it was a job well done on scallop preparation. \\nOn to dessert, a dairy-free version of the berry cobbler. I was happy. It isn't quite the same flaky puffy pastry that you might be used to because of the lack of butter, but I thoroughly enjoyed the replacement of berry sorbet over blackberry ice cream. My dining company ordered the trio of creme brulee. The results? White chocolate basil... too much basil, it was \\"like [eating] basil cheesecake\\", the mocha was a winner, and classic chocolate was lovely, but not as delightful as the mocha.\\nOur service was fine, nothing spectacular or devastating. I wouldn't necessarily request the same server again, but pretty attentive and patient, as I am a long-term diner (3-4 hours).\\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant is always nice. Despite the facts that it is mostly hard surfaces and a high ceiling, it is pretty quiet in there. There were not many children in there any of the times I've eaten there, and if they were they were a bit older or quite quiet, so I approve! \\nAll in all an enjoyable experience, and I will definitely go again when the next menu change occurs."},{"name":"Ranch 616","address":"616 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"So, probably because building renovations scared off some customers, Ranch 616 was issuing a pretty deep-discount Groupon a while back. We'd never heard of it, and probably wouldn't have gambled regular price on it, but tonight thought--$30 off and day five of my birthday, so what the hey?\\n\\nSo, first impressions: animal trophy heads with hats on the wall and Virgen de Guadalupe candles on the table: points for not taking yourselves too seriously. It's Austin and nobody needs stuffy. \\n\\nWe  are sort of greeted upon entry by a doe-eyed hostess and a guy who might be a manager. It's hard to say. They act vaguely as if we are interrupting their conversation, and I start to wonder if this is one of those places staffed by pretty people not hugely interested in their jobs. I am not a fan of this ethos generally, and less so when food costs $35-$40 an entree, a price point in Austin at which, paradoxically, this attitude seems to increase rather than lessen. It ain't Paris. Knock that off.\\n\\nThis perception is reversed somewhat by out server (Jaycee? J.C.? J.Z.? I'm old and don't hear so good). She is super helpful in explaining the rules of our coupon (it doesn't actually exclude all the best stuff, as it says; it just makes you pay the difference--fair enough) and is nice and likes to talk about the food. However, either she's a little forgetful (water, anyone?) or someone else is. It's hard to say. \\n\\nWe are told that the cocktails are made without mixers and tend tart. I'm a fan of the style, and, sure enough, we get, strong and tasty and nice-looking cocktails, not overly sweet. They're a little steep, but I switch to beer, which is more reasonable. \\n\\nThe food we order (black mussels, pollo soup, mixed seafood grill, no-flour chocolate cake) is very good, if also a bit pricey, although portions are huge for fine dining. I'm also not a fan of dropping a c-note for two and leaving hungry, and there is no danger at all of that here. Some appetizers and a shared plate might not be a bad strategy. \\n\\nThere are some weird menu choices--fried and breaded mussels? Why would you even do that? Deep frying is for cheap things. Some of the presentation needs work as well (tortilla strips over said mussels--wtf, Ranch 616?). But on the whole, it's easily one of the better meals that I've had in town, and Ranch 616 pulls off the quirky-hipster-charm thing it's going for pretty well. Would I come back at regular price? I ain't got that kinda scratch, man. But if I did, I'd be tempted to drop some of it here once and again.

They're not supposed to cost you as much as a full entree at another restaurant, but now I'm just getting off track.\\n\\nIt was my first time in Austin, and I got reunited with a bunch of friends and it was a great place to go to for the reunion!"},{"name":"Dots Cafe","address":"2521 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I'm hoping you won't notice the full set of stars I have given Dots. You will instead read this travesty of a review and go on your merry way, never to darken the door of Dots and take a table I might want...... \\n\\nDots has one of the ugliest decors I've ever seen. I personally prefer a clean modern look and theirs is the opposite of that. All retro, with rare velvet paintings and posters of crappy bands like The Beatles. Who would ever be into that?\\n\\nTheir menu is idiotic. They try to have something for everyone. It doesn't matter if its all good bordering on freakin fantastic. I eat meat and I resent a place accommodating the lower classes of society like vegans. They don't deserve good food, honestly what is Dots thinking?\\n\\nThe drinks are bordering on insane. I moved to Portland because its supposed to be the beer capitol of the world. I have experienced a very elitist snobbish attitude about the quality of portland liquor in other fine dining establishments. I prefer it that way, people should drink quality or go home. A prerequisite for me is, I  ask if they have something like Malibu Rum available and if they do, then i'm out the door. I will not spend my hard earned money in a place that tries to cater to everyone. So you can imagine how horrified I was when Dots had drinks like the purple ice slush. What the hell?! Is this kindergarten? I want my locally made IPA from organic hops that were snuggled with at night and told they were loved. Nothing but the best for this girl.\\n\\nThen there is the wait staff. Look I get it, you seem to enjoy your job and in turn have a happy relaxed attitude with your customers. Some of us are not that lucky, so if you could turn it down just a notch. I also happened to notice this has been addressed in another review from one Blanche A. I have to tell you if any of you EVER approach my table dancing and trying to share that you like a song. Not only will I call the police, I will have you personally thrown out of Portland proper. The very thought of the happiness and delight...well it horrifies me......I'm shaking with rage right now. ...Dancing??!!

The chips and lentils were fantastic (yet very small) and came out quite quickly, as well as our first round of drinks. I think it was about 35 minutes after that for the next plate and about 45 for the next drink. They seemed a bit disorganized because the waiter came out to ask if we had received the plates yet. So the wait was an issue. But what knocked the stars off for me was that it was so LOUD. Wow, my head was pounding because I couldn't hear and I was screaming so that people at my table could hear.

Those previous did not make me want to crawl into a hole and live out the rest of my days on instant ramen and frozen food. This one did.

Order for 2 Teriyaki Chicken Bento Boxes, and a Rainbow roll. I noticed the delivery time was selected for 8:00PM, which was the earliest time available. That already was kind of disappointing, but it was a Friday night - so excusable.\\n\\nWhat started the annoyance chain was the button on the checkout page to enter your email address and instantly have $5 taken off your order.

They offer to cancel my Teriyaki chicken. At this point it's been over 2 hours and I just want them to cancel the whole check. they offer me \\"Edamame\\". That was the last straw. Edamame is a cheap freaking SOYBEAN! Cheap bastards. For a $40 dinner, this is crappy service. Supposedly they're going to cancel my order and rebill me for the food I got. That is exactly how you make me vent on Yelp. \\n\\nWord Limit.\\n\\nTeriyaki chicken needs to be grilled, it needs to have a sweet, tasty glaze. This was devoid of all characteristics of true teriyaki. It was white, overcooked, and devoid of any caramelization. It takes effort to describe the tastelessness of the chicken. How it was possible to produce chicken that was both overcooked and uncaramelized is curious, especially considering the sweet glaze. Teriyaki sauce came in a horrifying lumpy soup that refused to stick to the chicken.\\n\\nRice - cooked okay, bit dry, but hey it was probably the second best part.  It's owned by an Asian family - any Asian kid learns how to cook rice from their mother or father. If you can't manage to soak up that one tiny gem of your ancestral knowledge - you've really screwed up somewhere. So yeah - it was rice and it was edible.\\n\\nSushi rice - may as well have been cooled normal rice. No sushi rice flavor whatsoever. Failed to clump. The flavor of sushi rice is absolutely essential to temper the flavors of the fish. It is critical to have good rice texture and flavor to appreciate the goodness of the fish.

I would've like a stronger cheese flavor.  It kind of gets lost in the waffle.\\n\\nCajun Chicken - The true star of the place.  I think they put some maple syrup in the chicken batter, the slaw is crisp and fresh, and the waffle compliments beautifully.\\n\\nPastrami - This was classic pastrami, but it was good.  Light cheese element, and the only waffle to come with a pickle.\\n\\nSausage and Peppers- This was a contender for best.  The andouille sausage and the onions and cheese were delicious, but the fact that it was in a waffle was a bit secondary.\\n\\nWaffle Nachos - Nothing incredible.  Waffle fries, nacho cheese, sour cream, and a little bit of bacon.  Nothing bad about them, I could eat them all day, but they weren't particularly special.\\n\\nNote on the waffles: I've seen some descriptions of these as \\"belgian waffles.\\"  These are not (at least to my understanding) belgian waffles.  They are very reminiscent of waffle house waffles, only the batter is a little more flavorful.\\n\\nI'm really digging on this place, and I like a lot of what they're doing.  I hope they become braver in the coming months, and try some new things that will really tie the waffle in more.  Right now it's kind of like \\"It's a sandwich....ON A WAFFLE.\\"  What I'd prefer is if the waffle really was the absolute perfect bread for each sandwich (this is the case with the cajun chicken).\\n\\nHaven't tried the dessert ones yet, but they all looked divine.

Well patroned by locals, Busy Bee has also had a fair share of famous visitors as well--photos of which are proudly displayed along the side of the restaurant (Obama visited, twice).\\n\\nLogistics: there's two adjacent but small  parking lots for customers but spots can be hard to find at times. Also, it's cash only so come prepared or be ready to use the ATM inside ($3 fee). \\n\\nSpace: The restaurant is more or less one narrow but deep dining room with counter seating to the left, booths to the right, and movable tables in the center. Suitable for small to medium sized parties, but larger groups might be harder to accommodate or require a longer wait. They also do catering as well as a lot of to-go and take out orders, at least during the lunch rush, as another option.\\n\\nIt's pretty bustling here, but they do their best to get people in and out as efficiently as possible. Service is friendly but busy, so do them a favor and get to the point with your order. Right when we came in, the host was quick to greet us and put us down for a table. Waits seem likely, as there is limited seating, but it was only about 15-20 minutes for our party of 3 at 1pm on a weekday. I also noticed a lot of people there with luggage, so it's definitely beloved enough that people make it a point to eat here coming from or before heading to the airport. I don't blame 'em. This born and raised Southern girl got down at Busy Bee. It is VERY good AND reasonably priced.\\n\\nFood & Drink: we tried a couple of items for lunch, all were great, but the real stand outs to me were: the fresh squeezed lemonade ($3.25), fried chicken (one of THE best in Atlanta; plate with 2 sides is $14 or $16 for a half chicken), collard greens, fried okra, yams, and banana pudding ($5). Complementary cornbread muffins for the table were a nice touch too. The only thing I wasn't super enthused about was the peach cobbler.

I thought it was very interesting that a restaurant at the ferries that was by no means a French restaurant would serve escargot, and I had to order it and try it out. It came with 6 pieces and had quite a few pieces of pita bread on the side. I wasn't expecting the pita and it was a pleasant surprise, especially since it tasted so good! The escargot themselves were cooked nicely and had a good flavour, and dipping the pita into the garlic butter was delightful. For $9, this was a steal! The calamari was also a very good value given the amount of calamari on the plate. They were nicely battered and the tzatziki sauce was nice and tangy.  \\n\\nThe prices are definitely reasonable and this is a great little gem of a place to stop by while waiting for the ferries or any occasion for that matter.

We walk in without reservations and were seated right away which was nice, being a party of only two helped a bit.  In looking at the menu just about everything thing  was out of my company's per diem for the whole day so my dinning partner and I decided to bite the bullet and splurge and go all our for our dinner and have the shrimp, scallops and lobster special.  We started off with the chicken soup which was nice, next came the Mikado salad with ginger dressing which was fresh and had a nice clean flavor to it.  Soon the teppan-yaki chef came out to begin cooking our meal.  He started the fried rice and veggies, all which was cooked perfectly nothing accidentally burnt like you can sometimes get at other teppan-yaki styled places.  Next came the shrimp appetizer again cooked perfectly while entertaining everyone at the table.  Finally the main course everything was delicious and mouth watering, the scallops were perfect and the lobster was to die for I savored every bite.  Our special came with dessert and I wanted the green tea ice cream, unfortunately for me they ran out so I decided on the fried ice cream it was ok too chewing for me but not that bad.  The food was great the service not so great, our server had a few tables and once the cooking started she disappeared and so did my beverage and I needed a refill but she was no where to be found, finally she comes around and ask for a refill only to have to wait about five minutes for it.  Again this restaurant is in a \\"resort\\" with \\"resort\\" prices but the fact that an 19% gratuity was automatically added to the bill didn't sit well with me, if the service was excellent and deserved 19% I wouldn't have minded but it wasn't, again if I'm going to have to pay \\"resort\\" prices I'd expect five star food and service which this was not."},{"name":"Congee Noodle House","address":"141 E Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I went here on few weeks ago (April 13th) and just wanted simple tasty Wonton Noodle.

Several years later we reserved part of the restaurant for a party to celebrate my mother-in-law's ninetieth birthday.  A few years after that my wife and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary there.\\n\\nThe food was always top-notch and the atmosphere was comfortable.

I am not sure if the restaurant failed to find a market in the new economy and I'm certainly glad it didn't try to reinvent itself as some sort of hipster-dufus martini bar.  That said, I found myself not placing Sabra on my go-to restaurant list. Perhaps it was the location, Newton Center, that is not that easy to get to from where I live.  And maybe that is the point.  The physics of restaurants these days is that you need a sort-of \\"attractor dynamics\\" that pull you to a distant neighborhood.  The neighborhood itself could be the attractor, as the North End is, for example, or the restaurant could provide its own, e.g. \\"Posto is serving brunch? I'm there, dude!\\".   Whatever.

The waitstaff definitely seem to be on the ball in terms of knowing exactly what each dish is all about, and is generally ready to make recommendations on wine accompaniments.  And if they don't know, they will try to find an answer for you.

It's on the lower floor of the Mohr & McPherson furniture store, which I realize sounds bananas. It's perhaps helpful to know that the M&M oeuvre is comprised of gorgeous Asian furnishings both rustic and refined, many of which look like they have capital-h History. There is also a beautifully curated selection of jewelry and textiles from all over. So the store itself a pleasure to explore--and as a bonus, the coffeeshop is furnished with items in its inventory. \\n\\nWhat this means--are you sitting down?--is that there is a real live daybed in the coffeeshop, in which customers are welcome to curl up against a pile of pillows and pretend they are a dowager Empress for an entire afternoon. Or, you know, read.\\n\\nThis alone would be enough to get this place high marks, but there are many, many other good things about it. The coffee and coffee drinks here are very good, and the loose tea selection (you can buy a cup or a personal teapot) is excellent. The pastry case is full of tasty salads, sandwiches, and pastries, and I think there may be soup on offer. There's also a great collection of snacks made by local producers (Q's Nuts, which I adore; Lark cookies; Effie's Oatcakes; Taza chocolates; ice cream of many flavors from a local creamery; and lots of others). Almost anyone should be able to find something appealing to eat here.\\n\\nI've been here mostly on weekends, and there's always space to sit at one of the tables. The service is friendly, crisply efficient, and surprisingly easygoing, and the bathroom is nearby. The Wi-fi is free, and because the place is never packed, I never feel pressured to feed and flee--it's one of the few places left where you really can linger over conversation or work, and this is truly a delight.\\n\\nSpeaking of bathrooms, if you've never tried one of those fancy Japanese toilets, there's one in the upper-floor bathroom.

There were many questions to be had about the menu items, and he did a great job answering them. \\n\\nHe was a really good sport with all that we asked of him. He even served my friend a phalic-like dessert we prepared for her, although he didn't get through it without laughing. \\n\\nEveryone enjoyed their food. I will only mention a couple items we consumed. We had the fried calamari for an appetizer. It was good, but I've had better calamari. The menu specifically says \\"lightly fried,\\" so I don't blame them too much, but I like my calamari a little more fried. It tasted like it wasn't cooked all the way. \\n\\nThis may seem like a silly thing to rave over, but the bread they serve before the meal is heavenly. I'm not even a crazy bread freak, but I loved this stuff. It was focaccia served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and kalamata olives. I inhaled it.\\n\\nI had the Bastas Burger with avocado. It was good, again I've had better. I thought it was a bit silly to charge extra to add tomato to a burger. I am more understandable with avocado, but tomato is a weird thing to charge extra for. The fries and mustard that came with the burger were very good. \\n\\nThe most fun of all the dishes was the Ciuppin. It's a seafood soup with fresh clams, calamari, shrimp and other seasonal fresh fish. It was the kind of meal where you have to work a little with your food, and get more involved (I always think it's a great excuse to play with my food. I begin to treat them like action figures, giving them names and unique voices when they talk to one another). \\n\\nThe Ciuppin had the clams and mussels in the shells, with a shrimp, head and all, standing upright in the middle of the seafood assortment. I will see if I can put a picture of it on here later.\\n\\nI felt really comfortable at this restaurant. I can only speak for the room to the left of the entrance as far as the feel of the place.

This is not a distaste for oysters.\\n\\nThe pork tenderloin was cooked perfectly-- that I can't deny them.  But with such alluring ingredients in the dish, I really was hoping for a dynamic flavor profile.  Again, I found this dish to be mostly flavorless.  If I ate a piece of pork with nothing else I could extract the sweet honey flavor, but it got completely lost with the savory mushrooms and mashers.  There was an overwhelming amount of mushrooms--- too much to finish.  I love portobellas but for some reason this pile of bellas didn't do anything for me at all. \\n\\nThe SO had the chicken fried beef tenderloin, and he said it really was lacking flavor despite the fact that the description seemed to be bursting with cholesterol ridden flavor enhancers ( bacon, cheese, etc).\\n\\nWe finished what we could of our food (and we're not typically the types to leave food on the plate), and then waited a lengthier than desirable amount of time for our check.

I'd been here once before but it was a couple years ago and I have no clue what I ordered the first time so I went with the Cure, their take on biscuits and gravy. The gravy was delicious and the biscuits were adequate (I had wanted to go to Pine State for breakfast but democracy won out so maybe that is why I wasn't feeling them as much). My Bloody was pretty good; the second one had some odd looking celery but it tasted fine so I can't knock it too much. The service was just OK (took ten minutes to get our second round), but it was at the end of the breakfast rush so I can be empathetic towards the staff taking that into consideration.

I never really understood the atmosphere this place was trying to create and he, having dropped out of a PhD program in philosophy, explained to me that it's \\"post-modernist.\\"\\n\\nWell, then.\\n\\nSince I stopped getting dragged there by this person I have only been back a few times but typically during the day and for food.  Kind of a disappointment.  Until my most recent experience it at least tasted good but it's always kind of...weird.  Like they're trying too hard to be nouveau and different.  Portions are pitiful for the prices they charge.  I mean pitiful.  I understand that you're in an upscale yuppie area where everybody's super skinny so if you want to offer European style portions, fine.  But don't charge MORE than what other restaurants are charging for Texas-sized portions, kthnx.\\n\\nI went today and had a burger at the bar.  It was $11 something which, for a really dressed up burger, ain't that expensive these days.  But it's a la carte so I ordered sweet potato tater tots on the side for an additional $3.50.  So a burger and pseudo-fries cost me more like $15.  My order of \\"tater tots?\\"  7.  7 pieces.  They were good, though they weren't really tater tots.  Texture was almost like an oyster only it tasted more like a cheese tamale, if that makes any sense. \\n\\nUgh but the burger was GROSS.  Gross.  First of all I ordered it medium and it was well beyond well.  I ate it anyway because I just wasn't in the mood to complain and I was starving.  And so far I'm not sick or anything but...it had this weird taste to it that meat sometimes has when it's \\"fake\\" grilled.  You know what I mean?  The hamburger wrap at Good Food Grill tastes the same way.  Or like it's been done on a Foreman.  And there was nothing on it.  It came with a single piece of lettuce and some caramelized onions on a bun.  No mustard; I had to split the pot of ketchup they provided between the burger and my tots so there wasn't enough.  No tomato, no mayo.  My favorite part was the pickle garnish.\\n\\nYet comparably priced to the stuffed burgers at Tavern on the Square which are delicious and complex and bigger than your damn face and come with fries and juicy and cheesy and BBQy and bacony...and pretty much whatever-you-want-y.  Or, for that matter, to the better priced and probably better made burger literally 3 doors down at O'Leary's.\\n\\nJust.  Bleh.  Also had brunch there once on the patio and sure, the atmosphere was nice, but I was completely underwhelmed by the food.  Just...why would you go here and pay for less when you could pay less for more at any number of excellent brunch establishments in this city (Aquitaine, Trident, Sonsie, Miracle of Science...Busy Bee Diner 2 doors in the opposite direction has a no frills pancake breakfast a linebacker wouldn't be able to finish for like...$3.)\\n\\nNo.  Just no.

They normally offer two different types of rice, 3-4 vegetarian choices and 2-3 meat choices. Unlike most food court places, the selection rotates daily so you never know what will be offered. While this may sound like a drawback to the casual visitor, for us regular patrons it's a huge advantage!\\n\\nThe food at Tumeric is always solid, and occasionally stellar. To be fair, this isn't the best Indian food in Atlanta, but it is probably the quickest and also affordable and cheap if you work near the Peachtree Center food court. Anywhere else and this may not be 5 stars, but solid food and good service is rare in a food court, so it's well deserved here!\\n\\nBecause Tumeric has to cater to the masses, you won't find any extremely spicy dishes. In general, the meat dishes seem to be better seasoned than the vegetarian options, but maybe I just like the meat, ha ha.\\n\\nOf the choices, the goat curry, chicken tikka masala, fish curry, chicken 65, paneer tikka masala, and daal are my favorites.

The last time I was there for an event the tea was generic with a tea bag, not the leaf kind so we were already happy.  The food was okay, standard 3 tier tray with sandwiches (the shrimp was my favorite and the fig), the dessert was okay, and the scones were just okay.  They were a quarter of a piece of scone, 2 varieties.  Chocolate covered strawberries were delicious, there was an apricot jelly I didn't care for.\\n\\nAll in all my favorite high tea location is the Boston Harbor.  The views are amazing, the service was great and they let you try another tea if you were done with your tea but still had food left.  At the Taj the waiter brought me more hot water to put in my old tea leaves and I had to ask for a regular glass of water after my water glass sat empty for a while.\\n\\nI'm glad I went back and experienced it again but don't think with the other options, I would go back.

Then I finally walked into Thurn's.\\n\\nI needed a Brisket to throw in the smoker, so I woke up early and looked at my list of butchers that I have been going through, with Thurn's being next up.

The man I spoke with was very friendly on the phone, and informative as well, listing different kinds of beef brisket as well as the prices.  I hung up and was in the car within 2 minutes.\\n\\nIf you are looking for some big fancy supermarket type place, go somewhere else.  This is a butcher, a meat shop, reminiscent of a place my grandfather used to take me to when I was just a lad up in Cleveland.  You are immediately hit with the aroma of smoked meats, cheeses, and sausages.  I was warmly welcomed upon entering, and a gentleman with a shirt, tie, and apron promptly helped me.  I told him what I was looking for, and he offered his professional opinion on a cut that he had ready to go.  He even took the time to tell me about the breed that the meat was cut from, seemingly as excited as I was.  I ended up with an 11.86 lb slab of heaven that will go in the smoker before the sun comes up tomorrow.\\n\\nI can safely say that I am done searching and have found my Butcher.  The prices and quality are great, the staff was very friendly, and it was easy to get to.  I fully understand the hours, as they are not that uncommon in butcher shop that smokes all their own meat.  It also helps that I am not one of these people that goes to a meat shop and expects it to be anything too fancy.

Did not try any of the desserts; I still ride my bike past early every morning and every time I see leftover cakes and treats still in the case. Many other reviewers have mentioned that the treats are dry; I suspect this is why. The decor and furniture is looking tired. The bathroom is ancient.

Also, the entire dish with the hushpuppies were so salty I was shaking off salt. Did they really think it needed extra salt? The fries were awful - they were so crispy and hollow (because they were overcooked). Whomever was working the deep fryer perhaps should be taken off that job or taught how to use it without killing the food. \\n\\nThe biscuits...well, these are the best biscuits in town. If you're one of those people that say they don't like biscuits because they're heavy, or they don't get what the hype is about, then Chewie's is definitely the place to go to amend your take on biscuits. They're super fluffy, delicious and the drizzle is to die for.\\n\\nThe cajun canoe was just...awful. I don't even know how else to describe it. That dish alone ruined our dinner. The overdone gator and hush puppies were irritating and the biscuits helped with our faith a little...but the cajun canoe was just...meh.

You know it's bad when someone's eating the salad more than literally a few bites of the canoe.

Their patio is awesome, its nice that they have fire pits for the colder nights, and they had a lot of seating.\\n\\nThey have an interesting atmosphere, I couldn't really tell what they were going for but it was definitely eclectic and had some cool photos all over the walls. In my dads words, \\"Some of the photos will make you blush!\\". I didn't notice anything too raunchy (but I may have missed it), and if anything the artwork was a conversation starter. \\n\\nI shared my meal with my cousin, I ordered the fish tacos and she ordered the vegetable quesadilla. With the quesadilla you get 2 sides which I thought was SUPER generous, so we ordered truffle fries and onion rings. The fish tacos were good, they needed some type of sauce on them though as they were a bit plain. The quesadilla was loaded with flavor, it was a delicious spicy sauce that they should have put on the fish tacos! I want the recipe for that sauce because I am still dreaming about it! The quesadilla also had tons of chopped veggies in it and beans, it was very filling which is rare for vegetable quesadillas. It was absolutely perfect! The truffle fries were delicious, but the onion rings were basically just very thin cooked onions with some bread crumbs that fell off. We didn't really end up eating those. \\n\\nOverall it was a great experience and I would likely go back.

Much like its competitor, Kobe, Ginza is primarily hibachi tables, with a small area for regular dining. I've been several times now, mainly at the suggestion of others, and it is just never quite perfect. \\n\\nFirst off, there are two entrances, and if you go in through the back, you're immediately in the dining area and have to find your way to the front. If you go in the entrance directly located on 50, you're at the right spot. \\n\\nEach time I've been, we've been seated immediately, and usually the only ones at the hibachi table where we're seated. Only two or three times have I been seated with people outside of our group. \\n\\nThe cooks prepare the food right in front of you on the table. The portions are huge, and usually I don't make it through even half of my food there at the restaurant. If you go in during their \\"Early Bird\\" specials time, you can get chicken, steak and shrimp for around $15. If you order sushi, that's made separately and brought over usually between salad & soup and your main course. The salad is good, but the dressing isn't as good as Kobe's, and the ingredients never taste quite as fresh. I think the dressing makes them a bit soggy looking and tasting. The miso soup is very good, though! For dinner, you get rice, noodles, and veggies with your meat. It does cost extra if you wish to substitute extra veggies in place of rice or noodles, or if you want to get just one type of veggie. I've never ordered dessert here; by the time dessert is a thing, I'm so full off carbs that I can't stomach the idea of eating another bite. \\n\\nTheir drinks are pretty averagely priced, but nothing particularly special about them. They do offer a full bar, which is pretty nice. \\n\\nSo, why the 3 star rating? Well. If you don't mind dining in a place that smells pretty yuck (moldy mop meets Asian cuisine), and you're ok with your food being so salty that you have to drown yourself in water, then by all means, go forth and enjoy!

Vinegar is not listed so I'm confused about what created the sour flavor. \\n\\nSouthwestern Corn Chowder - the sweet corn was a little overpowered by the herbs but I like this soup.  Maybe hold off on the heavy herb addition so the corn, meat and veggies can do the talking.\\n\\nSmoked Ham & Bean -  smoky and delicious with lots of bite-sized chunks of ham.  A tiny bit too salty for me but I still loved it.\\n\\nThis little business has the potential to become a brick and mortar someday. Flint's soup options are much more interesting than the Soup Peddler and when the weather gets warm, I plan to try some of the cool summery soups with a cold glass of Prosecco."},{"name":"The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf","address":"13376 N Highway 183, Ste 800","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"What a really great group of folks working here!

Been there three times and haven't been disappointed. \\n\\nFirst off, the congee. The choices are extensive and the portions are huge. I wouldn't be able to finish a bowl by myself; they're great for sharing. My favorite so far is the sea bass and Chinese parsley one! It's not salty, great to accompany the dishes and has plenty of fish.\\n\\nI've tried plenty of their dishes as well. My favorite is the salt and pepper fried cod. I have yet to find it on the menu, but I've always just showed them the picture and it was fine. The marinated duck was also pretty tasty. Their noodles are not the best so I would avoid them. The Chinese donuts are good with the congee, but could be a little crispier and fluffier. \\n\\nThe service is far from being the greatest.

The food is fairly consistently good. I've only had a couple instances where things were not up to par and I'm not going to bitch about that because it's hard for anybody to score 100 every time.\\n\\nThe 3-star rating above comes from the consistently, inconsistent service. Generally, if I ask for a table I get fairly good service. It's not consistent, but it's only been bad (extremely slow) one time. My issue comes from sitting at the bar. I have a couple friends who'd rather sit at the bar and have dinner instead of getting a table. Out of 10 or 12 times sitting at the bar I'd say we've got absolutely terrible service 7 or 8 times. When I say terrible service, I mean consistently ignored for long periods of time. Literally having to beg someone to let us order or bring us ketchup, etc.\\n\\nLast night we sat at the bar, not many other people there and were approached quickly. We ordered a pitcher of Bones Brew and 3 glasses. We got the pitcher and glasses... and then... poof! We were ignored for the better part of 20 minutes. Finally stopped one of the bar waitresses and said \\"WE'RE READY TO ORDER NOW\\". She looked irritated, but stopped and took our order. While we were waiting for our food, we noticed that they weren't playing music videos on any of the screens any more. One of my dining companions asked one of the inattentive waitresses why they took the music videos away and she acted like we'd just shit in her wheaties. Very snarky and just all-out irritated that we asked her that question. Hmm... there are 12 or 14 screens with duplicates of sports shows (I know some people enjoy those... I'm not one of them) but why can't they keep the vids on one screen? Just one?\\n\\nWe continued to get the stink-eye from the inattentive bar waitresses for the remaining time we were there. What was her problem????\\n\\nI realize I could just solve most of the problem by sitting at a table, but why should I avoid sitting somewhere I like just because somebody else isn't doing their job and policing the staff?\\n\\nIt's time to clean house at the bar Smokey Bones and get some people who actually care about what they are doing and don't have an attitude!!!!"},{"name":"Joe's On Juniper","address":"1049 Juniper St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Desperately looking for a to have late lunch after St paddy parade.

We came in on a Thursday night around 7pm -- just two of us. Sat at the bar. Pondered over the menu. Mentioned to Phil we were embarrassingly unfamiliar with Italian wines. He poured us each samplings of 4 different wines from light to full bodies. He described the region they were from, what they best accompany, and whatever other anecdotal information he had on hand. It was informative without pretension. I wasn't going to absorb the information -- but I certainly loved listening to it and feeling like some real passion existed both for the wines and the foods he was telling us about. \\n\\nWe started off with the green salad which was plenty for two to share. Also had the chicken ilver and caper crostinis. Much to my delight, the chicken liver did not have a pronounced caper flavor despite the whole capers within. They were subtle and allowed the liver to dominate my palette along with a drizzle of olive oil. \\n\\nWe then shared the Ricotta pizza with tomatos, garlic, onions, and our added mozzarella and egg. Wow, this pizza was good. I haven't had good pizza since moving out west. This was thin crust -- and the crust was actually tasty. \\n\\nFor dessert, we decided to skip the sweet stuff and have another order of the chicken liver crostini. Weird? Sure, maybe.

It's in the space formerly occupied by Little Azio, next door to Noodle in a small, single-story development at the corner of Peachtree St. and 8th St.  The three owners of Villains Wicked Heroes have worked at other popular Atlanta restaurants such as Grindhouse Killer Burgers, Flip Burger, and the now defunct HD1 (hot dogs).  The restaurant's name is a play on the word \\"hero\\" used is used to describe sandwiches in New York.\\n\\nI love the theme of the business which was inspired by cartoon, comic book, and movie villains.  The restaurant was designed to look sort of like an evil lair.  Inside, one of the walls is a giant blackboard with chalk scribblings on world domination.  There's all sorts of cool and funny artwork and decor, such as the tabletops which have white silhouettes of famous villains.  The sign for the men's restroom is Superman picking his nose and the sign for the ladies' restroom is Wonder Woman's underwear around her ankles (yes, she's on the commode).\\n\\nThere's a full, oval-shaped bar.  One half of the bar is outside and one half is inside.  It's a nice transition between the outdoor and indoor areas and makes the entire restaurant feel open and airy.  The patio has ample seating.  The atmosphere is casual and laid back.  The vibe is grungier and more alternative than a typical Midtown restaurant.  You'd expect to see a place like this in/around Little Five Points and Old Fourth Ward.  I'm glad it opened in Midtown though.\\n\\nOver a dozen sandwiches are available.  Each is named after a villain.  Examples: Odd Job from the James Bond movie Goldfinger, Montgomery Burns from The Simpsons, Clubber Lang from Rocky II, and Megatron from Transformers.  The salads are also named after villains, such as the Shredder from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are filling.  The rolls are about 8 inches and come from a local German baker.  The bread is great.  Slightly hard and crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.  The sandwiches are packed with quality ingredients.  Expect to spend about $8-11 per sandwich.\\n\\nTwo of the most popular sandwiches are the aforementioned Odd Job and the Mumm-Ra (ThunderCats reference).  One of the staff told me the Odd Job is popular because \\"Korean is in.\\"  The Odd Job features Korean double-fried chicken, gochujang sauce, and pear slaw.  Korean double-fried chicken is exceptionally crispy.  The sauce is made from gochujang paste, a traditional Korean condiment which is both salty and spicy.\\n\\nThe Mumm-Ra, often recommended, is Villains' take on the gyro.  It has crispy lamb belly, honey mint yogurt, and marinated tomato, bell pepper and onion.\\n\\nI like the Bugsy Siegel (1930s American gangster reference).  It's kind of like the restaurant's version of the Reuben.  It's got short rib pastrami, braised cabbage, Swiss cheese, and Russian caviar dressing.  It's a savory sandwich which packs quite a punch, flavor-wise.  The pastrami is mouth-watering and tasty and the Swiss and Russian dressing meld together nicely.\\n\\nI think these guys have done a great job tweaking the sandwiches from the bread to the quality and quantity of the ingredients.  The sandwiches are filling, delicious, and aren't messy to eat.\\n\\nI'd stay away from the salads unless you're really looking to get one.  Any of the sandwiches are available without bread (\\"Skeletor style\\") by request.  If you do order a salad, the main portion is large enough to satisfy most people's hunger.  I've tried the Shredder which comes with Romaine lettuce, bok choi, avocado, tomato, garbanzo beans, radish, and a tahini-soy dressing.  It's okay.  The veggies are fresh and ripe and the kitchen is generous with each of the ingredients, particularly the garbanzo beans.  However, the salads can't hold a candle to the sandwiches.\\n\\nThe sides ($3) look very appealing, though I've yet to try any.  They include soba noodle & kale salad and fried chicken liver & braised greens.  Yum.\\n\\nSublime Doughnuts has supplied \\"bomb pops\\" frozen dessert treats which you can grab and purchase from the small freezer at the ordering counter.  These are like ice cream and sorbets inside a plastic push-pop mechanism.  Good stuff.  The flavors available last time I went included strawberry mango and chocolate peanut butter.  Both flavors are enjoyable.  Go with the strawberry mango if you like fruit sorbets and chocolate peanut butter if you like chocolate ice cream.\\n\\nService is terrific.  All of the staff I've encountered here have been nothing but cool and friendly.\\n\\nFree parking is available directly in front of the restaurant in their small parking lot.  Most of the time, all of these spaces are taken.  There's also a lot in the back. Your can street park on Juniper or Piedmont (free).

So my tacos, while edible, were not good.\\n\\nSister's vegetarian fajitas, while also edible, tasted unnervingly like an Asian stir-fry. They were sweet and very saucy - almost like Sweet & Sour. I had a bite, closed my eyes and thought \\"Yes, this should be served over white rice.\\"\\n\\nSo nothing was BAD - it was just WEIRD. Confusing, wrong even. Sister, who is in the restaurant biz, stated accurately: \\"That cook was not raised in a cooking household.\\"\\n\\nI'm still bummed about our meals and, maybe it was just what we ordered, but I don't know if I'll be persuaded to return.

I will do my best to make excuses for last night anyway.\\n\\nTHE SUMMARY HERE: Even with a reservation, we waited more than thirty minutes past our reservation time even though we were early.  We could not get the hostess's attention to save our lives--and literally to save my spine.  (You can read below.)  Nobody gave us any updates on when we would be seated, or any other little bits of politeness.  No apologies whatsoever.  Yes, sometimes unexpected things happen, but it is obvious that they overbooked reservations.  I have no idea how the food is, because we finally gave up.  A business CANNOT overbook reservations like that--it is a horrible business practice, and that is why we will never go back to taste the food.\\n\\nTHE FULL STORY:\\n\\nI'm handicapped.  It's not always apparent because half the time, I'm in good enough shape to walk without my cane, albeit with a limp.  Even though I don't look it, though, I feel it.  That is why we always, always make a reservation, so I don't have to stand.  We made a reservation for 8:00, because they didn't have anything earlier.  We assumed they must be crowded (or else they would have given us an earlier reservation), so we were happy to wait because it guaranteed us a seat.\\n\\nWe got there about 7:50, so we understood why we were not seated right away.  The hostess was nowhere in sight, however, and there were no chairs for people who are waiting.  We stood and waited with another group who had a reservation for 7:30.  That should have been our first clue.\\n\\nOkay, so you're short-staffed on what appears to be the busiest night ever.  Things like that happen.  So we understand that it's difficult to get the hostess to, you know, do her only job, which is to greet people and take their names.  It took ten minutes.  By the time she finally got over to the station, I was in pain.  I hadn't even brought my cane because I was doing so well before that.  When she told us there was one group ahead of us, I asked her for a chair, specifically stating that I have a disability.  She told me that a seat was opening up at the bar, and then promptly disappeared before I could tell her that I need a chair that's closer to the ground.  You know, because handicapped people can't just magically jump onto bar stools where the seat is higher off the ground than one's hips.\\n\\nSo they denied me the chair I desperately needed.  Thanks, guys.  With my husband's help, I writhed into a bar stool.  I figured, it won't be long.  I will sit here for now to give my hips a break.  However, bar stools are very, very bad for me and can cause me serious pain.\\n\\nThe other group (the one whose reservation was at 7:30) finally managed to get the hostess's attention to talk to a manager around 8:05.  I wasn't trying to listen to their conversation with the manager, but you know how it goes.  The manager barely apologized.  Every \\"sorry\\" was quite sarcastic, in an \\"it's not our fault\\" way.  Everything was \\"I'm sorry, but we can't just kick people out of their seats.\\"  \\"I'm sorry, but we're busy tonight.\\"\\n\\nYou're right, you can't kick people out of their seats.  But here is a list of things you can do.  I hope that Porcini's reads this so they can figure out how to run a business properly:\\n*Not overbook reservations.  They most certainly did.  Their seating is quite limited; their reservations seemed to be unlimited.\\n*Give the people waiting an ETA.  Acknowledge every once in a while that they have been waiting.  If you think that you will not be able to fill their reservation time, apologize and suggest they come back in a half an hour.\\n*Apologize.  Sincerely.  Mean it.  Give a proper apology.\\n\\nFast forward to 8:30, a full half hour after the time we were supposed to be seated, and a full forty minutes that we have been waiting.  I am in pain, and there is no sign of a table opening up.  The hostess still fails even to acknowledge our existence, except to tell another couple that we're ahead of them.  I still can't get her attention to ask her for a real chair.\\n\\nI gave up.  Wouldn't you?  It took me a while to walk out to the car, but the car's seat was far more comfortable.  I asked my husband to please talk to the hostess to cancel our reservation.\\n\\nTen minutes later, he succeeded in that mission.\\n\\nWhat should you take from this review?  It was most likely a one-time thing.  Things happen, I know.  People get busier than they intended, and people make mistakes.  But when you have made a mistake, you do your best to atone for it.  They fail to do so.  Do you really want to give your business to a manager so rude?  To a restaurant that makes a point to show that it doesn't care about your comfort or your business?

The presentation was great. The fruit was very sweet and fresh. It came in a clear cup so you could see every layer and ingredient in the bowl. The base was not bad but it was not my favorite. I like it to taste like a blended sorbet, an in between hard ice and a smoothie, with a cool chill as the perfect temperature. Mother Juice's base tasted too solid. It might have been the almond butter that made it really thick but I have eaten an excellent acai bowl with almond butter before. I am also allergic to coconut milk so almond milk was substituted. That swap might have also contributed to the issue. Moreover, the granola was only average. The bowl could also use a honey on top to improve.\\n\\nIt was a decent acai bowl but I would not call it a must try. The smoothies, juices, and other food looked great.

My life is still in limbo. Unemployed with no idea which direction to go in. I digress.

You must try the food and drink.\\n2.) You must interact with the staff and spend enough time there to feel out the place.\\n3.) You must use their bathrooms.\\n\\nI ordered the mocha coffee and it was delicious. Sweet, cocoa goodness. I finished that before heading back up and ordering a slice of expensive pecan pie. That was washed down with a glass of water. They keep their water in a bucket. The staff wasn't overly friendly I noticed. They smile just enough to get a tip from suckers (like myself) but no more than they have to. Staff, if you're reading this right now, I'm the guy sitting near the window looking slightly upset because I've wasted productive time writing reviews that won't get me paid or advance my situation in anyway.\\n\\nThe bathroom had some plastic grass on the wall and in front was a tiny pivoting makeup mirror. Interesting. That's it for the bathroom...\\n\\nAll in all I'd say the experience was positive. The pie and the coffee was excellent, a little expensive however. Slice of pie was about 5 dollars but this is Alberta so it's to be expected. It's a rainy day so I'll probably sit here for much longer but if you have 5 bucks and want some pie stop by Random Order but don't randomly order....get the Pecan Pie!\\n\\nOh yeah, the music is too loud here sometimes.
