Highly recommend the arancini.  Marinated mushrooms were realy good as well...but you definately want something to with 'em.  I wasn't crazy about the salads...very oily still...they need to improve salad options.  The restaurant was very busy so we did have to wait a bit for our entrees to arrive.  Our party was satisfied with the entrees overall.

But if you want the details, read on:\\n\\nChamisul\\nUmm...why didn't I try this sooner? I have always ordered Chum Churum because I'm partial to the name but day-yum, Chamisul is smoooooth. Like Psy.\\n\\nSeafood Scallion Pancake (Korean-style pancake with scallions and assorted seafood)\\nI only had one slice because I was too busy stuffing my face with everything else. And being smart, I knew that pancake can fill a tummy up fast so I didn't bother rushing with this dish. I wasn't very impressed with my slice but that may be because it had already cooled down. I think a simple scallion pancake might have been better since I couldn't really taste the seafood anyway. I also wished it was a little more fried; the texture was a bit too soft for me. Pass.\\n\\nDolsot Bibimbop (fresh veggies, rice, and chopped beef topped with a fried egg served in a sizzling stone bowl)\\nThis is an all-time favorite dish. I love it when it's served in the stone bowl because being the slow eater that I am, my rice stays hot down to the last yummy spoonful. This one was pretty standard.\\n\\nBulgogi (thinly sliced NY strip, marinated and stir-fried with onions, mushrooms, and scallions in special sauce and spices)\\nKalbi (beef short ribs marinated in special sauce and grilled; served with lettuce and bean dip)\\nBoth meat dishes were flavorful although the kalbi was a little overcooked for me. And as much as I love making lettuce wraps, I couldn't even bother with it this time because there was so much food to pack away and so little tummy space!\\n\\nJabchae (cellophane noodles stir-fried in sesame oil with sliced pork and veggies, tossed in house seasoning)\\nEh. Noodles were way overcooked so they were bloated and soft. A gigantic portion though with a generous amount of pork and veggies mixed in.\\n\\nGanpoongki (boneless chicken slices, battered and deep-fried, tossed in a sweet & spicy sauce)\\nThe star of the feast. We ordered a small and thank goodness we did because apparently a small actually meant a large in this case. The chicken was fried to a crispy perfection and the sauce was tangy without being too sweet or too spicy. YUM. Granted, we were ravenous and this was the first dish to be brought out so that may have biased all of our taste buds. But we practically licked the plate clean.\\n\\nDishes came out in a rather haphazard manner (our pancake appetizer came out after our main dishes) but they came out fairly quickly. Service was friendly and attentive enough - our glasses of water were always full. At the end of our meal, in search of further merriment, one of the waiters kindly drew out directions to the closest noraebang (Jin Karaoke) on a napkin for us. With quiet pride and a sense of heroic achievement in our hearts (we finished everything save for three slices of pancake and some jabchae), we gathered up our full, distended tummies and went off into the night."},{"name":"Chart House","address":"60 Long Wharf","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I have always liked the Chart House(s).

However, on Monday, October 06, 2014 I took a group of client's from the treatment facility I work at to receive a self-defense class at a neighboring business. One of my clients got emotional, during the class and we sat on the steps of the plaza to speak privately. A stout man with a gray goatee came down the stairs behind us and demanded that we get off of the steps. His voice was cross, harsh, and disrespectful. My client and I advised the man that we would relocate off the steps, he replied (yelling as if we were children) \\" Gone and get off my steps now! We are getting ready to open, paying customers are coming\\". I advised him again, that we were getting ready to move. He stared at us, using obscene language, until we moved. My client, being in treatment, stated that she wanted to curse him back out. I advised her to use her coping skills, because there are rude and nasty people in the world ; and you can't just curse everyone out. Being with my client, the entire conversation, I knew she took my advice and was quiet on the situation. The rude man then proceeded to lie to the self-defense trainer, stating that my client cursed him for no reason. It was a blatant lie on my client. I have never been so disrespected to my face by anyone before this. I remained calm, because I love my job, and to show my group of client's the correct way to handle a complete moron.

We ordered through Longhorn Delivery and for some reason or another, it took a few tries to get through (it was a typical weekday evening, I have no idea what was going on!).  \\n\\nThe food arrived within the stated period (around thirty minutes), piping hot, generous portions.   The Pou-Peersod, soft spring rolls, were pretty standard issue.  They were modest-sized and rather dry on the inside.  I was a big disappointed in the dipping sauce - it was some sweet and source sauce concoction with peanut grounds.  I like me a hearty spicy peanut dipping sauce, but overall - not exactly terrible. \\n\\nThe Pud Kee-Mow, flat noodles, was a nice hefty portion and I loved the large slabs of fried tofu.  The tofu definitely seemed \\"home-fried\\" - as if Thai Passion had actually pan fried fresh tofu itself instead of buying the commercially pre-fried, often dry and crumbly tofu stuff.  The tofu was lightly crisp no the outside and soft and fresh on the inside - just I like!  The vegetables all seem like they had been fresh before cooking - score!  The tofu and veggie to noodle ratio was pretty legit - nothing I hate more than when a restaurant skimps on the good stuff and thinks it can deceive you with just more of the cheap filler carb stuff.  \\n\\nThe Gang-Dang, red curry, was also a very hefty portion.  I hadn't had restaurant Thai curry in awhile (because it's uber cheap and delicious to make your own) - but this was rather nice.  Same tofu stuff and tenderly simmered veggies.  Quite delicious - neither too salty nor too bland.  \\n\\nI think we got these around the medium spice level - which was definitely a beautiful faint heat party in the mouth.  Don't you hate it when you get something medium spicy and then you can barely eat the dang stuff because your mouth and gut are burning with protest? Also quite nice of them - they designate what items are naturally vegan with tofu - but it wouldn't hurt for you to specific no egg or fish sauce. \\n\\nThe prices were fair, but not entirely \\"what a deal!\\"  But yes, quite affordable and the portions were generous enough for a few substantial meals.  \\n\\nI can't say I was completely blown away by Thai Passion, but it was rather tasty and I was satisfied that night and the next day for my leftovers lunch.  There's much more Thai to be explored, so probably won't be too determined to sample Thai Passion again.

Everything else (including 2 types of bacon beer) were either too bland or just plain bad.  I mention this because naturally it's the first thing that you think of when coming here.  It's just not a good watering hole.\\n\\nAs for the food, that's a different story.  The Cuban was very good, in fact one of the better ones that I have ever had.  Also tried the turkey club wrap with cranberry sage mayo which was surprisingly tasty.  My buddy that I went here with both times swears by the burgers and I believe him because those looked very tasty and there was a wide variety of them.  And the house made fries are just delicious.  Do yourself a treat and get a basket of those with a side of the chipotle-lime mayo, you will not be dissapointed.\\n\\nService was kind of off both times.  Either we did not get enough of an appetizer (waiter's excuse, I swear) or the food/process took entirely too long.  For the former issue, we were given a free plate of nachos to make up for it.

The caprese salad was the basic mozzarella, basil and tomato except that a quality heirloom tomato was used. The entrees tried were the baby lamb chops (scottaditti) and the homemade pasta with shrimp, garlic, olive oil and grape tomatoes.

I was unsure what to expect with the actual brick and mortar restaurant, and was definitely NOPE NOPE NOPE walking into a loud, crowded entrance where people were looking at menus with a bajillion options and no table service.\\n\\nI got over it. The menu is manageable, with options for a carb base (roll, corn cake, mac n cheese), protein (pulled pork, brisket, chicken meatballs, artichoke, etc.), toppings and sides. They have plenty of adult beverages as well. A local draft goes a long way to soothing my anxieties. They also have quite a few dessert options, if you lean that way.\\n\\nThe line went quickly and we managed to find a table (they turn over fairly quickly). Our beers were delivered to us, then the food. The proteins (brisket and pulled pork) were good, but MAN - the corn cake and those Lucky Cat buns! I could smell the fresh, yeasty bun with every bite. That pulled everything together. One of our party had the mac and cheese and was thrilled to find crispy edge pieces. Seriously - they could upcharge to have mac and cheese edges added to an order.\\n\\nOverall - food is good, right-sized portions and fresh ingredients. Can't go wrong with booze and cheese. I can deal with counter service when it is efficient (and the quality of the experience one that doesn't leave you searching for a staff member to ask a question of), and although it is LOUD, it's not really a place you're going to linger over intimate conversation.

The dressing tasted SOUR- I mean, sour as in it should be thrown away soon. The taste reminds me of the smell of shredded mozzarella cheese if you leave it open, in the refrigerator for too long. (note the dish is STILL in front of me- it's taking me forever to eat). Some parts of the pasta with the dressing taste delicious, other parts, I taste the sourness. \\n\\nEverything else about the dish was great. I mean, not eye gauging, heart stopping, flavorgasmic great, but for the price- i'd definitely order it again. With a different dressing though :)\\n\\nMy husband's dish was good. He said he was disappointed the cajun sauce was so soupy, but it was otherwise very tasty. \\n\\nHe was also diappointed the chicken didn't have cajun seasoning- he though tit was plain. He would have preferred the dish \\"to have a more complex spice profile\\" (he's a robot- yes he is)- meaning, he would have liked the chicken to have been seasoned, and perhaps a less soupy sauce.\\n\\nI however, thought the chicken was good compared to other places that serve grilled chicken! \\n\\nBoth pasta dishes came with a small loaf of bread. It looks unappetizing , AS IF it were store bought, but it was surprisingly GOOD.  Next time we come I'm heating it up so it's toasty. \\n\\nDefinitely will go back and try more dishes, and I'll report my feelings on this place in a few months.\\n\\nOther notes: the cashiers, etc are all really great.

I was AMAZED that they would let 14 people leave their restaurant that easy, I mean this bill would've probably been close to $500.00 dollars and instead of working with us and at least apologize all we got was \\"OKAY, NO PROBLEM, GOOD BYE!\\" ?????

We were seated quickly. 10 minutes go by and still no waiter/waitress. 15 min...20 min. Finally we said to the guy, \\"Are you the waiter for this table?\\" And he said, Yes. What would you like?\\" No introduction. No specials. No name. He was wearing a black hat with a black horizontal oval on it. We also noticed 1 bartender outside.

The waiter did not know and he had to ask. 10 minutes pass again. Comes back and tells us. We order. Another 35 minutes pass and we finally get our food and the two of the four were not correct. He comes to take it back, no apology or sorry for the inconvenience. The waiter barely says anything to us. About 15 minutes later he comes back. No apology again and puts the food on the table and walks away.\\n\\nI am not sure what is wrong with this place but the service was the worst service I've had in a long time and I go out ALL of the time.

I had to chew that thing for QUITE some time before managing to swallow. I think we also had bc and California rolls, but upon sampling each I gave up as the fish and crab smelled and tasted like...well let's just say old. But the worst part was the tempura- I'm used to crispy, fluffy, golden deliciousness. This was dark brown, dry (yet somehow soggy at the same time?), looked like it was reheated in a microwave stuff. It is blasphemy to call that tempura. \\nNeedless to say, after a few bites we dumped the entire meal in the trash. I have had store bought, day old sushi that was a thousand times superior. I'm not a picky eater, and prefer not to complain, but I feel the need to warn others about how awful this was.

Nice mix of textures with the crispy puffed rice, the brown butter aioli and the buttery crab. \\n\\nI think the least successful was the carbonara. For me it was a little bit over-salted and heavy.

Didn't really want to pick a place out of the tourist brochure, but didn't really have any other choice. Glad we gave Continental Seafood a try! I'm Chinese-American and everyone says the best dim sum in North America is in Vancouver. Was quite pleased with the quality of dim sum, better and fresher than NYC Chinatown dim sum! We came here one day for dim sum, and another night to try the famous Dungeness crab. The crab to me was ok but the sauce and the noodles that they add to it was SO good. We only tried one other place for Chinese seafood dinner (Sea Harbor) and that was okay to me. Continental seems really good, it is in a strip mall and further away from the other Chinese places in Richmond (where the majority of Chinese restaurants tend to be, don't bother with their crappy, run-down Chinatown!). Would definitely recommend to others visiting or who live in the area!\\n\\nOh and if you go to dinner here, they actually have a karaoke night! Entertaining.

And not just pastries or slapped together sandwiches stored in refrigerators, but good, fresh, hearty food. When a friend suggested we meet up there for brunch, I really wasn't expecting much. Mind blown!\\n\\nThe brunch menu offers a two course deal, where you also have the option of adding on a glass of sparkling wine. I started my meal with an iced coffee, as I have a *slight* (ok, major) iced coffee addiction. I liked that we had sit-down service, which I was not expecting at a coffee shop, and the server brought my coffee in a real glass. No plastic-bad-for-the-environment stuff here! I asked for it with cream and sugar, and a smaller glass of cream was brought out along with a variety of sugars/sweeteners so I could tailor my beverage perfectly to my tastebuds. \\n\\nOnce I got my coffee fix, I opted for the watermelon and tomato salad for the first course, and the BCK Benedict for the main course. And the watermelon mint sparkling wine. Oh my, do I know how to order! I was just trying to describe the watermelon and tomato salad to a co-worker, and words do not do it justice. The benedict was nice- with lumps of crab meat on top, served on brioche as opposed to an English Muffin. The flavors were light for an eggs Benedict dish and blended nicely. The watermelon and mint wine was nice, but give it some time for the watermelon mint icy part to melt, so the flavor intensifies. It's worth the wait!\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Greek yogurt parfait and the quiche. She was kind enough to offer me a bite of each, and maybe it wasn't that I know how to order, but there is just no way to go wrong ordering anything off their menu! The quiche was delish- I didn't even miss the fact that there was no crust. The parfait was chock full of crunchy granola and perfectly ripe berries. It tasted like dessert for breakfast!\\n\\nMost people know Sunday brunch is a crazy busy time anywhere around town, and you are lucky to grab a table and a nanosecond of attention from your overworked server. While Barnie's was crazy busy, service was not lacking at all. Our server was friendly and helpful, and never rushed us when we were deciding on our orders. We also had 2 other members of the staff check on us throughout the meal. We learned that a lot of the ingredients are locally sourced. Also, we learned that Barnie's offers dinner on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings.

Great seafood and steaks, right on the Long Wharf with a perfect view of the harbor. We enjoyed the prime rib and the lobster stuffed scrod, both of which were fantastic meals. We were very disappointed in the service, however. We had reservations at 4:00 pm, not exactly peak hours, and when we got there, the host informed us that a table would not be ready for 30 minutes. We had a flight to get to so we settled for the bar area. None of the tables were clean so we settled for the table with the least amount of trash. We did not receive water or acknowledgement by the bar staff for at least 5 minutes. Our appetizers (soups) were not brought out until the entrees arrived, so we were forced to eat the soup as quickly as possible so our dinners did not get cold (yes we could have eaten them both at the same time, but this is advertised as a premier seafood restaurant in Boston - appetizers such as soup should not take 20 minutes to arrive). By this point we were rushing to make the flight so we requested the dessert to go.

Perhaps it was just the day, (there was a problem with the credit card machine that totally engulfed the front help) we were the only patrons in the restaurant (oddly enough on a Friday just after one P.M.), yet mysteriously there was a stack of credit cards and slips the processing of which obliterated the fact that someone was in the restaurant requiring some small modicum of attention. \\n\\nAlas, no gracious host appeared with hand washing materials, the time gaps between menu, taking order etc. were frustrating, I mean we were the ONLY people there. \\nWhen it came time to order I may have made a cardinal mistake, based on the rapt attention others were given regarding the menu choices, I stated that I liked fish and I liked spicy and asked what the waitress would recommend.  \\nI was told that the beef peanut butter soup that so many others have referenced could be made with fish, so I ordered that, as did my significant other, ...(without the spice.)\\n  \\nIt took a while to prepare, and after a time the meal appeared.  We were told that there would be some bones in the fish as we were served.  \\nNon-plussed, we dove in only to find that this statement was an absolute inaccuracy.\\n  Perhaps it was the language thing,  (all conversations between employees occured in some presumably African tongue), but what the waitress/hostess meant to say was there MAY be some fish in your BONES. \\n I'm not talking a few pin bones here, I'm talking about when you filet a fish and there's a spine that is the framework from which the rib bones blossom, they hacked up spines from multiple fish, breaded them and fried them and tossed them in our soups, ALONG WITH RANDOM FISH SCALES!  It was as though they pulled the scraps out of the garbage as they were out of fish and thought  \\"let's play choke the yelpies\\".  \\nI get the whole thing about cooking things with bones in for flavor enhancement,   That might have been acceptable had there been some actual flesh from a fish that found it's way into my bowl, along with the scraps but AT BEST there was perhaps two level teaspoons full of fish.  \\n\\nTo add insult to injury, you Yelpers who have not yet visited this establishment, may think well the cheap sot just paid for a bowl of soup, and you are right, but they charge twelve bucks each for these bowls of soup, so we are talking luncheon entree prices, not typical bowls of soup prices.  \\nI've had awsome lobster bisque with marble sized chunks of lobster in it for half that price, so yeah I actually expected a piece of fish in my soup, and I am honked.  \\nWas it an aberration?  \\nNO! My significant other got exactly the same bone to flesh ratio in her soup as well!  \\nIn fairness I must say, that the broth was phenomenal! \\n\\nThere were complex layers of flavor, deft use of ingredients and spices etc., that obviously took some time in development  and unless you have a nut allergy have no fear that it is going to taste of peanut butter-  no discernible peanut flavor, and sweetness is not imparted.  Thankfully the soup was served with a plate of rice so there was something edible to put in the soup after one fished out the bones and watched them clumbsily ring the bowl during the dining process joined by the occassional fish scale that one coughed up while eating the re-named rice soup.  \\nThe heat in my bowl was supplied by a halved scotch bonnet pepper swimming about in the bowl.\\n\\nI am a carnivore/omnivore.  I'll eat the other stuff too, but I want flesh of some sort when I dine, so as it happens the first place we pass on the way back to the interstate was a Long John Silver's.  I stopped and got a piece of fish for a buck and a half and ate it for fuel for the last segment of our drive.

Gluten free that's fine but then having a gluten free bagel with dairy free butter was so unnecessary. It's great that they are catering to dietary restrictions but it gets to a point where none of the products are good.

After the first visit I was insanely in love with their burger and fries.  I was so sad that it was so far away from my house and I was trying to come up with any excuse to go up there and get my Mighty Fine fix.\\n\\nA couple weeks after my first visit, hubby and I had some errands to do up in that neck of the woods and I am so excited - I have the excuse I am looking for.  Migh-ty Fine!  Migh-ty Fine!  Wheeeeeeeeeee!!!!\\n\\nWell...I may have wound myself up a little too much.  I bound in and happily order my jr cheeseburger with jalapenos and wait patiently for them to call my name.  I tear into my paper-wrapped burger and wait for bliss.

I'm still processing my Tuesday night dinner at Frasca but will attempt to get it all down in a review. So many new tastes, ingredients, and experiences. \\n\\nFirstly, no self-respecting foodie who lives within 100 miles of this place should miss it. This is New York/San Fran/Napa/Portland quality food right in our backyard. That said, start saving up, because to do Frasca right takes some serious coin. Just be prepared for that, eat ramen for awhile, and you won't be disappointed. This was a wedding anniversary splurge and well worth it. \\n\\nI think the best approach to dinner at Frasca is submission. Let your waiter and sommelier bring you course after course of food with half glasses of wine pairings they choose. Fewer decisions for you - leave it up to the experts. Once that's settled, you can sit back in the lovely dining room and take it all in. \\n\\nHere's what I had: frico caldo (not to be missed appetizer of potatoes and cheese), prawns and farro salad (uber yum), gnocchi with lobster (a few chewy pieces of lobster, but generally fab), halibut (like butter), and chocolate torte (meh). The hubs had an apple and Treviso salad, risotto, quail, and port. Each course was accompanied by a half glass of wine that the staff selected. \\n\\nEach time we had a new course set down in front of us, everyone and everything except my meal sort of floated away into the background. Everything smelled wonderful and looked delicious before even taking a bite. The wine they selected went with everything perfectly. The food was prepared and seasoned to perfection. Self-admitted salt junkies, we are usually casting about for more salt. But we had a small bowl of fancy sea salt on the table that we didn't need. There was a seemingly endless bread basket that we quickly learned could be dangerous. They will keep filling, filling, filling until you cry uncle. And we seemed to have 8 people waiting on us, but not obnoxiously so. They really do make you feel special. \\n\\nI love that Frasca strives to use local and seasonal ingredients as much as possible. The portions are spot on - this is not a gut-buster meal. I felt full and satisfied, but not overly so.\\n\\nThe one low note of the meal was chocolate torte dessert. It could have been spectacular, given the ingredients, but it wasn't. It did come with \\"Happy Anniversary\\" piped in icing on a leaf, which was very cute. My husband, who \\"prefers ports over tortes\\" enjoyed a nice 20-year old port that he loved. I left sort of wishing I had skipped the calories of the lackluster dessert. We also could have used some more privacy - we could hear the convos of the couples on either side clear as a bell. It's fairly tight quarters. \\n\\nI could probably go on and on, but I'll quit now. Bottom line: go to Frasca if you're a foodie. If you're cranky about small portions and high price tags, skip it. You need to be the type of person who can appreciate high-quality ingredients or you'll feel robbed when the bill comes."},{"name":"Aladdin's Restaurant","address":"1015 State Rd 436","city":"Casselberry","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is awesome!

A Waiter who Lies - He's the one who always dresses in black and white and carries some sort of an attitude.

He said they had no meatballs that night.  So we ordered a chicken congee and a scholar congee.  When my scholar congee came, in addition to the pig's liver, kidney and stomach lining which are typically the only ingredients in a scholar congee, there was a beef ball and a squid ball.  Not being able to accommodate substitution request is one thing, lying to customers is utterly unacceptable.\\n\\n2.  Salty Congee - Our congees was so salty that we couldn't even finish half of them without worrying about our blood pressure shooting through the roof.\\n\\n3.

I'm not a fan of blue cheese, so I ordered the salad sans cheese.  The salad was amazing!  All of the ingredients tasted very fresh and the size was just right.  I don't like how a lot of places serve supersize salads, which negates the entire healthy factor of a salad.  The raspberry vinaigrette was one of the better raspberry vinaigrettes I've had - sweet and not too tart.  The mushroom soup was actually not that great.  It was a little too watery for my taste, but the salad made up for the slack.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Almond Chicken Skewers, which were extremely delicious.

There were about 12 people in line in front of me - a couple, a family of six and a group of four. Not unreasonable for this time of day by any means. But it took over 30 minutes to get through the line a get my food. A few problems I noticed:\\n\\n1. There is only a single person taking orders. So one person in line who can't make a decision or doesn't understand the menu holds everyone up. There should at least be an option for another staff person to jump in if things are moving slowly to speed them up.\\n\\n2. There is an obvious lack of process on the line. Things were communicated verbally in duplicate and triplicate (and probably more). Yet still, there was mass confusion over my relatively simple orders, and major elements were almost missed despite me confirming my order multiple times.\\n\\n3. I was told, upon asking about the wait time, that they were training two new employees. This was a failure of management to throw new employees on the line without supervision, and during their busiest time nonetheless. (It was pretty obvious who the new ones were.)\\n\\n4. The child size portion for one of my orders was larger than an adult size portion.\\n\\n5. I tried to call in my order ahead of time, but was told that they do not take orders over the phone. I was told to download the app (annoying - why don't they just have a mobile website?). But the app did not have the gluten free pasta option on the menu. So I had no choice but to wait in line. Even if I had ordered in advance, there was no signage in the restaurant about where to pick up orders.\\n\\n6. The quantity of vegetables were laughable - like, 5 or 6 teeny tiny diced zucchinis. They allow you to select up to 6 items in your pasta. But if you only select one, wouldn't logic indicate to perhaps just a larger amount to compensate for the lack of other items?\\n\\n7. The upcharge for the protein additions is not a good value for money. $3.50 for a piece of burrata cheese? Or for six shrimp?\\n\\nI'm bumping this up to 2 stars only because the food was decent and because I think that this is a good concept for a restaurant.

The rice is decent, though coming from a Persian household, my rice standards are pretty high. \\n\\nMy two complaints about Habibi are (1) the pitas are consistently undercooked. At times, it's as if you're chewing on raw dough. I like my pita to have a bit of a char (like another well-known Lebanese place that I won't mention here). and (2) it's expensive. A shwarma sandwich with hummus and a salad ()the combo) is about $10. True, you get a lot of hummus and a decent sized salad, but maybe give people a little less, and charge a few bucks less. I know that hummus is not that expensive to make, or keep, so upcharging $3 for the salad and hummus is a bit much.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that there are cheaper, better, and less cornily decorated middle eastern places in Portland (and even in the downtown core) that I'd rather go to."},{"name":"Bostone Pizza","address":"225 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place is pretty lousy for a pizza joint.\\n\\nI came here for a snack and bought 6 slices of the Sicilian pizza they had on display. 2 slices each of 3 toppings.\\n\\nFirst the good.

I understand, it wasn't freshly made it was sitting there. But that doesn't change these basics. First, the dough was tasteless. It was a little crunchy, so that's good. But there was no flavor, it was like eating French bread. Too literally so. The dough was very thick, taking up probably 90%+ of the thickness, meaning there was no tomato sauce. The sauce that was there was more like tomato paste, because it was not flavorful or sauce-like, but instead dried and tasteless. The cheese was about as thin as I've ever seen. Not like \\"sparse\\" as in chunks of cheese placed in separate places, but instead like they took 3 shreds of cheese and melted it until it provided 1 molecule of covering. The spinach pizza was a little bitter, the onion and pepper pizza was oily with no crunch or memorable flavor, and I don't even remember the third topping of pizza. After eating 4 of the 6 slices I felt sort of full (but not really) because I had eaten essentially 4 slices of white bread. If I wanted that I could buy a baguette!

On the plus side, the Yasai yaki soba was tasty, if not slightly clumsy, and I didn't detect any butternut squash, as promised. The pickled ginger was a bit overpowering, but overall, it was a solid dish, and I'm always on the lookout for tasty vegetarian dishes.

The wait staff (appear to be the owner's kids, brothers, sisters, etc) is anywhere from slow on a good day to terrible on a bad day.    Many of them barely speak English, but they typically get your order right somehow.    They do make you some fresh salsa at the table (mild, medium, or spicy), which is nice.   The owner is typically on the prowl with his tequila belt dolling out slammers and shots (no, they aren't free).   They have some REALLY high end tequila if that is your bag, but be prepared to pay dearly for (some are $50 a shot).   Lots of selections on the menu - I don't think you can go wrong with the molcajete or the steak tampiquena (beware, can be blazing spicy).   Other items range are generally pretty good, although the ladies never seem to like this place very much.   House margaritas are wicked knock you on your ass strong.   Seriously, two margaritas and a full size man will be drunk - three and you'll be bombed - four and you are on the floor for the night.

The Large buffet wrapped around the front of the restaurant showcasing the lively open kitchen which was situated behind.\\n\\nNow normally I am not into buffets, there's something about the idea of food which is openly exposed to the public who messily grab plates full of food, just disguising. Plus a buffet with an endless supply of food can be very dangerous for an over eater like me. Boma however, was the exception; the buffet was kept extremely clean, and was supervised by a culinary cast member, who also freshly restocked each buffet offering within minutes of the dish becoming half empty.\\n\\nOnce sat in the large airy restaurant the chef came over to discuss my special dietary need, upon telling him I was a vegan he knowingly led me through the buffet pointing out all the vegan offerings which I would be able to eat. With a large selection of salads, soups, and rice dishes, I was excited to grab a plate and dig in.\\n\\nI started out with the Harira Soup, a delicious hearty African spiced soup made with lentils, chickpeas, stewed tomatoes, cilantro, and onions. The soup was delicious and hearty, yet because it had a vegetable broth base it wasn't overly filling on the stomach.\\n\\nNext it was onto a sampling of hummus, my favorite. I tried both the creamy sun dried tomato hummus and the savory black bean hummus served with soft Pita points, yum what's not to love about the creamy pureed spread, I honestly could have made a meal purely from the hummus and pitas, but with a buffet full of vegan offerings it was time to try next thing.\\n\\nNext I had a helping of white Basmati rice topped with Chakalaka, a spicy sauce made of freshly stewed tomatoes and onions. This dish had just the right amount of spice and sweetness to it.\\n\\nNext I had a heaping helping of the tunisian cous cous salad, a salad severed at room temperature made with corn, red onion, parsley, and red pepper. The cous cous salad was delicious and had a slightly nutty flavor.\\n\\nI then helped myself to the refreshing watermelon rind salad, which was made with thinly sliced watermelon. The dish was quite interesting and had an immense gingery flavor. The combination of sweet watermelon and spicy ginger flavor made for one delicious combination.\\n\\nI was doing a last browse through the buffet line when I noticed an offering of root vegetable that happened to look quite appealing, however, I didn't remember the chef ever saying that the selection of root vegetable were vegan. I questioningly inquired with my sever as to whether or not I could have the root vegetables. she promptly checked with the chef and reported that I was unable to have the root vegetables because they were finished with an herb butter (always ask first, a lot of restaurants use ingredients you otherwise wouldn't think to make the dish look more appealing, in this case the butter was used to add a delicate sheen to the dish). However, she did report that the chef would be happy to make me a vegan version of the dish, I was ecstatic.\\n\\nUpon returning to the table I saw a plate filled with delicious seasoned root vegetables including parsnips, and carrots, plus there was a side of crisply seasoned broccolini and asparagus waiting for me. I couldn't be happier, the root vegetables were delicious and lightly seasoned in a buttery olive oil.\\n\\nAlthough I was pretty much stuffed I did manage to save a bit of room for dessert. I decided on a selection of assorted fruit. Fresh honey dew, sweet pineapple, cantaloupe, crisp red grapes, and sugary red strawberries.\\n\\nMy Dad who claimed he was stuffed and only wanted coffee for dessert returned to the table with a plate full of mini desserts. Amongst the dessert was a caramel bread pudding which he claimed was absolutely decadent, there were also several creamy custard desserts which he noted were also delicious.\\n\\nThe chef then brought over a bowl of raspberry sorbet topped with fresh blueberries and raspberries which Dad and I split.  A perfect light finish to our exotic African meal.\\n\\nBoma was a delicious meal and definitely lived up to it's highly talked about reputation. Boma is also open for Breakfast and from what I hear it makes for one amazingly delicious experience.\\n\\nCheck out http://www.kaitsinsidedish.blogspot.com for more vegan reviews\\n\\nI definitely advise you to come hungry and be prepared to leave Boma completely stuffed, be advised to wear stretchy pants, buttons  or tight skinny jeans are definitely are not recommended."},{"name":"Ah Fong Kitchen","address":"1815 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This is 4 stars for what it is./ Quick, pretty good Chinese food on 82nd.

I ended up getting the simple hamburger with everything on it and added bacon and tater tots.

But the buttered, toasted bun added a really nice kick. \\n\\n My friend ordered their turkey, ham, and brie sandwich also with tots. I was surprised they had a sandwich like this on their menu, and my friend, being picky with sandwiches like this, thoroughly enjoyed it. Though I will say, please add a little more of the blueberry jam, there wasn't enough sweet to counterbalance the savory.\\n\\nThere are a few problems I have though: one being how pricey they are. Their items are easily around $10, most being at least that. It's downtown prices for a place near a university, which I don't think will work well. But the portion size I got and with how good the burger was, I can kind of justify it. \\n\\nAlso, in another review, someone mentioned the parking: ohhhhh yeah, I can definitely see how that would be an issue when the crowd gets bigger.

We were here on a Wednesday so not too many people, but the spot was still full. \\n\\nI had the Reggie Deluxe and Kristina had the Regina, while we shared some hash browns. All were BANGING! The Reggie Deluxe doesn't look that big, but it was more than I could handle. I actually had to take it home. The Reggie Deluxe might be the best breakfast biscuit that I've tasted. Biscuit, bacon, chicken, cheese and gravy were all cooked well. The Regina was good, but nothing extraordinary. The hash browns were something else. Hash browns topped with mushrooms and cheese were a must for us.\\n\\nStop by here if you are in town.

When I moved to Columbus, I was excited to discover locations in Pickerington and Hilliard. My visits to the Pickerington store provided me with good quality in that great DiCarlos style. Soon after discovering the Pickerington location, it closed. We started frequenting the Hilliard location. We were pleased to discover the same great familiar DiCarlos taste. In August, we moved out of the area. We were now over an hour away. We made the trip to Hilliard in September just to have the Dicarlos pizza we had been missing. What a disappointment to find they were closed. When we called to inquire, we were told it was temporary and they had closed for remodeling. Unfortunately, they changed more than the decor. It quickly became apparent that they had changed the sauce, the pepperoni was now being cooked with the crust and the amazing trademark cheese had been replaced with a pathetic substitute. The crust was now limp and dripping with puddles of grease from the pepperoni and the texture of the cheese didn't even remotely resemble the delicious real cheese that helped make DiCarlos the treat that it had always been. What a huge disappointment! Dicarlos Hilliard quickly went from a 5 star pizza place to a one star. Shame on you Dicarlos for not staying true to the taste that made you a leader in this style of pizza. We will not be making the one hour trip again. We will instead drive East to the locations along the West Virginia border that made the DiCarlos name what it is, especially the locations on Main St in downtown Wheeling and Moundsville. I will never understand why, when you have a great formula for success, you would feel the need to cut corners and change it.

My last visit was in May '11, and my prior in Jun'10.  I'd visit a lot more often if I lived in Portland.\\n\\nThe food here is good comfort food.  It has a theme around cooking that focuses on good ingredients, pairing of ingredients, and grilling.  Quite like the visual theme of the restaurant, it's comfortable without pretense.  Most of the dishes, like their burger, are fairly straightforward with subtle creative touches, but nothing that's risky.  The food is fairly light and healthy (or at least it feels so to me).  It's not hard on the wallet.  It may not blow you away, but it's a place you'd want to return often if it makes a favorable impression.  It may not be for you if you're looking for robust flavors and risk taking.\\n\\nMy first visit here was in Jun '10 for dinner. Taking notes, I enjoyed their grilled Branzino (type of sea-bass fish).  Fish was very fresh and delicious.  This was a whole fish that was grilled without a sauce.  The fish had a nice, distinct char to it.  Meat was still moist, and the fish had a subtly sweet flavor to it.  Seasoning here, if there was any at all, was minimal.  Portion size generous, and the value was reasonable at approx $20.  After almost a year, the dish is still memorable.\\n\\nI returned to Clyde Common recently for lunch, May 2011.\\n\\n'Hamburger sandwich' ($11)\\n(Dish Rating,  77%)\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/G96eAh4n0ksknavhExYr6A?userid=OWtjsyPKWUu7La7uOyC6Rw\\n\\nSolid burger, one of the best I've had in Portland thus far.  Cheap too at $11 after adding cheese & a fried egg on top w/ fries.  Why it is called a sandwich beats me, as I feel it isn't particularly sandwichy at all. superior to 'Little Bird's 'Le Pigeon' burger, which I felt wasn't that great & fancy for all the wrong reasons.  It's also as different you can get to the 'Le Pigeon' burger, in that it's very straightforward, with a clear focus on the burger patty.  The patty here is simple.  Served rare as requested.  Meat is moderately fatty which gives it extra flavor.  The kitchen's ability to give the meats a nice char works very well here, and that is the predominant flavor.  \\n\\nCondiments are conservative, but work well.  Cheddar is light, almost resembles a Swiss.  It's fully melted.  The fried egg (I break the yolk and spread) gives the meat a more buttery texture.  Both the cheese and egg blend in to complement, not distract, from the burger.  A side of grain mustard also works.  If you need more flavor, the creme friache & harissa dipping sauce are at your disposal and compatible.  Good, no-nonsense, gourmet burger that perfectly matches the theme of the restaurant. \\n\\nFries aren't bad either.  Low on seasoning and oil, they're a tad thicker than a shoe-string cut, thus surprisingly light.  They work with the light, non-spicy Harissa and creme fraiche dip blend.  Ketchup is offered on request.  It's good, but not outstanding.\\n\\n'Clyde Common pastrami, cream cheese, pickled radicchio, house rye' is more of a Ruben ($9).  The brisket used for the pastrami is mildly spiced, lean, and fairly moist.  I feel that it's a tad too lean, as there is barely any fat.  Cut of the meat is moderately thick, but the quantity of meat isn't substantial.  Instead of saurkraut, radicchio (purple leaf that is mildly bitter and spicy) is used as the choice of bitter greens.  Flavors aren't quite as robust as a conventional ruben.  I felt that this re-interpretation was more of a Ruben light.  It's probably a lot healthier.  Decent, but falls short of the traditional sandwich.\\n\\n'Arugula pappardelle, beef sugo, pickled peppers, ch√®vre' ($11-12?) was the only pasta dish on our lunch menu.  Pasta, made from arugula greens, here is cooked appropriately soft, and has a more subtle citrus flavor that works well with the melted chevre (type of goat cheese) on top.  For a pasta, it's fairly light in flavor.  Its a satisfying simple dish.\\n\\n'Spiced chickpeas, aioli' ($8?) is a bit vague in description and is offered as a side.  To me, it resembled more of a chickpea stew in harissa sauce, with a dob of aioli on top.  I feel that it's reasonably large enough in size to be a main course by itself.

Most notably, the Cabbage Roll (which normally comes on the meat mezza platter) was phenomenal and i can safely say it is THE BEST cabbage roll i have ever had in my entire life.  Theirs contains a beef filling, delectably spiced and quite flavorful, with a good balance of rice in it, not too much like some cabbage rolls i have had.  It felt like it melted in my mouth.  It was so good we ordered a second one from the happy hour menu (which i think cost about $3).\\n\\nThe Baba Ghanouj was really, really tasty, as was the Tatziki and the Hummus.  The hummus was some of the smoothest i have ever had, really good and the right balance of garlicyness.  Also the little spinach pie thing was amazing, so good i wish it had been a little bigger.  \\n\\nWe left under $20 ($9 for the mezza, $3cabbage roll, shared drink and tip), both full, taste buds agog at the awesomeness that had just passed over them, and happy.

You should have ordered everything in one shot.\\n Friend: I just wanted to see the menu to order some drinks, maybe a beer\\n Server: We only have 1 type of beer, how many bottles?\\n \\nFunny thing is I think my friends and I were all in shock, plus due to the numbless in our mouth because of the spcies our heads are not functioning normally. We just kept eating. 2 minutes later I finally broke out and said:\\n\\n\\"OMG, did you guys realize how ridiculous that was? She told us we can't order!  \\"\\n\\nYeap, just thought I should share with all my fellow yelpers.\\n\\nAs for the food, even for that traumatizing conversation with the server I still give a 4 star.

Within a few short minutes the server was back with my plate, now with perhaps extra lobster for my troubles, yay! But that was the high point... . I took a bite and was immediately disappointed: the lobster was lacking on flavor, so probably wasn't as fresh as it should have been (or wasn't from Maine as the menu said it would be), and it was doused in far too much sauce. Ugh. A proper Maine lobster roll has a buttered and toasted hot dog bun stuffed to the brim with fresh lobster meat that has little to nothing else on it. On a more minor note, the French fries served on the side were awful--cold and overcooked. \\n\\nI can't vouch for other options here, but for a great lobster roll in Boston, head to Luke's Lobster, which is owned by brothers from Maine who source their meat from family back home and whose shops produce the best roll I've ever had outside the state."},{"name":"La Cocina de Consuelo","address":"4516 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Really, like eating in someone's kitchen, in the best possible sense.

Pets Alive (wonderful organization). I called the bf and announced I was not making dinner and he needed to meet us on So. Congress for dinner. We all settled on Crepes Mille because unlike most trailer food places - they seemed to have something for everyone in the family. \\n\\n-I got the Chicken Burgundy. It was a little dry but tasted like a hearty meat and potatos kind of meal wrapped up in a pretty pocket. Not bad, but read on.\\n\\n-My bf got the Panang Curry (chicken). We switched halfway through as we often do with new foods. THIS WAS AWESOME. It was a very savory crepe floating in a spicy, milky, curry-y sauce topped with shredded carrots. \\n\\n-After staring at the \\"I dare you to wait 3 hours for a pizza\\" pizza place across the street (no offense), my kiddo decided to get the Pepperoni Pizza crepe (good move Crepes Mille).

I've been to a few of the Vaquero's in Columbus, but yet the one off of Sawmill seems to be the best one consistently.\\n\\nFirst, their patio is clean and open, while somewhat set back from the craziness of Sawmill. You can almost always get a seat on the patio, but if not the interior is by far cleaner than some of the other Vaqueros.  The best part, in my opinion, is that there is a cardio-kickboxing place next door. It might be cruel of me, but for some reason I really enjoy sitting, sipping my jumbo margarita, and watching people bust their ass off. Perhaps it's inappropriate to have a patio so close to the huge glass windows of the athletic place, but I find in humorous none the less.\\n\\nThe margaritas at this location are always better prepared than the others. You can get them frozen or traditional, in regular or jumbo sized. They're usually modestly strong, but if you get lucky sometimes is basically tequila with a splash of flavor. If you're not up for a tasty margarita, they also carry Carta Blanca, aka the ninja beer. This is basically one of the best light beers, and has a slightly higher alcohol content than lighter beers. It goes great with mexican/tex-mex cuisine.\\n\\nWhile the patio and drinks are great, the food is mediocre with much to desire. Their portions are fairly large, but sometimes bland.

Alas, I followed the request of my father who wanted to give it a try. First, I will say the view is fantastic. And their patio set up is great. That might be all the nice things I can conjure up at the moment. If it takes you seven minutes to greet one of your two tables, you should be fired on the spot. Just saying. But she was cute, so I gave her another chance before taking away some of her tip in my head. The bruschetta was good. Not great, but good. My father ordered a cheese burger and a side salad, because four lettuce leaves nulls what a half pound of red meat does to your heart. And I ordered a burger with blue cheese and mushrooms, because I was...well, hungover and I needed it. And a side of their pesto fries. What seemed like an eternity later, our food arrived and the presentation was simple but pretty. I looked down at the hand made beautiful patty and noticed the amount of blue was less than expected, but I ordered some more and went on to dress it. I cut my burger in half, I know...but it was huge...and it's freaking red. Not medium like I ordered, but definitely rare. Screw it, I'm going in. I look at my dads and his is raw. Literally, purple with specs of white from the fat. If I could've found the server, I would've sent it back. But while she was out stewing and pressing tomatoes for the two tablespoons of ketchup he wanted, he was getting even more hungry. And annoyed. He had about five bites around the edges that he could stomach and couldn't do anymore. I'm not one to say anything or ask for the manager in a place but I couldn't sit and watch my father get upset without taking action. Once the server returned from what I'm assuming was a half hour hiatus, I brought it to her attention that her cook needed to know they were messing up some orders. Extremely apologetic, she said she would get her manager. Another 20 minutes go by and the sloppy oaf of a manager comes out insisting that he would replace my fathers burger. After repeatedly telling him no, he got the subtle hint. The bill came and the king of douchebaggery didn't even take it off the check. He took $5 off. That burger cost your kitchen a buck to make, take it off. He clearly didn't eat it. It's just ridiculous. Oh!

When thinking about restaurants to try, my date suggested something African, and she came across this place via (where else?) Yelp. We knew from prior reviews what some of the most recommended dishes were, but nonetheless we asked our server about her recommendations. We wound up sharing peanut butter soup with goat and fufu, sambusas, fried plantains, and a kind of rice ball whose name I don't remember. ALL of it was delicious. As other reviewers have mentioned, fufu has a unique flavor on its own, but when you cut it with a spoon and immerse it in the soup, it absorbs the liquid while remaining delightfully doughy. The plantains were more on the savory side than the sweet, but they weren't at all heavy, despite being fried. The sambusas were very similar to samosas (as my date quipped, \\"every culture has a version of these...\\"), and therefore tasty. As for the soup, I was initially a little nervous, as I had no recollection of trying goat before, and I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter...but the goat was delicious, despite a few bits of gristle, and the soup has a very unique, slightly spicy taste (in a good way) that bears very little resemblance to peanut butter. \\n\\nAll in all, I can't deny that the charming company of my date aided the dining experience, but the food, the service, and the general atmosphere of Drelyse makes it an essential stop for anyone with a taste for West African cuisine."},{"name":"Joe's Crab Shack","address":"3720 West Dublin-Granville Rd.","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"Service was fine.

Run here and get one before they sell out!  Great service too. We couldn't decide on our beers, so our server brought samples of difft beers for us to try.

The service was prompt and friendly without being pushy. The atmosphere was upscale without coming off as overly snooty or trendy. And the food was fantastic. We started off with the spinach and marscapone ravioli and the mushroom arancini. The ravioli was very good; the arancini was one of the greatest things i've ever tasted. Perfect consistency, amazing flavor; I just wish that there was more of it to enjoy since we were splitting among three people.\\n\\nOn the recommendation of a fellow Yelper, I opted for the rigatoni bolognese, and it did not disappoint. A generous helping of pasta was cooked perfectly and came with a fantastic meaty sauce. Others in my group went with the chicken milanese and the pappardelle with marsala veal meatballs, and both were very pleased with their choices as well.

I was disappointed the first time I tried this and other of the \\"old\\" dishes with the new owners, but I have returned several times since then, and each time the food seems to be better than the time before. Now I think I like the new version better.\\n\\ni've liked everything I've had from the Chinese menu -- and my standards for my ratings are based on my years of experience of eating homemade and restaurant Chinese food with several close friends from China. I've also ventured into the Indonesia menu as well -- love their Belacan rice.  Have not tried their Thai options -- too many other good places for Thai food in Columbus. And I have not tried any of their sushi items; their sushi bar has been empty every time I've been there. Having been spoiled on fresh sushi living on both the west and east coast, I do not think this would be my first choice for satisfying any Sushi cravings I might have while I'm here in Columbus.\\n\\nService under the new management has been friendly and efficient. Since I do a fair amount of \\"solo dining\\", I always take note of whether the service is different for soloists vs. group diners or for men vs. women or any other \\"subgroup\\" preferences. They seem to be equally warm, attentive, and efficient for all their diners, which is why it is one of my favorite places when I am dining solo.\\n\\nUPDATE: This place closed in early November 2012, and has been replaced by Jiu Thai Asian Cafe."},{"name":"Mikado Sushi","address":"6417 Raleigh St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I like sushi, but not raw fish nor really any fish.

They were all good!\\n\\nMy wife's noodle bowl dish was kinda lacking in flavor.  I ate about a third of it, but it needed a lot of soy sauce on it to make it better!  Hint: DON'T get the thick noodles.  They're about as thick as 3 quarters stacked on top of each other.

Their portions are very generous and a lunch order can easily turn into dinner for later. \\n\\nI also had an order of Shrimp Spring Rolls.

It's not the same for lunch service as it is for dinner.

Then you sit down and they can find your location of the table you choose (open seating) based on your magic band which is cool.  They deliver your food as its ready.  Some rooms are nicer than others.  The main room reminds me a little of a cafeteria especially during the lunch quick service hours. The rose room is very nice but small and hard to find a table in.

While they may not have the wildly customizable menu and dumb fruity margaritas, they do nail their menu. The $8 house margarita is heavy-handed and fresh, easily my favorite classic margarita in Columbus because it tastes the way a real margarita should taste and I actually feel it after a meal. I would rather pay $8 for a real margarita than $6 for a watered down sugary concoction. We tried the chips and queso this visit and loved it - the queso comes in a cast iron dish and is definitely more of a cream cheese mix than the traditional white cheese with jalapenos you find at other Mexican joints. They also have fun sauces at your table to spice up your meal - my husband was pouring them over his extra chips. The appetizer was easy to share with five people. Everyone ordered a taco and the short rib taco is our favorite - the moist and flavorful meat paired with onion and cheese is so simple yet so delicious. Our friends really enjoyed the mole and al pastor tacos. For everyone that complains about the size and price of these tacos, maybe Bakersfield isn't the place for you. The tacos are served on ~4-5\\" diameter corn tortillas and the ingredients are stacked to the point you can barely hold it in your hand and take a bite. For me, a drink and two tacos or a drink, shared appetizer, and a taco is plenty of food for a meal. If you prefer larger portions or lower quality food, this may not be the best place for you. Bakersfield can get busy fast but I learned they take reservations! We were able to snag 5 seats at the bar at 5 pm on a Saturday but they also serve food at the standing tables and bar seating outside.

I had told my friend that this place is much more upscale from the previous owners who ran the Vietnamese restaurant and that the daughters had renovated and rebranded the dishes.  Upon first entering we saw three people behind the bar.  They all saw us come in and continued to ignore us while they were puttering away. The restaurant was not busy and after a few minutes someone came and we had to wait while they got a table ready.  It took another while longer before someone came and took our order.  There seem to be enough staff around but couldn't understand why we were ignored, certainly not the quick pace of the old restaurant.\\n\\nWe ordered the appetizer special of the day which was soft rice cakes topped with crispy battered shrimp.  It seemed like it was topped with the scooped up remnants of batter that had been floating around in the deep fryer.  I could not detet any meat. It was certainly tasty but we were underwhelmed.\\n\\nWe thought we'd share the assorted combo platter.  Let me tell you this is only enough for one person or it can be treated like an appy on a giant bamboo dish.  The waitress kindly instructed us on how we dip the rice paper and put the toppings on.  This was difficult and messy.  I only had a 3-inch side dish and the rice paper was 5 inches.  And the dipping dish was a bowl-like plate which did not easily allow for the entire rice paper to be dipped so it came out a sticky ruined mess.  How they did not see the logistic of this dish boggles my mind.  I ate this dish without the rice paper.  \\n\\nWe shared the pho with meatballs and beef.  This was delicious but the meatball was the blandest I've ever had from any pho restaurant.  And the side bowl given was awkwardly small.  Again, another logistic oversight?\\n\\nThe pandan tea was a nice touch but it was bitter after soaking for a short time.  It was a lot of tea leaves for a tiny teapot perhaps,\\n\\nThe food is delicious but I was put off by the initial service, or lack thereof.  And having to wrap my own food with a finicky rice paper on too small a plate and awkward dipping bowl really puts me off.  \\n\\nWhen I finally got up to leave a dark-haired waitress with a short bob gave me a look of evil when I blocked her hurried pace.  If we were driving I'd have the right of way, yet stupidly I apologized while she walked away like I had no right.  Earlier in the evening the same thing happened with another waitress and she thanked me when I stepped aside for her.  The walking space in front of the bar should be fixed so that two people can pass through easily.  I bet there has been a lot of dropped trays through here. \\n\\nI would come back because the food is delicious.

There's a small sign on the right of the entrance arch that says \\"Be Our Guest,\\" so keep a look out for it when you're looking for the restaurant.\\n\\nFirst thing's first, you pretty much have to make a reservation. We came to Disney World for the marathon in January and we were staying at Animal Kingdom Lodge so we were able to make reservations 180 days in advance. We definitely took advantage of it and made all of our restaurant reservations at that time and boy does this place fill up quick. We made a reservation for dinner at 5:30 and the next day we wanted to try to move it back to 6:30. When I logged on to see the other available times, there were none! My best advice is that if you have the option to snag reservations, do it as early as you can. \\n\\nSo we walked in and they gave us a tour of the restaurant. There's three themed rooms, so they take you through the whole thing and tell you that you can come back and take photos in each room after you're done with your meal. We ended up being seated in the ballroom which I was so pumped about. It was so beautiful and I just kept staring at the ceiling. \\n\\nAnother cool thing about this restaurant is that they serve beer and wine! This is the only place in the Magic Kingdom that you can grab a drink, and you bet we took advantage of it with a bottle of wine. We figured if we're already here and spending this much money on a meal, we might as well go all out. Oh, did I mention this place is kinda pricey? Yep. \\n\\nI got the steak and my boyfriend got the braised pork. Both were very good but my green beans were outstanding. I LOVE green beans and these really hit the spot. We also got dessert because why not? We got the gray stuff, and it was delicious. I must say that all the other desserts looked super good too. They bring a cart of desserts and allow you to choose which one you want, which is pretty cool. \\n\\nAfter your meal you get to go in the study and take a photo with the Beast himself! No Belle, though, but that's okay.

Once we realized we weren't going to be served at the table we went up to the bar.  The two girl bartenders seemed to be predominantly busy chatting up an older guy at the bar ([possible sugar-daddy material maybe?) and we were slow to be served. and slow on a refill as they kept chatting up the old guy and restocking the bar etc., while were were sitting there right in front of them with glasses that had been empty for awhile.  My husband used his credit card to open a tab and when he closed out and got the check, he didn't get his card back.  He asked for it and she looked but couldn't find it and said that he probably had it and didn't know it.  But no,  he insisted she look again...there it was under who knows what in the register.  The weird smell I couldn't define was something having to do with food.

So when we heard it had a face-lift and is now serving cocktails, we wanted to see how this new wave of \\"modern\\" Vietnamese restaurant concept works out.  \\n\\nThey don't take resos but the wait time for dinner on a weekend was about 20mins, not too bad, plus they had a patio area that we were able to sit at while we waited.  The service was very friendly, and the menu was much shorter than it used to be but definitely easier to look at and more focused.  The food was not drastically different from other Vietnamese restaurants, but I do have to say their lemon grass chicken/pork with rice had huge meat portions compared to other places.  All in all, everything was delicious and well presented.  We ordered the sangria type drink (forgot the name) a pitcher of it was pretty tiny, but it was very refreshing and a nice twist on the traditional sangria.  Also ordered the salted plum soda, very interesting sweet/sour drink, like a lemonade but different.  Also, it's good to note that they don't offer the typical drinks you can get from Vietnamese restaurants (like shakes, lychee ice, etc), they do have the iced coffee though.\\n\\nOverall, great place to grab food and drinks.  The drinks and ambience are really what sets this place apart from other Vietnamese places.

First off we have a party of 6 and stated clearly when we made our reservations that we were using Entertainment coupons but upon seating the waitress advised us only one coupon will be accepted.  Not that this was a big deal but we wish we were advised prior to our arrival or when we made our reservation as they have always accepted more than one coupon before.

Weird and not an ingredient that would compliment afternoon tea and the rest of their menu.  We are all for fusion dining but not at high tea.  Lastly ... can you say afternoon tea in the jungle!  The restaurant's temperature was ridiculous high evenly though it was raining and 12 degrees outside!  All patrons and staff were roasting with rosy cheeks.

So...white people, I guess.\\n\\nThe service wasn't terrible, but it wasn't by any means good. Our little waiter guy seemed either new or just out of it. It was also a bit weird that everything came out on large trays. E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G.\\n\\n-Salsa? Large Tray. (ok. They mix in some heat table-side if you want it. So, that's understandable.\\n-Queso? Large Tray.\\n-2 Margaritas? Large Tray. \\n\\nBut all weirdness aside, this can all be forgiven in the face of great food. Or good food. Decent food, perhaps? \\n\\nNo. The margaritas tasted like pure sugar water. Like someone not only forgot to add in liquor, but also stood over the mixing bucket, looking off in the distance, while pound after pound of powdery lime-flavored sugar was dumped in. \\n\\nThe salsa was decent. I like the added heat part, but really? Salsa needs to sit and marinate if that flavor is really going to permeate? And honestly, it was the best part of our meal. \\n\\nThe queso was what I've sadly come to expect from mediocre-to-terrible places in town. Yellow, gelatinous, flavorless, quickly congealing, and likely more suited to being used as insulation for low income housing. There was no offer of a yellow or white queso as their online menu depicts. \\n\\nThen, we get to the enchiladas. A dish I'm seeing done poorly more and more around town. Is this really so difficult? No. No, it's not. I make them myself, and they're damn good when they're good. This is one of the staples of tex-mex cuisine that should depend on whether a restaurant gets to stay open or gets devoured by chupacabra. These were the latter type. \\n\\nFirst off, if I look you square in the eye and ask you about your mol√©, saying that I'm really REALLY picky about my mol√©, don't lie to me. It has to be homemade, it has to have some kick, it has to convey the array of flavors that I know (first-hand) go into the laborious task of making mol√©. This stuff tasted like chocolate and very little else.\\n\\nSecondly, and perhaps more importantly to enchiladas and their chupacabra-repelling properties, don't make your enchiladas so dry that I have to suck down some of my awful margarita to quench my thirst. Now, they don't have to be swimming in sauce. But they DO have to have cheese somewhere in the vicinity of the inside or outside of the enchilada. Oh, i know you can make a pretty drizzle of crema so that you don't feel bad about charging this much for these. And yes, I'm sure the first street-food-type enchiladas were not so cheese-centric as the typical tex-mex culture demands. But damn it, we demand it. There were two plates of enchiladas on our table, and not one. speck. of. cheese.\\nOH yes! I looked in there. We searched high and low for cheese, but none was to be found. Top that off with the fact that they obviously just used dry tortillas, filled them and covered them with sauce, and you find out just how bad an enchilada can be. \\n\\nPerhaps we ordered all the wrong things.

So if you want a seat I suggest you go a little bit early to wait in line.  For dinner it's sit down and reservations are highly recommended.  Usually if you don't have a reservation you won't be able to eat.\\n\\nThe decor of this restaurant is absolutely fantastic.  You might say to yourself it's Disney and they always have good theming.  But the imagineers went above and beyond for this restaurant. From the moment you walk across the drawbridge outside to through the double doors you feel like you have just been transported to Beast's castle.  Inside you are greeted by two large statues and if you're going there for lunch you go through a corridor lined with knights in armor statues.  These are no ordinary statutes and if you listen closely you can hear them snore and such.  \\n\\nInside the restaurant it is split into 3 rooms to dine.  The first and largest is the ballroom, then there is the West wing and finally the Rose Gallery.  Each room is themed and decorated wonderfully.\\n\\nThe food for lunch is one of the best on property.  A must try is the steak sandwich.  The prices may be a little steep for, but it's Disney.  And you're really paying for the ambience.\\n\\nDinner food is also very good.  The one surprise here is during dinner you can order beer and wine.  It's the only restaurant at Magic Kingdom that allows this.  So if you need a drink after spending a long day at the park then make reservations here.\\n\\nThis is one of the best restaurants in Magic Kingdom and if you in the park it's a must try.

My experience is based on having brunch there, and using the recent TravelZoo deal (2 entrees, 1 tapa, 2 non-alc drinks = $25). Had it not been for the deal, I would have felt grossly overcharged.\\n\\nYou should know we're pescatarians, so this only applies to the fish- and veggie-friendly offerings. For the brunch, we both got the Nicoise salad with the blistered shishito peppers as the tapa. The peppers were good, but for the quantity maybe a little overpriced. The salads, at $14 each, were of adequate size but should cost half of the menu price. The tuna was canned, which our server was somewhat shamefaced to admit , but said was \\"high quality Italian or Spanish\\" (they DID tell us it was canned, so good on them for being honest). To their credit, the soft-boiled egg was done to perfection, and the fried capers were delicious but there were not enough of them. Also, we had two Americanos with our meal, and they were perfection. Not overly-watered or burnt tasting espresso, but rich and flavorful.\\n\\nOverall I think FINO is part of the growing trend of overcharging for small-ish portions of relatively uninspired food, where the price is based more on a hip appearance and and local cachet than quality food and transformative recipes. I also had one of their mixed drinks, the El Diablo, and while it was tasty, it was weak and and overpriced for the small volume it occupies (you're fooling no one by filling a highball glass entirely with crushed ice). If you want good drinks at $10 a pop, got to Midnight Cowboy, not here. If you want good vege/pesc brunch, check out Cherrywood Cafe, 24 Diner, etc but not here. If you've got a TravelZoo coupon, it might be worth checking out.

Both of these desserts were fabulous. The ricotta resembled a cheesecake and the sorbetto and crumble that went along with it provided the perfect amount of crunch and sweetness. The lemon tart had a crust on the top that was just like the nice crunch on a creme brulee. I'd have happily eaten both all by myself if I hadn't been stuffed.\\n\\nNeedless to say I loved this place and it was one of the best meals I've had in months. It's definitely on the pricey side but it's a perfect place to go if you're a foodie or for a special occasion. I'd give it 4.5 stars, I took away 1/2 a star because when they gave us our wine pairings we ordered the 1/2 glasses because it had been a long day but they ended up giving us some of the most expensive 1/2 glasses that weren't on the original menu and I felt a little cheated.

You know, the ones guilty of the whole, \\"don't want anyone driving my car but me\\" complex. Yeah, and the best part is my car ain't really all that great. So here's the punchline, if you've got clients, and you know who you are, or you just dig on some Asian Fusion cuisine that will rock your socks, Roy's is the place for you. The best part is the name, Roy's. I mean, even typing it now, I am second guessing myself... Is it really called that? Roy's? It just sounds to much like a joint with peanut shells on the floor. Alas, Roy's provides the perfect combination of helpful service, well prepared dishes, and a flood of shaded natural light all waiting for your every request. As soon as you step through the elegant, understated solid wood door, you get the feeling that Roy's is all about one thing, you. The service is clean, attentive, and positive. All of our dining related questions were answered promptly, professionally and completely void of the typical, \\"I am not sure, but let me check with the kitchen\\" type of statements I had grown so accustom to at other \\"Fine Dinning\\" Restaurants. Did I mention they have beer on tap, and not just one label, big points for that. The Macadamia Nut-Crusted Mahi Mahi is as much of a treat to eat as it is fun to pronounce. And, since no one living in Atlanta is actually from Atlanta, you can always recommend the Charbroiled Short Ribs of Beef to your (Mid-Western transplant) clients. Seriously people, are we still going to talk about Ohio State for the third year in a row! I digress, Roy's is the spot for casual, professional service and atmosphere that delivers upscale tasting treats that are pleasing to the palette and eyes. They even delivered on the post meal coffee, where the real bidnezz talk takes place... Must be Kona. \\nAnd the best part, you get to park your own dope ride, but remember...

We'd made reservations, and had a very nice table overlooking the water.  Our waitress, Chelsea, was very attentive and good.  We have no complaints with her at all.  My complaints are for two specific things, one being that my Mahi was NOT cooked all the way through --- to the point of one half of it being inedible.  The other half was cooked through, and it's somewhat good that I ate that half first.  I did not call attention to the fact that the other half of the fillet was not cooked because at that point in our meal, I did not want to wait for the raw  half to be cooked.   \\n\\nWe finished our meal and paid our well-over $100 check  and got in a queue of patrons at the hostess' desk asking if they could call a taxi, since it was raining steadily and while we were prepared with an umbrella, it was raining hard enough to make foot-covering pools of water to walk in to get back to our nearby hotel.  One of the 3 or 4 hostess women standing behind the desk informed the gathered group that do not call taxis for people, unless there is a party of 9 or more!  We were rather surprised that a restaurant who'd just been paid over $100 for food would not bother to call a taxi for their patrons when it was pouring down rain!  \\n\\nMy husband, along with several other groups of unhappy patrons, walked in the rain to the nearby Marriott, where they were more than happy to whistle up a taxi for people who had not even paid them a dime.   \\n\\nThe next time I got to a restaurant in Boston, it will be quite unlikely it will be the Chart House, and furthermore, the next time I go to a Landry's of any sort, I will remember this treatment of their customers.\\n\\nI'm giving the restaurant 2 stars because I have definitely had better food at Landry's restaurants and I have CERTAINLY been treated more kindly by hostess staff at other restaurants."},{"name":"Qieu Caf√©","address":"628 Abbott Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"The service is REALLY slow so don't go here if you're super hungry.

My burger was ordered medium, but was more pink in the center than my husband's - we both ordered them the same temperature. There was no time to ask for the burger to be thrown on the grill, so I just decided to eat it. I don't have an issue with rare meat, but with burgers I do prefer to have them cooked properly. That being said, I didn't get ill from the burger, so that is a plus :)\\n\\nI opted for the sweet potato fries and I was disappointed. They were greasy and limp. My husband went for the tater tots and they were perfectly crispy and delicious. We asked for extra napkins and hot sauce and both were brought promptly. Our server was also the bar tender and host (person showing patrons to their table). I appreciated his attentiveness while serving many functions.\\n\\nOne note is that this location is near the Beltline, so it's very convenient if you're heading to/from there.

You know how it can be in P-town sometimes: my hair wasn't sufficiently slacker-tousled, I didn't have my dirty vintage duds on, and I was wearing contacts instead of my hot bookish glasses. I looked too non-Portland, even though I am pretty sure I was one of only two native Portlanders there that night. The second time I went, it was hot, I was sweaty, I was starving, meeting good friends, and I just didn't care. Second trip was much more enjoyable, because I finally began to see Clyde Common for what it was and not what I thought it was.\\n\\nThe restaurant is designed with attitude, the food is prepared with attitude -- and I don't mean the bad we're-too-good-for-you attitude that seems rampant in new Portland restaurants these days. Clyde Common exudes an air of Portland creativity and rebelliousness without pretention; it's the rockin' carefree whatever attitude that I love more. \\n\\nYou'll dine at long, shared community tables, which I love. Every time I've been there, I've had great conversations with the servers about either the food or the beverages; they are very knowledgeable and passionate about what they serve at Clyde Common, and they don't pretend to know it all. If they don't have the answer, they send someone over that does know. \\n\\nOnto the important parts: the drinks? Outstanding. Of course, I've only had a couple of drinks here, and I like sticking with my favorite: the Bourbon Revival. It's most excellent. The food? Fabulous. Their happy hour is incredible! Full burgers - huge burgers - for super cheap! Drinks for $5 instead of the usual $8-10. The popcorn with pimento topping is a great starter. The steak is done well, the tagliatelle is divine, and the salads are satisfying on their own. \\n\\nSo go to Clyde Common and don't be afraid that you're not cool enough. They'll make you feel like you are way cooler than they are, and that is an amazing quality in a Portland restaurant."},{"name":"Anh and Chi","address":"3388 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I drove by this place many time and decided go come in for lunch.

Never had anything but good experiences at this location, too. We were a party of four, were seated immediately, and ordered our beverages within minutes of being seated. We had a general idea of what we wanted so we were ready to order. Three teriyaki donburi, one ginger chicken udon. We had a picky eater in our midst so she specified her order to be \\"JUST the chicken with teriyaki sauce on brown rice. Alone.\\" Our waitress wrote her number with a star on her place mat (they write accompanying numbers on your paper place mat for everything you order) so we assumed all was good and understood. We also ordered steamed pork gyoza. Before long, a runner arrives with the three chicken teriyakis- all regular but one with brown rice. So our picky eater still received the carrots, bean sprouts and scallion garnish. Quite irritating as she'd specified pretty outwardly- literally saying chicken, rice, and sauce only- but it wasn't a huge deal since everything was on top and not mixed in. At this point we are still waiting for the udon and the gyoza. Ten minutes go by, none of us eating, waiting for our last member to get her lunch. Eventually another runner appears with the noodles. Still no dumplings. We eat, everyone is mostly satisfied with their food. I always think that their teriyaki lacks actual teriyaki sauce, and my companions agree so we all ask for extra sauce. That takes another ten minutes to come. Still no dumplings. When someone appears with the sauce, we follow up on the gyoza. They disappear and ten minutes later they finally arrive, pan fried. Again, the order was wrong. We ate them anyways since we had already eaten half of our main courses by this point. The filling of the gyoza was tough and tasted like it had a lot of ginger. The dipping sauce, which is usually sweet and tangy, tasted like straight up vinegar. So overall the long awaited dumplings came incorrect and were not the best. We also never got any refills, not including the luke warm bottle of water they leave on your table. I understand the style of the restaurant, but it gets confusing when you're missing items and don't know who to ask since so many servers have been waiting on you throughout the meal. Also gets weird for tipping because the waitress who took our orders basically did just that; took our orders and gave us our check. I do love the food at wagamama most of the time, but this experience was not up to par with my numerous other visits, and it wasn't even busy. Prices are fair for the area.

There is ample seating available because the restaurant size is gigantic so this is the one place where you don't have to worry about making reservations and there is plenty of space between tables so there is no issues with squeezing into your seat. My family's favourites are the hagow, deep fried calamari (which is squid steak... so incredibly good), deep fried bean curd with shrimp and vegetable which is just a touch of spinach for colour, deep fried footballs are crispy and have a thin wall, steamed bean curd, steam spare ribs which I think are the BEST i have ever tasted with the most delectable sauce, and for the adventurous folks, the steamed tripe I won't leave without having.

We were not disappointed. It was absolutely wonderful. As has been mentioned in earlier reviews, the owner is a very amiable and approachable woman. She was very helpful in showing us how to eat our dishes with our hands without making a complete mess. We started the meal of with one vitumbua each. Vitumbua are rice patties that are fried to golden-brown and served while still warm. They are slightly sweet but not overpoweringly so, and they were so delicious that we were tempted to order more. For his main course, my boyfriend ordered the beef peanut butter soup with fufu (a doughy ball made of ground cassava). The owner showed us the proper technique for pinching off pieces of fufu, molding it into a sort of saucer shape, and using it to scoop up pieces of the soup. The soup was very flavorful and delicious, and the mellow taste and starchy texture of the fufu blended with the soup in perfect harmony. The pieces of beef in the soup were extremely rich and hearty. I had the grilled tilapia, which is the most pricey item on the menu but totally worth it. It is a whole fish, grilled completely intact, which is served to you covered with tomatoes, onions, and peppers and with a tomato relish on the side. It was the best fish I've ever eaten in the States. Every mouthful burst with flavor, and I ended up eating the whole fish in one sitting. As soon as we were done my boyfriend and I vowed that we would be back as soon as possible, and that next time we'd bring  lots of friends with us with whom to share this gem!\\n\\nIn short, everything about Drelyse is a wonderfully pleasant experience. The dining area is very clean and well-lit, the service is very friendly and timely, and the food is absolutely delicious.

My 2 son's, thrilled that they wouldn't have to go, and my husband accomplished. \\nThe day arrived, we had heard the West wing was THE place to sit. So we arrived 1 hour early to our reservation to request the West Wing. Hostess said no problem. 5 minutes later, our table was ready! \\nFrom the moment you walk in, you feel like you have just walked into the Beasts castle. It is exactly like what you see in the movies. The West Wing is dark and stormy with lightning and thunder and every 7 minutes 30 seconds (approx) there's loud thunder and the enchanted rose that is glowing in the corner loses another petal. You are seated and Everything in fast paced. Efficient wait staff takes your order, shortly after the food starts coming, then dessert. After your meal and paying the check, you are free to roam around the castle and take photos. When you are ready to leave, you exit through the study where the Master, Beast himself is waiting for a photo opportunity with you.\\n\\nThe 2nd time we went, we just stopped by the hostess desk, asked if there happened to be availability for 3, she called down to the castle and they said yes!

Hubs ordered the shrimp and scallop pasta dish. Tasted so good but only had 2 scallops and 4 small shrimp. I ordered the Ratatouille with chicken skewer. At 1st bite it was a bit acidic and I thought I'd be suffering from heartburn but then once I kind of mixed my food together, it was delicious! The chicken skewer however was not! It was dry and tasteless. No seasonings at all. Yuck. My daughter ordered the steak again because she loved it so much and it didn't disappoint.

The baked goods look delicious and fresh. The sandwich menu, however, was TRULY insane. All of the ingredients are listed on the chalkboard, and all of the combinations looked creative and delicious. Order a turkey sandwich here and you won't be getting your run-of-the-mill turkey/American/lettuce/tomato/mayo deal. You'll get something with avocado spread, or pepper spread, and some interesting vegetable component (sweet potato, less-common sprouts, etc.), and a higher-end cheese like boursin or gruyere just to name a couple. The menu, overall, looked inspired, and those eating looked very pleased with their large, exotic sammies.\\n\\nWhat I DID get was an Iced Non-Fat Quintuple Mocha. (Yes, I love my caffeine.) Now, I'm an ex-barista (RIP Natural Bean!), so I can pretty clearly see what's right and what's wrong with their drinks. First of all, it's great that their standard is \\"two shots per small, three shots per medium, four shots per large\\"; at most cafes, it's one less, unless you ask, and then you have to pay. That makes for a stronger drink, rather than some milk with a splash of espresso.\\n\\nThe barista asked if I was sure about my order, which was actually a good idea. Sometimes people order an extra shot and don't realize what they're doing, then spend the rest of the day shaking. Points for being attentive.\\n\\nI paid $5.30 for my drink. That's the most I've ever paid for that drink by at least $0.50. (Why so expensive? I don't even think it was organic.) I figured, hey, maybe it'll be worth it.\\n\\nWhilst waiting for my drink, though, I didn't really know where to stand. The bar area was cramped and I was basically leaned up against a table where someone was trying to enjoy a sandwich, while people were trying to shimmy by each other. Not easy to move around in this place.\\n\\nAlso, they don't call out drink names as they come up on the bar; they only call out the name of the customer. (As in, they didn't say Iced Non-Fat Quintuple Mocha; they just said, \\"Shelly!\\") This sounds really picky, but the fact is, when you're a barista and you say EXACTLY what the drink is as you're putting it up on the bar, that shows the customer that you made it to their exact specifications; or, it gives them an opportunity to correct the order if you call it out wrong. I can't tell you how many times I called out, \\"Double-Medium Hazelnut Latte!\\" and had the customer say, \\"I thought that was supposed to be non-fat?\\" so that I got a chance to re-make it right away and give them what they wanted. It's a small point but ensures that everyone is satisfied before they walk out the door.\\n\\nWhen I actually sipped my mocha... Ehhh. First of all, there were two pumps of mocha in it. That's not really enough for a large. I had to add splenda, which I've never done to a mocha. And the espresso itself... I dunno, with five shots, it should have tasted EXTREMELY strong and it just... didn't. (Maybe they missed the extra shot... The barista didn't really look like he was concentrating too hard... but I can't be sure; they didn't call it out!) It also had this oddly sour taste? Not of bad milk, but maybe of a poorly-pulled shot. Maybe they need to recalibrate their espresso machine?\\n\\nI don't recommend the espresso drinks, and I didn't enjoy my time inside the store, but from what I saw of the menu, I WOULD recommend the sandwiches. And their non-espresso drinks looked pretty cool, too."},{"name":"Villa Nova Ristorante","address":"5545 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Oh how I love you, Villa Nova.\\n\\nGranted I've never had the pleasure to eat in the dining room, only the very odd and entertaining bar area. \\n\\nFirst off, beers are HUMONGOUS and very cold. They have a decent amount of drafts, and they're always priced well. The bartenders look like they've been working there for quite some time, little rough... But that's the way I like 'em! They're great at what they do. There's always free popcorn in the machine, and certain days they have pans of free pizza and wings next to the machine on warmers. \\n\\nOnto the food... 99.9% of the time, I get the pizza. It's a very thin crackery crust and they load, I mean load the toppings. It's fantastic. On the rare occasion I haven't gotten the pizza, I had the italian sub which was great and the house salad, which is basic but their house italian is really good. \\n\\nSo far, I have nothing bad to report.

If i were a vegetarian I'd love the fact they have a separate kitchen for those dishes, so that's kinda of cool they do that.

This place does it right, from the amazing design/decor right down to the homemade bitters they use in their drinks and the housemade flatbreads..  I wish I could remember exact what dishes my dinnermates and I have had each time, but I eat a lot of food..  :)  So I will highlight the favorites here...\\n\\nFirstly, they used to have a cocktail made with fresh beet juice-- Fino, pleeeeease bring it back!!!  It was amazing.\\n\\nOne time I got some sort of pasta dish with Greek yogurt which was amazing.    Softly folded ravioli-like pockets...\\n\\nThe red pepper/walnut/pomegranate spread with grilled flatbread is absolutely bowl-lickingly delectable.\\n\\nBlistered padron peppers with sea salt!  Grown from actual Spanish seeds-- too legit!  :)  The heat in these peppers is just right and they make for an amazing bar snack..\\n\\nThe last time we visited was paella night-- 50% off paella between 5 and 7pm and 25% off after 7pm.  C and I had the seafood paella (though the special, with chorizo and chicken, was tempting too and we will definitely return for it).  There is no shortage of mussels, shrimp, or calimari-- and lots of tentacles, not just rings!  C took great pleasure in watching me devour them though he himself abstained :)  The paella has layers of flavor-- saffron and smoke finished with a citrus aioli... a waiter told us that , in Spain, people fight over the crispiest layer against the bottom of the pan... and it's no wonder!\\n\\nWe managed to fit dessert in the mix (to quote Clinton, bartender extraordinaire, \\"it's just a little pudding!  who doesn't have room for pudding??\\")-- it had the very crisp sugared top of creme brulee but was creamier inside... very palette- cleansing after the taste sensations we'd just experienced..\\n\\nThe drinks!  I haven't even mentioned them yet and they are such a big part of the experience here.  They are most known for the Bee Sting, which won an award in New Zealand, but there are many other winning concoctions on the menu.  This last time I had a Mai Tai unlike any other... housemade almond syrup and orange bitter liqueur??? Sold!  \\n\\nThey also pay meticulous attention to detail-- some drinks call for crushed ice so they'll crush it with a mallet right in front of you.  Others, maybe just cracked ice, and so on.  I was once allowed to look through the recipe book of various tinctures and bitters  made at the bar-- incredible!!  Sitting at the bar is almost like sitting at the counter of some sort of apothecary, just watching as they create all sorts of magical tonics and liquid antidotes..\\n\\nEvery waiter or bartender I've had is so knowledgeable, answering any question without skipping a beat, making excellent and justified recommendations, and dropping culinary side stories when appropriate!  All of this perfection and so free of pretention too!  It's great to go somewhere where it feels like everyone is in it for the love of the food.  Fino is definitely that kind of place."},{"name":"Chatime","address":"1545 West Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I can honestly say that all of my high hopes and dreams for Chatime were squashed when I ordered and received the taro milk tea with coconut jelly/pudding jelly. Aside from the fact that it genuinely tastes like someone stirred vanilla protein mix in to water and passed it off as bubble tea, there seems to be some confusion with the signage in store. I tried ordering it with different jellies that I read off of the jelly list, and it seems the ones I chose in particular are ones they have never carried in-store. Also, I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in the price per cup-size ratio, as their \\"regular\\" size is not even comparable to other fairly priced, actually regular sized bubble tea shops. Strangely grainy and tasteless, I give this drink a generous 1/5 (despite the workers being pleasant enough). I mean, I was so disappointed I downloaded the Yelp app to write a review!

First, the place is far, far too loud. I couldn't hear the person seated at my table- this was exceedingly bad. \\n\\nNext- the seating: instead of cramping people into what could be considered \\"picnic table\\" styled seating, they should just have fewer tables.  \\n\\nWe had a gift certificate that my friend PURCHASED in a silent auction for a charity. When she paid with it, the waiter went over to consult with the manager. He then comes back and says that when a gift certificate is \\"donated\\" , there is no cash back AND no credit given for a future visit. The tab was $85 and the gc was for $100. They asked if we wanted another glass of wine, which we declined. We just let them keep the $15, not like we had a choice.  I think what upset me most about the exchange was the part about it having been \\"donated\\". My pal paid good money for that gc, and we resented being treated like bums.\\n\\nP.S.

The atmosphere when I walked in made me like the place immediately. It was about 1:30 pm on a Friday - I had the day off and my dad came up to visit - his request was Italian food. Villa Nova delivered. It was bustling with local family and friends meeting and chatting for lunch. The perfect place for my dad and I to have our family visit. They offer all the things you want when the Italian crave hits - a classic menu. Which is why I choose it. I wish I had the vegetable lasagna instead of what I ordered, which was the meat spaghetti. My favorite food is spaghetti so I can be too picky. My 3 Star is highly based off this. Don't let it deter you! The noodles were really amazing!!! Small yellow egg noodles that made the lacking meat sauce worth eating. It wasn't bad but ehhh.... really wish I'd made another choice. Or got what my dad got. I had been eyeing it and mentioned to him the dish included house made Italian sausage - this must have swayed his decision bc last second he changed his selection and ordered it! Way to go dad! I high fived him for his good choice :) He ordered the Sausage Cacciatore. Their house made spicy Italian sausage - and - it is spicy - not mouth burning - but deff hot - and you can tell it's home made!! Sooooo good. Would love to try a sausage sandwich. The spices are really robust and over power the heat - you taste the heat after you taste all the Italian seasonings! Mmmmmm.....Best thing we had while their. Included onions, green peppers & mushrooms, with tomato sauce and their standout out spaghetti noodles. You could tell the veggies were well simmered into the sauce and melted well into the noodles. Entrees come w bread sticks and a choice of side salad or soup for $3. House dressing is an ok creamy balsamic. Very reasonable prices and I really liked that you could get wine, a good selection of it too. We looked into the bar on the other side just out of curiosity.

It's right next door to a friend's apartment, and he wants to like it, too. I've been twice, and my friend has been who-knows-how-many-times. Honestly, when there is a Japanese noodle restaurant with reasonable prices right next door to your home, who's actually going to count the number of times you go there? \\n\\nHere's the problem: The first time I went, I just thought I had ordered the wrong thing. Their vegetarian udon noodle soup had nothing going on, but I couldn't be too mad about it. I mean, come on, it was vegetarian udon noodle soup. It would have been nice if it had been delicious, but I couldn't get into too much of a tizzy about my passable meal. Now, the second time I went, I thought I knew better, but after one bite of miso noodle soup, I began thinking to myself, \\"Maybe they just don't do vegetarian food very well.\\" I can accept if a restaurant relies on eel and pork to make their dishes tasty. Sure, I wouldn't usually eat there, but I can still accept it. \\n\\nI kept my opinions mostly to myself throughout the meal, except for that one moment when I was working hard to take a big ol' bite of noodles, but instead put down my chopsticks and muttered under my breath, \\"This... isn't very good.\\" My disapproval was confirmed later as my friend and I left the restaurant and he said quite genuinely, \\"I wish the food there was better.\\" Ah ha! He had eaten both pork *and* eel that night, and he was still not satisfied! Upon further prompting, he confessed that it's never as good as he hopes, yet he keeps going back. \\n\\nWith all of this being said, I guarantee that I will eat there again at some point in the future.

How do you judge if it is \\"authentic\\" taqueria? Do they serve menudo on the weekends, lengua and have only meat, beans, rice and salsa fresca on their standard burrito?\\n\\nAs good as the food offerings are in Vancouver, a really good burrito is still elusive. I would give El Taco's chicken burrito a 2.5 - which in comparison to other burritos in Vancouver is really good.  But lettuce on a burrito - really? The only thing that it contributes to is a small stream of watery juice running up your arm when you attempt to eat it by hand and the lagoon at the bottom of your food basket. The chicken was moist, plentiful but not as strongly flavoured as it might have been. The rice is just blah and the beans although healthier than their CA counterparts, seemed to be missing the lard component. I won't even address all of the other superfluous junk they put on it. The salsa selection was the saving grace with the chipotle being quite delicious and adding the necessary zip to the somewhat bland burrito innards. I cannot also stress the importance of wrapping a really tight burrito because nothing is worse than leaning in for a bite and having the thing collapse. If you are forced to eat the sucker with a fork then IMHO it ceases to be a burrito.\\n\\nI have rounded up the rating to a 3 simply because of geographic necessity. My 5's are La Costena and Tacqueria La Bamba in Mountain View, CA and obviously not easy to get to.

Just read one and then skip to paragraph three:\\n\\nIntro #1: Part of my daily regime involves precision with numbers. If I tell you I've driven past this Culver's three hundred forty-two times without giving it a second thought, that number is accurate. (Incidentally, what happened to the Eurway that was next door?) When a colleague suggested having lunch at Culver's, it seemed like a good idea since neither of us had been there before. \\n\\nIntro #2: Want to know how to pass out quickly? Don't eat carbs for twenty-three days and then come to Culver's and slam down a double mushroom-swiss burger and two chocolate milkshakes. Just another inexplicable moment when I've completely flummoxed myself with my own actions. When a colleague suggested having lunch at Culver's, it seemed like a good idea since neither of us had been there before. \\n\\nNow I'm first to admit when I'm wrong about something: For no good reason, I thought I would dislike Culver's, but it turned out to be a fun place, and a fun place with tasty food. Happy shiny people eating, cheery greetings, friendly smiling staff, bright lights, colorful dining area, popular menu choices--imagine a sincere and enthusiastic m√©nage among Dan's, Dairy Queen, and Top Notch, and you pretty much have a Culver's. \\n\\nWhile my burger was being made-to-order, they gave me my milkshake at the counter; when they brought my burger to our table, it arrived with another milkshake. When I took the extra one back, they cheerfully made me keep it. (Did you really think I would order two milkshakes?) My colleague received a free scoop of Culver's frozen custard because his order of fries contained a prize-winning, super duper five-inch fry--he was beaming like he just won Megabucks. \\n\\nAll things considered, this place reminded me of a small traveling carnival, but in a nice way, run by nice people, and pleased as punch that you're there with them.

We booked this restaurant weeks in advance prior to our vacation and all the videos and reviews got us all excited to come to this place. It came highly recommended but when we finally got to dine in, we were unpleasantly surprised. Yes, the building was beautiful, the paintings we great, the venue itself was wonderful. However, I don't think it's worth paying the price for. First, the food was just average. The food came to us cold and the portions were pretty small. Don't get the poached egg--the eggs are overcooked and not runny, and the bread is stale. The pastries seem like they come prepackaged and not fresh. Next, you get your own drinks and silverware which is like a buffet type experience more than a classy high end restaurant feel you'd think you'd get from a place as beautiful as this. And lastly, the staff look so tired and worn out, we can't even get excited cuz even they look so depressed! They come to your table not even smiling--and we came at 10AM! For being as highly recommended as this place is, I think Be Our Guest needs to step up their game a little bit. Honestly, if you want to take pictures with the characters, you can't really find them around the restaurant like most ads say you would. It might be easier to just find a character spot instead of wasting money on food and experience you'd have if you had chosen to go to one of the quick restaurants around Magic Kingdom.

Once you are able to place your order, it takes about 30 minutes for your food to come out.

It was mostly chopped tomatoes with chunks of jalepenos and onions thrown in, so the salsa was dry and unevenly flavored.\\n\\nI ordered the taco salad, which was ok, but the \\"guacamole\\" they used was definitely not made from fresh avocados.

After all, there are about 20 other pizza joints within a five block radius of Church Street.  Needless to say, the SoDo location is much more convenient for those that don't live at 55 West (which, incidentally, is everyone).\\n\\nThis is one of the few Orlando pizza places to which I've been that can actually lay claim to the fact that they serve speciality or gourmet pizza.  I have never- NEVER- seen smoked duck offered on a pizza before.  My party settled on incredibly fresh and tasty side salads to start (Caesar and house), and the Spicy Spanish and Hawaiian pizzas as main entrees.  The Spicy Spanish was great (chorizo, pepper jack, roma tomatoes, jalapenos, and black olives), and the Hawaiian was delicious in its non-traditional (yet probably more traditional, really) use of pulled pork, macadamia nuts, and pepper jack in addition to pineapple and barbeque sauce.  The only misfire was the barbeque sauce was extremely uneven, so some slices seemed a little off.\\n\\nThe service was efficient, and I will definitely be back.

They did a lot of things right. They also touched on some of my pet peeves at good restaurants.\\n\\nReservations - 25 minutes for a table is too long to wait if you've made a reservation and show up on time. They were friendly at the front (and fair) and it could have just been a matter of timing but I'd rather go somewhere I don't have to stand in line with no knowledge of when I'll get to eat.\\n\\nFood temperature - burning hot plates tell me that my food has been sitting around under a heat lamp waiting to brought over. An appetizer that was too hot to eat and a burger that was lukewarm were big turn-offs.\\n\\nCocktails - I know they can't pour it on heavy on the first round since they want people to order multiple rounds, but 2-3oz of a mixed drink is just way too light. I think every bar needs real rocks glasses, too, no matter what. \\n\\nIn general, service was friendly. It was a little hard to catch the waitress. This may just be me, but  the chairs are damn uncomfortable. They have a weird shape that sticks into your lower back, too low to really be lumbar support. I never really found a good position. The booth side of the table was nice. I didn't get the same claustrophobic feeling that other reviews have mentioned. The spacing is comparable to other good restaurants in the area (I have to admit I was dreading being seated at one of the tables down the center aisle as we followed the host, though).\\n\\nAs a side note, I didn't really dig the atmosphere inside. It just seemed like a lot of older couples and families going out for dinner and a movie in Boston. I comment on the \\"scene\\" sometimes not because it's a reflection on the management but just because it's good to know. The design itself was nice, though. The blue lighting works well with the space. I kind of wished they'd done something so they entire restaurant didn't feel like one big hallway.\\n\\nWhat they did well - awesome beet salad. Great white grape vodka cocktail. The lobster pasta dish alone was almost enough to get 4 stars. Apparently it was just what my gf had been looking for in such a dish for a long time in Boston. Semifreddo dessert was very good. When it came time to leave, I appreciated that the check came quickly and everything was wrapped up and we closed out smoothly. It's worth mentioning because it seems to happen frequently in Boston where it takes 20 - 30 minutes after the meal just to get moving. Teatro was much more organized and the supplemental staff did a great job filling water, clearing food and cleaning the table before dessert (though those wiping off the tables after people leave should be more careful not to splatter the people still eating adjacent).\\n\\nAh, and again I've written more than I intended. It's just hard to boil down. I'd give Teatro 3.5 stars if I could but I can't really say I'm a fan.

Atmosphere: As an Architecture student, while I love the open kitchen flowing to the dining area concept, this is NOT the place to go if you want to carry on a conversation whilst eating or imbibing. ITS VERY LOUD! My friend and I got the end of one of the communal tables next to the kitchen, and that was quiet enough to actually hear one another. I found the service from the time I sat at the bar, to when we were served to be rather indifferent and spotty when we got their attention. The bar is where CC excels: Great selection of bourbon that rivals any in town, interesting mixed drink selection on my examination of the menu and a very Representative wine list of old world and new world selections. If this establishment would take the same care and thoughtfulness towards their food, they would have a smashingly great venue. Sadly this wasn't the case on our visit Thursday past. The roasted beet, egg, fava bean w/dijon dressing wasn't anything to write home about: the dish was tasteless and uninteresting, , while the cold-smoked beef tongue w/horseradish vinaigrette and creme fraiche was excellent. The pickled beet included with the tongue was flavorful - what happened with the roasted beets on the salad? On to the board offering: Roasted lamb ribs, black-eyed pea salad, buttered bread, and a shot of whiskey: If the whiskey was the most memorable part of your dish, it ain't happening! Two greasy, fat-laden lamb ribs redolent of fat and grease with tasteless meat, served with black eyed peas screaming for a hamhock do not a dish make. Dessert was good, but not great - the grilled peach shortcake, raspberries and black pepper ice cream was ok, but I tasted no hint of black pepper in the ice cream.

The owner used to be the head chef of Taste of Sichuan, this is also the reason why the menu is extremely similar to Taste of Sichuan's. This restaurant has an 80s/90s feel, but it's very big and open. After reading the menu, we decided to try their all-you-can-eat hot pot. \\n\\nWe ordered the Cheng Du Dan Dan Noodle as an appetizer, I was surprised that it wasn't authentic. Authentic Dan Dan noodles are spicy, a little sour, usually contain preserved vegetable, a good amount of minced pork, and usually use thin noodles. The Dan Dan Noodle we ordered was not soupy nor spicy and it used too much peanut sauce; the noodles were thick and wasn't smooth.\\n\\nThe hot pot was good, the server checked on us frequently and kept the food coming. I think the hot pot was better than Hot Pot City's, even though you don't have as many ingredients to choose from, it feels better to have hot pot in a bigger restaurant.\\n\\nI was very pleased with the service considering authentic Chinese restaurants don't usually have good service.

I first heard about Clemetine via a Living Social coupon offer that proclaimed \\"Southern Comfort Food.\\" A siren's song for us both. Irresistible is the call, knowing that eventually the battered remnants of our reasonable health will be shattered and scattered amid the Scylla & Charybdis of Southern goodness. And we go willingly. \\n\\nI did a quick search, scanned the menu and was underwhelmed at the options. \\"Southern Comfort Food\\" was a tad under represented on the menu. Under the heading of \\"Southern Favorites\\" we find but two items: fried tilapia strips (makes sense) and chicken strips. ???? Yes, long I savored the tales Grampa would tell of his travels in the magical South where only there could you find the culinary wonder that is a breaded & fried bit of boneless chicken. Red flag noted...but disregarded. The fried chicken for only $8.50 was all my wife needed to see. She's pretty much powerless when fried chicken is involved. I really need to remember that if I ever really do something really stupid. \\n\\nHowever, I was encouraged by the lead-in statement on the menu:\\n\\n\\"At Clementine we do not believe in prefabricated, overly processed food.Because of this belief it might take a couple of extra minutes to get your meal, but it will be well worth it.\\"\\n\\nWe did the drive by to take a gander and see if we would stay plan or head back to the once sampled and since revered Tapalaya. The tv's weren't what we were looking for but figured the rest of the setting was fine and we dove in.\\n\\nI would offer the advice that they at least get a sign indicating we should seat ourselves or wait, as there was nothing, and no one readily identifiable as being employed there. So we wandered about the rooms taking it in until we were noticed and directed to sit where ever we liked. It was a bit busy, one big party in the other room and most of the tables in the main dining room were occupied. 2-tops mostly, not swamped.\\n\\nInitial set up and drink order was all fine and good. Ordered up the fried chicken, steak & shrimp special and a starter of hushpuppies. The salads & pups came out quickly enough. Salads were fine, crisp mixed greens with tomato & cukes. The huspuppies were very enjoyable. Sweeter than most I have had but that was complimented quite nicely by the spicy dipping sauce which seemed to be a jalapeno chutney of sorts. Never did find anything indicating the true nature of it on their menu. \\n\\nI was pleased to see that the food did not seem to take the \\"couple of extra minutes\\", as warned at the menu head. Methinks it should have. Now, I'm not a food snot. My palate is not refined. In fact, I refer to my palate as \\"taste buds.\\" The first thing that jumped out about both plates were the green beans. So very Sysco. Completely drained of vitality on all fronts: color, flavor, texture. Straight out of the hot lunch program at school. Again, I'm not a food bitch, but this was just embarrassing. The steak was fair enough, but was a bit sinewy & chewy and flavored mostly of charcoal. The shrimp were ok, with butter being the dominant carrier there. I do like butter, don't get me wrong.\\n\\nThe fried chicken got thumbs up from my wife. Not that she's not picky about her fricky chicky, oh yes, she is, but this was good. The mashed potatoes & gravy were another story. The mashed seemed like they had been watered down, literally. They were runny and watery in the mouth. No good starchy toothsomeness. The gravy seemed to be straight outta the packet. Lawry's or some other time-saver with all the flavor you'd come to expect from such an esteemed purveyor of fine gravy powders.\\n\\nAfter we were served our entrees, we were completely left alone. Usually appreciated, but a swing by asking how everything was would have been nice (perhaps they already knew?). Maybe a clearing of the salad & app plates from the tiny table would have been good? An opportunity to order another drink would have been welcomed. We were going out for a capper after, but still, the option would have been nice. Having to get up to go to the bar to track down the check was a perfect finish.\\n\\nMind you, we weren't sitting there all grumpy & pissy so I don't think we scared or vibed anybody off. I just didn't get the sense that the people there really gave much of a shit. From the cook on down.\\n\\nPerhaps their burgers & sandwiches are the best way to go, but really, I don't care to bother another try. I doubt we'll be missed.  \\n\\nI'll just end this rambling bit by noting that I'm not trying to be bitchy here, a bit of fun creative writing, but the food was really disappointing, as was the service. It's obvious someone put a lot of effort into the atmosphere, decor and logo even. It just didn't seem to go any further.\\n\\nOh, ok, I will be a bitch about this on this on the blackboard: \\"Try are red velvet cake\\" is not grammatically correct."},{"name":"The Locus","address":"4121 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"A friend and I stopped in for a drink and a wild boar poutine last night on our way to a show.

Yes, maybe I can't ask for too much with something that costed $7. But $7 shouldn't be the reason why Mentei is not trying.

The interior is small but cozy, with elaborate Asian wall decorations. We usually come here during lunch hours and find ourselves with plenty of choice as to where to sit. However, it's no doubt if you come by during dinner on a weekend, a little waiting time should be accounted for. Overall, the price is a little steep for the portion.\\n\\nStir fried Xiang Chang : Xiang chang is basically Taiwanese sweet sausage. We'd say both in looks and taste, it's the perfect hybrid between overly-sweet-Chinese sausage and the not-sweet-at-all-German sausage. This Taiwanese sausage is thinly sliced and stir-fried with abundant of healthy leeks & lotus roots. \\n\\nChili Oil Wonton : The wonton wraps up fatty and juicy shrimp, which is so satisfying for every bite.It looks like Ah-Ma really goes all the way authentic with their chili oil - thus with every bite, we feel like we're back in Sichuan all over again. \\n\\nLu Rou Fan: is a must. Simple, soulful and tasty with lots of hidden flavors - this is the epitome of what Taiwanese food should be. Fluffy white rice, gravy of minced pork and black mushroom, fresh & crunchy daikon radish. The soy-braised egg is like a real treat. \\n\\nCrispy Pig Ears: is too salty with big chunks of salt on the surface of the pieces. The crunchiness of the pig ear itself is lost somehow due to the long process of cooking. \\n\\nThree Cup Chicken Wings: the fresh basil-infused sauce is just so delicious, bringing this dish to the top of our favorite chart from Ah-Ma. It also has just the right amount of spiciness. The chicken is apparently fried twice, thus might appear a little too dry to some people.\\n\\nSalt & Pepper Chicken : comes in cute little crispy bite-size, great for sharing and starting your meal off. The chicken seems very fresh, with the juiciness still remains after being deep-fried. However, we are a bit disappointed about the flavoring of this dish. Its taste is extremely bland. \\n\\nBeef Noodle Soup: is the national dish of Taiwan. The noodle is the starchy, plump type served in very savory broth with generous amount of tender beef chunks.\\n\\nBeef Tendon Soup : We actually love this soup more than their best seller- the mainstream \\"Beef Noodle Soup\\". With each sip of the soup and each bite on that melt-in-your-mouth tendon, you'd fall in love more and more.\\n\\nHandmade Bao : so expensive and oh so-worth-it.

I tried the bulgogi, the soondoobu soft tofu soup, and the seafood pancake. \\n\\nHonestly, I had issues with all three dishes. The seafood pancake was more of a sparse squid pancake. No other seafood like shrimp or clams to be seen. It was also not crispy at all. That said, the flavor was actually not bad. It tasted better at room temperature than hot. The bulgogi also had good flavor, but the texture of the meat was more brittle than I am used to. Maybe the very thinly cooked meat was overcooked. The first soondoobu we got was inedible. I like a smokey stew but this one tasted as if you were eating pure charcoal. Something clearly went wrong and something was clearly  burnt at some point in the cooking.

Even though they were dense we found they we not heavy and did not spoil our minimal appetites for the main. We also ordered tandoori chicken which was flavorful and moist (I only wish it had a little more char on it). I liked that they did not chop it into tiny pieces like some other places do, there were whole thighs and legs. Delighted they had Onion Kulcha and the sweetness of the scallions stood out, just perfectly warm and cozy. Finally for desert we had the rice pudding, which was a lively finish to our meal - not too sweet.

We made our reservations back in December and have been waiting months just to come here. It was definitely worth the trip! \\n\\nAs many have said, this place is worth it just for the ambiance. When we arrived, they were running behind on seating their reservations. We waited about 10 minutes or so after checking in, and took that time to stand on the drawbridge and take photos of the castle and waterfalls around us. Once our buzzer went off, they took us through the big castle doors and led us through the ballroom, which is a replica of the one where Beauty and Beast dance in the film. So amazing to see it come to life! It even snows outside the window, which is really neat! \\n\\nOur table was in the West Wing, which was dark and a sort of depressing place. I loved being there, though, because it was smaller than the ballroom by far, and quieter. Plus, we were within feet of the enchanted rose! The West Wing looks as though it has been torn apart by the beast. Torn cloth and portraits decorate the walls and hang from the ceiling, and occasionally you hear thunder and see lightening. During our meal, the Beast himself came in to visit! You can, of course, roam around and take photos and video for yourself, which I did after we ate. \\n\\nNow for the food. We started off with french onion soups, which came with plenty of melted cheese on top and were quite good! They also brought us a basket of mini baguettes and butter. For entrees, I had the pork chop and my fiance had the shrimp and scallops in puff pastry. We both enjoyed our meals. My pork chop was juicy and flavorful, although the macaroni au gratin that it was paired with was not great. I barely touched it at all. We both had \\"the grey stuff\\" for dessert. I had to do it, just because of the film! It really was delicious, and such an interesting dish! Cookies and cream moose on top of a brownie-like cake that was very crisp on the outside, but chewy on the inside. A great combination of textures and flavors! \\n\\nBy the end of the meal, we were both full and needed a walk around the park. My only criticisms of this place are that our entrees arrived before we were finished with our soups, and I felt a little rushed. We did make them hold my fiance's plate until he was finished, though. Also, it is definitely pretty expensive. We didn't order alcohol at all, and with tip it came to a little under $100 for the two of us. But then again, it's Disney, and nothing there is free. \\n\\nTL/DR: This is one of those restaurants you need to try at least once just for the experience, but it's not a place you'll feel the need to keep returning to."},{"name":"Pepper Box Cafe","address":"932 SE Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My husband is from New Mexico.

I was so hungry I ate around the pink stuff, and I didn't want to complian to the very nice owner.  Besides,  I was on a rare night out with my husband. Today I ordered 2 dishes of the grilled short ribs, one dish for me and one dish for my kids to share.     I'm convinced their grill is half working or Vietnamese people eat meat that still has a pulse. Since I had kids to feed I asked them to please cook it so it's not raw.   It came back just about the same: blue inside.   Did they microwave for about 5 Seconds? Secondly,  one of the 2 short ribs you get was 1/2 a slab of fat.   So not only is it raw,  but it's a giggling, pulsing piece of unedible crap they serve to my table. And third,  my husband had ordered the \\"street food\\" dish which was once a very generous portion of various goodies that you wrap in rice paper.   Though it's still the same price,  this time you get 1/2 the prawns, chicken,  and sausage.   This time I made sure the waitress knew my thoughts about the meals.  We left pissed off and hungry.

About 20-50% more expensive than other fast burger places.\\n\\nI tried this place (place, place, place... is the word out of my system yet?) long ago, but hated it, and this is a revision of my former opinion.\\n\\nOrder: \\"Classic\\" = 1/2 lb burger, \\"yeller\\" = w/ mustard; +cheese +lettuce +onion +tomato +pickle; side: onion rings\\n\\nExperience: Friendly order-taker, friendly food deliverer.\\n\\nBurger: Pretty tasty, reasonable amount of mustard, held together all right, but with shredded lettuce and diced onions, TFOB (things falling off burger) is inevitable. For processed cheese, it was pretty good.\\n\\nOnion rings: Low on the grease, nice home-style breading. Cooked nicely.\\n\\nPrice: (Order was $9ish) Slightly more expensive than one might expect, even considering the burger was 1/2 lb. I don't consider price to be detrimental in this case, due to the quality.

Whole-leaf lettuce, sliced (not diced) onions, better cheese."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"3640 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"One of the very best breakfast places I've ever had the pleasure of going to.  The biscuits are hand-made daily and the fried chicken is breaded and cooked there, not prepackaged and frozen.  \\n\\nGenerally, any restaurant I go to, if something has gravy on it, I pass.  I had heard that Pine State made their own gravy and that it was amazing, so I went ahead and gave it a shot.  Man, am I glad that I did.  It was spicy and thick and complimented the chicken, bacon, egg, cheese and biscuit perfectly.  \\n\\nThe biggest negative of the place was the lack of seating.  It's a common occurrence, apparently, and they even have signs on the table asking you to be quick about leaving when you're done.  When my wife and I arrived, there were only two counter seats available, and they were not side by side.  We hoped that our food would be done about the time that someone else got done eating, but no joy.  Instead, while we debated getting to-go containers, I just went ahead and started eating while standing up.  It was awkward, but then a couple sitting at a four seat table offered to share with us.  We took them up on it, had a nice little conversation, and when they left, we invited another couple to sit down where they had vacated.\\n\\nOverall, it actually added to my experience, as I am normally a very insular person.\\n\\nThe portions are large, so even though it can seem spendy to pay $8 for essentially a chicken biscuit sand which, they truly are massive.  In fact, I was only able to eat a little over half of mine and I was full, although I don't eat too much.  But it was one of the few times that I wish I could eat a lot more, because I was craving the other half of that food a few hours later.\\n\\nIf you are in the area, this is a wonderful place to go to.  But if you hope to bring the whole family down for a leisurely morning breakfast of 12, think again.  Try Shari's, and then sneak down to Pine State on your own to get a real breakfast."},{"name":"Pic a Pasta","address":"600 Washington St","city":"Brighton","stars":"3.5","text":"I'm a big fan of Pic a Pasta.

My fiance' ordered  the \\"fatty' wth cheese, lettuce, and pickles and I had the \\"flatty\\" with lettuce and cheese.  We also ordered fried pickles and were asked whether we wanted them before our burgers, to which we said yes. We wait for our fried pickles, but instead got our burgeres.  Both were VERY dry and 1/2 of his was burnt.  They also both just came out with cheese, none of the lettuce or pickles that had been requested. We also didn't receive our fried pickles and had to go up the counter and ask for them, they arrived when we were almost done eating.   It was a bad burger and a bad experience.  The fries were so greasy and under cooked that they were eerily transparant.  And why go to the trouble of asking me what I want on my burger, circling what I say yes to and crossing out what I don't, when you're just going to hand me a plain burger with cheese?

Reminiscent of the single item and its variations food shops across Europe (most famously France) which may sell just cheese, certain meats, seafood, dressings, etc this is what I felt upon entering. From 11-2 you can eat their sandwiches or the daily special which I had. From 5 to 10 pm they offer various cheese and meat plates. During the entire time the place is open you can buy cheeses and wines to take home as if you went to the super market. The staff are very friendly and courteous asking how my day has been and how I liked the food which is coming up right, now!:\\n\\nMy meal was somewhat of a sandwich but a plate of Cochon Cold Smoked Duck Pastrami with a side of fancy mustard, marble rye, and a nice salad. The Duck Pastrami was great full of flavor and a nice hint of sour and sweetness matched with the mustard. The salad was fancy greens tossed in some nice oils that was not overwhelming but nice. It was not a lot of food but a good amount for the price. This is a weekly special so a better understanding of this place can come when I try one of their regular sandwiches.\\n\\nAs for the evening cheese and meat plates I read complaints about the amount of food you get for the price. Basically a more upper artisan restaurant does that and if your waiting to eat at Barley Swine and order some food here and complain about the portions and price then why are you even going to Barley Swine. I can't be the judge of those reviews but it's basically caveat emptor.\\n\\nI live far from here but I will be back to try the regular menu lunch items if everything is in the right place for me. I will most likely try the meat and cheese plates when I finally try out Barley Swine as I wait in line. If that happens and there is a change of heart with my original review i will let you know."},{"name":"Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant","address":"401 N Front St, Ste 120","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"Lets start by saying we went with a group of friends and had a fantastic time catching up.

Like there were 10 slices in the cucumber dish.  I was a little surprised to see a salad bar with such sparse bowls.  But I suppose most people do not go to Brazilian steak houses for the salad.\\n\\nAfter being seated our waitress asked everyone their temperature preference for their meat, and then you get a corresponding card (like a coaster)  listing your meat temp on the green side and flip it over to red if you want to pause the tidal meat wave! \\n\\nI tried just about every meat they passed by my way.   My favorite meats were the garlic steak and the bacon wrapped chicken.   The rest were just okay.  Service was fine, but not memorable.

Unbeknown-st to me, the V.P. was standing nearby and heard me. He immediately started serving me bread. It was followed by the waitstaff that began a night of providing superior customer service. I ordered my food which was a great super Sunday meal deal for $19.99 where you get 2 salad, 2 entrees, unlimited sides and two desserts. You can't beat that deal with a stick. First, the V.P. came and asked if it was okay to change the channel to the Bear game (nice gesture). Later, the V.P. came over to check on me and told me that was aware of the original oversight and apologized. I told him, it was okay that things happen. We chit chatted for a few minutes and talked about the Bears game. I wasn't pleased with some chicken I ordered. I informed the waiter and a few minutes later, a manager came to the table and told me that they were making a fresh order and it would be up in a min. A few minutes later, the manager himself brought out the replacement order. As I was finishing my meal, I was looking for the waiter to bring the bill when the V.P. walked up again and told me that my meal was on him. This is what I call superior customer service. I certainly willing to pay for the meal because they not only corrected the initial problem but turned the experience all the around but paying for the meal topped it off. Major kudos!

We decided to book the 7:15 show to kickoff the first night of our trip. We made reservations several months in advance and were still only able to get Category 3 seating. We arrived later than we wanted due to some delays at the ferry launch from the Magic Kingdom. Because we were late along with all the other people stuck on the ferry, none of us got to take the souvenir photo. Oh well, the show must go on. We were taken to the upstairs balcony for the category 3 seating and were shocked to find that not only did we have to share a long table with other families, but we had to sit on swiveling stools all on the same side of the table facing away from the stage, giving us a nice view of the wall. They told us just to swivel around to see the show when we weren't eating, REALLY?!?! It's not like category 3 is all that much cheaper than the other seats, we felt ripped off a little at that point. Then the waiter swung by to get our drink order and returned promptly with drinks, salad, and cornbread. The cornbread was heavenly and the waiter reminded us that the sangria, wine, and Bud Light were bottomless. The sangria was good, kind of strong and always refilled without me even noticing. Then the first part of the show started. It was very fun and upbeat. We are a young adult couple and we still enjoyed the humor and catchy songs. After about 20 minutes the main food started coming out and the show took an intermission. We received overflowing buckets of ribs, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, cowboy beans, and a vegetable medley. Everything was absolutely delicious. My favorite was the beans, they had big pieces of meat in them and weren't too sweet, so good! After eating for awhile the show picked back up again, and with our seats if you weren't done eating you were missing the show going on behind you, so I guess we were done eating. We ended up not needing refills of anything but the cornbread, but the family next to us got more buckets of everything. The rest of the show was fun, and they really interact with the audience a lot, in all the seating categories. During the show they brought out the strawberry shortcake. It was huge and good, but not my favorite. Then the did a big finale and it was over. Everyone flooded outside where we were informed that we couldn't take the ferry back, we had to take a bus. We weren't sure which bus to take to get back to our Disney resort, so we asked someone and they told us the zone 3 bus, huh? Ok. People piled on to the bus and we sat there for about 30 minutes, then the bus proceeded to stop at EVERY RESORT for each person on the bus, starting with the nicest resorts first. Are you kidding me?!?! In the end, it took us over 2 hours to get home from the time the show ended. So although the show was really entertaining and the food was great, Disney transportation really ruined the experience for us from beginning to end. So my advice to have a great time at this show, drive yourself to Fort Wilderness if you can and DO NOT sit in category 3!"},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Since the closing of my beloved Tava and Grill, I've been searching for a new place to get a solid Chicken Tikka Masala.

The rice was good, but I didn't go there for the rice. Boo and fail. I won't be back.\\n\\nOther than the food, the customer service was fine. I picked it up and it was ready when I got there. The weird thing is that they were doing all this construction right in front of the restaurant, so you have to walk right through it and through the entrance to their banquet hall and then down a hallway in order to enter and leave the restaurant. Kind of a pain, but hopefully they will have that figured out once the construction is done."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This was by far the best place to eat I'm the Magic Kingdom.

I love that some of the cupcakes incorporate savory flavor into them (strawberry-balsamic last month, or earl grey, etc.)  There are some traditional ones, but typically there is a creative twist on the flavor combos, and often the cupcake has a filling, which is an extra bonus!

It was a tough lunch meal to get - they take reservations 180 days in advance but we grabbed a cancellation 60 days out. We also pre-ordered our food - my wife chose the Croque Monsieur, I went with the French Dip sandwich and both kiddos wanted the saut√©ed shrimp from the kids menu. \\n\\nGetting in was complicated with a lot of steps. First we checked in outside, then we headed to the desk at the building entrance to queue for seating and to confirm our pre-orders, then we chose a table in the central ballroom (one of 3 themed rooms) and then after that we ordered our drinks and waited for our orders. And we waited. Waited. Waited some more. Still waiting. \\n\\nAnd then the food arrived. But it was kind of blah. The Croque was a flat, boring grilled ham and cheese, and my French Dip was equally fine but generic.  My kids liked their shrimp kids plates but each of them only got five little itty bitty shrimp - that was a really small portion size. Their broccoli was fine too, but it is tough to rave about steamed broccoli. \\n\\nThe theming should've been a home run but it was also totally uninspired. The extent of the theming was that the ballroom looked like the one in the movie.  My wife told me also that the snow we could see falling through the fake windows was the actual animation sequence from the snow in the movie - interesting, but sorta ridiculous too - I didn't really care - animated snow is a nice detail but hardly worthy of accolades. \\n\\nWe didn't see any characters, it was loud, the food was mediocre - we wanted to love Be Our Guest but I'm afraid this meal fell really flat.

The service is both formal and relaxed in the sense that waitstaff is attentive, but also happy to shoot the sh*t with clientele. The setting is classy and perfect for a special occasion...clean lines and nice design but not showy, and the restaurant itself is located in one of the prettier areas of Salem, as the name implies down by the wharf area. Their only fault? I wish that this restaurant, unique amongst its competitors in Salem, was about a quarter of the price cheaper. I always feel that the price of entrees is a little too expensive. Nevertheless, in my humble opinion, similarly priced restaurants in Salem (Lyceum, Nathaniel's) take the silver and bronze for their cuisine when compared to Sixty2 on Wharf.\\nSo what to order? The antipasti offerings are by far the most interesting and delicious on the menu. Small bites to share and try at approximately $5 each, you will not be disappointed by the arancini, stuffed with mozzarella and accompanied by tomatoes and basil, or any of the house marinated items. The bacala is also worth trying - delicious fritters of salt cod and potatoes topped with a bit of tangy lemon aoli. When moving onto the entrees, the servers will often suggest ordering a pasta dish (prices listed are appetizer portions, and for an entree portion you double the number) and then also an entree. Take this opportunity to order an entree-sized portion of any of the pastas, all house made, and all delicious, and have your dining companion(s) order a regular entree - I especially enjoy the thyme roasted duck breast with vinaigrette sauce and roasted cauliflower - and share and share alike. By the way, having saved a little by skipping the pasta course, but still being able to dive into and share a nice big bowl of their richly sauced pastas, you'll have no guilt over ordering dessert, and if they have them on the menu, I recommend the warm toffee pudding or the house made donuts. \\nOverall a very nice restaurant, with very refined clientele, and a great place to spend an evening."},{"name":"OPA! of Greece Metrotown","address":"4820 Kigsway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"My brother made me try OPA!

Spicy, blood red, slightly crispy and not too greasy. This will be one of my last meals if i'm ever put in front of a firing squad. I do apologize, but I get weak in the knees when I see a plate of frad-chikn in front of me. The other dishes were good for the money, but not as noteworthy. The aloo saag was a bit on the soupy side. I prefer my aloo saag extra thick and creamy (that's not what she said). The malai kofta was a bit on the sweet side. I've always had my malai kofta more savory than sweet, so maybe it's just a different style. All the dishes were between $5 and $7, so it's def a good spot if you're a baller on a budget (when I make it rain you can here the coins hit the floor). I'll def be coming here again."},{"name":"Ah-Ma's Taiwanese Kitchen","address":"931 Monroe Dr, Ste A-108","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I am a big fan of noodle soups, even in the blazing hot Georgia summer months.

The WiFi in the rooms was fast and good, and the bed was comfortable. Overall, for a hotel at this star level, it was exactly as advertised.

Let's turn around and get it.\\" He turned the bus around, drove back to the hotel, and even told me to just leave my stuff on the bus and he'd wait while I ran in. The front desk lady quickly generated a card to get me back into the room (she'd just checked me out of my room 15 minutes before so she knew who I was), and I was back on the bus in less than 3 minutes. I so appreciate that the shuttle bus guy turned around; I didn't tell him this, but if he hadn't turned around, there's no way I would have made it back to the hotel and still caught my flight.

Their fish tacos were made with cod. My husband ordered something called the Molecajete - bowl of steak, chicken, chorizo grilled w/ veggies served w/ rice & beans.

But after 20 minutes you get pretty impatient! After that the food almost always takes FOREVER to arrive. It doesn't make any sense why things are taking so long because there are always servers that seem to be waiting around the bar, not in any hurry, and it's usually not busy. I JUST DON'T GET IT! \\nI could honestly go on and on describing long waits, lack of service, and flat beers but I won't. I can't figure out how this place could be so bad, but it is. Don't go here.

To put it mildly, I had high hopes.\\n\\nI won't lead you on any longer. It's wasn't that great.\\n\\nWe arrived for our 8:30 reservation and had to wait only a few minutes for our table to be ready. It was a relatively busy Saturday evening so a small wait was entirely fine. The ambiance is comfortable and elegant but not over the top.\\n\\nI will say this: The service is good. Not impeccable. But good. Our server was prompt, attentive and patient with our group. She was able to answer our myriad of questions and make menu suggestions.\\n\\nThe food....well, it just wasn't that great. \\n\\nWe started with two orders of spiced nuts (sort of like a bar snack) and two salumi plates. Since there was not actually any cooking going on--they were both good quality and a great start.\\n\\nWe each ordered the tasting menu so between all of us--we sampled the entire menu. I'm only reviewing what I had.\\n\\nANTIPASTI: I had the beet salad. And I will say that this might have been the most exciting dish of the evening, visually speaking. I'm not a huge fan of beets but they were prepared well with a citrus dressing and the dish was really pretty.\\n\\nPRIMI: The table decided to do the \\"Risotto for the Table\\", which was a disappointment. Besides not being visually appealing, mine was still a little crunchy. The flavor was there, but crunchy risotto? That's a faux pas in my book anywhere but the Olive Garden. \\n\\nSECONDI: They brought me the wrong dish. I'm sure the pork was delicious but it's not what I ordered. They brought the beef out relatively quickly but everyone waited for mine to be served, which meant theirs was getting cold. Since I may have been the only one eating a warm dish, I might be partial. The beef was good...cooked medium rare and seared well, but nothing I couldn't have been served at Ocean Prime or Capital Grille in Denver.  It was definitely my favorite course but that's not really saying much.\\n\\nDESSERT: One word: DISAPPOINTMENT  (seemed to be a theme that evening). I had the Ribaltamento, which I think was a \\"fancy\\" version of an apple tart. Bland. Nothing special. Again, disappointing. \\n\\nWhat saved the evening? Good friends. Decent service.

I also had the flatbread, with came covered in carmelized onions, black olives, anchovies with creme fraiche.\\n\\nFor dinner, I had pasta, spicy with seafood, and a light drizzle of butter. \\n\\nBoth meals at Clyde were great.

Chatime being a recognized international brand also gives me a peace of mind in terms of the ingredients they use. \\n\\nI've tried many of their beverages and nothing beats the grass jelly roasted milk tea. It has a unique flavour and aroma that i prefer over regular milk tea. 30% sweetness and no ice is perfect for me. It comes cold anyway and I find that ice just waters down the taste when it melts.

But chances are you won't mind.\\n\\nThe curious thing about this place is that instead of an itemized order sheet, you're given a blank strip of paper.  So you have to write down the item code as well the quantity.  Guess the forms that everyone else uses cost too much to print.\\n\\nThe other curious thing here is that there are no dessert item menus, other the \\"milk\\"  item, which is actually a sweet spring roll (right down to the crispy skin).\\n\\nThey do have a bar here, but it's not quite \\"fully stocked\\"  They have your gins, whiskeys, and other things such as Malibu, but let's just say there are some rather large spaces between the bottles.\\n\\nAs for the rest of the food, it is pretty good.  The salmon are farmed, but the variety is awesome.  You can get items such as beef tataki, eel, and toro, to name a few.

We showed up late (for Boulder) Monday night, which is pre-fixe night.  I had just finished reading Heat so I was thinking, \\"the kitchen is gonna hate us for showing up at this hour\\".   However, the food and the service were spectacular, the owner checked on us, and the waiter's wine suggestion was right on the mark.

I also had a seafood dish that was big enough for about 3 people!  It was very good, but too big.  My fault-I should have asked first.  My boyfriend had a buffalo dish and didn't like it, but ate the rest of my dinner instead.  Our friend had a veal dish that the owner created for her.

When we were here, they had a party of 40, so you can imagine how loud it was.  Their menu is huge, so be prepared to take about 10 minutes to peruse it.

Having never been to Crema Caf√© before, we decided to give it a shot for our wedding cake. \\nWe met with Marley and Meghan one afternoon just 6 days before our actual ceremony. They brought out a platter of cake slices and presented us with many options as each featured different mixes of frosting and cake interior. Crema Caf√© was very crowded that day, but my fianc√© and I were able to sit together and stuff our faces with cake! Ultimately, we decided on three cakes (1 10\\" and 2 12\\", I believe) for our wedding: one red velvet with cream cheese frosting, one chocolate with mint butter cream frosting and one vanilla with vanilla butter cream frosting. Meghan, the baker, suggested putting snowflakes on each as a decoration. We loved the idea and couldn't wait for the following weekend! \\nThe cakes were delivered the day of our ceremony to Park, a restaurant on the other side of Harvard Square where the reception was being held. All three cakes were displayed on a table, just waiting to be cut and eaten. Needless to say, they were a big hit among all adults and the few kids present. \\nBig thanks to Meghan and Marley at Crema Caf√© for accommodating us in such a quick manner.

One, there's NEVER a line when I go in Morelli's (which I guess could be good or bad, but honestly, I don't think a lack of clientele is the problem). While customization is cool, there's not a lot of need for that with the awesome flavors that Morelli's has contrived. \\n\\nWhich leads me to two; while I can't say I'm a fan of every flavor, the ones that I do like, I love. And the others, other people love. It's not Morelli's fault that I don't like salty ice cream. But back to the point, their strawberry ice cream, for instance: it isn't just vanilla flavor with food coloring and some strawberries thrown in. The ice cream is actually made from strawberries and with strawberries. It's rich, and fresh, and full of flavor. \\n\\nEverything they make tastes exactly like what you'd expect the item it's based on to taste like. They never disappoint. Totally worth the visit.

We were greeted right away. It was my wife and I and our 3 year old. The man that greeted us asked my daughter if she wanted a toy. He took the time to kneel down and show her all her options. It was an amazing first impression. We got seated and ordered drinks. We looked over the menu and decided to get chicken bbq nachos and a portobello sandwich and split them. They then brought us a small plate of chips with an interesting sweet veggie oil dip thing. The chips were  very stall. We immediately regretted our nacho order so I went and found the server and told her about the chips. She said she would fix it. 2 min later the man that seated is brought us a big bowl of chips to try and they tasted great. Again amazing service. It went straight down hill from there. My wife ordered a glass of wine and asked for a glass of water as well. She had to ask 2 more times before it finally showed up. The nachos were nasty. The beans were a dried up thick glob all over the pile of chips. The chicken was dried out. The bbq sauce was spicy. Very disappointed in them. The portobello sandwich was very small. It wasn't bad buy wasn't anything fantastic. The fries were simple generic fries. Once we asked for our check it took awhile to get. Once we got it it took what seemed to be a manager or an owner multiple times of asking his server to process my credit card. When we got there the place was empty. At 8 o'clock a rush came that they didn't seem prepared for. The 2 serves and 2 managers were all over the place. At one point a cook was seating people. And at a high top by the bar a lady was smoking an e cigarette. Are those legal I side a resturant? I don't care what people say about them. I don't want them smoked around me and my family.

There are several seating areas througout the the space.  In the colder months prime seating is next to the fireplace in the sunken seating area.  I have a favorite seat right next to the fireplace that actually gets too hot after a while, but in a lovely way.  In the summer they roll up the huge windows facing burnside and let in all the lovely fresh air. \\n\\nThe patio is probably the biggest and best in all of Portland.  The covered section is an architectural masterpiece.  Underneath this amazing structure are picnic tables, a bar, and a ping-pong table.  Sometimes there is a fire pit going as well.  There are some heat lamps out here but I find that they are a little too high and the heat doesn't quite reach me.  The other half of the patio is open with a screen of bamboo dividing the space.  The patio is packed in summer months.\\n\\nI have grown to love the staff here.  The yelpers that have complained about them probably have not given them a fair chance.  The bartenders and wait staff are the beautiful people of Portland.  They may not be all warm and fuzzy with customers but they are certainly friendly, quick, and pour really strong drinks.  I've found that they are all great at recommendations when I am not sure what I want.  I've gotten to know several of the bartenders here and they always remember my drink of choice.\\n\\nThe food is excellent!  The \\"Fall Burger\\" is by far my favorite burger in all of Portland.  It is a burger topped with watercress, bleu cheese and house-made bacon jam and it is amazing!!!  It is seasonal however so eat as many of these as you can during the fall and winter months.  The grilled cheese and tomato soup is always a yummy choice on a cold evening.  The menu changes frequently and I've been missing two of my favorite dishes:  the manchego stuffed mushrooms, and the creamy mushroom dip.

Especially if you are considering Rosetti's.\\n\\nRosetti's is fairly new to the Lynn scene.  But wow what a high bar they've set for everyone in town to follow!  Right now it has the buzz going and is in my opinion one of the best places I can find in all of Boston.  I remember high end restaurants venturing into the distant edgier districts of San Francisco in the early 2000's and this place seems to have a little bit of that vibe going.\\n\\nThe space and The bar:\\nThe space is airy and open and has large windows with views out.  You walk in and immediately catch yourself thinking, \\"Is this really in downtown Lynn??\\"!!  A gas fire feature in combination with very good quality diningware and lighting, when set right, really set the stage for an elegant experience! And that's before you even get to the bar and have a \\"not a manhattan\\" drink in a roaring 20's martini glass.  They have lots of other drinks too but I'm still stuck on that one as my favorite!\\n\\nI tend to visit on nights when things are quieter, but those nights are becoming fewer and fewer as the place is exploding with popularity across the region.  I don't have a suggestion on how to avoid the noise that some people complain about - I don't have an issue with it and wouldn't let that deter you.\\n\\nThe Food:\\nThe menu features tend to rotate by season but when they first opened, they had an unbelievable appetizer - beef braised tortellini (or something like that) and that was my first impression of the place.  I don't think I've ever had similar better and I've been hooked ever since.  Recently our group (which happened to have a professional chef with us that day) tried a zucchini type dish (none of us are typically fans of eggplant) but Rosetti's shined that day and it was an exceptional appetizer that even astounded the chef in our group and we will be ordering that again.  Fish dishes are never less than perfect, simple chicken parmesan dishes are dressed up and leave you wanting more (in a good way!), the steak dishes are on par with The Blue Ox around the corner (and another favorite of mine) and somehow Rosetti's keeps things feeling light, tasty, and exquisitely presented.\\nI also feel that they are sensible about their meal size.  You're not gonna get a cheesecake factory style pile of food laden in butter and overly fattening ingredients falling off the plate when it arrives. I never leave feeling gross or like I am sick from eating too much.  I always leave with a positive feeling and am ready to go back!\\nThe Service:\\nI think that the sudden popularity of this place may have caught everyone by surprise.  The owner really takes feedback to heart and from what I've seen constantly takes steps to make the experience pleasant and better and better for everyone each time they visit.  You could probably find less expensive prices somewhere else but you get what you pay for and the overall experience in this place is well worth it for a special celebration, quick drink before a show, or a weekly dinner night!\\n\\nSo it is with a little bit of hesitation that I post this...I'd hate for the place to get too busy and the personal connection between the customer/staff be lessened as I've seen at other places - but this place really deserves it."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"3640 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I guess I need to revist this place.
