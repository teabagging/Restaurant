My mother actually asked me why it was so empty, concerned that it wouldn't be good.\\n\\nI can't say why it was empty, but my mother's consternation quickly dissipated with the arrival of the basket of baked goods ($5):  two cinnamon buns, two biscuits, and three mini-muffins, accompanied by a plum jam.

My mother, who has been making buttermilk biscuits herself for as long as I can remember, was so entranced that she asked if she could have the recipe.

Please be warned that you need to have a valid ID and be over the age of 21 to dine inside the restaurant. We only ordered takeout from here, so I cannot really comment on the interior. From the counter, we got two entrees, and while it may have been slightly pricey, it was a good value because the portions are large. We ordered the fried catfish basket, and the blackened mahi mahi with a salad. The fried catfish basket came with fries, and cole slaw. Fortunately, we were able to upgrade the fries to cilantro fries, but we couldn't taste the difference between normal fries and the cilantro fries. However, the fried catfish was amazing! It had just the right amount of crispiness and seasoning, and it was juicy inside. Also, the mahi mahi had an intense amount of cajun seasoning and was very appetizing. The salad that we ordered with the mahi mahi was a bit plain because there was no dressing included. I would recommend asking for some sort of dressing to go with the salad.

I had heard about it from friends and knew it was a 4 dollar-sign ($$$$) type of place. I left feeling kind of meh.\\n\\nIt started out, on a Wednesday night, with them trying to seat our group of 9 at two tables on either side of a steel beam. Why?  The place was less than half full (and I'm an optimist!) so we pushed another table closer to one they set up for us, so we could be closer together.\\n\\nThe plates are expensive. Like, \\"kinda expensive so I hope it's good\\" up to \\"pretty darn expensive so it must be awesome.\\" There are not many options for an inexpensive meal here, unless you get one side and a water. Then you can probably leave paying $15... maybe $10.\\n\\n...but the portions are small! Even the \\"Large\\" dishes seemed to be missing a little something on the plate. \\n\\nThe bread they bring to the table is lovely. Sourdough and regular type rolls with a dish of butter to spread liberally. I ate a lot of these.\\n\\nI had the lamb meatballs (considered a small plate). Three good sized meatballs with a light brown, thick sauce and a bit of \\"Georgia Field peas\\" (peas and another type of bean.) I also got a side of legumes which were a vegetable of the day. No one told me that the beans on the plate with the meatballs and the legumes would be pretty much exactly the same thing. Good thing they were pretty tasty. In fact, it's worth noting that this is the first time in my life that I've thought peas tasted good - I think due to the fact that they were not mushy at all. This is a huge feat. I did take the legumes home as leftovers though and the peas returned to their normal mushy, gross selves. (Peas are pretty much the only vegetable that I hate.) \\n\\nMoving on, the meatballs.. I love lamb in general. These meatballs were pretty good. They had a spice to them, which I wasn't thrilled with, but it wasn't bad - so if you like spicy (I'm a wuss) then you'll be fine. The taste was less lamb-y than I expected and more just meatbally. If that makes sense. The light brown, thick sauce that I mentioned - which I have no idea what it was made of - was very good and I enjoyed eating it on my legumes.\\n\\nI drank water... At the end, I ordered a cup of coffee, which was great, and after large-party gratuity included I spent $31. Not thrilled.\\n\\nOther dishes they had that night were quail, octopus, another small lamb dish, some other fancy stuff I can't even remember.\\n\\nA saving grace is that the service, though slow, is very friendly and helpful. We had e between the waitress, the guy pouing the water, the guy bringing the bread, the 3 other people bringing out our dishes.. and all with a smile. The atmosphere is fine - a little loud and dark.. I do like the decor though.. wood, steel, art, open floor plan which includes being able to see through the backside of the bar.\\n\\n4th & Swift did not blow any wind up my skirt, but I'm thinking this is more of the type of place for fancy meals to impress a date or business partner.. not a place to necessarily pig out for sure.

For a seafood lover, Maxwell's 148 is a dream come true. Tender lobster, fresh fish, always in delicious and well flavored reductions and purees. Try the Pho Max Soup for an appetizer; you won't be let down.\\n\\nIf you still have room after dinner, the coconut creme brulee with a shot of in-house made fig vodka is to die for.\\n\\nI can't recommend Maxwell's enough.

Their side of potatoes comes with grilled whole garlic cloves, which were delicious. The Athena omelette (with sun-dried tomatoes subbed for kalamata olives) was a tad small, but tasty, and the vegetarian sausage they use is good.

It's amazing that SA is only an hour or so down 35 but the Mexican food is so much better (IMHO).\\n\\nThe food is not quite the same from time to time which makes me think it is being made from scratch every day. This is most noticeable in the Salsa which varies from the best you ever had to just run of the mill. The sauce on the enchiladas is real cooked down beef gravy and is delicious sopped up on your tortillas. You'll have to order your tortillas on the side though as they don't come with the meal. The tortillas are really good and don't have that mass produced taste that most places in town suffer from.\\n\\nThe frozen margaritas are pretty good but we've had bad luck with the mixed ones. They offer aguas frescas and Mexican coke as well as the regular fountain stuff. \\n\\nThe music is a Mexican radio station blaring from a boom box in the corner. The decor/atmosphere is as tacky as they come which is why I couldn't rate it five stars. In fact maybe 3 1/2 stars is a better overall rating. The service is friendly and generally pretty good, but many of the waitstaff have a little trouble with English. Most times they don't give you a check. You just wander up to the cash register when you're ready to go. \\n\\nOne nice thing about the lack of atmosphere is you won't have to worry about a crowd.

I apologize in advance, because I feel a lengthy and somewhat whiny review coming along. \\n\\nFirst off, I must say that Natick seemed very suburbia to me to have this type of establishment in it, but that was from my initial reactions. Upon walking in, the ambiance easily blew me away. After sitting through dinner I realized that this restaurant tries very, very hard to actually be pretentious. Who goes for that? Don't get me wrong, the ambiance was beautiful, and romantic, but the food should match and the prices should be in range for what's in the area and according to my friend, they were not on point. They were in fact all over the board and some didn't make any sense. \\n\\nOkay, let's get down to food & drink. We were seated and given time to decide on what we'd like to drink. We had both decided that we were in the mood for some sort of fish and wanted a wine to compliment that so the waiter suggested a bottle of Casa Silva Sauvignon Gris 2006. It was \\nlight, crisp and very good. For an appetizer we had decided to share the arugula salad. It was nicely prepared, very fresh and went very well with the wine. The spiciness of the arugula with the shaved cheese and the delicate olive oil and lemon were just what I was looking for to start off dinner. However, must say that for $12, it was a rather small salad that we were told was enough for two to share. \\n\\nIt took me much longer than usual to decided what I wanted for my entree. I understand that they were going for an Asian Italian fusion restaurant but those favors rarely mesh and I didn't really see anything fused. I saw Asian inspired dishes and then some Italian dishes, all of which were over priced even for Boston, but hey, we were celebrating! So after a good 15 minutes and picking apart the menu and all of it's quirks I had decided upon Gnocchi al Tartofu and my friend had decided on the Chilean Sea Bass. Here is where the lull in the evening set in... it took a solid 30 minutes from app to entree. To me that was not acceptable. We ordered everything at the same time, and there was no explanation that any of the dishes would take longer, nor should anything that we ordered need extra preparation. In any case, our dinner had finally arrived and I must say that while I wasn't blown away with presentation, the food was good. The gnocchi was ricotta based and was not lead-like and was coated with a light wild mushroom sauce and shaved truffles. It was also tossed with Maine lobster meat, but there was not a lot. For the $45 price tag on this entree I was expecting more....more lobster, more pizazz. Good is good, but the price wasn't right. I did sample the Chilean sea bass which was spot on. The fish was excellent and was served with crab raviolis plated over a thin tomato sauce with more baby arugula. He didn't eat much of the arugula because we had it as an app and would have probably substituted it for something else had he realized it was the vegetable on the plate. Over all that dish had everything just right. Again, the wine did compliment both of our dishes. \\n\\nThe waiter cleared our table and let us talk and digest for a little before presenting us with the dessert menu which has an impressive listing of dessert wines, scotches, bourbons, cognacs, ports, grappas, etc. Even though we were stuffed, we are both die-hard chocoholics and decided to share the chocolate espresso terrine served with a belgian dark chocolate sauce. I decided that I was going to end the night with the Bonnie Doon Post Harvest Frozen Muscat and he was going to finish with one of the grappas.. the name escapes me. The terrine was served and was a very large portion. We were unable to get through half of it, but the half that we conquered was heavenly. The dark chocolate sauce was perfection in a drizzle, it was a nice balance of semi-sweet chocolate. \\n\\nWe lingered over our drinks and eventually called it a night. We were not rushed in any way by the service staff. The waitstaff was very friendly and efficient. \\n\\nAll in all, the food was great, but a little off as far as pricing goes. I did peruse the drink menu and was floored to see martini's in a category all their own because they were $69!!! Whether it's JW Blue, Don Julio Real Anejo or Kaufmann vodka, you're only using about 2-3 oz at the most and even that won't come close to that price. That's just absurd. Some of the \\"regular\\" martini's looked okay and the wine by the glass list was extensive. \\n\\nI have no problem paying for a great meal if you are getting what you pay for which is part of the problem here. They are putting high price tags on things as part of an image but don't deliver on the promise of the food."},{"name":"Eat at Jumbo's","address":"688 Broadway Ball Sq","city":"Somerville","stars":"3","text":"I used to live in Medford, where I would frequent Ronny's Place or Alfredo's for great, local pizza.

How can you get a better deal than that in Chinatown?\\n\\nThis place is tucked away in a random food space next to avana sushi and a cell phone stand. I was skeptical at first but I decided to get 10 pork dumplings one day for dinner. They were awesome! The filling tasted more like soup dumplings than your regular freezer dumplings. They give you 10 dumplings and two different kinds of dipping soy sauce (spicy and non). It was great, especially considering how cheap it was! \\n\\nI'd recommend the pork dumpling steamed. I tried them fried once and the flavor just wasn't as good after they fried it. You have to tell them though, because most people like them greasy and fried so sometimes they don't ask you what you want. \\n\\nI haven't tried the combo yet, but I saw people get a big cup of dumpling soup and a soda for only a $1 more.

This restaurant has been on our radar for awhile but finding the time etc to make it downtown for a meal can be difficult.  After making the decision to get a hotel room for the night it was a no brainer to try this place and it did not disappoint.\\n\\nWe arrived at the restaurant and were promptly seated.  Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable but did not intrude on the meal unnecessarily.  \\n\\nWe started out by ordering a bottle of Abbot's Table wine which out waiter was sure would go well with the entrees we were considering.\\n\\nFor appetizers we tried the Duck Confit and Morel Bruchetta.  The duck was perfectly salty but not overly so like some we have tried.  It also had fava beans and pearl onions.  Secondly we tried the Tybee Island Shrimp Ceviche. It came with avocado, red pepper sorbet, and homemade Old Bay Saltines.  A very simple dish in reality but so delicious and well put together.  The red pepper sorbet was interesting and completely different.  \\n\\nFor entrees I had the Duck Breast with soft polenta, spinach, and homemade pear butter - WOW.  My husband ordered the venison, mashed rutebegas, spinach, pickled rhubarb, and a pomegranate sauce.  I am not sure who ordered the better entree as both were delicious and unique.\\n\\nFinally for desserts we ordered the Chocolate Nest and Duck N Donuts.  The Chocolate Nest was decadent and rich with raspberry sorbet.  However, the show stopper of the evening was the Duck N Donuts dessert.  Foie Gras Ice Cream served with roasted strawberries and homemade donuts.  The ice cream sounded odd at first but it was so good and rich.  To me this dish was the sign of a very talented pastry chef who is willing to experiment and think outside of the box.\\n\\nWe will definitely be going back to 4th & Swift for another meal."},{"name":"Mooo Restaurant","address":"15 Beacon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place isnt worth the hype at all.

The restaurant has a several problems, but overall the (meat) experience is a great one deserving of a solid three-star (meat) rating, in my book.\\n\\nStarting with the decor, this place is sharp and modern while still feeling intimate and upscale. The dress code is informal (meaning dress up, but suits and ties are not required) which lends itself to the general air of celebration in the establishment. Folks dining here are all celebrating something, it seems.\\n\\nI would however caution people to request a table far away from the rear entrance; the fumes from the valet stand are quite strong and apt to ruin your meal. The restaurant really needs to employ a double-door or \\"air-door\\" system back there to prevent the noise and fumes from reaching the diners in the rear.\\n\\nService is a bit hit or miss, while still being in-your-face. Our server forgot numerous things, forcibly upsold us several $5 bottles of still water we didn't want, and generally was either in our way, or not around when we actually wanted something. Be sure to ask the gentlemen carrying the meat skewers for what you want, they'll call over the fellow who has the item you'd like.\\n\\nThe food was excellent. Speaking as a wolf who's dressed up in sheep's clothing just to snag a bleater or two, I thoroughly recommend the lamb. Everyone at our table got numerous helpings of the lamb chops, and I spent a good part of my evening hailing down the men carrying the legs of lamb through the dining room. The pork was entirely forgettable for all of us, sadly. The picanha and other spiced cuts of beef were superb. We had to specifically ask for the filet Mignon, and it ended up being just mediocre. \\n\\nAs to cleanliness, the diners make most of the mess here. One of the annoying things our server did was clean up table-mess with the meat on/off button. While I realize this place is no Michelin star dining experience, the least the management in such an upscale place could do is outfit their servers with crumb sweepers. \\n\\nAll in all, incredibly tasty food. The service and garage fumes are where Fogo lost stars."},{"name":"Brighton Beer Garden","address":"386 Market St","city":"Brighton","stars":"2.5","text":"BBG redid their menu at some AGAIN at some point this year and I don't think it was for the better.

I can get that a few steps over at the Costco too)....  with some Kuhne sauerkraut (always in my fridge...  if you've never tried that brand of 'kraut, it's imported from Germany and SOOOOOOooooo rocks!).   The coleslaw on the side was one of the standouts... not so mushy as you sometimes get...  and it didn't taste like I was eating solidified vinegar or pickle juice... it was a nice blend.  The pickle was good...   the poutine...   ummm... no.   The sauce was funky....   fiance thinks maybe some sort of tomato base in that sauce...  it was WAY too salty, and the cheese, like all poutine cheese in Vancouver was just not right.\\n\\nTwo ginger ales, two sandwiches with the 'upped' poutine ended up running around $40...   and I didn't feel $40 worth of enjoyment out of this...

I'm not sure what was going on acoustically at the restaurant but it was so loud that we had to shout to hear each other. \\n\\nThey have a nice selection of wines. They brought us bread and we ordered some oysters (they were pretty good) and tuna tartare (nothing special). The birthday boy ordered a Kobe Cap Steak and I ordered a bone-in ribeye medium rare. The steaks were excellent. We also had asparagus and the Grill 23 Tots. The tots tasted like they came from Costco. I would never order them again. Not sure why everyone's raving about them.\\n\\nFor dessert we shared profiteroles with coffee ice cream and chocolate sauce. \\n\\nI was not impressed by Grill 23. I mean we had a nice dinner, but when I spend $300+ on dinner for two, I expect top notch service. Our waiter never cleared the crumbs off the table. He didn't offer sparkling water, he just took our orders and brought our food. \\n\\nI'm not sure if service was so mediocre due to Restaurant Week, but I won't be rushing back for steaks here any time soon. \\n\\nI think Ruth's Chris has far more superior service, which makes special occasion dinner experiences memorable."},{"name":"Coach's Bar & Grill","address":"10162 SW Park Way","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place awesome pizza and the friendliest bar tenders around!    \\nThanks girls,  keep it up!"},{"name":"Mexico Lindo","address":"16 Market St","city":"Lynn","stars":"4","text":"One of my fave restaurants to eat at, and definitely #1 in terms of Mexican restaurants.

They don't take reservations, but they told us if we showed up at 7:30, we should get a table immediately.  Ha.  We showed up at 7:15 pm and instead, we put on a list and told to return at 8:30 and a table would be ready then.  We returned at 8:15 and waited... and waited... and waited.  They gave a table that would have fit the 4 of us away to a group of 2 and 3 even though they were later on the list than us.  Finally, at 9:10 pm, we were seated.  Thankfully, the serving staff was great, and made the rest of the meal great.  She had an good recommendation for a white, since they were completely out of the reds that we wanted.  \\n\\nThe bread they bring out is so delicious, soft, tasty - I had to try and refrain from eating too much.  For an appetizer, we got the asparagus frites (yum!) and the pear salad (also good).  For our meal, we got pizzas and one person got the mushroom risotto.  We got 1/2 of the signature pizza, the fig and prosciutto, and 1/2 of the spicy chicken sausage.  The others got the four cheese and pepperoni (called buffalo).  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE fig.  In fact, I think it is sadly underused, so I was excited to come here and try it.  But this pizza?  Too much fig!  Totally overpowered everything.  I couldn't even eat the pizza crust with the fig on it, I ended up eating a small bite with the most of the prosciutto.  The other pizza combos were really good!  Another friend got their mushroom risotto, which had great pieces of duck in it and was great, but again, after awhile, the fig became slightly overpowering a flavor in the dish.  The bread pudding dessert was excellent, creamy, a heart-attack waiting to happen, but completely worth every bite!  \\n\\nOverall, a nice restaurant.  I think what really keeps this at 4 stars is the staff.  The food is good, but frankly - the next time I come here, I think I may have to check out their entree selections instead of the pizzas.  With tax and tip, it came out to about $36 a person (with drinks)."},{"name":"Domino's Pizza","address":"570 Broadway","city":"Revere","stars":"1.5","text":"Dominos just lost me as a customer for life.

I ordered the salmon panani, which is one of their more popular entrees.  When I unwrapped my order, I discovered that, unlike the picture on the menu, the sandwich was absolutely loaded with mayonnaise.  To be honest, I'm not sure how they can even afford to assemble this sandwich - the portion of salmon was good sized for the price, and covered in at least $8 worth of mayo.\\n\\nI was pleased with the side option of an apple, though!\\n\\nI may give this place another shot, but definitely ask them to hold the mayo.

We arrived around 6:30, didn't get seated till 7:45, and when we did get seated it was outside on the patio and in the rain. They have heat lamps outside which are all well and good but they didn't turn them on until about half way through our meal when the waiter realized everyone on the patio was cold and getting sprinkled on. \\n\\nThat aside the food in my opinion gets mixed reviews. I got the combination with 4 ribs and choice of meat and two sides along with cornbread and corn on the cob.  I choose to get the barbecue chicken as my second meat and beans and apple slices as my side. \\n\\n1) The corn on the cob was horrible. It was soggy and flavorless and appeared to have been soaked in pot of water for the whole night. \\n\\n2) The corn bread was very good. Not on par with Marie Calender's  but still quite delicious.\\n\\n3) The bean concoction was quite flavorful and even had slices of pork in it which made it all the better.\\n\\n4) The apple slices were too sweet and not what I expected. I should have read the description. \\n\\n5) The barbeque chicken was boring, if it were not for me having been generous with self application of the \\"Devil's Spit\\" sauce on the table, I might not have known it was even barbecued in the first place.\\n\\n6) The award winning St. Louis ribs were delicious on their own and in combination with the various sauces. \\n\\nI also had the privilege of trying some baby back ribs and cole slaw and they were equally as good as the St. Louis ribs, in their own way of course.\\n\\nHands down I have to say that the BBQ parts of the meal, chicken aside, were amazing and well worth the hour wait.

On this particular visit, I ordered a sausage and hash skillet with scrambled eggs and multigrain toast. The skillet was very tasty and filling. The seasoning was perfect, exactly the way I would like a hearty breakfast to taste. The potatoes were crisp and served as a great counter to sausage that can get greasy at times. I also tried the apple cinnamon french toast. It's a tad bit to much syrup, but the taste was awesome. I ordered an alcoholic drink as well, but do not remember the name of it. It tasted good and wasn't skimpy on the alcohol.\\n\\nWe were in line for almost 2 hours before we were seated. We wouldn't have waited that long but when we initially got there, the staff explicitly told my party of 3 that the wait would be around 35 minutes. That turned into 45 minutes 20 minutes after we were told 35. The time kept growing longer and the staff seemed to get much more dodgy. I felt that the people in line were misled on purpose to ensure we stayed. There's no reason to not have a system where you can place a name down and receive a call or text message when the table is ready, especially for such a small establishment where long waits are common. Once we were seated, the service and food came quickly. It surprised me how fast the food came.\\n\\nThe wait was a very negative experience however and would likely stop me from returning if I saw the line.

After you have explored Boston Commons and the infamous IG worthy Acorn St, stop by Figs for awesome and unique pizza. I went around 6PM on a Wednesday and it was not too busy. The restaurant is very tiny so if you have a party bigger than 5 people, I would call ahead of time just in case. Upon arrival, my friend and I were greeted by the front person who seemed a bit awkward and didn't clearly seat us; it was more like my friend and I were both confused and finally figured out that he told us that we could sit where ever we liked. The pizza definitely deserves 5 stars, however service was almost nonexistent thus the 4 stars. From the start to finish, a waiter was not introduced to us and we literally had to ask for everything: the menu, bread, water, togo containers, and even our check. Usually if the service is horrible the review would not get anything over 2 stars, however since I moved to Boston I have found it very hard to find authentic restaurants that serve gastronomically amazing food. \\n\\nfood: \\n-complimentary bread: I was ready a couple of yelp reviews on the bread so I was a little excited to see if it was that good. Unfortunately, I have to respectfully disagree and say the bread was MEH. It honestly was more like a corn bread and not a fluffy and light homemade bread loaf. This was a good thing for me because it allowed me to save room for the pizza. \\n-half calamari // half portobello: HUGE! There is only one size available for the pizza. 1/2 and 1/2 options are available and highly recommended! Very reasonably priced for the size and taste. I would recommend splitting the pizza between 2 very hungry individuals or it is even big enough for a party of three to share. If you enjoy calamari, the calamari pizza is a must! There is no cheese on the pie, however the marinara and perfectly fried calamari is enough for you to forget about the missing cheese. The arugula helps to bring that bitter balance to the sweet tomato sauce. The portobello slice was amazing as well. The truffle oil was not too overbearing and it went well with the mushrooms and fontina cheese. This pie would be great for the cheese lovers because it is overloaded with cheese. The dough was nice and thin, which was a good thing because the pizza toppings are literally the star of the show! ORDERING A PIZZA IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. So much better than all of the mouth watering pictures. \\n\\nOverall, I would come back for the delicious pizza despite their nonexistent service. If there service was some what descent, this place would have gotten 5 stars in my book. Thank you for having such amazing and unique pizza topping options! I have to come back to try their other entrees. \\n\\nTransportation: Green line off of the Park St. stop and just walk through Boston Common (0.4mi walk away from T stop)."},{"name":"La Tagliatella","address":"933 Peachtree St NE, Ste 919","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"So, here's the thing. La Tagliatella sent out flyers to residents in midtown for a free \\"Provoletto\\" with the purchase of an entree at lunch or dinner. According to the menu, this Antipasti course consists of provolone cheese baked with saut√©ed zucchini and sol√© di Puglia tomatoes. Sounds delicious, yes? \\n\\nBut when I called to check about gluten free menu options, I was told by the restaurant that nothing on their menu would be safe for me to eat. Really? I found that hard to believe, so I persisted in my questioning. Most restaurants these days have options. Heck, even chain Italian restaurants like Maggiano's can accommodate patrons with gluten allergies. So can most upscale Italian eateries in Atlanta. I'd think a restaurant that originated in Europe, where Celiac disease is commonplace and where you can buy GF pasta at the local pharmacy, would be able to cater to anyone with a food allergy, be it gluten, nuts, soy, or dairy.\\n\\nNone of the ingredients listed in the Provoletto should contain gluten - cheese, zucchini, tomatoes. Baked, not fried. No mention of bread crumbs or added flour. Same with many of their other menu item descriptions online. Based on a thorough menu review before I called La Tagliatella, I expected at least a few of their many items could be made GF.\\n\\nTurns out, the answer was still a big fat no. \\"We cannot accommodate you at this time,\\" the woman that answered the phone told me.\\n\\nI was really looking forward to checking out one of the newer additions to my neighborhood, but alas, it is not to be.

Granted it was busy, as it was Sunday brunch, and our waitress did seem to be covering a lot of areas, but it got to the point where we had to flag down the hostess to ask for the bill as our waitress was nowhere to be found.  Then after we got the bill we had to try and flag down the waitress as it was wrong.\\n\\nPros: Food and drink were excellent.  Breakfast started with a softshell crab pancake app and a perfectly done Bloody Mary. Second course was a Brunch on the Bayou which was a shrimp, goat cheese and roasted fennel omelet on the side a soft buttermilk biscuit and yummy grits (see picture).  Coffee was good, nothing to absolutely rave about, but it served its purpose.\\n\\nCons: As stated above, it got really busy due to the fact that it was Sunday brunch so towards the end of the service we were basically ignored by our waitress.  We got there shortly after it opened and were seated immediately inside.  Our waitress promptly came over and was very friendly and helpful and made suggestions which we took advantage of immediately in regards to drink choice.  We ordered the drinks first, which I noticed took a little bit to get to us but at this point not a big deal.  We then ordered an app to share while we made our decision about the main course.  The app came on a single plate, but no individual plates for us to take our own portion of the app which made things difficult as it was not finger food.  At this point our waitress disappeared.  She was also covering the outside tables and was out there most of the time.  We finished our apps and then our drinks which were cleared away by the bus boy.  We then sat there for a little bit waiting for the waitress to come back and take the rest of our order.  Finally, just before I was about to get up and grab the hostess, our waitress came over to take our order.  She took our order and also asked if we wanted another drink, which I said yes.  Meal came, after another long wait, and as stated the food was excellent, but the drink never came.  So we finished our meal and sat around some more until we finally flagged down the hostess who got us our bill which we then had to sit around for longer until we could flag down our waitress to remove the drink that was not received from the bill.\\n\\nTo summarize, yes I would definitely eat here again as the food was incredible but I would definitely do things a little differently.  \\n1. I would not go on a Sunday again as I think it just gets too busy for them to handle.\\n2. If it is a nice day out, sit outside as that is where the waitstaff tends to focus most of their attention.\\n3.

Indoor seating is within the Lavaca Street Bar, and it being a football Sunday it was sooooooo fucking loud in there.  It was ridiculous.  Not only are drunk football fans shouting in your ear, but they're playing loud music over everything so conversation is pretty much impossible.  Plus they charged me $2 for a 6 oz soda, which had be refilled four times at the bar...annoying!\\n\\nThe menu prices are fairly obscene for tacos and po' boys so the food had to be amazing to meet expectations.  Unfortunately, the fish tacos and cilantro fries were just pedestrian. It was just a taco with some cod, slaw, red onions, tomatoes and a little bit of ranch in it. Everything tasted fresh, but honestly given the hoopla and expense I expected more. The cilantro fries were okay, but I swear I've had better fries from the freezer section in Costco. But then again, Costco has pretty good fries.   \\n\\nSo in summary, we had to sit in a loud, unappealing sports bar to eat expensive and good but not great food.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing and came on the wrong day of the week, but I have a strong suspicion this place is overrated.

We got the combo so we also got fries and a drink, bill was $9.96 I think.  The burgers were good and fresh, the fries were the very thin stringy kind.

After telling the waitress that we needed another minute to look at the menu, it took 15 minutes for her to finally come back to take our order.  My wife ordered a house salad with chicken with dressing on the side. I ordered the half-rack of ribs.  We waited forever. The salad arrived drenched in dressing that was supposed to be on the side. The chicken was dry and jerky-like - inedible by most standards. My ribs were cold, and slathered in a ketchup-like substance. They didn't taste like they'd been prepared on a smoker, but pressure cooked or boiled, and then reheated. The corn that came with the ribs was burned black (not \\"caramelized\\" as it should be).

The also offer a wide degree of preparations, basically offering to prepare each item exactly as you desire. For example, I usually like my steak done Pittsburgh (heavily seared on the outside, cool red in the center) which was a style they had listed right there on their menu which is a style of preparation I've often ordered but never actually seen listed on a menu.\\n\\nThe service, explanations of various dishes along with a presentation of various meats prior to cooking couldn't have been more detailed or better presented.

I don't care what type of food you serve, if the ingredients are not fresh it is not good.

The woman at the counter allowed me to go ahead and take the food, paying for it the next morning. \\n\\nA recent reason why I've grown to adore Rosa's is the Italian ice. For $2.25, patrons receive a large cup of mango, cherry or rainbow refreshing goodness--half the price of smaller, heavier froyo portions down the street.

Having 20 years of experiences from eating at some of the very best of both LA and Las Vegas, it's easy to compare against the \\"Best of All Time.\\"  I've had sushi experiences that have brought tears from pleasure and joy and I've been to places that are unmentionable.  Rating sushi is more difficult than rating a steak or a burger joint.  Yes I am a sushi snob.\\n\\nAnyways, enough of my preface for Kenobi.  Here we go...\\n\\nMy first impression was a mysterious one because their front doors are rather large, heavy, and fortress like.  When I opened the doors, the restaurant immediately featured an almost Vegas Bar & Club vibe.  I have to say, I was impressed and intrigued.  The decor overall is very well done making for a hip and comfortable atmosphere.  The greeting at the front door and service from the wait staff was overall excellent.  Menu selection was pretty acceptable for a sushi snob such as myself.  \\n\\nI rate sushi based on the quality and freshness of the sashimi itself.  Artsy rolls are tasty and fun but the chef's sauces can mask imperfect fish for the most part.  So the true upfront test of a great sushi joint is to go for the mostly moved products; yellowtail, albacore, and salmon.  The yellowtail and albacore sashimi were served over a bed of small pellet sized ice.  So it left the fish feeling a little to close to the frozen side.  Yeah they were acceptable in taste but not thrilling by any means.  After the sashimi test it was onto the artsy rolls.  The Lickity Split was pretty tasty but the others left much to be desired and that's probably why I couldn't tell you their names.  \\n\\nSo I guess you'd want to know if I would eat there again?  Yeah, if I were with a group and that's where they decided on going, I would.  However, for my \\"jones fix,\\" I'll keep searching for that spot.  Overall, I thought the place gave off a great vibe.  \\n\\nWhat I'm afraid of overall is that the local sushi clientele doesn't demand a fabulous product, so the local vendors can afford to be lazy in their purchase of fine quality.

The dining room makes you feel important and ready to spend some money.  One of the two managers sat our group of five.  Pictures of the Old Fourth Ward adorn the brick walls.  The juxtaposition of well appointed tables and exposed ceilings I found very comforting.  This is one of the things I love about Atlanta's southern dining.  Elegant yet comfortable; I would suggest a jacket though probably not necessary.

Certainly what you would have expected.  Apps ordered were charcuterie and cheese board.  The selection was good and ample.  \\nFor dinner I ordered grouper.  My wife ordered braised rabbit and octopus as small plates.  The table ordered brussel sprouts and roasted potatoes.  My grouper was nicely done on atop cauliflower puree and raisins. The portion was a little small.  The wife's octopus was wood grilled served with beets and was very flavorful and tender.  The rabbit was served with gnocchi but the texture was a little soft I thought.  All dishes were enjoyed at the table. \\nNow comes the best part! They have a sticky toffee pudding for dessert! It was absolutely decadent, so sweet and warm.  I find this dessert hard to find and often when I do it is not done properly.  This is the best I have had in Atlanta.   \\n4th and Swift is a nice place to impress and bring an out of town guest or for date night. Great place to go before a show at the Fox.

Plenty of goat cheese on top that my husband picked diligently off of his leaves and I ate them all =P\\n\\nWhen initially looking at the pizza menu, I thought wow $22 bucks for a pizza? That's super expensive (thinking they're personal sized ones). I looked around and was floored by the size of some of them. They're solidly 1 foot by 2 foot, and not shy with the toppings. The calamari pizza was literally a heaping plate of calamari on top of the pizza, everyone at that table was taking pictures non-stop.\\n\\nAnyways, you are allowed to order 1/2 and 1/2, so we decided on prosciutto and fig jam, plus buffalo chicken. You can watch the pizza look in the brick oven right in the dining room which is always neat. Very thin crust so the pizza came out quite fast. Generous portions of prosciutto and very tasty. \\n\\nThe only complaint I have and hence 4 stars: since we ordered 2 different toppings on the same pizza, I think the prosciutto side got overcooked. The meat got a little dry and the fig jam got a little burnt, probably was a result of trying to the buffalo chicken adequately. I would figure when there is such a difference between the 2 toppings, while a little more work, it would make sense to start cooking the chicken half first, then add the fig jam/prosciutto to prevent this from happening.\\n\\nOverall, very solid thin crust pizza, will be back!"},{"name":"Zoes Kitchen","address":"2333-A Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I eat there on occasion ,mainly kebabs , every time I order a kebab plate the size is very inconsistent and I don't mean only the kebabs but also the sides ...and I won't complain if every time the inconsistency would be Bigger :-) ...but is always smaller and smaller portions ,lol\\nso Zoe !

But I had never been for dinner.\\n\\nI am a steak guy, I love and admire a well cut, well aged, well cooked piece of beef.  I have traveled and tasted steak in a number of city's and countries. I consider myself pretty discerning when it comes to steak, and I can be pretty hard to please. UF didn't disappoint.\\n\\nTo be fair, I had no idea UF was a steak house. My typical choice for steak in Portland is El Goucho. I have never been disappointed there and tend to play it safe. But I decided to give UF a shot.\\n\\nFirst, the selection is great. All prime grade, some grass fed, some grain finished and some Wagyu. They dry age several cuts for as many as 45 days. All perfectly selected and trimmed. But the meat is only half the job, the prep, is the other part of the equation.\\n\\nI order all my steak medium rare, 135 degrees with a warm red center. Now I am not such a douche that I bring a meat thermometer to the restaurant but, when spending $50-$60 dollars for a single piece of meat, I will send it back if it's not properly cooked. no need at UF.\\n\\nThe meat (24oz grain finished dry aged rib-eye) was perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of salt and pepper. There was a fairly heavy smoke flavor but not enough to be distracting. I suspect they are cooking it over charcoal but it was a welcome taste. Sometimes the rib-eye will flare up and you will get a horrible burnt fat taste all over the steak. Not here.\\n\\nBeyond the steak we had some nice cocktails, some really good sides, the Twice Baked Fingerling Potato Tart was yummy. They have a great wine list as well. We choose to bring our own California Cab and they were gracious enough to open it for us (for a $20 corkage fee of course).\\n\\nOverall, I was very pleased with the meal and the service. At the end of the meal, I was very happy with the bill. We could have easily spent twice as much at my regular choice for the same quality and portions of food.

I then stood with my mother and looked over a menu to see what i would like to order once i got inside. The wait was going to be about half an hour, and i did not mind waiting. About twenty minutes into our wait, the hostess said there were three open seats at the counter for those who did not wish to wait. When about two minutes passed and no one claimed them, we went in and happily took our seats.\\n\\n     Though he was rushed, our server remained polite and immediately asked for our drink order.

My mother ordered the Hi-flyer and substituted her grits for the \\"moon-dusted\\" rosemary potatoes.\\n\\n     My meal was excellent. The goat cheese gave it a kind of tart taste that i do not know how to describe besides the fact that it tasted like a goat cheese omelet.

The direct and simple way of assessing the quality of a Japanese restaurant would be to sample the nigiri, because the cut, thickness, quality, freshness of the fish as well as the quality of the rice ( is it made with the right amount of vinegar and cooked to the right degree and used the right type of rice) are all deciding factors. \\n\\nI had the deluxe assorted nigiri platter and it was quickly served with: salmon, tuna, hamachi, ika, roe, chopped scallop, unagi, sweet shrimp, and a California roll and perhaps I forgot what else. \\n\\nThe sweet shrimp is so delicious and has this sweet and smooth texture in the chew. The head is crispy-deep fried and I love it. \\n\\nThe rest of the fish all taste superbly fresh and I love the fish to rice portion. One note is that the nigiri all have a dab of freshly grated wasabi on them so you really don't need to add any more wasabi into your soy sauce. \\n\\nAlso, given the high quality of the fish I recommend just give it a dab of soy sauce instead of dunk it into the soy sauce. \\n\\nI'm not a big fan of the rice, though it's cooked to the right texture and seasoned right.

We arrived at 6:30pm on a Saturday hoping to get a table since it was relatively early, unfortunately they didn't have one and the next reservation was at 8:30pm.  We waited at the bar for 5 minutes trying to decide what we should do, finally chose to get the reservation and wait at the bar.  Great decision.\\n\\nWe spent 2 hours at the bar drinking some of the best martini's I've ever had.  I strongly recommend their Strawberry Kiwi martini, something sweet and delicious to calm the nerves or get the night started.  The Blueberry Lemon Drop was a bit sour for my taste.  The Mango Tango was good - not too sweet.  We also ordered their chips with blue cheese dressing, a pretty good appetizer for the bar.\\n\\nWhen we finally sat down, I began with a Iceberg wedge.  Unfortunately, I was expecting something a bit more flavorful.  Sullivan's apparently has a love of blue cheese on their appetizers which is good and all but not my choice for the Iceberg wedge.  Flemming's has a better Iceberg wedge.\\n\\nMy entree was a Bone-In Rib eye \\"Cowboy\\" cut.  I ordered it medium well but when I received it, it was a bit more on the well done side.  Judging by the char, the fire they use is extremely hot and one would need to be careful when cooking these.  Aside from these minor issues, this was one of the best steaks I've ever had.  It was delicious.  I like rib eye better than other cuts, plus the bone and grizzle do give it an additional flavor as opposed to just the meat.  I highly, highly recommend this steak.\\n\\nFor dessert, I had their New York style cheesecake.  Amazing.  Most cheesecakes I've tasted are too sweet or creamy.  Considering the type of establishment this is, I would expect nothing less from Sullivan's.\\n\\nFor those who can afford it, a visit once a week here is well worth it.  For anyone else, I strongly suggest you visit it at least once when you're in Austin.  The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 was due to the Iceberg wedge and the slightly over cooked steak other than that, great experience."},{"name":"Sun in My Belly","address":"2161 College Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I'd heard great things about SIMB and decided to visit for breakfast yesterday.

Since they do not come with fries, we had to order the separately.  I had requested pickles and mayo on the side because I know that I could not just eat plain meat and cheese.  While we waited on food there was a party of maybe 10 that entered and was seated in an area behind my booth.  I noticed that our waitress' eyes lit up when she was told that she would be waiting that table.  I am sure since they make a living on tips, the number of people would guarantee her automatic gratuity.  Now that brings me to the meal, which was brought out by a male server without the pickles or mayo.  We waited a few minutes since we figured that she would come by and check to see if we needed anything else.  Wrong this chick went to the bar to pickup some glasses or wine that her new party had ordered.  No problem right, we think its ok she will be over in a minute.  She finally came over and we asked for the pickles and mayo, so off she went. After several minutes go by and she was no where in sight, we went to bar to ask for items. Then I looked back and saw that she was actually taken the large parties order, while I sat with my food getting cold, waiting on her to return. The manager had just been standing around and carefully choosing tables to stop by and check on people.  Not to say that he meant to but it was very odd that he checked on all the tables around us but said nothing to us... maybe since we didn't share his appearance he didn't care. So while waiting at the bar, she still never came back to the table. I had held quiet long enough and got up to find someone.  This is when I look back and see the waitress so I motioned for the manager to come over. He slowly dragged over to the table and I told him I had been waiting on this girl to come back and obviously she cared more for the larger party.  I expressed how shocked I was to be waiting on her to come back all the while she is taking an entire order.  My food was getting colder as time passed.  His only response was that she had to take care of her customers. HALT WTH was I??? I am not her customer so screw me. He goes toward the kitchen but when he noticed that we had the items, he never attempted to return.  After finally dressing my burger the waitress comes over... I told her to keep moving and don't stop.. I was so damn mad I could spit fire.  After the meal was done she returned again and I asked for the check, she then apologized for not bringing the pickles.. however I did not make any eye contact with her because at that point whatever she said had no meaning to me.  I used to frequent the Cumberland location and never experienced this level of poor service.  Perhaps that is why they were damn near empty because I am sure if Ted knew that his place was being run half a****, he would not be pleased.  I love bison and what Ted's stand for so I will definitely be returning--just not to this location! Overall she received the standard 20% tip that I start with, although she did not deserve a penny because she did not provide any service.  I am sure that she was shocked when she saw her tip because if the rolls were reversed she would not have left anything. I think as I type this I will send in a complaint to corporate because the manager's lack of concern is my concern!"},{"name":"Charlie's Kitchen","address":"10 Eliot St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Went to the beer garden at Charlies Kitchen last, and I have to say it never disappoints.

As a Medford resident it is traitorous to offer criticism about a local business, but the atmosphere is not just 'no-frills' but dead and depressing. The most prominent feature is the restroom door at the end of this tunnel-like space. There is no view (the blinds were closed to a lovely late summer afternoon), there is no air circulation (ceiling fans were off, inexplicably), and the sound, absent any ambiant noise such as music or water or even the hum of a fan, is what you'd expect in such a closed-in, cavernous space. I could hear forks scraping on the plates of diners halfway across the room. Want a private conversation? Forget it. No wonder the restaurant does such a big takeout business. It is sad and depressing to eat there. Unless you sit at the bar, which is not an option if a member of your party is under 18 (this rule bizarrely varies from city or town to another -- e.g. it is ok in somerville).

We looked through many yelp reviews and being that pancakes are a definite must in our lives, we discovered Jam Cafe. They have red velvet pancakes on their menu, and let me tell you, these pancakes melt in your mouth and go straight to your stomach, especially with a heap of their cream cheese sauce. Their coffee is VERY GOOD and was the perfect complement to the red velvet pancake. \\n\\nI had The Gravy Coop, which was a fried chicken patty in between two giant biscuits, with a side of sausage gravy (yum), a nice helping of hash browns, and two perfectly sunny side up eggs on top of the chicken and biscuits. I was thoroughly satisfied. \\n\\nMy husband had the Herald omelette with cheddar cheese, green onions, tomatoes, and mushrooms added; it came with hash browns, toast (sourdough is always our choice), and chicken apple sausage on special request since he is pork averse. My hubby practically licked his plate clean. His toast came with a special strawberry jam that was so fresh, sweet, and tasty that we asked them if we could take some home--they kindly obliged and gave us two helpings of it to take home. They also have a fresh, homemade jalapeno sauce that really brought out a lot of flavor in the entire omelette. So yummy! To our surprise, we found out that they sell this sauce and we quickly said 'yes, please!'  when our server asked if we wanted to buy some.  \\n\\nWe came late (around 2:10), so we thankfully missed most of the rush that many people talk about in the yelp reviews and we only waited about 15-20 mins before getting seated. We loved the rustic atmosphere and decor. The only downside is that they accidentally forgot to put our order in initially and we waited close to half an hour before they realized the mistake. We waited another 20 mins before the food came out. It was a long wait but worth it in the end bc the food was so good. They comped us our pancakes and coffee, which helped make up for the time lost as well. \\n\\nOverall, this place was great and we would certainly come again.

I asked him why he did that as I saw a family of 11 just stroll in and got one of the two empty tables. No eye contact no answer. Clearly this restaurant does not care for its patrons as they are also kept busy by patrons like myself. Have been a regular here for over 10years with my family. Sorry to say I'm quite disappointed with the fellow (skinny built, glasses) who was in charge or placing people at tables. On a side note he came over dropped off a tea pot with no cups.

The reviewers aren't kidding when they say that they give you large amounts of food; I had enough left over for lunch the next day! I asked for my seafood blackened, and it had just the right amount of kick to it. A manager stopped by our table to make sure that we were having a good experience. We told him it was our first time there, and he was glad we gave it a try. My husband said he noticed that there was an empty Joe's Crab Shack next door, and he said, \\"Yes, when they opened, they told us they were going to put us out of business.

I don't have that many places I frequent, but my boyfriend and I have been big fans since we first had dinner here over a year ago. \\n\\nThe only explanation I can come up with is that the chef must have changed. I have no idea if that's actually the case, only suspicions based on how different our meal was last night. \\n\\nWe came in with the Scoutmob and a reservation and were promptly seated by a friendly hostess. Our table was a little cramped (at one point the server actually dripped something from a plate on the back of a gentleman at the next table, and at another point my boyfriend nearly took an elbow to the head), but we're used to that aspect of the restaurant. It's a cozy, quaint place, not somewhere to sprawl your legs in the aisle like you're drinking a Miller High Life and eating wings at the sports bar. \\n\\nWe both ordered the Lucy for our salad; for our entrees, I had the wild mushroom ravioli and he had the seared scallops; and for dessert, we chose the honey and cinnamon creme brulee. We also chose to add on the coconut curry mussels as an appetizer, partly because we were jet lagged and starving, and partly because they've always been the absolute shining star of our meals here.\\n\\nThe mussels arrived first, a glorious hot and steamy bowl of the most flavorful green curry with mussels and crusty bread. This time, it looked very different. We got about half the number of mussels, half the curry sauce, and twice as much bread. While it still was absolutely delicious, the sauce was also much thicker this time around, so it didn't soak into the bread quite like it used to. This was maybe the first sign that things had changed, but because it was yummy, we just noted the changes and went about the meal.  \\n\\nOur salads came next. In the past, I remember that my salad came undressed, which I much prefer. This time, it came bathed in the dressing and with way too many red onions on top. While it tasted good, it again was just a sign of things to come. \\n\\nOur entrees arrived. The ravioli looked good, but the seared scallop plate was definitely a little odd. The beet sauce that had been noted in the description, which was a very strong flavor, was pooled underneath the scallops as if they were murder victims. The lentil salad on the side had dill, which seemed an awful compliment to the beet sauce, and which was ultimately flavorless. He ended up eating the scallops, but trying to scrape all of the beet sauce off of them. The lentil salad went untouched after the first bite. \\n\\nWhile the ravioli was better, it was tough, overcooked, and the filling was flavorless. It was topped with cheese and sauteed greens which were okay. There was supposedly truffle oil on top, but if there was, I couldn't taste it. While it was certainly the better of the two meals, it still was not a home run, or even a base hit. \\n\\nThe creme brulee was good, although very sweet. But then, that didn't bother me a bit. Desserts should be sweet, no? \\n\\nOverall, there was nothing very memorable about this meal. While the coconut curry mussels were still the number one highlight, the absolute scene-stealer, we were overcharged for them by a dollar when the bill came. I'm fairly certain that our disappointment was palpable as we left what used to be one of our very favorite places. Although I'm willing to give it one more shot, I'm not sure my boyfriend will be.

The bright white brick walls are splashed with the perfect amount of dispersed light to lend an air of luxury, immediately setting the mood.  \\n\\nOur two-top booth was tucked away in an alcove behind bar and felt suitably intimate.

The accompanying piquillo chow-chow and lemon thyme creme fraiche are superb, and should be entirely sopped up by the deliciously tangy complimentary bread.\\n\\nThe scallops in my entree were the best I've ever had.  Extremely delicate but with a perfectly brown crust on top that will be dreamed about.  The asparagus preparation was unique--absolutely huge spears split down the middle--but complemented by the cucumber jus it took everything to the next level.\\n\\nMy wife had the dry-aged prime rib eye and it was prodigious.  It's difficult to get a truly rare steak in this city, but they nailed it.  The flavor was sublime and the dry-aging kept it from being overly bloody.\\n\\nThe hits just kept on coming with dessert.  I don't care how much you've already eaten, dessert at 4th & Swift is compulsory.  The flourless chocolate cake with tart cherry ice cream is ridiculous.  It's a small serving but the amount of harmonized flavor is killer.  Paired with the 10 yr tawny port it was the perfect end to a magnificent meal.  \\n\\nThe service was also perfectly calibrated.

Had a vague idea it was a restaurant, but until I read a review on yelp, I didn't think about stopping. So I went in early evening. I found out after standing near the door it was a seat yourself situation. I f it was later in the evening or the weekend, I believe that it is probably likely you may have to wait. My waitress came promptly. She took my drink order while I studied the menu. I wish I could remember her name as she was quite. I think I may have rattled her because I told her it was my first visit. If she reads reviews, she may recognize herself. She brought my Iced tea and just as it seemed like she was putting it on my table, something happened and she somehow dropped it on the floor. Ice and tea all over the floor, but none on me. She apologized profusely and I reassured it was alright, not a drop on me. She said in all the 6 (or was it 7) years she had worked there this had not happened to her and she said I would probably not come back. I assured that I had my share of spills, especially if the liquid is red or pink, going all the way back to childhood. Well everyone around me chimed in and it was a very friendly atmosphere. I was testing the restaurant so if my husband is wanting a steak or seafood we have a place close by to come to. Well I did get a NY strip and it was delish and in the past at other restaurants a goodly portion of a NY strip is fatty. Well not here. It had hardly any fat. .I suppose they  hand cut the steak in the kitchen or somewhere, as this was no chain restaurant steak. It was cooked perfectly. The sides not quite as good...but were decent. I thought the salad was much better than they made it sound in some other reviews, and the broccoli and baked potato were served at the correct temperature. I did have leftovers because I ate all 3 rolls she gave...almost no one gives free bread these days, so I gave in to temptation. So I took home half my steak and sides. I really loved this place. It reminds me of a childhood steakhouse our family went to many years ago. Most of these types of restaurants have long ago closed up shop. I can hardly wait to come back and try the seafood.  Now as others have said, if you want a modern hip and happening noisy hopping place, this may not be the place for you, but give it a try if you don't want to eat at yet another chain restaurant."},{"name":"BB Rover's Cafe & Pub","address":"12636 Research Blvd, Ste B101","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"BB Rovers is strictly a beer joint - but it's a great beer joint!

I often reward myself for a hard days studying in the library with a Boloco burrito. They are without a doubt the best burrito place in the area, far superior to the overstuffed, under-flavored Chipotle, and even better than Anna's (which is pretty good). The rice to bean to meat to salsa ratio is always just right and the burritos are manageably sized so I don't feel like I need to puke after consuming one. I recommend the classic with chicken or carnitas. I also love that I can substitute brown rice and a whole wheat tortilla if I'm feeling like something a bit healthier!\\n\\nSpeaking of being healthier, as the devoted sweets fan I am I can't let this review go without commenting on Boloco's chocolate chip cookies. Usually I am wary of fast food restaurant chains who throw some giant pre-wrapped cookie at the register for a few extra bucks (i.e. Chipotle, Cosi, Qdoba, etc). My experiences with these cookies have usually been that they are not worth the enormous amount of calories - usually either too sweet or completely flavorless and often way too hard after sitting out for days. But today, against my better judgment, I made a last minute grab and tried one just to see - and for what it was, it was pretty impressive. Almost bakery quality. Not too crunchy, not too soft, chocolate chips that melt when you bite into them, delicious and buttery, and big enough to nibble on for a bit and then save the rest for a treat later. I was so pleasantly surprised.\\n\\nMinus 1 star for the smoothies though. I've only tried the soy smoothie (soy milk, strawberries, bananas and honey), but I was not impressed. I couldn't taste the bananas or honey, and what I could taste of the strawberries was very bland. One of my friends got sick from her Boloco smoothie. Though, to be fair, another friend swears by their Nutella milkshakes.\\n\\nOh and I completely disagree with m k about the service. Every time I've been to the store everyone has been extremely friendly and I've never had to wait long for my food. There's even one lady who works behind the bar that knows me by name, and I only stop in every few weeks, so that's impressive."},{"name":"So Crab So Good Seafood Restaurant","address":"3853 Hastings Street","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"We stopped by to try the $8.99 pasta lunch special. You are able to create your own pasta, toppings and sauce combination. You can also pay for additional options. We ordered two pastas and paid $2.99 extra for a chowder set (seafood chowder and Portuguese bun). \\n\\nI picked fettuccine, clams and scallops with holy smoke sauce. There was a free topping of bacon crumbs that I picked as well. It actually tasted pretty good! Plenty of fresh tasting clams and probably previously frozen scallops for the price. Lots of sauce and it was mildly spicy. The chowder set was just as good. Portuguese bun was fresh and crispy. The chowder was loaded with seafood but was missing the potato. Some people would question if that is really a \\"chowder\\" but I really enjoyed it nonetheless. My only complaint is that the clams were intentionally opened completely and placed around the dish. I would have liked it if the clams opened up naturally and mixed into the pasta. The presentation of the pasta was a bit odd with a circle of clams around the plate. 4/5 for the food. My date had mixed pasta, sausage and scallops with garlic butter sauce. He said it was pretty good as well. We also received some ice pops for dessert when we paid for our bill. Awesome moment reliving my childhood even for a short time lol! That was free so I was surprised and enjoyed my ice pop in the hot weather.\\n\\nOur server looked really young and did not know how to be a server. She assumed we were ordering the a crab combo or something and set up the wrong cutlery before we placed our order. When she did take our order, she then preceded to take away the cutlery and give us the proper set up for our meal. That is inefficient. It took forever for her to bring our water to our table. That should be one of the first things she should make as a priority (anyone's drinks). Also, she did not seem to like her job. \\n\\nAmbiance is okay. Lots of orange everywhere. Nothing fancy.\\n\\nCleanliness can use some work. First off, we had to go up a set of stairs to get to the restaurant. The stairs was full of dried leaves. They should vacuum the stairs regularly as first impression matters. Also, there are no screens to the windows so flies were flying around my meal. I chose to sit next to the window for better lighting and was met by numerous flies flying in and out of the window. The rest of the restaurant looked clean enough.\\n\\nThis place has potential to be better. Because of the cleanliness and inexperienced server, I rate this overall experience as 3 stars. I might stopped by to try a crab combo. There were 3 tables eating those combos but I only wanted a small meal. I do think the pasta special was a good deal and I might stop by to try that again as well.

Salad was great with just a very light dressing. Miso soup had lots of veggies in it, kinda boring, but did the trick as a starter. Dinner was veggie tacos w/ carrots, mushrooms, some others. Great flavor and texture, and the sauce was yum. Speaking of yum sauce they had this green tomatilla-avacado mess that was divine. I wasn't sure what it went on, so I choose the rice and beans.

The cilantro lime slaw wasn't TOO flavorful, but it was just the right amount because it didn't overpower the bbq flavor of the meat. The pickled cucumbers and sesame seeds added a nice touch to the bowl. The beef was shredded and perfectly seasoned. \\n\\nThis place might replace Chipotle when I'm craving a \\"bowl\\" type of meal. \\n\\n\\nWill be coming back to try the other bowls!

The morning we were suppose to arrive I woke up bleeding and was told not to leave my bed as my doctor believed it to be a miscarriage. Devastated I called the hotel right away to tell them I couldn't make it and explained what was happening, the front desk girl told me to call back two hours later (when her manager got in) I did so and then the manager told me I needed to speak to a woman named \\"Jennifer\\" in finance. I spoke to her crying and told her why I could not go and that I knew I had booked a non-refundable reservation but this was a medical emergency, she had no compassion. She told me that they were still going to charge my credit card the full room rate regardless. I've worked in the hotel industry for 10 years, I could not believe this...I understand that you have a \\"non-refundable\\" policy but please, this is not something I could have chosen to happen to me...of course I wanted to make this trip but absolutely could not. They are in downtown Portland, im sure they had no trouble selling that room. \\nPissed off about the whole situation I tweeted the \\"Crown Plaza\\" twitter account to vent. They emailed me apologizing and said that they would have the Portland location call me ASAP to work something out. I get Jennifer on the phone again and she says to me in a bored unsympathetic tone, \\"First of all I'm sorry about what happened and...are you okay?\\" then proceeded to tell me that they will still charge my credit card unless I wanted to change the date, I hadn't had plans to come back to Portland as I live 3 1/2 hours away but for the sake of not getting anything out of the money they basically took from me I agreed and changed the date to a month later. Oh, and they were so nice that instead of keeping my original rate of $119 (on a Friday night) that I had booked under and paid for they told me id have to pay an additional \\"$90\\" on top of that and on a Thursday, most hotels are cheaper midweek and this made no sense to me but whatever, I was exhausted and just agreed to it.\\nOne month down the road my dog goes into kidney failure and we had to take him to a vet specialist in Portland, we were driving back and forth and after paying $3500 for his bills we decided we just couldn't make this Portland trip once again. I knew calling them was going to be a pain. So I call a week 1/2 before my reservation, the front desk transfers me to the hotel manager \\"Magic\\" is what they said her name was but the voicemail was a mans voice and of course no answer so I call right back and get transferred to someone named \\"Nathan\\" in finance and he doesn't answer...determined to get someone on the phone I call back again and get transferred to my old friend \\"Jennifer\\" and what do you know, no answer. At this point im pissed and call back again and get a front desk girl who had been transferring me I believe her name was \\"Athena\\" or \\"Athea\\" either way she was very friendly and had looked into my reservation and after I tell her my situation she tells me I should have never been charged in the first place. Wtf? She tells me she will speak to finance and call me right back. She calls back right away and says that the following day is her day off but she was going into work to get her paycheck and would hand deliver a message to finance and call to let me know whats up---I never get a call. \\nThe weekend passes and on Monday morning I call again and get transferred to the hotel manager, guess what? No answer, amazing. I call back and then they transfer me to finance, you guessed it; no answer. I get a different young girl at the desk and she tells me she doesn't believe I should have been charged either but she would try to transfer me to her manager again, of course no answer. So I email him from the website and as always he doesn't respond.\\nLast resort I email \\"Jennifer\\" (as I had her email from previously speaking to her) I didn't want to speak to her again but I literally could not get anyone else to help me. She ends up calling me and says that some of the employees at the front desk are new and basically that they didn't know what they were talking about pertaining to my situation. She cancels my room so I don't get charged that additional $90 but tells me the $119 plus tax was already charged and part of the non-refundable reservation so there's nothing she could do about it. At this point im trying my hardest to stay calm and not freak out. I just felt defeated and agreed and hung up the phone,\\nWhat the hell is going on at this place??? Way to give me the run around. They really need to change their cancellation policies-I understand its non-refundable but come on, mine was a medical emergency that was out of my control...have some damn compassion.

I asked him to make me a ginger beer, mixed with lime and averno amaro. He said it sounded like a moscow mule, without the gin.

It has now been taken out of Steak Club's regular rotation.\\n\\nMy recommendations for Mooo: Go on a Sunday night to take advantage of the free valet. Fill up on the AMAZING bread, order a side or two for yourself and pass on the steak.  Their desserts are above average and change frequently.

I was going to Vortex however they had a twenty minute wait just to order take out(crazy right).  \\n\\nSo as a fallback I hit it up this place on my walk back to the Hyatt.  A beautiful receptionist greeted me and I felt it was going to be a great experience.  Sat at the bar to order my food and the bartender seemed to be struggling with the few patrons at the bar (no more than 5).  Ordered 4 meatballs and traditional lasagna  and a glass of Stella to drink while I waited, 15 minutes later a waitress approached and asked for my order. Informed her that I had already ordered, she spoke with the bartender and came back and said let me ring it up so it can go back to the kitchen.  What!?!  Whatever, reorder my food because hey the Olympics are on and the event of curling is on (WOW). I'm not in DC anymore Dorothy.  Forty minutes later my food appears at the other end of the bar and I'm hoping it will be worth the wait.  I exercise a little patience for about five minutes as I watch dude talking and laughing with customers, co-workers and then re-engage customers about additional drink orders.  Alright, let's be real.  Understanding that I'm fortunate that the place is open in this weather, I'm a paying customer none the less.  I walk to the other side where the take out bag is and stand in front of it with my AMEX card showing in my hand.  He looks right at me and says, let me get someone to ring you up(bad words run through my head).  Two beautiful young ladies arrive for their takeout order and you would of thought a line of twenty showed up.  Major confusion between the managers and staff, they are truly confused about who took the order and have they been rung up yet.  I picked up the bag and walked to the manager and said, \\"I ordered this please accept my payment or I'm out of here.  He rung it up right then and the ladies stood right behind me and demanded that same payout service.  \\n\\nNow after the trek back to the hotel I stop by the and grab silver ware and a wine opener.  I need a drink and I've got two bottles of Pinot Grigio calling my name in my suite.  Open first box and the meatball look and smell great, would have preferred some sauce to accompany them but what the hay.  I'm really excited for the main course as I hadn't lasagna since the summer, open the box, WTF!?!  My meal is slightly thicker than my iPhone 5.  $20 bucks for an iPhone size slice of lasagna.  I take a bite and it taste like canned ravioli.  I don't do negative reviews but this place gave me no choice.   Some people have stated that they live close by and have never been here to eat.

The first visit was impressive. \\n\\nThe business model is pretty smart, they offer about 20 types of sauce and 20 types of pasta, from stuffed fresh pasta to the hard stuff. You mix and match your pasta and sauce. If you request, your server will guide you with some popular combinations. I had the sorrenteno with bolognese while my partner enjoyed the mezza luna with pesto. The food arrived very quickly (as in, less than five minutes). The flavors were delicious and the plate was huge. The prices seem a little steep until you see the portion size. One plate is easily enough to share, or in our case, a box of leftovers for each of us.\\n\\nThe one bit of the meal that didn't make sense was the focacce liguri. They give you two different tastes. One has cheese, duck ham, and arugula. It was very nice, a mixture of flavors and textures. The second didn't really work for me. It was topped with honey, goat cheese, braseola (air-dried beef), and a balsamic reduction. It was way too sweet. Each of those components by themselves offer quite a bit of sweetness, so to have all of them in one bite was overwhelming. One or two fewer of those components with the addition of acidity would really make the dish shine. That complaint is really a small one, because the overall tempo of the meal was fantastic. Also, when I asked about the pasta, the server said \\"it's made fresh for us.\\" This isn't quite the same as \\"we make it fresh daily.\\" Again, a small point, but I'll be investigating upon my next visit.\\n\\nLa Tagliatella is a great dinner spot for:\\n\\n- Large groups who want some variety in choices\\n- A quick bite before or after a date event\\n- Anyone who likes variety\\n- Folks who want relative familiarity but the freedom to branch out a bit in their menu choices\\n\\nOur waitress, I wish I could remember her name, was attentive without being annoying.

The broccoli was overcooked which is funny because all of the other dishes with veggies we ordered had nice, crisp vegetables.  The beef was just average and the sauce seemed heavy on the cornstarch.  Not nearly up to par with the chicken dishes.  Like that they offer both white and brown rice.\\n\\nExcluding the beef and broccoli dish, the sauces are very light, nothing has been over salted and you can tell they don't use a lot of oil in the foods so it really does seem healthier if your watching fat and sodium.

My first course was Lamb croquets and they were good, I was relieved that I wasn't going to need an ambulance to take me because of death due to starvation.

Yesterday was my second visit in less than a month. \\n\\nMy friend and I went to SIMB yesterday.  We got seated right away and the host was very pleasant.  The waitress took a few minutes, but asked if she could get us drinks.  We asked for water/no ice and tea (as this is another restaurant that needs to learn to use fresh squeesed oj instead of tropicana).  She returned about 5-8 mins later with tea and waters with ice.  No biggie, we informed her we wanted to order and she took our order.  Then the waiting began.  :(  After about 15 mins, we were noticing some 1-2 small flies near us and asked our server to move table.  She had no other tables, so we stayed.  Then we waited for another 5-10 mins, and asked our server when our food would be ready.  She imformed us that it would be up shortly.  After about 10 mins, we got our food.  Our order clearly looked like one dish sat for 10-15 mins while the eggs seems overcooked by sitting too long.  Our food tasted good, but poor tempature qualtiy and timing seem to make it average.  \\n\\nI really hope that SIMB looks at its service.

We had a seat and casually chit chatted with each other waiting to be acknowledged, the male bartender said his long goodbye to I assume his female friends that were leaving the bar and we assumed he would then come over and greet us, which is understandable we all have our friends visit us at work.  He then proceeded to walk half way the direction towards us, pick up his phone and begin text messaging.  \\nNow about 5 minutes have passed since we first sat down at the bar that now has only 4 or 5 people sitting at it and still two bartenders, we continue to wait, he then continues to not only sit on his phone with his back facing the bar but engage the other bartender in whatever it was on his phone, now the woman sitting next to us is getting aggravated, and at this point, about 7 minutes later, we decide to leave.

Let's just say it's a darn good thing that it was only $35 instead of the $70+ we would have paid without the coupon. \\n\\nWe made reservations, so we were seated right away. They brought us the menus. Whoever thought light orange very small type on a white menu was a good idea in very dim lighting was mistaken. I had to squint with the menu an inch from my face just to see what was being offered. \\n\\nWe ordered the mussels for an appetizer. They were good but I wasn't crazy about the coconut milk sauce, a bit too sweet for my taste with mussels and lacking in any other seasoning or flavors. Plus, they were only mildly warm when they brought them out and quickly cooled to room temp.\\n\\n30mins later.... we finally got out Cesar salads.

I was disappointed immediately, as the pics on their website show beautiful people dining happily on their fanciful patio. The hostess led us to an indoor table next to a very loud family and told us our waiter would be right with us. We waited...and waited. A gentleman came by to give us water, but neither looked at us nor uttered so much as a hello. At this point, we were confused. Was this man our waiter? Did we have a waiter? I tried to start a conversation, but we couldn't achieve much over the incredibly loud, \\"romantic\\" Italian music.\\n\\nWhen our waiter eventually arrived, he was apologetic and took our order promptly. The bread that traditionally comes with oil & spices at an Italian joint was cold and hard. I ordered a chardonnay that I was very pleased with...their wine list offers a great range of varietal, vintage and price. My chicken parmesan had decent taste, but came with way too much sauce (the pasta that came on the side was also dripping). My friend wasn't blown away by her eggplant parm, but was quite pleased with the cream sauce & marinara mix that accompanied it. Prices are moderate to expensive, depending on how much you're willing to spend, but you won't get out of there under $35 for two people.\\n\\nAll in all, I felt defeated by my Tree House experience.

There's downstairs seating, upstairs seating and plenty of options on both floors. \\n\\nStarted off dinner with a chilled seafood array. Can't remember but I think we made our own or asked for no oysters.. something like that. It was ok, but seemed previously frozen. Even the look of it wasn't entirely moist. I posted a pic of the dish itself and one of the lobster tails. There aren't a lot of starter options so if you're looking to start with something, I'd say it's an ok dish but don't expect too much. \\n\\nThe pre dinner bread was fine. Basket of buns and flat breads/crackers. The buns were fairly large. Dinner took forever to get to the table so I guess the big mounds of bread could come in handy.\\n\\nFor dinner two of us ordered the filet. Honestly it was one of the better steaks I've had! I was shocked. Seeing the appetizer we chose was just so so. The steak was incredibly juicy and flavorful. Go with the filet because one of us got the steak au poivre and strongly disliked it. She said it was very dry and tough, and said the sauce wasn't very good. It was a \\"flat iron\\" steak so I myself wouldn't have ordered it. Not exactly a great cut of meat. I've also found the entree steaks in steak houses to often be disappointing. Steaks that come with sauce and other additions usually come like that to make up for a blah steak. \\n\\nFor sides we had mashed potatoes which were very good and organic truffle tots, which were fantastic. No doubt high in fat and calories but totally worth it. Perfectly sized little morsels of flavor and texture!\\n\\nEven though service dragged and we were worried we'd have to wait forever we still chose to order dessert. Maybe it was to make up for the lackluster beginning. One of chose the caramel profiteroles, another chose sorbet and I had a tart.

I got a solid if boring banana ice cream in a cup. It sums up JP licks for me - the ice cream is pretty good quality but the flavors are usually deathly boring save for the occasional gem (like cayenne chocolate) and it's not value either. For the former I'll go to Toscis and for the latter I'll be at Christina's.\\n\\nSo while I was stuck staring blankly at the tepid flavors board, wishing I was over at Berryline instead of attempting this failed first to review, I did notice the wonderful interior design of this store.... green fake plastic grass all up the walls, wonderful spherical lightshades and eccentric framed art. It's a pretty stunning set-up, and with nice wide windows and some patio seating - they've got themselves a great spot. It's between Gnomon Copy and Leavitt and Pierce, close to where Mr Toscanini failed so miserably at accounting and tax a year before. How anyone could fail at ice cream selling at this location is beyond me.\\n\\nI think this will signal the beginning of the end for the lowly Herrel's round the corner and the stale Baskin Robbins in the Dunkin a bit further along.

Great place to take the kids while me and the wife had a drink and a nice dinner.  But ever since they expanded the bar area and (more importantly) changed their menu (about 1 1/2 years ago), they've been headed downhill.

The menu is now a much smaller, generic \\"American bar\\" menu, unlike the old menu, which was much larger and more \\"Irish pub\\".  No Irish pub should be serving Fajitas. And I'm sick of restaurants that serve Fried Calamari that are comprised of 60% peppers. Service is spotty - sometimes we get a great server, sometimes not.  And the hostess is unfriendly with a big frown on her face most of the time.

Many have tried - and failed - in this location (maybe the early departure by a generally well-accepted chain should provide clues to future proprietors!)\\n\\nThe new tenants have swiped a little 'lipstick on the pig', but it remains with much same layout and furnishings apparently left by earlier restaurant entrepreneurs. \\n\\nSpeaking if Pigs . . . A member of our party opted for the Atlantic Coast Line Pork Chop (actually two 1\\" thick chops) which the waiter specified would be served medium rare. Now I know pork preparation has come a long way in recent  years and it is no longer deemed necessary to cook a hunk'o pig until it is tough & dry throughout - But this poor chop was just short 'oinking' at the touch of a fork! Avoiding the extremely rare (cool pink) areas nearest the bone meant leaving about half the entree on the plate.\\n\\nFlat breads are your typical industrial restaurant food service doughy lavash with various toppings. Not a bad deal for bar snacking at happy-hour pricing, though certainly nothing special.\\n\\nThe Shellfish Griddle Cakes appetizer were anything but . . . A fair portion of fishy cakes accompanied with a tart, semi-spicey Cajun Tartar Sauce that did all it could to masque the overt fishy-ness of the fried marine-something patties.\\n\\nA bowl of Shanty Irish Stout Beef Stew proved to be quite satisfying to the appetite, if not the eye. While the portion 'looked' smallish it was rich and completely filling for this hungry patron.\\n\\nOn another visit, I and a friend each had the Grilled Flatiron Steak. To glance at the plates you would never know we ordered the same menu item! I realize that each Flatiron steak cut is, by nature, unique to some degree - But one was small, tough and dry and the other one of fair size and cooked properly. Both were ordered to grilled to a medium temperature.\\n\\nMost entrees are served with a joke of salad. A few pieces of over-the-hill lettuce and couple of grape tomatoes flung sadly on a salad plate. C'mon kitchen, maybe you should un-bag the lettuce mix and freshen the leaves prior to plating! A good salad is appreciated by most - Too bad this one lost it's appreciation before landing on my table.\\n\\nService is eager, if untrained in traditional restaurant service. Far too much reaching across the table in front of patrons, lack of product familiarity of menu items and most important - Most waitstaff wore unclean white aprons (over jeans) on both visits. Surely a restaurant that puts staff in white aprons has a stock of clean garments ready at all times? I'm not talking about a finger smudge here & there, but down-right DIRTY as if working the line in the kitchen before dinner service. Not pretty or professional.\\n\\nTommy Addison's will suffice as a neighborhood eatery providing a solid meal at a decent price, but do not mistake this to be a 'better evening' dining destination by any means.

The great food was why we went back. And the service was great the first time, when we went for my fiance's graduation last year.\\n\\nBut this time... we had two servers originally assigned to us, I guess. They did OK bringing drinks and whatnot early on, but as the night went on, they were doing more flirting with each other than taking care of us. It took forever to get the check, and several members of our party left. I'm pretty convinced we could have walked out without paying, and no one would have noticed or stopped us. We didn't do that because who does that (right?), but it was indicative of how inattentive the service really became. I mean, we only got to finish our bottle of wine because my fiance specifically asked the guy to come finish pouring it -- I'd assumed we'd killed it because it had been nearly an hour since the guy had been by to top me off. Imagine my surprise when there was a whole glass left.\\n\\nBut OK, when we complained to the manager, the manager dealt with it graciously enough and comped our desserts, which was nice of him, but it still took forever for the server (we were down to one at this point) to bring the bill.\\n\\nAfter that, as we went outside, we asked the valet folks to hail us a cab. Almost immediately, a minivan pulls up at the curb, and the valet starts trying to usher us in. I said, \\"Um, is this a cab?\\" The valet said, \\"Oh, he's got his hack license -- and livery plates!\\" My dad is not from Boston and wasn't paying attention, and he started to get in. The valet said, \\"Oh, and he only takes cash.\\" I said, \\"Dad, you heard that, right? He only takes cash?\\" hoping my dad would get the message. Nope. So I suppose it's my fault for not stopping things right there... but suffice it to say (because my review of the odyssey home doesn't belong here) that I expect MUCH better from what purports to be one of the nicest steakhouses in Boston. Your customers won't come back if they have harrowing and potentially deadly rides home.\\n\\nWhen we called the restaurant back to complain about what had happened and warn them that their valets were putting customers in a gypsy cab, and honestly, we felt blown off. The restaurant said, \\"Oh, that's the valet company -- they're separate from us.\\" Right. But again, your customers deserve better, and it reflects REALLY POORLY on you as a restaurant.\\n\\nI can't say I'd be excited to go back. Which is a shame.

My advice, lower your price if you're gonna serve subpar food, with extra cheap ingredients.   I will never step in that place again.

Nud Pob reopened after a much to long relocation from a few strore fronts down the street.  While it's probably hard to be too nostalgic for the old place given how cramped it was, price did go up after the move and for some reason the pad thai never tasted the same.  still, there was something about the cramped, gritty former locale that made it seem somehow more authentic.\\n\\nThe pad thai is good.  But this is obviously a staple of Thai-American cuisine and something pretty hard to really f-up.  That said, a lot of people complain that the pad thai is too sweet or has too much vinegar in it.  The criticism is valid, but definitely no deal breaker.  \\n\\nAfter going there a few times I started just ordering random stuff off the menu without really trying to figure out what I was getting.  I never ate anything I hated and this led to some nice discoveries.  The korean rice, for example, was a real surprise treat.  This actually ended up becoming my go-to dish for a long time.  I like it w/ the shrimp personally, but really it's fine with any of the meats.  It comes with a fried egg on top.  nice.  That may not sound good, but once you break the yolk, it mixes really well with the fried rice.  It's kind of like getting lunch and breakfast in the same meal.  \\n\\nThe pad see you w/ duck is awesome.  It's a little mroe $, but worht it I think.    \\n\\nThere's some kind of odd sex theme going on with all the seafood items: shrimps in love, Seafood Honeymoon, Phuket Seafood (assumign you pronounce it wrong) and Squid Prik (pow).

I would often stretch a single order out over two meals.\\n\\nThe place can get crowded during lunch and the line doesn't move fast.

There's plenty of seating usually once you do get your food, however.  \\n\\nThey always place a plate of food in the small foyer coming in.

Words cannot express how much I enjoyed staying here for nearly a week. \\nThe rooms are absolutely gorgeous, the bed the most comfortable thing I have ever slept on in my entire life, the balcony had an amazing view, the bathroom spectacular with a rain shower that was so relaxing. I loved the food there as well they have a breakfast buffet which we hit up more times than not, they had a station where a cook made fresh for you the most amazing Belgium waffle I've ever had and  one of the beat selections ever from typical things like scrambled eggs and bacon to an amazing cheese and meat display. The waitstaff at the buffet were the most friendly and warm people... No matter how busy the always were around when needed. But unfortunately the same cant be said for the other guests who acted like they had never saw food before, this was definitely a wait your turn move down the line very classy style of buffet, yet I really felt like slapping some of these people and teaching them some manners. I had a man literally nearly knock me over and smashed my plate against my shirt (not cool) because he wanted to get to the scramlbed eggs before me. I had another man snatch up the fork thing for the ham right as my hand was inches above it, not to mention on one busy day there were tons of people waiting all infront of the desk area since my sister is in a wheel chair and my daughter in her stroller we were sitting in the tables on the main level not the dropped down area so we had to walk past the desk to get to the buffet. So since my fianc√© and father eat in 3 seconds to go have ciggys outside my mom and I are left with my sister and my baby, I have to go up twice once for me once for my mom. So with a million other places to stand this brawd stands right im the only walkway and even though she can clearly see she's in the way and I've had to say excuse me 3 times now (up, back, up,) on my way back I say excuse me she has the nerve to roll her eyes and ughhh. Really? Seriously? I wanted to dump my eggs on her head for real. But anywho I didn't because they were delicious and I knew it so I just said \\"your in the way of everyone\\" and with a shocked face she said sorry and looked like she realized she almost got fed To the alligators that live outside :)  ok so  also I  a night owl so I ordered room service a couple times and omg my new favorite sandwich ever by far is this turkey Sandwich with a fried egg on it not something I would typically eat but I tried it planning on taking off the egg and was pleasantly surprised to find out it was soooooo freaking good I ate it almost once a day. (btw there was this amazing sauce that I got one of the nights from room service it wasn't the wasabi ranch cause I tried it the next night but it was something green and amazing anyone know what it was?) so my parents practically call this place their second home they bring my little sister and just lay by the pool and relax so they ALWAYS sit in a certain waitress' section ( I think her name is Vonda super tan super cool) they constantly talk about the amazing pi√±a coladas so of course I try one and WOW whatever rum it was I asked And forgot was honestly the best drink I have ever ever ever had and boy was she quick when we needed refills! Not Ro mention almost half the staff knew my dads name everywhere we went I heard someone say oh hi Mr. Malloy! Awesome.

While we had ours to go, I saw others have theirs at the restaurant; I think it would be nice to have some kind of accoutrements (chocolate/caramel drizzle, ice cream, or fresh fruit), as it was really just a piece of cake on a plate otherwise. \\n\\nService - Jay & Blake (the proprietors) were very passionate about the restaurant & food, which is what pushed my rating from a 3 to a 4.  I like supporting local establishments, and you could tell how much they cared for the place, and how much they appreciated their customers.  Jay was our waiter, and he was very attentive to our needs, and made great recommendations.  There were a few food-prep missteps, but nothing that ruined the meal.  It would have been nice to have someone tell us which cheeses (on the cheese plate) were which (more of a note to staff, should they be reading this).\\n\\nFood Quantity - The rib-eye was huge.  My wife's burger was decently sized.  Salads were a bit small.  Cheese plate was a good size.  Wine pour was good.\\n\\nFood Quality - That's what they pride themselves on.  Everything was good, very fresh.\\n\\nAmbiance - Everything was simple and neat, with a bit of a hipster vibe.  I felt there was good space between the tables, so we weren't right on top of each other (which is something I value).  The chairs could use a bit more cushion.  It was a brisk (i.e. cold) night out, and they left the door open, and our table happened to be closer to the front, so it was a bit chilly. \\n\\nPrice - We had a discount voucher, which brought the cost of our meal down.  The steak was $30, which is a bit steep, but it was a good sized portion (18oz).  I think if they offered a smaller cut for a bit less, that may draw more customers to it.  This was also the most expensive option on the menu.  Everything seemed reasonably priced, with most entrees under $20. \\n\\nAs mentioned above, there were a few minor hiccups, but nothing tremendous.  The staff is very friendly/welcoming, and passionate.  It's a nice place, and I'd definitely recommend giving them a try if you're in the area."},{"name":"The Waffle Window","address":"4708 NW Bethany Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This location is now PERMANENTLY CLOSED as of Labor Day!

Their outdoor patio is good in the Summer, Spring and even parts of the Fall when they wip out their wood burning stove! I've had a book club meeting upstairs, a meeting of old friends downstairs and a girls night on the patio all good times. Their taps are cheap at $5.50 a cup, who can go wrong with some Brooklyn Lager for $5.50. This is of course coming from a NYer (don't judge me). The staff is pretty friendly and they always have a descent group of people. It's a lil less divey that most dive bars but the dim lighting and patio bathroom covered in bumper stickers and graffiti do it dive justice. You can get a mixed crowd in there - from Harvard students, to regulars, young professionals, international folks, and randos off the street. \\nLast night I tried their crab cakes for the first time - delish for only $10 and it includes cole slaw and fries on the side.

Burgers had just enough taste to them, ingredients tasted fresh.  Not sure if they did this on purpose or not but they put the beef and cheese on top of the condiments.  I like that because it prevents the bottom bun from getting hot and soggy from the grease.\\n\\nI knocked off one star for being a little dry and another star for being pricey.

Pretty kitschy with all types of nautical doo dads (I obvi don't know the words for those things) hanging form the walls and ceiling. You order at the counter, they write your name on a card (somehow this seems like such a waste, but anyways) and you find a seat. Specials are listed on the wall and also on fliers. You can also check out some of the selection in the deli-type case. \\n\\nI've been here twice, the first I ordered a special that I remember enjoying, but don't remember the details of. (sorry, kids). The second time I ordered a fish wrap. Similar components as the grouper sandwich in wrap form. But there was corn in the wrap, which won me over. Alas, I was pretty disappointed by the wrap. So bland. To the point that I took some of the tarter sauce from someone else's grouper sandwich and added it to the wrap. Maybe someone forgot to season it? Anyways, that was the reason for the downgrade. Also got the calamari again -- a soft, chewy consistency that I don't know if I love, but the breading/frying is oh so addicting. \\n\\nBottom line: the $6 grouper sandwich places on the coast might beat WPF Co.'s counterparts.

The shrimps, I guess, could be classified as \\"fresh and local\\" in a \\"defrosted from Safeway\\" scenario.

I placed my order with a nice-enough seeming fellow who quickly turned prickly when I said I had a Yelp coupon for free coffee with a pastry purchase. He refused to honor the coupon and acted like he had no idea what I was talking about. So OK, no pastry or free coffee then. Just two sandwiches for nearly $20. I waited. And waited. And waited. Ten minutes, twenty minutes, the place wasn't super busy but then people who had ordered after me were getting their sandwiches.

The menu was also pretty large and all very comfort food/Southern kitchen oriented.  I had a biscuit with scrambled eggs, chicken sausage gravy, and of course their much advertised grits.  Biscuits and eggs are pretty basic so I won't waste time reviewing these. The gravy was really thick and very flavorful, this is gravy the way you imagine the south does gravy! And finally the grits. I will admit as a born and raised northerner I don't know much about grits and this may be the 3rd time I've ever had them. As the old saying goes 3rd time was the charm and The Flying Biscuit's grits were so good I almost didn't mind eating runny corn-mush.

I am a bit of a snob when it comes to sushi, only because I know what I like, and I have had it enough to know what's fresh and what isn't. \\n\\nMy experience was simply...meh.\\n\\nFood/Drink:\\n\\nI ordered a \\"Blushing Samurai\\" martini. The description on their menu says that it's made with Absolute Citron, Pomegranate liquor, lemonade, and soda. I didn't taste any of those in the martini I ordered. I shrugged it off and still drank it. I wonder if my server put in the wrong order or something? It tasted like a very weak watermelon martini, lol. Was only 4 dollars with their happy hour so I didn't mind.\\n\\nThey give out complimentary edamame. Mine tasted like it had been steaming/boiling for an hour and was ridiculously over-salted. Again, I really don't mind considering the fact that it was free.. but if you're going to serve it you should at least keep in mind when using condiments that people are going to be eating it.\\n\\nAnyway, I started with an Age Tofu appetizer. The portion was huge for only 4.95, which would have been lovely had I ordered it as a meal and not an appetizer.. I ended up not even getting 1/4 through it by the time my food came. Ended up leaving it behind, too. They put the tofu on the side and don't have it sitting in the sauce which is different from other places I've been to. I liked that. My issue with the tofu was that it didn't spend enough time in the fryer and so it was a bit doughy since the batter had not been cooked through. Otherwise good value/size.\\n\\nFor my main meal, I tried the Pyramid of Egypt Roll and the Mango Roll for sushi this time around. I don't know what it is about this place but the fish, rice and vegetables taste abnormally bland and in some cases.. dry? If it weren't for the sauces they put on top I would've had trouble eating it.. this is coming from someone who enjoys simple sushi and sashimi as well, so I don't think my pallet is to blame. I liked the Mango Roll the best out of the two, despite the frequent suggestions on here and other sites to try the Pyramid of Egypt.\\n\\nMy bill was only about 24 dollars which is a really good deal considering I got two specialty rolls, a cocktail, and two appetizers (if you count the edamame).\\n\\nService/Atmosphere:\\n\\nI don't really know where to begin with this one. Their patio is small and quite nice actually. The only thing that I didn't like about it was that I could see my server watching me the ENTIRE time I ate through the half-a**ed black-dimmed door/windows. I'm not sure if they realize this.. but the people sitting outside can still see you! And it's frankly really creepy and unnerving to have somebody glaring at you your entire meal.\\n\\nWhen I ate there last time it was inside. The restaurant may be new but  the floors are rough/scratched up. Not really sure what they were going for with that one. The waitress that served us last time was somewhat awkward and definitely RUDE. I don't even recall my server saying hello to us, or even smiling. I felt extremely rushed to finish my meal and get out. Server either brought me the wrong martini or the menu description is completely wrong. I should also mention that everything came out at once... It was overwhelming. They need to work a little bit more on food timing, in my opinion. I'm usually not picky but I had only taken one bite of my appetizer when my dinner came out.\\n\\nThe way I see it I have no reason to go there.. Even for the happy hour. The service was rude and awkward, and the food was mediocre at best. \\n\\nSorry Ronin, I really wanted to like you as you are conveniently located near my home, but 2 stars is honestly pushing it. I would rather drive the extra 15-20 minutes and pay full price at my usual sushi restaurant than go back for your happy hour :(."},{"name":"The Old Spaghetti Factory","address":"10425 NE Tanasbourne Dr","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"3","text":"I placed a to go order tonight for two simple dishes.

I enjoyed the natural french fries (not usually a fry girl), and the cole slaw received the seal-of-approval from my southern-Ohio family. They said that the slaw was based on the original KFC recipe. Alas, we came at the tail end of the day and that cake was all gone! \\n\\nAnd if you're not a fish freak, don't worry! We ordered a shrimp plate to share, and the hot fish marinade went realllllllly well with it. That might become my regular thing.\\n\\nTo top it off, the service was outstanding. It's a family run joint and everyone was doing their part to make sure that customers felt welcome.

I thought all the components of the cassoulet were salty, but other than that, there wasn't anything wrong with the food. My dining companion said that the sausages were made in-house, and he enjoyed the sausage, but me..not so much. While I can't pinpoint anything WRONG with what we tried (other than the saltiness I mentioned), I can't really say anything positive about it either. It was just OK, which is surprising and a little sad because I was rather hungry when we came into the restaurant. \\nI would say that this is a slightly upscale family restaurant. You could easily bring a date here, but I noticed that there were families with (very) young children here also. I'm talking babies in carseats. \\nI feel a little bad about writing a mediocre review because our server was so nice! Never rushed us and was just the right level of attentive, with a cute accent to boot!

The parking lot is always empty, yet the place still remains open. Having long ago convinced myself that it was some type of illicit trade front, I finally decided to give it a try. I have watched more than my fair share of Lifetime Originals and didn't want the delivery order to unassumingly turn into a \\"me love you long time\\" scenario at my doorstep; accordingly, I opted for take-out. After completing the relatively easy online ordering process, I received a confirmation e-mail that the food would be ready in 10 minutes - talk about fast food, my friends. I immediately headed over to the restaurant, and to my surprise, the order was ready, accurate, and hot upon arrival.\\n\\nFood: The menu at Mandarin Palace is typical Americanized Chinese, so don't expect anything too culinarily exhilarating. I opted for the steamed pork dumplings for an appetizer, which were sizable and hot, but somewhat soggy and bland. For an entree, I had the Sesame Chicken and my partner had the General Tso's Chicken. I generally order the Sesame Chicken as a standard that can be compared to other Chinese restaurants. That being said, their Sesame Chicken really isn't all that great; the meat was tough, the broccoli was wilted, and the sauce was less than stimulating. All--in-all, the food was OK for a Chinese delivery place, but it doesn't even touch the quality of the many options on Buford Highway. Also, the portions were large and could easily be separated into two or three meals.\\n\\nService: As I alluded to before, service was extremely quick and the online ordering process was simple to navigate.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Dark, quiet, and scary. Pick-up your food and remember where the door is.\\n\\nCost: Inexpensive and commensurate with most Chinese takeout locations. The cost of appetizers are $5 and entrees are around $9.50. All entrees come with complimentary rice, fortune cookies, and duck sauce. They also give you plastic forks, which was a surprising deviation from the traditional chopsticks. I subsequently convinced myself that I must have been a victim of Chinese food profiling; any individual who orders the sesame chicken with a last name like mine clearly would not be able to operate chopsticks.\\n\\nOther: Upon picking up my order, I finally realized why the parking lot of this place is always empty. It turns out they are only open for dine-in during lunch (11AM - 3PM) and offer delivery and takeout the remainder of the time. Since I rarely drive by during the lunch hour, this explains the recurrently empty parking lot."},{"name":"Gunshow","address":"924 Garrett St, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Gunshow was everything and more!

The bus boy is also a fantastic person. He will get you water refills almost immediately. And since I am part camel, this comes in handy. I had the eggplant without cheese and it was delicious. They had a special with chopped egplant last time I was here and I cross my fingers they bring it back. Still my favorite place in the city hands down!"},{"name":"North End Pub","address":"3011 N Lombard Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"Previous comments are correct about the atmosphere.  But I'm a big advocate for giving these guys a shot.  \\n\\nEach time I've had dinner here the food is homemade and really tasty (one night they whipped up terrific chicken and dumplings that clearly was scratch-made).  Pizzas are also good -- not gutbomb greasy like Toms (which I also like) but filling too.  I think the potato chips that come with sammies are also homemade.\\n\\nBrunch is fantastic.  They serve the best biscuits and gravy I've had in Portland (Gravy on Mississippi is a close second).  I'm told it's the chef's gramma's recipe, and I'd believe it. Their sweet crepes are terrific -- fruit filled depending on the season.  French toast is outstanding too, and o-my, the food portions are huge.  It's not a Portland \\"go out to brunch and be seen place\\" like on Alberta or in SE.  But if you want terrific food, a place for your kids to run around while you eat and have a conversation with friends, try it.\\n\\nAND.  They're finally releasing their own brews, and the three I've tried are great.  Yep, their quantities are limited, but they are trying to keep up with demand as they get ramped up.  The brewer guy actually gave us a taster of something he was just kegging so we could try it.  So, good customer service.  I really dug their Helles beer last week.  Fresh, clean, springy.  Yum.\\n\\nIt's a great spot, despite its decor, and definitely a huge improvement to the neighborhood.  Try it out and give them some biz.  We need this kind of brewpub on Lombard."},{"name":"Outback Steakhouse","address":"11600 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"This continues to be a favorite pit stop for me.

Each order has 2 tacos. They're HUGE and stuffed full of delicious veggies, gorgeous dressing, amazingly cooked and seasoned fish of all kinds. Every bite is a mouthgasm. \\n\\nI also love how this place is a hole in the wall. The seating inside the bar is for 21+ so if you have kids or underage people with you, you'll have to resort to finding the softest piece of pavement or eat standing up. But I like the feeling of eating while standing, so to me, it actually adds to the attractiveness of this place. The people who work here are also really nice and fun to talk to.\\n\\nHowever... Halfway through one taco I realized how thirsty I was. The fish is very salty. It works relatively well in balance with everything but the more you eat the more you notice it. It almost became distracting to me. If you're sensitive to saltiness I would reconsider. I got the fish blackened so maybe this isn't a problem with the other cooking styles. Also, the tacos also upset my stomach. I don't quite know why; it's not like I have a sensitive stomach.\\n\\nNevertheless every time I think about this place I drool a little.

Sometimes they have weird flavors like noodle kuedle or something which actually had noodles... Mm, not my cup of tea.\\n\\nSince their stores are around Harvard Sq. and Brigham's circle they're pretty convenient if you're in the area. There's one in Back bay now too so cheers to that.

Food came by fast, we were fed right the way after we sat. Bottomless side orders but no grilled pineapple like most Brazilian grill places. The female bathroom stinked and was out of toilet paper and toilet seat covers. The waiter we had was a bit absent minded, he kept walking by our table aimlessly, but doesn't actually see us looking and waiving at him, it was rather odd, took us a long time to get his attention to bring us the check.

Sadly, this lovely little place has aspirations that fall short. The scallop appetizer is presented with only 3 scallops, but unlike places like Serrato, they are the medium sized grocery scallops dressed with an overly sweet sauce.  They were only slightly overcooked, which was understandable with the small size and the celeriac mash was fine with them.  I give them points for drying the scallops before searing them so they weren't rubbery. The house wines are not a great choice, but the waitress gave good guidance.  My trout was really delicious and I would come again based on that- though it was a little bony at the edges.  The brussel sprouts were perfectly cooked. Unfortunately, my husband really disliked his gnocchi with veal which came overwhelmed by a buttery/greasy sauce. He did get the small size, which was truly tiny so maybe the larger size (which my trout was) would have been better proportioned.  Food comes under salted, which is fine with me.  You can always add more, but you can't take it away.The waitress was great and the place has a delightful atmosphere.

It was also nice that we got seated by the window overlooking France. As with Disney, the staff are incredibly nice, and everyone seemed to have a French accent. It definitely added to the experience!\\n\\nThe food here is a little overpriced, but this is expected since it's inside a Disney amusement park. Even with this price, the food was enjoyable and it was nice to have a quiet dinner among the hustle and bustle of the parks.\\n\\n+ESCARGOT: Can't remember the exact name of this dish but it was quite good. It came in this thin crispy bread cup (that just seemed for decoration). The escargot itself was nice and tender and there was a good bacon and smokey flavor to the dish. Went really well together!\\n+BAR NOIR ECAILLES DE POMMES DE TERRE: This is the sea bass with potato scales. It had a great crispiness which contrasted with the soft flaky fish. It went well with the sauce! The spinach seemed a little unnecessary though since it came separately in a cup.\\n+LA SPHERE: This dish is both beautifully presented and tasted great. It was really cool to watch the sphere melt and there are little crisps at the bottom which added some needed texture. Overall great and not too sweet tasting since I'm not always a fan of chocolate desserts. (The waiter pours over the warm melted chocolate and he was really open about us taking a video.)\\n-DUCK BREAST: Our dish seemed to vary a little from what's on the menu due to it being the holiday season. It came on top of a slice of gingerbread that we didn't really care for. We were also asked if we wanted the skin crispy but it was not delivered. Otherwise, the flavors were pretty tasty.\\n-SOUP AUX TRUFFES VGE: This was overpriced for us for what it was. It tasted like a strong vegetable soup but there wasn't a strong truffle flavor to me. The puff pastry was nice though. Would probably skip this unless you're really into soups.\\n\\nAlong with the food, our waiter came around with a bread basket. I particularly liked the parmesan bread. They're also pretty prompt about refilling your bread if your bread plate is empty. The service here is impeccable, making sure our table was clean and trading out our appropriate utensils.\\n\\nOverall, the food and service was quite good. The atmosphere was, of course, amazing and I appreciated the time and effort of the staff.

So as we were driving around starving, the bright lights of Full Moon Thai lured us in. There wasn't a single person in there, which made me a little nervous. With so many Thai places in Portland, I thought this place was going to be another \\"meh\\" on my list. \\n\\nWe ordered the basics, chicken pad thai and chicken yellow curry. Easy dishes to determine if i want to be a little more adventurous next time around (if there would be one). The pad thai was actually really good. Not overly sweet like most places have become in Portland and the curry was great. Potatoes were actually cooked all the way through without being mushy. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered yellow curry and end up with a bowl of hard, uncooked potatoes. Gross. This place though, pretty damn good. Good heat levels, good flavor and everything that should have been fresh and crispy, was. Everything that should have been stewed and soft, was. We also got their combo appetizer with chicken satay, fried wontons and egg rolls. All was good, too. Egg rolls were a little boring, but the chicken satay made up for it. It came out fairly quick and piping hot. I like this place. Better than a lot of the Thai places on Alberta, which is closer to home. This location doesn't have the best history with restaurants staying around long, but hopefully this place will put down some roots. I'll definitely be back."},{"name":"Golden Temple","address":"1651 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"This is another great local restaurant in my hood. You can always get a table!

My bf and I did not make any reservations, so we wrote down our names and strolled in Chinatown for an hour before returning.\\n\\nWe ordered the Beef Noodle Soup, Butter Beef, Garlic Prawns, and also the Filet Beef Luc Lac on Fried Rice. The pho broth actually tasted like its been simmering for a while due to the rich and intense beef flavor. I wasn't dying of thirst after drinking a couple spoonfuls, so I knew it wasn't MSG-laden. Butter beef did not disappoint but I don't understand its name since there's no butter in the dish. It's like an Asian carpaccio that's mixed in a very acidic ponzu-like sauce. It's totally addicting. Garlic Prawns were good because it was so garlicky, but I wish they would peel the shells. I know I am supposed to eat the shells since it's already deep fried, but I prefer not to. Filet Beef Luc Lac and the fried rice were the most ordinary dish we ordered and we can definitely do without it.\\n\\nOverall, Phnom Penh was a good experience just because it's so highly rated and some of the dishes we ordered were pretty memorable.

You actually do not order from a menu. One of the many chefs will bring out food starting with appetizers then entrees followed by desserts. They explain the  food to you and how it is prepared.

Parking. They do not have valet nor a parking lot. Spots were easy to find on the street. It is also extremely loud in the restaurant which we could stand as the food was that good. Also they use these clamps to put tables together. For tall people watch your knees. And last but not least cost. Most items that you order are small plates that you share. So you are ordering a lot.

I ordered the combination for 2 which included tamarind soup with choice of Shrimps or Catfish , claypot with cat fish or meat and vegetables. I emphasized Soup with Shrimps and clay pot with cat fish, I got the opposite order, clay pot with pork and soup with cat fish. Sad, I did order in Vietnamese because I wanted my order to be right, but it wasn't. I didn't want to cause a scene so I just ate them. The young waitress who had been working there every time I come wasn't \\"fit\\" for the job for sure. She is beautiful but grumpy.

There were not enough seats on the inside to accommodate us, so we sat outside. I got the impression that they get a little overwhelmed kind of quickly -- a couple seats we wanted were still occupied by used plates, etc, which didn't get cleaned up for a little bit. It definitely gives off an understaffed vibe, which will hopefully be rectified in the future.\\n\\nHowever, the food more than makes up for it. It took us about 15-20 minutes for us to get served -- we ordered the grouper cheeks, and they were heavenly. They're cooked in a little parchment bag with some peppers and either oil or butter, but they manage to maintain a very light consistency. The portions are kind of small, but I thoroughly enjoyed the meal. We also had a bowl of lobster bisque but found the texture to be more like lobster chowder than a nice, smooth creamy bisque -- it tasted fine for a chowder, though.\\n\\nThis seems to be a good place for lunch -- I don't know if the menus change between either, but I'd never try to grab dinner there knowing the size of it and its growing popularity.

I rarely order the same thing during successive visits; however, some of my favorites include the sugar-sprinkled biscuits with cranberry apple butter and the luxuriously \\"creamy dreamy grits\\". The restaurant also serves dinner, but I haven't yet had the opportunity to try any of the offerings.\\n\\nService: Although I have experienced isolated moments of competence here, the service is generally slow and impersonal. The wait times for a table can easily exceed an hour on weekends, so the staff are typically more concerned with turning over the seats instead of ensuring a pleasurable dining experience.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Loud, cramped, and sterile. Although this location was only the second installation of the Flying Biscuit franchise, it still lacks much of the charm of the original restaurant in Candler Park. The clientele is typically mixed, but predominately comprised of local Midtown residents. \\n\\nCost: Inexpensive. The vast majority of breakfast entrees range in price between $5 and $10, while lunch and dinner offerings are in the $10 to $15 range. \\n\\nOther: Hours of operation are 7AM-10PM daily.

What a mix of foods with international flair!  There's an Asian dish, a Cajun dish, an African dish and of course some American dishes.  On my visit, I had the Portobello Burger with Basil Pesto and Pepper-Jack Cheddar Sauce.  It was a good sized sandwich - not overly filling, but large enough.  Plus, you get a choice of side, of which I chose the mac and cheese which was great.  My wife ordered the Cajun Alfredo Shrimp & Andouille Sausage on Toasted Ciabatta with a side of sweet potato tater tots.  The tots were like nothing we have ever had before - why don't they sell these frozen in the supermarket freezer aisle!  What a great side dish!  She was a little disappointed that the bread was not Ciabatta, but otherwise sandwich was good.  They also sell this as a main entree with mango sauce over rice.  There were about five dessert options.  I guess a lot of people like the Hummingbird cake, but we had the Creamy Banana Pudding with Pepperidge Farm Shortbread Cookies....really good.  \\n\\nDrink: they have a nice wine list, although you have to be willing to spend about $7-8 per glass. Good selection of international beers too...for example Tusker (from Kenya) is one of my favorites. \\n\\nAmbiance: when you enter, there is a long room with booths on the wall and tables mixed throughout.  There is a second adjoining room (there are two storefronts joined together) which has a bunch of paintings and artwork on the walls for sale.  Tables throughout.  Definitely plenty of seating.  I would say the restaurant was about 1/2 full when I was there.\\n\\nService: good overall.  Waiter wasn't necessarily warm and friendly, but we didn't feel neglected.  \\n\\nPrices: this is one of Isabella's biggest negatives...in my opinion, it is a little pricey.  A burger is $9-10, which may be comparable to many other places.  Black beans over rice is $11.  The dinner menu is the same as the lunch menu with the same prices - so you will never see me there for lunch.  Also shocking, the appetizers are all $9 or more!  Hummus with pita bread is the same price as a burger - $9.  They really need to work on this if they are going to be sustainable!  \\n\\nI have spoken to several people who recently visited Isabella's because they had a Scoutmob 50% coupon, as did I...well worth it!

I tasted a few of the paired wines that my friend got with his meal, which were also really good and well paired. \\n\\nI had the Granata(?) martini, and my friend got an Edelwiess to start out the meal. We both re-uped on Granadas(?) after our first round. Probably cause of the familiar aftertaste of kool-aid, but it was worth the 11 bucks or whatever they cost. \\n\\nFantastic evening, though the rest of the crowd was dressed up a lot more than we were, it was a fun evening, and we were not made to feel out of place, even when we went out mid-meal to smoke a cigarette. The atmosphere is pleasing as well. It's dimly lit, but you can still find your way to the bathroom with ease and see that they have several beers on tap across the room. The brown on brown is very appealing to my eye, not only was the warm temperature a relief from the \\"spring\\" we were \\"enjoying\\" outdoors, but it felt warm, in that it was comfortable as well."},{"name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","address":"6000 North Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Traveling in uniform for military training and decided to do dinner at Buffalo Wild Wings.

Although some of the pork tapas dishes were tasty, the others were disappointing.  The \\"jambalaya\\" was not flavorful, not authentic, nor innovative.  For a fistful of the jambalaya that has a couple of pieces of sausage and shrimp, $18 was way, way, over-rated.  As a matter of fact, you can have 3 of the tapas dishes, about $45-50, and still be hungry, both for sustenance and, on the night we were there, taste.\\n\\nThe dining space is too noisy.  The sterile space without much noise insulation allows the cacophony of conversations to echo in resonance.  You can have a conversation with someone next to you but not across from you.\\n\\nI think Gillespie has hit on a concept, as most reviewers have observed:  one that leaves you wishing for more food and yet makes it very difficult for you to track the tab.

Finally, the woman that had placed her order after me comes up also looking annoyed saying \\"you still haven't gotten your order?\\" clearly shocked at the slow service given the place was SO empty.. she goes up to them and says something. The guy they were talking to leaning on the pick-up station finally walks away. Miraculously as soon as he leaves they pull the next tickets from the machine and scoop my soup into bowls and I have it.. took maybe 2 minutes..  2 minutes of work that took a total of 26 MINUTES from the time I placed my order to when I got my food. And to top it off, zero apology or even recognition to the fact they weren't doing their job and conversing the entire time, ignoring the only two orders that were placed..  I get it, it's slow and you want to catch up with a friend, but do your job first and catch up when you have no orders to make!

Located next to the huge vein-streaked bulging bicep on Guadalupe, this hip wine bar serves up reds, whites and bubblies to your hearts content. The staff (in general) is well educated on the massive L-shaped rack of wines that dominate over a third of Vino Vino. The high ceilings and exposed beams add to the urban chic feel that has become common place in the Hyde Park region of Austin.\\n\\nWhile there are many things to rave about, there are some things that could be added to the ambiance. The space for seating is poorly allocated. The owners attempt to make an area where people can mingle, but some of the tables are large and uninviting. I would like to have a few  more intimate tables or couches. The back of the wine bar is adorned with a wire rack that houses various dry goods. In my opinion a waste of space. This area could be better served as a place for live music, or as a larger open seating area. While I have yet to see Vino Vino \\"packed\\" as popularity grows, space may become an issue. \\n\\nOverall, this is slowly becoming one of my favorite places in Austin, and a must see on those nights where good conversations among friends is the only objective. While I am by no means a wine expert (and consequently make no comments about the selection in my review), I am happy with the selection of Reds, Whites, Roses, and Sparkling Wines. The price range for wines is wide and can accommodate anyones budget. Add to the Vino Vino package the owners belief that a good wine can be enjoyed at a good price, you can easily see why Vino Vino  will be a popular choice for Austinites for years to come. \\n\\n~Fin"},{"name":"Victoria","address":"4835 N Albina Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Always 5 star.

A couple of brussels sprouts added some color and texture to the dish, while a pair of (caramelized?) apple slices didn't really seem to mesh with the rest of the plate.\\n\\nOn paper, a pork belly sandwich is pretty awesome idea.

We both started with a hot (cooked) mushroom soup that was not well seasoned except that there was too much cilantro. The little tiny crackers that came with it were very good but not enough and came with a veggie spread that had an underling oil taste that was not pleasant. Then I asked for a fresh juice and they only had one available that was actually fresh so I passed and had a green tea. the tea from the pot spilled quite a bit as I poured it into my cup. I ordered the Falafel wrap and it was ok but not impressive. I think my friend had the Gala Burger. She said it was just ok. We both had the fruit crepes for a sweet ending and both of us though it tasted like christmas cake. It also had pine nuts that tasted old. So onward .... I realize that Raw foods are a challenge and a bit of a new frontier but they had quite a selection of cookbooks or NON cookbooks , some of which I have and have made for my family much better food than this cafe had to offer.

The meat in the portions here are a lot more gratuitous than the other place I've been to (though I don't know if it's a lot of meat in general). I've never tried anything else on the menu.

All of us found the steaks too salty to finish and overdone. My medium came medium well and the guys' medium rares came close to medium well. For sides we had the creamed spinach and roasted mushrooms - nothing special. \\n\\nFor dessert we shared the Valrhona Chocolate Cake. The praline crumble was the nicest part about it, but it was extremely rich and sweet. We could not finish it despite sharing so it is a dessert I would only recommend for sharing, but even so, I would recommend trying another dessert on the menu and giving this a miss. \\n\\nOn the service end, we went on a Saturday night and this place was packed to the brim. However, I don't see that as a reason for service to be slightly lacking for a higher end restaurant. It was usually quite a chore getting a hold of our server, and he took quite long to serve us after we were seated. While he wasn't rude, he didn't come across as pleasant, but instead, indifferent. \\n\\nAfter this experience, I can safely say that Fleming's is a better steakhouse than Grill 23 & Bar.

I mean seriosly I could make this cheese plate at home in about 4 minutes for the price of $5.  We also got this beet dish that threw a few punches at my wallet.  It seriously looked like it was canned.  I mean, you could see the marks on the edges of the beats!  Then came the meal. The dreaded meal.  I decided to get a spaghetti ala puttanesca because it was a simple meal that didn't cost over $25.  ($18 to be exact). My dad, being his modest self got a cheeseburger and fries.

The short rib was cheesy and the hamburger was juicy. No wonder it's a local favorite. Service was quick. Place was clean.

For the area this is one of the more exciting places given their menu options and delivery style. This is not for everyone as we witnessed a couple next to us leave abruptly after a short stay. The restaurant opened around 2013 and gets its name from a favorite memory of Kevin with his dad. Reservations can be made about a month out via yelp and its highly recommended as spots get taken up quick. Each night there may be a different number of new aspiring chefs or regulars depending on their rotation The service is in the dim sum style where chefs parade prepared dishes for immediate consumption. This is probably logistically easier for the restaurant but does cause some minor adjustments to the diner. First, although its great to meet the hired chefs and their creation it does pose a conundrum for a people pleaser like myself to give rejection. Also, with the community tables its slightly awkward to have a dish presented a few feet away and then again at your spot. I've heard of complaints of food becoming cold during this presentation process but this was never the case in my visit. I did notice becoming full waiting for a sought after dish to arrive but our waiter was quick to ask about our progress and brought it out promptly. I appreciate being able to see the menu that way you can plan out your meal. Dim Sum is not my favorite experience but not something that would keep me from returning. \\nThe beverage department is run mostly from a cart which saunters around the table and also gives an immersive experience. I love sitting at a bar to watch drinks being made and this fulfilled this desire all from the comfort of my own table. The cocktails were well balanced and varied in preparation and ingredients. \\nThe atmosphere and energy in the room create excitement in experience for the guest and results for the chefs. Many dishes we tried were inventive and delicious. One favorite was an Indian curry inspired corn dog that looked like something from a carnival but tasted continents far from home. Also, a Maryland oyster which was laced with basil and a strawberry puree was so good I questioned my virgin oyster policy which typically means I only go raw which nothing added. Moving from DC recently I've been searching the area for a restaurant that creates non fleeting memories and challenges my palate.

The portions were small, the presentation lacking, and the flavors were something to be desired.  \\n\\nTo top off this horrendous evening, the restaurant refused to split the bill, which is something that no restaurant has ever done, especially when the bill is $1,000+. In fact, the server said and did everything possible to prevent us from doing so. The manager was just as rude as the server and offered zero solution to the problem. Instead of 14 happy customers, there are now 14 people that will never come to 4th and Swift again and will go out of their way to never recommend it to any of their friends or family."},{"name":"Babs","address":"814 Juniper St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Was looking for a place to eat for brunch close to our hotel, based on the good reviews we decided to try Babs out.

My mid-western sensibilities were pleased. \\n\\nI ordered the simplest burrito, bean and cheese, and was completely blown away.  Not only is the damn thing HUGE but it is so tasty.  The tortilla is soft yet firm enough to keep everything contained and the filling was piping hot.  There wasn't enough rice to completely drown out the rest of the ingredients but what was there was soft and fluffy.  I was hooked from the first visit and almost thought about deducting a star from the other burrito joints for not being Burrito Express.  Alas, I'm lazy so I won't.\\n\\nI am planning on branching out to other items but if their bean and cheese is any indication they will rock that too.

There are a group of chefs who prepare various dishes, then walk through the dining room offering their creation to the diners. The first dish was enough to convince this carnivore to be a vegetarian. We enjoyed a smoked oyster Rockefeller. It was amazing. Other highlights were smoked pork, salmon cake, oysters and spring risotto. The desserts were also off the charts. The icing on the cake, back to the carnivore for a moment. One of the chefs had presented a smoked pork dish to us, we immediately said yes, its pork. The chef said well if you like pork, I have something special for you. He returned a few minutes later with a rack of smoked Memphis style ribs. Even though we were only taking a few bites of each dish so we could try more dishes, my brother and I devoured the entire rack of ribs. My brother is a competitive bbq rib champion and the ribs certainly met his approval. The bonus to us was the ribs were not on the menu, and according to one of the chefs, we were the only group in the restaurant that night to receive ribs. We will definitely return to Gunshow again.

Luckily we got there right at 8:30 for our reservation because the restaurant had been dying out by then. Our server was nice, but absolutely terrible. At first, I figured he was new or maybe just having a bad day so I let it slide..but he really sucked. Our drinks took 20 mins to come out. Then we ordered appetizers which took about 20 mins. We got the beef tar tar (sp?) which was deliciou. Then we ordered a salad (standard), nothing special at all. The cornbread was good and moist, but I've had better.\\nWhen it came to our actual entrees, we had to wait ANOTHER 40 mins for our food. My husband and I both ordered steaks.

Mind you, it was a slow night. He never came out to check on us to refill any of our drinks or to see if our food was good. Finally after 10 mins, I had to get up and flag him down so that the chefs could recook my meat. After waiting for what seemed like another eternity,  I got my steak back and it wad dry and burnt and lacked flavor. Our dude never even apologized for taking a long time or for the steak. It was so bad that I needed A-1. At this point, you could tell I was pretty pissed off. I should've complained to the manager, but we were there for so long and had somewhere to go after... that I didn't even want to bother to deal with it. Our bill came out to $188 and some change and while we normally tip 20 percent or more depending on the service, we gave him only $30 because we were so mad, but looking back we were being pretty generous considering how bad everything was. We should've only given him $15. Yes, it was that bad. It was soo not worth it! Don't waste your time here. Its overpriced and the chefs and our server that night seemed like they came from Apple Bees. We should've gone to Portland City Grill instead.

We had a great time dining there but we were not able to finish our plates and so we had leftovers. My bros had a bit of their prime rib left and their sides. My fiance had left over prime rib and sides left too. So they asked for the waiter to pack them up. The funny, yet ridiculous thing was, we were SO happy with the service when we were there, we tipped our waitress pretty good BUT when we got home and opened up our leftover containers, he only packed up our meat and ALL and i mean ALL our sides were gone. The funny thing was, it looked ridiculous in the huge box that was given to us. I thought it was funny but my family was pretty upset about their delicious sides. My brother decided to call, just to let their management know, so other ppl won't come across with this situation. The manager there was very friendly and was very sorry about the situation and decided to write us a letter with a gift card attached.

The steaks were sorely lacking (tough and quite overpriced, especially compared to the competition or possibly mismarked), while much of the produce we passed up was withered or worse.  Still, the owner's friendly and kind manner won me over, as did his baked goods.  Um-umm!  So much like those from my grandmother's hands (in the Bronx) that I became an infrequent regular.  Then it was his milky-looking vanilla-y coconut drink and fresh cantaloupe juice.  And finally, seeing menus posted on the back wall, along with nicely arranged tables and chairs when ravenous, well, it was Say no more!  I found love at first bite delivered rapido and caliente.  This is genuine Mexican food (that even Mr. Haney would demolish and not leave a morsel over for Oliver or Lisa, price be darned).  Started with beef, ham and chicken tacos, and a chicken and corn  tamale, which came with homemade pico de gallo, soffrito, fresh cilantro and quartered limes.  All were perfectly wrapped, small and zesty, eliciting immediate ayayays and a yearning to try the tongue and barbacoa next time.  But I had to sample a chicken quesadilla, which was not quite as good but still gooood, followed by a beef burrito (a bit too salty for my lo-so leaning but, hey, it was huge and delicious even sans condiments).  The server was great, especially for her first day, and well rewarded.  Prices were good and we left stuffed.  We will definitely be back.  I just hope the owner and his family keep everything as-is, except for the meat and produce.  I suggest they keep the meat well-stocked so customers can see what's available when they walk in vs. empty trays, improve the quality of same, and that they eliminate the rotting veggies or lower the prices so some might consider them for sauces or soups.  Maybe someday they'll also feature fish and seafood.  Till then, another lunch is coming right up with desserts and beverages.

It's basically spaghetti and marinara inside cheesy garlic bread, with an option to add housemade meatballs (yeah, take that option!). Admittedly, it's a carbfest that the panda would have to prepare for. Gotta stuff a blanket in the back seat of the car for the impending food coma.\\n\\nThis time, I opted for the Flying Barracuda Pulled Pork sandwich ($8). The pork is slow roasted for 6-8 hours, then mixed with his business partner's Flying Barracuda honey BBQ sauce. Mo makes his own slaw, a runny mayo shredded cabbage concoction that possesses a slight vinegary kick. Generous portions of pulled pork and slaw are added to this healthy-sized sandwich roll. Mo gets all of his bread from An Xuyen almost every day (except Mondays, when the bakery's closed).\\n\\nFirst of all, this sandwich is absolute money. The pork was incredibly tender, tearing off with little to no effort and melting in my mouth. The crunchy slaw complements the pork and the BBQ sauce. I found it amazing that the bread held it all! I have no idea how An Xuyen makes their bread, but you can bet the farm that I'm heading there in the future. Amazingly soft bread, stretching to its maximum if need be to hold everything in.\\n\\nI told Mo that he'd probably have to give out forks for his sandwiches because it's such a bear to handle. You'll certainly be getting your money's worth here! I for one certainly didn't mind becoming one with the sandwich in public. And hey, isn't it an amusing spectacle to see a panda wrestle with a sandwich? Trust me, the panda wins every time.\\n\\nMo told me that you can also get a meatball sandwich for $8. I got to try a meatball sample -- of course, Mo makes his own -- and nodded in approval. Hearty, juicy, savory, and a bit of sweet from the tomato sauce. Extremely comforting.\\n\\nRespected people like Steven Shomler (Portland Food Cart Adventures) and Brett Burmeister (Food Carts Portland) have raved about Mo's Italian sandwich ($8). It's really a cart where you can't go wrong. Mo takes his handful of sandwich options and delivers on every single one. Best of all, you'll get your money's worth on the portion size. I think the only thing missing is a real spicy option.\\n\\nMo is a very nice guy, and I'm glad he's doing something that he has a passion for.

No more Jimmy John's for Lauren P.\\n\\nPlease fire your lunch manager. Any man who would come from behind the sandwich counter to tell me my piss-poor Veggie sandwich was made according to Jimmy John's standards should not be responsible for your products.\\n\\nLet me preface this by saying I've had a love affair with Jimmy John's for years. It started with your shop next to my dorm room. Once a week, in the wee hours of Athens, Ga., I'd come home after drinking for hours and Jimmy John's would still be ready for me at 3 a.m. Our college romance continued when I worked in an office atop the hill on Baxter Street during my years at UGA. Jimmy John's was my dinner choice at least once a week.\\n\\nNow in the real world, I've continued to dine at your stores around Atlanta. For the past few months I've often frequented your Vinings location. Your sandwiches have been stellar. Hell, last Friday, someone from your store team brought free sandwiches to our office! But on Monday, April 9, 2012, a gentleman, no, wait, there was nothing gentle about this man, officially ruined Jimmy John's for me.\\n\\nThe Veggie is my all-time favorite non-meat sandwich offering anywhere. Re: ANYWHERE U.S.A. I love the combination of sprouts, avocado, cucumber, tomatoes, and lettuce finished with cheese, mayo and mustard. But on this occasion, there were no sprouts -- granted there was a recall but its time to change your menu Jimmy John's. False advertising is a law suit waiting to happen. My avocado was slathered in between the cheese and there wasn't nearly enough of it. But what got me was the cucumbers. There are supposed to be 3 chunks of cucumbers on the sandwich and I only got 2 little bitty slices plus 1 decent slice of cucumber. \\n\\nWhen I showed my sandwich to the manager, he retorted that's how the sandwich was supposed to be made. On the contrary! There was more cheese and lettuce than anything else. When I showed him the puny slices of cucumber he continued to fight with me. Really? Are you counting your cucumber slices for margin? \\n\\nSo I said fine, you can read about this in my Yelp review, and went outside to try and enjoy my mediocre sandwich. When I came back in to throw my trash away, this man came out from behind the sandwich counter to continue hammering his point that he was correct in his techniques. Dude, I've had dozens of Veggies over the years and yours was the worst.

We ordered food and champagne and our waitress only came to take our order and didn't come back to even ask if we wanted more drinks or how the food was. He had to flag down another waitress just so he can get another drink after his glass was empty for about 15 min.. He ordered the steak and asked for it to be medium.. the steak came and it Definitely wasn't medium, but looked very rare to me.. he decided he didn't want to cause a fuss so he started eating it, had a few bites until he said to me \\"I really don't want to get sick from eating this\\" his steak looked completely raw.. I almost felt sick to my stomach just looking at it. He had to go find the waitress because like I said, she wasn't around and didn't even check on us once since we ordered. She came a few minutes later and he showed her the steak and told her that he feels bad for saying this, but that he didn't want to get sick from eating raw meat. She said \\"sorry about that, I can have them make you a new one\\" but  by then he had lost his appetite and just asked for the check... I assumed they would have taken his $40+ meal off the check, but she had charged him for half of the meal. He gave her the card and told her that he's been here 50+ times and that he was a bit surprised that she still had charged him for the meal...All she said was \\"sorry\\" and walked away, and STILL charged him for the raw meat they served him.. pretty upsetting that their $20+ charge for the meal, meant more to them than a customer who has spent so much money there.

When I took the food out of my bag and saw my wrapped cheeseburger, I thought I was given a kids meal portion by mistake. Come to find out, that was the regular size. I ate it slow, just to ration out my burger to the huge amount of French fries given with the combo. The fries were different, more like the shoe-string fries, but not bad, definitely not greasy. I agree with others that the burger needed a little more salt and pepper (and I rarely say that for any food.) I did like that you could get ketchup in a little cup instead of sitting there opening packet after packet while your food got cold. What concerned me though was that the ketchup was on a shelf outside in the 100' weather. Is that safe???? The meal was tasty, and the burger cooked pretty well. Unfortunately, I filled up on fries because the burger was so small. I would consider going back if in the area, but would definitely order the double meat so that I'd feel like I ate a meal and not a snack. The prices were reasonable, the soda was good with the nice small pieces of ice. I got the cookie, eehhh, a bit dry and floury (???) tasting, nothing great. I'd spend that $1 for the extra patty next time instead of the cookie. I have yet to find a really great tasting burger in ATX that I love. There's still no comparison to Chris Madrid's in SA.....but I'll keep looking.\\n\\nPros: Ice is great to chew on, burger not bad, better than most...especially Hut's\\n\\nCons: Give me a bigger burger, at least the avg 1/4 pounder"},{"name":"Yagoto Sushi Dining","address":"2180 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Best Sushi in the area.

Ellen recommended Capital Grille or Morton's, but Valerie wanted to try something neither of them had experienced before. Enter Grill 23. Even though it was a Sunday night, Valerie wanted to be sure they had a table so she made a reservation (which was simple to do online through open-table). The restaurant gave us a cozy table in one of the quieter sections of the restaurant (which was helpful because Eric's ADD was in control and away from the street-facing window).\\n\\nLike many of the other yelp-ers have written, this place does have a \\"gentlemen's club\\" type of feel. There is dark wood paneling, large tapestries, and scattered oil paintings.  The white table linens were pristine and it was nice to see them changed in between every seating (especially since Eric made a little bit of a mess when trying to share his steak with Valerie).   There wasn't any music, which was good because the high ceilings made even the quietest chatter from the table next to us loud.  \\n\\nOur waitress, Heather, came by a few minutes after we were seated.  She didn't introduce herself, which we found odd, and we had to get her name from the receipt.  She brought with her a basket full of amazing assorted breads and what tasted like homemade butter.  We quickly ordered two glasses of the pinot grigio (the wine list is literally over 30 pages long) while we decided which entrees we would be having.\\n\\nAfter narrowing down the options for entrees, we ordered a Caesar salad that we split before the main course. The salad was absolutely delicious, with a perfectly created caesar dressing and parmasean flakes sprinkled over the top of the salad. We quickly cleared our plates of the salad, and placed our order for our main course.\\n\\nWe decided to go with two different cuts of beef so that we might have a chance to taste the other's dish as well as our own. Eric chose to go with the twin filets, which amounted to about 8 oz. of meat, while Valerie chose the New York strip, which was 12 oz.. As a side, we ordered the mashed potatoes.\\n\\nWhile Valerie is agnostic, Eric had no issue with comparing the meal to the heavens. As he cut into his perfectly cooked (medium) filet, the tender meat melted over his tongue like butter. The meat was perfectly seared with a salty crust, and neither salt nor pepper needed to be added to supplement the delicious flavor cooked into the filet (for those of you who don't know Eric's relationship with salt...this says something). The mashed potatoes were equally as good. Eric described them as God having placed potato-flavored clouds into a bowl, and handed them to the chef at Grill 23. Valerie's steak was also cooked to perfection, although was charred a little bit too much in Eric's opinion. Both of the steaks were $35 each.\\n\\nThroughout the meal, our water glasses were meticulously refilled by one of the bus boys.  Eric found it refreshing that even when the staff didn't have tables to serve, they always found things to do instead of just standing around.  While we ate our dinner, we also had the opportunity to observe some of the other member of the waitstaff interact with their customers, all of whom were friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, particularly the expansive wine list.\\n\\nGrill 23 had a decent dessert menu, but we were both too full to indulge.  Heather quickly brought us our check (almost too quickly, Valerie still had a third of her glass of wine left) and we took off for the evening, passing the open kitchen and bread table on the way out, things we could not enjoy looking at from our seat in the corner.\\n\\nThe service here was very good.  Things came quickly and it seemed as though if we had questions about the menu items they could have been easily answered.  Our waitress, Heather, was cordial, but not the friendliest server we have ever encountered.  She appeared more open with a few of her other tables, and we think this may have been because we were two of the youngest patrons in the restaurant and weren't ordering a $200 bottle of wine. As much as we'd like to say the service wasn't what we expected, Heather was able to joke with Eric about the fact that every time she came to the table, Valerie's mouth was full of the delicious food.\\n\\nIn short...for a heavenly steak or a special occasion in the Back Bay, try out Grill 23!"},{"name":"JP Licks","address":"1312 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"As with any JPs, you get some nice homemade ice cream.

We won't be going back again.\\n\\nTo start with, everything at this place is quite overpriced. La Parilla, which is not necessarily the most amazing culinary experience, offers everything that Las Margaritas does, but does it all better, at a lower price. The plate that I got was reasonable (~$12 - $13), but simply wasn't worth it. The rice was mushy, the beans were extremely bland and the pork, although cooked to a nice enough texture, was pretty salty.\\n\\nIf you're going out for a few drinks, then I would suggest going somewhere else. Drinks are expensive - forking out nearly $20 for a margarita with a Corona is simply ridiculous, especially when the margarita mix comes from a bottle. Other places do the same thing for half the price.\\n\\nFinally, to echo some other reviews, the plates and silverware were dirty. Don't be surprised to see a lot of chips and an unappetizing brown color on the edge of your dishes.\\n\\nTo go back to value, you can do far better - for three mediocre plates and two drinks each, our bill ended up being $112.

Sat at the bar and everyone was very friendly.\\n\\nI ordered the whole wheat french toast with honey cream anglaise and raspberry compote. Side of potatoes and bacon. I also got the Iced Chai.\\n\\nFrench Toast was pretty standard, but the anglaise and compote combo really made it. Potatoes were potatoes (lol). Bacon was awesome as usual.\\n\\nMy iced chai was delicious. Really creamy and sweet. \\n\\nMid-way eating I forgot that the place was known for their biscuits. So I ordered one, and it came with a homemade cranberry apple butter. Very delicious. \\n\\nI'm not a biscuit guy really, but my expectations for a biscuit are that it has to have a crunchy/flaky exterior, and an almost creamy bread interior. These expectations were met. \\n\\nSo yeah, next time I'm in the ATL I'll definitely hit this spot up again."},{"name":"Sun in My Belly","address":"2161 College Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"DAMNNNNN been here for 2 hours and haven't had a morsel of food in my mouth... When we asked our waiter what in the hell was going on, he said \\"well, we have three rooms, and our whole kitchen staff is on today...\\" If ALL of your kitchen staff is at work, nothing should take 2 fucking hours. Especially not scrambled eggs and bacon. My advice? Take a room and make it a damn kitchen if you can't handle a simple weekend non-holiday brunch."},{"name":"El LOCAL Mexican Food","address":"231 SE Washington St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Unbelievably good food for super cheap (relative to the amount of food you get). I'm not kidding when I say that the burrito is the size of my face; I had to actually use a fork and knife to eat it.\\n\\nWe had the pork & guacamole burrito, which was packed with flavor and texture. Amazing. The two people working the cart looked like a father-daughter team and were a delight. \\n\\nThis is a definite must-try!"},{"name":"Pho Gia","address":"1944 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"So it tastes amazing... but the ONLY two times i've ever eaten there i have gotten ridiculously sick."},{"name":"Salts Restaurant","address":"798 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"This French restaurant is super good.

Even the buffet was always clean and had a great selection of options to meet anyones dietary restrictions expectations . Service at the front bar was lacking so much we declined a sad offer from the bartender to make our drinks after waiting for 20 minutes to get her attention in a less than half full bar on a Wednesday night. She seemed too busy doing other things like not tending to guests. However the rest of or visit did not disappoint and was very impressive. Server at the table and from the kitchen were all very friendly and very knowledgeable of their product. Dessert was amazing; made for a very happy birthday boy. This location is in a busier part of town - definitely recommend the valet service as well.
