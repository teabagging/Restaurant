The interior is spacious and the place had no discernible scent (other than the food that was coming out). I acknowledge its bizarre to comment on the lack of a foul smell, but there are a few places in the area that are eateries during the day and bars at night that make this observation relevant... \\n\\nAnyway, we arrived for an early lunch and had no problem getting a table. Right away we spotted the Poutine on the menu and decided on main dishes. The Poutine comes with hand-cut fries, Wisconsin cheese curds, gravy, and a garlic Rosemary aioli. They were delish and though I'm not a Poutine connoisseur, I feel confident saying they wouldn't disappoint.\\n\\nFor my main dish I went with the short rib sandwich. My favorite part was the pickled red onion and the garlic aioli- definitely took the sandwich to a special place on my fave local sandwiches list. Even better, it came with house chips. These home-made chips were a big hit around the table. I asked for honey mustard for dipping and could have eaten a bowl of them for lunch (I just may do that next time).\\n\\nBy the end, we were full but still had Poutine left over. The server came by to check on us and take our plates and made a point of asking if we liked the dish, seeing as we left so much of it.

Because of this, my expectations are generally pretty low. Since I am such a non-foodie I usually order Pad Thai at Thai restaurants. My husband, on the other hand, is more adventuresome, has a more discerning palette and actually likes spicy hot food. \\n\\nOne thing we like to do is to ask wait-staff what THEY especially like. In the old days this was a common enough question in restaurants. It is a way of saying \\"What do you recommend\\"? (We've been served some great food just by asking this simple question).  So, my husband asked the female server: \\"What is your favorite dish here\\"? She was poised with pen and pad ready to write down what we wanted and she replied \\"Me? oh, don't ask me...I don't know. I always eat the same thing here over and over.\\" (Thinking that whatever THAT is is a safe bet..we pressed her). The answer? Pad Thai. Oooookay. But on top of being disappointedly not versed in the dishes of this restaurant she seemed genuinely irritated by the question....the implication being that she didn't LIKE any of the food there herself and further (with a shrug) she couldn't care less what in the h3ll our experience was going to be. \\n\\nOkay! So after more teeth-pulling type questions my husband landed on the Red Curry dish. She explained that it is sort of hot, but not super-hot, so she offered to bring a hot sauce on the side. When she brought out the food she neglected to bring the additional sauce. \\"Should we have additional sauce\\"? I asked. She then brings it out..but geez, how could she possibly forget it? She recommended this herself and it was minutes between this decision and the serving of the food. There were no other customers, so apparently on top of a pure dislike for food (other than Pad Thai) at her own restaurant, she also has a sieve for a mind. \\n\\nIn the end..My Pad Thai was fine..my husband's Red Curry was fine, but her attitude SUCKED. Would like to see them paint the building. The prices were fine. I noticed a Willamette Week \\"Cheap Eats\\" award decal from 2004 on the door.

I've had good and bad days at Soundbites, but not here.  Most everything is fresh and quite good -- from the fruit bowl (huge and always an impressive selection of fruit) to perfectly done omelets.  Pancakes and such are typical diner style, nothing special, but better than most breakfast places.  Same thing with the eggs benedict -- they're fine, but not what you'd get at an upscale restaurant for brunch.  Go with the grilled mashed potatoes as a side (a.k.a. \\"homefries\\" -- these aren't anything anyone else on the planet calls homefries, but they're tasty); the diced potatoes are the one thing on the menu I find unnecessarily bland.\\n\\nWhile it's a decent moderately-priced breakfast joint, the actual recipes are only slightly better (and definitely less greasy) than typical diner fare.  But, as I said, the actual servings of these recipes are consistently good, so I'd give the place 4 stars for the food.\\n\\nWhere it excels, however, is customer service.  After you order, you barely have time to go get some self-serve coffee before your food arrives, hot and fresh.  The manager is generally around, checking in with people, making sure everything's going well -- and, if he sees you there more than once, getting your name.\\n\\nContrast that with Soundbites next door, which used to be at the Ball Square Cafe location and was notorious for gruff waitstaff as well as kicking out customers who were half-finished with their meals just so they could pack more people in and get a few more bucks.  Now that Soundbites is in a much larger location, you'd think they'd calm down a bit.  They do on weekdays somewhat (though service is generally too hands off then), but at busy times, you constantly feel like you're being rushed so they can turn your table over.  Since this is a review of Ball Square Cafe, it may seem odd to mention so much about a rival, but since they serve a very similar menu, it's important to appreciate why one is better than the other.\\n\\nAbout 18 months ago, I finally had it with Soundbites after yet another stressful meal where I felt like I was in the way.  I'll never go back there.  Even on a busy weekend morning, where the place is bustling and lines are out the door, Ball Square doesn't feel rushed.  You move on quickly because you, personally, want to make room for the next guests to experience good food, rather than feeling like you're being pushed out the door 10 minutes after you get your food."},{"name":"Madras Pavilion","address":"9025 Research Blvd, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This is an average vegetarian Indian buffet.

Let's survey the offerings: First, TC offers a variety of Caribbean inspired dishes like jerk chicken and plantains--hence the \\"tropical\\". Second, they offer some Cajun dishes, like jambalaya, and faux-Cajun dishes, like sweet and sour Cajun chicken. So far so good right? Well that's hardly the end. In addition to the Caribbean/Cajun selections, you can also find a number of Asian inspired dishes such as lo mein, sesame seed chicken, and fried rice. If you're still desirous of a bit more variety, have no fear, because TC also provides a large selection of southern/homestyle options such as macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and ox tail. All this is to say, it really should be called \\"Homestyle Southern Tropical Cajun and Noodle House.\\"\\n\\nMoving onto the food, I found it little better than the name. I had the jambalaya, macaroni and cheese, lo mein, bourbon chicken, and sweet and sour Cajun chicken. Starting with the jambalaya, as a Louisiana native, let me tell ya this is not jambalaya--not even close. To the contrary, it seems more akin to fried rice that a clumsy chef dropped a jar of red pepper in. The lo mein fared little better--it seemed just like spaghetti. The macaroni and cheese was decent, but then again it's macaroni and cheese--you can get this stuff from a box.\\n\\nBoth of the entrees were actually decent. Unsurprisingly at this point, the sweet and sour Cajun chicken was in no way Cajun, it seemed more akin to a derivative of a General Tso's chicken recipe. The bourbon chicken was actually pretty tasty, albeit tasting nothing like bourbon. It had a bit of a sweet and smoky flavor. This leads me to believe that its name comes from imitating bourbon's sweet/smoky balance, not because it's actually made with any bourbon. Of course, this assumes that any names at TC have a rational basis.\\n\\nOverall, TC isn't horrible, and it is cheap. For $5.99 you get a filling meal with choices vaguely resembling signature dishes from about half the globe.

My hometown hosts one of the largest county fairs around, you know, with the prize pumpkins and the carnival games and the Clydesdales, and it was there that I cultivated an abiding love and appreciation for the madness of deep fried foods--hot dogs stuffed in zucchinis and breaded and fried, deep fried candy bars and twinkies and cookie dough--it is our belief that no food substance can not be improved through the dedicated application of batter and hot oil. If the Future Farmers of America taught a young person how to distinguish the finer points of beer batter instead of dairy cattle I might have joined. Anyhow, I consider myself a connoisseur of the deep fried, and onion rings remain my favorite. \\n\\nBut this is about Sckavone's and not about me. Their onion rings are unequivocally the best I have ever tasted. Onions are merely a vehicle for the ingestion of deep fried batter anyway; Sckavone's understands this deeply: the breading is thick and doughy, thick and doughy enough to prevent an onion from sliding around in there, and it is also soft and sweet, almost like a funnel cake. The onion ring on its own is so delicious as to render the side of tartar sauce largely unnecessary (this is heresy), although Sckavone's incarnation of tartar sauce is also amazing.

We arrived in time for HH and chilled out in the lounge section. For $3.95 we spilt a flight of their speciality beers, personally I loved the seasonal - Berlinerweisse, very tart but refreshing. The normal beers were nothing too spectacular but they have a wide range of choices from the Northern Light which is their lightest choice to darker more sophisticated brews like Darkside Cascadian Dark Ale. Because it was HH certain appetizers were half price - we tried the cornbread and the garlic bulbs. Both were delicious! We ordered the grilled salmon and the beef tenderloin later in the evening and both were cooked and seasoned well. The sauce that came on the tenderloin was great! The grilled onion mashed potatoes were awesome, my husband got the blue cheese scalloped potatoes with his dish which were also really tasty! Overall great food, good beer, and service was awesome where we were hanging out at in the lounge - where you can take advantage of HH and the full dinner menu versus sitting in the dining area where you don't get to take advantage of HH prices. Only con were that the cushions in the lounge were really beat up, it didn't effect the comfort but didn't look as swanky as it could have with the huge tears everywhere. Also it isn't cheap even during HH if you order appetizers and entrees with a few beers per person you'll end up spending $100 or so for a couple, so it'll definitely be reserved for a date night splurge!!

Could barely hear anything over the bustle of it all - I definitely prefer a more laid-back beer tasting, and this was anything but. \\n\\nAnyway, it was on my list, as everyone was raving about it, so I popped in and had one beer at the bar (or rather, standing awkwardly near the bar, because all the seats were taken). Most of the beer on their list also looked super mainstream, and I tend to prefer more experimental sorts of things, so I tried the one interesting thing on their list, a \\"thai-inspired sour with lemongrass and chile\\".

First you start with a rather generous portion of \\"salad\\", which really, is more like a lot of romaine lettuce in a bowl with a sort of Japanese take on Russian dressing. The romaine was fresh, but, it would have been nice if they included some more veggies to make it more like a salad. Perhaps some cucumbers and tomatoes? But, I wasn't even expecting it, so it was okay. The hibachi chef did a lot of the typical hibachi tricks like the onion volcano, juggling of eggs and shooting sake in the mouthes of those who wanted to partake. I especially enjoyed the moment when he burst into a rendition of the Reel 2 Real hit \\"I Like to Move It\\". I think that was when he was scrambling the eggs for the fried rice.The portion of fried rice and shrimp was very generous. There were  probably about 15 nice sized shrimps with the tails removed. All this for about $22. The staff was great refilling our water glasses and clearing our plates quickly. I also appreciated that they allowed us  to linger a little bit after the hibachi chef had left and we had finished eating.

I asked the waitress what they might be able to do for me, since the main restaurant downstairs had a few items that could work. She said suggested a risotto that they have as a side dish, and I said great. She came back a few minutes later to tell me that the kitchen was unwilling to do that because it was \\"on another floor\\", and that other than a garden salad, there was nothing I could have other than french fries. In my 15 years of being a vegetarian, this is the first time a restaurant has ever refused to make something vegetarian. I am still stunned.

However, the excitement fizzled out fast after our first experience there. We went on a Sunday evening with a couple of other friends. First of all the service was pretty slow. We stood at the door for a few minutes before one of the customers at the bar told us that we could find seats on our own. Then it took about 5 minutes before the server gave us our menus. Then it took approximately another 10 minutes before our drink and dinner orders were taken. To top off the slowness, our burgers came out one at a time in two minute increments, 20 minutes after we placed our order. \\n\\nSo... you would think that if you waited that long for your food it would be absolutely perfect and the way you ordered it, right? Wrong. The presentation was very poor and the food was mediocre at best. I ordered the mushroom swiss burger and it came out with very little mushrooms and the cheese was not melted onto the burger. Also, I ordered it medium and it was cooked well done. By that time I was so hungry that I ate it anyway. Our friend ordered the blue cheese burger and it maybe had one or two crumbles of blue cheese. In addition to poor burgers, the sweet potato fries were skinny and soggy AND two dollars extra! \\nPositives:  The onion rings and fries were ok.  \\nPrices: Burgers were between $7 to $11.

I noticed that City BBQ had pretty good reviews on Yelp so we went.  We are from CT and have a favorite BBQ place where we used to live so we had high hopes for City.  When we walked in we weren't sure what type of place it was because there wasn't a hostess station and people were seated with their food.  We looked around a bit and realized it was like our favorite place back home!  You order at a counter and then sit where you like and wait for your order to be called.  As you walk up to place your order they have a big cooler type thing in the center with local brew type sodas and bottled beer type drinks you can buy.  Above the register is the menu board.   We let someone go before us because we didn't look at the menu before we got there.  I think both of us ordered our \\"usual\\" at our CT favorite to see how City compares.  Kevin got a pulled pork sandwich.  He wanted to get the combo plate, but it didn't include the pulled pork.  I got the \\"LoLo's pulled pork, but not a sandwich.  My favorite BBQ is Carolina style.  Probably because I grew up with that and I enjoy vinegar a lot!  We also ordered a bunch of sides to try.  We got: french fries, baked beans, cole slaw, and hush puppies.   \\n\\nWe got our cups for fountain drinks and wandered over to the drink bar section.  They had dispensers with unsweetened tea, lemonade, and sweet tea.  They also had a standard soda fountain too.  I got the lemonade and Kevin got the tea.  The lemonade was amazing.  It tastes like fresh squeezed, so good!  So we found a table set our stuff down and went to go find the sauces.  There's a condiment bar where you get cups of sauce, packets of ketchup, etc.  They had a warming buffet thing with their sauces in it.  Kevin got the spicy and I got their signature.  Their sauce is pretty sweet, but it was pretty good.  I'm not really a fan of BBQ sauce anyway, as I said earlier I prefer vinegar sauce.  But for BBQ sauce it was pretty good, just really sweet.  They also had a beer 6 pack with other sauces for you to try at the table, which included a vinegar sauce!!!!  And it was great!  It had a little more spice to it than I'm used to which was really great!  \\n\\nSO.  Our order was called and it comes on a pizza round pan type thing.  Really fun presentation ,I think.  Brown paper in in the different paper carton things the sides come in.  My pork had a scoop of cole slaw on top of the pulled pork.  Kevin's sandwich looked good.  He put a bit of the cole slaw that we got as a side on his sandwich.  At our place in CT they call that gator style with cole slaw on the sandwich.  Anyway, so he put his sauce on his sandwich and was on his way.  I had to try a hush puppy first.  SOOOO good!  Just how I remember them from my childhood going to family reunions in NC.  That was an awesome start.  Then I took a bite of my pork.  I didn't realize you had to dress your meat yourself.  I felt pretty dumb.  I thought mine already came with the vinegar sauce on it.  So I put a healthy helping of the sauce on the meat and it was good stuff.  My serving had quite a bit of fat in it, but that's sometimes how pulled pork is.  Just pick it out and eat the rest, right?  It was good.  The cole slaw that came with the Lo Lo was a creamy slaw unlike their side of slaw which is a sweet vinegar slaw.  We weren't really a fan of the side of slaw.  The creamy slaw was okay, kind of bland.  The french fries were really really good.  Fresh cut fries, good stuff.  The baked beans have brisket in them, they were okay too.  A bit too sweet for us.  If you like sweet beans you might love them.  But we weren't a fan.    Two out of four sides were great.  And there are a lot more we can try next time.  \\n\\nOver all Kevin and I were pleased with City BBQ.  We both said it was okay.  We still like Chester's in Groton CT better, but this is a good alternative for while we're living out here for sure.  We were thinking maybe we'll like the other meat choices better than the pulled pork options the next time we go.  We'll definitely be back though.

The American breakfast has awesome bacon slices and a wholesome biscuit, which had the option of a homemade apple jelly, which was delicious. \\n\\nThe service was subpar, definitely not what I expected for the amount of people we had. And to top it all off, we had to create an elaborate payment plan ourselves. Between passing the bill around and others including tip and tax or not, it was a fiasco.

It's sort of a dive.  The lighting was less than dim--it was seriously dark. I guess the dark prevented people from seeing me because I kept getting bumped. \\n\\nAnyhow, seeing as how it was my first visit, I I ordered a bowl of chili.  Yeah, so, it was sort of icky.  I got mild, which was the right level of heat for me; however, it totally lacked any other flavor.  Though there was quite a bit of meat, the chili seemed a bit heavy on filler (not sure what it was though).  I did get unlimited saltines.  I love saltines.  I actually liked the saltines more than the chili.  Not a good sign, especially since I am a former chili cook-off judge.  Granted, it was only one contest, but still, I ate a lot of chili that day, and all of it was better than this.  I do have to compliment this place on their speedy service.

I mean when you go to Uno's you aren't expecting some world class eating experience. But everytime I have gone to Kenmore location I have had fast, good, attentive, courteous service. One thing I like about this chain is that they post their calories on their website and in the restaurant- so if you are watching what you eat you can be informed and make a better choice. Their flatbread pizzas have so much less calories than the deep dish pizzas, and they are still good. For appetizers the breadsticks or the nachos are good. And for dessert their chocolate chip cookie and brownie desserts are so amazing. And now they added 3 mini desserts- so much better calorie wise. I actually split the mini brownie with a friend the last time I went- it was only like 2 bites, but it was warm and perfect, topped with vanilla ice cream.

My wife goes and asks the fat redneck/owner/manager standing by the front door that **pointed** us to our table if we can get some menus. He rolls his eyes, and condescendingly says \\"he'll get right on it\\", then laughs in her face.\\n\\nRedneck/owner/manager doesn't do anything, we leave, and on the way out redneck/owner/manager says \\"i'm glad you're leaving, these people need a table!\\", this is right in front of a couple waiting for a table standing right in front of him.

She was wonderful, our waiter smh I don't even want to begin with that headache but he did pick it up towards the end. \\n\\nFood: 2 stars: the cheese puffs were good, not as good as Fado but they were good. The beet salad was good but I couldve made better at home, when dropping $12 for just beets and goat cheese you do expect some wow factor. The white bean and black truffle soup, very underwhelming and after a couple of spoon fulls I suffered fatigue from the taste of it of lack of it. It was no depth or real flavor. The trout smh lol the menu described it as almond crusted trout but it was trout with some thinly sliced almonds thrown across the fish. Suprisingly the trout was well seasoned and was very good, no complaints there. The ravioli was flavorless and chewy but my oldest son suffered through eating it because he didn't want to complain. The escargot were a slap in the face of those who KNOW WHAT ESCARGOT IS SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE! it was oily and devoid of taste besides garlic and rubbery. Ive had escargot served on cruises that tasted better than this. My ol man and I ordered some seafood pasta with white sauce and peas. BLAND AND REVOLTING! so revolting we both sent our dishes back after 2 bites, we just could not bring ourselves to eat that plate of mess that was undercooked in some areas and over cooked in others. The children's pasta is a joke, its nothing more than noodles and bland red sauce. Carrabba's makes better pasta than this! Because my children were starving one ate it and the other passed settling for eating the cold hard bread brought to the table with damn near frozen butter. When we requested more bread, I asked for it to be warmed, the waiter brought out more cold bread. The desserts were ok but I've had better. We tried some chocolate dessert on a scale of 1-10 I give it a 4, mind you my son would eat an old boot if covered in chocolate and he refused it after one bite. It was just ok... the apple tart tasted like something diabetic people have to eat for dessert there was no sweetness to it unless you take into consideration the Ala mode on top. On a scale of 1 to 10 i give the apple tart a 4. Now the show stopper was the creme Brule hands down, I would order that dessert to go if I ever came back here or I could just go to donut dollies and get the creme Brule donut and be equally as satisfied. I would give that dessert a 10 because it was perfect.\\n\\nRestaurant/cleanliness: 3 stars: the restrooms were cleaned or just had been cleaned for the night. I used it around 945-10pm. As we attempted to eat that underwhelming, uninspired food we kept swatting at small flying insects. It wasnt many (like 3-4) but once killed the irritation went away, I'm guessing they came from out side with all that traffic coming back and forth. \\n\\nPrice point: 0 stars: the price point is not worth the portion size, taste, and it is not a value. I look at a fine meal as an investment, this was a poor investment considering I couldve went to CANOE, KYMA, RUTHS CHRIS, or even CHAMA GAUCHA. To spend this type of money just to throw up later on was very disappointing. I've been to all of those restaurants and never had a real problem with the food, service, or the price point, like here. This place has 4 out of 5 stars with over 400 reviews, I just knew this was going to be a sure investment. Sadly it was not and it has me questioning the sanity of the all the people who have such Stellar reviews. How could an \\"off day\\" be a holiday where you are expecting a lot of people? Idk but I am very disappointed with my dining experience. \\n\\nOverall: this place has been on my to do list for quite sometime so I opted to come for mother's day. The reservation process was painless and no issues when we arrived 5 minutes late due to not fitting in the parking deck and valet had to make a space. This place was disappointing and a mother's day dinner I will never forget lol I laugh because we all thought the food was horrible and will one day make for a good story. Again the manager on duty was accomodating as humanly possible and I can't blame or fault her for anything. I appreciated her customer service and her willingness to make things right. Our waiter moved so slow that when my soup came out it was lukewarm, he forgotten our drink orders or perhaps it was so loud in there he didn't hear it. Either way he left much to be desired. I am used to fine dining and his service was more like being served at a dismissive cheesecake factory. Would I come back? No... sorry Bistro Niko I wanted to really like you, I looked forward to dinning with you, this was supposed to be a great mother's day dinning experience but the only taste you left in our mouths was a bad one.

The hummus had a strange, bitter aftertaste, although the pita was ok.  The only bright bits were the vegetables, but it's hard to mess up cooked cauliflower swimming in  butter.

I have been here for lunch, dinner as well as happy hour. Happy hour is probably my favorite, and I've tried almost everything on the menu. In regards to tastes and flavors, it is as authentic as I have found here in the U.S. Keep in mind that there are many different regions in Germany, that all have different flavors. I am from Munich, Germany. \\n\\nThe beer selection is superb. Especially during the time of Oktoberfest. Be sure to snag the limited edition 'mass' of beer. You get to keep the glass and it is a liter of beer. Can't go wrong with that! Stay away from ordering a Rum and Coke or any drink for that matter as you will be super disappointed by its size. \\n\\nBack to the menu. The happy hour has smaller plates. Try the sliders, fondue (must add pretzels), bratwurst, chicken skewers,shepard's pie. All are excellent. On the main menu, the schweinshaxe, sausage trio, potato cakes and jaeger schnitzel are great. Definitely try a side of red cabbage as well. I do not recommend the spaetzle (which they compared to noodles) with ham or with the Alfredo sauce. The one item on the menu that has nothing to do with any German establishment, and probably just an attempt to appeal to the masses. Doesn't taste bad at all, just not authentic at all. If anything, bring me some damn Kasespaetzle! Thanks. \\n\\nIn regards to design or decor - definitely a corporate feel. Clean though with a nice bar area.

But I was converted after the first visit. Following my second visit, I can say with confidence that this is one of my favourite Japanese restaurants in town.\\n\\nI've only been to this place during late night hours. I love the intimate setting that this place exudes; although the booths and tables/seats are so close together, I don't mind it at all because it's such a different atmosphere than most Japanese restaurants I've been to. Mind you, this is also a family run business, which probably explains why it's such a tiny space. Regardless, the food is amazing and the staff is uber friendly.\\n\\nAround the table, we ordered crab and tobiko salad, california cone, chopped scallop sushi, tuna and salmon sashimi, old fashioned dynamite, the salmon tempura and a california roll. \\n\\nThe crab in the crab and tobiko salad was so tasty. I love the little bits of it together. There was also a yellow sauce on it that was just so creamy. The roe really added a nice color to the dish. The cucumber was good bite sizes and it was delicious.\\n\\nThe california cone was quite huge, it was bigger than cones I've had in other restaurants before. Because of it's size, I had to pick at it to avoid overstuffing my mouth. It was good regardless.\\n\\nThe chopped scallop sushi was also good. The sauce was creamy and scallop tasted fresh. I'm not a big fan of the way it's presented though, could use a little more work.\\n\\nThe tuna and salmon sashimi was nice and fresh. It's not frozen like that one time I had in Matsuyama. Again, that only happened once so it was an isolated incident.\\n\\nOne of my favourite dishes is the old fashioned dynamite roll. Well anything with avocado is pretty much a thumbs up for me (usually). I forgot to ask what exactly was in it and what sauces were used because I got distracted by how good it was. The flavor, texture, crunch, everything about it was good. I do believe it was a dynamite roll, breaded so that it was crunchy. Must have been something like that. And there was avocado on top. So good.\\n\\nThe salmon tempura was probably the weakest out of all the things we tried. It was still pretty good. This is similar to the california roll; just a generic california roll as someone in our table decided to play it safe and ordered it. \\n\\nThe bathroom wasn't very clean but it wasn't super dirty or messy either.

The Cheyenne Grille has always been a sports bar, but it was not always a pure sports bar.  Now, it is.  On with the review.\\n\\nThe Cheyenne Grille seems to reinvent itself about every year or two.  The latest version of the Cheyenne Grille is not my favorite.  In 2009 the bar was poorly run, the staff was miserable, and the restaurant was unpopular.  Late in that year, ownership changed and introduced a new feel to a run-down bar.  They brought in more of a Southwest type feel.  The new management took care of people and the staff was happy.  We liked it!  Everyone was super nice, the food was good, and we were soon on a first name basis with many of the people involved with the store.\\nAround the fall/winter of 2010 it changed again.  It has become a pure sports bar.  The menu has changed form a Southwest theme to a sports theme, with every item bearing the name of a sports venue, play, team, or whatever.\\n\\nThe new menu has dropped the higher end items, like steak, and introduced a variety of hot dog dishes, instead.  This, the management explained, is because people were not buying the high end items.  I confess, neither was I.  But, at that time the basic burger was so good I never wanted for more.  The new menu offers only basic, cheap food.  The prices are lower, but so is the quality of food.  Even the chili sucks.\\n\\nThe staff appears to have changed completely.  The new staff is, I'm sure, very fine.  But, I miss the young, fun people who used to add energy to the place.\\n\\nI have twice visited the Cheyenne Grille under the new motif and, well, both times were bad.\\n\\nOn the positive side, the Cheyenne Grille appears to be much more crowded, even on week days, and they have lots of televisions to support the viewing of sports.  If you are looking for a basic sports bar where you can eat bar food and watch TV, this might be the place for you.\\n\\nIn the mean time, I'll wait and see what happens next year."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"1948 SW Broadway","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Chipotle is overpriced and you can lick the corporate marketing vibe off the very walls, and half the time the staff at this one does NOT know how to properly fold a burrito.  \\n\\nHowever: sometimes, I gotta grab me a $7chicken burrito with two kinds of salsa, a half-serving of black beans and a half-serving of fajita veggies, and an entire avocado's worth of guac.

We arrived about 7 pm without reservations and were greeted by the owner, Tony, who told us we could wait or sit at the bar. We elected to sit at the bar rather than wait. The restaurant is fairly small, seating about 30. The bar is directly on the cooking area so you can see everything the chef is preparing. Based on Tony's recommendation my daughter had the special of Sea bass with lemon and tomatoes over linguine. I had the Spaghetti with Marinara and my wife had the Bolognese over linguine. Watching the staff, including the owner and chef work was enjoyable as they all worked together doing anything necessary to keep the food flowing efficiently. We were able to talk to the chef occasionally and that was also enjoyable and informative. They also had a singer singing \\"Frank Sinatra\\" style song and he did a wonderful job both with the quality of his singing and the volume (appropriate so you could still have a nice conversation).\\n\\nUpon taking her first bite of the Sea bass, my daughter said it may be the best meal she has ever had. I think she liked it. My wife and I both liked her Bolognese which was made with a little Alfredo sauce mixed in so it was very slightly creamy and had a nice flavor. She is a very picky eater and was very happy with her selection and said she would order it again. I found the Marinara to be OK, but it did not rock my world. It was just rather bland. We all agreed that this was a great find and we will definitely be back but all also agreed that the bread they served with dinner did not do justice to the rest of the food. We would strongly recommend they develop another bread offering as it is a real shame that something so simple is not up to par with the rest of their food.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend reservations, particularly on a Friday night, but if you don't mind sitting at the bar watching the chef work, then that is very enjoyable place to eat also.\\n\\nIf my Marinara had been as good as the Bolognese or Sea bass and the bread had been memorable, definitely a 5 star rating. Looking forward to going back."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Everywhere in Portland seems to have a chicken and waffles on the menu but Deschutes has an original spin on it.

I also found the cheesecake to be too rich, to the point that it was not enjoyable.  This, coming from someone who regularly enjoys cheesecake.  The portion was huge.

Overall, the drinks were good and consistent and I would definitely go to another show.\\n\\nNow with the bad, which is the reason I give it two stars...the other two times I was there, I was upstairs in the restaurant and both times I was at the bar with people.

The second time (more recent) we had a different, but equally friendly guy helping us and all was good.

I spent many years as a server and cocktail waitress at many different types of establishments and I have had some not-so-stellar managers, but every one of them knew enough to treat employees professionally and with respect when out on the floor with customers. This woman openly treated the employees poorly. As the bartenders walked away she rolled her eyes and made snide comments. She snipped at them and other employees right in front of our group and then turned around, acted sweet and complimented my friend's dress. I would not comment if I had not seen the same woman do this on two separate visits. The employees seemed to just let it slide and I am not sure I would have been as nice about it. The second time I was there it seemed like she may be training someone, or doing a wine tasting with a customer (not sure). Either way, it was not professional.

There were some issues while at the restaurant...\\n\\n1.  The first thing that hit me when we walked in the door was the smell.  The entire place smelled like wet cast iron.  It's not the most pleasant smell.\\n\\n2.  There was no hostess stand or anybody to greet us at the door.  We stood there waiting and waiting until finally a server (who eventually became our server) ran by and said, \\"Oh, sit anywhere you want.\\"  That's fine.  But a sign at the door stating that would have been nice.  \\n\\nWe sat in the side room.  Cute kind of \\"campy\\" vibe.\\n\\n3.  There were huge cobwebs with chunks of something caught in the webs.  This was hanging from the TV above our heads.  The menus were greasy.  The windows were filthy.  Good God--I wonder what the back of the house/kitchen area looks like.\\n\\n4.  The server came and took our drink order.  She didn't seem to know for sure if they sold sangria by the glass or just the pitcher only (menu mentioned sangria by the pitcher but I did not see any pricing for a glass).  I ordered a glass.  It was fine.  But I think you should know how the drinks are served.\\n\\n5.  I attempted to order the mahi mahi but was then told that the \\"OVEN WAS BROKEN.\\"  What?!?!?!  Should have left at that point.  I think I was just so stunned that it never occurred to me to ask if they could grill or pan sear my fish instead, and the server never offered that suggestion.  Our whole table was silent and the server assured us that everything else on the menu could be made without an oven.  \\n\\n6.  My friend ordered the steak and shrimp skewers which comes with a side of green beans and rice.  She said asked if she could substitute the grilled corn instead of both the green beans and rice and was told no.  Was not even offered an upcharge to add the corn.  \\n\\n7.  I also got the steak and shrimp skewers.  The green beans had the strangest tasting sauce/seasoning on it.  I did not eat it.  The rice was good.  I also ordered a side of habanero salsa and that hot spice added a lot of kick to my rice.  The skewers were fine--the meat was pretty much cooked to death but I was not about to complain.\\n\\nI will say the best part of the night was the company I was with.

Fast forward almost 6 years later -- even though I didn't return to Canoe again until this past Saturday (with my parents, who'd come in for a visit, and were agog over this place...yes, my \\"No place is better than Irvine/Newport Beach in CA\\" parents), I'd never forgotten Canoe, even after all these years.  It was still wonderful, as it was then. Shannon was just a fabulous server, welcoming and helpful.

I have never eaten at the Mattapan location, which seems to be reviewed quite positively.\\n\\nI've eaten at Flames probably 15 times since they opened in my neighborhood. I love jamaican food. I can say that each and every time I've come here they have things missing from the menu. Plantains, Jerk Wings, Roti, Ting, Sorrel Ginger, you're lucky if you happen to go in on a day when they have any of these things. The Stop & Shop has plantains EVERY day in their hot bar, why can't you just consistently have them! Or how about - don't say you have menu items that you don't have. List things that you don't have every day as \\"specials\\" instead of allowing me to get my hopes up.\\n\\nThe jerk wings are VERY good at flames. Juicy and the jerk is authentic. The Jerk Chicken entree, however, is dry every time, without exception. This is disappointing, but it must be noted that their curry chicken is some of the most tender and moist chicken I've ever had.\\n\\nA note on the curry chicken: moist, but the curry flavor isn't powerful enough. It is kind of bland, and QUITE greasy. Needs more salt and curry.\\n\\nFor some reason the cabbage always comes out cold... I want warm cabbage.\\n\\nThe beef patties are good some days, other days they taste hard like they've been on a hot plate for days. Today I had 2 beef patties. It was a bad patty day and they tasted all dry, the ends were stale. Today my orange rice had NO flavor to it, it was quite dry and flavorless.\\n\\nI used to be all about this place because the jerk wings and plantains WHEN you can get them together are unbeatable. But that seems to be a rare occurance. And no I don't want the jerk chicken entree. I used to love bringing people here but I am getting worn down.\\n\\nThe service: if you can get anyone working here to crack a smile, let alone break the bizarre stare of anger, you're doing good. And these guys definitely run on \\"jamaican time\\" -- slow as they wanna be. No matter how long the line is. They are slower than molasses here. And it's buffet style service!\\n\\nI can handle poor server attitude IF and only IF the food is kicking ass. Sadly, I have to report, the best items on the menu are barely there half the time so it's officially no longer worth the abuse of the staff.\\n\\nADDITIONAL notes: the hot sauce selection sucks and does not match with the flavors in their foods.\\n\\nOh, and don't bother ordering delivery (the menu says they deliver) but if you call they say NO delivery. When I said \\"ok, can I place an order for takeout then?\\" she told me NO and to just come down and order...\\n\\nright, so I can sit there for 20 minutes while you take your sweet time and the cabbage is cold and there are, unapologetically, no plantains!?!!??!?!\\n\\nAAAAARGH flames you lost a customer who was TRYING to find a reason to hang on today.

We'll pay heart-stoppingly high prices for plane tickets because we need to get away from our barely tolerable jobs.\\n\\nLikewise, we'll traverse the city limits, monitor our alcohol intake, and *shudder* plan ahead when the promise of leisure strikes our fancy.

It also has a decent happy hour that will sustain your bocce ball game, which will slowly creep from a harmless few minutes to hours if you're not careful. When you finally emerge from the bocce court, your hands and pant legs all chalked up and your throat parched, in other establishments you might expect the staff to treat you like a small child in a china shop.

However, North By Northwest (marked by a large \\"NXNW\\" sign) spices things up a bit by offering an exciting menu and neo lodge-like atmosphere.\\n\\nThe competition for dining dollars in the Arboretum / Northwest Hills area is no doubt fierce, but for some reason there is rarely a long wait for a good table at North By Northwest, and the bar in the lobby area is cozy yet efficient in making sure your short wait can be had with a good drink.  \\n\\nThe beer selections are actually quite impressive for a microbrewery.  Often, such establishments focus on either ripping off the flavors of traditional domestic brands like Budweiser or Coors, or going in the complete opposite direction in creating flavors that are curiously interesting but entirely unfulfilling.  The selection at North By Northwest offers a variety of styles and flavors that always seem to be good for a second glass...or third....or fourth.  You get the picture.\\n\\nThe food is more than standard pub fare, with hearty burgers on toasted sourdough bread and fried potato chips with blue cheese crumbles, for example.  Prices are a little higher than other local microbreweries (like Waterloo Ice House, for example), but the atmosphere is more refined and the recipes are more unique.

Around ten thousand students graduated from UT on May 22nd and my nephew was one them. Fortunately he graduated with an engineering degree, architectural engineering to be exact, which means that I only sat at Frank Erwin Center for a couple of hours while approximately five hundred students received their diplomas. It was great! The speakers were eloquent, as expected, and the kids -yes, kids!- had fun while celebrating their biggest accomplishment to date.\\n\\nMy brother, sister-in-law and niece came to town to celebrate the youngest member of their family, and celebrate we did! Hopping from restaurant to restaurant all weekend long. \\n\\nWe started at Buenos Aires Cafe on Friday night and moved on to Taste of Ethiopia on Saturday, for lunch. All delicious! But the most delectable food discovery for me, was at Banger's Sausage House and Beer Garden, for brunch on Sunday. \\n\\nAny of you that know me are probably scratching your heads by now, Banger's? Really? Exactly! That's what I said to my nephew when he chose the place, beer and sausage? I don't drink beer and don't eat sausage, but it was his day to celebrate and he got to choose the place, so I acquiesced.  I figured that I would be able to find something to eat, after all this is Austin, music capital of the world and foodie's heaven.\\n\\nWe arrived close to 11:30 am and approached the host station where we were notified that there would be about a ninety minute wait. My nephew was determined to eat at Banger's, so we proceeded to the waiting area. This was just outside, by the street, under the trees. There were several high wooden tables, placed there for this purpose, where we let our elbows rest. There were ten of us, friends and family, hanging out and having a good time. Since the weather was nice, not too hot, not raining -yet-, we had been there for about thirty minutes when someone suggested we get some mimosas, no, wait, man-mosas!\\n\\nThese were largest beer mugs you have ever seen filled with champagne and orange juice. I did not even order one but shared in the indulgence with my brother and sister-in-law. There was plenty to go around. \\nMan-mosas\\nWe remained by the high table, talking and having a good time. I met a young couple from New Braunfels and a group of people that had attended a wedding the night before, close by. They said there were about thirty people from the wedding party waiting for tables.\\n\\nBy now, the music was playing, loud and loud. The jazz band was very good, but a tad too loud and I was not the only one saying this. If there is anything that I would suggest, would be to turn down the speakers, we were not able to hear each other. Okay, okay, it's Austin, but still!\\n\\nThe ninety minutes came and went and right at the two hour mark, from the time we had arrived, we were seated. Once this happened, everything moved pretty quickly. Water and other drinks were served and our orders taken. Mostly everyone ordered their eggs and steaks or sausage with fries. One person in my party had a bagel with cream cheese and lox which looked fresh and delicious.  I, the foodie in the group -and mostly plant based- decided to try their vegetarian sausage on a bed of greens. The sausage was made with crushed and sun dried tomatoes, cheese curds and shiitake mushroom bacon and it was everything I was hoping for and more. It was soft in the inside and had a slight crisp to the outside. The flavors were well blended and none were overpowering. The mixed greens were also fresh and I did not leave anything on my plate. I even ate a lot of my dining companions fries, my indulgence, since I had not ordered a bun!\\nVeggie sausage on a bed of greens\\n\\nAll in all, a great experience. Waiting for two hours to sit at any restaurant is not something that I yearn, but it was totally worth it. The time spent with my family and friends was fun, and the food and service were good.

It serves up Modern American cuisine with Asian influences. Amazing ambiance inside and out. Trendy, sophisticated-classy, and casual. Canoe consists of inside seating as well as outdoor (patio) seating. The scenery outside is breath-taking. Great for snapping a few pictures, waiting for your party to arrive, and grabbing a few drinks (has an open bar). \\n\\nFinally got the chance to try it out for a birthday event I attended!\\n\\nParking: Complimentary Valet \\n\\nAppetizer: \\nTea Smoked Duck Breast, Bartlett Pear, Confit Duck Leg, Seeded Mustard, Blue Cheese Cream 13.\\n\\n-Where do I begin? The duck was cooked well and very tender to taste. It almost tasted like a Chinese BBQ pork seasoning/marination. It was served like a salad-type appetizer. The dressing/sauce was good, but eventually overwhelming -- too oily considering duck is already a fatty bird. The bleu cheese definitely added a kick of flavor balanced off with the sweetness of the barlett pear. \\n\\nEntree: \\nStuffed Vermont Quail, Kabocha Squash Stuffing, Brussels Sprouts, Apple, Bourbon Coffee Glaze (26) \\n\\n-DELICIOUS. The quail was delicious, tender. The bourbon coffee glaze was just enough to make your taste buds notice it. The squash stuffing was so good. It had a mushy flavor (kinda like mashed potatoes), but it went well with the slight crunchiness of the brussel sprouts. Simple yet tasty. \\n\\nOverall, great first experience at Canoe. Highly recommend this place. \\nService was exceptional.

The restaurants are cleanly. The play places are safe and clean. Staff are nice, friendly, courteous, etc. and of course their food is phenomenal for fast food. Today, however, I was disappointed in almost all aspects of the aforementioned compliments. The play place was outside, so it was dirty (naturally given it's placement, so I didn't really care about that). The restaurant's floor was covered in dirt (possibly mud) from the young men a few booths away and wasn't swept up until a few minutes before we left (we were there at least 30 minutes). The food was all right, but not the quality, I'd been expecting. And the sweet tea (which I normally rave over) was disgusting. My husband did complain about it and was given the ability to try the tea from the drive-thru (also gross). The manager did come out and acknowledge something was wrong with the tea, but I'm not sure they even pulled it. They just exchanged our teas for sodas. So, despite that, I'd still rate the customer service as spot on, but considering how busy they weren't (fairly strange considering the time), I'm not sure why all those other things happened.

I was a little worried that it would be packed with partiers seeing as it was 2:30am but we got seated right away.  \\n\\nOur waiter was this tall guy with dreadlocks (in case you see him when you go there and want to change waiters...or hassle him for me).  He took our drink order and promptly disappeared.  About 10 minutes later, another waiter came by and asked if we had been helped and we told him we were still waiting on our drinks.  Shortly after that, our waiter came back with the drinks and took our order.  \\n\\nUsually after such an offense, I start mentally subtracting from the 20% tip I was planning on giving (I tend to be generous, I used to be a waitress so I know how it is.)  But then I noticed that it had been at least 20 minutes and we were still waiting on our food.  Then my companions and I realized that people who had come in after us were already eating.  At this point, the friend and I wanted to leave but unfortunately, my boyfriend really had his heart set on Denny's.\\n\\nWe called the waiter over to ask what was going on.  He runs to the kitchen real quick and then reports back that they were having problems with one of the burgers.  I didn't understand that at all - how does a burger give you problems?   If the first one got burned or something, say so.  \\n\\nSo, the clock's still ticking - I think at this point it's around 3:15.  We start talking aloud about the tip our waiter is getting ($0) and two managers walk over.  I'm not sure if they heard us talking or what but they asked us if we were having a problem.  One of them had our ticket in her hand.  I said yes, we were having a problem because our food wasn't here yet and apparently one of the burgers was misbehaving in the kitchen.  The two of them conferred with each other and told us they'd be right back.\\n\\nTen minutes later, we got up and left (without paying for the drinks).  The two managers were sitting on the bench near the hostess station just shooting the breeze.  So all in all, we wasted a whole hour there with nothing to show for it.  We ended up having to go to Whataburger.\\n\\nI joked to the friend (who's Middle Eastern) that they probably thought we were a bunch of terrorists since both he and my boyfriend had full beards.

The beers themselves are decent offerings, but have far too much of a malt/sweet finish for my liking.  But the brewery was on the way to the hotel as we walked the streets of Portland, so who am I to refuse a tasting of some of their other offerings...\\n\\nQuite glad I did.  What I expected to be a 2-3 star experience, was quickly boosted by some very good beers, including three interesting, hop-forward beers: \\n\\nHop in the Dark - listed as a \\"cascadian dark ale\\", which I had never seen before.  It's got some malty flavor too it, and a little bit of a coffee taste which was a pretty cool balance to the hops.  Very interesting beer.\\n\\nWhite IPA - apparently this one is a collaboration between Deschutes and Boulevard Brewing.  All I know is that the result is a really interesting beer.  On the front-end you taste the typical characteristics of a Belgian White beer, but it finishes with piney kick that is delicious!\\n\\nFresh-squeeze IPA - I like this IPA much better than their Inversion IPA.  Named because of it's citrusy flavor which is easily detectable, this IPA is strong but as refreshing a glass of OJ.

I was happy to have found another Cantonese restaurant in the area. Even better, they have a ton of clay pot rice to choose from. The last time I had it was when I visited Hong Kong. \\n\\nThere's nothing fancy about the interior. They had plaid tablecloth covering all the tables with a TV showing CNN hung over the wall. You know you're dining at an authentic Chinese place when there's a scent of Tiger Balm in the air as other diners walked in. \\n\\nThe service was excellent. Our waiter was nice, courteous, and prompt. Our dishes came out pretty quickly from the kitchen. \\n\\nWe had steamed minced pork with salted fish ($9.95). It was on the salty side as expected from the salted fish. The meat wasn't too greasy. This dish went very well with white steamed rice. They had ong choy (Chinese water spinach) stir-fried with garlic and preserved beancurd (furu) even though I was told by my MIL that they don't grow this vegetable around here anymore because its roots clog up the sewer. Anyway, that was probably why this dish was $12.95, more than the meat dish. Despite this, this was very tasty. It also went very well with the steamed rice. Lastly, the chicken and abalone clay pot rice was a great treat. It surprised my husband, who has never had clay pot rice before. The juices (aka fat) from the chicken seeped into the rice underneath and made this tasted wonderful. To end the meal, they served us complementary red bean soup with tapioca.\\n\\nI will definitely go back now that I know there's another Cantonese restaurant around here. I want to try the Chinese preserved meats clay pot rice.

Do not order them, they are flavorless, soggy peanuts.  The boil does nothing to enhance, it actually detracts.  The condiments were also great, their spicy mustard was insane, I bought a bottle and took some home it was so good.  Either way, this is a great place to and enjoy.  Sit outside and just have fun.

My hubby had an 1890 manhattan which he very much enjoyed. We had the fried green tomatoes to start which had too much breading and not enough tomato but we both liked the dipping sauces. My husband had the belt line burger which looked great and he devoured. I had the halibut. The fish was perfectly cooked and I loved the pickled cauliflower and crispy chorizo that topped it.

I loved that they served it with a spicy mustard dipping sause that help add to the Germanic quality of the meal. I also ordered Gustav's excellent cheese fondue and washed everything down with a Spaten Oktoberfest.\\n\\nI have one complaint that keep me from giving this the coveted fifth star. I found the service to be unusually slow especially since the restaurant wasn't that busy. It took about 15 minutes for me and my friend to receive our beers. This would only be acceptable if they were actually getting the beer from Germany at that instant. Unfortunately a trip to the Vaterland was not the reason for wait.

I mean Really Great!\\nThe servers wear scantily clad uniforms and are beautiful, however they are also exceptional at their job. Nicole was our server and not only was she on top of her game with keeping my glass refilled, but she was very personable and offered great suggestions.\\nNow on to the food!\\nThey offer a cross between classic Irish pub food (Shepherd's Pie, Irish Stew, Gaelic Chicken) and American bar food (Burgers, Fries and Salads). There food is made to order and they use all fresh ingredients, and even make their own sauces and dressings. They can also custom make many Burgers and Pizzas upon request.\\nI was told of their amazing nightly specials (Monday night All You Can Eat Wings, Wednesday night All You Can Eat Boneless Wings) and they also offer \\"Hoppy Hour\\" daily from 3pm -7pm, then again from 9pm - close where they have personal sized items for $2 - $5. \\nI have a weakness for Potato Chips in general, but when the TK Irish Nachos were described to us and I found out that they make their own Chips I knew that we had to get those for our appetizer.\\n(Fresh cooked crispy Potato Chips, covered with out signature Guinness Beer Cheese Sauce, seasoned Ground Beef and Tomatoes $7.50)\\nThis dish made me very happy. The Chips were thick cut, which made them substantial enough to hold all of the toppings and were also super-crispy. The Beer Cheese Sauce gave it an interesting flavor too so that it wasn't just like eating Chips and Queso. On a side note I didn't want to fill up just yet so I boxed half of it to go, and then later that evening I put heated up the leftovers under the broiler and they were just as good the second time around. \\nThey had many delicious-sounding Burgers to choose from, so I figured I had better try one of them for my entr√©e.\\nI decided on the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger.\\n(Applewood Smoked Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Crispy Shoestring Onions and Guinness BBQ Sauce $10.50)\\nI can see why their Burgers are so popular. It tasted really fresh and the ingredients were above average in quality and flavor. One of the better Burgers that I have had in quite some time.\\nIt came with regular Fries, but to be a little different I decided to upgrade to Parmesan Garlic Fries. They were also full of flavor and were really garlicky.\\nMy friend ordered the Chicken Tenders.\\n(Lightly Battered Chicken Breast Tenders, served with Cayenne Ranch Sauce, Pub-made Coleslaw and a side of French Fries $10.50)\\nShe just had them as is, but they can also toss them in one of their Six Wing Sauces if you want. I didn't try them but they looked really good and by the looks of them I would definitely order them in the future.\\nThen to close out our meal we decided to have the Tilted Guilt.\\n(A partially baked gooey Chocolate Chip or White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookie served hot from the oven and topped with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Syrup $5.50)\\nI don't normally order dessert, but this particular one sounded so good. Indeed it was. The Cookie itself was HUGE and they weren't kidding about being \\"gooey\\". We split it and I must say that these are definitely big enough for two. I was also told that you get one of these free on your birthday.\\nSo when I first thought about going to the Tilted Kilt I figured that it would be \\"just mediocre\\" in certain ways, but I can honestly say that I really enjoyed every aspect of it. \\nThe place was pretty cool, the service was outstanding, and most importantly the food was exceptional (and the price is very reasonable, especially for what you get).

The hot and sour soup was tolerable, but so spicy I choked several times on little bits of unincorporated peppers. \\n\\nLet me say, I liked China Wok well enough before the change, enough to put up with my husband wanting their food every week.

The garden setting by the river is nice and scenic.  Sure, you can still tell it's near Atlanta because you can see the bridge and cars crossing it, but it's a nice environment nonetheless.    We sat outside at night and it was great -- very pastoral, or as close as you'll get dining out in the area.\\n\\nI like the concept of the very reasonably priced \\"Local Yokel\\" prix fixe three course menu with locally-sourced ingredients.  I didn't order it this time, but my date did (with wine pairings).  We started by splitting the House Smoked Salmon.  I liked the smoked salmon itself, and the potato cake with goat cheese was pretty good, but it was all very rich together.  Personally, I like the simple taste of smoked salmon by itself.   With the cheese, I think it was too rich as a starter, so I didn't finish it.  Also, since they pre-split it for us, we both got a relatively large portion.  \\n\\nThey also bring around a bread basket and let you choose from three different breads.  The sourdough and spicy flat bread were awesome; I probably had five or six pieces of that flat bread over the course of dinner.   The poppy seed wheat was also good but my least favorite of the three.  Since my date got the three course prix fixe, they brought out a chilled white shrimp soup for his appetizer after we finished the salmon.  I tried a bite and it was pretty good, but I don't think I'd order it normally.  \\n\\nHis entree was pork tasting consisting of pork loin and barbecue pork belly.  Those were both very good.  I had the George's Bank Scallops for my entree.  The Leek and Bacon Risotto was really amazing.  Very nice bacon flavor.\\n\\nHis dessert course was a strawberry rhubarb cobbler with vanilla ice cream.  He loved it so much that I only got a small bite, but it was really excellent.  I'm not really a fan of fruit cobbler or pies but I'd have ordered this any day.  I I had the Toasted Georgia Pecan and Walnut Pie with Spiced Forelle Pear Sorbet.   It too was awesome.  The pie crust was unusual and good; it was very flaky and had a texture similar to a puff pastry.  The sorbet's flavor was unusual but I liked it.  I'm still not sure if I feel it complements the pie filling or not, but it was good by itself.   \\n\\nThe service was all very good.  My only (minor) complaint was the long wait between my appetizer and my entree.  I attribute this, again (see my Aria review), to my date's glacially slow eating and the fact that they brought him a second first course after we had completed the appetizer we were splitting.  I get the impression that places like this try to pace your meal, letting you finish a course before bringing out the next one; little do they know that he never finishes anything.  He eats very slowly and they always end up checking back several times before asking him, \\"are you still working on that, sir?\\"  /rant\\n\\nAnyway, overall, it was an excellent night and I'd happily return -- quality food in an excellent setting."},{"name":"Sizzler","address":"3737 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"OK, It's not Morgans or Ruth Crist's.

This was no ordinary night or turn of the calendar, this evening at the Four Seasons marked something special - a farewell to his 20s. As his birthday grew near I could tell he was dreading turning the big 3-0, so I decided to make sure his last day as a 20-something was memorable. I love that my husband appreciates the finer things in a meal - good wine, steaks prepared with precision and curated ingredients  - so I knew he'd enjoy a night at Capa celebrating his impending decade changeover.\\n\\nInspired by the Basque culture, an area of northwest Spain and southwest France, Capa's cuisine is inspired by authentic Spanish offerings with a modern twist. Their diverse offerings range from fresh Florida seafood to small plates and expertly grilled cuts. An open kitchen and wood-burning grill allow you to get close to the action, while outdoor patio diners enjoy views of the nightly fireworks at both Epcot and Magic Kingdom.\\n\\nCritics alike from Wine Enthusiast to Orlando Magazine are taking note of Capa's culinary and wine expertise, so we were thrilled to try for ourselves. And now, we invite to relax, pull up a chair, as Spork Orlando proudly presents... our dinner. {Bonus points if you can name that movie quote}\\n\\nImbibing: Kudos to you Capa for starting off our night with some bubbly, which we followed up with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc from Cakebread Cellars. And yes - they serve Cakebread BY.THE.GLASS. A rare sighting on a wine list, but one that I welcomed with an open wine glass. My husband opted for the In Spanish Fashion complete with a torched orange and frozen Vermouth ice cube, which meant his glass was never watered down and increased in flavor complexity as the cube melted.\\n\\nNext up, we made our way through the Para Picar and Appetizer sections of the menu. From the finest salt to manchego cheese, we feasted on a variety of authentic tastes before our entrees. Here are some small plates and bites you must experience before the main event.\\n\\nD√°tiles: Proof that bacon makes everything taste magnifique. These bacon wrapped Medjool dates are a luxurious sweet and salty combination drizzled with a dash of maple.\\n\\nCerdo: Or in other words, pork belly. A decadent take on an often poorly prepared dish. Tender and rich, this plate will make your taste buds question everything they think they know about pork belly. Capa brings home the bacon with this take on pork belly.\\n\\nCocas: Perhaps the most unexpected dish of the night, but one I'd go back and order again without question. This flatbread is topped with smoked goat cheese, red onion and bacon, sprinkled with a side of the finest salt I've ever tasted, this para picar made quite the impression.\\n\\nCarne: Beef carpaccio sliced thinner than paper, then topped with truffle and brown butter. A melt on your tongue type dish that you wish came with seconds.\\n\\nAceitunas: There are two types of olives in this world, bad ones....and good ones. And Capa, even your olives were memorable! A super simple, no frills dish that proves Capa knows how to pick the finest ingredients for all of their dishes.\\n\\nYou could have rolled me out of Disney World at this point, but we still had more food coming. Next up....steak!\\n\\nFilet: Instead of \\"Filet Mignon\\" or \\"NY Strip\\", the steak menu names are categorized by the farms where the steaks are sourced. Their 8 oz. Prime filet was juicy and tender in all the right places and served with a parade of salsas.\\n\\nBone-In Ribeye: Aged for 40 days and packed with flavor in all it's 16 oz. glory. A steak filled with gluttony goodness.\\n\\nAnd since we were clearly starving at this point, (insert sarcasm here), we ordered dessert. Calories don't count at Disney, right? We were treated to an instant sugar high between the churros, olive oil cake and creamy ice cream. Not overly sweet, these desserts were the perfect ending to a memorable night.\\n\\nSo if we haven't convinced you already, now's the time to visit the brilliant team that is Capa. It's truly magical."},{"name":"Marakesh Cafe & Grill","address":"906 Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"This place is a joke. We came in on a busy Saturday around lunchtime and waited in line for about 30 minutes, which in the first place is far too long when there are only three groups in line in front of you. The staff was made up of three people: a rude, nonchalant cashier, a woman who I presumed was cooking, and the poor waiter, who was some sweaty dude from Russia. At least he tried to be friendly. Sadly I had the misfortune of seeing the Russian guy opening a bag of pita bread and noticed that it was the same bag I buy from my local HEB. So I'm paying $5 plus tax to eat HEB pita bread? Oh hell no. \\n\\nWe ordered our food, which the cashier said would take \\"five or ten minutes\\" to get to our table. After another 30 minutes (spent drinking only semi-cold water since the ice machine was broken - and they were out of cups) passed, two of us got our food. The hummus we ordered arrived, along with a basket that contained THREE tiny triangular pieces of Pita bread. THREE. I asked for more, and this time a decent sized portion was brought out. The hummus tasted WORSE than the kind I buy at HEB, which was really disappointing because I love hummus. How do you screw up hummus at a \\"Mediterranean/North African/whatever\\" restaurant?\\n\\nMy fiancee's food finally came, and he took a bite.

There was no one else standing around waiting for a table, and no one greeted us to say there was a wait. \\n\\nAfter about 10 minutes of sitting at the table with servers walking around us serving other tables but not even bringing a menu to us, or the couple at the table beside us who was there when we arrived, a very rude employee walked by and said we couldn't sit there as there was a wait. He didn't even stop to talk to us so I followed him to the bar to ask what he was talking about as there was no one else in the bar without a seat, and we had already been there 10 minutes.

I asked why no one bothered to tell new patrons coming in that they needed to request a table from the bar and got another very rude and unhelpful response. \\n\\nNeedless to say, we left and will not be back as long as Apothecary keeps employees like this one.

You feel like you are eating in someones nicely decorated Thai-themed dining room in a nice Oregon house.  My slight disappointment came over the som tum/papaya salad order and the lack of spiciness in all the dishes this time.  The papaya salad was kind of bland with none of the spicy/tangy flavors and toppings I've had when eating the dish in other restaurants.  I also think that when you order on the phone they must default to making the dishes mild. If you like it spicy, be sure to mention that. Be warned that the dishes can be very spicy though.

They serve liters in steins and I basically died and went to heaven when I first caught glimpse of one. They have a huge selection of craft beers, including many choices of my all time favorite seasonal, Oktoberfest.

It is in my neighborhood and I usually go pretty late in the evening - thankfully they keep the kitchen open until late! I've been served from the full menu until midnight. I love the atmosphere - lights dimmed, nice bar, varied clientele. Everyone is laid back and polite. I really like the floral touches like a small living wall of succulents tucked in the back and live orchids. They also provide comfy, homey couches with glowing lamps and have tons of board games, a friendly, sleepy bar cat that comes and goes and a jukebox with some awesome alt/indie/underground tunes. Despite the cat and couches they keep it nice and clean in there - this isn't at all a scuzzy bar, but it isn't a formal bar either - the juxtaposition of classy elements with cozy and casual really does it for me. It's the sort of place where you could just as easily enjoy a date or an intimate conversation or get a large group together and just have fun.\\n\\nThey have some pretty nice cocktails - small, delicious, strong, and with the right touch of subtle sweetness. I'm not some drink connoisseur but I don't like drinks to be overwhelmingly sweet - if I want Kool Aid I can get it a lot cheaper at Safeway. The Lombard 75 with gin and cucumber has to be one of my all time favorite drinks. Price range is about $7 - 9 for their listed cocktails which while a wee bit pinchy for those in my income bracket is ultimately a price I'm willing to pay, repeatedly. Beer is in the $4-5 range. The food selection isn't huge but what they do, they do well. I am a vegetarian and while they only have about 6 vegetarian options (and to the best of my knowledge, even fewer vegan) those options are solid and worth ordering more than once. I especially like their Eggplant panini and their bruschetta. They are definitely more bar than restaurant, so don't expect a full menu or a waiter - you order at the bar.\\n\\nThere is a really nice smoking/back area, partially covered, roomy, open to the stars with climbing rose bushes and strings of lights. It provides a quieter place to talk or relax and it's large enough that you can find a comfortable spot with good air quality even if you don't smoke.

What this competition did for Oregon was it gave and has given us some pretty unique and groundbreaking beer you can't find anywhere else around. I definitely prefer the smaller, newer breweries as I feel their beer just simply tastes better. Which is why I would think that a brewery that has been around for almost 30 years wouldn't be able to catch up with all the new and inventive small craft breweries around the state and region; most likely they'd become sellouts and mass produce shitty, low quality beer. \\n\\nNot Deschutes. \\n\\nI am CONSISTENTLY amazed with all of their beer-seasonals and regulars. Everything is top notch and high quality. Lots of effort is put into each of their brews, even though they are produced on a massive scale! I guess I have to also mention their brew pubs. The food and service are spectacular, and I've always had a good experience at both the bend and PDX locations. \\n\\nSo thank you Deschutes, keep doing what you're doing, stay inventive but don't change a BIT!"},{"name":"Uptown Park Wine Bar","address":"1784 Jake St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"GREAT customer service!

Variety is excellent with countless specialty pizzas.  Choice is king here, so you can choose your dough, type of sauce, and toppings.  There are many! Toppings are fresh and pizza-making is quick.  Pizza is made in in a deep dish fashion.  There isn't any tossing involved here because my pizza came in a perfect 12\\" round that looked like it was sitting in a pan.  I guess you call this Chicago-style.  This place doesn't have ready made pizzas sitting around waiting to be reheated, so if you want fresh pizza and can wait 10 to 15 minutes do come here, If you are a fan of Neapolitan style, you can fugghedabboudit!"},{"name":"Nikki Sushi & Steak","address":"15135 SW Barrows Rd, Ste 145","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"Just returned home after another amazing dinner at Nikki Sushi & Steak.

The server said the dish is about a medium spice, so leave out the jalapenos- even then, it was very spicy.  She nicely replaced it with a teriyaki noodle dish, which was sweet, sweet, sweet.  Great service, but would not order either of those noodle dishes again.

But I did live in England for 15 years, where I met many people from India who told me that there were better Indian restaurants there than in their country.\\nHaving said all this, I think that India House represents a good level of home-made North Indian food. Most of the dishes are subtly but well-spiced; all breads are very good, and there is one unusual dish on the menu, the Kaju (Cashew) Paneer, which is outstanding. Do try, instead of sticking to the boring and predictable Anglo favorites such as Tikka Masala or Tandoori. The carrot halva is also delicious, and if you ask for a properly spiced salt lassi it will often come even with a pinch of asafoetida.\\n\\nI just don't understand all these negative reviews. It appears that most of these people just like to complain, don't know squat about Indian food, expect to pay food cart prices at a restaurant with table cloths, napkins and proper service and ALSO get gargantuan portions. \\nAll of which is just nonsense. \\nYes, India House may not be cheap, but decent food never is, because sadly we live in a country of mass-produced junk food and that is the only cheap one.\\n\\nAlso, please do not go there for the buffet and then write a bad review. That is plain idiotic, and just reiterates the fact that you don't know squat about food.\\nI've never been to an Indian restaurant--and I've been to hundreds, in England, Canada and the US--where the buffet was in any way equal to the level of √† la carte food. It can never be, because it's cooked faster, in larger quantities, for the \\"average\\" palate (ie. less spicy and less hot), and it gets to sit there, constantly reheated, for a few hours. \\nWhat food could possibly be delicious under those conditions?"},{"name":"Vina Pho & Grill","address":"1630 30th St, Ste B","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is awesome.

Hawker's caters to a wide variety of clientele though, so don't be misled by our general assessment of the environment.  The interior is somewhat small, with about 12 tables arranged in a layout that works.  Not only do the lights and colors lend a trendy feel to the place, but you have the option to watch one of several big screen T.V.s displaying the adventures of Samantha Brown.  The staff is a solid 10 when it comes to customer service.  Nothing but pleasant smiling faces.  Our server was Michelle and she was not only attentive, but provided good recommendations. I'm no connoisseur when it comes to eastern cuisine, but I did bring my worldly Chinese sidekick to offer his opinion.\\n\\nCons: Peanut Butter does not= Szechuan cooking. The sesame chilled noodles had an overpowering taste of peanut butter.  Now to be fair, on the menu it does say they are served in a Szechuan sauce, but that doesn't lead one to believe that the taste of peanut butter is so strong and overpowering.\\n\\n           The chicken for the Cantonese Ginger Chicken was processed chicken instead of quality chicken breast.  Never the less the ginger dressing with onion kept the plate afloat.\\n\\nPros:  The Curry Laksa was definitely a tasty treat.  Boiled egg, shrimp, chicken, yow choy and fried challots in a wonderful curry coconut stew. \\n\\n           The Curry for the Roti Canai had just the slightest kick and was a great indicator of the things to come.\\n\\n           The Beef Bulgogi Sliders=A solid choice.

My family and I recently tried Banger's when visiting Austin and all I can say is that I am jealous we don't have a similar place at home. We visited on a Saturday night around 6 and were able to be immediately seated outside, although the inside seating was on a wait list. Our party of 5 was comfortably seated at one of the many community tables and were comfortable. The most uncomfortable part about the seating was the smoke wafting around from people smoking behind us. I wish they had a separate smoking section to help save our lungs. Additionally, considering how much outdoor seating they have, it would be nice if they would invest in some big outdoor fans and misters. Despite those few complaints, the outdoor seating was pleasant and we enjoyed the live music.\\n\\nNow for the food. Uh, wow! Everybody's food looked amazing. I ordered the fried chicken sausage which had mashed potatoes and cream gravy along with a honey biscuit. It was seriously life changing. The sausage was juicy, batter crispy, and gravy creamy and perfectly seasoned. For an extra side I tried the jalape√±o cream corn which was also tasty, especially with the fried frizzled onions on top. My hubby got a side of the mac and cheese though and I would definitely order it next time over the corn. Nobody in my group had a single complaint about their food and conversation came to a halt, besides the occasional \\"mmmm...\\", when our food arrived. The presentation of the food was beautiful. \\n\\nThe beer menu certainly doesn't disappoint.  With over 100 craft beers everyone is sure to find the perfect brew to compliment their sausage. I love that they offer several beer flights for those of us who are indecisive or wants to try different beers, like their Local flight. They also host different events like tap takeovers by breweries and beer festivals.\\n\\nIn summary, this place is a solid,  \\"yay, I'm a fan!\\", 4 stars.

There was hardly a soul in the restaurant, which is not surprising, considering the day and time, and since while brunch is a thing, linner (lunch + dinner) is not.\\n\\nI ended up ordering the buffalo chicken tenders as a main course dish. I wasn't spectacularly hungry, and I did not want to fill myself upon this particular time. I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the dish. I was expecting something smothered in buffalo sauce, messy, spicy, with the sauce being the only thing I could taste. This was not the case...\\n\\nThe tenders were cooked perfectly, they were actually tender, with just the right amount of crispness. The buffalo sauce was also fairly mild, and while there was certainly enough of it to add flavor, the tenders weren't swimming in it. It was more a coating than anything else really. \\n\\nI also appreciated the bleu cheese dipping sauce that came with the dish. Like the buffalo, it was fairly mild and un-overpowering, I also liked the tiny bit of chunkiness found with this sauce. \\n\\nCelery was celery, but, it did add a nice freshness and crispness to the dish!\\n\\nOverall, the meal was very good, while I wouldn't write a letter home about it, I might mention it when I call home. \\n\\nAlright, then why only three stars? There were two points that took away from the experience. \\n\\nThe first was the service... While it was very polite, I felt it could have been a touch more attentive, especially considering that the restaurant had very few other people. In terms of speed, while there were six people in my party, and one person ordered a burger (takes a while to cook, I know) I again felt with the amount of people here, it could have been a little faster.\\n\\nWhile the music was quite good, and I would not be against hearing these folks again, the second point is the loudness of the music. Please do not get me wrong, I have nothing against loud live music in a restaurant. The loudness of the music, especially where we were seated was borderline unpleasant by itself. The issue was it was impossible to hear what anyone at my table was saying. If this were a busy evening with plenty of hustle and bustle, this volume would be appropriate, and I'd have no issue. However, with it being an afternoon, and nearly no one being here, having it played at a more reasonable volume would not hurt."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Nice atmosphere.

Zechariah never came back to ask if we wanted to order food, ever. Finally when Zechariah brought the checks for the table I advised that I did not receive a bill. Zechariah walked over to the other end of the table and said here is your bill. At this point the lights were on and people were leaving.  I could have left too w/o paying, but I have integrity.  I gave Zechariah my credit card, he snatched it and when he came back with the receipt holder and my credit card Zechariah flung it at me and walked away. \\n\\nEveryone at my table felt the same rude and disrespectful service provided by Zechariah.

What a great way to impress the diners at the beginning of the meal!  The chicken liver pate was superb, and the oysters were some of the finest I've enjoyed in Atlanta - they were on par with the masterful presentation you would expect at The Optimist, for example.  Entrees followed with savory steaks, salmon, and homemade pastas - each one suitable for service to the most discriminating foodie.  My salted caramel and homemade cracker jack sundae was one of the nicest restaurant desserts I've ever enjoyed - my mouth is watering remembering this sublime creation!\\n\\nAnother unique trait at Canoe is the beautiful location on the banks of the Chattahoochee. Views of the rapids and looking across to The Lovett School is an elegant and peaceful way to enjoy the night.  I *highly* recommend being seated before it is pitch black (realize that this is tough in the winter months) - the view here is a real asset.\\n\\nLighting is a difficult challenge here at Canoe.  To maintain the intimate and luxurious environment, they have *extremely* subdued lighting.  For two people on a date in their early thirties, this is no problem.  Our party had 5 senior citizens, who literally couldn't see a thing.  The waitstaff had to lend flashlights just to see the menus.  When we ordered, flashlights had to be returned to the servers so they could write our orders and look at the menu/wine list.  This single factor diminished my rating from 5-stars, to 4-stars.

Unfortunately, when I got home, somehow, the bags had been switched and I had someone else's order that was a) more expensive and b) completely different. BUMMER!\\n\\nI called them and a different man told me to bring it back, they would make my order fresh and credit my card for the amount. So an hour later, I had the correct order and the man (manager or maybe owner) was very apologetic. \\n\\nThe following items we ordered were excellent(!): crazy maki, una-avo maki, and spicy tuna maki. fresh and flavorful. We also had a side of teriyaki chicken which was great and NOT super dry which many tend to be due to overcooking. The edamame was good as well - hard to screw up. The gyoza was ok, not the best I've ever had...not too flavorful, a bit limp, and kinda small (but maybe that's just my Americanism and they were actually the correct size....). \\n\\nI will definitely eat Oga's food again.

First impression: Capo looks scarily like Lincoln, the other restaurant owned by the same Managment, and unfortunately it is as loud as the other restaurant.The menu doesn't offer a huge variety of options and revolves around their home-made pasta and brick-oven pizza. We opted for some antipasto, which was ok nothing special, and a pizza which was ok. What pissed me off was the fact that they have a wood burning-oven and they didn't bother to put the bread in it and served it warm. It would have been a perfect combination with the antipasto. The one they served us was pretty chewy and not really fresh. I shared a burrata too, which was decent. Nothing special again but I am Italian and I am biased when it comes to burrata, antipasto, and in general Italian food. As a main dish almost all of us got the home-made pasta. I ordered the bolognese. The sauce was surprisingly good but the pasta was very chew and doughy. I do make home-made pasta and I can tell you that was not. For dessert I was bold enough to try their cannoli. Surprisingly they were the best ones I've had in Boston so far. Lastly, our server was super annoying and treated us like a bunch of teenagers who were out for their first time. Not cool as much as the fact that at certain point the fire alarm went off. The owner was clearly embarrassed and very apologetic. Therefore our server said to us: \\"desert are on the house\\" but only two out of 4 deserts we ordered were served to our table. On top of that the deserts were charged in our bill.

I guess we'll head out for lunch... I heard a radio advert on the way home regarding Jack Allen's Kitchen.  So we decided to check them out.  Just a small correction to the ad on the radio.. Oak Hill is not South Austin.. it's Oak Hill... just saying.\\n\\nSince we live in the hood we know that  this is the third incarnation of this doomed restaurant location... but as one reviewer said before..this building may have found a permanent home as Jack's Place.  The space inside has a great feel to it.. open and spacious with a private dining area to have meetings and seats which allows you to look out over a green belt area.  Outside patio and bar looks really nice as well.\\n\\nFor lunch I ordered the BLATT, Turkey sammy with Avocado, Bacon, Tomato and Lettuce.  It was fine, but I was surprised it was served on a homemade bun... I was really expecting toast like a traditional BLT, since the crunchyness of toast would have paired well with the softness of the avocado and grilled turkey.  Sweet potato fries were very good on par with Black Sheep's which are my favorite so far.  Suzie was well into her wine at this point and ordered the flounder fish tacos in Jerk Spice and Slaw.

The staff was very friendly, however I felt that their attentiveness did not match accordingly. That is not to say that they were severely lacking, but it did not stand out as much as their welcoming attitude. For instance, as I feel like I must justify my reasoning, my water was not refilled the entire meal. Though the glasses are very tall and I didn't find myself really lacking until the end, it's the same to me either way.\\n\\nFor breakfast, my girlfriend and I both got a breakfast combo. I got a pancake, two scrambled eggs, and potatoes, and she got two French toast, scrambled eggs, and bacon. The food was brought out quickly and neatly on nice square and rectangular plates. Though I've heard of their flavored offerings of pancakes and French toast, we chose the originals. The pancake was as large as the plate and had a nice crisp outer shell with a warm fluffy center; cooked wonderfully. Likewise, the French toast was just as good. The eggs, potatoes, and bacon were all standard fare with no complaints or anything of special note. They were all cooking fine with adequate seasoning. \\n\\nOverall, the breakfast was good. It's hard to rain down praises on Keke's aside from their pancakes and French toast, but at the same time, I struggle to find any real faults. Their service is ok, their food is good, and their prices, while on the slight up slope of breakfast joints, fits their atmosphere. I would recommend choosing them for breakfast if you're in the area as they're a safe bet with good food, especially for their pancakes, but at the same time, don't go expecting to be blown out of the water. You can, however, expect a more than satisfactory breakfast at fairly reasonable prices with fairly good service.

The place was ridiculously packed with parties of bachelorettes and families.  A mad house!  There wasn't any room for me at the bar (as it also serves as a waiting room).  *sad face*  But I have to say, while I waited patiently, I remained entertained by the Teppenyaki masters, apprentices, and ... whatever, well, you know, those guys with the crazy colored hats.\\n\\nThe food was definitely makin the tummy growl, but when I finally got home to enjoy my sashimi dinner including like 18 pieces of raw fish, miso soup, and a side salad, I was delightfully satisfied by a fresh tasty fish selection.  Bravo, Bisuteki, for satisfying my starving belly with decent sushi.\\n\\nOf course I'm going back for Teppenyaki, but not without first reserving a seat!

It's pretty simple to enjoy this place when you consider the history.   They started the clever signs on tip jars in Austin.  You know things like, \\"Tipping is not a place in China\\" or \\"Just put the tip in and see how it feels\\". They definitely invented the kick butt frozen ritas, affectionately know as Mad Dog Margaritas by Guy Clark.  In a time when Jorge's Mexican was trying to replicate them with Everclear wanna bees...   If I were you I would go for the Chili and get some of the Enchilada's.  Get the chili sampler and try the 3X, you know you want to, so just do it and take a slug off that Mad Dog sitting in front of you.  The enchiladas are greasy, cheesy and old school.  Don't ask for vegan or gluten free, head somewhere else for that drivel.  Go to the restroom, read and add some words to the great graffiti you will find there, perhaps something like, \\"The future is in your hands\\" or \\"If you ever feel powerless, just remember one of your pubic hairs can shut down an entire restaurant\\".  Better still, walk in and sit at the bar.  Take in all the stuff on the back wall, visit with their great bartenders and watch a game on the telly.

From the food to beer to atmosphere to servers... it's possibly one of the best breweries I've ever been too.\\n\\nThe only downside to this place is you will have to wait at least 30-45 mins and maybe even longer if you have a big party. They have a bar where you can just walk in and order drinks while you wait but let me tell you it's worth the wait. \\n\\nWe ordered the Pretzel appetizer with the spicy mustard dip (MUST ORDER THIS!) it was so delicious and I've never had anything like it. Got the spicy chicken and waffles which was so savory and not too sweet. I would ask for the syrup on the side, but otherwise it was on point. And also the mac and cheese with chicken and truffle. It tasted more like alfredo but still good and you get a decent portion. As for the beer, I would recommend ordering a flight and you get to choose 6 beers of your choice. If you don't know what to get, I'd ask the server because they are very knowledgeable and their recommendations for me were very good.\\n\\nThe service was quick and they were attentive and attractive (had to put it out there) This place obviously get busy and it can get pretty loud so don't expect an intimate dinner here.

Pretty much nothing's changed.  Marios is a very unpretentious place.  Adjust your expectations to to match their prices!  They definitely serve \\"comfort\\" Italian food, heavy flavors with a lot of meat and cheese.  \\n\\nThe Marios formula: Carb (ravioli, spaghetti, lasagna noodle, etc) + Lots of homemade marinara sauce + meat + lots of cheese. \\nI'm not much of a cheese connoisseur so I have no idea what kind of cheese they use on their dishes--but it not a fancy cheese.\\n\\nEverything on the menu is pretty basic; if you can't make it with carb/sauce/meat/cheese, the probably don't have it.\\n\\nMy go-to dish is the Chicken Parm with Ravioli.  Lunch price ($8.99 for lunch, $10.99 at dinner for the same thing) is a steal for the portions they give!  I can get 2 medium-sized meals if I don't stuff myself.  (People say chipotle burritos are 2 meals, but they really aren't.  This dish is ACTUALLY 2 meals worth). \\n\\nI've also had their pizza, calzones, and lasagna.  Lasagna is your comfort lasagna: heavy on the sauce flavor and pretty simple.  I'm actually a fan of their pizza and I think their calzones are solid.  I don't like Bertucci's and Upper Crust's thinner, dryer crusts, so if you like those kinds of pizzas, Marios may not be for you.  Their crusts are thicker but not super mushy and soaked in grease like some other pizza places.  Also, some of my friends who prefer Bertucci to Marios say that Marios' marinara sauce is too sweet.  I have to agree that it is a little on the sweet side, but the meat sauce is definitely less sweet. The sauces are supposed to be homemade.  Whether you like sweetness in the sauce will be a matter of preference. \\n\\nService is decent; no complaints.  The last time I was here the waitress was super eager (some might say, overly eager/bordering on hovering) to get us water, check on how were we liking the food, and whether we wanted the check.  She came over repeatedly, perhaps 7-9 times.  I dont think she was rushing to get us out the door though.

My boyfriend and I were taking my best friend there since he had never been before. The wait wasn't so bad since they were efficiently bringing people in and seeing them out. When we got seated we waited for about 10 minutes before we were acknowledged. The server got our drinks in and then waited about another 30 minutes. We were talking about several things we had planned for the day so the waiting didn't seem that bad. The wait didn't seem eternal until we noticed tables around us being cleared and new customers were being seated. We counted 3 tables that were seated and services, I mean drinks and actual entrees, before we even drink our food order in. Finally the server comes and unapologetically asks what we'd like. We decide to order thinking the pace was improving, boy were we wrong. The food took about 45 minutes to come out. I'm sure it took longer actually because we decided to walk out. A manager walked by our table and I tried in as loud yet pleasant of a voice to get her attention. She was walking about 4 feet away from me and still ignored me. She turned her head and blatantly tuned my table out. Some might say the place was just \\"too busy\\" for my friends and I. Some may say it's a race thing since we were the only minorities in there.

If you're pulling up and you see three cars in line (this includes the car at the drive-thru window), you're going to be waiting 28 minutes (three cars and your own ... that's four).  \\n\\nI don't like reviewing fast food places because judging a place that hires high school kids is patently unfair - but the contrast between this Taco Bell and the Wendy's across the street is stark. Wendy's (whose commercials remind you of annoying people who are looking for excuses to double- and triple-text you like we get it you can be funny but relax for five freaking seconds dude) actually does everything right when it comes to German Village fast food options. Service is impeccable, the drive-thru line moves quickly, it's easy to pay for food (read that again and marvel at its noteworthiness) and you always get everything you ordered.\\n\\nThe German Village Taco Bell has to be the most horrendously managed fast food place in the country. I get it. Every community has a \\"worst\\" fast food place that people love to rip on, sometimes unfairly. Not this place. All complaints are warranted. I've lived in German Village since the mid-2000s and this place has remained THEEEEEE worst during that entire period. I'm not entirely sure what is going on. Before writing this review, I noticed some people gave this place positive remarks. These individuals must be actual Taco Bell employees or relatives of management. \\n\\nYou know how you will sometimes go to a place (German Village Chipotle or German Village Taco Bell) and want to WRITE THAT PLACE A LETTER about how awful everything about it is? Obviously, no one ever actually does that but German Village Taco Bell has pushed me closest to the brink. I just cannot - for the life of me - get over how terrible this location remains. How on earth has there never been a reality show made about fixing this place up?? It's THAT bad. The only thing worse is when you got stuck with a partner who didn't use deodorant or tooth paste in sophomore chemistry in high school when you were SO close to being the guy paired with the hottest chick in the class. It's awful. \\n\\nLike there should be a show with The Rock (I don't know if he has any fast food experience, I have never read any of his biographies) and The Rock goes into fast food places and gives pep talks and everything turns around and one of the employees turns his or her life around and someone cries at the end during an emotional TESTIMONIAL.\\n\\nWe all remember December 2015 as the month when \\"BOSS NACHOS\\" from Taco Bell were all the rage. Will and I used to love going to bars and making an order for \\"BOSS NACHOS\\" and just seeing what they served us (I miss the nachos at Eddie George's on campus ... too much sour cream, yes, but the overall presentation and taste hit every spot imaginable).\\n\\nThe Boss Nachos at German Village Taco Bell came in a gigantic garbage-bag looking thing. \\n\\nTrash. Yes.\\n\\nNOTE: I had to look up the spelling of \\"trough\\" on Google and the first thing that popped up were urinal troughs. They are like $1,700 for a low-end model. Seems like money not well spent. Surprising."},{"name":"The Rumpus Room","address":"2301 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The sesame ginger fries area mindblowingly good. They're to die for; almost certainly the best basket of fries I've had in the city, maybe in my life.

Okay, now that that's out of the way: the rest of the food was very good too! We also had corndogs that felt fancy, if that's somehow possible, and a salad with chicken that was brimming with fruity flavours and crunch. We also got a Rose French 75 and the Long Island ice tea, both pretty decent. I definitely want to come back and try their more signature dishes. And get more sesame ginger fries.\\n\\nThe place is small and unmarked from the outside, but the staff are friendly, food arrives quickly, and it has a nice eclectic, vintage vibe.

Some of you may instantly recall this smell. Otherwise, please move along. HAHA\\nI ordered a house salad with blue cheese to start. Right away I became disappointed because the lettuce was extremely wilted and limp. I assume the salad had been pre-made and just sitting in the fridge? I dunno.\\nI ordered off the children's menu for my son since my husband and I were getting ribs and steak and knew he wouldn't be eating that. We got the grilled chicken tenders with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes came out and were a bit too spicy for my son. Plus, they were very \\"gummy\\" due to being overmashed. I can thank shows like Master Chef for teaching me the concept of not over-mashing your potatoes. \\nJust a heads up: Kids meals need to have less spice than the adult meal. Or else, like in our case, it won't get eaten. And then you waste money.\\nThe tenders were ok.. once again a little too much spice added to them.\\nI ordered the top sirloin because that was the special and everyone in our party was getting it and it sounded great. I got it with the sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were the best part of the meal. The steak was extremely hard to chew and I ended up spitting a lot of it out due to a lot of extra fat in the cut itself. \\nAll in all I just wanted impressed with the food based on what the restaurant prides itself on. Obviously I missed out on some better options?? \\nI do want to say the service was great and I was attended to well.

The lot is pretty tiny for one that's shared by two places but we came at a time they weren't too busy (now half way through our meal the place filled up). We were seated quickly/greeted promptly, and the waiter came by to grab our drink orders. We had several people bring our food by, and everyone was willing to pitch in whenever we needed something. The food comes out as it's ready but they warn you of that from the beginning.\\nThe small plates design is genius, I love getting to sample a few different things when testing a place out for the first time. The menu here was quite extensive and ranged in price and size of the dishes. Also, love how easy it was to understand which dishes were vegetarian (it can get tricky at times). I quite enjoyed my five spice tofu, and LOVED the Chinese Kale or Yow Choy way more than I thought I would. The standout for me though... the Roti Canai. The sauce was perfectly spicy and delicious. It is quite a trek to get here, but I definitely want to come back. The food and service were on point and for the amount of food we got the tab was reasonable. They did mess up on one of our dishes, but that happens, especially since the kitchen got so many orders at once (we got a five spice chicken and a jerk chicken wings, the the wing came out with five spice too- but it was an easy mistake).

Neil Kiley, owner of the Fat Cat Caf√© in Quincy, put together an excellent concept, menu, and staff.\\n\\nThe first time I went in there was to have a few beers after a meeting.  The atmosphere was good, they have plenty of craft beers, and the service was good.\\n\\nThe second time my girlfriend and I decided on a whim to grab a bite after work and chose Passport.  The menu is pretty cool as it separates the four types of tapas.   Teasers (basically an appetizer for one), Tasters (appetizer for two), Smalls (appetizer for the table or meal for one), and Shares (Meal for two). \\n\\nAfter a drink and looking at the menu we decided to get a few items off the taster and smalls sections to share.  The very helpful waiter explained to us what some of the items were and we decided on the mussels diablo, short rib bolognese, and bacon and corn Mac & Cheese.  The mussels were very good and had a nice kick to them.  The short rib Bolognese is an interesting take on a traditional dish.  Very good and from what we were told one of their best sellers.  The bacon and corn Mac & Cheese was unbelievable.  I couldn't stop eating it. It's a very tasty mixture of cheese, cream from the corn, the corn itself, and perfectly cooked high quality bacon. Quite possibly the best Mac & Cheese I have ever had.\\n\\nThe third time I went there was with my girlfriend, sister, and her boyfriend.  We grabbed a few drinks over at Fore Square, another favorite of ours and where I had my birthday dinner last year, and then walked down to Passport for dinner.  We got seated after about fifteen minutes.  We used that fifteen to grab a drink and show my sister and her boyfriend the menu.\\n\\nWhen we were seated we ordered empanadas, the Steak Frites, the pork tostada with mango BBQ sauce, the bacon and corn Mac & Cheese, and the charcuterie plate.\\n\\nThe empanadas were pretty good.  I'm not a big fan of empanadas to begin with but the table seemed to like them.  The steak frites was cooked to medium rare perfection.  The fires that came with the steak were super thin, crunchy, and sprinkled with truffle oil.  The pork tostada was fantastic.  You could tell a lot of time went in to putting the dish together from cooking the pork to scratch making the sauce.  The bacon and corn Mac & Cheese didn't disappoint.  I had raved about it heading in there and everyone at the table was sold. The charcuterie plate was also very good.  Not your typical meats.  They had two different takes on salami and prosciutto, duck, and crusted parmesan that was fantastic.\\n\\nThe bill wasn't too bad and everyone left having enough food and drink to call it a dinner.  Sharing is one of the best parts about Passport.  If you're not happy with one thing, move to the other.  However, I must say I don't think you will not be happy with much.\\n\\nThis is a great edition to the Landing.  With Fore Square and El Sarape up the street the Landing is becoming a destination for good times, good food, and good drinks.  Obviously the eyesore that is the Delegas properties remain a problem but it shouldn't detract from the outstanding quality restaurant Neil Kiley has created in Weymouth.  I highly suggest checking out Passport."},{"name":"Dosa n Curry","address":"447 Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"The worst Indian food I have had in boston.

She was very rude and unwelcoming and when handing over my food I attempted to make her day better with some words of encouragement and was shot down with combative language and she slammed the window shut. \\nAs a person who loves good service and someone who works in customer service, it's discouraging when people take out their bad mornings on others. I hope I can return to this same establishment and see the same employee for a better experience. We are human, we have our good days and bad days. Mohini was probably just having a bad day. Best regards. \\n\\n2 stars for the food and correcting our order. Lack of 5 stars for our customer experience experience that could have been better.

Our Son was taking my Husband out to dinner for his Birthday. He picked Smashburger as we like the food (2 previous occasions) and not to expensive for our Son. What a mistake! What was suppose to be a joyous occasion turned into a nightmare because of one employee.\\n  We were enjoying our time after dinner and I was holding my electronic ecig. (VAPOR ONLY) She came up to us and loadly announced it was illegal to smoke those in a restaraunt. Big mistake on her part as I have been smoke free for over a year, I am a huge advicate of promoting the Ecig to help others quit as well. I am well versed on the subject, I have all the current information, laws (local & nation wide), hazards (NONE) and everything else. So when she was making a specticle of herself stating it was against Smashburger's policy and against the law. I asked for a manager, I waited and waited for the manager to appear. No such luck, I had to hunt her down. (pretty sure Steyphanie never told her I was waiting to speak to her). She told me that the manager was looking up the law that stated I could not smoke my electronic cig in a restaurant. Oh, then she (the manager) was busy, I said I will wait. Finally I got another employee to get the manager. The Manager came out and said there was no such law nor was there a store policy of NOT having electronic ecig. So she was apologetic but the damage was done as every patron, every employee had to witness this dissaster she caused. Completely ruin of what was suppose to be a Birthday Dinner and celebration. So, would I go back? Yes probably if I get a formal apology and if I enter and see this Employee I will leave. As far as the food, I thought it was amazing all three times we have been there.

I'm glad we got there when we did because once they did open the door, every table inside was full. They had a few small tables outside but they also filled up fast. It is a small place inside a strip mall, and feels like a diner. They don't have a hostess stand or take reservations, but do have their own parking lot! Waiting probably wouldn't take very long because they bring the food out fast and turn tables pretty quickly. Be sure to get there early!\\n\\nEverything we ordered had generous portions. I opted for the two egg platter: scrambled eggs, ginger and sage sausage, fruit (instead of grits without an up-charge. This isn't advertised on the menu, but they'll let you do it if you ask) and a massive biscuit. Be sure to ask for the homemade jam- goes great with the biscuit. Everything was good, but my eggs were a little runny, but the server brought out another set and they were cooked well. I also didn't finish my biscuit and brought it home with a side of the jam. It was good leftover! I didn't care too much for the sausage, but wanted to give it a try. Next time I'll opt for bacon!\\n\\nMy boyfriend opted for the steak and egg tacos and he loved them. But he thought 3 tacos was a little too much, and ended up eating the inside of the taco and leaving the tortilla behind. I tried a bite and they were really good, but not something I'd order myself. They came with a lime sauce (tomatillo, we think) that really enhanced the flavor. His dish came with the potatoes, which were homemade and tasty, but were a little too soggy for his liking. No crispy texture like you'd get at other places. \\n\\nHis parents opted for the Eggs Benedict and enjoyed them. They came with fruit cups on the side: fresh strawberries, red grapes, blueberries and pineapple. After we finished eating, my boyfriend's mom said this is probably her new favorite place in Atlanta. When she comes back in town, we will probably come back here for some early morning grub.\\n\\nBefore your food comes out, they bring an appetizer with two small cinnamon rolls and two small muffins (not sure what kind but they have nuts), all homemade. Helps hold you over while enjoying coffee until the food hits the table. And they'll bring more out if you ask.\\n\\nWhile we were dining, we got a look at other dishes. The biscuits and gravy looked really unappetizing to me: tons of brown gravy over two huge biscuits (when I say massive, I mean one biscuit here is equal to 2-3 regular biscuits). I'm not a huge fan of gravy to begin with, so I probably won't order that. The breakfast burrito is also huge and could easily serve two.

Regardless, as a group we were still planning to tip in total. Robert snapped on my two friends calling them very rude for not tipping and going on about it. I was took aside by this. Although he had only said a few words to us, he continued by saying how kind and deserving he was of the tip when obviously this was not the case. We shrugged it off and decided maybe we'll just talk to the manager later and sat down at our table. He decided to then approach us at our table and told us how complaining to anyone would be silly because he was the co owner. We then asked to speak to his parents, the owners, who were also working and he bluntly refused, multiple times. He told us they were \\"too busy salsa dancing.\\" We tried to express to him how we felt mistreated and he continued to talk above us using curse words and very rude language.

It just went further downhill as the night went on.\\n\\nEverything that came was sugary sweet, which was very puzzling.  The spicy sauce on the rolls was ultra sweet and not spicy at all.  The fried shrimp skewers somehow tasted like maple syrup, and so did the bacon wrapped scallops.  All of the hot food items we ordered came cold - ice cold.  Even the hot sake tasted lukewarm at best.  And the beer was not cold.  Was their motto to prepare everything at room temperature?  The sushi rolls were below average, and fell apart as soon as they came in contact with your chopsticks.\\n\\nService was super slow, and it took an average of 5 reminders before anything is ever done or refilled.

I added some Sriacha but it would have been better with flavor actually cooked into the meat. My son loved the beef though (actually, he loved all the food, rolling his eyes with each bite).  The pork noodles were very good - the noodles were chewy but not doughy, the spice level was perfect for us.

But when I opened my burger, I saw some unexpected generosity. Two other people at my table ordered their burgers without red onion slices.

When these tables began paying their bills and leaving we inquired about our food, as it had been over an hour since we ordered. We were told it was on its way, but had to ask again about 10 minutes later. Since we had all ordered meza plates, most of the food was already prepared and just had to be put on plates, but it still took at least 15 more minutes for all of our food to arrive. We concluded that our order had gotten lost and they scrambled to put it together only after we inquired about our food for the second time. When we asked one of the waitresses what had happened, she just mumbled something about orders getting backed up in the kitchen and offered no apology. When we asked for more bread (since one small pita does not feed four very hungry people) one of the waitresses said she would bring some right away, but we then watched her walk out the back door of the restaurant without mentioning the request to anyone else. \\n\\nIn summary: despite the fact that the restaurant was only about half full, it took nearly 2 hours from the time we sat down until we were served our food, and we were only able to order when we asked to, and only received our food when we asked for the second time. No one admitted that there had been a mistake even when we asked, no apology was offered, and nothing was removed from our bill to remedy the error."},{"name":"Rude Dog Bar & Grill Polaris","address":"8711 Sancus Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"Awful place!! went there at noon during my lunch hour  .

Great selection of taps for a small place, with a couple of rotating ones to keep it seasonal.  Food menu looked very good.  American classic style, so lots of old fashioned sandwiches(hot and cold), salads, and a few daily specials.

It's a franchise owned and operated by Boston University (in Warren Towers, where the Taco Bell used to be), and at times you can tell: the staff all work for BU, not Starbucks...so they don't get the same training as at a regular Starbucks, and they're not subject to the same quality control standards. Most of the time, the drinks come out fine...but sometimes, there are problems. If you get a latte, check how heavy the cup feels when you pick it up...it may look full, but if it doesn't feel as heavy as it should, they over-foamed your milk. If you were to leave it sitting untouched for five minutes and then check it again, you'll find the cup half-empty after the milk settles. Those are the sort of issues this location goes through. Also, by afternoon the pastry case will be half-empty and not restocked with afternoon items, like the way a regular Starbucks strives to keep the case always full and replaces the breakfast items with dessert items by around midday. They have a very limited selection of beans (only what's on the shelves), because this location is strictly a \\"grab a coffee and go\\" place.\\n\\nThe milk stations are frequently dirty with overflowing trash. If you're extra skittish about germs, be aware that I've frequently noticed employees scooping ice with beverage cups, instead of using the scoop according to health department requirements. I've never considered it important enough to report them for, but I am aware they're doing it the wrong way...so consider yourself warned. And the bathroom key is often left right on the counter...that's a little gross.\\n\\nThis location accepts BU meal plan \\"Convenience Points.\\" That means that between class breaks it's VERY full with students, because they can have mommy and daddy pay for their ridiculously overpriced $5 beverages simply by showing their student ID card.

The sushi is ok, but the Korean is their strong suit. I eat in and take out often. The bibimbap is good, but I only get it when I eat in because you can get it in a stone pot. They pre-cook the egg, which is a bit disappointing because it's always fun to see how hot your stone pot really is by watching the raw egg cook up right. The kimchi chigae is also delicious, and this is usually what I get when I take out. Take out is great because they pack up all the side dishes as well, in these cute little mini take-out containers, so you don't miss out on any of the goodness by taking out.

Usually it's a great chance to try a new place and add it to the rotation, but we won't be back.\\n\\nThe Squeeze:\\nThe reservation had been made some time in advance for our group, yet somehow we still ended up squeeeeeezed into a table right up against the wall. It simply isn't a comfortable amount of room when you have a hard time even maneuvering to put your coat on the back of your chair before you sit. And don't eat too much, you won't be able to get up.\\n\\nThe Wait:\\nYou wouldn't think it would take 45 mins to get your first course, but you'd be wrong. 6 salads and 3 small artichoke dips took exactly that long, by which point I was ready to eat the tablecloth. Granted, it was to be expected that they would be busy and that our orders would take a little longer for a party of 9. And I would have been a little more understanding, if the chef wasn't personally serving meals to the party of ~10 people in a private room off to the side.\\n\\nNothing makes you feel quite so important as watching a clearly preferred group get service par excellence while you're wondering if anyone is ever going to come around and fill the water glasses. All told, the dinner took 2.5 hours. For that length of time, I would have expected an 8-course meal served to us, not salads, entrees, and desserts.\\n\\nThe Food:\\nI can forgive a lot if the food is good. It wasn't. When the entrees came out, the first thing one of our dining companions remarked was that her bison meatloaf was cold. Fresh food -- cold. One person's entree was forgotten entirely and he had to wait 10 minutes for one to be whipped up. My husband's shrimp and grits tasted like someone had described the concept of the dish to someone, who prepared it without any soul or flair. If anything had been added to the grits for flavor, it was not apparent in the slightest.\\n\\nMy pasta was worse than anything I could make at home. Undercooked Brussels sprouts (hope you like chewing forever), tasteless bits of raw tomato, bland sauce, huge chunks of undercooked red onions, and way too much blue cheese. Hell, if the menu had listed blue cheese in the dish -- a polarizing ingredient -- I'd have gotten something else entirely. I generally believe you should let the chef prepare a dish as intended and not pick it apart to nothingness, but the menu should clearly reflect all ingredients so diners can make an informed choice. Still, the blue cheese wouldn't have been so overwhelming if there was ANY of the smoked tomato flavor that was promised in the description.\\n\\nThe Selection:\\nIt was Restaurant Week. There was a set menu posted online when we made our decision to try Harold's. Nearly half of it was unavailable when we got there. The lobster bisque was absent from the first course menu with no explanation, but you could order it from the main menu and it's still listed online as an option. The desserts listed online were unavailable, the menu stickered over with new options. Of those 4 options, 1 was already sold out. When the dessert course finally rolled around, our poor waitress had to come inform us that the dessert half the table had ordered was ALSO unavailable.\\n\\nAnd good god when the desserts came it was ABSURD. Minutes after watching the chef walk by our table with a large tray of martini glasses filled with lovely chocolate mousse, out came our desserts -- the saddest, most miserly portions I've ever seen. The carrot cake and cheesecake had been sliced so laughably thin, I couldn't help but wonder if we had been served the ghost of dessert. Imagine a slice of cake about the width of quarter at its widest point, tapering to nearly-translucence. You know how carrot cakes are designed so that each slice gets a lovely little frosting carrot? It makes it very obvious when the cake is sliced too thinly and each person only gets a small portion of a carrot that this is not how the cake was intended to be served.\\n\\nThe waitress had made a point of mentioning earlier that they had not ordered enough desserts, and it was very evident that they had taken 4 portions worth of dessert and stretched them over 9 people. It was the spoiled cherry on top of the crap sundae. Thank god we were with friends we don't see often and enjoyed their company, or it'd have been an awful, prolonged experience with mediocre food.\\n\\nThe Positive:\\nNot everything was bad. For all that the desserts barely existed, they were actually good, and I enjoyed my cocktail. That's really all.\\n\\nSummary:\\nThere are people who frown upon negative Yelp reviews. You're labelled a hater for being honest, for letting other diners know about your dining experience. Some act as if it's your obligation to contact the manager and attempt to seek resolution that way.\\n\\nWrong. There is no resolution for an overwhelmingly bad experience.

And when I say we waited an hour I don't mean we waited in line or to be seated I mean from the time we ordered our food to the time it arrived 50 minutes past.  While this is common practice in bars that serve food where the emphasis is on alcoholic drinks The practice being the longer you are there the more you will purchase alcohol means serving times for food are increased to help you stay there longer and make more purchases of alcohol. this shouldn't be a common practice in restaurants that have bars in them.  If you're going to run a restaurant that has a bar in it don't treat the restaurant and its patrons as if they are all there to consume alcohol.  I personally don't drink and I wasn't at Bangerz to drink I was there to eat but I had to wait a ridiculous amount of time for the food as if I was going to purchase alcohol in the meantime.   of course if anyone from Bangerz is reading this they're probably going to say it takes time to make good food but in my defense we mostly had hot dogs and if it takes you an hour to put together a hot dog and an order of fries then you really don't belong in the restaurant business. And at the time of our visit they were not busy they literally only had 4  tables sitted before us.  also on a side note After requesting a table inside we were told we have to sit outside even though numerous tables we're still available in the inside dining area. In fact there was only one group sitted inside at the time of our arrival.  they did not give us an explanation why we had to be seated outside we were simply told there was no other option and that led to a deduction of an entire star in my review.    I almost feel like we were forced to sit outside because they knew we were not going to be drinking and they want to reserve all of the space next to the bar for those who are going to be drinking which is completely unfair in my opinion.   With my griping and disapproval of restaurants being treated like bars out of the way the food was quite tasty and we were filled to the top before paying a $75 bill for two hot dogs, one sausage and fries, one salad and 3  Iced Teas and one Diet Coke. all of the above was served in an elevated manner but I think $75 for hot dogs is a little much I would have been much more comfortable in a return visit if the bill would have been closer to like $40 Maybe  $50 tops. If you include tip and parking we spent right at $100 to eat hot dogs LOL.  Of course you are also going to see a whole slew of four and five stars reviews for this restaurant but I have noticed a weird Trend wear and when bars are a factor people's Judgment of food service Etc seemed to diminish to a point where it is almost non-existent and the four and five star phenomena of over appreciating high-priced and in some cases but not this one low quality food reign supreme.   All in all with all things considered they definitely deserve a three-star Maybe  4 stars which I would have totally given a 4 STAR review if I hadn't Had to wait an hour for my food end it would probably have been a 5-star review if I hadn't been forced to sit outside with no explanation why.  And most certainly  JL foodie certified Mark of approval if I didn't have to spend $100 for hot dogs :-)\\n\\n why 3 stars and not 4:  don't get me started just read the review. \\n\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n*Poor *Decent *Good *great *Best *JLFoodie Certified\\n\\nFood.

I got the lamb shawarma plate and the Baklava. The meat was perfectly spiced and cooked. I've had problems with shawarma in the past being a tad dry (esp lamb), but not today! It was moist, flavorful, and atop the most amazing pilaf. Buttery and so savory (just the way I LOVE it!)... At first I was a little bummed the plate didn't come with any tzatziki, but it wasn't even needed given the plate came with an amazingly fresh salad that was tossed in a perfectly-paired vinaigrette. I'm picky with my vinaigrettes too; if they're too sweet or unnecessarily bitter, it's a no go. Thankfully, the dressing was light, flavorful, and had just the right acidity to bring out all the best flavors in everything! All this served up with a pita (admittedly a little flimsy pita, but with everything else you get for under $10, I'm SO not phased! More on this later). I finished up the experience with the most delicate baklava I could have asked for (and I did, to the tune of $3.99). Again, I was not let down! It's obviously fresh; the philo was lightly crisp and the bottom was anything but heavy. Mass-produced baklava bums me out because it's very heavy, but Dunya's was far from that! Light, sweet, crispy, slightly chewy, and not overbearing - it was the perfect end to what turned out to be a very great meal!\\n\\nOk, so if that all wasn't a glowing enough review, consider the following: I moved to Boston, MA from Tucson, AZ, the land of cheap rent and cheap food. I was used to getting my Greek and Lebanese food fix from places that were hit and miss and I would never pay less than $13 for a plate of Shawarma. Dunya delivers (BONUS!), their food is beyond amazing (DOUBLE BONUS!), and I paid $18 for a dinner plate, baklava, delivery fee, and 20% tip (HOLY NOT-TOO-EXPENSIVE-TOTALLY-EFFING-WORTH-IT BATMAN!!!!).

They even had a bar at the end of the building if you wanted to get your drink on.\\n\\nAdditionally a Cheers bar was down a flight of steps and featured dining, drinking and a gift shop.  Outside were tables and kiosks and more shopping.  \\n\\nWhile the inside is all food, the outside features art to jewelry and everything in between.  A mall was in the building right behind the Market and the Harbor was a very short walk.  \\n\\nAt the time of our visit there were tons of different talent outside giving us a free show.  We saw break dancers and other performers throughout the day.  \\n\\nThe market appeared to be located in the center of town so it was nice to see the wide range of architecture.  Old buildings and skyscrapers were within view.\\n\\nA must see for anyone visiting Boston, it was the highlight of my trip."},{"name":"Sam Snead's Oak Grill and Tavern","address":"1801 Maitland Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Sam Sneads is a little spot I like to go to with friends late at night when I'm looking for a place with good food but that's not super crowded. They have wonderful service and their prices are very reasonable. I have yet to have a dish that I did not like. \\nIf you sit at the bar and eat you have access to the TVs to watch whatever sports channel meets your fancy.\\nAlso the Dirty Martinis there are second to none!"},{"name":"Sweetwater Tavern","address":"3 Boylston P","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Oh Sweetwater, pub/cafe of my college years.  I went to grad school at Emerson and Sweetwater cafe was always there for me with surprisingly good food and inexpensive drinks.  I love sitting outside in their charming little seating area, sitting at my high table and watching folks go by- harried looking business people on their lunch breaks in the transportation building and lack-luster Emerson students feeding themselves on RedBull and cigarettes... Sweetwater provides an excellent home to observe some classic Boston life.  \\nSweetwater has affordable food and drinks- I could die for their grilled cheese sandwiches.  And in the summer?  Ask them for a Guiness Float.  No, seriously, it is way more delicious than you could possibly imagine. \\nTry to ignore skanky dressed girls and obnoxiously loud frat boys from surrounding bars meant for younger and \\"hipper\\" kids who have more to prove, that's really the only downside to the Sweetwater experience.  It's just a generally nice place to go for a few drinks with friends.  Nothing too fancy, nothing overwhelmingly gross (though bathrooms are sort of small and not always the cleanest, but its a bar...what can you do?)"},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I've seen a variety of reviews about Hawkers on Yelp and other social networks, but all I have to say are good things! Having dined here several times and enjoyed delicious meals each time, I think I'm justified in that opinion.\\n\\nReasonable prices also make Hawkers an attractive dining experience. I really enjoy the udon, and typically order that every time I eat here. I know, I should switch-it-up at some point, but it's easy to stick with something if you know it's going to be good.\\n\\nThe patio outside is a great place to dine IF the Central Florida weather is cooperating (i.e., if it's not raining or too terribly hot). But the dining room is quaint and a nice place as well.\\n\\nLove Hawkers!"},{"name":"Junji Fine Japanese Cuisine","address":"114 Pleasant St","city":"Marblehead","stars":"4.5","text":"Just when you didn't think that Marblehead Massachusetts could not get any better, Junji moves in!!!!\\n\\nChef owner Junji and his lovely wife have created a Sushi / Japanese restaurant that just rocked our worlds!\\n\\nWe ordered our basic items.

We were seated promptly and ordered a couple beers, the brewery burger, and the black butte porter mac and cheese with chicken. The burger was ordered medium but was closer to medium well but it tasted really good. The mac and cheese sauce was a bit thin but they topped it with cheese so that helped even out the flavor. The noodles were so interesting and helped absorb a lot of flavor. Beer was good. Will definitely have to go back and try a flight."},{"name":"Nick's Food To Go","address":"240 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Nick's is about as consistent as it gets. The lamb gyro will probably be the best you've ever had. The chicken is great as well, but the lamb will leave you with cravings for days to come. My suggestion: get either gyro with grilled peppers and extra tzatziki sauce.\\n\\nDon't bother getting fries, a gyro alone will be plenty of food for most, but I'd definitely suggest sharing the homemade hummus+pita with a friend. The greek salad is tasty as well, and the baklava is amazing!"},{"name":"Grass Skirt Tiki Room","address":"105 N Grant Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Columbus definitive tiki bar- the drinks are fantastic, powerful, tasty and potentially mind warping.

Decor inside is nice. We ate at the back patio. Unfortunately there was a loud group of kids dining, and their noise really carried in the small space, making the experience less than stellar.\\n\\nFood-wise, the Routine was excellent. The steak and salmon (their mains) were just okay. For the price, the presentation looked cheap. Who puts steak straight onto a wooden plank like that? How about putting it on a dish? T\\n\\nThe array of edame beans and corn at the bottom of the miso salmon also cheapened the look of the dish. \\n\\nOverall, it was a fair place. Service was good."},{"name":"Brick and Beam","address":"705 Adams St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped by to check out this new Restaurant.  Had grown up\\nGoing to Villa Rosa and had mixed feelings going in due to the fact that it was so different than Villa Rosa. The food was excellent and exceeded my expectations.  The fish and chips was the best I've ever had. Portions sizes were great and the service was Excellent!!! I believe our servers name was Hannah and she was extremely pleasant and attentive to us!  I would highly recommended this restaurant and will definitely go again when back in Quincy."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Widmer might make the best gluten free beer (Omission,) but Deschutes is definitely the best brewery for a gluten-free person to visit to enjoy a delicious meal and DRAFT gluten free beer. Deschutes had an impressive array of drafts on tap, including some special brews that you can't find anywhere else. One such beer was a gluten free variety - they even put an elastic band around the glass so that if you set it down you knew you wouldn't pick up the wrong one. \\n\\nThe place is HUGE and it was absolutely packed, rightfully so. Great extensive menu with tons of gluten free options including fries and fish and chips and other things in a dedicated gluten free frier. The fish and chips were fantastic, the sweet potato fries were perfectly crispy and the only bad thing was that none of us saved room for dessert."},{"name":"House Blend Cafe","address":"10730 W Colonial Dr","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4.5","text":"Cute little place referred by my Chiropractor after my treatment.
