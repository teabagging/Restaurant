Instead, I found that the experience was pretty typical of a normal steakhouse, and that this place wasn't really special. I think normally, I'd rate this as an above-average steakhouse, but because my expectations were really so high going in, I'm rating it on here as just ok. \\n\\nFirst of all, I went with a group of six (which cost us a pretty penny, but that's ok if we're getting good steaks). Three of us ordered our steak medium-rare, and one ordered it well done (a sin, if you ask me, but let's withhold judgment for now). While we all got the same cuts of steak, all four of them were cooked differently. I'm sorry, but from a top-end steakhouse, if we order three steaks medium-rare, we expect the three steaks to be cooked the same. The steak was good, but not amazing. Our waiter also forgot the sauces we ordered with the steak (we got an order of all of them to try them out). The disparity between the steaks and the average service were really the only disappointing thing about this restaurant. Other than that, nothing really blew me away, either good or bad. Their bread was good, and I liked that their butter was served in a beef shin bone. We had their tuna tartare appetizer, which was good, but nothing amazing. Their calamari and Kobe dumplings were also not extraordinary, but weren't bad either. I've been to better restaurants in Boston (that were also cheaper), and I just don't think Mooo justifies their price.\\n\\nRegardless, I feel as though this restaurant is overpriced. If I'm going to pay this much for a steak, I expect it to be done extremely well. Instead, I found this place to be average, and I would probably rather eat at Hillstone's nearby (or Del Frisco's) than justify the price at Mooo for an average steak."},{"name":"Thai Heaven","address":"623 N Central Ave","city":"Hapeville","stars":"3.5","text":"The good: Coconut soup is rather good.\\n\\nThe bad: Location is on a second floor.

Very disappointing\\n\\n\\"Crab & Scallop 'Meatballs' w/Sherry Tomato Cream Sauce, $9. We received a plate with 2 large, for lack of a better word, \\"balls.\\" The sauce was delicate and flavorful and I knew the sauce wouldn't over power the crab and scallop, not that anything could. The balls were so salty that you literally couldn't distinguish any other flavors. The bartender said she had heard that complaint before. Obviously it was ignored.\\n\\n\\"Smoked Duck Quesadilla w/pickled Vegetables & Sweet Grass Dairy Goat Cheese,\\" $9. When the plate came my jaw dropped. The portion size was immense. But after taking one bite it was all about the PICKLED VEGETABLES.  A small amount of pickled, anything, goes a long way. And this dish had a large amount of pickled vegetables. I opened the quesadilla and picked out most of the vegetables. I took another bite and now the Goat Cheese was the dominant flavor. Don't want to sound like a broken record but a little bit of goat cheese goes a long way.\\n\\nI opened the quesadilla and scrapped the duck meat out of the center. The meat may have been smoked but it was most definitely drowned in a barbecue sauce. I feel a metaphor coming on; Flavors need to be team players.

We waited like 20 minutes just to be spoken to, the server brought my companion the wrong meats (I didn't THINK that looked like salmon...!!), and he never really explained the cooking times. Fortunately for my companion, I've been to the Melting Pot enough to fill him in myself. But that's not my job, it's the server's job. What are we tipping the server for, if I'm doing his work for him? The manager did come by and apologize (three times?), which I appreciated.\\n\\nThe time before that, it was Halloween (or Halloween weekend, I don't remember). Admittedly, I wasn't really dressed for the Melting Pot: it was a spur of the moment outing, and I had just gotten off work, where we had just concluded a Halloween-themed party and I was dressed something like a zombie. I did put my coat on over the shredded shirt, though...because, you know, that's just inappropriate. But I still didn't appreciate the way we were treated. First we were told that there was no seating available (um, what are those empty tables right in front of us?), then we were crammed into a particularly dark and abandoned corner by their shut-down \\"backup\\" bar, presumably so that nobody could see my ~offensively shredded shirt~. You know, the one I covered up with my jacket.\\n\\nI happen to know from experience (prior date night) that the Melting Pot has private, enclosed, two-person tables. Why not stick us there? The restaurant was obviously really, really, really not busy (I saw only a handful of occupied tables), and in the unlikely event that the secluded two-tops were all occupied somehow, we would gladly have waited for one of them, so that my dressed-down state wouldn't be so obvious to other patrons (honestly, though, it really wasn't that bad - I took off my shredded skirt, leaving only normal black pants, and my jacket almost entirely covered up my shredded shirt...I guess maybe my makeup was a little unexpected - messy smoky black eyes - but it's not like I was dripping fake blood everywhere).\\n\\nOnce we were actually seated, the service was acceptable (the server seemed amused by my costume), but I still didn't appreciate the way we were treated by the host.\\n\\nSo...go for the food, but prepare yourself for extremely hit-or-miss service.

Our attentive waiter made sure we got a chance to try everything we wanted:\\n\\nINDIAN SPICED FRIED OKRA WITH CURRY KETCHUP: Ohmigosh! So yum! Savory and nicely salted with just a tiny bit of heat. It was our first dish, and it was a great opening act.\\n\\nGRILLED GA QUAIL, BOURBON-PEACH BLAZE, LEMON & MARSCAPONE GRITS: The quail was moist and flavorful. The grits were OK, and 10 times better than the smoked gouda grits we'd had the previous night at Aspens.\\n\\nSALT-N-PEPPA PORK: This was my husband's favorite. Fried slices of pork with a yummy garlic-onion sauce and spicy peppers. It reminded us of our recent trip to Thailand.\\n\\nPERUVIAN STYLE BRAISED BEEF SHORT RIB: This was my favorite. So delicious. Rich sauce and so tender. Sauce was delicious. The side on this was quinoa with edamame, corn and other stuff. It was bland, but ANYTHING would be bland beside that short rib.\\n\\nSCALLOP, SHRIMP AND SNAPPER CEVICHE: Fresh, flavorful. Delightfully zingy. This was the most beautiful dish of a night in which everything looked fantastic.\\n\\nWARM OLD FASHIONED BANANA PUDDING: This was my lowest-ranked dish of the night. Too much meringue (and it was rubbery) and too sweet. But it was still tasty, and my husband really enjoyed it.\\n\\nCHEESECAKE, DARK CHOCOLATE, CHERRIES, BASIL: This was the weirdest dessert I've ever had. It looked like a puddle of melted ice cream lapping onto crushed chocolate cookie beach. The beach had chocolate truffle and cherry stones, plus a \\"rock\\" that was really a chocolate-covered almond. Underneath was a cherry sauce.

She looked at us several times, each time looking away without saying hello or even smiling. Awkward. When the couple in front of us was done ordering, they stepped away to reveal a stack of a dozen menus. When we actually got to look at the menu, w found it was very limited: 3 entrees, 3 salads, beverages.The man who took our order wasn't friendly... not unfriendly\\n  I thought the Portland bowl was really heavy on the protein: quinoa, beans, tempeh, AND hazelnuts while the kale was gone after 3 bites, The sauce was tasty, but after the veggies were gone it formed  a yeasty paste with the quinoa and beans that was hard to plow through.\\n\\nI like the idea of Canteen and and look forward to them developing the menu a little more.

I would give 5 stars for their food and atmosphere then like 2.5 for the inconsistent service.\\n\\nI've been here for both the regular menu and for Monday madness. It's a pretty nice restaurant, so I planned a birthday dinner here for a friend. It was on a Saturday night and they had the table for 12 immediately ready for us. The restaurant was surprisingly  not busy for a Saturday night, so I had nothing bad to say about the service. I also loved the sushi.\\n\\nI heard great things about their Monday madness so I ventured over here again tonight. It's supposedly packed on Mondays so I made a reservation, which you can conveniently do online. I highly recommend reservations. Again, our table was ready immediately whereas the people who came before us were told there was a 30-45 minute wait. Their offerings ranged from $2-$8, which is pretty cheap. I don't think any of us paid more than $14, including tax and tip, for a satisfying meal and drink. \\n\\nService sucked though! Some lady, who I think was one of the managers, asked us what drinks we wanted, and since we weren't ready, she said she'd come back in a few minutes. Then an actual waiter later took our drink orders. Then he said to prop up our menu when we were ready to order food...and we did...and we waited...and waited...until another manager-looking lady asked us if we've had our orders taken yet. I guess afterward she reminded our waiter of our existence who hauled ass to take our orders then we asked about our drinks. He gave us a look like \\"what drinks?\\", checked our tab to make sure we did order drinks, then said we'd get them in a few minutes. It took us at least 20 minutes from the time we ordered our drinks to get them. We never saw our waiter after that because manager-lady #1 took care of us after that. Maybe because she realized how much our waiter sucked. \\n\\nOkay, so aside from the crappy service our hungry tummies put up with tonight, overall this place is good.

The chicken was  super delicious, the breading stuck to the chicken for the most part really well despite being smothered in gravy. It was nicely seasoned and they chopped the chicken into nice little chunks. Kinda happy it wasn't bigger chunks bc that would make eating the poutine a little more difficult.. I mean I want everything in the one bite. The ff's were SOO crispy, every bite had the perfect crunch to it. It was a pretty heavy duty fry for the most part but after being smothered of course, it limped out.. NBD though. Cheese curds were good, the longer some say the more gooey and melted it got. I actually liked it both ways so yay for that. I guess if there was a disappointment in the poutine, it's the gravy. While very complimentary with the whole poutine dish, it did taste a bit packaged and generic to me.. Like the packets you get form the grocery store and add boiling water to. Wasn't a deal breaker ESP bc they gave us lots of gravy. I will look far beyond the gravy mishap. \\n\\nSo good I can't wait to come back. Do yourselves a favor and get on the poutine train..

The shell was cold to the touch and the chicken was...you guessed it..COLD. I flagged the waiter and asked him if these were supposed to be cold like this. Maybe they are served CHILLED (?) and I missed that description on the menu. He said no, they are supposed to be hot. He returned them and brought out another plate. They were only marginally better.\\n\\nNext, my GF ordered a burger and it was lukewarm and the tater tots were COLD.\\n\\nIronically, the one thing that wasn't cold was the tepid off-brand diet cola that they serve here.

I ordered something I get quite often, Pad Thai with Chicken, and it arrived within a very reasonable amount of time.

I couldn't hear you.\\nService: 4 stars.\\nCost: STFU.\\n\\nWent here with a business dinner. When booking, I specifically asked if we could be guaranteed a spot on the first floor with no stairs as one in our party had mobility concerns. I was told yes, but was NOT told that there was a special handicapped elevator for entrance, separate from the main entrance, and so that guest painfully struggled with the stairs in, and then down to our table. Not. Cool.\\n\\nI regret coming here with a client. After a full day of meetings we were all practically hoarse already, and the environment was *deafening*. It's just the acoustics; no particularly rowdy tables or anything. But especially with a client who was not a native English speaker, this was really tough.\\n\\nSteaks were admittedly amazing. Gorgeously seasoned, perfectly cooked to temp.\\n\\nApps and sides were on the whole....meh. Caesar salads had--and I am not exaggerating--about 10 whole anchovies per plate. Thanks? The burrata was divine, but served with a really weirdly textured pistachio puree. Mushrooms were awesome, well cooked and flavorful. Tater tots were not very traditional (kind of like light whipped mashed potatoes, deep-fried), but yummy.\\n\\nWait service was super friendly but occasionally slow, and as we had a car service coming at an appointed time I got nervous when I requested the check and it hadn't come ~15 minutes later. Sommelier provided an excellent recommendation, and the wine list is of course substantial. Front desk was nice enough but in a place this size and expense, are you KIDDING me that I have to pick up my own coat before leaving?? (There's a little coat room window; bit of a line when I went to leave, and tip jar on counter.) Not classy at all.\\n\\nI was not impressed with the table layouts, which were awkward to navigate among and yet there didn't seem to be that many of them. Also didn't care for the bathrooms, which did not have the lux touches you might expect (and I, at least, want) at a high end place. Not nice soap, utilitarian decor, etc. \\n\\nI agree with the other reviews that say this place is overrated as an overall dining experience.

The servers are Chinese and a little bit rude (impatient, but thorough).  Tables are rectangular rather than circular which I am used to in Chinese restaurants.

The menu and other leaflets kept repeating how everything was healthy (no msg), but do I care?

I also recommend the aloe gin martini which refreshing and unexpected. \\n\\nPassed apps were kobe beef dumplings, crabcakes, bacon wrapped scallops and chicken skewers.  Friends loved the kobe beef dumplings, but I found them to be a bit salty and the dough to be a bit thick.  The standout for me was the bacon wrapped scallops, which were crisp and succulent and served with an amazing maple butter dipping sauce. \\n\\nCaesar salad was classic and garlicky.  The pork chop with bacon brussel sprout ragout was intriguing, but at a steak house, so of course got the beef option.

Here's how it works. You pay $12 to the host at the front, then you seat yourself at communal tables. You then serve yourself soup and salad that's been sitting on a counter for god knows how long. The salad, in my experience, is sad, wilted, and soggy, and the soup is an tepid, unidentifiable vegetable soup. Some time after you've finished your soup and salad, someone will bring you your main course, which is some combination of mildly-seasoned beans, leafy greens, brown rice, and fermented vegetables. \\n\\nLook, if you're in the area, and you just want some cheap, healthy food to tide you over until your next meal, this is not the worst place you could go.

Look no further. \\n\\nI was dissuaded at first because of the name. I thought, \\"Newks? Does that mean they 'nuke' everything in the microwave? I wonder if you buy food and there is a bay of microwaves to cook your own food - like something out of a cheesy, 80's sci-fi, future based movie.\\"\\n\\nAnswer: No. \\n\\n\\n\\nMenus are on the wall to your right just inside the door, and the cashier's are straight ahead. Once you know what you want, place your order, take your number, grab a drink and saddle up to a table. They'll bring your food out in just a few moments. Usually, less than ten minutes. If they're not packed - much less than ten minutes! \\n\\nIn the middle of the restaurant, before the drink station, is a little condiment bar: hot sauce, bread sticks, croutons, crackers, Parmesan cheese, pickles, capers, chickpeas, hot peppers... grab a little plastic ramekin and fill it up. \\n\\nThey have a rotating soup menu, offering four or five different soups every day. I, myself, have tried the Broccoli Cheese (standard, good), the vegetarian Fire Roasted Tomato (chunks of real tomato and basil, slight kick to it - drizzled with olive oil, sometimes they put too much, perhaps get it without), and the Lobster Crab Bisque (rich and hearty, very flavorful - can become overpowering if not eaten with a salad or sandwich). \\n\\nThey do combos - a half sandwich and a big bowl of soup, half sandwich and a half salad, or a half salad and a big bowl of soup. Great price, and very filling. \\n\\nI've also have the Shrimp Remoulade salad - it's pretty big, very good. After about half of the salad the Remoulade dressing can develop a bit of a kick to it. \\n\\nThe Vegetarian Club is delicious - even my carnivore husband has ordered it twice! And the Pimiento Cheese Sandwich is to die for. Seriously. \\n\\nThey also do pizza's, which I have not yet had the pleasure of eating - but I'm sure I will get to soon enough. And for those of you who have jobs and would like something on-the-go, they have a little pre-made and packaged section, just to the left of the entrance. \\n\\nAnd FYI: for those of you who love al fresco dining, or can't do anything without your four-legged fur-baby, they do have an outside, gated patio area. \\n\\n\\n\\nNOTE: I was slightly confused about tipping. If you pay with credit card, there is nowhere on the receipt to fill in a tip amount. I asked a manager about it and he stated that because it's not a \\"restaurant, per se, but counter service - there's not really anyone to tip. If we felt so inclined, a dollar for the busboy is nice but by no means should we feel obligated.\\" I take this to mean that they pay their staff more than the waiter's minimum wage - and that makes me happy."},{"name":"Babs","address":"814 Juniper St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Such a great urban cafe atmosphere, ridiculously delicious food and graciously hilarious service.

High end dining is a special occasion for my wife and myself, so our expectations are high.\\n\\nThe cuisine at Grill 23 is phenomenal. We began with an order of their calamari and a caesar salad. The calamari was fried perfectly, not rubbery in the slightest, and it was seasoned very well. The plate also included fried onion strings, which I thought was an odd choice as it overwhelmed the flavor of the calamari and sauce; but these were easy enough to avoid. 10/10 for the calamari.\\n\\nThe caesar salad was nothing exciting. It was comparable to a caesar salad you might order at an Applebee's or similar family restaurant. 5/10 for the salad, which I would avoid if I go again, but otherwise this doesn't factor into my score. No one should avoid a steak house because of a salad.\\n\\nFor the main course I ordered the 100 day aged rib-eye, my wife ordered the 10oz filet mignon. Both steaks were cooked to our specifications, though the filet was so thick that the center was slightly more rare than my wife likes. My ribeye was probably the best steak I have ever had; I really can't stress enough how much I enjoyed this piece of meat. My wife did enjoy her filet, though she expressed that she would rather have gotten the twin 4oz filets instead. 9/10 for the steak.\\n\\nFor sides we ordered the tots, mushrooms, and beets. The tots had a strange texture, but were pleasantly seasoned (7/10). The mushrooms were well seasoned and not overly greasy or buttery (9/10). The beets were well prepared as well, though not very exciting (8/10). Overall, the sides were what you expect at a high-end steak house.\\n\\nDesert was another high-point with the Caramel Profiteroles. My wife loves desert, and this beat anything we've ever ordered at similar restaurants. It was simple, but delicious. 8/10 because of the simplicity; ice cream on a puff pastry is hard to get wrong.\\n\\nBased on food alone I would definitely give Grill 23 4.5 or 5 stars. Everything was delicious, prepared well, and what you would expect given the prices. The service is what lost that top star.\\n\\nThe service at Grill 23 is nothing like any experience I've had at similar restaurants. The waiters are polite, knowledgeable, and over-worked. Recommendations are consistently for the most expensive item on the food menu; as opposed to a discussion on what the customer enjoys. Wine recommendations are met with \\"The wine by the glass list is in the front\\"; as opposed to a knowledgeable discussion on different regions and years. The service is what I would expect at a much cheaper restaurant. It is adequate, and consistent, but not spectacular.\\n\\nOverall the service would've been fine if we were a group of people, or if I was bringing a client out for dinner. For a romantic evening it was lacking. The atmosphere in general is not something I would recommend for a date or special occasion.\\n\\nTLDR: The food served was some of the best I've ever had, but the service and atmosphere were more appropriate for a business meeting than a romantic dinner. The waiters especially seemed over-worked, constantly having to rush from table to table and not getting to focus on anyone.\\n\\nI would recommend this restaurants for groups of 4 or more people, or a location for business dinners. I would not recommend this for a romantic meeting, or a special occasion."},{"name":"Finnegan's Bar & Grill","address":"6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I was a little disappointed in the fish and chips this time.

As a long time patron of Bab's I can vouch that they do everything possible to accommodate children. I started eating at this establishment years ago, before my son was born. The friendly atmosphere and fabulous food is what has made me a long time patron.  There are not that many places in town that are as accommodating as Bab's and that is why I feel at ease every time I bring my child there. From the sippy cups, to crayons for kids to color to their own patio furniture in front of the pond make it a place for all to feel welcomed.  To the people at Bab's: keep doing what you are doing. You make it not just a great place to go eat but it is a truly wonderful experience EVERY SINGLE TIME.

When he promised to get back to us about our wait, he never did!

I got to try a bit of everything and honestly, everything was amazingly good. The chicken was tender, French toast was perfectly done. Skillet was good, lots of flavour. \\n\\nAlthough I still enjoyed my pulled pork benny, the pork itself was quite fatty (extremely fattier than usual - had to cut the very thick fat and threw it away). I'm someone who knows pork belly would be fatty but usually it would be easy to eat. The pork was not tender and soft. It was a bit chewy. The flavour was good but texture was the only problem I had. \\n\\nThe pancakes were AMAZING. Fluffy, sweet, savory.

The croquettes were perfectly made, very yummy, warm and gooey and tasteful although a third and dare i say even a fourth would have been nice as the dish only came with two rather small ones.  For dessert we ordered the milk chocolate cheesecake which was tasty, but I think the cheesecake factory could have done the exact same cheesecake. Not to mention it was served a tad frozen which made it tough to fork. Cheescake of that nature needs to be served a bit closer to room temp and not straight out of the freezer. \\n\\nWe loved our meals, but the service (which is contrary to what most yelpers have said about this place and why I'm dissapointed) was pretty crappy. Our waiter has absolutely no personality what-so-ever. He barely spoke and barely even made eye contact with either of us.

I know, I know, I'm a wuss, but I really hate waiting a super long time to eat. I don't usually go to a restaurant way before I'm hungry, I go AFTER I'm hungry. Not to mention, we conceded to eat outside on the completely empty patio instead of inside and still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. On the empty patio. Just sayin'.\\n\\n2) The service. No complaints here, really-- our server was very sweet and prompt, attentive but not overbearing, and generally very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. \\n\\n3) The food. I ordered a large hot chocolate, it came in a regular sized coffee mug. How big must the small hot chocolate be? I have to wonder... we ordered the challa french toast with ricotta cheese and the fried green tomato BLT, and we started with some biscuits and sausage. Breakdown time...\\n\\nSausage: tough, standard, nothing too special like we were hoping for at a place like SiMB\\nBiscuits: tasty, fluffy but chunky, went beautifully with the jam!\\nChalla French Toast: So, I will admit up front that I don't care much for ricotta, but something well done is well done. I did not think the addition of the ricotta was well done and my husband agreed-- there was just too much of the stuff. I would LOVE to try the french toast on its own, though, it was my favorite part of the meal with the fresh berries!\\nFGT BLT: No fried green tomatoes. No, really. No fried green tomatoes. Apparently they'd run out the day before and nobody bothered to inform the waitstaff. The only reason we ordered this sandwich was for the FGT! Favorite. Food. Ever. The sandwich itself was meh-- the bacon was a little too crispy and hard to bite through, and the bread was over toasted. I'm not big on sandwiches that scratch my lips up... the tomatoes they used (red) were fresh, though, and the mayo on the sandwich was well made. \\n\\n4) The price. It was average-- with our Scoutmob coupon we spent just under $20 including tip, but it wasn't much more than we would have spent at J. Christopher's. \\n\\nAll in all, it was ok, I may go back and try it again if I get a coupon or something, but I'd just as soon go to J.

The place wasn't busy and I told her I knew what I wanted. She ignored me. The \\"other\\" guy never showed up.

Chicken Tinga was a stand out and the Ceviche was delicious. The Veggie tacos were pretty fantastic, and completely different from veggie taco offerings around town.\\n\\nI've returned for lunch (pics) to enjoy a regular portion and experience, and ordered the Vegetarian Tacos. Spectacular. Sauteed Shiitake mushrooms, onions, zucchini, epazote, crema fresca make up the flavorful and hearty tacos. All tacos are the 4-5 inch tortilla size (authentic street taco size). Along with two tacos, I ordered a side of black beans and house made corn tortilla chips with Roasted Tomatillo salsa for a nice lunch. My only suggestion would be to add some salt to the tortilla chips. The chips were crunchy and delicious, but begging for some pop. Black beans are veggie friendly and had great flavor. \\n\\nThe table next to me ordered the guacamole, while the portion is a soup cup- it received raves. I'll be getting that next time as a starter. My lunch worked out to $15 plus tip. (no drink) Pretty standard for the area- a bit on the pricey side for two tacos, beans and chips but I'm not complaining.

I love my pup, take him everywhere, so this place caught my attention. We visited last Sunday afternoon, it was warm and sunny, a perfect afternoon for a trip to the dog park and to get a cup of coffee.  \\n\\nI took my sue bee latte (amazing! the drink deserves 5 stars) out into the park area to have a closer eye on the pup. My pup is socialized and I trust him around other people and dogs. Unfortunately, I don't trust other dog owners. \\n\\nThe park area was dirty. The chairs were filthy and everything was covered with a film of dirt. Okay, it's outside, but have something to wipe the chairs off, so clothes aren't filthy. The chairs are really uncomfortable, most are those cheap, molded plastic Adirondack chairs. If I hadn't just driven from Emory and spent $7 on coffee and a bottle of water, I would have left. \\n\\nYes, I could have taken my coffee to the patio and watched my dog from afar, but I'm glad I didn't as right away I could see there was an aggressive dog in the pack and his \\"oh-that's-just-how-he-plays\\" owners.  I sat toward the back of the park area and watched this dog become increasingly aggressive with every dog.  My pup avoided him and played with a couple of dogs toward the back, wrestling, chasing a tennis ball, etc.  Then came the folks in a Fiat with a pack of dogs, who literally, let all of their dogs out into the park, watched them all go to the bathroom, didn't clean it up, and loaded them back into the Fiat.  In the middle of this, the aggressive dog went wild on a little dog and someone snapped and said something to the owner of the aggressive dog.  \\n\\nI love the idea of this place, but unfortunately, I feel like this set up just leads people to ignore their dogs and not take responsibility for them.  My pup is on the smaller side, but very scrappy, and maybe I am \\"overprotective\\" of him.  Yes, I want to go for a cup of coffee, and chitchat with friends, but if I'm going to bring my dog, then I know that I'm responsible for him AT ALL TIMES.    \\n \\nBottom line on why I give it 3 stars: the outside area needs to be cleaned and better maintained, and management needs to have some strict policies in place in regards to owner's responsibilities for their dogs as well as permitting aggressive dogs in the park."},{"name":"Charlie's Kitchen","address":"10 Eliot St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"My first time going to this place I was in town visiting friends and my ex took me out and got me wasted!

This place isn't just sun in my belly...there's rainbows and waterfalls and the California raisins singing \\"I heard it to the Grapevine\\" in my belly.\\n\\nI was lucky enough that my boss brought me here for the first time for brunch! Yes, this makes her the coolest boss ever.  When I do brunch in general, I am quick to go for eggs benny.  Their Belly Benedict completely swept me off my feet--simply put, the best I've ever had.  And it isn't just the delicate succulent poached eggs doused in chipotle hollandaise.  It's that freaking sweet potato & honey glazed bacon hash!  OMG!  Once you taste it, it will certainly bring a tear to your eye when you find out that the Belly Benedict, hash and all, is only available on the weekends.  I pouted a lot, lip out and everything on a Monday morning, and it was a no go--sheesh!  So, one of my substitute for non-Belly Benedict days is the Shrimp & Grits.  Great cheesy grits!  I even get those as a side sometimes.  My other new breakfast fave is the P.B.L.T.  What a sexy sandwich!  This is beautifully stacked with pimento cheese, fried green tomatoes, bacon and a scallion aioli...even top it off with a fried egg if you like (I recommend yes! Do it!).  This is a world class breakfast sandwich and even though I don't usually even care for pimento cheese, this is one of my all-time faves!  Along with the brunch menu, they have lovely delectable coffees and lattes that go perfectly in this whimsical cozy destination.  \\n\\nThey also offer plenty of goodies for lunch.  I am a bit infatuated with one sandwich in particular, the Napoleon Complex...imagine toasty creamy brie with prosciutto zipped up fig jam on focaccia bread.  For the side, you can pick from several regular sides or you can get 1/2 of a salad--excellent news because The Lucy is a perfect kale salad with apple bites, pumpkin seeds, a bountiful of avocado, a wisp of onions and drizzled with lemon vinaigrette...just delightful!\\n\\nThe indoors is cute and comfy and helps spread the sunshine.  The patio is fantastic with quality patio furniture and white twinkle lights dancing above your head.  I have yet to come here for dinner but the menu looks rather tasty.

I decided to do a little vegan dessert investigation because Cambridge is pretty well-known for being a vegan-friendly place given its diverse student population.  I wasn't sure if we would even have time for dessert, but I wanted to be prepared in case we did!\\n\\nIn my Google searches for vegan ice cream in Harvard Square, I was delighted to find two ice cream shops that offer vegan and gluten-free ice cream options!  Lizzy's and J.P. Licks, both which are popular spots well-regarded for making their own ice creams, make it clear on their websites that vegan ice cream is available!  I told my husband if we had time after the reunion and were able to get to one of those places before they closed, I would really like to try one of them. It's so rare to find vegan ice cream served in an ice cream shop, so I kept my fingers crossed that circumstances worked in my favor.\\n\\nHappily, they did!  We left the reunion at 11:22 exactly!  Lizzy's was closed, but J.P. Licks was open till midnight, which was perfect since it was only a short walk from where we parked.  I was so excited to finally be able to buy vegan ice cream in a shop along with the less dietary-restricted masses!  I was also a tiny bit nervous too- I was afraid I would go in only to find either they didn't really have vegan ice cream or that they were out of it, since it is a really busy place and it was the end of their night.\\n\\nI'll cut to the chase- loud and clear, written in chalk on their blackboard menu, were three vegan ice cream options!  J.P. Licks offered soy-based chocolate fudge, chai, and coffee lace flavored ice creams!  Better yet, those flavors were fully in stock!\\n\\nI ended up ordering two scoops- one of the soy chai and one of the soy coffee lace (the lace is just chocolate that is marbled throughout the coffee ice cream).\\n\\nI know sometimes I sound like every food I try and describe on the blog is amazing, but I promise you when I say I like something I really do.  So let me tell you then that I liked this ice cream- a lot.  In fact, I loved it.  Even more, I think I just may be a wee bit obsessed.  Only second to the ice cream at Lula's Sweet Apothecary in New York City, J.P. Licks vegan ice cream is hands-down the best vegan ice cream I have ever had!\\n\\nThe soy chai blew me away- the ice cream was creamy and thick and the soy flavor was perfectly balanced as it wasn't too strong or too weak.  The coffee lace was equally divine in flavor and texture. I am going to venture to say that this ice cream was so rich, if you told me it was fine Italian gelato made of whole milk, I would believe you in a heartbeat. Since I like my ice cream to be as decadent as possible (I just say no to sorbets!), this ice cream made me swoon. Every bite came with a squeal of contentment.\\n\\nWhat was also wonderful about it was that despite the fact it was very rich, it sat so well in my stomach ! It didn't give me a stomachache or weigh me down, as ice cream can sometimes do to me. My tummy agreed with it just as much as my tastebuds did!\\n\\nNow, I just have to find where I can get vegan ice cream in an ice cream shop in Rhode Island.  I know there's the vegan ice cream truck Like No Udder in Providence, which I cannot wait to track down and try, but I wonder if any actual ice cream shops offer vegan ice cream?  I need to do some research I guess!"},{"name":"Aashirwad Indian Food and Bar","address":"7000 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"(Update May 2017) \\n\\nUnfortunately, the once-great lunch buffet at a fair price is no longer offered to customers on weekdays.

I love their interpretation of eggs benedict!  \\n\\nThe only problem I have (which you will see *I* do not have) is that the people I dine with tend to not prefer to eat here since there aren't many conventional american brunch options, and there has been confusion about what some of the items actually are (sorry if this seems stupid, but if a diner wants \\"plain scrambled eggs\\" with items on the side, that should be something you can clarify and achieve with the server - a person in my party spoke extensively with the server and ended up getting scrambled eggs with incorporated sausage and cheese which is what she specifically was trying to avoid).

Went here last night, paid $10 at the door for a  DJ. After just buying my second beer, security came up to me and told me i had to leave. I asked why and all they said was \\"sorry, you gotta go\\". Then another security guard told me i was fine and i could stay. Then about 30 seconds later they went up to one of the people i was there with and kicked him out for no reason. When he asked security why he was being kicked out he was told \\"for racial profiling\\". We had literally been chatting with each other the entire time we were there. When we were forced to put down our 3 full beers and leave for no reason we asked to speak to a manager. The guy at the door told us he didn't care we had a problem and told us to leave. So they pretty much robbed us of $10 each and about $20 worth of drinks. I have never seen a group of more incompetent security guards in my life. This place is terribly run and no one should ever go here. The down stairs has about an inch of beer/mud on the floor at all times. The music is awful. Overpriced weak drinks.

The pot stickers and spring rolls were very good.The main course consisted of Shrimp and Broccoli, Pad Thai, Orange Chicken and White Rice. The Shrimp and Broccoli only had five very tiny shrimp ( it was mostly broccoli). The Orange Chicken was good. But the Pad Thai was over salted and had a vomit like odor (It was totally inedible).

Even so, I rallied - and despite the fact that I spent most of the night puking in our hotel room due to horrible indigestion, I have no regrets.\\n\\nThe space was small and intimate, and while it was casual enough, it felt a little bit staid.  It'd be a great spot for a date, but maybe not a birthday party.  The service was top-notch - very attentive waiters, and a very friendly hostess.  I will say that the hostess was pretty pushy on the phone when I made the reservation - I believe she demanded that I not cancel in a way that was almost accusatory - but in person she was pleasant.\\n\\nThe food was exquisite from beginning to end.  I eat out quite a bit, and the level of cooking at Salts, the beauty and depth of flavors, was such as I've rarely seen anywhere.  I'd like to go again with some food-obsessed friends and try more of the menu, as my mother and brother (who I of course stole from) were entree-only for the night.\\n\\nThe rolls and butter were notably good.  The fresh bread had just the right softness and the butter was gorgeous, well salted and easy to spread with a light whipped texture.\\n\\nThe amuse bouche, which I wasn't expecting, was an absolutely lovely yam soup with maple mousse, maple foam, caviar, and microgreens.  It was creamy and comforting, with a measured sweetness, just delicious.  Furthermore, it was, in the world of amuses, huge.  A legitimate bowl, not a shooter.  Several delectable spoonfuls, each of which was licked to nothing.\\n\\nI ordered an appetizer of pan-roasted veal sweetbreads, which came with black radish, watermelon radish, poached heirloom apples, and molasses butter.  They were delicious, with a perfect near-creamy texture.  The melon-balled poached apples were a great tart accompaniment, and the sauce was sweet and deep, almost like a thick teriyaki glaze.\\n\\nI ordered the Atlantic fluke, which came with heirloom potato gnocchi, pickled beets, black truffle \\"caviar,\\" and a dill emulsion.  The fish was marvelous and tender, and the sauce was smooth and creamy with a bright tang.  The pan-fried gnocchi were fantastic, a great rustic element in a fancy dish, and the beets were an important element as well, adding a little sweetness to lighten the dish.\\n\\nMy brother ordered the free range chicken ballotine and my mother the beef tenderloin.  Both were excellent.  I rarely order chicken in restaurants, but I'd order the ballotine in a heartbeat.  This chicken was moist and juicy and full of flavor, just gorgeous.  The porcini spaetzle was a stellar side, and the dish also came with a nice array of vegetables and smoked bacon.  The beef tenderloin with hen of the woods mushrooms, vegetables, and Scotch whiskey gastrique was a more simple dish, but it as just as good.  The beef was scrumptious and tender, and I loved the caramelized onion bulbs and those delicious little mushrooms.\\n\\nDessert was a lemon souffle tart which, while tasty, could have been the final exam for a college level course in dessert consumption (I wish this course were offered, but alas).  This tart came on a squarish plate littered with berries, a dollop of raspberry sorbet, bits of raspberry macaron, and paint smears of black sesame.  To get every component into every bite was a high-level task that demanded patience and hand-eye coordination.  It was a very unfocused dessert, and not every element seemed to serve a purpose.  Regardless, the central tart, made with frozen Meyer lemon curd and a goopy marshmallow hat, was stupendous.  And, admittedly, the entourage of dessert fragments was yummy as well.\\n\\nAt the end of our meal, we got a couple mignardises - pretty prime treatment for a la carte diners at a moderately informal restaurant.  And I have to say, they were better than the mignardises I've had at almost any other restaurant.  The raspberry jelly was tart and juicy with just the right gumminess.  The show stopper, though, was the yuzu marshmallow.  Jean-Georges - with three Michelin stars, widely considered one of the best restaurants in the country - provides house-made marshmallows to its diners to end each meal.  Salts' blows them out of the water.  This marshmallow was the best I've ever had.  The yuzu took a couple of light chews to come out, then filled my nose and mouth with aromatic citrus flavor.  The texture of the marshmallow was perfectly pillowy.  I want a bottomless jar of these things.\\n\\nSalts was impressive in that each and every dish surpassed all reasonable expectation when it came to finesse and flavor.  Honestly, the French Laundry could probably serve a couple of the dishes without shocking many patrons.  Food of this caliber does not happen every day, and I hope to have another opportunity to come back and enjoy Salts."},{"name":"Mooo Restaurant","address":"15 Beacon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"After stopping by Yvonne's, which was incredibly packed, my friend and I decided to come to Mooo instead of Zen as we usually grab sushi together. \\n\\nWhen we walked in a few minutes after 7 pm, we were instantly greeted, and I inquired about a table for two. At first we were told they didn't have availability but then they looked at the reservation and said we could have a table if we were out by 8:30 pm. We didn't think that would be a problem and were led back to a table but not before they offered to take our coats, which we told them we'd prefer to hang onto.\\n\\nService was great.

I'm not sure if that would have affected our service otherwise...\\n\\nMy friend and I decided to split the west coast oysters, which were kumamoto. We also shared the brussel sprouts and tots.

We each also ordered an 8 ounce filet and were glad we did when I pointed out the 12 ounce at the next table. \\n\\nFood-wise, everything was excellent (at a medium, the steak was juicy, soft, and flavorful), but again, I do wonder how much of my positive association with this place comes from the company and ambiance. The place is dimly light, the volume wasn't overbearing, and the two of us could quickly speak with one another without shouting. \\n\\nI think they were ok with filling my water, and in the end, I don't think they rushed us or kicked us out when the clock hit 8:30 pm.

A whole slew of other burgers, sandwiches, and other misc plates that you can match with drinks for under $15-20.  \\n\\nWhen I went with a couple of friends we walked in and a waitress immediately comes by and says she can clear a table in a couple of minutes instead of just ignoring us.

We were looking forward to sitting outside, but it was packed and the servers told us it was seat ourselves.  Instead, we walked inside and got a booth.\\n\\nThe food was good and very decently priced.  However, our service was absolutely atrocious.  Our waiter (the check listed him as \\"Bexley G\\") did not even say anything to us when we sat down, no introduction or \\"how are you?\\"--nothing even remotely welcoming.  The 3 of us sat down and he brought over two menus.  After a minute, he realized, and wordlessly brought one more and just threw it on the table without speaking a word.  Next, he just came over and asked what we'd like to drink.  We asked for waters and he came back with them.  He took our order and didn't even say a word to us.  We got our food, which was good, and he never once came by to ask us how it was or asked if we needed anything.\\n\\nI got buffalo chicken mac and cheese that was supposed to come with a salad-- NEVER got that -- and needless to say my mouth was on fire so I needed more water.  Our waiter NEVER came back, so a friend of mine asked another waitress and she said she'd bring it over.  She never brought it over, so we asked Bexley and he wordlessly brought over a pitcher of water.  He filled my two friends waters to the top and on mine, he went to pour the water and instead all of the ice fell out onto my friends plate.  First of all, if she was still eating, it would have been even worse.  But he barely apologized, then just walked away and I never even got any water. \\n\\nAt the end, he also messed up the check and gave my friend back $6 less change than he was supposed to receive. We asked someone for him to come over so we could tell him he gave us the wrong change, and he took another 10 minutes just to come back. We had been there for over an hour at that point. \\n\\nOverall, this waiter was the reason this experience was horrible.

A friend of mine recommended Grill 23 which is his favorite restaurant in Boston.  After enjoying a bottle of wine at our hotel (woo hoo) we arrived on a rainy night at Grill 23.  We were a little early for our reservation (and the restaurant was empty) so we enoyed a cocktail at the bar upstairs.  The staff were very friendly and the bar was very nice. The homemade potato chips at the bar are good but are a bit spicy.  \\n\\nWe then were seated at our table upstairs and were seated next to the window and also with a view into the kitchen (kinda cool).  We really had a lovely spot.  A couple came in to be seated next to us and they made a big fuss since that table was next to the busboy station (mind you, no dirty dishes, etc). The manager came up to speak to the guest and he got an earful.  The \\"guest\\" was rude and we were glad that he was seated elsewhere.\\n\\nOur server was Daniel and he was very attentive. Since this was our anniversary, this meal was a big night out for us and the service was up for the challenge.  We started by sharing the crab cake which was great. No filler or breading.  Just crab.  fantastic.  My wife loved it.  \\n\\nThe app was followed by a salad (mixed greens).  Daniel confirmed that sharing the salad was okay so we went for it and the portion was perfect.  Salad was delicious.\\n\\nMy wife is not a meat eater so she needed some help with the menu and Daniel was very helpful making suggestions, etc.  My wife ordered the tenderloin and I had the Steak Au Poivre. \\n\\nW-O-W is really all that i can say. The steak was expertly prepared.  Slightly charred on the outside and Medium on the inside. Fantastic.  I ate so slowly as to enjoy every bite. \\n\\nHot fudge Sundae was a great splurge. My wife said it was her favorite course !   Daniel had a piece of chocolate decorated with \\"Happy 23rd Anniversary\\"   Classy touch.  We loved it.\\n\\nWe left and spoke to the manager and thanked him for tossing out the rude couple (which of course he didnt do) but we thanked him nevertheless.\\n\\nFor a really special meal/night out, I highly recommend Grill 23"},{"name":"Flying Biscuit Caf√© - Midtown","address":"1001 Piedmont Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Disclaimer....Picky Eater, you've been warned...\\n\\nPlease don't get me wrong I actually really like the flying biscuit.

Sadly, I have yet to find it. \\n\\nI went to Falafel Maison for lunch today with a co-worker and ordered my usual favourite : a chicken shawarma sandwich, and prayed that for once my dreams of a half-decent shawarma in Vancouver would be answered. Oh how wrong I was. \\n\\nWhile my food was being ordered, the guy took a few other orders. At some point he got mixed up while trying to socialize because he asked another person if she wanted hot sauce and then proceeded to dump a TON of hot sauce all over MY sandwich. I have no idea who even decided that a shawarma sandwich needed hot sauce, but look it up people, it's not an actual ingredient in it. So, even though they had completely messed up my order, I paid the 7$ and left. \\n\\nMy first bite of the sandwich was filled with disappointment. The chicken was dry and tasteless, the hot sauce was overpowering, way too much tabuleh, and I couldnt even taste whatever watered down garlic sauce was added to it. I barely finished half of it before throwing it away in another disappointing end to my quest for a half-decent shawarma in Vancouver. \\n\\nTo clarify what I so desperately am searching for but have never found here: A chicken shawarma sandwich should contain : lettuce, tomato, pickled turnip, pickles, shawarma chicken and garlic sauce. The garlic sauce should not come out of a squirt bottle and should have the consitency of thick mayo.  Once this deliciousness is assembled in a wrapped pita it should be lightly grilled on a panini before serving to your customer. You should taste the garlic sauce of your shawarma the next day while waking up. It should be the first thing you remember when taking a bite.

We aren't big fans of steak fries which the burger came with so those went untouched. The tacos I ordered were like a dream. They were deicious and so fresh. However, it doesn't say on the menu that it has cilantro on top. So if you think cilantro tastes like soap like me and 10% of the American population than ask for no cilantro. But I was fine picking it out and enjoying how great everything was. There was complimentary cornbread that was pretty tasty! Overall great atmostphere and great food.

Because we had to spend $40 (no change or credit is given if you don't use the whole voucher) we decided to each order an entree and maybe share some apps and desserts.  None of the desserts or appetizers sounded particularly appealing, so we decided to split three sandwiches: the portabello mushroom parmesean, the kobe beef burger with bacon and blue cheese, and the roasted duck and carmelized onion with brie.   The waiter commented \\"THREE SANDWICHES?\\" which made us feel a little awkward about it.   I guess using these vouchers is always a little awkward though.\\n\\nThey brought us several baskets of wonton chips to snack on while we waited for our sandwiches, which came out fairly promptly.    Our ratings for the sandwiches were as follows:\\nPortabello mushroom: B.   The mushroom was breaded nicely and had a nice tomato sauce, but there was too much feta on the sandwich and it overwhelmed everything else.\\nDuck: B+.  This would have been a solid A if it had come with the advertised Brie.  Everything was great, the duck was roasted perfectly and the sauce complemented it nicely.  But there was absolutely no brie!!!!!\\nKobe: B-.  This was a pretty \\"meh\\" burger.  We couldn't even tell it was Kobe beef (and I've had Kobe beef before that was a-mazing).\\nThe fries that came with the sammies were ok but nothing special.  They were so large and not really fried, so they tasted more like roasted potatoes.   Good but not really hitting the fries craving.\\n\\nI was prepared to give this place three stars, because the food was pretty good, and while other menu items were very pricey, the sandwiches were fairly reasonable at $10-$15 a piece.  However after we had paid the bill, we asked the waiter to box up all our leftovers and he only brought us 2 of the 3 sandwiches.   He threw out our duck sandwich (the best one!) and the leftover fries.   Granted, the duck sandwich had the smallest leftover portion and there were only 10 or so fries left, but he should have asked us before tossing it!  Especially after we clearly said we wanted everything boxed up.  That knocked the restaurant down a star in my book.\\n\\nAnother thing that irked me was when I came on here to write the review, I saw that they were having a three-course restaurant week menu for $20!  We each could have gotten three courses and used up our voucher perfectly.   The restaurant is not featured on the main Restaurant Week Boston website, and nobody mentioned it to us at the restaurant, so we had absolutely no idea they were doing that until we came to Yelp.   That's pretty annoying, because we almost certainly would have done that.\\n\\nAlso a final note on the price - while some menu items are pretty reasonable, others are insanely overpriced, most notably the pastas, which are reasonably priced at around $12-$15 but then charge you SIX DOLLARS to add chicken.  I don't think I've ever seen a restaurant charge more than two or three dollars to add chicken to a pasta dish.   Unless they're putting two pounds of chicken on your meal, they're making something like a 400% profit on that charge."},{"name":"Mooo Restaurant","address":"15 Beacon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Friend is getting married this year on the rooftop so we got to see where the ceremony will be happening.

We had to ask for water refills constantly, bar drinks were very slow, several of our drink orders were messed up, and I had to ask for my cup of coffee three times before our server finally delivered a cup of cold coffee, and I had to ask for creamer twice before he brought that. \\n\\nThe food was far overpriced for the quality, our steaks were overcooked, half the food was served lukewarm, one of our orders was incorrect, and they forgot to bring our sides out at first. Each of our servers tried to take new dessert orders from us three separate times after we had already placed dessert orders, and our desserts took a very long time to arrive. In fact, everything about this meal was slow -- it took more than three hours from the time we finally sat down at our table, and that was after waiting at the bar for our table to be ready. \\n\\nTo top it all off, the valet service left our headlights on and killed our car battery. We got back from a round of post-dinner drinks at a nearby bar to find the car wouldn't start, and instead of apologizing and offering to jump the car, the valet guy wanted me to help him figure out which of his coworkers had parked our car. I had to ask him to go find jumper cables and get the car started, and he still never apologized. \\n\\nI really don't know how this Sullivan's location is still in business.

I discovered this place on a tip from a Korean friend, back in 2002, and have never needed another place to go to since for what has truly become my comfort food (and that's not for lack of trying many other Korean restaurants both in the Boston area and elsewhere).\\n\\nConsistency helps  this place a lot - even through a renovation a couple years ago, the food here is always what I expect it to be, even after exploring the menu and coming back to my favorites.  There is an overall \\"authenticity\\" to their menu that beckons to me, and makes me think that what I find at Wu Chon wouldn't be unlike what I might be served if invited to a Korean friend's home.\\n\\nWu Chon eschews fanciful presentation for a good helping of your favorite dish and as much banchan as you care to eat (the variety of banchan is hard to beat, too - whereas I've been to many a Korean restaurant that feels generous to give you three or four, Wu Chon goes all out and will typically bring you seven or eight for the table; and that's just from the assortment that's available that day).\\n\\nThe jap chae (sweet potato noodle dish) is among my favorites there, as is the dak bo kum, dubu jigae, not to mention the bi bim bap served in the stone pot (even if my predilection for it betrays me as a westerner).\\n\\nAny restaurant that has easy nearby parking has an easier time scoring with me; but what's really nice about Wu Chon is that I also never feel rushed coming here - the atmosphere has always been relaxed, the service responsive and flexible (read: those who think waitstaff should be able to proactively read customers' minds will be disappointed, but personally I find that sort of attention obtrusive especially if I'm catching up with a good friend), and the bill affordable.  I could probably write a review thrice the length and I still wouldn't do this place justice, so I'll conclude with this:  Wu Chon is high on my list of \\"total experience\\" favorites, and I go out of my way to share this experience with any of my friends that have a taste for asian food."},{"name":"New China","address":"6017 S Goldenrod Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"We have been frequenting this restaurant since it first opened and initially were very pleased.

On the weekends or for dinner, the plates are a bit pricey, but most of them are big portions that can be split between 2 people - Such as the Paella. They have plenty of seating, and TVs everywhere to catch the soccer games, or even UFC fights. The only reason I'm giving it 4/5 stars is because of their BBQ chicken. Portuguese BBQ chicken is usually grilled over an open flame on charcoal. For some reason Galletto's chicken doesn't have that charred, coal flavoring. It may be that they are using a gas or electric grill, and that's why that natural coal flavor isn't there. Regardless, this place is very very good. The staff is great, and the food is delicious.

The weather was just getting warm (the kind of day that you'd consider freezing in August but for some reason in April you're sweating like a republican at a gay pride parade). All that being said, we decided to enjoy our weekend lunch date outside on their sidewalk patio on Columbus Ave. Glorious.\\n\\nThe menu has a variety of options in an affordable price range. Keep it simple or take it up a notch - whatever you're feeling when it comes to eating and spending, they've got you covered. I ordered the Chicken Crepe Basquaise whilst my date decided on a quiche. To start we were served a delicious warm bread loaf as well as the soup of the day (It was some carrot and tomato or something concoction - to be honest I was too busy inhaling the soup to remember the name). Our entrees were delicious, although I envied Deepa since not only is she a married woman, but she had a delicious quiche to boot. Not that my crepe was bad, but I wish I was in her shoes that afternoon.\\n\\nDespite my full belly (that's French for \\"belly\\"), Deepa insisted she take my profiterole virginity. We ordered the giant dessert fittingly titled, \\"One Giant Profiterole.\\" The thought of the ice cream in the center of the profiterole topped with oozing warm hot fudge is enough for me to take some PTO right now and head down to the bistro for another taste.\\n\\nThe service was impeccable from start to finish and the atmosphere was so relaxing - I just loved sitting outside and watching all the happy Bostonians skip about soaking up the sunshine...even the woman who stopped us on the street to tell us about Armageddon had a smile (not kidding). \\n\\nThe bill came and good lord was it cheap. Complimentary bread, drinks, soup, entree, and a shared dessert was roughly $20 a person including tip. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?\\n\\nSince I'm single, unlike Deepa, I'm going to keep this place in mind for the next time I have a date and want to look like a hot shot. The boy will order up all this great food and when the bill comes, Mr. Suave (Jeffrey H) will be all, \\"Oh, allow me.\\"   *swoon goes the boy*   But little does he know that he'll be breaking the bank when it's time for marriage and my hag Amanda drags him over to Tiffany at Copley Place to get the ring I've already selected.\\n\\nP.S. - Apparently some Yelpers (Deepa, Sasha, and Yi-Hwa) decided to venture to the bistro not too long ago without me. While they were there, Mr. Rob Lowe himself (aka, my fake boyfriend from \\"Brothers & Sisters\\", Sunday nights on ABC) was enjoying a lunch there as well at the table next to them.

The sauce might have had egg in it, but it was still terrible.  There was not even enough on the plate to wet the noodles and the pancetta was soggy and half cooked.  The bread is soft, but not even slightly warmed up and the house salad was basically an iceberg mix with 2 olives, 2 tomato wedges, and 2 cucumber slices.  The vinaigrette was sub-par at best.

The other main course we tried was a lamb stew, and normally I don't much care for lamb, but it was excellent.  I also had a mug of their housemade hot orange chai tea, the sweetness of which was a perfect complement to the spicy and savory flavors of the meal.  The only part of the experience that I didn't love was the bread.  Again, this was my first time having Ethiopian, and I knew that scooping food up with the bread is how it's done, but I was expecting something more like naan, not the cold sourdough crepe that came out.

The food is the typical IHOP fare, but the service is horribly lacking. The restaurant is packed and dirty. No one is ever around to take names for seating (leaving everyone to fend for themselves). My wife and I stopped in for breakfast and was told it would 10 minutes and given a pager. Half an hour later, everyone who had come in after us were all seated. We tried to track someone down to ask about the wait and they said the pagers don't really work. We sat down, finally, at a sticky, dirty table and periodically saw a waitress. Although we did get a good show of the waitresses arguing in the \\"kitchen\\" which is open in front of everyone. My wife and I each ordered an omelet, however, they came out 10 minutes apart, despite seeing one sitting under a heat lamp the whole time. If you're going to have an open kitchen like that, it should at least be a well performing one.

Fresh, cold and savory: yes. Spicy: no. But I didn't bother sending it back. After a night of heavy drinking, I'm not sure if more Tabasco is what my tummy needed. Skipping the yum-o-looking app menu, we went straight to the good stuff. My Barbacoa Beef Breakfast Enchiladas ($8.99) were borderline perfect. Not fatty at all, like how barbacoa meat tends to almost always be. The enchiladas were layered barbacoa between tortillas with (hot and tangy) green chile sauce, cotija cheese, green chile rice and black beans, topped with two eggs cooked over easy. Oh wait, there weren't eggs on my plate--either they forgot or ran out. But it wasn't a big deal to me. The enchiladas, black beans and rice were more than enough for this mujer. \\n\\nBrunch was served with our choice of a freshly baked muffins, along with a fruit cup. We somehow didn't get one of our fruit cups, but like I said, food was more than enough, so no biggie. Mel and I shared. \\n\\nThe highlight of our meal was our waiter Lenny.

The bread had a perfect crust on the outside and was light and fluffy on the inside. We devoured two loaves immediately and asked for more.\\n\\nWe shared escargot, which was pretty standard. I'd say dipping the bread in the garlic-pesto-butter of the escargot dish was the highlight for me.\\n\\nWe also ordered a side of pommes frites to share - they were pretty standard thin cut french fries.\\n\\nI had the skirt steak with bordelaise sauce. The steak was very flavorful and an expertly cooked medium-rare. I was very happy with the mushroom bordelaise sauce. The veggies were broccoli and cauliflower. The broccoli was nicely done, but the cauliflower was a little too al dente for my liking.

This menu is basically for hash brown lover because there are loads of them (there are some pork inside as well but not as much as the potato!) And even though it's \\"little\\", I couldn't finish it. Their chicken and waffle is OK I guess, the gravy is good, the pulled pork pancake is too sweet for me and I'm grateful it's not my responsibility to finish them ha! Their jalapeno sauce is so so good. I really LOVE them. For you who likes spicy food. The sauce was giving the food kind of a Mexicany taste to it, but it was really good you should give them a try. The B.E.L.T.C.H is really filling and there are loads of fries if you order them with fries. And I mean a lot of them. Doubt you will be able to finish it.

This time however I figured I'd bite the bullet and just try the Curry Veggie.\\n\\nFirst off these pies are delicious. The crust by itself would make a delicious meal. The Thai Veggie has some spice to it. If you're not used to spiciness, it might be a bit much. I remember last week I had trouble eating a whole pie without drinking water. Although I'll admit that I'm not the most macho of men especially when it comes to spicy foods. All in all, it was a good pie.\\n\\nNext up is the Curry Veggie Pie. As I stated, I was not looking forward to it. When I took my first bite, I was pleasantly surprised. It was actually good. I was afraid that after I took my first bite, I would want to spit it out or just throw the rest away. The curry wasnt overpowering and the curry and veggies mixture actually gave it a great taste.

It's not dim sum as touted so don't expect carts of varied dishes to roll your way at a constant pace. Nevertheless I enjoyed having 7-8 chefs fire their dishes and come around tables presenting their dishes. You give them a thumbs up or down to indicate if you want to try the plate. It's a small plate so they are meant to be shared.\\n+ Seasonal and varied. Good thing not all the chefs were presenting scallops or pork belly. They consult weekly to ensure there was a variety of protein and plates to sample. That night we had grouper, scallop, rabbit, cheese onion tart and more.\\n+ Atmosphere. Casual and alive. Communal tables encouraged chatter among patrons to get each other's take on what was good.\\n+ Drink cart. Wow. Ho Chi Pimm was a beautiful cocktail lined with cucumber slices. Old Fashioned was blazing. The bartender put on quite the cocktail mix from a cart that could be rolled from table to table. This drink service was the closer to dim sum style than the small plate service. Quality was incredible.\\n\\nShooting blanks -'s:\\n- Timing. It sucked. Dishes arrived haphazardly. It's dependent on the chef who is executing and you can have serious lapses before the next small plate is presented.\\n- Price. It adds up quickly if they are shared and portions are small for $15.\\n- Taste. Out of 5-6 plates, only one was a real hit. There's no point in describing the hit because menus change constantly. The duds or blanks resulted from imbalanced plates such as a smattering of picked vegetables that covered a tough pork loin. Or the rendition of beans and rice that was flat and flavorless.\\n- Cookie dough dessert for $10. It was a bar of cookie dough that had sesame seeds and wafers accompany it. Why the sesame at all?

Wait staff is not dressed to the ambiance they are attempting to set (casual, baggy jeans, not polished at all). The service was absolutely horrible (slow, unprofessional, inexperience was evident). The food was absolutely horrible, Lasagne had a very thin/runny red sauce, my tagliatella appeared to have been reheated. Presentation of food was a 0, on a scale of 0-100. Particularly when so much time and money was spent on the interior/design.\\n\\nI would be very surprised to see this place continue to exist in Atlanta. My guess is 9-12 months and it is gone. \\n\\nTo survive, they need: 1.) hire more experienced and **polished wait staff. 2.)

Basically, the main thing that this establishment is selling is canned French-ness.  This appeals to a lot of people but it seemed to me that the personnel were from other corners of the globe.  The main courses, which are called \\"plats\\" in France, are \\"entrees\\" on the Petit Robert menu -- I considered this to be a bad sign.\\n\\nI can report on the food that I sampled and on the two wines that I ordered.  Those wines were a low-end white Burgundy and a 100% syrah Cotes du Rhone (which was a recommendation of the patron).  The first wine was pleasant enough but no big deal; I thought that the second wine was much better -- it was a good value.  For my appetizer, I chose the soupe du jour, which turned out to be a beet and orange soup with horseradish cream.  The tastes were unusual, bordering on the bizarre; the soup alone lifts the restaurant out of the \\"completely meh\\" category.  One of my companions ordered a plate of French fries as his appetizer.  (I'm not making this up.)  Several of us tried a French fry dipped into the ketchup-looking beet soup and enjoyed the experience of having something taste totally different than its appearance would suggest.

I reviewed this with them and they said that these were booked online and I should have received an email confirmation.  Well when I receive emails from random hotels they usually end up in junk or I delete thinking they are spam.  My card is also on file with their parent company IHG Hotels because I do travel for work and stay at their locations.  I explained all of this and they kept saying that to avoid this issue I should have cancelled the reservation before the 24 hour window.  Problem was I NEVER BOOKED THESE RESERVATIONS.  I have been in communication trying to get over $800 back from these bogus reservations where no one actually stayed in a room there.  Just seems like a scam to me.  While I have had good experiences in the past with IHG it makes me not want to stay at their locations and support them if this is the treatment I receive.

Dad is celiac, so we wanted a nice, upscale place with a gluten-free menu.  Davio's fit the bill.  \\n\\nFor an appetizer, dad orders the GF gnocchi w/mushrooms for us to share.  It comes out and the server places it on the table.  We look at it, and it looks...not gluten-free.  We call the server over, and she is \\"not sure\\" if the app is gluten-free, but she will check.  We wait.  She comes back and says it IS gluten-free.  Dad is about to take a bite when another server comes over and says, she is going to check with the chef to see if it's gluten free.  We are utterly confused, but dad holds off on eating so we can get this clarified (being celiac, your body will absolutely hate you if you get \\"gluten-ed\\").  She comes back...oops, it's not gluten-free, let me take that away.  Are you serious?!  The servers are contradicting each other, and all we get is an oops?  They should be more sensitive with food allergies!  The manager finally comes over...whoops, sorry, another one will come out shortly.  I don't even want it anymore, I don't trust them not to screw up.  New app comes (looks more gluten-free than the first one) and dad finally eats.  It tastes okay.  \\n\\nEntrees come.  Brother ordered the sirloin special, done medium.  What he receives is a charred steak--he knew it was done incorrectly before cutting into it, but with the first cut it was obvious that there was no pink to be found in this steak.  Again, we call over the server.  She brings the manager, and he confirms, no that's not a medium, we'll get you another.  At this point we're tired and fed up (seriously, I thought this place was a STEAKhouse!?).  Fortunately, dad's dish actually is gluten-free, so while brother patiently waits on steak #2, dad can eat.  Server brings over steak #2, calls the kitchen \\"an embarrassment\\".  Hey, she said it, not me!   She tries to sell us on dessert, but there is no way that's happening tonight.\\n\\nAfter the meal, manager tells us he took the steak off the bill.  Definitely the right thing to do, but the gnocchi should have come off too...honestly, messing up a gluten-free dish for a celiac guest is WAY more dangerous than just cooking a crappy steak and being called a steakhouse.

And for only $11 for two, it was definitely the best over all deal I have found in the greater Boston area. My partner tried the veggie burger reuben.

When you're eating very simple food, the quality of the ingredients can make or break the meal, and at Bumblekiss, the ingredients are top-notch.

When I returned 30 minutes later, half of my family (yes, I said half) was JUST getting seated. \\nWhen they finally seated me and the other half of our party on the other side of the restaurant, that's when I noticed the almost third-worldly feel of the dining room. \\nYou see, there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to how the place was laid out. \\nMost restaurants--even busy ones--have booths and tables organized in such a way that you actually feel like you're having a meal with only the people who came there with you. There are defined walkways between the tables for the servers to move about and for patrons to actually have a little space. \\nThis place was packed like a bus station somewhere in the foothills of *insert underdeveloped country here*.  The carpet smelled like wet dogs, and we were literally elbow to elbow and back to back with the families next to and behind us.  The server had one little space to stand between the tables to take our order, and when our food was delivered the poor girl was relegated to the \\"take one and pass it down method\\" because she couldn't reach everyone.\\nI didn't want to eat at all, but I was already part of a captive audience and didn't feel like arguing with my wife about why I had lost my appetite.  So I ordered the chicken and waffles with scrambled eggs.\\nMy scrambled eggs: burnt.  How the heck do you burn scrambled eggs at a place that specializes in breakfast?  Our server was very nice though and got the cook to make me some more.... which didn't show up until I was done with the rest of my food.\\nMy waffle: lukewarm and soggy.  I know pancakes are your cash cow, but come on, I've had better Eggos.\\nMy chicken (fingers): barely warm, greasy... and a teensy bit on the gray side.  Regardless, I tried to finish them.  But after I spit out a hunk of gristle, I was done.  \\nIf you look at my Yelp history, you'll see that I am a rather frequent IHOP customer.  So I'm going to hold onto the hope that this visit was an aberration.  But if you're going to operate a restaurant in one of America's most popular vacation cities, you've got to do better guys.  Expand and upgrade your dining room (I know you're making enough money), and practice better quality control of your food.\\nFrom now on when we're on vacation, we will start checking out the mom and pop diners for breakfast.  I can't say I've ever been disappointed in their food quality, and since they're not name brand franchises, they're sure to be a lot less packed."},{"name":"Joe's Crab Shack","address":"600 E Riverside Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I had been going to Joe's religiously for a few years, and this year was particularly special. It's the first year my husband and I had been off at the same time for Father's day since the birth of our daughter. \\n\\nWe walked in and were told it would take about 15 mins to get a table inside. Which we figured wasn't too bad, we sat and waited. A little less than 15 mins go by and we're taken to a table, they set down the menus and walked away. We had our daughter in tow, so we didn't get a high chair or any more of a \\"hello\\". We literally sat for almost 20 mins for our waitress to come by. We watched several different servers take orders from the people around us, but no one paid any mind to us. Another table had been seated behind us, and they were taken care of almost immediately. My husband was finally fed up that he waved someone down, and the server just said he'll get someone. We were finally greeted by the GM, who apologized and said they were busy. He got us a free appetizer for the wait, took our drink, food order and got us a high chair and more crayons for our daughter. 5 mins later the waitress appears apologizing that its been busy and \\"no one had informed her that she had another table\\" (even though she passed by us a few times on her other tables). Our appetizer arrived, cold, and she asked if we needed anything else when we said \\"our drinks\\", she replied \\"what drinks?\\". When she retrieved them from the bar, they had been sitting there for so long that my Shark Bite was a lovely color of pale blue with a layer of water from the ice, and my husband's mason jar spiked tea had layers of the different alcohols. Our food arrived, mediocre at best. But our waitress was overly attentive, every literal 2 mins she was at our table asking if we were ok and if we needed anything. Everything was a little cold, little dry, my husband loved his \\"Ragin' Cajun Pot\\" and my daughter loved her \\"Captain's Catch\\" plate, mine was just a little too much sauce not enough food. \\n\\nSadly, we'll never go back.

It was a great experience and made me anxious to return soon to try other menu items, as well as to invite others to enjoy the food and ambiance.\\n\\nOne of the things I most liked about La Tagliatella is that in its transition from Europe they did not Americanize or dumb down the menu like most Italian and other ethnic restaurants in Atlanta seem to do.  Having spent more time in Spain (where the chain originated) than Italy, I recognized definite Spanish influences, along with many presumably authentic Italian recipes not found elsewhere.  I hope Atlantans embrace this Europen-ness rather than causing the owners to adapt by adding standard Italian-American fare and removing any of these unique dishes.\\n\\nThe salad we had was Insalata al Rullo di Capra Gratinato (\\"Pan fried goat cheese and caramelized tomatoes served on a medley of mixed greens with sweet corn, pistachios, pine nuts and black olives\\").  It was delicious with fresh high-quality ingredients and a perfect balance of textures and flavors.  We tried two different dressings: Honey and Pistachio Vinaigrette and Extra Virgin Olive Oil & Balsamic Vinegar.  Both were obviously house-made and not like something processed you'd get in a bottle.  This salad most reminded me of food I've had in Spain.\\n\\nEach of the pasta and sauce combinations we chose were also exceptional in flavor and texture, and all four of us enjoyed sharing all of them.  We were all quite hungry and thus finished everything, but the portions are definitely generous, with one being enough for two people if you also share a salad or appetizer.\\n\\nThe dessert menu was also full of unique options, and the flan-like two-layer Cheesecake della Tagliatella was delecious - not at all your typical cheesecake.\\n\\nOur waiter was very attentive and friendly.  There was a bit of the initial sales push mentioned by another reviewer, but once we began the ordering process he was very helpful in answering questions and provided flawless service throughout the meal.\\n\\nThe only suggestion I would make is to offer some type of bread such as the Pane della Tagliatella (which we also had) as a standard free accompaniment, rather than a purchased option.\\n\\nIn summary, I am very happy about this addition to the Midtown culinary scene, and hope it will be a long-standing fixture in our community."},{"name":"Sullivan's Steakhouse","address":"300 Colorado St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Went for lunch the last work day of 2017 and enjoyed a great steak and a couple of Knockouts.

The place is incredibly popular; in fact, I almost stopped previously but did not want to wait behind 11 people (yup, I counted). Needless to say, you don't get diehards waiting so long in line if the bagels are poor quality and overpriced! One word: yum! Loads of flavors and great prices. Very similar to Bagel World (even the line was the same length!). Friendly service. I didn't feel like I was rushed despite the crowd. I saw several bagel flavors that I wanted to try but I only bought one to eat and one to go (sometimes I end up with too many bagels- it's a problem!). I do have to give it 4 stars and not 5 because you do have to wait. It's not a place you can pop in and be on your way- be prepared to feed the meter! Will I go back?

I like water but I'm really not that upset when my glass is 3/4 full -- I can wait.  The menu was pretty standard/boring, so I ordered the clam chowder for an appetizer and it was bland and flavorless.  And I have such high expectations for clam chowder in the New England area!  \\n\\nI ordered the chicken dish with a applewood bacon celery sweet sauce that was great and a side of slightly mashed garlic red potatoes that were tasty.    My friend had the beef medallions and thought it was pretty good.

My least favorite was the salmon and rice vermicelli, which was very good, but it had a lot of competition.  The fried green tomatoes with curried catsup?  They are addictive....

Never once did I see a manager walk by during our dinner.\\n\\nNow getting to the meat of the review - pun intended. The first round of ribeye and filet cuts were nice and juicy and were cut medium as asked. So where did it go wrong? Everything after that was absolutely horrible. Every cut of steak was well-done!! I kid you not when I say it was way way way overcooked. Seems like after they cut the outer layers for customers, they go to the back and re-seer the cuts, rendering them inedible. This continued throughout dinner and I kept asking for medium but they kept cutting and everything was overdone. It seems like they don't appreciate a good cut of steak. Finally when I made a complaint and showed the cutter 4 separate cuts that were given to me overcooked, he went back and cut me a slice that wasn't even medium-rare! It was rare and looked like it should've been beating on my plate. Horrible. Just horrible.\\n\\nBrazil Grill and Grill from Ipanema (Seattle) is less-expensive and with much better quality, not to mention the better and friendlier service. I had high expectations of this place but left sorely disappointed and with $180 (3 of us dining) less in my wallet.

I chose a salmon bento box - white rice with two small slabs of grilled salmon covered in a thick soy/bbq sauce; typical salad with Japanese Mayo dressing, 4 small california rolls and an assortment of tempura - sweet potato, broccoli, scallops (I think).

Part of it is that I listened to my Walkman (yes, Walkman - I told you I was old) too loudly in college, and lost some hearing, so it's hard to talk with all the background noise at busy bars.  The Brighton Beer Garden is just that - loud, noisy, and bustling.  That's just the way it is though, and I can't fault the place for my own preferences.  It just ain't made for those of us who yell at chilluns to get off our lawns.  So I do not deduct any stars for the fact that the place is what it is.  Just know it's loud.\\n\\nI found a sort of compromise, which was going right after work, before the dinner and drink rush started.  And for a while, I dug it.  My favorite meal is a chicken ceasar salad (or wrap) with a lemon martini (though after discovering I'm old, I expect it to change to creamed corn and strained peas), and they did a pretty good job with it.  The martini may have been a bit too sweet, but it was still very drinkable.  The salad has always been yummy.  \\n\\nTonight was different, though.  My salad had too much dressing (yuck), and lacked the lovely flakes of parmesan cheese that always had accompanied it during previous visits.

Wife N's birthday, 2012, and she wants to head out for drinks and dinner.  She thought Spaghetti Factory sounded great, so off we went.\\n\\nWe sat in the bar, which tonight was a more subdued alternative to the main room.  It's not that I mind sitting in the restaurant, but I just wasn't in the mood for some 4 year old peering out the window of the trolley car over my head while I ate.  It's not usually much of a problem (and we LOVE kids--no issues there), but we were just in the mood for a more intimate setting and the bar fit the bill perfectly.\\n\\nFor starters, I ordered the Blackberry Pomegranate Long Island Iced Tea and Wife N ordered the Strawberry Peach Margarita.  Both were lovely--nice take on an Iced Tea and the margarita was refreshingly different than your typical lemon-lime-mixer varietal.\\n\\nNow, on the food: there's one thing I have always been able to count on with Spaghetti Factory: any given dish will be exactly the same with each subsequent visit.  A clam-sauce plate with a side salad with Pesto dressing and the bread and garlic butter are identical today as they were the first time I had them twenty years back in a far off state.  Total thumbs-up-kudos for consistency.  I don't know any restaurant chain that could serve a decent plate dinner with that level of consistency across time and a very big country.  \\n\\nThat said, for some odd reason tonight I wasn't interested in my routine clam sauce.  So Spinach Ravioli it was.  Wife N. ordered the Shrimp Fettuccine.  Both were great.  I mean, you don't go to Spaghetti Factory for the uber-fine-dining-stuff-you-could-never-eat-anywhere-else experience.  You go here because their pasta is pretty darned decent, the place is clean, the service is generally great, and heck they throw in a free bowl of ice cream for dessert most of the time.  Bonus!\\n\\nNow, last year, Wife N turned 40.  I decided to throw her a surprise party (with 25 attendees) and we did it at this very Spaghetti Factory.  I have NEVER been to a restaurant that was more organized and on-the-ball with a large party.  Drink and food orders were taken, delivered, and cleaned up with perfect timing.  They even took our Beaverton Bakery cake and kept it in the fridge for us until the appointed time, delivering it to our table with cake serving tools and plenty of extra forks and plates.  Customer service was excellent from the first phone call until the last person got up to leave.  Really--flawless guys.  This venue made our night and I would recommend having any kind of a large party here as they're very organized and dedicate just the right amount of service staff to reserved groups."},{"name":"Uncle Kenny's BBQ","address":"157 N Hwy 27","city":"Clermont","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife is a constant yelp reader.

There are many reasons why I enjoy going to the Old Spaghetti Factory. One big one is that I know I am getting a really good value for the money. Their dinners come with your choice of milk (I think), hot or iced tea, or coffee plus soup or salad and a small bowl of ice cream. The restaurant is close to home (less than 3 miles) and by a good shopping area with a decent movie theatre.\\n\\nThe staff always seem friendly. Tonight, our server was really nice. She really wanted to get me some ice cream for my birthday, but of course my vegan diet puts a big crimp in that idea.  She came out and said it was probably the most lame thing she's ever done and then put down a bowl (used for the ice cream) with a single candle in the middle of it (stuck to the bowl by melted wax). She lit the candle and wished me a happy birthday. I made my wish and blew it out, laughing the whole time.\\n\\nMy only complaint is the lack of vegan items. I'd go more often if I could get something a little more interesting than spaghetti with marinara sauce.\\n\\nThere's nothing fancy about the spaghetti with marinara, but it's the best I could do with my new vegan diet. It's just a bowl full of pasta (I think it was just regular spaghetti noodles, but you can get wheat pasta or gluten-free pasta) with a decent tomato based sauce. My husband and I split a big bowl of steamed broccoli. It's filling enough and you can't beat the price for what you get with your meal.

They clearly put a lot of care into their food, and comes across in their preparation and garnishes. No giant mouthfuls of bell pepper and other filler vegetables. The bamboo shoots are the thin match-stick kind, not the flat, wide variety that I can just as easily find canned in the grocery store. It goes to show that they aren't just dumping things in serving dish without a second thought.  \\n\\nThe curry compares to the best curry I've had inside or outside of Boston. Deep, complex and flavorful. Ask for the hot sauces when you order, and they'll give 3 dishes with garlic chili paste, better-than-rooster-sauce sriracha, and dry ground chiles. Control the spice level yourself! \\n\\nWe now judge all other Crab Rangoon to Boo's, and Boo's hasn't lost yet. Perfectly crispy, but not greasy at all. They add some dried cranberries to the filling, which I don't think is something you would find in pre-made frozen dumplings. Respect.\\n\\nPapaya salad was excellent, the larb salad was delicious, and I've never been disappointed with any of their entrees. The Spicy Eggplant reminds me of the \\"chicken with garlic sauce\\" dishes found in most Americanized Chinese food places in the area, but made with more care and fresher tasting ingredients. We haven't really found any reason to go to most Chinese food places after finding Boo. \\n\\nOh, and the service has been consistently great. Every time. I don't think I've ever had to ask for a water with my Thai Iced Tea/Coffee. They smile and joke with you (language permitting) and when the restaurant is less busy, they wont sit you right next to the only other people in the restaurant. Considerate, kind, and patient. \\n\\nTL;DR: Eat here. Every new Thai restaurant we try just reinforces how much we like this place. It's a step above the rest, and it's all you could ask for in a local Thai place."},{"name":"Bar Congress","address":"200 Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"best Pimm's cup EVER!  friendly and attentive service, beautiful room and $5 shisiito peppers...

While most of the dog owners were very attentive, there were, of course, a few bad seeds who allowed their pups to growl and shit all over the place, without looking up from their books. Worse still, there were people who chose to be inside while their pups played, despite the gorgeous weather.

Had a great spot in the courtyard patio on a beautiful Sunday morning. My mom and sister arrived a little earlier than us and ordered drinks. My mom ordered a Bloody Mary and my sisters girlfriend ordered a mimosa. When my husband and I got there we ordered the same combo of drinks but when my husbands mimosa arrived it looked completely different than the other at the table in terms of color...less champagne I would assume. The bloody Mary's were very vinegary and my husband compared the taste to cocktail sauce...yuck! The waiter took forever to get our brunch muffins, never brought waters after being asked multiple times and than got my sister the wrong enchiladas...clearly he didn't know the menu. My husband later ordered a Bloody Mary which came out in a margarita glass. Each if the three bloody Mary's at the table had a different dressing, double olives, no olives, olives and limes...no consistency. My food was very good as well as my husbands...we ordered the breakfast relleno and the skillet. My sisters breakfast enchiladd weren't breakfasty at all and my moms migas were sub par. Definitly disappointed in our brunch...so much for trying something new. Next time we will stick to what we know is good and it's not this place.\\n\\nSide note: the table behind us got their food to go as soon as it came out bc the service was so bad.

I think we almost got everyone.\\n\\nI had the 3 tacos (restaurant week special) and my wife had the 2 tacos and guac.  We shared chips and salsa.\\n\\nMe: achiote pork, chicken tinga, carne asada\\nHer: carne asada, pork fat\\n\\nThe d√©cor was awesome.  The staff was wonderful.  The placed smelled like heaven.  The drink choices were interesting and well beyond a typical place.  I wanted the tacos to be the best ones that passed over my lips... they were better than average, but not superior.\\n\\nI love tacos.  I love crunchy tacos.  I love soft wheat flour tacos.  I like soft corn tacos.  They only serve the soft corn.  I totally understand that's the AUTHENTIC way and this place is big into that.  Honestly, though, options are good.  You can have options without automatically turning into Chipotle.  I'll take the soft corn as my third choice.\\n\\nThe corn flours were being pressed fresh right in front of our eyes.  That was nice.  The guac tasted fine to me, but I'm not a big lover of guac.  My wife said it drastically needed a bit more salt and touch more garlic.  She's a guac snob and prefers her own, but she said overall the freshness was a big step in the right direction.\\n\\nI found all three of my tacos to be pretty tasty.  I did wind up picking a lot of the pickled onions out of my achiote pork taco because SWEET JESUS there were a million of them in it.  No one needs that many pickled onions.  When the onions outweigh the meat, you need fewer onions.  That was probably just a bad scoop.\\n\\nMy wife loved the pork fat taco, but thought the carne asada was way too sweet and not acidic enough.  She still gave them both high marks.\\n\\nI enjoyed the habanero salsa, but found it to be much smokier than any I've ever had.  It was mildly hot, but almost had a poblano flavor instead of habanero????? \\n\\nI will gladly go back and try more of their tacos ANY DAY.

The prices may scare you until you realize that one entree and one side will fill up two people. But large portions aside, this stuff is three cuts above typical food truck/food hole fare. Since you can get your choice of fish prepared taco or po' boy style, we did one of each. The po' boy setup with blackened drum was good and more imaginative than you'd think the genre can offer, if a touch salty (a recurring theme with the wings) but the tacos won in the end--blackened ahi on tortillas was sublime. The cajun wings were, saltiness aside, very good (and I have eaten many a wing) and hush puppies are somehow elevated beyond what you thought possible for something so basic. As a bonus, if it's hot out, order from the inside widow in the neighboring (ungodly cheesy) Lavaca Bar (21 and up) and watch ex-frat mating games along with sports on 72 car-sized televisions while you chow down on this deliciously messy food.

Fellini's is also open until 2am every night, except Sundays until midnight.  I never seem to see the same employees behind the counter, but whoever is taking my order is always nice.  They offer a few decent wines by the glass and about 8 beers on draft (Budweiser, Bud Light, Yeungling, 420, Blue Moon, etc.).  I've had their white pie, which is just OK, and the Hawaiian is good.  I would definitely recommend the \\"Fellinis Special\\" pizza, which is $3.95/slice and features pepperoni, meatballs, onions, shrooms, green peppers, green and black olives, and extra cheese.

Now it is way above $10 bucks. The amount of food has also been cut back but they now have different options and services. Before they didn't have a stir-fry cook and no sushi chef. Now they offer those options but they also cut back on their amount of food. They have two small islands of main food items and then two more that hold some fried items, fruit and then dessert item. There is another food island for the stir-fry food that you mix together and give to the chef.\\n\\nThe only food item that I miss from this place is their walnut shrimp which is so amazing to eat, and that is the only thing that draws me to this place. They have the normal selection of chinese food you would find at any buffet, lemon chicken, sweet and sour, pizza, sesame chicken, hot and sour soup and egg drop, etc. The dessert selection is great because they have a lot of ice cream flavors to pick from and also chocolate and tapioca pudding.\\n\\nI would say look around and really find a good chinese buffet before coming here but if the only reason you go here is because its close then make sure to take advantage of that walnut shrimp and sushi but if thats not the reason, do some homework and really look around. \\n\\nLast time I check, hot and sour was warm and bland."},{"name":"Zoes Kitchen","address":"5601 Brodie Ln, Ste 1525","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The manager is the best.

Upon checking out the menu, I saw they served Cubanos; and at the urging of the Cuban cigar rollers, I HAD to try one.  I mean serious, if the Cubans are telling me this is the best and true authentic Cuban coffee, then I MUST take their word because I see them drinking it.\\n\\nAnd so begins my love of SUPER strong and sweet coffee.  Seriously, I have always loved coffee; however, it has now been elevated to a whole other level!  Chris bought several cigars, and we sat and enjoyed the atmosphere while he smoked a Texas Sweet & I drank my Cubano.  As luck would have it, Chris is not really into coffee but was drawn to my drink, tried it and had to have one himself.\\n\\nI decided to go chat it up with the Cuban men about finding some good Cuban food because now we were craving, lol and they sent us immediately to Habana (review to come later).

We have concluded that if we are planning to have a night on 6th St, we MUST stop by Bobalu to fuel up on Cubanos first lol.  Of course we did stock up on a variety of cigars including some flavored cigarrillos.  I asked the young man behind the counter if he could make me a Cortado and apparently he didn't know about it but asked me so I told him, and he made it for me.....even the Cortado was the BEST I have had to date anywhere!

Rover's twice now, and both times, I'm afraid I was underwhelmed.\\n\\nThe first time we went, my boyfriend wanted to watch a game, so we headed over there for some grub and drinks. I ordered one of their chicken pot pies, but it just seemed really bland -- nothing overtly BAD about it, but nothing particularly tasty, either. I figured, well, it's English food -- maybe I should try something else next time. The rest of the experience was okay, but nothing really stood out -- oh, except the fact that they don't serve any hard alcohol, and I'm not much of a beer fan. I had cider instead.\\n\\nSo, next time rolled around, a month or so ago. We met some friends there, and granted, it was fairly late (around 9:30/10ish). We asked the waitress if they were still serving food and she said yes, but then it took her forever to come back and get our orders (and they weren't slammed, either -- there were 2 waitresses but the place was fairly quiet). When we finally did get our food (I'd ordered a chicken sandwich this time) I was once again underwhelmed. Bland, boring, not particularly appetizing -- and mind you, we were starving since we'd somehow skipped dinner.\\n\\nMaybe the waitress was having a bad day, too, because she wasn't very friendly, took her time taking our orders, and was slow on checking our table. We weren't a loud, rowdy bunch, either -- all we wanted was a few drinks and a decent meal, but I'm thinking that BB Rover's is not the place I'll go in the future if I want either.

If you like beer, I mean you really like beer, not just Bud Light and all the other brands of sewer water out there, you HAVE to check this place out! The only place that has a better selection that I've found so far is the Flying Saucer. Unfortunately, they also have that sterile corporate feel I've come to expect from most chains. BB's is a nice, warm, quaint, neighborhood beer pub. To me, it's everything a neighborhood pub should be. The bar tenders are VERY knowledgeable about the beer they serve, they not only work there, they too have a love for beer (I can't speak to the waitresses since we always sit at the bar). Two things, if you want a place where you can do a couple (or even one) shot, don't waste your time. All they serve is beer and a couple wines. While I'm sure they'd be happy to see you, if you're just going to order a Lone Star or Bud Light, go somewhere else, you people really irritate me! How could you go to an establishment that serves somewhere around 300 beers and order that crap? OK, it's actually three things, this is my only \\"complaint\\" about BB's. They have a pretty limited tap selection, the vast majority of what they serve is in bottles, while I wish they had more taps I suspect it's far more practical to stock bottles since they don't do the volume necessary to be turning the kegs over in a reasonable time.

As it was, it just tasted like some mushy alfredo sauce with a few lumps in it. Service was just okay. The server clearly forgot my order and then told me it was coming up as everyone else was already powering through theirs. When it arrived, no sorry, no explanation. As well, she never bothered to ask if we wanted pepper (or maybe go the extra mile and ask if we wanted extra parmesan). No bread either, which is a nice plus at most Italian restaurants.

It's a catch 22 - you really should only go if you're under 25, but I don't know many in their early 20s who can afford bottle service.  There was a long line to get in.  I don't understand why anyone would wait in line to get a drink when there are a million other places within walking distance, but we were on some kind of \\"list\\" and cut to the front of the line.  They show us to our table which was right next to a go go dancing platform.  I sat my husband down with a clear view of the barely dressed dancer, and he stopped complaining.  Next is the production where the waitress brings over the bottles.  And they're on !Fire!  It basically works out to a $50 bottle of liquor with $300 sparklers.

My taste buds loved the journey to Flavor Town. I would swipe right on those hand-pressed tortillas. Oh, and they pay their workers a decent wage... and they're in the restaurant industry. \\n\\nHow could I not support? \\n\\nOh, what's that, playa? You're going to eat there? Tonight, you say? Ouch! Stop twisting my arm. Shoot. Gah! OK, here's more info:\\n*****\\nI. FOOD: Don't think this is the Mexican-American joint that serves a larger-than-your-head burrito smothered a disgusting, diabetes-inducing, and colon-killing sauce. They prioritize quality (i.e. freshness and authenticness) over quantity. What I devoured:\\n\\n*Guac and chips: Stahp. You're thinking I'm a basic b**** who drinks Starbucks, watches reality TV, and listens to Katy Perry. But I'm not. (I couldn't pick Katy Perry out of a lineup to save my mom.) \\n\\nTheir guac is hella ridiculously chunky and flavorful -- kind of like me. Oh, and they perfectly salt the chips, as if Salt Bae did it himself. (Reference: http://bit.ly/2o02DG9.)\\n\\n*Fish Taco: Even though I think Black Rooster Taqueria could use a sauce to better marry the ingredients together, they fried the white fish well, and the generous toppings of pickled red cabbage, cilantro, and radish provided a good contrast, texturally. \\n\\n*Achiote Pork: Slow roasted pork in banana leaf, achiote, pickled onion, cilantro, and habanero salsa. Very good. \\n\\n*Vegetarian Taco: Errr ma goodness. My initial impression was to throw hella shade at this concoction. I mean, it had chopped kale, sauteed onions and mushrooms, for God-sakes. Once it melted in my mouth, I started happy crying because I realized I found my taco aphrodisiac.\\n\\n**Shrimp Ceviche: With red bell pepper-tomato broth, onion, cilantro, and orange, I thought it was solid. I wouldn't be too sad if I didn't have it again, though.\\n\\nII. SERVICE: Super sweet? Yes. Food arrived in a timely manner? Yes. No attitude? Yes. Did shots of tequila after they closed and ran naked while holding hands through Mills 50? Ye.... OK, that's a lie. But they would, I bet. No? OK. Sorry. Scratch that last part. \\n\\nIII. AMBIENCE & DECOR: It's like if Pinterest and the Day of the Dead had a gorgeous baby. I dig the cement floors, mismatched chairs, wooden siding, and local art. (Did you see the big black **** to the right upon entering the restaurant?) Me likes.\\n\\nIV. PRICES: I don't know. I usually don't count my money when thinking about and scarfing down tacos.\\n\\nV. OVERALL: Black Rooster Taqueria is a solid option to satisfy those taco hunger pangs. And if you disagree, cash me outside, how bow dah? \\n\\n*Note: Much love to the Indian-American brotha who joked with me about this for a hot minute as I was leaving. I hope you know our brief conversation served as the inspiration for this review."},{"name":"Blue Moon Coffee","address":"3975 Mercantile Dr, Ste 220","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4.5","text":"Just went there for the first time to get a mocah & use the WIFI.

The vast majority of the wines are European per the owner's tastes, but I think they're missing out on some great wines from South America, Australia, and the US to suit all their customers' tastes and curiosities. Also, I was disappointed to discover that they have virtually no Riesling, which is my favorite grape.

I have eaten there about 20 times. It is definitely the best in Austin, and Austin has many good restaurants, of course. This is the cream of the crop, though, easily. If you don't like healthy, stay away, and I don't mean fake meat kind of \\"healthy\\", I mean fresh vegetables, NO sugar, seaweed... that kind of healthy. The healthy that tastes healthy. Very lovely for dates, friends, family, alone (I usually dislike eating alone but it is such a peaceful atmosphere, good energy, and such high quality, delicious food that I always have a good experience whether with others or alone). Very sweet people who work there. This is a true Austin institution that has been around since the 1980's and keeps Austin weird, and as we know, that is a very good thing and needed due to all the sad yuppification and gentrification happening. This place doesn't sell-out they are just like they were 30 years ago. GORGEOUS gardens, fountains, trees, and interior too. Very clean. Some people eat here every day, and they are the best looking, healthiest people, my goodness! That food does wonders. Enjoy :) P.S. There is often yoga, bellydancing, meditation, deeksha, and other cool stuff happening just next door. Children eat at 1/2 off adult prices, under 5 eat free.

Why? Well, the story goes like this: I searched via Yelp for a Chinese place with delivery since I was short on time and wanted some good Chinese food. I ordered online, $10 minimum with a $3 delivery fee. Doesn't sound so bad so far.. The delivery time estimation was 45-60 minutes, which I thought was long, but whatever. However, much to my surprise, my food arrived within 30 minutes. So, kudos for fast delivery. I rushed to the door to grab my takeout and was in hurry to come back to my room, so perhaps, it's my fault for not checking the contents of what I ordered. But I trusted them since it said seafood chow mien on the receipt that was attached on the outside of the bag. Then, as I open and look through the contents of my bag, I realize they gave me the wrong order! It was definitely not seafood chow mien, but some sort of seafood stir fry with no chow mien. Although I felt cheated, I thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt and just eat it anyway since I didn't have time to fuss around and call the restaurant back. Bottom line: after tasting the dish, I have one word to offer, \\"bleh\\". Shrimp wasn't fresh and was overcooked.. the overall seasoning was way too salty and just disappointing. \\n\\nWhat I learned: always look at the contents of your restaurant delivery and I wouldn't recommend ordering from Wok N Roll if you're seeking awesome Chinese food for it failed to hit the spot for me."},{"name":"Zoes Kitchen","address":"5601 Brodie Ln, Ste 1525","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I need to start going more often.

It has some great things going for it.  It is locally owned and within walking distance to me.  It has two good things going for it, so it got two stars.  Now for what i didn't like.\\n\\nYou can't tell that they are local.  There are absolutely no personal touches to it.  It feels like you're in a truck stop somewhere along the highway.  Instead of promoting their own store, they promote that they buy somebody else's yogurt, and that it uses Hershey's chocolate.  Again, this makes it feel like it is not local.  And, compared to their competition, the yogurt doesn't taste good.  \\n\\nTheir toppings.  Probably what i liked least about this place.  There is no fruit.  The topping that they do have seem like they have been sitting out for days.  This is probably because  they receive such little traffic that the same toppings sit out and they never have to refill.  Also, it seemed like half of the toppings containers were empty.  The toppings didn't even have labels.  I put old stale kit kat on my yogurt thinking it was health bar.\\n\\nEmployees.  I have never seen a dedicated employee working the counter.  When i bought yogurt, somebody from Marco's pizza came over and rang me up.  Another reason it made me feel like i was in a truck stop somewhere.\\n\\nWhen you put all things together, it just felt like the owner just doesn't care about this place.  I think somebody just threw a yogurt shop in there hoping that it would run itself and it would be an easy revenue stream.  There are so many wonderful locally owned yogurt places out there that stand out way more.  Even though i try to only walk places to get food, i have no problem starting up my car and driving right past this place.  \\n\\nI would be surprised if the owner actually cares enough to read  these reviews, but if you do, please, visit some other yogurt places and see how much effort they put into their business.

After just one time here, I can already tell that it's going to be one of my favorite places around campus. \\n\\nI ordered the chicken curry pie floater (meaning that it comes with mashed potatoes and gravy) with a small side salad. The curry chicken pie was fabulous - so warm, tasty, filled with veggies and chicken alike, and all-around perfect to warm me up on this cold day. The salad came with lots of different veggies (carrots, cherry tomatoes, lots of greens), and it seemed to be quite fresh. The mashed potatoes and gravy were amazing as well - so creamy and whipped, and the potatoes were so good I didn't even need the gravy! (I still ate it with the gravy though, because what fun is having it and not eating it?) My boyfriend, who has been to Australia and had many an Australian pie, also tasted a bite (or five - rude), and he said the pie and mashed potatoes were very authentic and reminiscent of Australia. Plus, when I called the order in, the girl who took my order was...*gasp* AUSTRALIAN! She had an adorable Aussie accent, which just made my whole experience that much better. \\n\\nAnd last but certainly not least, the service was spectacular. The server had forgotten to have my pie and salad ready since I had called it in, and she was incredibly apologetic about it. Despite the fact that it only took her five minutes to get everything together, she gave me a large side salad instead of the small I had ordered, free of charge, because of the wait. \\n\\nTo sum it up, I will definitely be returning and trying more pies! Affordable, quick, and great service? How could anyone say no to that?! \\n\\nTip - if you are needing your pie in a hurry, no need to call it in! They have pies ready (I'm assuming they bake all their pies daily), so they just pop the pie you want into the oven to reheat.

We also had sweet corn beignets (pretty good), a watermelon + tomato salad (pretty good), and a cheese plate (decent- their soft cheese was really too pungent, almost like a bleu, which I didn't love and I'm a huge fan of camemberts and strong cheeses).  The mains were a Wagyu flank steak with fingerling potatoes and a hand rolled gnocchi dish.  They were okay.  I asked for the steak medium, and it came out rare.  The food was great, but it just wasn't quite right. \\n\\nThe problem was the service.  As noted above, we didn't order until 9:30-- a full hour after we had arrived.  Even though we were seated about 30-40 minutes after our reservation time, the waiter didn't even come to the table until 20 minutes after that.  Not even with water!  Whenever we finished our drinks, we had to flag him down to get another one.  No one ever took away our empty glasses, cluttering the table.  They forgot to bring out one of our appetizers (my favorite one- the salad).  The mains came out pretty late, which is why I didn't ask them to cook the meat further.  One member of our party had scraped her hand and was bleeding, but they had no band-aids anywhere (really?  no first aid kit in a RESTAURANT?!).  Honestly, the place seemed really understaffed so I'm not too surprised about it.  We ended up leaving--without ordering dessert--at 10:50pm (of course, it took forever to pay the bill as well).  \\n\\nWhile the food was good, the truly truly subpar service cannot be excused and really detracted from the experience.

I looked at the menu online and it read like food porn.  I went expecting it to be a sublime happy hour experience.  Little bites of heaven, straight from the \\"farm.\\"\\n\\nWhat I encountered was a mix of pretty a-okay bits, and bits of plain old bad.  All in all, seeing as how I generally don't like eating experiences, especially those I have out, to be like a grab bag with boobie prizes mixed in with the goodies, it was not a very satisfying experience.\\n\\nThe service was slow as molasses going uphill in a snowstorm but very considerate and sweet.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful, but I'm guessing they were a bit under-staffed given how rarely she paid us a visit.  \\n\\nThe decor was...well...different.  The department store theme was embodied well by the art, but the color scheme was a bit trite and dated looking, and carrying it through everything, including the staff uniforms, gave the whole place the feeling of being a bit overstyled.  Again, I need to qualify this all by saying that everyone was very kind.  I don't care what the wrapper looks like if the stuff inside is sweet and satisfying and they were every bit of that, at least as far as I was concerned.\\n\\nThe real problem was the food.  We ordered a mix of things from the happy hour menu.  The lamb leg - really just little kabobs - was not very tasty and a bit tough.  A little more time in the marinade or a little less cooking, or a combination of both, would have served them well.  They were served with a yogurt sauce that was a total throw away.  It lacked both texture and flavor.  \\n\\nThe sliders looked promising, but ended up being a bit overcooked as well.  I also have a pet peeve about burgers that are more about the bread than the meat and this was a good example of that particular style of sandwich.  The condiments didn't add much.  The whole thing was well dressed but not that flavorful, and the whole package was a little sloppy.  \\n\\nThe Jalapeno chips were a treat.  They tasted good and they were very crispy.  However, they were no bargain at two dollars (for about 5 chips), and they were mighty spicy.  Not for the meeker palate.\\n\\nJust as I was about to call the whole eating experience mediocre, it turned bad when the hot wings showed up.  They were dessicated little bits of fowl tasting fowl.  The texture led me to believe they were frozen when they went into the fryer, and the sauce was the worst kind of old school cantonese sweet and sour.  The flavor was reminiscent of that kind of sweet, sticky, Chinese restaurant glaze made from catsup, sugar and vinegar that one sometimes encounters on those desperate forays into Chinese eateries in suburbia.  Uh, it was gross, okay?\\n\\nThe cocktails weren't very cold.  Nothing is as bad as a tepid martini.  The cocktail of the day was tasty, but not great.  \\n\\nAll in all, it was definitely a one time only affair.  We left and went to Saucebox and enjoyed an infinitely better happy hour.

The lettuce was like a salad mix you might get at the grocery store, a little bit strange for tacos, but fine if you eat it more like a salad first and then eat your tacos.

I wish I had taken a picture because there were two or three loaves of bread, a few cinnamon roles that looked 3 days old, and a few other assorted pastries that looked several days old. How can a place with bread in the name have so few loaves of bread? After ordering (we got takeout), we went and stood by the food window. During the time we were standing there (which was quite a while), we heard the employees acting super unprofessional. First they were going on and on about how they were going to punch each other in the face, then we heard them listing off all the foods they didn't have. Their behavior was as if they didn't realize there was a big window in which the customers could see what they were doing.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered a Sierra Turkey sandwich. While we were standing there we heard them tell one of the staff to ask the customer (us), if it was ok to make the sandwich on a different bread because they didn't have the right bread (see... out of bread). The employee then says something to the extent of \\"it's all just bread\\" and when we got the sandwich, it was indeed on a different bread. Next this same employee mentioned the sandwich she made had cheese on it. My bf is lactose intolerant so that was a no-go. After she asked if he wanted the sandwich as is, and he said no, the staff member goes \\"Can I have it?\\" to us. Like what? This type of stuff goes on for about 10 minutes while we wait for food. Then our order comes up and, after specifically specifying that we wanted a side of bread and after the cashier rang it up on the receipt as having bread, this same staff member goes \\"Your chips are one kettle and one baked, we only had one kettle.\\" (another thing they were out of). She did correct the order when we asked but it was annoying. Finally, to top all this off, the iced green tea tasted GROSS. I can't really put my finger on what the weird taste is, but it was almost as if there was no actual tea in the drink and it was just green sugar water.\\n\\nAlso, the pickle that came with the sandwich was an abomination and a disgrace to pickles everywhere... but I think all Panera pickles are like that.\\n\\nAs I said, I will never be back to this location.

I hate it when they have to split the group but okay, I understand  that perhaps they couldn't accomodate all of us at one table. We had called earlier to push our reservation half an hour later, twice, and they were fine with that. Our server (only one server for our group of 19 people) was a little timid but very nice even though we got quite rowdy. I sort of felt sorry for her. \\n\\nThe food was just meh & took a long time to come. The dishes are small and are meant to be shared like at traditional Chinese restaurants. However, myself being the vegetarian of the group, sharing was not an option. I appreciated that the menu sectioned off all the vegetarian dishes off from the others but I was thoroughly disappointed at the only vegetarian dishes they offered. They were all some variation of wok-steamed bok choy/tofu/mushrooms and seemed to me to simply be side dishes to the other seafood/meat main dishes. \\n\\nI kind of see where the asian fusion thing comes from but nothing on the menu stood out to me as anything very creative. It was basically Chinese food made for white people & calling it a fancy name. I ended up having the Buddha Rolls which were doused in oil and tasted exactly the same as the \\"san juk guen\\" (bean curd skin rolls) you get at real Chinese dim sum. Everything in general looked quite oily. And my friend said her plain white rice tasted like plastic.\\n\\nI also like to judge restaurants by their washrooms and Terracotta's washrooms were the complete opposite of what the dining area looked like. It was like they built the whole restaurant and then realized that they forgot about the washroom and just stuffed it in an empty closet space. Anyone a few more inches taller than me would seriously have their knees touching the stall door while sitting down. There wasn't even enough room to turn around and flush.\\n\\nI honestly don't see what's so special about Terracotta.

We requested to do half and half as there were only two of us and you can't order by the slice. Turns out they don't allow that based on the specialty pizzas. Ok so we settle and just get half plain cheese and the other half the Alla Benno since they could agree to this request. We attempt to sit outside and are stopped fast in our tracks by a server that let's us know she will seat us. Then 5 minutes later she seats us exactly where we were originally headed. Ok. We wait for our pizza and are greeted by another server that is very pleasant. She brings us our pizza we notice immediately it is lacking. Very thin and not many ingredients on top. We are not impressed unfortunately. Even the cheese and crust is barely there. The very thin crust is also soggy. In addition we notice there is not any sauce so we ask to speak to the waitress. She explains that we order a white pizza which I did not realize. I did go back up to the signs hanging from the ceiling and reread that they do in fact spell out (kind of small) pizza Rosso and pizza Blanco. We actually ended up leaving but the manager asked for our feed back and wanted to know if there was anything we would recommend them to do different.

While packaging this, another lady actually ran over to Cioffi's Gourmet Kitchen store (2 doors down) to grab the goat cheese for me before they closed. Super friendly service and great quality items - what more could you want?"},{"name":"Victoria's Station & Vic's Boathouse","address":"86 Wharf St","city":"Salem","stars":"3","text":"We love this place. Go every year when we come for Halloween. Usually we eat in the bar area (Vic's Boathouse), which has the same menu as the restaurant. The bar looks out on the wharf and is very picturesque. There is a good selection of draft beers, mostly locals. We went for lunch this weekend and the service was kind of slow, but the food is delicious. I had a blue crabmeat salad sandwich with mashed potatoes which was very good. My sister had a chicken salad sandwich which she said was very good, My daughter had a veggie burger that was made with fresh ingredients. She said it was a little bland, Both had sweet potato fries that were very good. The whole restaurant is decorated very nicely and interesting to look at. Go to Vic's for a great meal!"},{"name":"Park's Edge","address":"913 Bernina Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"HORRIBLE! I cannot explain how this restaurant ruined my birthday experience. I called ahead two weeks in advance after making a reservation on open table. The manager Dan assured me on more than one occasion that they could accommodate my party of nine and allow me to come in early to set up the balloons and whatnot for the table. I arrived 35 minutes before my reservation, with balloons and party favors in tow, and was told by the host that a certain table would be available in a few minutes. As soon as the guests got up the table was bombarded by a larger party (who I later learned knew someone who worked there as the guy kept adding chairs and going in the kitchen for the guests... they gave my table away to one of their friends). I found the manager and told him that was supposed to be my table. He acted like he didn't know what I was talking about and then said he never told me over the phone that I could set up early or anything. My reservation was for 1:45 pm and the manager said he wouldn't be able to seat me until at least two. I had guests coming from three hours away to celebrate with me. When 2:15 rolled around and me and my party were squeezed in that hot box of a restaurant standing and watching everyone else eat, I saw another table get up and then even more people bombarded the table and sat down. The manager said they were a part of the first party that took the other tables. I was heated because the manager tried to tell me at first he wouldn't seat my party until they all arrived, but that party kept seating for over an hour! The manager didn't so much as offer me a glass of water, a seat, or anything! I waited in that restaurant for an hour and a half with all of my guests and no one did anything to accommodate us. The manager even kept asking me if I wanted to leave instead of eating!!! Ummmm... I made a reservation for a large group of people, all arriving separately, and we are already 45 minutes behind because of your error! We ended up leaving and I didn't even have a place to eat for my BIRTHDAY! Park's Edge ruined my birthday. I was in the parking lot crying. I would never patronize an establishment that had no regard for my time. This is one of them. THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD! I'm still upset over this and I would give 0 stars if I could."},{"name":"The Greenbriar Inn","address":"8735 N Foothills Hwy","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"We went here for the champagne brunch for our anniversary.

Love the atmosphere, the food, the staff and the owner (and the Bingo guy!).  I'm pretty picky about burgers and rarely order them, but these are GOOD. My husband and I now schedule our blood donations on Tuesday nights so we can replenish our iron with \\"Burgers and Bingo\\".  To be honest, some items are only \\"good\\" not \\"great\\" (so 4 stars, not 5), but still it's my favorite restaurant, everything considered. The pickle plate is *surprisingly* good, esp. the pickled kale stems. Redd's prioritizes using locally grown ingredients and creative preserving for the winter months. When this restaurant first opened, Chef Delicious lead a free workshop at the local GreeningRozzie environmental group on how to roast and can pumpkin (and can other things too).  Did I mention the great selection of local beers? So, what's not to like?"},{"name":"Flying Biscuit Caf√© - Midtown","address":"1001 Piedmont Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The best  French toast I've ever had.

Most people commented on the lunch buffet, so maybe that it the best time to go--especially for the price. Dinner is much more expensive and just not that great. They flavor was decent but they had a hard time cooking the chicken in my dish. Again, I haven't been there for the lunch buffet, but I'd suggest that is the time to go."},{"name":"Dumpling King","address":"40-44 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"When I stumbled upon this place, Prosperity Dumpling in NYC immediately came to mind.  Unfortunately, Dumpling King falls short of the rather iconic hole-in-the-wall that puts forth delicious house-made dumplings at 5 for a Washington.  \\n\\nFor one thing, the dumplings are purchased from neighboring shops in Chinatown so you're just paying for the preparation.  At $4 for a dozen, it's a decent, cheap fix if you need something to hold you over for a bit.  The husband and wife here are nice folks, but ya gotta make your own stuff to earn any street cred in my book."},{"name":"Sala's Hawaiian Slurp Shack","address":"1803 E Semoran Blvd","city":"Apopka","stars":"4.5","text":"I love the shaved ice here and the food. Come for the shaved ice and come back for the food!!  The barbecue is great as is all the food. Flavorful and satisfying!!  They aspire to high standards with their shaved ice and it's authentic just like in Hawaii made with pure filtered water in house. I appreciate authentic food and the owner is straight from Hawaii!!  He brings the place to life and always offers a cheerful greeting when you see him!!  Let's keep this family owned place going and give them some good patronage over the chain restaurants in apopka."},{"name":"Gunshow","address":"924 Garrett St, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Oh my goodness - absolutely phenomenal experience. Some of the best food I've ever had ever. Nothing disappointing and surprisingly filling portions (even when shared among 4 people). I love the concept, although it is a bit overwhelming.\\n\\nIf you're concerned about service, definitely make an early reservation. We were seated at 6:45pm on a Wednesday, by 8:00pm the place was full and the food started to come our way a bit slower, but we were well taken care of by supporting staff.\\n\\nI'll be going back regularly to experience new chefs & recipes."},{"name":"Taco Shack","address":"12439 Metric Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"I always see lines around this place on the weekends so I thought I'd check it out. Not good. Everything was slopped together (I wasn't a fan of the overly generous fillings others liked) and my cheese wasn't even melted. Still cold. I had to try to move the cheese under the eggs to get it to melt. The flavor was totally void of seasoning. No salt or anything could be detected in the beans or eggs. So if you only get bacon and potato tacos (is that even a taco then?) you might like it. But only because the bacon's saltiness would make it taste better. The salsa didn't help any with the flavor. I also tried to order coffee and thought better once she said she only had sugar or sweet and low for it. Eh... I'm sure that was made at like 8 and has been sitting there. They also got our order wrong. Oh well. I won't be back."},{"name":"Figs by Todd English","address":"42 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My only complaint is the freakin' wait which was an hour and a half on a Thursday. \\n\\nThe pizza was good, thin crust, pizza. You only need 1 pie for 3 people FYI. Half prosciutto and fig and the other half was called The Red Sox (basically peppers and onion). Loved the fig prosciutto and gorgonzola pie the best. Cesar salad also good, nothing too special about it. \\n\\nOur waitress was really nice, very timely with everything as they're usually rushing groups in and out of there. But if you're looking for good pizza either take out or dine in, this is the place in the area."},{"name":"Pita House Austin","address":"4101 W Parmer Ln, Ste C","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Finally, this is the gyro I've been looking for.

In my opinion it is easily the best Thai food on the block. I can't eat enough fresh rolls. The service is outstanding as well. My only bad experience, the other night I ordered my favorite soup Tom Kha, and when I got to the bottom there were 3 tiny pieces of chicken. I'm a vegetarian and since they advertise this as veg friendly I was disappointed. Luckily I'm not fanatical, I understand things happen in a kitchen where meat is prepared and that's life.
