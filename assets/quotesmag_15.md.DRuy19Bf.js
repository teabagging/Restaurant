The guy doesn't get it - I am a wine NERD whose head is filled with lots of useless wine facts.

We also shared the fried chickpeas w/ capers which was good, and my boyfriend had the arugula & beet plate that was mostly beets- but still delish. Then we shared the skirt steak main, which like Top Flr, comes a la carte. I really despise this way of serving food-- how can Sound Table (and TopFlr) charge $20 for a skirt steak and nothing else? I can certainly pay less than that and additionally get a choice of 2 sides at other restaurants. It's just bizarre, and for that reason alone I don't recommend coming here if you want a traditional dinner.  \\n\\nWe had dessert, and we went with the chocolate cake w/ caramel salted ice cream. The cake was served warm, almost like a brownie, and was very good. The ice cream definitely tasted like Morelli's version of the flavor but that was not indicated on the menu.

We didn't feel hungry or overly full, and that's pretty rare.\\n\\nI see the appeal of Sound Table - it's trendy and suitable for young crowds and first dates. They play cool music. Their servers are stick skinny and wear outfits straight from the mannequins at Urban Outfiters. But there's a lot of hassle involved with parking and reservations.

Sweetness is unchanged.\\n\\nCaught, cooked on the boat and delivered daily throughout the season then served chilled accompanied by the perfect, sweet and tangy mustard sauce.  The vinegar in the mustard heightens the already sweet meat.  The super colossal MP as of this review,  just shy of $45.  Impressive when top seafood restaurants in Vegas charge upward of $100 each.\\n\\nNice selection of live oysters  focusing on the east coast varietals.  Clean oceanic jus and flavor.  The sampler is the best way to enjoy these incredible bivalves. Six pairs of different oysters, freshly grated horseradish and some zesty, acidic cocktail sauce.\\n\\nGood selection of fresh fish.  The jumbo lump crab coated grouper is outstanding.  The grouper firm and moist the jumbo lump crab also well cooked, with a few crispy bits on the outside, juicy and moist on the inside.  The texture mirrors that of the fish.  A simple lemon butter sauce adds richness and rounds out the entire dish.\\n\\nSweet, fresh Gulf shrip (no hint of BP, JK).  Firmer in texture than South East Asian shrimp, lighter and sweeter.  Lightly dusted with flour and deep fried.   A dish of deep fried alligator nuggets with its moist but firm texture rounds out great cooked starters.\\n\\nThe ultimate test, a five pound Atlantic lobster.  The lobster is broken down at the table.  The tamale is reserved and is perfect when mixed with some of the clarified butter.   Buttery soft claws, uber sweet leg meat, firm tail still translucent in the middle.  Perfect cooking.\\n\\nService is excellent.  Extremely efficient, friendly and accommodating.  Despite the restaurant being fully booked, three servers worked together to split all dishes and dissemble the lobster for everyone to share.\\n\\nSmall but well chosen wine list.  Reasonable 2x retail markup.\\n\\nWorthy."},{"name":"Vic's Bar-B-Que","address":"3502 Burleson Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The BBQ was not good and I'm not hard to please.

Everything was good, worth the price. It was good enough that if I was craving a seafood boil in Boston, I would come back here. The shrimp across both dishes were aces - big, juicy and not overcooked. I love rich, velvety, deeply developed curries. BS curry sauce was not there but it certainly has the potential. The curry sauce favored the coconut over the curry flavors but overall good. The potatoes, corn and andouille were all cooked through. I found the sausage delicious. The Bootleg Sauce had the heat and ALMOST the depth of flavor. I like garlic and love it in my seafood boils but found this a bit garlic dominant. I love whatever oil is used to get the sauce to stick to the boil ingredients though - stick to your ribs, need a breath mint afterwards kind of goodness. I ordered the Extra Kick sauce on the side ... it forced me to stop eating more than once to blow my nose, thus, it passed the heat indicator test.

Had really high hopes for this place and was really looking forward to it.  Unfortunately, left feeling a little underwhelming.\\n\\nIt's a casual fine dining place.  I saw a mix of hipsters and older folks out for a nice meal.  The ambiance is nice.  It wasn't too busy for a Thursday night.  Once we checked in we were directed to the upstairs loft area and were told of the day's specials.  We ordered the foi gras and bone marrow as starters and the foi gras burger and fish special as the main course. We're deprived of foi gras in CA so we decided to go all out during our getaway.\\n\\nFoi Gra - The foi gra is infused with a type of nut (unsure which nut) and is served with a fruity sauce and a biscuit that was kind of sweet.  The foi by itself tasted great and the nutty flavor brought a good bitterness to each bite.  But once adding the sauce and biscuit it transformed into a desserty plate and was a bit too over powering for our taste.  Should have ordered this to come as dessert.  \\n\\nBone Marrow - This dish was very disappointing.  Not a whole lot of bone marrow (unseasoned), but a ton of what tasted like a sour cream based sauce with lime.  The sauce overpowered the bone marrow beyond recognition.  Even with a little sauce, combined with the nann type bread provided, felt like I was eating a cheap mexican inspired fish taco with hardly any fish.  Was not happy with this dish, especially compared to other bone marrow dishes I've had in the past.\\n\\nFoi Gra Burger - I had to eat this with fork and knife.  Burger was made to order but the only unique thing was the foi, which was a $20 added fee.  Burger was average, but the foi, which was lightly grilled was very rich and creamy.  It made the burger.  I would not recommend ordering the regular burger.\\n\\nFish - I don't remember what type of fish it was, but it's a white fish (not mahi, bass, or halibut).  This was actually cooked to perfection and in my opinion saved the night for us.  Very light and crispy on the outside, this was a very savory dish.  \\n\\nWe did not opt for dessert since the options were limited here.  For my out of towner friends looking for a nice, pricier meal while visiting Portland, I would probably not suggest Little Bird.  However, we do realize that some of the food flavors may be focused towards preferences from the Northwest that us folks from Southern Califoirnia may not be as used to.

We recently strolled in on a Sunday around 1pm expecting the usual \\"people hanging from the rafters\\" brunch madness and were pleasantly surprised to snag a seat at the bar right away. I love their brunch. In some ways it's the things you would expect - breakfast tacos, biscuits & gravy, hash, grits bowl, etc. - but in subtle ways, each dish is elevated with the addition of great ingredients. For the tacos, it's yummy chorizo & authentic tortillas. For the grits bowl, it's the fact that it's vegan and packed with veggies. My hubby has an unhealthy obsession with the hash bowl and its blend of super crispy potatoes and bacon (though he wished I add that it would be nice if you didn't have to pay extra to add eggs to it). This is important - there is no greater brunch crime than undercooked potatoes. I love the flatbread, which comes smeared with hummus & topped with olives, feta, banana peppers, greens, and two sunny side up eggs - those ingredients really go well together. Sides of bacon & sausage are $4, and there are some non-meat sides for $2 & $3. They serve Batdorf & Bronson coffee, along with handmade sodas and -yaaaaaaaay - proper brunch cocktails (not just mimosas). You can order a waffle as a side but otherwise there are no pancakes or french toast etc. on the menu, so if you tend to go the sweet route for brunch, beware.

People can be so stupid.  When's the last time you went out to a sushi restaurant, especially in Boston, and had GOOD-quality sushi for less than $25ish a person?  At many places, a six-piece spicy tuna roll can be $7 or $8, and the more special rolls are easily $15 each. \\n\\nThat being said, we walked in and saw the prices right away (they're not hidden), and this is very average for a sushi buffet, especially a good one with a lot of offerings.  Not only was there sashimi, but there was also plan old sushi (rare for a buffet -- they want you to eat rice and fill up).  There was eel, squid (rare to find on a buffet), octopus, shrimp, all kinds of things.  There were also a good 45 different kinds of maki.  There were things I've never seen on a buffet before, such as salmon roe in a cucumber -- amazing.  I love the fancier rolls, so I was very happy.  There was also a great raw bar (oysters at dinner time).  There is a large salad area, as well.  There are four soups, and a hot bar that was amazing.  I say the hot bar was amazing because at sushi buffets, the hot bar is usually greasy, cheap chinese food, like chicken with vegetables, beef with broccoli, lo mein, etc.  This is NOT the case at Maki Maki.  The hot bar was exceptional!  First off, it was mostly seafood, which was great for someone like me who doesn't eat meat.  Second, not only was it mostly seafood, but there was lobster (only available at dinner time) and chinese-style spicy fried squid.\\n\\nSo say you go to a sushi place and you eat 2 rolls, one regularm and one \\"fancy.\\"  Chances are you're spending at least $20 + tax on those two rolls alone.  So quit complaining that dinner here is $30; that is perfectly normal for a buffet.  They also have to account for all the food that gets wasted, i.e. people taking more than they can eat.  If you get an appetizer at a sushi place or soup or something, you're nearing the $30 range anyway.  \\n\\nThe people that say this buffet has standard stuff are out of their minds...have they ever been to a sushi buffet?

I also love it for the random experiences I've had there, such as meeting a man who pretended he was Akon at a good friend's bachelorette party, or the time I found a kickass (or disgustingly gaudy) shamrock beaded necklace in the women's bathroom. However, if you're looking for a classy time, please look elsewhere. Clery's does not equal class. Also, beware, there is always, always, always a long line to get in on weekends (even in the cold winter months) and there is ANOTHER line to get downstairs to the dance floor. Get there early if you want to save yourself time standing around."},{"name":"Aladdin's Grill","address":"148 Squire Rd","city":"Revere","stars":"4.5","text":"My husband and I popped into Aladdin's Grill yesterday evening for a low key birthday dinner after we read so many good reviews on Yelp...and we weren't disappointed! \\n\\nWe ordered the hummus, tabouleh, and grape leaves for apps, and then the chicken shawarma entree (me) and beef shawarma sandwich (him) for dinner.

It sits inside the beautiful Fairmont Copley Plaza in Copley Square, Boston. I have never had the chance to stay at the hotel, but my family has and enjoyed it very much. It's great to dine at OAK Long Bar when there's nice weather to sit outside and have a nice afternoon glass of wine. It is definitely pricey, but expected as the Fairmont is an upscale place to both stay and to dine. My first time, my Family and I sat outside during a beautiful day at the end of the summer. We had wine and salad and it was a great experience. Great service, great atmosphere, and delicious wine and food. Since then, one of our dear family Friends who was there that day has passed. My sister and I went back there recently and we sat inside. It was just as fun and lively inside, A different vibe but still a great atmosphere. We ordered drinks & toasted to our dear family friend. We knew he was watching over us at that moment. My sister ordered an Aperol-spritzer and I had a Sauvignon Blanc. The server was nice enough to pour me a taste of the wine to make sure that I joyed it, and which I did, before she poured the full glass. I enjoyed my wine and my sister liked her spritzer as well. We ended up talking to a really fun Australian couple who is sitting next to us. It's very easy to make friends in this kind of environment. My sister and I decided to get an appetizer to hold us over before we went to dinner elsewhere. We decided on the crab and avocado toast. The server recommended that we try that because it's one of their most commonly ordered appetizers. It was about $18. All the appetizers were around this price so you can only imagine how much the dinners are. Hence why we decided to go elsewhere. I'm sure the dinners are amazing, though. They have brick oven pizzas that are made right in front of you if you're sitting at the bar. Pretty cool. It has a very old fashion vibe to it which is very cool. You feel like you should be wearing a big hat and smoking a cigarette out of a cigarette holder. I highly recommend having this experience once or twice. Ideally ones outside and once inside. If you are not a hotel guest, parking can be tricky. Street parking on Sundays is free, but also competitive. It may be easy to park in a lot just make sure you check the price because they can be pricey."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Great atmosphere, good drinks, oysters were good, but not cold enough.

The easiest way to describe the inside of the restaurant is to say that it is not modern.  It has a sort of homey feel, much like a diner.  The interior is outdated, but that doesn't matter as long as the food is good.  Also, the crowd is mostly older people.\\n\\nSERVICE: The bad service is the only reason this restaurant is getting three stars.  The waitress was extremely unpleasant and unfriendly.  She never once smiled, and had a really poor attitude.  When she was asked for something, she acted as if she was put out.  She started to become more pleasant as we were finishing, because she knew tip time was near.  We were not fooled.  After we ate, we decided to sit for a few minutes before we left.  The waitress basically stared at us until we left.  Needless to say, her tip reflected her service.\\n\\nFOOD:  No complaints here.  The food was great, and the portions were very big.  The bread and salad was fresh, and all of the pasta dishes our table got were very good.  \\n\\nOverall, the food was great.

It was my first time there so I drove past the restaurant lot and decided to park in a seemingly deserted lot with two cars and space for one more compact vehicle (mini). As soon as I parked, another car came and tried to steal my spot, even though there were cars parked all over the sidewalk. Well, as I was reparking a homeless man pretending to be a parking lot attendant tapped on the window with a flashlight and politely directed me and asked for $5. I had a $20 and he said he'd be right back with some change. As soon as he disappeared down an alley, I knew I got scammed by a crackhead. We decided to be responsible citizens and inform the policeman literally a corner away. I felt like an absolute idiot, but tried not to let it ruin the night. \\n\\nI was there for a birthday party of a foodie with high standards so I knew that although the neighborhood was sketch, the experience would be something to look forward to. While the early birds were waiting for the birthday girl at the bar, I had my first drink to take the edge off. The East Bank Cocktail was a strong bourbon with a dark syrup soaked cherry. Now keep in mind that I'm a 5'2 Asian female who frequently gets mistaken for a teenager. My bartender eyed me up and down and silently made my drink. Cool. Just out of premature habit, I instantly tried to flash my ID, but she didn't even glance at it. I think she heard my inner alcoholic thirstily crying because it was gooood. \\n\\nThe two individual restrooms are gender neutral, but even on a weekend night they weren't disgusting. I honestly like to judge a restaurant on the bathrooms and these were chic and clean. I felt comfortable claiming it as an escape spot. Right by the restrooms is an outdoor patio for the smokers. Most of it is covered and it was raining pretty heavily, but there were always people hanging outside at different intervals throughout the night. \\n\\nThe restaurant opens into a tiny space with a hostess stand and a steep, flight of stairs directly in front of the door. Keep in mind, that there is a legit parking lot with a real parking attendant. There is a DJ stand by the bar spinning good music and the whole place has an eclectic feel perfect for the young, urban professional. By the time I made it upstairs to our reserved table, I was making some interesting dinner partners. The conversation was flowing and I decided on the Duck Breast L'Orange which was excellent. My girl date is a vegetarian and had the Quinoa Salad. Our dinner companions decided on the mixed greens, lamb chops, and Oxtail Tacos which were recommended by our server. Everything was delicious. My dinner mates were literally swooning. \\n\\nI ordered a second drink called the White Tiger which was a cocktail made with \\"absinthe\\" and condensed milk.

Was happy that they weren't too busy, but that's where the good part ends.  The entire experience was terrible.  First, the hostess was less than thrilled that we walked in.  She put us at the very first table by the door, which after the experience, was probably because she didn't want to walk too far.  The table and seats were very dirty.  I was wondering if they forgot to clean them between patrons.  I stood there waiting to get someone's attention to ask them to clean it, but the three workers that were next to our booth were carrying on a conversation and wouldn't acknowledge us.  Finally I got someone's attention and the waiter did a quick wipe.\\n\\nWe placed an order for appetizers, but then our waiter quickly disappeared and never took our meal order.  He brought our apps and still didn't take our meal order, even though the menus were still on the table.  We had to tell him we wanted to order our meal.  (The buffalo chicken tenders we got were terrible, btw.  A few of them were so chewy I swear they weren't chicken).\\n\\nHe finally brought our meals and was trying to place the plates on the table around the dirty appetizer plates we still had.  No common sense!  We then ate our food, which was below average, and he didn't ask us how everything was until we were on our last bite.  We also had a children's meal that was supposed to come with dessert but he never acknowledged it and quickly brought the bill.  We did ask for the kid's dessert and he did go get it, but he definitely wouldn't have offered.\\n\\nThe entire experience was a combination of all of the ways you \\"shouldn't\\" treat a patron at a restaurant.  It was even below just going through the motions.  We also looked around and it seemed like it was all very young staff, many of them just hanging around and talking.

If you like the Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger at Jack in the Box, this is the bigger and more sophisticated version.  The Johnnie doesn't mess with lettuce tomato and pickles.  It's a 3/4 pound pattie, a ton of blue cheese, a lot of horseradish cheese, crisp bacon  and about a cup of mayo between two buns.  In other words it is heart stoppingly good.\\n\\nThere was so much mayo, cheese and grease oozing out of the burger that I had a complimentary and very tasty dipping sauce for my fries.  It wasn't pretty but the taste was heavenly.  \\n\\nMy first bite was the best.  I seriously thought that I had found a burger better than the current reigning champion at Taylor's Automatic Refresher in San Francisco.

By the time the meal was over the Johnnie Burger, much like the tOSU football team, wasn't able to hold off the dominance from California.  Sorry Buckeye fans.\\n\\nBut on the grand scale I do think the Johnnie Burger was impressive enough to squeeze into a tie for second place on my list with the burgers from 23 Degrees in Hollywood, CA and Father's Office in Culver City, CA.  I'm still amazed that less than a year ago the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead room service had the best burger I have ever tasted and held the title since 2003.

It's not awful food, but I wouldn't rave about it. It's better than Agave, but not as good as the Rio. I definitely think the Rio's Mexican food is better (steak fajitas = amazing) and fresher-tasting. One thing that I really didn't like about Efrain's is the fact that the tortillas weren't homemade.

Nothing on the menu is already healthy but you can try to make a healthier option by substituting egg whites instead of regular eggs. As with most restaurants, egg whites are extra. You can also get a side of fruit or whole wheat toast instead of white, but let's be honest.

Mmmm, wrong choice.\\n\\nA small basket of bread with soft butter (which deserves a star just for that).\\n\\nFor appetizers, I ordered the roasted marrow bones and husband got a standard field greens salad.  I have never, ever had marrow but I've been trying to get out of my food comfort zone and also having watched Anthony Bourdain eat it with such gusto, I figured, it MUST be good.  Obviously, I am not Mr. Bourdain and I did not enjoy it. At all.  It's not so much that it tasted bad, in fact, the actual marrow didn't really taste like anything, just mushiness with a bunch of weird overpowering chutney on top.  Very disappointed. But please, see the preface*. It came with 3 slices of bread. And I ate all of it. For $12, you can bet I'm gonna eat everything. As far as the salad, it was just greens, nothing else, with a very lemony vinaigrette. It served its purpose but wouldn't order it again..\\n\\nEntrees consisted of the grilled trout and flat iron steak.  The trout itself was pretty good. They deboned and separated the flesh from the skin so the \\"meat\\" was cooked perfectly moist and the skin was nice and crispy.  It was laid on a bed of baked/roasted squash/apples/onions dressed in a curry aioli.  I was intrigued when I read the curry part on the menu but it just didn't do it for me to eat it with the trout.  Flat iron steak was only okay. I tasted just a bite and it was cooked medium rare (good) but had a peculiar spice on it that I couldn't quite put my finger on (not so good).\\n\\nFor dessert we got the pumpkin ice cream profiteroles.  I liked the ice cream, not so much the profiterole part.\\n\\nProbably the best part about the meal (besides the VERY good service we received) was the baby macarons that they give you with your check.

But what would have happened if we had just waited for an order that will never come?!  He was very embarrassed and sorry and offered us free dessert, but we did not want to stay one more minute there.

However, I will clarify the points I made.\\n\\nThe reason that I returned to your restaurant a 3rd time, after spending $350 the first time for a table of 4, and $125 the 2nd time for my wife and me, was because we enjoyed the fine food and attentive service. No amount of \\"complimentary\\" product would entice me to return if I didn't already feel good about the establishment.  I did not seek out or request any complimentary dishes or drinks. These were offered by you and your father.\\n\\nPrior to this most recent dinner, when we were discussing the wine, we spoke about serving the bruschetta and prosecco, which your father and you so graciously offered on a 'complimentary' basis.  When, if not at the beginning of the meal do you serve bruschetta....and prosecco?  Certainly not at the end of a meal!! Why would I provide a drink order that your waiter had suggested, in addition to the wine that was already on the table, if I knew (and he should too) prosecco was coming, alongside the bruschetta???  Only when I asked the waiter about the special arrangements that you and I had made did he then bring out an amuse, and not the bruschetta that we discussed.  AM I MISSING SOMETHING??? Again, if there was no prior mention of bruschetta and prosecco, than I (and my guests) wouldn't have had any expectation, and thus would not have been perturbed about the lack of at the beginning of the evening. The whole situation was awkward, to say the least.\\n\\nMy second point is regarding service.  Yes, you did come over to the table, but only one time, not several as you state. Not that I care, as long as I get proper service from the waitstaff (which was sporadic and infrequent that night).  As it turned out, during the appetizers and split pasta, before it was time to order a 2nd bottle of wine, I asked our server to ask you to come over so that we may pick a wine together.  When after more than 10 minutes passed, and still you didn't come to my table, I then selected a wine on my own (I am a big boy, but the table was looking forward to your personal visit since it was requested). By the time the 2nd bottle arrived, we were well into our mains, and so the timing was not the best.\\n\\nI mentioned in my review that all four of the diners had previously dined at your restaurant.  And so, we were all familiar with the previous high quality of food and service.  Regrettably, all four of us were unified in seeing and experiencing a low level of service that we did not expect.\\n\\nI am willing to permit that this was an atypical evening for you.  Again, regrettably, my guests and I received much less than the expected level of service, to which we received in the past."},{"name":"La Grotta Ristorante Italiano","address":"2637 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow.

We also shared the cast iron frittata with kimchee and the Korean fried chicken.

The strength is in the variety of dishes to order and try so you can accommodate different tastes and palates.

It starts out with a  1/2 lb. burger, which is simple enough, but then it's topped off with a pile of thinly sliced maple ham and the toppings of your choice, which makes the end result a fusion of a cordon blue with an enormous cheeseburger under it. You're likely to feel like you just got shot with a tranquilizer dart after putting down even half of one of these, which is something I say with every bit of positive endorsement I can muster.

Although I didn't get a smoothie, since I came in with my taste buds prepped for ice cream, I thought the names and flavor options available were creative and good ideas.  There was one that combines strawberries with lemon sorbet and sparkling water for the more traditional and one called the Green Monster that involved avocado for the more adventurous.\\n\\nThe topping options available are fairly varied with fruits, real vegan chocolate sprinkles, and even gelatin-free gummy bears!

If I had these at home, I'd be tempted to put whipped cream on them. My server, Brian, was pleasant, informative and attentive to me and the others he served nearby. The one other ding for this meal, besides the omelette not being hot, was that the price of the Magnolia omelette was listed at $9, but when I got the bill it was $12.

Perhaps the restaurant has changed, but I don't see that happening unless the owners have as well.\\n\\nNestled in a small back alley off of Park Avenue in Winter Park, \\"The Bistro\\" is utterly delightful in appearance. It is impeccably clean, with an absolutely gorgeous atrium that is beautifully gilded by the Florida sun in the mid-afternoon. I went here on a whim for lunch while walking down Park Avenue. I thought, \\"well, with accommodations this well kept and inviting, certainly the food will have the same attention to detail.\\" That's the thought that sent me down this particular rabbit hole, and unfortunately it couldn't have been more off base. \\n\\nWhen I entered the restaurant, the host was dismissive, and seemed reluctant to seat a single diner, despite there only being four covers at the time. The behavior was simply odd. I shrugged, turned to leave, but was stopped and informed that I could, in fact, have a table.\\n\\nThe server was rather flat in demeanor. She wasn't cold, or rude, but rather it was as if she wasn't present. There were apparently no specials, or she neglected to mention them. I ordered a water, as there was no wine list on the table (I don't even know if they serve alcohol), and it came back promptly. I asked the server to have a minute to review the menu. She came back in ten.\\n\\n I decided to do my usual when first trying a restaurant: one starter, one entree, one dessert. I went for the crab cake starter, only to be told that they were out of it. Perhaps the crab was very popular, exhausting their supply, but this was only 30 minutes into lunch service. As none of the other options looked appealing, so I decided to move onto the entree. I ordered the √©touff√©e, only to be told again that they were out of it. I was confounded, and it immediately let me know that at the very least the √©touff√©e wasn't being prepared freshly. Now, by that I don't necessarily mean \\"made to order.\\" A lot of dishes necessitate preparation well ahead of service. That said, I repeat myself: this was only 30 minutes into lunch service. Either the cooks forgot to prepare the √©touff√©e, or they make it days in advance and had run out. Who knows? Either way, it's inexcusable, considering that √©touff√©e takes only 20 minutes to prepare from raw. I noticed that the dish has since been removed from the menu.\\n\\nSo, defeated on two fronts, I asked about the Shrimp and Andouille Jambalaya, one of my favorite Louisiana classics. Score! They could make it. The wait for the food was roughly 15 or 20 minutes, and I didn't have a starter to tide me over (I'll bear part of the burden there for not ordering a different starter), nor was there any complementary bread. I emptied my water glass during the wait, and didn't see the server again until my entree arrived.\\n\\nUnfortunately, what came out barely resembled Jambalaya. I knew there was going to be tomato (despite the word \\"Cajun\\", instead of \\"Creole\\", floating about), as the menu declared it, but...god damn. First thing: Jambalaya is supposed to be dry, sort of like paella. This was more like tomato gravy and rice, that old staple of poor southern folks, and a very poor quality one at that. All I could taste was tomato, and an infinitesimal bit of bell pepper. Hunting for the Cajun spices was like looking for wildflowers in a wasteland. The robust, spicy balance of flavors that makes Cajun cooking so dear to so many was completely absent here, except in the sausage, of which there were only 3 thinly sliced pieces hiding among the rice. The four colossal shrimp would surely have been amazing, but they were severely overcooked, resembling rubber more than a once living sea creature.  I resolved that I could make it through my tomato and rice (it was at least salted), but the shrimp would have to go. After notifying the server, I was informed that I could purchase more shrimp as a side dish if I didn't like the first set. That's right: purchase. I was stunned. \\n\\nI finished what I wanted of the entree, and my server rapidly returned with the check. I had heard her offer dessert to other tables, but she did no such thing for me. No \\"will that be all?\\" No apologies for the bad entree. Just the check without a word. It's one of the rudest things a server can do in my book.

I have my answer.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, I would find no better protection in Revolution than a gambling addict would find at Harrah's.\\n\\nClosing time is the worst time to visit a bakery, because everything was likely made hours earlier. Or, it's the best time, because they'll throw in a bunch of free shit if you ask. It hadn't occurred to me that Revolution would close so early (mid-afternoon), so I was surprised to find the place on the verge of shutting down for the day, with cases still filled with much of the standard fare of the recent doughnut renaissance. With a typical business day being only slightly longer than the Anglo-Zanzibar War, this must be one of the shortest revolutions in history.\\nAs for their treats, there were those bedazzled with bits of bacon, or with sliced strawberries strewn amongst their innards. Nutella. Salted caramel. \\nYep, all the typical uninspired doughnuttery that makes the bougie boys jizz their skinny jeans.\\n\\nOnly one really stood out for me - The Dough-Nut, a thick, dense cake of almond flour and dreams. \\n\\"If you told me you were drowning, I would not lend a hand.\\"\\nThat's pretty cold, Phil Collins, but if you want to get the job done quickly, then just toss this low-gluten, chocolate-iced death preserver to her and watch her sink to the bottom faster than you can say \\"Su-Su-Sussudio.\\"\\nIt's the stand-out item for this Doughnut Revolution, and I was given at least 2, despite paying for one. To be honest, I might have blacked out halfway through the first.\\n\\nI was assured that, despite it being closing time, many of the remaining doughnuts were actually made just a few hours earlier, around noon, which might explain the abundance remaining.\\nOther choices rank up there with most items from Sublime. They're doughnuts, so you'll never hear me say that they're bad. I'm not even sure it's possible for a doughnut shop to get 3 stars or fewer, unless it's Dunkin (but even DD might get 3 stars from me). But there are better doughnuts - FAR better doughnuts - to be had in this world.\\nUnfortunately, perhaps not around Atlanta, in my experience. As with Sublime and its ilk, there is an emphasis on toppings. I'd imagine that the experience of eating a Revolution doughnut without its toppings would be like the first time you saw those photos of adult film stars without make-up.\\n\\nMy greatest disappointment was realizing as I sampled their doughnuts that I wouldn't be able to include \\"Vive la Revolution!\\" in my review.\\n\\n\\nOverall, 7/10."},{"name":"Level Up","address":"7800 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"Yeah i love natural juices and am so happy we have lots of options.

It sure is full of wood paneling and dark lighting!  \\n\\nMatch is a place I probably wouldn't have gone on my own, as evidenced by the fact that it's been open for like five years and I never went here.  It's definitely cool looking on the inside, and has a pretty romantic vibe, but I wasn't around when it was really busy, so I can't say for sure that it's actually a good date location.\\n\\nPositives for this place: the burgers are actually pretty good!  I didn't really expect them to be, but I was very much mistaken.  They were juicy and the tiny buns were toasted just right.  Surprising!  The waitstaff was attentive and efficient (although our party was also like the only one in the restaurant at the time), and the atmosphere again is pretty cool.  IF I were a secret agent attempting to seduce an agent from a foreign nation, I would take them to Match.\\n\\nNegatives for this place: as indicated in the name, Match is about cocktails, and I'm not really a cocktail sort of fellow.  I don't know that I can rightly dock them anything for this, it's not like they were deficient in any way, but they don't have a lot of beer options.  Hoegarden isn't terrible, but I dislike having to drink it because I have no other options.\\n\\nAlso, the burgers are SERIOUSLY small.  Again, this isn't false advertising - it's how they are marketed.  But I needed about three of them to feel like I'd had anything to eat at all, and even then I got more food when I got home.  \\n\\nIf you go there between 5-6pm, you can get mini-burgers for $1.  That's a great deal.  If you don't, then you have to pay something like $4 or $5, and for my hunger, that would not have been a reasonable price.

(MAKE SURE TO COME EARLY ON WEEKENDS) We got seated right away and were greeted by personable hosts who informed us about how their restaurant worked. (Everything is family style, comes out one plate at a time) \\n\\nRadicchio salad: 8/10 I LOVED IT. Don't get me wrong. The pork belly bites inside were very well cooked and gave it more of a fatty flavor. However, I felt like it was a little oversauced. The dressing overtook the flavor of the leafy greens which in my opinion was just a little much. \\n\\nPotato's Brava: 8/10 Also really good but you definitely need to spread that white sauce over the potatoes to give you that extra flavorful taste. Without it, tasted somewhat bland but made sense once we spread the sauce throughout the dish. The potato's were perfectly crisp on the outside yet still soft on the inside. \\n\\nProvolone pork sausage: Nothing really stood out but it certainly wasn't bad. Tasted like a regular sausage. 5/10\\n\\nFrench toast: The syrup and whipped cream(?) on top of the French toast mixed together was a nice touch.

And we're so glad we did!\\n\\nWe believe in doing our research, and planned our restaurant selection accordingly - we were here on a weekday right at 11:15am (15 min before opening), and we were the second party in a line that grew pretty quickly after us.  It is a bit non-descript before they open, we weren't the only ones to do the walk-by, double-take, walk-back while we were searching for it.  Tip:  look for the name on the awning, since the storefront glass is all covered up by what looks like bullet-proof armour which stays up until they open the doors at 11:30am.\\n\\nAnyway, the food was just delicious - we started with a selection of oysters and clams from the raw bar, and can totally understand why several other diners looked like that's all they had - they were the freshest we've had anywhere to date.  Next, three of us had to try the Lobster Rolls, of course (hot with butter) - they were wonderful.  I can understand why some people aren't overwhelmed by them - they really are just lobster meat drenched in butter stuffed into top-cut hot dog buns, but boy, when you put that much perfectly-steamed lobster, slather it in butter till it takes on both the flavour and colour of the lobster, and then let it soak into the barely dense-enough to hold together bun, it is heaven!\\n\\nAnother reviewer complained about the fries only being meh, so I wasn't expecting anything great that way, but man, those were perfectly fried and salted (I know there're about as many opinions on what makes a perfect fry as there are people who eat them, but I challenge anyone to say they weren't good).\\n\\nAs for the service, I found it on par with our other Boston experiences.  In one phrase:  no-nonsense.  Pleasant enough, but you can tell they care more about keeping the line moving than making you feel welcome (warm and fuzzy is not on the menu).

Beer list is not too shabby either.  It is fun to gather for a drink at the Sound Table.  About 20 original cocktails are divided up thoughtfully into small thematic groups--a helpful feature giving you a rough idea what kind of taste to expect.  Ingredients and spirits used are many and of good quality.  While most cocktails are of the innovative sort, some classics like Sazerac can also be found made very well here.  Wine list is unusually energetic for its size, run your finger down the list, instead of the formulaic Char, Sauvy Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, etc. etc, it goes Gewurtz, Chablis, Chenin Blanc, Gruner Vetliner, Sancerre, etc. same thing with the reds.  Fun for trying new things.  Markup is respectably low.  There is even teasingly a junmai ginjo on the menu.  It's just overall very impressive in the drinking department here.     \\n\\nAn international street food themed selection of tapas is offered.  While the quality is not trip-worthy, they are varied and mostly good to eat.  In that, it's kind of unsurprisingly like TopFlr.  Cool to see stuffs like pho, corn on cob, oaxacan hanger steak, arancini, steam buns, and ceviche all presented on one menu.  I tried about 5 dishes overall and no complaint.  But the drinks are the stars here.  I think street foods like these are still better when vendors specialize in just a few items at a time.  \\n\\nAgain like TopFlr, the downstairs area features mostly house DJ music.  I haven't really spent much time downstairs, but it's a good feature.

When it comes time for relaxing in an outdoors environment with some friends wanting to enjoy some beverages and conversation, you are on my list to share with others who are clueless as I once was. \\n\\nTo Sarah our waitress, how I hope you are working next time I go in. Your service was top notch!!! I was the first out of the group to show up,  and was one of the last to leave some hours later and during this time, as a table of 1 grew to several tables of nearly 20 Yelpers you always made sure to bring a huge glass of water as someone showed up, and were very prompt with taking drink & food orders.  And on top of that, I'm pretty sure you became quick friends w/the 4 legged friends (dogs) at our table, because I happen to notice upon their arrival, there was a good sized water bowl for the pups to enjoy that you and some of your coworkers brought out to them. This sets a good impression in the back of my mind for whenever I get a dog, I know they will be more than welcome here at Cuatros.  And here's the earning of the 5th Star... split checks.  I've been to a number of places, both for food or drinks, that they will absolutely not split the check no matter the size of your party. Here at Cuatros with a party of nearly 20...i say again a party of nearly 20, the split checks came at ease and w/no complaint.  Having alot of friends that are in the service industry, I've heard war stories of having to split checks for large groups, so with that in mind, I have madd respect for Sarah.

Let's call her \\"J\\" for the sake of this food review. It was a Sunday evening and Barcelona deserves credit for the points I scored with J on the live music. They sat us down at a nice table of four, just for the two of us. The kind of table where you can almost sit side by side, with enough space to sit comfortably and little room for the occasional touch. J was getting more interesting by the minute, so I might have been distracted, ahem intimidated, but I didn't hear what specials and appetizers they offered. The look in J's eyes when she heard about the appetizer made me agree to order one. Delicious mushrooms, that's what they were. With lots of garlic and magic. Yes, because the rest of the night was smooth and relaxed. Just the right amount of service to continue great conversation; the perfect ambiance for finding interesting people and things to talk about. After we enjoyed the meal, we got lost on a walk in the beautiful German Village. The garlicky mushrooms did not bother anyone for the rest of the evening, if you wanna know, and I think I'm getting thirds, if you wanna know too.

I highly recommend this as a once-off selection to say you've done it, but I'm not sure the novelty of the size is worth a repeat as it was an otherwise typical tasting burger (mine got well-doned rather than medium-rare). \\n\\n3-stars for the ridiculously long wait (1+ hours) just to be seated and equally long wait to be served.

We went around 7 PM on a very very cold and rainy Sunday, and we were happily surprised that as soon as we walked in there were a few seats at the bar and at a table available.\\n\\nWhat made this a five-star experience was the service. I felt like the server truly wanted to make sure we had a great time, and when I told him about my allergy, he patted my shoulder and assured me that he would take care of it personally. We asked for recommendations on everything, and he was not afraid to speak up about his personal faves and suggestions. So on his word, we had a few glasses of white wine and started off with the smoked tuna johnnycake. Wow. It tasted a bit like a fancy bagel with lox, but it was so much more complex than that - the salty fish with the sweetness of the cake was a great combination. I could eat it for days!\\n\\nFor entrees, Pete had a dozen oysters, all on the recommendation of our amazing server (I wish I had gotten his name! He is such a nice person!!), and I had to get the lobster roll, just to find out what everyone has been raving out. When it came out, it became immediately apparent. The amount of lobster is impressive, all drenched in clarified butter to the point that I had difficulty picking up the roll it came on. I didn't think it was possible for fries to be refreshing, but next to that pile of what probably amounted to several sticks of butter, they were. I'm honestly still not a fan of lobster in itself, but this has got to be the best lobster dish I've ever had.\\n\\nMy only recommendation would be to serve dessert!!

I never would've guessed it wasn't actually dairy if it weren't for the reviews I read beforehand.\\n\\nAnd the flavors! Go to town sampling them before you order. The girl working behind the counter when I was there was incredibly nice and incredibly patient while I tried Cake Batter, Reverse Cookies and Cream, Salted Caramel, Peanut Butter, and Thai Chili Peanut, and then debated for a considerable time after that. All flavors sampled were as creamy and delicious as any dairy-based hard serve. Only complaint I had about some of them was the actual flavor being a tad too subtle- i.e. the peanut butter ice cream wasn't all that peanut buttery. But most of them were simply superb.\\n\\nOnce you've finished sampling, get a sundae.

The only disappointment was their most popular dish - the filet mignon.  I ordered medium rare and it was delivered medium well.  Little to no pink at all instead of a warm, red center.

Thought maybe the cook was having a bad night. So after a year we decided to give this place a second chance, especially after reading several positive reviews. We usually cook but some nights after a long days work, who wants to cook right? We got the crab puffs, chicken pad thai, and the basil fried rice with shrimp. First of all, the prices on their site are not accurate. The pad thai and fried rice ended up being $1.55 more. The food was nice and hot when we got home (we don't live very far) and prepared quickly, 15 mins. Crab puffs were good, no complaints. The pad thai on the other hand was on the sweet side, needed more salt/fish sauce honestly. I actually made my own fish sauce and stirred it in, made it taste so much better! The chicken was also very dry. I have high standards for pad thai and often compare it to my favorite place Baan Thai, which is on the other side of the river. The fried rice was decent, rice was a little bit on the wetter side, shrimp wasn't undercooked or overcooked which was nice. Again, could've had more flavor. Not sure if worth $12.50 though. Large portion of pad thai however fried rice was much smaller. \\n\\nWe eat and cook a lot of Thai/Laos/Cambodian/Hmong food so we have high expectations when it comes to Asian cooking.

Clam chowder is different from other place, it was not as creamy as the classic New England clam chowder. The soup doesn't have too much potato, making it less filling. This is also what you want from an appetizer. It tastes very good. Scallops were huge, and they were served over water crest salad with sweet corn and beacon mixed in. Lobster roll is offered in both cold and hot. We chose hot. The lobster was very juicy and fresh. They put at least a lot of lobster in the roll. The roll here is way better than Luke's lobster. \\n\\nPrice wise, it was decent. Entree is about $30 per person. The waitress at the bar was very nice. She constantly refilled the glass water.

So we rush on choosing another dish and he left us again with that uncomfortable feeling but at least -we thought- we were going to have a really good dinner.. Wrong!!\\nThe pasta with beef that he rave about felt  under cooked. The 8 year old beef that he promise to be to die for was terrible. It was so chewy that it literally left me jaw hurting after a long time. The fish was ok. Don't get me wrong the flavor of the food overall was not bad but what does it matter if you have to struggle to chew and swallow the main ingredient of a dish??\\nAfter a long time I was able to get our waiter's attention (he brought the food and disappeared which is an accomplishment in such tiny space) I pointed out that the meat was really chewy and he answer back \\"but did you enjoyed it\\"??\\nFinally he goes away and comes back to tell us they were going to bring a little something to compensate for the meat which we accepted reluctantly because we really just wanted to pay and leave.

I ordered the tourist bundle - clam chowder + lobster roll which came out to a whopping $50 or so with tip and tax. It's not a cheap place, but I also do think that you can split that meal for two if you're not that hungry. They give fairly generous portions of both the soup and the roll.\\n\\nThe roll itself was flawless - the bread was TOP NOTCH. The lobster tasted fresh and seasoned well. The fries (they give a ton with the roll) were good as well! The clam chowder was actually the star of my meal in my opinion.

Yes, students get free sodas.\\nThe 29th street location is not as well managed as the location off Rte. 36 near Superior, however.\\nYes, NO LONGER owned by McDonalds, which probably means they care too much about quality and the environment and not enough about \\"the bottom line\\" for McD's to keep them.\\nAbout Chipotle vs. Illegal Pete's, I could not agree more with some others that IP's is just so bland; it's almost like eating canned ingredients vs. fresh! Illegal Petes needs to step up and get better ingredients and better spices, not to mention make their locations less dingy.\\nAs for nutritional value, I think Chipotle is really quite healthy (and no contest at all compared to fast food super-size sodas, fries, etc.). If you are someone who doesn't get much exercise, just ask for less rice and get water instead of soda (it's those simple carbs that will lead you towards diabetes)."},{"name":"All Star Pizza Bar","address":"204 Cambridge St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I love their pizza!

They did add a 20% tip which I thought was a lot for a buffet.  To previous poster, they did have waffles.  The Mac N Cheese is really good.  Thumbs down for having so many good bakery items but no dessert at all on the buffet, I guess they have to have something more to offer you.

It's not the ladies, or the atmosphere... OK yeah it helps, but it's not ALL about that.  To be honest I forget that they're there half the time.  It's the location and the deals.  Every Tuesday they have unlimited wings for 11 bucks.  Yeah.  11.  It was awesome.  I ended up getting 3 plates of wings, all with the 911 sauce, and shared some fries.  And Wednesday's they have boneless wings and fries for something like $8.\\n\\nThe waitresses have always been attentive here, and the location (for me, anyway... it's down the street about 5 minutes) is great.  No longer must I drive 25 minutes to Buff's Pub and find street parking (note: I still do this anyway because their wings are just so good).\\n\\nDownsides?  Well it is a bit expensive, to be honest.  If you don't go on Tuesdays for unlimited wings, or Wednesdays for \\"Wings Day,\\" then you're looking at like $12 bucks for some wings and fries.  It's just too much money when you can go to a place like Buff's and get wings that are twice as good for a bit less.\\n\\nLastly, the chicken just isn't THAT good.  People rave about Hooters' wings, but I just don't see it.  Yeah, it's good, but it's not REALLY good.

In fact, the roll was too wet and the rice was too vinegary. Hmm, I've never thought that about sushi rice before. We ended the meal with tuna pops from the tapas menu, which was grilled albacore tuna skewers. It was decent. \\n\\nI'd say the $7 tapas menu is the way to go.

It blew my mind how busy this place is and it makes sense why one has to pay before sitting. Water is available at a self-serve tap.

They are served with a fantastic dipping sauce thats nice and garlicky and a traditional one made with ketchup and mayonnaise thats very tasty. \\n\\nMy entree was the grilled shrimp dish. It was extremely flavorful and tasty. \\n\\nThe second time I of course had the chip appetizer again which measured up on a second try. This time I ordered the Cuban sandwich because I've heard its the best in Austin from a Cuban sandwich connosieur. I had never tried a Cuban before and I assure you I was not disappointed in the slightest. The pulled pork was perfectly seasoned and perfectly complimented by the thin ham slices. \\n\\nI also was persuaded to try a traditional drink from Puerto Rico that tasted very different but went nicely with the meal. I love that the owners have put so much thought into their menu that even the beverages are authentic. \\n\\nI also would be remiss not to rave about the cheese flan. I believe when I get to heaven this cheese flan will be a major food group. Its that good. Its unlike anything I have ever eaten. The best way I could describe it is American cheesecake plus Mexican flan. The texture and flavor are awesome.  It is much more than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nAll in all this is a restaurant I love to frequent and I plan on going back many times.

The best part is that you can make reservations which is great if you go a Friday or Saturday night! \\n\\nMy friends and I recently went during the snow storm for dinner recently. We love this place although we had a TERRIBLE waitress, her name was Paula. We had an early reservation for six and ordered drinks, a bottle of wine, appetizers and entrees. She asked us to confirm our drink order at least 4 times and didn't write anything down.  She was somewhat friendly and did her job at a minimum our dinner was cleared we all had drinks left. She brought us our check not asking if we wanted anything else. The worst part was after sitting there finishing our drinks she asked us if we were leaving soon because there was another party waiting for our table. We were there ordered, ate and drank in about 45 minutes and now your kicking us out? I'm sorry I was never a stellar waitress but if you have a large party and they are ordering everything off the menu I don't think you ask them to leave especially if you want a 20% tip or higher. \\n\\nThis is a great restaurant and this waitress was a poor representation of this place.

I mean, it was busy and all, but there is a minimal amount a server should do, like ask if you want a drink especially if it's over 100 degrees outside. Ask if you want fries or salad. You know...\\n\\nAnyway, the food was pretty delicious. I ordered the $25 lobster roll (hot). It was good, but what isn't good drenched in butter? I do agree with the other reviewers that the taste of the hot roll far exceeds any of the mayo cold lobster rolls I've had all around the city. And I loved those mayo cold lobster rolls so that says quite alot. However, the butter drenching means heavy feeling. As I write this, I feel like my insides are coated with a layer of butter.\\n\\nAnother cool thing about this place is that you can order the oysters a la carte. They give you a oyster menu (think sushi menu at a Japanese joint), and you can write the number of each kind of oyster you would like. I loved the idea because I felt like the lobster roll would fill me up, but I still wanted to try the oysters since it is called Neptune Oysters. I got two different kinds of oysters, one from Washington and one from Maine, and they both tasted fresh and oysterlicious. \\n\\nAll in all, the food here is good but pricey.

Lately, I've been meeting friends or family for lunch.\\nThe service has always been good. I've never had to wait for a table because I always sit at a booth or table in the bar.\\nThe food, for the most part, has been pretty consistent. My go-to order is the combo lunch (soup and salad or salad and 1/2 club sandwich with fries). Always a good option. The chicken tenders are really good as well...hand-battered, not frozen. \\nI also like to order the house salad (comes with bacon and hardboiled egg) with bread, but the portions seem to get smaller and smaller each time I come in. Not sure what the deal is. The price hasn't changed, but the plate size has. Kind of annoying because it's not small enough to order something to go with it, and not large enough for it to pass as an entree. It's the same price as the combo lunch, so maybe I'll just stick to that ;-)\\nThey also have a rewards program (Restaurants Unlimited). It's good for partnering restaurants as well (i.e. Prime Rib + Chocolate Cake, Henry's Tavern, Portland City Grill, etc.). You earn credits for money spent, then redeem them for dining credits.

I have to give it two stars after the dinner we had.  Well we have eaten here before and it was really good.  There were no complaints about the food or service.  Anyway the family decided to go out to Blue Star once again.  It has been some time since we were here last, but we needed the change in venue and this was a good choice. (so we thought)  \\n\\nNow I do not remember it being very loud the last time we were there, but hey somethings vary and last night was very loud.  The atmosphere was pleasant just like it has always been and that was nice.  Our server (who shall remain nameless) was how should I describe her... Hmmm, less than enthusiastic about even being there I guess you would say.  She took our drink and appetizer order.  The trouble began when she returned with both.   Our appetizer was a shrimp cocktail.  Now let me begin by saying here that I have some experience in a professional kitchen.  I apprenticed under a Michellin Five star chef in my younger days.  With that being said... The shrimp cocktail comes out, in a fairly nice presentation until you get a good look at the shrimp.  These things have not been cleaned/de-veined at all.  Very gross people. Who wants to eat shrimp poo?  Not I.  Of course our non-caring server when told of the problem just took the appetizer away. No apologies, did not question whether or not we wanted another prepared correctly or anything.  (needs better customer service training).  \\nWhen she came back to take our dinner orders I was less than enthused about even eating.  None the less we all ordered.  My wife orders the chicken breast with whipped sweet potatoes and glazed carrots, My father in law and I both ordered the fried cod with mashed potatoes with mushroom gravy and green beans.  Oh yes, can't forget my baby girl Anna. We ordered her the childrens cheese pizza.  \\nNow this is where my second issue came in at.  We placed our orders, which by kitchen standards was fairly easy and quick, but we had to wait, and wait and wait.  I sat and watched  customers who had come in 15min after we ordered get their food before us.  This was not acceptable to me (now this may not bother some, but it annoys the hell out of me personally. )  So our food finally arrives, and now let me give you the overall evaluation. \\n\\nThe fried cod overall was nice.  I did have one spot on the fish where the crust was burnt and inedible, but on a whole it was pleasant.  The mashed potatoes (were without the mushroom gravy like we ordered) were not hot.  They were bland and lifeless. No seasoning to them whatsoever.  The sad thing is that they truly were mashed potatoes, they were crushed baked potatoes and crammed into a little dish.  The green beans were also cold and under done.  When one gets fresh green beans you expect a little snap in them, but not to the point where you have to saw them to eat them.  \\n\\nMy wifes dish was fairly good.  Her chicken was excellent, very tender and done just right.  You could cut that chicken breast with your fork alone.  The only issue with her plate was the \\"whipped\\" sweet potatoes.  Which weren't really whipped, but more like cooked sweet potatoes that were placed into a pot and an immersion blender half-heartedly attacked.  They too were underseasoned.  \\n\\nMy little girls childs cheese pizza was pretty good.  No complaints from that department! \\n\\nOver all my thoughts were this.  If the whole course of the dinner was as good as the main component of the dishes we had, Blue Star would have garnered a solid three stars from me.  Four, if the service was a bit more... well had more customer service skills.   The chicken and the fish were really excellent, but the supporting sides failed miserably which can really ruin ones overall taste for the dish altogether.  So all in all I give it a whole whopping two stars, and the thought that maybe this was an off night. So maybe, just \\"maybe\\" I might return here to try it again. \\n\\nSalut'"},{"name":"Classic Cafe","address":"1313 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3","text":"I live just up the street in Lexington and frequent the Classic Cafe for Breakfast.

For my sandwich, I choose the Carolina sweet.\\n\\nBBQ sandwiches tend to be staple to Sunbeam bread, so I'll excuse it. No need for overly fancy bread courtesy of Little Tart, H&F, or what have you. It's cool.\\nSadly, as far as meat goes, though, it barely and depressingly had no smoke flavor or barely a flavor at all. Drowning it in sauce gave it some flavor, but that's not what I wanted to do. Oh well. I ate it anyway, so it surely wasn't inedible.\\n\\nThe brisket was a tad bit better, but yeah, pork.... hm. Not sure what's up.\\n\\nAlso, two sauces!??? What's up with that? Haha. That's truly bizarre. I mean, sure, let's not go overboard and create a sauce monster but most of the fancy BBQ places around here are touting at least three. Maybe that's just how G.C. rolls. Keeping it fairly simple. Well, hopefully you'll like sweet and tangy (which is more sweet than tang) or peppery hot. I miss my backwoods vinegar sauces.\\n\\nOther cons--- People have mentioned it. Nothing really 'sit down at Krog' friendly. Perfect for 'go home and eat with a few people' though. No plates or combos with sides. This set up had been a deterrent on purchasing from G.C. for a while.\\n\\n--No ice for drinks.--- Some people hate ice. I, on the other hand, am an ice fiend. I love ice with drinks---especially sweet tea. Thanks, nonchalant dude who was all like \\"we have ice cold drinks, you don't need ice.\\" Let's not get too hasty there. -heartbreak- I still bought their tea though. Wasn't half bad but awkward to walk around with half a jug of tea in a crowded food court, but you get over it. Still though, no ice.... I'm not letting that one go. I'm sorry. I'm the jerk who will order extra ice at the sacrifice of drink space. It's probably a sensory thing.\\n\\n--Sides: Once again, large non-one person friendly sorts. Collards just plain out sucked. I'm sorry. I just can't even be nice about it. They were the worst collards I've ever had. I still have them, and it has been forever since I ate here... Plus they were kinda expensive.\\n\\n--Lastly, staff- You guys seem busy, so maybe that's why you're so cold. But... why you gotta be so cold? Why not be chipper and customer friendly while you're chopping up those smokey rumps?\\n\\nLet's talk Pros?\\n\\nG.C., you have the cutest restaurant shirts I've ever seen in regards to a BBQ spot. You win this. This is a solid A. I half want to buy one despite my opinions.\\n\\nFast - Really fast. The food comes out quickly, so not much of a problem there. Everything is fairly pre-packaged and freshly prepped. You can watch them prep the sandwiches, etc. -- The wait is in hoping you didn't come on a busy day and can find seating with your half gallon of tea.\\n\\nAesthetic - Woodsy, clear cut, dare I say, authoritative? The layout is quite nice. So kudos.\\n\\nHopefully, all I mentioned were just crappy kinks in the chain and after a few more months all of this will require an update review, but til then, I dunno.

She was AWESOME. We came in for dinner around 8 pm and it was pretty busy so we waited about 10 minutes for a booth. Earls is pretty standard in terms of food and drink so I want to note the things about our server that really stood out to me and made this experience worth writing about.\\n\\nOnce we were seated, she brought us our menus and she actually noticed before I did that there were crumbs left on the table from the last person and she came back with a towel to clean it off without being asked to. Not just at Earls  but other restos I've been to especially the big busy chains (joeys, cactus, etc.) I've seen leftovers on the seats and on the table and usually I just take a napkin and wipe it myself. I was extremely impressed that she paid attention and did something about it. \\n\\nMy friend ordered a bottle of red for us, and when Sidney came back out to let us know that they were actually sold out of it she didn't just come back empty handed. She brought out a different bottle that was \\"comparable\\" in terms of price and let us try it. She suggested something instead of just coming out and delivering bad news. I didn't particularly enjoy this wine so we ended up choosing something different but nonetheless I appreciated her effort. \\n\\nWe ordered a tuna tocata or something to share as an appy and then we went with the tuna melt grilled sandwich. She brought out our food piping hot which tells me she was paying attention to when our food was ready for presentation (I've had medium warm things before at this location like the Asian rice bowl). She checked up on us without being rude or interrupting and she asked us about the bill before she left us to our conversation. \\n\\nI find that these big chain restaurants sometimes forget that just because they are big and busy, that they don't need to pay attention to quality and service but Sidney was a complete standout.

They do a great job labeling all your tacos, so no fear if you order tons of them. A friend ordered a dozen for Sunday brunch, so I got to try a potato and egg as well as a chorizo and egg. The potato and egg is filled crisp homefry type potatoes, with a slightly chewy tortilla - vegetarians can rejoice over that. Chorizo and egg is massively greasy though. Normally I don't mind that for chorizo, but it'll send you to naptime at 9AM with the amount of red grease flowing and soaked up by the tortilla. Flavor is fine but not what you'd want for breakfast on a normal day because of the heaviness. Each taco is pretty cheap though, so it's got affordability going for it.\\n\\nIf you're a college student nearby, its a great place to grab something quick, so I'm sure Taco Ranch will be a success, especially for the price but not something I would necessarily go out of the way for."},{"name":"The Mighty Bowl","address":"108 W 8th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"WOW.

I didn't try the OG platter, but my dining companions devoured most it and liked it very much. As for the fried chicken and waffles, the waffles were delicious, and the fried chicken had good flavor, but was a bit dry. I mostly ate the veggie omelet which came with roasted potatoes and a side salad.

I came with my girlfriend and sat at the bar to get drinks and apps. The decor was timeless, with hanging chandeliers and tufted seats at the bar. It felt rich, but we could immediately tell it was going to be overpriced, which we were willing to accept IF the food and drinks were good. \\n\\nThe drinks were decent, at $15 each. I got the cucumber collins with basil and it tasted light, refreshing, and masked all the alcohol in it. Do I think it was worth $15? Probably not, but we knew what we were getting into.\\n\\nThe biggest problem was the food. $18 (plus more for tip and tax) for the lobster pizza, which sounded amazing in its description. My friend and I have been making inside jokes all day today about how bad that pizza was. It tasted like cardboard with grass on it (there was very little lobster and sauce on it) and had some kind of sprouts on it. It was absolutely horrible, dry and burnt. I honestly think Celeste pizza would have satisfied us more. Truly horrendous, we started dipping it in the sauce that came with the lamb meatballs we got. Yes we could have sent it back or complained, but this isn't trial and error and didn't want it to ruin our night. The lamb meatballs were meh, but really, how do you make pizza THAT bad????

Nelson Mandela had died that day, so we chatted about that. Once we sat down our server mentioned she'd noted we needed to leave by a certain time to make our play and helped us plan our meal accordingly. The kitchen was elegant and quiet.\\n\\nSo that's that. Now let's talk food.\\n\\nPro tip: stick with the small plates. We made the mistake of ordering seared tuna for an entree and it was just seared tuna. Nothing special, nothing interesting, and the quality of fish wasn't even that good. I make a seared tuna pasta in a turmeric and sage sauce that blows it out of the water. I think they were just playing it safe, which is fine if you're Applebees. But it's disappointing if you're considered one of the best restaurants in a region.\\n\\nThe small plates were excellent. It's been two months and I can still remember them vividly. Not necessarily what was in them, but how they made you feel. Light, fresh, balanced, they made you feel clean and they kept us entertained (the difference between gourmet and quotidian is the latter just feeds you). \\n\\nOne of them was borderline spiritual: smoked oysters. Dios mio. There were three -¬†we each had one, and then we nearly brawled for the third. I won out by trading most of a pear and rutabaga something or other blah blah blah who cares what it was. The smoked oysters were all the delight of a briny wellfleet or kumamoto, all the richness of lamb soup, all the nostalgia of summer dusks, all at once. They were firm, juicy, and the flavor lingered like truffles. Order these.\\n\\nSpeaking of truffles: they had a hand rolled pasta with white truffles. The truffle itself was delicious and blended well with the included greens. However, the hand rolled pasta was far too strong for the truffle, drowning it out whenever they came into competition.\\n\\nThe other small plates were fine, but the interludes were the best part. I remember a bright, fruity sorbet especially. I believe my partner thought it among the best things we tasted that night -¬†even as an interlude it overshadowed our dessert, which was good for its own sake.\\n\\nConclusion: Bondir is an asset to the community, but I'm not sure it justifies the difficulty in getting a reservation, or all the hype. It occurs to me that Bondir should be positioned more at the level of Oleana - interesting and delicious, but not breathtaking. The meal would have tasted better if we'd heard it ranked with Oleana, Sportello and Bergamot instead of Menton and Momofuku.\\n\\nBesides those oysters and sorbet, the whole meal was underwhelming.\\n\\nOur server did get us out on time, and the play we saw, Mies Julie, was poignant as a snapshot of South Africa on the day their great leader passed on."},{"name":"Lamplighter Brewing","address":"284 Broadway","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"No eye contact, no smile, no l'll be with you soon .

No mustard spread and no tomatoes.  \\nOut it comes. Egg souffl√© frankly looked and tasted like fake pre-made egg substance from Burger King. No mustard spread and no tomato but a full serving of arugula lettuce. \\nSo, I'd come back for baked goods and coffee but I'd go to McDonald's for a egg McMuffin -- just as good, recognizable egg and about 1/5th the cost."},{"name":"Mio Sushi","address":"1255 NW 185th Ave","city":"Aloha","stars":"4","text":"Unexpectedly came here one Friday night when my boyfriend and I decided we wanted sushi for dinner, and we just happened to be in the area. I've seen Mio Sushi in several locations and figured it was a chain, so I wasn't sure what to expect. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, the service is AMAZING. There were several things on the menu, and being first-timers we weren't sure what to try...we both absolutely love sushi and wanted to try everything! We asked one of the waitresses what she would recommend and what were their most popular rolls/dishes and she pointed out SEVERAL things on the menu that would've satisfied what we were specifically craving for. For example, she suggested the \\"mountain rolls\\" (they're called Mt. Rainer, Hood, etc.) if we wanted something baked. She also had a few other suggestions from their deep fried options and just seemed to know the menu really well as a whole. All the waitresses made sure we always had water, and came in to check on us from time to time.\\n\\nPrices are reasonable for the quality of the food. I didn't think they were too expensive or super cheap, but just right. \\n\\nFrom the appetizers, we ordered the Agedashi Tofu, Shrimp Shumai, and Baked Mussels. All three were pretty good, but the tofu was firmer than usual. The cream that the mussels came with was a little bit too overpowering for me, but it was still pretty good. \\n\\nWe ended up getting the Mt. Rainer sushi roll, which had baked salmon on top, some sauces, and a drop of Sriracha. However, the inside of the sushi roll was nothing too special. It had the usual cucumber, krab (imitation crab), etc. If you like creamy sauces then this would be a good one to try. \\n\\nWhat I really liked about their menu style was the fact that they had suggested drinks for certain plates. On the bottom of some appetizer descriptions were sake or beer suggestions, and I thought that was pretty neat. It takes eating and drinking to a different level, especially since certain sakes and beers are really good paired up with certain foods. Before this place, I hadn't seen that on any other sushi restaurant menus. \\n\\nOverall an enjoyable first time, but nothing too fancy or \\"out there\\". Their customer service deserves a round of applause, and I'll definitely be back to try more of their menu options!"},{"name":"Monica's Mercato","address":"130 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Visiting from Sunny So Cal for a college tour with my son.\\n\\nOrdered small Italian Sub with everything.

The snapper tasted fresh and the aioli sauce was really good.  My veggies were perfectly grilled and not dripping with butter.  I really liked their salsa, quite tasty.  The hostess noticed we were out of chips and salsa and brought us over a re-fill since our waiter was busy, nice service.  It looked like they had a really nice patio...it was a little too chilly to sit outside but I can imagine in the spring/summer it being a great place to hang out.

Not even up for debate, this is a fact.\\n\\nDon't be discourage by the waiting time if you're planning to go, I've never had an issue with that. However, I do tend to go during late lunch (after 1pm) or late dinner (around 8-8:30pm). The longest I've had to wait was less than 30 minutes for a dinner slot, and they took my number down so I could go walk around the area. The reason why there might be a wait is because this place is tinyyyy. Now if you're claustrophobic, it might not help lol. \\n\\nThe first time I came to Neptune was 3 years ago and ever since then, I've been searching and searching and searching for something even comparable to that... zero luck! Coming back here again, made me realize that there is nothing that can compare. It is THAT amazing times infinity!!! \\n\\nI ordered the shrimp cocktail which were large, and harpoon beer braised. UGH to die for! There was sweetness of the shrimp in every bite, and honestly it was so large it almost filled me up lol. Last time I was there I also got the fried oysters, which were delicious and fresh caught right there in Mass, also very sweet (our waiter even mentioned that was his favorite on the menu). For entrees, we got the lobster rolls and lobster spaghetti which was the special for monday. Check our their daily specials, those are some hidden gems too! Ok, so the spaghetti were divine. Chunks and chunks of lobsters meat in perfectly seasoned pasta and sauce. I don't know how you can get technical with spaghetti, but they did just that. This might rbe a sin to say, but I might like it AS MUCH as the lobster roll! Which obviously, leads me to my next point... lobster rolls!! no fillers, just imagine the freshest lobster meat cooked just right on a buttery toasted roll. Order it hot so when you take a bite out of it, you can taste every element of glory. You don't need any additional sauces, maybe some squeezes of lemon if you prefer it that way. But absolutely nothing else, it is more than perfect just the way it is! I don't know how they do it everytime, but I'm so glad I get to taste such an amazing dish."},{"name":"Barcelona","address":"263 E Whittier St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite places to go for a nice dinner with my wife.

I love barbecue and as someone who grew up in the South, I fancy myself to be something of a connoisseur. So when I moved to Davis and my co-workers (all FROM Boston) started telling me how good Redbones was, I was skeptical. No offense to Northerners, but the barbecue up here just is NOT the same. So, in a nutshell, I was right. I wasn't crazy about the barbecue here. They are trying to master too many types of barbecue... having Kansas City, Arkansas, Texas, and Carolina all on the same menu just can't work.\\n\\nOkay now for the bar. I love this bar. I would hang out at this bar any  night of the week. Great beer selection, chill bartenders. And the fried pickles rock my world (yes, I know pickles are food, but they are best had with beer... in the BAR). \\n\\nSo I do love Redbones for drinking and apps, just not for barbecue."},{"name":"Ichiza Kitchen & Tea House","address":"5411 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Interesting food!

The meat was perfectly cooked and the protein was such high quality than what was expected and it clocks in much cheaper than other entrees. If you do not have the money to ball hard here, get the burger because you will not regret it.\\n\\nSo in all i give Neptune 3/5. The reason being is that they pride themselves on their oysters and seafood so when the oysters (which is the main stay of their menu) are disappointing, it takes away from the experience. If they are charging top of the table prices, I expect top of the table seafood as well, but it unfortunately did not happen this night.The burger and lobster roll brought the score up and I will definitely get one or the other if I ever decide to come back!"},{"name":"Magnolia Cafe South","address":"1920 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Perfect steak .. everything seems to be made from scratch.

I've personally taken friends here whenever the subject comes up and they say they haven't been to Superchef's before. It's a little overwhelming when you first step in a good way... Comic book wallpaper, fluffy pancakes stacked high, and bold colored waffle sandwiches??! Slight problem, Superchefs is usually packed so you'll probably have to wait for a table. When the weathers nice I like to walk around outside and look at all the buildings downtown. I believe they have an app that you can check yourself into. \\n\\nEven their menu is a little overwhelming and it's a little hard deciding what you want when a lot of them sound so crazy. My favorites are the breakfast pizza (It's more of a flatbread but I like the crispness of it.) and the Juggernaut (red waffle sandwich). If you can't decide on their pancakes they have a sampler options so you can have a little of everything. If your dish doesn't have candied bacon, get a side of it it's sooo good. Make sure to take a picture of whatever you do get if you're into that, I've had many friends want to know where I went when I post pictures of Superchefs' crazy looking food. \\n\\nThe hot chocolate is pretty with its rainbow sprinkles, but it's clearly made with instant hot chocolate and water so give it a pass.

Waypoint, Eventide, Row 34, The Little Donkey , 5 Corners Kitchen ...CRUSH this place. It's not the 4 hour wait It's the food with salt literally dumped on every item! \\n\\nFirst of all- the temperature was so warm I'm unsure of how the oysters and raw bar were staying chilled over the melting ice. \\n\\nScallop crudo- I do believe I tasted salt crystals! This had no balance in flavor, no fresh day boat scallop taste melting in your mouth. My entire palate consisted of salt.  I actually had to send this back because I feared this would ruin the remainder of our meal. Disappointment \\n\\nOysters- $20 in oysters. To start off they were all luke warm and not chilled. The Kumamotos were actually salty and should have been sweet. The island creeks were smooth and fresh so besides the lack of chill factor I was ok with these. No special mignonette, no options of house made sauces. Simple and pricey. \\nDisappointment. \\n\\nThe tuna tartare- guess what flavors- salt. I was unable to taste the nice simple clean flavors of tuna which is why I order tartare - Disappointment. \\n\\nThe butter lobster roll was a great size and i was hoping the flavors would resemble the profile I had two years prior. Unfortunately I was out of luck here as well. The lobster was soft and not over cooked which was great. It was however fishy and again over salted. It was smothered with butter as well and the lobster was falling out from the bottom roll.  Disappointment.\\n\\nThe only good thing from my $100 meal that was not dissapointing was my oak aged Trillium beer for $13. Thanks for a clean tap line guys!\\n\\nOverall this was a terrible experience and the price for food just unacceptable in my eyes. I fine dine regularly and don't mind spending over a $100 when the food and service is on its game.

A bit surprised that we didn't like this as much as others but it would have been that we ordered it without bacon. Perhaps you need that fat to make this salad memorable. \\n\\n|| Fried Chicken: 4.5 stars. I loved the African spices on this chicken and LOVED the cumin spiced dipping sauce. I wish they would bottle that and sell it. Chicken was fried very well and was not fatty tasting at all. \\n\\n|| Steak sandwich: 5 stars. The star of the meal. For $10 you get a massive burger stuffed with grilled steak, charred onions and spicy aioli. Meat was cooked well and the sandwich was crazy tasty. \\n\\n|| Fries: 4 stars. Standard and fresh \\n\\nOverall this is probably one of the best happy hours I know for price and food quality. Bar seating is a hit or miss we were able to snag seats.

This is scam, hustle territory.  We live in the area and made the mistake of stopping in for a couple quick, simple egg/cheese biscuits to-go before a big day.  It wasn't the usual and hilarious \\"line around the block\\" kind of day, so we thought our chances were good to check this place out.  Literally everything was retarded.  \\n\\n- The line system here is hands down, by no stretch of the imagination, the dumbest setup I've ever seen at any restaurant.  Ever.  Anywhere.  I wish I could post a drawing of the layout of this place to deter people from even considering getting something to-go here.  If you're ordering to eat-in, it's not AS bad, but still silly as hell.  For to-go orders, the layout is literally designed from someone with a mind of logistical poverty.  After you order food you have no choice but to conveniently wait in a 4x4' area between a very popular assortment of ketchup/hot sauces (which the diners/staff frequent at least every 2 seconds or so) and the bus bins which are constantly being used by tactless, aforementioned tourists.  This area is 2 feet from the massive line that inevitably forms for food at the front door.  It's a mess.  You're basically constantly shuffling forward and back dodging staff and guests while crossing your fingers that the food is worth it (it's not, at all.  more on that).  There is a table next to the bus bins, completely out of the way of literally everyone, that could be removed for the courtesy of those waiting for to-go orders, but no... that would potentially affect profit and since this place is obviously a hustle, convenience/common sense are set aside.  \\n\\n- That wouldn't even be as big an issue if the food didn't take ridiculously long.  A line barely to the door and two egg/cheese biscuits takes 25 \\"what the fuck\\" minutes.  There was ONE COOK, yes, one cook, whipping out these overpriced hustle-biscuits for an entire dining room.  He had an entire griddle that was barely being used at the time, and two frying pans working overtime, that's it...  I normally wouldn't pay this much attention, but we had the time.  He had the ambition and work ethic of a dying sloth, but I don't really blame him.  He's not even kind of set up for success with that kitchen layout.  \\n\\n- When we finally got our food, I couldn't help but let out a fleeting rage while eating it.  The biscuits, the thing this place is suppose to be famous for, the thing that brings tubby travelers here in hoards, were the worst biscuits I've ever had.  Dry, flavorless, over-cooked and tasted frozen and reheated.  No buttery, flaky layering... nothing.  Laughable.  The eggs were eggs and the cheese was an almost offensively bland, mild cheddar.  Like, meek \\"I don't want to offend you\\" cheddar.  The biscuit itself, as well as the eggs and cheese was almost identically reminiscent of McDonald's.  It was strange, to say the least.  I guess people come here for gravy slathering, which likely drowns out the mediocrity of the biscuits.  If you want a delicious biscuit, go to the Tin Shed.  And they don't even have biscuit in their name.\\n\\nOverall, terrible.  Never going back, never recommending.  Another Portland hustle, fooling everyone."},{"name":"Lincoln Tavern and Restaurant","address":"425 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Go here ALL THE TIME.

So, not a good place if you're in a rush.\\n\\nThe pizza itself is tasty.  I'm a fan of the Everybody's Pizza, but I enjoyed it less in the individual serving size.

We took one look at it and said, \\"No, thank you!\\" But, since we were there, we decided to grab a nice dinner. We YELPED our options and in the end decided to go with Rosa Mexicano.\\n\\nWhen we walked in we were impressed with the look of the restaurant. Who can resist staring at the running water-wall complete with little divers? Plus it was clean, not overcrowded and smelled delicious. RM definitely made a pretty good first impression ...for the first five minutes at least. I can tell you that first impression soured soon enough.There was no host/hostess at the host station out front, which was okay at first. I get that sometimes the host/ess has to help out when the restaurant gets busy or they may have to run to the bathroom or whatever. But, my gripe comes in when you have potential patrons waiting for almost ten minutes without being acknowledged at all even though numerous waiters and waitresses passed us and saw us standing there. I wouldn't have minded if someone had just said, \\"someone will be right with you\\". My wife asked me a couple times whether we should leave but I kept saying, \\"okay, give them one more minute\\" because I was tired and really didn't want to have to go somewhere else. Finally someone seated us but, of course, there was no apology. I was quite annoyed but I was also hungry so we glanced at the menu and quickly ordered. \\n\\nWe went with the three course sharing menu which seemed to be the best bang for our buck. For $25, you get one appetizer to share, your choice of any taco or enchilada entree and a dessert to share. According to their menu, this special is only available for a limited time in celebration of their 30years in business (not at this location of course). \\n\\nSince everyone on Yelp raved about the guac and the waiter also said that it was their best seller, we ordered that. It was really cool watching it being prepared at our table and the guac itself was good but I wish it had more citrus (or any at all). But that was easily fixed when my wife squeezed in the lime off her margarita and then it was perfect. Speaking of margaritas, I ordered the mango chili which had a nice flavor but it was super spicy and way too hot for me so I switched with my wife who had a traditional margarita. \\n\\nFor entrees: I had the Costillas de Res - which was a trio of Dos XX braised short rib tacos which came with a side of Elote . The Elote was delicious, one of the best I've ever had and the tacos were also petty good. The tacos (and I could be wrong here) seemed to be a corn/flour blend because they were light and fluffy like flour tacos but had a bit of texture like corn, I really liked them. However, my side of rice was cold, had no flavor and didn't seem fresh while the beans were standard. My wife had a trio of different flavored enchiladas and she said they were okay. Our favorite item had to be the plantain bowl that we ordered at an additional cost. They come with a sweet cream sauce and were hot, sweet and overall AMAZING!  For dessert, we shared the churros which come with three dipping sauces: caramel (surprisingly our favorite even though none of us like caramel), chocolate and a fruity one that had a spicy kick. These were very good and put a nice cap on our dinner. \\n\\nI wish we didn't have the negative experience with the wait and lack of acknowledgment at the hostess because overall the food was good."},{"name":"Papa's Pizza Parlor","address":"15700 NW Blueridge Dr","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"OK, so I recently discovered the \\"Yelp App\\", I know, pretty late to the party on that one. Until recently I only used Yelp sometimes, and mostly wrote reviews for places that I was particularly inspired by. Now that I have the App and find it enjoyable to check-in to places, I have noticed the reviews of some of my favorite places. To my shock, I checked-in to Papa's last week and was stunned to see it rated at 2.5 stars. So I will give my own story and full honest review to help anyone considering this place to make an informed decision....\\n\\nI have been going to Papa's Pizza since I was a very young child. I grew up in Eugene only a mile or so away from one of their locations and this was one of my favorite places growing up. As I moved into the high school years, I had several friends who worked at Papa's so I continued to frequent the establishment even though I had outgrown the play area. It was in these late high school years that I really discovered the best taco pizza ever. Yes, this distinction belongs to Papa's in my opinion. There other pizza is good, not great, but the taco is absolutely on point and incredibly hard to beat. I have been living in the Portland Metro now for about 8 years and the Beaverton location has become a part of my young family's routine. \\n\\nSo here's a breakdown:\\n\\nPizza - Taco is awesome, Papa's combo is really good, and everything else is good but not great. Think Abby's if you need something to compare it to. It is better than your run-of-the-mill pizza delivery chain, but maybe not worth the premium price if you're just looking for a greasy pie delivered on a Friday night. I'm pretty sure I am out of their delivery area, but I probably would not have them delivered much even if I wasn't, as Papa's is more to me than just pizza. \\n\\nPlay area - My kids are 4.5 and 2.5, we've been coming here since the oldest was 1, they have both always loved it. When they were younger, we had to pay close attention to them and follow them around to make sure they didn't get run over by some of the older kids. Once the youngest turned 2, they both handle themselves; we don't have to pay very close attention to them. They come running to the table when they need refreshment, and we shove some pizza in their mouths as they run back to the play area. This is nice, as it allows the wife and I to have a conversation, or sometimes we meet friends their and catch-up. The play area is supervised as well, which is a plus.\\n \\nAlcohol - This is one of the few places you can relax and enjoy a decent pitcher of beer while the littles burn off energy. Might not seem like a big deal to some, but parents of young kids can appreciate a cold one after a long week. They have several beers on tap, and I think they serve wine as well. I don't usually drink here, but every once in a while I split a pitcher with a friend. \\n\\nService - I have been to Papa's a lot. I have never had a problem with service, which to be honest with you, is really quite surprising. When this place gets cranking, it seems quite hectic behind the counter, but I can only think of once that they forgot a kids meal, and they more than made up for the mishap. \\nBottom line - Papa's is a great place to take the family, visit with friends, and relax. It is one of the best places I have ever been in terms of allowing adults to relax and kids to play. This isn't always what we are looking for, but when it is, Papa's is the place. Given the volume of people this place can handle, if you go on a busy night, you probably won't get top notch service. You will get good service in a great environment though, which is all I ever ask for of this place.\\n\\nA couple of tips: Thursday night is buffet night; this is a good night to go if you need to get the family out of the house for cheap. I get the wife and me a buffet and the kids split a kid's meal and we are out less than $20. For a night of fun, that is a bargain! Keep in mind, Thursday does get busy, and sometimes they struggle to keep the pizza bar stocked. They send coupons for your birthday; you can sign up every member of your family.

The last time I came to get some Pho, I thought they were somewhat generous with the beef and noodle portions. Although the beef tasted somewhat plain to me, I usually create a mixture of spiced up Sriracha sauce and tasty Hoisin (literally means seafood in Cantonese Chinese) sauce and it definitely made a significant difference in enjoying the Pho. \\n\\nI decided to come back to see how they do with other dishes. I had the #52 Bun Thit Bo Nuong, which is the Grilled Beef Vermicelli. The beef was decently good, piping hot out of the stove but slightly hard to chew. The noodles tasted plain initially, but thanks to the vinaigrette provided, it gave the noodles and fresh vegetables a decent flavor and made the dish even tastier. Overall, it was a pretty good dish. \\n\\nI had the #2 Goi Cuon, which is are the Spring Rolls, with Chicken and Shrimp. They were also decent tasty, but I did not think that the shrimp was really fresh, and the chicken was a tad dry. The peanut Hoisin sauce did make a significant difference to the taste. It's not my top choice to get Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but they are not a bad choice for an appetizer. \\n\\nIn terms of rice dishes, I had the #39, Com Suon, which is the Grilled Pork Chop over rice. I thought it was a filling dish, the pork chop was really tasty and the vinaigrette tasted really good with the cold vegetables. I also had the #42, the Com Ga Xao Sa Ot, which is the Chicken Lemongrass on Rice. I thought it was a mediocre dish. It consisted of chopped up pieces of chicken doused in a spiced sauce. The chicken was okay. I was not expecting the chicken to be prepared that way and I was wondering if I ordered something wrong. Overall, it was a filling dish but I think there are better places to get good Lemongrass Chicken with rice dishes.\\n\\nThe place can get noisy during the weekday lunch hour, almost sounded like a cafeteria when I went.

Good breakfasts, good portions. Nothing special and fancy...just good food. So you'd think...good diner food...what's so magical about that? Where the magic really happens....the calzones! I know I know...you think calzone. You think a pizza turnover. Big deal. Sal's calzones are like no other calzone I've ever had before or since.

It's got all kinds of meat and cheese and i think spinach or something. But the magic....it's something about how they roll all the ingredients together.

Otherwise...(one of the) BEST BURGERS IN AUSTIN.  I've lived in Austin since 1980.  Tasted more than a few pretenders to the best burger throne.  Lebowski's is on par if not exceeding the greats such as El Sapo, GM Steakhouse (RIP), & Roaring Fork's Big *ss Burger.  Quality is slightly above those places.  I.E. Great!  Price is about $20 for 2 fully loaded bacon cheeseburgers with included sides of fries or tots.  Whether dining in or taking out, the scene & people watching is excellent.  Sit in the full bar.  Sit outside the bar watching folks bowl.  Knock out a few frames.  While Highland Lanes has been around a loooong time they take good care of the place and the surrounding parking lot.  Nice, upbeat & on the ball folks at Lebowski's and working at the bowling alley as well.  Zero attitude and 100% commitment to quality.  The cost to value ratio on these artery clogging meat-bombs of God is OFF the chart.  I'm partial to the Dude Infusion bacon cheeseburger.  That's a bacon cheeseburger with grilled jap + poblano peppers, & jap jack cheese.  Not nearly as hot as it sounds.  Just the right level of spice without burning a hole in your soul or your wallet. Not ruined by being overly gloppy like lots of places that overload the burger or undercook the patty.  Burger ingredients belong somewhere other than added into the patty and the lords of meat mayhem at Lebowski's know what to do and do it well.  Are you drooling yet?  Get to Lebowski's.  Get down & get it on.  They take credit cards.  You can call in an order in advance.  Usual turnaround from order to ready is about 15-20 minutes on a normal, non busy day.  The Coen Brothers would come back to live in Austin if they knew someone was doing one of their best flicks this proud.

Our first stop was the much anticipated Thurman's. Since they don't take reservations we timed it right and got there a bit before they opened. There were already a couple of people waiting. By the time the restaurant opened (a few minutes later than the posted time) the 10 or so of us standing outside had all discussed who had been there and how long the wait usually was in the evenings. One local couple swore by the place and we eagerly awaited our lunch.   \\n\\nWe began our meal with a basket of hand cut fries in sauce. We had incorrectly assumed that fries would come out with the burgers. Strange but we were hungry so we rolled with it. I guess whoever was hand cutting the potatoes was lazy or ran out of time because the pieces were huge. Or maybe that's just the style around here. They ended up being an overcooked, under fried, soggy mess. The sauce certainly didn't help matters and it was so non-descript that we couldn't put a finger on what it was. A teriyaki flavored gravy? We only ate as much as we did because we were hungry after an entire morning on the road and the burgers were taking forever. I remember thinking how gross it was that I kept eating it and that I should save room for the famous burger I was about to have. As it turns out it was a lose-lose.    \\n\\nJustin got the Thurman Burger and I picked the Blue Cheese Burger and added on bacon. All burgers are 3/4 of a pound (except the Thurmanator which has two patties and is $18). Though tempted to get the Thurmanator, Justin went with its smaller version that had just one patty and all of the other toppings (ham, mushrooms, grilled onions, multiple cheeses, all the fixins) save bacon. Mine had blue cheese dressing and mozzarella. The burgers were really cooked, the cheeses were gooey in a way that was distracting, and the massive amount of shredded iceberg lettuce coupled with the size of the patty made it difficult to eat - it was impossible to get a bite with everything on it. I ate about half of my burger and Justin wasn't close to finishing his either (a rare occasion for those of you who know him).   \\n\\nI have no idea how anyone could like Thurman's. The food wasn't good. The service wasn't good. The restaurant wasn't hole in the wall as much as it was just dingy and unkept. Maybe it's just a local thing...after all the Midwest is know for having large people where 3/4 pound patties are all that matter...but anyone who appreciates food made well  with good flavor won't find anything to appreciate.

The toasted wontons were slightly overdone. \\nFor my entree, I had the barbacoa cauliflower tacos. They're usually served on pita tacos but I asked for regular tortillas. I don't typically order vegetarian dishes but with the wings and the ribs and the tuna, I didn't need any more protein. I needed more veggies. I can't believe how tasty it was.

It looks like they have a gluten-free menu now (with GF bread basket--wow!), but the last time I was there, there was really nothing I could eat without a lot of question-asking and modifications to existing dishes. \\n\\nI got a chicken dish with artichokes; I don't think they have it on the menu anymore.  Anyway, the sauce had wheat in it (which I'm allergic to), so they said they could leave the sauce off.  I'd actually eaten this dish previously, not knowing what was in the sauce, but it was delicious!  Without the sauce, however, it was a disappointment--tasteless.  It's a huge serving, so I ate half and was going to take the rest home (to add my own seasonings!).  When the waitress came over and asked how the meal was, I offhandedly mentioned that mine was bland, so she took the plate away and took the dish off our check.  Well I couldn't exactly ask for a doggie bag at that point, haha.  However, then I was still hungry.  \\n\\nSo I ordered a dessert, which according to the menu had a chunk of something wheaty on the top that I planned to just remove.  However, after I ordered this, the manager came over to yell at me for ordering it!!  Really??!  He was seriously ANGRY that after I'd told them I had an allergy I was ordering something they told me had wheat in it--and I was seriously scared.  This all happened before Ming Tsai had gotten those new MA allergy laws passed through, and most places didn't give a shit what I ate.  Very weird situation.  I think that part of that law includes teaching restaurants that they need to educate the consumer about what is in the dish, so that the consumer can make the final decision!  Excuse me, but I know my own body, and I'm not going to sue you for serving me something that I've been warned has something I've told you I'm allergic to...most waitstaff don't understand what my allergy is anyway.

Only $15 for all you can eat sushi and entrees, for lunch that is.\\n\\nI came back today for dinner and it was a pretty unsatisfying experience. I thought there would've been special entrees or sushi rolls that were exclusive for dinner, but the only difference was that there was lobster. Nice for some, but if you're allergic to lobster like me or don't eat it generally, then everything else is the same as lunch. In other words, I really regret coming here for dinner as it was $30/person with nothing special.\\n\\nThe quality of some of their entrees and sushi have downgraded since I've last come here. Most of the entrees I had were really warm, the only thing I really liked was the chicken katsu. My parents really did enjoy the crab legs, oysters, and lobster, but they said the marinated beef was tough. The sushi used to be so much better before. Their rice for maki didn't taste seasoned with vinegar at all, and some of the sashimi was cut poorly. I did like the salmon sashimi that tasted very fresh and the salmon nigiri was good as well. They do make special maki rolls but some are a hit or miss because they'll stuff them with too many things that clash together. \\n\\nWe had a really nice waitress! When I compared my dad's ice tea with mine, there was an apparent color and flavored difference that mine was watered down and his was not. When she brought out a new one for me, my ice tea was definitely darker in color with my dad's and tasted better than his at this point. Basically, if you put all three together in a row, it would look like a gradient of watered down ice tea. She was very understanding and willing to change my drink, and apologized many times for the taste. \\n\\nOverall, if you have a craving for sushi, come here for some of the sashimi and nigiri. I think it's a good deal if you want plates full of it considering it's generally expensive elsewhere.

Unfortunately, most restaurants have been reserved.  The rustic decor of Fratelli's caught our attention, and we were also able to get seats (first sign that we should have avoided this place).  For a Saturday night, the restaurant was not busy at all (more than half the restaurant was unoccupied), but it took the server 15 minutes to seat us as he was too busy chatting with the bartender.  Once we were seated, it took another 20 minutes before the server checked in again for our drink order.  We were a bit frustrated by then as there was no explanation on the features, no water, and no cutlery set on the table.  When we ask him for recommendations on drinks, he was not helpful, and commented that he will give us another minute, which turned into 10 before he returned.  We were finally able to place the overpriced drink orders after a total of 40 minutes wait from the beginning, and fearing another delay, we did not hesitate to order food at the same time.  \\n\\nThe drinks came, and it was only satisfactory.  I find it hard to believe that a $13 cocktail would taste so bland.  Despite my love for alcohol, I held back from ordering a second as I do not want to be disappointed further.  Another server notice we did not have bread and brought us some, which was kind of her as her coworker does not seem to know how to serve.  The bread was really tough though.   Finally the food arrived after another 30 minutes in limbo, and to our surprise, the food was even more mediocre than the drinks.  My veal was too well done despite I had asked for it for medium rare, and the lasagne tasted like it came from a microwave package.  In addition, the food was luke warm at best - very unappetizing.  Our server also never offered fresh grounded pepper, nor did he ever came by to see if we are enjoying our dishes.  None of us finished our meals, and we went straight for the check, which was another challenge as the server refuses to look our way as chatting with the bartender and kitchen staff is of his utmost importance.  When we finally get our bill, we refused to wait anymore and walk straight up to the bar where he is chatting the night away demanding for the card machine/change.  Apparently, this server seems foreign to the idea of math.  He cannot figure out how to add the bills together due to the separate bills, and he kept insisting we did not pay enough while giving us the evil eye .  Only when we have given him a lesson in addition twice that he understood that we had paid (possibly more tip than he deserved).  He gave us the receipts and proceed to chat on without ever thanking us.  \\n\\nAt this point, I question why the owner ever hire such an idiot when he is rude, unfriendly, unresponsive, and cannot understand the concept of simple math.  The four of us were so mad that we had to rant all the way to the next restaurant.  Yes, we were that unsatisfied that we had to go elsewhere.  Thankfully, the lounge we ended up with was amazing, which shall be another review.\\n\\nFor Fratelli's though, I will never recommend it to anyone unless you are my enemy."},{"name":"PONKO Chicken","address":"2896 Chamblee Tucker Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Visited on a weeknight for a quick bite to eat.

The seating was the major downside of this joint, no tables indoors and only a handful of window-bar stools. There *are* a few wire tables on the outdoor patio, but hey, we dined in the middle of December. So, without a place to pop a squat, we took our chicken to the car. Hah. \\nWith the chicken meals, you have a choice of two sides. You definitely get the most bang for your buck if you go with fries, but the other sides aren't too shabby. The chicken portion is satisfying and you find yourself looking for something else to add to it. Get this, a teenie (!!) cup of their dipping sauce is extra. So if you're accustomed to your buffalo/spicy fried chicken dipped in some cool ranch-type sauce, grab some change. The fries come with a teenie cup of dipping sauce.

Great combination of modern decor infusing with the old brick all around, and I really enjoyed the open kitchen. \\n\\nWe started the meal off with drinks: Tai Chi (a Chai Tea cocktail) and an Italian Mojito. The Tai was a little too sweet, the Mojito refreshing. \\n\\nFor starters we got the mozzarella with king grab, cocktail avocado & green mustard oil. So many vibrant and fresh flavors coming from this dish. We also got a Patrick's naan with prosciutto. Finally, a place that says- hey, why do only Indian restaurants get to use one of the greatest breads in the world. The prosciutto was sliced fresh and the bread is baked before your eyes. They topped it off with greens and a dribble of balsamic reduction to add some sweet to the salty. Combination really worked well. \\n\\nFor dinner I got the Tagliata with a side of Soft polenta with chive butter and fried onions (that Jenn mostly ate). This steak was amazing cooked medium rare, and the 7oz is all you need. They served it with these soft thick breaded pan fried cheesy sticks (that Jenn also stole most of). If you love steak, I really recommend you have this. It was salty, but in a good way. I loved the crispy outside with the warm meaty center. Mmmmm, animals are yummy.\\n\\nI got a glass of Layer Cake Primitivo that was fruity at the start then ended earthy. \\n\\nJenn got the golden potato gnocchi with goat cheese. The red sauce was really original, I am wondering what kind of tomatoes they used. The sauce was sweet and something else....I guess we'll go with earthy again. She wished the portions were slightly bigger, but if you split a side, its more than enough food.  \\n\\nFor dessert we split a lemon cake that was very light and airy, something perfect to not bring over the edge of feeling overly full.\\n\\nWe went into the hotel after to check it out. There is a bar in the main lobby and I guess on the weekend it transforms from hotel lobby to hot people bar. I felt like a dork walking around in my big winter coat as people who have a slight advantage over me in the looking slamming department gazed at me. \\n\\nWe'll be back again, I'll try to look hotter."},{"name":"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse","address":"8285 Red Bug Lake Rd","city":"Oviedo","stars":"3","text":"Our family and I are regulars at BJ's.

Neptune Oyster is possibly the most perfect spot for this here Yelper.\\n\\nLocated on the edge of the North End (Boston's Little Italy), this place is easy to get to, but not easy to park close by - we had to valet the car at a different restaurant and walk a couple blocks to the tiny but wonderful Neptune.\\n\\nWalk through heavy curtains keeping the cold out, and then through another door, into simple seafood paradise. With only a few high tables and the bar, Neptune seems to crowd easily, but that's part of the fun. If you're a small party (we were three) and it's full, you might make nice with your fellow diners sitting at the same table, but don't fret: these patrons are Boston's desirables, so you're in good company. The atmosphere buzzes with either excited or already satisfied customers and proud, sociable, attentive servers.\\n\\nEverything on the menu looks delicious, and the daily specials are not to be missed, so our table summoned 18 oysters, two orders of the lobster spaghettini (Monday's special), one order of seared scallops atop braised pork shoulder, and an order of fried clams, in that order. I could rant and rave about the flavors for pages, but for brevity's sake I'll simply mention that I haven't had better, well, anything! I could return and have the exact same meal time and again, never tiring of the deliciousness.\\n\\nTo quench one's thirsty cravings, Neptune serves up some of my favorite beer, which can pretty much only be found in Massachusetts: the Whale's Tale Pale Ale from Cisco Brewery, which is located on a favorite island, Nantucket. While the ale pairs well with oysters and fried clams, the spaghettini and scallops called for something deep, red, and decanted. Though surprisingly small, and not as Italian as one might expect, the wine list sports some decent bottles, and the reserve list (called \\"Pearls\\") is, while equally limited, aptly named. After trying for a Brunelo, then a Barbaresco, there was finally a Barolo in stock. Not what I'd initially wanted, but who can complain about a Barolo? A Pearl indeed.\\n\\nSee you next time, Neptune - I hope it's soon."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Amazing food and views!!

My husband commented that he should have ordered the braised beef instead since what he was eating what not what he had imagined but he would appreciate a to-go box and the desert menu.

We look around and see that BJ's advertises that they play all the NFL games on their plethora of TV's. We hear rumors that they're offering $3 Pizookies right now, so we can't resist. \\n\\nWe get there, and there are not what we would call a plethora of TV's, but there were enough. We tell the host that we need a TV on a certain channel and for that channel to not be changed for about 3.5 hours. They say no problem, we are suspicious, but in the end it all worked out. This was a solid plan. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is great. Multiple levels of seating, huge ceilings with a giant open feeling, walls full of their brew options, and a bar that looks like it's stocked for a high school prom after party. All that and it's entire perimeter is dotted with about a dozen TV's, all up high, so there's not a bad seat in the house. \\n\\nNow for the food. We order Boneless Wings (A full pound of all-white-meat boneless wings | tossed in your choice of our signature sauces or dry rubs | served with celery sticks and ranch for dipping) for an app. We split the flavors into Mandarin Orange and Cherry Chipotle. The wings are very good. This is a lot of wings for the price compared to other places. It's also a higher meat-to-breading ratio than other places. I was very happy with this dish. They were sauced just the right amount and the flavors were interesting. Cherry Chipotle was the better one. The only strange thing was that the ranch was really thin, almost watered down, so it didn't really adhere well to the wing. It wasn't bad, just not what you expect. \\n\\nFor our main, we split a 14-inch Deep Dish pizza, half BJ's Favorite (Housemade meatballs| pepperoni| italian sausage| mushrooms| green bell peppers| black olives| white onions| seasoned tomatoes), and half Sweet Pig (Oven-roasted ham| sweet pineapple| seasoned tomatoes). The pizza itself was very thick crusted, airy and chewy. There wasn't a lot of sauce or cheese present, but the toppings were present and quality enough to make me happy. There wasn't a lot of ham, though, so ask for extra if you're a ham lover on your Hawaiians. \\n\\nFinally, for dessert, the main event, the $3 BJ's Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie (Ghirardelli triple chocolate cookie| peanut butter| marshmallow fluff| marshmallows| rich vanilla bean ice cream). This thing was thick and sweet and absolutely decadent. I loved every minute of it. You can't eat it by yourself so don't even try. Have at least one other person. \\n\\nOverall, I liked this place a lot and if I have one football game to watch at once, I'll come back.

I thought that this place served better lobster roll than Maine, though it is much more expensive at $25.  Of course, we had to try the oysters too, which were amazing.  What people don't know about it the branzini Cinque Terre style--we came to this place specifically to try it because we have been to Cinque Terre and missed branzini.  It's not quite as good as it is in Cinque Terre, but it is still pretty darn good!  They serve it whole (like they do in Italy), plentiful, and flavored with a similar pesto sauce.  The flesh of the fish was creamy, moist, and perfectly cooked.  Simply delicious. \\n\\nIt's a small place, crowded, slow service, not child-friendly, but totally worth it for the food!

The inventory in the display case is constantly rotating, so something you may have wanted to order, may not be available, but by the time your food is ready to be picked up, another item may be out and replaced with something you wanted. I actually like the rotating display case, unlike other bakeries, where everything seems to stay in the same place, because different things catch your eye when they are moved around, like the lemon meringue pie which was delicious! I also really like the packaging. One complaint, the customers can be rather rude. Flour puts out pixies cups for water, and people are too lazy to throw the cups away.

He's tended the bar here for two years, has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of booze, and tells me the Franklin Hotel was built in 1912 (the same year, I learn, that Fenway Park rose and The Titanic sank). We chat about town favorites--from the sandwiches at Parish Cafe to the totally-worth-it $8 corn on the cob at Toro--before I try a sip of the Spice.

I wasn't exactly sure what to order so my server recommended the smoke trout board with the duck duck potatoes. The trout board was completely overpriced and was the smallest portion for $15. The duck duck potatoes was better but the meal wasn't very special or original - it was literally an egg on top of some potatoes.

Guess we kind of thought there would be some cheese on it bigger than a size of a quarter.  The IPA beers were just average, but we're not impressed with many IPA's so I can't fault the Kraft H for that.  House salads were good.  3 out of 4 of us went with the prime rib , which was their Saturday night special.  Never in my life have I been served prime rib with gravy on it.  And the vegetable was expected to be on the side, but was placed on top (carrots and brussel sprouts).  We searched for the brussell sprouts but only found leaves.  The side of horseradish sauce was more like mayonnaise sauce with a faint hint of horseradish.  Being avid lovers of prime rib, a good horseradish sauce is a must.  One of us had the mussels and fries, and it wasn't too bad. Finally, we finished off the lack luster meal, with their cherry bread pudding and one s-more cheesecake.  The bread pudding was ok, but lacked a good sauce under the cream so it was very dry and the cheesecake was sickening sweet.  It was busy, but overpriced for what you thecqualiry of food.

I didn't request this but was pleasantly surprised because it was private and quiet and really let our family have our own little brunch away from the rest of the restaurant. \\n\\nWe started out with a bunch of different appetizers for the table. We got the root vegetable salad, chicken liver and bacon crostini, and scrambled egg and caviar. These were amazing! Everyone loved the flavors. We got 2 of each for the table and everything was gone very quickly. For individual dishes, everyone got what they wanted. Most of us ordered the frittata but we did also try the egg sandwich, lumache with duck, and the burger. Our whole group was happy with the food they got. It's definitely not a typical brunch menu so if you are expecting eggs benedict, french toast or something similar, then this probably isn't the best place for that. The menu was interesting and I wish we could have tried more, but unfortunately there is a limit to how much each person can eat in one sitting. \\n\\nAt the end, the waiter brought out a giant tiramisu in a bowl.

Can't say anything about dinner but I am sure it's delicious as well. The service wasn't over the top and our waiter was very patient and accommodating.\\n\\nYou might be wondering why I would give 4 stars if we absolutely loved the food, service, atmosphere, everything? Well they add 3% to your bill to pass along to the kitchen staff to support their wages and benefits. I hate when companies do things like this and try to spin it as if they're doing some good deed. Pay your employees fair wages and don't add things to your customers' bills. It's not a significant amount of money by any means and I am not upset by the dollar amount. What I find appalling is that it's okay to say 'hey we just add this on to your bill so you can help us pay our employees. We just charged you for the food, and you'll give your waiter a tip but also please subsidize our kitchen staff because we're stingy.'"},{"name":"One of the Kind","address":"1095 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"Are you looking for an inexpensive place that serves Chinese food with some spicy flavors? This place is actually not a bad choice, especially if the temperature is below 18 degrees Celsius. \\n\\nFor some strange reason, I have been coming to place often for Chinese food in the 88 Food Court. It's mainly because of the Xiang La Yang Rou Chuan that they have here. Yang Rou Chuan is a popular Chinese street food which are these lamb skewers doused with some spice. Here, it's covered with cumin spices, and each stick is about $1.50. I really liked the tenderness and flavor, and they can serve as a great complement to any noodle dish they have here. \\n\\nOne noodle dish I had a few times is the Zha Jiang Mian, also known as the Beijing Style Noodle. This is a bowl of noodles with ground pork mixed with bean sprouts, sliced raw cucumbers and mixed with a soybean sauce. I really liked the flavor of the sauce, mixed with the cool cucumbers and the soft noodles. One bowl of these noodles should be enough for a decent meal for a grown man along with a couple skewers of Yang Rou Chuan. The Shandong Style Noodle they have here is a pretty good alternative with a great tomato gravy like flavor. Their Beef Noodle Soup dish, Niu Rou Mian, had a pretty strong spice, but it's an excellent choice when the temperature is below 18 degrees Celsius. The broth had a nice richness. \\n\\nTheir Sichuan style dishes are also pretty good. I had the Sichuan Fish Fillet and their Ma Po Tofu, and they are pretty spicy but tasty dishes. The fish had a nice softness combined with the spiced flavor of the sauce. Mixing all these dishes with a lot of rice made these dishes some of the tastiest this place has to offer. If these two dishes with a lot of rice were shared with 3 people, it should be enough to feed them for a good meal. Make sure that you have some good beverages with your meal as well. All of the dishes should be under $10. \\n\\nOverall, I think this restaurant can live up to its name, \\"One of the Kind\\", because I thought the flavors were fairly unique and shows that they can make some really spicy Chinese food. If I really want some spicy Chinese food at the 88 Food Court, I would most likely come to this place.

There was a live band playing Sunday night. Seeing as the weather was so nice, there was a wait to eat outside. We opted to eat indoors so we could be seated right away.\\n\\nInside the restaurant was rather dark and cramped. They didn't have any lights on and instead depended on natural daylight coming in from the open window at the front.\\n\\nOur John Mayer lookalike server, Duncan, was very amicable and offered to recommend any items if we were having trouble deciding, but we weren't. The BF ordered nachos with grilled steak and a buffalo chicken taco. I ordered the BBQ chicken quesadilla with goat cheese.\\n\\nTin Lizzy's keeps their nachos simple. I guess it's to showcase their seasoned corn chips, which to their credit, are very good. They cover their nachos with queso blanco, lettuce, pickled jalapenos and serve it with a side of sour cream. You can add other toppings, such as black beans or tomatoes for 99 cents each or meats for a few bucks. I think it's a bit silly to charge a dollar to put some diced tomatoes on nachos when other places serve it on their nachos as part of the price, but whatever. The grilled steak was really good, well-seasoned and a nice addition to the nachos.\\n\\nI really liked my quesadilla. The chicken was very tender, but I didn't taste too much BBQ flavor since the goat cheese kind of overwhelmed any other flavors. I love goat cheese, so I didn't mind. Besides, the quesadilla came with BBQ dipping sauce, so that resolved any lack of BBQ flavor.\\n\\nThe BF really liked his taco, but said it wasn't necessary due to the sheer amount of nachos that came with his order. \\n\\nI think Tin Lizzy's biggest downfall is inflation of prices. Five dollars for queso blanco? And most of their individual tacos are upwards of $3 each. It can really add up if you are hungry. I'd say the nachos are the best bet for your money since they give so much. Quesadillas seem pretty decent for what you pay for, too."},{"name":"Roadworthy","address":"125 Washington St","city":"Dedham","stars":"5","text":"New spot in Dedham, and seriously one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had.

My wife and I tried to go at lunch because an ad they put out a few weeks ago said they opened at noon.  We go to the restaurant and the door had a sign  that said we open at 3 pm and closed on Monday.  But if you look inside the door the banner above the door says they open they are open 7 days a week and at noon.\\n\\nWe came back for dinner.  My wife and I wanted to be seated but all 4 of their tables were in use. We were told that there would be a 45 minute wait.  So we asked for the food to go.  Nearly two hours later we go our food.  We kept insisting that my wife ordered the red beans and rice (an item not on the menu we had) instead of the rice and peas.   So we took our food and went home.\\n\\nWhile we were waiting we never saw the cooks once take the temperature of the food.  Others who had children had to wait 2 hours and a couple that came in head of them had to wait 2 and half hours.  But one woman, I assume a regular, came and put in an order and said she wasn't going to wait an hour.  She got her food 15 minutes later.\\n\\nWhen we got the food home the food was spicy hot but not very flavorful.  The potatoes just fell apart and jerk chicken just didn't have much flavor. It was like the food had just been setting around in sauce.  If that's true why did it take so long to get our food?\\n\\nAfter we got our order the staff ignored us.

Sure they have the classics, Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, Pad Kee Mao, Stir Fry's but the difference is they venture into dishes that are flavorful in the tradition of Southeast Asia but not seen in most Thai restaurants.  As a frequent traveler to Southeast Asia I particularly appreciated this.  Case in point, Shan Noodles, a Burmese noodle dish that is more like a colorful tasty stew.  I had it with Beef and the beef morsels were tender as if slow cooked, but blended with a delicious but not overwhelming tomato sauce mixed with veggies, pickled mustard, cilantro, peanuts and sesame.  Not classically Thai but a mix of several of the regions flavors.  My partner ordered Green Curry Fried Rice with Tofu.  It wasn't overwhelmed by the curry and provided an opposing taste to the Shan Noodles.  Appetizers included Grilled Marinated Steak Strips (also very tender) with an addictive Chili Lime Sauce and Creamy Crab Rangoon, overly stuffed with crab filling unlike that seen in other less generous restaurants.   Overall, we were very pleased and eager to try other dishes.  I hope this new restaurant does well, it is nice to see someone willing to venture beyond the usual Thai dishes.

It's definitely enough for an entree, but my fatty family decided to turn it into an appetizer. The clam chowder was a healthier-version, less cream and more fresh ingredients. Worth a try, but I'd argue it's not the prototypical Boston chowdah.

I'd strongly consider coming back to Neptune in future Boston trips."},{"name":"Match","address":"94 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Let me just start out by saying that I have been to Match Burgers and Martinis twice. My first time was highly enjoyable, loved the pop rocks martini. It encouraged me to come back for Ladies Night on Thursdays.\\n\\nSo me and a bunch of my girlfriends decided to go to get the $5 entree deal. We made a reservation and arrived on time. We were then told we had to wait for a table, despite our reservation. We waited for 45 minutes before we were offered a booth with two separate tables meant for 8 people when there were 11 of us.\\n\\n Three of us were left standing by the table (which was in the bar area of the restaraunt, not even in the main dining area) for another 45 minutes while our martinis were ordered and served. We had no napkins, no silverware, and we were told on multiple occasions that we would be able to move to a new table shortly, which is the only reason we stayed in the first place. \\n\\nWe only ordered food because we were told that by the time it was ready, that we would be in a new section. The food arrived and still three of us were standing around, waiting for our water to be refilled (which it never was at any point in the night) There wasn't even enough room for everyone's entrees on the tiny tables. Four girls from my party took it upon themselves to split from the group and seat themselves at another vacant table across the bar just so they could eat their meal.\\n\\nWhen the rest of us told the waitress that they had moved she rolled her eyes and stomped over to the other table to serve HER customers their food. How dare we make her walk across the room where her customers were forced to re-seat themselves in order to eat. \\n\\nOnce the bill finally came, the four girls at the separate table were given a bill separate from ours (thank goodness) and the remaining seven of us paid the rest of the bill. We found, upon looking at our bill, that gratuity for our bill was included but that it was based on what the bill would have been had there not been a $5 deal on entrees. So while our bill was actually only $80, we were charged $51 in gratuity! \\n\\nWhen we asked the manager why we were charged gratuity on the regular price of our food rather than the discounted rate he said, \\"It seems that is the way the computer added it up, it appears that's what happened.\\" Excuse me, WHAT? \\n\\nBecause the promotional fliers did not denotate the fact that gratuity for large parties would be based on the regular price of food rather than the discounted price, we were not aware that was the policy. But it seemed as though the manager was not aware of this either. Fortunately, due to our ridiculous situation, he took the gratuity off and allowed us to pay tip according to our own discretion. And so we did. The service was awful, we were forced to ask for everything from napkins to forks. We left her a little over 10% tip.\\n\\nWe left the restaurant, upset over our terrible meal and awful service, only to be literally CHASED down the street by our psychotic waitress. She literally ran in a tiny cocktal dress and heels in 30 degree weather, and shoved a five dollar bill in all ten of our faces screaming \\"You forgot your change!!!!!\\" We looked at her dumbfounded...we hadn't left her change. That was PART of her tip, did she not understand? \\n\\nEither way, she shoved the money at each one of us and each one of us backed away from her slowly, as her demeanor was deranged and psychotic. And then she screamed out, \\"It looks like you need this a lot more than I DO.\\" None of us took the money, obviously. It wasn't even her entire tip. And a tip is gratuitous either way. We didn't have to leaver her a dime. She walked back inside, clearly defeated.\\n\\nNeedless to say, that was by far and wide the worst possible experience I have ever had at a restaurant in my life. I left feeling completely offended. It was as if Match and it's employees had no idea that they were providing terrible service. We all understood that it was the first night they were offering their Thursday night deal, but it wasn't even a packed restaurant. And if they were unable to accommodate our large party, then why were we allowed to make a reservation to begin with?\\n\\nAnd since when is it ever okay to leave customers standing around a table? The entire situation was ridiculous. And we would have left had we not been told multiple times that we would be re-seated. All in all, the entrees weren't even that great to begin with, great deal, but not at all worth the headache. And NEVER worth the disrespect we were shown by the staff. \\n\\nIf you ever do go to Match, be forewarned that LISA C. is actually a psychotic individual who is capable of chasing you down in public and harassing you. She also doesn't know what a tip is when she sees one, so don't even bother leaving one for her at all."},{"name":"Darwin's","address":"1629 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Seeking to find refuge on one of the coldest winters in Cambridge, I came across Darwin's .

I also highly recommend the chicken-fried trout, which came heaped with fresh, aromatic herbs. As a tip, next time I'd order it with extra herbs in leiu of the butter lettuce wraps, simply because the fresh dill paired so amazingly well with the rich gribiche sauce. \\n\\nWill be returning soon!"},{"name":"Yuki Shabu-Chinese Gourmet","address":"16 Bow St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely delicious!

When I spend $130 on a meal for two, I think it's fair to expect something extra. But it just wasn't good. Don't get me wrong, I had a somewhat delicious meal with my significant other, but it just wasn't $133 delicious.\\n\\nAs we walked in past the green Mantra logo projected onto the sidewalk, we heard the hostess sharply (in an almost scolding tone) informing another couple that since they didn't have a reservation, there were no tables...but, \\"You can sit at the bar if you want...\\" The other couple declined and left.\\n\\nAfter we were seated at our extremely wobbly table, we looked around for a wine/drink menu, but there was none. After 10 or so minutes our very polite waitress brought us water and gave us the VERY tattered, nearly unreadable wine menu (either from a liquid spill or over-copying or just wear). I asked if there was anything we could do about the table. She said sorry and mumbled something about it being unfixable. Since both me and my gf were getting splashed in the face by our water every time one of us touched the table, I finally took our my wallet removed some business cards and put them under the base of the table fixing the problem in a matter of seconds. Definitely wasn't expecting to be on my knees in a sports coat tonight!  Anyway, my gf wanted a cocktail, not wine, so after another several minutes of waiting, we asked our waitress  if there was a \\"cocktail menu\\" and she happily brought us one. \\n\\nBy the time we ordered our drinks, it had been about 20-25 minutes or more, and we were ready to order our food. My gf asked if we could order our food as well and the waitress said \\"Sure...but I'll be right back and then she vanished. About 5 minutes later she brought us our drinks, a friendly man appeared, and without telling us who he was he said, \\"Do you know what you want?\\" I guess we have two servers!\\n\\nFor apps, we ordered the MoMos off the bar menu...chicken and foie gras dumplings with a nice chutney dipping sauce. They were pretty good. The chutney dip was delicious. Also got the $18 crabcake app. It was tasty with what seemed like a refined cheese sauce. Unfortunately, it was served luke warm. \\n\\nWe were also brought a complimentary 4-5 sip warm coconut soup in an espresso glass, which was creamy, buttery and definitely delicious. Too bad it wasn't on the menu! \\n\\nFor the main course, I ordered the duck breast. It was good but not exceptional. I am used to duck being a touch more rare, usually with a bit more texture on the exterior. The sauce again was good...but is not anything I will be thinking about tomorrow. The broccoli rabe was well seasoned, and the accompanying potatoes...fine.\\n\\nMy gf had the goat cheese and potato tikki, and said she really liked it. I tasted it, and it was very flavorful, but not for me. \\n\\nThere was a huge group taking up most of the restaurant while we were there, so not sure what the atmosphere is usually. However, it was certainly a unique environment. I heard this used to be a bank? And they have certainly kept the large hall-like feeling. I will describe the atmosphere as warehouse-swanky, with a huge Buddha in the middle of the room. No...I wouldn't use the words intimate. \\n\\nIn my opinion, if Mantra is going to improve its rating from 3 stars...they've got to start with the basics like not forcing their guests to be Mr. Fix-It and getting drinks out sooner.

Their permanent collection has some good pieces, but it isn't terribly focused or cohesive. We've probably been to the museums in Philly or Chicago more often than our local museums. (I told you, we're snobs.)\\n\\nStill, I was impressed when I visited recently on a (free!) Sunday. The redesign makes the museum feel more modern and refines it a bit. The new wing is completely gorgeous and houses some interesting modern art pieces, some of which are from artists I recognize from other modern art collections.\\n\\nI also LOVED one of the exhibits. I did not know that CMA does a graphic novel residency; their current resident, Ronald Wimberly, had a fantastic exhibit about Black art and Black representation in art. It was informative, interesting, and made me want to read all of his work. I also noticed a lot of artists of color through the museum and I loved that, as well. I hope that we get even more works by artists of color. \\n\\nThe new cafe and museum shop were also pretty great. (Let's be real, you will always find Bryant M. and I in the cafe and our last trip was no exception.) The only downside was that the cafe cashier was pretty mediocre--not terrible, but slow and not at all friendly. The outdoor cafe area was gorgeous, though, and the inside was stunning. Prices were reasonable, too! The museum shop had lots of great art books, some mid-century modern pieces (an Eames lounger that I desperate want), and some cool local items. \\n\\nThe new CMA goes great with the new CML main branch (that's Columbus Metropolitan Library, yo), which is within walking distance.

The pie itself was ok, but walking into the place to make the order felt like we were bothering them. Three people were working up at the front, walking around doing things and looking at us, but it was a few minutes before someone came out from the back to ask us what we needed. I get it, you're busy at your job, but a simple \\"someone will be right with you\\" is the least they could do so we're not standing there like idiots. \\n\\nWe used Wild Wood a second time for our wedding and ordered two dozen cupcakes. We placed the order about 3 weeks in advance and were assured we could pick them up in the morning. When picking them up on the day of the wedding we were told they were still baking because they didn't have strawberries but we could pick them up later. Any other day and this probably wouldn't have been that inconvenient, but on our wedding day, the last thing we need is to re-arrange our schedule at the last minute. Fortunately, it worked out and we were able to get them on the way to the ceremony. However, in the rush, we didn't check the order and discovered at the reception that half of the cupcakes were the wrong flavor. Ultimately, they're just cupcakes and were such a small part of our day, but my overall experience with Wild Wood is what compelled me to write this review. For starters, if there is a potential problem with our order, for example the strawberries being out of stock, I'd like to be made aware of it. Then, getting the order wrong is just careless.

An hour in the front of the line. Honestly I should be mad more at myself than at the bouncer for acting like jackasses but still putting a smile on their face ( they get a star for that) pretending, at least, to seem helpless, when in reality they let any thing that seemed like they had money to drop walk in. \\n\\nLet me clarify. My friends were waiting in line for 15 minutes when I got in. We were third in line. We heard it would take an incredibly long time to get in so we asked how much a table would be. The bouncer tells us that there is 1 table left and the min is 600. He said he'd try to talk to the hostess and see if he can do something about the price (obviously a tactic, but appreciated regardless). In the meanwhile, the line moves up and we end up being in the beginning of the line and paying $600 dollars when we're already in the front just didn't make sense. So I politely declined. And I think that might have peeved them off.\\n\\nOtherwise there is no other explanation to having girls wait outside in the cold for an hour. \\n\\nI was fuming at this point. Thank god for good company that an hour didn't seem too long until we looked down at the watch and couldn't feel our legs anymore. What got me more mad was how many people they kept letting in that were 'vip' - i understand there are some that are legitimately on the list, but others were just not and that got me incredibly mad. \\n\\nWe got in around 12:15 or so and i was so mad I couldn't really enjoy myself. And even so the place isn't that great where they advertise it as a las vegas inspired space. Absolutely Not. If you're going to compare to something of that nature they need to make a bunch of other changes from the decor to the random pool table that is in the corner for no rhyme or reason. It was after 11 so I didn't get to see the terrace and that perhaps could make things better, but otherwise I just couldn't deal with being there and just wanted to get out. I didn't even get a drink there because i refused to support the establishment - never have I done that.\\n\\nI ran out the door the minute my friends were done with their drinks. On a last note they have a decently good mix of music they play. \\n\\nThey should have also planned better and open the space during summer time rather than the beginning of fall. \\n\\nRegardless - my review might be skewed because of the wait time but considering i usually give the place the benefit of doubt when i first go there, this just goes to show how much i disliked this place. absolutely never again."},{"name":"SuperChefs Breakfast & More","address":"199 E Broad St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Very impressed, the banana pudding pancakes OMG so delicious. ...small place but comfortable"},{"name":"Revolution Doughnuts","address":"908 W College Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Best donuts in Atlanta. \\n\\nHave yet to try a bad donut.

We both ordered the chicken dinner and swapped out sides. I got the hot sauce, my friend had the mild, and we ordered corn bread. The corn bread was awesome (2 pieces) and moist--didn't have the corn kernels in it, and was a little sweet. The BBQ was sweet--shredded chicken in a bbq sauce, a pretty huge portion, and delish--I loved the additional spicy sauce. My steamed broccoli was crunchy, and my salad was pretty nice for a garden salad! The ambiance was what really made it awesome--it seemed almost folk-y. The tables were close together, the walls were covered in paintings, and overall it was a really fun place. Then, we got the bill.

And the size of the slices has decreased tremendously. Quality ingredients are great, when the slices are huge. Paying $8 for 2 BLAND SMALL slices is not what I came in for. Maybe because they don't think I'm a regular I didn't get better pieces? Seriously those slices are tiny and the margins made on the food is insane already just give me a couple more bites of your bland pizza so I'm not dissatisfied AND still hungry.

But I hadn't been back since then... till recently.\\n\\nYou go to a place like Joey D's, you gotta try the steaks, right? Well I wasn't in the mood for a heavy meal, so I spotted a great compromise -- a filet mignon salad. Perfect. It was priced around $15-16, which I thought was very affordable. I saw it came with a low-carb vinaigrette, but I asked for the house dressing instead (aforementioned hot bacon and mustard vinaigrette). \\n\\nI received a HUGE salad with filet chunks on top. Hey, pre-cut? I was happy about that but some people may not be. I am not sure if an entire 6 oz. filet was included with the salad... maybe it was more like 4 oz. but it was enough for me. And I guess I forgot this fact, but the dressing actually came in two parts. One was a small container of scary oily bacon fat with bacon in it, and the other is a small container of what looked to be honey mustard. If I'd known or remembered that, I would have just gotten the honey mustard. \\n\\nI very much enjoyed the salad and would order it again.

Thanks to the awesome employee working the register, I never had to settle. He suggested we double up on a trio of rolls - lobster, crab and shrimp. By doubling up we got a full roll of each instead of a half. It also came with pickles and a side of slaw. \\n\\nI tried a fancy beverage of theirs too - Maine Blueberry Lemonade with Wildflower Honey. So yummy. The wife even liked it despite the fact she doesn't like honey. It had a great bite to it.\\n\\nThe size of the rolls was smaller than I expected but they were crammed full and overflowing so that was nice. The shrimp roll was the least outstanding of them all. It was good, yes, but when placed side by side, it doesn't hold a candle to lobster on a roll. Oh, and there was a crab roll. Also good. Also a second place (tied with shrimp) against lobster.\\n\\nThe lobster roll. Wow. Huge chunks. Wonderful, wonderful flavor. Then it got better... I added their seasoning.

I tried their horseradish sauce, and it overpowered the dog. I would just get simple condiments to compliment the dog. The flavor of the meat is the star. It's too bad their buns look like it came from a some generic supermarket brand though. I guess it works.\\n\\nTheir Italian Sausage dog tasted good. It had the strong Italian Seasoning flavor to it. It came on a Italian Roll which seemed higher quality than the supermarket branded buns the regular Red Hots came from. I liked how they toasted it. \\n\\nTheir sides aren't worth getting. I would just get 1-3 dogs and ignore the sides. Speaking of which, these dogs are small. So if you have a big stomach, you would need about 2-3 dogs to be satisfied. \\n\\nI agree with some of the Yelpers, because of their size and the price, they do seem overpriced.

They weren't bad... they just neglected to have that aggressive flavoring I am used to with HPs. Their color was quite odd too. I don't think I've ever seen them that dark before. If you have money to blow then they are worth it; otherwise you'd be ok without em. BTW, that dipping sauce is a combination of Ketchup and Hot Sauce.\\n\\nThirsty? Well you're in luck..

Maybe I'm not understanding, but was complicated about getting a scoop of ice cream and putting it on top of the bread pudding?  Needless to say that pretty much ruined my experience. Other than that everything was great up until that point. I was enjoying my meal. That is the only reason why I am rating them with a 3 star, otherwise I would have given them 4 stars.

We sat in the \\"no kid zone\\" upstairs while we enjoyed a meal on our own for the first time in nearly a year! \\n\\nThroughout the fabulous meal, punctuated by friendly, attentive waitstaff, we fell in love. And thoroughly enjoyed a bird's eye view of our daughter being well-cared for, and enjoying herself immensely!\\n\\nOur daughter falls down begging to go there, and we don't usually put up much of a fight! \\n\\nMy husband adores the turkey biryani (the heat depends on the chef, and the day, he says). My personal favorite is the consistently delightful coconut curry with shrimp.\\n\\nThe best part about their menu (which is entirely customizable and sustainable, mostly local, vegan and gluten-free friendly), is that they work very hard to accommodate any and all allergies. My daughter has a fairly severe corn allergy; any corn sugars, syrups, proteins, and derivatives cause instantaneous reactions. \\n\\nShe has never had a reaction after dining here! Tres unusual, and also tres fabulous! Such a relief not to have to worry!\\n\\nEvent hosting? They are amazing, lots of communication and concern to make it a memorable one! I recently hosted two events there in quick succession, and we all enjoyed ourselves. Will definitely do it again. \\n\\nI am sad to read these negative reviews! I always find the food delicious, well-priced, and fresh as can be. Service isn't instantaneous, but, when my children are occupied, why should I rush through my meal? \\n\\nFive stars, guys, see you very soon!"},{"name":"Barcelona","address":"263 E Whittier St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"We ordered the Tapas Tasting Menu which was 7 tapas served in 3 courses for $35 per person. The first course included Ceviche de Camarones (shrimp ceviche), Ensalad de Aguacate, and Chorizo y Queso (chorizo and cheese with figs, almonds, and crackers). The second course included Mejillones (mussels), chicken, and chorizo. The third course was pineapple slice with browned sugar on it.\\n\\nIn general, I thought that the food was ok, but definitely not the tastiest tapas that I've ever had which may be the result of ordering from the Tasting menu.

However, service was pretty spotty - we had at least three different people serving us, and their English and Chinese were poor at best. One of our members was vegetarian and was asking about certain dishes; the waiter seemed shocked that anyone could not eat shrimp or seafood and was not knowledgeable when asked if certain dishes contained meat.\\n\\nThe food is also rather pricey; the portions were extremely small. Our group ordered both dishes and several plates from the dim sum menu (with the expectations of having leftovers for another day), but the dim sum platters - at $2.50 each - were highly disappointing. The lotus seed buns, for example, only had three tiny buns and were rather lukewarm. They tasted like frozen food that had just been microwaved. The scallion pancakes were okay, though also extremely small in the portion size, and the shrimp and pork dumplings were acceptable. We had to ask for soy sauce to go with the dumplings, though, and the waiter forgot about our request until we had to ask again.\\n\\nThe dishes overall were okay - nothing exceptional, especially compared to the more heavily-favored Taiwan Cafe and Gourmet Dumpling House.

While we waited I told my wife at least we're going to get a hot fresh dish.   But I spoke too soon. The food arrived and to my dismay the food was at best a little warmer than room temperature.  And btw my steak literally had 4 tiny strands of onions. I preceded to get the attention of the server (remember the place was practically empty) after a few attempts and told him the dish was too cold for me and if he would microwave it for me.  He did and when it came back it was still Luke warm.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I order a latte at the end, to which I give the 2 stars to.

They give you a generous piece of beautifully seared foie gras over blackberry jam and bread.  Have all three together and you get a perfect mix of flavors in your mouth.  The Foie gras melts right when you eat it and is balanced very well with the jam itself.\\n\\n+ SKILLET CORN CAKE.  I really like corn bread, so this was a no-brainer to try.

Our server, Chris, wasn't even going to serve our table until one of the other servers told him to. He had a rude, antagonistic, and sexist attitude the whole night.  We had him once before and his attitude was bad back then too.  When we decided on what we wanted to share and my wife ordered for the table, he commented \\"Yeah, SHE's ready to order.\\"  The rest of the meal he acted like we were beneath him and did not deserve any more than muttering comments under his breath.  He and the other servers had awful attitudes. Throwing the food down on the table. Never asking how things are.  It felt like service is border-line racist as we see some tables get much better service than others.  We finished our food quickly so we could get out.  He dropped off the bill before we asked for it.  We checked that it was correct, then told him we had a Groupon. He lectured us about how we should have given the Groupon first. We ALWAYS check the bill first at every restaurant to make sure there are no mistakes and have never heard anyone complain.  Plus, we never asked for the bill.  That was the last straw. My wife explained how we wanted to make sure it was correct. He thought this was unacceptable and argued with her.  He complained some more that he had to print another bill.  We left fuming and called the restaurant to speak to the manager. The server, Chris, picked up the phone and pretended to be the manager. We knew the manager was a woman, so when we called him up on that he backtracked and told us he was \\"John\\" from the kitchen.  He was trying to pretend to be someone else to save his own a**!  Oh, but we're not done yet, folks.\\n\\nWe got a hold of the actual manager, Christine, a few days later to tell her what had happened.  Called at 6:45 to tell her that we were treated horribly 2 nights ago. She told me, \\" We are in the middle of our dinner rush. Call back in 1.5 hours\\".  You think she would've been more concerned.  I called back later. At first she was upset that we knew she was the manager. \\"How do you know I'm the manager?\\". Your employees told us and you told me on the phone 1.5 hours ago.  She seemed uninterested and after explaining the situation.  She said she will investigate and call me back on the weekend (it's Wednesday at this point).  \\"Do you have my phone number?\\" I ask. \\"Uhhhh...no, I should get that\\".  What bullsh**! She wants to call back but never asks for my phone number? Needless to say, it is now well past the weekend and no word. If she had made an attempt to make things better, maybe we would give Zen another shot sometime in the future (to be fair, the food is good but pricey and the chefs are friendly and professional) but after being treated this way by the server and manager, we will never return.

Better than good; but somehow mediocre service has a way of changing a meal memory.\\n\\nWe went early -- about 6:15pm on July 4 and it wasn't crowded, nor empty. By 7pm it was crowded and hopping. It was a bonus that there was valet parking. It was $7; but Garrido's validated the ticket, making parking simple and free. A really, really nice touch.\\n\\nRestaurant was pretty and the outside area looked divine, with fans and misters, lots of beautiful greenery just on the other side of the sizable deck. Would love to go back to sit on the deck when it's a bit cooler.\\n\\nWaiter, I think his name was David, was just sort of meh....blank, no personality, no interest in us from the start. Took our order for drinks and appetizer quickly. Made no recommendations, didn't ask if we'd been there before. Just basic function, which was okay. \\n\\nBrought our drinks, then asked if we wanted an appetizer -- we'd ordered one with the drinks and reminded him of that. Clearly he wasn't tuned in. Then he asked if we were ready to place our order. Since we knew what we wanted, we agreed, thinking of course that he would pace the order to appear after our appetizer. Bad assumption on our part.\\n\\nHe brought the appetizer, a blanco queso and freshly made chips with a wonderful addictive salsa -- totally yummy. We were enjoying our drinks and the appetizer and were almost halfway through when our dinner plates arrived. I expect that a waiter in a restaurant such as Garrido's would be experienced enough to time the meal for maximum enjoyment. Bad assumption on our part again.\\n\\nThe restaurant was getting busy, and while we didn't see our waiter again for a long while, plenty of others stopped by to ask if we were enjoying the food; and we were. Unfortunately we were never asked if we wanted more drinks. We finished our appetizer after the meal was completed (at least no one tried to take it away - we clearly weren't finished). \\n\\nWe were craning out necks just to find our waiter to order more drinks, but never saw him. By the time he came around to ask about dessert, we were not inclined to stick around for more of anything. \\n\\nI'd go back to have the chicken enchiladas; but I would hope to have a different waiter. I'll try it again; but seriously if it's the same experience, I won't go back.

I have been here for drinks several times and have always had fun.  The restaurant was no different, it has a very cool vibe.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, we all agreed that the food was just OK.  I had the tuna dish and really felt that it lacked punch.  The beans that were on the plate were practically raw.  The tuna itself was a little chewy and there wasn't enough of the sauce to help it out.  My fiance had the duck which was much better than the tuna.  The breast meat was thinly sliced and flavorful and then leg had a crispy skin that was to die for.  Another person in our group had the tortellini filled with greek yogurt.  It was SO delicious I couldn't believe it.  I wanted to steal the bowl from him!  \\n\\nWe didn't order a dessert but they brought out a plate of cookies with Happy Birthday written in chocolate sauce.  So that was a great touch.

Our server was not on his game for the mandatory tip he received, party's of 10 or more are automatically charged 18% gratuity. Our server did not return to our table after our meals where served and we had to flag down another server to send meals back for cooking adjustments, and request more bread and steak sauce despite asking our original server upon delivering our meals. As I mentioned we were there for a birthday celebration and I had to remind our server of this after he delivered our bill.

The wait staff was friendly and attentive. We ordered small plates - the mezze, calamari, scallops, a bottle of wine. Downside: the prices are expensive and the portions are really, really small. They charge $7 for one lollipop lamb. The calamari was literally a tiny portion of the tentacle, charred. They gave one tiny scallop (1! not the large ocean scallop) as a small plate. The mezze was more generous but they gave 4 pita squares, yogurt, one small mozzarella ball, a little bean spread and maybe 5 olives...for $25! We actually had to ask for more pita bread. I was starving from the small portions that I got a hamburger (it was ok). I cannot imagine how hungry the other girls must have been with their \\"small\\" plates.

This restaurant truly hits it out of the park - in fact, I can still hear the car alarm going off on Lansdowne Street from the baseball breaking the windshield.\\n\\nThe whole approach to the Liberty Hotel is reminiscent of a full-scale resort, complete with a parking area and drive-up.  It's amazing that they managed to pull this off in Boston.  Scampo is right on the first floor, with its own separate entrance.  The restaurant has a modern, but comfortable, vibe, with plenty of room between tables, cushy and comfortable barstools, and friendly door staff.  It made me feel like I was on vacation in Florida.\\n\\nI sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by Brooke and her colleagues.  I found the service to be superb, from the other bartenders and barbacks refilling my water to Brooke's friendly chattiness and to another bartender (female, didn't catch her name) who served as a sommelier of sorts, guiding me to the perfect wine for what I had ordered.\\n\\nI ordered the slow roasted salmon with fiddleneck ferns, coconut milk and lime, and jasmine rice.  It even came with a little mango salsa, which complemented the fish very well.  The salmon was cooked such that I almost didn't need a knife at all to cut it up, which is the way that I like it.  With the little salad garnish, I caught a little flavor of ginger, which was a good match with the fish.  Additionally, the coconut milk and lime sauce paired swimmingly with the salmon.\\n\\nI chose a dessert wine, which was a chianti.  However, this was different from what I had expected - more of a white than a red wine, and much sweeter.  Brooke asked me if I still wanted it, and I decided to go for it, since I hadn't had it before.  I was pleasantly surprised!  It was a dessert wine in every sense of the word - sweet, smooth, and easy on the palate.  She even brought me a small sample of a normal \\"table wine\\" chianti to be served with dinner, and it was very nice, too. It's something I occasionally have with Italian food.\\n\\nI'm definitely coming back to Scampo sometime in the near future.  I was a little intimidated since I knew that there was a lot of hype about the place, and I was afraid to feel out-of-place in a more upscale environment dining by myself at the bar.

We ended up arriving just before 9 pm on a Saturday night so the place was busy.  There was all kinds of groups but in addition to date night and family groups there was quite a few gals night out.  Yeah!\\n\\nAs mentioned by other Yelp reviewers, the happy hour is a good deal and it starts again at 10 pm.  However I was not ready to wait that long.  On the board they have two prices and the lower one is for happy hour.  I tried the featured drink which was called natures table and contained gin and an herbal liqueur (price 6/9.)  Oops it tasted like cough syrup but it got more tolerable as I went along.\\n\\nFor the appetizers there is a flat bread (country pinic)  and also an ahi tuna strawberry salad.  The flatbread was pure comfort food but the tuna was like getting two starters; a salad and the tuna.  I guess it all depends on what you are craving, you can't lose.\\n\\nOn the entree my husband got the steak which comes with two large shrimp, mashed potatoes and asparagus with hollandaise sauce.  I had the salmon with peaches, the same mashed potatoes but with a kind of peach sauce and haricot verts (green beans.)  Again with the steak you are getting steak and shrimp which is a twofer although the salmon was cooked to perfection and was nice with the peaches.  Hollandaise is always a trump card but the green beans were the clear winner over the large stalks of asparagus with taste and texture.\\n\\nWe asked our server for a recommendation on the dessert because unlike most of the population we are not cheesecake fans.  That left the bread pudding and the peanut butter & marshmellow pot de creme (which is like a panna cotta with a toasted marshmallow on top.)  She recommended the bread pudding which was clearly the winner and is served with delicious vanilla ice cream.\\n\\nI took a star off for service because we waited a long time to start getting our food service.  Three courses took just shy of 2 hours and we eat fast.  When we got our appetizer they said they had a computer glitch and the kitchen did not get our food order.  Then instead of the creme de pot we got an order of cheesecake and by the time we got the right dessert we had already consumed the bread pudding.  The chef says the creme de pot cannot be made to go because it is served in sort of a jam jar type container.\\n\\nWe really enjoyed our meal and they are a scratch kitchen so everything was made fresh.

Additionally, we had the fried Gyozas which I believe were a little bland but still pretty good. My biggest complaint was that my boyfriend's meal of Pork Rice bowl came out with our appetizers along side his soup and salad.  For my dinner I ordered eel roll and rainbow rolls. I thought the sushi was really good, tasted very fresh. I was a little upset that my food came out about the time that everyone else at the table was finishing up.

I ate downstairs one night and had one of the worst waitresses I've ever had in my life. I saw she messed up the order of the people next to us so I was a little worried, but hey, it happens. When my friend ordered a sandwich without some of the toppings on it, our waitress asked if my friend could just have it without any toppings because it was easier for her to write down. I've never heard of anyone saying anything like that before; it shouldn't be that much of a hassle to write down a few extra words. The waitress also forgot several things we asked for. Finally, she came over and said a show had just let out and they were about to get a lot of people, so she tried to kick us out of our table while we were still finishing our drinks by saying we could go stand over at the bar. I'm pretty sure she said the same thing to the table next to us because they left pretty quickly, and the table remained *empty* for the rest of the time we were there (at least half an hour).

I had read a few reviews and knew that the chef used locally sourced meats & veggies almost exclusively...and that freshness was a concept not taken lightly.  The fish tacos were on special, so I took a chance.  Blackened tilapia (freshly caught the day prior), micro greens (sourced locally), homemade sour cream, and a mild mango sauce all came together to create a magical experience.  I'm a huge fish taco guy...and I've had fish tacos everywhere.  These were near the top of my list...no lie.  I finished my lunch with a much recommended piece of bread pudding (homemade with a cognac reduction sauce).  Great meal.  \\n\\nBesides the food, I had a chance to talk to the staff.  They really cared about what they were doing, and even the chef came out to let me know that he was excited to make the fish tacos for me.

We arrived around 7:30 to a really nice space that was about 80% full.  That's a nice busy buzz without being too loud.  We sat at the bar and were greeted quickly.  It's a small menu that focuses on execution rather than crazy ingredients.  We checked the beer list and wine menu and found them both to be quite nice but I do have a couple bones to pick with the wine list.  Maybe it's best to go with a Pro/Con list.\\n\\nPros\\n-The food was very nicely presented and definitely worth the prices charged.  The house made brioche wouldn't work on a sandwich but was perfect for the cheeses and the dips.\\n-Really cool space.  \\n-Extensive beer and wine list that has some beer offerings I haven't seen elsewhere.\\n-The volume was perfect.  Enough to keep you conversation private but not deafening.\\n-Very friendly staff.\\n-Overall dining value was very, very high.\\n\\nCons.\\n-They use an iPad based POS system which is pretty cool.  However they spent quite a lot time looking at the various screens rather than refilling our wine.   First glass was super fast.  Waited for the second one longer than we should of considering they were only 5 feet away.  Technology is only a boon if it frees one up to be more face to face with the customer....not less.\\n-I found the wine by the glass list a little pricier than needed.  I know that good Pinot Noirs aren't cheap but the mental jump from spending $15 for two glasses of wine versus $20 is significant.  I think it may be priced higher by the glass than needed to push you towards buying the whole bottle.  I found the bottle prices excellent.  \\n-The wine flight was served in tiny brandy snifters.  I realize it's a 2 oz pour because of the \\"flight\\" aspect but it really detracts from the wine experience.  The bar has enough full size wine glasses to outfit a joint 3 times their size so why not maximize the wine experience.  You simply cannot properly enjoy wine in what is essentially shot glasses.\\n-The malbec and pinot grigio didn't add anything to the flight.  The malbec was oddly flat and forgettable.  Not the rich experience one expects from malbec.  The pinot grigio was well pinot grigio.  It was a high quality pinot grigio but really why bother?  Change the malbec to a better example and drop the PG from the flight please.\\n\\nAll in all it's a cool little place that by effort and enthusiasm of the staff should be in the 4 star range very quickly.  I know they've only been open 4 weeks but an honest review rather than one colored by the fact they're new I believe to be more valuable.  They won't be new for long.  \\n\\nOne final note.  I did find that they had tons of staff on for what is only 40 seats at best.  The food was great but it's not pricey at all.  The beer and wine on the whole are about market rate.  When you consider the check average versus having at times a 2 to 1 customer to staff ratio I worry for their books.  Folks gotta get paid.  This place is definitely worth visiting.  It's high quality and low prices will either make them a very hard seat to get or the inescapable laws of finance will drag them in an undesirable direction."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Ordered the Noah's ark.

I do not understand why he is so bothered by a three star review now turning into a one star review. But I stand by what I wrote and I will counter with the fact that I was not in any way rude to anybody there nor was my husband. We have never been accused of being rude in any establishment we've ever been in whether we were happy with it or not until now. We are both completely astonished by his actions and words here.

I own the shop with my partner and we take an amazing pride in serving the community and providing the best possible experience and product.\\n\\nFirst off, I'm sorry, but I cannot control who in my shop wears what for personal care.  Simply, that complaint is unfounded, it appears you found our backyard, there's plenty of room to avoid smelly patrons.\\n\\nThe picture of you sourdough looks as if it was eaten and enjoyed, likewise your mocha looked like it was almost gone, I take that as you liked it..\\n\\nI'm sorry, but reviews like this hurt a small business, especially ours when we already have a hard enough time getting business with our location, as is.  Additionally, most of your reviews are low and very belittling.  Sorry, why couldn't you bring this up with your barista or me before bashing my tears, sweat, blood, and family's livelihood?\\n\\nPlease reconsider leaving hurtful reviews next time and consider that a local family relies on our customers and this just HURTS!\\n\\nBrice\\n\\nAdditionally, in a review you mention your son working at a small business?

There were no customers. \\nSecondly the sourdough bread is half eaten because my husband was hungry enough to eat half of it. The rest of it when it's the trash when we got home. \\nThird the pictures of the coffee were taken before I even took one drink. They were not almost gone,that's how I received ...\\nService was friendly, it would've been a One star review. Your comments here and on my other check ins are making me rethink that. If you can't handle criticism and critiquing, then perhaps you need to find another business.\\nAnd as for my mocha, it too was dumped in the sink when I got home. But again this is my opinion and I have different taste than other people clearly so just be happy you have customers that like your coffee and leave me alone\\n\\n\\nHis reply a few days later:\\nI'm racking my brain and trying to figure out who the perpetrator was. Honestly it's been a tough couple weeks, I just started graduate school and had surgery a few days before you review me and it was really disappointing seeing my place wasn't run the way we want it. Again, sorry for that. \\n\\nIn regards to my own growth as a business, do you happen to recall who was there that day?

I wanted more of this!\\n\\nLamb rendang stew: 4/5: flavorful and comforting. The lamb did not taste gamey and the spices were on point for the rendang. The only gripe we really had was that there was too much rice and too little stew/ sauce. It was barely enough to cover the amount of rice given. \\n\\nSteak: 5/5: I forgot which one we got, but it was delicious ! It was a big juicy steak cooked to medium rare perfection!

Because there were only two of us, they were able to get us quickly - however, it was at a cost. We were sat at the back by the kitchen.

I was losing my appetite but I kept telling myself the food would be worth it.\\n\\nMy friend and I had trouble choosing. I'm not typically a pancake person but every ginormous stack that walked past me made me want to try a bite. The waffle sandwiches are what originally brought me here, but I wanted something completely savory. My friend opted for the Superchef platter with bacon and cheesy eggs, while I went for the breakfast pizza. I was hesitant about the candy bacon and I should have went with my gut because it was not good.\\n\\nThe food took awhile to come out. I gave them the benefit of the doubt because it's busy and I felt like they were hustling. When the food came out, I was honestly like \\"wtf is this!?!?\\" My friend was given a rather large portion of eggs, bacon, bread & salad, while I was given a grocery store flatbread over-topped with over cooked eggs, sweet bacon, cheese, lettuce and sausage. Everything in the description looked fantastic, but none of the items melded together and my eggs were difficult and rubbery. My friend's eggs looked great - cheesy and creamy, just like eggs are supposed to be. The bacon had no business being on my breakfast flatbread. I had to douse the thing in hot sauce and ranch to get it down. Everything looked delightful and I was so sad because I felt like I chose the runt of the menu.\\n\\nI think I may be willing to try here again, but I'd have to be convinced of some things.

There is another creole/cajun type of restaurant on High Street (Da LeVee) but the pieces of seafood and meat that you get there are so tiny that they are practically nonexistent. Not here though- you get large, juicy pieces of delicious seafood in every bite.\\n\\nI also love how the restaurant is so devoid of any pretentiousness. They have made minimal effort to decorate the place.  When you wait you can sit on plastic lawn chairs and the paint on the walls are chipping. What keeps a lot of people coming back is the yummy, inexpensive food and generous portions, and it doesn't hurt that the staff is so nice as well!"},{"name":"Food 101","address":"4969 Roswell Rd, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I have lived in Atlanta for years and can't believe that I just tried Food 101 for the first time.

They served a nice  butternut squash soup and a very nice beet salad.\\n\\nFor entrees, we had everything from shrimp and grits, a really good pork roast served over grits and collards, New England cod, lamb chops, and a really fantastic three-meat meatloaf.

Came in and loved the atmosphere. Really high up there in location and in wealthy looking.\\n\\nWas blessed to be able to afford to come here with my husband on a gift certificate that was a wedding present to us (thank you aunt liiza and uncle greg), and we were pleased with the order we had. We both ordered the bacon hamburger, which came with shoe string french fries for only $10, which was probably the cheapest thing on the menu. Along with that, we also tried the kung pao calimari, thinking it would be really spicy cause we both love kung pao. That dish alone is filling enough! its an appetizer around $7 or so. Though I would have to admit, it wasnt what I thought it was going to be. I thought it was going to be a lot tougher and chewier thinking that it was octopus, which I have had before. I was in fact squid, and it was very light and airy. They looked huge and kind of intimidating to really look at and understand, but wasnt all that bad. They werent the worst, but wasnt the best either. If it had been smaller, it would have been great, but the more you had the more you noticed just how soggy they seemed to be, and how boring the texture was to your mouth. Those ideas made me sick after a while, and we couldnt finish it.\\n\\nThe portions here are great for your buck! really good, and thats something I really shoot for. If I have to pay for an expensive meal, thats one thing, but there better be enough there to feed two hungry people and enough for a doggy bag afterwords.\\n\\nThe hambergers were the kind that melted in your mouth, The meat was cooked but incredibly tender to the touch. Didnt need to use a knife to cute through any of it. \\n\\nIt was difficult to get a seat next to the window, but wouldnt have been a problem if you wanted to wait for half an hour, or if you got there by chance when someone had just left, cause it was a first come first served sort of thing. \\n\\nThe pianist was great and we had fun requesting some interesting songs to hear.

Only 4 stars instead of 5 because, no matter how good the food, any restaurant that feels like they can make such a ridiculous production out of getting a table because they are insanely popular is obviously run by assholes who don't really care about their customers.\\n\\n[If you really must go, see my previous review below, \\"MY SURE-FIRE, 10-STEP INSTRUCTIONAL GUIDE TO VISITING NEPTUNE OYSTER\\"]\\n\\nBut this last visit was not very good.  So much so, that I don't think I'll be back again anytime soon.  Been there, done that, going somewhere with just as good food, but no line (i.e., nearby North Square Oyster).\\n\\nWhat happened?\\n\\nBAD ATTITUDE: I was there before opening (#21 in line), so I could have just walked in and sat down (there's ~34 seats), but I was planning to meet a friend there for an anniversary about an hour later.  Trying to get an estimate from the hostess about how long the wait would be if I put my name down now, and she hit me with, \\"Maybe this is not the best restaurant for you.\\"  :-O  First off, I get that you are dealing with annoying tourists day-in and day-out, but this is 11:30AM and you only just opened, so maybe it should take a bit longer than that before you burn out and turn into a rude waitress.  And even then, you never, EVER say anything like that to a customer.\\n\\nOYSTERS: My usual good start to a meal at Neptune, one each of: Island Creek ($2.90); Moonstone ($3.10); and Savage Blonde ($3.30).  I've really got into Savage Blondes recently (had some more last night at Island Creek Burlington), which are pretty hot looking (could also refer to Sasha's new hair doo).\\n\\nWINES: Always good here, we had glasses of a Vermentino and a Riesling ($13).\\n\\nSAND: The raw razor clam dish (MKT: $13.50) was full of sand (or was this a crudo special, I'm forgetting).  Like a beach worth.  I tried to convince my companion that a little sand can't be helped sometimes, and my first piece didn't have any, but subsequent clams got got crunchier and crunchier and I was forced to admit that I'd never experienced anything like it.  No, I didn't send it back, because I never send anything back, so sue me.\\n\\nCHOWDAH: I've never had their Wellfleet clam chowder ($13) before, impressively labeled \\"made fresh to order.\\"  Unfortunately, it was salty (just this side of inedible).  Thin, but still slightly creamy in style (I prefer thick and creamy), however, I didn't think the flavors were very good either.  Boring and too salty.  My companion agreed.  And no, I didn't send it back, because I never send anything back, so sue me.\\n\\nTHE FAMOUS LOBSTAH ROLL:  Somehow I've never had this, which must be the most celebrated roll in all of Boston ($31).  Probably because there is always something more interesting sounding to try on the menu.  But I figured it was finally time to bite the bullet and try one, in this case, hot buttered (they also have a cold mayo version).  All-in-all, it was fine, and I can see why some people love it.  First, it is large with a LOT of lobster meat.  Probably a good deal for the price versus many competitor's daintier rolls.  And if you like pure lobster flavor, this might be the roll for you.  However, personally, I found the meat more firm and well done than I prefer (not like the succulent, tender roll at Row 34, which is my favorite).  Strangely, there was little or no butter flavor to it at all, which I found very puzzling for this style.  But again, if all you want to taste is pure lobster, this is your roll.  The brioche bun was fine but boring, and didn't add anything to the dish.  And the accompanying big pile of limp French fries were frankly awful for a restaurant of this caliber, and we didn't make much of a dent in them.\\n\\nOther than great food, I also look for consistency and a pleasant dining experience in a restaurant that I go back to again and again.  As my above comments indicate, I had some issues with all of these criteria at Neptune, which I why I'll probably be going somewhere else for the foreseeable future.  I'd be more forgiving if it weren't for the hassle they make people go through just to sit down.\\n\\n[As an aside on North End lobster rolls: I just had the hot buttered roll at nearby North Square Oyster (next to Paul Revere's House) for the second or third time.  Although much smaller than Neptune's for a comparable price ($29), it was really delicious, with perfectly tender, buttery lobster, and served on a killer, really rich brioche bun.  If you like hot buttered, this will probably be much more your style than Neptune's.  And no line for their beautiful, quiet first-floor bar, which has been newly remodeled, with a raw bar addition coming soon where their old bar was located.]"},{"name":"Cafe Allegro","address":"12386 SW Main St","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"We tried this little Italian cafe using a Groupon.

They tried to spice things up way too much with the gravy. It was brown with spices like paprika instead of a simple white gravy where the main seasoning is pepper. It would have been better if it was simpler. The chicken pot pie was pretty good but they had an exotic mushroom gravy instead of a nice, yellow chicken gravy, which i would have preferred. The banana pudding was also good but they put too much vanilla extract in the whipped cream, which was unnecessary. I don't think normal whipped cream even has vanilla extract.

I got a pretty basic sandwhich (ham, turkey, roast beef, bacon, etc) and I was expecting it to have something that really set it apart from your typical sub place... and it didn't. The bread was proabably the best part of the sandwhich. The loaf was large and fluffy, soft and chewy, but it was pretty much all I could taste.  When I did get a hint of the meats, they didn't really taste all that great.  Also, there wasn't much mayo on the sandwhich either.  I dunno, I really wanted to like Short Bus, but I just thought the sandwhich was executed poorly.  \\n\\nDon't get me wrong here, the sandwhichs are not shitty or anything, they just are not good enough to warrent the hoops you have to jump through to get one.

I can't say enough good things about them! It has a great ambience! You can go visit in flip-flops or your Sunday's best and still feel comfortable. It's kind of dark and romantic and makes you want to have a rendezvous. \\n\\nThe parking lot is small but it also has a huge parking lot next to it that can also be used. The bartenders are really nice and friendly and they always have a smile on their face.\\n\\nNow let's talk about food. Everything that I have had there has been pretty great! I have a current obsession with the Thai Kai salad. I've had it three times in two weeks. LOL. It's this monster size salad with sliced grilled chicken, wonton strips and a peanut and cilantro dressing on the side. If you have a peanut butter craving or want to pretend like you're eating healthy, this is the place to be. I like the salad so much that I would probably go again with anybody who wants to try it :-). \\n\\nI also have to get some props for their lemon drop martini. It is fantastic! It's a little expensive, but you also get some extra on the side so it's almost like getting two martinis.

Ordered the Welcome To The Jungle Flight and tried four other beers they had on draft.\\n\\nQuality\\nLamplighter Brewing has managed to generate a good amount of buzz across the brewery scene, so I knew I needed to stop in during my visit to Boston. I started how I always do, ordering a Flight. Rather than build-your-own, they had two pre-set Flights, which personally I was not a fan of. Nevertheless, I went with Welcome To The Jungle, which came with Jagged Little Pils (Foeder Pils), Milou (Belgian Dubbel), Birds Of A Feather (NE IPA), and Kieran (Barrel-Aged Barleywine). During my visit I also tried Brunch (Nitro Breakfast Stout), Rabbit Rabbit (NE Double IPA), Brothers Antitoi (Wild Beer), and Riley (Barrel-Aged Mixed Sour). First, I have to say they are brewing the right beers. With hazy IPAs and sour beers dominating the menu, they clearly are paying attention to what beer lovers want. But more than that, they are doing the beers well. Brothers Antitoi was absolutely incredible with strawberry flavor, lots of tartness, and, as described, a funky flavor. Rabbit Rabbit was a perfect NE IPA with excellent mouthfeel and a wonderful fruitiness. Brunch too was a hit for me, a beer that easily could go with brunch. The only beer I did not love was Kieran, just too heavy and sharp. Still, such an impressive showing and so many hits. \\n\\nQuantity\\nEven with a massive crowd, they poured every beer well. The challenge however was trying to navigate the crowd without losing too much of it.\\n\\nValue\\nThe pre-set Flights were $10.50, while full pours cost between $7.50 and $9.50. Very reasonable prices for the beer they are churning out.\\n\\nAmbiance\\nLamplighter Brewing is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I believe it was formerly a garage space, but the brick building that houses it is gorgeous. Inside they have two sections, the tap room and then the brewery itself. The brewery area also has a to-go shop for those not willing to deal with the crowd. The tap room is relatively large and has two areas, but it still was not enough. In the front they have their main bar, which actually doubles as a coffee shop in the morning. Around the bar they have high tops and a raised lounge area. A narrow hallway on the right wall leads to a second room, which was just as busy. A smaller bar sits here with slightly less choices. Benches fill up the middle of the room and the walls have bar space, just with no seating. What was strange was different music playing in each area. The front was indie rock, while the back was blasting late 90s and early 2000s teen pop. This also meant more drunk individuals singing along in the back.\\n\\nCrowd\\nI believe Lamplighter Brewing was the busiest brewery I have ever been to. It was jam-packed when we entered with no seats in either area and minimal room to even lean. Yet somehow over the course of our visit it got even busier. I think if not for the massive crowd we would have stayed all night. Clearly there is no secret that this place has quality brews.\\n\\nService\\nWith the massive crowd that had gathered, it was clear they were just doing the best they could. I was impressed that they still allowed Flights when it got so busy, but that definitely slowed things down even more. It is hard to fault the staff when there is such an overwhelming number of people visiting.\\n\\nParking\\nStreet parking appeared to be the only option and not much was available. I would suggest public transportation or taking a car service.\\n\\nExtra\\nLamplighter Brewing is simply great. The worst thing about it is that everyone else seems to know. The space just couldn't handle the large crowds and it eventually caused us to leave. However, even as we left we grabbed a few beers to-go."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"5 stars for food quality, however these places now lack atmosphere due to rapid customer base expansion and lack of seating space to accommodate said increase.

It took about 10 minutes to get a beer as there were only two servers and the place was full but only 5 minutes to get our dozen oysters and 5 more minutes to devour them. They were amazing! So fresh, no sand or particles, didn't even need sauce because of the richness of flavor, and keeping the card was great to see where the oysters came from that we were eating. \\nThe place is very tiny so I'm not sure how the line is on busy days but we went around lunch time on a Wednesday and were able to get a table right away.\\nThe portions I saw (especially the fish and chips special, $24) were enormous!

Whenever I want to have a nice meal and a nice time and can't think of anywhere else or don't want to take a risk, I suggest coming to Murphy's.  And because it's Southern-influenced, out-of-towners enjoy it greatly as well.  I've also had several business lunches here as well.

Don't get me wrong, it is absolutely a good option for fresh and modern Southern food somewhat north of the city, but since I live in town, I would probably opt for Watershed on Peachtree or similar. It's a shame they aren't more accessible for anyone in the Southern half of the city... Maybe another location will open up one day??\\n\\nI've visited Food 101 for both lunch and dinner, usually for work events. They are on OpenTable and accept reservations, though you may not need them depending on when you are there. The dinner rush has been lighter than the lunch one, in my experience, but honestly not sure how accurate that is! \\n\\nParking is shared with several other restaurants and retail establishments, including Cibo e Beve, Cafe Vendome, Rooster's and the New York Butcher Shoppe (which is AMAZING, by the way). Because all of these locations share spaces, if you are trying to have a late lunch, you might have a tough time parking. \\n\\nService on every visit has been very solicitous, and totally adequate. We did have a really strange server on one visit who was pretty quiet and tended to just hover...but I won't judge the restaurant on that! \\n\\nI've noticed that the menu changes over time. It's not a strict seasonal change per se, but just a general evolution. There are some items not currently on-menu that I sorely miss! (Looking at you, duck rillettes!)\\n\\nRecommended appetizers on the current menu are the Pimento Cheese ($8) and the (cornmeal-crusted OMG) Fried Green Tomatoes ($10).

I believe neither of these are on the dinner menu but I might be wrong. There are a number of sammies, salads, and then some larger entrees if you're feeling particularly hungry. Prices are OK for lunch, ranging from about $12 to $20. \\n- SOUTHERN CUBAN: Smoked Pork, Ham, Swiss, House Pickle, Deli Mustard, Pressed Hoagie...$14\\n- SPRINGER MT. FARMS FRIED CHICKEN: Whipped Potatoes, Green Beans, Cole Slaw, Chicken Gravy...$16\\n\\nFor dinner, I most recently had the enchilada. You'll note I say enchilada (singular).... This monstrosity is so large that a single enchilada is too much to eat! It's spicy and savory and just so yummy. Pulled pork is the perfect crossover between Mexican and Southern food, and Food 101 does it justice!

My party of seven arrived at opening, 3 PM, and were seated immediately by a friendly and enthusiastic gentleman. He waited more than a half hour to take our order, then we waited, and waited, and waited for our food. Despite being the first customers in the door, our food was served just after 5 PM - two hours after we arrived. The wait seemed especially long because it amounted to a two hour sauna - the kitchen and dining space share the same small room and there is no air conditioning. No matter how inspired the chef may be, the experience was ruined for us. For what little it's worth, my recommendation to anyone wanting to try Ichiza would be to wait until next year, when they've got more experience and the weather is cooler."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The biscuits came out slightly warm as if they were sitting out.

There are two kinds of \\"fusion\\" restaurants - some take elements from multiple asian styles and combine them to make whole new dishes while others just offer dishes from the various styles.  This place is the latter.  The menu items are the usual things you find on asian menus.  It was still worth a try so myself and a couple friends checked it out.  Two of us hadn't eaten in about 7 hours so we ended up ordering a ton of food.  Here is the breakdown by origin:\\n\\n\\nJapanese:\\nPork Katsu - Basic and average.  \\nSushi - I honestly dont remember what my friend ordered. She did say it was fine but not amazing.  This isn't really any help though. \\nSteamed Pork Gyoza - Plain, Bland.  Reminded me more of korean goki mandu's which seem to be blander rather than seasoned.\\n\\n\\nThai:\\nChicken Satay - Tasty, tender.  The usual curry/coriander/coconut milk marinade served with peanut sauce.  Marinade could have been a little more flavorful.\\nBeef Satay - NOT the usual thai satay marinade at all.  These are more like marinated steak sticks - probably a soy sauce marinade.  Not bad but not what was expected.  \\nTofu Triangles - Deep fried tofu.  My issue was that they were not cut small enough to be eaten with chopsticks.  The sauce was an issue too...more on that later.\\n\\n\\nKorean:\\nStone Pot Bibim Bap w/Tofu. - Served nice and hot.  Tasty / as expected.\\nBulgoki Beef - just okay.  The marinade or the process needs more flavor - could use sesame garlic and scallions.  \\n\\n\\nNow about that sauce........... the tofu triangles, the beef \\"satay\\" and the gyoza all came with the identical dipping sauce.  It was soy sauce based with some scallion and maybe ginger floating in it.  I expected the usual gyoza dipping sauce but this was bland and almost tasteless.  Usually fried tofu is served with a sweeter but spicy sauce. Beef satay is usually served with peanut sauce or a light cucumber sweet & sour sauce.  It really didn't seem right that these three items had the same sauce.  Finally if the food lacks zing, then the condiments must have the zing and this sauce was zingless.\\n\\nThe staff was nice and efficient.  All the dishes came out hot and in an appropriate amount of time.  But unfortunately the food fell flat.  Nothing was terrible but nothing was notable.  Everything generally was on the bland side....maybe this is their customer?"},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The Lobster role reaches all the high expectations.

The romaine leaves were one on top of the other, making it difficult to eat as wraps. The leaves were just too large and with all the fish topping laying on top of one leaf. It would've been better served with the fish mixture in a bowl in the leaves on the side so you could build wraps yourself. It came with a side of rice that was nothing spectacular.

I wanted Bubor Cha Cha to give Penang, the other Malaysian restaurant in the area, some healthy competition. But I've got to be honest: they are only getting 3 stars because the one dish I had was tasty and good value for money. In terms of atmosphere, authenticity, and service, they would get no more than two stars.\\n\\nFirstly, let's get  one thing straight: this isn't a Malaysian restaurant per se. For every Malaysian dish that is offered (Nasi Lemak, Char Kway Teow, Asam Laksa), there is a non-Malaysian dish (American-Thai, American-Chinese, East-West \\"fusion,\\" etc.). The dessert listings are particularly jarring: Iced Kacang next to Tiramisu??? It's like whoever dreamed up the menu wanted to please everybody. Problem is, when you offer so many choices, you can't pay the same level of attention to culinary details, and quality takes a back seat.\\n\\nSecondly, the decor. Whoa. It's like an uprising of the disparate ingredients in a bottle of Worcestershire sauce. Except ultimately Worcestershire sauce produces a more subtle effect. The visually crazed interior in Bubor Cha Cha made me very edgy. Pa-kua-shaped (octagonal) mirrors on the wall suggested an attempt at compliance with feng shui principles. But there was so much else going on, I didn't know where to look; I did not feel Zen or Tao at all. I wished I could grab a hold of the decorator, look him/her straight in the eye, and say: \\"For goodness' sake, FOCUS, man!\\" (Ditto the menu's creator.)\\n\\nThirdly, the service leaves something to be desired. I'm not fussy, I don't need to be waited on hand and foot, but it's reassuring when the workers appear to know what they're doing. What I sensed here was a pervasive vibe of cluelessness. I was coerced to order the lunch special when I didn't want it. Based on Cahaya's review, I wanted to try the Nasi Lemak, which is coconut rice with curry chicken, anchovy sambal, hardboiled egg, fresh cucumber and a pickled vegetable salad (Achat).  Granted, it was helpful of my server to suggest the lunch-special version of this, because it costs a dollar less and it comes with spring rolls and a soup. But I wanted my Nasi Lemak the Malaysian way (no spring rolls, no soup - just a big plate o' rice & sides) and I got irritated when she kept pushing the lunch special (re-emphasizing the smaller version and lower price) after I had considered and declined it.  \\n\\nMy order took some time to arrive, which would not have been a problem were it not for the aforementioned gaudy decor. I know good food takes time to prepare. Luckily the Nasi Lemak actually tasted fine, and there was a generous amount of it. The sambal is better than Penang's (not so sweet; it ain't supposed to be so sweet!) though Penang makes a lovelier Achat. There was a lot of chicken and it was well cooked, with the meat falling off the bone. (I asked for a spoon to help me scrape the chicken meat off and scoop up the curry gravy, and they handed me an enormous serving spoon, further reinforcing that they are not necessarily rude, just kinda clueless...)  \\n\\nSo overall I didn't have a terrible experience, and I did leave a decent tip because I'm nice that way, but I probably will not go back until enough Yelpers indicate that the owner/manager of Bubor Cha Cha has decided on a less all-embracing theme. I prefer serene surroundings when I eat and, despite its seemingly shrinking portions, Penang still delivers on that account."},{"name":"Scoozi","address":"580 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Love coming here!

Also, I'm not the biggest fan of the chowder. On my last visit, I tried a raw clam for the first time -- and I really appreciated the experience (this was certainly as good as raw clam gets) -- but I have to say, it was a little too much for me; fresh, brisk, ocean-y, oyster-on-steroids-ish, crunchy-but-not-too-much, yet altogether a larger bite than which I'm comfortable.\\n\\nSo to sum up -- this place is absolutely fabulous, a destination restaurant for Boston."},{"name":"Covington Mill Restaurant","address":"1751 Hotel Plaza Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Had an incredible experience at the Character buffet breakfast!

Pulled the trigger on ordering a chicken okonomiyaki appetizer ($12) for the table. It was fine but very different than ones I've had before. Rather than being a true pancake like dish, this was more of a plate of roughly held together chicken, cabbage, and mushrooms by whatever batter they use. There was some sort of topping that looked like wood chips. The flavor was ok. For $12 it served the 5 of us enough to whet the appetite for our ramen. \\n\\nI debated between the Tan Tan Ramen and the Spicy Napa Ramen. Ultimately, I went with Tan Tan ($13). I did not think there was enough meat. The pork tasted good when I was lucky enough to have some in my bite. The noodles were cooked to perfection. The soft boiled eggs were perfect. But, after being told there was \\"a little spice\\" in the Tan Tan I was disappointed.... there was practically no spice and I found the broth to be bland. I added a topping of enoki mushrooms because I love a good shroom game in my ramen. It was and additional $2 for that little tuft of mushrooms! Booooooo! The bowl itself was fairly large. For the grand total of $15 it felt very mildly overpriced.\\n\\nThe service was good. Nothing spectacular. Our waitress was kind enough to answer our questions and ensured our friend who was allergic to onions could eat everything brought to the table. \\n\\nI can confidently say this is not my favorite ramen place.

Why list meat names if your entire business model is not about offering said meats?  \\n\\nThe Adobo was the best of our entrees, but not sure why they titled as such as nothing about it reminded me of the Filipino national dish.  The ample \\"chicken\\" pieces had a pleasant flavor in their own right, they did not taste like chicken.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, the Mungbean Noodle Salad was a fail, all four in our party passed after a few bites.  The protein was very unpleasant, the glass noodles a far cry from anything Vietnamese.  The Bibim Danmyeon was barely a \\"meh\\"; it looks like it would carry some spice, but alas no. Moreover, the noodles are very long, but they don't offer scissors to cut.  The Turnip Cakes and a Dim Sum-style special appetizer were not in the neighborhood at what you'd experience at a Chinese restaurant.\\n\\nOn the plus side, presentation is beautiful and service was very friendly (albeit the order took very long.)  And portions are generous, which is not the norm at vegan/veggie restaurants.  Seating is very limited, but that's what makes the ambiance very pleasing.  Unfortunately, if you need to wait for a table there's nowhere convenient and comfortable to loiter, and this is especially cumbersome when the weather is bad. \\n\\nI suppose the concept is the vegan version of pan-Asian favorites.

It would be hard to complain about the food, but it's not quite authentic in my opinion (spent a few months in Greece).

I was surprised to see there was already a line forming at the door -- always the sign of a good restaurant! Thankfully, we arrived right as the previous round of tables was finishing up, so we only had to wait about 5-10 minutes.\\n\\nAt this point I have to mention that this restaurant is not the place to go if you're looking for comfortable seating. My first impression when walking through the door was this place is TINY. Also, it has no AC or ventilation whatsoever! Honestly, it was hotter inside the restaurant than outside (and I'm writing this in July.\\n\\nBecause the restaurant is so small, my friend and I had to share a table with another couple. We tried detaching the two tables so we could comfortably have our own space, but the waiters told us the tables are stuck together. So that was a little awkward, especially as we were close enough to smell each other's dishes and touch each other's elbows. But it wasn't the end of the world. \\n\\nFor drinks, I ordered a Blood Orange Bellini (tasty but really pricey at $14) and my friend ordered a Duvel beer ($9). The Bellini was tasty and cold, but the volume is pretty small especially at that price point. The beers and cocktails aren't listed on the menu so be sure to ask your waiter for options if you want something besides wine.\\n\\nNow to the good stuff: the food! After reading other yelp reviews I couldn't NOT order the hot lobster roll. And boy was I glad I did. The bread was toasted and soft, the lobster was buttery and moist. I've had other lobster rolls with added garnishes and sauces, but this hot lobster roll is literally comprised of JUST lobster and butter. Which is fine by me any day!

From the moment we arrived Ayalla provided top notch service. She warmly welcomed us, promptly verified our Groupon and explained how everything worked as it was our first visit. When the delicious Chimichurri sauce ran out on the buffet line Ayalla immediately went to the kitchen to get us a fresh cup when we asked. The combination of delicious food and wonderful service makes Cafe Miniero a must for anyone visiting Central Florida!"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We went to this restaurant to try the biscuits sandwiches.  We got there early and there was 1 person in line ahead of us.  We ordered 2 Reggie Deluxe, 2 hash browns a water and a coffee.  It was almost $30.  A little expensive but after tasting it, definitely worth the price.  We go to sit down and luckily we found a table inside.  We waited a good 20 minutes and we still had not received out order while everyone else that came after us was getting theirs.  So we finally ask for our order and for my coffee because everyone else was getting a mug for coffee.  They have a self serve coffee, which I like a lot.  So the girl that brings out the plates of food, asked us if we got hash brown because they take an extra 10-15 minutes.  She said that the girl at the register should of told us that, which she failed to do.  Then we get our order and we get the regular Reggie not the deluxe, the egg was missing.  So we let the girl know again and she offered to get it for us or just give us a couple of dollars off.  She was real nice about it.  The food is excellent but the service is mediocre.  Next time I'll wait to leave a tip before I get my food.  So if you come here, don't order the hash browns unless you are prepared to wait an extra 10-15 minutes for your food and they are average hash browns, nothing special or unique about them.  The biscuits sandwiches are delicious and one of a kind!!!  Definitely be back for the biscuit sandwich."},{"name":"Splash Ultra Lounge & Burger Bar","address":"150 Kneeland St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"I should have known better than to come here, but had to if I wanted to see a friend from out of town.

My previous review was for the shop under past management. There was a short transition time when I thought it was just somebody's crazy sister helping out at the register, but now it is just full time crazy.\\n\\nThe basic pizza types are the same, but lately I end up with something charred or undercooked. Too much tomato. Chunks of raw garlic. One time I ordered a pizza and a calzone, and when I showed up to get them the pizza was done but the calzone wasn't because they had burnt the first one. When I got home I found that the calzone they gave me was half burnt as well, the other half must have still been stuck to their oven because this was pretty much broken and missing some big chunks off the bottom.\\n\\nOthers have commented on the transitory nature of this shop. There is so much other pizza out there that works as a known quality that I can't bother to go here anymore. Only the memory of how it could be saves it from getting one star."},{"name":"Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen","address":"2203 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"The best po'boy I've had outside of LA...originally gave this place 5 stars.\\n\\nUnfortunately, had a few bad service experiences here so it's no longer a favorite of mine."},{"name":"Grasshopper Cafe","address":"229 Bunker Hill St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Very slow.
