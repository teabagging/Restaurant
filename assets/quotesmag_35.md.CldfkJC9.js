Sure, the shrimp & grits I had had there were ok, but not nearly as good as those I've had in other places.  And those skinny truffle fries? Honestly, what's the big deal -- I'll take steak fries any day.  I've tried their burger, their steak, their mahi, shrimp tacos, salad, and still . . . nothing motivated me to write.  That is until last Thursday, when the earth moved on North Orange Ave.  \\n\\nOur little party of three's taste buds were awakened by the house-made charcuterie platter, a medley of disparate flavors and textures.  Grilled dates, smoky-sweet and chewy.  Who ever heard of such a thing?  Salty salumi.  Vinegary pickled vegetables -- a crunchy counterpoint to the salt and sweet.  Chilled custardy asparagus terrine.   Even the warm, grilled bread was divine with the other components of the dish. \\n\\nNow on to my entree.  Do you know the TV show \\"The Best Thing I Ever Ate?\\"  Were I a guest on that show, it would have to be the House-Made Ramen I consumed at this meal.  Each ingredient in this delicious concoction was treated as if it were *the* star of the show: Pork belly surprisingly lean and tender; Healthy Japanese maitaki -- the marvelous and meaty \\"dancing mushrooms\\"; Canaveral shrimp -- a fresh, succulent taste of the sea; Pickled bok choy -- a delightful foil to the rich pork broth.  And finally, the floating poached farm egg -- its bright yoke enriching the flavorful noodle soup even more. My companions were happy with their Pub Burger and Steak Frites, but my feast in a bowl was unforgettable!\\n\\nComplementing this stellar meal was my beverage of choice, Ommegang's Rare Vos, a beautiful amber ale -- redolent with orange peel and spices -- as smooth and balanced a brew as they come.   A *perfect* pairing.\\n\\nThe dining experience was enhanced by the accommodating and knowledgeable Mason, our server, who -- after \\"coaching\\" us through the menu, kept our glasses full and made sure that we were pleased with each item, never once crossing that imaginary line between attentive and intrusive.\\n\\nThese much lauded chefs deserve their laurels.

Coffee and service aside, I think it is worth going just once, (maybe even twice) to experience this severely wallpapered eclectic ambiance. I can't quite figure out how they've managed to stay in business thirty-some odd years, but people seem to love it.

That's Korsakoffee. You just seat yourself wherever suits your fancy, and wait patiently and hope until a waiter notices that you might be a new customer seated at a table. I would liken it to being a near-death rescue victim waiting on an avalanched mountain for a sherpa. This is fine if you have no plans and you're with friends; flying by the seat of your pants with adventure for the night, but I can easily see how this service would annoy some people. Our waiter was fantastic. He was just pleased-as-pie about life and put on a little show singing some falsetto Beyonce improv. But it took like twenty minutes for us to be noticed.

I started to think that maybe they were either very understaffed, or are quite possibly watching the end of Titanic and using their filtered tears to make my beverage. Both sound acceptable. Back to the decor: as mentioned before, the walls are severely wallpapered. It is like an overwhelming aunt.The ceiling reminds me of my grandmother's junk-drawer and  has a million weird tchotchkes hanging from it by plastic beads. All of the tables are mismatched and wobbly, and the entire building smells faintly of cat-pee. So all in all, you feel like you are having tea in your cat-hoarding relatives' closet. Our beverages and desserts arrived! Oh boy! Our waiter did a little dance for us again. My chai was okay, lukewarm and pretty bland. My friends' cider was good, but he was really hoping he would be able to  get an alcoholic beverage there. (Could you imagine drinking here? It would be the best. This place needs a bar!) My partners' dessert was good, but an ungodly amount of brownie, so we all shared it. It was so rich, I felt like maybe I had been graced with having a immaculate parasitic twin once it hit my stomach. It was good like: \\"Yay Grandma's house!\\", but nothing like \\"Whoa, I need to write the papers about this, I think we've found an undiscovered species of nematode!\\" We began to grow sleepy from the sugar crash, and it took an additional fifteen or so minutes to get our check. I definitely think this place profits mostly on atmosphere, but I would still come again if I have visitors in town!\\n\\n P.S. Go to the bathroom.

For me, that's when you don't know what to expect but trust that whatever the food is, it will be wonderful.  I let go of control and had a truely fabulous meal!\\n\\nOne of the reviewers said that the food was more for the brain instead of the palate and I disagree.  This cuisine involves BOTH the use of the brain and the palate which takes the food to another level.\\n\\nThere were a few very minor things that might have been improved on but they aren't even worth mentioning.  We had a table of four people and tried nearly everything on the menu.  I wish the lighting on the table could have been slightly brighter so that I could see the detail in the food.  Our waiter, Sam, was attentive yet left us alone to enjoy the food.\\n\\nSome of the reviewers are complaining about price vs. portion size.  This isn't Applebees, you fat American.  This is fine dining where you are supposed to have multiple courses.  When you only order an appetizer and a salad, I bet you will go hungry because you don't understand the menu.\\n\\nI hear a lot of reviews on here that Portland isn't a fine dining city.  I disagree.  It is a fine dining city, with fantastic restaurants and a multitude of options.

Maybe that was the problem. Asking for bacon. \\n\\nUpon getting my order there was no bacon on the potato. I told the cashier girl that I ordered it WITH bacon.

Give her the damn bacon! The guy didn't seem to care either way, immediately whisking it away to put bacon on it. She clicks a button on her register which totaled the two orders together. I told her that I asked for them to be separate over the phone. She pauses for a good minute, looks at me like she wishes I was never born, ROLLS her eyes and then grabs the guy who took my order again asking him if I placed the orders separately. He punches some buttons and then voila, the order is separate. She gives me the total for the first order. I ask her which order it is because they weren't the same items. She says, \\"it's YOUR order. \\" How the F would she know what I'm eating? Guess what? It wasn't MY order. It was my managers order.

The space between each table along the walls are so tight that a family with 2 small children had trouble seating the kids at the table.

Being that the weather was agreeable at the time, people were sitting at tables outside, and the floor-to-ceiling windows were open, creating a nice open-air environment. \\n\\nIn spite of how crowded it was, I was surprisingly able to communicate with my table mates without having to scream in an effort to overcome a certain level of noise. I attributed this to the open atmosphere of the bar/dining room. \\n\\nIn general, Matador has great ambiance, from the fire pit, to the candle-lit bar, the warm interior colors and the open air drinking and dining experience. \\n\\nThe happy hour menu and prices were excellent. Each happy hour food selection was only $4 and super tasty. We ordered nachos, chorizo quesadillas, and beef tacos. All were very, very good. Portions were nicely sized and everything just tasted really fresh and good. \\n\\nThe one aspect about happy hour at the Matador that I found perplexing was that the drink options were all full-price, and they were not cheap. I prefer margaritas over tequila shots, so I opted to try a couple of different margaritas this evening. \\n\\nBased on the exotic-sounding names and descriptions of fresh fruit (I initially ordered a tamarind, then I ordered a pomegranate), and the prices ($7.50 each), I felt certain that I would be served one of the best margaritas ever. The tamarind margarita was different, but bland. I have eaten tamarind before, so I know what it is supposed to taste like, and this was not it. I could barely taste the tamarind in the drink. Being disappointed with my initial drink selection, I ordered a pomegranate margarita, all the while thinking....now who can mess up anything with pomegranate? Unfortunately, this drink was as bland as the first one I ordered. I could barely taste any fruit. For me, drinks here were a bit of a disappointment. \\n\\nSeveral of my table mates seemed quite pleased with their various tequila shots and beers, however...so all hope was not lost. \\n\\nOverall, this is a fun place to spend some time with friends. Service is friendly and attentive, and the open air environment during good weather is really outstanding. I have only sampled the happy hour menu, which I found to be excellent, but I heard from several friends that the regular dining room menu is also wonderful...with everything being tasty and good. \\n\\nWhat I feel Matador needs to work on is their margaritas. They have a full page in their menu dedicated to margaritas, so they should be able to serve a decent one that does the menu's description justice. \\n\\nI enjoyed my time here, so I intend to go back. When I do, hopefully the margarita situation will have improved, or perhaps I'll just need to savor the food and switch to shots and beer..."},{"name":"StackHouse Burger Bar","address":"1224 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"stackhouse burger bar totally sticks out from the grimy stretch of granville that houses it, just before the bridge.  when did this place even open?  with that slutty cheap lingerie store right next door, it looks so striking.  the decor is way too lovely; concrete floors, clean white walls with minimal nature-themed wall mountings.\\n\\nbut more importantly, the burgers.  man, most pleasant dining surprise i've had in ages.  i had the stackhouse sliders, which come with pancetta, portabello mushroom, cheddar, butter lettuce, tomato and chipotle aioli, on perfect little brioche buns, and i had to tell our server i couldn't talk right now when he asked me how everything was.  the sweet sweet little brioche buns held together perfectly and the meat - despite being a bit more well done than i would have liked - had not even a trace of gristle in it, leaving it tender and...well, meaty.  we also shared their truffle poutine which was saucy and piping hot and delicious, although it could have used a bit more cheese.  the truffle actually really enhanced the gravy without seeming gimmicky, it added depth, body, and SALTINESS.  delicious saltiness.  but the show stealer was the bite i had of my friend's veggie burger.  i don't remember what was in it but it has basically set the bar against which all veggie burgers will be measured for the rest of my life.  and will fail.  i will go so far as to say it took my breath away.\\n\\nseriously.  go there.  so impressed.  maybe have a gander at the menu:\\nhttp://www.stackhouseb..."},{"name":"Oppa Sushi","address":"185 Harvard Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Cozy Korean/Japanese place with a lot to offer. \\n\\nThe place itself is small, but the staff are very accommodating to make sure a group can stick together.

I had hear great things and was eager to try it out for myself. My order consisted of queso and chips with a chicken taco salad. My coworker ordered queso as well and a shrimp tostada. Service was friendly and the actual restaurant interior itself was decorated nicely. We got our chips and queso while we waited for our entree. The chips were average and the queso tasted like processed cheese straight from the box. No spice or flavor at all. The salsas served warm along the sauce bar area were a better choice in my opinion.  Our food was brought to us quickly. My taco salad consisted of chicken, salad greens, two small pieces or bell pepper, one slice of cucumber, and half of a slice of tomato (the later of which I had actually requested to be omitted when I ordered). A small serving of salsa was served on the side. No sour cream, guacamole, cheese, or even a portion of dressing was included. This seems very odd in my opinion. At least include some cilantro! I'm mean that's the name of the place! I asked for a lime wedge in an attempt to dress the salad with something. I had thankfully had extra queso dip that I used as a make shift dressing along with the lime wedge. The chicken had absolutely no flavor and was extremely bland. My coworker mentioned the same complaints about her tasteless shrimp and queso dip.

Each person can customize as they like by adding sauce type, meat, and toppings like chopped basil and garlic, mushrooms etc. It missed the mark for me, however. The pasta was overcooked and a little (read a lot) mushy. I like a little bite to my pasta. I took out my teeth to eat this. No reason to get my teeth dirty. There also wasn't enough sauce on the pasta. Sauce to pasta ratio was off. I would like a couple more sauce choices as another reviewer mentioned. I found it a bit pricey too for pasta. It is close to $10 per pasta bowl which is ok if it is cooked right. Now it wasn't all bad. I liked the bread and the meatballs were pretty tasty as well. I think the concept is good. They just need to make a few tweaks like expand the sauces and cook the pasta correctly.

I've bought food here a few times. My first time eating their food was the year they first opened. It was winter, but me and my two friends decided to take a walk. On our way to the park, my friends wanted to stop in and place an order for dumpling soup. I had never ordered a soup with any of my food before, so I was excited. I had also never found hair in my food before, not so exciting. It was a small ball. Like the type you pull off of your necklace clasp, or hair tie. We were only maybe 14, so we threw it onto the street and continued our adventure. Years and years had passed and every once in a while I considered placing an order because I've eaten at every other Chinese food place. One evening I was so hungry I placed an order. I got some type of combo plate and an egg drop soup. No hair. The soup had decent sized pieces of egg whites, I loved it. The chicken fingers, were just chicken fingers. The lo mein though, it had so much grease, I lost my appetite. It was covered in a slimy grease concoction, slimy. I know the food is bad for you, but yikes! Anyway. Another year passed and I found myself in the same starving situation. I ordered again, around closing time and tipped. I opt'd for the rice, but still went for the soup and fingers. I got home and examined some of the food. I ate the chicken fingers, and a few bites of the rice. I remembered I ordered my soup and excitedly opened the container, only to find a black hair. They were nice enough to take back the food and gave me my money, but still.

The email listed below was sent to the owner that my lady emailed and I wanted to wait to see if a response would have been sent back but as of 10/16/17, we have not received an email response at all.   With that being said, we will not be going back to the Grill due to the lack of respect that was shown to us while we were there in addition to not receiving a response from the owner.  Thank you.  \\n\\nPlease read the email below:  \\n\\n\\nTony,\\nI am a long time resident of Westerville and have visited the grill many times. I was in your restaurant yesterday for lunch and had one of the most unprofessional customer service experiences ever. \\nI ordered a sandwich (BLT) which came out absolutely cold. The cheese, which I paid as an \\"up charge,\\" was not even melted. The server inquired how our food was and I informed her that it was cold and showed her the cheese not being melted; I did ask for another cheese at this time, as I ordered cheddar and was given shredded cheese on the sandwich. She apologized and took the sandwich back to the cook window and asked that it be remade. The cook was overheard questioning your server about the re-order in front of other customers for approximately 3 minutes before he took the sandwich from her. The server returned approximately 2 minutes later, apologizing to us and stated \\"I'm sorry...the cook just re-heated your sandwich.\\" \\n\\nI am in management and have been in the food business; this is completely unacceptable on various levels...1) I asked the sandwich be remade, not reheated. This did not happen. 2) When I asked to speak to management, I was told by another server that the manager had \\"switched shifts\\" and that no management was present that could address the concerns; that this particular server had no authority to address anything, hence leaving no one in charge to handle customer issues and 3) leaving a server to argue with a cook, who not only refused to follow customer requests, but was seen/heard by other customers to be completely insubordinate. \\n\\nI was given your manager's name, whom I contacted this morning. \\"Lilly\\" indicated that she would address these concerns with the kitchen manager. She also informed me that I could come back and get the sandwich. Ridiculous. I have no interest in coming back this morning to pick up a sandwich that should have been made correctly yesterday! What I do want to know is: 1) How is this situation being addressed with your cook and 2) How do you plan to address this situation with your customer.\\n\\nI am hoping you can rectify this situation for me.

It is a haven for sci-fi/fantasy/gaming nerds and their friends, they showed Game of Thrones every week, they've got cool tv and movie merch all over their walls and counterspaces, and their food has witty names that tie into various pop culture phenomena that you would find celebrated at Comic-Con. They allow you to come in and play games like Settlers of Catan and Cards Against Humanity for hours whilst enjoying tasty vegan, vegetarian and carnivorous snacks. Queer folks, caped folks, and full-on RPG-costumed folks are welcomed and well represented on any given night. A snapshot: I went in for a drink while waiting for a friend and sat at the bar. I was watching Star Trek TNG on their tv while enjoying my fave beverage, the Storm Crow. An older man was sitting next to me reading a Bill Bryson book. I asked him if he was a 'fan' of anything that people at Storm Crow are generally fans of - say TNG, for example. 'No,' he replied, 'I just came in here one time with a friend and have been coming back ever since. It's such a comfortable atmosphere, everyone is friendly. And where else can you find people dressed in full green body paint head to toe?' He gestured to two women who were, indeed, painted green and in costume.  Cuz that's what you can find on any given evening at Storm Crow. Peeps in costume, or in regular dress that mainstreamers would consider costumes (shout out to my goth homies!), or hipsters, or anyone else that wants to come together in a place where celebrating geek culture is encouraged and rewarded. (Every Sunday they gave away a GoT doll or mug to a customer who had a birthday close to the character selected that evening.)\\n\\nAll that to say, I love it there and am a proud regular. But today, they went up even further in my esteem as I was introduced to their new menu! As a vegan, I've been grateful for the options they've provided so far, and now their options are even greater and more delicious. I sampled their vegan poutine which was totes delish, and look forward to their vegan burger, the 'Elvish Veggie Burger Supreme: Straight out of Appendix XXII of the Silmarillion, this nature-loving sandwich packs roasted corn, black beans, tomatoes and onions in a lentil, rice and chickpea patty, served with salsa verde and sour cream. ' They've also added a vegan cheesecake!

But, indeed the simplicity of the ingredients, arranged in a complex, somewhat fun way re-defined and knocked my expectations out the window into the Portland rain.\\n\\nHighlights: \\n\\nMy friend had a fantastic apertif. Some sort of ginger beer cocktail that was the perfect introduction to the oncoming clean food.\\n\\nThe foie gras was cooked in a way I have never experienced -- carmelized richly on the outside while being juicy and tender on the inside.\\n\\nNothing was overseasoned. Yet, one would say that eating at Castagna would take hypersensitivity to flavors considering the variety of fresh herbs they use and simple tasting reductions. Once my pallet was used to the use of ingredients, I understood the subtlety and was able to truly appreciate the flavors of all the ingredients. Most importantly, the herbs which they grow themselves!\\n\\nAnother highlight was the dessert that was reminiscent of a campfire. Replete with a cube of mango sorbet representing embers, and toasted marshmallows. I loved this whimsical approach to plating the food. \\n\\nThe one negative:\\n\\nI enjoyed the use of ash to give the plates a very unique look, but I wonder about the healthfulness of it. I mean, charcoal and burnt things are well-known carcinogens. If it was activated charcoal then maybe there would be the ability to remove toxins (like in a drug overdoes scenario?). Uncertain about this aspect --to say the least -- and it seems to contradict the freshness of the ingredients. Considering how thoughtful the chefs are, I wouldn't put it past them to make this last association!\\n\\nIn conclusion, I would recommend Castagna as a destination restaurant when visiting Portland. Well worth the money to have such a unique and forward-thinking dining experience."},{"name":"Dinesty Dumpling House","address":"1719 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We came to Dinesty for dim sum after spending the morning kayaking. We showed up on a Saturday just before noon, and it was right before a line started forming - and with no reservations, it probably is a sign that it's best to get there earlier rather than later (although by the time we had left, around 45 minutes later, the line had been alleviated). We ended up only waiting a few minutes before scoring a table near the front...unlike a good number of dim sum spots back on the East Coast, most of the seating is for small parties, so it's unlikely you will end up at one of the large group tables where you share the space. Ordering was quick and efficient, with a picture-filled menu making it easy to figure out what to get. You get your receipt ahead of time, and the items are marked off as they come - a bit in reverse of typical dim sum, where a blank check gets marked up. Tea was served (although refills were not - a bit annoying), and there are local craft beers from Four Winds available as well - certainly a nice touch relative to pretty much any other dim sum restaurant I have been to.\\n\\nThe food itself was very flavorful and quite good, although it did fall short in a couple spots. I really enjoyed the duck leg, which had a very savory flavor and was quite delicious, although it was a little on the dry side, and the portion was a bit smaller than the menu made it appear. Our only main-sized dish was the clams in slightly spicy garlic sauce...it was also very good overall, with the right amount of heat to warm you up but not make you sweat. The wontons in hot and sour sauce was interesting, as it had a bit of the spice from the hot wontons I have had elsewhere, but the vinegar lent a bit of a slightly dissonant, yet complementary, sweetness to each bite. Perhaps the only drawback was that the skin-to-filling ratio was a bit on the high side. The scallion beef wrap had excellent fried dough wrapped around delicious beef...but the center of the wrap is a thick slice of scallion. Why?! More beef and less scallion next time, please...otherwise this would have been my favorite dish here. As for the famed soup dumplings, we stuck with the traditional pork dumplings and were generally pleased - the pork filling was succulent and juicy (sometimes this can be overcooked), and the skin was the perfect thinness. However, there was less soup in the dumpling itself relative to most other soup dumplings I have sampled...kind of defeats the purpose of the name of the dish if it is MIA!\\n\\nThat said, I really did enjoy the meal on balance, and although it was more expensive than the typical dim sum meal, I felt the quality more than made up for the (relative) expense. It's certainly worth a stop if you are looking for quality Chinese food in Vancouver, and I hope to come back in the future next time I am in town!"},{"name":"La Boite Caf√©","address":"1700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Yum, best macaron I've ever had.

You then choose your type of bun - honey wheat, egg roll, or pretzel roll...if you are forgoing carbs you can opt to have it served on a bed of greens. Finally you have your choice of cheese, toppings, and sauce. \\n\\nThey have some more unique cheese, toppings, and sauce choices...about 35 different items to choose from. Some examples: blue cheese, sun dried tomatoes, black bean and corn salsa, and basil pesto mayo. They offer a limited number of side items - fries, sweet potato fries, fried pickles, and salad. \\n\\nWhen we placed our order the cashier commented that they, \\"Just opened a few days ago, so bear with us.\\" Uh oh. \\n\\nWe placed our order without any problem, grabbed our drinks, and a table. There were only three other tables of people seated when we took our seats. My burger and fries arrived in a basket and my husband's burger was brought in a to-go container (even though we were on the same order) - weird. (I noticed other people were also eating out of to-go containers too.) My burger was supposed to have mixed greens, sun-dried tomatoes, and white cheddar cheese with stone ground mustard - however, it arrived without the sun-dried tomatoes and only two pieces of mixed greens. My husband's burger was supposed to have jalape√±os, pickles, and mushrooms - all of which were M.I.A. Not good. \\n\\nThe good news? The taste of the food was good. The burger was juicy and the toppings (the ones that actually made it to the plate) were fresh. The fries tasted like they were fried in peanut oil - yum.\\n\\nThe restaurant was clean and it had a cute modern look. The price for a basic burger is about $5.50, but expect to spend about $8.00 per person for a burger and small fries. \\n\\nUltimately, the food was good enough to bring me back...at least one more time.

It does this pretty effectively.  Some of the staff members look friendly but dangerous, the mood is shadily comfortable or comfortably shady depending on how you look at it.  If you've seen Goodfellas well that's what it feels like.  Unfortunately, if this is what wise guy joint's food generally turns out, it looked a little tastier in the movies.  \\n\\nTo begin with I am not a fan of the \\"Old School\\" style dishes (big sauce, pasta on the over cooked side, signature Americanized Italian dishes that have been around for a long time) so perhaps that's a bit biased.  But even strictly speaking within that style, the sauce is too thin and runny, tomatoes not ripened enough so the red sauce is a bit sour, and the appetizers just okay.  The rolls and the soups are all right.  It's not bad food, but I can't find much that makes this stuff any better than differently themed Maggiano's.

When we got the bill, we were surprised to find that most expensive item was our plate of saut√©ed vegetables ($20). $20 for a plate of veggies? You've got to be kidding me. The other \\"main dishes\\" were also $15+, and the crispy bean curd w/ scallop sauce dish that I got was honestly very hard to eat. The bean curd was incredibly chewy and the sauce was overly salty. To make matters worse, they don't give rice with their dishes. You have to order it in addition; so we ordered a bowl of rice after our initial order, and it took at least 15 minutes to arrive. I'm not trying to be overly picky, but I don't think it should take that much time to scoop rice into a bowl for your customers. Like I said, this place is a dumpling house, but honestly the dumplings also weren't even that good. We got the classic XLB and a veggie dumpling, and while the skins were pretty good (good skin consistency and thickness is often hit and miss with dumpling places), the insides were only so-so.

This is best paired with a bowl of rice. The sauce was very rich, the meat was succulent and savory. In fact, the ox tail meat was falling off the bone! The dish came with a spicy scotch bonnet (a Caribbean hot chili pepper) sauce on the side. Our server had warned us that it was a bit spicy and to use a small amount.

After getting lost in more tunnels and finally seeing the light of day, we landed on Massachusetts Ave in what was probably their version of Chinatown. A short walk in the wrong direction and some helpful street recommendations led us to Dillon's. \\n\\nThe place is a bit trendy with an open building atmosphere and a swanky looking patio area. John the bartender got us rolling with a Lagunitas IPA and some chicken and waffle skewers that were delicious. Could have used some real maple syrup but this ain't a southern joint and we forgave them. However, we then both had the Paddy Mac burger (fried egg, bacon, provolone, etc.) and agreed that it was a sloppy, greasy, but delectable sandwich. The burger hit the spot but the fries were average at best. \\n\\nKudos to John for hooking us up with bar recommendations for the area and for the good burger.

Our Korean friend that invited us to join him for dinner wasn't impressed, either.  The Bi Bim Bap was kind of dry, and even with the spicy sauce seemed to be lacking something.  Perhaps the rice was too dry.  I have had better at sushi joints run by Koreans.  The Jap Chae was probably the best dish we had, with good noodles and nice balanced flavour.  We also had the spare ribs, and a fried rice dish with seafood.  These were good, but the ribs lacked the sweetness they often have.  And the fried dumplings were too oily, though the flavour inside was nice.  Overall, okay food, good service, nothing special.\\n\\nWhat really took this place down a notch for me was when we paid.  They charged 15% tax.  Yeah, you read that right.  Now that we are back to the old PST and GST system only the alcohol can be charged PST, which for some inexplicable reason these folks have decided is 10% not 7.  I'm guessing they skim that extra 3% for themselves.  This is not okay.  The staff member at the front had no idea what I was talking about when I said that PST was not 10%.  He just said that was what management told him was correct.  Well management clearly doesn't know their shit, or they are purposefully skimming an extra 3% off unobservant customers.

It was served with a quarter pickle and a bottle of Russian dressing.  I had to ask for another pickle and I know a lot of folks who would wear the waitress out getting a quarter of a pickle at a time.  And oh, the pickles  were Clausen-type pickles, not the kind that come out of the barrel.\\n\\nParking was a bitch!  I had to park over a block away and feed the meter.  I'm sure the folks that have to walk to the deli only do so when the weather is good.  Thus I knocked off a star because of the location.

No meat and cheese case, for example and no dessert case, no canned or bottle condiments, no bread case.\\n\\nI'd say their pastrami is on par with Katzinger's.  And ditto for the bread.

Our server was the only good part about this experience. I ordered the bar harbor bake, witch I get every time I go. My husband ordered the create your own. When our food came out our food was cold as can be and my seafood wasn't cooked. The only thing warm was his steak. We notified our server and she asked if there was anything I would want to eat and I asked for coconut shrimp. The manager came out to ask us what was going on without introducing herself. My husband stated how the food was cold and the steak was more rare than medium, and how he thinks maybe they messed up on the steak and had to recook it, being the only explanation on why it was the only warm item. She rudely question him on how it was supposed to be cooked. In the end result none of my husband food issues were resolved nor did anyone ask what they could do for him. When I told her how my seafood wasn't cooked she didn't bother looking at it nor did she apologize. she stated that she was the head of house manager and she would notify the cook manager and have that manager come speak to us. She went to the kitchen to retrieve my food and brought it out to me. The food was warm this time but I had lost my appetite. The manager never came back to check on us. As we were leaving I asked the hostess if I could speak to the cook manager and she informed me that the cook manager was not working today. When I told my husband that we had been lied to about the other manager working he decided to call. He talked to the same manager that had talked to us earlier and asked why she never came back to check on us and he felt that it was bad costumer service. She said with an attitude that if we were not happy with the way she handled things that we could call back on Saturday and speak to her GM. She then said have a nice day goodbye and hung up before he could say anything else. For $52 I expected a better experience. I used to work at red lobster and I don't ever remember anyone having this experience. I also have worked the the GM Aaron and I know he would not like his restaurant ran this way.

There was only one guy working and he did the order taking and cooking which made for a 20min wait for my food once I ordered.  Unlike other food carts that call your name when your food is ready or even walk over to your table to deliver it to you, this lone worker at Ruby Dragon could not do the same.  Thus, I had to check in every 5 min to see if my food was ready.  The third time I checked back, it was, but my food was now lukewarm. :(\\n\\nBoth dishes were quite mediocre.  I could honestly make them myself without much trouble.  The quinoa pancakes were kind of interesting because the quinoa provided a unique texture to the pancake, but the scramble was pretty basic.  I needed Sriracha and Ruby Dragon didn't have it!  I had to steal some from a neighboring cart.  I wouldn't go back--there are just too many superior vegan joints in Portland (i.e., Portobello in Hosford-Abernathy)."},{"name":"Hot Pot Buffet","address":"70 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Before I start, I really must come clean. For quite some time I did NOT like this place at all. I'm forever SUPER skeptical of AYCE options especially when it comes to hot pot. In short, you're basically sacrificing quality for quantity and that doesn't always translate well when you're looking for premium quality meats which remain the main focus of any hot pot meal.\\n\\nHowever, after tonight I can safely say that this place rates a good three stars in my book. For those in groups looking to catch up over a ridiculous amount of food for a set price, Hot Pot Buffet isn't all that bad of an option. Some people make remarks about the service but remember it's Chinatown that we're dealing with. You just gotta be a little more aggressive and you'll find the waitstaff to actually be pretty attentive! Keep in mind its hot pot & they probably have to run around everywhere getting sauces, garnishes, water, broth, and more of everything! \\n\\nAs far as food goes, just keep in mind a few tips & you should be good to go! \\n\\n-They serve both front & back beef tongue and from what I hear the front is tastier.. But in general since beef tongue really isn't supposed to be cooked for too long & the meat quality isn't quite up to those standards here, I'd recommend going to Shabu Zen for your RBT fix. \\n\\n-Beef is really just so so. Quality is what you'll get for AYCE in Chinatown but in my opinion, the tastiest option for beef is the fattiest (texture is way better). Just ask your server which of the three beefs is the most fatty & go to town with that one. \\n\\n-Seafood is dismissive. I know you wanna get the most out of the price but I'd recommend ordering their seafood in smaller portions & just loading up on all the unlimited veggies/mushrooms/noodles/ etc & fatty beef you can get your hands on and you should be a pretty happy camper. \\n\\nDrink menu is extremely limited. They didn't even have Asahi! Booo but guess we can't all be winners there.\\n\\nFor 4 people, the bill came to be around $110 (before tip) for dinner and a few drinks.  We ate a truckload of food so it was definitely worth it! This will never be my top choice to cure a hot pot craving but I'm happy to say this place really isn't half bad if you know what you're getting into."},{"name":"Sushi Katana","address":"4192 Conroy Rd, Ste 103","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"While vacationing in orlando and we had a craving for sushi, so we looked on yelp and found sushi katana nearby.

First and last visit.\\n\\nOn arrival it looked promising. Nice decor, live saxophone, lots of people, etc. The menu looked great too. \\n\\nShort story:  I've never experienced such a disorganized restaurant in my life and I'm sneaking up on 50 years-old.\\n\\nThe rest of the story:  We were a group of 20 and had a reservation. This was Sunday brunch and a Falcons game for a bunch of classmates from high school. They held us for a bit because we didn't all arrive together, that's completely understandable. Once we were seated a server passed out menus and skipped a few people; no big deal we shared. After being seated for about 10-15 minutes someone came to take drink orders. Drinks finally arrived for most of us but not for some, that's a problem. Thankfully baskets of bread were brought out; we had been there almost an hour at this point. Another 15-20 minutes for the food orders to be taken. About 45 minutes and no food. Wife asked for an explanation, server said he was tending bar and covering the section because they were short handed and had a bunch of walk-ins in addition to the large groups. Our group was spread out over four tables so people were moving around to visit with one another.  After another 10-15 minutes some food comes out and was placed at vacant seats, turns out it wasn't their food and I'm convinced it wasn't anything our group had ordered; there was another large party in the adjoining room. But the staff didn't stick around to sort it out and just left the food. So one of our classmates started holding up plates and asking us to figure out who ordered the food. Well, there's only so many things on a brunch menu and it sounded about right so some of us took what we could get since we were hungry. Remember this was our first visit and we weren't familiar with the dishes. \\n\\nAnd the downhill slide continued. When the food we ordered finally arrived, most of the orders were wrong in some way. Steaks not cooked to order, wrong side dishes (I never did get the home fries I ordered), had to ask for refills and remind staff of beverages ordered but not delivered. Two people simply didn't get food; one asked the server to just bring her \\"something\\" from the kitchen because she just needed to eat, she was given some luke warm fried shrimp.\\n\\nOur table asked to see the manager, a man in a suit showed up and listened. He apologized but it did not seem sincere. He did comp all the meals at the table and offered gift cards but we declined the gift cards as none of us have any desire to eat there again. I appreciate that he tried to make it right but these problems indicate organizational disfunction. This wasn't a hiccup on one or two things and it just didn't seem to stop.\\n\\nJust before we left a female staff member (maybe a manager) came by the table to ask if we had settled our checks. I told her our meals had been comp'd because the whole experience was hosed up. She then explained that she was trying to track down another guest's credit card that was missing. Everyone at our table agreed to leave before the staff lost us or something happened to our vehicles with the valet. \\n\\nThe food was okay. I had crab cakes benedict, they would have been better if they been served hot instead of warm (the plate was cold, I'm sure that didn't help). My wife had shrimp & grits and a house said, only five shrimp. The shrimp were decent sized but it was still shy on protein for an entree. She was hungry less than hour later. \\n\\nThat night we ate at Zesto on Piedmont and even with a homeless man complaining about the staff throwing away the food he'd abandoned and calling them bimbos, it was a better dining experience than Sage."},{"name":"Antique Table","address":"2 Essex St","city":"Lynn","stars":"4","text":"Cozy, yummy home cooked Italian food with incredibly good looking servers- what more could you ask for?

Next, we ordered a 19 dollar plate of seafood paella.  Rice was burnt on the bottom of the pan, and again, the portions barely fed two people.  My friends ordered a few dishes of their own.  By the time it was all said and done, we'd gone well over 120 dollars worth of food, and I wasn't anywhere close to feeling full.  \\n\\nThe wine list was pretty decent, but the beer selection was pitiful, with only one draft beer selection on tap, and only a couple bottled selections.\\n\\nNot worth a repeat visit."},{"name":"Arepazo Tapas & Wine","address":"93 N High St","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been wanting to try out Arepazo for the longggggest time.

We should have had our food and been done in that about of time. We will never go back to this place which makes me sad.

Immediately erring on the side of caution, I got the Taipei potstickers, figuring that it would be harder to mess up something fried than something steamed.

We had the egg white dried scallop fried rice which was not bad, certainly not the best. The Chinese green onion fried pancakes were pretty delicious and it's the thin type, just the way I like it. Although I have to admit it was a little too oily. \\n\\nI rarely if ever say this but please \\"pass\\", on the chili oil wontons here, I am not sure what they were thinking when they created that one. Sounds harsh, but it should not be on the menu. I'd rather have tried something else and this dish wasted my quota.  \\n\\nThere are a number of different xioalongbao (XLB) on the menu, but I order the traditional one to benchmark it against the many other places I'd been to in Asia and North America. The XLB, surprisingly, were a bit of a let down. I was expecting juicy, flavor gushing soupy goodness with a moist piping-hot center. I got the piping hot center...the flavor was meh. I definitely missed the \\"wow\\" on this one. I might come back to try the other styles, maybe those will fair better than my experience with the classic, which I think should be a signature dish for a restaurant that devotes a large portion of the menu to XLB.\\n\\nIf I do come back, I'll have to try the dandan noodles as well."},{"name":"El Oriental De Cuba","address":"416 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"Spectacular Cuban restaurant with delicious food and many options on the menu.

Unfortunately, the quality was not great. The sauce was gloppy and sort of congealed, although the tofu was nicely crispy and the flavor wasn't bad.

Everything was cooked perfectly, the bok choy and risotto complementing and not overwhelming the fish. The presentation was lovely, though my only complaint was that the bok choy being served in the large chunks was a bit difficult to eat. I wonder if they could have achieved the same visual appeal with the bok choy cut into quarters rather than halves. This, however, is a minor technical point that did not detract from a thoroughly enjoyable dish. \\n\\nThe person I was with ordered the citrus salmon served with fresh greens and potatoes.

I'd expect to see some murals or artwork put up on their largest wall, but the direction they are headed is clear: modern American classic.  It's not like anything Medford Square has now, and it's a great addition.  With the exception of Salvatore's down the street, there's no where else I would take my parents when they come to visit.

As much as I enjoyed making eye-contact with the curious bus-riders, I would expect to see some low curtains put up.)  \\n\\nThe cocktail menu is cute; every drink is a reference to a Medford history, with nods to both Tufts and Grandmother's House.  My boyfriend got the steak tips; we don't know what the sauce was (maybe in the future Carroll's will add some more descriptions to their menu), but it was good.  There was a snafu with my raw bar order, which our waitress fixed as soon as she could, and my sampler was a tasty mix, although I would have enjoyed additional fixings aside from cocktail sauce (a lemon wedge or some horseradish?).  \\n\\nCarroll's has everything it needs to be come a great fixture in the Medford area, and if it was this well put-together on its second night, I think Yelp readers of the future can expect good things.\\n\\nBut, finally, for the love of your mother, BE CAREFUL crossing Main Street.

I don't drink coffee, so I can't comment on their coffee drinks. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is very open. I feel like I can have a quiet conversation here and no one will care, but I can also come here to get work done, if necessary. The upstairs seems to be a quieter spot to allow for more focused working while the downstairs lounge and bar offers a better setting for conversation. \\n\\nYou order at the counter in the back and pick up your drinks at the bar in the center.

They rarely appear to be busy (I've been at least 5 times in the last few years), but they're still in business.  In fact, we had Christmas dinner at Ginza last year.  \\n\\nI always go to the hibachi, as I'm not one for raw, uncooked meat - but, to each their own.  The hibachi table is set up in a C shape - with 2 hibachi grills on either side - seating is around 16 per table, I believe.  \\n\\nThe dinner hibachi special of steak, chicken and shrimp (I pass on the shrimp - shellfish allergy) is hard to beat for the price.  I almost always supplement that with a Sapporo beer.  Service has never exactly been Ginza's strong suit, but it hasn't been awful either.  \\n\\nThe hibachi dinner is served in 3 courses.  The salad, clear soup, and then main course of your choice.  \\n\\nThe portion size of the main course has always been way too much for my stomach to handle in one sitting.  The special I believe is priced around $12-13, which basically gives you 2 meals.  $6 for a meal that isn't processed, microwaved, or sitting under a heat lamp is a pretty good deal if you ask me.  With the meal, you are given 3 different sauce types, the white \\"yummy\\" sauce, the duck sauce, and I believe there's a teryaki sauce as well.  I almost always get double white sauce because I really enjoy the flavor it adds to the meal. \\n\\nYou get the meat, as well as noodles, fried rice (ask for steamed rice if you would like it), veggies, and a show along with it.  The \\"show\\" lacks the fun aspect, and that goes back again to the service issue.  The hibachi restaurants with chefs who appear to be really into the performance makes the meal that much more enjoyable - but to a seasoned (no pun intended) hibachi eater, the food is paramount, and they do a fine job with preparing the meat to your preference.   \\n\\n\\nAll in all, I'll certainly return, because I have yet to find a better value for the price in a hibachi dinner in town - but it'd be nice if their service quality improved a little."},{"name":"J.

I came to Orlando for a conference and was initially worried as the temperature was over 95 deg and I'd be stuck in a hotel for 3 full days. This 'problem' turned out to be more of a blessing in disguise as Hyatt Regency offered excellent customer support, flexible check-ins and outs, great free amenities (internet, 24/7 gym and massive pools) as well as well-stocked rooms. Before I go on, the bathroom mirror has a TV screen! That is ridiculous. Whenever I called the front desk for anything, I was greeted with a gentle knock on the door in less than 10 minutes (and I did bother them a great deal, from shaving cream to floss to more coffee and tea). The gym is absolutely crazy! There is a fully equipped weight room, a dedicated aerobics/treadmill/elliptical center, with a dedicated spin room, yoga room and salon. The outdoor pool is pretty epic as well, although it would have been nicer if the depth was a little deeper, but there's also an Olympic sized pool as well if you don' want to just soak outside in the sun. My one complaint was when I came back into the room after a long day of conference, I noticed that the house cleaners had taken/thrown away my large container of trail mix that I had saved for breakfast. When I brought this up with the front desk, they kindly offered me to buy any breakfast items from their affiliated snacks without charge, but I was too moved to be upset. \\n\\nOverall, for the amount I've paid in the past for hotel fees at conferences, Hyatt Regency offered more amenities and compassion than any place I've ever visited in the US.

I had the entertainment of watching the cooks prepare dumplings in the meantime. They have really transformed the interior of the space with nice bench seating along the inner wall then round tables in the middle. The wall of teapots is really a lovely touch.\\n\\nI liked the flavour of the kimchi & pork steamed dumplings but found the ones with shrimp & melon a bit on the bland side. We also ordered the su chow style fried fish, which is like candied salmon--ok but I probably won't get it again. The deep fried chicken rolled around ham and asparagus was delicious and reminded me of chicken karaage with mayo to dip on the side. Lastly we had the Shanghai fried noodles which were not greasy and tasting strongly of soya sauce...not a favourite for me but there was a nice amount of greens fried in and there was nothing wrong with it at all.\\n\\nI think it would be really fun to come with a larger group (we were 3 today) and go crazy ordering steamers of dumplings as well as the potstickers and noodle soups.

While the service was excellent & the quality of the food was great their portion sizes have decreased to the extent that it is no longer a value. We were a group of 4 people -our bill was $250 and we left the restaurant slightly hungry.\\nThe charcuterie plate, my favorite dish, has been reduced to such a sad portion size & variety that it is definitely not worth the $17 price tag. Once upon a time you could be assured of getting 5 or 6 different types of house made sausages, an assortment of 3-5 kinds of pickled vegetables and a couple of nice cheese wedges. Although the cheese portion was roughly the same as before we only received 4 kinds of sausage and of those there were only 4  translucent, paper thin slices. The pickled vegetables were a joke- 3 slices of cucumber & 1/2 a small tomato. The only thing they increased was an additional slice of lardo, I assume to make up for the fact that they're cheating on the other portions. There is actually a picture of what the charcuterie plate used to look like on this site. Sad to say that it just isn't worth the $$ anymore.\\nMy husband ordered the Lamb Mezza which consisted of a small poorly constructed stuffed grape leaf, a small lamb meatball and an octopus tentacle.

I got shredded pork, shredded chicken, fresh salsa, and shredded cheese along with Mexican rice and black beans. The pork and chicken were tender and juicy. The Mexican rice was light and perfectly flavored. My second trip involved a drizzling of some of their house made hot sauce onto my rice and juicy shredded chicken: they weren't joking with the heat level. Luckily I had some delicious black beans to neutralize my palette. The buffet desserts consisted of fresh watermelon, cinnamon sugar dusted apple dumplings and small shortbread looking cookies.

I believe there was a larger party inside. Other than that the restaurant was pretty empty, which says a lot because the patios in other views were all packed.  \\nThe patio was smaller, but they still had a TV outside that the Falcons game was being aired on. \\nWe decided to start our date night off with yellowtail sashimi ($9) and fried rice ($11) as appetizers.  My husband is not a huge fan of sushi, so the fried rice was a backup filler food. The yellowtail was as expected.  The fried rice? Possibly one of the worst dishes I have ever had.  I never knew messing up fried rice was even a thing, but \\"The One\\" sure was able to do that.  I took two bites, my husband took maybe 4.  The bowl sat full on our table until the bitter end.  The fried rice lacked flavor and was overly salty (I LOVE salt... so for me to say that it's huge). \\nOur sushi rolls came out and that was the saving grace of the meal.  My husband got The Picante ($14) and I got The Haven ($11) and both of those were great and well worth it. The server made sure to tell us that the sauce on the side completes both of the dishes and she was definitely correct.  \\nThe One did a great job on keeping my water glass filled (I'm pretty sure that I drank two full glasses due to the fried rice alone).  But the two stars were due to my huge disappointment in not asking if the rice was okay throughout the 45 minutes it was on our table as a full dish. Between our server, the gentleman who refilled the water, the person who brought our food and the man (who I'm guessing) was the manager around us while eating, it just was shocking nobody even noticed, or cared to notice. \\nWe might return, but if we do, we'll be sticking to the sushi rolls. If I had to guess, we'll likely spend our time and money trying out other sushi places in the city."},{"name":"Whitewood Mediterranean Grill","address":"1 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"A much needed addition to the downtown lunch scene.

Kinda bent repeatedly when trying to take a bit of falafel.  Also, no whole wheat pita as an option (should be for a placed billed with healthier food).  But these are small tweaks for a new place that is otherwise solid, and wasn't enough for me to dock it a star.\\n\\nMy bias:  I'm a vegetarian, and vegetarian lunch options are few and far between in this town.

I use to work at one called Liberty Pizza in Marietta and I love their pizza! But anyway, order a slice of cheese pizza at 1:17am by Austin who stated it will take 25 minutes. Not going to lie I assumed they already had slices prepared as most pizza spots who sell slices do. However I did not read so.. at that point I understood y the pizza would take 25 minutes as they claim they make all pizzas even slices fresh to order. No worries. But at this point it did not take 25 minutes.. Austin came by to give me my slice of pizza at literally 1:58am . WHY WOULD IT EVER TAKE 40 MINUTES FOR A SLICE OF CHEESE! That's the basics of pizza!!! Didn't make it any better that the bartender was legit smoking a cigarette as she worked behind the bar.. as I had to smell it all as I waited almost an hour for a slice. She didn't even used a ash try. She used one of plates they give customers ! So unsanitary. The pizza was definitely hot but also extremely greasy! You can tell the oven needs cleaning because the bottom of the pizza was filthy and burnt. Again, I worked at a Mom&Pops pizza place so I know the difference in a clean brick oven and not clean one..

The rice pilaf was just plain old, boring, white rice.  This would be fine if the dish was eight dollars, but since it was sixteen, I feel the pricing was way off.  Everyone else seemed to not mind their food, no one really said anything was good.  Tried some hummus and pita, both seemed like they were bought from a store with the bread being kind of stale.

For as many cafes Portland has, the number that stay open past 6pm and few and far between. With the exception Palio and Southeast Grind (not my favorite) I can't think of another late night coffee shop inner east side. \\n\\nThe ambience: Though small on the outside, Palio is surprisingly large on the inside. They offer various different seating options: tables next to large windows, and upper section with soft seats surrounded by bookcases, and a backroom with very large tables and banker lamps along the tables (a perfect area to study alone or with friends). You shouldn't ever have trouble finding seating here, regardless of your group size. This also has to be one of the best cafes for people watching, sitting right at the very center of ladd's addition and having gigantic windows spread throughout you see everyone that goes by. It is relatively quiet, but a bit of chit chat wouldn't get you scolded.\\n\\nThe food and service: Honestly, nothing about the coffee or food really blows me away, it is by no means bad, but in a town with so many roasters and coffee shops it is hard to stand out in the coffee you serve. This being said, the coffee is normally priced and is pleasant to drink. Palio also offers a pretty wide selection of baked goods, so you can be sure to find something for everyone to eat. The staff are friendly and there are patrons of every sort. One final thing I like is that Palio has a punch card for coffee, something that I don't see too much in Portland. Not that it is a big deal paying two bucks for a coffee, but having that punch card just gives you an excuse to go back, it is something I wish more cafes in Portland would have."},{"name":"Smallwares","address":"4605 NE Fremont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great little spot in a neighborhood that needs a shake up.

Shortly afterward, my number was called.  I sat down with the family and thoroughly enjoyed the warm wrap filled with grilled chicken, pepper jack, black bean & corn salsa, grilled onions, lettuce & creamy adobo.

The ambiance is light and comforting in their new location. The service is always on point...my favorite server is Alex. He is super knowledgeable about the menu and honest about what to order, without being overbearing. Even when Alex isn't our waiter, he always comes over to our table to greet us with a handshake and see what we ordered.\\n\\nAs for the food, the menu changes frequently since they source fresh ingredients. However, there are a few mainstays that remain (i.e. The gruyere biscuits, the tacos, shrimp and grits, burger, steak frites, mahi sandwich, farmer salad, gatherer salad, and some version of deviled eggs). I have tried it all at one point or another. Of these, I recommend the deviled eggs, the mahi sandwich, and the steak frites. I know steak frites is cliche but seriously, they do it right. Best ordered medium rare, it has a sort of coffee crust and has a depth of flavor profiles. They give you a generous portion of frites and boy are they addicting! It is seriously hard not to order this every time, but there is usually something new on the rotating menu that catches my eye. Note: you can add steak to any salad for a very reasonable up-charge.\\n\\nSome dishes that have stuck out over the years from the rotating part are: their pumpkin soup, French dip sandwich, butterscotch panna cotta, and literally anything with heirloom tomatoes.

There is a reason why oysters do not normally come with fish sauce. It was way too salty! Usually it's already salty from the sea water/oyster juices...\\n\\nFried kale, candied bacon, fish sauce, mint: This one was surprisingly good, probably the best dish we had here. It had a good balance of everything, and the kale was deep fried perfectly.\\n\\nSnapper ceviche: nothing too crazy, wouldn't order it again.\\n\\nLobster mushrooms: I had seen these at a farmers market earlier in the day, and was interested in trying them. I'm not too sure how they are supposed to taste, but it was harder than a normal mushroom and didn't have much flavor.\\n\\nCrab egg drop soup: My friend, who is not a fan of spicy food, thought this was a mild dish she could handle, because egg drop soup is nothing too fancy...however these also had cherry peppers in them. Little did we know that they are actually pretty spicy!

We arrived about 2:00 on a Saturday and it was 90% empty. \\n\\nAfter a tour of their lunch buffet and a quick glance at the menu, we all opted for the $11 buffet - our time constraints also pushed us in this direction. Good options from chips and queso to chicken fajitas and even a couple of sweet items for dessert. It wasn't bad but it wasn't special. \\n\\nAs we plugged in our next destination into the gps, it took us in a different direction from how we arrived at El Patron. It was then I realized exactly where we were. The back end of Disney which translates to tourist central. That also translates to overpriced mediocre food which is what we ate. The buffet would have been a little better at around the $9 price point but based on location, it all made sense. \\n\\nEl Patron filled our need but I wouldn't come back given so many other options in the city.

There is such a wide array of salsas to choose from, as well. They are all so fresh and varied in flavor, so you aren't just choosing a salsa based on heat, but choosing one based on flavor. I highly recommend trying the chips and queso, too. The chips are light and crispy. They pair well with the creaminess of the queso and the varied flavors of the salsas. Now I want a taco after writing this.

It was a good run.\\n\\nIn agreement with other reviews: friendly and attentive staff (+), bad music (-), way slower service (-), price increases (-), fries now included with burgers (+).\\n\\nAnd now, the heartbreak;\\nHonestly, in 9 years of going to Dot's,  I mainly ate one thing: the Vegan Deluxe. Sauteed mushrooms, wilted spinach, tomatoes and hummus, grilled on dark rye. Sounds simple, but somehow the flavors came together in a CRAZY way. Also, a truly unique sandwich I have never seen anywhere else. The new, greatly reduced and lackluster (in appearance) menu has a lot of the the same items, but then you see red flags. In the case of the \\"Vegan Deluxe\\", it is now the \\"Vegan Delux\\". The new version is tomatoes, wilted spinach, hummus, sauteed OYSTER mushrooms on grilled MULTIGRAIN. Ok, minor changes. But there are implications here. The flavors do NOT come together. The changes seem arbitrary. Change the bread, why? This concerns me about A) the palette of the new owners--do they think the new version actually added something to the flavor profile B) the intentions of the new owners--I mean are they trying to make it \\"theirs\\" or are they trying to make it \\"relevant\\" by adding higher end ingredients? Either way, I have eaten the the original Vegan Deluxe maybe 50 or so times in the past 9 years. My fellow diner and I agreed that neither one of us would order the new Vegan Delux ever again, and therefore would probably not go back to the \\"New\\" Dot's.  \\n\\nThis is not to lessen the revolutionary act of offering fries at no additional charge.

The service was top notch and that is something that you don't usually get in an Indian restaurant. The staff was really great and that was probably what impressed me the most about Vij's. They know how to serve. They introduced each entree as it was presented to the table... they included the right breads and rices that need to be included when ordering entrees, they were so good with explaining things on the menu, accommodating a large group, and on and on. The staff really was above and beyond.\\n\\nWhile the service was an amazing surprise, my feeling is that he entire experience including the food, just isn't catered to the Indian crowd. This is obviously working for Vij's, because the restaurant was jam packed on a weekday night and we had to split our party of 8 into two parties of 4. That worked out just fine, because then there really wasn't a wait. Coming back to the point about service and setting things up \\"right\\". I mean, some places will bring your papad to munch on. They brought out complimentary lentil croquettes, chai, and also one other item. That was pretty unique and a pleasant surprise.\\n\\nThe entrees themselves were decent, but just not great. The jack fruit appetizer was probably missing a bit of the right kick/flavor. It was decent, but I'm also comparing to this super-high level of expectations that I had coming in to Vij's and also just another place or two that I've eaten in Canada. The eggplant appetizer was actually really good. Kinda of cool with the crispy onion rings on top. Both of these are served more like curries than appetizers, which is an interesting choice. So they come with naan for the table, and so forth as well.\\n\\nFor entrees, the layered paneer was pretty good. It had this smoky taste to it, which I always love. The other thing we ordered was the kofta, which were decent. Lastly, we ordered some saag paneer which comes with a combo with daal makhani. So that's another thing that was unique, because daal makhani isn't separately on the menu. Again, I loved how the parathas and makki ki roti are automatically paired and brought out with the food.\\n\\nFinally, for dessert, the mano kulfi was just OK. When kulfi is done just right, it's not supposed to be as icy. The layer of pistachios added to the top of the kulfi was great. It was a great touch, which makes it taste a lot better, although I'm always skeptical of having any kind of nuts in my dessert.\\n\\nThe end, and probably the part which really gets me is that for the four of us, the bill end up being $200 CAD. That includes tip. It's quite high. Of course you're paying for the service, and in that sense, you get what you pay for. If you have the right expectation coming in, I think Vij's can be great. Anyway, I'm glad we tried Vij's out. Given its legendary status, it was a destination in itself while visiting Vancouver. Thanks in the end."},{"name":"Dillon's","address":"955 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Wow.

She said the flavor was OK, but Holy Hell was it a mess. The bread was inside out. It was like a hoagie roll split lengthwise, then they put the bottom slice on the top of the sandwich and the top slice on the bottom of the sandwich. It looked ok at first glance, but because the crust was on the inside, all the insides kept falling. Apparently this what Blimpies does. I expected better of Dillons.\\n\\nFinally, the service was interminably slow.

In fact that, combined with the fact that it might turn some people on to the joy of dim sum who might not otherwise find out about it, is the only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one. \\n\\nAs Jennifer put it so succinctly, it is fast food dim sum. They didn't ring up everything we marked on the card or bring everything we paid for (until we brought it to their attention) and they didn't even offer to bring the missing things that they hadn't rung up - presumably because we hadn't paid for them. Not saying they should have given us free food, but an apology and an offer to bring (and charge us for) the additional items would've gone a long way. \\n\\nThe gai lon was limp and cool and even some of the siu mai was still cold in the middle. I'm sure the food was all made fresh, just probably not the same day. I was pretty surprised they didn't have chicken feet. \\n\\nAnyway, yeah. Not my favorite dim sum. I will continue going to Chinatown on weekends and Fortune (where Kim Son used to be). I just found that today and in my opinion it's miles above Kim Son (and of course Get Sum Dim Sum). \\n\\nIf anyone with influence is reading this, please convince chef Chan to open a REAL dim sum restaurant in North Austin! :D"},{"name":"StackHouse Burger Bar","address":"1224 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I like this place.

Needless to say, we will not return.   Our server, Stevie and the rest of the serving/manager staff were great.   However, the owner (Annie) was a different story.   My husband's steak was cooked well vs. medium and my scalloped potato casserole was served cold. They cooked another steak for my husband perfectly.   As I stalled waiting for the casserole to be heated, the rest of my food got cold.   When the owner saw the concern on my face, she didn't come over to the table, but she stood a distance away behind a low wall that separated the dining area from the entrance and asked what did I need.   She checked on the potatoes and again stood behind the wall and said the potatoes are still being warmed.   She could tell that her response disappointed me, and all she did was shrug her shoulders and say that's all we can do.   What a nice customer service...glad you came...hope you come back response...NOT.   I finally received a warmed casserole after my husband had finished his meal.  The owner never came by our table to ask how things turned out or apologize for the inconvenience.   When we first arrived and didn't see any people of color dining in the restaurant or as a part of the serving staff, we wondered if it would be a good experience.  Since she was reluctant to come to our table and stand near us during our not so enjoyable experience, we can only assume there is some type of prejudice associated with how she treats her guests.   I called the restaurant a few days after our experience and spoke with the GM (he was there the night we had dinner but left before the problems began).  He apologized and said he understood our concerns.   He also mentioned that he would speak with the owner about our concerns and gain an understanding of why she behaved the way she did.  He wanted us to try them again and asked for my phone number and email so he could contact me after sharing our concerns with the owner.   He said he was \\"so upset\\" about our experience, but it is July 14 and he has not phoned or emailed me.

Why 4 stars instead of 3?  The management is great to work with in terms of having fundraisers for charity events, and the food there isn't bad at all.\\n\\nYou may be surprised, but this place is great for fundraisers and private events.

The establishment itself is consistently busy, it is located in a central part of Boston that is easy to get to and from, and management is willing to work with groups for charity fundraisers.  \\n\\nThe building itself is very intriguing as it used to house an old fire and police station before being converted in to restaurant space.  The street level area has a rather large bar with a few high-top tables.  During the summer, the front windows open up and provides some people-watching opportunities.  There is a small patio adjacent to the restaurant, but it is not great for people-watching and is very noisy as cars speed below on the pike.  Once in the restaurant, you can walk \\"downstairs\\" where there are more dining tables, several lounge couches and another bar.  \\n\\nTo be honest, the service is (not surprising) status quo for the area.  Don't be an ass and you won't be treated like one.  During the winter, I can never understand why people would wait in the blistering cold outside of the restaurant to get in considering how many other options there are in the area, but this place does bring in a large crowd.  As stated before, it's an okay place and not something that will certainly knock your socks off.  \\n\\nFor pub food, this place is completely reasonable and the food is delicious.  It's more than just burgers and fries.  Even for lunch, they offer an ample entree selection while most of the menu is weighted towards sandwiches and salads.

We were actually on our way to The 99 for steaks, but we made a note to try Cathay Pacific sometime soon. As it happened, after a lazy Sunday at home, we decided to try it for dinner that very evening. \\n\\nWe had already dropped off the Zipcar, so this place is a bit of a hike on foot from the North Quincy T station. But it was a lovely late afternoon, and about 15 minutes of slow walking got us there. What we weren't expecting was that when we got there, the place was absolutely packed to the rafters, mostly with families, many of them dressed up. I couldn't figure out why is was so slammed at only 5:45 PM on a Sunday. I thought maybe it was booked up for a wedding. We put in our name for a table for two and waited our turn for about 20 minutes. It took me almost as long to remember why it was so busy -- it was Mother's Day. \\n\\nThe decor is like stepping into the past, to the Rat Pack era or so. It reminded me of the old Sahara Casino in Las Vegas except more Chinese-y. Service was brisk and something short of gracious at the hostess stand, but they were up to their eyeballs in customers so I can let that slide. \\n\\nOld school Chinese-American food makes me dance in my chair when I can get it. This place is so old school that they don't even give you chopsticks -- our places were set with western silverware only. It's been a decade or more since I've had Chicago-style chow mein, so I had to order it. All of your grandparents' \\"Oriental\\" favorites are there too, like egg foo yong, chop suey...they've got it all. My boyfriend is the king of General Gao's Chicken, so I wasn't surprised by his choice.  The drinks, too, are straight out of history: Mai Tai, Suffering Bastard, Fog Cutter, and of course Scorpion Bowls.  The menu text must not have changed since 1968. (\\"Try the NEW sensation! FROZEN strawberry DAIQUIRI!\\") I had the non-alcoholic fruit punch which came with a big fruit skewer, and he got an Old Fashioned. \\n\\nIt tasted like childhood!  My Chicago-style was just like I remember it, all mung bean sprouts and onions and mushrooms and water chestnuts, all in a brown sauce. It came with the kind of crispy noodles that I thought were extinct. Apparently the General's was good too, though I won't taste anything that sweet.  Rolls and butter, tea, fortune cookies and pineapple chunks all showed up. Oh, and very good Peking Ravioli. Portions were giant. We would have been fine sharing one app and one entree. \\n\\nWe had a great time and would definitely go back. The people on Yelp who hated it most were the ones expecting cuisine.

Also, I feel like the way people reviewed this place and also the description on the disney website is inaccurate so I wanted to clarify a few things. First of all, this place is described as fancy and it is recommended to wear more formal attire.. THIS IS NOT NECESSARY.. the restaurant looks like your eating at a cabin and I swear some of the patrons were straight wearing crocs. Feel free to dress as comfortably as you want because I dont think it matters. Just in case I packed heels and wore them here and found it to be completely unnecessary and felt overdressed. Maybe it just depends on where you are from... but were from L.A and didnt find anything fancy about this place at all. Anyway just a note.. no need to overdress, this place is NOT fancy. Also the overall feel of the restaurant was just casual as well.. people mentioned how beautiful the restaurant's art was so I really thought it was going to be like Picasso in Vegas or something similar to that.. but I swear it looks like your in a cabin with a few large paintings that are hardly noticeable. Again nothing fancy about it.\\n\\nOn to the meal: Don't get too excited about eating here.. the food was just OK. First of the bread basket is just whatever, save the calories and skip the bread. The mushroom soup was good, not EXCELLLLENT like people keep raving about but just good. Got the salmon which was good, not great as well, but there was also this eggroll /taquito thing on there that didnt match.. it was kinda strange. hubs got the truffle pasta which was ok too but it had figs in it which didnt match. Dessert we got the creme brulee which was way to thick and heavy for a creme brulee. Idk my husband and i were talking about it and maybe we have just been to too many truly great restaurants that were REALLY amazing, but everything here was just ok. \\n\\nTakeaways: nothing fancy about this place so no need to worry, food will just be ok, ambience ok.. Overall A-OK but just really need more accurate reviews so I don't go in expecting something luxurious and instead find myself dining in like a camp mess hall."},{"name":"Jamaica Mi Krazy","address":"2517 Spring Rd SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3","text":"Got some takeout from there yesterday afternoon and the place wasn't too busy.

Keep in mind that they charge a $25 resort fee for services you'll probably never use and $22-$32 to park per day in a hotel you are paying to stay in. I don't mind the parking fee so much but it certainly adds up. That's an additional $50 per day for both fees! Anyways, there is a Starbucks and an Ice Cream shop as well as a few restaurants and a huge bar located in the center of the atrium. I've stayed here a few times and mainly because of the pool which is GREAT! Very large pool, two large spa's, and a pretty big sun area for tanning. There are a few ping pong tables near the pool area which look pretty fun. They also have a very nice children's water play park that my 5 year old loves and so we took turns going back and forth between the big pool and the kids area. When we checked in initially, we were given a room that smelled like smoke and asked to be moved, I had mentioned the reason for our stay and I wasn't asking for more than we'd paid for, just equivalent, minus the smoke.  We were moved to a room located on the rooftop of the next building so when we went out on the balcony, that rooftop was our view... and we could have literally stepped over the railing and walked on their roof. There was NO WAY I WAS STAYING IN THAT ROOM. We had come to this hotel after my husband had surgery to remove cancer and this was our woosah moment. We needed to have a relaxing time after going through a very rough two months...so we went back down and this time, we were given a room with no balcony but with a view. We were sad to lose the balcony but at least we could still see the pool a little. The next morning, I received an email from management asking if I was enjoying my stay so I responded truthfully. I've been a Marriott Rewards member for years and I felt a little slighted. Within twenty minutes, we were in a balcony room with a pool view (which is what we were originally given but had smelled of smoke). Now we had a clean room that was to our liking. I truly began to enjoy my stay at that point. The balcony was large and GREAT! The pool was perfect and so was the food and drinks at the pool. At night, we sat on the balcony and watched the fireworks and during the day we were at the pool. My kinda vacay! Must send a special THANK YOU to Manager, Jonathan! I wish our stay could have been longer."},{"name":"Cactus Club","address":"939 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"MMMM FROZEN MARGARITA!!!\\n\\nother than that.. can't help you out.

I can't comment on authenticity as I have no idea what authentic Brazilian food is like, but the flavor was all there. As with most places south of Georgia, steer clear of the tap water if at all possible. Sulfur water does not help the dining experience. \\n\\nAccording to the waiter, I ordered a very Brazilian dish; sirloin steak and eggs topped with \\"caramelized\\" onions. The steak was seasoned and cooked very nicely, it wasn't trimmed perfectly, but hey it's sirloin, what do you expect? The egg was a lovely medium with the slightest bit of runny yolk. The onions claimed to be caramelized but, while good, were only saut√©ed. The dish came with a side of rice and some wonderful black beans, which I'm guessing were cooked in traditional Brazilian style with a healthy scoop of lard. Tasty. Mixing the rice and beans and topping with some farofa, a cooked flour condiment, created a wonderfully flavorful and textural side dish. My wife and I also split some excellent fried, sweet plantains and some empanadas. Both flavors we tried, cheese/oregano and chicken, were very good, not over fried, not greasy, well seasoned. \\n\\nThe waiter was kind and helpful, constantly maintaining full drink glasses and providing us with some Brazilian suggestions. The ambience was a little strange, there were two people at the bar and a large Brazilian family at a nearby table, but other than that the place was pretty empty. The decor seemed to be going for a modern, resort style restaurant with blue LED lights lining the walls. Pricing was a little steep, but not too bad for a vacation and tourist town.

They advertise huge pictures of their steak, sushi and cocktails. I dined in with 12 co-workers and we sat around two adjoining hibachi tables. Entering the restaurant in the middle of the day, it was dark, empty and had an old food smell. Like a grill that had not been cleaned or an exhaust fan that went out. There is ample seating, a bar area and a water feature that had what looked like leftover Christmas garland. I was surprised that a restaurant of that size was so empty at noon on a Friday.\\n\\nI briefly considered the sushi special but after reading other Yelp reviews and my Ops Manager urging us to \\"stick with the hibachi\\". I went with the hibachi lunch special with chicken and shrimp. The menu stated it comes with a house salad and house soup for $8.95, which seems to be a bangin deal so I had reasonable hopes.\\n\\nOur server, a middle aged asian woman with a thick accent moved to each seat very quickly and I had just enough time to order my food before she slid to the remaining seats and off to the back. She was very agitated that some of the guests were getting up from the table to take business calls after ordering and exclaimed to our side that \\"he needs to sit in the same seat\\" when he comes back for his order. She also barked at me when I inquired what kind of soup she was presenting to me and I informed her I had an onion allergy and could not eat the soup. \\n\\nShe didn't offer me anything different. She just looked at me sternly and scolded me for not telling her earlier because the chef \\"puts onions in the shrimp.\\" Umm...sorry for having a severe enough allergy that needs warning? \\n\\nOur chefs came to the tables and had personality. It was a pretty standard hibachi show with cliche catchphrases. Their personality was probably the only redeeming feature of this review.The chef did exclude the onions from my food, but unfortunately excluded it from the entire table's food as well, which disappointed me as I made that request to her personally to keep from alerting my entire office that I had \\"special needs\\".\\n\\nThe food itself was good. Average I guess. Nothing to write home about. I had a headache less than 45 minutes of leaving, meaning there was a substantial amount of MSG in there somewhere.

Yay!\\n*Super-Friendly hostesses\\n*The water was cold (I'm reaching here)\\n\\nCons:\\n*The service from our waitress was slim and she took FOREVER. Don't go here if you're starving :( \\n*The fish tacos were dry and bland - the Bellini saved my mouth\\n*The steak tips - um... there were 5 teeny tiny steak tips and tons of fries. Big Love said the steak tips weren't that good either. He ate the steak tips and left most of everything else. Meh.\\n\\nSadly, I don't think I will ever be going here again.

You should've been at the top of my list.\\n\\nI have yet to come here on a weekend, so perhaps the wait will be prohibitive when I do, but on weekdays, you can get a table right away. The garden seating area is charming, and it's covered, so if it's one of those warm-but-rainy days (as we have often this time of year), you can still sit outside and pretend it's summer. The indoor portion of the restaurant is low-key and cozy --smaller than I expected, but charming in its own way. Our server was personable and helpful, and our food was excellent.

First, there's no consistency with ingredient servings: skimp on everything one time, pile it on the next. I watched in amusement as one employee took time to artfully arrange a few slivers of cheese; I watched in horror another time as my bowl was absolutely flooded with sour cream. \\"A little bit of the pinto beans\\" can mean anything from three beans to three pounds of beans, depending on who's serving. \\n\\nSecondly, most of the staff are SLOW.

In Lebron James' fashion, this was not 1 fly, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6, not 7...This was at least 15-20 flies buzzing about the seating area. It was distracting and disturbing that we would be eating in this environment. The host/server was friendly and attentive; we were pleased with the service.\\n\\nMy better half and I split two entrees, the goatee burger with house salad and the polenta. The burger was quite tasty, we both loved the goat cheese and savored every bite. The patty, unfortunately, did not fit the bun, and I devoured my half of the patty in 2 bites, with another 2 of just bun and filling. The house salad was good. Not overdressed, good execution for just a simple salad. We both enjoyed the almonds in it.\\n\\nThe polenta was the big disappointment here. Although it came with a healthy portion of 3 polenta cakes (each layered with artichoke spread) served over a bed of mushroom, capers, and a nice sauce, there was no texture to this dish. The plating was nice, but as the server brought it out you could see it jiggle like jello from a mile away. The polenta seemed soggy, and with no crisp on the outside it got completely lost in the dish and was underseasoned. (Side note: if the polenta cakes from Farm Cafe made its way into this dish with the accoutrements served at the Tin Shed, it would be the perfect polenta dish).\\n\\nOverall this place was a mixed bag. I want to go 2 stars, but I can't bring myself to because of the potential this place has to be good.

We ordered 2 Ruby's and Miso Soup (they were out of the kale salad and a root veggie dish that both sounded amazing...next time!).  The owner prepared the dishes to order as we waited and watched, meticulously putting it all together.  We ate a quinoa/dark chocolate cookie while we waited - I highly recommend this bite of heaven!  The menu is carefully crafted, and features great currys/sandwiches/salads, etc, and all items are vegetarian or vegan.  The freshest ingredients shine though, and our Ruby curry was the perfect consistency and exactly the right amount of spicy...every bite tasted healthy and warm.

The corn muffins were delicious. The oxtail was also a hit, I totally wasn't expecting it, but it was amazing.

Ordered asparagus and truffle mashed potatoes as sides and those were good. We also ordered the carrot cake for desert! It was the best carrot cake I've had. Very rich and meant for sharing.

It was like getting out of a bad relationship and man did it feel good. The last time I came was for a Christmas party that I was the host for. I paid for a lane, food, and drinks. One member of my group ordered a breezy mojito. When the drink came she claimed it was soooo good. She didn't remember what mojito it was but the drink had tons of strawberries in it. I was sure it was the strawberry mojito. When I asked the server if it was the strawberry mojito she swore up and down that it was in fact the breezy. I said ok and said that whatever was in that glass was what I wanted. She came back with a completely different drink. No strawberries what so ever. Looking at the menu I saw that the breezy had no strawberries listed. So now I'm positive that the strawberry mojito was what was brought out. The server claimed that it WAS the breezy and that different bartenders have different was of making the drinks. Now I was a bar tender for a while and I understand one bartender using more mint than the other or more lime juice but introducing a whole new ingredient....riiiight. What if I was allergic to strawberries and my bartender just decided to mix it up a little. Anyways after getting 3 manager involved the issue was finally solved and I got my strawberry mojito and the manager apologized for the server's misunderstanding (aka lies) he then went on to explain how he is a visiting manager that is here to turn this place around bc it is one of the worst locations that they have....\\nSkip tonight. I ONLY came be it was a child's birthday. I immediately noticed that they got ride of a lot of the racing games and that most of the games were sticky or broken (I.e. Air hockey). I see that they revamped the menu. But the food was still subpar. But one thing stayed true. The customer service still sucks. The server brought us brown/puke green guacamole and when we sent it back she was obviously annoyed. And when we asked for refills she actually rolled her eyes. I can't say I'm surprised.

This is a nice place for a nice quiet meal.  It's not as noisy or as bustling as many of the Polaris Parkway area restaurants and is a a little more of a \\"finer dining\\" place than many of the chains along Polaris Parkway.  As such, it's priced a bit higher than most of the run-of-the-mill Polaris eateries but is still priced lower than the hi-end steak houses.  It's more of a finer dining place than your average casual restaurant.\\n\\nWe were there on a Friday night as part of a group of 25 people (we're part of a dining group that gets together once a month to eat out together and we typically have 25-30 people). We had reservations and the restaurant was prepared for our group.  Despite having such a large group, the service was excellent -- the same as you would expect if you were dining as a couple or as a small group.  Our waitress was very attentive and kept up with the beverages, bread, etc.\\n\\nFor starters, my wife and I both had a bowl (only $1 more than a cup) of the chicken and crawfish gumbo which was excellent.  It was just a little spicy -- enough to give it an appealing bite but not overly spicy.  For my entree I had the Walleye Amandine w/ zucchini risotto and fresh vegetables.  It's interesting looking back at my 2014 review that I also had the Walleye that time as well.  The vegetables were cooked to perfection which means not over-cooked and still a little crispy.  The Walleye and the risotto were both excellent.\\n\\nMy wife ordered from the \\"Napa Valley Harvest Menu\\" (their specials of the season).  She ordered the Baked Salmon with Cherry-Cola BBQ sauce that was served with dauphine potatoes and the vegetable of the day.  The potatoes and vegetables were great but she was disappointed with the salmon.  She was intrigued by the Cherry Cola BBQ sauce which we've had on BBQ in the south but it didn't seem to pair well with the baked salmon.  The BBQ sauce was somewhat over-powering for the delicate flavor of the salmon.  She said it was good but far from great and that she wishes she had gone for the more traditional salmon.\\n\\nSIDE NOTE -- Prime Rib is a regular special on Friday and Saturday nights and on Sunday.

In the last few years there has been a whole lot of 'Shanghainese' themed restaurants popping up everywhere in Richmond, I can name you 10 places that you can have the infamous XLB in Richmond without pulling out the handy smartphone and even using this app, but I still remember when there were few places, and for 'high-end' there were fewer... except when this one popped up.\\n\\nI haven't come back in here in years (before my Yelp writing days) and I needed to come back to warrant even writing about the place, and finally that time has come. We rolled in at 9pm, so the dinner crowd was either finishing off their last bites, or settling up their bill and we had a table in no time. Usually, the times I have come here, or have driven by, there is a lineup, not too long, but regardless your waiting for good food! The place itself is not that big, and mainly due to the massive round tables in here that take up lots of space, with the chairs, so you may feel a little cramped, we did not as the place was emptying out, but never felt rushed during the whole meal.\\n\\nWe had an order of their xiao long bao, which they make in house, as most of these places do now... top notch is the quality here, with a see through sight from the wrapping, where you can see the 'soup' flowing while you carefully pick each individual peice up with your chopsticks. I was not to sure which XLB was ordered (as I wasn't the one calling the dishes) but this one had a distinct crab sweetness flavour to it, something very fresh, yet very foreign, I need to look at the menu, cause this XLB was pure evil joy!\\n\\nOther orders on the night were a mushroom based cleasr broth soup with greens. A dish of pea tip leaves mixed with garlic (one of those favorite expensive green dishes!). A good serving of pork belly, laid on a bed of spinach. This dish was a huge size when it is only 3 of us eating, where the belly is just staring you in the face, with the glistening layer of tasty fat, while this thing is smothered in it's own marinating sauce, and because this was such a heavy dish we had to order some rice to take on some of the oil. The rice came in it's own wooden container, and when we opened this thing, it had some shreds of pickled cabbage, and meats, to give the rice some extra flavor. This rice was done just write, and the natural oils that eminated from the meats mixed in to give the rice a smooth texture when putting it in your mouth. The other dish we had was a deep fried garlic crab. Clean, and fresh, even though the thing was deep fried, you knew you weren't getting a dead crab, as the meat was still sweet, this was a great meal, and our eyes outdid our stomachs where I had to have most of the food packed and taken home for multiple lunchs/dinners/snacks during the week.\\n\\nI have never come here for lunch, all my meals have been for dinner, and I hope to come again real soon, I just don't want to deal with the lineups. When you come make sure to call ahead, even with all the selection in Richmond, people know a good thing, and that's why people will wait for it, save you the pain, and book it.

I crave them.\\nI would eat here regularly if my metabolism could handle it. \\n\\nI originally was going to give this place five stars but decided on four for two reasons: \\n\\n(1) It's rude to suggest a 30% tip for take out. When you go to pay they use this keypad to add tip. It says add 20%, 25% or 30%. Last time I checked, 20% for dinner was considered a good tip for dinner, but they have this selection for lunch, dinner and takeout. And this isn't like a fancy sit down place, you order at the counter before eating and the wait service needed is very minimal (they basically just bring you your plate). I'm not a cheap tipper but given the setting and the fact that sometimes people order lunch or take out 10%, 15% and 20% would be more appropriate options. \\n\\n(2) Can't say no to free dessert offered by old man. They always try to push free beignets on you. At first, this was very touching and endearing. Who doesn't like free dessert? But the beignets aren't that good, and sometimes you don't want dessert after eating a greasy (but delicious) gyro. Plus it's this old Greek grandpa (him and his wife own the place) who comes out and insists you take the beignets. It makes you feel like you have to take it, like saying no is an insult to him. He is the Greek version of the Italian grandma. So my husband said he won't eat here anymore because he feels bad saying no to the old man and doesn't like wasting food (he used to discretely wrap the beignets in a napkin and throw them out but felt very guilty about it). Because my usual dining partner refuses to eat here, I end up getting take out a lot now. But even when you get take out you will be pressured into a 20% plus tip."},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"300 West 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Not only has the service gone completely down they have no concept of time.

The restaurant is really cute, or maybe I should say kawaii!!  The energetic mural, drawn by the owner's talented 12 year old daughter, is the perfect offset to the otherwise zen decor.  (look for her signature on the far right of the mural for extra cute points)  Their sparse menu is the same for lunch and dinner, which includes a handful of appetizers, five ramens, and a couple of desserts.  \\"Order at the counter and your food will be brought to you\\" style, I love getting things I want! \\n\\nKanji's gyozas are top notch!  Pan seared to an excellent crisp, non-gummy dough, well seasoned, and full of meaty chicken.  The Steak on Stick(s) was delicious, marinated, tender, and served with a couple of flawlessly grilled asparagus and brussel sprouts.  An $8 price tag is a little high for one stick of New York strip, but it was so flavorful and tender that I didn't really care and would get again.  I ordered the Signature Ramen and was not disappointed, the pork bone broth was flavorful, with an inkling of depth, and not super salty.  I wanted more broth, not sure if the serving of broth is on the small side, or if it's proof that their broth is totally pleasant.  All of the components of the ramen were well prepared, especially the ajitama egg and different mushrooms.  But, the pork belly was not my favorite.  Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed my thin, less rendered chashu, but I may be ruined by a local competitor into wanting something I can sink my teeth into.  Ramen comes in many styles, just like American bbq, so Kanji's ramen and I are okay in my book.

We asked to sit in the middle but they didn't allow us in case they need to sit a 4 people party later. Oh well, not that big of a deal.\\n\\nFrom the dine out menu, here's what we ordered.\\nAppetizers: miso soups and rolls (2 pieces california, 2 pieces BC each)\\nEntrees: Steak and Lobster, Filet Mignon and Lobster\\nDesserts: Mango and Coconut ice cream\\n\\nFor a price of $28, we thought that was pretty reasonable for the menu. We also added an order of beef sashimi, tako sushi, and masago cone from the regular menu.\\n\\nThe miso soups, rolls, and beef sashimi came first. The soups are good, I really enjoyed it, but my boyfriend found it to be a bit salty for his tastes. Rolls are OK, the rice on my rolls were a thin base as opposed to some restaurants that make rolls that are 50% rice, and the fillings are of a nice portion, so I'm happy. The beef sashimi was really good, the beef was thick, and the dipping sauce excellent. I have to say their beef sashimi is at the top of my list from the places I've had them. Normally in AYCE sushi or whatnot, the beef sashimi is cut with a meat slicer and are circular in shape. This one however, looked like they sliced fresh beef off a filet mignon, bonus points. My boyfriend ate the tako and masago, so I can't comment on how those taste, he said it was good though so I'll leave it at that.\\n\\nOur teppan chef came, his name was David. I was a bit disappointed that he didn't do any neat tricks except setting the grill on fire from time to time. The last time I've been here my chef made me an onion ring volcano, but I guess this time they were too busy with all the dine out guests to bother with tricks. He came and asked us who's having the steak and who's having the filet mignon, and I replied that we were thinking of sharing those. His reply was this, word by word \\"I don't care if you're sharing, that's your problem, I need to know who to put what food in front.\\" What? I was a bit put off by that attitude right from the start! Most teppan chefs will happily divide your food up for you. However, he was definitely skilled with the knife and spatula, that I'm pleasantly surprised, at least they didn't send a rookie in front of the customers for busy nights. \\n\\nThe first course is some vegetables; onions, zucchinis, and mushrooms stir fried with garlic, butter, and sauce. I enjoyed it, especially the zucchinis, they were cooked just to the point where it's not raw, but it's not soggy either. \\n\\nSecond course, the lobster tails. Since David was also cooking for another couple seated across from us, there were 3 lobster tails on the grill. He diced them up and mixed them all together before he added the butter, the garlic.. etc etc. That led my boyfriend to be a little suspicious, how do they know they're dividing the portions up evenly if they just mix everyone's order on the grill? Anyways, the lobster was overcooked, it was bland and it tasted rubbery.\\n\\nThird course, the steak and the filet mignon. We asked for it to be cooked medium-rare, and it was done just like that. The beef was delicious, no complaints. Although if we were to go again, we would definitely just get the filet mignon, it just melted in your mouth whereas the steak was still a little chewy.\\n\\nForth course: fried rice and bean sprouts... The rice is fried with eggs, green onions, carrots... I don't eat carrots so I picked at my rice a bit, it was tasteless so I just left it to one side, however my boyfriend is one of those Asians that has to have rice at every meal and he devoured the bowl. Bean sprouts, undercooked and bland. Both of us just left it alone.\\n\\nFinally the desserts. The mango ice cream tasted like those mango pudding that you'd get at AYCE restaurants, luckily I love those mango pudding. The coconut ice cream.. in my opinion, wasn't that great, because it had store bought coconut shavings in it, and it just made the texture of the ice cream really bad.\\n\\nI would come back here and try their regular menu next time, did you know they have something called \\"horse sashimi\\" ?"},{"name":"Smallwares","address":"4605 NE Fremont St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"After searching Yelp and asking around for the most exciting restaurant to go on our visit to Portland, I'm thrilled we landed at Smallwares.

Shrimp were well cooked and seasoned nicely. I think my favorite part was the spicy harissa? sauce smeared on the side to run everything in. Didn't however notice any kimchi in the dish.\\n\\nRabbit ragou, absolute star. The rabbit itself was perfectly cooked that it basically melted away in your mouth. The flavors were exciting and addicting, I wanted to lick the bowl when it was done. \\n\\nThe gnocchi, the only disappointment all night. I was initially thrilled that our server ran back to the kitchen to claim the last order of gnocchi for us, but perhaps I shouldn't have been. The gnocchi itself was pretty dried out and chewy, maybe it had been made too early on and after sitting around its consistency was off.

So, now I was torn between Hibachi and Tempura, then I figured... Why not both! I wanted to ensure that I got the most frugal option, so I asked the server was there a way to add on shrimp tempura to my meal. I was then given the recommendation of the shrimp and vegetable tempura appetizer and went for it. While waiting for my meal, offered ice water, which was a nice gesture and refreshment. Shortly thereafter, I received my food and hurried home. OH MY GOSH!!! I took those first couple of bites of the hibachi chicken and fell in love! Took a few... actually a lot of bites of the vegetables that accompanies the dinner and almost couldn't stop. My side salad with ginger dressing was amazing! The miso soup was so yummy and delicious!

Also, be prepared to spend some money because it is not as cheap as the place looks. \\n\\nUpon walking in, I was instantly reminded of Golden Corral, as it seemed to have that type of atmosphere. We were seated immediately and our waiter did a pretty good job at explaining how everything worked. They had some pretty cheap cocktails and I was happy that they actually listed the prices for their signature cocktails ($4), unlike other restaurants that leave you to find out the price at the end of the meal. \\n\\nSo we got up and took our bowls over to the beginning of the \\"buffet,\\" where you choose your noodle-base and meat (which by the way, is ALL raw). Then you move on to the veggies and then onto the sauces and spices. After that, you then take your bowl over to this counter where there's a big round grill and the grill masters then take your bowl and dump it onto the grill and cook it in front of you while you wait. They have fun with each other and make it entertaining to watch, but what really had me concerned was the amount of cross-contact with other people's food, as they touch everyone's food with the same cooking utensils as they rotate around the grill to toss the food around. I don't have any food allergies, so I wouldn't have any problems. But with some of the sauces containing peanut accents and other ingredients, it just had me wondering what accommodations are made for those that have those problems. Might be worth calling ahead and finding out, if you happen to be one of those people.\\n\\nMy meal, overall, was good - not great, but good. If I ever visit again anytime soon, I'll be a little bit more mindful of how I build my palate. I did not know that the soup and salad bar was included in our meal, so I missed out on getting the most of what I was charged for, which brings my good first experience to a very severe buyer's remorse. My entire bill for 3 people with three $4 cocktails was $60. I was expecting maybe a $40 bill at the most but $60?? That's when I learned that the price per person for the meal is $12.99. Had I known that before deciding to eat there, I would've saved it for another day when I wasn't worried about spending too much.\\n\\nI'll admit, it was my fault for not paying attention to what the prices were before deciding to eat there, but I did try to look in the menu so I could be mindful about what I was able to spend, but I do not remember seeing anything mentioning $12.99...just a bunch of significantly smaller prices for add-ons.

We pulled in the back entrance and parked in a spot and were immediately approached by the valet, who told it was required to valet. She started to unhook her key to hand it to him, but apparently she wasn't going fast enough because he came back with \\"Um is that a problem?\\" We assured him that it was not we just didn't realize it was a requirement considering we were parked in a clearly marked spot for the restaurant. To which he rolled his eyes, slapped the claim ticket in her hand, and walked off mumbling something like \\"I'm mean It's complimentary, come on\\"\\n\\nSlightly shocked, we walked in and were immediately greeted by the bartender and host. Both were extremely polite and helpful. As a bartender, my first instinct was to sit at the bar, but once we were informed of the rooftop patio, we decided to give it a go and were led upstairs. The restaurant it's self was beautiful, well kept and inviting. The patio offers a fantastic view, and is not overly crowded. \\n\\nWe are seated, look through the menu, and are impressed at the easy to understand, well organized, and diverse dishes they had to offer. A gentleman (Alex) approaches us offers to grab us drinks (we ordered a water and diet coke to start with) and then brings us both waters before going to check on another table. Another man (Luis) brings the diet coke and walks away. Now we are slightly confused as to who is our server but again I know how things work so I figured one or both were busy so they'd be back and tell us any specials and I could order my margarita. \\n10 minutes later. Luis comes back and asks what we want from the menu. My friend orders a chimichanga and asks to have no guacamole. He looks at her explains where the guacamole is and tells her no. They do not go off menu. He then looks at me and says that I would want the the guac and he's just going to leave it on. I told him no. I was not interested in it and that she doesn't want it. She then tries to order a side of beans and he grabs the menu from her. Reads aloud and says no it doesn't come that way. She patiently tells him she understands but would still like a side of beans. He starts to get flustered and just grabs the menu and looks at me. So I order the enchiladas verde, but instead of chicken enchiladas, I'd like cheese (vegetarian, but I love green salsa) he flat out told me no. I'm clearly taken aback because he grabs my menu. Reads it out loud again. And then tells me no. I tried to explain to him that I don't eat meat, but if he couldn't do that I'd take the cheese enchiladas with a side of verde sauce. Again. I'm told no. That he'd have to talk to the chef. Tomorrow. So now I'm frustrated and he can clearly tell so I told him to just give me cheese enchiladas and we'd be done with it. And then I ask to start with a queso for the table. He grabs my menu and stomps off to the pos system and stands there and talks to the first guy we saw. 10 minutes later he finally appears to finish putting in our order and disappears downstairs. So we sit there and observe other guests. And the servers. And wait for our queso. 10 minutes go by. I watch guacamole being made. I see other new tables get their dip. And it becomes pretty clear. He forgot it. It's not until he finally wonders by to talk to his other table that I flag him down and he just turns and walks back downstairs 5 minutes later our food arrives and he finally runs up with a bowl of cheese. By now my friend is angry and just says never mind there isn't a point now. \\n\\nIn every restaurant I've worked in, the normal response would have been: \\"I'm sorry for my mistake, here keep it\\" \\nNope. He turns around and gives it to another table.... With acknowledging that we've received our food. Or asking how anything looks. Or if we need anything. He just walks away. \\n\\nTo finish up this lengthy review. (Mainly because he never bothered to come back so He couldn't give me any reason to complain) The food was good. It took me another 15 minutes to get a water refill. I finally waved him down. He grabs our plates. Tells us he'll be back, and returns with our check. I wanted a churro damnit but I was not given the option. So we paid and left. Tipping both him and the snotty value 20%. \\n\\nNow I never complain. Ever. But this was ridiculous.

In 2 hours, we had lamb, beef, scallops, crab, bok choy, spinach, shrimp, chive dumplings, clams, mushrooms and lots of noodles.  We did both a spicy pot as well as a mild pot of broth.   I had heard a rumor that if you order too much food, they will give you menus that are different and DO NOT have the most expensive items on it for your third or fourth rounds, but that wasn't the case when we were there for dinner.  We had at least 4 rounds of food brought to our table for 7 people.  \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is no frills - - looks like a bingo hall turned hot pot restaurant, with the lighting too bright and the decor too drab.

I have been to hole in the walls and even the nicely decorated places. That being said, I can confidently say NEVER get sum dim sum! \\n\\nMy fellow dim sum lover and I went to check this place out since we've seen it in passing going down on Lamar. We've tried all the dim sum places in Austin and were excited to see another dim sum option pop up in this part of town. We should have known this was a fraud dim sum place when we were not greeted by any Asians and did not see any Asians in the place. Although I am a huge fan of the traditional cart method, the concept of marking your order on the menu is the only reason this rating has a star at all. Understanding that it is trying to cater to a larger crowd with its gluten-free and vegetarian options, this place is still over-priced especially with the size of the dishes. For example, many dumplings traditionally come in 4's. They only serve them in 3's here and charge at higher prices than others. There were even items like the BBQ pork bun and BBQ pork puff pastry that traditionally come in 3's and only came in a single portion. All of these plates charged at prices that were the same, if not higher, than other dim sum restaurants! Even though we went in the middle of the day on a Sunday afternoon, which is usually prime dim sum hour, many of the items tasted stale and some even tasted undercooked (read: Baked BBQ pork bun dough was soggy and doughy on the bottom and inside).\\n\\nKnowing that Austin is struggling and needs to increase its Asian \\"Chinatown\\" offerings, I never like to knock down anybody's effort for this cause. However, I HAD to post this to warn ALL dim sum lovers and dim sum virgins...this is NOT the place to go for dim sum!

The Polaris Grill is one of the most popular restaurants in our rotation.\\n\\nMy wife and I both ordered the \\"mixed grill\\" which was one of their specials last night.  The entree consisted of a 4-oz filet, a 4-oz piece of salmon and a 4-oz crab cake. The entrees were served with a hearty portion of garlic mashed potatoes.  I ordered my filet RARE and my wife requested medium rare - both were cooked to perfection.  All 3 of the entree items were exceptional.  Others in our group ordered a variety of entrees including the prime rib, the fish and chips, Tournedos Polaris, the strip steak and the pork chops.  Everyone said their food was excellent - I didn't hear a single complaint.\\n\\nThe service last night was also exceptional.  When you have a group of 30, you expect some glitches in the service -- some food comes out quicker than other orders, etc.  But last night - all of the food came out at almost the exactly the same time.  I think all 30 meals were served within 3-5 minutes from the time the 1st plate was served.  The waiter handling our group was exceptional.  \\n\\nOur reservations were for 6:30 and the group started to arrive around 6:00.

Cool.\\n\\n*Nice but very un-smooth service - by that I mean that the team-approach didn't flow very well; of the four gentlemen who served us, only one spoke English at all/well. Examples of the service: our calamari starter had to be confirmed after ordered; silverware replacement between courses had to be requested after forks or knives were removed (a pet peeve of mine); there was confusion about my question as to whether a side of pasta came with an entree order (more on that later).\\n\\n*I wasn't happy that our garlic bread was over-toasted - but I think that's an exception to the rule; I loved the calamari. \\n\\n*Good salads- he liked the house (which looked Fellini's-esque but not as good, to me) and I really liked my Caesar (great lettuce and dressing).\\n\\n*Frequent water fills.\\n\\n*Discussing entrees, I ended up deferring to my friend's choice (it was my b'day dinner but I had a feeling we'd end up ordering too much food if we both got entrees) - the Godfather. If you like veal, do get this. I loved the veal parm best, the limone second and didn't like the marsala as the mushrooms were overpowering and too saucy (I love mushrooms, so I was surprised - he liked it best so...).  All of the veal was sauteed perfectly. Each portion in the dish could feed one person alone, if that gives you an idea. To be stereotypical, a hungry guy plus a regular girl like we were would be plenty happy splitting this dish.\\n\\n*The above mentioned side pasta issue was that I asked if one came with an entree and was told no, so I ordered a side of the spaghetti Bolognese (note: everyone who has said the sides are plenty are right) and when our food came out...his came with a side of pasta marinara. I wouldn't have ordered a pasta if I'd known this - tip is, clarify double when you order. And, frankly, in a nice place (or really, any casual one) I am used to having the server tell you to enjoy the dish then bringing the replacement and just taking it off your check (it is thrown away, anyhow!) but our server just took it away; we didn't really need it, but Luke or I might have eaten it later, just sayin'.\\n\\nThe overall vibe was pleasant, and it fit my mood for old school Italian. Still - I wasn't overly impressed. I would go back, but as I told my friend - I think it's a spot better suited to a group who wants an authentic version of a Maggiano's family style experience. Everything is sized better to share, the quality is good....and I think better enjoyed over bottles of Montepulciano and taking time to space out courses. If the water refills are good, the wine is flowing, and it doesn't matter who orders what because all the good stuff can be easily passed around - molto bene."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Had dinner here after a week at Disney and it was great.

We live in FL, lots of water. Why frozen fish?? And the tacos were $8 for 2...I expect better tacos for that price. My friend then recommended I get dessert so I can hopefully feel better about the place. We got smores.

Making pizza is not difficult.) or they're dumping tons of salt in it to make people thirsty so they'll drink more beer.  When you crank the salt up that high you have to add sugar to cover it up, and that pretty much perfectly describes the taste of the pizza.  The service has been pretty indifferent as well, although for 4 bucks I'm not sure I can complain.  Fix your pizza, OB."},{"name":"Dinesty Dumpling House","address":"1719 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My favorite place to go for dumplings in Vancouver. :) It's similar to Din Tai Fung.

The mixed-in sauces gave the meat a unique flavor that made me not want to put it down to dig into the seasoned fries. There are a few special sauces available I sampled for the fries instead of ketsup - both the garlic and Zulu sauces were good choices. Wading through a couple of the beef empenadas was worthwhile; very flavorful, and the accompanying lime and pico added just the right amount of zip for me. I had to force myself to try a churro (OK, two or three...) and they, too, were excellent. \\n\\nIf I'd been walking or driving and looking for a place to grab a bite, chances are I'd have continued right past this place.  Don't make that mistake! If you're feeding the family you might want to get takeout, because there's not much seating in the restaurant.

The sandwich roll was gigantic...the sandwich will definitely fill you up (I didn't eat all the bread).  However, it was definitely a bit pricey, as some others mention...sandwiches near or above $10 really have to wow me, and this did not.  It would have been ok if it was between $6-8.  Also tried a couple of their \\"Henchmen\\" sides for $1 each- the ramen popcorn was 'eh', with what tasted like the ramen noodle packet of spice sprinkled on top of dry stale popcorn.   Disco volante (veggie chicarones) was better...but that's probably because I like Funyuns...that's what they taste like, w/ some spices sprinkled on top.\\n\\nI also tried one of their alcoholic 'evil potions'- the Gamma Crush, which was described as gin, Thai basil, Sichuan peppercorns & simple syrup.

One of our favorite things about Colorado was all of the local, non chain, delicious restaurants in Denver, Boulder, and Louisville. We were nervous about finding similar restaurants in the Orlando area!\\n\\nAfter a long hike on Saturday, we started searching on Yelp for a place for dinner. We were starving! We found the Ravenous Pig and called around 5:00 to see if we could get a reservation. They were booked, and told us that if we showed up anyway we could expect about a 30 minute wait. We decided to chance it and arrived at about 6:30. We were immediately seated outside at a great table. Our waitress was super friendly and welcoming, bringing us water right away while we tried to make drink and food choices - everything looked amazing! Our waitress was great throughout the whole meal. We are going to Ireland in two weeks, and we had our map and guidebooks spread out all over the table. Rather than being bothered by this, as some places are, she was excited and asking us questions about our trip.\\n\\nMy husband had the white sangria and I had the Franco 75. They were both delish and very refreshing. I loved the lavender and rosemary vodka in the Franco! We started with the gruyere biscuits and they were wonderful - flaky and warm and the butter served with them adds just the right touch!\\n\\nMy husband had the burger and I finally decided on the Steak Frites. I was wavering between that and the Farmer salad. Our food was great. The burger had some amazing blue cheese (I'm a total sucker for good blue cheese), fresh baby lettuce, tomatoes, and caramelized onions. He usually hates any veggies on burgers, and he ate every single bite of that burger and veggies! My steak was awesome - the chimichurri sauce that they serve with it is unlike any I've ever had. It's like an aioli - so good! Both of our meals came with truffle fries. Yum yum yum! \\n\\nAt the beginning of our meal we had talked about having dessert, but we were too full.

Their Chicha  Morada (purple corn drink) is actually the most flavorful I've had in awhile, as I was pleased to see they resist the temptation here to water it down like so many places I've been to tend to do.

Not overpriced, always consistent, and not too long of a wait. Not this time unfortunately, so it's payback time. I went here for lunch the other day, wasn't too busy, and I had time to relax while I eat. Got one of my usual's, Fish & Chips lunch menu, rice and vegetables this time instead of fries and coleslaw. Didn't wait too long, out came my meal, placed in front of me. First thing I noticed, since it's the main food on the plate, was the fish.  The fillet wasn't much bigger than a frozen fish stick. It wasn't a nice dark toasty brown as usual either, so I could tell it wasn't fried too long. That makes a difference when you take a fork to it, the breading completely separates from the fish instead of clinging to it which makes it better to dip into the tarter sauce. The waitress also asked me if I wanted tarter sauce beforehand I remember. Who get's Fish & Chips without tarter sauce?! Are they trying to cut costs on a lousy cup of mayo and relish? Tried the rice. Crunchy bits of rice and lukewarm. Undercooked. Let's try the broccoli. Cold. They must use frozen bags of veggies that they nuke for their meals. Try nuking it longer next time guys. Took a sip of my water. Tasted like pool water, chlorine after taste. Needless to say I left as hungry as when I came in.  Let's get back to the pub as a whole. It used to be a nice cozy place that wasn't too over lighted and noisy inside. Now there's too many lights and TV's everywhere, as well as music on top of that in the background from somewhere.  And why is that these pubs think everyone is a sports fanatic with the same game on all six TV's? How about putting on a news channel on some or maybe a movie channel? No. I have to have the latest Little League championship from Iowa blasting me at every angle. And who came up with this, get to know the customer more intimately instead of just taking their order, giving them a number, and staying out of their personal lives if you don't know them? \\"Hi my name is___ your waitress, and what's your name? Nice to meet you Dave, how's your day going?!\\" Either that, or now your a \\"guest\\" instead of a customer. I feel like I'm at family Thanksgiving dinner instead of just wanting to fill my belly and go on my way. I'll probably go back to the 9's in the future, not as much as I used to, but it sure as Heck won't be this particular one."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Oh El Patrone how u can never do wrong. \\nAuthentic mexican CUISINE.

My shrimp burrito bowl was delicious, but way more food than I could handle. I upgraded to the combo for the drink and chips and salsa. I didn't try the salsa but ate my chips with the rice and beans from my bowl and  is really the only way to describe the whole experience. It was that good. And just to make things better, for all you ice eaters out there, Bell Street has that awesome pellet ice they have at Zaxbys. \\n\\nMy friends mostly had burritos and the best advice I could give you is not to spring for the extra large unless you're extra hungry. They thought, given the low price of the regular burrito, it would be smaller than they needed. But the regular was... well... regular. Definitely enough food, especially if you get the combo with chips. And the extra large was huge. So keep that in mind. \\n\\nThis place was amazing, and definitely hit the spot after a day of trekking along the Beltline.

They changed owners I think because the place got a face lift and changed the name, but nevertheless, the atmosphere inside is very cozy and pleasant. The quality of the food however was not up to par whatsoever for what the restaurant used to serve...I ordered the salmon and sockeye salmon nigiri a few weeks ago expecting a tender break away texture. Not only was the regular salmon nigiri chewy, frozen, and clearly not fresh but the more expensive sockeye salmon was almost the exact same texture and freshness. Very disappointed...Their roll I ordered was good but another incident I recently had was when I went downstairs to order a take out at about 10:15pm (fyi the place closes at 10:30pm) and the lady stopped me at the door and said the kitchen was closed at 10:10pm... After being a regular at Sushi & Ramen for quite sometimes, they always let me order up to the minute of closing. I wasn't bugged by it but just bringing it up that if you state that your restaurant closes at 10:30, that means you stop service at 10:30. Not 10, not 9:30 so the staff have time to pack up and go home, not 10:10 because you've already met the days quota. As a business student studying at UBC, word of mouth for any business means a lot nowadays so pleasing every single customer that comes through the door should be top priority for the restaurant. As Sushi & Ramen, it used to be excellent service, excellent quality food, and arguably on my top 5 restaurants I've ever been to. Now, I feel like the service has gone down, the quality of the food has been decreased (due to tight margins because of the renovations?), and overall it's been 3 times I went and have yet to have a pleasant experience. The final straw for me was when my boyfriend ordered the tuna sashimi and when we looked at the discolouration (which indicates poor quality tuna) as well as the chewiness, we knew that we just waisted $11.90 of our money. Overall, my advice for Best Sushi N' Kitchen is to go back to the restaurants old ways. Maybe call up the previous manager to see how he ran the restaurant? Especially when it comes to raw fish with a high probability that someone can get food poisoning, quality should be your number one priority! On an ending positive note, the place looks really elegant and cozy like I said, and the staff is nice...but the thing about the closing at 10:30pm but really 10:10pm rule made me think that they try to cut corners sometimes! Hopefully you can improve :) 2/5 because of numerous experiences with poor quality food which is vital for any restaurant!"},{"name":"Pisces Rising","address":"239 W 4th Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"3.5","text":"What a great day having lunch overlooking Mt Dora. \\nGood food, cold beer 78¬∞ and sunny.

Great color, great texture, crisp outside, fluffy inside, not tough, nice size.  Fried chicken (2 pieces on the waffle) and the fried chicken was just disgusting.  Horribly, horribly greasy.  1/2 of the skin was missing so it was just fried, greasy chicken flesh.  And... to make matters worse there was, no joke, about 1/2 CUP of some whipped honey stuff on the chicken that had melted onto the chicken and the waffle making the chicken and waffle too sweet and my waffle a soggy mess.  Jesus!  Really?!  1/2 a CUP of that sweet stuff?  What the Hell?  It's a condiment NOT a side.  Moderation people.  Moderation!  Oh man, my plate was a sweet greasy mess and that is NOT a compliment.  I brought home 1/2 the waffle, 1/2 the doughnut and a piece of chicken.  By the time I got home I was feeling nauseous from sweet grease.  I opened the to-go box - there was literally a puddle of grease from the chicken.

Parties of varying size can be accommodated, but be prepared to wait as items are assembled as they are ordered.\\n\\nI really enjoyed my Lamb Gyro platter which came on spiced rice (instead of a bread wrap) and for $10.89 included two sides. The fresh veggies and Grandma's Grape Leaves were perfectly matched for the summer heat.

It was nice that there were pictures of everything so the girls didn't have to read the descriptions.  I got pad thai and they got the japanese dish. They were both very good and to me pretty authentic. the pad thai did not have much peanuts, cilantro or shellfish flavor, so not as good as other pad thai i've had, but I've heard this is also an authentic way to make it. the girls liked their japanese dish. reasonably priced. You can get beer and wine. it is large and has lots of tables, unlike the burger place which had about 5 small tables, all filled (some tables only had 2 seats).

I had low expectations since, well fusion doesn't usually work out for me. I was pleasantly surprised to discover otherwise.\\n\\nParking: private lot, shared with a few other restaurants, which makes the parking VERY difficult. Valet would be easier, so take advantage if you don't want to wait for a spot or stalk leaving patrons.\\n\\nInterior: dim and sophisticated. Tables are all pretty uncomfortably close together, but if you don't have to get up to go to the bathroom often, it's not terrible. Full bar with various sake on almost an entire side of the restaurant.\\n\\nBathrooms: A clean, single stall with some nice soap and lotion to use. Also provides small cups and mouthwash for your convenience!\\n\\nFood: The server explained that they get shipments of sashimi and fresh ingredients once a week, every Thursday. HOW CONVENIENT that we showed up on Thursday night!! They will then serve these specials everyday until they are sold out, so we got the freshest pick of the lot. The two specials were:\\n\\nKing Salmon Tasting ($15) - 3 slices of sashimi and 2 nigiri. The server pushed that there was a lot of omega-3, which of course only convinced me more to order it. The oily salmon soaked onto your tongue and melted into your mouth. That is some damn good salmon. \\nTuna Tasting ($17) - I got a little lost in the explanation. But the server emphasized the bluefin and fatty tuna. There were 2 slices of each tuna sashimi, as well as a single nigiri of each. Very high quality, indeed!\\n\\nOn top of these specials were the uni, which was also delivered in their weekly shipment. The uni comes in spoons or sashimi. Since were a party of 3, we ordered the sashimi, which comes in a portion of 3 pieces, versus the two spoons of uni. The uni was sweet and buttery. It's not the best I've had, but it's definitely up there in the ranks!\\n\\nWe ordered a couple more rolls and a sashimi:\\n\\nJalape√±o Yellowtail Shots - tangy fresh deliciousness. Comes with six cute shots. Has a quick spicy kick and a sour taste that reminds me of ceviche. A fun must-order.\\nUN (roll) - a pricier roll, and the server claimed it was overrated. Steak, crab, tuna and lobster all in one roll? Why not? The flavors were overwhelming, with the chili teriyaki and steak being the only flavors I could taste in the roll. Might as well have been the only ingredients...\\nChanel Replica - I love raw scallops. The fresh scallops were sweetened further by the mango. I loved this twist on the scallop sashimi in this roll. Another roll you must try.\\n\\nOverall, my only complaint was the rice. Sushi rice should always be perfectly soft and not overcooked. The rice we had was slightly hard and either undercooked or a day old... A little disappointed.\\n\\nService: our server was super patient and candid with us, which I loved. We had a weird incident with someone who brought us our food (not our server, though). He set the sashimi tasting down on the table a little roughly, which caused some of the tuna sashimi to fall off its small radish tower. His only response was \\"oh. It fell\\" before he walked off. I guess we couldn't have expected him to fix it with his bare hands but it was such an awkward moment - plus it ruined my picture of it!!!\\n\\nThe One Sushi+ exceeded my expectations. It's not just an Americanized Japanese restaurant: they have something legitimate going on!

I'm tempted not to submit my review for fear I might tarnish its perfect score. Here's the thing...I'm probably a little biased because I'm from the south. I've got certain standards when I see a restaurant offering as \\"southern\\" food. \\n\\nLet's start with the good stuff. I'd really like to come back here. Again and and again. Service was great. And, like other reviewers have already stated, the place is full of eye candy. The men who work here are really attractive. Super friendly, flirty, casual, etc. That's a plus. Their menu has quite a few selections I'd like to still try. \\n\\nThe oysters were great. They had some of my favorite varieties available and I ordered a few of each. Prices are decent -- about 2.25-2.75/each. I read they have a happy hour where all oysters are $1.50/each from 5-7 but I'm not sure if that's daily or not. \\n\\nThe fried chicken -- it's pretty good. The two day marinade they do makes the chicken super moist and tender. The skin is fried up nicely and has a honey drizzle over it. Pretty good. Again, I'm from the south so I'm not going to say it's the best fried chicken I've ever had, but I'd say it's the best I've had in Vancouver so far. The chicken came with green beans and mashed potatoes. The beans were good, and the mashed potatoes were nice in texture but needed a bit more seasoning. I still devoured my plate. \\n\\nSpeaking of seasoning, let's talk about the sauces that came out with the oysters. Louisiana's best Crystal hot sauce in a bottle, always a staple in my fridge at home so much appreciated. Then there was the typical vinegar/shallots mix. Then there was the house cocktail sauce which had the consistency of tomato paste. I'm not sure what I thought of this one despite trying it a few times. My favorite was the habanero sauce. That was nice. \\n\\nAlso had the shrimp and grits. The tastes were pretty decent but the textures were all wrong. Again, I'm from the south and grits are a frequent part of my diet. I often cook them up at home, and I know how difficult it can be to get that texture just right, especially when mixing in cheese as they did at Chewies. Sadly, this dish wasn't a hit for me. The fried chicken was much better. \\n\\nUnfortunately, they were all out of fried okra so I will have to try those next time I come in here. I love me some okra! Lastly, I have to tell you about the biscuits. They're tasty! They're just not biscuits like back home - soft, flaky, delicious. These biscuits are crisp, flat, and drizzled with honey (nice touch, actually). They're just.... different. If you're American, adjust your expectations when you order the biscuits but rest assured you'll enjoy them. \\n\\nI don't love that they serve wine in the little tumblers. I thought it was cute and quirky at first, and the guy filled my glass all the way to the rim. I get that they're trying to be different, but there's a distinct difference in the smell and taste of wine after it's been sitting in a tumbler for 5 minutes versus a proper wine glass. Try it sometime. Pour a little wine into each type of glass, let it sit, and then smell and taste the wine. In my opinion, there's just something lost when you serve wine in a tumbler. \\n\\nOkay, I feel really awful as though I'm tearing this place apart. I really DO like them and I do plan to come back to eat and try more things. The jambalaya and etoufee are calling my name as it's been a few years since I've been to the Big Easy and I sure do miss it. \\n\\nWarning: They don't take debit. What's up with that? They do, however, have an ATM on-site so you can use your debit to get cash and pay."},{"name":"Vij's Restaurant","address":"3106 Cambie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My son's family, including his 20-month-old daughter, dined at Vij's.

Well, 45 minutes later and starving, we checked on the status and were told that our party had already been seated-a.k.a. someone else claimed to be our party.

Many ideas were discussed in regard to where we would eat lunch together.  Someone suggested the b.side, noting that they had just started serving lunch recently and we should try it.\\n\\nSince lunch at the b.side is relatively new, it was relatively empty.  Whereas usually an empty restaurant at peak lunch hour is not a good sign,  this was not the case here.  It was excellent.\\n\\nPeople in our group tried various items on the menu, including the eggplant parmigiana sandwich, the tempeh reuben, the black bean burger, and the spanakopita.  Most everyone in the group began their meal with parsnip soup, which looked and smelled marvelous.  Unfortunately, they ran out of parsnip soup before I got there, as I had to run an errand after we made the decision as to where to dine.\\n\\nMy salad was very good, as was my black bean burger.  It had avocado, cheese, tomato, lettuce, and onion on it.  The bun was fresh, the burger was tasty.    I really was impressed with their tea selection.

We finished with a chocolate flourless cake which was quite good.\\n\\nOverall we really enjoyed our dinner. If I were the owner, however, I'd drop the prices about $5/plate and increase the portion size slightly (they're somewhat small), so there's something to take home.

I really don't like standing around trying to study menu on the wall while jostling with other people doing the same, while a poor cashier stares blankly into space, wishing you would hurry up so s\\\\he can do their other jobs.  Still, given the food and service I received, I will definitely return and brave the menu again in the future.  \\n\\nAs the name implies, Avvio is an Italian place, specializing in pasta bowls (about $10 each) and flat bread pizza ($5+).   Like its predecessor, the decor is simple.  Wood floors, TVs flickering in the corners, neutral colors.  The candles on the tables and Xmas lights around the window (if those are permanent) are a nice touch.  Nothing exciting, but nothing offensive or annoying either. \\n\\nThe night I stumbled in out of the cold, I decided to give the flat bread a go.  It sounded good, and was inexpensive.  However, which to order?  There was one that looked tasty, but I was not enthused that pepperoni was a topping.  However, upon mentioning this, I was told that I could put anything I wanted on my piece, so I got Italian sausage instead.  You can mix and match with the pasta too, so provided you study the menu a few minutes, you will be able to get a meal prepared exactly to your tastes.\\n\\nAnd it was very much to my tastes.  \\nThe flatbread was the size of my plate and very flavorful.  Nice touch of anise in the sausage, perfectly melted cheese, and thin but chewy crust. Impressive.  I also received a piece of some of the best tiramisu I have -ever- had.  Terrifically creamy, I just loved the texture of this stuff!  The coffee flavor in it was rich but not overpowering. Great service only enhanced the flavor.\\n\\nNow, the night I went, it was very late and I was the only person there.  In fact, I think they were going to close early before I wandered in.  However, if that was the case, they never showed it and indeed were very friendly.  I took my time, never feeling rushed or unwelcome - quite the opposite.  In fact, I had come in feeling a little down.  It was actually my birthday but also a long and frustrating first day back at work after a winter break, so I was not only starving but a bit \\"in the dumps\\" too.  I left in much better spirits than when I entered, and not only because I was offered a free shot.  :)   I'm not sure exactly what the normal policy for birthdays is, but they definitely made mine special.\\n\\nAnyways, going on the price and quality of the food, not to mention the service, I'd say that Avvio's is definitely worth checking out.

I've been in here at least once a week since I first found out about the Pickled Lemon, and often times more than that.  I have seen \\"Chipotle-style\\" fast casual Middle Eastern before, but what separates this place from the others is the attention to detail, and a slightly pared down menu that chooses quality over quantity.  Falafel is made fresh to order, and there are a wide variety of toppings to choose from for your pita or your platter.  You can make your own unique combination of dish depending on what toppings you include, all of which are tasty, healthy, and work well with one another.  I am especially fond of the horseradish beets, which are out of this world.  An assortment of six sauces reflecting various Middle Eastern cuisines (harissa from North Africa, mango amba (?) from Iraq, tahini, etc.) are provided gratis, with little take away cups and lids.\\n\\nBest of all, this place is cheap.  With tip, a pita can be had for under 8 bucks.  And they are wicked fast.  My only complaint lie with the hours: I can't wait for them to be open outside of the weekday lunch hours (they just started to open on Saturdays, and remain open later on Fridays).  This place blows away the competition in Boulder based on price and by a long shot on quality.  It is also a local business, and the owners are heavily vested in making sure this place serves it customers right.

Started fine and then we asked for the Magical Dining menu - special $33/person menu in September for certain restaurants.  You would think we just announced we were losers and deserved substandard service.  Wow!  Ultimately we turned the server around and got him to realize we were paying patrons and that our money (and tip) was going to be good.  It did put a bummer on the first half of the meal.  So my reco to Flemings ... Decide if you want to support this menu or not. And if yes, motivate your servers to lose the attitude."},{"name":"El Oriental De Cuba","address":"416 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"This is our go-to place for nights when we're feeling too lazy to cook!  The food is really good - we haven't been disappointed once.  Some highlights are Cuban sandwich, Shrimp variety plate (either sauces is fantastic), and the Oxtail Variety Plate  (choose ripe plantains and yellow rice with the variety plates!).  Usually one entree with a side of the ripe plantains is enough for the two of us, with maybe leftovers for the next day too!  \\n\\nMy only gripe - even if they tell you it takes 15 min for your takeout food to be ready, plan to get there closer to 30 minutes after you order.  It always takes longer than you think so plan ahead!!"},{"name":"Starbucks","address":"12400 State Hwy 71 W, Ste 710","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"Excellent customer service!

Yum!!!!!"},{"name":"Metro Burger","address":"950 Market Promenade Ave","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"3","text":"My favorite burger joint is, or I should say was, Five Guys. Metro Burger completely changed that. This place has amazing burgers. Their topping selection is top notch and the portion size is spot-on. You could spend more for a burger but it won't compare to the value and taste of a Metro burger.\\n\\nIf you are in the Lake Mary area, and are yearning for an amazing burger experience, give this joint a try.

I only had drinks in the lounge.\\n\\nThis restaurant is a very similar concept to the Coral Reef inside of Epcot which trumps it in everyway. The decor is nice, but feels like it has been done. The best touch is the 'sparkling stars' on the ceiling in the bar.\\n\\nThe drinks are the same as many other places in Disney, most notably the same menu as the Coral Reef I noticed. Drinks were good and the place was empty.

This place was AMAZING!!!!!! The menu is pretty small but somehow ticked all the boxes of choices. We had the crabcake appetizer, which although was mostly crabmeat, it needed a little more seasoning. We had the mushroom soup, it was so good we asked the chef to come out so we could tell him. He came out and was super nice and explained to us how it was made. For our entr√©e, we had the bison steak, was also very nice!!!

Additionally, their music is always on point. It's just overall a great little cafe."},{"name":"Alfredo's Italian Restaurant","address":"1989 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Yum. Italian food, I've missed you. I'm admittedly picky on this topic after being spoiled by a summer of the real thing in Pisa. This is very good Italian food by American standards and fabulous Italian food by Atlantan standards.\\n\\nThe Godfather (veal three ways) with a side of penne bolognese is perfect for my indecisiveness. Veal parmesan was my favorite of the three by so much cheese and sauce. The garlic bread was yummy. I can't comment on the salad or vegetables because I wasn't willing to waste any valuable tummy space on something without carbs or sauce.\\n\\nBut my absolute favorite parts of the meal were the wine and the tiramisu. The house Montepulciano was awesome and the tiramisu was perfect- light and fluffy with a hint of espresso. Whatever else you order, great wine and great tiramisu will make the meal.\\n\\nI'm jealous of the table next to us that ordered their \\"regular\\" and have already told my husband a thousand times that I need to go back again this month.

It has a fantastic patio to watch a game or catch-up with friends.  I went twice in three days during our work conference.  On Friday nights they had $2 margaritas and they were actually not all sour mix!  They are known for their Zingers - basically chicken fingers - but they were fantastic and you could customize your sauce.  On Tuesday nights they have $5 baskets.

Overall my experience was pretty good. I have been here a few times and never have really been blown away by their food, as it is basically a dive bar, but I guess decent if your tipsy and/ or drunk.
