Loved it!"},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We actually waited in line *twice* before eating here.  We had heard that this place was really good, but after waiting for a while with the line not moving *at all*, we decided to check out a few other places to eat.  After not finding anything up to our standards, we decided to head back, and when we got back there, the line was just as long as it had been when we left, but was filled with entirely new people.  Seems as if we shouldn't have left in the first place, as they get in a new shift of people pretty quickly, even if the line doesn't move for several minutes.\\n\\nSo after getting back in line, we were probably seated at a table within 15 minutes.  We got a $16 bottle of White Zinfandel which was quite good and a great bargain.  The service is very quick, but not rushed.  I also wasn't too cramped, despite being seated next to another couple at a four person table.\\n\\nFor appetizers, I got the caprese salad and my dining companion ordered the small fried calamari.  The caprese was advertised as having buffalo mozzarella, but it definitely didn't taste like buffalo mozzarella to me.  Decent quality fresh mozzarella, yes, but not buffalo.  It wasn't bad, but I was disappointed since they advertised it as being buffalo.\\n\\nThe fried calamari pretty much made up for it, though.  There was nothing small about it, and it was without a doubt the best fried calamari I've ever tasted.  It was tender, crispy, just wonderfully cooked and seasoned.  In my mind, if you eat here, you just have to have the calamari.  \\n\\nFor the main courses, I had the lobster ravioli, and she had a half lobster with pasta and Giacomo's Sauce.  The lobster ravioli was very well cooked, with a creamy garlic sauce.  The portions were quite large, especially for the half lobster and pasta dish.  Both meals were well cooked and quite good, although it doesn't blow you away like the fried calamari does.  I've heard that the butternut squash ravioli is the best one to order, and I'll have to try that the next time I come here.  I would recommend the lobster ravioli as well, though.\\n\\nOverall, the food is great here, the service is quick and adequate, and the prices are very good.  If you don't mind the wait, and the fast pace, as well as lack of desserts, it'll be a great experience for you.  The only thing stopping me from calling this a 5, is the fact that they failed to deliver the promised buffalo mozzarella with my caprese.  Other than that, it was great."},{"name":"New York China Buffet","address":"12173 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"Dear God, please keep other dopey tourists away from this garbage dump.

I follow Escobar lounge on Instagram and I've been wanted to try their food since the soft opening. We arrive at 130 pm on New Years Day. We sat at the bar and our waitress LuLu came up to us. She let us know that they didn't have the crab cakes today. This was disappointment a little because my friend and I both are Pescatarians. We asked if they can substitute the steak and eggs for salmon. She said they didn't have salmon. So I asked for shrimp. She said they couldn't substitute with that meal. So I asked for the shrimp to be substituted for the Escobar eggs and bacon. However, I wanted egg whites. Lulu placed the order. In the meantime I ordered a Bellini. She said they only had Chardonnay to make it. Last time I checked Bellinis were made with champagne. I told her that and she acted as if I didn't know what I was talking about. She went to make it, but then I told her forget it (I didn't trust she would make it correctly given her facial expression). I asked her for a drink called The Defendant( vodka, grand marnier, strawberries, & lime). Minutes later she drops off a clear drink in a champagne glass and walks off. I tasted it and to my amazement IT WAS A BELLINI WITH WINE! I told Lulu and she responded \\" Oh girl I had the Bellini on my mind\\"...she then said \\" you can keep that, I'll make your other drink. Lulu comes back and lets us know that they couldn't make our meal with egg whites because it's pre made with yoke. So we changed our order to a shrimp Caesar salad. Lulu said \\"they really don't serve salad until 4pm but I'll make it work. ( Mind you, the salad option was on the BRUNCH menu). 30-40 mins later just when we were about to leave. I see a salad plate come out. But right before my eyes I see another plate of food with SALMON on it. Mind you they said they didn't have salmon. Our salad comes and we tell Lulu we thought there wasn't any salmon. She says \\"Girl I can only do what they tell me\\"..in disbelief and HUNGER my friend and I ate our Caesar salad and 4 medium shrimps for $13. The shrimp tasted like boiled hotdogs NO LIE! I didn't notice because I was so hungry and my friend had to point it out. Anyways, after finishing, another lovely waitress asked us \\"is everything okay\\"? We all said \\"NO\\". We told her our situation, and she said \\"I'm so sorry. I wish I can help\\" and then walked away. Fast forward to when the checks come ( which we waited forever for) it had gratuity added already. My friend did not agree with them added it without written notice or informing us. She asked lulu about it and she went to find where it said it. After walking around and talking to her co workers she came back and told her to just subtract it from the total. We waited another 15 mins for her to pick up our check and bring back my change. Side note: The owner Snoop @whoissnoop on IG was sitting across from us the whole time. I contemplated letting her know about the salmon situation, but digressed. However, my friend was not happy that her change was not returned. So we asked another worker to have Snoop (the owner) come over. She came over and my friends asked is she was the owner she said \\"Yes\\". My friend said she wanted to share her experience with her and Snoop said \\"Is it a bad experience or good one\\"? Once she said it was a bad experience...Snoop (THE OWNER) said okay I'll get a manager. She then proceeded to put her hood on and walk out the back door. We waited another 10 minutes for my friend to get her change that Lulu forgot to give. Once her change was given we left. Needless to say...the \\"manager\\" never came. And if she did, I'm sure they wouldn't have been able to do anything with the messageTHE WORSE DINING EXPERIENCE EVER! I will not be coming back to Escobar tapas bar and lounge.

We love to go to tea and have been to many. My granddaughter knows a good tea party and this unfortunately was not one. The tea sandwiches were pitiful, very small (and small is an understatement...tiny or minute a better descriptor) and looked like they'd been sitting around for a day (yuck, there was one mystery meat...a thin brownish purple...not sure if it was ham or roast beef)...we left very hungry and ended up going out for dinner after the ballet. Further to the miserable (and very commercial) event - they packed us into a small banquet room...very overcrowded. The hope was that we could salvage the event with the activities the Taj planned for the children - cookie decorating - small table with only 4 icing tubes for many kids to share, one face painter....very long line and not enough time for all children to have their faces painted (parents waited in line - holding their kids' spot) while Mrs. Claus and an attendant had the kids running around the room looking for an elf. Mrs. Claus made a half-hearted statement telling the kids not to run but the kids nearly trampled each other as they were running around the crowded room looking for the elf....crazy! and the potential was there for an injury or two...ohhhh....and I forgot to to mention the price....very pricey...$57 for an adult, $27 (for a child who brought a teddy bear donation).

Craigie being known for all things pork, we decided to go with the crispy fried pig's tails for an appetizer, and a rabbit hash with fall vegetables for good measure. The pig's tails were definitely a highlight (if a little difficult to eat), but the hash was bland and unmemorable.\\n\\nOnto the main course, my mom decided to skip the burger and try the cod.

Words cannot express my disappointment. I have heard the term \\"umami\\" thrown around to extol the virtues of Craigie's burger, but mine was (dare I say) bland.

He seemed to get along well with his staff, although they all seemed much more relaxed when he was not around. hehe!

I think it adds a personal touch when the chef/owner interacts with the customers and it makes it seem like they are proud of their food.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that the vegetarian tasting menu did not leave me satisfied. I do not think I have ever left any restaurant still hungry before. I rarely finish meals so this was disappointing to me. The entree seemed more like a side than a meal.\\n\\nIt has been over a month since we dined here, so I will  just highlight some of the courses that I remember.\\n\\nThe trio to start was very interesting. Each of the bites was simply delicious! The potato tempura was something I had never had and was my favorite bite. The 2nd course was an avocado salad for me and a tartar with avocado salad for the husband. I like that they had the same flavors so we could discuss it. I have never enjoyed avocado quite so much!\\n\\nI had a consume with tempura squash flowers that was so good! The server said it was something that Chef Maws had never made before and I told him that it is something that he should add to the menu. It was light but so satisfying and perfect. \\n\\nThe gnocchi were my favorite part of the meal. They were cooked perfectly and had a wonderful texture. I wish they came in a slightly larger portion and were the main entree. The main entree was a grain pilaf with some root vegetables. I kept looking over at my husbands lamb with jealousy. I did not understand how my entree that looked like it should have been a side dish could have been served next to my husbands entree. As I said above, this was the only disappointing experience of the evening. It is unfortunate that it happened with my main entree.\\n\\nThey also had a mistake with our desserts. They mixed them up and gave me my husbands panna cotta which is normally made with geletan and not vegetarian. I asked about it when it was served. The waiter whisked it away and took it back to the kitchen to ask. He brought back the deserts and switched them so my husband had the panna cotta.\\n\\nWe both had a wonderful evening. I wish that we lived closer so we could become regulars. I would love to try the Sunday night whim. It sounds like a lot of fun! Considering how much I loved the consume that Chef Maws made on a whim the night we dined there, I would love to do the full course whims. I am sure my husband and I will be back to Craigie soon!

You need to close the outside door before they let you open the inner door. The problem with that is the space b/w outer and inner doors is not big enough for three big guys. They really dont care whether you are packed inside that space or not. They only care about the cold wind that they want to avoid from opening outer and inner doors. (This already shows that they don't bother to care customers' convenience.)\\n\\nImportant note about order: dont say fried calamari if you are not sure. they just put an order before even confirming with you. \\n\\nWe ordered one large fried calamari and one house special for three people. (they charge extra $10 for giving a plate to third person.) One of my friend was only going to eat calamari, but they told us that they still charge $10 for having a third person.

I have the utmost respect for restaurant and retail workers. Hardest workers for very little compensation. I have visited this location often. It has been about 6 months since my last visit, however so disappointed with my visit today. \\n\\nIt was not Taco Tuesday nor Throwback Thursday, we arrived about 11:40am and there were only a few tables seated in the restaurant. So I am not sure why it took 20 minutes to get our order and with not even an \\"I'm sorry\\"......The food of course was the saving grace. \\n\\nAlso, my husband and I could not  have a conversation while waiting because the music was so loud in this location. We had a hard time hearing when our name was called for the food from the front dining room (we sat in the back). \\n\\nThe kicker is when we went to leave and I went up front for a refill. There was only one person at the register and she was obviously very busy so I patiently waited. A manager came out from the back looked right at me and then another man walked up and asked for a refill. He helped him first. Even though I had been standing there for about 3 minutes. Then when he finished helping the gentleman he looked at me with a blank stare. I assumed he might be a robot with his lack of emotion or no effort to help me with my refill. So I asked him, \\"Please, a Mr. Pibb refill\\". He took my cup still not a word, refilled it, placed it in front of me spilling at the same time, still no word. So I thanked him. Obviously, a woman asking him for a refill seemed to really disrupt his day. The sad thing is, he was wearing a polo shirt and I am assuming is a manager. That's okay sir, I still love Tijuana Flats, just not your location and obviously you don't want me to come back. Sorry I bothered you with my business."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I'll start with the good stuff:  the food is AMAZING!!  The BF and I had the burrata appetizer (a mozzarella/cream ball over tomatoes with olive oil and basil), then he had linguini with scallops and the giacomo sauce and I had pumpkin tortellini.  The burrata was ok; nothing too fancy there, but the pasta dishes were incredible.  His scallops were cooked perfectly, and the lobster base for the tomato sauce really helped it go with the scallops.  The sauce for the pumpkin tortellini was mascarpone, and it was just sweet enough to really balance the pumpkin's savory flavor.  It was really rich, which meant I had leftovers, but I could really eat this dish for meals in a row and not get sick of it.  \\n\\nI decided to give Giacomo's only four stars despite the food being truly wonderful because the space and service were just so-so.  The restaurant is very small, so it's hard to get around - a woman from another table had to get out of her chair so that I could get to my seat.  The tables are very close together, so it's as if people are eating on top of each other.  That, and the fact that there was a line out the door and around the block by 6:30pm made me feel as if I had to eat as quickly as possible then get out.  The cramped space made it hard for the servers to get around, so we only saw our waitress when she came to take our order and then when she brought us our food and then the check.  \\n\\nAll in all, I will do my best to get back to Giacomo's (but definitely before 6:00!!)"},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Only came here for an ice mocha... wasn't expecting much but ended up ADDICTED!

It was christened Restaurant of the Year by the Oregonioan 2014.. People have bragged about flying to Portland from far flung reaches of the country just for the experience of dining at this place. All this hype, can Langbaan possibly be as good as everyone says it is?\\n\\nYes. Yes it is. Better, in fact. This is a flag-planting moment: From top to bottom, experience to cuisine, there is no better restaurant in Portland than Langbaan. Stick around and I'll give you the best bet for landing a table at this \\"must-dine\\" destination.\\n\\nBut first, what makes Langbaan so special? \\n\\nWell, first realize that this is Portland's premier haute cuisine. There is a lot of exciting food happening in PDX. We are going through a high-end pizza boom right now. We have French Laundry alumni here with their own creation. Butcatering to the high-end, Thomas Keller/Jose Andres/Joel Robuchon fan club is pretty rare. Obviously, Paley's Place comes to mind, at least as far as a prototypical white tablecloth restaurant is concerned. Le Pigeon has a good reputation in town, but I find the difference between Le Pigeon and Paley's is more about attitude than anything else. Pok Pok is a veritable restaurant empire, and is the only Portland-based restaurant brand name featuring a Michelin Star. But the only Portland restaurant that competes in the same general sphere of \\"excellence\\" across in terms of \\"THIS IS AN EXPERIENCE!\\" along the lines of the superstar Celebri-chef Restaurants is Beast. I do enjoy Beast quite a lot, but there are some issues I have with the experience (Namely: the community tables. It's a personal preference thing, I understand some people love that aspect of it, I don't. So sue me). \\n\\nLangbaan borrows from the best restaurant experiences in the world and put a distinctly Portland spin on it. The food and service will make you think you should be dressed to the nines, but the vibe has a distinct Portland laid-back attitude that will make you feel comfortable in shorts and flip-flops, if you prefer.\\n\\nThe food selection rotates monthly based on a theme, but there are some common threads to the presentation. Regardless, this place will have a few items that might test the limits of the less adventurous eater, but if you trust the kitchen (and why are you here if you don't?), then you'll enjoy even the things that sound a little scary.\\n\\nLike any restaurant with a prix fixe menu, the meal is divided up into a series of courses:\\n\\nFirst, snacks.Three bite-sized delights like shrimp in betel leaf, or the star of the appetizer show: coconut cream scallop in a crispy rice cup. \\n\\nSoup is next, a small bowl for each diner, and then the two-part salad course. The salads are imaginative, fun, unique.\\n\\nThe fourth course is the main course. Unlike the previous courses, all of the components of the main course come out at the same time so you can dabble in a myriad of flavors together. Our lineup: Massaman beef tongue curry (super tender, delicious beef flavor); grilled squab (medium rare, rich and delicious); and smoked trout put down a heavy (but delicious) contrast on the meal.\\n\\nFinal course is a two-part dessert. Unless you skip out on some of the food (and if you do, again, WHY ARE YOU HERE?!), you will not leave Langbaan hungry. They feed you.\\n\\nGenerally, I'm not a fan of wine pairing menus at places like this ($30 per person at Langbaan). I find that it's more enjoyable to just order the drinks you want, plus it is usually cheaper to do it this way.\\n\\nThe whole shebang costs a flat rate of $70 per person (really, $84 if you count the tip). Expensive? Yes, of course, but when you compare it with the type of restaurant this place is inevitably compared with, this place is a STEAL. Holdfast is $95 per person. Beast is $102. If you go to an equivalent place in, say, NY or LA, you're easily looking at $150-200 per person. This is a bargain for the dining experience it is.\\n\\nOkay, so how the hell do you get a table there? It's not easy, but it's possible. They are only open Thurs-Sun with two seatings per night, so you have to be vigilant. Naturally, you can go to the website at the very beginning of the week and book out the next-available reservation. Problem with that? You're not eating there for six months. \\n\\nThe alternative is simply go to the site and put your name on the waiting list for every single night between now and the end of the year. There are occasional cancellations and you will receive a text message when a table is available. You have 15 minutes to claim the table before they more to the next group on the list. Some weeks are more cancel heavy than others, but in my experience, you'll have the chance to book a table this method at least once a month.\\n\\nGood luck in booking a table, and enjoy!"},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"My friend brought me here in September of last year and I had to write a review because I've been raving about it ever since.\\n\\nHe had been there a few times and so called ahead to reserve his favorite table.

Very unimpressive presentation and nothing but just the meal, making a 17 dollar stuffed chicken breast and an 11 dollar burger ridiculous.\\n\\nthe Sig 'O got the stuffed chicken breast, and the meal was just that, no veggies, no bread, just mashed potatoes that tasted as if they came out of a box, white gravy with no taste.

I did a triple take when I realized that it wasn't a FedEx truck but a Tree House food truck!  Sweet, another foodmobile hits the scene in Orlando!  \\n\\nWhen I got home, I did a quick Google search  and came across their Twitter site to find they had perched themselves at the Ferncreek/Colonial Chevron gas station that so many other trucks have set up shop.  \\n\\nUpon approach of the Tree House Truck, a tall gentleman by the name of Thomas came from within to greet my girlfriend and I with a warm welcome.  He counseled us on their 10 oz. Tree House double burger, the Tree Trunk hot dog (a hot dog, burrito creation) and their Chimoo sandwich.  The Chimoo was described as seasoned chicken, skirt steak, red cabbage coleslaw, sweet potato fries and mango barbecue sauce in between Pan Sabao (sweet bread).  When he finished listing the ingredients, I immediately ordered up a Chimoo.\\n\\nWhile waiting for our sandwich, Thomas graciously came back out with a sample tray of their \\"Treedillas\\".  Provolone, sauteed onion and chicken between flour and sun dried tomato tortillas.  Topped with crusted Parmesan cheese.  Simply delicious.\\n\\nThen the Chimoo was served to us in all it's glory.  We were surprised to basically see a foot long sub, cut in half.  Attempting to close the tray would result in a smashed sandwich.  It was that big.  Upon taking our first bite, it took seconds to express how flavorsome it was.  Eyebrows were raised in surprise, smiles were stretched and a feeling of gratification took hold.  A fabulous juxtaposition of sweet and savory flavors.

I am always excited about what could be on the menu on any given day.  The guys aren't afraid to experiment and do things that might be a little unusual, they may not even always work but they will always give it a shot! The other best part about this truck is that they really encourage feedback and are very active on their twitter.  If you think something is really working/not working you can let them know! \\n\\nI have to deny the 5th star for a couple reasons: 1 is consistency, 2 is it would be nice if we could choose the cooking temperature on our burgers.  \\n\\nThe Chimoo is the flagship sandwich at the treehouse, and with good reason.  The first Chimoo I had was absolute perfection.  Delicious, succulent chunks of ribeye steak and chicken that had been properly marinated and cooked just right, crispy asian style slaw, subtly sweet mango bbq sauce, and crispy sweet potato fries nestled into a fresh and just slightly crusty roll.  It's one of those sandwiches that you take a bite and sit there moaning for a few minutes.  However here's where the inconsistency comes in: I've never had the same chimoo twice!! Sometimes the meat is a little dry, like it hasn't been marinated long enough.  Or maybe there's not quite enough slaw or bbq sauce, or maybe the sweet potato fries aren't quite crispy enough.  The past few times the guys have been trying out different breads for it, none of which had that crusty crunch i was looking for.  But even when it's not as good, it's still pretty darned good.  \\n\\nI have been quite impressed with both the megalo and king caesar burgers (the megalo had a little too much pesto my first time but was perfection the second)  I would like to be able to get these burgers medium rare instead of the medium-medium well-ish they usually get cooked to.  \\n\\nA recent \\"specialty: the MIA burger, was a real standout  A tasty 1/2 lb angus patty wrapped in prosciutto, topped in gooey brie and arugula with a caramelized onion jam.  \\n\\nOverall this truck has a very special place in my heart.

It's got a nice cosy New York bar decor, with the black and white pictures, no TVs and casual dining music. Then, you get here and it's bumper to bumper packed with people. There's no room to move let alone mingle. It's not designed for the crowd. So it just makes mingling uncomfortable. I know it's not their fault that they are the popular kid in town, but trust me with fewer people you'll start to enjoy the allure and coolness of the ambiance. With the crowd, you're just trying to order a drink and hopefully not spill it.\\n\\nAlso, because of their popularity they've rested on their laurels. The bar staff is cocky to a T, only serving with charm the cute chicks and deep pocketed guests. Those of us that sadly do not fall into either category are just served after a long long time. The only bar staff worth it is Doug, if not for him I would have been a very thirsty gal. Very thirsty. \\n\\nFinally, the prices. I guess they can charge these exorbitant prices because...(1) they are popular and, (2) people would patronize them either way. I mean $9.50 for a side of asparagus comprised of only 7 asparagus, and then, the same cost for a half plate of calamari. Plus, all the good wines are priced above $10. I know my wine so trust me when I say this...Wine below that price is not worth drinking. Once again, appealing to the people with deep pockets. \\n\\n\\nSo, no I will not be back here unless, (a) I score a boyfriend with deep pockets, or (2) it stops being the toast of the town and starts working hard to retain customers, now they're just lazy."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Kel makes the best Chocolate Martini in Atlanta.

It defeats the purpose of both the chain (which is to provide a standardized experience) and Yelp (which is to highlight unique experiences).  However, the installation of a Moe's, typically a southern chain, in Waltham is notable enough to me to deserve some attention.\\nI've eaten at Moes in the southland, and they are a worthy competitor to other American-style burrito-factory food joints.  Everyone has their preference among the Chipotles, the Qdobas, On the Border, Baja Fresh, etc.  Moes is not significantly better or worse than any of this crowd, but would be hard pressed to compete with Anna's in greater Boston (or Freebirds in Texas).  They offer free nacho chips and a salsa bar, which is a welcome innovation.\\nThe Moes in Waltham is particularly welcome as there is no direct local competition in the mass-market burrito category (since Tango Mango turned into a bar), and also non-burger-joints open after 8:00 PM on any night are hard to find indeed.  It's not on Moody St, but it is near enough ample parking to make it a go-to place for a bona fide burrito emergency, or for the casual lunch crowd.\\n\\nFor your regular Mexican food craving, however, there are many more options about... Waltham is a community rich in Latino culture and the market reflects that.\\n\\nFor this particular location, I have to say that the warmth of the service was top-notch.  The burrito slingers were certainly cheerful (beyond the mandatory 'Welcome to Moes' salutation that seems to be pissing all the crabby New England Yelpers off), and I have to say that the girl who was happily rolling my burrito somehow managed to smile at me with her entire body as she wished me a good day. Which was amazing in and of itself.  Maybe the management is putting something in the company Kool-ade, and if they are, it's awesome. I hope they dump some in the Charles.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the food is a bit on the bland side.  I suspect that this is because they're trying to please as many people as possible and a good section of New Englanders have low tolerance for oleocapsicum.  Chipotles gets around this with their rack of Tabasco bottles, and maybe Moes could stand to do the same... the only sauce I could see (besides the salsa cart) had to be ordered at the time of rolling.  Since I didnt know what to expect, I didnt order any... but some to pour down the bore of my burrito mid-munch would have added quite a bit to the experience.\\nThe other gripe I have is the space-age Coke dispenser guarantees a line of at least three people at all times.  When you've got a standard bank of soda spouts, you can get through it quickly because it doesnt confuse Grandma and it's not rude to use a spout that the person in front of you isn't.  But in this case... you're guaranteed a three minute wait while the person in front of you prods and pokes at the interface.  I opted for the tea instead, just to skip the line.  And it was a good tea selection, with sweet, non, and green... but if you want to win my heart, you need lemonade in the lineup as well.\\n\\nSo all in all, I'd like to welcome Moe's to Main Street.  It's a tough market, but I'm sure if they can shrug off all the haters and keep smiling, they'll do well on the healthier side of Waltham's fast food offerings.  After all, you can't eat Subway for lunch every day."},{"name":"Bite","address":"470 W Sr 434","city":"Longwood","stars":"3.5","text":"The fries are great. The hotdogs are just average.

I also have friends who are Senegalese and have enjoyed their cooking.\\n\\nTeranga simply sucks.\\n\\n(1) Bissap juice :  This is simply hibiscus flower juice.  Very good, but hibiscus juice is always good.\\n(2) Bouye (baobab) juice:  First time I've had this, and it was very good.\\n(3) Bread:  Slightly stale thin toasted sourdough bread with some kind of brown oily thin soupy sour onion-based dip.  Not good.\\n(4) Fataya:  Deep fried triangular fish pastries, like small empanadas.  Flavorful with a creamy sriracha-accented sauce.\\n\\nNow comes the gastronomic horror:\\n\\n(5) Thiebou Djeun:  If you are going to represent this as the national dish of Senegal, then you'd better pull off a fantastic dish.  ** It was horrible. **  For the quality and quantity, way overpriced at $15.\\n\\n---  Fish:  Supposedly \\"herb stuffed.\\"  I didn't see any herbs in the very small cut we received.  Notably, friends of the owner, who were seated next to us, received HUGE portions.  We only got an approximately 5 inch x 2 inch cut of dried-out thick white fish with lots of bones and a distinctly fishy (ie, not fresh) odor.\\n--- Broken rice: Decently flavored with the cooking sauce.  But how could someone screw up rice?\\n--- Veggies: Count one small chunk of carrot, one bite of eggplant, one bite of cassava, one medium cauliflower floret, one bite of pumpkin, and some flecks of cabbage.  There was not enough veggies to even get a sense of how they contributed to the dish.  (Of course, the owner's friends next to us got heaping portions.)\\n\\n(6) Mafe:  A lamb stew with meat featuring a lot of gristle and way heavy, gamey flavor, swimming in an oily ground nut (AKA peanut) sauce.  My husband had to keep spitting out gristle, whereas I just gave up and swallowed it.  Portion?  Could not have been more than one commercial-sized ladle.  We're talking TINY for $14.\\n\\n(7) Thiacry:  Advertised as a thin pudding with couscous, tropical fruit, and raisins, it came to us at room-temperature, with the \\"couscous\\" tough, grainy -- essentially undercooked.  I suspect the grain was not the Middle Eastern couscous that I am familiar with, as the pudding -- really just a thin sauce -- featured dark brown chewy kernels.  I've seen a similar dark brown grain, whose name escapes me, in pan-African groceries.  While this dessert was passable, we were not given any tropical fruit, even though I asked straight-up for the whole shebang.  When an ingredient is labelled optional on the menu, as the tropical fruit was, then are you automatically opted in or out?  Confusing.  The four raisins did not cut it.  The entire thing did not cut it for $6.\\n\\n(8)  Creme rose:  Described as a sorrel-flavored creme brulee, this dish was horrendous.  We broke through the caramelized crust only to find a room-temperature thick soupy pink mess.  I was certainly NOT going to pay $6 for this, and so after some effort, I successfully flagged down the waitress.  I told her that creme brulee is supposed be like soft-set custard or flan, not some thick soupy mix.  She then lectured me about how I have to realize this is AFRICAN food, and is different from what I may be used to.  I then told her that I have Senegalese friends, that I know that the French colonized Senegal and left a legacy of French-influenced food, and that when someone says \\"creme brulee\\", they likely mean a soft-set custard or flan with a caramelized crust, not this mockery.\\n\\nSimply because this is a Senegalese restaurant (and please, people, do not refer to Teranga as an African restaurant -- Africa is a continent, not a country), does not mean it is exempt from clear-eyed criticism.  Those who wax eloquent about the food here, including the New York Times and the Boston Globe, blind themselves with their desire to be hip, cool, and PC (\\"I had Senegalese food and it was the bomb!\\").  Saying Teranga is bad is NOT the equivalent of saying all Senegalese food is bad, or that Senegal is bad.  I've had great Senegalese food, and Teranga is NOT it.\\n\\nBad food is bad food, and the chef's ethnicity is irrelevant."},{"name":"Jax 5th Avenue Deli and Ale House","address":"951 Greenwood Blvd","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"3","text":"The food is absolutely horrible and the service is even worse.\\nWe waited for over an hour for a hamburger and it took them 3 times to get the order right.

There were diners occupying two booths of the 20 (I'm guessing) lining each side of the restaurant.  It's not a big place, but it's clean and the decor is kitchy, Americanized mexi style. The painted murals are colorful, as is the festive music.  We were seated.  I noted a sign stating \\"Present Coupon When Ordering\\", so I prepared to do that. \\n\\nOne nice thing to note - they do bring you a free basket of chips and sides of salsa and bean dip. Good thing, though, because we might have starved while waiting for someone to come take our order.\\n\\nAs I scanned the menu, I noticed that just about every section of the menu stated (in RED) coupon exclusions.  One of the coupons I held in my possession was for 'Fajitas for Two\\".  Even the Fajitas segment of the menu showed the red 'Coupon Exclusion' notice.  I brought this up with our waiter, who waved it off, saying \\"it's ok.\\" \\n\\nAnother thing:  The drink menu...  Someone had made the poor decision of using a marker to re-write the drink prices in at about $2 more per drink.  We customers don't particularly like seeing this, AND it looks sloppy and unprofessional. Also, some of the drinks - particularly the margaritas - did not show a price.  I didn't want to ask, because doing so makes me feel like I'm being cheap. So I just didn't order a drink. \\n\\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The red coupon exclusions on the menu and the prominent sign made me feel awkward and patronized. Sure, I brought in a coupon. That means that your incentivized direct marketing is WORKING!  I know you pay a lot of money for this type of advertising, so you should be thrilled when someone comes in with a coupon, NOT make them feel like a cheapskate. Also, about 80% of those people coming in and presenting a coupon are FIRST TIME CUSTOMERS - like me.  We want you to show us a good time and feed us good food, so that we'll come back and also tell our friends.  (Sorry - this is more a note to the shop management). \\n\\nThe service was also very slow for such a quiet night.  At one point before we'd ordered food (but were noshing on the free basket of chips with bean dip and salsa). \\n\\nWhen the food did arrive, I must say, I was happy.  Standard Fare fajitas, with all the fixings - beans, rice, lettuce, pico, sour cream and guacamole (though only about a rounded tablespoon of each of the latter).  The meat (chicken and steak) was rather good and tender, but lacking in spice.  The peppers and onions were cooked perfectly. We left feeling full and satisfied.  Due to using the coupon, our total bill was surprisingly low.  We'll probably be back another time to see if the slow service was a fluke... and maybe I'll work up the nerve to talk to the manager about the menu faux pas."},{"name":"Kika Tapas","address":"5 Broad Canal Way","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"we hosted a small party for work at kikas tapas, and overall we really enjoyed the experience from booking to completion. \\n\\nkikas made it really easy for us to arrange the party, and offered pre-paid options with selections of tapas, wine, beer, and sangria. when we arrived, the space was completely ready for us, including tables with ice water, lemons, limes, and flatware. we had a smaller group to start, and we appreciated that they checked in to determine the right time to bring out the food platters so it would not get cold. the waitstaff also checked in frequently with our guests to see if anyone needed refills.\\n\\nthe bar offered two sangria options that were both really good. my favorite was the red, which was fruity and sweet, and the white sangria was tart with a nice orange flavor. we selected four tapas options: spicy potatoes, lobster ravioli, baked goat cheese, and the empanadas. the potatoes were a surprising favorite, crispy on the outside and light on the inside with a flavorful sauce. the ravioli had a great sauce, but were a little light on the filling. similarly, i enjoyed the pastry of the empanada but wish they had more beef and chicken filling. the baked goat cheese was okay as a dip for the bread and a little awkward to serve for the large group.\\n\\ni would look forward to going back both with a large group and for a fuller dinner to try more of the tapas."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if I was in the area, I would eat here.

Luce only takes reservations for parties of 5 or more, so we knew we were taking a chance walking in as a four top at 7pm. No worries, the server told us we could wait in their space next door an enjoy a glass of wine while we waited. Several other parties were waiting, so we knew it would be a while, but were happy as long as we could talk and enjoy a bottle of wine. 10 minutes passed nothing. 20 minutes. 30 minutes.

Finally a different server came out with a bottle and four glasses and went gave the wine to a different table!

They were waiting just as long as us) we started to get pretty hangry. Close to one hour in we grabbed a server and said, \\"Can we please get the bottle of wine we ordered almost an hour ago?\\" She looked confused as if she couldn't understand why we had not received it.

I looked at my watch and it had only been 53 minutes. Oopsie! Guess that makes the wait time for a gd bottle of wine reasonable.

Oh my bad, I should have made a res -- except that parties of four can't make a reservation! We tried to explain that we would have been happy to wait, if we could just get a drink in a reasonable amount of time. She made excuse after excuse. They were busy (no shit, but there's only about ten tables in the restaurant and two were empty). She wanted to give the patrons the best experience possible (no shit, but don't tell people to go have a drink, if you can't handle opening one bottle of wine within one hour).

Basically, unless you have a nice private seat by the window or wall, you will likely be apologizing or apologized to throughout your meal as the waiting staff or other guests try to squeeze behind your chair in a space that is just not big enough. It sort of adds to the character to the place, if you don't mind it (big if) -- and really, it's this sort of crammed, almost intimate feel that permeates the place. The waiting staff seemed always in a rush, but our table was never forgotten and never left waiting for long. They had a bluntness to them that was almost endearing, familial in a way, as though they were too busy waiting on you and serving you delicious food to be polite for the sake of it. The kitchen is visibly tiny behind the counter, so you know that they're just as pressed for space as you are.

I'm local and been here, and at their previous location, many times.  Something has changed though.  The menu is smaller and offerings haven't changed in quite some time.  The wine prices have gone up significantly - my favorite used to be $22 now it's $30.  The food prices are higher but the food seems less inspired and the portions, while right-sized for the most part, seem smaller.  The real increase is in the add ons - want a salad then $$, want steak fries then $$, it's just gotten out of control.  The chef seems to be a bit arrogant too; new little white chef's coat and running about looking to be noticed.  I'd rather his old style - in the kitchen designing a killer menu with new & interesting takes on the classics and making sure each & every meal is perfect.  And lastly the staff. . . wonderful, friendly & quirky but, sadly lacking in serving skills and s-l-o-w, very slow.  Water takes 10 minutes to get to the table, wine/beer at least 10 minutes, food, well let's just say it takes a bit.  Time to get back to basics - the things that got you here - a inspired and creative menu which changes seasonally, perfectly executed food well priced and fair pricing on your wines.

I love good barbecue and if there's one thing I know for certain, it's never to mess with perfection (in this case, traditional barbecue sauces).  The Salt Lick does get a thumbs up for having all-you-can-eat though, I've never found a place that did that before.  Also, excellent wait staff (I'm talking about you Sarah).

I'd definitely do it again.\\n\\nAlthough check-in was 3:00, the room wasn't actually ready for me until about 4:30.  Nothing I couldn't take in stride:  I simply waited in the Zeus Caf√©, on the hotel's ground floor, where I was able to charge my phone and use the WiFi.\\n\\nThe room itself was very nice:  artistically done with appealing colors.  I had chosen this hotel specifically because I wanted something comfortable but a little off the beaten path.  I wasn't disappointed.\\n\\nThe rooms don't have individual bathrooms; rather, there were about four on the floor where I was staying.  The bathrooms were small but entirely adequate and gave the impression of being regularly cleaned.  Although they're community bathrooms, I never had to wait for one.  As for washcloths, towels, soap, &c., such necessities were provided in the bedroom.\\n\\nThe hotel has a number of artistic touches:  each room has a distinct title painted on the door.  The walls are decorated with both decals and framed pictures or perhaps newspaper articles and the like.  The room itself had various sayings on the walls, done with wall decal lettering, and the bed's headboard was likewise decorated to coordinate with the room's title.\\n\\nI didn't deal much with the staff, though as I was checking out, I did ask the gentleman about the music that happened to be playing in the small lobby area, and he told me he thought it was Philip Glass--based in part on the style.

Not only was it my goodbye-for-now dinner with Josephine L, it was one of her favorite restaurants. And considering the height of her standards combined with her breadth of food-savvy, I was predestined to click with Craigie as instantaneously as I clicked with her.  As it turns out, my attempt to love Craigie bore a much closer resemblance to my attempt to love swimming. I tried all the strokes, and I tried the 6-course chef's whims with the same enthusiasm, but I left not completely impressed and feeling like I wanted to swim with fins.\\n\\nSome highlights from my chef's whims:\\nThe Tuna Sashimi was amazingly fresh, and the toasted garlic topper made it absolutely exceptional.\\nThe Potato and Green Onion Vichyssoise with oxtail pastrami is as green as sea glass, and the light, crisp green onion evenly balances the rich, heavy potato perfectly. I love skillfully-made soups, and this one is no exception.\\nThe venison sausage, suckling pig confit, and grilled pork belly with cherry coulis was amazing. The sausage was a bit too rich and salty, but the gamey flavor of venison is always welcome on any plate of mine. Grilled pork belly is guaranteed to be fantastic as long as it's not cooked grievously poorly, but this one was perfectly seared. The fatty sweet-meats of the confit and belly fit my definition of umami to a tee.\\n\\nMy one huge issue was that the they had the nerve to charge the Strawberry Sorbet palate cleanser, a one-inch ball of sorbet, as a full course. When we complained, the manager handled it quickly and politely, thus the only deductions earned were applied to our check and not to my star rating of Craigie. The service here is the stuff of legends.\\n\\nDessert did end our tasting on a high note as my Coconut Sorbet with pumpernickel, bing cherries, and chocolate crumbs was simultaneously rich and refreshing and Josephine's Apricot Frangipane Torte was yet another tasty conclusion.\\n\\nSadly, all good things must come to an end, and I tearfully bid Craigie a premature, untimely goodbye, much like the one I bid Josephine at the conclusion of our meal. I will see Josephine again and I hope it will be soon, but I'm not sure I'll see Craigie again, even in the remote future."},{"name":"McMenamins Crystal Hotel","address":"303 SW 12th Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Awesome for pool, shuffleboard, live music, and beer.

And in these ways, Ruth's did not fail - but some times it's the little things that can make the difference between a good evening and a great one.\\n\\nMy husband, my 9-month-old baby, and I chose to go to Ruth's Chris for Christmas dinner.  Our dinner reservation was for 4:15pm, and we arrived at the restaurant about five minutes before.  The hostess told us that our table was not yet ready and offered to escort us to the lounge.  The lounge was somewhat busy for early Christmas evening, but there were several high-tops and tables available.  Because the baby was in the carseat, we opted for a regular table...but upon sitting down noticed that the table had not been cleaned (gross!).  We went to the next table which was also covered in food and sticky stains.  Finally, we moved to a two person high-top - which was ackward because we had to keep the baby on the floor in the carseat.  About 10 minutes went by before a server came to our table and took our drink order.  At no time were we offered a highchair for the baby whom I felt was in the way of a high-traffic area.  The drinks arrived quickly and our server diappeared again.  Around 4:35, my husband went to check on our table and was told they would seat us now.  As we walked to our table, it occured to us that the server never came back or offered us the bill - so techically, the service was so slow and unattentive that we could have \\"wined and ditched.\\"  Instead, we told our waiter to add it to our bill once we were seated (lucky lounge server!).\\n\\nWe were seated in the lower level of the restaurant which was intimate and cozy.  I was kind of surprised to pass a lobster tank displayed near the bathroom (what is this? A tacky lobster shanty?), but it seemed to be standard steakhouse decor.  With the baby finally situated in a highchair, we ordered from our waiter who was very pleasant and helpful:\\n\\nAppetizers: my husband got the shrimp cocktail with extra horseradish and I got the crab stuffed mushrooms.  I thought the shrimp was very well cleaned and they were certainly jumbo in size.  My mushrooms were delicious as well, with just enough butter sauce without overpowering the dish.\\n\\nSalad Course: we chose to split th Cesears salad with extra anchovies. Unfortunately, the dish initially came without any anchovies. Our server was quick to fix the error, but made it quite clear that it wasn't his fault and that the blame should be placed on the kitchen. I mean, we weren't upset about the lack of anchovies or anything, so his defensiveness and scapegoating was kind of surprising.\\n\\nEntrees: My husband ordered the filet minion and I ordered the scallop with spinach special. We ordered french fries and onion rings as sides. I'd like to comment that although their online menu doesn't mention a lot of seafood options, I was happy that there were several available in the restaurant (I'm not a big steak eater). Anyway, my husband's filet was cooked well and very flavorful, and my scallops were perfect (not chewy, nice seat, etc.). The sides were just okay - I wouldn't necessarily order the fries again (they were kind of bland), but the onion rings were delicious.\\n\\nDessert: the baby started getting a little fidgety (we were out for about 3 hours, so he was itching to get free of the carseat) and we were full, so we ordered the bread pudding to-go. It was very heavy so I was concerned that it would be too dense, but when we reheated it and the whiskey sauce at home the next day, we found it light and airy.\\n\\nOverall, we enjoyed the food at Ruth's Chris - but one of the little things that made the difference between a four-star and three-star experience was the lack of amenities for babies/kids. As a new mom, I understand that not all restaurants are kid friendly, but the fact that Ruth's Chris offers high chairs when making a reservation suggests otherwise. However, the bathrooms do not offer changing tables  and since they can be easily installed as a folding table in the handicap stall, there is no reason not to have one available. I guess they don't want dirty diapers in their trash cans, but I wish they had told me this when I made the reservation and mentioned I was bringing a baby.  So between that, the delay with our reservation and the experiences we had in the lounge (dirty and poor service), I think three-stars is a good assessment of our evening."},{"name":"In a Pickle Breakfast & Lunch","address":"655 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"4","text":"Awesome Restaurant! \\nWe have been traveling to Waltham ( from Albany, NY) for medical reasons and have went to a few restaurants...we had no luck with breakfast until we found In A Pickle!

It could rival restaurants in Northern Thailand and it would have no problem getting business there. The details are impeccable down to the wall art, music, and tablecloths. The menu is authentic and the cocktails are amazing. The service, however, could use some work. \\n\\nWhile checking in the girl at the front desk seemed a little annoyed with us and while we were asking a question sort of cut us off and said, \\"I need a name for the list\\" there was not a line behind us so not sure why it was so important I couldn't even finish my sentence, which was to ask a question about the drinks, but, okay. Not a huge deal. I gave her the name for the list and then we could ask our question. It was odd but not a deal breaker. \\n\\nWhile we waited for our table we got cocktails and they came out super fast and were super delicious! Once seated our waiter came over quickly and was really nice and helpful and you could tell he cares a lot about the food. Then it all went...weird....and passive aggressive.\\n\\n It all seemed to start because my husband asked about his beer. He had ordered a beer and it had been around 10 minutes. We both had had cocktails the previous round which came quicker so we assumed if was forgotten; genuinely not a big deal, it's a busy place, it happens. My husband asked a waitress about it and said,\\"hi, I order a beer a bit ago but I haven't gotten it. Could you grab it for me?\\" The waitress was super nice about it and my husband said, \\"thank you!\\" and all was well. \\n\\nBut then things with our waiter got weird. Our original waiter came by (and the person who I think was shadowing him) and they BOTH mentioned the beer. The man shadowing was actually holding the beer so it wasn't weird he said, \\"he's your beer!\\" But then the waiter parroted him, \\"here's  the BEER\\" it was just a little odd. And it made us feel uncomfortable like we had done something wrong. My husband wasn't mad that his beer hadn't arrived....he only asked because it had taken less time to get cocktails so he thought maybe it was forgotten. We only asked someone that wasn't our waiter because she happened to be helping the table next to us. We weren't trying to be sneaky or \\"get him in trouble.\\"\\n\\nAnyway, for the rest of the meal we were ignored. All three tables near us were interacted with. Asked about the meal. Asked if they wanted dessert. Asked if they wanted more drinks. We got nothing. We finished our food and drinks without one person speaking to us and then sat there with these things empty without one person speaking to us. A guy came by to clear the plates at some point, didn't ask how the meal was, if we wanted more drinks, if we wanted dessert (although the table next to us had been asked all of these things) and I swear, he took everything besides the empty beer bottle, and never came back for it while we were there.Passive aggressive much? \\n\\nSo then we ask for the bill. Again, no one asked if our food was good, if we wanted anything, etc. my husband had his card out when the waiter (our original waiter) comes back with the bill but he doesn't take it then, he just sets it on the table and walks away. Very professional. Finally after about 5 minutes he came back. Again, apparently no interest in how our meal was. \\n\\nWe did leave him a tip (~14%) but mostly out of social pressure rather than because we think he deserved it. It was honestly worse than bad service we have had, because it just made us so uncomfortable.  We weren't sure what we did wrong but it was obviously something. \\n\\nI would highly recommend eating here but just be careful, staff offend easily, I guess."},{"name":"WINGS Granville","address":"1162 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Great location at the south end of Granville with a small street facing patio.

They make them fresh, so you pick what kind of shell you want and what kind of filling, and then they make them. I got the chocolate-dipped, ricotta-filled cannoli, and it was delicious. I've had cannolis before, but not like this one. Initially I thought it might be too much for me to finish by myself, but I gobbled it up. There were also plenty of other pastries, pies, and cakes to pick from, which can be overwhelming, so if you're visiting, I would suggest just getting the cannoli (but I know I'm also biased).\\nService and ambiance: 5/5\\nIt wasn't very busy when I was there (Monday early afternoon), which was nice because there as no wait.

I am just kicking myself.\\n\\nOkay, this review is not to be taken lightly. \\nThe Porter Beer Bar's name is a little deceiving. It is so so much more than beer, but let's start there anyway.\\n\\nDecisions, decisions. The Porter has a list of beers so long it makes you want to cry out in joy and each of their staff is quite educated in the ways of brewcraft. We usually come in on the weekdays for lunch and our regular 'friend on staff' is Justin. He knows our beer preferences and immediately brings us a sample of his individual recommendations for each of us. 9 times out of 10, we agree with him. Rarely do I have the same beer every time. These beers are not 'network tv', my friend, they're barely 'cable' but man oh man they got the 'Pay-Per-View' of beers in stock. They've got high-gravity, dark, light, heavy, pink, stuff I can't pronounce, foreign, local, very foreign, cheap, expensive, call a cab after 2 sips; so much beer. And if you were wondering whether they have a stamp & passport beer club, I will gladly answer, NO.\\n\\nNow here is what boggles my mind...\\nTheir Head Chef and co-owner Nick Rutherford is a saint with a skillet. What this guy does with food is so amazing it's stupid. We actually use this 'Stupid' reference often when describing meals at The Porter. How can you deliver such a stupid meal for such a great price? Anywhere else in town a meal like that would cost you your first born. And did I mention they use as much local organic food as they can get their hands on? And ice creams, breads, noodles, and sausages are made right there.They also have the most addicting Belgian Fries [queque dreamy eyes]. \\nThey have 2 menus. They have a static menu (stays the same) and a very dynamic (changes often) front page menu. This dynamic menu is not what you'd expect from a bar, but I think by this point you've gathered...this is no regular bar. This front page menu will have you looking around for white table cloths and fancy napkins. Just to give you and example, recently they had Vindaloo Hanger Steak, Sweet Corn Ravioli, and Brasstown Pork & Foie Gras Terrine. Not only that but they have a recommended beer pairings for each one.I Know, Right?! Almost makes me never want to leave Atlanta. \\n\\nWith the caliber of food, service and selection, I can confidently say this place ranks up there with Woodfire Grill. Solidly.

The cashier was friendly and gave her opinions of certain dishes being that it was my first time there. My best friend ordered the tilapia with rice and cilantro slaw, with the Boneheads Shrimp appetizer ( we were 'HOOONGRY!' Not just hungry, but HOOONGRY! ), while I also got the tilapia with rice and asparagus. I also had this sauce on the side that my best friend recommended. The name escapes me, but it was good. Shoot, the entire entree was delicious! The tilapia was very tasty, the seasoned rice with its blend of spices was great, and the asparagus was just right. \\n   All in all, I definitely plan to visit Boneheads again.

Instead of iceberg lettuce with some dressing I got a sizable bowl of mixed greens, radish slices, carrots, and cherry tomatoes. Could've used a little more dressing, but overall very crisp and light.\\n\\nFor sushi, I started with the Ice Man and a simple avocado roll. The avocado roll was pretty standard, but well made and fresh. The Ice Man had a healthy serving of crab (krab?) salad on top with tempura in the middle, drizzled with a nice sauce. Again, it tasted fresh and unique. The final roll I got was the Mr. Fancy Roll, which was recommended by the server as their most popular item--and with good reason. The spicy tuna had a good kick to it, with creamy avocado and yellowtail to cool it down. The simple addition of micro greens on the top made for a nice presentation and was something I hadn't seen much on sushi before. \\n\\nThe restaurant also offers pho, which I got to try. While it was tasty, it came with smaller amounts of herbs and \\"accessories\\" than you would get at a Vietnamese restaurant. With so many good pho places around, the sushi was definitely the highlight of the menu. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, our experience definitely started out sub-par. We were one of only three tables, but somehow our server was never informed so we sat waiting for quite some time.

None of us ordered oysters, unfortunately, which looking backs, reflects poorly on all of us. The fried food was all delicious, lightly fried and not too greasy. The fried fish sandwich was delicious but problem was the amount of mayonnaise they put on it and the coleslaw, which was cloyingly sweet. If you get anything that comes with fried food, get the togarishi aioli. It sounds weird, but it's so good. It's sweet, spicy, pungent all at once -  the flavors hit with a punch.

It is now a Thai Tapas place with Thai cocktails and everything we had was delicious,interesting and reasonable. The dishes are a bit of a nouvelle, fresh, upscale take on Thai, but without the high prices. We started with the handmade golden crowns, so tasty with ground shrimp and chicken, with the tangy cucumber sauce being a perfect compliment. The Thai Sangria is maybe the most yummy sangria I have ever had! The rose, basil and fresh pineapple and ginger combination was so fresh and multi-layered I wanted to have 10! There were other cocktails that sounded interesting, and we will be back to try them. You have to try the paradise beef, it's marinated and deep fried and melts in your mouth! We wanted to have more, but also wanted to save room for our entrees. The Pad Thai was excellent, we had it with shrimp and tofu. The seafood typhon was excellent, light and tasty with the perfect amount of spice to it. We loved the green curry duck with the tiny thai eggplants, a great mix of flavors, even took just the sauce home to mix with vegetables the next day. All the dishes had great presentation, and the new decor is lovely and relaxing.

The menu consists of choosing a seafood and a sauce and they'll whip it up for you.  I recommend the fracomo sauce! It's nice and spicy and tastes amazing.  I got the mixed seafood also and there was a ton of clams, mussels, and calamari.  Portions are enough to split one for two people and the fried calamari is a good appetizer.

As Mike Y. told me, this is \\"what you eat when you hate yourself.\\"  Whatevs, Mike.\\n\\nFor many years, McDonald's has perfected its food preparation process so anyone can make it, and it for the most part, consistently tastes the same across the board, whether it's a McDonald's in Dunwoody, Georgia or McDonald's in Pullman, Washington (random geography trivia: where the Washington State University is located).\\n\\nHowever, the fine folks at McDonald's Perimeter still managed to screw up my combo.  The amount of fries they put in my large fry box was about the size of a medium fry.  What the heck.  When I pulled that large fry box out of the bag, I could barely see any golden sticks peeking out from the top edge of the front face.  Fail.\\n\\nAt least the Big Mac was good, as always.  I noticed they put a tad bit more than the usual amount of that oh so delicious Big Mac sauce into my burger.\\n\\nSo, despite the french fry fail, I will still give this Mickey D's a Yelp three-star \\"A-OK\\" rating for the mere fact that this is one of the newer McDonald's.

As their special, choose 4 tapas from most of their menu for $25.

It was delicious!\\n\\nWe had two servers throughout the evening who gave our table lots of attention during our long meal, so I would say service is good here. A couple of qualms I have about this place: they would not seat our party of 4 until everyone arrived, which is understandable, however, there is no waiting area, so people were crowding the entrance and the host stand. I positioned myself next to a table to wait on my friends, which I'm sure the guests found annoying. The other thing I did not enjoy about this place was how many people they try to squeeze in their dining areas. When I was getting up to leave, I had to circle around the back wall of our table because a table over, the lady was so far back she was sitting with her back against our table.

The food and our waitress were, overall, very good. \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I ordered and enjoyed a traditional pizza with pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, peppers, red sauce, and mozzarella. The flavor was there. Wood-fired ovens tend to overcook a pizza quickly and the toppings on our pie were well cooked, if a bit underdone and the crust was very chewy-- not much of a crunch to add to the overall texture, something we both thought would have perfected an otherwise well done pie. \\n\\nWe also ordered the pork meatballs that were very nicely cooked, juicy, and flavorful... we both thought we noticed a hint of Frank's red hot sauce in there...\\n\\nWhere things went south were, before ordering our food, my girlfriend requested to be moved to a booth. I understand, in a rather busy restaurant, a two top would be ideal for two people. Though nice, the two top at which we were sat had uncomfortable chairs and the booth, which was open, looked a bit more comfy. The waitress asked the host who came to me to apologize for not being able to accommodate us. As my girlfriend had made the request I told him so and told him it would be more fitting for the apology to be addressed to her. He looked at her, and laughed... he laughed at her. I found his behavior insulting to us both.\\n\\nLater, we noticed an elderly man making his way to the door, shaking, and a bit off balance. One of the waitstaff, hurriedly passed by the older gentleman, cutting around him and nearly causing him to spill over instead of politely helping him by or standing aside while he navigated around the tables. Also, poor form.\\n\\nThe decor is nice, but clashes against the televisions, chosen music, and the waitstaff uniforms.

This time I found it very satisfying and tasty. I had the spicy shrimp and eggplant. I think it was an appetizer. Salt & Vinegar popcorn is fun to eat, I warn you though don't pop a whole handful in yoru mouth at once. You might be showering your friends with some popcorn. \\n\\nWhen my food came out it looked so delectable, it looked like a flower. The eggplant being the petals and the good sized portion of shrimp being the center, sprinkled with some fresh okra. The sauce on this was SO yummy, spicy yet sweet and the ingredients were all cooked perfectly. \\n\\nWarning: the pop corn will make you cough, the vinegar hits your throat in such a way you cant help but cough.Definitely addicting, you just want to try it again to see if you'll cough again. Each time you try to eat some more even though you know its going to happen your body can not help it.\\n\\nFrench fries were piping hot and very well seasoned, they must bre fresh otherwise they get a bit soggy, Instead of using ketchup I acutally used the sauce from my eggplant, seriously I kid you not it was THAT GOOD.\\n\\nBeer selection is out of this world. I had a little sumthin sumthin ale. YUM Loved the name, loved the taste, I even took the bottle home, it was a cute bottle that looked vintage. St. Benardus was pretty good too, looks heavier than I prefer but it was light.\\n\\nThis place is so cozy. one of my atlanta favs. Having some cool people around also helps!"},{"name":"Pino's Pizza","address":"1920 Beacon St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Pino's would be an average neighborhood pizza parlor if it were located in the tri-state... Brighton however is certainly not the tri-state and with that in mind I give Pino's four stars. The fact of the matter is that Pino's serves pretty much the best New York style pizza to be found in Boston. There are better pies to be found in Boston to be sure (Picco, Santarpios, Regginas,  Sweet Tomatoes, Upper Crust...) but none of the other contenders serve what could be called real NY style pizzia. So if you are from the Tri-state or if you just want to see what all the fuss is about NY pizzia and don't have the time to drive 200 miles south, hit up Pino's.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that sometimes they don't heat up their slices enough and the crust can get a little soft... this is easily remedied by asking them to throw it back in the oven for a minute or two. \\n\\nAlso to Erin M. get your head out of your ass Presto's is total garbage."},{"name":"Stats","address":"300 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night with my wife. We were staying downtown to go to a Falcons game the next day. We were hungry and wanted to see the final college rival games so we chose Stats which is around the corner from the Hilton. We asked for a table where we could watch a particular game and they said no problem. They led us to the main dining area which was occupied by about four groups - the room was about 15% full. We chose an empty table in front view of one of the tv's. There were half a dozen tv's in the room all tuned into on game Fl State versus Fl. Fl was losing 22-0 in the fourth quarter. Just giving you perspective here. We were tossed a couple of menus which were filthy and contained dry food on them. The waitress left without as much as acknowledging us. She came back and asked if we wanted any thing to drink acting very impatient. We gave her our drink orders and she disappeared quickly. My wife wasn't even sure heard her request. After a long while she came back with the drinks and was almost running away when I asked if they could put on the game we requested. She stared, turned and left. To our surprise the game came on. We then waited and waited to order our meal and almost,left when she returned and asked for our order. Still very unfriendly and Standoffish. The food came relatively quickly and was brought over by another individual. It was hot and decent for bar food. About this time our tv was changed back to the game that was on every other tv in the room. Great concept for a sports bar? When we finally got our waitresses attention and inquired about the change she said other people were their first and wanted to watch that game. So they seat me at a table where I could watch a game I asked for at checkin then don't oblige. By now my beer is on its last sip and she doesn't even ask if I want another. She leaves. She finally comes back and I ask for another beer and she leaves. Five minutes or more late she shows up and I tell her to cancel my beer. She says \\"Oh, they didn't bring you one\\". I asked for my bill which she got after another wait and turned to leave and I stopped her to give her my credit card so I wouldn't have to agonizingly wait for her to return after another long wait. I usually don't write posts however I have to warn people not to go to this place and waste their hard earned money or lose time they'll never get back.

To be honest, I guess I was expecting a little more, given the reviews here. I had one of the charcuterie boards, and picked the smoked beef tongue, porchetta, chicken liver mousse, Pont L'Eveque, and Manchego de Corcuera, along with the eggplant sott' aceto and jalapeno jelly. The two meats were nice, especially the beef tongue, with a great texture a flavor. The chicken liver mousse had a great texture, but the richness and strong, fennel-enhanced flavor was a bit much for me. I loved both the grainy texture and the distinct flavor from the sheep's cheese, but the Pont L'Eveque tasted like buttery incubator; however that's probably just my bacterial culture days haunting me. The eggplant was interesting, and the jalapenos castrated of their spiciness, which was a bit disappointing.\\n\\nAtmosphere: It was surprisingly loud, especially given that there weren't that many people there at the time - a problem with the acoustics, perhaps? I loved the candle-on-a-wine-bottle each table had; it was a nice touch.\\n\\nService: The waitstaff was very, very attentive and incredibly prompt and friendly. They explained the various menu options and showed us exactly what was what when the board came out. Nothing but praise for this one.\\n\\nCost/Benefit: Well, I probably wouldn't come here for food. It's not exactly economical, with small portions for significant expense. It's not really for meat lovers like myself as a result, haha - probably more for \\"gourmet\\" lovers. However, given the location and the fun that comes from trying out the charcuterie sampler, it's definitely a fun place to take friends that have never been, or to just try something out of the ordinary.

There were so many great smelling restaurants, I NEARLY change my mind about eating a sandwich, but I persisted onwards to Reuben's about half way down the block. I got lucky again because it was noon on Friday and there was no line!!! I had already called ahead to find out what the most popular sandwiches were and after placing my order, I began a conversation with another first timer standing behind me. Well, that got me into a little trouble with the sandwich makers because I wasn't paying attention when they called out for my toppings.\\n\\nAfter giving me a hard time, I requested the \\"normal\\" toppings that accompany the 'East Sider' sandwich (along with provolone cheese). Well, it wasn't long before I got in trouble again, because I requested my sandwich \\"grilled\\" a little later than I should have... LOL!!!! Once again I got the side eye look and given another hard time, but truthfully it was all in fun.

The exposed brick walls and the rustic wood tables were a nice touch and I definitely dig the whole ambiance of a simple neighborhood pub. \\n\\nRight off the bat we noticed that their clipboard-styled menus were way too similar to the Brick Store's...I think a little originality would've been a nice touch here. The beer selection was good--I don't think it's as vast as Brick Store's, but they had many enticing Belgium beers on tap and the featured Japanese beers was a nice unique touch. The food however was really, really not good...something a lot of reviewers have already commented on, so I thought I was prepared for it...well, I was wrong. After not finding anything on the menu that was enticing, we decided to stick to the usual pub grub--both the basket of Belgium Fries and the Crispy Calamari came out over-fried and hard, and the Kraut and Beer Brats was just so-so, and the 3 small bratwursts for the price of $13 is absolutely ridiculous. \\n\\nOverall, my first impression of The Porter is, it's a knockoff of the Brick Store Pub, but with much worse food.

We generally sit at the bar when we eat out but do so at Soho, in particular, because the service is much better than at the tables.  The couple times we have at eaten at the tables, service was mediocre to poor on a number of counts: took too long to take our drink and meal orders, difficulty getting refills, or took too long to take the tab.\\n\\nAt the bar, we have often been immediately waited upon but occasionally had to wait a couple minutes when it was busy.  The bartenders are knowledgeable and courteous although I feel they could be a bit friendlier.\\n\\nOur go-to orders at Soho are the mussels in a wine sauce app and the Apple & Sausage ravioli entree.  Both are very good.  The mussels are good but the bigger draw for me is the wine sauce.  After we finish the mussels, I can go through two orders of bread to soak up the rest of the sauce!  Usually, we'll share the mussels, raviolis and another appetizer for dinner which satisfies us.  I've seen complaints on here about the crab cakes.  Actually they seemed tasty to me but they are rather expensive.\\n\\nOthers have reported how expensive Soho is.  I agree in general but it seems that their menu options add something unique to the traditional.  A note to the discount-savvy types out there: in the past, we've discovered Soho provided a free slider to first-time 4 Square users when checking in.  Also, Soho provides a loyalty diner program.  Granted these aren't real big deals and even I don't really like the idea of having to track down and use discounts but it is kinda fun to feel like you're getting something for free.\\n\\nSoho will probably remain on our rotation for us in the Vinings area since dining at the bar provides us the best mix of social dining and good, reliable food."},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Belgian beers are my favourite and the options at Chambar were exhaustive.

Both were absolutely delicious, and my husband and I have talked about them since - especially those meatballs!  I think the arancini are superior at Galleria Umberto, but since their hours, not to mention that line, can be difficult to navigate, Antico's arancini were a great substitute.  I have to say that the \\"ribolitta\\" was disappointing, mostly because it was not ribolitta, rather a minestrone sans bread.  Weird.  In and of itself the soup was very good, but one could not in good conscience call it ribolitta.  However, the bread served before the meal was superb, and the garlic and olive infused oil accompanying it was sublime, so it can be forgiven I suppose.\\n\\nPrices are a bit steep in my opinion - our meatball appetizer surprised us at $16, similarly with the arancini at $14.

The cremant rose champagne aperetief was very good as was the affligem on tap.  Their belgian beer list remains second to none and their wine list is very good as well.  The charcuterie was good but no real standouts besides one of the salumis.  I don't actually know what it all included because the young french waiter spoke solely to my husband, who couldn't have cared less as long as it was edible, and left the rest of us to simply wonder and muse.  We ended up turning it into a game and besides chicken liver, remained ignorant for the most part.  The olives were very nice and included giant capers and castelvetrano,,,my faves.\\n\\nNow onto dinner, I ordered a glass of Du Gassac after deciding to deviate from the usual mussels and try the new york entrecote.  The others at the table ordered the canard du chevre, nice but what was that awful tasteless gnocchi about?, the mussels vin blanc and the other mussels that were not the congolese.  The mussels did not disappoint nor did the perfectly cooked entrecote with a great shaved root veggie smeared in blue cheese.  Yummy.  However, the wine came late and I am unused to service being backwards at restaurants where I spend around $250.  Just a thought.  \\n\\nAnyway, the wine was fantastic and perfectly paired.

There are no counters separating the dining area from the pizza ovens and area where the chefs work.\\n\\nYour pizza is brought out to you on a big cookie sheet, and everyone eats off the cookie sheet.

A small Italian restaurant in North End of Boston, this place has a rustic feel with a variety of pasta dishes. Their special, lobster with their home-made pasta ($26), had one of the best Italian pasta I've ever tasted. Cooked to perfection with a slightly spicy tomato sauce, and plenty of hearty chunks of lobster. the portion was more than enough for single person. Other orders, such as the mussels and cooked vegetable dishes are cheaper (~$10-15) but still make great appetizers. For dinner, this place gets very crowded. I came here twice on two separate business trips, and both times the place is packed up until closing. Be sure to get there at least 15 minutes before closing, when the place is full, the restaurant will turn down customers. Overall, when in the city of Boston, this is a much recommended stop."},{"name":"The Albert","address":"918 Austin Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My Black and Blue burger was A-mazing.

It was as if they had emptied out a bottle of peanut sauce onto a bunch of uncooked vegetables, tofu and overcooked beef. Whatever they served me was in no way how massaman should taste. The curry base is SUPPOSED to have some combination of tamarind, cardamom, coriander, lemongrass, coconut milk and red curry paste.

I've lived in the North End for 2 years and never got around to going here because the line was always so absurd. But last night, me and my boyfriend FINALLY decided to do it. We figured 5pm on a Monday wouldn't have the longest wait.\\n\\nSo we ended up waiting about 30/40 min. Got to our little cramped table. And let me tell you - it was a VERY disappointing experience.\\n\\nI have never been so rushed at a restaurant in my life. We sat, ordered, ate, paid in a total of about 35 minutes.\\n\\nThe waiter was SO rude. Literally walked away while we were in the middle of our sentences, dropped the plates on the table, barely said a word (until the end, when he probably realized we control his tip). At one point he even came over with cheese  and without a word, poured it all over my boyfriend's dish, which he neither ask for nor wanted. \\n\\nFood came super fast. TOO fast. We got the buratta cheese appetizer, which was pretty good but very small. There wasn't much to it. Bunch of diced tomatoes and a ball of cheese.\\nMy boyfriend ordered the chicken parm, and wanted it in the giacomo sauce, but we were told that you can only pick sauces for seafood dishes, and before my boyfriend even had time to decide if he wanted to keep or change his order, the waiter was gone. The chicken parm came - it was decent, nothing special. They actually forgot to bring his side of pasta until he was done with the chicken.\\n\\nI had their famed butternut squash ravioli. I must say, it was really good. But would I ever wait 2 hours in the cold for it? Absolutely not. \\n\\nOverall, it is so not worth the wait. The experience of a restaurant is VERY important, and the atmosphere and service ruined our dinner.\\nI advise you guys go to Nico, right down the block.

I figured whatever, for the money it must be good, it wasn't. The beans looked like a bowl of vomit and cheese with a lovely slime coating, they tasted bland and somehow spicy at the same time, and the uniformly cubed chunks of what loosely resembled meat tasted of nothing but hot sauce.

So, as a lesson, ask them for milk because they HAVE to refrigerate that."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We tried to go to this restaurant last time we were in Boston but the line was too long and we were too hungry to wait so we went to Panza which is right across the street and had an amazing 5 star experience.

The restaurant has six dinning rooms, and we were escorted to a room on the lower level. Our dinning room has exposed bricks and high ceiling, very cozy. As the dinner went on, more guests were brought to our room and I couldn't help but to notice that almost all the guests were Asian. At around seven o'clock, the room was more than half full and had six group of guests. Among the six groups, five were Asians (including my group) and one were an African American couple. At first, I didn't know what to make of this observation. Later as we were leaving the restaurant at 7:30, we walked pass a dinning room on the main level, and what I saw was a room full of caucasian guests (in separate groups)!!  \\n\\nI don't think what I saw was a random event - it's not likely to have two +60% full dinning rooms each with guests of such distinct ethnic background if you just sit them randomly. \\n\\nThe restaurant is in a touristy location, so I am assuming that the management is trying to separate tourists from the local guests to provide better dinning experience for those who are more likely to return. If this is the case, it seems to me that the only criteria that they use to make such separation is ethnic background.\\n\\nMy experience at Ruth's Chris was a awkward one. The food deserves a star.

Sauce and toppings lived up to the hype, too. \\n\\nI'm giving this place a 4 for two reasons: \\n\\n1) although the menu makes clear there are \\"no substitutions\\", you're also not allowed to leave anything off the pizza. So the menu should say \\"no modifications\\"....I know it's just a matter of semantics but I showed up expecting to be able to 86 the onions (without asking to 'substitute' another ingredient in their place) only to be told that all pizzas are made exactly as they appear on the menu. This \\"no modification\\" rule means that people with certain allergies will never be able to eat here. And to me, that's just dumb. \\n\\n2) For the bigger eaters out there, it's an expensive meal. Yes, I know they import their ingredients and there's an associated cost for high quality ingredients. But $19 for essentially the most basic pizza is a lot of money. I suppose most people (unlike me) could share a pizza so $20 for two people to eat is very affordable. I'm a normal guy but since I can easily take down a whole pie by myself, there's no way my wife and I can get out of here without buying two pizzas ($40).

I purchased 20 macarons that day..... luckily I handed them out to my friends here in NYC (lest I would have gained some serious macaron weight) and they loved how chewy and almond-y it was.

I'll take the restaurant with the dueling wait staff over this dump.  \\n\\nI was greeted upon arriving, as we were the only people in the place.  The table cloths were not changed between meals and probably not day to day either as the white cloth underneath was dusty and stained more horribly than the top one which was more freshly soiled.\\n\\nI had a bad feeling about this place right from the start.  The sauces brought to us in a caddy, you could tell the bowls were wiped along the top to clean them up in between patrons.  The sauce had a dried ring from it sitting.  The one sauce was so incredibly salty also.  \\n\\nWhat is with Indian restaurants and TV's.  While I don't mind a cultural experience, TV's that play really horrible Indian music videos or movies that have loud commercials in between is very distracting for dinner conversation.  The TV's here were so loud I had to talk with an outside voice.  Some of the best Indian I have had have music playing or live sitar music.  \\n\\nWe had our children with us and they enjoy spicy food but the food I ordered them, which did not state it was spicy, came out so spicy with black pepper I couldn't even eat it.  I told the manager about this and he was completely dismissive and told us to pour some of the tamarind sauce to help the spice.  He walked away and I was pissed.  My husband tried it as he is not a confrontational person but I knew that wasn't going to do anything but make it sweet and spicy.  My kids couldn't eat it.  I even told another waiter and he had to have a lengthy discussion about it with the manager and never came back with an answer to our problem.  \\n\\nThen there was my vindaloo.  Now I know there is cardamon in vindaloo but my first bite was a black cardamon pod.  Which made my entire mouth taste like licorice.  I couldn't even taste anything else for awhile other than cardamon.  \\n\\nMy husband got the Tikka Masala.  He said his was super sweet.  Not even the yogurt was all the way stirred into it.  You don't even put sugar in Tikka Masala.  We both have NEVER had Indian food miss the mark this much.  \\n\\nWhile we were experiencing all this, the manager was still stuck on not helping us with our kids overly peppered  shrimp noodles.  We got up and walked out.  Then they came up to us to ask what they could do.  I said they can have a manager that didn't ignore his patrons.  \\n\\nWe did not have time to stand around and chat as our hour un-dinner left us only 30 minutes to get where we needed to be and unfed.  \\n\\nWe will not be returning.

You hear me saying this a lot but here is goes again: I come here mostly because it's close to my house but only before 9-9:30am. It's easy enough to get seating for 2 people at that time, but there's no way I'm waiting 20-40 minutes to get seated, to me it's not worth it, but to be fair, there are very few places that I would wait that long for. \\n\\nI have never had their signature crazy pancakes so I can't speak to those, but the regular breakfast stuff is just regular, not bad, but not great either. Hence the \\"A-OK\\" rating. \\n\\nMy husband usually gets the Eggs Benedict or the blueberry Belgian waffle and I know he likes both. \\n\\nI usually get two eggs and bacon and ask for fruit instead of home fries. The home fries are good, don't get me wrong, but I would like to avoid the carbs. It would be nice if I didn't get charged for the substitution but I do. The fruit bowl has also been a little hit or miss, the last time it was almost all banana and just a little bit of other fruit.  I feel like banana shouldn't be a part of the fruit bowl. \\n\\nI'm not sure they can do about the temperature inside but on warm days it can get really hot inside, esp near the counter. What would be really awesome is if they had a couple tables outside, if I could bring my dog or sit outside on a nice morning, then I might be willing to wait a little longer.  A mimosa or bloody Mary would seal the deal! \\n\\nOverall Pickle is a solid breakfast diner and my husband and I will be returning...when we wake up early enough =)"},{"name":"McMenamins Crystal Hotel","address":"303 SW 12th Ave.","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Stayed here for the Umphrey's show at the crystal ballroom. I have stayed here before and will stay here again. Great , central location and literally right across from the Crystal ballroom. Just got a Queen room ( Sonic Youth Kool Thing) part of the fun is getting the different song themed rooms, each of which is unique . We liked being on the second floor better than the 4th like last time because the elevator is small , very small:  room for two with luggage or three without , and has a long wait. so with the 2nd floor it is an easy walk up/ down.  I liked that they allowed dogs ( we didnt have ours with , but we like dogs). Our neighbors( well our entire floor ) partied hard after the show right near our door, but it didnt bother us at all. It is a venue hotel, afterall ,not a B&B. After a show, you are tired and will sleep or you will party. The bathrooms are shared ( 4 per floor) but as usual at a McMenamins, clean, etc.,  never had to wait really. Each room has a sink and a window you can crack. Bed was fine for one night. Parking was not too bad,  $14 at the PMC garage with no in and out ( which we didnt need to do) but the lots around there vary and you can park at the lot about 2 blocks away with your room key in and out for $25 a night. You have to check in first and ask them for the parking pass,  they can just add the parking cost to your room. We took the Portland streetcar down to the waterfront and back , and it was very easy to catch just a few block walk and just  $1 each way. The cellar bar is always cool, we sat outside / upstairs, because the service was faster ,and  it was a fairly warm night. McMinneman's beers are OK, the IPA was pretty good this time.  Ringlers was way too packed pre-show for us. The downstairs part of the cellar bar was large, and they have bathrooms so you can hit them before you hit the show without having to wait at the Crystal. Food-wise, if you do eat there,  typical McMenamins fare:  burgers, fries, bar food with veggie options.   We dont use the soaking pool , there is something I find disgusting about them, Yes, people use them and like them,  they are probably clean, but I dont use the soaking pools anywhere. One time at the kennedy school I almost got in until I saw a baby  in a diaper in the soaking pool,  while a handful of dirty hipster  types were  eating sandwiches and drinking cocktails while soaking in the pool in one gross scene. Never never never . This is my phobia, though, you can have at it. As far as after show, we stopped for a night cap at the Zues Cafe, attached to the hotel. Great cocktail menu and open until  1 am. No room service but you can order at the bar or call down, and take it to your room. They will clean up the plate if you leave it in your room. We hung out at the bar to close out the night and   had a honey infused gin cocktail of some type, and shared a  Skillet Baked Cookie -brown butter hogshead whiskey cookie, housemade vanilla ice cream, cr√®me anglaise. Gooey , yummy, hot -  unreal!! $7 well spent and a new favorite."},{"name":"Sawasdee Thai Food","address":"1401 NW 19 Th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Another one of those \\"how have I never reviewed this place before?\\" places.\\n\\nMy friends are often impressed and annoyed by my seemingly photographic memory but I have nothing on Sonny at Sawasdee.

We were the third party on the line but soon the line wrapped around the corner as the sun grew hotter and hotter.\\n\\nTip: Once you see the line, there is no point of going inside to scope because everyone who goes inside immediately comes back out to get on line. Once you're on the line, you'll have to wait until one o the ladies come out to ask how many are in your party.\\nMy friend and I could've gone in way earlier because they had two counter seats available that we eventually sat on but since they didn't come out to check, we had to wait awhile, about 15 minutes (more or less..er probably more with that hot sun burning our faces lol). When she finally asked us, we were told to go inside right away.\\n\\nDonna was our waitress. Seemed like a typical tough lady but nice enough for the most part. My friend's phone had died due to GPS'ing all day and she kindly asked if she was able to charge the phone somewhere but straight up got rejected, \\"NO..sorry honey.\\" Busy establishment, I know, could've been a bit more kind about it though! She pointed to the menu board and quickly explained how there were different sauces to go with the entrees. I guess that is her go-t-suggestion for customers she felt were new? Heard her saying the same thing to some other people, Idk. Later on my friend noticed she gave another party menus (not that they were anything too fancy) but it didn't bother me too much. There was a waiter who kept filling our cups from the moment we came in and he even filled a drink cup that I was sipping as I sat down because he mustve saw how thirsty/hot I was. LOL :x #muchappreciated!\\n\\nFor the food, we both decided to go with the Frutti Tutti..jk, Fruiti Di Mari (I can't for the life of me remember the name of this dish) because while we were on the line, the gentlemen behind us recommended this to a group of other people and we were thinking, \\"Well alright!\\" Lol. I picked the \\"Spicy\\" sauce (Runny consistency) and my friend picked the sauce with the word \\"Pink\\" in the name (thick consistency). My dish was not spicy at all but I still liked it and I was pleasantly surprised at the portion at the amount of seafood and pasta that was given to me. I guess that living in NYC, I haven't really experienced anything like this; full, fresh, quantity and quality seafood over my linguine. We also ordered a large fried calamari ($11) and I loved it! Given a second change, I would still order the large! Lol. Both dishes tasted so darn good to me.. so good. Total was .. 20+20+11=51+tax=55ish+tips=$65 .. well spent. I was not able to finish my FDM because I got full from the water but I was able to take it home. The take-out box was completely destroyed and spilled afterwards though because it was still hot and so saucy but I still was able to share and enjoy it with my sister the following day.\\n\\nIf I ever come back again, I would definitely order the House Special, it looked so good when they were taking it out and serving it to others ($60).\\n\\nOverall, I'd give it a 4.5 stars but because I can't, I will give it a 5.

The allure of this place isn't so much about the food for me so much as the atmosphere. It used to be a dry county and the BYOB policy still abides despite the new addition of the \\"salt lick wine cellar.\\" The cellar is so cute I might want to have my blissful carnivore lover wedding there. They have wine tasting and food pairing options, bocce ball, beer, and the best part is kids aren't allowed! (Don't worry they can hang out in the kids ranch). This is a far cry from what I envisioned from the number one bbq joint in austin. You will wait, and that is to be expected, but you will have fun while you wait because everyone brings a cooler and drinks some cold beers. In my opinion, waiting to eat inside is terribly over rated. You can wait in the pick up food line (which is only slightly shorter than waiting for a table inside the dining room, around 30 min on Saturday of memorial weekend) and sit outside in the picnic tables which I would much rather do. The inside dining resembles a banquet hall, mainly tables of family escaping the heat. \\nOn to the food, honestly I've had better bbq before (once only once) but it's all a matter of preference. I had thurmans choice which was a sampling of pork ribs, brisket, and sausage. I allllmost got just the brisket because mighty quinns in nyc made me a brisket lover but I'm so glad I didn't.  The sausage was the best and I hated the brisket while others write it's praise. The brisket was too fatty for my liking and tough (not soft falling part like mighty quinns). The coleslaw and potatoe salad were bland. The most under rated thing on the menu was the bread and spicey bbq sauce. These are a must. Good thing they sell the sauce. The bread looks so bland you almost want to pass on it, except the dollar rental car lady had told me she was a vegetarian and she is obsessed with the bread and dipping sauce so I had to give it a try. I also tried my friends beef ribs and they were fantastic! Much better than the pork ribs.The portions are massive and normally should be shared by two people but I was on vacation. When in rome....\\n*You can buy the bbq sauce at the Austin airport at their salt lick outpost"},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"45 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We went for thanksgiving dinner.

Here are his thoughts (and I will point out that this is the first time he has ever asked me to write a negative review):\\n\\nI work downtown and stopped in for lunch at this restaurant on January 19, 2017 as I have done many times before. I had the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant in Austin in the decade I've lived here.  I walked up to the pizza counter and asked the staff, \\"Hey guys, what type of pizza are you offering today?\\"  Instead of answering with a line up of options, the two guys working there were extremely rude in their response of \\"what does it look like?\\" I was floored. It was not obvious what ingredients were on the slices available, and in any event, what's wrong with a little bit of friendly banter with a customer (and one who has been a customer many times in the past)?  I thought it may have been a joke, so I asked again.  When one of the employees responded with the same statement even more rudely and more aggressively the second time, I was shocked! This is not how customers are treated in Austin, which I consider to be one of the friendliest cities in the land.  So, hoping that I was missing something, I said, \\"I'm going to ask politely one more time, 'what are the pizza options today?'\\" and I was saddened and disappointed to receive an even more rude and aggressive response than I had the first two times. Instead of interacting with me, the Onion's employees would rather be rude and uninviting while surfing on iPads. There is much better pizza in this town, but I came to the Onion because I thought I was giving my business to an establishment that is friendly and cares about its customers. I was wrong, and I will never return. I suggest you don't either. The Onion doesn't deserve your business."},{"name":"Pio Pio Restaurant","address":"5803 Precision Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Great little Brazilian style Spanish restaurant with excellent chicken, steaks, & fish all with rice and red beans, yucca/cassava or tostones or maduros.

However, after a couple of visits, it seems to me that all of the money went into the decor, because the food is a big miss.  Fresh--yes, good flavors and portions--no.  The tablside produced guacamole was a bland mixture of not yet ripe avocados.  The avocados were so hard, the server couldn't even mash it up to a smooth consistency.  I think Rocco's is trying to make a signature statement by producing guacamole tableside, and if that's the case, it has to be perfect.  If they can't get ripe avocados, then don't do it.  \\nMy recommendation, as others have posted, skip Rocco's.

Fun but loud atmosphere. After going to Rocco's Tacos in Ft. Lauderdale last year and enjoying it so much, we had to go back when we found out there was also one in Orlando. We went on a February Tuesday night after 7pm, and were shocked to see the place was PACKED and absolutely nuts. There was a wait of 1.5 hours for a table! Because I had bragged about it to others in our party who had never been there, we decided to wait for a table. What we didnt realize until after we ordered was that it was \\"Taco Tuesday\\", where they serve unlimited tacos for $15 or so (the waiter could have told us that, but didnt), hence the huge number of patrons. Anyway, 90 minutes later we got a table in a semi-open area, which was directly next to a lake. The moon was high and bright, so it was beautiful, but it was pretty cold (in  the low 50's) to be sitting basically outside. The food and service were good. I had the BBQ tacos, which werent really to my liking, but that wasnt their fault. The black bean and plantain quesadilla again was great. The other meals were good too, and the guacamole is always a favorite. The service was good, despite it being so busy. Would go back again and again (just maybe not on a Tuesday night if I was in a hurry)."},{"name":"Antico Forno","address":"93 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"My husband and I snuck off for lunch on a Sunday and to use an Eversave coupon. First, they validate parking at the garage above Haymarket T station (Parcel 7 Garage, I believe). When we left parking was $15 and with validation was only $1! It was an amazingly quick walk over to Salem St. and we were in the restaurant within 5 minutes of parking. We were welcomed and seated immediately. Our waiter was very sweet and personable and helped us decide what would be perfect to share and to try. \\n\\nWe ordered a delicious mixed green salad and then one of the specials, their traditional meatball appetizer in plum tomato sauce with roasted red peppers and greens. It seemed silly to order a single meatball in a bowl until we tasted it. My husband who comes from an Italian family made me swear we would never tell his mother but that it was the best meatball he had ever had in his entire life. I'd have to agree with that; it really was that good. We also ordered la capricciosa pizza (italian sausage, mushrooms and artichoke hearts) and it was amazing. The homemade bread on the table was warm and incredible and came with olive oil with olives in it. Don't let them clear it from the table because the crust of the brick oven pizza is just as good dipped in there too! \\n\\nWe ordered two glasses of the Sangiovese wine which is a favorite of ours and it was worth every penny. Next time we will get a bottle. We finished up our lunch escape by splitting the tiramisu, which was beyond words. We had a leisurely walk back to the garage, the pleasant surprise of the huge parking discount, and then zipped back on to the highway. We have two more Eversave discounts to go and we can 't wait to go back! The bill was about $58 and with the save we paid $18 plus tip on the whole bill.

And that meant I didn't get as good of a sandwich as I could've, but that's more my fault than theirs. The ingredients--including Boar's Head and Thumann's meats--were all top notch. \\n\\nReally, I came in unprepared for the build-it-yourself mentality of Reuben's, where you have about 10 options each for the bread, meat, etc. Factor in the hectic \\"get-them-in, get-them-out\\" pace and I was truly caught off guard. Because despite the long line, I had almost no time to consider my options. \\n\\nAs such, I ended up with an Italian Hero on white (which was good), but didn't realize that I could have gotten it on a roll with oil and vinegar until the guy behind me ordered something that way.

It's also very reasonably priced for good North End food and I always get another meal out of the leftovers!"},{"name":"Little Big Burger","address":"3810 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Best burgers AND fries I've ever had.

And what sangria comes with no fruits on top??  Didn't like it.  Didn't even finish my drink which is very rare!\\n\\nI ordered the garlic shrimp, the mussels in spicy tomato broth and the beer short ribs.  The best dish was the mussels.  They were fresh and the touch of spiciness was nice. This restaurant does not give bread to mop up the sauces!   The short ribs weren't ribs; it was a small chuck of beef.  It was tender and flavorful.  The garlic shrimp was only OK.  The shrimps were quite small.  \\n\\nI know tapas are small dishes and indeed, the dishes were small.  It's expensive to charge an average of $10 per dish for such small quantity of food.  Almost $50 later, I walked out not satisfied.

You know it's all bad when you see cheese pizza, french fries, spinach casserole, and sushi sitting along side the usual Chinese food suspects. As soon as I saw the cheese pizza right next to the fried shrimp and sweet and sour sauce, I thought, \\"Wow, they went there,\\". I grabbed a few \\"safe\\" options - egg rolls, shrimp, fried rice, stir fry veggies, and even mixed in some Clam Chowder. It all just lacked any real flavor. I mean, how do you let that happen to egg rolls? That should be an easy win! I took a couple bites of the clam chowder and it just wasn't sitting right with me. \\n\\nAfter the meal, we all collectively decided this was not a good decision. We're right next to Disney World and all that good stuff. They're not going to screw that up...no need to get too cute.

We decided to try this place because I saw they were one of the only places in Orlando that put tobacco in fruit heads (which I absolutely love). It's stylish and in my opinion it tastes smoother and better. Well, anyways, I'm normally used to extremely loud hookah bars that play house music or EDM or switch it up with rap and hip hop...well this place had like elevator music on haha. The place is overpriced so just be ready. They had a coupon on Groupon but oh believe me if it says ONLY two people they MEAN that. You would probably get charged an arm and your entire leg for the third person smoking if you had a third. Our bill came out to 56 dollars and even though my service was shitty as hell and they already charged 18% I still left $5 more. Anyways, \\n\\nThe good first, then the bad...\\n\\nGood:\\n- Very clean hookah bar\\n- Decent seating \\n- Beautiful Hookahs (Royal Hookah)\\n- Fruit heads \\n- Very big selection of Shisha (Al Fakher, Starbuzz, Fantasia, and one more I can't remember the name). \\n\\nBad:\\n- Parking is so scarce here. We had to park at the end of the lot by the restaurant Giordanos and walk which isn't bad just it could get busy and you'll get no parking. \\n- If you see someone standing at the entry way you should obviously assume the guests are coming to do something. You should bring menus with you not have to walk back and waste your time and ours twice. \\n- Water alone is $2. We got a Royal Hookah which is the beautiful glass hookah but the major con is that after smoking for a few minutes the ice melts and then the water level rises and oh my God no smoke is coming out. \\n-Half the people smoking Royal Hookahs they weren't getting any clouds of smoke. Little dinky clouds. People smoking Khalil Mamoon Chillers and Khalil Mamoon single and double pear hookahs were getting really good smoke (If you don't know what I just said just Google it. I'm almost positive you've seen these hookahs before) \\n- I asked the guy to fix the hookah for me and umm well he said, \\"There's smoke\\". But obviously it's not what I'm used too. It's so minimal. \\n- On our Royal Hookah we got a Pineapple head and to be honest coal is something you should check on at least every fifteen minutes. I mean you can't put the coal in one spot it'll just taste harsh and burn out the shisha. I asked the girl to change it she took them off ashed them in her holder and DIDNT EVEN BLOW OFF THE SMOKE ON THE FOIL INTO HER COAL HOLDER. JUST LEFT IT THERE. AND PUT THE COALS BACK ON. ALMOST IDENTICAL SPOTS. Really? I normally rotate my coals so come on man. \\n- I told her my hookah wasn't pulling she then told me how the water rose. I told her please just get me the bill from your other server we want to leave. She said it would've taken a while to get the water out the hookah...at this point I was already infuriated and embarrassed because I took two good friends of mine to try this hookah bar and this was our experience. \\n\\n\\nOverall, beautiful place. Service, it's shitty. And they weren't even that busy. We sat at table 4. Oh, and they'll think they can educate hookah enthusiasts on hookah.

Really questioning the judges that gave this chili 3rd place out of a couple of dozen restaurants that participate in the competition. The chili was really thick and looked like a paste. The smoked wings were decent, but nothing special here. The fried pickles were the best outta the 3; really enjoyed the batter they were fried in\\n\\nNow for the Diner Burger. It's two thin patties with two pieces of american cheese melted on top. They add raw red onion, mustard, mayo, and pickles. Pretty standard burger, but the flavor was amazing. All of the toppings come together to make something really special. I enjoyed every bite. I added a little ketchup, and it was even better. The burger is very similar to the burger at Holeman & Finch. Not quite as good, but very close. This is probably tied for 3rd on my personal Atlanta Metro Burger List (1st being H&F, 2nd Red Eyed Mule, & 3rd General Muir)\\n\\nIt comes with a side of fries which my friend describes as Ore Ida frozen fries from the grocery store. I guess I agree. Nothing too special. I tried a friend's baked beans and they were much better than fries.

I especially enjoyed the fruit plate (more like a platter) with drizzled honey and fresh mint. \\n\\nThe disappointment was with the prices. The portions for price did not seem consistent. The beignets were $5 (sensible) while the granola, fruit and quinoa was $9.99 (just say $10 - whoa!). All the omelettes (except the Fontainbleau) are over $10 dollars and come with and english muffin and country potatoes. And, the burgers and sandwiches are $9-$10 dollars.

We were happy to be seated by a friendly hostess right away by the fireplace. I have to say they did an excellent  job top to bottom. The cooper ceilings was my favorite! Our service was good a little on the slow side but expected it with it being new and all.... Our burgers took awhile but it even says on the menu burgers take no less than 20 minutes and I get my burger well done so I know especially being a native to somerville it takes around half hour. So we got an order of sweet potato fries while we waited, they were so good crispy and that special sauce they serve with it. YUM! When we received our huge burgers I noticed the onion rings were different and asked the server if these onion rings were going to be the ones they always serve and he apologized saying they ran out and these were their plan b that they had a crazy weekend. Which we totally understand with only being open for a week! My burger was amazing as always! When my husband and I got the bill we had two burger platters, appetizer and two sodas for under $30 now that's a bargain! We definitely will be back! \\nAlso...

He told us to skip Mike's and Modern (and I actually just learned of Modern fairly recently as the hidden gem at that time) and go to Maria's.

The place was very unassuming...very simple and local-looking.

However, the cannolis they had were amazing!!! I got the regular and chocolate-dipped shells. Side note: I was so taken aback by the place that I didn't realize to look right and see that I could have chosen my filling and other flavors (chocolate chips and pistachio). I only saw the \\"pick your shell\\" portion haha. Regardless, the ones I got were mouthwatering (I'm drooling even as I sit and type this review).

Django is a combination of restuarent, cafe, bar, and nightclub.  Many nights have a dJ or a band, and the action heats up around 11pm.  This is a very eclectic place, with an above average food menu.

There are things I really loved here but unfortunately the main BBQ wasn't one of them and since that is the core of this place - the rating is reflective of that.\\n\\nI'll start with what I didn't love. I don't know if it's the cut of meat we got or what but my brisket was not moist at all and was actually a bit dry - not good when I was expecting so much more. The ribs were also pretty meh - again not tender or falling off the bone. I preferred Franklin's or even Rudy's to this. I didn't like the coleslaw at all, and I especially didn't like the prices. $20 (with tip and tax) for the only sampler plate available is a bit much. Even if you get the unlimited option (let's say  $30/person minimum with tip and tax) you'd have to eat a ton to get your money's worth. \\n\\nNow on to the things that were great. First, the cobblers (both peach and blackberry) were phenomenal! I don't think I've had better in my life - the blackberry was tangy but not too tart and the crust was to die for -especially with ice cream. Second, the turkey was surprisingly delicious - very moist and tender and normally I don't like turkey. Third, unlike franklins, we had absolutely no wait when we showed up at noon this past Saturday. Though it definitely got crowded later, it was nice to go to a place where you didn't need to wait for hours to be fed bbq. Finally, the potatoes, beans, and sausage were all quite good but not amazing or anything.\\n\\nI would come back just for that cobbler if it weren't so far away from where I live.

Its Sunday brunch is usually the highlight of my culinary week (when I can convince my friends to trek my way and go). This week however it seems like nothing went right:\\n\\n1. While I actually enjoy a Jazz brunch and even like music playing during brunch, I think having extremely loud rap being played by a DJ ruins the ambiance of this normally very charming establishment. The owner told me that up until now they only got a DJ the last Sunday of every month, but that the turnout was so good they were going to make it a more regular thing.\\n\\n2. That brings me to my next point. While service is normally awesome at Estelle's, this week, with a packed house (maybe overflowing would be more appropriate) they definitely didn't have the staff to support all their customers. We were often overlooked by the wait staff as they rushed to serve the enormous party in the back room, all of whom seemed to have been there to support their friend - the DJ. Which I have no problem with, but if you know the turnout is going to be high, you should really endeavor to step up your service game.\\n\\n3. Another spillover from the crowd was that the kitchen seemed to be comparatively subpar compared to other experiences I've had. The Texas Toast which is normally nothing short of RAVE-worthy was little more than thick pieces of white bread toasted.\\n\\nOther than that my food, and that of the rest of my party was excellent, the coffee was up to its normal awesome standards and I left Estelle's feeling satisfied.

The wait staff will usually go the extra mile to ensure that you are more than happy with your experience, and the food is worth every penny. \\n\\nAnd now the food:\\n\\nIf your visting this establishment, I hope you have come for the steak. And If you are eating a steak, no matter which one it may be, make sure you have it cooked in extra butter. There is no other way to eat a steak.  As far as appetizers go, the seared ahi tuna, french onion soup and spinach salad with the bacon reduction dressing are safe bets. Simple, but well well executed. \\n\\nAs far as the sides, one is more than enough to split among two people. Once again the mashed potatoes are a simple, but well executed dish. The Lyonnaise potatoes are also one of my favorites, and if you have any extra, make sure to take them home and reheat them for breakfast with some eggs!\\n\\nI have to say that the desserts are a bit over priced, but it's Ruth Chris.

The location is in a classic ranch neighborhood, and from the moment you park you're engulfed in the aromatic smoke. The pit is as iconic as it gets, if you're looking to Instagram your trip. \\n\\nThe aesthetic of the restaurant itself is very traditional, with picnic style seating and servers who can guide you to the best way to order for your party size and appetite. What I love about this place is you can order in different styles: all-you-can-eat (which includes brisket, sausage, ribs, and sides); plates of different meats or combos of meats; and by weight. I usually order by weight as you get more bang for your buck.\\n\\nThe brisket here is typically cut thinner than other BBQ joints, and it is the most satisfying brisket I've ever had. The sausage again has no frills - no blocks of cheddar or jalapenos included - but again the best available. They'll cut the links into smaller bites to pick up with a fork. The ribs simply fall off the bone. The sauces here are plain or slightly spicy, and come thicker, creamier, and richer than most BBQ sauces I've seen. \\n\\nSalt Lick bakes its own bread, so it isn't the typical wonder bread that is served at other BBQs - it will come out warm and pillow soft. You can also get onions and pickles (sliced in cut spears, not chopped in circles), as well as pickled jalapenos. The sides are all reasonably delicious, but not the reason you come to Salt Lick. I'm usually not a fan of vinegar slaw, but it is definitely compatible with the meats here. We ended up ordering another 1/2 lb. of brisket my first time, just cause we couldn't get enough. \\n\\nLastly, we ordered a slice of pecan pie with ice cream to finish. They also bake their own desserts, and the pecan pie was baked to perfection. The pecans are rich and plentiful, the brown sugar blended in perfectly. The desserts are pretty sweet, and they now use a more savory ice cream since Blue Bell was recalled, which actually goes better with the pie. \\n\\nDefinitely eat here if you haven't eaten here yet. It is a necessary Texas pilgrimage. I will always look to take visitors here first, and go to other BBQ options if it seems unreasonable to drive to Salt Lick. Be prepared for a wait on weekends. In my opinion, Salt Lick is superior to Franklin's, but Franklin's has better marketing in recent years."},{"name":"La Taqueria Taco Bar & Grill","address":"636 Hyde Park Ave","city":"Roslindale","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is legit delicious!

I ordered the Pad See Ew with chicken, cheese eggrolls, and fancy shrimp eggrolls. The shrimp eggroll came with a little special sauce that consisted of cucumbers soaked in a sauce. It tasted great together with the shrimp eggrolls and would also stand on its own. The cheese egg rolls came out with sauce on its own also and that was an excellent choice also for the appetizers. Once the Pad See Ew came out I knew this place was something special. The portion was more than enough and the flavor was out of this world.

Moved on to a very tasty salad -- Salade de la Teranga -- with included among other vegetables mixed baby greens and grated carrots topped with chopped mango in a very nice, slightly tangy sweet and light house vinaigrette.\\n\\nFor the main course, Thiebou Yap, a delicious stew, seasoned with just the right amount of salt and heat, combining cubed beef, onions, sweet red pepper, and chunks of carrot and both white and sweet potatoes, everything perfectly fork tender without being the least bit mushy or overcooked, served with a generous portion of steamed jasmine rice.\\n\\nFinally, dessert -- which anyone who knows me knows I can't resist -- which was a delightfully light pudding called Thiacry, made with couscous, chopped mango chunks and raisins in a thin vanilla cream. With a hot tasty cup of Senegalese coffee which was comfortably dark and strong without being at all bitter.\\n\\nCan't close this out without a few words about the excellent service and the ambiance. The establishment was clean, with simple and tasteful decor and lively African highlife music playing on a decent quality stereo system. The West African staff were attentive and helpful, especially in walking me through and explaining the menu offerings as well as making recommendations. They were friendly and vibrantly enthusiastic and proud about the food that they serve, with me and the other customers dining there, without exhibiting any of the phony, cloying, eager beaverness which I find so ubiquitous and annoying in so many establishments today. Several of the workers not directly, or at least not obviously, involved in service to my table made it a point of stopping by to inquire and converse about the meal I'd been enjoying in a most genuine, polite and nonintrusive fashion.

We've eaten at other locations down South, but this was our first venture to the Ruth's Chris in Boston.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located in the Old City Hall. Makes for some great photo opportunities, but it does mean the space of the restaurant is a little forced. We were seated within five minutes since we'd made a reservation on a Saturday night, but for those who were strolling in, we heard the wait was 45 minutes.\\n\\nWe were seated at an intimate table with \\"Happy Anniversary\\" decorations on the table cloth. \\n\\nFor dinner, we split the crab cake appetizer (super tasty, hot, and sizzling). My husband had the filet and lobster, which he loved, and I had a petite filet (cooked perfectly). Despite the numerous other steak places I've been in my life, Ruth's Chris always gets it right and Ruth's Chris Boston is no exception. Scrumptious! The mashed potato side dish we ordered was gone by the end of the meal, and that's a lot to say for my husband who generally leaves sides unfinished if there's protein involved!\\n\\nFor dessert, before we could order, the server brought out a complimentary dessert trio with \\"Happy Anniversary\\" written in chocolate on the plate. It was a perfect taste of three different desserts and a wonderful way to end the night.\\n\\nThe only negative was that this location seemed louder than others, which I think is due to the space issue I've already mentioned.\\n\\nValet parking is a bit pricey $14 -- but it's downtown, so I guess it's about right.

The meat falls off the bone and drenched in a deep, dark, flavored sauce. Tons of flavor!! The sweet corn fritters reminded me of corn bread and accompanied the savory meat well.

It looked similar to a filled donut but savory in a steamed dumpling and enclosed or the Filipino Siopao.  But this King Bao, totally different, in a good way!  \\n\\nI love the different varieties they offer in every bao; each has its own unique taste.  I've heard so much about this place, we decided for a bite to eat.  We ordered the \\"Coco Loco\\" (coconut shrimp, mango relish, cilantro), \\"Oh Carolina\\" (kimchi slaw, pulled pork), \\"OMG\\" (tempura grouper, kimchi slaw, yuzu sauce, scallions), and \\"Inner Harbor\\" (crab cake, aioli, scallions).  All of them taste good but my favorite was the \\"Oh, Carolina\\" because it had more flavor and whoever filled my boa, really hooked me up!  \\n\\nWe ordered about 3 each and then decided to pick more up.  The \\"Inner Harbor\\" this time, taste better than the first only because my husband asked for more sauce.  Only if they added a tad more sauce to all of them, I'd probably order another round.  Later, we ended up taking home a couple to a friend of ours.\\n\\nAs far as service goes, they're really fast.  The line builds up and they just keep filling the orders quickly.  There are a couple of tables and chairs for eating in but mainly bar stools next to a counter on the wall.  It's a pretty cool spot just down the street from another cool spot that's similar but in a taco form.  If you want a quick bite to eat and on a budget, try this place.  Seafood boas are $3.75 and others are $3.50.  You can also order their combos and they offer deserts also."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I went to Craigie almost a month ago, on June 29th (My amazing boyfriend, Sahil G., took me there for my 21st birthday -- read his review too!). It's clearly taken me awhile to write this review, but the thing is, I can still taste the food. The flavors of all the amazing things I ate at Craigie are permanently imprinted in my mind and my mouth. Hands down, my meal at Craigie was the most memorable of my life (yes, I know I'm young, but still - it was extraordinary).\\n\\nSahil G. and I arrived about 5 minutes before our 7 PM reservation, and the very friendly hostess directed us to the bar for a drink while our table was prepared. Within seconds a waiter came to give us a cocktail menu, and then returned soon to take our order (Hendrick's gimlet for me, Sazerac for Sahil G.). Not soon after, the hostess came over and said that there had been a cancellation at the chef's table, did we want it? Um, YES. \\n\\nWe sat down at the Chef's Table -- bar seating right in front of the kitchen -- and our waiter came over to offer us water and drinks. We told him that we had put in an order at the bar, and he promised to go get him. I wish I remembered our waiter's name, because he definitely deserves compliments! He is tall, with medium length blonde hair. He was extremely attentive and polite. \\n\\nAbout five minutes later, another hostess came over to us with our drinks, which she told us had been comped because of the wait. I honestly felt that the wait was reasonable, but this is just a testament to the outstanding service that all of the wait staff at Craigie provides. The free drinks made me feel appreciated and important, which is exactly how you want to feel when dining at a nice restaurant (though sadly, this is often not the case). \\n\\nSahil G. and I had originally planned to do the 4-course prix fixe menu, but since we were seated at the Chef's Table, we felt obligated (both to the staff and ourselves) to see what they could do with the tasting menu. We told our waiter we had no dietary restrictions -- we wanted Chef Maws and his staff to give us whatever they wanted to. \\n\\nThe food was unbelievably good, and while the actual meal was \\"6 courses,\\" it actually ended up being 9 when you factor in the amuse bouches, etc. In order, we received:\\n\\nSeafood three ways (Squid noodles, smoked halibut, cod fritter)\\nHalibut ceviche with lemon oil and dehydrated corn\\nFried frogs legs with chorizo\\nRabbit and ancho chile filled pasta (this dish was my absolute favorite, hands down...I still dream about it, and I swear if I could pick my last meal it would be this)\\nVeal sweatbreads with hominy\\nDuck two ways -- confit and tea smoked breast\\nblackberry and plum sorbet\\nsheepsmilk yogurt cheesecake with blackberry tequila compote\\nsweet corn grits with brown sugar, raspberry compote, and anise ice cream\\nrhubarb hibiscus foam with yogurt\\n\\nEach dish was brought out by a waiter or manager who explained what was in the dish and how it was prepared -- and Chef Maws came out to explain the duck two ways, which was very cool. I could go on for hours, literally, about how good this food was, but I will refrain. You just have to go and eat there yourself.\\n\\nMy experience at Craigie was unforgettable. The food was out of this world, and so was the service. I absolutely cannot wait to go back there."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great pizza, so many choices, we had the sausage and sweet red pepper , it was very good , the only thing I did not like was the sausage was in big chunks and fell off , it would be better to use smaller bits so it would spread the flavor and stay on your slice, we lost some of the sausage because it rolled off on to the table and floor.\\nStill a great place , quick and fair priced with great taste."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This was my second visit and I liked it even more this time.

I said to the table, \\"I could eat here everyday for 2 months, have something different and delicious every single time. This place is amazing, there is NOTHING on this menu that I don't want to try!\\" I spoke too soon.\\nThe biggest draw that brought me into Bananas was the chicken & waffles, so naturally I ordered that, gravy on the side.  Luckily we ordered appetizers; wings and Hawaiian Mac & Cheese, because the server casually mentioned that my entree would take longer than the Philly Cheese Steak that my buddy ordered.  That makes sense, no problem.\\nBut an hour later, I began to wonder what part of my meal would require an HOUR of preparation...hmm\\n\\nWhen my meal showed up, gravy NOT on the side, I wasn't about to send it back considering my lunch would have then turned into an all day affair.  No big deal, I don't mind gravy and I'm truly not that picky.  Now, I could tell that the batter on the chicken was something creatively concocted and meant to add a bit of flair to the dish, but it was thick and doughy so with the addition of the gravy and the syrup from the waffles it quickly turned into a disgusting slimy old-stuffing-like goo.  Completely unappetizing.  Then there were the waffles, the floppy, limp, flavorless waffles, the best part of my my meal.\\n\\nThe thrill that I felt FINALLY getting to try Bananas, was something I desperately tried to hold onto, even after the utterly disappointing lunch.

The plate came out and the shrimp were translucent, gray and soft, not pink and firm.  I sent them back.  \\n\\n3.  The manager came out to tell me the shrimp were cooked.  First in boiling water and then grilled.  Clearly I, as well as the friends at my table who saw my meal disagreed.  I was so pissed by this point I told them I didn't want my dinner (mind you, we had been there for 1.5 at this point).  Why do you need to cook shrimp twice anyway?

Also, make sure you bring cash as it is cash only. Being cash only though the prices are very reasonable for what you get.

We ordered the local raspberry jam and the lingonberries and cream and were attempting to choose our other two crepes more when one of the owners showed us the size of the crepes, which were huge! We decided at that point that we better hold off on ordering any more. The crepes arrived quickly and were excellent. We were quite full with just the two crepes, but they were so good that we had to order one more. We decided that the \\"mounty\\" sounded delicious with its maple marcapone filling - with the exception of the bacon crumbles, as my best friend is vegetarian. The owner was happy to customize our crepe and make it bacon-free and actually charged us LESS to do so.

Powells, of course.  Whole Foods right across the street, which seems like a mecca toward which you have crawled over a trackless wasteland after living on the coast, as I do, where the pickings are very, very slim.  Stumptown Coffee.  Cheryl's on 12th.  Doc Martens.  The Saturday Market down at the river.\\n\\nThe hotel itself is arty, darkly lit, and fun.  The first time I stayed there, I felt uncertain about the European-style hallway bathrooms.  Like, what if you NEED the bathroom at a time when everybody else does, too, and they all got there first?  Never happens.  It just never has.  I've stopped worrying about it and have continued to appreciate the pricing above any other consideration.  I'm familiar with a couple other downtown hotels and if I want to pay twice as much as I do at the Crystal so I can enjoy that good old-time carefully bland uniformity, astronomically priced valet parking, and room service at a premium, etc., etc. that's always an option.  At the Crystal this time I landed in the Merle Haggard room, where the lyrics painted on the wall say, \\"I think I'll just stay here and drink.\\"  I defy you to find that at a Hilton, Marriott, or Relais and Chateaux property!\\n\\nMcmenamins is fun.  The decor is a neverending delight.  The coffee downstairs is stout.  Their beds can be a little rough and hard.  I was in a room at their Olympic Club (Centralia, WA?  Chehalis, WA?  I forget which) last week and its bed felt the same as the Crystal's, although in fairness, I don't remember thinking that when I've stayed at their Gearhart,  Edgefield, or Kennedy School hotels.  In any case, I slept well at both places where the beds seemed hard so maybe rough and hard works for me?  The earplugs provided in the bedside table helped.  Traffic noise IS a constant.\\n\\nI WANT to be free of TVs and have never noticed the absence of a closet because I'm not traveling on business.  My clothes can handle being draped over a chair and the room had hangers and a rack anyway.  Parking IS an issue.  This trip, I got lucky on the street and could feed the meter.  When that doesn't happen and you have to find a garage, it's pricey and can feel like a long, cold slog back to shelter through the rain.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that I'm a fan and feel just slightly protective of the place because people thinking \\"hotel\\" may have some mental adjustments to make, whereas I was delighted by it on sight and have remained happy over repeated visits.\\n\\nP.S.  The four stars rather than five is a reflection of how much I wish better lighting options existed in the rooms.  I read in bed and their hotels are DARK.  Lighting fixtures everywhere, a fantastic, crazy abundance of them and still dark.

Thanks F2O for a great lunch and we expect to be back in the near future."},{"name":"Arhiboo Shawarma","address":"4865 Memorial Dr","city":"Stone Mountain","stars":"4","text":"Great food, great service, love the garlic sauce they put on the meat!

The minute we sat down, no one took our drink order for like 10 minutes. We sat there looking around trying to make eye contact and not even one waiter stopped to ask we would like to drink. \\n\\nSo I made eye contact with a nice lady (I think she was the manager) and asked her if we can get some water. We finally did and then placed an order for a Guinness and some apps. Once we were done eating the apps, we sat around for another 10 minutes or more trying to place our entree order. So we had the hostess take our order bc we could not get a straight answer who our waiter was.\\n\\nWe placed the order for our meals with her and then a male waiter (I didn't grab his name) a minute later asked us what we'd like to eat Too late, but thanks anyway after the fact that we just placed our order.\\n\\nSo my wife got her soup, but was given NO spoon. She waited 5 min to finally get it.\\n\\nI got my steak (which was very good), but was not given a steak knife. So I told our male waiter if I can get a steak knife and he said, \\"Sure. Be right back.\\" I then waited for 5 min until I reached out again to ask him for that steak knife. He said, \\"Oh, I'm sorry.\\" He finally brought it over but by that time, my steak was cold.\\n\\nWe had a third party come late for dessert. Once we all finished our desserts, my wife asked the waiter if he could wrap her dessert up and order an additional one to take home for her dad. He repeated what she said to make sure it was correct and when we got home, her portion was missing. Our server was totally incompetent.\\n\\nThe worst part was we tipped him close to 18% (generous for what we experienced) when we really should have tipped him much lower. After he took our bill, he came back to remove our plates and gave my friend a 'dirty' look, according to him. And our friend who joined us late is a PRIEST so he wouldn't lie and make it up.\\n\\nIt's the little things that make a good restaurant great. This place didn't do the little things and this resulted in the service being terrible which is odd bc the previous visits have been great. Aquitaine is a 5 star restaurant so I expect the service to be top notch. It wasn't which was disappointing.\\n\\nOverall: D-"},{"name":"The Tomato and Cheese","address":"892 N Main St","city":"Randolph","stars":"3","text":"All most all the time I order here my order is messed up.

But finally writing a belated review so let me give you a warning: this is definitely going to be long. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is generally very friendly and casual. There never seems to be a crowd as there are few other Korean restaurants down the street. The servers can be a bit intimidating but if you be nice they're willing to accommodate you in any manner. \\n\\nThe pricing of the food seems decent, however I kind of feel that the Korean barbeque items are a bit overpriced as well as certain Korean entrees. Regardless, I still like to try things. \\n\\nOn too my long food list: I am combining all the food I remember from a few visits, so don't judge me by the length .\\n\\nJapchae: good, not to bad. Noodles were better than some places as it was well flavored and wasn't drenched in oil! The bits of vegetable and beef was proportional to the noodles which I like since I hate when there is too much of one without the other. Its not balanced. \\n\\nSeafood bibimbap: comes out on a beautiful bowl. However a little lacking in flavor as there's not much bibinbop sauce that is usually paired with it. The plate is served on a stone bowl so its sizzling hot and the rice at the bottom forms a nice little crisp . \\n\\nDumplings: probably homemade dumplings and they're quite heavily filled. There's so much filling and honestly the flavor seems to change very time I visit . it either is too bland or too salty . I love dumplings so I'm open to flavors yet picky as well. \\n\\nShumai: usual fried Japanese crab dumplings. Probably store bought , tastes pasty though . \\n\\nSashimi appetizer : good the first time which all the fih was extremely fresh, went the second time and fish seemed to be lifeless. The slices has decreased in size and they gave us octopus which was a nice change. \\n\\nNaruto:typical raw seafood in cucumber wrapped roll, fish doesn't taste fresh though. \\n\\nJan ban guk soo : not set up in the traditional manner with julliene vegetables. This is a cold noodle dish that is serve with vegetables, soba noodles and eggs on ice chips.it is similar to korean naegmyun, which is cold noodle soup. Its a different taste. It tastes light, but I feel as though yasu didn't execute well. So I look forward to trying elsewhere. \\n\\nSweet and sour garlic chicken : deep fried batter chicken chunks in  chilli garlic sauce. It kind of looks better than it tastes. Comes out on a large platter as the serving is huge . I you like sweet and sour covered deep fried stuff than this is for you , the taste grows on you . unfortunately the thing is the chicken chunks seemed kind of old . \\n\\nSpicy rice cakes: pretty good, not too spicy. Very well balance in ration of rice cake, fishcakes and vegetables. The rice cakes are on the just a little past pasta al dente texture. \\n\\nDumpling rice cake soup : this soup is amazon. Love the nice pieces of beef and the bowl is rather large so it can be even eaten with some of the rice. I think the dumplings go better in the soup rather than fried/steamed when coming here. \\n\\nAgedashi tofu: deep fried tofu in a ponzi sauce which is alright. Not too impressed since the tofu is always half sauced and the other half is naked and cold \\n\\nSteamed tofu: 4 pieces that are steamed, came out lukewarm. Really displease d. \\n\\nGrill: seafood combo: comes with salmon, which was marinated just right , but when they grill it for you skin side down, they destroyed the integrity of the fish. It was basically all chopped up into smaller pieces. Squid: cut into large square pieces and tasted bland. Shrimp&lobster, really really salty. Scallops were pretty good though \\n\\nOhsam bulgogi: pork and squid marinate together. It tasted a lot better than the seafood combo as the marinated was in unison. \\n\\nChicken bulgogi: typical bulgogi marinate, a little bland an chicken was dry. Ended up taking this home, stir fried with large rice noodles and some chicken stock to give it back some life. \\n\\nBeef bulogi: great marinate, just on the money. \\n\\nSamgyupsal: my favorite BBQ item. I love that it came with a ton of lettuce this time. And it was really good. \\n\\nIn general, its an okay place for foods. But service is lacking. Don't come if you aren't patience or tolerable."},{"name":"Pino's Pizza","address":"1920 Beacon St","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"I wish I didn't live 3000 miles from you, Pino mi amor.

It was OK.  I was not overly impressed with their menu or drink selection.  Appitiser selection was less than impressive to me, not alot of variety and very small.

Incase you are a OCD type like me and hate Bacardi mixed with Pepsi - be happy to know this place has Coke products.  I'm sorry it's a big difference to me.  Staff was very pleasant and very accomodating.\\n\\nTwo things I thought were lame - it was a bit chilly yesterday afternoon and since I didn't have a jacket I was pleased to find they had heaters on the roof deck.  I was then bummed to find out that they \\"don't have them connected for the summer\\".  Seriously??  Who disconnects wired heaters that are permanately attached to the wall.  IDK.   The other thing is that the bathrooms are small.  After a near miss of some dude urinating on me, hello!!  lock the door dumbass, I finally got in to the ?closet? Oh god no this is a toilet!

My only suggestion is that they expand their dessert menu, despite the fact that no one had room for dessert by the end of the meal.  I'm surprised it wasn't busier for a Thursday night, but this block of Yaletown sometimes gets forgotten. It will be a shame if House Special doesn't get the recognition that it deserves.

However, rest assured, beneath the rubble of hipsters, slovenly vagrants, and overzealous tourists, there lies a beacon of culinary hope. That beacon is the Porter Beer Bar.\\n\\nFood: Most people venture to The Porter for their extensive beer selection, but I'm pleased to report that they also feature a fairly well-executed food menu. The menu features around a dozen appetizers and close to ten different sandwiches. During my recent visit for Saturday brunch, my dining partner and I enjoyed the mac n' cheese, goat cheese fritters, and the buttermilk hotcakes. The mac n' cheese was comprised of a three cheese blend (bechamel, asiago, and cheddar) and was extremely flavorful. The goat cheese fritters were amply filled with goat cheese and equally as delicious. However, the real standout was the hotcakes, which were topped with bananas flambe and toasted pecans - simply exceptional.\\n\\nService: The staff were pleasant and efficient throughout the entire dining experience. The vast majority of patrons sit at the bar, but the staff are still diligent about ensuring that the tables are adequately serviced.\\n\\nAtmosphere: The Porter is low key and welcoming, complete with hand-crafted wooden booths and exposed brick walls. I imagine this place must get incredibly crowded in the evenings; however, it was nearly empty around noon on a Saturday, which was surprising given the caliber of the brunch they offer.\\n\\nCost: Inexpensive considering the quality of the food. Appetizers range from $3.50 to $9.25, while sandwiches and main courses range from $9.95 to $12.75. All sandwiches are accompanied by herb fries and arugula salad can be substituted for an additional $2.00.\\n\\nOther: Parking in Little Five is not for the weary. If you choose to park in one of the nearby lots, you will undoubtedly have to pay at least $5.00. However, to save yourself some heartache and a few dollars, I'd recommend parking along McLendon Ave (turn east at the Zesto) and taking the short walk to Moreland Ave."},{"name":"New India Cuisine","address":"2304 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Outstanding food!

Being our first time, we didn't know what to do, and the girl behind the counter barely said anything in response to questions. But whatever, I'm here for the pizza ... This place is BUSY, and seating is quite limited inside. And when they're busy, expect a long wait for your pie to arrive.\\n\\nAfter 20+ minutes, it finally came. So was it worth the wait? Definitely. Was it worth the hype? Close, but no cigar.\\n\\nThe good: It had a ton of flavor, and I loved the fact that some bits were a bit charred. The crust had a magnificent flavor to it, as did their sauce. It was also clear that the ingredients they were using were top-notch. Easily among the best tasting pizzas I've had in the area.\\n\\nThe Bad: Once you got passed the outer few inches the pizza was quite soggy. Whatever the reason, nothing changes the fact that the pizza was soggy. I don't know if it's good or bad to say that the next day, the pizza was better because the sogginess had a chance to abate quite a bit.\\n\\nWe do plan on going back because the pizza was really good.

I usually don't like sandwiches but this one was great. The croissant was fluffy and had that nice, light crunch. The ham was plentiful but not too much, and the pepper jam was very tasty.

Shocked, I said oh no thank you, I'm all set.  She left and my husband said to me \\"did you say something??\\" - to which I answered no.  I purposely did NOT say anything because I didn't want to make a scene.  \\n\\nI had the swordfish, which was much less cooked than I like, and small pieces for the price.  \\n\\nIn the end I really just wanted their burger.

Confused, I told him I had ordered the pizza a few days ago, but that I no longer needed the pizza THREE DAYS LATER.

Granted, I probably would have taken it if they called beforehand and told me they were delivering, but I was not expecting the delivery when it arrived.\\n\\nA few days later, I saw that they had still gone ahead and charged me for the pizza that I had not accepted.

The soup was awfully thin.\\n\\nShanghai noodles - I think they used the wrong type of noodles (looked like udon?)  Colouring was off (way too pale) but this may not be a bad thing.  No beef chunks.  Instead, they literally used thin strips of BBQ pork (cha siu).  As for mushrooms, they used button mushrooms fresh out of Safeway, as opposed to shiitake.\\n\\nYes the food here sucks, but it wasn't life-changing (or ending) crapola.  So, I'm going to raise the average of this restaurant (as of the time of writing) from 1 to a mind-blowing 1.2 stars.  Yay!  My friend and I kept chuckling at the sheer crappiness the whole time we were here.  I suspect we'll be laughing about this place for weeks to come."},{"name":"J.

This place should serve good bar food with cold beers flowing all night long. \\n\\nThis places matches most of those needs for any sports fan. What a nice layout for watching sports. The atmosphere when my friends and I where here was pretty good. Tons of flat screens to watch all the games on and they even had classic arcade games for an added distraction. As we sat down to watch our Home teams playoff game, we had to grab a waitresses attention. Not a great first impression but worth noting because the customer service seems to be a continuous issue according to the yelp reviews.\\n\\nFortunately for us the service actually got better from that point on. Our waitress was a very pleasant young lady who catered to our large groups needs. She never stayed away to long and continuously checked in on us as the night went on. We must've been there for over 4 hours. The drinks were strong and the food had that great Portland twist on you're standard comfort bar foods. We ordered the wings, tatchos (tater tots dressed like nachos) the spinach dip and a plethora of other tasty dishes.\\n\\nOverall our experience was good. The interior could use some updating and the defiantly need to diversify what sports to show on the tv's. At times they would play the same games throughout the bar, despite there being other multiple games on different channels.

My friend went about a month ago and had a similar experience of having to wait 45 minutes past her reservation to be seated. She was given the same excuse about the table having the check. I know this is just the line they use because my original reservation was for 7. At some point while we were waiting I told the hostess that we would only be 6 as the 7th was sick. The table we sat at was for 6 people and in no way could've been made a table for 7 so obviously people waiting for the check weren't holding up \\"our\\" table. I understand they were busy but the fact that they weren't even apologetic about waiting an hour past our reservation was disheartening. The food was good, but I wouldn't say it was any better than any of the other high end steak houses in Boston.

The overall goal of a restaurant is good food and good service and it was a double fail on both accounts.   I have tried this place twice because I really want to like it... but the kitchen appears to have a chef that isn't that good, sorry.   On top of a poor kitchen, they overcharge on all food menu items.   There were many mistakes in service as well as a good portion of our orders were incorrect, drinks were missed and it took 15 minutes to get an espresso on two occasions.\\n\\nMy order for dinner was shepard pie, chicken and waffles, fish and chips, fried green tomatoes that I shared with a date.  I was really looking forward to the shepard pie, but it was borderline inedible.   The meat was super dry, tasted old and had a real funky super sweet taste while served over instant mashed potatoes and I almost got a gag reflex from it .. just not a good rendition of a classic comfort food.  \\n\\nThe fried green tomatoes had batter so thick that it ruined the dish and they were served cold.  They were left on the plate with two bites out of them... one from me and one from my date.\\n  \\nOn a better note, even though the fish and chips had the same super thick batter, they were nice and crispy.   The fries were great, but the level of darkness on the fried fish leads me to believe that the fryer oil doesn't get changed often enough and points to a lack of kitchen caring.  \\n\\nThe best part of the meal was the chicken and waffles, but even there... the hot bourbon syrup clearly reduced too long on the stove and was so thick it was less runny than cold honey... but the flavor was good.\\n\\nSecond attempt at this place was today for breakfast and it was a hot mess... worse than dinner.  My bacon sucked, no way around it.  It was floppy and as limp as a deflated balloon without the fat rendered out of it.  It had no bacon flavor to it... not sure how that is even possible for such a perfect food.   The corn beef hash I ordered came stone cold, literally almost had ice inside.   I let my server know and it came back to me exactly the same way on the plate undisturbed within a minute,  hotter and wetter consistent with just throwing it in a microwave.  \\n\\nTo top it off, I got Eggs Benedict that had an undetectable amount of hollandaise sauce on it.  Home fries were mediocre at best although they were probably the best of my terrible breakfast.   They said they had homemade English muffins for the Eggs Bennie but they were out of the bacon leek muffins and the one I got seemed like a Thomas English muffin untoasted to me.  The slice of ham was just a touch thicker version of deli meat with no ham flavor and did no justice to Canadian bacon (even though I didn't order it like that).  I asked for my Eggs Bennie to be served over corned beef hash... when they came out traditional the waitress said \\"he's used to making the same types of benedicts\\" and didn't offer to fix it... just put in for a side order of corn beef hash that was a total fail.  \\n\\nOn a good day, this restaurant has the quality of food of a dive bar but at a higher end restaurant prices.  It was $79 for 5 of us not including tip to eat breakfast that was terrible with below average service.   If you are paying almost $20 a person for breakfast,  you should not get out classed by McDonald's breakfast.

As a person not of the majority ethnicity, I am used to being treated unfairly from time to time (especially in Austin, where it happens much more frequently!), but to be treated unfairly and sometimes laughed at by two or more workers is not acceptable. I have now banned Mozart's because of that experience.

Okay, yes, the pizza is good - great flavor combinations, good sauce, good cheese, crust that mostly has good char (though mine was pretty soggy in the middle) and an atmosphere that is all the rage these days. But, there are too many things NOT good about it.\\nFirst and foremost, as other Yelpers have posted, the service is horrendous!  The two cashiers up front could not give less of a damn about giving you any sort of service besides ringing you up.  The space is incredibly cramped and not comfortable at all, particularly the temperature of the main dining space - it wass unbearable during a marginally warm day.\\nNormally very good pizza, poor service and poor space design are not necessarily deal breakers for me, but the lack of food safety is what really concerns me and the reason why I will not return unless things change.  I am a veteran of  the food & beverage industry (no, I am not a competitor - the company I work for does not have a location anywhere near Antico nor do we do anything remotely similar to what Antico does.).  I am, however, a Servsafe instructor (nationally recognized food safety course), and what I saw during my visit to Antico should have customers very worried.\\n\\n- No time/temperature controls in place for the assortment of toppings they have sitting out on the prep area (one could argue that they go through enough product that it doesn't leave the temperature danger zone, but to follow the proper procedure, they should log the time they take ingredients out of the cooler - which I did not see them do).\\n- \\"Marrying\\" of ingredients that have been sitting out with new product taken out of the cooler.  Product taken from cooler was in a non-original container, was unlabeled and did not have date/time marking.\\n- Pizza makers wiping off sweat from their foreheads with bare hands, not washing their hands, then immediately going to make another pizza with the same bare hands.\\n- Owner walking in from the back door, and proceeding to make pizza without washing his hands.\\n- Overall lack of proper handwashing procedure - moving from uncooked food to ready to eat food without washing hands, not washing hands immediately after coming into kitchen from outside, not washing hands after clean up activities including handling trash\\n- Guests allowed to walk into prep area and take pictures while lacking proper hair restraint.\\n- The owner did not have proper hair restraint while making pizza nor did the \\"servers\\" while in the kitchen area.\\n- Employees drinking at prep area from open containers.\\n- In use wiping cloths were sitting on the prep area (right next to and touching the pizza that I saw them make).  They were not stored in proper sanitizer solution, in fact, there were NO sanitizer buckets visible anywhere in the very open kitchen.\\n- No sneezeguard over the open containers of pizza seasonings that guests are allowed to scoop from.  No time/temperature controls for said seasonings.\\n\\nTo a normal customer, most of these do not give off red flags, but all of these items together will result a failing health inspection score.  Speaking of health inspection, I made a point of looking for the score as I was leaving, but did not see it displayed anywhere.  According to Fulton County and the State of Georgia, an establishment's most recent health inspection score must be displayed within 15 feet of the front door.  I thought it was strange, so I attempted to look up the score online.  Again, it is no where to be found and I'm not sure the reason for this.  If Antico is not getting routinely inspected and is not compliant on so many issues, I am truly concerned about the possibility of foodborne illnesses becoming an issue for the many, many customers that frequent it. \\n\\nI wanted so much to like Antico and become a frequent customer as the pizza really was good (minus the soggy middle), but would rather not until proper food safety procedures are put in place."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I saw this driving by to the Aquarium and the next morning we were there.

If you go, definitely go in the evening or on the weekends when they are busy. It's when they slow down that the service suffers. The waitstaff has gone down hill in recent months, but I am hopeful for the future. I have been twice this week where the same server brought me the same wrong drink, and it took entirely too long. Both times, I ordered a double latte, even holding my hands out to show I wanted a big, big latte, and both times, the apathetic server brought me a tiny latte. Granted, if this is the biggest problem I have today, I'm doing pretty well. But the point is this: I want good service so I can love the place because the prices are still a bit above their price-point.  \\n\\nOther than that, their food is good, but they tend to nickel and dime the hell out of their guests without warning which is both tacky and unnecessary. For example, they will ask you if you want maple syrup with your pancakes, without mentioning their is a blend served with the pancakes normally. They don't mention the maple is actually three dollars extra until you get the bill--the pancakes are just a smidge over 7 bucks to begin with, so 3 bucks is a real smack in the face. \\n\\nLastly, and this needs to be said: Trident has the absolute nastiest bathroom in the whole Back Bay. Filthy and embarrassing. It's like Dane Cook (sorry for the reference) says about public restrooms: \\"EVERYTHING'S WET. It's like a shaggy dog just shook himself dry. I have chosen other cafes a number of times because I knew I wouldn't even number 1 in Trident's bathroom. \\n\\nOn the good side: it's open until midnight, which is rare in the area for a good cup of coffee.

I had the Cupcake Riesling - recommend it if you like an off-dry, not sweet white wine.\\n\\nThat was the highlight. I ordered the stuffed chicken entree which came with veg and mashed potatoes. I was curious why a baked potato would cost extra (see note at bottom of menu) but this became clear when the meal arrived. \\n\\nI also ordered a side salad, there was a $2 upcharge for this which the server didn't explain, but whatever, it's $2. Salad was very ordinary and the dressing, balsamic too tart for my taste. \\n\\nThe entree, the baked stuffed chicken was not good. There's no getting around this. It was apparently partially cooked on a stovetop in a saute pan with about 2 inches of oil because the chicken was clearly partially fried. There was no stuffing to speak of. The cheese on top was completely melted into a greasy puddle. The veg on the side was corn. Yep, corn. Nothing else. The mashed potatoes obviously from a box and laden with butter (and on  the watery side). Now you know why they charge extra for a real potato. The price for this entree is $15.99. Honestly, it might have cost them about $3 for the ingredients. Did I mention the veg was corn?\\n\\nMy husband's entree, salmon, was ok, he said. He got the rice pilaf, this is probably a better option, if possible. He didn't mind the corn.\\n\\nThe menu's other options are pretty much standard pub fare.

Because of jobs and budget, we could only go to the Universal park; luckily, we ordered express passes before our stay, and trust me, the express passes are totally worth paying for.

And if you are in a party of two or more, you are most likely to receive better service. But if you are a single diner, like I am, service may not be as good. I guess the bartenders and the wait staff feel that they will not receive much of a tip from a single diner.\\nBut I always tip well.

The exception is Quack's, which is where Mozart's gets a lot of its baked goods from anyways so win-win! Any time I have friends visiting from out of town, I always take them to Mozarts, and that's always their most memorable experience. There is a lot of outdoor seating, so there is always somewhere to sit if you're willing to go out onto the deck. There's a moderate amount of indoor seating, but if the weather is too hot/cold then your chances of getting some are hit or miss. \\n\\nOne complaint is the nasty, nasty bathroom that you have to walk outside to get to. There's only one of them so there's often a wait, it's not cleaned regularly, and several times that I've been there they've been out of soap (which is why I always carry hand sanitizer).

Over the past year, I've been there maybe 10 times.  Most of the times I've gone, I've had some version of the tasting menu, which are always different each time, thoughtful, creative, and with high quality seasonal ingredients.  If you do the tasting menu on all nights (except Sunday), you're paying over $100, depending on how many courses.  I know that is expensive, but to me it is worth every penny.  Execution of the food, the timing, and the flavor profiles are always an experience each time.  \\n\\nBut if you want a less expensive tasting menu with the same type of quality, go on a Sunday night at 9PM on, and there you can get a 6-course tasting menu for $57 (!!) called the Chef's Whim.  It is the best deal in the Boston area by far for the quality of food you're getting and what you're paying for.  The idea stemmed from the Craigie Street Bistro days where before the end of their work week, they would have quality ingredients left over, but not enough to make large portions or put anything permanent on the menu, due to the seasonality and availability of the ingredients.  Essentially, you're getting creative preparations with high end ingredients for a fraction of what you might be paying during the week.  \\n\\nThis restaurant easily has great ever-changing menu items.  Of course, the pig's head and the hamburger are stellar standouts, already written by a lot of people.  But to me, Craigie is a place where the best experience is when you submit your tastes to the will of the kitchen, and eat whatever they give you because you will be surprised each time.  Like I said, I've eaten there close to 10 times over the past year, and it's been great each time.  You get the same quality of food you'd get at the best of Boston restaurants (No. 9 Park, L'Espalier, etc) but in a less formal setting and in most cases, less expensive.  \\n\\nIn terms of service, I've always had amazing servers, bartenders, managers, etc.  Everyone was courteous, quite personable and knowledgeable about the menu and drinks.  The servers were always willing to give suggestions depending on your taste.  If there's any wine you're unsure about, you'll always get a taste of it first, even at the table.  Normally this happens when you're at the bar, but they do this readily at the table.  It's something small, but definitely makes you feel like the server's out for your best interests.  \\n\\nTheir bar program mirrors the mission of the kitchen.  They can make you any cocktail, but the menu focuses on creative craft cocktails.  This is not a beer garden, so no 20+ beers on tap.  They have a rotating selection of 4-6 beers on draft and a large selection of hard-to-find bottled brews.  The same with wines.  I'm not the biggest fan of white wines, but the sommelier at Craigie has certainly changed that.  I'm one of the many Americans that's caught up with the whiskey craze, and they have an impressive collection of scotch (including several Japanese whiskeys), bourbons, and rye whiskeys.  That being said, if you're a bourbon cocktail fan, go for the Mellow Yellow or the Golden Fizz.\\n\\nAnd they will remember you if you go there more than once a year (i.e. chef's whim Sun nights).  After I had been there only a couple times, they were throwing an extra course or amuse-bouche during my meal.  They appreciate regulars, and I think it's easier now more than ever to be a regular, and not just because of the chef's whim.  They recently started a late night bar menu which begins around 10 PM.  This usually ends up being 5-6 dishes at $6 each.  You put 2-4 of these dishes together, and you pretty much have a complete meal.  Like the chef's whim, this will not be average bar bites and will depend on what's available and fresh that day.  Menu items have included \\"shroom and eggs\\" (whatever wild fresh mushrooms paired with a fried egg...simple but delicious), pate and toast, smoked bone marrow (when available), and duck tenders.  They've also had various grilled octopus parts.  One night I went for the late night menu, they had an oyster/caviar dish.  I thought it would be fresh oysters topped with salmon roe or tobiko.  Instead, I got 2 fresh Duxbury oysters topped with foam and Beluga caviar...for $6 (Beluga caviar option usually goes for at least $30 in other restaurants). The menu is written on a small chalk board at the bar usually around 9:30ish, and it has 1-2 word description of each item, but you'll be getting much more than just that.  \\n\\nThe brunch here is pretty f***ing phenomenal too, but this review is already too long.\\n\\nSo go to this restaurant as soon as you can.  If you're tight on $$, go around 10 PM and grab some late night menu items for $6 a piece...or if you're willing to splurge a little, go for Brunch or better yet, go on a Sunday night after 9 PM for the chef's whim."},{"name":"Pinocchio Village Haus","address":"1180 Seven Seas Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Have you ever seen a five-year-old before?

We came here and were pleasantly surprised. Their flatbread pizza was a little smaller than a standard sheet of paper and covered with cheese from edge to edge.

The tomato in the caprese salad was not that sweet, and we probably could have gotten better mozarella at any grocery store.  For entres, I had the linguine with scallops in a pesto sauce, my boyfriend had the lobster ravioli, and our friends had the fettuccini with prosciutto and peas, and the fettuccini with swordfish and tuna pieces.  Of all the meals, I would say the lobster ravioli was pretty good, but the others were pretty bland and tasted fairly similar.  The pesto sauce in my linguini was extremely disappointing- I make my own pesto every summer and I could have made this dish much more flavorful.  The scallops were also pretty small and not very flavorful.\\n\\nTo top it all off, when I went downstairs to the restroom, I saw a stack of boxes of Barilla pasta, not exactly inspiring enthusiasm on my part.\\n\\nFor the price, I think you get decent food, and the service was good/fast considering the cramped quarters, but I don't understand why people would want to wait in line for this place (even at an early hour), or why so many people recommend it so highly.

Ordered delivery and the food took almost 30 minutes to be prepared. \\n\\nThe food was actually reasonably flavorful but not very authentic. \\n\\nThe salad was a little comical but it was included with the dinner combo. The dinner combo for $12 included a pad thai (very small portion comparatively to other thai restaurants) along with 2 spring roll (small spring roll) and 2 fried wonton (reasonable). It also included a side salad which was unseasoned - must have used the spring roll dip that was suppose to be for the salad. \\n\\nOverall, it was ok but the food prep was too slow to make the wait worth while. The value also wasn't there although it was a nice variety for the dinner combo, all the items were rather mediocre and not substantially portioned most of all the salad being pretty much a hand full of shredded vegetables.

The wait for for the food on a Saturday or Sunday anytime before 3pm is very, very long if you're in a party of three or more. Table of two seem to get seated fairly quickly but they had a hard time getting seats for three of us. The half sandwich with soup combo is a good choice, especially the tasty grilled cheese with tomato and bacon on challa bread. Our server was very sweet but really deserved to have a busser backing her up during the Sunday brunch rush, she was just overwhelmed between orders and trying to clear tables (we were sitting outside) and had a hard time getting to all her tables in a timely way. The bottled beer offerings are great for a small place. It's also fun to be able to browse the book store while you wait although that gets a little overwhelming as all the people waiting for tables combined with general shoppers makes the small store get crowded quickly.  \\n\\nI'd suggest this place for late afternoons and evenings or weekday breakfasts the food is good but not quite worth a 45 minute wait on the weekend.

I think Little Bangkok is an exception to the general phenomenon that \\"ethnic\\" restaurants tend to be better if most or all of the customers are of that ethnicity.  Or maybe I just think that because I'm not Thai or Chinese...\\n\\nAnyway, I opted for Thai dishes (Nau Num Tok, Cashew Chicken) and my dining partner in crime opted for Chinese dishes (Sizzling Rice Soup, Mongolian Beef).  The nau num tok was pretty decent, but not as good as usual - I think it was a little over-seasoned actually.  I tried the soup which was decent, but definitely not the best SRS I've had.  I also tried the mongolian beef which was a little crispier than usual (which I kind of liked), but it didn't have much depth of flavor and was a little too sweet I thought.  \\n\\nI ordered my cashew chicken as spicy as they could do it and was informed that it would make me cry.  When they brought it you could just tell by looking at it that it was going to be very spicy.  I was pretty amused that they brought a bowl of diced chilis and a bowl of chili paste \\"just in case\\" it wasn't hot enough.  Anyway, the dish wasn't hot enough to make me cry but it was really spicy and good.  I didn't need the spicy condiments. After we had finished our meal and were eating our tasty and complimentary orange slices, the server kinda sarcastically asked if I would still need the chilis and chili paste.  Cheeky bastard.  :)  \\n\\nAnyway, it was still good - the 2 Chinese dishes weren't particularly amazing and the nau num tok was a little under-par but it was still good all around.

My friend took me a while back b/c we were looking for food at like 930pm or something and when you live at the Arboretum, it's either go home and eat soup out of a can, or endure fast food orders that you know they'll mess up. #7 w/ a diet coke you say? Here's a # 4, hope you like orange soda.  So we went to Jollyville. \\n\\n I had the club sandwich w/ fries.  Ever had food so good, you become the world's greatest listener b/c you're too busy stuffing your fat face? The batter on the fries are awesome. Even when they start to cool down, they are still good b/c of the batter they use.  Very rarely will I go to a sports bar specifically to eat, but I've done so at Jollyville. \\n\\nI've come in by myself before since I live very close and never felt out of place.  The staff is the best bunch you'll ever meet at a sports bar.  They always appear to be enjoying themselves and b/c I tend to be intuned to the mood of others around me it makes it much more enjoyable when the staff is also having fun instead of moping around like the last thing they wanna do is bring you a beer.  This isn't a one time thing where I've noticed how friendly they are, it's consistently pleasant demeanor. \\n\\nThere is a jukebox so if you like to force others to your brand of music you can. I do it allll the time.  There's this golf game machine so if the ol' Ball n' Chain won't let you play actual golf you can release some of that energy here.  There's a shooting wild game machine so if you dislike left-wing extremists or PETA, this is your chance to really stick it to 'em. There's a trivia game machine at the bar but don't play that, that's mine. \\n\\nThe only thing is the signage could be better b/c that's what deterred me from coming in earlier. I couldn't figure out what exactly was going on while driving past at 50mph.  At night, maybe more neon would help b/c the sign although lit, is just white with black lettering. Also, when you turn, you have to turn right before the sign or you'll miss it, so it's made for some frustrating attempts the first couple times I tried to go.  But it's a really neat place and I enjoy it a lot!"},{"name":"Thai Town Restaurant","address":"1065 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is found by the food court at International Village.

There was another server however she seemed a bit confused since she didn't take the orders so didn't know who ordered what when the food came.\\n\\nThe service was a bit slow as our drinks took awhile and we had to ask several times for water.   After we got our orders and finished eating, we probably sat there for another 30-40 minutes chatting.  Our host/server was busy cooking for other people in the restaurant so she wasn't able to clear The tables.   The owner just sat there looking at us.  He never came to clear the tables, refill the water or help out the servers.  When we asked for the bill, he got up and went to our host/server to give us the bill while she was busy cooking.  She had to stop and sort the bills as the other server didn't know who ate what.  I felt so bad for our host/server. It was like she was the one-woman show.  There was another cook so she didn't have to cook it all but still, the guy could have done something instead of just sitting there.\\n\\nI would give the food 3.5 stars as it was really good.

The brownie bites had walnuts and were soft and moist, a wonderful combination. The tray also came with chocolate chip cookies too!!

The ambiance is quietly elegant and the greeting at the door is so very welcoming. Considering it was  a Tuesday evening,  the restaurant was extremely busy with every table taken throughout  our almost three hour dining experience.  Management personnel were continuously available  circulating throughout the dining room to check on diners at each table.  Assistant General Manager Rachel stopped by several times. Smiles and pleasantries were abundant.  And, now for a very important part of the evening: the delectable food and drinks.  The wine list is absolutely phenomenal! My husband enjoyed his Cabernet and  I was thrilled with the Red Sangria, a rich fruity drink. Drinks were  accompanied by a basket of olive and Italian bread in addition to a  dish of assorted olives in oil  making us both smile.  But then, the mouthwatering appetizers arrived, the burrata, consisting of tender prosciutto, creamy buffalo mozzarella and juicy sliced tomatoes,  as well as the Meatball with ricotta  -  both scrumptious!   Our smiles for the night then became even more heavenly!  Just the right amount of time elapsed before our two palate-pleasing entrees arrived. The Pappardelle Emiliana's rich bolognese dish and the braised short rib were excellent entree choices which my husband and I decided to share.  Our very pleasant waiter was a great listener and as a result, my request for well-cooked vegetables  rather than pasta to accompany the short rib was heeded.  He also made sure that we were not rushed but was always there to check in on us.  The finale deserved a drum roll:  refreshing sorbet served in the actual fruit's shell, one pineapple and one lemon - absolutely luscious!   Kudos to the owner of this fine establishment.

However, I want to write a comment regarding their winter light show this year. We have two small children and we drove up yesterday to see the lights. We double checked their website and it listed that the lights would be on until January 8. We drove in from Kyle to see it, yet we were rudely informed that the lights had been taken down last week. When we mentioned the info on their website, they just shrugged it off as something that they neglected to update. We were in line with at least 3 other families who had driven in from out of town, too.... Cedar Park, Liberty Hill, and Georgetown. No reparations were offered and instead, the barista actually rudely told another family to \\"get their children in check\\" when the little ones expressed their disappointment. I get that plans change, I also get that someone can forget to update a website.

The other two restaurants were about a two to three hour wait and this place sat us down after about 30 mins. (Still a wait but heck of a lot better than 2-3 hrs...) \\n\\nThe good news: once we were seated, we decided to order right away - 2 dozen oysters, clam chowder soup and a lobster roll. The wait for the food wasn't that long, despite the restaurant being quite packed. The food was definitely excellent: 1) oysters very fresh and meaty, 2) the clam chowder soup was definitely the best I've had so far and I definitely loved that there were chunks of clam, and lastly 3) that warm buttered lobster roll was to die for. Let me tell you, that lobster roll was definitely packed in. \\n\\nThe bad news: the only reason this place didn't get a complete 5 stars was because our waitress wasn't really attentive to us. I actually watched her walk over to the table next to us more times than she came to us. Also, after we ordered our 2 dozen oysters, we received our first 18 (we ordered 4 different kinds of oysters, 6 each, which would then leave 6 oysters). As we were eating, someone besides our waitress came over and asked about the food, we told her it was great and also mentioned that we hadn't received our last batch of oysters. She said she'd figure it out for us and we didn't think too much into it. It wasn't after we finished eating all our food, one of the bussers came over to clear our plates that we alerted him that we still hasn't received our last bit of oysters. Only then did our waitress come over, apologize and then promptly bring out the rest of our food. \\n\\nOverall: I was really impressed with the food and it was delicious. I was just a bit disappointed in the service. It's fine if the waitress decided to leave us alone to eat but it would have been nice for her to check up on us once in a while...just so we wouldn't have to wait for and receive the rest of the food with our check."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"fantastic place, the food is wonderful, always fresh pasta, gotta order the Diavlo sauce, its the best!

Money rip off - this place charges you EXTRA to get the 'fast pass'.  If you don't pay the extra amount, you get in a super super long line, in the sun, for the main HP ride.  \\n2. The make belief world is very superficial.  Most of the storefronts are just fronts, with nothing behind it.  There is a candy shop and a magic tricks shop.\\n3.  The small souvenir store has only a few items (the wands and the robe).   Disney would have made a killing on the merchandise, but this place sold squat.  \\n4.   There is no picture of the 3 main characters (HP, Hermione, or Ron), probably because Univ. didn't want to pay the royalty?  which limits the merchandise a LOT.\\n\\n5.

Some of the reviewers do understand Indian food, and the reality is that Portland, in general, has really, really bad Indian restaurants. If this were London, it would probably be a two-star review. But we're not in London, and the truth is that Tandoor is one of the few Indian restaurants in Portland that cooks food fresh daily. If you've eaten at the restaurants in NW and SE, you've probably come to expect Indian food to taste a particular way. That's because most of it is two-day-old food with lesser quality ingredients. Everything is fresh at Tandoor, though if you're getting the last of a dish in the buffet, it certainly doesn't taste the same as when the tray is full.\\n\\nThe problem with Tandoor is that the food really is the best part. The ambiance isn't very good, there's never more than one server to fill your water (and sometimes zero servers), and there's nearly always Indian music videos playing on a TV in the restaurant. I don't know if the restaurant is currently open for dinner (it changes from time to time), but when it is, I encourage you to go. The owner will make a dish however you want it, and the flavors are excellent.

You go into another restaurant (Padee) and then to the back where there is a bookcase that opens into a secret room.  A very \\"speakeasy\\" feel.  The focus is on the meal, so the waitstaff will introduce the courses but will generally leave you alone until the next course.  The kitchen is open, so you can see the authenticity of the ingredients and preparation.  Frankly, we enjoyed this rather than finding this distracting.  It has a very Thai feel.  The wine pairing was spot on to compliment the flavors of the food.  If you are looking for a touchy-Feely experience in fluffy chairs, you should probably go to elsewhere.

REALLY?\\n\\nThis is the worst eating experience I have ever had.\\n\\nWe had reservations for 9 PM and when we sat down and looked at the menu, I immediately got the feeling that we had made a terrible mistake. Mainly, because of the prices. My partners suggested that we just stay and go all out since we were already here, so we ordered the 6 item tasting menu, which is $100 a person. Who knows? Maybe we would be impressed.\\n\\nWell, we were not impressed. Mostly because the portions were so small that it was hard to justify what we were doing sitting through dinner.\\n\\nWhat followed were 2 delicious plates and 4 disappointing ones. We were served 3 little amuse bouche, which were forgettable, a whole wheat fussily pasta, what appeared like a grilled tuna dish, a venison steak and sausage dish that was actually very tasty, a pathetic tiny scoop of sorbet (which counted as a dish!), and a dessert consisting of ice cream (again) and a chocolate cake. This was all served to us over the course of 2 hours. Mostly boring plates, and tiny portions. Is this the best a restaurant can do for $100 a person? Our total bill (with tip) was close to $300. What an outrage!\\n\\nNow, we are just a young couple living in Boston. We are not food critics. Why should anyone listen to what we have to say? I just feel like all fanciness aside, what should be the purpose of preparing ANY meal? It's to satisfy, right? We did not get this at Craigie on Main. Far from it. The fault might be with us because we were hungry. Big mistake. We had to get two (!) orders of those bread basket to make up for how poorly the food satisfies.  Also, for a restaurant that's known for their burgers, would it hurt so much to highlight it more? How about a little slider for the customers since portions are such an issue here? \\n\\nSo, you have a terribly expensive restaurant here, which serves average food. Why should anyone come here? The answer is that they shouldn't. There are many better restaurants in Cambridge that are worth your time and money, such as Green Street and Oleana. Oleana actually won a James Beard award, so why not just go there instead? It's a 10 minute walk from Criagie on Main. In fact, we could have eaten 2 or 3 meals at any of those restaurants for what we paid at Craigie on Main.\\n\\nCriagie on Main is so far the most disappointing eating experience I've ever had anywhere. People can argue about the originality, the skill of the chef, the quality of the ingredients, but honestly, none of that applies to our dining experience. We just felt angry and very very cheated.  My partner and I both agreed, \\"That was a complete waste of money.\\" As such, it's the only restaurant I will openly tell people to avoid.\\n\\nCraigie on Main gets one star because at least the staff was very friendly.

These restaurants are a rare breed and so uncommon that you almost want to keep the secret to yourself, because with time, everyone will find out about your hidden gem. And while Mount Dora may be known for its arts scene and Christmas decor that rivals Disney's, it's now time to add a new accolade to their list. Chef Norman Van Aken, Florida's only multiple James Beard Award-wining chef recently opened his newest restaurant. 1921.\\n \\nSituated in a converted home built in 1921, the opening of Chef Van Aken's highly anticipated restaurant completes the Mount Dora Modernism Museum complex.  Unique to Central Florida, the restaurant features an extensive collection of artwork from Tiffany glass to Murano light fixtures, and there are also select pieces on loan from the Modernism Museum which is located conveniently across the street.\\n \\nTheir menu offerings will change regularly, providing guests the opportunity to experience a wide selection of fresh Florida flavors. 1921's Wine Director, Scott Geisler, works closely with the culinary team to complement the menu, selecting from the restaurant's list of global wines varying from eclectic to familiar, recent releases, and storied vintages. Rumor has it they are also working on a wine cellar which will house exceptional vintages and varietals. We're just hoping for cellar dinners in the future!\\n \\n1921 delivers on cuisine that is equal parts creative, fresh and exceptional. Their menu lives up to its chef's James Beard awards, and in time Chef Van Aken may just see his name alongside a Beard nomination for his latest creation.\\n \\nWhen you visit, make sure these dishes end up on your table:\\n\\nHeirloom Tomatoes: I'd consider myself a tomato connoisseur, most of my life I've been obsessed with this vegetable (or fruit....tomato, tomahto right?). Beefsteak, Roma or San Marzano, the heirloom tomato reigns king in my book. This particular dish with watermelon, avocado and crumbled Cotija cheese doesn't just have tomatoes, it makes them the star.\\n\\nPlantain Flatbread: A perfectly prepared flatbread base topped with cave aged cheddar and pork jowl bacon. I could have eaten the entire thing by myself, but this was the first of many, many courses. A nice option for dining at the bar alongside one of their cocktails.\\n\\nRoasted Florida Red Snapper: Straight from the ocean to my plate, and served over a bed of subtle coconut curry with a side of charred pineapple and pumpkin. This dish is a Florida September on a plate - all summer with a touch of fall.\\n\\nFried Cornish Hen: There's a sweet, yet touch of spice flavor found in this dish. Coupled with cola collards made from Mexican Coca-Cola and steaming mac n' cheese, this fabulous twist on a classic Southern meal is both elegant and rustic.\\n\\nDevil's Food Cake: The cake's layers of chocolate ganache enclosed by a decadent peanut butter frosting makes for the perfect ending. 1921's confections are equally as impressive as their main event.\\n\\nGeorgia Peaches Shortcake: A delicate, yet incredibly flavorful dessert with peach custard, brown sugar crumble, peach jam and whipped cream.\\n\\n1921 is so worth the short drive from Orlando - make an afternoon of it and explore all that Mount Dora has to offer."},{"name":"Jimmy John's","address":"8838 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"I got delivery for the first time from this place.

Well this past Sunday the lady and I decided to take advantage of the fact that the Big Creek Greenway can deliver us by bicycle from our neighborhood right up to very near 5 Seasons. We sat at the bar, drank some Oktoberfests and ordered half-price small plates (between 5 and 6 o'clock; our luck.) The lamb tacos were recommended by Jasper behind the bar (he nailed it; they were wonderful) and the Georgia cheese plate was one of the best cheese plates I've ever had. The cheese plate comes with three cheeses (presumably all made in Georgia) accompanied by a berry compote, pecans, pine nuts, some earthy cured pork (Ossabaw, perhaps?) and a loaf of the spent-grain bread. I should mention here that any visit to 5 Seasons should include the spent-grain bread. It can be ordered on its own for a buck or two.\\n\\nAll those flavors on the cheese plate created so many combinations to try and it just turned out to be the perfect Sunday evening light dinner.

I have, unfortunately, had to seriously downgrade my previous 4-star recommendation solely because of the continuing mediocre service.  \\n\\nThe wait staff here is young and, it appears, they don't want to be overbearing but it all translates to poor, uncaring service.  Our visit was on a Thursday, early around 7pm.  The restaurant was 1/3 full and there were four wait staff in the dining room.  So it wasn't a busy night. \\n\\nOur gal last night forgot to tell us about the specials until after two of our party of four had already ordered.  We all had drinks and asked for water.  The drinks were unceremoniously dropped on our table in front of the closest guest - no effort to actually place them infront of the person who ordered it.  She brought two beers, no glasses and when asked for a glass it took over 5 minutes for it to arrive.  Really, we're paying $16 - $25 for an entree here, this isn't a bar or Applebee's - we'd really like our beer in a glass and, preferably a chilled one.  The bottle of wine was deposited in much the same way.  (We're in a \\"wine\\" place - Village Wines).  The wine was opened somewhere other than our table and was not presented to us, we weren't offered a taste nor was the wine poured into our glasses!  I'm really not into the pretentious stuff but I still think wine should be opened at the table, offered to taste and simply poured (read that \\"served\\") into our glasses.  The water didn't come until way after our salads were delivered (I say delivered because they were handed to the closest guest to pass to the person who ordered it rather than being placed (served) to the guest themselves.  The entrees were delivered with the same method - handed out to the closest person who had to hold up their finished salad plates because the waittress never bothered to clear them away.  Our gal then never checked back, no water refills, no asking if our meals were to our liking, no checking in whatsoever.  She later dropped our checks at the table despite the fact that two of us were still eating.  We all wanted dessert or an after-dinner drink to finish but she didn't even offer one. We asked for the dessert menu and she rattled off two offerings.  We asked for coffee and/or cappucino and she said their cap machine never works and the coffee wasn't brewed.  She never picked up the checks?!?!  She really seemed to be discouraging us.   I guess she had enough of us and we were dismissed.  \\n\\nThis gal is obviosly new to the restaurant industry, we've only seen her here once before so we really can't lay all the blame on her,  but who in the heck trained her?  Who is checking to ensure the guests are being kindly treated?  Sadly, there was no manager checking into the dining room guests last night nor is one ever apparant.  This experience is not a new one, the service is definately lack luster here all the time.  There is no hustle, no caring about presentation of the food/wine to the customer, no obvious delight to have repeat customers.   I love the food here, I love the vibe in both the bar & restuarant areas but I'm not going to pay these prices without good service.

They were not - but the sauce was outstanding and I wouldn't change a thing (except maybe the service, fries and cole slaw).  I'm giving the place, and the meal, 4 stars.

It's OK, but it's nothing like Smitty's, Kruez, or Cooper's.  If you love BBQ, you know those names.\\n\\nWe made the trip to Driftwood on a Saturday.  The check in stand was unattended.  I asked the girl sitting a foot away if she could help me, and she pointedly informed me that she was  person who handled folks *already* on the list, NOT the person who took names.  As if that mattered.  Then the hostess returned and berated us a second time for daring to ask the other person (they are standing/seated shoulder to shoulder) to put our name on the list.\\n\\nWe got our pager and waited for 25 minutes.  When we finally proceeded inside, the second, indoor hostess station was also unattended.   Learning our lesson outside, we patiently waited until that young woman decided to return.  It was only four or five additional minutes; however, time was beginning to lose meaning.\\n\\nImagine our surprise to enter the main dining room and see that more than half the tables were empty!  We'd just sat outside in 100 degree heat for half an hour, when there was enough empty table space inside, in comfortable AC, to reconstruct an aircraft carrier flight deck?   Amazing.\\n\\nThe hosted seated a family of four at a small table on the wall that was 3 foot square... remember... there were dozens of emply picnic tables... dozens... and she seated us shoulder to shoulder on a table too small to hold our plates.  We took matters into our own hands, and moved to a larger table.  BBQ Nazis be damned.\\n\\nFinally a waiter appears and asks for drink orders.  My wife had seen the lemonade stand by the door and asked for lemonade.  The waiter said, \\"We don't have lemonade on the menu.  You can't order that, but if you want to go outside and buy a glass that would be fine.\\"  My jaw hit the floor.  They sell lemonade by the door, but you can't buy lemonade once you step inside?  I replied, \\"I'd tell you  how ridiculous that sounds, but given our experience so far, I'm pretty sure it would be wasted breath.\\"  We ordered ice tea instead.\\n\\nI was really counting on the meal to save the day.  Unfortunately it was bland, dry, and tough.  If you are going to serve bland, dry, tough BBQ, at least have the decency to serve with a sharp knife.  No, we got a butter knife that was so dull, everyone passed their plates to dad so he could apply some elbow grease to cut the ribs and brisket.  It wasn't quite the \\"Christmas Vacation\\" meal with a dog \\"yacking on a bone\\" under the table, but it was not a destination BBQ experience.\\n\\nSo how to explain this?  After years of great Salt Lick trips and food?  I've got a few theories, and here they are.\\n\\n1.  The place is too big and no longer attended the way it was when founded by Thurman Roberts.  Of course, he died a long time ago, but I suspect when son Scott decided to turn 500 acres and $50 Million into a \\"Napa Valley\\" vineyard and attractions a few years ago, the meat just isn't the focus of things any longer.\\n\\n2.  Salt Lick expansion.  There's a Salt Lick at the ABIA, there's a Salt Lick in Round Rock.  There's Salt Lick seasonings and sauces, and now, a Salt Lick wine.  Again, if the meat isn't the focus, I just don't see it being anything other than a Denny's that serves BBQ.\\n\\n3.  Complacency.  When people come by the busload to throw money at you, the staff just decides that customer service isn't important.  Our experience with the wait, the seating, the drink orders, and the ATTITUDE, was just not like the Salt Lick of old.  \\n\\nThe setting is still bucolic, and it makes for a nice drive. Next time we make a PILGRIMAGE for BBQ, we'll be heading to Lockhart, Elgin, or Llano.  Driftwood is no longer on that list."},{"name":"SOHO Restaurant","address":"4300 Paces Ferry Rd SE, Ste 107","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Easy location off the Highway in the Vinings area.

I have to agree with some other reviewers who left feeling that they paid a lot more than what they actually ate and enjoyed. Not to mention that our food came out came out about 5 min after ordering. \\nThe cocktails were great, I had the Northern Lights and my wife had a drink very similar to the Old Cuban at Eastern Standard except with St Germain. I ordered the burger and added bacon. Wife ordered the Octopus app and brussel sprouts cooked in duckfat as a side. \\nMaybe it was just the burger hype that left me feeling let down, but I must say I was a bit underwhelmed. The meat itself was amazing. tasty, juicy and cooked to perfection medium rare as they suggest. The big picture was just not \\"life changing\\" as our waitress had asked me following a few bites...Life changing is the Suribacha burger at Swagger in KC! The bun was too small for the burger and with all the juices flowing, things became very soggy, very quickly. The bacon was also not all that cooked which was a turn off. For $21 and all the hype, I definitely expected more. My wife's octupus was good, but not $17 good and the brussel sprouts were also very good. The bar menu leaves you with very limited choices now since they combined it with the regular menu and now all apps are $17 and ala carte entrees $27.  Our waitress was probably the best part of our meal, very friendly, knowledgable and willing to help lend a hand at the end of the meal when we asked for some recommendation for a nightcap elsewhere. In summary, the burger was definitely underwhelming and it could just have been because of all the hype leading up to it. Definitely, not a $100 meal based on what we ordered and drank. I will definitely be going back, but only on a special occasion where I am willing to spend $200+ and go for the full tasting experience.

First, the room was small and stuffy.  The bathroom sink was clogged and the water took forever to drain.  Then the parking situation is ridiculous.  When we came there was some sort of dance competition happening.  That's ok, I get it, these things happen at hotels, but you should at the very least inform all those vendors or staff working the event that are pulling all those trailers to park them around back when they are done unloading, instead of parking their trailers in the front, taking up 4, 5, sometimes even 6 parking spaces.   This then forces all the other people to park their pickups and large SUVs in the compact spaces along the side so that they don't have a long walk to the front.  But the problem is, those spaces are made for compact cars or SUVs, so the large ones take up multiple spaces, forcing some of us to park in a back, unlit parking area with no door access, so that we have to circumnavigate the building to the front.

It mostly depends on which type of crust you prefer. Also, Antico's selection is better, IMHO, as I'm getting a little tired of Varasano's more limited menu.\\n\\nAntico's crust is soft with a little bit of chew and some nice char.  The amount of salt was a bit on the aggressive side.  The tomato sauce was generous as well, and made the pizza pretty juicy, to the point where some was sliding off onto my plate.  I think they could've put more basil, as there were several slices without any basil on them.  I don't require a lot, but more than 3-4 leaves would've been better.

For $18, and in the North End, I was expecting a sauce with a little more depth and richness (the way I make it at home, following Marcella Hazan's recipe, which has you cook the meat in white wine, and then in milk, which gives it a really nice flavor and creaminess). \\n     This tasted like a step up from meat sauce in a jar, but a step down from Marcella's recipe, or from bolognese sauces I've had elsewhere.

I really like their creativity in decoration. The place was clean and organized. One drawback of this place is the number of bathrooms. This place was so crowed, especially the lunch time.

I waited probably 5-8 minutes to get my order, which was not bad at all when considering the number of people waiting for their orders. \\n\\n3) Food 4 stars - their menu (soup & salad) is very interesting. I, however, didn't get those dishes. So, my review on their food is totally based on the bakery and coffee. I love that they have soy milk on the coffee counter that I can put in my coffee for free of charge. This is so unusual as most places would charge extra for having soy milk in your coffee. Two items of bakeries that I ordered were French toast (you may consider it as breakfast :-)) and cinnamon cheese danish. The French toast was phenomenal! It was one of the best French toast I have ever had. It was not made from a regular toast like you may usually get from many breakfast places. The French toast was moist and soft....so delish! For the cinnamon cheese danish, it was not very good. Cheese danish at Starbuck actually tastes much better. It was kind of sour and the crust was somewhat dry rather than being flaky and crispy. \\n\\nWhen writing this review, I am debating with myself in rating this place between 4 and 5 stars. Although I was not impressed with their cheese danish and some issue with the availability of the bathrooms, giving them the credit for their nice and clean place, fast service and friendly staffs, soy milk on the coffee counter for free of charge, and their great French toast, I decided to give them a 5-star rating."},{"name":"Tavern in the Square","address":"640 Atlantic Ave Train Terminal","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Pure desperation play.\\n\\nIncredibly limited menu.

The blend made for an incredibly juicy patty inside (yay!). The only downside of the patty was unfortunately too much excess carry-over \\"fry grease\\" from the griddle (meh.) coating the exterior. \\n\\nBun - The juice & grease combined meant my poor bun never stood a chance, and the bottom bun had nearly dissolved before I was halfway through (& I eat fast).\\n\\nToppings - The toppings consisted of a thick slice of tomato, nice fresh pickle chips, and a forgetful bit of lettuce. Curiously enough, there was a conspicuous lack  (that I could see/taste) of onion - which I would typically expect on a burger with \\"the works\\".\\n\\nCheese - Combined with the exterior grease, I felt like it added an extra \\"fattyness\\" (not in a good way).

It features the richer flavored, sweet, city-style cuisine, as opposed to the lighter and more savory country fare one might find at Thai House.  Ergo, if one likes the city style, they'll like SEA.  If one prefers the country style,  it may prove underwhelming.\\n\\nSEA has a varied menu of Thai standards with occasional interesting specials.  I'm a curry guy, so my review focuses on the various curries at SEA.\\n\\nOverall, the curries are excellent, with good cuts of meat for non-vegetarians.  Spicing tends to be rich and complex, and the kitchen is generally good at adjusting hotness to diner preference.  The tofu versions are also quite tasty.\\n\\nJasmine rice accompanies the curries.  I generally find the amount that initially comes with the curry to be insufficient, but the servers will happily bring additional small plates of rice until I've had my fill.  However, this does bring to mind a current issue at SEA.\\n\\nSEA has become very popular and the service hasn't been able to keep up.  At off-hours the service is polite and attentive.  At prime hours, however, the staff is simply overwhelmed and while the service isn't bad at those times, per se, it can be a challenge to get more rice or drink refills in a timely fashion.\\n\\nAside from the food and service, the decor is pleasant and upscale, more resembling a euro bistro--albeit with Asian touches--than one might expect from a Thai restaurant.  Well-lit during the day, it sometimes it feels a little dark in the evening.\\n\\nOne of my favorite features of SEA is its quirky music.  Jazzy covers of 80s and 90s pop are the order of the day.  The music is both unobtrusive and interesting.  If they marketed their dining soundtrack, I might even pick it up. \\n\\nIts small blemishes aside, I highly recommend SEA Thai.  When friends come into town, SEA is high on my list of places to take them."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"the salt lick is one of those hafta getta places when out of towners come to austin.  the ambiance sets it apart from city life:  you come and hang out (byob) for a couple hours, listen to a live band sometimes, buy some of their lemonade, sit down meet some people, and then put your name down on the list.  or if you're short on time you can just put your name down on the list (usually a 45 minute wait on any weekend night) and wait.   \\n\\nthe food is alright.  it's not great, but it's above average.  the best items are their pork ribs and sauce.  usually in central texas if your sauce is your best item you're doing it wrong.  the salt lick does it alright though.  they're pretty unique in that they use the sauce to continually baste their meat over the pit.  most bbq places in central texas will have offset heat cooking the meat, but not salt lick.  because of this the taste is different than most of the other meat w/i a hundred mile radius.  \\n\\nthe best deal is the all you can eat for $19 (platters of non all you can eat are around $11-$13).  the all you can eate comes out family style with sides of potato salad (warm, german style) and cole slaw (with sesame oil instead of an overabundance of mayo).  the meats they include in the buffet are brisket, pork ribs, and sausage.  they'll even give you a take-home box to fill with stuff when you leave.  usually we pass b/c we'll overeat and get the meat sweats... nasty. \\n\\none last thing:  they're cash only but have an ATM."},{"name":"Garden Bar by Evergreens","address":"1061 NE 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great spot!

We ordered drinks, oysters, and the calamari and were pretty disappointed with the last item. Have had the calamari at ICOB before and this one was over-fried and we only got a tiny amount for the $14. Saw a couple baskets coming out which looked much more full but for the price this was ridiculous. Maybe something happened with ours, I don't know. Some of the oysters we had were good. Overall the service wasn't very good, maybe because we didn't order a ton of food or drinks, but when we tried to order more drinks, the waitress kept passing us over.\\n\\nAnyway, I really like ICOB, but row 34 seemed even more over-priced and was not happy with the apps or quality of some of the oysters.

Here's why:\\n\\nFriends and I came in for the 4 for $40 \\"Chef's Whim\\" special on a Sunday night.  We were a tad bit early, so we mozied on over to the bar area to get cocktails.  We reviewed the drink list.  While we were favorably impressed by the originality of the mixes, we were unfamiliar with most of the drinks, so we asked our server for some help.  \\"They are all well-balanced and delicious,\\" she said.  Ummm, okay, but maybe some specifics?  \\"I don't know.  I'm Mormon so I don't drink.\\"  I'm not recommending religious discrimination, but putting a Mormon in charge of taking cocktail orders seems like a bad idea.  I ended up getting an Old Fashioned, so I could at least tell if the bartender could make a good drink in addition to putting on a good show.  (Imagine a hipster in a buttoned vest shaking up cocktails epileptic seizure style.)  Result: the drink was a little flat, overly sweet with few bright notes.\\n\\nOn to the meal.  We were seated in the bar area since the main room was over capacity.  Our new server confirmed that we were there for the Sunday special and asked if we wanted wine.  \\"Sure, what would you recommend?\\" we asked, not knowing what the Chef's whim might be.  \\"What kind of wine do you like?\\"  \\"Well, do you think a red or a white will go better with the menu?\\"  \\"Oh, I have no idea what Tony'll serve, do you like reds or whites better?\\"  \\"I suppose reds, generally speaking.\\"  \\"What kind of reds?\\"  \\"I'd probably go with a pinot noir for versatility,\\" I say, feeling like I'm doing the waiter's job.  \\"Oh, we have a great pinot,\\" he replies, pointing out the most expensive pinot on the menu.\\n\\nWhile we are finishing our cocktails, a smoked bluefish amuse bouche comes out.  But it isn't announced as an amuse, so we are trying to figure out if this half-teaspoon of food is the first course or the amuse.  It's pretty tasty and pairs well with the wine.  What luck!\\n\\nThe next course is three slivers of hamachi with compressed watermelon, cukes and a slightly spicy fatty sauce smeared across the plate.  The watermelon is interesting, but the hamachi is only average.  (Maybe Los Angeles has me spoiled with its quality sushi?)  Also, altogether, there's about an ounce of fish on the plate.  Our server still hasn't clarified if we are on our first or second course, so we're a little worried.  \\"Maybe we'll stop at McDonald's on the way home,\\" my pal jokes.  Also, the pinot doesn't match up with this course at all.\\n\\nTwo runners approach with plates of fried clams.  They are light and crispy on the outside and perfectly tender and savory on the inside.  The sauce offers a little tart and spicy contrast.  I'm finally starting to see what the fuss about Craigie is about.  My friend, however, seems more concerned about going home hungry.  Since the Chef's Whim menu promises a dessert as the fourth course, he's worried that this was the last savory course.  And our waiter has been missing for the past 20 minutes.  When he finally passes a nearby table, we hail him, asking if the smoked bluefish was an amuse bouche or one of the courses.  He looks completely confused.  \\"Is it possible to switch to the six-course $55 menu?\\" my hungry companion requests.  \\"Yes, but you'll only get one more course then.\\"  \\"What?\\"  (My math skills are somewhat rudimentary, but 4+1=6???)  \\"Is there another course coming?\\"  \\"Yes, you'll have one more course.\\"  \\"Well, if only dessert is coming next, then we'd like to upgrade to the six-course, even if it's only five, I guess.\\"  \\"Oh no, steak will be served next, then dessert.\\"  \\n\\nWe cancel the upgrade.  The confusion, unfortunately, has distracted us from how good those clams were.\\n\\nOnce more the runners appear, quickly shuffling out with pan-finished steak, running away from the screamed orders emanating from the kitchen.  (I'm pretty happy that we didn't get those prized ringside seats.)  The meat is rich, buttery, and well-seasoned.  No gustatory surprise here, but the execution is spot on.\\n\\nFinally, my friend's fears of going home hungry are allayed.\\n\\nBefore dessert, the server half-heartedly attempts to up-sell us a pricey flight of whiskeys.  I'm not that impressed with the booze on offer, so we stick to plain dessert.  Three different ones come to the table: a berry tart with basil ice cream, crepes with a sweet creamy filling, and an orange cake with whipped cream.  The basil ice cream tastes like pesto and doesn't match the tart at all.  The orange cake is solid.  The crepes are predictable, but fine.\\n\\nOverall, the food was quite good, though nothing was so memorable that I imagine talking about it later.  Moreover, again and again, our experience was marred by poor service.  For all the buzz about Craigie, I wanted better."},{"name":"Ocean Wave By Harry And Sons","address":"820 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great sushi and alcohol selection and not always crowded.

I think the seared tuna did not have as much impact for me.  I thought the opening dishes were generally under-seasoned for my taste, but maybe it's just me.  The mussles in white wine was quite good.  Although I couldn't quite escape the feeling that it was just New Zealand green mussels poached in whine, butter, and some vegetable stock.  The french fries were very good.  I think they were probably a modified version of Blumenthal's thrice-cooked chips.  It was my girlfriend's first experience of this type of fries, and she was quite blown away.  \\n\\nDessert was alright.

Could not wait!   Had been a little 'put-off' by the photos of the pizzas, as, being a true pizza queen with roots in Chicago and New York, taste, and quality ingredients (not mystery meat or pre-fab cheese) is quickly followed by presentation.  All of the photos posted by my fellow yelpers showed pizzas with the ingredients tossed haphazardly around the pie.  Who wants to bite into a section that may only have cheese, but no meat, for example?  Most of us want to savor the taste in almost every bite of the ingredients we ordered.  So, I ultimately found this to be a sad experience.  Come on Antico, opportunity awaits!\\n\\nSome of the best pizza I have had has been at 'Bambinelli's' located behind Northlake Mall in Tucker.  Bonnie Bambinelli has presided over this little family owned Italian gem for years.  When there, also try their eggplant parm or the spaghetti and meatballs or spaghetti marinara.  I always ask for a little extra marina to sauce up my take-outs. \\n\\nSecond up would be 'Gondolier's.'  I loved the location on Barrett Parkway in the Dick's/J.C. Penney shopping plaza, but it recently closed - I'm assuming due to the economy.  They have one other location still open in Woodstock.  The crust is so-o-o good you actually want to eat every bit.  Normally I never eat the edges, unless they are perfect and needless to say, these are divine.  \\n\\nMy other top choice is in Fayetteville.  'Pies On.'  They only offer a pan crust, but trust me, the toppings and the crust again, are superb.  Try the Grandpa Joe's with sweep rope Italian sausage (real meat not pre-fab!) roasted red peppers, black olives, crushed red peppers and cheddar.  I sometimes add onions all over and pepperoni on one half.  You can never get home before opening the box, but each hot slice demands two-handed attention.  So if you have a nice car, just wait until you get home!  They have a full menu of Italian and Greek dishes.  The Greek salad is flawless.  They will customize, as well.

The reviews were pretty good online, and the photos looked appetizing. But unfortunately, that's not the case. The amount of toppings for the hot dogs was pretty generous. Lots of noodles or onions or whatever. I ordered my footlong for $7 and I got like 5 noodles. I'm not kidding. That's about 3 cents worth of noodle. And maybe 5-6 slices of onion. Totally a ripoff! Then we ordered a box of tater tots. They were hot, but they were pretty poorly flavored. They just dumped the flavor in the middle so about 6 tots had way too much flavor, and the rest were bland. And for $9, I would expect a hell of a lot more tots.

The pappardella funghi selvatici was really rich and flavorful with the truffle flavor complimenting the cream sauce perfectly. It's tough to pull off a mushroom-heavy dish without any of the mushrooms being overpowering, but they pulled it off. The braised short rib was really tasty and melt-in-your-mouth perfectly cooked. And the salmon was beautifully flaky and delicious. It came with roasted potatoes, which was odd since the dish promised mashed potatoes. However, the pesto it was served with was extremely flavorful and loaded with roasted pine nuts, a personal favorite of mine.
