Not even close. Usually, a Persian restaurant is run by some folks from the Old Country, has waitstaff that is equally comfortable in Persian and English and serves food to the satisfaction of expats who grew up with amazing Persian food, and had mothers and grandmothers who knew how to run a kitchen. So... I walk in to Classical Arabic music, a Moroccan waitstaff, Arabic being shouted in the kitchen.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong -- I loves me some Moroccan cuisine, and when I mean to go Moroccan, I speak Arabic and order accordingly. The two flavor profiles are NOT the same.

My server, bless her heart, was stumped. I had to point to the menu.\\n\\nDid I mention the decor looks like a 1950s \\"Arabian Nights\\" movie set held a yard sale? So much for not hokey.

Just the right consistency. Not too sticky, not too dry, just buttery enough, enough saffron to make it fragrant, seasoned right... and the bottom crust (tah-dƒ´g) is both a place for variation (just rice? bread? potatoes?) and delicacy the often gets served on the side. There was none of that at Shiraz. It might as well have been Minute Rice. \\n\\nBottom line: run away! Orlando has enough Arab restaurants for the competition to generate some decent offerings.

Tasty, to be sure, but small, and only 5 of them. This is an entr√©e. ML had the beet salad, and the roasted King crab. Both are appetizers so she wasn't expecting huge portions, but what she got was absolutely tiny. The beet salad consisted of what appeared to be a third of a beet sliced into roughly 5 sections, with a dollop of mozzarella the size of a marble between each segment. And the King crab appetizer was literally a 4\\" piece of thin crab leg sliced in half lengthwise. How this passed as an appetizer I don't understand. It was so small that it barely passed as food. One other diner at our table got it and hers was the same size so it wasn't an anomaly. ML said it was tasty enough, but she loves King crab so she was predisposed to like it. Two other diners at our table got the lamb and it was a large portion, complete with bean side. \\n\\nI accept that good food is not the same as lots of food, and make no mistake, the dishes were all good, though I wouldn't order the ravioli again even if it were larger portioned.

No, it's not cheap.  But it's really not that expensive, either.  My wife and I had dinner here for $22 tonight: Pretty reasonable for dinner for two, eh?  As a good comparison, it costs us roughly that much (if not more) to eat at Lavash Cafe. The two are pretty comparable in terms of service and atmosphere and, frankly, the food at Northstar is better.  And yet, I never hear anyone complain that Lavash is overpriced. \\n\\nPrice aside, though, the food here is always outstanding.  The Northstar Burger ranks among my favorite burgers anywhere: veggie or meat.  The burritos are always exceptional.  The Niman Ranch burger is bit dry for my taste, but still a completely respectable burger.  The pancakes are to-die-for.  And the breakfast burrito might be my single favorite breakfasts of all time.  \\n\\nDid I mention the ginger ale?  Yes it's $3.50.  I know it's a lot for a soda.  But if you think about it, the mark-up really isn't that much higher than on a cocktail at a nice restaurant and this soda is handmade so it requires just as much work.  Plus it's worth every penny.  Seriously, try the ginger ale.  It's the most refreshing beverage I've ever had. \\n\\nSo, no, don't go to Northstar if you're looking for cheap, greasy food.  There's nothing wrong with cheap, greasy food sometime,s but you won't get it at Northstar.  Do go to Northstar if you're willing to pay a little bit more for high-quality, wholesome, delicious food.

The pulled pork was really good--really tender and juicy...but unfortunately I found the BBQ chopped chicken to be super dry and the pork belly to be just average. I liked our sides as the collard greens had a unique, alkaline flavor and the coleslaw was crisp and fresh. BUT the real star of the show (and the reason why I will probably be back) are the biscuits. My god, they are so good--especially when paired with their honey butter!!

Taqueria Cancun serves up a delightful medley of Mexican and El Salvadorian cuisine. With mom and pop places, one is almost guaranteed amazing food. The taqueria itself was small yet wonderfully inviting, and I could tell the staff worked diligently to keep it clean for its patrons. I ordered the El Salvadorian style breakfast complete with eggs, chicharr√≥n, beans, queso blanco, and tortillas. Guess how much the total was for this hearty meal. It was a jaw-dropping $9.02! I must say I can eat quite a bit, but I definitely had a few leftovers on my plate.

For a medium rare Kobe beef burger, it really seemed to take twice as long as it should have. We were done with our scallops and crab rolls several minutes before the burger came out. However, once it did, it tasted mighty fine. Comes with chevre. Yum. The crab rolls were pretty typical, but the scallops. Oh, the scallops.

The sushi is great, whether you're ordering something more authentic or giving the tempura-fried california roll a go. Their spicy salmon rolls are a refreshing change from the overly-sweetened fish mush served other places: they incorporate a sprinkling of crunchy tempura bits which combine with the toasted sesame on top to transform each roll into the perfect mouthful.\\n\\nThe quality of the fish has always been high, as has the construction of the sushi: I've never been served partially-frozen sashimi (looking at you, Kisha Poppo), nor have I been given one of those rolls where the end pieces are just a sad disintegrating mess.\\n\\nBest of all, the price is absolutely right. Two hungry guys can leave stuffed for around $30.

This isn't really somewhere you'd want to take a first date: the booth seating is extremely small and only loosely attached to the wall, resulting in wobbling and wiggling and a variety of flatulent noises. Our server initially attempted to seat us in a special table constructed because they didn't have space for a real one; you would have to be a pair of six-year-olds to sit there in any comfort.

Once you're ready to go, don't bother waiting around--just go up to the cash register and pay, unless you want to be stuck in those uncomfortable seats for three hours.\\n\\nStill, the atmosphere adds a touch of authenticity. I'm not sure I'd trust sushi served to me by a giggling, high-heeled blonde who stops by every ten minutes on the dot to ask how everything is tasting.

Why you might ask?\\n\\nFirst off, the prices aren't as outrageous as places in the area, and the food and service is great. The restaurant itself has a great personality to it, with wasabi green  walls and plenty of private booths with windows and without. It also has the traditional style Japanese booths.\\n\\nParking in the back, so you don't have to worry about finding spots (we found this out the hard way), and the cups are really nice (according to my wife that is).\\n\\nWe ordered a lunch box special the first time and were presently surprised - I've never had three large, fresh prawn shrimp tempura with sushi AND sashimi AND agedashi tofu for under $10!!!  the quality of the sashmi was far superior than most restaurants i go to as well - especially the wild, really red, salmon. wow. \\n\\nThere was also complimentary hot tea and edamane (peas?) - which is always a nice treat.\\n\\nSecond time go the chicken teriyaki box and only complaint was too salty teriyaki sauce, but everything else was great (got the complimentary edemane again)\\n\\nLastly, this place was definitely affected by the construction - but even after it, it's a hard to find place. i think these two factors contribute to the fact that during lunch hour (noon) it was less than a quarter full!

We lucked out and found free parking just around the corner. The restaurant itself is pretty small. I think maybe 10 small tables? Anyway, the restaurant was no where as busy as the other location on Broadway and with 3 waitresses working on the floor I thought for sure there'd be no problems. Our orders were taken promptly and they were patient with us while we were finalizing our decisions. However, everything kind of went downhill after. Two noodle dishes and one of the beef rolls were ordered (shared between 3 ppl). The first noodle dish that arrived was the Szechuan Stir Fry Noodles. It looked good initially but I personally found it a bit on the salty side. I still ate it because it was still manageable. Then came the Xin Jiang Noodles (with blade sheared noodles). The flavor of this dish was a lot better but the noodles felt a bit tough and clumped together. We were halfway through eating our noodles when we remembered we had ordered the beef rolls! We thought maybe they had forgotten but my coworker saw it sitting in the counter at the back so we thought it would be brought out soon. Boy were we wrong. We were pretty much done eating our noodles when the beef rolls finally came. And they were huge! Usually this would be a good thing but it made it so hard to eat as every bite created a big sloppy mess. It tasted good though.\\n\\nSo as we're finishing up we noticed this puddle of oil in the middle of the empty Szechuan Noodle dish. I knew it tasted greasy but I didn't think there'd be that much oil leftover!\\n\\nAnyway, so we wait around sitting at our tables trying to flag down one of the waitresses which we soon realized was an impossible task. We look around and two other tables were trying to flag someone down too. But where were the waitresses? Huddled and talking to each other ignoring all the \\"excuse me\\" and \\"hello\\" that's being directed at them. And when they finally stopped talking to each other they would walk over to the tables slowly. I can understand bad/slow service if the restaurant was busy and they were busy with other customers. But unfortunately this was not the case.\\n\\nI've been to their Broadway location a few times and I've always had good experiences there. At this location, I felt like I was eating at a random greasy Chinese restaurant in Richmond. Never again.\\n\\nPS. No credit cards.

I remember having the option to get a small  (12oz) or large (16oz).  And, for me, $4.21 for a small latte that takes me less than a minute to drink down is too pricey now. What happened to offering options? Only offering small for what the large used to almost cost seems...I don't even know...sneaky? I was bummed. Hence the 4 star rating instead of 5.

It was one of the best and most authentic Indian dish I've had in Columbus....oh and spicy as all get out. I was sweating, sniffling and panting and I don't think I could have been happier. Our table also opted for an assortment Naan bread to pair with the curries (butter, garlic & cheesy jalapeno all ~$4) and the clear winner was the cheesy jalapeno...rich, spicy and crispy.

Ironically he was talking so broken English so I couldn't quite get him but only guess from his face.

I was also excited to spot the Setas ronan - Portabellas with shaved manchego, capers, red onion in a sherry vinaigrette with roasted red pepper toasts 6.95 on their normal tapas menu - I had it before (named slightly differently) on my first Appetite Stimulus menu experience a year ago and had really enjoyed it, so I was happy for the chance to share it with my friend.  So to fill out the meal we ordered a couple more tapas (Tarta gratinada de puerros - Leek quiche baked with smoked cheddar and manchego cheese 5.50 and Fideos con mariscos - Shrimp, calamari, mussels and salmon tossed with linguine in a white wine sauce 6.95) and a second bowl of the soup ($4.95).\\n\\nThe bread landed on the table quite early - tasty soft bread with a great green spread.  The soup was waiting for me upon my return from washing my hands (bathroom tip - the lock will slide in easily if you lift the door up as you attempt to lock it).  Creamy not too sweet soup with crab and bits of veggies dolloped in the middle - I enjoyed it.  The tapas hit the table one at a time next.  The mushroom plate was a good portion with three slices of bread, but I wonder if they were a bit too light handed with the sherry vinaigrette since the dish wasn't as good as the first time.  The leek quiche with its crisp crust was tasty, but nothing special... my first thought upon tasting it was just... quiche.  The seafood pasta might have sat in the kitchen for a bit before it was brought out to us.  The surface looked a bit dry, but it was hot and creamy underneath, the pasta al dente, the seafood not overcooked and enough to share between the two of us.  However, it wasn't special either, and I didn't see any of the salmon mentioned on the menu.\\n\\nThe entree took quite a while to get to us, then we had trouble locating the waitress in order to request an additional plate.  Actually she was often tough to find as she was off doing things for her other tables.  The steak plate was a great portion, but the meat a bit on the tough side, and the potatoes (or was it the gravy?) too salty.\\n\\nThe banana bread pudding arrived surprisingly in a bowl and quite drenched with a lovely sweet sauce.  I really enjoyed it.  I'm sure my friend would have enjoyed it even more with his coffee, but our waitress never thought to ask us if we'd like any.

My sister used to live in Idaho where they had a Great Harvest and I fell in love with it as soon as I savored my first slice of bread there. I was missing it when I was in LA (the nearest one was so far away...). There's one thing that I found in Boulder that I couldn't have in LA and it's the Great Harvest Bread Co.!!\\n\\nI've never had their sandwiches but I've had their apple crisp bread (very yummy), peanut butter oatmeal chocolate chip cookie (very nice), and their pumpkin chocolate chip muffin (if they went lighter on the cinnamon it would've tasted better). I also bought their biscottis which was the only thing I was truly disappointed with. These are not real biscottis, they're very eggy. I like it when biscottis taste butterier and not eggier like this one. I've been eating them while I tell myself that they're not biscottis and it seems to be working. I can enjoy them for what they are. Just don't expect genuine biscottis here. It's very hard to find fresh, good biscottis anywhere you go, which is why I jumped at these pack of them. I think I'm just going to have to continue baking my own biscottis until I find a good place for good ones.\\n\\nOver all though, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!\\nBut..., I also (like Sam H.) did not get offered a free slice of bread!

Although their menu is fairly large, I don't find myself loving majority of their items.  So why does it still get a 4-star from me?  Because the dishes that I do get, I dooo love.  For their lunch and dinner, I always order their jumbo scallop.  Their risotto is amazing and scallops are fresh.  The lunch and dinner scallop entree are cooked differently, so that's a plus.  It's not like I'm paying for the same item day and night.  My friends like their burgers, but I've never tried.  So if you're into that, give it a try!  Another thing other places can't beat is their Bloody Mary.  My first Bloody Mary was here because their mini clipboard with all the liquor and add-on garnishes looked so enticing.  I never thought I'd like tomato alcoholic drinks...but I love it at Stephanie's!  It is a bit pricey after the add on.. I always get it with the bacon and jumbo shrimp.  It looked so good, my two guy friends jumped on board.  I am pretty sure it was the bacon that convinced them.  I finally had the chance to try their brunch today, and I love the crab cake Benedict.. It is a good twist to my favorite egg Benedict.  The salad and home fries were well seasoned.  The crab cake is amazing!  And I was so happy they have cholula hot sauce!!  I definitely prefer crab cake to the same old English muffin.  I honestly don't know how I will go back to an English muffin now.\\n\\nThe location alone gives it a 3 at least.  The little time we have in the Fall, Spring, and Summer is so beautiful on Newbury street.  It's a central location where you can meet friends, shop, and do some people watching.

He has nothing to do with the restaurant itself. But we actually stopped here with a group of friends after seeing one of his shows at the Wilbur. When you walk in, the place looks pretty small. But they actually have an upstairs dining area so that's pretty cool. There was a 25 min wait even on a Saturday around 930pm lol. The place honestly wasn't TOO packed though. We didn't mind waiting, we were with good company and decided to chill by the bar while we waited for a table. A little while after we were brought up stairs and put in our order. \\n\\nWe had garlic noodles, Cajun fries, snow crab legs, and the shrimp and crawfish combo. The garlic noodles were Sooo good. But so heavy, please don't eat this all by yourself and share lol. I love garlic and noodles. So this was like a perfect garlic buttery bomb. It was good to cut the strong bold, spicy flavors on the seafood. The Cajun fries were also sooo good lol. Especially when they came out hot and fresh. I love eating fries when they're so hot they burn your tongue a little. The Cajun seasoning wasn't too overpowering. Now onto the main event, the seafood, \\n\\nI forgot what the house sauce is called. But it's basically the best combination of every sauce they offer so you should just get that to get the full experience. Their lowest level of spice here is medium. Their medium was actually pretty spicy. To me it's a good spice cause I love spicy food. But for my husband It got a little overwhelming. The sauce itself was pretty good. I've had others that were better. But It was still worth eating. The seafood seemed really small though, which was a bit disappointing. It was so much work peeling just to get a tiny piece of crawfish. The crab legs also weren't that meaty. I feel like this place is good, but the seafood should be the star. It should be the one shining and unfortunately this time It didn't. \\n\\nThe staff and service was great though. We had lots of laughs with them and I'm sure It was because half our party was drinking lol. They were pretty cool and nice to talk to. We even had our picture taken and put on their board!

I crossed them off my list and didn't return.\\n\\nYesterday I received a note from the owner asking me to remove my review that said, \\"for the past two years, we've been under a completely different management and we've cleaned up our act! We put absolute emphasis on clean hygiene and we've passed all our inspection reports with no problems...would you please kindly remove your review?\\"\\n\\nSo based upon my personal experience of interacting with the owner via yelp message, I decided I would consider revisiting and see how it has changed today. As I like my stomach, and keeping it healthy, I decided to verify the owner's claim that they've cleaned up their act entirely and check out the latest health reports.\\n\\nI am glad I checked before heading in the door. According to the health inspection reports looks like there is still a bit of an issue: 5 critical infractions and 2 non-critical infractions on their latest inspection (February 2016). Some of the issues include:\\n\\n- Food stored in a manner that promotes cross contamination\\n- Potentially hazardous food is not stored, displayed or transported at a temperature of 4C or below\\n- The premises is not maintained in a sanitary condition\\n- Equipment, utensils and/or food contact surfaces are not maintained in a sanitary condition\\n- Sanitation plan not developed\\n- Procedures in sanitation plan not followed\\n- Sanitizer levels are not being monitored and recorded\\n- The premises is free of pests: Not in compliance\\n\\nSo if this is the new owner's idea of cleaning up their act with absolutely emphasis on clean hygiene I suppose those pests are clean by regularly taking baths in the melted ice that should be keeping the food cold?\\n\\nSuffice to say that my recent experience interacting with the owner who claims to have cleaned up their act, but clearly is still having issues with health inspectors, makes me question their definition of hygiene and I won't be putting their food into my body again. \\n\\nSo I wrote back to the owner and let them know of my concern, and how I wouldn't feel safe putting his food in my body.  \\n\\nThe owner told me to look at the 2015 health review which was cleaner, and to skip the 2016 review that is more recent. Yes, the 2015 review was cleaner, but the 2016 review seems more appropriate to consider at this point, no?\\n\\nIn any case, my personal experience of being contacted by the owner, asking me to remove the review based upon my personal experience, me going through the personal experience of communicating directly with the owner and being nagged by him to remove my review, going through the personal experience of reading the latest health report, going through the personal experience of making screenshots of that latest health report, and my personal experience of being further nagged by the owner in private messages has led me to draw the conclusion that I still think this place is off my list.\\n\\nPerhaps spending time sanitizing the restaurant instead of trying to sanitize the yelp reviews would be time better spent?"},{"name":"City Landing","address":"255 State St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Went there last night for dinner with my boyfriend.

I wouldn't think of going to Einstein but I had heard good things about Bagel Palace so I was excited to try it.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't serve a pickle and chips with their bagels, platter style. The whole wheat (scooped and toasted) bagel itself was pretty decent, the lite lox cream cheese wasn't the best, but the pumpkin cream cheese was really good.  The problem was that they didn't put much of either spread ON my bagel so I had to go ask for more.  In m opinion, you should have to ask for LESS cream cheese if you want it that way, never more. If my bagel is toasted, I want to eat it while it's hot, so to have to bring it back inside (without a plate) was annoying. My boyfriend's bacon, egg, and cheese was \\"salty,\\" and our friend had no complaints about his bagel.  \\n\\nI don't usually eat bagels, so the next time I want one (in about 6 months or a year) I'll try Goldberg's.

There's the cheese/tomato sauce dish (paneer masala maybe?), mango chicken, tandoori chicken, and some sort of spicy lamb dish that is just delicious.  I don't recall any of the sides except for rice, but there are a few to choose from.  It would be nice to see some more options on the buffet, but the corner it's jammed into is already crowded, so I'm not sure how they'd do that.

The skirt steak is terrible, $33 is enough to buy a small portion of prime ribeye, yet they feel it is the perfect price for the cheapest and toughest cut of meat with nothing more than French fries as a side.

My friend went to inquire about the food status and was assured it would be out soon. The soup finally came out with the context that it had taken awhile to heat - except it was ice cold. So yeah. Awkward. \\n\\nThe bagel never came out. We were so fed up with the service at this point that we just left. Any establish that can't give me half a smile and pull off putting a bagel in the toaster is not worth spending a penny on. There are so many great local businesses the Short North is blessed with, and I'm done wasting my time at a place that doesn't appreciate their customers.

We took advantage of an $11 special that includes 1lb of carnitas, 3 dozen fresh tortillas, and a tub of salsa.

There were two glasses water on table, and a pitcher of water thankfully, because noone ever asked us if we wanted something different. Friend arrived, still no drinks offered, noone instructed us. At buffet, foods were labeled, but I don't speak the language, and the only word I recognized was Tandoori.   English translations would be helpful since noone was around to translate.  Some of the items did not have utensils with which to serve ourselves. We requested knives to use at our table (only fork and spoon were including w/ napkin), from the same nice lady I had spoken to before, and it took her 5 minutes to find some. She had to go downstairs to another restaurant area to find some.  Food was OK, perhaps a bit too spicy.  If I could've read labels, maybe I would've avoided the too spicy choices. When our water dried up, and it did, we had to track someone down to bring us more, and we waited some more for that.  There were employees moving around a lot, they were friendly and said 'hello' upon entering, 4 said hello as I found my way upstairs, but when we needed service, they seemed to be no where around.  The decor of the place is gorgeous, and seemed spotless... so there is that.  I am happy to have this restaurant there, there was a nice-sized crowd at lunch.

They're both so tasty and flavorful in their own ways. For the first round, I recommend ordering a generous amount, but DO NOT overestimate yourself - you don't wanna be stuck with like 5 orders of veggies and 50 pieces of meat and then be full after one round! After the first round, you can then kind of narrow it out and pick and choose what you want more of and things you'd be willing to try if you haven't.

I'm not a huge fan of the pasta salad since it's fat free (!), but I suppose if you're watching your weight it might be a good thing.

Great service. But the restaurant needs rehab.\\n\\nMy parents both grew up eating at Old Hickory House, but had not been in years. My mom isn't a big barbecue person, but she loves brunswick stew. She always claimed Old Hickory House had the best ever. We recently were meeting for lunch near Tucker and I suggested we give Old Hickory House a visit.\\n\\nOld Hickory House was, at one time, a chain of restaurants across the region. Over the years most locations have closed, a few have split off to be independent, and several imitators of the concept are floating around as well. So there's a good chance you might have been to a similar restaurant. Barbecue and breakfast are the hightlights, but other southern specialties are abundant on the menu.\\n\\nEveryone in our party ordered one of the specials. Each one was a barbecue sandwich, with two defined sides. I got the pork, which came with slaw and stew. The pork was good. It's what I call \\"Sunday\\" barbecue the kind of generic barbecue you find at church functions, redneck weddings, and construction seminars. Chopped, slow cooked, pork meat, not too smoky, tossed with plenty of sauce. Everybody likes it, nobody loves it. The slaw was exactly how I like it, coarsely chopped and dressed with a simple creamy dressing. (Mom was right) The stew was the best component. It had a pleasant fresh sweetness from the corn, a bit of tangy tomato flavor and a hint of background smokiness. You could taste each ingredient, but the sum was greater than the parts. The flavors melded very well, but they didn't break down into a one-note dish. Among the three best I've ever had.\\n\\nService was \\"Southern\\". Friendly and polite, but not exceedingly fast. Prices seemed fair.\\n\\nI'd have given Old Hickory House four stars, but they lost points on the atmosphere. The place probably hasn't changed in 30 years. Which is cool, and I applaud them for keeping the tradition. But it's time for some renovation. The chairs and booths are in need of replacement, the ceiling tiles need to go, and everything needs a thorough cleaning and a coat of paint. Look at Anthony P's photo of the inside, that could have been taken in 1979 or yesterday,  you'd have no way of knowing."},{"name":"Olive & June","address":"3411 Glenview Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I held our wedding reception here after eloping prior to his deployment. While he was deployed, I planned most of the event by myself and Brooke made the whole process a stress free breeze. \\n\\nFrom the initial email, she was polite, accommodating and willing to work with our budget. She showed me the space, went over the menu and helped coordinate details. I took my mother to dinner there on her visit into town and Brooke and the manager were polite enough to send us samples of dishes we were considering for our event so I could make deliciously informed decisions. I think picking the menu was the hardest part because it was all so good. \\n\\nIn addition, the lighting around the space is amazing. When you first arrive the restaurant, is has a great secret garden feel. Then as the sun sets, the lights strung around the restaurant and in the tree light up and create an amazing romantic feel. \\n\\nThe day of the event the Olive & June staff was amazing. Graham and his team were fantastic all around. They made sure everything went smoothly regarding food, bar and tables. During passed appetizers, the servers made a point to stop and offer appetizers to my husband and I, which was nice since we were busy talking to people. We had more people RSVP than expected so they even helped make sure the indoor space transitioned smoothly into a dance floor by discreetly moving tables out of the way. \\n\\nDuring the party, everyone raved about the food and how amazing it was. At so many weddings, you get the standard chicken and veggies that are blah. At Olive & June, we were able to have an outstanding meal that more than satisfied everyone between the passed appetizers, caprese salad, pasta, roasted green beans and chocolate mousse.\\n\\nI highly recommend having an event at Olive & June or at the very least going their for dinner!

Booze is prominently featured behind the bar, and I didn't look closely at the beer offerings (what was I thinking?!) but I only saw 2 taps.\\n\\nI chose the (admittedly simple) cajun chicken strips.  Co-worker had a bacon cheeseburger.  Both are served with HFG's excellent french fries.  They're a cross between steak fries and simple shoestrings.

Now 7:30 on a Saturday night is not a late dinner by any means and they were already sold out of the prime rib.  I ordered a ribeye instead which was just average.

Generous serving of sizable prawns and ham. \\n\\nMy buddies had salted fish with chicken fried rice and dried olives green beans with diced pork. Both had a rich flavour but may need an acquired taste. But the fragrance meant they used genuine goods and the \\"wok hay\\" a.k.a. heat from the wok is very good. \\n\\nI personally enjoyed all these three rice items.

Tiffani Faison + great BBQ = a place I had to try. And I'm happy to say I have not been disappointed. \\n\\nFirst, a word about the service- it's excellent. Every waiter and host we encountered this evening was nothing but cheerful, knowledgeable, and helpful. When we arrived at 6:15 to an already packed house, the hostess let us know it would be about 35-40 minutes (ended up being exactly 35 minutes) but we were welcome to grab a drink at the bar, which we did... there are bar stools and counters along the side of the room specifically for those waiting at the bar to spread out (i.e. not for eating), and while the boy was up at the actual bar doing the ordering, 2 separate friendly waitstaff came up to me and asked if they could get me a drink while I was waiting for our table. And once we sat, our waitress was kind, attentive, knowledgeable, and had a great disposition. The service alone is good reason to come here, especially with an atmosphere that's so casual and fun... you'd expect excellent service for fine dining, but not in a place that has paper napkins on the table and drinks served in mason jars, so kudos to all the staff here. Also, how cool was it to actually see Tiffani in the kitchen on a Friday night?! (A little starstruck over here.) Props to a chef who actually cooks in her own kitchen.\\n\\nAtmosphere: homey, casual, welcoming... a bit loud so probably not good for a first date or catch-up meeting, but the music is good. Wasn't much a fan of the communal seating- I was stuck next to a bunch of small children who fortunately weren't too annoying or disruptive-, but they do have individual tables too if you can get 'em. (Side note: what is with people bringing their kids to non-kid friendly places nowadays?! Blah.)\\n\\nDrinks: cocktails were somewhat reasonable ($10), served in mason jars (as is everything else), well-crafted, and American oriented (this means mostly dark alcohol, whiskeys and rums). The American beer list is pretty extensive, although at times overpriced ($5 for a PBR and 'Gansett? $20 for a Pretty Things bottle), though I did appreciate the American theme and the wide variety, including rotating taps.\\n\\nMenu: when I first saw the menu a few weeks back, aside from drooling at the delicious-sounding food, I had a bit of sticker shock... really, $18 for a 'tray' of BBQ that I can get at Redbones for like $13? No thanks. But the boy and I played it smart and split a $26 Big Cheeks tray (choice of 3 meats plus a cold scoop and a hot scoop) plus a bucket of biscuits ($10 for 4) and a side of salt & pepper potatoes ($7). This was far more than enough food for the both of us... he's painfully full right now, and I couldn't even finish my half and thus have a filling lunch tomorrow from all the leftovers. $43 for 2.5 really good meals = reasonably priced, and money well spent... you just need to be smart about what you order, I think. \\n\\nFood: yummmmmm. First of all, love the fact all the meat is organicish, non-hormone injected, good quality stuff. For our Big Cheeks tray, we got the pork belly, the pork ribs, and the pulled pork, all of which were so tender and flavorful on their own thanks to their dry rub and smoking, and didn't need any of the extra sauce they put at every table IMO (choice of ghost chile, vinegar, or BBQ... I don't do spicy, the BBQ was far too tomatoey/ketchupy, and the vinegar was pretty much just that... disappointing). Our cold scoop was farm salad, which was so not a throwaway but a really tasty salad with arugula, brussel sprouts, grapes, peanuts, a dusting of cheese, and light dressing (lemon vinaigrette?)... we downed this whole thing, highly recommended and a great way to balance out the rest of the heavy food. Our hot scoop was the blackeyed peas, which could have used a touch more salt IMO but was hearty and rich with porky goodness. We didn't touch the white bread or onions (filler IMO), but the housemade pickles were tasty. The salt and pepper potatoes on the side were crispy and delicious, and the warm biscuits were amazing, ginormous and fluffy and out of this world when you spread the honey butter all over... I dare say this was my favorite part of the meal, a bold statement with all the great food we had (that honey butter just killed it, it was sooooo good). I could barely even finish one, so I recommend to get these when you're with multiple people (although we now have 2 biscuits for lunch tomorrow along with the leftover honey butter, not a bad thing). \\n\\nRedbones does have much better sauces and prices and beer, but Sweet Cheeks kills it otherwise... the meat is so juicy and tasty, the sides are awesome, the price isn't unreasonable if you play it smart, and it's on my side of the river to boot. I'm not giving up Redbones, but I'm definitely adding Sweet Cheeks to my rotation."},{"name":"The Pongal Restaurant","address":"786 Boston Rd","city":"Billerica","stars":"3","text":"I really loved this food. i had the lunch buffet that they served the day after christmas and was blown away by the dishes that i had.

We waited until a server appeared and sat us with menus. She was very sweet and she is probably the only pleasant part of my visit. \\n\\nThe food:\\n\\nI order calamari and chicken tenders. I guess I was wrong for expecting real food. Instead, we were served a plate of frozen, processed apps. The calamari rings were uniform in size and looked like mini onion rings. They were not fresh and they were not good. The tenders were pizza shop quality not dine in restaurant quality. \\n\\nFor entrees we order lobster ravioli and the veal marsala. My friend did enjoy the lobster ravioli but I absoultely was repulsed by the veal marsala. It tastes like bottled/canned premade sauce, and it was gravy-like. No not Italian 'gravy' but more like southern chicken gravy. There was also no taste. The pasta tasted preboiled/overcooked and bland. The veal also looked questionable and tasted off. \\n\\nI couln't eat it and I asked to send it back because it just didnt taste good. I ordered a shrimp scampi instead. The waiter places the order and then comes out of kitchen explaining that the manager said i would have to pay for the shrimp scampi. So I informed her I would not. I took ONE bite of pasta and one sliver of the veal and thats it. I didnt eat it and try to get over on them. This was a poorly made dish. \\n\\nThe waiter said how the manager said the restaurant cant afford to give me a another plate but that I only had to pay half of the price. I responded I wasnt paying for any of it. I told her to take the veal marsala back to the chef/cook/manager and have him/her try it. She argued that I didnt have to pay for anything on the table because of the Groupon. I responded I know that because I already paid for it when I bought the Groupon.\\n\\nBecause she was giving messages from the manager- I asked for the manager to come out. I just wanted a manager to admit to my face that they were ok with serving this to a patron. I wanted to know that she stood behind the meal served. The waiter returned and said the manager said \\"Blah, blah, blah, repeating the same crap about paying for an additional meal'. I see that the manager was too scared to come out which ticked me off futher. At least, stand by your meal. At least, take the dish back and see what Im telling you. Take the learning lesson, act like you care about what Im saying. It was clear to me , sitting in an empty dining room on a Sunday, that the manager was either a rookie or just didnt care. \\nI guess I shouldn't be surprised that they didnt care about a customer when they serve what they serve.\\n\\nI tipped the server because it wasnt her fault but I will never return."},{"name":"Miss Me Yet?","address":"3468 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"This is the best restaurant I have seen in Vancouver in ages.

The sushi rolls are not wrapped tightly and the pieces are not as many as other higher end sushi restaurants.. so the moral of the story is you get what you pay for.. this place is not super cheap either.. so don't walk in thinking it's 1.00 sushi for all.. What is GREAT is there 1.00-3.00 Tempura (for 2 pieces). I really Enjoyed the Tempura Oysters , Shrimp, and Scallops.. it was delicious.. if I come back I think this is what I would order with some Cali rolls and miso soup.. cause the rest of the sushi is not worth spending the money on.. I would rather go somewhere else for fresher quality raw fish.\\nThe place is lively and is very BIRTHDAY friendly, the staff sings happy birthday in a Japanese accent, so you feel like you are in Japan?? I don't know.. but hey Saki Bomb.. was all I heard all night long, people chanting it, singing Birthday songs.. so if you want to embarrass your friend on their birthday this is the place to go.. they are made to stand up on the table when the song is being sung, then they take a saki-bomb... so Birthday appropriate with good music in the background."},{"name":"Grays","address":"301 W 6th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I hadn't ever had breakfast here until today and only went because I got a $8 voucher for staying at the hotel.

Since we figured out it was going to take a while, we ordered drinks and our meals together.  At least another 10 minutes goes by before we receive our drinks.

I finally got to about a week ago.\\n\\nCame here for lunch on a weekend and the place was full, but the wait wasn't too bad, maybe about 5 min.  Ordered a rib to try and the great northern brisket with a side of potato salad.\\n\\nI must say, for a BBQ joint, this place is a little on a pricier side, but I guess it's partly due to the location and partly due to their choice of meat.  Quality is definitely not an issue here in terms of meat.  The rib (you can order them individually or by the rack) I tried was incredibly tender and flavorful and the meat melted in my mouth.  It had great smoky flavor and I would say some of the best pork rib meat I have ever eaten.  Ditto on the brisket meat.  Just great smokiness and excellent meat quality.  I saw some Yelpers had complained that the meat here was overly salty, and that scared me a little bit, but after trying the meat here, I wonder if those people just mistook the smokiness of the meat for saltiness.  The flavor of the meat itself here was definitely different from other BBQ places in the Boston area, for example Redbones, Blue Ribbon, or SoulFire, and the quality of the meat here definitely exceeds the cuts used by other local BBQ restaurants.\\n\\nAs for Sweet Cheeks' sauce, it was okay but did not really shine for me.  I think I prefer Blue Ribbon's Sauces.  I do like how they serve their meats on Texas Toast though, but you really can't go wrong with a crisp piece of buttered white bread.\\n\\nAlso, I'm a potato salad lover, but the potato salad here was very disappointing.  It was just bland.  I'm not sure if maybe they forgot to season it.\\n\\nOverall, I'd be back because the meat is just awesome.

This restaurant is run by The Fifth Group, and from what I understand the Fifth Group refers to the 5 senses (i.e. sound, sight, smell, taste and touch).  After dining at Lure, I can say (without hesitation) that their mission to provide diners with a superlative, sensory experience succeeds on all levels (sorry the alliteration is not intentional).  \\n\\nMy sweetheart and I sat outside on the beautiful, minimalist patio, which is the epitome of understated elegance, and were ready to dive into our Lure experience (pun intended).  We started out with the fried ipswich clam bellies and the grilled octopus & pork lettuce wraps with mixed herbs and spicy Vietnamese sauce.  Both the octopus and the clams were super fresh (not chewy) and soft and buttery in the mouth.  The octopus, which had just the right amount of smokey yumminess, was served up with a nice offering of fresh herbs that reminded me of the  wraps I got while traveling in Thailand.  I highly recommend both.  For our main course, I had the perfectly seared George's Bank sea scallops, which were served with a heavenly butternut squash puree and perfectly seasoned saut√©ed kale, mushrooms and walnuts.  My sweetheart had the pan-fried sole fillets, which were ever-so-lightly breaded and flakey crisp (not soggy) with capers, brown butter and saut√©ed spinach.  When your restaurant's name is Lure, you better get the seafood right and trust me...they do.  I guess if I had to sum it up in one word, that word would be fresh!\\n\\nI could go on about the fabulous service, the over-the-top cocktails and the warm welcome we got from the hostesses, but that would take another page.  I will simply say thank you, Fifth Group, for delivering a feast to all 5 of my senses.  Lure is definitely my favorite seafood restaurant in all of Atlanta and I can't wait for my next visit.\\n\\nMy sweetheart took me to Lure after he had experienced it for lunch during the work week. We had eaten somewhere else, so we weren't hungry, but my sweetheart was so impressed with Lure that he wanted to take me there for a late afternoon cocktail. From the moment we entered the Lure walkway, I knew we were in for a treat. The subtly nuanced architecture, and decor let me know (immediately) that we were going to the sea. Upon entering, we were greeted with smiles and a very charming bartender, Brent Gatehouse. Let me tell you, I have traveled all over the world and lived in Los Angeles for 20 years and I have never run into a bartender with such passion and knowledge of \\"The cocktail.\\" Mr. Gatehouse, in essence, took us on a magical tour of Bali hi, which is populated by Blue-eyed boys and a wonderful concoction called Shochu. \\n\\nMr. Gatehouse takes his craft seriously. I mean, where else can you get a hand-blended, and hand-bottled cocktail? Yes, Brent mixes and then bottles his own personal elixirs from \\"The Bottle Shop.\\". There is the bali hi, described as domaine milou with benedictine, st. germain, and hopped grapefruit bitters; then there's themicha caliente, a provoking blend of lemon-lime soda, jalapeno vodka, orange liqueur, cranberry, and verdejo; finally, there is theblue-eyed boy, which is an appropriate marriage of bombay sapphire gin, mint, elderflower and peach bitters. I mean seriously!!!!! Who is doing this kind of thing? The first one we tried was so deliciously subtle and refreshingly light that we decided to split one of each from the bottle shop. \\n\\nThe more questions we asked about his liquid creations, the more Mr. Gatehouse morphed from a bartender to a cross between a college professor and mad scientist, which became more pronounced when I asked him about some of the mysterious-looking bottles with Japanese writing on them. They were clearly not Sake. This is where Scooby Doo, cocks his ears and looks sideways with that wonderful way Scooby talks... Rhatt???? \\n\\nThe bottles contained Shochu, which is described on the Lure drink menu as \\"somewhere between a martini and a glass of white wine.\\" Okay, that hooked us (insert wink at pun here ; ) ....Mr. Gatehouse treated us to an amazing tasting / tutorial of the marvelous qualities of Shochu. In an attempt to keep this review brief, I will sum it up in two words. Try it! Shochu is everything the menu promises. It is unique in its elegance and flavor. The crowning splendor of this cocktail is the ice, which Mr. Gatehouse also makes. No pre-formed cubes out of an ice maker will do for Mr. Gatehouse, NO!! He makes his ice to insure clarity and then he chips each piece by hand, which (I have to admit) looks like a piece of ice sculpture, jagged and very elegant, floating in the drink. This kind of attention to the cocktail elevates the whole experience to a spiritual plain and it left an indelible mark on me and my sweetheart. \\n\\nTonight we are going to experience Lure again, and this time we will eat dinner."},{"name":"Emmer & Rye","address":"51 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I can't say enough good things about our first dinner at Emmer and Rye!

Items included made to order omelettes and eggs Benedict, sliced prime rib, salmon, fried chicken, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, pancakes, home fries, grits, mac and cheese, Brussels sprouts, cold salads, the list goes on - with chocolate covered strawberries and berry cobbler with homemade whipped cream for dessert.

However it may be crowded because  tmr is Sunday and CFA is close on all Sundays. Anyway the restaurant is clean with flowers on the table which adds a nice touch to the decor. Their food here is SOO good I wouldn't even consider it fast food because their chicken tastes incredibly fresh and moist unlike McDonald's. Their waffle fries are to die for with some CFA sauce and ranch. Even their salads are good! They have free WiFi here as well.

She must have spoken for several minutes w/o taking a breath. That out of the way, we ordered several of our old standbys and several nigiri sushi that sounded interesting. The nigiri arrived first, with the announcement that they were out of the sea bass, with no suggestions of a substitute or assurance that it would be removed from our bill. A dump and run, if you will. The rolls arrived shortly after, and while the presentation was nice, they were mushy and lacked any flavor. Our meal was barely a cut above the pre-made sushi you can get in most supermarkets these days. \\n\\nAs I mentioned, we used to look forward to going to Musashino, but this will likely be our last visit. Yes, Tyson Cole came here to learn the art of sushi, but things have changed radically since our last visit.

I was cut off and the waiter said, \\"my manager told me I couldn't serve you\\". I thought he was making a joke so I tried again.. and the response was, \\"my manager said I couldn't serve you\\". We were all confused, I didn't understand what was going on at first so I said \\"okay, I'll just drink this water\\". After the waiter walked away, I told my friends, \\"I am going to use the bathroom.\\" I got up and started walking towards the bathroom. It's Saturday night so it was crowded in the place. I noticed there were people in the path I was in so I turned around and went another way to the bathroom. When I came back, the waiter brought my friends drinks out. He took our order and my friend asked for the manager. The waiter looked at my friend and said, \\"Which one? There are a lot here right now.\\" My friend replied, \\"the one who told you they couldn't serve Maya.\\" \\nSo then the manager came to the table. A white woman. As she approached the table, a bachelorette party was walking to their table directly behind us. The manager did not acknowledge me at all. She instead talked about me as if I was not sitting down next to her. She told my friends, \\"we noticed when she came in she was loud, and when she went to the bathroom she stumbled and ran into a wall\\". I then asked a question.. \\"it has nothing to do with my brown skin right?\\" Again she did not acknowledge my existence at the table, nor did she respond to my question. My friend then said, \\"what about the very loud bachelorette party behind us?\\" The manager said, \\"we didn't see them\\". I said to my friend, \\"it's okay they are all white\\".

I wish I had the time and willpower to go out and bury a bunch of clay jars full of unfermented kimchi in my backyard. I want to install a grill in the center of my dinner table. I wish I had banchan with every meal.  I wish I could play Starcraft for 36 hours per day. Alas, I can't do any of this so I have to settle for Korean restaurants.\\n\\nBut at Toji, it's hardly settling at all. In fact, it's quite the opposite. The Portland metropolitan area has quite an array of Korean food out in Beaverton/Hillsboro, but living in the city makes my visits out there few and far between. I just recently moved within walking distance of Toji and now I can tie a rubber band around my arm and inject spicy, delicious gochujang into my veins whenever I need a fix.\\n\\nJesus Christ, I love gochujang. As I proceeded to stuff my face with dolsot bibimbap (a hot dish comprised of carrots, rice, a fried egg, a protein [I opted for tofu this round], cabbage, and mushrooms) I couldn't stop squirting gochujang all over the place. And Toji gives you an entire BOTTLE of it to supplement your bibimbap! If I wouldn't have burned every single one of my taste buds off, I would have licked the clay pot it was served in completely dry. \\n\\nOf course, how could I forget the banchan. Every single banchan item was phenomenal. The daikon and regular kimchis were spicy, extremely pungent of garlic, and very fresh. Orianne G. really adored the two mung beans, and we both thought the sweet potatoes were divine.\\n\\nI'm not going to dock them a star for this, but I wasn't entirely impressed with the Yakisoba.

The Athens location surprisingly is the coolest).  After briefing over a few of the reviews other people wrote, I can relate with some of the bad reviews... Here is the deal:  Atlanta is a place that is very spread out with numeorus neighborhoods and, each neighborhood brings many great restaurants- Japanese and other styles alike.\\n\\nSo yeah, Ru San's definitely does not have the best, most freshest sushi.  But that is not what makes Ru San's, Ru San's.  The atmosphere does.  There is no place in Atlanta like Ru San's.  It is a fun place that is typically designed decently, and it offers Sake Bombs and varying drinks galore.  The sushi is cheap and decent (and yes, I too was once grossed out by the buffet but I suppose with years I have become a little less finnicky with food on buffet lines).  I have eaten here probably over 100 times (been going there for like 6 years and used to be obsessed with it!) and never gotten sick or anything.\\n\\nSo, to end this review, I say to all the people who reviewed poorly- you need to take into account atmosphere when reviewing (and, for their lack of taking that into account, I am giving it a 5 to hopefully skew bad reviews).  If you go here to get a quiet atmosphere, well, you may just be a little mental.  But, if you want to go somewhere and be loud and drink a few bombs and eat a little sushi, go here.  Hell, I just remembered I celebrated my 22nd b-day here twice- once with my friends on a Friday, the next with my family on Monday.\\n\\nSo, yeah I like Ru-San's.  But, I will tell ya straight up, I am not going to go here for the best sushi.  No, that certainly is not Ru-San's style (and they would probably concur with that statement).  It is for the atmosphere and cheap sushi!  So, go there and have fun... And, ya know what, take a sake bomb for me, would ya?!

Yay!\\n\\nThe green dragon has opened shop in the semi-industrial area of SE 9th and Belmont.  Sharing warehouse space with a micro-distillery, and within blocks of Roots and Lucky Lab, Green Dragon is the newest addition to what may soon become known as \\"Libation Alley\\" or the \\"Beermuda Triangle\\" (if the workers at Green Dragon have their way). \\n\\nThe space is industrial, and as of yet, very spartan.  The place is split into 2 sides, the bar and the bistro. The whole place is non-smoking.  The bar side is cavernous, with a long bar down the south side (the side shared with the bistro), industrial looking open space in back, and a huge, high ceiling open area with a few raised stand-up tables running the length of the space.  There is also a side bar in the front corner which by its looks will come in handy on busier nights.  The decorations so far are, of course, beer banners, posters, etc. They are few and far between. As the tenders admit, they still have some work to do. It looks like there's a big, roll-up garage door on the front. That's going to be nice in about 9 months when the sun comes back.\\n\\nThe bistro side is much smaller and cozier, with a few sit-down tables and a small bar of its own. As far as I could tell, minors would be allowed in this side, but not in the bar side.  This would be a nice place to sit and have dinner and great beer.\\n\\nThe taps stand at ~12 so far, and I believe thy intend to expand to ~20 before they are done. The pour list seems to be diverse and ever changing. As I understand it, the mantra of the publician is that he will not pour a beer that can be found elsewhere in PDX. That's a noble (yet hard to manage) cause. But, it makes for a unique and eclectic selection of beers on tap.  Currently they have Old Rasputin on their nitro. Mmmmm.  I enjoyed the Maredsous last night, and it was fantastic (I would suggest it if they still have it on tap).  They serve beers by the glass and the half-glass (for the strong ales). The prices are extremely reasonable ($3.75 for most pours) for hard-to-find beers. As of yet, they don't have any beer menus, so you have to go look at the list on the wall to determine what beer you want.  The tenders are pros, and are quite good at suggesting a beer (and are more than willing to give you a taster so you can make an informed decision).\\n\\nThey serve food, but alas, I did not have any last night. A confidential source tells me the fries are good, but beyond that, I will have to save my food reviews for after a second visit.\\n\\nOne of the cool aspects of this place is how they went about getting it open. It was a real community effort. They did some micro-investing programs such as \\"buy a bar stool\\" investment and \\"buy a mug\\" investment.  We bought 2 mugs last night, and therefore have become somewhat elite patrons. Now when we come in we have our mug waiting for us (and we get a cheaper, bigger pour).   It feels good to be invested in a grassroots beer effort. \\n\\nThe staff is friendly and knowledgeable (beer geeks!). The space is kinda comfortable, but will become much more so as they continue to settle in.  The beer is, of course, great.  The food is, as of yet, of undetermined quality.  Therefore, I will stick with 4 stars.

I had the dinner sized Wild Boar Bolognese, which was absolutely mouth-watering sublime. I asked for some crushed red pepper to kick it up a notch and loved every single bite. All pastas are house-made; there is an herb and vegetable garden just outside and the flavors burst on the tongue. Breads are also made in-house and a perfect complement to the antipasti. Including tip, our entire meal was about $75 per person, very reasonable for the quality, flavor and service. Our server Brandon had plenty of help: empty plates were whisked away, wine and water glasses refilled without prompting and the bread basket was never empty. I would highly recommend Primo to anyone in Orlando, whether you're staying at the hotel or not.

I rarely find myself so significantly straying from popular opinion.\\n\\nThe pizza is cooked on flat-bread. Some may like this, I found it messy, textureless, and rather tasteless. I struggled with the menu for quite some time before picking #3. This place must be getting kick-backs from the onion industry since almost every one of their pizzas comes with caramelized onions (which for the record are tasteless and probably made with water and not stock). \\n\\nService was snappy and my pizza arrived fast food fast. I noticed quickly it was sparsely decorated with tomato sauce and cheese. But the onions were piled high. I must admit the scallions added after baking were a good touch since almost nothing else had any flavor and the spotty sauce and cheese coverage required some redistribution on my part. Maybe I had a fluke, so I tried both of my friend's pizzas - a #2 and #5. Both of which were rather bland and messily thrown together.\\n\\nTheir pizzas have no crust, and for crust aficionados like myself I found this very disappointing. Some may like this choice. But between poor combinations, bad distribution of said toppings, and an overall tasteless mushiness this place doesn't impress me. Not even the red pepper flakes and chili oil could save this gastronomical disaster.\\n\\nThe food here certainly gets points for using fresh ingredients. Something like this is very appreciated in the pizza world. However, I fail to see the creative side  of this place when someone can get far more innovative (and sometimes questionable) combinations at California Pizza Kitchen or the Upper Crust.\\n\\nI will say I was happily surprised with their bottled beer menu. My Allagash White was the highlight of my meal.

Regardless of how nice the interior is, or how innovative the menu, a sashimi restaurant should first and foremost be judged on two things: the quality of the fish, and the quality of the dashi. Once they've got that right, they can feel free to gussy it up in whatever manner they'd like.\\n\\nOrdered a 10-piece sashimi plate, chef's choice. What we got: 2 slices of hamachi, 2 slices of madai, 2 slices of tamagoyaki, and 2 pieces of crabstick.\\n\\nFirst: the obvious problem. That's only 8 pieces. I mentioned this to the waitress and the chef, and they both apologized, but did nothing.\\n\\nSecond: not only was the madai less than fresh, but it was served warm. 1 1/2 pieces of that were still on the plate when the waitress cleared it.\\n\\nThird: tamagoyaki (a rolled egg omelet) is a strange choice to put on a sashimi plate to begin with. What makes it even stranger is when the egg is not even cooked on premises. The sashimi 'chef' opened up a cryo-vacked package of pre-cooked egg, sliced some off, and put it on the plate. If I want to pay for pre-cooked eggs, I can get two Egg McMuffins for $3 at McDonalds\\n\\nFourth: Crab stick is not sashimi. Crab stick should not even be recognized as food. It is pulverized white-fish scraps that have been cooked, sweetened, and dyed red. I couldn't believe it when I saw it on the plate. I kept waiting for the chef to announce that I was on hidden camera to see my reaction, but it never happened. Instead, he sincerely asked me if everything was ok. I stared back at him, dumbfounded.\\n\\nAt least the hamachi was ok.\\n\\nAfter sashimi, we had some tempura, which asides from being slightly greasy, and not too crisp, was surprisingly edible.\\n\\nFinally, we had the miso soup, if it can be called that. The miso was obviously of very low quality, and the dashi literally tasted like salt water. Making a good quality dashi is very simple. All it requires is good ingredients. Apparently Gari would rather spend its money on flashy interiors than quality food.\\n\\nThis place is an insult to japanese food and should be avoided at all costs by anyone who enjoys foood more than atmosphere.

The location is cute, but there definitely is not a lot of room for customers to dine indoors.\\nFor Georgia or for people who have not had poke before, this is pretty good. However, don't expect it to taste like something you would find in Socal or Hawaii. To me and my friends, the poke was standard and decent. The menu is very minimal: choose between a bowl and burrito style, tuna or salmon, and savory or spicy sauce. There are no options for toppings or for white or brown rice. Given that this place is just a pop-up, these shortcomings can be forgiven. Among us, my friends and I ordered the salmon with savory sauce and salmon with spicy sauce as well as the tuna with spicy sauce. I applaud them for the short waiting time to receive our food once we ordered. Presentation was fine; the bowl looked appetizing and the portion size was just right.\\n\\nAll in all, I wasn't too convinced of this place, and it's not that memorable to me. I've had fresher salmon meat before- a couple chunks of my salmon tasted really fishy/iodine-y here and left a strange aftertaste in my mouth. I've had larger portion sizes of the actual fish- this bowl had a lot of rice and lettuce. The sauce wasn't as \\"savory\\" as I thought it would be and wasn't mixed into the bowl that well. After a few bites, everything seemed to taste more and more bland. Not many distinct flavors or pleasant surprises or subtle complexities. The pieces of seaweed were nice- I'm a huge fan of chilled seaweed so that's a plus in my book. There were 3 meager slices of avocado and 4 thin slices of cucumber. Everything was placed on top of a bed of rice and lettuce. Anddd that's pretty much the meal. Nothing fancy, nothing extraordinary. Have I had better? Definitely. Have I had worse? Also true. Will I wait in line again for this poke? Probably not. But for Georgia standards, this is probably as good as it will get. So if you're craving decent poke around here and willing to wait in a line, I recommend this place.\\nThe meal is a little pricier than what I'm used to for poke, but it's somewhat justifiable since good poke is hard to come by in Georgia."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Food was overpriced and honestly not that great at all.

I've been twice - once for Saturday lunch and once for a weekday dinner - and have had no problem getting a parking spot in their lot. They did a bang-up job of maximizing the parking situation on an otherwise small plot of land.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is bright, modern and clean without feeling sterile. I have a soft spot for restaurants in converted houses...they just feel so cozy and intimate. Upon entry, it's a bit confusing to figure out how things work. Do I find a table? Go order at the counter? Which counter? Where does the line queue? They don't need a Hopdoddy-esque set of rules and regulations, but a little more guidance by the door would be helpful. Oh, and a different handle/lock situation for the bathrooms would be nice. They have cool leather and chrome door knobs, but the leather feels a wee bit unsanitary. And, the lock is so teensy that I was convinced that someone would unexpectedly pop-in while I was doing my business.\\n\\nThe menu is on the small side - a carefully curated list of fresh ingredients with simple preparations. I ended up ordering the grilled Comte sandwich with tomato soup both times I went because it is just so darn tasty. I have had a life-long distaste for tomato soup, so I was shocked when I happily dipped my sandwich and spooned out the dregs afterward. The grilled cheese is swoon-worthy. Writing about it makes my stomach grumble with hunger.\\n\\nThe service is - as many have mentioned - awkward and not super-friendly.

When traffic delayed the arrival of the bulk of our party, the manager came to personally make sure everything was alright. While we waited, my husband, son, and I enjoyed their margherita flatbread, potato skins, and meatball appetizers. They were delicious! The sauce on the flatbread wasn't too sweet, and the basil was fresh and aromatic, and my son's meatballs could have been a meal in themselves.

The service isn't stellar, their margaritas aren't the best and it gets really packed.\\n\\nLike most Mexican food places, their carnitas are really good.

They are very particular about the chips, which I understand as it's on campus, but I always feel like a criminal if anyone I'm with asks for more.\\n\\nHonestly, this used to be my second favorite Mexican restaurant in Columbus. My biggest complaint would be the time they asked me and my dining partner to move. We were sitting at a two seater, and a large group came in. Instead of letting us finish, they literally asked us to move so they could accomidate the larger party. I get it, you want to make money, a larger party will help you do so, but ever since then, I've really disliked coming here. They didn't really help with moving anything, and it was quite mortifying to have to carry all of our stuff from one table to another in the middle of eating.

The patio is generously sized and very attractive. \\n\\nThe reason I do not frequent this place is because I just do not find the food to be that impressive.

Maybe the vegetarian and vegan options are a bit better.  The smoothies are a strong point of this place with really good fruit mixed into a creamy yogurt base. But, the prices for the smoothies are kind of high. The famous ginger-ale, I feel is a bit overdone as it is almost too strong drink. \\n\\nWhile the presentation of the food is very good and there are some interesting entrees, I just feel that the cuisine is missing a touch of that home cooked, authentic flair.

Before ordering I had to get through some confusion. Goldberg's advertises itself as \\"a NY style deli.\\" And, yes, there are lots of bagels; pastrami; chopped liver; white fish salad; and matzo ball soup.  But wait - also on the menu is ham, bacon, quesadillas, and even biscuits! See what I mean? \\nBut I suppose that Toco Hills can also be confusing.  One one side of it is a large, and seemingly thriving, Jewish neighborhood; on another side is the nice, older Victoria Estates which houses quite a few Emory-working folks; and on yet another side is the NE Atlanta \\"millionaire next door neighborhood\\" whose residents generally don't go for anything very different or exciting.  Maybe Goldberg's is trying to serve all of these constituencies. The former close-by Bagel Palace, RIP, never strayed from the Jewish NY-style deli. I love biscuits with breakfast, but loved and respected the Bagel Palace for staying true to its roots.  I never saw a biscuit, or grits, on a Bagel Palace plate. \\nThe omelets are predictable: Spanish, veggie, country, and nova. You can \\"build your own\\" omelet, which is noticeably more costly than the prescribed ones. There are the usual pancakes, waffles, and French toast; several breakfast sandwiches. There are no scrambles which I have come to appreciate on other menus. The plates come with no garnishes to provide a bit of green, and a bit of a green salad is not offered as has become the practice at other places, especially the ones that charge similar prices to Goldberg's. \\nOh.

However, this is Izakaya (basically a place to eat, drink and socialize) so there is nothing wrong with ordering a bunch of small dishes to share.

The interior needs help.  It looks old and run down.  Really old fashioned.  I am really disappointed at the decor.  The lighting is really dim, feels like I'm eating in the dark.  Dishes seems like they are sitting there so long that everything feels sticky.  The cups have sticky feel and they look dirty. \\n\\nThe food is the one that drop the stars to 1 - I end up getting sick after dinner.  Here's the breakdown of what I ate:\\nSampler - 5 spiced beef is too salty, I can get better barbeque pork at Kam Man than there, roast pork is salty and dry, chilled pig feet thing is cut way too thick and it's dry and salty, only thing that was okay tasting was the cuttlefish, jellyfish, and the picked vegetables with it.\\n\\nBird Nest - only had 2 pieces of sea conch in there.  Lobster in there was not fresh.  Scallop, squid, and shrimp was mediocre.  The broccoli in there was cold.\\n\\nSeafood food with shark fin - both of them together don't mix well.  It ruined the shark fin.  The scallop and shrimp were not fresh and had a fishy tasty to it.  The lobster was frozen kind and had some kind of frozen fish in there that just doesn't mix well.  It was also too thick.\\n\\nSalt & Pepper Shrimp, Pork Chop, and Squid - over-fried and too salty.\\n\\nFried Chicken with shrimp chips - chicken was too dry.\\n\\nGinger and Scallion Dungeon Crab - too much corn starch used to fry it.  Not sure if it is a fresh crab.  I had better.  Wish Chinese restaurants would clean the crab before cooking it.\\n\\nStir fried pea pod tips with garlic - okay but I think they added sugar to it.\\n\\nYang Chow Fried Rice - the oil they used doesn't seem fresh, the rice tasted funny.\\n\\nYee Mein - Too sweet and the noodles were all broken.\\n\\nRed bean dessert with tapioca - tasted like sugar water with no red beans in there but it's not good at all.\\n\\nOverall - too much sugar and msg. The wait staff was terrible.  The cups were dirty and they don't even want to change it.  I asked for bowls for the rice and it took them a while to bring it to us.

We ate there a few days ago and had a great meal, including the best vegetarian sandwich ever and a great Cobb salad that fed two of us.\\n\\nWere it not for my daughter's insistence, we would have gone elsewhere because I try to avoid restaurants that don't have a 4+ star rating on Yelp.\\n\\nI agree that Stephanie's  is a bit over-priced particularly the $15 dollar burger.  Unlike  the \\"$6.95 burger\\" at Carl's Jr, this burger actually costs $15!"},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Went there around 4pm on a Friday.

A party of 6 signed up right after us and guess what! They were seated before us ! They waited at least 15 minutes.

Our experience here overall was horrible but I mostly blame the hostess for this. I came here on a Friday after work with two of my friends and we were not sat for almost 2 hours even though the hostess originally estimated that we would be able to sit within 45 minutes and kept reassuring us that we were next on the list. We basically had to stand at the hostess stand for the last 20-25 minutes and forced them into sitting us. On the other hand our waiter was very nice and accommodating when we had some special requests. The positive side of waiting so long was that we were able to take advantage of the small outside bar area that they have. The bartender  was fantastic. The two girls I was with could not decide on a drink and he ended up making them two drinks on the spot for them to try and they were both delicious.

Our server was very attentive, even as more tables were coming in, letting us know if we weren't satisfied with our drinks we could order something else. \\n\\nDrinks were tasty and poured well. Husband had the Spicy Redhead (a little too throat-burning for me) and I had the grapefruit margarita. \\n\\nFor appetizers, Husband had the bacon wrapped goat cheese grape leaves which he said were tasty but we're very small.

The sauce was perfectly spiced and sweet, but we both would have preferred a little more chicken. I enjoyed the deviled eggs (husband did not) and he enjoyed the collard greens (I did not- too buttery). Husband had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and I had the fruity milk cake which was a large serving for a dessert but tasty. \\n\\nOverall we would come here again but maybe without the little one.

The included pickles and onions added a nice acidic component as well. I'm not big on biscuits, but I ordered one anyway because so many people on here raved about them. The biscuit was certainly very good - dense and moist yet flaky. It didn't blow my mind away though, so if you generally don't care about biscuits I would skip it.

I love good nachos, Over the years, each of my favorite options has changed or closed and I wanted something good. Centro is a sister restaurant to a couple of our other favs in Boulder but for one reason or another we had never gone. We had been to its predecessor at this location, and it was OK, but we stuck to our others. Maybe too many options in Boulder!\\n\\nWe made the effort to get there Saturday night and it was really worth it. We got there in time to catch the end of Happy Hour, got drinks and nachos for a good price and stayed to follow up with some more small plates for dinner and dessert. The nachos had my favorite style light and crispy chips, plenty of tasty queso, black beans, pickled onions, jalape√±os, pico, cotija and fresh guacamole included without any up charge for it. Very nice presentation and flavor. Enough toppings for something on every chip, and puddles of queso to scoop from the plate.\\n\\nMy paloma was fresh and tasty, my husband liked his draft beer.\\n\\nWe followed this with two tacos each. I am a fan of corn tortillas so I took two from the Baja selection, the garlic shrimp and the mahi. Though small street sized  tortillas, they were filled to the brim, fresh slaw with the fish. My husband had the barbacoa and the garlic shrimp and was equally pleased. We followed this with the churros for me and ice cream for him and I shared one churro. Generous of me, right?  The churros were good but not great like the ones I am addicted to at their sister restaurant though probably the same batter. Could have used a little more cinnamon and been cooked a little hotter or longer. But still tasty.\\n\\nI have to say, last night, though crowded, the service was very good. They seemed to be training some new staff, partnering with competent servers so they weren't out there winging it on their own. They probably were at the limit of staff to capacity since when we left, there were a few empty but yet uncleared tables, but a line still waiting outside. A hard situation, because even if they get people moved in faster, I wonder if the kitchen could even keep up. Always a quandary for such a popular place, especially on a balmy Saturday night.\\n\\nWe will return. I am really pleased to hear that they will be starting lunches this week,  from 11-2 weekdays.

How do you miss?\\n\\nI love their crunchy hard tacos but they don't do a great job putting together my tacos 8 out of 10 times. They are inconsistent with the amount of meat they put in each taco and they never drain the mild salsa so my tacos basically turn into soft tacos by the time I get back to work. I don't know how they do it but every time I get my tacos to go, they wrap it up in a way that cracks and breaks them. I might as well be eating a salad with chips.\\n\\nAnother downside is their undercook steak (close to rare)....they are probably in a hurry and always run out of meats due to the lunch rush. \\n\\nPerhaps it's the volume they get here or the people they hire...it's the worst chipotle I've been to.

Located in a nondescript strip mall in the middle of Beaverton, this place is easy to miss. However, once you step in through the entryway, you will be welcomed by an understated yet truly legit Japanese ramen experience. \\n\\nThe service is impeccable, as the server is quick to serve a little edamame to snack on while you look through the menu. My cup of water was never empty as they came by pretty often to refill my drink.\\n\\nFor appetizers I recommend the gyoza (aka potstickers). The process of making gyoza is deceptively hard to get to get right. A proper gyoza is boiled and then fried to the point where it's lightly browned. Most places will simply boil and/or deep fry the gyoza for the sake of expediency. \\n\\nNot only does Yuzu do the gyoza the right way, they also do the dipping sauce the right way too. Sometimes the dipping sauce is pure soy sauce, which is too salty. Sometimes they put in too much rice vinegar, which then makes it too acidly. Again yuzu does this just right with the perfect mix to compliment the gyoza.\\n\\nAs for the ramen itself, you can't really go wrong with any of the dishes. The broths are all very flavorful and they are very generous with the pork slices. I would recommend the shoryu (soy based) or the tonkotsu (pork broth). \\n\\nIn short, if you're in a mood for serious ramen, then yuzu is definitely worth the trip!"},{"name":"Emmer & Rye","address":"51 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The food could have been good, but I didn't get a chance to taste much of it as when we got our second course there was a long piece of HAIR inside our dish.

We started with Miso which was very good.  Then proceeded to order sweet shrimp with heads, salmon roe, tuna belly, salmon, and a few rolls.  The sweet shrimp heads have always been served fried in every sushi restaurant I have visited across the country.  Not the shrimp, but the heads.  Not these...  We were served tuna rather than tuna belly.  When we pointed this out, they did switch this out for us.  Then after waiting for quite a bit of time, we asked about the wait on the salmon roe.  Our waitress informed us that it would be a while because it was thawing - never encountered this either.  We also ordered chicken skewers for the kids, and had to send them back to the kitchen.  4 skewers of tough overcooked chicken between soggy wilted asparagus.  Our kids thought it was awful as did I.  I ordered them a bowl of sticky rice that was hardly edible.  Let me say that we take our children with us to sushi frequently, and expected this meal to be like every other, or a step up based on the hotel.  Highly disappointed.

Anderson Lane","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"***Update- I had submitted this original review on 2/21/12, and received messages from two different members of management that same day wanting to make it right, and apologizing for the incident. They asked for my address so they could send coupons, so that we might give them another chance. I provided my address (although receiving coupons was not my original intent) and here we are, 5/1/12 and still nothing has been received. This only furthers my original impression of poor customer service.***\\n\\nI recently had a really bad customer service experience at Elevation Burger which seemed out of the ordinary. I wrote in to their CS department on 1/15/12, as follows:\\n\\n\\"Hi there,\\n\\nI just wanted to contact you about my experience at one of your\\nlocations this past Saturday (the Anderson Lane location in Austin,\\nTX).\\n\\nMy husband and I love Elevation Burger and had a facebook KGB coupon\\nto use, which we planned to do on Saturday. The food was delicious,\\nlike always. However, the customer service experience was not quite\\nwhat I've come to expect.\\n\\nPretty much every time we have come to Elevation Burger we have been\\nmet with really superb service. We are usually asked a couple of times\\nhow the food is after we've received it and we always feel like our\\nbusiness is appreciated. Saturday seemed to have a different staff\\nworking- all younger teens or twenty somethings and all very\\nunprofessional.\\n\\nFirst, my husband and I waited in line for about five minutes because\\nthere was an issue with the order with the person in front of us. No\\nbiggie, but when we got our chance to order I presented the cashier\\nwith the coupon ($15) and we placed our order. After it took a while\\nto key it in, I took the cups and went to get drinks for my husband\\nand I while my husband finished the transaction. I realized after\\nawhile that it was taking longer than normal and I went back to see\\nwhat was going on. My husband was now being rung up on a different\\nregister because something had happened with the first. When all was\\ncomplete, we sat back down and waited. That's when I noticed a table\\nnear us with a mom, baby and an approximately ten year old, barefoot\\nboy. They weren't eating, just sitting at the table. After noticing\\nthem, I turned my attention back to our table and saw our receipt and\\nthen noticed our coupon had not been applied, and the charge was for\\n$22 dollars or so. I asked my husband what had happened with the\\ncoupon and he said he thought that the cashier had taken it off.\\n\\nI took the receipt and went back up to the counter. The cashier was\\nkind enough and apologized, but was very frazzled and seemed\\noverwhelmed, mentioning something about the problem being due to a\\nshift change. This was all fine and understandable, but while I was\\nwaiting for him to refund/re-ring the actual difference I was\\ndistracted by a very rude and loud female cook who was complaining\\nloudly about how lazy everyone else was that worked there and that she\\ncouldn't believe there weren't more baskets of fries cooking at that\\ntime. She began harshly flinging pans and pots around, looking for\\nmore baskets (I guess) and just making a big scene. It was very\\nunprofessional.\\n\\nNext, while I was still waiting for the ticket adjustment I noticed a\\nyounger female employee come into the store from the back, say hello\\nto everyone as if she was just starting her shift and then she went\\nand sat at the table with the mom and kids. She was apparently there\\nto work, but was just hanging out with this person. At this point our\\ncheck was figured out, our food came and I went and sat down to eat.\\nAfter a couple of bites I noticed one of the male cooks come out from\\nthe kitchen and into the dining area. He came over to the same table\\nwith the other employee and the mom/kids and began hanging out, too.\\nHe then took out a pack of cigarettes, put one in his mouth and\\ncontinued talking. Then, he went outside and lit it. While he was out\\nthere he took his work shirt off and was walking around in just his\\nundershirt. Then, he came back in, still with only his undershirt and\\ncontinued to hang out with the same table. He was leaning against the\\ncondiments, blocking the soda and was very distracting.\\n\\nThe main reason I wanted to send this along was because I know that\\nservice seemed to previously have been of major importance to\\nElevation Burger and I would hate for this to be an issue where when\\nmanagement is away, the restaurant goes hay wire. Again, despite all\\nthat I mentioned, the food quality was still delicious- it's just\\neverything else that would make me want to take my food to go next\\ntime.\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\n---\\nAnd today, after a month of waiting for a response, I received this:\\n\\n\\"Thank you for the feedback, I will se that it is addressed.\\n\\nBest regards.\\"\\n---\\nNeedless to say, we won't be going back as customer service is obviously not a priority there anymore."},{"name":"Saz√≥n","address":"1816 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Delicious!

The snapper again over cooked, to the point we sent it away after a quick taste. It was quickly brought back and we were asked to try the middle of the fish.

I dwell, linger, and page through Mental_Floss. I take my food home and devour the chips in the car before I get there. In the summer, I get ginger ale, the only soda I actually crave, or the smoothies.\\n\\nI don't order salads for meals anywhere else. But here, the meal-size salads are hugely flavorful and very filling, even if you ask for them vegan (make sure to ask for a tofu substitution specifically if you want it, or it may come without protein).\\n\\nThe Buddha Bowl and Square Meal hit the spot and make you feel good about your food choice. The Northstar Burger tends to fall apart, but you'll scoop up the crumbles until there isn't a single crumb left. The bread they serve it on if you ask for it vegan is actually better than the egg-containing bun.\\n\\nLet's talk about the flatbread. Years ago, when I first started coming here, it took a while before I ordered this because I didn't make the association between the name of the dish on the menu and the pizzas I occasionally saw come out from the kitchen. Each time I saw one, I'd think, \\"I don't remember pizza being on the menu. I'll have to check it out next time.\\" Eventually, it clicked. Flatbread. I get it with tofu instead of cheese, and the tofu is slightly crisped and salted and could probably be diced smaller but works nonetheless. The veggies on the High Street Veggie flatbread are a great combination, as long as the jalapenos don't get overwhelming.\\n\\nThey're always very nice here. I've been here so many times that they were bound to screw up or forget my order once or twice, just because of the odds. Each time, they were happy to accommodate. In one case, my order didn't come out for half an hour (it wasn't too busy at the time, and half an hour is a long time for them). I checked in, and they were apologetic. They made my food again and gave me a coupon for a free meal next time. In another case, my burrito came with chicken instead tofu. I drove all the way back, and they replaced it without argument (no coupon that time, but I don't tend to expect anything special).\\n\\nSo yeah, the employees have their \\"only human\\" flaws, but I can't remember ever having issues with the food. Well ok, the broccoli in the Buddha Bowl might seem overly crisp if you're used to frozen mush. Is that a Norhstar drawback? Probably not. :)"},{"name":"El Arroyo 5th Street","address":"1624 W 5th St","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Their Marquee sign is a definite highlight.

The serving sizes are large for us, so we are leaning towards the appetizer sizes.In our most recent visit we started out by sharing the cow's heart appetizer, which was very tasty (if you like heart). I had the pork stew -- delicious, with very tender pork, white corn (nothing like anything you find in the US) and a wonderful broth. My partner had the spicy pork belly special.

When your \\"specials\\" are $7.40 for double high balls and $4.15 for domestic sleeves (not pints), plus taxes, then you are ripping off the public.  \\n\\nWhat really irked me about the place was the whole conversion to a Night Club thing.  I had to then start a tab with the waitress by handing over a credit card.  The worst part was when all the douchebags and their hos showed up and jammed up the dance floor and all other spaces.  The layout of the pub/club is not very conducive to travelling to and from the bathroom once the dancing begins.  You either have to squish your way through the \\"dance floor\\" (and I use that term lightly because it is a tiny space no bigger than my living room, where they have just taken a few tables out of the way) or go around the upper level which is also jammed with guys trying to pick up chicks, so that you get dirty looks when you try and squeeze past.  Once you get to the hallway back to the bathroom there is a sad and lonely long table that gets deserted once the dancing begins because you can't see anything from it. \\n\\nThe bathrooms are way too small for the number of people they let in, and they clearly don't get checked and cleaned by staff throughout the night.  Cyndi is right about the water everywhere, too.  The driers are fancy jets, but they don't make up for the cramped conditions.  I even bumped a poor girl in the face when I opened the door because she had no where else to stand but behind the door.  \\n\\nThey clearly let in way too many people for the designated capacity of the place, because I seriously couldn't move in there, and yet the snooty bitches still felt it was my fault that I had to squeeze past and would elicit nasty looks.  Not my fault they want to cram us in like sardines.\\n\\n90's night was pumping... however the ADHD DJ didn't seem content with playing songs for longer than 30 - 60 seconds, so once people got into the groove of one song it would be on to the next one.  Which of course meant the DJ ran out of tunes quickly, so there were several repeats.  Lame.\\n\\nOur server actually wasn't bad (she was nice and split my bill for me, and checked on us often), and the yam fries I had were good and came out quickly, hence the 2nd star for this review.

It took nearly an additional 40 minutes just to get a salad. When we got the bill, the dish we specified we could not eat was still on there. The waitress copped an attitude saying we had not mentioned anything. Other people  who knew the owner went to talk to her and after 20 or so minutes, finally had it taken off the bill after the original \\"offer\\" was to have the smallest item taken off.

Case in point, their Chow Meins: their menu has two sections \\"Chow Mein\\" (Americanized) and \\"Cantonese Style Chow Mein\\" (authentic -- can't remember the exact section title). This is both good and bad -- you do have to sift through many, many inauthentic Americanized dishes to get to the great (authentic) ones; but unlike so many other places, at least the great ones are still there!\\n\\nTheir Cantonese pan-fried noodle (chow mein) is easily the best I've had in the area, and probably the best I've had outside Toronto. They also do an amazing egg scramble chow fun -- served in a ginormous bowl, enough to feed 8 people! As others have noted their Salt & Pepper Squid is out-of-this-world good -- I could eat several helpings of this. I will also note that their Fish Maw & Crab Meat soup is (like the pan-fried noodle) way lots better than any other I've had in the area.\\n\\nThe only disappointment we've had food-wise is their Chicken & Salt Fish fried rice. It wasn't bad by any stretch, but used a very different salted mackeral than any other dish, and it's definitely one thing that I make better at home. We were hopeful about it, but probably wouldn't get it again because of the very different flavor profile.\\n\\nAll in all, this place has been a bit of a saving grace. The main issue is that the overwhelming majority of their dishes fall into the inauthentic Americanized fare, and so we'd probably end up rotating between the same set of dishes again and again. But, that has not stopped us from coming back (several times); and what we've ordered so far has generally been exceptional."},{"name":"Kadoya Japanese Restaurant","address":"1063 Davie St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"After all the amazing things I have heard about this place, I had to try it.

I suggested they have someone taste test them every day.  They brought me a plate of shrimp with no peppers and even though this was wonderful customer service these shrimp were very bland.  Sigh.  Guess it wasn't my day.  My son enjoyed his order a lot, and the presentations of both plates was good.  High marks for customer service.  Everyone was very nice.  I'll give them another try, will just be careful not to order a spicy dish in case the peppers are extra hot that day."},{"name":"Shaking Crab - Boston Common","address":"140 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This restaurant is close to my hotel, the Revere.

Frank's has been in business since 1938 and there's a good reason for that: they provide good steaks for an affordable price and with pretty good service to boot. Oh, and they have a pretty good selection of specials.\\n\\nThe atmosphere in this joint is very old school. The kind of place your parents would drag you to for your birthday or another special occasion back in the day. The staff there has been around for a while. But the atmosphere has charm and history. I dig it. I like places that have been in business a long time: it gives it character.\\n\\nAlthough I have yet to go on a weekday, on weekends, they have a live piano player who plays by the bar which is neat. I've been here with my parents and with friends and every time we've walked happy and satisfied. \\n\\nUnlike other big name steakhouses, Frank's Steak House features a more affordable menu, which I think is why it's been so successful. Whether you want a NY strip or a Delmonico cut, you'll be hard pressed to find any entre costing upwards of $25 or $30 with more being around $20.\\n\\nBut looking past the value of it all, the selection itself is pretty solid. They have seafood dishes, they have chicken dishes and dishes that combine steak and crab or lobster. The sides are pretty classic and run from baked potatoes to broccoli florets and even sauteed onions or mushrooms. They don't however have creamed spinach which is a shame.\\n\\nFrank's is a no-frills kind of place where one can except a decent meal with decent service and decent prices. It's not a high end steakhouse by any means nor does it claim to be one. Instead it's a casual, comfortable and friendly, old school spot which is conveniently located on Massachusetts Avenue near a few blocks away from Davis Square."},{"name":"Tony Roma's","address":"8560 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Went there in around 10:30 PM set at the bar staff seem to have a very long day what is understandable being that it's the holiday season but we must remember the people are on vacation and expect to be treated well can't say much about the food the butter on the steak was not melted we do not ask for better the server felt like they were doing us a favor by doing their job we could've went anywhere and being that it was close to $100 birds.

And I've got to say that AFURI's ramen matched or exceeded the best of the best I've had (Ippudo, Totto, and Terakawa in NYC and Orechi and Santouka in San Jose). AFURI is counter-service based, which was fine by us--but keep in mind that when you arrive, you'll review the menu and order and pay at a counter. You'll be given a number and receive your food from the wait staff when it's ready. You can always order more food or drinks from the staff as the meal goes on; but this is not \\"full service\\" in the traditional sense. Just FYI. \\n\\nI'm biased toward pork-based broth (the standard), so I thought I'd try one of AFURI's chicken-based options. I got the spicy one, and it was delightful--full of great vegetables and perfectly roasted pork. My friend had one of the pork options, the spicy tonkatsu tantanmen, of which our favorite is from Terakawa in NYC. Well, not anymore. AFURI outdid them. The pork broth is rich and deliciously spicy, and the meat is perfectly seasoned.

For someone who is sensitive to being burned, this was awesome. The braised pork belly was fantastic! The meat was tender and the fat melted in my mouth. The noodles were flat egg ramen noodles and reminded me of the (amazing) soba ramen I had in Japan. It wasn't as chewy as regular ramen noodles but they also seemed like they would be slightly slower in absorbing liquid and getting mushy.

Big statement, I know, especially from a pair who live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where the food is frequently amazing, and who have traveled far and wide. \\n\\nThe concept was a bit difficult at first. We order a few tapas plates and then a dim sum tray comes around with additional suggestions. So we ordered a glass of very good malbec and began.\\n\\nEvery single dish was flavorful, perfectly prepared, and a surprising combination of flavors. Every single dish. We are left this morning trying to think which dish was our favorite, but we can't say. \\n\\nThe waitstaff was well trained, the food came out at exactly the right time, and even though we were certain we weren't hungry for more, the dehydrated lemon meringue dessert sounded too interesting to pass up. It was the best dessert I've ever had.\\n\\nHigh praise indeed, I know, especially for an old gal who was here celebrating her 56th birthday. We want this restaurant transplanted to Santa Fe. \\n\\nIt was a bit pricey, we thought, at $160 for two people, however when we calculated that $48 of that was 4 glasses of wine, the quality of the dinner soon changed that opinion. \\n\\nLove Emmer & Rye.

I love bonchon and this is a nice in between regular wings and bonchon-deep fried once for a nice external crunch vs twice as Bonchon does it. The flavors were delicious and we finished off 10 wings in a matter of minutes. Definitely need to try this!\\n\\nFresh spring rolls-very fresh with tasty peanut sauce. I actually really enjoyed this as a light appetizer. The peanuts were freshly chopped and added a nice texture. \\n\\nPork Bun-were just okay. The buns were a little on the thick side and the pork inside was overpowered by the vinegar cucumber. I get that they're trying to add a little fresh crunch to the pork bun, but the vinegar content was too strong that we could not taste the pork. I think the problem with the cucumber is that it soaks up too much liquid. Perhaps try cabbage for crunch instead? \\n\\nSoup dumplings-the skin was perfect. Not too thin to break easily and not too thick to be doughy. However, the meat inside was on the dry side. We placed 3 orders because we love soup dumplings-one can out great with good soup content. Another completely deflated and was dry. The soup itself tasted like clear chicken broth, without too much flavor. Overall not terrible, but not stellar. Improvements can be made on the meat inside being more juicy and the soup flavor.\\n\\n\\nI'll def come back for the chicken wings and eager to try ramen next time...\\n\\nO and service was impeccable!

Above and behind the cashiers (yes, above and behind because this restaurant has the worst conceivable layout), workers were eating sour patch kids and gummy worms while still wearing their food prep gloves, sticking their hands in and around their mouths. I saw a few of the line preps scratching their hair and wiping their faces and then continuing to work on orders. The manager seemed to be incredibly overwhelmed, grabbing baskets of fries and mismatched orders to hand off to waiting customers. After my party had placed an order, they received their food in 10 to 15 minutes, while myself and my girlfriend waiting another 30 minutes. The next time I went to this establishment (reluctantly) I again saw miss managed employees doing whatever they wanted and waited again another 40 minutes for french fries. The third time I did not order but waited with friends for 40+ minutes for a few burgers and fries. This place is poorly conceived, managed and staffed.

When I first came to Orlando in the early 1980s there were several prestigious wine lists in town, like Chris' House of Beef. Today there are essentially zero. I end up sending visitors to Berns in Tampa.\\n\\nBut Wine Bar George is something completely different. It's actually most like the early days of Seasons 52 (before they dumbed down the list), when you could get any of a hundred or so very interesting wines on the list poured by the glass. Wine Bar George goes that one better, and lets you get any wine in any amount, down to an ounce. So you can build your own flights anyway you like.\\n\\nWe had a French and a California Chardonnay, and then a flight of Cabernet, Cab Franc (from South Africa) and Syrah. Two ounces is a perfect pour for wine flights as far as I'm concerned. Then we finished with an ounce of two high-end Dujac wines that I'm sure are not served by the glass anywhere else.\\n\\nThe cheese plate was a great accompaniment, and also included some delicious house marinated olives. Jicama and Kholrabi salad was a great palate cleanser, and then we finished with some Asian influenced chicken skewers.\\n\\nService was polished and our server Zach was very knowledgeable. We also chatted with server Chris, who recognized us from past wine dinners. The staff is extremely professional and enthusiastic.\\n\\nIn case you're wondering who George is, he's Master Sommelier George Miliotes, and the quality of wine bar George is no accident.

It had okay service, decent-to-pretty good food, very good beer, and a nice outdoor patio.  The patio, beer, and room for groups were pretty much the biggest draws.  Therefore, it was definitely a second choice for dinner last night when it was (1) freaking freezing (no patio), (2) I didn't want to drink much, and (3) I was out with my boyfriend and we only needed a table for two.  But alas, it was a freezing Saturday night and Emma's had closed early (their heat broke), so we hustled off to CBC, which we knew was close.\\n\\nOh. My. God.  It was like that scene in \\"She's All That\\" when Rachel Leigh Cook comes down the stairs before the big dance and she looks all hot and Freddie Prinze Jr. can't believe his eyes.  Just yesterday, I was still thinking of CBC as the nerdy art school girl with paint splatters.  However, last night, she emerged as a princess, and changed my image of her forever.  I think that the Cardigans' \\"Kiss Me\\" might have been playing in the background as we ate, but one can never be sure. \\n\\nWe decided to go out on a limb and order some fancier things than the traditional wings-and-nachos that we normally order here.  We started with the duck sausage appetizer (with lentils, chutney, grilled bread, mustard) and a pitcher of pumpkin beer, and they were both absolutely delicious.  We then split the AMAZING PUMPKIN RAVIOLI and a DELICIOUS ricotta-pesto-red pepper-sausage pizza before finishing with chocolate cake (very good, but nothing to wax on about) for dessert.  The total came to about 60 bucks. \\n\\nI'm giving four stars to Cambridge Brewing Company for the following reasons: very good beer, good for groups, kind service, extremely reasonable prices (I would even say under-priced), a nice range of options for when members of your party want completely different things, and unexpectedly delicious food if you stray off the beaten wings-nachos-burger path.

I also ordered a chicken roll (basically a big piece of naan stuffed with chicken and other deliciousness, sort of like a Greek gyro), and stupidly ate the entire thing over the course of the afternoon--I say stupidly, because it's not something I should be eating too much of in one day--you know, trying to lose weight and all.

The third thing I noticed was that the toppings are not your traditional poke bowl. It was very west coast down to the darker green and red colours of the meal. Red onions, beets, and kimchi toppings. Unique? I suppose, but very odd choices for a poke bowl. Lastly, the fish was just OK. It was sitting in too much sauce. In the end, I wasn't as impressed as I am with other poke spots around town and don't feel a need to come back to this one."},{"name":"Copious","address":"520 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I got the Shrimp and Andouille Skewers off their $5 Happy Hour menu.

Our party of 5 all took bites of it and agreed - it was very spicy. It was not listed in the description that it would be, so we asked for some alternatives for her; we were met with complete disrespect by our server. No refund, no substitution, and his suggestion of paying more for a different sauce to put on her spicy gravy soaked plate was absurd.

It has a modern flavor to the decor.\\n\\nThe menu looked extremely promising, but was a super let down. We started with the octopus which was way over cooked and chewed like rubber. There was an odd burnt flavor to it as well. I think they were trying to introduce smokiness into the food, but I'm guessing they are not using wood fire nor charcoal. Was it just over gas flames?\\n\\nThe risotto was actually pretty good. The rice was cooked nicely, and there was good flavor. The only thing to change was the giant chunks of garlic in the dish.\\n\\nI wanted to get the monkfish, but they were out. So the substitute was grouper which is a nice fish. However, mine was overcooked and tough. it also had the same weird burnt flavor as the octopus. The dish also had these giant beans which seemed very out of place. It was just a misplaced food texture when you eat fish, but then have giant, grainy beans. There were also artichokes, olives, and onions. Everything seemed like a separate component. No cohesion to the dish.\\n\\nWifey had the quail. The flavor profile was interesting. There were so many ingredients. It sort of worked. I think there was grapefruit in there, along with potatoes. The quail meat that was on the bone was cooked perfectly, but the other meat that was sliced was overcooked.\\n\\nAnd what hurts the most at this place is that it is overpriced. If the quality was spot on, they are still a tad too high. They need to reduce prices by around 10%.

The dip in quality outside peak hours seems due to a smaller customer base; a downfall that also seems to have precipitated skimpery on the guacamole and sour cream.

My water glass and wine glass were empty before the end of dinner and neither was refilled. All of this was disappointing for me.

I usually roll with the farm salad, but the cauliflower is a recent addition and I decided to try it. Think of a traditional caesar with the lettuce replaced my cauliflower. It was clean and fresh but lacked the juiciness of the farm salad, with its grapes and honey-shallot dressing. Sweet Cheeks only lightly marinades its meat, preferring the customer to choose their own sauces at the table. I typically go light on these additions, as the mound of pork has plenty of flavor already. The broccoli cheese casserole is consistently the star of the menu. One gets a blue cup of cheese souffle with soft broccoli florets scattered throughout. The body has a little salt and plenty of creaminess. Every time I come I toy with the idea of ordering only this. If ever I do, I won't be disappointed.\\n\\nSetting & Atmosphere: 4 stars\\nThe tables are pretty tightly packed which means the place is always buzzing. Sunday afternoon meant football on the TVs, so I chose to sit at the bar. The tables in the center of the restaurant are wrapped by bar-style seating at the perimeter windows, which allows as many people as possible to eat at once.\\n\\nDrink: 5 stars\\nSweet Cheeks has an extensive beer menu with plenty of local favorites at reasonable prices. I struggle to remember any other primarily food-serving establishment coming close to the quality and variety. I ordered - as I always do here - a Narragansett.\\n\\nService: 4-5 stars\\nI sat at the bar and received plenty of attention throughout my meal. The restaurant's strategy plays to its strengths, with the menu design allowing for food to be produced in bulk and served quickly.  The service here is always great, and I have plenty of examples of the staff going above and beyond.\\n\\nValue: 4 stars\\nMost of the trays fall in the $18-25 range, and provide great value for those looking for a hearty lunch. My only complaint is that prices appear to have jumped $2-3 since the last time I visited, and some of the portions seem to have shrunk a little.\\n\\nReturn: Yes\\nSweet Cheeks is my favorite restaurant in Boston.

Here's my two cents:\\n\\nTheir BBQ meals are delicious. I always start off with an order of biscuits. Careful though, they'll fill you up quick, so pace yourselves. Their portions are very generous, and you'll leave feeling satisfied for sure. I've had their pulled pork and fried chicken. Probably some of the best fried chicken I've had. Perfect amount of crisp and more chicken than bone, which is a plus. \\n\\nThey have a wide selection of drinks and the best part is that they come in mason jars. Mason jars somehow make everything better. \\n\\nTheir ramen was not so impressive. They switch it up every couple of weeks I believe, and I happened to come on vegetarian night (and I'm not a vegetarian). I thought I'd give it a try though, and sad to say, it was not very satisfying. I had heard about Monday night ramen for weeks now, and was really looking forward to it, but unfortunately there was too much hype over it and I was disappointed. It was flavorful, but not in the way that regular ramen dishes at other restaurants are. It's as if they mixed in some BBQ flavor and other sauces. They are a BBQ restaurant after all, but I think they should just stick to their BBQ. I would also have liked there to be more broth. The tofu and other vegetables soaked up all the broth, so towards the end, it just looked like a plain old noodle dish that you can get from any Asian restaurant. \\n\\nTheir service is excellent and the servers are all very knowledgeable and friendly. While you're waiting in line (for ramen), they make sure to accommodate you as best as possible -- they come out with mini appetizers of popcorn and shrimp chips and make sure that you always have a drink or water in hand. \\n\\nWill I be back? Yes, most definitely. Will I get $15 ramen and stand in line for more than an hour? Most definitely not."},{"name":"Pepe's Cantina","address":"5415 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"From winter park, downtown orlando, and now i-drive , best mexican food in central florida and that i have ever tried, strongly recomend the entr√©es, the staff is very friendly and out going.

I ordered the Hawaiian flavor boneless wings and fries.  First, as a newbie I questioned what the difference is between boneless wings and tenders. If I had to guess, the boneless wings are like giant popcorn chicken nuggets and I'm assuming the tenders are just that-a traditional larger tender. When you walk in, expect a laid back atmosphere. The staff are friendly and helpful if not completely professional in front of customers (personal cell phone use while helping customers and using a racial phrase). However, if you don't mind feeling like you're hanging out in someone's house, you'll be fine and again- the staff are super nice and helpful. The Hawaiian flavor boneless wings are amazing. Sticky and perfectly coated, chicken is tender and moist, slightly sweet and slightly Asian tasting.  Now, as wonderful as those are- the show stealer is absolutely the fries.  These fries are what every hormonal period-raging or pregnancy craving suffering woman wants and needs. They have somehow found a perfect balance of salty, sweet and a gentle kick of heat in their seasoning on the fries. The most delicious French fries I've ever had.

Being a special occasion, I had made the reservation 3 MONTHS in advance.  Since I was visiting from Denver and not familiar with downtown Boston it was challenging for me to organize a large group for dinner and was trying to make it as seamless as possible. Sean Bitar, the reservation manager assured me through our multiple phone conversations and emails that we were all set and everything would be as we discussed. \\n\\nFirst to start, we arrived at the restaurant to find that our party of 18 had been separated into two tables of 9, when we had clearly discussed being able to seat our entire party of 18 together and he promised that this was possible. When I made the reservation we had discussed a few areas in the restaurant that would work for a party as large as ours. Being a busy Saturday night, it was not easy to re-seat us at a table that would comfortably accommodate all of us. \\n\\nSecond, we had agreed on a $45 prix-fixe menu and Sean had emailed me about this just last week, specifically that we were able to choose 2 appetizers & 2 desserts that would be served family style and then we would have a selection of entrees for each person to choose from. We had communicated this information to everyone in our party who were expecting this and planned to pay accordingly. When we were seated we were given regular menus and there was no mention of our prix-fixe menus and when I asked the staff about it they knew nothing about this. They also did not know that I had discussed having separate checks for everyone (which also Sean said would be no problem and that they do this all the time), so clearly none of this information that we discussed and agreed upon had been communicated in the reservation notes for the staff that would be taking care of us. \\n\\nDespite all of this confusion with our reservation, I would like to say that the staff who helped us because Sean was not there to pick up the pieces of his mess was amazing. They could not have been more apologetic, understanding, or accommodating dealing with my frustration, which makes me wonder if this has happened before at Stephanie's. I know that they felt badly because they could see that I made the reservation 3 MONTHS in advance and that it was a special occasion. By the time they had us re-seated at another table, it was almost 9pm. We made the reservation for 8pm because we had plans starting later in the evening at 1030 pm, which should have given us plenty of time to have a nice meal and still make it to that next spot with plenty of time (which we did not). They brought us complimentary bottles of champagne and a few appetizers which was very generous but still did not make up for all that went wrong.\\n\\nFor a restaurant with a reputation for being popular, fun, and perfect for having a special occasion at, in my opinion Stephanie's completely failed. Despite the staff's many attempts to mollify my disappointment and frustration, I was not able to enjoy myself as I had planned to because I was constantly communicating with the staff and with my group as to what was going on since it was a complete 180 from what we had planned for. \\n\\nI hope that others can learn from my negative experience at Stephanie's that those planning a special occasion choose somewhere other than Stephanie's to dine at when in Boston. As Sean is the reservation manager for all of the Stephanie's restaurants in Boston, he will likely be the one coordinating any large party reservation, so please take note of that. Interestingly enough I sent him an email to voice my displeasure with how the reservation turned out and received no response."},{"name":"Waffle House","address":"2812 Buford Hwy NE","city":"Brookhaven","stars":"3","text":"As we all know, the entire State of Georgia is Waffle House country.

The food is not bad at all. It's actually good and I'd order again. I did order a delivery order 15 minutes before they closed. You're never gonna get the same quality food at 1:30am that you'd get at peak time so I was impressed. The steak taco left me wanting more. It's seasoned and grilled perfectly. The barbacoa taco is decent but I wouldn't get it again. They were presented as authentic and reminded me of getting tacos in Mexico. The burrito was also delicious. A little heavy on the sour cream but I do like sour cream so no complaint there. The chicken was delicious and tasted fresh. I had a chorizo torta and out of everything I got, that was the only thing that went unfinished. Maybe I'll try something other than the chorizo one next time. The filling to bread ratio was way off. On a sideways view, the top layer of the torta was like an inch bread and a 1/4 inch filling. I had pupusas as well and they were really good. The Salvadorian style coleslaw that goes with them was tasty and completed it. They have really good salsa verde. They should work on a better salsa roja, though. Every Mexican restaurant should a good salsa roja and I'm sorry to say- they failed miserably with that. Oh yeah- the chips and salsa is good, too!

At least five times in the past two years, we have had them lose a reservation (even after we've received email confirmations) or not have a table available within half an hour of the reservation's time. This time, however, it was our waitress who had a significant adverse impact on our meal. To say she was slow is an understatement. It was 15 minutes before we got water and 25 before we could order (even though our menus were closed and we eventually tried flagging our waitress down). The food came quickly, but then we were back to waiting. After awhile, the waitress offered to get us dessert menus, but she didn't get around to bring them for ten minutes. We placed our dessert order at 8:35 and asked the waitress to bring the check at the same time as the dessert since we were concerned about running late.

The sushi at Musashino is so fresh. I enjoy sitting at the sushi bar and asking the sushi ninjas for recommendations. I must say the spicy edamame is incredible, but watch out, that smoke flavor definitely creeps up on you and will make your mouth water. I tried uni for the first time and despite my adventurous food nature, this was just one dish I'm not likely to order again. The texture just was a little too weird for me.

I indicated that an hour is in fact a long time to wait when I had a reservation. I was told that everyone in the waiting area had a reservation to which I replied that that was their fault for taking too many reservations.

The amount of spread completely overwhelmed any other flavor in the sandwich rendering it mushy and unappealing. My friend got the Tempeh Burger, which was fantastic. It was tasty, great texture, and with a sophisticated variety of flavors (this earns Diesel a 2nd star). The \\"side salad\\" of the day (included with your $9 sandwich) was a complete and utter FAIL, pretty much a sham. I am not exaggerating one ounce when I say the \\"side salad\\" was THREE SLICES OF PICKLED CUCUMBER. That's it. I wish I had taken a photo (my friend got only 2 slices!). This is completely unacceptable because 1) its supposed to be a \\"side salad\\" (bordering on false advertising here) and 2) if it cost $9, I should get an entire head of lettuce and Caesar dressing made table side!\\n\\nI will not be going back.

Throughout our dinner the dining room filled up and there was a steady stream of take out orders called in and picked up.

Next time we'll order our regular faves to compare to area restaurants. Hubby decided on the Chicken florentine (pic), a large chicken breast smothered in a rich alfredo sauce with spinach and served over fettuccini. The sauce was very tasty, you could taste the fresh heavy cream and after adding some parmesan it was practically perfect. The chicken was a nice portion for a hungry diner and was cooked very nicely.  I ordered Eggplant parm (pic), which was served in a baking dish, with a side of spaghetti. The pasta was cooked well, I received a nice portion properly appointed with their flavorful marinara. The eggplant parm was zesty, not too cheesy and the eggplant was cooked well and not soggy. Very nice dish, of which hubby sampled quite a bit of and loved. Each of our entrees was served with a house salad and fresh baked bread, which was crusty and tasty nice when dipped into their oil and herb mixture. Service was great, we felt like we were regulars by the time the salads arrived. The dessert case was filled with many items from a local bakery that they bring in and tempted us throughout dinner.

I wish it were bigger or that they took reservations, because it's busy every time we go (because it's awesome) and when I'm in the mood for surf and turf I hate waiting! and 2. I wish it were less expensive. If it were I'd go here 10X as often.\\n\\nThe food it outstanding! They always get my filet exactly right (I like it rare, but not cold, so this is a big deal for me, someone who sends filets back about 45% of the time for not being exactly right). The sushi is outstanding- fresh, good portions, great presentation and delicious. The atmosphere is nice, and the only complaint I have about the interior, again, is that I wish it were bigger, not only so I could be seated faster but so that there could maybe be a little more space between tables. This is probably because we only come here on a special occasion (birthday or anniversary) because it's quite a bit out of our price range for regular dining, so when we do come we're usually in a romantic mood and would love a little more seclusion. However, the food makes it worth it regardless. They have a great drink list, the wait staff is excellent, and if you're sitting at the bar you'll be lucky enough to be able to chat with the sushi chefs, who have so far been across-the-board friendly (and sometimes even hilarious!). Not to mention entertaining to watch. I also love that, while the stand-out dishes are expensive (not unusually so, however- surf and turf for $35), the \\"regular\\" menu items (side of miso soup or edamame, straigh-up chicken teriyaki or tonkatsu) are priced like any hole-in-the-wall. So I love that I can order my $35 filet and lobster, and still get the miso for under $3.\\n\\nI also LOVE that upstairs is another entire restaurant (dim sum). I haven't eaten there (yet!! soon!!), but I've heard good things from the people who recommended the place to us.

If you can't carry all of these items, you can put them in the big yellow Ikea bag.\\n\\nStep 3 - wander the store looking for things you don't need, but look really cool. Ikea is really good for storage, stackable things and scented candles. \\n\\nStep 4 - find furniture that could potentially be very useful in your home, and then realize you didn't take measurements of anything in your house before you left, so you aren't sure if any of these things will fit. \\n\\nStep 5 - try to write down measurements of said furniture, but realize that one hand has an ice cream and the other has a big yellow Ikea bag. After unsuccessfully trying to balance your ice cream on a table, you are able to write down measurements, yes! Your ice cream is melting on the floor, no!\\n\\nStep 6 - Proceed to the checkout where you will either A. be purchasing things such as scented candles, and vases that you really didn't come to Ikea to buy, but caught your eye while you were there. Or B. have a big yellow bag that says Ikea on it filled with napkins, golf pencils, and measurements that you hope you will be able to decipher later. \\n\\nSome of the stuff at Ikea is good, but I find mostly, it lasts for one move and then it falls apart.

Visited the original Houston Little Sheep for the first time about eight years ago, and not much has changed since then at any of the Little Sheep locations. The one thing missing from this particular restaurant is the AYCE option, which I get 90% of the time.\\n\\nIf you've never had hot pot, don't plan any public activities for afterwards, and probably don't come for lunch. Your clothes, hair, everything will smell for the rest of the day. You'll even be able to smell yourself honestly. Anyways, we started off with the second combo option for two, which is $30, along with four lamb skewers and two sesame dipping sauces. I think it's been five years or more since I've had lamb skewers, but they're great here. Each one will cost you $1.75 and is a great way to start the meal while you're waiting for things to cook. I usually get the sesame sauce with hot pot as it's the lightest option. The sauce portions here are definitely smaller than usual, but they'll only cost you 50 cents each. I always get the half and half broth for the variety. After about 30 minutes, the spicy side will become extremely hot and oily as the spices and herbs inside cook, so watch out for that.\\n\\nThe combo comes with a sample of various seafoods, a large plate of meat, and a good deal of vegetables and miscellaneous for two people, at least. The meat goes by extremely fast though as it's sliced as thin as possible, so you'll probably want to order more. The lamb is their specialty here for obvious reasons, so we got an extra order of that. The combo, skewers, and everything else ended up costing about $45-$50, which is what you would pay for the AYCE option. We left extremely full after about an hour here. Austin literally does not have another good Chinese hot pot establishment, so if you've never tried it, this is the place to go. It's pretty much as social as a meal can get, and I'm sure you'll have a good time as long as you don't undercook your food.\\n\\nI see a few reviews mentioning the service here. The place is understaffed for sure, but service tonight was actually very good. We sat at the bar and were helped immediately. Someone came back to refill water and broth at least five times during the visit. Make sure you drink plenty of water, as it'll be a high sodium meal for sure. When you first get in, track down the manager, who is also the host, and insist he puts your name down right away on the waitlist. He carries the list around with him and literally is only at the front desk for a minute each five minutes. Anyways, the place is filled with Asian families, Asian college students, and just a LOT of Asians.

Call me simple, but it seemed like the menu was....lacking? in basic sushi/sashimi/maki choices. Then again, Gari is considered fusion, so I shouldn't be surprised to see all sorts of crazy elements in their sushi offerings.\\n\\nIn my quest to discover more of Brookline I will most likely be in here at some point, because their sushi is yummy, if albeit somewhat too artsy for this sushi n00b.\\n\\nUPDATE (10/13/07): Oh my god oh my god oh my god.

A friend of mine  (lets call him Ramen Master) was coming into town and I wanted to take him here. Granted, after picking him up from PDX, we were not going to arrive at Yuzu until after 11pm (they close at midnight), but I called to make reservations JUST IN CASE. I'm glad I did because with only two other customers inside the restaurant, it looked like they were aiming to close early.\\n\\nI had the kakuni ramen. The broth was very flavorful and surprisingly light, perfect for a late dinner. The Ramen Master had the soba noodles with tempura flakes. The broth was very simple, nothing fancy, yet very refreshing. It would be a perfect substitution for chicken noodle soup if you're not feeling well. I personally enjoyed my ramen and would definitely be coming back. But, most importantly, it was Ramen Master tested, Ramen Master approved. 4 stars!\\n\\nSo hypothetically speaking, if I were to move to the area for lets say a rigorous 3 year Doctor of Pharmacy program and stuck here for the next 2 years with no time for a part-time job, I would love to be a regular at Yuzu. Unfortunately, my funds do not allow me to do so. Furthermore, I am taking applications for a temporary sugar daddy (hypothetically speaking, of course). Please message me for qualifications and more details. =)"},{"name":"Noodlebox","address":"1867 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"We have been going to this location and the one on Main Street for the last couple of years. It was good for a while but found the portion size a composition of ingredients for our usual order can be wildly inconsistent between the noodle, vegetable and sauce quotient.   We have experienced at both locations where they made the mistake of putting our dine in orders in take out containers. First time at the Main St, it is apparent you only get 2/3 of a dine in portion when they pour the contents from the take out box into a bowl.. 2nd time at the 4th Ave location, they said they'd put it in bowls and I said to make sure it's the same amount of the dine in amount. The server said it's absolutely the same amount but we had a hard time believing it. If the take out portion poured into a bowl is the same as dine in, why did it take 10 minutes to get it? Perhaps to add more ingredients and it came to us barely warm."},{"name":"Little Big Burger","address":"1630 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Best burger I've had in Austin HANDS DOWN! \\nJay is an amazing grillmaster!

Guys. Please. We need more spots like this and the decor/layout/vibe of the place is great!! WHY are you ruining it with a complete crash&burn on the food and drinks?! The place has an industrial-chic vibe that a lot of places in the city have - absolutely nothing about this place says \\"Tiki,\\" and yet most of the drink menu is comprised of tiki-style drinks? They've got a whole section dedicated to whiskeys, they have Plantation Pineapple and several other esoteric spirits on there, but I wasn't feeling what I saw and asked if they could make me a negroni and A) the waitress had no idea what it was and needed me to spell it for her (both Negroni and Campari), and B) she came back and told me they didn't carry Campari. oh?? Fine, I ordered a tequila drink that was supposed to be tequila, fresh lime, mint and seltzer, and i got a cloyingly sweet mojito tasting drink that had no carbonation at all. I'm a drinker and i'll always figure something out for the sake of dranks, but I stopped at that one. The food is awful. temperature, flavor, composition, everything is lowest possible common denominator. My boyfriend's steak tips were cold and the whole plate looked sad and unappetizing. My chicken sandwich looked decent enough but was tough and tasteless. the chicken was tasteless, the coleslaw was tasteless, the pickles were tasteless, the bun was so charred it was inedible, these tots that were supposed to be so amazing per another reviewer were another casualty of this weird trend where people make the tots huge, robbing them of all the characteristics that make tots great - they were just hashbrown houses of cards. At least Ester tried, and didn't bend me over and stick it to me with a $17 \\"meat and cheese board\\" full of sweaty lukewarm sausage and RITZ crackers. I liked it better when it was called The 99 Humming Cold Popcorn at You for Free. Yellow Door is down the street and Lower Mills Tavern is basically right next door, and lightyears better than this place, which is a real shame; I'd love to bring people and hang but I'd be too embarrassed to have anyone actually taste anything.

OK, so I have another complaint and it's not the restaurant's fault: this is a very adult-feeling spot. Clean, white space with food that isn't really kid-friendly. Yet, there were kids running EVERYWHERE! I heard kids begging to go play outside, which was weird as there is no outside space to play in. The running back and forth that I mentioned before is very inappropriate in a restaurant, yet not one parent seemed to notice their kids behaving ridiculously.

The cheese was a little too runny and there wasn't enough flavor for me. My friend got the pulled pork tray with watermelon salad and mac and cheese. He thought the pork was delicious and the watermelon salad with feta and mint leaves was refreshingly light and balanced out the heaviness of the rest of the meal. The pickles on the side were very tasty as well! \\n\\nThe most amazing thing about this place is the biscuits! I would come again just to order a basket of biscuits. It was perfectly light and fluffy on the inside with a golden crispy outer layer. The honey butter that comes with the biscuits was to die for!
