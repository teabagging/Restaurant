I went on a Friday around 1pm and the tables were about 2/3 full.  I went solo so I was only able to try two things - the XLB (of course) and the 7-spice popcorn chicken.\\n\\nFirst, the XLB.  These are clearly the specialty of the restaurant (given the name).  They were just okay.  I thought they were kind of bland and the dough wasn't the consistency that I was used to.  I think it was a bit too thick.  Somehow despite the thickness, the dumplings also broke easily.  I've eaten at Din Tai Fung several times in Asia and of course, that's the comparison given that DTF sets the worldwide standard in my opinion.  I've also eaten at some of the more traditional dumpling houses in SF and NY.  I thought the ones at XLB were clearly inferior in terms of taste and texture.  Doesn't mean they were bad, in fact they are good by Portland standards.  But if you are used to having XLB at Din Tai Fung or in other larger cities, these may be disappointing.\\n\\nThe 7-spice popcorn chicken was my favorite of the two items that I tried.  It was a bit dry (as it didn't come with any sauce), but was very flavorful, especially when paired with the lemon and Thai basil that came with it.  It was similar to Karaage in taste, but I liked it even better.  The flavor was great.  Also, a good portion size.\\n\\nAs others mention, the restaurant is counter service.  I'm usually fine with this when dining solo or as a couple, but don't care for it when in a group.  I definitely don't tip the usual amount for counter service though, so I guess it makes it nice to save a couple bucks!"},{"name":"Bistro Verde","address":"799 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped by The Cafe in Nordstrom on a weekday.

My expectations were high even before I walked through the door.  This place is hard to find unless you watch for the signs on the side of the road.  This dining experience was different even before I left the car.  To get in the restaurant you drive up to the loading dock of an old warehouse and drop the car off with a valet.  I loved the soaring ceilings of the restaurant, but even better were the rows upon rows of gas lamps on the wall.  Their website plays up the central circular fireplace and wine barrel wall, but I barely even noticed them compared to everything else that was going on.\\n\\nLuckily our table was all the way at the back of the restaurant and had a fantastic view of Midtown Atlanta.  We could see tables and chairs outside which must make for a great drinks locale during warmer weather.\\n\\nThe food was delicious- every dish we ordered really wowed my taste buds.  The service was more standard but was still very good, and shouldn't be construed as a criticism of this place.  The wine list is special as well because Two Urban Licks takes it straight from the barrel, allowing you to sample wines in many more amounts than the traditional glass or bottle.\\n\\nFor all of this one would expect to pay dearly, and it certainly isn't a once a week joint.  It isn't quite as stratospheric in cost as Sun Dial though, and I felt like I got my money's worth.\\n\\nSorry this review sounds like a commercial for the place, but I can definitely say this is my favorite restaurant in Atlanta and I will definitely be coming back!"},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Decent slice of pie.

The restaurant is very spacious but it uses every inch so space.  A ton of seat bar style near the bar and across from it looking into the dining area.  They also have a classic pink Cadillac in a garage size room which is visible to the diners!  So cool!  The service was very good although the guy at the bar had a hard time remembering orders.  He had to ask us a couple of times to repeat our order.  If you have issues with memory, I think it's a good idea to write it down.  It doesn't look good to customers if you don't care to write orders down and have them repeat it multiple times because you're too lazy to do so.  Anyway my friend and I ordered the Fleetwood's Denver Omelet and I ordered the Mixed Grill Omelet.  The Fleetwood's Denver Omelet comes with grilled ham, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, scallions, and blended cheeses.  It comes with your choice of bread and house potatoes.  This was a great healthy option for breakfast.  These omelets are big so don't order too much.  The Mixed Grill Omelet comes with grilled bacon, chicken apple sausage, smokey ham, saut√©ed mushrooms,  caramelized onions and mixed cheeses.  This is a great omelet for meat lovers.  They pack in a lot of meat but they don't over do it.  It came with a nice balance of meats and fillings to egg.  I had mine with sourdough toast which was okay.  I wish they made their own jam like many breakfast places around town.  The made those pre-made jam that you can by at the stores that they serve.  You can choose from 3 flavors: grape, raspberry and strawberry. We were a little squished at the bar but we had a nice breakfast the the price was reasonable.  Service was prompt despite being very busy and we had no problems getting a seat in this large restaurant.\\n\\nOverall, I had a positive experience and I would recommend giving this cafe a try.  It's not the best, but I think the food is worth the money charged.  Parking wasn't too difficult but you do have to park in the street.

Our party of 6 mostly ordered the filet minion. I had the salmon. My dish was cooked perfectly and the diced beets paired well without being overpowering. I normally do not like beets, but cut up small and eaten along with the salmon, I are every bite. Some of the filets were not cooked exactly to order, but no one complained that much to send it back to be cooked more. Soon after dinner a complementary dessert of chocolate truffles arrived with a candle for us to sing. When we ordered dessert a little while later, the waitstaff brought another desert with a candle. We didn't sing twice though, but I guess turning 30 warrants 2 \\"birthday cakes\\". My mother-in-law thought her spice cake was bland and the waiter took it off the bill.

After a long layoff from writing yelp reviews I decided that 2017 was the year I was finally going to try to obtain elite status so I'm posting my first review of 2017. \\n\\nIsland Creek Oyster Bar in Kenmore/Fenway has been a long time favorite of mine as the food has always been spot on, service has always been consistent and the ambiance is good. Being out here in the suburbs it's a bit of a drive to get into Boston, so when I found out that a location opened in Burlington I was ecstatic. It had been a while since I had to gone Island Creek Oyster Bar so I thought it was time to reacquaint myself with an old favorite.\\n\\nThis meal was going to be the last meal of 2016 as I got a table for 2 at 8pm on New Years Eve. We were seated right away as the restaurant didn't seem busy at all - especially for NYE. The menu had a very familiar feel including signature dishes such as the lobster roe noodles etc. We decided to order some oysters, the clam chowder, the colorado angus burger with the fried oyster, and the grilled maine salmon. I've ordered the burger in the past and loved it so I thought I'd get it again. Little did I know that my love for Island Creek Oyster Bar would come to an abrupt halt.\\n\\nAt just about every restaurant that serves bread, you are provided a bread basket almost automatically from the moment you're seated to a little after you've ordered. Our bread just never came. We sat around wondering why everyone else's table had bread, but ours. The oysters came not too long after as well as the clam chowder. The oysters are semi pricey at $3-$5 but when you've eaten at ICOB before it's expected. They also do a good job with the chowder - contains bacon in it. While eating the chowder, I flagged down a waiter to ask for bread. No big deal, I figured since this place was new and still gathering its bearings. We were both waiting for our entrees and figured that since it wasn't very busy the burger and salmon would come out soon. Boy we were wrong. After a 40 minute wait our entrees still had not come out and I had to flag down our waitress to inquire about our food. She said she would check on it and came back to say that it would be out soon. 10 minutes later the food was out, but the wait in between had ruined our appetite. The burger that I loved in the past was now bland - not seasoned well and dry. The salmon had a fishy flavor to it - meaning it was either not fresh or it was overcooked. After a few bites of the salmon, we did the unthinkable and had to send it back. This was the first time I've ever sent anything back and I certainly wouldn't have expected it to happen at Island Creek Oyster Bar. We were given back a menu to see if there was anything else we would like to order to replace the salmon, but by then we had lost our appetite. We paid for our meal - minus the salmon, tipped our waitress, and left disappointed.\\n\\nI'll admit that over the past few years I hadn't gone to Island Creek Oyster Bar much because I finally went to Neptune Oyster and loved everything about it (except the wait). Both places have a very similar price point, but after this experience at Island Creek makes me feel like Neptune is leaps and bounds ahead. Even though it carries the Island Creek Oyster Bar name, I'd avoid coming to this one at all costs."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Caipirinha = a spicy kick-in-the-pants for a cocktail.

I'm hooked to this place so much that I go here even on a warm weather day.\\n\\nThe wait is not too bad but we just end up going to the Grafton pub next door for a drink. They text you when the table is ready so that's convenient. The service is usually fast.

The dessert we ordered - coconut rice pudding tastes nice with d melon but then a little confusing with this 'fusion' of pickled veg, which makes it a neither here nor there, whereby I can't say I hate it nor i like it kinda thing?!\\n\\nSince this was our date night, i wanted us to go to a place that not only has good cocktails/service, but also served great food as well. \\n\\nSomehow, this place fell short on the food aspect.

A margherita pie is a test and it SHOULD be good because you can't hide behind heavier toppings. If a place's margherita sucks, it's not a good pizza place.

I ordered the sp√§tzle $5, german pretzel $6, frites $5. The honey ordered the platter of 3 sausages $16 (hausgemachte wurst) and a side of german potato salad. Sp√§tzle was delicious with no bacon. Being pescatarian I loved that as most sp√§tzle has bacon in it, whereby even I make that way. The pasta pieces were longer than usual, but delicious. Some places over cheese theirs. No cheese here. They also give you a huge bowl that the 3 of us shared. The frites were crispy and came with homemade ketchup. Pretzle was soft and pliable and came w 2 sauces: one really just tasted like oil, so I passed on that. The hon loved the homemade sausages and potato salad.

If you know my family, you'd genuinely appreciate the patience of the staff and how attentive they were to our needs.  The hostess, Rosetta,  proved to be a ray of sunshine and was instrumental in orchestrating our seating and prompt service. \\n\\nNow, on to the food!   I didn't quite know what to expect, as I'd not previewed the menu in advance of my visit.   I was very pleasantly surprised, and, as with most things I like, I had to go back for a second dose the next day.  \\n\\nFor me the sweet potato + bacon waffles with fried chicken were the star of the show.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and crispy while the fresh bacon bits provided a hint of the savory without overtaking the dish.  The sweet potato waffle with whipped marscapone was pure delight...perfectly sweet (but not too much).  I also had  fried green tomatoes with a mustard sauce that made me believe I'd died and gone to heaven.  Exceptionally delicious and a true treat, as I am not able to find this on many menus in the North.  (My only gripe is that when I visited on Saturday, the restaurant included 3 tomatoes in the serving...the next day only two were provided.  Let's try to keep this consistent so their isn't an uprising.  I almost slayed the messenger.  Poor server would've never seen it coming).\\n\\nAs for the beignets, they were ok -- a little too sweet for my taste, but certainly worthwhile as a little bite for the table to share.  Also, as a former resident of New Orleans, I have to honestly say that what they call beignets are not beignets at all.  They are more like warm home-made glazed donuts pieces  with a variety of dipping sauces.  While good, the name assigned to this dish could be misleading to patrons.\\n\\nAdditionally, as an added bonus, the $3 mimosas were affordable and delish.  While they could be slightly stronger, they were still good, and we kept 'em coming all day long.  I highly recommend Poor Calvin's to Atlanta visitors (and folks that live there...very surprised that more residents haven't unearthed this gem)\\n\\nIn order to ensure a great experience, here are a few watch outs:\\n\\nLike many of the places I visited in Atlanta, this restaurant was kinda in the middle of nowhere.  If you're visiting, take a taxi or drive.  The area isn't ideal for walking.  \\n\\nMake reservations!!!  The place isn't large and fills up quickly, particularly on weekends. (And be nice to the hostess.  She is the guardian of the seats.)\\n\\nOrder your appetizers and entrees at the same time if you have a large party so that you aren't waiting a long time for your main dish.  While Poor Calvin's is doing a good job, they still have a few kinks to work out when it comes to getting food out on time when they are busy.\\n\\nEnjoy every  bite!!!"},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Best for their meats, which are done in a huge rotisserie in the center of the room, the location is amazing.

My girlfriend and I ordered their sangria and guava margarita and it was very flavorful and came out with fruit on the rim. My only complaint would be that I wasn't a big fan of the crab fries. The presentation was nice, but I didn't like the sauce that came on it and I didn't like that they didn't have ketchup. My girlfriends had their Beignets and said it was very good.

To start of, the front desk was very rude, and impersonal. She started off by asking if we had a reservation, our mistake that we have not reserved. But it was only for a party of two. Please include that it was probably 1:00pm in the afternoon. She let out a huff and said hold on we'll seat you in a bit. No greeting, no Hi welcome. She then saw that we had our coffee which I might add was recently bought at starbucks. I understand that some restaurants you can not have them. But I only took a few sips out of my coffee.

Upstairs is where the kitchen, bar, and live music is going on along with a lovely warm fireplace (perfect after a long cold rainy day--typical Portland day).  The ceviche is made of catch-of-the-day fish. Mine was fresh ono and it did not disappoint.  It was as good if not better than the ceviche at El Pollo Inka (Hermosa Beach location)--perfect mix of red onions, ono, sweet potato, and corn. The hongos saltados was delicious! Wild, locally grown mushrooms replaced the typical beef bits in the traditional loma saltado dish but the taste was still there. In fact, it didn't look any different since the Puerto Rican lady next to me commented that I ordered the same thing as her (though I didn't) loma saltado. Hongos saltado y ceviche paired with the Apollini Pinot Blanc from Willamette Valley was perfectly refreshing and light.  The final course was Peruvian truffle made of dark chocolate infused with anise and a glass of Tannahill's Gew√ºrztraminer, also from the Willamette Valley. Can you guess?

We had had four tacos (Al pastor, papas con chorizo, conchinita pibil, asada), an asada tostada, and the pozole. Everything was so good I kept getting up to get more Lol. We also had the horchata and passion fruit fresca. My favorite was the al pastor, it's marinated pork with pineapple chunks I added onion, cilantro and a salsa from the toppings bar, AMAZING! I could've mowed thru 5 of those no doubt but i wanted to try everything. The chorchata was VERY tastey I preferred it jus a lil more than the passion fruit however it was good too.

He is a foodie and he enjoyed a lunch we had here previously. Grandma was treating. \\n\\nWe had a total of 3 adults and 3 kids (1 of them being only 3 yrs old). We ordered 2 of the chilled seafood share platter. The waitress confirmed I wanted 2. I replied yes as the menu in front of me says \\"$44.95 per person, Minimum 2 people.\\" We also ordered a dozen oysters, a crab sandwich, 2 orders of kids pasta, 1 glass of wine, and 1 pint of beer. \\n\\nI never got the seafood tower before. The seafood was very fresh. I was a bit disappointed that the waitress didn't tell me there were already many oysters in the platter and I had ordered a dozen more. \\n\\nNOW comes the PROBLEM. I got the bill. It came to $284.53. I was surprised to see:\\n2 seafood tower\\n2 @ $89.90 = $179.80 \\nI spent $179.80 on 2 seafood platters. I called the waitress over and asked her why isn't it $44.95 as per the menu. She said \\"I double checked with you that you wanted 2 orders. You said yes.\\" I told her I wanted 2 orders as it says minimum 2 people and each order is $44.95. She proceeded to tell me that each \\"order\\" is good for 2 people. Hence, the \\"customer's\\" idea of an order as per the physical menu is $44.95 and it is good for 1 person. However, the \\"restaurant's\\" idea of an order (which is not disclosed to the customer in writing on the menu or verbally via the service staff at ordering) is $89.90 and is good for 2 people. Hence, I ordered 4 people worth of food for the platter PLUS the food I already ordered on top. Aren't there ANY red flags why a party of 3 adults and 3 kids would order SO MUCH FOOD???\\n\\nThe waitress' reply to me was that she didn't want to question my answer of \\"yes\\" to 2 orders (which I obviously didn't know was for 2 x 2 people) as she said some customers don't like being questioned. She also said she purposely \\"asked\\" and confirmed the order because previous customers had also had this problem!!! I was livid! Why didn't they change the menu wording then? Or explain verbally that each order is actually good for 2 people and cost $89.90 per order. Are they purposely trying to scam customers since I was not the first patron to have a problem with this? I then asked for the manager and she said there was no manager (it was a busy Saturday night!!!!). \\n\\nI felt I was literally cornered to pay the bill. And the worst of it was grandma was treating. It was good she took the kids out to get frozen yogurt as they became impatient and I paid the bill first (which I never asked her for money back as the whole thing was so embarrassing). The ONLY help the waitress offered me was to write a comment card because the owner reads it. \\n\\nI was so mad and disappointed in my experience at this restaurant. I live near the restaurant and believe in supporting local. However, this is the way they treat those who live near. What is going to happen to their business in the cooler months when all the tourist leave?\\n\\nI gave the restaurant another chance to explain or provide a satisfactory response before I posted any online reviews. I explained I was a local and believe in supporting local business. I told them I wanted to give them a chance to respond before posting a review. I left a comment card and sent a facebook private message to the owner. I even took screen shots of my bill and the menu online (which to this day still says $44.95 per person, minimum 2 people). I have NOT received any reply to this day. Our restaurant visit was on June 4.\\n\\nI would say this was a lesson of \\"buyer beware\\" and I will not set foot back into this restaurant."},{"name":"The Bancroft","address":"15 Third Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"Okay, you need to take my review with a grain of salt, as I wasn't paying for the meal I had there.  In fact, my whole group had a business meeting one late afternoon.  We had a choice of 2 appetizers (clam chowder or salad), 3 entrees (salmon, burger or roast chicken) and 2 desserts (panna cotta or chocolate moussey thing).  \\n\\nSo, because I wasn't paying, I gave this 4 stars.  If I were paying off the menu, I'd probably give it 3 stars, just because I find things ridiculously priced for the suburbs.  Just because you WANT this to be Boston proper or NYC, it's not, and I won't be back on my own. \\n\\nHaving said that, let's get to the details. \\n\\nWe were seated in the back conference room.  Very lovely decor, though we were seated at round tables, which is difficult to conduct business at...a horseshoe set up would have been better, but I don't think they want \\"hotel corporate\\" as much as hipster elegance.  Service was attentive...almost too much.  Do I really need one guy for my water glasses, one guy with the bread basket, and then the waiter himself?  All this must factor into the cost of things.  Anyway, I digress...\\n\\nI had the clam chowder.  Very good flavor and pretty good heftiness.  Not a ton of clams, but the flavor was outstanding.  Warm rolls and adorable individual butter cups were enjoyable.  One colleague had the salad, which was HUGE...though it had some hipster garnishes (funky radishes) which were visually appealing (but still tasted bitter, like a radish!).  \\n\\nEveryone at my table had the salmon, which was supposed to come with Jasmine rice...and oddly, none of us wanted THAT, so we asked if they'd switch out the rice for the mashed potatoes slated to come with the chicken entree.  They agreed.  The veggie was a nicely sauteed green bean, seasoned with garlic.  The garnish was some micro greens.  We were all very pleased with the salmon (cooked med. rare) and the sides.  Dessert for me was the panna cotta with grapefruit segment and spiced compote...I'm Italian and I think panna cotta should be more like a creme brulee...more custardy and rich...however, this panna cotta had the consistency of gelatin...slightly off putting for my palate.  The vanilla flavor was subtle and I would have liked it to be more pronounced.  The compote didn't seem to go with the delicate panna cotta.  It was more like a whole-berry cranberry sauce that would accompany turkey or duck, not a dessert.  Those who chose the chocolately thing seemed pleased, though they commented on the richness of the dessert.  \\n\\nBy the time we left (after 5:30 PM--this was a late luncheon meeting), the dining room started filling up, though not so much for a Monday night.  The bar was more crowded and seemed to cater to same-sex couples.  Decor is beautiful and the restroom was more swanky than most!"},{"name":"Perfectos Caffe","address":"1900 Main St","city":"Tewksbury","stars":"4.5","text":"Great coffee and pastries.

Reason being, not so long ago this restaurant was called G'vanni's and while my first meal there was outstanding, each subsequent time I went there, the food and service got worse.  So, upon writing off the restaurant, I was looking forward to trying the new restaurant that was moving in.  That is until I saw the name: G'Seppe's.  Hmmm.  Awfully similar to the prior name (it even had a similar sign).  Made me suspect that it was the same owners and I refused to go in there and try the \\"new\\" restaurant.\\n\\nNot too long after G'Seppe's opened, it appeared to close down and reopen as Peppercorns.  I didn't think that it was the same owners as G'Seppe's, but frankly I was interested in trying another meal in that building.  Aside from the names I mentioned above, I think it's been about 3 or 4 other restaurants in the past 5 years  Clearly the building has bad luck.\\n\\nAnyway, it wasn't until my mother ate there and gave it a positive review (she loved the clam chowder) and also was told by the waitress that it was a different owner than G'Seppe's that my family decided to give it a shot.\\n\\nNeedless to say, it was pretty bad.  Might have been the worst food I have ever had at a restaurant.  I started off with chili and it was ok enough.  Not great, but better than I've had at some other restaurants (not nearly as good as mine *wink*).  We also had some bread and the pieces were too small, plus there was an odd number of slices (5) -- always a pet peeve of mine at a restaurant.  The butter was homemade with honey and was very good.  Unfortunately, it was cold and hard which made it difficult to spread.  My daughter got a salad which she seemed to enjoy and it looked very fresh.\\n\\nAs for the main meal...this is where the trouble starts.  I got pasta with their \\"Epic\\" meatballs.  I asked for ziti and received spaghetti, that was the first bummer.  Also, the pasta was slightly on the mushy side.  The sauce wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about.  And the meatballs...ok, they were epic in size, but that's about it.  Beyond that, they were without a doubt, just plain awful and barely edible.  The consistency was bizarre.  They weren't soft and mushy as they should be, instead they were hard and heavy.  Wasn't easy to get my fork in there.  They appeared to be previously frozen and not fresh.  The taste...sigh...I can't describe it.  Maybe like a pork chop without seasoning.  I really don't know.  They were pretty bad.  I couldn't even force myself to eat them.  My wife felt the same way when she tried a bite.  \\n\\nRegarding my wife's meal, she got a seafood fettucini dish.  Overall she said it was just ok and thought the shrimp may have been boiled which gave them a less than desirable consistency.  \\n\\nMy daughter ordered the kids chicken parm meal.  Oddly enough, it came without pasta.  Strange.  Still, she said it was ok.\\n\\nWe decided to give desert a shot and ordered cannoli's.  I for one am not a huge cannoli fan, but my wife loves them and has plenty of cannoli's in her day.  I took the first bite and that was it for me.  It was bitter.  Almost as if the ricotta had gone bad (but I doubt that was the case).  They weren't sweet at all.   It was pretty bad.  She also agreed and could not eat them.  We thought that maybe these were true Italian cannoli's and the other's we'd had in the past weren't really how cannoli's were supposed to be made, but we dispelled that quickly when we recalled having cannoli's in the North End and those tasted nothing like what we had at Peppercorns.   Also, the shell was very hard and not crisp and flaky.\\n\\nOne other negative was the ambience.  They had a news station playing on the TV  in the dining room.  That alone was odd, but it would have been nice to hear some music at the very least.  If not for the TV, the place was too quite and awkward as the staff out numbered the patrons (I should mention I this was not a weekend).\\n\\nOn a good note, our waitress was awesome.  Very friendly and eager to please.  Also, you could tell that the other staff members were upbeat and friendly.  There seemed to be a good vibe among the staff overall.  This makes me think that the owner's heart is in the right place.

Those free popovers almost stole the night for me they were so good. \\n\\nWe could have stopped there.Honestly. But we didn't want to - so we split the pork chop with grilled peaches and the corn. The pork chop was heavenly. Already sliced and with a savory sauce offset by the sweet peaches. The corn was good too but perhaps a bit predictable in that elote kind of way.

They set out bread and olive oil with olives on the table. We had a great Riesling wine. For appetizer we had the fried calamari and the friend cornmeal balls that were stuffed with veggies and meat. Both our appetizers were sooo good. The calamari wasn't chewy at all. I ordered a seafood and pasta dish with spicy red sauce. Two of my friends ordered the lobster ravioli and two other ordered the fish (haddock, i believe). Oh Man, everything was delicious. It almost tasted like someone was out back making everything from scratch. The flavors where honest and unpretentious. I think the best part of the meal, was the price!

It's a little heartbreaking to give this review but I want the Magers to know they are making the right decision to close. My family has always loved this restaurant. We've been coming here since we were kids for birthdays and special events. Tonight we brought our family, my sister's family and my mom (party of 9). After waiting over an hour for a table at Rheinlander, we were told our table in Gustavs was ready (tho we requested Rheinlander) and \\"there's only one wait list\\" by the hostess rudely.  Unsure what that was supposed to prove but it was the inciting point on my hangry after sitting with four kids for 78 minutes only to be told the restaurant we were here for wasn't available.  The manager came out next and told us Der Rheinlander was fully booked with reservations, tho we'd asked specifically for seats there, and apologized for the hostess' mistake.  It was very clear they didn't care - we sat and watched empty tables sitting unbussed for over 40 minutes in Rheinlander while four young ladies chatted casually as hostesses.  We sat right in front of them and watched other groups come and go but they never checked in. Not sure if staff has short timers syndrome because they're closing soon, but this is one loyal family who was looking to say goodbye and patronize this Portland landmark one last time before you close at year end.  Now our last memory is this terrible experience. We hate to be \\"that family\\" but even the most mild mannered among us was loudly complaining on the way out.  \\n\\nI often go to Gustav's for happy hour with the girls from work but I think we'll go to Laurelhurst Pub instead.

There's pretty good signage, so once you notice the place you should only need another minute or two (if you're like me and you suck at common sense things) to find the stairwell that takes to you Tsunami Sushi. It's well worth the effort- trust me. There is also a fabulous patio that's perfect for afternoon sake with a view of the shopping crowd.\\n\\nTsunami Sushi is very much like most other sushi restaurants- not particularly original in its d√©cor (in fact a bit retro), rather quiet, and there are people in Kimonos; however, there is one differing factor. There is a creek in the centre of the restaurant that circulates little wooden boats full of sushi and other Japanese items. You can basically saddle up to the bar, and in front of you sushi will just float by. You can pick up whatever you like and the boat will float away empty until it is refilled by one of the several staff who work in the centre of the circuit. The plates on which the sushi arrives are color-coded (i.e. blue plates are $2.00, black $3.50, etc.) and you simply tally up the number of plates you have to figure out the bill at the end. This, in my opinion, is just so cool. There's no other word for it.\\n\\nThe novelty of this creek will wear off as you eye a plate of tekka maki slowly making its way down the line while shooting daggers at the hungry dude two seats down. There is, however, no denying the empowerment one feels when getting to see a product before ordering it and then receiving it instantly. You can't assign a value to instant gratification like this.\\n\\nThe sushi here is pretty awesome too, and there are a number of selections that you will not find as easily at other more standard sushi places- sea urchin maki among them. Just make sure to arrive around a normal mealtime, as the creek floats fewer rolls at three in the afternoon. There's no reason you can't proceed with ordering as you would normally though. Also, keep track of your plates. It's easy to eat and eat and eat, and then realize your plate stack is $10.00 more than you thought."},{"name":"The Whip Restaurant Gallery","address":"209 6th Avenue E","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I adore their beef dip!

We ordered a large pepperoni. The pizza reminded me of Papa John's which, to me, is not a good thing. The crust when hot was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside but as it cooled it quickly became rubbery. The pizza overall was extremely salty. The cheese was overloaded on the pizza. It was too salty yet flavorless. The pepperoni were a far cry from the high quality pepperoni I've come to expect from better quality pizzas. I don't even know what the tomato sauce tasted like because the mountain of cheese overpowered any other flavor. The main thing that put me off from the start was how greasy the pizza was when it came to the table. There's good greasy and then there's just dripping in cheap grease from bad ingredients greasy. This was the latter. I've made pizza at home using high quality cheese and pepperoni from Central Market and obviously those ingredients release some grease onto the pizza surface but not to the point where it's pooling on your plate... I used about 10 napkins to pat off some of the grease and after that the pizza REALLY lost any flavor.

I told him I would be right back, I needed to use the rest room. When I returned a very short(we're taking 2-3 minutes) time, He was making a latte, so I presumed(big mistake) that it was mine. Then he started another drink, and I realized that he had waited on this cute little thing sitting at the bar, and was filling her to-go order for several beverages. \\n After 10 minutes, he completed her order, bantered with her about some inside joke, and, offering no explanation, began to make mine. When he so proudly presented me with his barista art leaf on top( barista art has become so annoying) latte, and said that will be $3.95, or whatever the price was. As he took my card, he said, \\"Sorry about the wait.\\" Rather than dump several visits worth of frustration on him, I just said, \\"That seems to happen every time I come here.\\" He launched into a rap about the difficulty of switching over from breakfast to lunch, and yadda, yadda, yadda, all the while assuming I was too stupid to realize what had transpired.\\n And there, Frank, is the total sum of your service difficulties, so often mentioned here. You continue to hire from a very narrow labor pool, putting appearance and hipness in front of experience and willingness to serve. Thusly, you have shrunk your core market to the same demographic you hire from, and if your'e not hipster enough to warrant their approval, you just get lousy, inattentive service. \\n I ran successful restaurants for years, and it didn't take me very long to realize that hiring eye candy does little to promote the long term well being of the business. I know you care about your place, I have read your answers to complaints here quite often. It is my opinion that you are shooting yourself in the foot over and over again by your hiring policies. I doubt you will accept this theory, it has reared its ugly head often in these reviews, but I am just one more person that will deny patronage because of this arrogant culture that permeates your staff.

Come Saturday or Sunday and expect to find lines of hungry Portlanders standing outside some delicious-smelling hubs. \\n\\nOn the cozy Southeast side of Portland I didn't find a line dripping out of Broder's door. Nor did I find irritated, hungry Portlanders griping about the wait. Surprisingly (and I do mean surprisingly, because this is definitely a staple brunch spot in Portland) there was no wait to get into Broder. (That could have been because I was about an hour late) Yet, the dining room was filled to the limit. Breakfast-fans were even sliding into the Ikea-like stools at the bar to get their meal. \\n\\nFortunately, once we were seated I began to notice the decor: Ikea-meets-cozy diner. You know this place has some heavy Swedish influences, from the Loganberry jam sides, to the various trout dishes on the menu. For a satisfying (not too heavy not too light) brunch, try the baked eggs. They come with a variety of 'mix ins' (I tried the caramelized onions and wild mushrooms) and are served in a mini square-shaped omelet pan. \\n\\nThe service was pleasent--still friendly despite the subtle line forming at the door as we ate. In fact, because our food was taking a while to come to us, our waiter slipped us a Danish Crown Pastry with lemon curd and loganberry jam. Almondy, sweet and buttery, I would have eaten about a thousand of them. (So American of me...) But it was a great snack to tie us over and went great with our Stumptown coffee. (He didn't even charge us for the pastry!) \\n\\nMad \\"Brunch-Love\\" to Broder."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The Chocolate Dipped Bacon gets 5 stars alone.  Everything else was sheer bonus!\\n\\nSo a friend of mine had been pushing us to go to Frank for awhile and I could never get down with going downtown for a hot dog.  Well after we got a party of 10 to go I relented.  \\n\\nThinking that there was no way one hot dog would fill me up I ordered the Sonoran Dog (more on that in a moment) and a small side of waffle fry nachos.  Well let me tell you the hot dogs are huge and the sides are big portions, as I couldn't even finish half of the small waffle fry nachos and the dog was enough by itself.\\n\\nThe Sonoran is a 100% Vienna Beef, stuffed with cheese, wrapped in bacon and deep fried; grilled onions, diced onions, diced tomato, pinto beans, jalapeno sauce, mayonnaise, mustard. (copied from the menu)  I never thought I would want half of these things on my hot dog but now I am not sure if I can ever eat one without it.  This thing was amazing.  I will upload a photo to the page later this afternoon.  This thing must be tried to truly understand the complexities of flavor.  That's right hot dogs can have complex flavors!\\n\\nThe Waffle Fry Nachos are the standard variety, if you have ever had these anywhere else like Plucker's there are the same.  In case you have never heard of these this is what they consist of, crispy fries loaded with refried beans, jalapenos, cheese, sour cream and salsa.  (copied from the menu)  Good flavor.  \\n\\nMy favorite part was the chocolate dipped bacon. DISCLAIMER: I LOVE BACON, I HAVE AN I LOVE BACON BUMPER STICKER ON MY CAR AND A BACON AIR FRESHENER.  It is a thick cut slice of bacon dipped in chocolate and frozen.  It is the perfect blend of savory and sweet.  Perfect ending to the meal.\\n\\nAlso if you are a bloody mary fan they have the Red Headed Stranger, House-made bacon-infused Tito's Vodka, Frank bloody mary mix, garnished with bacon, cheddar cheese, jalapeno stuffed olive, peperoncini, which many of my friends raved about but I am not a fan of bloody marys.\\n\\nLet me be FRANK and say that this place is worth a visit for the hot dogs, sides, desserts, and drinks.  Also a lot of veggie options for those non-meat eaters out there so if you have a friend or significant other that's a vegetarian you can still take them too."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I loved my lamb shank and cocktail.

A relatively small portion, but that's the way it goes with small plates. 3 buns, but they kindly offered to add more a la carte if we wanted.\\nPickled Cucumbers - Refreshing. Similar to half sour pickles. The whipped tofu was a great contrasting texture/flavor.\\n\\nLarge Plates:\\nMushroom Dumplings - The \\"dumplings\\" were more like a ravioli. The broth and cumin were delicate.\\nDuck - Very well cooked, but the dish was otherwise average.\\n\\nService and Ambiance:\\nThe restaurant is lovely.

I've read several articles about XLB and many of them they reference Joe Shanghai's in NYC. I'm from NYC, really miss their soup dumplings since moving here 14 years ago and was eagerly awaiting the opening of XLB. XLB, unfortunately, is no Joe Shanghai.\\n\\nThe dumpling skin was indeed thin, but they lacked the transparency of Joe's. The broth was, in my opinion, meh. I am actually not a fan of the vinegar sauce that typically goes with the dumplings, but I felt that it was needed at XLB to give the broth some flavor. My biggest quip, however, is the pork itself - there's no body - the ground pork just fell apart in my mouth.\\n\\nAll that said, I'm being a bit overly critical as I was expecting Joe's. If there wasn't the expectation, maybe I might give it a 4. All in all, they were good and I do plan on coming here again, but I wouldn't consider them outstanding compared to the soup dumplings I've had in other restaurants (on E 82nd Ave).\\n\\nWe also had the Shanghai Pork and Shrimp Noodles. Great noodles, great flavor. A bit on the salty side. The ground pork, however did not work. The way they served the pork (ground) works well with rice, not noodles.  It's very difficult to eat with noodles. They should, instead, use finely sliced pork instead of ground pork. All in all, another reason for a 3/5.\\n\\nService was ok.

However, the other bartender made up for it with a free sample of a drink.\\n\\nOverall, laid-back, quiet atmosphere, decent service, but way overpriced, at least for drinks and apps.

No problem and she changed my wife's burger to a cheeseburger.\\n\\nShe brings us back the receipt and see that she also knocked off a beer from the tab which instead of the $10 +tip we now owed $5 +tip. \\n\\nTo sum it up this place is new and in the beginning stages of training staff, getting the kitchen going and I'm not going to blame them for anything. the food was very tasty and the prices very reasonable and the staff are very accommodating.

I'd passed this many times on the BeltLine and always wanted to go. The lights at just the right amount of brightness, amazing art on the walls, great view of the city. Onto the service and food...\\n\\nWe were on our 1-year anniversary dinner, had reservations, and we were treated really nicely by the women at the front. We were seated, introduced to our waiter, a young man who was nice. He took our drink orders. Things were going well. Then we were introduced to *another* server (I will call \\"Server #2) who said she was \\"on [our first server's] team.\\" Seemed efficient, so we didn't think anything of it. We were told by Server #2 during ordering that \\"if we didn't think we'd want the side item than came with an entree, we could switch for any one of the other sides.\\" No mention of any upcharge for this, so I opted to make a change. We were all set. The food arrived.\\n\\nOverall, the food at TWO Urban Licks just wasn't very good. Certainly NOT worth the prices they were charging. There was a highlight to our meal: we had the pimento cheese hushpuppies to start. They were actually fantastic, and if you're ever there for a cocktail and you want a snack, check them out. \\n\\nAs for the entrees, we both thought they were lacking - of flavor. I ordered the brisket and opted to get the \\"NY Mac and Cheese.\\" The brisket is supposed to be one of the things they're \\"known for,\\" according to Server #2. The brisket was just bland. It was certainly tender, but I don't think they seasoned it at all. It reminded me more of my mother's tired pot roast (truly sorry mom). The mac and cheese wasn't much better. Again it lacked a salt component. I felt like the food was lazy. Certainly for $25 - or was it $27? (More on that in a minute). My wife had the smoked chicken; hers came with the mac and cheese. Now, my wife even prefers to have less salt in her flavor profiles, but she even went so far as to request salt - which she even says is rude in chef-run establishments, but it was that bland. Her final quote on the entree was, \\"It was just a smoked chicken and mac and cheese. Nothing special about it. I could have gone to Fox Bros and gotten the same thing only it would have been phenomenal.\\" That's true. Two Urban Licks, we felt, was overpriced for the flavors we were presented. \\n\\nBut the big question was where did both of our servers go and why did they change our orders on our final bill? \\n\\nWe hardly saw our server(s). Finally, I get the check, and suddenly 3 up-charges were added without any previous mention. \\n\\n1., I order a Scotch on the rocks - I was charged for the addition of ice. WHAT? Pour a jigger's worth in a glass and either add ice or don't, but don't claim, \\"Well, when you order it a certain way, like on the rocks, you have to pour more into the glass,\\" as Server #2 claimed. No. \\n\\n2., I was told I could change my side item, and Server #2 even went into some long thing about how they were running low on a side, and it was the only one we couldn't technically order a \\"side\\" of by itself. She was really helpful in giving us the opportunity to make a change, but never once did she inform that we would be charged to do so. I was charged. Sneaky, Server #2. \\n\\nSneakier still (3.) my wife ordered a certain wine; on the bill we're charged for a wine in the next price tier. Server #2 said she was going to check with #1 on this, but basically did a lap around the restaurant (I'm assuming) and came back with a confounding excuse along the lines of, \\"we ran out of the wine you ordered, but there are so many around the same tier, we just substituted the wine you ordered for another one.\\" WHAT? OK. But my wife ordered a wine in the 1st tier to be price conscious, and the wine you replaced hers with wasn't in the same tier at all. So you either tell us that you have an alternate in mind or just charge us the same price as the wine WE ORDERED. \\n\\nNEVER in my entire life has a server flat out changed my order to something more expensive, not to mention just assumed it wouldn't be noticed or that her action was just fine. What the hell?\\n\\nDon't take your customers for granted. I get that Two Urban Licks is a \\"swanky\\" place that books up all the time, and people regularly pay decent money for a reasonably sized meal. But just because the check comes out near $100+ (and likely well north of that all the time), doesn't mean that your customers aren't paying attention. The way we were treated and charged made us think the servers thought we were stupid. That's what tipping is for. \\n\\nNOTE: Server #1 did finally pop up to our table again with an \\"anniversary treat\\" for us. It was a blondie cookie browny with some cream and some syrup on the plate. It was a nice thing to do. But it didn't justify the lack of flavor or the way the wait staff attempted to milk us for a few dollars more."},{"name":"Ganko Ittetsu Ramen","address":"318 Harvard St, Unit 3","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Great food!

Before I came to the restaurant, my girlfriend called and asked if they had the $10 endless appetizers. The person who answered the phone said yes and we went to the restaurant. When I first walked in, I was told to sit at the bar, even though I requested a table seat. Realizing that my choice was not taken seriously, I obliged and sat the bar. While at the bar, the bartender informed us of $12 appetizers, which was a better deal. After sitting at the bar for about two minutes, it became very uncomfortable and I asked them to move to me a table. The hostess informed us it would be a ten minute  wait. Twenty minutes later, my girlfriend and I were walked over to our seats. Our server, Jessica, came and we requested the endless appetizers. We also questioned her about the $12 appetizers. She said that that restaurant did not sell the endless appetizers at all because they were a corporate restaurant and not a franchise. We informed her that we had just called right before we came. She states that she has worked at this location for years, and unless the menu was recently changed, they did not have endless appetizers at the location. We requested her to ask someone else. She became upset, and by her body language we could tell she was frustrated that we would dare question her knowledge of the menu. She went to talk to the manager, Nadeem, and came back about ten minutes later. She said they did have the endless appetizers but they only had the potato skins and boneless wings. I informed her the bartender told us there were more options and once again she became frustrated. She stormed off and came back about eight minutes later and said they had more options. She named the options. We were ready to order and asked her once again about the $12 appetizers. She said they did not have that option. Again we requested her to speak to someone else. Once again, she stormed off to talk to someone else. She came back about five minutes later and said that they did have that option. At this point, I don't feel comfortable with her serving my food and went to speak with the manager. I expressed my concern to the manager about her behavior and lack of knowledge of the menu. He stated that he was unable to switch the server. While speaking to Nadeem, the manager, Jessica butted in with her arms crossed. I expressed to her that I did not not want her as my server due to her behavior. She started saying she was not frustrated and tried to put on a fake smile. I informed her I wanted another server. While speaking to her, another server, Christopher pulled her and told her to walk away after seeing her frustration. As I was speaking to he manager, I again expressed that I did not want her as a server. While speaking to the manager, I asked Christopher a question in regards to Jessica's behavior. Christopher became upset and with an attitude claimed he was not there. He raised his voice, went on the defense and like a child, said he wasn't going to speak to me at all. Mind you, this all occurred in the presence of the manager, who never asked his employees to act in a professional manner. During the entire ordeal, nobody apologized. Jessica did not apologize for the misinformation and her taking out her frustration out on us. Christopher did not apologize for raising his voice and his immature behavior. Nadeem did not apologize for the actions taken by his employees.

The surreal artwork juxtaposed with old photographs of the school during its heyday on the walls enhances the old-world Lewis Carroll vibe. The food is decent, mainly pub fare which is to be expected given the size and capacity of the building.

The Ruby is good if you don't mind sweeter beers. The service is excellent. We love to take in a movie here as the couches are super cozy and they will bring you your food order in the theater.

The price tag was hefty for just a Queen bed during a weekday night ($165 mind you) but I figured since this room was in the historical school building that we'd be paying for this novel experience. The room we got was novel for sure. Chalk boards lined the hallway leading to the room and to the room itself, creating a cute yet slightly creepy vibe. Past guests wrote love notes, but also messages like \\"This room has diarrhea.\\" Maybe the staff should go take a look at the boards after guests leave? Not exactly welcoming...\\n\\nOverall the space was fine but not good for a romantic evening. For $165 I thought we'd be staying in the lap of luxury but not here. It felt like a classroom (surprise) and was extremely dark which sort of added to the creep factor. The dim lighting didn't help. I recommend that they install brighter bulbs and more lighting fixtures. \\n\\nWe also didn't get the best sleep. We were placed in a room right next to a busy road leading to the highway and were awakened by the clock alarm we suspect was previously set by a past guest. If you don't mind traffic noise then you'll like this place. \\n\\nThe building itself is very beautiful and has a lot to offer so we felt like we were paying for some of these perks. Perks included admission to the awesome movie theater (which has couch seating), and access to the heated salt pool (which we didn't try out). There are also plenty of cool bars in the building and a decent restaurant. My only issue with the restaurant is that they served me juice cocktail for breakfast not real juice like I was hoping. \\n\\nUpon checkout we were charged a lodging tax of $20. Apparently this is standard in Oregon and being from out of town we didn't realize this was a thing. That definitely increased the already huge bill.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, this place is cool, interesting, and definitely worth exploring, but not worth over $200 for one night in my opinion.

I'm not a pumpkin spice kind of guy, but they do make their PSL out of real pumpkin, and have plenty of vegetarian options, including a veggie sausage breakfast sandwich.

The brisket is tender, but the sauce is a little overpowering.  (I had to scrape some off.)  On the other hand, while I enjoy the blackened salmon, but would like it a little spicier.  The pulled chicken is not as good. The dinner portions are large.  I usually have items to take home.\\n\\nBTW, they really do sell bison.  I did try the bison burger a while back.  It was not my favorite meat.  But, at least I can now say that I have tried it.\\n\\nMy wife often tells me that the true test of a restaurant is how well it prepares its vegetables.  The string beans are always cooked to perfection.  They are the right level of crisp and fresh.  I personally love the cucumber salad -- which is not too sweet.  Yay.

You don't get that upscale stuffy vibe. People are enjoying themselves and their food.\\n\\nIn my opinion, which let's be honest - is of epic importance, you walk down 1 of 2 paths. Either path will get you to heaven at the end of the day, and each offers their own unique experience. Tapas style (if you are with family and friendly company), or Entree Style (if you are here on business or not into sharing dishes with others). Let me get this straight, there is no wrong way! Tapas style provides you with the opportunity to sample the menu of smaller appetizers. They come in small and large sizes depending on how crazy you feel. I will call out the Empinadas - both the beef and veggie are must haves for this guy. Entrees are amazing though. Meats and fish are cooked as they are intended to and will certainly fill you up. My favorites are the Filet and Lamb Shank, both of which have me salivating in my chair as I write this.\\n\\nThe only possible criticism is that the wine selections are limited for a restaurant of this caliber and that the waitstaff are not very educated in the wine offerings. That point aside, the service is top-notch. They are extremely attentive to your beverages and making sure you have everything you need without being over-the-top.\\n\\nMake sure you make a reservation, particularly Fri-Sun.

This 15 minute was made all the more excruciating by the group of panhandling dirty street kids huddling a mere foot from the line of people at Voodoo. Add in the two or three homeless men standing under the sign, closer to the door, and you have an immediate bad impression on this place.\\n\\nBut, I'm from LA and have seen way worse, so it's not a huge personal sticking point, but a definite point to bring up for the few living under rocks that haven't heard of Voodoo Doughnut. The maple bacon bar was overpriced and way too sweet. Like... twice as sweet as your average doughnut frosting. The combo of maple and bacon is tried and true, but I could pass it up in doughnut form.  \\n\\nBelieve it or not, the other donuts from Voodoo are legitimately good. Namely the classic blueberry, which was perfectly crispy on the outside, and fluffy and flavorful on the inside. The Mexican hot chocolate doughnut isn't just cocoa and cinnamon - it gets an extra kick of cayenne pepper that really sets it apart. Luckily for all of us, the non-touristy varieties are considerably cheaper. \\n\\nLike a lot of these overhyped places, you can enjoy them if you do your research. In the case of Voodoo Doughnut, that research comes in the form of skipping this location in lieu of the other location in Portland. Or, for those like myself who were heading back south down Interstate 5, just hit up the quiet location in Eugene.

Was I ever in for a surprise. First impression was it looked to be in a little bit of a swanky type building for what I'd read.  We'd not sat down before one guy was asking us what we wanted to drink.  I thought maybe he was just eager to serve and our food would arrive pretty quickly.  It was a very light crowd.  About ten minutes after getting our first drink somebody came back around to see if we wanted more coffee and coke. A while later a lady kind of made her way to our table and fairly bluntly asked us what we wanted.  \\"what do you want?\\" were the exact words. I'd have thought language barrier except for the lack of any accent at all.  Anyway eventually our food arrived. I was not yet irritated at this point.  My daughter's plate was kind of a soggy mess of dripping cheese and chipotle sauce.  The first thing I did was try a potatoe. I literally flinched because it was unexpectedly cold.  Then tried the beans. While somewhat tasty, they were also mildly lukewarm.  Next the Machacado which I did expect to be cold but was surprised.  The eggs were powder btw.  The tortillas were kind of a ripped up mess and they did not bring salsa to the table. I had to ask for it.  The  first couple of bites into my meal I was pleased..  But then the overpowering taste of onion took over and never left.  In order to get anyone to stop at my table I had to literally flag them down.  And the waitstaff all appear busy at first glance. But a closer look and they are dodging around doing a lot of nothing.  That many people and not ONE carrying a pot of coffee to fill cups?  Having to flag down stand offish waitress?  I mean she wasn't rude but you just seemed to have this sense that she definately had other things to do beside service the table. I can say that they were a little bit better than La Feria or one or two other places I've been.  Definately not worth the price.  I'd not go back or recommend it to anyone.

THREE TIMES I've been in there when there weren't enoug of those little 3-jar carriers with the jams and the nutella for all the tables that had breads on their table.

I asked for a sweetened ice tea and it came out unsweetened with no ice.  Little things like this were expected because the restaurant is so new.  However, the part that got me to give this restaurant such a low rating was the time it took for our food to come out.  We waited 40 minutes and asked where our food was.  The restaurant had emptied out and the waiter said he didn't know when our food would be ready and the kitchen was really busy. I asked if he could bring out the Caesar salad, as there is no cooking involved, and he said all of the food would be out at the same time and he was unable to bring the salad first.

We ordered from here about a week ago and after about 45 min, someone pulled up the house. I say someone because there was nothing to indicate he worked for pizza hut. No topper on the car. No signage. I understand it shouldn't be that big of a deal but it is. When asked 'you don't have a car topper?' His response was a gruff 'nope'. Nothing else. After this he snatched the receipt from my friend's hand because he couldn't remember our total. No apology. No explanation. Just a completely rude man named Jason. His attitude was uncalled for and unappreciated. When we got inside our pizzas were completely disheveled. All the pieces were spread around the box like someone shook it up. Thanks again, Jason. \\nToday we decided to give it another shot. We ordered online to avoid rude customer service that seems to be normal for this location. We received am email confirmation quoting less than $25. Unfortunately the website entered the order wrong forcing us to call. They made the correction abruptly. Rude as usual. \\nWhen my pizza was delivered, unfortunately, it was Jason again. He pulled up with a topper this time but literally did not say ONE WORD to us. Anxious to have him leave we gave him the money. Still he said nothing. 5 min later he came back to tell us that our receipt says we owe $35 not $25. He called the store and I guess figured it out but with definite attitude. When we checked the pizza it was cut crazy. With extra cuts through the slices. Our cheese sticks were burnt and hardly had cheese. Bad pizza aside, Jason should be fired. His job is to be friendly when showing up to a STRANGER'S HOME! Not speaking to a customer or being rude to them at their own home is completely absurd. There is absolutely no excuse. After repeatedly calling the store and receiving no real response other than 'I'll speak to him' (they clearly dont), I feel I have no other repercussion than calling corporate and going to social media."},{"name":"Ella","address":"1265 Alpine Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"3","text":"Oh how we had such high hopes.\\n\\nWe've been nearby neighbors of the Ideal Market shopping area for years now.

Their deli subs hover around $8 but will not leave much to complain about.  One sub can feed two or more people for an entire day.  If you're a meat-lover you won't be disappointed.

Let me be clear, this was just the free bread that came with the table. Yeah. Awesome. We then had a potato small plate smothered in three more completely unlike anything I'd ever tasted sauces and roasted caramelized peanuts. So good. I ordered quinoa risotto \\"Quinotto\\" with fresh market vegetables, laced with truffle oil, and decorated with a plate full of colourful sauces. It came out looking like plain old quinoa until I took a bit and my mind was blown. I never knew quinoa could taste so delicious. My husband had the chicken which he said was incredible moist and delicate. A very generous portion with sides of vegetables and potatoes. Seriously. Go here.

That sounded so interesting that I had to try it.\\n\\nMy Slawdog was made with the all beef Vienna hotdog, it and the bun were very good.  The Cole slaw on my hotdog had a spicy horseradish taste.  the taste was ok. The cabbage in the slaw was wilted and cut broadly.  It was kind of hard to eat. It tasted a little old.  It would have been better if it was not wilted.  \\n\\nThe Chili Dog was much better.  The chili was made from shredded beef and no beans.  It was a little spicy.  The taste was ok if a little bland.  Spicy chili should have a flavor that kicks a little.  This one limped a little.

It had pasta, some bell peppers, carrots, zucchini, squash and some other stuff I could not identify.  It should have been good. The dressing was suppose to be a Balsamic Vinaigrette.  The whole salad was just swimming in oil.  They basically covered the whole salad in oil.  It slid down nicely but it did not taste good.\\n\\nThe chocolate covered bacon dessert was good.  It had a little too much salt on it but it was real good.  I was a little scared when I read it on the menu but I had to try it. It was a nice thick piece of bacon that was fried crisp.

It was so torturous that a man had fainted in line because it was so long!  An ambulance and the entire EMT shabang came out!  ...How exciting.

First, do not sit at the bar. You end up staring at the dirtiest kitchen you will ever see. That being said, I love Waffle House hash browns, so I didn't let that bother me. But I went to this location for breakfast and have never been more frustrated. I ordered a waffle and hash browns smothered and country. After hearing my server beg for help making a waffle, I was a little worried. Literally all they have to do is scoop pre-made batter into a preheated waffle maker. Well, imagine that, my hash browns come out, and no waffle. The girl tells me the waffle will be right up. I look down at my hash browns, and there is a quarter sized dollop of gravy on them. Not quite covered in gravy, but their hash browns are good enough on their own that I don't get too mad about that. Then, after eating my hash browns, I am still waiting patiently for my waffle. I am not sure if the employees realize this or not, but you are literally sitting 5 inches away from them and can hear them talking, and again I hear my server begging for help to make a waffle. At this point, 15 minutes after my order (maybe longer), my waffle has still not been put in the waffle maker. I hear her again asking other employees, and they apparently never heard he before. She kept saying that she was not good at making waffles. Eventually, she gives up and puts the waffle in herself. After a while, I see her go over to the waffle maker and scrape the uncooked mess out of the waffle maker and throw it in the trash, then begin to try again. I finally say, \\"I have been here 45 minutes. I need to go to work, can I just give up on the waffle?\\" Then, while I am checking out she apologizes and says she is just bad at making waffles. To top it off, I still tip because I am not a jerk. When the girl takes the receipt back, she looks right at the receipt to see if there was a tip. I wanted to call her out on it since she obviously knew it sucked so bad that she did not deserve a tip. Needless to say, that was my last visit to this location.

Me and the hubby had a nice date night planned, and this place had been on the list for awhile. \\n\\nI LOVED the interior when we arrived, the ambiance was really lovely and I liked the small space. Lenoir does a $38 3-course pre fixe menu. We also did a bread and spread for an additional $5. Overall our food was decent. We weren't blown away by anything, but overall it was a decent meal. \\n\\nI had the Hemp Soup - which I didn't care for, although that was not the fault of the chef, just a flavor I didn't like. The Buttermilk Rabbit was my second course and the Goat Confit was my third course. Both my second and third course were good. We also did the bread and spread, which was an onion naan with some type of broccoli spread - it was delicious and the hubby even ate broccoli! \\n\\nThe hubby went with all three sea options: Snapper Cudo, Nishiki Risotto and Poha Crusted Mahi. I thought his first two courses were good - although the Crudo was my favorite and he preferred the Risotto. The last course, the Mahi, seemed a bit underwhelming and it seemed you could barely taste the fish. But still a decent dish.\\n\\nNow, honestly, the food probably would have gotten them at least three stars if not for the fact that we had pretty awful service, which you don't expect at a restaurant such as this. \\n\\nAs I mentioned the restaurant is tiny, and they didn't seem busy when we first arrived. But we had to request/remind our waiter three times before finally getting the bread and spread course we ordered (which was delicious, and might have been the highlight of our meal). My first course was a soup, and it took me 5-10 minutes to catch anyone's attention and point out that I still needed a spoon. Which means that my soup sat there getting cold for quite awhile before I was able to eat it (perhaps another reason that I didn't care for my first course). \\n\\nThis happened again with the second course, although we were able to catch someone's eye faster with this one. The third course our waiter inexplicably brought us spoons despite neither of us needing them with that course. The waiter didn't keep a good eye on our drinks, we probably would have had another glass of wine if we had been given the opportunity to order it (although this was really the least offensive part of the service, if we really wanted another glass of wine I am sure we could have made that happen). We waited for an inordinate amount of time for our last course to come out. The waiter did comment that it was taking quite awhile, but there were no apologies made - just a joke that he is sure we are really ready for our last course (we were).

The queso isn't your normal white cheese queso but it's a cheddar queso and it has peppers in it which i liked. It was fairly watery in my opinion and was just not what i expected.

It's too legit to quit.\\n\\nCame here on a recommendation from two Boston natives on a Sunday night.  Luckily we made a reservation because by 6 pm, there was an hour+ wait.

Yes, it was a painted lobster claw with a Santa hat on it and it's freaking awesome.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is very old-timey, but isn't cheesey.  Our waitress was awesome and was very helpful in our decision on what to order.  I went with the lobstah (sorry, I couldn't resist) which came with a potato and cornbread and my husband went with the \\"lazy man\\" lobster (lobster meat mixed with cream, breadcrumbs, and butter) also with a potato and cornbread.  To start, we shared a bowl of the chowdah (sorry again, Bostonians, I know I'm a jerk).\\n\\nThe chowder was delicious-- I'm glad we shared because it's extremely heavy, but the flavors were amazing.  I'm a huge lobster fan, so I thought mine was delicious (but how can you really mess up lobster dipped in hot butter?).  I thought the tail was a little tough, but I was having so much fun breaking open and eating that bugger that I didn't care.  My husband loved his lazy man lobster.  He did not love me making fun of him for being a lazy man and not going with the whole lobster.\\n\\nOverall, I feel like you can't leave Boston without getting some lobster and chowder and Union Oyster House is a great place to have that experience.

That would represent a typical \\"Portland brunch\\" for people coming in from out of town. And ideally, a menu that would be reasonably priced.\\n\\nMy mission had disaster written all over it, starting with step one: A place that takes reservations for brunch, which is a near insurmountable challenge in Portland.\\n\\nEquinox gets 5 stars because it met absolutely all of these categories! Plus, the food is nice, atmosphere is cheery, staff is friendly and on top of things, and everyone in my party went home happy.\\n\\nFOOD\\nTotally decent brunch. It's not a meal you'll remember for decades or write home about, but you'll probably remember it for the rest of the day and the following, and it's all delicious. Most importantly, there's something for everyone: vegetarian options, seafood and meats, benedicts, breakfast sammies, southwestern style, Portland style, sweet and savory options. It's a crowd-pleasing menu. And in each dish, the eggs are cooked to perfection. (For me, a perfectly cooked egg is crucial, for brunch especially!)\\n\\nPORTIONS are PERFECT. You'll leave full and satisfied but not overly stuffed or needing to take food to go. We went after running the Shamrock 15k and half marathon in the freezing rain and everyone left eating everything on their plate yet feeling full and satisfied. I also love that the prices completely match the portions and quality. Most breakfast entrees are $9-11. Couldn't have asked for a better fit.\\n\\nDRINKS\\nVery happy with the drink menu. I got a fresh grapefruit juice for $4 and most everyone in my party got bloody's or coffee. At $5 each, and a variety of bloody mary options, they are at the perfect price point to order 2.\\n\\nSERVICE\\nReally nice. Sunday brunch is hectic in Portland, pretty much everywhere. But we had reservations (thank you, Equinox!!!!!!!!!) and the restaurant had timed the seating perfectly.

I'll let him speak for himself as far as his experience; mine was definitely positive, but not overwhelming.\\n\\nBlue Dahlia has the look and feel of a place I would love.  It is comfortable and casual, yet it exudes a certain quality that suggests that you're about to undergo a pampering.  You're enveloped in a serene vibe as you step inside and take in your surroundings...the crusty breads piled near the register...the simple arrangements of dried flowers on the tables...the rustic furniture...the muted yellow-orange color on the walls...this place is well put-together.  \\n\\nWe split two of their sandwiches - one with ricotta, fig, and a drizzle of some kind of sweet agave syrup; the other was the chicken salad with cranberries.  The sandwiches are served open-faced, cut into five pieces on individual cutting boards, and arranged so artistically that both Don and I broke out our camera phones and proceeded to photograph our lunches.  \\n\\nWhile the food was good enough, there was something lacking in the execution.  The chicken salad just seemed like plain old chicken salad.  The bread was nice and hearty and yes, it had dried cranberries on top, but these elements weren't enough to take the sandwich to the heights I had been expecting.  Ditto with the ricotta sandwich.  In my mind, these elements would meld together to create an unusual and interesting taste sensation; in practice, this just tasted like a sweetened ricotta on a better-than-average slice of wheat bread.  The other ingredients were too subtle to make a statement in the grand scheme of the sandwich.\\n\\nCost was on the highish end; two sandwiches + one drink, tax and tip ran us $9 apiece.  \\n\\nIf I had my druthers, I'd give Blue Dahlia 3-1/2 stars - but since I can't, I'll let the lovely atmosphere and the very friendly and attentive service tip the scales to four."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"461 N Central Ave","city":"Hapeville","stars":"4","text":"The cool stuff about this building, its history, and its characters still stand; this review serves as purely a review of Chick-fil-a's new banana pudding milkshake.

And that is fine if you know that going into it.  Like, I said, it's a great place for socializing as you will not be rushed to get out of there.  The food is overpriced in my opinion.  $9 for a tartine that has the thinnest possible amount of butter and skimpy amounts of pre-packaged turkey with what is also possibly pre-package cranberry chutney, is a little much. The slice of canteloupe on the platter tasted as if it was starting to ferment. If they charged $6 or $7, I'd be happy with what I got.  It was just ok for me.  Slightly too expensive.

I couldn't differentiate their tastes. First of all, the patty was way too small compared to the size of the bun, and I thought the toppings and the sauces are pretty much the same for every burger.

But then they were featured on the Travel Channel last year, and maybe somebody started believing they had something big on their hands and needed to go corporate and maybe eventually do franchises!  Pure speculation here, but more on that later.\\n\\nImportant note: they only take cash !!!!!!!\\n\\n\\nSo the service is spotty, and often rude, or  sometimes nice.  Just ask for a Voodoo Dozen and save both of you some awkward moments of eye rolling.  They have a strict policy that they pick what goes in the voodoo dozen so just let them fill the pink box in peace.  If you have a group, order the Big As Texas donut and a bear claw/apple fritter (they will fit in the pink box on top of your dozen).  If you have kids, order the bubble gum donut and a blue berry donut (so sweet only a kid can eat it anyway), the tang is excellent for the kid inside all of us.  The peanut butter and chocolate covered oreo donut will keep a teenager quiet for a good ten minutes.  The jelly filled maple bar with a pretzel stake is a favorite.  The old fashion cake donuts make up half your voodoo dozen and you will appreciate having them after you discover how overly sweet the weird ones are.  The weird half of the dozen we slice up to about bite size and let everyone in the group sample them all.\\n\\n They have about twenty picnic tables in the narrow street next to them so this is perfect for a larger group on a fair weather day.  Otherwise, smell your pink box all the way home and slice it up there.  Put the donuts inside a zip loc bag to keep them soft over night.  Walk two blocks south on 3rd to Stump Town cafe on the left and get some awesome espresso to go with your donuts.\\n\\nOkay, back to my speculation.  I first started going to Voodoo about five years ago (I was heading to work after at o' dark thirty and it was too early for my bagel shop (yes, THAT early) and so I remembered the suggestion of Voodoo. I was definitely the office hero that morning with my Voodoo dozen.then last fall they closed their old tiny location on 3rd for remodeling (i.e.after the travel channel debut) but we found our way across the Burnside bridge to their new second  bigger location off Sandy boulevard.  There was a huge line, but it went fast, about twenty minutes.  The donuts were okay, but not as good as I remembered.\\n\\nThen they opened up the original spot here on 3rd & Burnside, they moved in to the corner nook of the building and so now half the line can at least stand in queue inside where it's warm rather than freeze outside the whole time.  Half the time the staff are yelling\\"close the door\\"to the customers who want to let the cold air in the store while they are waiting in line. And then the taste and quality of the donuts/ingredients really hit below average. I'm disappointed and have been trying different places for my monthly donut fix now.\\n\\nFrom here, if you are going up Burnside to visit Powells(largest book store in the world) I highly recommend Cacao Cafe on 13th avenue across Burnside from Powells.  They have drinking chocolate that is very rich but surprisingly not very sweet and makes an excellent compliment to your pink box of donuts!\\n\\nP.S. Yes there really is a line for this place 24/7, even 4am when I went there the first time.  Part of being a tourist destination I guess..."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We had brunch on the patio on what was, seemingly, the last great autumn day before the polar vortex reappeared.

He deserved no tip from me (srr for being a bitch). But The ONE and only reason I gave this place 1 star is that the server STOLE MONEY. So I signed my receipt with the total of $24. Later checking my bank statement I got charged $28. I know how much when I signed so the server must have written down the tip HIMSELF. $4 was nothing but the fact that he did it himself without my permission  was stealing and unacceptable.

I decided to bring my folks visiting from home here as they have a gluten free menu - and my mom is allergic to gluten. \\n\\nStraight off the bat, let me tell you, the wait is about 30 minutes on average. Visiting here on a weekend can be quite annoying, especially if it is cold or rainy. \\n\\nAfter a 30 minute wait for our table, we were seated by a friendly hostess, and our waiter attended our table immediately, and our drinks were brought out. The cappuccino is definitely great. They offer a variety of teas, and $2.30 mimosas. \\n\\nWe placed our orders - a veggie royale($8.25) , an omlette ($7.25) , a veggin out plate ($8.25), a kid's grilled cheese($5.25 with side)  and a taco from the gluten free menu. I also specifically asked that the kid's sandwich be brought out early - it's just a grilled cheese sandwich with a side. \\n\\n45 minutes later, there was no indication of our food being brought out. I am normally quite patient, and have handled more than my share of toddler tantrums. But making my poor toddler wait 45 minutes for a grilled cheese sandwich is nothing short of criminal. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to be a d@ck about this - but making your customers wait this long , especially when the restaurant isn't full is a major fail. In addition, our waiter was nowhere to be seen. \\n\\nAfter i caught a hold of him and asked for the kid's sandwich, he said the \\"kitchen is really backed up and your food will be out shortly.\\"  5 minutes later, the 'it just takes a couple of minutes to make!' grilled cheese came out - with no side. (we paid for the side as well). Then, our food finally arrived, by which time I almost cancelled our order and walked out. \\n\\nThe veggie royale is indisputably good. The basil aioli was fantastic, and the asian slaw was as good as ever - as were the other entrees. But we was so annoyed, we barely enjoyed our food. We were so hungry, we bolted down our food as opposed to savoring it. \\n\\nThis is my third time here - and my third bad experience with the wait time on food and lackluster service. \\n\\nA whopping $50 later, we all walked out , exhausted from waiting and re evaluating ever coming back."},{"name":"Pizzeria Locale","address":"1730 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"Wow.

I fully expected an awesome experience. \\n\\nIt was, in the final analysis, odd. \\n\\nThe food wasn't the problem--that WAS awesome. As you know by now, the menu changes daily. Even though it's limited, it was still hard to decide. My other half had the special entr√©e, which were 3 little grain cakes with collards and squash. I had a sort of open-face sandwich of brie and kumquats with a green salad. Both were great, the brie and kumquats were an unexpected flavor combo, and worked beautifully. The collards were some of the best I've had. Servings were smallish-- and that's a huge plus to me. For dessert we had two mini cookies. Tasty and just enough. \\n\\nSadly, that's where the awesome ended. \\n\\nWe all recognize that the food is only a part of any dining experience. The vibe and service and probably some other subconscious factors all add up to how you feel when you leave after the check is paid. \\n\\nAdd that feeling was just....odd.\\n\\nHere are some of the contributors to the strangeness. \\n\\n1st, when we arrived, at close to 6:30, the server was hesitant to seat us due to our lack of reservations (who knew we'd need them at 6:30?) We happily offered to sit at the bar which gave us a great vantage point from which to observe. \\n\\nSoon after, several parties arrived, also without reservations and were \\"discouraged\\" - I can't say they were actually turned away. Yet, when we left at 7:45ish, there were at least two large tables empty. Considering the table sharing set-up, that's a lot of missed opportunity and disappointed potential customers. And chaos at the counter. I wonder if they should accept reservations only for large parties?\\n\\nOur service was cool. Not \\"kewl\\". Chilly. I almost felt (which I know is silly) like they didn't want us there. We were offered only water to drink. No bread for us, even though it was quickly delivered to others' tables. Our food was a tad slow--- which wouldn't have been a surprise except that everyone else's arrived within minutes of ordering. We had to ask for dessert. \\n\\nNow, before you say, \\"hey, friendly works both ways!\\" please understand that we're not pushy, loud, boorish or otherwise in any way a pain. Quite the opposite- we were cheerful & complimentary-and tipped better than we should have. \\n\\nSo in summary, yes it was odd. We were disappointed, especially since we really, really expected and wanted to like it. \\n\\nI will go back, hopefully soon, maybe for lunch, maybe with reservations. I need to know if this was just an off night or if the vibe there is just not for me.

Having never been to a place like this we needed time to take in all the options and understand what they meant.  The guy behind the register could see we were a little confused and asked if we had ever been there before.  After we both told him no he offered us a sample of the sides they offered and explained what each of them was.  It was so nice to have someone take the time to explain what each item was and how it was made.  After he explained the sides he went on to the menu and told us how it worked.  \\n\\nWe both choice the combo #2 since it came with two sides and I personally wanted to eat as many of their delicious sides as possible.  I ordered the plantains and yucca fries and my co-worker ordered the same fries and black beans.

The space is beautifully decorated with a mixture of funky and fresh.  The metal tables are perfectly placed and its patio is definitely a place to enjoy a meal on a warm spring day (unfortunately Tuesday was 38 degrees so that did not work).   On most nights they have live music to boot.  Around since 2004 and initially getting mixed reviews, I found this visit even better than the last few.  The restaurant serving \\"Fiery American Cooking\\" serves up an interesting twist on updated American/Cajun cuisine.  Unlike Parish Foods and Goods, Two Urban delivers.\\n\\nHeading the kitchen is Chef Cameron Thompson, former sous chef to Scott Serpas who recently left Two Urban to open up his own eatery called Serpas True Foods, has come into his own since he has been passed the apron.  His food is appetizing, inventive and just plain good.  Having now tried approximately two thirds of the offerings, I find that there is not one dish that has disappointed thus far.  Although always tempted by the mouthwatering and fall off the bone baby back ribs as a starter and the braised pork for an entree, this time around I had none of it.  Rather than gorge on meats, we went to the other extreme and only dined on dishes derived from the sea: Thai Tuna Tartare, Oysters and Okra and bronzed scallops.  Each dish was more flavorful than the next. \\n\\nThe first dishes to arrive were the Tuna Tartare and the Oysters.  The tuna served on wonton chips four across presently beautifully on a miniature antique \\"table\\" was both simple and complicated at the same time.  Dressed with avocado, mango and sriracha aioli added immense flavor without detracting from the freshness and softness of the tuna.  In every bite you tasted all four ingredients, which is quite amazing since sriracha (chili based sauce) can be overpowering in the wrong hands.  The coolness of the mango, avocado and tuna was a perfect compliment to the spicier sriracha.  In my mind it was a perfect dish.  The follow up, oysters and okra, although not bursting with the flavors of the tuna, did not disappoint.  As the dish sounds, it consisted of oysters and okra, both fried, along with some jalapeno peppers and onions.  As is more often the case than not, the oysters tend to loose their flavor and texture when tossed in the fryer.  That did not happen here.  In this case, the coating held in all of the moisture and flavor of the oyster thus culminating in a wonderful explosion of flavor on the palate.  The accompanying fried vegetables were tasteful in their own right, but the oysters were really the winner in this dish.\\n\\nAs an entree my dining companion and I both got scallops.  I view it as a check on the palate.  Both of us had the same reaction on the first bite - pure pleasure!  The scallops, \\"bronzed\\" perfectly and springled with the right mixture of cajun spices sat on top of the creamiest gouda grits topped with a pico de gallo next to a beautiful smoky tomato broth.  The subtle flavor of the scallop was never masked by the cajun spices and was even enhanced when touched to the broth.  As far as grits go, these were some of the best I have had in a long time.  My dining partner proclaimed they were the best she had ever had.  It is clear from this dish that Chef Thompson knows how ingredients work together and really brings the best of them out.\\n\\nIn the end the meal was perfect.  Much to the chagrin of the entire staff, we spent 5 hours in the restaurant enjoying it.  To me that speaks volumes on the overall night and the food.  If you have been to this restaurant, but it has been a while, go back.  It is firing on all cylinders right now and I do not see it changing anytime soon."},{"name":"A Touch of Earth","address":"North Market, 59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Their lattes are super sweet.

We were lucky enough to not have to wait in a huge line, but be prepared to wait. Also, they are cash only people so be prepared. \\n\\nWe tried the Voodoo doll, which is literally a voodoo doll shaped donut covered in chocolate and filled with raspberry jelly. This donut was definitely my favorite. The raspberry and chocolate worked well together. We also tried the famous bacon maple bar. I am not usually a fan of maple bars, but this one was great wtih the salty and crisp bacon on top. We also pigged out on the Captain my Captain which is smothered in vanilla frosting and covered in Captain Crunch. This literally tasted like a bowl of cereal, such a cool concept. Lastly, we tried the apple fritter which was pretty standard. They do have different flavored fritters, which was cool, but nothing special about the apple. \\n\\nSo here is the thing about Voodoo, the doughnuts don't taste much different from most doughnuts but the toppings are so creative.

Farm to table is always welcome but this may be the last place in metro ATL I'd expect to find it. \\n\\nYou will smell the firey goodness before you even open the front door and it will stay with you until you drive away.  The former upper level dining is now private dining. In case you need to know that for future private dining reference. Dozens of people ask me where to go for groups and I can add this to that list.  This is a big space but manages to feel perfectly cozy.

You'll even find rare California reds on the list.  \\n \\n\\nIt's impressive to me that my server is so in love with the food he's serving that he can barely contain the joy. I hope when I cook my servers feel this excitement. I am a little jealous in that regard.\\n \\n\\nThe food here is made with a lot of love and you can taste it. The sticky chicken wings take 36 hours to get to your table. The artichoke is roasted in the flame.  The bread found its way over from Holeman and Finch. The soup onions are roasted.  I was surprised the mayo is of Helman's ilk vs one from the robot coup (that's a food processor).\\n\\nIt is indeed beef day at our table. The house burger is made from the trimmings of fine cuts and fat basted while it cooks to your desired temp. It's as satisfying as you want a burger to be. Unadorned in all its glory.\\n\\nThe woodroast steak sandwich almost tastes light despite the drape of gruyere. The ciabatta roll is so full of airy pockets yet sturdy enough to show the beef who the boss is. Tender, flavorful and all around fulfilling. \\n \\n\\nThere is a salted caramel brownie sundae on the menu that is a must. The caramel is homey delicious and fresh dense whipped cream makes it feel like comfort in a glass. Shame about that chemical laden cherry on top. Easy enough to toss off then again what is a sundae with no cherry?\\n \\n\\nI am here at lunchtime and noise level is minimal despite a full house.  I imagine when the bar is full and diners are full of libations that the noise level doubles but this is mere speculation.

They have the most uh-may-zing mashed sweet potatoes.  Each bite is a perfect blend of sweet and savory and they complemented the fried shrimp and oysters so well.  Collard greens were all right (seriously, who is focusing on greens when you visit a place known for their comfort food?), but I'd skip their mac-n-cheese next time.  Fried green tomatoes were perfect - crunchy on the outside and then a burst of juicy tomato once you make it past the breaded exterior.  \\n\\nThis was $18, but their portions are HUGE so there is plenty to go around.

The wait wasn't long either.\\n\\nI got the \\"stimulus package\\" milkshake (whynatte, vodka shnapps etc.) it was quite tasty and resembles a mint chocolate chip milkshake. I am excited that whynatte is gaining ground in ATL, but thats a different story/review. \\n\\nMy burger was one of the standards with blue cheese and bacon. Everything was delicious, and the burger was cooked well.

I would give this place ten stars if I could. The meat and fish section in the back is probably the best I've ever been to when you consider quality and price. Lobsters and steaks for ridiculous prices and at ridiculous quality! Everything back there is somehow half the price of the grocery stores or less and most of it isn't pre-packaged or anything. Chicken breast, chicken quarters, chicken wings, ground beef, pork chops, steaks, mussels, fish - you name is, Lambert's has it, and at a deal (it feels like things are always on sale). Plus, the people that work there are extremely friendly. \\n\\nIn addition to the meat and seafood section (which draws me in every time), they have fresh produce which is often cheaper than the local Stop & Shop or Shaw's. The prepared foods are solid (especially the chowder - which is difficult to match up with here in Boston). Then they have this imported juice named Exotic (which isn't cheap) which is to die for - I've never seen it sold anywhere else, but take one sip and you'll never touch that Tropicana crap ever again. \\n\\nAll of this is so amusing since it's sort of lodged in the back of this POS Puritan Mall that should have been bulldozed decades ago.

The best part of the menu (they've probably learned over the years that people often have a difficult time making decisions) is that they offer a number of combos where you get a smaller portion of two or three different menu items.

We were recommended to check out Union Oyster House by the hotel's concierge and she also mentioned it's Boston's oldest restaurant.  So we walked over to Union St, and put our name in and had a 15-20 min wait.  We sat at the bar and I tried the Sam Adams Brick Red (which I've never seen in DC bars) which was good.  We finally got called and seated and ordered our lunch.  I got the Crabcakes with Newburg Sauce, which is a creamy Sherry sauce, which was just delicious!  I got the platter, so it came with 2 crab cakes, rice pilaf and veggies.  I tried my hardest to finish everything, but there were a few bites I had to sacrifice and leave on the plate.

The table ordered a bunch of oysters and all of them were good. I ordered an oyster slider appetizer and it was delicious.\\n The dinners we ordered were a mixed bag. The person who ordered the Shrimp Marsala  enjoyed his dinner but the people with the Herb Crusted Cod and the Grilled Salmon just ate their fish and ignored the stuff surrounding them. Even though I LOVE seafood, I didn't like the combinations of flavors and sides so I ordered a hamburger because nothing really appealed to me on the menu. I ordered it medium and it came out well done. I didn't want to make a fuss and send it back at someone's party and ate it anyway. The slice of  artisanal maple bacon was delicious, but the glob of melted Cabot Cheddar had no flavor. My fries were a little over salted and I brushed each one off and dipped them into the honey butter on the table for the bread which was delicious. The two people who ordered the Fish and Chips both said it was terrible and they were on opposite ends of the table and weren't able to compare until after dinner. They both said the batter was too thick and tasteless and the fish inside was mushy. My husband complained that his tartar sauce tasted mostly like mayonnaise with some dill with maybe a splash of vinegar. I chopped the pickles from my hamburger plate and added it to his tartar sauce and fixed it up. Not so hard right? All in all, the food should have been a lot better not only for the prices they charge, but compared to much less expensive restaurants who put out better food at a lower price point. The wine and beer menu were excellent. Unless I was just having oysters and a beer, I wouldn't come back. \\n I mostly rate restaurants solely on the food. The rest of  my review is simply my observations for informational purposes only. It was a Saturday night and the restaurant was packed. The service was fine. It was too loud to hear what the person two down from you was saying. One other small thing of note is that I am currently using a walker and have mobility issues. When I made the long walk to the bathroom, the handicapped stall was locked with nobody in it. I left the walker outside of the regular stalls hoping not to block access for other people. I hope they will address and fix this situation for people with even larger mobility issues than I have. By the way, the hand soap is a very strong and smells like citronella. It leaves way too much smell on your hands for a restaurant.

We went here for breakfast tacos, since Curra's is now closed (why, God, why?!?). The chips had the most pronounced oily aftertaste. It was like sucking on 1040. The salsa was pretty good, but hard to ignore what it was on. We had bacon, egg and potato tacos, pretty standard; the bacon was so old and tough we had to tear it up in order to eat it, and each taco had 2 small squares of potato. I also ordered a pancake which tasted ok but was undercooked. Service was pretty good if slightly indifferent. (The hostess yawned and waved us in the direction of the dining room, seat yourself I guess.) As a replacement for Curra's, Elsi's falls woefully short, but it might be ok for lunch or dinner."},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"After moving from Hawaii to Maine, we have been in search of a good ramen place since.

Okay, nothing new there, really, since, unless you go out of your way to go to a vegetarian restaurant, you'll likely be limited to one or two pasta dishes as your choice at any non-asian restaurant.

This is SO LAUGHABLE because it includes EXACTLY ONE truly vegetarian entree option, which is, of course, not even close to vegan, since it's a Wild Mushroom Lasagna (as of this writing, I'm assuming the menu changes seasonally, but you get the drift). Sure, there are plenty of salad options, but the rest of the entree choices on the \\"VEGETARIAN\\" menu include such delights as \\"smoked chicken,\\" \\"braised baby clams,\\" and \\"hazelnut encrusted salmon.\\" \\n\\nNow, I'm not a vegetarian, but I've played one on TV, and let me tell you this shit don't fly when you're really someone who doesn't eat things that used to have faces or mothers (I know, I know...

I don't tend to eat much meat, and 9 times out of 10 when I'm eating out I opt for the vegetarian meal (meat-based dishes are always DOMINATED by the meat in the US, leaving only a slight smattering of afterthought vegetables on the side), so that's why I keep an eye on this stuff. \\n\\nSo, final synopsis...

However, from then on she seemed very grumpy, when we ordered she would leave abruptly without letting us finish, twice. I still had a quarter of my cocktail left and she took it away I mentioned politely if I could just finish it quick, since I was paying $6 for it and she had the nerve to say, \\"oh did you want a sip of water from that?\\" Completely uncalled for and rude especially considering that whole night we were friendly with her and hadn't complained about her horrible service. My boyfriend was not too happy and expressed that to her and she kept repeating, \\"the customer isn't always right.\\" Which of course I agree with but working in customer service you should NEVER say that to a customer.

Sat at the bar and ordered the flight. Wendy was pretty friendly and offered us some options for dinner near by. We ended up going to PokPok, but appreciated the suggestions. The beer was just ok. Don't get me wrong, they were all pretty great in their own ways, but not drinkable to me. I was excited about the little dog tasters, I like the thought of brewers experimenting with small batches of stuff. The one tasted like bong water and the other tasted unfinished. My thought was, hey they're small batches, its ok they're experimenting. Until Wendy informed us that the little dogs were the starter/earlier stages of two beers they already make. Not so exciting. \\n\\nI will say the food was good. I had the small plate of pickled vegetables, which were pretty amazing. The clean flavor cut through the beer nicely. The bread was nice too.

A popular restaurant that doesn't take reservation? Typical. I thought I could swing by, scribble my name on the waitlist, and grab a cup of coffee nearby while waiting for a table to become available. Boy, was I wrong! \\n\\nWhen I arrived around 11 am on a Saturday morning in a group of three, I immediately saw a line winding through the door. It was a cold wintery morning. After getting lost and multiple detours on our way, we were all famished. I volunteered to find out the wait time, only to discover that there is no hostess. The restaurant runs on a self-serve system, in which you physically wait in line to place your order. Only after you get your food can you sit down and pig out. I tried to work my way through the crowd to get a sense of the wait, but it was nearly impossible. Determined to see what the hype was about, my friends and I chose to wait what came to be almost an hour. \\n\\nI was born with a sweet tooth. Naturally I ordered the Fresh Caramel and Banana French Toast. It consisted of 3 slices of toasts. They were grilled to golden perfection -- the edges were a little crunchy but the center was soft and airy. The toasts were topped with fresh, sliced bananas, and drizzled with caramel and powdered sugar. The fluffy toasts soaked up the caramel perfectly -- they were just the right texture, not too soggy. The caramel was rich and not overly sweet. Every bite was oh so delightful. In the end, I devoured it all, and my belly thanked me happily. \\n\\nMy friends, on the other hand, each ordered the 222 -- 2 eggs, 2 sausages, and 2 pancakes. They came in generous portions with a few slices of toasts and home fries on the side. My friends were full and satisfied. They also enjoyed the freshly squeezed orange juice. I was on a health kick and decided to have plain H2O instead. \\n\\nI would give the food a solid 5. The service style was interesting and unique. I wasn't certain whether I should tip since it's mostly self-served, but I did anyway. IMO, the restaurant was rather small to accommodate the mass of loyal customers. The line never cease to die down. We were seated in a corner, and the line of people was moving right pass by me in close contact. I wished the place was a bit more roomy, so I could have more personal space to comfortably enjoy my food. We also felt bad to linger, so we left immediately after we finished our meals to give up our seats. \\n\\nOverall it was a pleasant experience dining here. Was it worth the wait?

The Launderette sign outside is really awesome.  We didn't have to wait and the hostess does the seating at the long bar. It's not first come, first served.\\n\\nWe had the Ravenswood cocktail and a Manhattan to start.  The Ravenswood was served on the rocks and it is similar to an Old Fashion.  The Cynar gave the cocktail\\na nice bitterness.  The Manhattan was served as a martini.  I thought it was also a well made drink.  I would have tried more from their cocktail list, but we decided to order a bottle of wine.  The wine list had a nice selection and the bottles were fairly priced.\\n\\nWe started with the fried olives.  If you don't like anchovies, you may want to steer clear since the olives are served with an anchovy aioli.  If you like olives and anchovies, I think this is a good starter.  We also had the fries and the 2 dipping sauces were terrific and the fries were perfectly cooked.\\n\\nNext, we had the mussels and Wow....What a nice dish.! The mussels were meaty and the sauce was a nice balance of wine, jalape√±o, ham, and plain old goodness.  I would definitely order again.  The burger was decent.  We really aren't into burgers that are rare (I know a lot of people swear that's where the flavor is at) and the first burger was too pink for us.  They were kind enough to try again and the second was much better.  I don't think we'd order it again, though.  There's too many other things to try on the menu.\\n\\nWe ended with the signature birthday cake ice cream bar and it was really good and decadent.  It takes a lot for me to get dessert and this one was worth it.  They also gave us complimentary ice cream (aka love from the kitchen) and that was equally delicious!  We enjoyed both with a nice cup of coffee.  They serve Stumptown and it was a perfect ending.\\n\\nI also want to say we never felt rushed to leave and everyone at the bar was very nice and enjoyable to be around.

The popular tots were just barely warm, the Blackened Chicken Caesar Salads were a disappointment, and the bleu cheese dressing for the Cob Salad was tasteless, runny, and Getty. In fact, I suspect the bleu cheese dressing is made with cottage rather than bleu cheese, bottled commercial dressing would have been an improvement.  Seriously disappointed, the chicken is prepared with spicy combo premix, it's just spicy and salty, the chicken was cooked perfectly, it was moist and tender, sadly the spice rub detracted from the chicken rather than enhancing. Again, the Caesar dressing was bland and lifeless, no lemon or garlic flavors to be found. Due to the wildly successful popularity of McMenamin's I expected well prepared, fresh, and above average service and food, but we could have easily gone to Red Robin for the exact same meal. The service was extraordinarily slow, but our server freely admitted that he was a bartender filling in, he was doing his best, nice guy, but a server he was not. When our dining companion complained about the chicken, he just explained that that's what blackened chicken was, didn't offer another option, and when you're playing $14 for a salad you expect more. The Kennedy school itself is beautiful and fun, the grounds are spectacular, but I would avoid the restaurant unless you're staying there then the convenience might offset the disappointment. I would have given the restaurant one star, but the ambience bumped it up to two. Go for a beer, enjoy the place but spend your dining dollars elsewhere, there a so many amazing dining experiences awaiting you outside McMenamin's."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I can admit it when I'm wrong, I have a lot of practice at it...\\n\\nAndina, I'm sorry, I was WRONG!

That's when my life changed.\\n\\nDamn. That's one word to describe this place. The ambience inside is like a bar: dark and dim. But we sat on the outside patio which is brighter and the cooling fans made it less humid. We ordered the large pizza which is just enough for 3 healthy people. I really liked #6, which is the ricotta/sausage/peppers pizza. I sprinkled mine with the red pepper flakes and the dried oregano and some black pepper. The instruction in the menu, if you paid attention Glen Coco, is to fold the pizza lengthwise like any NY-style pizza. When I took my first bite: damn. You know the food's good when you decided not to talk for 5 minutes after the first bite. Sausage and peppers are spot on tasty and the milky ricotta just cools the spiciness down. The crust (or the bones) of the slice is crispy and not too chewy. Perfect slice, bruh.\\n\\nWill definitely recommend to friends.

There is enough variety on the menu to please any age group and I have frequently entertained clients at the restaurant because of the pleasant Portland atmosphere.\\n\\nMy main problem with the Cadillac Caf√© today is that although my diet has changed, along with many folks who live in Northeast Portland, the offerings at the Cadillac Caf√© have not kept up with healthy dining trends. It is almost impossible to get a good vegan meal at this  excellent restaurant.\\n\\nGiven that a growing percentage of the population favors a plant-based diet, it would be excellent for this restaurant to consider making meals available which do not rely heavily on dairy and meat for their success and taste. I used to be able to come to this restaurant and feel like I could order anything. Now I feel very frustrated that I can't rely on this restaurant to make me a decent meal given my current dietary concerns..\\n\\nCome on Cadillac Caf√©. You need to pick on offering more than the occasional plate of hummus. It's important to learn the differences between the vegan diet, the gluten-free diet, and the vegetarian diet. Any restaurant in Portland should be able to offer tasty options for all three of these groups at this point."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Norio & Kristie truly made this a memorable experience.

The chocolate coating and the Raspberry paste that squirts out when you bite into it, just calls for another bite. The pretzel that is stabbed into the doughnut is a good break from the huge doughnut, but once you eat it, you want to finish it.

Coupled with photographs of family and Vietnam, the environment gave you a real good idea of exactly the kind of food you would be treated to.\\n\\nThe menu is small, and it's very tapas-oriented. We chose 4 dishes to share, which all promptly showed up at the same time, maximizing the sharing potential.\\n\\nThe rau ram salad was deliciously fresh. Shredded and lightly dressed with a sweet peanut dressing, it went perfectly with the rare lemon beef dish we ordered. Pretty much a vietnamese carpaccio, the cold, thin beef, swimming in a slightly sweet, but overall tart dressing really complimented the sweet crunchiness of the salad. I loved the giant, seemingly home made prawn cracker that came on top of the salad.\\n\\nThe beef short ribs were also excellent. Buttery fat glazed each piece of perfectly charred meat. When I think of beef short ribs, I immediately think of galbi, but this was a bit different. I'm so used to the sweet soy sauce marinade, that I've come to expect that sort of flavour on grilled beef ribs. But these ribs were slightly spicy, only a bit sweet, and so wonderfully BBQ'd.\\n\\nFinally, there were the \\"rice paper summer rolls\\". I pretty much just expected your regular salad rolls, overstuffed with rice vermicelli and lettuce, but these were nothing like that. Sure, they had the same ingredients, but in such a perfect proportion to each other. Delicately wrapped in soft, translucent blankets of rice paper, I absolutely adored the basil leaves and deep fried crunchy garlic. These rolls were taste and texture heaven. Chewy, crunchy, and soft. Aromatic, savory and sweet.\\n\\nOverall, Devon and I ate until we were comfortably full, for just under $40. The prices were comparable to any other tapas restaurant, but unlike some tapas restaurant, you're not left wondering why you're paying $9 for a tiny plate of food.\\n\\nI obviously can't comment on the drink menu or the dessert menu, as I don't drink alcohol, and we had bought Beard Papas for dessert.

Lots to say- from the errors in my first review (ie, unless the fish and chips really was haddock then, though it's cod now...) - to taking my parents for a visit I thought they'd love, to trying different menu items and more.\\n\\nFirst, I am kinda sorta between a 3.5* and a 4+* - so the subjective CN algorithm settles on a 4.*\\n\\nThis could be a mini-novel, so know you were warned.\\n\\nThe service was great- Adam has a good personality, and while he was a bit long-winded, he did a great job with details and such (he stopped juuust short of describing everything on the menu and saying \\"it's all good,\\") and his presence was consistent but not intrusive. A perfect approach since I think it was obvious the three of us were focused on each other and having great conversation.\\n\\nThe food was kind of up and around. They still have those delicious rolls - yay! I liked the yellow tail starter (the pineapple mixed with the fish was great), and we loved Dad's fried oysters. I have always been wary of any kind of oysters, raw or fried- but loved the kind of parmesan/sesame (?) crust and the wonderful sauce. I would definitely get these again. Dad's entree choice was also a winner - the trout was deliciously tender and well-flavored. I only got a small bite (he'd have given me more but it would have been selfish to ask) and I would definitely get this next time. The ice cream cookie sandwich was delicious as our dessert- we all enjoyed the peanut butter ice cream/oatmeal cookie package (I think I got that combo right- we did have a lot of food...) was perfect with the not-cloying pb ice cream and the soft-ish cookies...\\n\\nMom got the fish and chips people highly love (and my friends tried last time). Mixed reviews here. If I recall correctly, a few years ago the \\"chips\\" were fries not potato wedges; the current po-tah-to version is decent, not that mushy-center-kind, but ... not as good as frites. The cod was lightly battered and ok-flavored, and still a very generous portion. I did like their version of a tartar sauce with a twist. Overall - impressive because it is a large dish but probably something I would just try once. I did not enjoy my grouper. I decided to go with it vs the hangar steak (I'd been in the mood for that, but thought I'd keep in the seafood theme since I had steak last time), and thought it would be a tender, simple entree with the lemon, olive oil and rosemary (?). The flavor just wasn't quite enough but more noticeably, it was just too tough. My parents love hush puppies and thought these were ok, yet surprisingly sweet; my Mom is no rube but she did remark \\"wonder if these are meant more as a dessert...\\" I love mushrooms but there was just something uninspired by these. Not tough, not soft, not well seasoned (Adam explained that each type is cooked separately, bc different types need different cook times...I didn't know this so, hmm...), overall just ok; I'd try the asparagus next time.\\n\\nAnd, to wrap up the not-so-great part, this is a place that does not have s&p shakers on the table. In general, I dislike this. I know chefs season dishes as they design best; I also know that palates differ. It is correct in my Southern debutante country club world to taste your food before adding more seasoning, esp s&p, but it is just plain ugly for a request for such to be met with a harrumph-y look. Just sayin'.\\n\\nI do enjoy all of Mr Fry's restaurant and am glad we went for a (kinda important - my daddy just turned 70, y'all) family dinner. As I said, food was up and down, and I was leaning toward a three, and kind of wondered if the newer concepts like K+D and more recently St Cecilia were a distraction...\\n\\nBut. While I very much dislike being charged for mandatory valet, I understand that parking is a challenge with the lot situation. However, it's not cool for a valet to have a pen or something in his back pocket and leave a streak across your very light grey leather seat. Here's where the 4+* comes in: my mom was talking with the valet - in her Southern (and unnecessarily apologetic) way- while he tried (unsuccessfully) to rub the stain out. I slipped out the backseat to get a manager. I calmly asked and got him (amazing what being polite and direct will get you) and explained. He came out and talked with us and simply said that what happened wasn't ok; he was glad we came to him and would both make a report for the restaurant's records and for the valet company's use - and asked my mother to please take it to a detailer of her choice and they would cover the expense (he meant it because he asked for our information to make sure all was covered). I didn't even have to mention I was a Yelper (and therefore would be elite-y and promptly write a review). Handled with class.\\n\\nFinal answer for $1000, Alex? Solid. Glad to live down the street. Will definitely have a boy take me for a nice dinner - and have some of those dishes I enjoyed....and give some others a shot."},{"name":"Bistro Verde","address":"799 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This is not your father's department store restaurant.\\n\\nNordstrom comes out guns blazing with a credible competitor to the local restaurant scene.

I had the longest lunch of my life here this past Friday. It's smaller than I expected, which is fine, but the seating process is a little convoluted. There is a small clipboard next to the door on which you place your name and the number in your party. Even though there were seats available at the bar, we just waited as no direction was given or signage to indicate that you had to wait to be seated. \\n\\nWe were finally seated and then had to wait for quite a while to have our drink order taken, and another waiting session before our food orders were placed. By the time our food came out, we had been there nearly an hour. I consider myself a pretty patient person, and I try to give people/restaurants the benefit of the doubt, but this was really freakin' long. Since it's just diner food and doesn't take a long prep time, I suspect this is due to them appearing to be understaffed. The food was good; nothing noteworthy or different from their other locations, but just solid simple items. \\n\\nThe location is awesome, the new space is clean and sharp.

We had asked for fried eggs but she came back and said they only had scrambled because they were out of eggs.  I thought maybe they only had a vat of pre-scrambled eggs but my coworker had the better guess.  They gave us eggs that had been precooked some time ago.  The country fried boar and the hash browns were very good but the eggs were dry and well past their prime.  A restaurant of this quality shouldn't make moves like that.

The place is so tiny, every time I wanted to change my mind I had to go outside.  We sat at the bar, nearest to the oven.  I thought come August, the heat of the oven may be a bit of an issue, but our server said that the space has an A/C unit that can cool a much bigger space, so things will probably be OK.  I like the abundance of daylight.\\n\\nWe had the octopus & blood orange \\"salad\\", roasted brussel sprouts, and the white anchovy & olives pizza.  We liked the octopus salad but thought the taste could be a tiny bit bolder, perhaps a touch more acidity.  I loved the sprouts, my SO not so much.  I enjoyed the crispy bits of pancetta and the hearty pungent pecorino counterpunching the slight bitterness of the sprouts.\\n\\nThe pizza was a mixed bag.  The crust was well developed and had great flavor.  One of the chefs assured me that they ferment the dough at least 24 hours.  The crust ended up a bit charred in spots, but I think reducing oven time to avoid charring would not have resulted in the necessary crispness in the rest of the crust.  A  few quick scrapes took care of the charred bits.\\n\\nThe pizza's topping was an acquired taste.  It was a bit light on the olives and tomato front.  The anchovies acted the bullies on the block.   More olives and cherry tomatoes would have made for a much more peaceful and tasty neighborhood.\\n\\nWe had the ricotta \\"cheesecake\\" (and an espresso for me) for dessert.  The \\"cheesecake\\" was a great twist on the \\"normal\\":  it's in a little glass jar with a wire bail lid,  the creme on the bottom, topped with berries and lumps of graham crumb crust.  The cheesecake was supremely creamy and smooth; the cherries had just enough syrup on them to dial down their tartness/sourness.

I went to the counter and ordered a double espresso while perusing the breakfast offerings. I was craving some breakfast tacos, so I ordered the veggie chorizo tacos. I found a small caf√© table in the \\"side car\\" section, a small room of about eight tables. The room is lined with aluminum siding and the light fixtures are adorned with bent silverware. The Beatles and Stevie Wonder pump through the stereo as the Baby Boomer patrons sing along.\\n\\nAs I settled into my seat and fired up my laptop, I sampled my espresso. Much to my disappointment, it was cold and tasted terrible. I don't know how much of this was by design; maybe the flavor was a matter of taste not geared to my liking...the temperature was not acceptable of any \\"hot\\" coffee drink, however.\\n\\nA few moments later, the staff brought out my veggie chorizo tacos which were EASILY the best breakfast tacos I've ever had. Good God were these things delicious! The cheese, eggs, chorizo, wheat tortillas and salsa were sooooooo damn good. A perfect start to my morning. The kitchen staff has started a random sequence of yawps in the name of good nonsense. When I was finished, a guy around my age (31) wearing a hat that looked like a bear's head and a sparkly shirt, cleared the plates. I love how this is commonplace in Austin. As in my hometown of New Orleans, I believe every one should have the right to play dress-up and make-believe whenever the hell they want. The hat may have served more of a functional role, though, because it's COLD.\\n\\nThe side car is frigid. This section feels like it was an add-on or an afterthought to the original caf√©. Very drafty. There's a back patio, which I'm sure is great in warm weather.\\n\\nI wish this place was closer to my house in Hyde Park, but maybe one day I'll be living in the 78704 and I can enjoy veggie chorizo tacos on the regular.\\n\\n**EDIT**\\nAs someone previously mentioned, the owner contacted me as she is very concerned about anything that her customers don't feel is up to snuff.

I really want to like it but the bad experiences just make me not want to go back. \\n\\nPros:\\n- Atmosphere - a great building that has been redone inside, different from typical - Atlanta seafood joints\\n- Nice servers\\n- The Beignet-Style Hushpuppies are to die for!\\n- Some of the other dishes are great as well (Fried rice, fish sandwich, long bean appetizer)\\n\\nCons:\\n- Often Pretentious\\n- Overpriced, under-portioned\\n- Charged a higher price than what was on the menu for a meal\\n- 10% \\"gratuity\\" added to our $400 bill because we brought in a small birthday cake\\n- The Oyster Bar will not serve many items from the main restaurant\\n\\nThe first time I ventured to The Optimist was a Wednesday for lunch shortly after it opened.  The place was practically empty yet service was slow.  We had drinks and ordered the Beignet-style hushpuppies as an appetizer.  These alone will make you go back even if the food is grossly overpriced and under-portioned.  Our lunch was delicious but a joke in how small it was.  We think American-portions are usually way too big so I look forward to properly sized portions in nicer establishments -- but this was entirely too small.  I left feeling like I needed to have lunch afterwards.  My husband had a lobster roll/wrap that he was overcharged for (and didn't realize until we had left so we didn't bother bringing it up).  It was the size of a small hotdog on a bun, about two bites.  The french fries were the small mini-stick variety like the dried kind you'd get out of a can at a grocery store.  They were extremely difficult to eat and left much to be desired.  I would expect a delicous fresh-cut flavorful fry from a place like this.  My fish sandwich was absolutely delicious with flavors unique but not too out-there.  Again, the portion size was just a few bites.  I'd guess about 3-4oz of fish max.  It was like getting a big slider appetizer.  But there was only one on the plate.    \\n\\nThe second visit was to the Oyster Bar on a Sunday afternoon/evening.  We met clients there and stayed a good while.  It was a comfortable, casual yet nice environment.  Uninformed at our previous visit that the \\"Oyster bar is a separate restaurant from the main restaurant and they do not serve the same food\\"  I had been raving to our clients about the hushpuppies.  It was a great disappointment to learn they would not serve us what we came for unless we moved to the restaurant.  We were already comfortable and had part of our order already in.... the server thought the chef/management may make an exception... but it turns out they did not.  Instead, I had to go to the bar in the other room, order a drink and our hushpuppy order \\"to go\\" and then bring it back to our table at the Oyster Bar.   Any place that charges $6 for 6 pieces of fried dough you think would be willing to make an exception to their self-imposed rules and walk our order an extra 20 feet.  I had to wait 25 minutes at the bar away from the rest of our group.\\n\\nThe third visit was a Thursday night for dinner, party of 7.  We made a reservation and when we showed up at 5PM the restaurant was nearly empty.  Even with a reservation we had to \\"wait while we get your table ready.\\"  Hu??  I guess they want us to wait long enough to spend some money at the bar first?  That's the vibe I got.    We started off the meal with a bottle of bubbly to celebrate us 7 local small business owners getting through the holiday rush.  We ordered long beans (delicious tempora-battered fried green beans with a dipping sauce) and the hushpuppies as an appetizer.  Our party ordered a variety of entrees, soups, and seafood appetizers.  No complaints on the taste but everything was small portions except the fish & chips which was enough to split.  We also got an array of what they claim should be \\"family style\\" sides at $6/each.  All of these were very good, but somewhat small portions if meant to be shared.  3 of the 7 were celebrating birthdays so we brought a small homemade cake, plates, and serving utensils.   The server later brought us our check and we noticed 10% gratuity already added, so we added 10% more to make it 20%.  As we were leaving the server informed us the \\"10% gratuity\\" was actually a \\"cake cutting fee.\\"  Hu?  No one cut our cake nor served it it us.  We certainly were not informed it would cost $35 for us to eat our cake there.  Happy birthday to us, right!?  We spoke to the manager on the way out as we didn't want the server to get stuck with only a 10% tip and her excuse was the server should have told us about the fee in advance.  I was thinking of going here again in a week for my actual birthday, but I don't think I'll be returning.  They took away the festive spirit of an otherwise wonderful evening.  The Buckhead Life Group Establishments, Canoe, Rays, or Fifth Group Restaurants all have seafood and service that surpass that of The Optimist...."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I am so disappointed to see that Voodoo currently shows only 3.5 stars right now.  What's going on people?! Have you lost your minds???  I was one of the hesitant people that didn't want to like Voodoo, I really didn't.  With all of the hype and discussion about it being a tourist trap, I just assumed it would be a waste of time.  I am not even a doughnut person, although I have tried many.  Well, I am now.  One evening, when out with a good friend, we were in the area and saw a short line, so we went for it. She had lived Portland for a year, and me, less than two months at the time.  I figured I needed to check the box.  First of all, the doughnuts are complete eye candy.  For anybody impressed by funky designs and bold colors, they are a feast for the eyes.  There are so many to choose from as well, and it can be overwhelming, especially if you're hoping for a perfect match.  I settled on a cake doughnut covered with white icing, topped by crushed Oreos.  All I have to see it was heaven at first bite.  I couldn't believe it.  Before I could exhale, I was nearly finished.  I just couldn't help myself.  I went back another time with an out-of-town guest that was recently visiting.  I made myself try something entirely different.  It was a marshmallow-creme filled doughnut, topped with a chocolate frosting.  Again, I thought I died and went to Nirvana.  Every bite, every morsel was perfect.  I will go there again and again, proud Portlander that I am.  Now, if you are not the kind of person that likes your desserts incredibly sweet, this is not the place for you.

I have an infant and a four-year-old, so getting out for the night is tough--I was as elated as a teen on prom night. It's hard to find, down a dark alley, and the complimentary valet service was pretty sweet. My very kind valet promised he wouldn't judge me based on the half-eaten Slim Jim's and Frozen stickers littering the car. I lived in San Francisco for six years and can say with some authority that this is a swanky, cool, gorgeously designed joint. Very big and open, forgiving red lights, all that. I told the bartender I don't drink much; he asked what I liked, and I told him I'm into drinks with stuff like cilantro and basil and lime. Asking no more questions, he whipped up a delish drink that could very well have been my dinner. The salmon chips were exquisite, one of those dishes where you can't quite wrap yourself around what all it is, but you know it's sublime. I took the scallops and mussels to go, to share with my husband who opted to stay home on baby duty and marathon Treme. It was pretty good, the fat scallops in creamy, spicy, perfect grits. But not $26 good. And the mussels didn't knock my socks off either. It's not their fault really. Atlanta is prob too landlocked for great seafood. So yeah, maybe ask your server what the best of the best dishes are before you go. One more thing about this place, the staff is cool, but they don't treat you like they're doing you a favor by gracing you with their company.

The lengua was tender, the veggies crisp, and I was happy.\\n\\nWhat the tacos might have slightly lacked in complexity was more than made up for by the freshness of everything. The salsa was just-right-spicy, studded with little flecks of roasted peppers and fresh tomatoes and all other such good things; it stood out as the best part of the meal, memorable because it's too often an afterthought at too many taco spots. And the menu was just the kind of lengthy tome I love, full of other favorites like sopes, gorditas, and tortas (plus several specifically vegetarian options).

I will be as bold as to say that it's possibly a top-3 in my book, and definitely somewhere in the top-5.  Frankly, it could be the cream of the crop, I've admittedly not gone and had much to compare to any time recently.\\n\\nBut when the day is over, it's still ramen, and ramen is typically one of those kinds of foods that is synonymous with cost-efficiency, and a level of comfort in its relative ease of availability.  We've all made the jokes that a dollar could get you enough Maruchan for a month; I'm not saying that Jinya's quality is anything remotely close to instant ramen, but I'm also puzzled how I'm dropping $25 for a ramen dinner.\\n\\nAnyway, Jinya is located in Sandy Springs at the corner of Hammond Drive and Roswell Road.  It's barely a mile off of I-285, in a shopping center anchored by a Lowe's Home Improvement, and it's tucked into the corner of a small strip at the Hammond-side of the road.  That being said, depending on the time of the day, getting to Jinya will be impossible, or less impossible, since this is where some of the worst traffic sometimes occurs.\\n\\nIf you're local to Atlanta and listen to the radio, you've undoubtedly heard the monotone radio spots for Deeeeee Gellar-and-Son; this is one of their locations it's next to, and it's their pretentious parking spaces that you _won't_ be allowed to park in.  Also, there's another restaurant in the same strip that has valet parking, and their attendants will obnoxiously place cones in vacant spots so their lazy valets will only have to park the car 10 feet away instead of 30.  Long story short, parking is sparse, and might be difficult to get.\\n\\nAs an establishment, Jinya itself is not large at all.  There are probably like 6-7 tables, a bar, and outdoor seating.  Fortunately for my visit, there were two open spaces at the bar immediately, I didn't have to deal with any wait.  Service is extremely polite and friendly, always with a smile and more than eager to make sure our seats were clean and properly prepped.  The interior is modern with little touches of flora and dark surfaces with gray walls, which is kind of synonymous with most Asian eateries these days.\\n\\nThe menu is not at all large or complex, with a modest variety of soups and ramen, as well as a variety of starters.  I went with a Jinya bun as well as the tempura fried brussel sprouts because I was hungry and wanted to eat a lot of food before even getting my ramen, believing that it would be paltry and inadequate at filling me up.\\n\\nThe pork in the bun is generous and well seasoned, but I guess I just got poor luck of the cut, and got nearly almost nothing but the blobby fat part.  It tasted good sure, but the minute amount of meat was a little bit of a turn-off.  The fried sprouts were good, but if I'm being honest, I probably wouldn't order them again at its price point.\\n\\nAnd finally I get to the ramen, which I ordered the spicy tonkotsu.  At first, I was critical of the lack of spiciness, but by the time I got to my first refill of water, it occurred to me that their broth had a very slow burn that creeps up and starts to cause the sweats before you realize that you're having them.  The pork is tender and very flavorful, and I appreciate that they don't dump a whole lot of other things into the bowl other than the noodles, pork and some sprouts; it's way less distracting overall.\\n\\nThe thing that truly separates Jinya from all the other ramen joints in the city is the broth, though.  Lots of places have decent broth, but it's kind of soupy and runny.  Jinya's broth on the other hand, is the epitome of hearty and savory, and with a thickness that I've never seen anywhere else.  It's like slurping an extremely tasty and flavorful pork loin in liquid form, it's that meaty and again, savory.\\n\\nIn the end, I'm absolutely stuffed full of noodles and broth, and I'm regretful for ordering two starters.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, Jinya's food is definitely top-notch.  But it's still at the base of things, a ramen experience, and even without any booze, I still rang up a little over $25.  The starters are good, but a little on the high end of the spectrum, and at $12, the ramen is a little bit higher than some competitors off the top of my head.  It's great food undoubtedly, but sometimes I just want a cheap satisfying meal, and Jinya might not fall into that classification.\\n\\nOverall, the experience was great.  Jinya's a cozy place to eat good food, and their ramen is definitely top-tier.  The service is fantastic and friendly, and their location, traffic pending, is fairly convenient.  The price point is a tad upper-echelon, but at least you're getting upper-echelon quality food for what you're paying.\\n\\nWould come back again, easily."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Based on the reviews, we were expecting a better experience.

Jinya is another imported food establishment, this time from LA. Although you don't get that traditional Japanese vibe when you walk in, they do welcome you in a resounding welcome in Japanese, which reminds of what the folks at Shinsengumi (my benchmark for ramen) does when you leave the restaurant. \\n\\nFor starters the Jinya bun is scrumptious! Perfect way to start your meal. The takoyaki (octopus ball) is enough to feed a group of 3 or 4. It is also worth trying out, but beware it is very hot! I made the mistake of popping an entire ball in my mouth and committing to keeping it in my mouth. :x The caramelized cauliflowers are good--lightly seasoned, but curiously no sweet flavors that come out-- but at $6 are hard to justify. \\n\\nI ordered the cha-cha-cha because I love garlic, but perhaps I shouldn't have got it because it literally drowns out any flavor in the broth. However, to its credit it is the richest broth I've had. You can just feel it slime it's way through your mouth. Mm! It is a heavy broth so beware of the food coma that follows. The noodles are ok, but they admit that is not their focus.. they do say it's freshly made and aged for three days. The chashu pork is wonderful, love! The cha-cha-cha comes in a big hearty portion which is why it's also one of the most expensive ramens I've had.\\n\\nWent again and tried the tonkotsu black. The broth I feels like is still missing something. It's rich and it's good, but the seaweed flavor managed to subtly beat out the pork flavor. The pork is again wonderful and the egg is perfectly cooked for a delightful combination of soft egg, ramen, and broth. The thin noodles are okay I still would like it if it was a little firmer. The tonkotsu white with pork and chicken broth actually had more flavor as the chicken flavor came out great. I wish they gave you more broth so that you can order extra noodles. \\n\\nI feel wrong having to pay such amount for ramen, but when there's only a few other ramen alternatives it's reasonable. It's no Shinsengumi, but it's certainly a welcomed addition to the lacking ramen scene in Atlanta."},{"name":"Ms P's Electric Cock","address":"1101 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I really hoped this place would be better.

I thought they'd make actual Tandori chicken then shred that over the salad.  Disappointing to say the least.  I think the idea of Tandori salad is unique, but the execution was bad.  I looked over at the pizzas and they looked amazing so maybe I need to order that.  I think they could tweak somethings and have something unique and delicious.

Moments later the front manager came over and gave us a similar lecture insinuating that by making a reservation for 10 people we were under some sort of contractual obligation to tip.

This quaint and casually sophisticated cafe, rustic in decoration, has a menu built to satisfy the palate in every way!  My impromptu lunch venture today brought three friends together who had plenty to talk about but were constantly diverted to discussions and accolades over our dining selections.  I highly recommend this spot if you want a quick lunch, a longer, more relaxed one, or even for a simple dinner with a friend or date.  It's perfect!  No fuss.  No overwhelming menu.  Friendly service.  Delicious food.  This is my first review and just decided that I rate restaurants in this order of importance: food, setting, service. \\n\\nFood.  The menu is composed of a few options in the following categories: appetizers, sandwiches, salads, dessert, dessert drinks, wine, and beer - oh, and there is also a 4-option dinner menu and an all day breakfast.  Some could say that there aren't many options, but I welcome a dining experience that doesn't cause me to sit stumped, mulling over every menu item trying desperately to make a choice!  The lunch/dinner menu is primarily based on a variety of cheeses, nuts, veggies, relishes, and bread with a few meat and fish items in between. Three of us shared the \\"hummus, taboule, mesclun greens, olives\\" appetizer, and it was served with a side of sundried tomatoes (yummy) and assorted breads.  It was healthy, tasty, and filling - and we barely finished it.  Next, I had the \\"brie w/walnuts and apricot preserves\\" on an open-faced sandwich of whole wheat bread.  Wow!  So, good.  This probably wasn't the lightest choice on the menu, and I could have shared it since we had an appetizer, but it was well worth the full stomach. The cheeses here are so fresh (I tried friend's goat cheese salad too), so you have to be willing to indulge a little. We shared a bottle of chardonnay that was divine, just perfectly crisp on a hot day and paired well with our meal.  The bread here is fresh, and I think may be picked up from a local bakery.

The Blue Dahlia sits just east of I-35 on 11th St across from Victory Grill and holds a few tables out front, more small tables inside along with two long tables perfect for European-styled seating with other parties, and finally the option of cozy outdoor patio tables beneath a wooded lattice that covered a porch of flowering plants, lighting, and other art.  The setting is casual and romantic (perhaps depending on your mood and company). I didn't notice any music playing and usually I enjoy a nice aural ambiance; instead, there was a steady echo of multiple conversations at work throughout the airy dining area.  \\n\\nService.  Our server, Keisha, was fantastic!  She took our orders quickly and checked back a few times to make sure all was well. \\n\\nNext time: I will definitely be back to Blue Dahlia, maybe by myself,  maybe with friends again, or perhaps with my husband for dinner and wine on the patio.

Most every kind, however, this one at Mary Mac's was not very good - in my book. It is how I would describe a \\"curd\\" style mac n cheese. The pasta is cooked great and was perfectly textured. I also thought the flavor on the cheese baked on top was pretty good, even though I typically do not like cheese baked on top. The cheese inside, under the baked cheese, was curd like, chunky, not creamy. To each their own, but I will not order the mac again. \\n\\nThe atmosphere at Mary Mac's is wonderful.

Once you walk through the Prudential Center shopping mall, you reach a lobby where you must present identification to a security guard in order to access the elevators that take you to Top of the Hub. I found this process to be very off-putting as I have never in my life had to show my driver's license to enter a restaurant. \\n\\nWith respect to the food: The spicy lobster soup tasted fishy, was far too sweet (coconut milk?) and lacked any semblance of spice. The scallops were not bad, but the cannelini beans that they sat atop were practically raw. The pork chop that I ordered was so tough I could barely chew it, and the accompanying mac and cheese was vile; all I could taste was white wine and garlic. The blueberry upside down cake for dessert was dry and the whipped cream had melted which led me to believe that it had been sitting around for quite some time. \\n\\nWith respect to the service: Tom, our server, took our order and we didn't see him again until he dropped off the bill (a foodrunner served the dishes). Therefore, we never received offers for drink refills, or were asked how the meal was going. \\n\\nI voiced my concerns to Carlo the manager who promised that if I left my name, he would make sure that I received \\"exceptional\\" service the next time I visited.

However, for this first visit, I had the raspberry cooler. The drink was quite refreshing and good. Check out their drink menu online to see what else they have to offer.\\n\\nPrice: I only ordered from the 'Small' portion of the menu and those items were fairly priced-basically appetizers. The drinks offered are fairly priced as well-pretty standard for drinks in the Boston area.\\n\\nConclusion: My review should not sway you one way or another.

It came with crispy toasted flatbread (or was it pitabread?...) to dip. \\n\\nFor my main course, I had their White Polenta Fondutto which was really really nice. I loved this dish. The polenta was crispy on the outside and moist and melted on the inside. This went perfectly with the melted gorgonzola. The polenta cakes came with oven roasted tomatoes, giant capers (aka caperberries)  on a bed of ....I think it was arugula. The creaminess of the polenta cakes and gorgonzola created a dressing over the greens... MMMmmm.. The only thing about this dish is that the greens could've been very very lightly dressed with (again..) olive or grapeseed oil so it bridged the gap between the creamy polenta cakes and the dry, chalky greens. I have no complains about the flavors though. Everything was really good.\\n\\nSince everything else was so good, I was kind of disappointed with my dessert.

So instead, I played the best of both worlds. I enjoyed some cheap draughts and indulged in the Alligator Bites ($15). Though small in portion, these little \\"bites\\" pack a nice wave of flavor. With the texture of calamari (inside it's crispy exterior), it has a flavor very similar to chicken, but (in my opinion) more flavorful.\\n\\nThe bartenders are very NICE, and the music is very mellow.

It's a cute glass-walled restaurant tucked away in a neighborhood off of I-35. There was one spot left in the parking lot and the restaurant wasn't full, so recommend you car-pool or park on the street. But parking aside, I absolutely loved everything about the place - the different types of chairs, the slab-of-wood tables with yellow billy balls on top, the blues/whites/browns all around, and the smiling staff. It's chic with a southern comfort. I immediately told my bf that I want my kitchen to feel like this. The menu was simple boasting snack bites, grilled items, an array of veggies and specialties. \\n\\nSince I was in good foodie company, we shared a lot. I make my own labneh, so I had to try theirs with the beet hummus. I am also always in pursuit of the perfect spaghetti sauce and meatballs, so my bf knew to get Nonna's red sauce which had about 4-5 small meatballs - both were certainly great starters for the table. Next came the brick chicken with the cauliflower gratin and the brussel sprouts. Let me stop you right there. I despised brussel sprouts and cauliflower as a kid and now I think they're being overdone (did anybody else read that Austin Chronicle article about ingredient fatigue?), but these were fantastic! As the waitress said, the cauliflower was crunchy and oozing with cheesy goodness and I had a Julia Child moment where I paused and cherished the brussel sprouts with its bacon smokiness and pickled apples. I don't even want to try to imitate this recipe at home because I'd rather just go there and celebrate their vegetable genius. I also grabbed bites of my friends' charred broccolini and the frites with the various dips. The fennel sausage and the chicken were alright, but the veggies stole the show - and at a southern food restaurant?! Bravo!\\n\\nThe guys ran out of room before dessert, but women know better. Besides, with the previous courses being so good, I had to try one of their tamer desserts: a hazelnut layer cake with bananas, pralines and sour cream ice. Yum! You'll have to find out for yourself what the more innovative desserts were like. And the house was so nice, they threw in a few of their birthday cake ice cream sandwiches. These ain't your Bluebell ice cream sandwiches. You might think you don't have room, but you definitely do for those. Overall, it was a great place that I'm already looking for reasons to go there again, especially with my birthday around the corner *hint hint to my bf*.

Hospitable host. Best samosas I have ever had. Delicious goat curry and naan. Glad Brassica was closed."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I'll start by saying that I really want this place to succeed. It was opened recently by friends of a friend of mine. The night we visited, the owners were there working the house to ensure everything was running smoothly, checking on tables, even refilling water or running food when necessary. That's a good sign.\\n\\nNow, the nuts and bolts:\\n\\nPoor Calvin's is set as a fusion of Asian and American cuisine. I'd say there are varying degrees of success in reaching an actual fusion of the two. Our table began with two appetizers, the crispy duck egg rolls and fried green tomatoes with a goat cheese fritter (does not appear on the website's menu at this time). There was nothing spectacular about the egg rolls. They didn't strike me as too divergent from an egg roll I'd find at a Chinese takeout spot. There was definitely duck inside, but it didn't stand out. The cabbage was far more apparent. Next we had fried green tomatoes. They were topped with arugula and a mashed potato and goat cheese fritter. It was an interesting treatment. You can't go wrong with a fried green tomato in the south. \\n\\nMy entree was the fried chicken and lobster mac and cheese. Here's where the menu has a bit of a continuity issue. I like fried chicken. I like lobster. I like mac and cheese. Together they are great, but I didn't get the fusion part of the dish. The only thing remotely 'Asian' about it was a hoison sauce drizzle on the plate (whose flavor really didn't belong with the rest of the meal, in my opinion). The chicken was seasoned well, and had a little bit of heat. The mac and cheese was well executed, creamy and not greasy. I like lobster as much as the next guy, but there is perhaps a better way to treat the mac and cheese to give it a bit of Asian flair. Lobster isn't a bad ingredient, but it should have a place in the dish, rather than being simply an addition (whether it fits or not). To accompany the entree was a bit of broccoli. I'm not sure how it was prepared, but eating it made me flashback to my childhood, when my mom always opted for frozen veggies instead of fresh. I have no idea if the broccoli was frozen before it was cooked, but the consistency appear so at any rate. If it was fresh, it could stand to be cooked for a little less time, so as to remain crisp. That said, a high point of the visit was the plating. All of the dishes arrived and looked stunning. The presentation of everything was beautiful.\\n\\nI'm more than willing to give this place another try. It was heartening to see that there were things on the menu that I didn't see when I checked the website before the visit. This tells me that the kitchen and owners are willing to try new things and tweak what may not be working. There is definitely some talent in the kitchen, but the menu lacks focus. Fusion cuisine is difficult to execute, but not impossible. And having menu items that are Asian inspired, as well as menu items that are distinctly American does not a fusion make. The prices could use a bit of adjustment too. I'm certainly not looking for a free lunch, and I know that it's tough to take a profit in the restaurant industry, but a $25 entree at a casual place is a bit steep. The $14 for my chicken and mac and cheese was barely reasonable. Prices should reflect what you are, not what you'd like to be."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The waffle fries and horseradish dipping sauce are enough to earn 3 stars for Frank. I have not stopped thinking about either since I ate there on Friday. Add on the best veggie hot dog I have ever had (by far) and that gives Frank another star. The only reasons I didn't give Frank 5 stars are: the 20% automatic gratuity for our party of 6 and the strange musical chair routine they do when there is a band playing. \\n    As for the tip, our waiter was excellent and my mother-in-law, who was buying, would have tipped at least 20% anyway, but it's a little bit of a sticker shock to see it tacked on the bill for a party of 6. Isn't it usually 15% for a party of 8 or more? I'm sure it's mentioned somewhere on the menu, but we didn't see it. \\n    The seating situation was a bit strange. We were sat in the center of the downstairs dining room, pretty close to the stage. We were very preoccupied with our delicious food and it took us a while to notice that all of the diners, tables, and chairs around us had disappeared and we found ourselves alone on an island with a table full of wieners. Our server, who again was very nice, explained that the band was coming on soon and they would like to have the entire seating area cleared in about 20 minutes. Luckily we were just about done eating, although a few in our party had just ordered more cocktails, so we weren't necessarily rushed, but it seems like they should give more notice, or just close off that area of seating early on nights that there is live music. If we had wanted dessert, I'm not sure we could have fit it in with the amount of time we had left before our table had to be removed. \\n    I will be back.

We arrived early and had to wait a little bit because this place is really small-we had reservations for the dining room in the back. The layout is nice and it doesn't feel too overly small when you're seated. \\n\\nWe ordered a few appetizers to start-aronchini and an eggplant special appetizer filled with mascapone. Jesse ordered a caesar salad, which could have been an entree on it's one. The bread came out post-ordering, and it was really good. The olive oil with cured olives was very tasty-a few of my olives (I ate them all) tasted a little off. For appetizers, the aronchini was really good-filled with meat, veggies, and cheese. My only suggestion was that it could have used some more spices in it to give it a little bit more flavor. The eggplant appetizer was outrageously good-the eggplant was fried to perfection and stuffed to the gills with rich mascapone. It was really dense and heavy, and I am glad there weren't more than one to eat a piece. The salad was perhaps the bese caesar salad I'd ever had. The romaine was really fresh and the dressing was creamy and very flavorful. If you don't like things top be heavy on the cheese, don't order this caesar salad. I loved it. \\n\\nFor our entrees, Jesse ordered the veal Parmesan and I ordered a seafood pasta in a white wine sauce. Jesse devoured his veal and wouldn't even let me try a taste because he loved it that much. My pasta was really heavy on the calamari, and also contained clams, mussels, and shrimp. The dish was a little bland personally for me-it was prepared well, but I like a little bit more flavor. The sauce just didn't do it for me 100%. The only thing that seemed to soak up the flavor adequately was the clams. It was all tasty, but I did pick out the seafood and leave my pasta. \\n\\nThrough out of meal, the service was nice and attentive without being overbearing, particularly with the space being on the smaller side. One general side note: I wish there wasn't a giant piece of furniture in the ladies' restroom-it doesn't fit and is just strange. \\n\\nThe meal in total was around $65, which was more than reasonable.

This food was literally finger-licking, strip-the-bone like a cave woman, \\"Mmmmmming\\" outloud,  \\"Oh my God\\"-ing good. I got the 1/4 chicken with the rice and macaroni and cheese. I'll admit to being a bit of a chicken when it comes to trying new things (ie: plantains) so I went with rice and macaroni & cheese as my sides to be safe. I had read someone's review on here saying that their rice was the best white rice ever, and for real it is the best white rice ever, lol. I literally said, \\"Oh my God, try this now.\\" to my husband after the first bite. The macaroni & cheese was alright, nothing special. Definitely not something I'd get again. The chicken. Oh dear God, the chicken. You just have to try it. You won't regret it, I promise. \\n\\nMy husband got the 1/2 chicken with fried plantains and corn. The corn was really, really good. The plantains were alright, but really not either of our cup of tea. We also got corn tortillas to share. My husband made a kind of soft taco with his food and the tortillas. I dipped my tortillas in the mild sauce. \\n\\nThe only reason I'm not giving them five stars is because they seemed very unorganized. As time progressed more people started showing up, which is a great thing obviously. But it seemed to take FOREVER to move people along. Example: We ordered tortillas with our meal and noticed after getting to the table that they hadn't made it onto the receipt. I went and stood in line and waited way too dang long while the couple in front if me took their sweet time looking at the menu and slowly placing their order. Sure, we all want them to be happy, but maybe the restaurant needs to invest in a second register to speed the process along for all the customers.

We have been here many times due to the convenient location - food has always been slightly better than mediocre. Today we ordered two regular breakfasts, and a fruit plate for $3.25. This fruit plate was tiny (basically in a soy sauce dish), with 2 brown apple slices, one pineapple piece, a couple of grapes and an abundance of garnish. It was quite a pitiful sight, and we told them it looked fairly measly (to be polite!). They took it back with a bit of attitude and proceeded to charge us when our bill came! We had to again track down our waitress who said nothing (much less an apology) and rang it up again. I am embarrassed for them in the form of their food and service. I have a feeling people come here because of the location, ambience and popularity, but when it comes down to it, the fundamentals for a good restaurant are lacking.

If there's anything that gets me down, it's a cold sausage. My boy's polish was no-nonsense, with fresh kraut and a tasty mustard, and fared better on the temperature scale.

For our sides we got yuca fries, fried plantains, mac & cheese, and half cilantro rice/half beans. Now I'm not a huge fan of cilantro rice, but, in my friend's words, \\"It's not just cilantro rice and beans. It's magic\\", and I might actually agree. Inka can take something that simple and make it taste absolutely delicious. All the sides were amazing, and as I'm typing this up, I'm getting a serious craving for those plantains. \\n\\nQuick service, GREAT food, clean restaurant. Go try Inka, guys.

And of course, I'm going to go.  \\n\\nFirst time I was here was like 3 years ago and I came in here with a friend. We weren't too hungry, but thought we should at least give this a go. So, we walked in on a Sunday at like 8 and it wasn't crowded. Well, that's not entirely correct. The bar area where we sat wasn't crowded. Upstairs... well, that could have been filled, but I had no idea there was an upstairs.  Anyway, I remember ordering the clam chowder and while it was good, I didn't think it was all that great.  Then we got a bunch of oysters on the half-shell since my friend had never tried them. I love raw oysters, and these were pretty good. Initially my friend thought they were gross, but after downing a few more, started to enjoy them.\\n\\nFlashforward to this past weekend, I came here with my family for lunch and discovered the upstairs area. It's kind of cool that it's the oldest restaurant in the country-- it does have some history. We all got the chowder and this time it was really good. It was thick and creamy and there were huge chunks of clams, which also gave the chowder a good natural salty taste. It definitely did not need any extra salt or pepper added. For my meal, I got the oyster roll sandwich. I wish they had more items on the menu with oyster, but i guess there really aren't too many ways to prepare oyster. You either eat 'em raw, or fry 'em. Anyway, it came with fries and those fries were excellent. This was just lunch, but I finished my sandwich and fries and started to pick at other people's plates since they were full.  I tried the lobster and crab cakes-- i wasn't a big fan.  I also tried the scallops and mushrooms over pasta-- the scallops were good, but cooked just a little longer than they should have been. I also tried the fish and chips-- it was ok.\\n\\nOverall, I liked my dish-- this is the Union Oyster House, so they're definitely doing something right with the oysters.

Now, as Ella, it will be my first review of the new venue. I read that the owner was the same one as ran Radda and still runs Zoe MaMa. Went to check it out for a large party of mostly out-of-town guests in for CU Graduation. Since it was also Mother's Day weekend, and most of the guest were staying around for that too, I was asked to find a place for us to all have brunch together. That request was very last minute, which was no easy feat to fulfill in Boulder with less than 48 hours notice. I needed to find a place that could take 12 people! Ella's was the only place I could find that still had room on such short notice at brunch time. Thought I'd better give it a trial run though, just to be sure it was up to snuff, so I went over for breakfast the day before the brunch.\\n\\nFirst impressions:\\nIt has a clean, modern look in the restaurant. \\nIt was pretty empty at 9:30 am on a Saturday, but the weather was also terrible, so maybe people weren't going out? \\nAir temp inside is too chilly. I noticed all of the other diners hadn't removed their coats. Mine was a wet rain jacket though, so I took it off to dry out. Sure wished I had more on than a light weight shirt. I'll remember to bring a sweater tomorrow as it suppose to be even colder, and just as wet.\\nThe menu - only a fair selection to choose from.\\n \\nParking is free in the lot out front, which is shared with the other businesses in this upscale strip mall. There is also a patio, but as it was cold and rainy today, no one was out there. \\n\\nSince I was alone, I took a seat at the bar. Derek was the bartender. Very pleasant fellow. Ordered a Bloody Mary and coffee. The Bloody Mary was too spicy for my taste, and had asked it not to be, but I still drank it. A good vodka brand is used. Tomorrow I'll have a mimosa. The coffee is from Ozo, not one of my fav local brands. I find Ozo coffee to be too bitter.\\n\\nI ordered the Green Goddess Benedict for breakfast. I asked for runny egg yolks but they came out medium. The Hollandaise sauce was a perfect consistency though with a good flavor, not thin, as someone else said. The English Muffin was not tough either. The side was saut√©ed kale and looked lovely, though I don't like kale so much, so I brought it home for one of my adult kids who loves it. Tomorrow, I'll try something else for a side.  \\n\\nI've gotta say, I think the kale side has become too ubiquitous in Colorado, at least in the Boulder/Denver/Ft. Collins area, sort of like the shredded Brussel sprouts side that was all the rage two years ago. Given my choice though, I'll take the latter.\\n\\nMuch of the food is locally sourced, which appeals to me greatly. Fresh is best! I guess, not being a fan of kale, I will be sure to ask for something else as a side in the future. I normally have a side of fruit or bacon with breakfast when eating out, but I just wasn't hungry enough to order any sides this time. \\n\\nThe kitchen was very slow to get my order out, much too slow for how empty this place was, and considering what I had ordered.\\n\\nWhen I asked the GM about the reviews I had read before heading over, he said they've had some changes in their kitchen staff, twice since they opened. He also said they've got a good crew now and have perfected their dishes too. I've only had the one meal so far, so can't comment further yet, but I'm very curious about all the other dishes. So, I'll be back to try them out. \\n\\nSmall selection of local draft beers that I could see. Also saw some top shelf liquors too. Not sure about the wine list as I didn't check on it this time. I'll update after tomorrow's event to let you know how they handle our large party. And again after I try some of the other offerings. I'm hoping it remains long enough for me to do this. \\n\\nOne last thing on payments... they take credit cards, but only MasterCard, Visa and Discover. No AmEx and no checks. Yes to cash, but not sure about debit cards. I don't use a debit card, but isn't that the same as cash??\\n\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nOk, so at the last minute, the Mother's Day event got moved to Denver. I hated to cancel on Ella's, but as the majority of the group was staying closer Denver, I didn't protest. I gotta say though that I wasn't impressed with where we ended up. It was a Irish pub, with terrible service.\\n\\nLater in the evening on Mother's Day, my younger daughter and I went to Ella's for dinner, since I felt badly about canceling the big brunch party. However, our experienced was much the same. I was expecting a slow kitchen again so I brought along a game for to play to kill time (we do this a lot), and a sweater for the chill. \\n\\nThe kitchen was out of half the items we ordered.

Also turns out the people who reserved never show and the tables are given up 5 minutes after we finally get seated but that's not your fault it's just context.\\n\\n- We start by ordering the baked ricotta and it arrives much more charred than usual.\\n\\n- Two women sit next to us and I guess it's the owner's daughter or someone who is good friends with the bartender as they are entertained with free samples and off the menu items. Their bill came out to $29 for wine, pizza, salads, etc ... (I don't think they had a Groupon). My tab for pretty much the same meal was $60.

This was the menu that tried too hard!  Some elements of the courses worked, some didn't.  The potato netted jumbo shrimp were lovely, but the pear & fennel puree had the color and texture of oatmeal -- an unattractive element on the plate; and unfortunately the balsamic drizzle overpowered the delicate flavors of the dish. The pork tenderloin -- beautifully presented -- was cooked perfectly, but lacked seasoning.  A huge disappointment was the execution of the fire charred baby lamb chops -- mine were overly charred and tough.  And the tuscan lamb ragout had the strong lamb-y flavor that makes many diners think that they don't like lamb.

My wife had the enchiladas, they looked amazing and she was pleased.  I had the burrita and some soft tacos.  Everything was incredible.  Very filling and for a great price.  Definitely recommend this place.  It's in the historic part of Ocoee.  I've never been before but it was charming and quaint.

After looking up \\"Best Pizza In Austin, TX\\" on Yelp,my family ate at Via 313 Pizza near the UT campus while we were in Austin a few weeks ago. This was our first time trying Detroit style pizza and well....holy shhhhhh! Again....you have to try it for yourself. I am a thin crust guy and I loved the thicker - cheesy crust. We will be back next time we're in Austin."},{"name":"Lambert's Rainbow Market","address":"777 Morrissey Blvd","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4.5","text":"One of the best markets ever! I came here at least once a week in college. My friends loved the subs and sandwiches but I was known to demolish the salad bar. They have such an amazing variety of veggies and salad toppings. Its wonderful as a grocery store too. I wish I still lived a mile away, but i'll always come back to visit Lamby's."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"If I only had a few hours in Boston, as I was passing through...I would want to spend them here. The historical ambiance is wonderful, The oysters were delicious. We sat at the old oyster bar, so slanted, you have to be very careful not to get a lap full of beer of food.  I live on the west coast, so I have to set this as a goal to visit several more times. FANTASTIC."},{"name":"River Bar","address":"661 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"3","text":"Great location overlooking the Mystic.

I was not familiar with the restaurant and asked for input when placing the order; The St. E's pizza was highly recommended. Upon arrival it looked fresh and delicious! All veggies were fresh and flavorful. The combination of flavors on this pizza are absolute perfection! The staff members that took the order and delivered were very friendly, helpful and patient. Delicious!"},{"name":"Blue Dahlia Bistro","address":"1115 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I ate here three times while I was in town so I guess you could say that I liked it.

Other stuff on the menu looked very tasty and I would return in a minute. Such a cute place!!"},{"name":"Lee and Ricks Oyster Bar","address":"5621 Old Winter Garden Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Complete LET DOWN!I was actually disappointed in this place. I've always heard such great reviews from\\nPeople about it so when I tried it with a bunch of my girl friends I was super excited. First off i came on a friday night  in the early evening. When i first pulled up the parking lot was overflowing with cars. The outside of the restaurant looked like the place had been there for several years.  Since we had a group of 7 we sat in the a big long table rather than the bar bc they couldn't accommodate us there. One of my friends mentioned that we wouldn't get the full experience since we didn't sit at the bar. At the bar they shuck the oysters right in front of you and you get a better deal. $18 for a bucket which equates to almost 3 1/2 dozens oysters. But that's only available at the bar. At the tables it's $7/dozen. Despite that I still kept an open mind. We ordered 5 dozens oysters, 4 orders of Alaskan king crab and 2 orders of fries. \\n\\nWhen we started eating my friends ate 3 bad oysters from different batches. So we stopped eating by the time we got the 3 order. Also I was surprised that they gave such bad service. We were done with the first dozen an place our dirty napkins on the tray Bc we wanted it taken. However when then server dropped off the second dozen she didn't clean anything off the table. It wasn't until told her to take it that she did. But I could tell that places like that don't really care about service because theyve  been open so long\\n\\nAll in all I will not be going back. Especially since my friend got food poisoning when we left."},{"name":"Sofia Pizza House","address":"45 Billings Rd","city":"Quincy","stars":"3","text":"Went here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. The staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean and the prices were very reasonable considering how much food you get.

All of that for $11, and that also includes a drink!"},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Poor Calvin's is a neighborhood gem and hidden jewel.

We waited for over 15 minutes just for that simple task. This place has almost a five star rating; I wonder why!? Literally a hole in the wall. Very disappointing and I only tried it because of the reviews. The product was nothing special. Instead of jam for my biscuit; I was given a liquidly strawberry sauce that was pure sugar. It wasn't very good at all. If you crave a biscuit- go to pine state. If you want quick service, don't come here! It's like they were so stoned, moving in slow motion."},{"name":"LongHorn Steakhouse","address":"4809 W Highway 290","city":"Sunset Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"Awesome place\\nThe C√©sar salad I started off with was dry and kind of worried me since it was my first time here but the main enter√© was amazing!
